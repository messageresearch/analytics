[55:00] the blood in us that's right it is the
[55:01] life of the blood in me it is the token
[55:03] that God's looking for and without it
[55:06] you're not saved amen without it the
[55:08] blood is not applied but the life of the
[55:10] blood is there amen and it's going to
[55:13] bring forth the Life of Christ that's
[55:15] why now that's why we can say it's not
[55:17] me that lives it's Christ that live with
[55:19] in me amen thank the Lord so God bless
[55:23] you all for coming and again the Columbo
[55:25] family and uh our brother Jean Paul Amen
[55:31] brother from onario he's a French
[55:34] brother again of course from the Congo
[55:37] as as as the columbos are so uh God
[55:40] bless him glad to have him with us we
[55:42] enjoyed his Fellowship last night at
[55:44] brother Columbus and also to we're going
[55:47] to welcome our brother Neville and uh
[55:50] we'll let him say the rest of it his
[55:53] name but we're I never as I said we
[55:55] never dreamed that we'd have brother
[55:57] Neville ministering to
[55:59] us but again not the brother Neville of
[56:02] the pastor in Brenham Tabernacle but the
[56:05] brother Neville that is the pastor of uh
[56:08] of our brother John's Church in Ontario
[56:10] and the church in in Washington so we
[56:13] welcome them amen and they all had
[56:15] Fellowship I think some time ago in in
[56:18] the Congo the columbos and our brother
[56:21] Jean and our brother Neville so uh so
[56:25] God is God is mysterious in what he does
[56:28] how he does it when he does it where he
[56:30] does it amen it's up to him there the
[56:33] reason that he brought them here amen
[56:36] never let let them stay in the Congo
[56:38] amen so he brought them here and he
[56:41] brought our brother Neville to to United
[56:44] States and to Canada our brother Jean
[56:46] and so on so to God be the glory brother
[56:50] God is God works in mysterious ways his
[56:53] wonders to perform amen and again this
[56:56] book right here the Bible brother it is
[56:59] absolutely when it comes to the Natural
[57:01] man it is very mysterious amen because
[57:04] they fail to comprehend God's plan God's
[57:07] purpose and God's pattern amen they
[57:09] they'll quote this scripture and move on
[57:11] quote that scripture but they they're
[57:13] not able to apply it to understand the
[57:15] the plan of God the pattern of God and
[57:18] the purpose of God am amen because he in
[57:21] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[57:22] the Earth and he had a plan he had a he
[57:25] had a purpose and he had a pattern amen
[57:28] I trust that he's working out his plan
[57:31] and his purpose and his pattern in our
[57:33] lives and this is why so many fail to
[57:36] recognize what God has done what God's
[57:38] doing what he's going to do because they
[57:40] can't they can't catch it in the word of
[57:42] God oh this is just God's book you know
[57:45] and or the words are good and so on but
[57:48] but it's God's plan amen it's the
[57:50] revelation of his plan it's the
[57:52] revelation of his purpose it's the
[57:54] revelation
[57:55] his pattern how he's going to do it and
[57:57] how he is doing it and that's why we're
[57:59] here is because we recognize the plan
[58:02] the purpose and thank God we recognize
[58:04] the pattern amen it's scripture it's the
[58:07] word so God help us no wonder he said
[58:10] walk in the light don't just don't just
[58:12] talk it walk it amen and live in the
[58:15] light by the great not just can say I
[58:18] believe this I believe that go let your
[58:21] light reflect it let your life reflect
[58:23] it by the gra of almighty God there's
[58:26] too many that are going by the letter of
[58:28] it but they don't have the Dynamics and
[58:30] see brother and sister the Dynamics is
[58:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and
[58:36] without it we're lost it it is God's it
[58:40] is God's response to our faith when we
[58:44] when we repented when we got baptized
[58:47] then God God's not looking to God God
[58:49] appreciates that but what God's looking
[58:51] is in your heart amen is it faith or and
[58:55] and the revelation of the word the
[58:57] Dynamics of the word convicting you is
[58:59] it the life of the blood convicting you
[59:01] and you're responding to that conviction
[59:03] or is it just the the the mechanics
[59:05] letter of the word oh well I want to be
[59:08] good I want to this I want that what
[59:09] does God want amen that's the thing
[59:12] let's not do what's right in our own
[59:14] eyes let's do what's right in the eyes
[59:15] of God Amen let's go forth and reflect
[59:19] what God is doing now amen not what he
[59:23] did even 50 years ago not what he did a
[59:27] 100 years ago for sure amen because
[59:29] where we're going now is a far cry from
[59:33] from where the others what God required
[59:35] of the others God's requiring what he's
[59:37] requiring of us the resurrection and the
[59:39] Rapture and that's the end of it for the
[59:41] Gentile dispensation amen that's the
[59:44] truth it goes into the great Great
[59:47] Tribulation so God give us Grace that
[59:49] we're going to be part of the
[59:51] Resurrection part of the Rapture by the
[59:54] grace of God
[59:55] and the married supper of the Lamb oh
[59:57] it's tremendous so to God be the glory
[1:00:00] let's pray Grace that as the word Goes
[1:00:02] Forth we pray the anointing our brother
[1:00:04] Neville that God's going to anoint and
[1:00:06] him and it'll be Jesus preaching not
[1:00:08] brother Neville amen see as brother vam
[1:00:11] says I got to get myself out of the way
[1:00:13] so and so he can do it amen not only
[1:00:16] signs and wonders but the ministry of
[1:00:17] the word so the ministry got to get
[1:00:19] themselves out the way so the Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] is ministering the word and we got as at
[1:00:24] the con ation you got to get yourself
[1:00:26] out of the way to receive it amen to
[1:00:29] receive it into your soul not into your
[1:00:31] head so the grace of God brother that
[1:00:34] we're not we're not down here not even
[1:00:36] down here we're up here the the the the
[1:00:39] Capstone has come down amen it is the
[1:00:43] crowning of what God has done down
[1:00:45] through the Gentile Church ages amen and
[1:00:47] the crowning what's he going to Do's
[1:00:49] he's going to take us up amen he come
[1:00:52] down to redeem us now he's going to to
[1:00:54] take us up amen by the grace of almighty
[1:00:57] God so the Lord bless you we uh I'll try
[1:01:02] not to be too long but uh because we
[1:01:05] have fellowship at brother marks this
[1:01:07] afternoon sometime because our our
[1:01:09] brother John here is as his flight at
[1:01:11] six o'clock back to Ontario amen so
[1:01:15] we're glad to have our brother John from
[1:01:17] from Ontario and our brother Neville of
[1:01:20] course as I said he Pastors in Ontario
[1:01:22] and he Pastors in Washington so God is
[1:01:25] using our brother so amazing isn't it
[1:01:29] God maybe take an American or Canadian
[1:01:31] and send them to Africa you take an
[1:01:33] African and send them to America amen
[1:01:36] because because we need it amen so to
[1:01:39] God be the glory see it's it's God's
[1:01:42] plan it's God's purpose God
[1:01:44] predestinated it see again like brother
[1:01:47] brother Barry coffee said he said when
[1:01:49] he was here last time I ministered he
[1:01:51] said listen he said every area and
[1:01:53] everything in your life is predestinated
[1:01:55] so it's important to find the will of
[1:01:57] God stay in the will of God Walk In The
[1:01:59] Light so so it's going to manifest the
[1:02:02] predestinated will of God Amen as uh we
[1:02:07] trust that they believe and feel that
[1:02:09] and that we believe it and feel that
[1:02:11] that it was the will of God for for
[1:02:13] those that are here to be here amen and
[1:02:16] I I believe it's was the will of God for
[1:02:17] others to be here but they're not here
[1:02:19] amen so remember you can go to hell for
[1:02:22] what you didn't do not because of what
[1:02:24] you did amen what you didn't do and as
[1:02:27] much as you've done it unto the least of
[1:02:28] my brethren you've done it to me and
[1:02:30] Jesus said as much you didn't do it you
[1:02:32] didn't do it to me amen so God help us
[1:02:36] that we'll respect and honor and
[1:02:37] reverence one another in the fear of God
[1:02:40] and thank God for salvation thank God
[1:02:43] for Redemption thank God for yes
[1:02:46] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:02:48] of the Holy Ghost that's the new bir
[1:02:51] amen the prophet did say before the
[1:02:53] seals that all you had to do is repent
[1:02:55] and be baptized you're born again but he
[1:02:57] said oh he said and after the seals he
[1:02:59] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:01] the new birth amen it is you're born
[1:03:04] again is God receiving your faith coming
[1:03:07] into your heart driving the devil's
[1:03:08] influence out and putting the influence
[1:03:10] of the word in the Holy Ghost again it's
[1:03:14] Christ that liveth in you and in me so

[1:19:41] as we open our Bible to 1 Samuel chapter
[1:19:45] 8 as I told you I really want to speak

[1:20:06] amen amen because the prophet is our
[1:20:10] absolute do you believe it amen thank
[1:20:13] you 1 Samuel chapter 8 and it came to
[1:20:18] pass when Samuel was old that he made
[1:20:23] his sons Jud judges over
[1:20:27] Israel now the name of his first born
[1:20:29] was Joel and the name of his second ABA
[1:20:34] there were judges in
[1:20:38] BBA and his sons walked not in his ways
[1:20:42] but turned aside at
[1:20:45] luck and took brides and perverted
[1:20:49] judgment amen then all the Elders of
[1:20:53] Israel gathered themselves together and
[1:20:56] came to Samuel andto Rama and said unto
[1:21:00] him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons
[1:21:05] walk not in the ways now make us a king
[1:21:09] to judge us like all the
[1:21:14] nations listen what they ask
[1:21:17] for we want to be like the rest of the
[1:21:21] people so they knew knew we
[1:21:23] weren't as the rest of the people we are
[1:21:27] a separated group of people
[1:21:30] am now they want to be like the rest of
[1:21:34] the
[1:21:35] people but the thing displeased
[1:21:40] Samuel when they said give us a king to
[1:21:44] judge us and Samuel prayed unto the
[1:21:48] Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel
[1:21:51] listen what the Lord says
[1:21:53] hearken unto the voice of the people in
[1:21:56] all that they say unto thee for they
[1:21:58] have not rejected the who was
[1:22:03] Samuel the prophet of God amen amen God
[1:22:07] is telling him they are not rejecting
[1:22:10] thee but they have rejected me that I
[1:22:14] should not reain over them when you
[1:22:18] reject the
[1:22:19] prophet you reject God that's right
[1:22:24] amen according to all the
[1:22:27] works which they have done since the the
[1:22:30] day that I brought them out of Egypt
[1:22:34] even unto this day where with they have
[1:22:36] forsaken me and served other the gods so
[1:22:40] do they also unto thee amen so be
[1:22:45] careful when you deal with a
[1:22:49] prophet we need a revelation when we see
[1:22:52] a prophet what does it mean amen who a
[1:22:56] prophet
[1:22:57] is
[1:23:00] yes I'll jump let's go toward the end of
[1:23:03] the
[1:23:05] chapter the prophet told them this is
[1:23:08] what will happen when you have your king
[1:23:11] they said no we want a king that would
[1:23:13] lead us to the
[1:23:15] war but you remember they got their King
[1:23:18] they had
[1:23:20] saw remember that there was a
[1:23:24] war they said give us a king that will
[1:23:28] lead us to war there was a war
[1:23:31] Goliath was there but the king could not
[1:23:35] lead them to war amen
[1:23:39] amen verse 19 nevertheless the people
[1:23:43] refused to obey the voice of
[1:23:48] Samuel and they said nay but we will
[1:23:53] have a king over
[1:23:55] us that we also may be like all the
[1:24:00] nations and that our King May judge us
[1:24:06] and go out before us and fight our
[1:24:11] battles when the battle came up the king
[1:24:16] could not go and fight for them amen we
[1:24:21] need a prophet amen amen shall we pray

[1:25:26] need your help

[1:25:45] from the church you'll have a dead
[1:25:48] adoration a dead worship amen amen
[1:25:52] so keep Mr amen here
[1:25:56] amen let's read second
[1:25:59] Peter chapter
[1:26:01] 2 second Peter chapter 2 verse 20 and
[1:26:09] 21st knowing this that no Prophecy of
[1:26:14] the scripture is of any private
[1:26:17] interpretation amen for the prophecy now
[1:26:21] listen the prophecy came not in all time
[1:26:26] by the will of men but holy men of men
[1:26:30] of God spake as they were moved by the
[1:26:34] Holy
[1:26:34] Ghost so the prophet were speaking as
[1:26:38] they were moved by the holy spirit so it
[1:26:43] means it's not the prophet who speaking
[1:26:46] it's the holy spirit it's the great God
[1:26:50] who is
[1:26:51] speaking and let's
[1:26:53] finish with
[1:26:55] Hebrews

[1:27:54] amen amen he hasn't changed butam says
[1:27:59] God doesn't change his nature that's
[1:28:02] right he can change his form right but
[1:28:06] regarding his nature he's the same when
[1:28:09] he's acting you will remember it's
[1:28:12] always God because we'll act always the
[1:28:16] same way amen amen the
[1:28:21] prophets we will go
[1:28:23] from one Court to another Court one
[1:28:27] scripture from another scripture I was
[1:28:30] praying the Lord I was I was asking to
[1:28:32] the Lord I told him Lord I want you this
[1:28:35] morning to remember where we

[1:28:49] here amen amen amen that's right
[1:28:52] brother Bram says in the exposition of
[1:28:55] the seven Church ages chapter 10 he says
[1:28:59] this listen to me this age started just
[1:29:05] after the turn of the 20th
[1:29:08] century
[1:29:09] Leia as it was to be the age in which
[1:29:13] the true church would return to being
[1:29:17] the bride she was at
[1:29:20] Pentecost it is in our time the church
[1:29:24] needs to be the CH bride the same bride
[1:29:28] the same church the head at the
[1:29:30] Pentecost that's right am what a Time
[1:29:35] amen the church need to
[1:29:38] understand where are we
[1:29:41] at what time are we living
[1:29:44] here we need to understand what must be
[1:29:48] our
[1:29:50] position this is the time the church
[1:29:52] needs to go back what the church used to
[1:29:55] be at Pentecost and that's why the
[1:29:58] prophet came Malachi for to take us
[1:30:01] bring us back to the Pentecost
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:06] amen we know that there must be no
[1:30:09] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[1:30:14] that's right that's right what a
[1:30:17] time that's why in our church I took
[1:30:20] almost a year teaching on the church I
[1:30:24] was talking to the pastor yesterday
[1:30:26] people the church need to understand
[1:30:29] what's Church you remember brother
[1:30:31] Brandon preached a message five definite
[1:30:37] identifications of the true amen
[1:30:41] Church in that
[1:30:43] message he asked five questions he dealt
[1:30:46] with five questions the first one was
[1:30:49] what's the church
[1:30:53] because sometimes we think the church it
[1:30:55] is this
[1:30:57] building in part
[1:31:00] yes but we need also to see the other
[1:31:04] facet it means the body of Christ Church
[1:31:09] means the kingdom of God God is ruling
[1:31:13] over you you become his prisoner amen so
[1:31:18] we went through that we haven't finished
[1:31:21] yet we have
[1:31:22] we just turning around because the
[1:31:25] prophet how many time I can't the
[1:31:28] prophet pronounce this word church I
[1:31:31] don't if it 30,000 time or something
[1:31:34] like
[1:31:42] that the
[1:31:44] prophets but before I get there I want
[1:31:47] to greet you with something in the
[1:31:51] message humble
[1:31:53] thyself humble thyself paragraph
[1:31:59] 77 you know people want Power Church
[1:32:04] listen that's to you m
[1:32:09] Jesus people want power and really they
[1:32:13] don't know what power
[1:32:18] is the way up is now amen
[1:32:23] always if you want Power see how humble
[1:32:28] you can
[1:32:30] get just get away from all your worldly
[1:32:33] thinking and humble yourself before God
[1:32:36] and then you've got more power than the
[1:32:39] man that runs all over the building and
[1:32:42] makes a big lot of noise see because you
[1:32:47] have been able to conquer yourself and
[1:32:51] commit yourself to Christ you see to
[1:32:54] humble yourself before him that's really
[1:32:59] power am remember that evening light
[1:33:07] Tabernacle the prophet says you show me
[1:33:10] a church that's
[1:33:13] humble real
[1:33:16] humble not arrogancy
[1:33:19] amen a church just a sweet Humble Church
[1:33:23] I'll show you a church that has the
[1:33:26] favor and power of God in it
[1:33:30] am amen that's the thing it takes
[1:33:35] humility humbling ourselves before God
[1:33:38] letting God just work through us don't
[1:33:41] have to make a lot of
[1:33:43] noise just wait upon the Lord as a
[1:33:46] church be like Rebecca listening towards
[1:33:50] El is telling
[1:33:53] her this is what Isaac likes this is
[1:33:57] what your God
[1:33:59] likes be
[1:34:01] quiet amen and in question is
[1:34:05] answers question and answers number four
[1:34:11] 197 brother Bram says this look at all
[1:34:14] of us that took our
[1:34:17] vows and marched around the
[1:34:20] altar we seen them come and go one from
[1:34:23] the
[1:34:24] other have you noticed those who stayed
[1:34:28] with the message how they
[1:34:31] went watch people who stayed with the
[1:34:34] message as they live this world what we
[1:34:37] call death brother Bram said have you
[1:34:40] noticed have you been ever been near
[1:34:43] someone who has been the message when
[1:34:45] they are passing
[1:34:46] away How Sweet It
[1:34:49] Is amen
[1:34:52] now he's asking now think of the ones
[1:34:56] who got away from the message how they
[1:35:01] went think of
[1:35:07] it that's why be merciful if you have a
[1:35:10] good church like the one you have here
[1:35:12] especially the men of God you have here
[1:35:15] amen the
[1:35:17] pastor be very grateful to the Lord
[1:35:20] people of God
[1:35:22] God doesn't not care about the
[1:35:24] number how many you are in your church
[1:35:27] how many got saved in the day of
[1:35:30] Noah how
[1:35:33] many eight people only one
[1:35:37] family how many people were on
[1:35:40] Earth in that day Jesus
[1:35:46] said as it was in the day of Noah so
[1:35:49] shall it will it be in the coming of the
[1:35:51] son of man there were so many people
[1:35:54] like today how many got saved just eight
[1:35:58] people God doesn't care about how many
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:02] are but if you have a man of God that
[1:36:05] keep you in the word of God be merciful
[1:36:08] church amen and that's why the prophet
[1:36:11] says in the exposition of the seven
[1:36:13] Church age chapter
[1:36:15] 5 I'll go
[1:36:19] right straight to that brother say the
[1:36:22] last day
[1:36:23] Messenger will appear in God's appointed
[1:36:28] time it is the end time now as all know
[1:36:33] this is the end time as all know for
[1:36:36] Israel is in the Homeland at any time
[1:36:41] now he will come according to Malachi
[1:36:44] when we see him he will be dedicated to
[1:36:48] the
[1:36:49] world he will be in indicated pointed
[1:36:52] out in the words Revelation
[1:36:55] 10:7 and God will vindicate his ministry
[1:36:59] he will preach the truth as did Elijah
[1:37:03] yes and be ready for Mount Zion Showdown
[1:37:07] right now
[1:37:09] listen many will misunderstand
[1:37:14] him even his own Believers in this
[1:37:19] message many will misunderstand him
[1:37:23] because they have been taught scripture
[1:37:26] in a certain way which they consider
[1:37:31] truth
[1:37:34] church when he comes against
[1:37:37] that they will not believe amen that's
[1:37:41] why brother Ram said we need a strip
[1:37:44] down we really need to empty
[1:37:49] ourselves now listen
[1:37:52] even true ministers will
[1:37:56] misunderstand the messenger because so
[1:37:59] much has been called God's truth by
[1:38:03] deceivers even through ministers you'll
[1:38:06] see a great Pastor he
[1:38:10] misunderstands the prophet messenger
[1:38:12] amen that's why pray for your pastor
[1:38:16] that's why I pray for your minister
[1:38:18] because brother Bram
[1:38:19] says there there is something important
[1:38:22] where you go to
[1:38:24] church amen am what they teach you in
[1:38:28] that church and who teaches you it's
[1:38:33] really important because brother says
[1:38:35] that the church is like a boat that will
[1:38:38] take you to your final
[1:38:40] destination and the captain of that boat
[1:38:44] it's really important to have a good
[1:38:46] Captain who knows where you go amen amen
[1:38:50] amen so pray for your pastor because in
[1:38:54] the end time evangelism paragraph 143
[1:38:57] brother Bram says and it's
[1:39:01] always it's always friends the leaders
[1:39:06] each time through the change of this
[1:39:09] dispensation has got the people all
[1:39:11] messed up
[1:39:13] yeah amen the ministers these are the
[1:39:17] guys that always mess up things
[1:39:22] that's why people get in confusion
[1:39:26] that's it hasn't been so much the
[1:39:30] people if the gospel would have stayed
[1:39:33] in the Pulpit where it
[1:39:35] belongs now you see because the pulit is
[1:39:39] weak that's why we see even in message
[1:39:43] churches things don't go very well
[1:39:46] because the pulpit is so weak it's the
[1:39:49] leaders it is the preachers yes amen
[1:39:52] that are confusing people but the
[1:39:54] promise said my people shall not be in
[1:39:57] confusion that's right
[1:39:59] am pray for your
[1:40:04] pastor again about your pastor Ephesian
[1:40:08] CH that message brother Bram preached
[1:40:11] paragraph 135 brother Bram was reading
[1:40:15] the scripture in the Revelation I think
[1:40:17] chapter 2 verse four and four and five
[1:40:20] he it says remember therefore from on
[1:40:23] that have fallen now he gives the
[1:40:26] interpretation because as we'll see this
[1:40:29] morning the prophet is God's interpreter
[1:40:32] of his word can we say amen
[1:40:37] Amen brother 136 paragraph he said all
[1:40:41] the
[1:40:42] words if you got a god-filled
[1:40:47] pastor like the one you have here filled
[1:40:50] with the Holy Ghost and you try to hold
[1:40:54] him under your finger and say well if he
[1:40:59] says anything about us having a robbed
[1:41:02] qu if he says anything about about us
[1:41:06] wearing
[1:41:07] makeup we will just excommunicate him so
[1:41:11] you threaten your pastor brother Bram
[1:41:14] says don't you worry God will do it
[1:41:18] before you get a chance to amen
[1:41:21] don't
[1:41:22] worry he'll go out and preach to stones
[1:41:26] on the street before he had compromise
[1:41:29] with that kind of stuff because the true
[1:41:32] servant of God cannot compromise with
[1:41:34] the TRU
[1:41:36] amen if you kick me out God will take me
[1:41:41] amen you got a pastor that's really
[1:41:44] tells you the
[1:41:46] truth you ought to honor God and stay in
[1:41:49] the spirit and worship God realizing
[1:41:54] that you are going to be lost if you
[1:41:58] don't see that's why I'm telling you
[1:42:02] pray for your pastor you need to worship
[1:42:04] God and I believe you truly worship God
[1:42:07] in this church amen
[1:42:10] amen but people live today like this is
[1:42:15] the only thing there was you see people
[1:42:18] everything they do is to go to work come
[1:42:22] back home they have two three jobs they
[1:42:24] forgot going to
[1:42:27] church they think the only life is this
[1:42:32] one you don't realize you got a s that's
[1:42:37] going to live here and go somewhere
[1:42:40] that's true that's
[1:42:41] right brothers and sister we are going
[1:42:44] somewhere amen and when you go somewhere
[1:42:48] what do you do you make reserv

[1:42:52] hotel where you are going to
[1:42:56] stay we are going somewhere we better

[1:43:01] reservations

[1:43:08] here the way you live and the way you do
[1:43:11] out holding grudges and mean and
[1:43:15] everything and then run to church on

[1:43:22] on you amen
[1:43:25] amen you see people the way we live now
[1:43:28] it's like this is the only life we don't
[1:43:31] care about God look at people as soon as
[1:43:34] you wake up your hands are on your cell
[1:43:36] phone you want to see what messages you
[1:43:39] have
[1:43:40] received even Christians Believers in
[1:43:44] this message we don't start our day
[1:43:47] dedicating Our Lives to God the first
[1:43:51] thing you wake up I tell you brothers
[1:43:53] and sister the cell phone that invention
[1:43:57] came to distract the
[1:44:00] bride amen it didn't come from for
[1:44:04] people in the world it came to distract
[1:44:06] you
[1:44:08] yes always tell my church my wife can
[1:44:12] testify if she were here the first thing
[1:44:15] I do in
[1:44:18] morning anyway when I sleep I sleep on
[1:44:21] my bed usually I have back in the
[1:44:23] morning when I wake up usually I sleep
[1:44:26] in my office right on the floor when I
[1:44:28] sleep on the floor I feel
[1:44:31] better and it gives me opportunity when
[1:44:34] I wake up at night listening to the
[1:44:36] voice of God in this last day and you
[1:44:39] can feel the presence of God in my D
[1:44:41] room amen and I can go into prayer I
[1:44:45] don't know why when I'm sleeping by my
[1:44:47] wife on the bed she
[1:44:49] sleep she's she's very comfortable in on
[1:44:52] her bed and I ask him do you have back
[1:44:55] no I don't have back but why every time
[1:44:58] I'm sleeping on that bed on that
[1:45:00] mattress I have back I need to sleep on
[1:45:02] the floor in my office I just lay down
[1:45:05] there uh we have the carpet but I put a
[1:45:09] little bit uh a blanket that's where I

[1:52:42] that you've got Types on what we believe
[1:52:46] can we say Amen because as a church we
[1:52:48] need to know what we believe in we need
[1:52:51] to understand what the teaching of our
[1:52:54] church what are our doctrines in this
[1:52:57] message and the prophet says here you've
[1:53:00] got the tpes on what we believe you've
[1:53:02] got the tpes on discipline in the church
[1:53:06] how we behave ourself in the Church of
[1:53:10] God that's why I was telling you we have
[1:53:14] already taken a year just to to teach on
[1:53:17] the church how you behave in the church
[1:53:22] how we got to come here together and see

[1:53:45] God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:53:49] wait
[1:53:50] for them doors to open out y to get him

[1:53:57] you don't feel that way then I tell you
[1:54:01] it's time you got to pray amen amen if
[1:54:06] you don't feel the pressure and the

[1:54:13] I need to run and go to church dedicate
[1:54:16] my life take care of my soul amen
[1:54:19] because it worth 10,000 WS if you don't
[1:54:23] have that feeling the prophet advise you
[1:54:27] start
[1:54:29] praying something is wrong with
[1:54:35] you and to finish with my
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:39] greeting
[1:54:41] perseverance paragraph
[1:54:43] 8 so be in prayer can we say amen amen
[1:54:49] what whatever you do just look up
[1:54:53] today and pray
[1:54:57] pray that's all that's the only hope
[1:55:01] that we have is prayer amen when I see
[1:55:07] the life of brother branam lately during
[1:55:10] our Wednesday prayer meetings we took
[1:55:15] the whole Bible from the beginning you
[1:55:18] all see God people they like worshiping
[1:55:21] God they like praying am we took Abraham
[1:55:26] as soon as God revealed himself unto
[1:55:28] Abraham the Bible said he built an
[1:55:31] altar amen so he can give himself a
[1:55:36] sacrifice on that altar that's right
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:40] amen Elijah the
[1:55:43] prophet when he came the first
[1:55:46] time the first thing he did is to
[1:55:48] restore the
[1:55:51] altar do you remember that in the Bible
[1:55:54] Jesus his life was prayer brother bram's
[1:55:58] life he said the success of my Ministry
[1:56:00] is the time I stand in prayer with God
[1:56:02] Amen because that's the only hope that
[1:56:05] we have is prayer amen amen and with
[1:56:11] that now let's get started with the
[1:56:17] prophets in the message I will rece St
[1:56:20] follow me
[1:56:24] carefully
[1:56:26] nowadays a lot of things going on it
[1:56:30] seems the church has lost its
[1:56:33] identification it seems in this message
[1:56:36] we don't really
[1:56:37] grasp the Revelation who a prophet is
[1:56:42] and that's why you see people everybody
[1:56:45] can come on and they post things even on
[1:56:48] the internet
[1:56:52] anything they can put there and the BR
[1:56:55] is reading all this our foolishness
[1:56:59] excuse me but to me that's foolishness
[1:57:06] amen I will restore paragraph 58 now
[1:57:09] there is a difference between
[1:57:12] prophecy a gift of of Prophecy and a
[1:57:17] prophet can we say amen amen
[1:57:20] right it will be hard for me to finish
[1:57:23] talking about the prophet in just one
[1:57:25] service because it's a whole
[1:57:27] teaching right but pray for me so I can
[1:57:33] add one more Stone to build this body of
[1:57:36] Christ
[1:57:38] amen did you know that there is a
[1:57:42] difference in between a gift of Prophecy
[1:57:45] and a prophet and there is where you
[1:57:48] brethren in the L went
[1:57:51] off now if a brother came from the L
[1:57:56] church when he hears it it must be the
[1:57:59] grace of God otherwise he'll say William
[1:58:02] brandham is a false prophet why because
[1:58:04] he's attacking his Doctrine amen but the
[1:58:07] prophet is
[1:58:09] Right somebody make a prophecy and you
[1:58:12] call them a prophet that's
[1:58:15] wrong can we say amen amen amen
[1:58:22] the next time you've seen an nrow
[1:58:25] usually these people that profess that's
[1:58:27] one of one of the gifts in the body
[1:58:30] that's right amen and the prophet said
[1:58:32] it can go from one person to another
[1:58:34] person you can prophesy today and that's
[1:58:36] it for the rest of your life it can be
[1:58:39] like
[1:58:40] that and usually if you don't watch over
[1:58:44] the prophecies in the church you will
[1:58:46] see errors will be coming through this
[1:58:50] gifts that's why the prophet said that's
[1:58:52] why the fivefold Ministries there to
[1:58:54] watch over these gifts am but today what
[1:58:58] we see people can even leave a church
[1:59:00] they say they don't want my gifts it's
[1:59:02] not your gifts that's right it's God's
[1:59:05] gift but the operation need to be in the
[1:59:08] order in Perfect Harmony to what the
[1:59:10] prophet told
[1:59:16] us somebody make a prophecy and you call
[1:59:19] a prophet that's wrong the next time
[1:59:21] you've seen an error a gift of Prophecy
[1:59:24] and a prophet different right the gift
[1:59:27] of Prophecy and the prophets these are
[1:59:30] two different
[1:59:32] things God in s times spoke to the
[1:59:35] fathers to the prophets these last days
[1:59:38] through his son Jesus Christ a gift of
[1:59:41] Prophecy is in the
[1:59:44] body do you get me and two or three has
[1:59:48] to say before it to see to be judged
[1:59:52] when it's spoken amen when a brother or
[1:59:55] sister gives a prophecy in the church it
[1:59:57] needs to go before two or three
[2:00:00] judges right they need to tell us
[2:00:03] whether it's true or
[2:00:06] false because God doesn't lie and the
[2:00:10] prophet gives an example let's say you
[2:00:13] need you live near the
[2:00:18] railroad
[2:00:20] we come to church that's why I keep
[2:00:22] telling the Believers you need to get to
[2:00:24] church on time the prophet said before
[2:00:27] the service begins already be there
[2:00:30] praying I was telling people do you
[2:00:32] believe God has taken away the gifts
[2:00:34] from the church no the gifts are still
[2:00:37] there but the way we behave when you
[2:00:40] come to church the service has already
[2:00:42] started how can you speak in tongue
[2:00:44] because the tongues and the prophecies
[2:00:46] the prophet say they happened before the
[2:00:49] service begins now when you come after
[2:00:52] the service has begun how can you speak
[2:00:54] in tongue and be in order with God's
[2:00:56] word hallelujah the gifts are still
[2:00:59] there but we don't understand how to
[2:01:03] take care of them amen amen you give a
[2:01:06] prophecy brother you live by the ra
[2:01:09] railroad tomorrow take your family out
[2:01:13] because at 2: p.m. a train there will be
[2:01:17] a wre a trend crash leave your home with
[2:01:21] your family at 2: p.m. something will
[2:01:25] happen you bring your
[2:01:27] prophecy to the judges there will be two
[2:01:30] or three the judges would look at it God
[2:01:34] will give them the wisdom can we say
[2:01:36] Amen am they will have the wi wisdom to
[2:01:39] tell okay this is from God this is not
[2:01:42] from God because as I said in these
[2:01:45] prophecies maybe I have something
[2:01:48] against you
[2:01:50] amen and we come to church and I give a
[2:01:53] prophecy against you because I have
[2:01:55] something against
[2:01:56] you if that's the case the judge must
[2:02:00] say no we know this brother has an issue
[2:02:02] with that brother or that sister has an
[2:02:05] issue with the sister he says this
[2:02:08] probably because of the issue Brother
[2:02:10] come on you need to fix it we won't
[2:02:13] accept this prophecy this time can we
[2:02:16] say amen amen
[2:02:19] if it comes from God tomorrow if it were
[2:02:23] me I'll take my family maybe go on top
[2:02:26] of the mountains are see around the
[2:02:28] islands honey let's go far away at 2:
[2:02:31] p.m. we must see a train coming and
[2:02:35] stuck down my home when you see it
[2:02:38] happen brother Bram says God is with you
[2:02:41] amen because God cannot lie if it
[2:02:45] doesn't happen what you do you call the
[2:02:48] person who gave the prophecy and the
[2:02:51] judges they bring them in front here the
[2:02:54] pastor lay his hands on them to cast out
[2:02:56] all these evil spirits
[2:02:59] am that's what the prophet says here
[2:03:02] when they give a prophecy it must be
[2:03:06] brought in front of the church it must
[2:03:08] be brought in front of two or three
[2:03:10] before it's given to the
[2:03:12] church but you've never seen nobody
[2:03:16] stand before
[2:03:17] Moses
[2:03:19] Isaiah
[2:03:21] Jeremiah have you seen people coming to
[2:03:24] Moses say oh I want to judge your
[2:03:25] prophecy what you said it doesn't happen
[2:03:28] you cannot judge a
[2:03:30] prophet that's why the prophet says
[2:03:33] there is a difference between the gift
[2:03:34] of Prophecy and a
[2:03:38] prophet K tried to stand before Moses
[2:03:41] one day you remember what happened when
[2:03:45] K stood before Moses what happened
[2:03:50] not only he died but even his
[2:03:54] family innocent
[2:03:56] people family members because that sin
[2:04:00] against God's
[2:04:02] prophets it took all everybody in the
[2:04:05] family so you need to be very
[2:04:08] careful be very careful daddy mommy be
[2:04:12] very careful because your action can
[2:04:14] ruin the entire
[2:04:17] family K tried to stand before Moses one
[2:04:21] day and the word
[2:04:23] swallowed
[2:04:24] him or the Earth swallowed him up see
[2:04:28] but a prophet is born it's
[2:04:32] election
[2:04:34] amen all through life it's the word of
[2:04:37] the Lord just as it comes to
[2:04:40] them brother Bram said the same
[2:04:43] thing I'll jump to the message after the
[2:04:47] one that that was about to appear on the
[2:04:50] screen let's go to joah
[2:04:53] jar I'm repeating this I'm laying out a
[2:04:58] foundation for what I want to say Amen
[2:05:01] now there is a difference between a gift
[2:05:04] of Prophecy and a prophet one is a gift
[2:05:08] of Prophecy and the other one is a
[2:05:10] prophet a gift of Prophecy must be
[2:05:13] judged by two or three spiritual men it
[2:05:16] can come upon one person to night be on
[2:05:20] another person tomorrow night and on
[2:05:23] another one the next night am what it is
[2:05:26] is a gift in every local body a church
[2:05:31] but a prophet is
[2:05:34] different they are born prophets amen
[2:05:38] and they come up prophets all that they
[2:05:42] say must be
[2:05:45] true amen amen you didn't say Amen amen
[2:05:49] amen everything a prophet says must be
[2:05:53] the
[2:05:53] true every time and it cannot be
[2:05:57] recognized as a prophet in the office if
[2:06:01] it's not true then it's not the prophet
[2:06:03] of
[2:06:07] God in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:11] paragraph
[2:06:14] 212 I'm going what in red a prophet
[2:06:19] is the word amen can we say amen
[2:06:24] amen we know that the word Prophet means
[2:06:29] a Divine Divine interpreter of the
[2:06:34] word it's him who tells you yes this is
[2:06:38] what it means amen listen friends I'll
[2:06:41] give you an example do you remember
[2:06:43] Joseph brother Bram said Joseph was a
[2:06:46] prophet can we say amen amen amen Joseph
[2:06:49] was in Egypt and the king of Egypt
[2:06:53] Pharaoh he had a
[2:06:56] dream he saw seven fat C CES or
[2:07:02] cows he also saw seven skinny cows and
[2:07:08] the skinny cows ate the fat
[2:07:13] cows now Pharaoh he didn't know what it
[2:07:17] meant it was like a prophecy
[2:07:20] amen and Joseph came he was God's
[2:07:25] interpreter God's revealer of the word
[2:07:29] of God he came he told Pharaoh what did
[2:07:33] you see oh I saw seven skinny cows
[2:07:37] eating seven fat cows I'm trouble what
[2:07:41] does it mean Joseph told him oh what you
[2:07:44] saw it's not
[2:07:47] cows
[2:07:49] do you remember
[2:07:52] that I know you saw cows but I know what
[2:07:55] it
[2:07:56] means these are seven years of abundance
[2:08:00] they will be eaten up by seven
[2:08:03] years of
[2:08:09] nothing now if you were
[2:08:12] there there is nothing written about
[2:08:15] it who would you have believed
[2:08:20] Joseph was there he told Pharaoh what
[2:08:23] you saw this is what it means it's not
[2:08:26] seven cows God was speaking to you by
[2:08:30] symbols but as a prophet I tell you what
[2:08:34] you saw seven years of abundance and
[2:08:37] seven seven years of emptiness we have
[2:08:40] nothing so be prepared and because
[2:08:43] Pharaoh believed what the prophet told
[2:08:45] him he prospered that's right amen
[2:08:49] amen amen
[2:08:52] amen you remember King
[2:08:56] nebuchad with Daniel the king dreamed
[2:08:59] the dream he forgot what he
[2:09:04] saw and the Prophet Daniel came he told
[2:09:08] him I see what you
[2:09:11] dream no brother Bram said many people
[2:09:14] brought to me their dreams and they
[2:09:16] would not tell me everything the dream
[2:09:19] they will tell Prophet The Prophet
[2:09:21] brother this is what I dreamed I dream
[2:09:23] this this would look at them and tell
[2:09:26] them you didn't tell me
[2:09:30] everything this is what you left off
[2:09:32] this is what you left off this is what
[2:09:34] you left off that serve the Lord this is
[2:09:37] what your dream means you can go in
[2:09:41] peace exactly as it happened with Daniel
[2:09:46] the king said I forgot what I have
[2:09:49] dreamed first tell me what I have
[2:09:52] dreamed and then I will know that the
[2:09:53] interpretation is right is
[2:09:57] correct oh King what you ask nobody can
[2:10:01] do that except the gods whose dwelling
[2:10:05] are not among the son of
[2:10:07] man this is what the magician said back
[2:10:11] there in Babylon they will judge you
[2:10:14] people of this age they will tell you we
[2:10:18] wanted somebody like that in our day how
[2:10:22] come God sent you one and you missed
[2:10:28] him Daniel said oh King I
[2:10:32] see I see a big
[2:10:35] tree and I see verett coming make their
[2:10:39] nest upon the tree oh that tree oh King
[2:10:43] it's
[2:10:47] you like in
[2:10:49] Genesis the tree of life it's
[2:10:54] aen can we say Amen Daniel told him that
[2:10:58] tree it's you oh King it was not written
[2:11:02] anywhere but when the king accepted what
[2:11:06] the prophet told him he
[2:11:10] prospered can we say Amen
[2:11:16] am let me repeat that quotation a
[2:11:20] prophet is the
[2:11:22] word we know that the word Prophet means
[2:11:26] a div Divine interpreter of the word the
[2:11:30] div Divine word is written and the
[2:11:34] prophets has the Divine spirit of God
[2:11:37] within him and you know the prophet in
[2:11:41] the Old Testament was called God how
[2:11:44] many knew
[2:11:46] that that's why in the unpon
[2:11:49] unpardonable
[2:11:53] sin
[2:11:55] 123 brother Bram says this if you need
[2:11:59] these quotations I left them with
[2:12:00] brother M you can get them from from
[2:12:04] him
[2:12:06] sin Let Me begin
[2:12:11] 1:22 I had a place I wanted you to show
[2:12:15] to show you the first place of this scof
[2:12:19] here what he wrote in a footnote here I
[2:12:23] believe it's found in Romans the thir
[2:12:25] chapter he said here as he interpreted
[2:12:29] it through Webster of course in footnote
[2:12:32] he said sin is rejecting the revealed
[2:12:36] will of God
[2:12:39] Amen sin is rejecting the revealed will
[2:12:45] of
[2:12:47] God 12 123 sin in its initial form is to
[2:12:54] reject the revealed word of God or will
[2:13:00] of
[2:13:01] God when God has revealed something as
[2:13:06] his
[2:13:07] will and to reject
[2:13:10] that is to blaspheme or to reject
[2:13:15] God can we say Amen
[2:13:18] exactly what we read in 1 Samuel chapter
[2:13:22] 8 they rejected the will of God that was
[2:13:25] to be led by a prophet and by doing so
[2:13:28] they blasphemed
[2:13:31] amen let me repeat that sin in its
[2:13:35] initial form is to reject the revealed
[2:13:38] word of
[2:13:39] God or will of God when God has
[2:13:44] revealed something as his will and to to
[2:13:48] reject that is to blaspheme or to reject
[2:13:56] God how many blasphemers we have in this
[2:14:02] message let's go to Exodus chapter 18
[2:14:06] brother M yeah it's
[2:14:09] there you remember the children of
[2:14:13] Israel they come out of Egypt they were
[2:14:15] going to the promised land they were in
[2:14:19] the wilderness and they met Jetro Moses
[2:14:25] father-in-law when Jetro the priest of
[2:14:30] Midian Moses father-in-law heard of all
[2:14:33] that God has done for
[2:14:36] Moses and for Israel his people and that
[2:14:39] the Lord has brought Israel out of Egypt
[2:14:44] then Jetro Moses father-in-law took
[2:14:47] zipora
[2:14:48] Moses wife after he had sent her back
[2:14:52] and her two sons of which the name of
[2:14:55] the one was gam for he said I have been
[2:15:00] an alen in a Strange Land and the name
[2:15:03] of the other was elzar for the god of my
[2:15:06] father said he was mine help and
[2:15:09] delivered me from The Sword of
[2:15:12] pharaoh and Jetro Moses father-in-law
[2:15:15] came with his sons and his wife unto MOS
[2:15:17] Moses Into the Wilderness where he
[2:15:21] encamped at the M of God and he said
[2:15:24] unto Moses I thy
[2:15:27] father-in-law Jetro I'm come unto thee
[2:15:30] and thy wife and her two sons with
[2:15:35] her so go quickly let's go toward the
[2:15:38] end now Jetro meets with
[2:15:43] Moses now listen verse
[2:15:46] 14
[2:15:49] Jetro was with his son-in-law Moses he
[2:15:53] saw what's going on with Moses with the
[2:15:55] people people coming before Moses from
[2:15:59] the morning through the evening a long
[2:16:02] line waiting to he from
[2:16:06] Moses verse 14 and when Moses
[2:16:09] father-in-law saw all that he did to the
[2:16:12] people he said what is this thing that
[2:16:15] thou
[2:16:16] doest
[2:16:18] to the people why sest thou thyself
[2:16:21] alone and all the people stand by thee
[2:16:24] from morning unto even why the people
[2:16:27] they came since the morning they stand
[2:16:28] by you since the morning
[2:16:31] until until the evening now here how
[2:16:36] Moses
[2:16:38] answers are you following
[2:16:41] me and Moses said unto his
[2:16:44] father-in-law listen because the people
[2:16:48] come unto me to inquire of
[2:16:54] God let me repeat that before because
[2:16:58] the people come unto me to inquire of
[2:17:01] God if they want God they come ask me
[2:17:04] what they must
[2:17:05] do can we say Amen remember there is a
[2:17:09] promise Malachi 4 remember Moses my
[2:17:15] servants what happened with Moses
[2:17:19] Moses told us when people they want to
[2:17:22] inquire for God they want some advice
[2:17:25] how to find God they come to meet the
[2:17:30] prophets when they have a matter they
[2:17:33] come unto
[2:17:35] me and I judge between one and another
[2:17:39] and I do make know them know the
[2:17:41] statutes of God and his
[2:17:44] laws I'm the one who tells them
[2:17:48] what God has said I have God's laws for
[2:17:53] them they have to listen to me that's
[2:17:56] why you see them they come to me since
[2:17:58] the morning un evening they come to
[2:18:02] listen what the Lord has
[2:18:04] said can we say
[2:18:06] amen I read a script scripture Jesus
[2:18:10] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:18:14] forever I told you God doesn't change
[2:18:17] his
[2:18:19] nature he can change his form what kind
[2:18:22] of men he's using in that age but he
[2:18:26] stays the
[2:18:27] same can we say amen
[2:18:32] amen in the message what a vision
[2:18:36] Vision I'm not comparing myself with a
[2:18:39] prophet no
[2:18:41] sir I'm just a poor sinner Saed by Grace
[2:18:47] but the gift that the lord gave the
[2:18:50] prophets and made them prophets they
[2:18:54] were God's mouth peace amen amen a
[2:18:59] prophet is God's mou
[2:19:03] peace when he's speaking God is speaking
[2:19:07] to you you receive what the prophet says
[2:19:10] you receive What God Says remember first
[2:19:14] Samuel chapter 8 God told Samu they are
[2:19:17] not rejecting
[2:19:19] you because you didn't go to them by
[2:19:22] yourself I'm the one who sent you they
[2:19:25] are rejecting me am when you see
[2:19:29] somebody he's rejecting the prophet he's
[2:19:32] rejecting
[2:19:34] God our
[2:19:37] radio something which is really
[2:19:41] good the prophet heard the word of the
[2:19:43] Lord and no Prophet ever did do anything
[2:19:47] just upon his own
[2:19:51] desire he if he did it first it was
[2:19:54] after God had taugh him amen can we say
[2:20:08] amen God keeps his
[2:20:13] word but because they failed to hear
[2:20:17] Moses
[2:20:18] you remember children of Israel all the
[2:20:21] time Moses why did you do this Moses why
[2:20:23] you did this Moses why you remember even
[2:20:26] one time he's the one who came with the
[2:20:30] law children of Israel your God said you
[2:20:34] cannot get
[2:20:35] married to another
[2:20:38] people you remember
[2:20:41] that it was a
[2:20:43] law on the next day God told him oh you
[2:20:46] need to take a wife not from the
[2:20:49] children of
[2:20:52] Israel we need to go to the nations take
[2:20:55] an
[2:20:57] Egyptian as your
[2:20:59] wife he could only
[2:21:03] obey he went and took
[2:21:06] zipora you remember in the Bible even
[2:21:09] his brother Aaron who was
[2:21:13] a a priest a minister
[2:21:19] amen he wasn't
[2:21:22] happy Miriam the big sister he thought I
[2:21:26] am your big sister I was born before you
[2:21:30] I'm the one who put you on the river so
[2:21:32] you won't
[2:21:33] die what happened you told us the Lord
[2:21:36] told you don't go outside to take a wife
[2:21:38] now you are you are breaking the law
[2:21:44] yourself was God
[2:21:46] happy
[2:21:47] was God
[2:21:49] happy God came down he told them don't
[2:21:52] you fear
[2:21:54] God there is no Prophet like Moses I
[2:21:57] speak to him mouth to
[2:22:01] ear I've never done it before why you
[2:22:04] didn't fear God because of that the lack
[2:22:08] of
[2:22:09] respect amen humanly speaking they were
[2:22:13] right isn't it humanly speaking
[2:22:17] Aaron and Miriam they were right but it
[2:22:22] wasn't right before God because God is
[2:22:25] the one who told Moses go out take a
[2:22:27] wife there because you represent Jesus
[2:22:31] Christ he will have a bride of Nations
[2:22:35] am you are a type of Christ they didn't
[2:22:38] see
[2:22:40] it they were leaning on their own
[2:22:43] understanding and that's how they got
[2:22:44] out of the will of God brother Bram say
[2:22:47] the message trying to do God the service
[2:22:49] there are five mon five mon to do God
[2:22:52] the
[2:22:53] service it must be according to the time
[2:22:56] in the
[2:22:58] season Accord with the person God has
[2:23:01] sent and that's the prophet if you do
[2:23:04] something which is outside of what the
[2:23:06] prophet told us you are out of the will
[2:23:09] of
[2:23:16] God
[2:23:18] let me follow I'll go quickly so we can
[2:23:23] finish Luke
[2:23:24] 7 verse 12 you can go down brother
[2:23:28] Matthew it's down
[2:23:33] there a Prophet is the grace of God Amen
[2:23:37] that's right when you see a prophet that
[2:23:39] means the grace of God Has Come to Us
[2:23:44] amen go through the entire Bible you
[2:23:46] will see see every time God sent Moses
[2:23:49] to Israel it was Grace for them they had
[2:23:53] light amen those who refused them they
[2:23:56] were under
[2:24:00] judgment Luke
[2:24:03] 712 it was the Lord Jesus
[2:24:06] Christ the prophet said he never
[2:24:08] attended a funeral
[2:24:11] service the Lord Jesus never attended a
[2:24:15] funeral service name me one in the Bible
[2:24:18] there is none every time you went to the
[2:24:21] funeral it was over it was the end of
[2:24:24] your
[2:24:27] funeral they made a
[2:24:29] mistake he was somewhere and they were
[2:24:32] going to bury
[2:24:34] somebody but they want to bring life and
[2:24:37] death together it doesn't
[2:24:41] work now when he came n to the gate of
[2:24:44] the
[2:24:45] city behold the was was the dead man
[2:24:48] carried out the only son of his
[2:24:51] mother and she was a widow and much
[2:24:54] people of the city was with
[2:24:57] her and when the Lord saw her he had
[2:25:01] compassion on her and said unto her weep
[2:25:07] not this is the good way you
[2:25:10] took don't
[2:25:12] weep what will happen Hallelujah and he
[2:25:16] came and touch the
[2:25:18] beer he didn't scream as we
[2:25:23] scream and that that bear him Stood
[2:25:27] Still or we are the presence of
[2:25:30] Life stand
[2:25:34] still and he said young man I say unto
[2:25:39] thee I who created Thee I say unto thee
[2:25:45] arise Lord and He that was dead sat up
[2:25:50] and began to
[2:25:53] speak and he delivered him to his
[2:25:57] mother now verse
[2:26:00] 16 and there came a fear or no why would
[2:26:04] you Fe when you meet with somebody who
[2:26:08] raising up your day why would you fear
[2:26:10] why you cannot Rejoice be excited thank
[2:26:14] God they had fear
[2:26:17] but and they glorify God saying that a
[2:26:22] great prophet is risen up among us and
[2:26:25] that God has visited his
[2:26:29] people when you see a prophet that means
[2:26:32] God has visited his
[2:26:37] people how would you reject God's
[2:26:43] visitation I don't
[2:26:45] understand
[2:26:50] let's go to Exodus chapter
[2:26:56] 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[2:26:59] father-in-law the priest of Nidia and he
[2:27:02] led the flock of the to The Backs side
[2:27:05] of the
[2:27:06] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[2:27:09] even to
[2:27:10] Horeb
[2:27:13] where which
[2:27:15] mountain
[2:27:17] hor remember the law of Moses which I
[2:27:22] have given him it's
[2:27:25] or that's the promise of Malachi
[2:27:29] 4 let's go back to
[2:27:32] hor what happened in horb I want to take
[2:27:36] my time so we can read the entire
[2:27:38] chapter and get into chapter 4 you will
[2:27:42] understand what Malachi 4 is
[2:27:45] about
[2:27:49] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[2:27:51] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[2:27:54] of a bush and he looked and
[2:27:57] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[2:28:00] Bush was not
[2:28:04] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[2:28:07] aside and see the great sight why the
[2:28:10] bush is not
[2:28:12] burned and when the Lord saw that he
[2:28:14] turned aside to see God called him
[2:28:17] out of the midst of the Bush Pillar of
[2:28:20] Fire somebody was in that Pillar of
[2:28:24] Fire now we'll start talking you just
[2:28:28] see a pill of fire on the head of
[2:28:31] brother but that's that's a person what
[2:28:34] is
[2:28:42] it shame on
[2:28:45] me ah
[2:28:47] thank
[2:28:48] you you see you need somebody to reveal
[2:28:52] you the truth you need somebody to show
[2:28:56] you the
[2:28:58] light especially in this
[2:29:01] time message Revelation book of symbols
[2:29:05] we only have symbols there so we need a
[2:29:08] prophet to give us the true
[2:29:11] interpretation this
[2:29:14] fire says as you see there it's a person
[2:29:19] that's why Bram called this picture it's
[2:29:21] not my picture it's the picture of the
[2:29:24] Angel of the Lord I was just standing
[2:29:26] there when they took the
[2:29:29] picture can we say
[2:29:37] Amen Moses said I'll turn aside verse
[2:29:40] three and see the great sight why the
[2:29:42] bush is not burn and when the Lord saw
[2:29:44] that he turned aside to see God
[2:29:47] called unto him out of the midst of the
[2:29:49] Bush God was speaking God the Bible says
[2:29:54] God the prophet thought that it was the
[2:29:56] pillar of fire amen it is
[2:30:01] God and said Moses Moses and he said
[2:30:04] here am I and he said draw not nigh he
[2:30:09] put off thy shoes for from off thy feet
[2:30:13] for the place where on thou standest is
[2:30:16] Holy
[2:30:17] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[2:30:22] thy father now he's revealing himself to
[2:30:26] Moses what means this Pillar of Fire I
[2:30:30] am the god of D father the god of
[2:30:34] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[2:30:38] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[2:30:42] afraid to look upon God Amen Moses will
[2:30:45] ask you I saw exactly what you saw in
[2:30:48] your
[2:30:50] time what did I
[2:30:52] said in my book of Exodus it was
[2:30:56] God how come you
[2:31:02] forgot verse seven and the Lord said I

[2:31:14] which is which are in Egypt and have
[2:31:17] heard their cry God hears the Cry of his

[2:42:39] what chapter 4 remember hor that's what
[2:42:44] Malachi said
[2:42:46] chapter
[2:42:49] 4 God is still talking to his prophets
[2:42:53] and Moses answered and
[2:42:56] said but behold they will not believe
[2:43:00] me nor hearken unto my voice for they
[2:43:03] will say the Lord had not appeared unto
[2:43:07] thee that's true they won't believe me
[2:43:12] how come I just go and tell them God met
[2:43:14] me and then they believe me they
[2:43:18] won't we need something
[2:43:21] more and the Lord said unto him what is
[2:43:24] in thine hand now God want to commission
[2:43:28] him more and he said
[2:43:31] AR you know brother said a rod means a
[2:43:35] Ministry can we say Amen a Ministry a
[2:43:39] rod and he said cast it on the ground

[2:43:52] a
[2:43:53] snake he fled God said hold on hold on

[2:44:05] forth thine hand and take it by the tear
[2:44:08] oh my
[2:44:10] goodness he fled just to see the snake

[2:44:52] hand amen from God this is God who
[2:44:56] speaking to me nobody can do this
[2:44:59] because you need to go through an
[2:45:01] experience you won't forget amen when
[2:45:04] you meet God the prophet said it's an
[2:45:06] experience you won't forget nobody can
[2:45:10] take you out of that we can have so many
[2:45:13] impersonators we we can have so many
[2:45:16] people criticizing the prophets but I
[2:45:18] know what experience I went through it
[2:45:22] won't touch me a
[2:45:27] bit and God told him that they may
[2:45:30] believe that the Lord God of their
[2:45:31] fathers the god of Abraham the god of
[2:45:33] Isaac and the god of Jacob had appeared
[2:45:36] unto thee and the Lord said further more
[2:45:39] unto him put now th hand into thy bosom

[2:46:28] Moses fasting with God why my hand has
[2:46:30] become leers like this why
[2:46:33] God and he put his hand into his bosom
[2:46:36] again and plaed it out of his bosom and
[2:46:39] behold it was T again as is all the
[2:46:42] flesh noral amen
[2:46:45] now the Lord told him and it shall come
[2:46:47] to pass if they will not believe the if
[2:46:50] they don't believe when you speak to
[2:46:52] them nether Heen unto the voice of the
[2:46:56] first sign when you see the prophet
[2:46:59] doing a sign something there is a voice
[2:47:03] that they will believe the voice of the
[2:47:05] L
[2:47:09] sign and it shall come to pass if they
[2:47:11] will not believe also those two signs
[2:47:16] brother Bram also had signs the first
[2:47:19] one what was it taking people by the
[2:47:24] hand and he will know what disease it
[2:47:27] was second sign he
[2:47:31] knew the thoughts in the mind of
[2:47:35] people the third one he was dealing now
[2:47:38] with the soul of the Bride the spoken
[2:47:43] word when on my way here in the plane I
[2:47:46] read a lot what historian says about the
[2:47:49] prophet oh it was
[2:47:51] amazing all of them
[2:47:53] recognize the Revival in the 20th
[2:47:56] century the initiator it was William
[2:48:01] Bram he did so many things he's the only
[2:48:04] evangelist who successfully run meetings
[2:48:08] in every
[2:48:09] continent in these last
[2:48:12] days they said he was not not after
[2:48:17] money he was very honest his managers
[2:48:22] took advantage of him his salary would
[2:48:25] be 7,000 a year his manager would get
[2:48:33] 80,000 he had a very
[2:48:37] stet cord of
[2:48:40] moral very
[2:48:42] strict he didn't like corruption in the
[2:48:45] church today we let down the
[2:48:48] bars amen the Sheep go out and God's
[2:48:52] come
[2:48:54] in he really he really
[2:48:58] lived
[2:49:07] Holiness first
[2:49:11] n if and it shall come to pass if they
[2:49:14] will not not believe also these two
[2:49:18] signs nether to divorce that thou shall
[2:49:21] take of the water of the river now the
[2:49:24] third sign and put it upon the dry land
[2:49:27] and the water which thou thou Tak out of
[2:49:31] the river shall become blood upon the
[2:49:33] dry
[2:49:35] land and Moses said down to the Lord oh
[2:49:39] my Lord oh my Lord I'm
[2:49:43] not
[2:49:46] eloquence neither here to for nor since
[2:49:50] thou spoken unto thy servants but I'm
[2:49:53] slow of speech and of a slow
[2:49:58] tongue he could not speak well now he
[2:50:01] takes it as an excuse listen what God
[2:50:04] will
[2:50:05] tell remember Malachi
[2:50:08] 4 the Lord said by the prophet Malachi 4
[2:50:13] remember my Lord which I gave in horor
[2:50:17] with Moses
[2:50:19] behold I will send unto you Elijah the
[2:50:23] prophets now listen God is training His
[2:50:26] prophets and the Lord said unto him
[2:50:29] Moses you tell me you cannot speak
[2:50:32] well who had made men's
[2:50:36] mouth or who make the DB or
[2:50:41] death or the seeing or the blunt have I
[2:50:44] not I the
[2:50:45] Lord now therefore go and I will be with
[2:50:51] thy mouth

[2:50:59] something which is wrong because I'll
[2:51:01] will be with your mouth
[2:51:06] am and teach thee what that shall say
[2:51:10] your teaching it will be my teaching the
[2:51:15] only thing I will do is put my words in
[2:51:18] your mouth you'll be there just as a
[2:51:21] mouthpiece because I'm the one who's
[2:51:23] going down there to deliver them just

[2:51:41] thee by the hand of him whom thou will
[2:51:43] send
[2:51:45] no Lord if even though you'll take care
[2:51:48] of my mouth no don't send
[2:51:50] me the prophet said that's attitude of a
[2:51:54] true man that has been called by God
[2:51:57] when you see somebody I want to do it I
[2:51:59] want to do it sometimes the prophet said
[2:52:00] no they can't do
[2:52:03] it
[2:52:08] amen verse 14 and the anger of the Lord
[2:52:11] was kindled against Moses and he said
[2:52:14] said is not Aaron the levite thy brother
[2:52:18] now listen what's a
[2:52:22] levite a levite was
[2:52:24] his a priest in the Old Testament amen
[2:52:28] am in the New Testament brother Bram
[2:52:30] said these are ministers am the fivefold
[2:52:34] minister Moses you cannot speak that
[2:52:37] true but don't you have a brother who is
[2:52:40] a Le levite don't you have the fivefold
[2:52:43] ministry in the the body of
[2:52:48] Christ brother he's the same yesterday
[2:52:51] today and
[2:52:54] forever he hasn't changed I tell people
[2:52:57] we need to go back to the teaching of
[2:52:59] the Bible That's where brother Bram
[2:53:02] brought us
[2:53:06] back and the anger of the Lord was
[2:53:08] kindled against Moses and he said is not
[2:53:12] Aaron the Le levite thy brother
[2:53:15] I know that he can speak
[2:53:19] well the levite will speak
[2:53:22] well the priest the minister that I have
[2:53:26] anointed I have called they will speak
[2:53:30] well don't worry
[2:53:34] Moses
[2:53:37] Hallelujah and also behold he cometh
[2:53:41] forth to meet thee he's coming to see
[2:53:43] you because
[2:53:45] Aon you we meet the Lord when we go to
[2:53:48] the prophet amen can we say
[2:53:51] Amen behold he come for to meet thee and
[2:53:55] when he see thee when he sees you he
[2:53:58] will be glad in his
[2:54:00] heart I ask myself I ask my brothers the
[2:54:04] ministers brother when Aaron saw the
[2:54:08] prophet he rejoiced in his heart the
[2:54:10] Bible said he was glad to see the
[2:54:13] prophet how come you are a minister of
[2:54:16] God you are a levite called of God and
[2:54:19] you hate the
[2:54:21] prophets who called you that's not the
[2:54:24] Bible my Bible said when the levit saw
[2:54:27] the prophet he was glad in his heart and
[2:54:31] I'm glad when I when I know that I'm
[2:54:34] behind the prophet amen what kind of
[2:54:37] ministers are
[2:54:41] you now verse
[2:54:43] 15
[2:54:45] and thou shalt speak unto him now since
[2:54:49] you cannot speak before people this is
[2:54:51] now what I'm telling you here in
[2:54:54] Horeb from now on this is the law you my
[2:55:00] Prophets You shall speak unto Aaron the
[2:55:04] levite the levite need to listen to you
[2:55:08] can we say

[2:55:15] mouth my prophets I speak to you in your
[2:55:19] tongue you take the words you put in the
[2:55:23] mouth of the Levites of the priest and
[2:55:27] I'll be with thy mouth the mouth of the
[2:55:29] prophets and with his mouth the mouth of
[2:55:33] the Levites now God is paying attention
[2:55:36] to two
[2:55:38] mouths amen the mouth of the prophet and
[2:55:41] the mouth of a true servant of God
[2:55:46] amen when I see people today people say
[2:55:50] we don't need
[2:55:52] ministers we don't need
[2:55:55] pastors I tell them you don't believe
[2:55:58] your
[2:55:59] Bible this is the
[2:56:03] blueprints that's what Malachi said
[2:56:06] remember in hor what
[2:56:09] happened go back
[2:56:12] there I saw the Prophet there and the
[2:56:15] Levites God telling the prophet take
[2:56:18] your words put them in his mouth I'll be
[2:56:23] with your mouth and I'll be with his
[2:56:26] mouth as long as I'm repeating what the
[2:56:29] prophet said God is paying attention to
[2:56:32] my mouth
[2:56:37] amen and I will teach you what you shall
[2:56:43] do
[2:56:44] now listen verse
[2:56:46] 16 and he shall be the spok man unto the
[2:56:51] people he'll be
[2:56:55] what he will be thy Spoken Man spok man
[2:57:00] unto the people it means Aaron will come
[2:57:05] oh this is what the Lord said to
[2:57:09] Moses Moses told me to tell you in the
[2:57:13] message Genesis chapter 1 or chap second
[2:57:17] chapter what happened there it wasn't a
[2:57:20] fruit the
[2:57:22] Earth this is what happened this is what
[2:57:24] happened this is what happened and when
[2:57:27] they believed it the whole congregation
[2:57:30] was blessed you remember one time he
[2:57:33] sent
[2:57:34] ministers to
[2:57:37] go
[2:57:39] as as
[2:57:41] a spies or as
[2:57:46] what when they went as
[2:57:51] come
[2:57:53] huh
[2:57:54] spies they went he sent
[2:57:58] 12 one from each tribe there were Chiefs
[2:58:02] of tribes there were ministers they went
[2:58:05] there they came back because they didn't
[2:58:09] repeat what the prophet said it brought
[2:58:12] trouble in the assembly in the church
[2:58:16] except for two
[2:58:18] people Joshua and
[2:58:21] Caleb they calm down the people we are
[2:58:24] more than
[2:58:26] conquerors who is with you is greater
[2:58:29] than the one who is in the
[2:58:31] world
[2:58:34] Amen he shall be the Spoken Man unto the
[2:58:37] people and he shall be even he shall be
[2:58:41] to thee instead of a mouth the levite
[2:58:45] the minister will be your mouth my
[2:58:47] prophet and that shall be to him instead
[2:58:50] of God because the prophet that the God
[2:58:53] we listen to not the God We Adore we
[2:58:57] worship no the God we listen to because
[2:59:01] it's God speaking to him I read you the
[2:59:04] quotation prophets were M pieces of God
[2:59:09] am I'm about to
[2:59:12] close
[2:59:15] that's such a wonderful group of
[2:59:19] people I have prepared I don't know how
[2:59:22] many pages
[2:59:26] but speak to this
[2:59:31] mountain I'm landing
[2:59:33] slowly you
[2:59:35] know when you land first you have been
[2:59:40] in PLS right is it good is it good you
[2:59:44] see sometimes you go like this oh my so
[2:59:49] you need to go
[2:59:50] slowly you go slowly until you Lear so
[2:59:53] I'm learning slowly forgive
[2:59:56] me speak to this
[2:59:59] mountain it's a very powerful message
[3:00:02] but the BR I'm delivered in California
[3:00:05] he was thinking about Mark 11 if you say
[3:00:09] to this
[3:00:12] mountain be
[3:00:14] moved it shall happen unto you he said I
[3:00:19] was not understanding that's why I could
[3:00:20] not preach on
[3:00:22] it amen but today you see a minister he
[3:00:26] doesn't understand something he comes
[3:00:27] before you he start talking to you they
[3:00:31] ask him questions he doesn't know what
[3:00:32] he was talking
[3:00:35] about the prophet says
[3:00:39] this as Justice are scooted down to kind
[3:00:43] of get get myself warm he was hunting
[3:00:47] that's where the squarrels were created
[3:00:49] now he is telling us the story that
[3:00:52] scripture came to me
[3:00:54] again whatso you say believe that what
[3:00:58] you say shall come to pass and you can
[3:01:00] have what you
[3:01:02] say well I thought why does that
[3:01:06] scripture keep coming to me when I can
[3:01:08] preach on
[3:01:10] it because I don't know nothing about
[3:01:15] it do you hear what the prophet says I
[3:01:18] didn't know nothing about it so I cannot
[3:01:20] preach on
[3:01:22] it I could not go before a congregation
[3:01:26] and try to explain that scripture well I
[3:01:28] sat there a little bit I thought there
[3:01:31] is only one thing to it now the prophet
[3:01:34] start thinking of
[3:01:36] himself by himself I'll say Jesus told
[3:01:40] that to the disciples and gave them the
[3:01:43] that
[3:01:44] Authority that was about a year and 6
[3:01:48] months before the atonement was
[3:01:51] made so if it wasn't in the atonement it
[3:01:55] was the other side of the atonement so
[3:01:58] if anybody ever ask me that question
[3:02:02] I'll just tell them that it was the
[3:02:04] other side of the atonement it's the
[3:02:07] only thing I know now the prophet he
[3:02:10] start thinking by himself if they ask me
[3:02:13] a question this is how I'm going to
[3:02:15] answer he
[3:02:18] forget that he's a
[3:02:20] prophet a prophet don't say things by
[3:02:23] themselves amen now let's go what the
[3:02:26] Lord will tell
[3:02:28] him because Jesus was still a living the
[3:02:32] atonement was not made and he was not
[3:02:34] wounded for our transgressions no by his
[3:02:37] stripes we were were we healed yet so he
[3:02:41] just gave them that power or the side of
[3:02:44] the
[3:02:46] atonement what's going
[3:02:49] on 36 and then all of a sudden as he was
[3:02:55] thinking if they ask me this is what I'm
[3:02:58] going to do this is what I'm going to
[3:02:59] tell them something spoke to me and
[3:03:04] said what about the prophets can we say
[3:03:10] Amen what about the prophets
[3:03:14] well I began to see that it began to
[3:03:18] unfold to me the voice said what do you
[3:03:22] think that takes place in the meeting
[3:03:25] when you are standing there when you are
[3:03:28] before the people what's going on do you
[3:03:31] think you are the one who knows those
[3:03:34] people so today you can start thinking
[3:03:37] how you going to answer to them do you
[3:03:40] think you are the one who knows those
[3:03:45] people do you think that it's you that
[3:03:48] can predict and say to those people that
[3:03:51] you are going to do a certain certain
[3:03:53] thing and a certain certain thing that
[3:03:55] has happened to you and a certain
[3:03:57] certain thing will happen to you do you
[3:04:00] think that's you saying
[3:04:05] it at the Judgment bar he will ask you
[3:04:08] the same
[3:04:10] question brother Bram say oh my
[3:04:14] it means so
[3:04:16] much it's never left
[3:04:20] me and I thought surely Lord surely not
[3:04:25] lord it's you it's not me who knows
[3:04:29] those people
[3:04:31] amen
[3:04:33] well then the Lord asked him again do
[3:04:36] you think it's you
[3:04:40] talking Church do you think it's a
[3:04:44] prophet
[3:04:46] talking do you think it's brother Bram
[3:04:49] talking the Lord is asking him when you
[3:04:51] are before people the one who's talking
[3:04:55] do you think it's you
[3:04:57] talking no he answers no do you think it
[3:05:02] was the prophets
[3:05:04] talking have not you just got through
[3:05:07] preaching on the subject that the
[3:05:09] prophet was so Anointed with the holy
[3:05:12] spirit that it was wasn't them that done
[3:05:15] the speaking it was the Holy spir Spirit
[3:05:18] in them crying out you just p on
[3:05:22] it then whatever you
[3:05:25] say if you are anointed W be you saying
[3:05:30] it it would be the Holy Spirit saying
[3:05:35] it a prophet like Moses amen it won't be
[3:05:40] your it's not you how would you know I
[3:05:44] can see you or I see you in a red

[3:06:17] physician I can hear the physician
[3:06:20] examining

[3:06:31] do or I see he even refer you to another
[3:06:35] physician that one he's
[3:06:38] younger than the previous one he looks
[3:06:42] at you oh I see he performs an operation
[3:06:45] on
[3:06:46] you and it seems they left something in

[3:07:52] great price
[3:07:56] amen no age has seen what we have
[3:08:01] seen name me one one time brother BR was
[3:08:05] trying to flee from
[3:08:07] us he tells the story in the message
[3:08:10] standing in the
[3:08:12] gap
[3:08:13] he wanted to leave that the prophets of
[3:08:16] O stay in the mountains come down when
[3:08:19] he had that serve the Lord tell the
[3:08:21] people and go back God told him no these
[3:08:25] were prophets of the Old Testament you
[3:08:27] have more
[3:08:29] gifts than all of them
[3:08:32] since Adam or EA up to date you have
[3:08:38] more gifts you have a great
[3:08:42] ministry
[3:08:43] if you go up there your wife he would
[3:08:47] leave
[3:08:50] you do you know the prophet said Jesus
[3:08:53] had more success in his ministry in
[3:08:56] brother BR Ministry than he had in his
[3:08:59] own
[3:09:00] Ministry he that many
[3:09:07] dead then he did his in his own Ministry

[3:09:25] double he said he had more success in
[3:09:29] Jefferson than he did in his entire
[3:09:31] ministry here on
[3:09:33] Earth who's
[3:09:39] talking and the prophet said that's
[3:09:41] right if a person through the
[3:09:45] atonements Sanctified by the blood of
[3:09:48] Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with
[3:09:52] God so close that he can be wrapped so
[3:09:56] complet in God by the blood of Jesus
[3:09:59] that it wouldn't be him talking it would
[3:10:02] be the Holy Spirit speaking these
[3:10:05] things it's because the blood of Jesus
[3:10:08] Christ now God can come back and live in
[3:10:11] US

[3:12:53] book just the prayers of the Prophet
[3:12:55] I'll mark them down in my notebooks and

[3:17:36] Almighty would give me the
[3:17:39] ministry he has got around this
[3:17:43] the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had
[3:17:46] do you think God our Father Almighty he
[3:17:50] will give me the same Ministry that
[3:17:53] Jesus
[3:17:55] had with Supernatural signs and things
[3:17:59] which has never been seen since the New
[3:18:03] Testament God gives me such a Ministry

[3:23:06] above all the men which were upon the
[3:23:08] face of the Earth Moses was more Meek
[3:23:11] than any of them
[3:23:12] anything God's looking for in The Bride
[3:23:14] is humility and meekness amen and he
[3:23:17] said hear now my
[3:23:19] words if there be a prophet among you I
[3:23:23] the Lord will make myself known unto him
[3:23:25] in a vision and will speak unto him in a
[3:23:28] dream amen this is what our brother was
[3:23:31] bringing out the significance of the
[3:23:34] ministry of a prophet and brother

[3:23:42] amen God had promised God had used
[3:23:45] prophets to the in the among the
[3:23:46] Gentiles and promised for the last day
[3:23:49] in Malachai 4 to turn as he did to John
[3:23:53] John the Baptist he was turning the
[3:23:55] hearts of the the Old Testament fathers
[3:23:58] to the Pentecostal children amen but
[3:24:02] they said I was send you another Elijah
[3:24:05] and he said turn the hearts of the
[3:24:06] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[3:24:10] amen and brother that's what God has
[3:24:12] been doing what God is doing Amen to
[3:24:16] give us to give us the Revelation that

[3:24:37] redeem our souls he has come the second
[3:24:39] time the Omega to redeem our bodies amen
[3:24:43] this is tremendous the promise the plans
[3:24:46] and the purpose of God the pattern of
[3:24:48] God see the word doesn't change it's an
[3:24:51] absolute plan it's not it's not just
[3:24:54] something dropped in here and then you
[3:24:56] dropped something else there something
[3:24:57] else there everything everything is in
[3:24:59] order amen the whole truth as he said
[3:25:02] the whole truth nothing but the truth we
[3:25:04] believe it because we got to believe it
[3:25:05] all because we got to look at it all to
[3:25:08] see the to see the whole plan of God and
[3:25:10] the whole purpose of God and the whole
[3:25:12] pattern of God but thank God for the
[3:25:15] prophet that highlighted these things in
[3:25:17] this last day amen there it wasn't
[3:25:21] highlighted in the in in the in the
[3:25:23] previous Church ages at all they they
[3:25:25] just highlighted this just this just
[3:25:27] this right there but not the overall
[3:25:30] plan but when we come to the end we need
[3:25:32] to we need the revelation of the plan we
[3:25:34] need the revelation of the purpose of
[3:25:36] God to know that we're at the end we
[3:25:39] need the revelation of the pattern of
[3:25:41] God to know we're at the end this is how
[3:25:43] God this is what God was wants this is
[3:25:46] this is his purpose this is how he's how
[3:25:48] he's doing it and how and I done it amen
[3:25:51] Amazing Grace brother thank God it is
[3:25:54] Grace Grace Grace Grace it is wonderful
[3:25:58] and so thank God for the ministry of the
[3:26:00] word concerning God and His prophets so
[3:26:03] let's pay attention to the to the to the
[3:26:06] word that God speaks through his
[3:26:08] servants and tell that remember this too
[3:26:11] as the prophet of God has said he said
[3:26:13] this is the Judgment seat he said over
[3:26:16] the going the word is going over the
[3:26:18] altar he said the Judgment seat and so
[3:26:21] on and he God is judging you by the word
[3:26:24] God has judged us today by his word God
[3:26:27] is what for God is looking for our
[3:26:29] response to that word not necessarily a
[3:26:32] verbal response response yes sometimes
[3:26:36] but he's looking for your Holy Ghost
[3:26:38] response in your soul amen what is your
[3:26:40] attitude toward what you have heard
[3:26:42] today in your soul amen by the grace of
[3:26:46] almighty God praise the name of the Lord
[3:26:49] that we receive it not in our heads but
[3:26:51] in our hearts amen where's where's faith
[3:26:55] faith is on the inside of the inside but
[3:26:57] that's where that's where we got to have
[3:26:59] it to experience the resurrection to
[3:27:02] experience the Rapture because the
[3:27:04] prophet of God did say he said you can
[3:27:06] be healed and go to hell he said it's
[3:27:09] because it's just a natural thing a
[3:27:10] physical thing you're believing in your
[3:27:12] head and and many times that's why they
[3:27:15] only sought the prophet was the signs
[3:27:16] and wonders many times they came to
[3:27:19] Jesus not for the word but they came for
[3:27:22] the signs and the Wonders he said you
[3:27:24] gave what Jesus went they said why did
[3:27:26] you come he you came he said because you
[3:27:27] ate of the Loaves and were filled
[3:27:30] because it was a miracle and they wanted
[3:27:32] wanted Jesus to do it again amen well
[3:27:35] brother as the Propet of God said I
[3:27:38] believe I mentioned last service again
[3:27:41] he said
[3:27:42] Lord he said they're calling me in the
[3:27:44] hotel there he said they want to come to
[3:27:46] see me is they want to come he said they
[3:27:48] want to see me or you they want to see
[3:27:51] William brandom but just because of the
[3:27:54] gift that he had we got to look beyond
[3:27:56] the gift and see God as he said it's not
[3:28:00] hearing William brandom it's not hearing
[3:28:02] Moses it's hearing God Amen it's the
[3:28:05] voice of God and sometimes God hidden in
[3:28:08] reveal in Simplicity oh my brother
[3:28:10] sister you'll speak TR through this
[3:28:12] brother sometimes he'll speak through a
[3:28:14] sister whatever you know sometimes he
[3:28:17] might be speaking to you through a child
[3:28:19] amen but God give us Grace to recognize
[3:28:21] it that's why we got to walk in the
[3:28:24] spirit live in the spirit walk in the
[3:28:26] light live in the light so that we're
[3:28:28] going to recognize God Amen recognize
[3:28:31] the revelation of the
[3:28:33] word so he said hear now my words if
[3:28:38] there be a prophet among you I the Lord
[3:28:40] will make make myself known unto him in
[3:28:42] a vision and will speak unto him in a
[3:28:45] dream amen and if there's anything
[3:28:49] that that a prophet is is is
[3:28:52] humble as Moses was Meek above all men
[3:28:57] that were upon the face of the Earth and
[3:29:00] as was
[3:29:02] testified by a Roman Catholic bishop
[3:29:04] when William Ram was taken off the scene
[3:29:07] he said it is any man that he that you
[3:29:09] would meet that had love he said with
[3:29:12] William Brandon he said you just had to
[3:29:15] talk to him and you knew it oh yes you
[3:29:18] knew that spirit that he had that
[3:29:19] anointing that was on him and brother
[3:29:21] sister again our brother brought out
[3:29:23] that you discern a brother Spirit a
[3:29:25] sister Spirit just by talking to them
[3:29:27] just for what sometimes they'll say
[3:29:29] something you know whether it's God or
[3:29:31] not amen and whether it's out of their
[3:29:34] heart
[3:29:35] soul but not their minds but there's got
[3:29:38] to be holy ghost in your soul amen as
[3:29:42] the prophet said that you can do it in
[3:29:44] your head repent you can be baptized
[3:29:48] just intellectually going going by the
[3:29:50] letter of the word and he said but he
[3:29:53] said not spiritually no no he said
[3:29:56] because what is it he said that's just
[3:29:57] dead
[3:29:58] Works he said if it's but if it comes
[3:30:00] out of your soul he said that's the
[3:30:03] living work the Living Word of the
[3:30:05] Living God but I pray that your your
[3:30:08] repentance was not a dead work I pray
[3:30:10] your water baptism was not a dead work
[3:30:13] amen but was the Living Word of the
[3:30:15] Living God coming to pass in your life
[3:30:18] what is it it's
[3:30:19] Redemption amen praise the Lord not
[3:30:23] Church going Redemption not religion
