[Applause] amen praise the Lord thank you God for grace amen absolutely without the grace of God we there be no hope for any of us in this world we're not living in Luther's age Wesley or the Pentecostal my brother worked further down the road a man and when we consider the world that the Scriptures tell us that we're going to be living in brothers serious oh it is serious we need grace when the Bible says this is going to be in the last day this and this and this brother we need the grace of God to give us his wisdom and his leadership and we'll get into some of that again this morning as we go into the message on God the God of this evil age a man we're gonna find out who that God is and how we worship meet him are we worshiping Genesis 1:1 or we worshiping the God of these last days so god help us brother because after it is it's gonna be so close to deceive the very elect so god help us so the Lord bless you also to announce that our brother handle Glover will be here June the 2nd to June the 4th he will be in Bishop Falls that with that previous weekend and also to let you know that I understand for brother Don he called and that brother Andrews wife will be with him so I'd be brother and who clover and his wife in Grand Falls and brother Angelo his wife here and Saint John's and the Lord willing we'll get him to minister Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday because we were assuming maybe that weekend but he has some ministry in Fredericton the weekend amen so he's going from the Grand Falls to here from here to to brother cars assembly in tributon so God's grace to to us brother in the ministry of our brother Andrew Grover Amen that we heard on Wednesday night so Lord the Lord bless him and the Lord bless us and also brother dawn did it advised me that when brother Glover comes here to st. John's that the Lord willing you'll be coming in as well him and sister Donna and maybe there are still other Saints out there in central that will also come to hear our brothers ministry and it'll be a blessing to all of us grace of God and also to remind you that I think was sweaty that I heard from another brother concerning the scam on my email and so on so the brother was in Frederick 90 Fredersen but rather in British Columbia brother Stuart Cummings and it's been a long time since we've had any communication and if the last time was when brother Harry Green passed away but we've been in fellowship in contact with our brother Stuart for many years and his life is a testimony of the grace of God for sure amen because he went awry he went around Canada around America looking for truth yeah he was he was a worldly man and into worldly things and I can't remember how other believer Chad there he would identify with it for sure because there any what our brother Chad was involved with I could see what I brother Stewart was also involved with a man but something happened to him and God began to deal with him and he went he went all over Canada as it were all over the United States he said brother Esau I was looking for the truth looking for what was right hey man I had to finally when he got back into Canada and he found a message Church always said I found the truth amen so it was the grace of God in his life so we pray god bless our brother Stewart and and his wife in British Columbia and of course brother Don and brothers do it all so they all sense greetings to the Saints here so God's God's grace to us amen so the Lord blesses this saying that saying only believe all things are possible only believe as we go to the word please be in prayer in your heart for the going foot of the word and let's be in prayer for the rossini of the word because there's some tremendous the prophet of God as I lighted in this in this message on the god of this evil age and Satan see so I pray grace brother that we're going to have the revelation I just at the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve but we're going to have the revelation of Satan seen a man and that we're not going to be deceived and so the lord help us brother but again you got to be on your guard on your toes because again the two are going to be so close it would just see the very leg and understand this to the god of this evil age he knows the word and he'll quote the word and he'll quote the message and so on but again whether what is his motive what is his objective God is doing it to increase our faith the devil is going to do it in such a way as to decrease our faith so I pray the grace of God whether that we're going to be found serving the god of creation not the god of this evil age a male so grace to us saying only believe all things are possible only be [Music] all things yes sir possible only being a man believe us though this let's believe God this really Bella we

[Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Applause] because Jesus is here again Emily father help us to believe with that complete belief where there are no questions and there are no doubts but we believe God that we believe that the god of creation we believe Lord the self existing one so we pray the grace of God to be with us help us to believe more and more and more to believe again with a complete belief Lord not just early in our minds not just in our senses not enough flesh my lord in our souls that we believe God that we believe that Jesus is here that we are believing father for the resurrection and for the rapture that we are believing Lord for the greater a greater and greater change in our lives father going from time to eternity Alleluia going from the natural to the spiritual so the grace of God be with us Lord in the going forth of your word the grace of God be with us Lord in the hearing of the word and the grace of God be with us Lord in understanding the word father we're gonna catch the revelation we're gonna catch lore the understanding of what your servant Lord is endeavoring to get to us Martinus and again it is not brother branham we believe it is God Lord that you anointed him to minister concerning these things how do you to put us on our guard to keep us on our toes to make our calling and our election Shore by the grace of Almighty God so Lord we pray for that anointing in our hearts that anointing in our souls that anointing Lord to receive the word and then anointing to believe the word with understanding I love you to be our guy were not deceived no Lord but we're walking in the light Alleluia and Lord that by the grace of God that we become the light of God in this world praise the name of the Lord so lord I pray in the name of Jesus

trusting my grace Lord that were not numbered with them the Lord would number with those other that are not deceived amen those that are truly honestly sincerity walking in the light amen in the light not of your revealed word Christ in and revealed in asana so the grace of God father's we commit all things into your aunt's forgive us of our sin the Lord answer our brother David's prayer O Lord

alive forevermore and you're living in us thank you Jesus amen today man praise the name of the Lord I see now I believe [Music] all things are possible now [Music] yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen praise the Lord turn with me to the book of Genesis chapter 1 amen Genesis chapter 1 well I'm gonna say try not to be too long with it that'd be difficult for me a man so you be in prayer but again considering the the forecast news well I said before the Lord willing God what the weather will be forbidding a man so we've committed into the hands of the Lord and the grace of God so this will be in prayer as we get into these thoughts concerning the god of this evil Ayse it is tremendous and in Genesis 1 and beginning to read at verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth amen and it's Elohim the self-existing one that created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters praise the Lord and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen it's the god of creation it's the self existing one it is not certainly not the God of this evil age and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day a man God blesses words you may be seated turn with me to galatians chapter 1 and these are the scriptures that the problem was using in the message on the god of this evil age he has made reverence to even to Genesis but he's highlighting the god of this evil age we're in that we had been warned in the scriptures concerning him we have been warned in the scriptures concerning is this a man so grace that were serving and were worshipping the god of creation not the god of this evil age well yet there are many that are worshipping the god of this evil age thinking they're worshiping the god of creation because as he deceived Eve he's also deceiving believers even in this hour and in this age so that God help us that we're going to stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth not add to it not take from it we're gonna we're gonna believe it and amen and by the grace of God yield to it and live it amen brother - there's this is this is the proof that it's going to be lived in your life amen and it's going to wreak and bring us into a total separation from the world and the things of the world amen you're just going not going to do anything to prove please the world not doing anything to please even worldly family or friends or neighbors no no you're gonna do that which pleases God a man but the devil is there to get us to compromise and he is indeed he is the God of this evil age it is not Jesus it is not Elohim because there is so little concerning God today there is so little that we know about Jesus today there's so little even even in the so-called denominational churches internet nomination 'el and non-denominational churches there's so little emphases that are put this put on God they're putting the emphasis on themselves they're putting the emphasis on what they want to do they're putting the aims in what's going on in the world but not on God and what he has promised amen because there was an hour when in Delisle Luther they put the emphasis on the word they put the emphasis on the wording Wesley and in the early Pentecostal church but brother I tell you they're not putting the emphasis on the word today that they did back then a man but by there's going to be a very very very few that are going to keep putting the emphasis on the word the word that then the whole truth and nothing but the truth so god help us that we're not going to be deceived by the god of this evil age that we're not as he was the seat and brother what did it would he get a quote he quoted the word equal to God amen accorded a quarter quarter jehovah elohim the self existing one yay and God said and brother and he's deceiving the world today with an especially believers with the same thing yay and God said through William Branham yes God said in his word jazz God said but a man and there's true many but preachers a man and then you know we know as our brother for sure brought it out he said when it comes to buts he said the only one the butts he said it is the goats a man so he said as to many are our sheep how many are lambs or how many are just playing goats brother I pray the Grace and listen what did he use the goats for the goat was used to lead to lead the Sheep of up into the the path ear to be slaughtered and when the pole goat got up on the top he moved away and the sheep went on in and they were slaughtered that's right so brother sister I pray the grace of God that we're following Elohim we're now following the god of this evil age the devil and remember it's going to be so close to seed the very elect if possible if you're elect you want me to see if you're electing you're gonna be on your guard if you're relaxed you're gonna know that oh what influenced me to do this what influenced me to say that oh you you know that it's the devil that is not God amen not Elohim and again it is a god but not the God of creation in the beginning God the self-existing one created the heavens and the earth a man but this is not the God that we're going to preach on and Minister on in in this series on the god of this evil age and it is absolutely tremendous the the some of the things that the prophet of God is bringing out and I'll had to be honest brother it is it is very hard and it's very challenging a man to our faith and many things of the prophet Isaiah saying we we were considered to be hard and blunt amen and he is right and he is blunt but he said I feel he said that you have need of this you need to have this revelation need to have this understanding if not we're gonna really be deceived a man because the devil is gonna be there and he's gonna he's gonna act like God talk like God a man and he'll quote the word the message and so on so brother I pray the grace of God that as a result of this this message and the series that we're doing on it we're going to understand what's going on we're gonna understand what we're dealing with we're gonna understand brother sister and a man the spirits that are working in this world today and the one that's got the pre evidence is not God Elohim it is the devil a man oh yeah and then and it is religious and oh yeah and he quoting the message quoting the scriptures amen but still it is the god of this evil age it is the god of this world and brother is not only William Branham and God through the prophet warning us concerning these things in the last days brother we find that their warning to the Christians even in the first church age a man that Satan becomes the god of this world a man he was the God he was a God here in the first stage a brother he was a guy he was a God in the Garden of Eden a man because Satan Eve recognized him and listened to him instead of staying with the word a man oh yes she had the word but he she let the devil add to the word a man why for all for the sake of the flesh it was real pleasing it was good for food it was good for this it was good for that yeah but was it good for your soul a man was there was an increase in your faith or decreasing your faith well that's that is the question so I pray the grace of God to help us brothers sisters to seriously consider the hard things that the Prophet is bringing out a man and brother and again he's not preaching that out there he's preaching that in his own church because why because he was no doubt dealing with those spirits even in his own church a man as I have violated before on certain messages that we have considered that the Prophet was ministering to his own church and knowing that as I just recently said he highlighted Weiland Branham Tabernacle with what to and he told them and he said he said you are he said you're in the message but he said the message is not in you yeah and brother what we say today because even even before the Lord called him home he said now he said I know he said isn't the message is not striking you the way that it should he said because he does not even striking me he said the way that it should a man because why because he wasn't meant for that hour but is meant for this hour and for this age if there's ever an hour to time that we needed the Lord to strike us with the word is this hour why so that will not be deceived a man and that we need the Lord to be there with us to encourage us to to give us wisdom to give us understanding hey buddy so that we're not going to see what the devil is saying and what the devil is doing amen but I tell you this there's many a believer there that's deceived and a that's the absolute truth and just talking about again there concerning the the the foolish virgins brother they went on a day or they were doing the father god I need to know understand he said they're virgins but are not wise virgins amen then it read the wisdom of the word like the wise words are did a man sweeter they're like Eve in the garden she's deceived so brother I trust were not the foolish virgins were the wise a man and there are a lot of believers that are just got the foolish virgin anointing on them and it's the deceit of the devil making them believe they're in the message but the message not in them a man it is in their heads but not in their hearts and brother we need to get this word we need to get this revelation in our hearts it is to give a speak amen it's got to be even if a comes out of the heart brother when it comes to hey if you got the word you got the word and you don't have the faith it's in your head but not in your heart because if the word is in your heart it gives faith and only that it gives the faith that pleases God amen so you can have faith but it's not pleasing to God well how come is not pleasing to God is faith because it's not for this hour for this age for what God is requiring in this hour what God is recording that we can have the faith of a previous age but God is not into that God is into this amen God is into into the into the end God is into the revelation of the resurrect the rapture God is into the revelation of the second coming of the Lord for his bride he came to Redeemer he has come together and to take her home to a marriage supper a man so do we believe that he is here brother I pray grace that we're believing Elohim that we are serving hello him we are worshiping hello him we're not worshiping the devil oh yeah so make sure all brother we found the anointing in the service this morning the anointing in the worship this morning then only in the singing of the song as I make sure you're worshiping God make sure that you under your under God's anointing not the devil's an ID amen and again this way we're warned so close to seed the very lake and thank God he's going to shorten time amen I trust this for my sake and for your sake that he's going to shorten time that we be not deceived god help us brother as we go into the word and god help us to receive what the prophet is saying not and again not to just put it off to somebody over there we're going to apply it to our own hearts play to our own lives hey man now I think I'm a believer so the prophet of God they all he's not saying that about me oh he's talking about those out there in the world no he's talking to believers yeah what the believers under guard so they'll know what's going on they'll be aware of what's going on and they'll get the faith to overcome it but grace to his brother I tell you it's serious it's serious in Galatians chapter one and verse one and again this is one of the Texas that the public got used in 1965 when he preached concerning the god of this evil age and in verse 1 he said appalled and apostille not of men neither by man but he said but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me and onto the churches of Galatia grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world it was an evil world ed it's an evil world now but it's much worse now than it was then a man and it's more deceived now than it was then and he said to him or he said deliver us from this present evil world when he grace of God to deliver us from the influence of the god of this evil age a man he said according to the will of God and our Father to whom be glory for ever and ever a man and one other scripture second Corinthians just turned back to second Corinthians chapter 4 amen and again beginning to read at verse 1 therefore seeing we have this ministry seeing we have this ministry seeing we have this message grace as we have received mercy we faint not a man let's not compromise let's have the same faith that we had when we first came to this word only a greater faith amen by the grace of God because we're going from the revelation of God has sent a prophet and the revelation of the opening of the mystery of God to the purpose of why God did it and that was to give us rapturing faith a man are we getting Rattray faith there are those that are getting more and more knowledge of the message but less and less and less faith where is your faith brother we got the word we got the message now where's faith brother again the profit challenge to our face when he said if you can't believe for divine healing how can you believe for a rapture amen the faith for divine healing is any the physical body but the referee faith is changing the physical body completely amen from time to eternity brother I tell you there's very few that are exercising faith are they are thinking faith how many are believing faith and they are trusting Amen or how many are confessing what the devil is putting in their minds yeah they're under Satan's anointing any and they're going to say this they're gonna say that do do this to do that that's the devil that's the god of this world brother if there's the God of creation you believe with a complete belief again as I mentioned the other night concerning the brother that was it saying oh that we gotta lay hands on the sick lands on the stake lands on the sink and I know there were giving me scripture scripture scripture scripture but laying on the bed laying all the veins the power of God said he said basically he said the laying on the veins with a Jewish tradition amen but when that surgery income and said to Jesus I'm not worthy you come under my roof he says speak the word only and Jesus said I had not found so great faith no he said not in Israel does he find that faith in you and me a man but that's the faith that God is looking for a man and it's a faith that the devil is there to challenge it's a faith that the devil is there to to get us away from but God wants us to get us more and more into that faith that believes God like like the Centurion Jesus I've not found so great faith not in Israel will he find that faith in you is he finding that faith in me that your glory so that we're not concentrating on the negative we're concentrating on the positive Amen is the revealed word it is written does not say the devil's to the demo I read this you had the devil got you to read it and the devil is trying to get you to put everything on this whatever's on that so God is putting Washington portents on the word stay with the word a man stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth oh my god help us to go and live as believers God Evans to go in there as the sons and daughters of God God Evans to go in there as the Jesus Christ in flesh Elvis amen trust the Lord amen listen I believe the devil oh yeah that's all right that's all you can do this God has said this God has said that yes God has said it a man but God has also said God has also said a man and brother in this hour of this age what did he do what he do in sending a ministry in this hour in this age like a brother/sister just like the ministry that a they came into the first stage in our Lord Jesus Christ a man in the beginning was the word the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us a man sweather was then so it is now in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and brother it was to redeem us physically spiritually now he's made flesh in us to redeem us physically amen brother that what he started he's finishing us amen there was an elephant now we're in the Omega a Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Omega very is Christ in the bright crisis may flesh in the bright it is mrs. Jesus Christ if there's resurrection arrived through faith it is in mrs. Jesus Christ hey man if there's any resurrection raspberry faith you're the one that's what's that seen it amen if you're believing the word the way that God wants you to believe it if you're accepting it the way God why should accept it and again brother sister let's take it serious serious where the boat of God said he said God is waiting on us why for the resurrection the rapture got me yummy but yet there's too many believers are waiting on God Oh God do this guy do that God do this no God wants you to do it a man and brother sisters gave us the word he's done this he done that amen to give us the faith whereby we can do it amen but brother again the words got to strikers right anybody surely after 50 years since they're going to the private over 50 years that the word is going to strength is right anyway that it's going to control us a man is gonna lead us guide us it's our wisdom it's our leadership amen that we become as I just preached on a prisoner to the word hey man anybody if you're a if you're in a national prison bringing your honor you're under control of all the rules and regulations and you gotta you gotta go by this rule that rule and so on so if you're prisoners of the word you stay with the word amen it's the whole truth nothing but the truth ain't man brother you're not gonna compromise no no not not because you like this or you like that no not by any means well I don't think the or reminders remind that wait this thing if it is do you need it do you want to do that do you really need to do that but most people want one to want to do this want to do that oh so we could enjoy life in what you got the Holy Ghost that is the joy of the Lord brother I can't see how you can enjoy this old world there's something wrong with your faith if you think all day if this is fine this is fine this is good this is good no no no not good by any means we want to get out of it and because God it said he's gonna destroy it with fire ain't man brother and the brother God brings those things out here in this message the god of this evil age and he said no he said it's hard to you but he said he said I got I gotta say it he's not that I want to but I got to ain't mad because why that was his is his calling his ministry amen is to separate the break for the resurrection and the rapture as I said God's waiting on us and then the prophet of God said yeah and he said the dead in Christ are waiting on us are we responding to their hunger and thirst responding to their hunger and thirst for the for the rapture the resurrection and a glorified body they're in their fee off anybody yeah and we all know but the theophany body is rate we're next to you right yeah and probably hasta is not is not anymore it's not 12 feet from you at any given time and have you seen if you're not believing the way you should he said it'll pull away and you'll be convicted and then when you repent it comes back a man so they're in there theophanies as the powder god said now they could see one another talk to one another but they can't touch one another no they're waiting on us for the glorified body everybody the resurrection and a glorified body brother are we really just getting increasing in in the knowledge of the message this doctrine this doctor of that doctrine or we are as the message given us more and more faith for the resurrection hey BAE C Luther went on and did what he did he did what he did a man and all made sacrifices after sacrifice all he thought he would justify himself but he didn't feel justified under finally a struggle in his heart the just shall live by faith and in Christ were justified oh then he went for preaching hey man he wasn't going for sacrifice in this sacrifice of that he went for preaching oh I justify you're justified Jesus justified us a man praise the name of the Lord he went on into the message so are we gone on into the message the message in us and I'll send the message well what are we going to be doing moving on to the resurrection moving on to the rapture because that's the climax of what God has done and what God is doing get out of here as I said I don't want to stay here when I consider what's going on in the world and I consider the compromising that believers are doing I said Lord get us out of here or all I agreed or if you don't get us out soon I still won't be any flesh saved there were nobody left for the rapture hey man he's hardly talked to a one out of a million well if there's 2 million believers do you mean you tell me it's only 2 going living Saints brother we got to take this more serious than what Luther took what he had take it more serious than 1 Wesley had take it more serious than the early Pentecostals oh yeah now at the climax and now God is finishing now see it's the Omega grace of God to his brother that were going to be more subject to the God of creation brother we're not going to listen to the god of this evil age and I tell you the devil is God what we're saying is the works of the devil the works of the god of this evil age is not God it's Satan and brother and not your anything he's in politics you see it but it's also in religion oh yeah those out there that are religious and they're just religious but they're not spiritual God Elvis in 2nd Corinthians 4 and verse 1 therefore seeing we have this ministry we have received mercy we faint not don't faint but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the Word of God deceitfully but he putting self interpretations to it no no you leave it the way God gave it not only the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God manifestation of the truth in you manifestation of the word in you and brother not just in this church God looking for it in your heart your soul even out there oh yes most definitely but more and more believers are starting to fall compromise but for to look more better in the eyes of the world all the old victors did they they'll receive us more oh they're like knowledge is more they'll have more fellowship with us no that's compromising that's the devil that's the god of this evil age getting you to compromise a little here a little there so you get more and more friends of the world brother Jesus stood more and more with the word and he got less and less and less till they crucified him he may understand the same things wouldn't happen to the troupe right the more you stay with the word take your stand for the word amen they're gonna try to crucify you god help us notice verse 3 again but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world amen the god of this world and he's not referring to Jesus he's referring to the devil in him the god of this world has blinded the minds of them he said which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them but it's more deceiving in this hour amen for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness as shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and we go for reflecting Christ go for reflecting the God of creation not the god of this world not the God of compromise we're going for it to reflect the God of the resurrection the god of the rapture amen again as Luther put the emphasis on justification we're putting the emphasis on the resurrection and the rapture amen god help us and in this message on the god of this evil age the property is hard blunt and challenging the sanity of worldly men and women and challenging the faith professing Christians and or professor to have in this insane world brother don't act like the world don't doctor the world don't live like the world because it's insanity brother again during denominational that back years ago that saw this and saw that out there and they said oh that's insanity what what are we as believers see if denominations would see that and call it insanity what would well what what we to see brother away if it was striking there have much more to strike us if they see this they see that brother again we were considered them to be foolish virgins but they see this to see that how much what ought we to see if we profess to be wise virgins what are we to see brother either wise they're gonna do a foolish virgin acts like that what a device virgin to act like brother the wise virgin wasn't looking for this the wise virgin was looking for the marriage supper we're looking for them for the rapture the resurrection taking us to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen to sit with him in his strong so brother in this message as we get into it you'll understand and I'll emphasize I heard and I blurt it out challenging then the prophetic ministry is when I lifting up william branham it wasn't William Brennan was God in William Brennan and not many preachers or professing Christians will repeat what the Lord through his prophet preached brother god help us I was amazed when I got back to this sermon that's the Lord graceful God we're not going to ignore it Oh Lord and we'll just we'll just take the sermon on choosing a bride we just take the sermon on perfect faith we'll just take the sermon on this subject that's sort of this doctrine that doctrine no this was one of the last service that he preached and he and he felt within himself that God wanted him to preach it and that we needed it and we do a man so that we're not going to be deceived as Eve was a man Satan was also a God in the garden he was and he did say yet God said he quoted the scripture and yes God said and they quote the message let's be careful there we're going to stay with what God said and there's too many believers in compromising I have to be honest as I said I've been hitter I around this message now since 1966 over 50 years and all the changes I've seen the compromising I'd say yeah among the people among ministry and brethren oh yeah compromising so brother I pray God's grace to help us to stay with the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth and it will indeed take the grace of God to enable us to stay in line with the truth of the will of God as I said we ought to come to that place now not my will don't be done because we're fighting it Jesus fought with an unbelieving world with the same curse world with an insane generation so god help us to stay in line please don't go back into denominational ideas don't don't believe that denominational spirit get on you and you and you make a denomination out of the message oh yeah there's a lot of searches message churches and then we'll know more than the like denominations out there they're just a denomination but how many are hungry thirsty for the resurrection trusting for the rapture screaming crying praying and the ministry preaching on its Laura careful be careful be careful if this go let's go let's go let's get out of here no grace not only this our sisters will indeed need the grace of God to dress and to act as old-fashioned only ghost filled Christians yeah and brother the powder God is highlighting not just the Brethren but the sisters and what they're doing yeah these are knocked on with worldly people out there but believers what they're doing it's the influence of the god of this evil age God's grace they will not face we a rather God's grace said we will have faith to catch the revelation of the god of this evil age and let the word put us on our guard against the deception of the devil there's a lot of believers are dissolved is he deceived they're deceived and that's why they're not as much into it like they used to be years ago why they're under Satan's a-19 not on not God's anointing if as a Holy Ghost of 90 you're on fire for the things of God you're unfair for the resurrection rapture amen but I tell you there's so few that have that anointing of God in their hearts and souls that's why I said like they one time their atmosphere there were so much so much of 19 in the world and not around the earth that your mind it was in the atmosphere you walk outdoors anywhere and you could feel it you could sense it but now you don't sense it I don't feel it why because they're so few that got the Holy Ghost oh yeah I don't feel the atmosphere is not like it used to be why because there's less and less and less and less with the Holy Ghost where is there where is back so many years ago the anointing was was on the Saints then do you know any was out of states here the anointing was on the Saints in central do you know any one of the Saints around the world not anymore god help us the Satan is so deceiving in these last days that we are warned that there will be no flesh saved if the Lord didn't shorten time let's not assume that we are believers let's make sure we're believers by lining constantly lining up with the word yeah asking grace Lord in the name of Jesus grant grace Lord please Lord that we're going to stay in line with the word we're going to we're gonna become more and more of the word in flesh amen and if you were the word in flesh you're going to act like the word in flesh Jesus oh yeah you can have the attitude Jesus hedge you're gonna have the spirit Jesus head the hunger he had the thirsty aid and brother he wasn't interested in soul world he was interested in the world to come there's like I said Jesus said I'm not longer shall I be with you well how much longer should I be in this whole world I'm sick of it Lord it's time to go please but there's not many believers had that attitude they're just believers and they're satisfied and going on Issy he said tonight I want to speak if the Lord willing he said of God or rather there was another message but he wanted to minister on this subject in in the morning message on the god of this evil age and he read from Galatians he read from second Corinthians as we've already read and he did say he said in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ he soon as the image of God should shine unto them and he said the same as it was in the Garden of Eden amen what brought the deception the devil and he was using the serpent and again the serpent wasn't was he was an operator creature like a man and so close to man that is see seed would mingle with the man woman seed yeah Satan got into the serpent and he influenced the serpent the serpent influenced II so Satan is getting into the Serpent's in this day and in this hour and he what he's there to influence the bride yeah he-man Satan was talking to Eve through the serpent this is God is talking to the bride through a prophet but don't brother who's talking to you if it's a ministry make sure it's a god called ministry make sure it's God and not the devil because remember we're warned in the Bible that even the devil's angels are preaching the gospel that's right devil yeah the Devils are preaching it Paul warned us why he knew that they're going to preach this and add to it or they would take away from the truth oh yeah their own ideas brother again that that's what the God was highlighting in the book of Revelation the deeds of the Nicolaitans in the first church age and eventually it became doctrine and eventually it became an organization controlling the people oh yeah right on down to the third age of legally the third age he became an organization and a denomination controlled the people and God hated it but God loved the first stage second date because you you also hate the diesel and Acadians there was believers there that recognized that it was the devil brother do you recognize Satan's influence in your life Satan trying to do this train trying to get you to do this yeah god help us he says the same as it was in the Garden of Eden the god of this old world blinding the minds of them that believe not one believer know God knows God I said you're hurt do you believe in your heart make sure you make sure that you're not one of those that are dead the devil the god of this world is blinding so he said my text this morning is the god of this evil age and he said as we read in the scriptures now he said this message points out the evils of this evil age and it is fitting to prophesy for this evil age and it's my belief that the Bible has every answer for every age and he said written in the Bible for the believer and I believe that everything that we have need of is written here he said just needs to be interpreted by the Holy Spirit a man make sure is that the Holy Spirit not the Holy Spirit and Satan is there with his ministry to try to interpret this preach this priest is preached this oh they love to hear this they love to hear that yeah that's the truth he's going to give you what you want to hear physically not spiritually he said notice closely as we study the word he said the god of this evil age that we are now living he said it may seem strange a very strange thing in this age of grace when God has taken a people for his namesake is bright and he said this in this age that should be called the age of evil and is evil yes because according to the revelation they put Jesus out of the church jesus said he highlights - there he said jesus said you say you're rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing see where they're putting the emphasis finance on money but names on prosperity part name is on this this world and this life but not the world could come but jesus said you know not that you're wretched miserable poor blind naked and don't know what that is blind the devil is blind them to that truth but in the emphasis on the natural but not on the spiritual brother and as I said don't don't sing a lie if we sing a tender and cottage why should I care when this generation does care they do they don't want to tent they don't want a cottage they want it they want a nice house they're building a mansion for me over there how many really really truly believe it or is it just religion it's the age of evil this last stage in each of the very age that God is calling her people for his namesake by grace and he said it's this is called an evil age and we'll prove it by the Bible that this is the age that he was speaking up now this is very strange he said say it's a very strange thing to think he said that in an evil age that God would be calling his bride he is but there's not many he said listen he's calling not a group church but a people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married and become part of him by predestination that's what he's doing through the word it's calling out the bride separating the bright on Dame Psalms so grace in the name of Jesus that we can make our calling an election sure by the word by the message a man with a brother do you have a right attitude do you have a right spirit do you have a right motor and objective well what is the right attitude right motive right objective the same one that Jesus had we have grace but yet as I said I've noticed not a believers don't have the right attitude they don't have the right spirit they don't have right motives and right objectives again as I said that person that I was dealing with that had just been introduced to the message that he felt that the person that was dealing giving him the witness of the message never had that right attitude never had that read spirit right motive an objective and as I searched first when I come to this message I discerned that spirit I'm many many believers back there over fifty years ago and that's why I preach what I preach in life to ever knock I said he loved them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same oh yeah they were caught up with themselves caught up with other believers come up with this but look down their noses at anybody that didn't believe the message don't do that keep your spirit right in your attitude right because a brother a man if your attitudes not right your motives not right objectives not right your spirits not right then brother that person out there we're gonna rise in judgment against you come maybe their attitude was right their spirit was right just say God and I had not revealed to them the message that he that was ordained to call it a bride they're not lost he was thought all just hey as long as you're in the message you're safe no it's the bride many are called few are chosen but as I said the called are not not lost the children is the bride because why there's gonna be millions and millions and millions and outside the city again brother diamond was highlighting those thing when we are in our conversation about the word about those in the city and those outside the city I said yes brother that's right I said keep your attitude right because there's a lot of people are there's gonna be outside the city amen the grace of God and no doubt I guess there's some a lot of believers to that be outside the city I pray grace that again because they're not bright but I'll tell you this if they're in the message and the messages in them they got a right attitude they got a right spirit right motive right objective and they are spiritual not religious but spiritual are you spiritual are you spiritual in your thoughts spiritually in your words virtually your deeds are you spiritual in your actions proving that is Christ living in you yeah grace of God he said last week in Matthew 24 he said it was most deceiving age of all ages all the ages of deceit from the Garden of Eden all the way down he said there's never been an age so deceptive as this age and that's the truth there were a generation of believers that need to be under guard as this generation he said false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders and if possible to deceive the very elect 'add but he said it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do leave out one word you're deceived and he said Christians everywhere taking each of the hour we are living and he should mark down and read and listen close brother he's getting serious he's getting more serious than what they thought he would get and he was going more harder than what they realized he would be but today most message believers they don't want preachers to preach art don't get personal impersonal oh I just preached the message so yeah this doctor that I preached this preached the early they can preach with the resurrection of rapture - oh good good praise the Lord Amen thank you Jesus and Jesus will see thank me can I thank you for your faith as Jesus recognized the Centurions faith Wow he said I've not found so great faith no not in Israel amen he recognized it he acknowledged it he may that's the guy I paid God's looking for Oh Lord you do this you do that then the prophet of God said that's the trouble with us he said when it comes to being Christians God do this God do this God do that but you get the Holy Ghost God's giving you the power to do it amen the Christians everywhere take heed to the hour we are living in he said mark Adele and listen close one would God call the people out of this evil age for his name and he said the reason is to try her is bright and he said when she has made manifest been tried proven and he's approved to Satan he said like it was at the beginning so shall it be in the end Amen brother that Satan won't deceive us by grace listen we find now this evil ages prove to Satan she is not like Eve and she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by His Word the bride as Adams bride was tried by the word and Adams bride will eat every bit of the word all but one confused promise yeah don't let the devil give you a promise make sure it's God but the devil promised Eve this he said yes is Eve he said God as said but I say unto you you shall not God said you shall die is you shall not surely die surely let's be plain yeah and so she did fall to his deceit and many and many believers today are falling to the devil's deceit please let's not ignore the revelation of the Garden of Eden because now we're under the influence of the god of this evil age and we are in Satan's Eden because not long after he preached this message on the god of this evil age he preached Satan's Eden oh and I'm not going to worry with this it's not gonna worry about that you better be on your guard she believed but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face-to-face and now the people that's called for his name is his right and she has come to in contact again by the same thing not just denominational truth but every word does not get it let's get the Holy Ghost not not a nomination spirit but the Holy Spirit and I'll be honest just many a believers got denominational spirits they think like denominations act like denomination yeah talk like denomination yeah Dena there's people out there in denomination to talk this this and this while we believe this we believe this we believe that yeah and same thing wrong believers but they're not living it it's not in control of them morning noon and night what is the will of God again sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God amen are you led by the Spirit the Holy Spirit what brought you here today a religious spirit or the Holy Spirit to some people religious spirits bring them to the church that's right but if they're brighter Christ warned again the Holy Ghost brings you amen it's God in control by the grace of God he said in the beginning of the Bible man was given the Word of God to live by and he said it must be every word and in the middle of the Bible Jesus came and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and when he was tempted by Satan and God telling us here in the last days that the god of this world will rise up in the last days anew so ever shall add one word or take one word it is his part will be taken from the book of life and he said God be merciful to us and let us not walk as stiff shirts with our chest stuck out our head up know-it-all for we too are one one time we're in disobedience let us with grace and mercy and feeling in our hearts toward God only come to the throne of grace amen be humble strange after nineteen hundred years of gospel preaching that she that is the world system is more evil than in the days when he was here yeah they're more evil today than they were two thousand years ago more deceived today than they were two thousand years ago he said the world system is more evil and the world is heading to a climax a great climax and he said you know that the Lord is fulfilling his word on every hand and that's the truth god help us brother it is a climax listen as I've said over the last few years scientists even science certain scientists have acknowledged that there's something going on and that the earth is coming - it's in yeah that's why I said that they're certain scientists had told told to other scientists he said make the moon livable because he said the earth is getting coming to the place where it will be unlivable we know there's something going on in the earth something going on around the world on the earth and there's things that we know and things we don't know so let's be on our guard because why scientists acknowledge that but they don't acknowledge the scripture where he said he's gonna have a new heaven and a new earth they know that this Old Earth and heaven is passing away there's something going on they know in the atmosphere everything is changing we know it's the fire of God amen but he said I'll create a new heaven and a new earth I'm longing for it are you longing for the kingdom of God can you imagine what the kingdom of God is gonna be like perfect you know and there's gonna be no no thoughts about the world no thoughts about evil no thoughts of sin no one belief absolute perfection what I said but it's gonna be real and if you can't serve God here you won't serve there if God can't use your here he won't use her there and that's why we're here and going through all we're going through God wants to see how you're going to act now you're going to react oh good good so what so now he said I could use them in the world to come in these Kingdom but I tell you there's a lot of so-called believers he won't be able to use because they're absolutely lazy spiritually lazy their brother those that were filled with the Holy Ghost or mine they weren't lazy they were in in it Oh morning noon and night they were filled with the Holy Ghost they were doing this doing this they just live for God they live for Jesus they live for one another they weren't caught up with the food of this world they were cut they were caught up with the spiritual that had that had a greater premise in their life than anything natural yeah absolutely changed by the grace of God but again there's a lot of so-called believers are just carnal just Karen just lived in this world same as the same as those out the people out there living same mode of same objectives same attitude some of them might be religious some are not religious so I'm don't even believe in God you know but again just to do his believers out there just caught up with the natural world but their spiritual ones that I caught up with the promise of the world to come they're with me it says what is it the world is heading to a climax why the spirit of lawlessness moral decay scientific religion has led it to the cage of every eighth full and unclean bird as the Bible said and he said revelation 18 and he asked him to turn to Revelation 18 you turn your Bibles to Revelation 18 I'll just be another two moments and verse 1 and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird you know God help us to recognize prophecy fulfilled in the world we're living in why are we experiencing this why are we seeing this where we're seeing that it is it is written its thus saith the Lord for all nations and drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her brother again does not focus on the natural spiritual you can commit spiritual fornication yeah we focus on all the natural if the natural know spiritual the kings of their the committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies amen I have heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues amen for her sins have reached unto the heaven and God has remembered her iniquities pray grace that were increase and there's no remembrance of our sin but if your spirit is not right you had to it's not right God remembers her sin yeah but your spirit is right your attitude is right amen and you got the Holy Ghost God doesn't remember is cast into the sea of forgetfulness praise the Lord just a couple of quotes he said what a warning that throws the church exactly back to Revelation 3 to the lauda C&H lawlessness real religious but lawless and he said now because I'll say us that we are rich increased with Goods and have not need of nothing and knowest not that thou art naked and miserable and blind and don't know it he said perfectly with the scripture of this age not for the scripture of the age of Daniel not for those in the age of Noah but is in the last evil age is worse worse than the time of Daniel worse than the age of Noah a man has gone beyond and it's worse than Sodom and Gomorrah I don't know if you're seeing it or not and it's brother Brown especially emphasizes because he said the woman is the god of this world and so on but he emphasizes what the devil is using the woman to do this do this to that and brother as I said what I'm seeing out there now even even senior citizens the way they're dressed I said Lord I said the world is insane you're right I sure was right when I see seniors where there's at a bank or in this in a mall or wherever it is and you see them dressed this way a dress that I said Lord that's insane I said one time I said young people dressed a certain way but the the older ones didn't didn't dress like that and I said oh my said what kind of spirit is on her lord I pray grace or salvation of her soul but I said oh my their spirit is hunter says she's dresses this way Natura this is just this way oh it's just it's a insane brother grace to us and now of course it's affecting the whole world and again you'll find that it's more you see this more on that more on the sisters are under brother under women rather than on men there are some out there that are perverted some of them that are that are crazy in the way they're acting and dressing but mostly it's the women as it was in the Garden of Eden Saudis today sisters be on your guard he said he said let it soak real deep oh yeah he's taking his time as he goes into the word and he's landed he and Blane today and he gets heard heard heard blonde blonde blonde he said there are naked he said let that soak real deep I know I may have much disagreement on this tonight but he said it's got to a place that a Christian can only walk out of his house and not be brought into the presence of this evil age and that is the truth that's the truth and he said out he said by on sufficient he said dressed women as as the devil the god of this world used a woman in the first time in the Garden of Eden so he's using the women today such as anyone needs to be under guard as two sisters the brothers he said women I'm going to say this and I want you to listen and men and women you might disagree with this but I feel led to say it and he said did you know any woman that dresses like hers herself like that is not in her right mind are you insane have you lost your right mind I know there's a lot of believers that Jesse more like the world now yeah because I would see it sometimes you only in a certain place serve like my lord I said that's crazy during Saint I said not normal anymore and then all of a sudden you'd begin to see maybe a sister here it's sister there sister somewhere else you know Oh taking on to taking on the spirit of the world that's the influence of the god of this evil age are you more concerned about pleasing God or pleasing man now I'll finish with this here but also to say that the problem God said do you know he says you can be good you can be this you could be that and never unfaithful to your husband but it's you dressed like that and you go out there and he's you cause a man he said to look look at you and lust after you and he said he said you'll be guilty of adultery yeah oh don't worry about this don't worry about that are you better God looks at the heart he said I feel laid to say this and woman that dresses herself like that is not in her right mind and do you know she is whether she believes or not or things that are not she is a prostitute though the woman might stain with her hand before God and swear she's never touched been touched by any other man but her husband and that might be honest truth but still she's a prostitute she got a prostitute spirit causing her dress like that Jesus and whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her and he said she and she said she's naked the Bible says and don't know it the spirit that's an annoying year to do such a thing is an evil prostitute spirit well spirit see sisters be careful let the Holy Spirit cover you don't let the devil the god of this world bring a prostitute spirit on you he said our outward being her physical body or flesh she might be clean she might not commit any adultery or could swear to God that she never but he said her spirit is a prostitute spirit and she has been blinded by the god of this world blinded by world of fashion she dressed herself six sexy and got out there you better be careful yeah he said the other day said brother wood and I were putting our boat in the river and I was to get away from the house for a few minutes to go up to the river and wherever you went he's a women with these and I don't know what okay nice bikinis that's right brother I didn't want to say he caught it kidneys it was bikinis he said budget of bikinis or something either around them he said that's a disgrace he said a woman can't be in her right mind and put on anything like that she is possessed with a positive spirit and you settle that with God lady because you'll find out someday that that's the truth what would you say today if he would have seen see what he's seeing today what would he say what you and I are seeing because one time as I said even though women who wore wore slacks you know but they were they were normal and new with pant legs but now when they put on the slacks and these things today it is skin tight you know that is the influence of the god of this evil age when we're seeing politics and everything else is going on spiritually religiously you know even this was outside the message around the message it is the influence of the god of this evil age god help us and if there's anyone he's going to attack as he did in the Garden of Eden so it is a in the in Satan's Eden it's gonna be the sisters the woman and the women out there in the world and not only that I've noticed and sisters around the mission now are getting more and more like worldly the World'd women out there the way they act the way they dressed and so on oh yeah amazing where is God in simplicity how could you a lady knowing how sacred your body is and exposed that over there to these lustful sinful Devils that walk the streets of this day if sons of God were was all still sons of God your other was the son of God he'll either make you put on clothes or leave you and then he sister how many brothers to take nurse Dan if a boy was the son of God he never marries such a thing he said you I'm telling you the truth and someday he said you'll meet it naked adulteress don't know it he said I swear that I never trespassed the mouth of my husband oh yeah your husband will judge you for for it if you did but God will judge you by what kind of a spirit you got in you and not judge you by your body but by the spirit that inner part of you while spirit influence you to live this way do this talk this way act this way or dressed this way you know or even the way you have your hair as a sister yeah it's amazing the number of spirits that's influencing the sisters today I'll have to finish see how hard he's getting and he's preached in his own church yeah and he's gonna get harder and harder and harder and he acknowledges it he said it's hard and he brings in again about the brother that that come to him and told to stop preaching that he said brothers you're preaching that you're preaching to hurt you should preach this shouldn't preach that yeah they feel the same way to day but certain of the ministry they preach to her numbers nerd enough yeah why because I don't have to preaching preaching according to the will of God is going to bring separation separation separation greater and greater and greater separation and you just want you just want to get more and more more like God more and more closer to the Lord by the grace of God grace I'd love to stop here because maybe they see he's bringing out the two nature's in the human body there's a physical nature and there's a note inside nature he said the outside man is a physical being and he said see taste feel smell and hear and these are the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will and you can accept what the devil says or accept what God says and that will determine what spirit is in there if it's the Spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world brothers sister you won't allow what's going on out there to influence you because you're led by the Spirit the Holy Ghost out of your heart God in simplicity and he said that'll determine II said what spirit is in you you either accept what God says or what the devil says and he said the Spirit of God it'll feed on the if it's the Spirit of God it will feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything of the world and he said Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world is because the love of God's not entered here to enter this inner part he's a Satan's deceive you amen never at any age did women ever act like that they do in this age that's the truth has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control I wonder the true answer to this question to my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work and he said now so there can't be not more than two two heads and one of them is the Holy Spirit and the other one is the spirit of the devil in the last days in deception now I said I'm going to base my thoughts right here on the rest of the text and he said the two spirits a man one of them God's Holy Spirit and the other one is the devil Spirit working in deception a man and the people of the earth are now making their choice and the Holy Spirit is air calling out a Bride of Christ and he's doing it by vindicating his word of promise to earth for this age showing that it is Christ and he said the age we are now living the Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this and the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos and the Devils aren't only spirit is here calling his church by Herer as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning see it's coming right back to that seed time again from Eden amen grace that will not believe that god of this world but believe the god the self existing one the God of creation the God of eternity for the glory of God rather stop there and continue Lord willing on Wednesday amen because I want to because again we never got into some of the even very very very hard things he's saying to the sisters add to the brothers amen and then maybe we'll move on into Satan's Eden by the grace of God so brother let's recognize what what we're doing where we are what we're dealing with please don't just ignore the devil well the devil would has the devil's influence - oh I ignored it yeah Satanist Satan to get you to do that but not exactly the way that that we need to do it let's listen to God judge everything by the word amen by the grace of God thank God god bless you listing oh my one o'clock let's say marching on in the light of God marching on I'm marching on off the path that the master trot amen marching on it says marching on with the flag unfurled marching on I'm marching on
