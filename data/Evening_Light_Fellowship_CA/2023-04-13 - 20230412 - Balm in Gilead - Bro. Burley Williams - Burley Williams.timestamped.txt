[48:03] and they brought Joseph into Egypt amen
[48:06] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[48:08] word you may be seated
[48:12] praise the Lord
[48:16] this morning uh
[48:18] just want to take a thought on a bomb
[48:20] and Gilead
[48:22] and uh
[48:24] this just a thought here but it got some
[48:27] many things we're going to try to bring
[48:28] out here into service this morning
[48:31] and uh and I would like to say I want to
[48:33] thank you for your prayers
[48:36] that you prayed for us and I I promise
[48:39] you it was prayer that brought us
[48:41] through
[48:42] and uh I was going to try to just give
[48:44] up
[48:45] testimony about those things and trying
[48:48] to bring it into this service if the
[48:51] Lord would help us help us amen it's a
[48:54] lot went on and it's going to kind of
[48:57] scripture that I read has a lot to do
[49:00] also what happened to me and I didn't
[49:03] see it coming funny see it coming
[49:07] but it happened
[49:10] praise the Lord but we give God all of
[49:12] the glory if we give God all of the
[49:14] praise amen
[49:16] but before I get to where I want to get
[49:19] to just to give a little testimony I
[49:22] want to uh go to Second Kings chapter
[49:25] four
[49:35] second Kings chapter four
[49:43] if we're going to go to verse 38.
[49:49] you know I believe we love the Lord
[49:53] with all our hearts
[49:56] but when things come personal
[49:59] in your life you'll find out a lot about
[50:02] yourself
[50:04] when you have to go through something
[50:07] and uh
[50:09] could hurt pretty deep or whatever you
[50:12] find a lot about yourself and you'll
[50:14] find a lot about the people that are
[50:16] around you
[50:18] in the
[50:20] we talk about David
[50:22] the faithful Warriors that they've had
[50:25] you know they was faithful
[50:27] they fought with David
[50:29] and they fought with David they they was
[50:31] with them they we called it the faithful
[50:33] Gentile Warriors
[50:35] and how they we know what the prophet
[50:37] said they knew that David was one day
[50:40] was going to be
[50:41] King gonna be on the throne and they
[50:43] were safer to it
[50:45] but you know even in all of their
[50:47] faithfulness
[50:49] something happened to them
[50:52] personally
[50:54] to where they want Stone David
[50:57] y'all knew that right
[51:00] you remember when David him uh went off
[51:03] for him in the Warriors and so forth and
[51:05] they come back
[51:07] and their wives
[51:08] and their children was taken
[51:11] and David said it was just a bit great
[51:14] distress
[51:16] and then they was going to actually
[51:18] Stone David
[51:20] his own Warriors that was fighting for
[51:22] him standing with him now they don't
[51:25] suffer the loss they don't come personal
[51:26] now
[51:28] now they're looking at David
[51:30] we want to Stone you
[51:33] but look what David attitude was
[51:35] he knew it was pressure he knew it was
[51:38] the strength
[51:39] but David did the greatest thing
[51:41] he comforted himself in the Lord
[51:45] even though his Warriors want to Stone
[51:47] it
[51:48] see now they was one fighting for him
[51:50] and everything but now something
[51:51] personal been taken from them
[51:54] now they change
[51:56] if people can be the exact same way
[51:59] they love the church everybody happy and
[52:01] everything but in deep personal things
[52:03] start happening to them then you start
[52:06] watching them change
[52:07] I'm here to tell you friends even when
[52:10] the deep personal things happen things
[52:12] that go wrong you can't understand it
[52:14] always keep the right attitude towards
[52:17] the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:19] knowing that all things work together
[52:21] for the good
[52:23] it's easy to get into the Flesh and
[52:25] start pursuing things assuming things
[52:27] it's easy to do that but we'll just stay
[52:30] still sometimes and watch them see the
[52:33] salvation of the Lord because he don't
[52:35] make mistakes
[52:37] is that right so I'm I'm saying that for
[52:40] a reason because I bring all these in to
[52:42] the service this morning now I wanted to
[52:45] read here I'm referring to some things
[52:48] that I just been studying lately uh a
[52:51] good message to really listen to
[52:54] it's the power of decision
[52:56] and I'm and I'm bringing a lot of
[52:58] thoughts from that this morning and in
[53:01] First Kings chapter 4 verse 38 I'm just
[53:04] we're going to read it it said Elisha
[53:07] came that's a gilgal again to gilgal and
[53:10] there was dirt in the land and the sons
[53:13] of the prophets were sitting before him
[53:15] he said unto his servant
[53:18] set on the great pot and seized pottage
[53:21] for the sons of the prophets
[53:23] and one went out into the field to
[53:25] gather herbs and found the wild Vine and
[53:29] gathered there for a while Gorge his lap
[53:32] full they came and shred them into the
[53:35] pot of pottage for they knew them not so
[53:38] they poured out for the man to eat and
[53:40] it came to pass and they was eating of
[53:42] the pottage that they cried out and said
[53:45] oh thou man of God there's death in the
[53:48] pot
[53:49] and they could not eat their uh
[53:51] but he said bring me milk if you cast it
[53:54] in the pot and he said pour out for the
[53:56] people that they may eat and there was
[54:00] no harm in the pot I really liked the
[54:03] scripture and I liked how the prophet
[54:05] responded to it he said that Elisha
[54:09] didn't change the pot
[54:12] he got the same pot but he just put meal
[54:15] in it he said that meal which comes from
[54:18] a meal offering it represents Jesus
[54:20] Christ it's the same yesterday today and
[54:23] forever but what I loved he said he
[54:26] didn't change the power
[54:27] he just put the meal in the pot so I
[54:31] look at the message of the owl the
[54:34] prophet of God didn't change the change
[54:36] the Bible
[54:38] he didn't change the Bible but he did
[54:41] put a meal offering in it to show Jesus
[54:44] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[54:46] forever
[54:47] and I like how he brought it in he said
[54:49] how could this man not knew that what
[54:52] was different with the wild gourds and
[54:55] the things and the other things that
[54:56] they put in the pot he said he put wild
[54:58] gourds in it and so forth he and Herb he
[55:02] said how this man could not tell the
[55:03] difference from a wild God and the Earth
[55:06] he just can't quite understand it he
[55:08] said well yeah that's the same thing
[55:10] today how people twist up the Bible
[55:12] twist up the message can we say Amen
[55:15] they doing the exact same thing but we
[55:18] believe Jesus Christ is the same
[55:19] yesterday today and forever so what the
[55:22] message comes not to change the Bible
[55:25] but the brain thinks I get to perspected
[55:27] what man had added to the Bible down
[55:30] through the years adding to the word of
[55:31] God tampering with the word of God this
[55:34] message came back and restored it and
[55:36] brought everything to a balance
[55:38] can you say amen and then I just really
[55:41] just I really just blessed my heart and
[55:43] then the same thing with Elijah when
[55:46] they uh you remember they danced and
[55:48] they tore up the Altar and so forth when
[55:51] Elijah time came Elijah didn't get a new
[55:53] altar
[55:55] he just restored the one that they tore
[55:57] up
[55:58] can we say praise the Lord and that's
[56:00] the same thing brother sister yeah the
[56:02] Bible had become a new book to us but
[56:05] it's not it wasn't a new book that been
[56:07] Rewritten and give it to us no it's the
[56:10] Revelation that I've been sitting there
[56:11] all along that has become live to us in
[56:14] this day and time that we're living in
[56:16] he's saying I said well brother birdy
[56:18] where you going I'm I'm building up to
[56:20] somewhere I promise you that and then uh
[56:23] I would write some things down from that
[56:25] message
[56:26] then the Prophet come down to when you
[56:29] begin to talk about Aaron's Rod you if
[56:31] you go stutter the message you just kind
[56:33] of go down the lines on these things
[56:35] because it's all going to come back to
[56:37] us
[56:37] even we love the Lord with all our
[56:41] hearts but I think I do know in the time
[56:44] we're living in God wants us to have a
[56:46] deeper consecrated life with him
[56:49] and then he began to refer to Aaron's
[56:52] rod and that really just blessed my
[56:53] heart he said just like Aaron rod
[56:57] he said living in the presence of the
[56:59] king under Shekinah glory of the Lord
[57:01] Jesus Aaron Rod but it
[57:05] he said put Aaron's rod in there and an
[57:09] old dead almond tree but as it went
[57:11] under the Shekinah Glory everything it
[57:13] was
[57:14] restored again
[57:17] he said put Aaron's rod
[57:19] in the holiest of holies I like what he
[57:22] said everything it was
[57:24] was restored again it was a dead Rod but
[57:28] everything it was was restored again and
[57:33] he said
[57:35] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[57:39] under the Shekinah Glory of the Holy
[57:41] Spirit the veil drops behind him
[57:44] everything that he ought to have been a
[57:47] Son of God blooms out of him again
[57:51] that's that's beautiful can we say man
[57:54] because every predestinated sea ever if
[57:58] he designated son and daughter of God
[57:59] what we need is to get into the presence
[58:02] of God everything that we meant to be
[58:05] getting in his presence is going to come
[58:07] out
[58:08] amen you know uh I've seen down through
[58:11] the times just like even in the Book of
[58:13] Genesis you know when God said let there
[58:15] be let there be let every seed bring
[58:18] forth of its own kind what God was
[58:21] calling for in the Book of Genesis he
[58:23] wasn't calling for the tree to bring
[58:25] forth
[58:26] he was calling to deceive to bring forth
[58:29] amen because if he called to deceive to
[58:32] bring forth the tree will automatically
[58:34] come
[58:35] so that's what God has been doing to his
[58:37] bride he been calling to deceive he's
[58:40] been calling to Western our heart
[58:42] because he can get to West in our heart
[58:44] what we ought to be is going to
[58:46] automatically come out you see sometimes
[58:48] you get people when they try to deal
[58:50] with people they call into the person's
[58:52] flesh they're trying to convert flesh
[58:55] is that right no it got to start here
[58:58] starts in the heart then it
[59:00] automatically comes out on the outside
[59:02] can we say praise the Lord now it's so
[59:06] beautiful
[59:08] how the prophet put these things
[59:10] I'm just going to read
[59:13] he said I noticed long ago this comes
[59:15] from the power of decision
[59:17] he said there's some things
[59:19] that we have to do
[59:21] that God cannot do until we do it
[59:25] when I first married that I said
[59:27] okay
[59:28] and then he begins to explain it
[59:31] he said did you know that Ministry he
[59:35] said look we are the branches he is
[59:38] divine but Divine can't bear fruit
[59:43] the branch is what bears fruit
[59:45] amen he said it's the precious that bear
[59:48] fruit he said he furnishes the energy
[59:52] but we got to do the job you get what I
[59:57] mean the holy spirit is here tonight you
[1:00:00] see him each night he knows you but the
[1:00:03] only way he speaks is through us is that
[1:00:05] right our hands are his hands our eyes
[1:00:09] are his eyes he said now notice that he
[1:00:12] gives us things
[1:00:13] Jesus was standing one day looking upon
[1:00:16] the Harvest do you believe he was the
[1:00:18] lord of the Harvest he looked upon the
[1:00:21] heart he said you pray for the lord of
[1:00:23] the Harvest that he would send laborers
[1:00:25] into the Harvest because the Harvest is
[1:00:27] right and the laborers were few in other
[1:00:29] words you asked me to do what I know
[1:00:32] that's got to ought to be done that he
[1:00:35] could not do it until they asked him to
[1:00:37] do it so amen Jesus is the source he is
[1:00:41] divine we are the branches but if he
[1:00:44] wants fruit to be bad in this day for
[1:00:46] people can see it he wanted to be shown
[1:00:48] through you and me he want his life to
[1:00:50] be reflected through you and me
[1:00:54] can we say praise the Lord
[1:00:56] and then you know sometimes me and
[1:00:59] mother cat was even talking this morning
[1:01:03] it was kind of interesting when I went
[1:01:06] in your bathroom this morning brother I
[1:01:07] see some lotion
[1:01:09] I think it called uh stress relief
[1:01:12] I said Lord have mercy
[1:01:14] if that like they're going to worry I I
[1:01:16] I I I want to find where it was made
[1:01:18] I'll buy every bit of that they got and
[1:01:19] I use it every day I put it all over my
[1:01:21] body I do it this stress relief
[1:01:24] but I do no one to relieve the stress
[1:01:28] that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] but sometimes
[1:01:33] we can reflect back on our lives how we
[1:01:37] was raised
[1:01:39] and and when brother talking about me he
[1:01:42] was just talking about some things this
[1:01:43] morning he didn't know I had this quote
[1:01:46] that I was going to deal with you know
[1:01:49] there's nothing is uh surprised as God
[1:01:53] the way you was born how you was raised
[1:01:56] God knew all about it
[1:01:59] some people got so much deep complexes
[1:02:01] in their lives because they wasn't
[1:02:03] raised a certain way or why could I have
[1:02:06] been raised in this family why would we
[1:02:07] we didn't have this and why do I have to
[1:02:09] go through all of this and they they
[1:02:11] grow up with a little bit complexes in
[1:02:13] their life like that I'm for one I've
[1:02:15] been down that road but after God
[1:02:17] revealed himself to me them things don't
[1:02:19] matter because everything was for a
[1:02:22] purpose because God just know how to
[1:02:24] pull the war over the devil's eyes
[1:02:28] and I just like something here what the
[1:02:29] prophet said and it's beautiful he said
[1:02:32] now he said
[1:02:34] how he said how Faith confounded pharaoh
[1:02:39] he said how Pharaoh raised Joseph
[1:02:42] right up in the castle
[1:02:46] at him gave him the best made a good
[1:02:49] strong man out of him he lived 120 years
[1:02:52] he said and the devil
[1:02:56] raising up God's child raising up the
[1:03:00] child of God to do the work of God
[1:03:04] how God pulled the war over the eye that
[1:03:08] time because he's God
[1:03:11] so God could let the devil raise you
[1:03:14] so later on you do the work of God
[1:03:19] hello
[1:03:20] what you what you think Paul you
[1:03:23] remember Paul the devil raised Paul
[1:03:26] because Paul came to us place to just
[1:03:28] for him to be able to go to the high
[1:03:30] priest to get letters that show Paul had
[1:03:33] come to a position in life that they
[1:03:36] respected him he had Authority but they
[1:03:39] did not know they was Raising Paul for
[1:03:42] Paul to turn right back around and come
[1:03:44] back and get them
[1:03:46] so the devil let them raise Paul
[1:03:49] the devil God let the devil give Paul
[1:03:52] all of his education
[1:03:54] train Paul so Paul could come right back
[1:03:57] and use all of that because you remember
[1:03:59] Paul was smart
[1:04:00] he was extremely smart but he said I
[1:04:03] don't want your face to be resting on
[1:04:05] the wisdom of man but on the power of
[1:04:07] God Paul could have I didn't come with
[1:04:09] you and actually a speech which he could
[1:04:12] have
[1:04:12] he could have used it but he I promise
[1:04:15] you he did it depends on who he was
[1:04:17] talking to because Paul knew how to
[1:04:19] become all things to all men he knew how
[1:04:21] to talk to the rich the poor the
[1:04:24] intellectual he didn't even know how to
[1:04:25] come down on the level of those that
[1:04:27] wasn't that smart God trained him that
[1:04:30] way so all through his life God was this
[1:04:33] let the devil raise him
[1:04:35] but to do the work of God the same thing
[1:04:37] what Pharaoh did he raised Moses
[1:04:42] right in his house for Moses to come
[1:04:44] right back around and tear down this
[1:04:46] house
[1:04:47] praise the Lord you know why I believe
[1:04:49] why God did that to be honest with you I
[1:04:51] believe he did that because Adam Ray
[1:04:53] came
[1:04:57] Adam raised the devil
[1:04:59] hello God said all right you raise the
[1:05:02] devil and he caused problems in the
[1:05:04] family he said now I'm gonna let the
[1:05:05] devil raise some of my children so my
[1:05:07] children to call problems in the devil's
[1:05:09] family
[1:05:10] so that's why my past with the life that
[1:05:13] I live I learned from that God let me go
[1:05:16] through that so I can use it now to tear
[1:05:18] down Satan's kingdom
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:21] praise the Lord so it just does the way
[1:05:23] to all my complexes and I thank God you
[1:05:26] have painful things happen in life but
[1:05:28] I'm able to use those things now to
[1:05:30] identify certain things and people like
[1:05:32] and let them know keep pressing on
[1:05:34] godhead is upon you don't stop
[1:05:38] praise the Lord amen I like that
[1:05:42] raised let the devil raise God's child
[1:05:44] to do the work of God
[1:05:46] amen and uh I'm getting to my messages
[1:05:50] hold on a little bit
[1:05:53] he says
[1:05:55] in the younger generation
[1:05:58] I just read something earlier
[1:06:01] and they questions through ministers
[1:06:04] action questions about younger
[1:06:06] generation what can we do and what
[1:06:08] they're going through and so forth and
[1:06:10] you know I thought about that
[1:06:14] younger generation
[1:06:16] I used to be young too
[1:06:19] what was done for me
[1:06:22] I met God myself
[1:06:25] it's no new trick today
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:28] to try to help young people
[1:06:30] it ain't no new anointing no new tricks
[1:06:34] to help the Young Generation the word of
[1:06:37] God is still the same they need to meet
[1:06:40] God just to sing their way we did
[1:06:44] it ain't no special Ministry
[1:06:46] there's only one Ministry it's this
[1:06:49] message of our they have to come to it
[1:06:51] just the way that we did because if
[1:06:53] you're not careful trying to figure out
[1:06:55] what to do with the young people what
[1:06:57] you're going to actually do make a
[1:06:59] program
[1:07:00] for young people
[1:07:02] and that ain't gonna work because that
[1:07:03] program will turn into a denomination
[1:07:06] man we need to get them to the Lord
[1:07:08] Jesus Christ preach the word
[1:07:10] let them sit upon the word at their
[1:07:13] appointed time in their life when God's
[1:07:15] going to touch them God will he's done
[1:07:17] the same thing for you and me there was
[1:07:19] no program for me when I met the Lord
[1:07:21] God it was God's program he came to me
[1:07:24] and that's what they have to do the same
[1:07:27] thing today I will admit there are
[1:07:29] greater challenges
[1:07:31] for the young people today but that just
[1:07:33] makes it more glorious
[1:07:35] can we say man the things that they have
[1:07:37] to face today it just makes it more
[1:07:39] glorious that they're Overcomers in this
[1:07:41] day because in every age the prophecy is
[1:07:44] him that overcome it so God's Gonna help
[1:07:47] Overcomers in this age in this time
[1:07:50] and we're going to do it by the blood of
[1:07:52] the Lamb so it ain't no special program
[1:07:55] but what it is
[1:07:58] all these things that be presented there
[1:08:01] and he was talking about here he says in
[1:08:03] the power of decision the prophet says
[1:08:06] this he said I've been teaching before
[1:08:09] Moses
[1:08:11] he said before it came when God was
[1:08:14] going to
[1:08:15] frame the righteous seed through Cain he
[1:08:18] said you came but I know he meant
[1:08:20] through eight now he said you came right
[1:08:23] here but you know sometimes people made
[1:08:24] a mistake he made a mistake no he didn't
[1:08:26] make a mistake I know exactly what he
[1:08:28] meant
[1:08:29] praise the Lord he says see how the
[1:08:31] devil worked to cut it off in the days
[1:08:34] of Moses he drowned all the children
[1:08:37] in order to catch the elect one of God
[1:08:41] coming forth he said in the days of
[1:08:44] Christ he had all the children killed
[1:08:46] from two years old back trying to stop
[1:08:49] it that's one of the devil's tricks
[1:08:51] today
[1:08:52] know that he said it's to break faith
[1:08:56] from The Young Generation
[1:08:58] faith in what the word
[1:09:01] that's what it is it's so many
[1:09:02] distractions my my uh what I like to
[1:09:07] encourage young people to do believe
[1:09:09] this message
[1:09:10] believe this word whether you understand
[1:09:13] it or not believe it tell God you
[1:09:16] believe it and then you just keep having
[1:09:18] your faith in the word something to
[1:09:20] happen down in your life but if the
[1:09:22] devil can get you to doubt the word
[1:09:24] ain't nothing going to happen in your
[1:09:25] life but always just believe in the word
[1:09:29] like the prophet said if you don't
[1:09:30] understand it you're still capitalize it
[1:09:33] with an amen
[1:09:36] praise the Lord
[1:09:38] God bless you
[1:09:41] I just wanted to get that one all lit
[1:09:43] off my chest
[1:09:51] now
[1:09:53] I want to tell you
[1:09:56] how this happens
[1:09:58] to what happened to me
[1:10:00] I can look back now
[1:10:02] and see it
[1:10:04] come and see how it happened but at the
[1:10:06] beginning I didn't
[1:10:08] and I want to thank you for all your
[1:10:10] prayers all your support I really
[1:10:12] humbled myself
[1:10:14] I didn't realize how many people knew me
[1:10:16] I got messages from people I didn't have
[1:10:18] a clue they were
[1:10:20] from different countries just flowing in
[1:10:22] and that really just humbled me
[1:10:25] and I I really it really did I said Lord
[1:10:27] thank you
[1:10:28] but I will say this
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:33] what I went through
[1:10:36] not all of it was good
[1:10:38] but what I am thankful for
[1:10:41] I wasn't depressed
[1:10:44] I was irritated
[1:10:48] I really was
[1:10:49] I wasn't gonna let depression get me but
[1:10:52] I was real irritated and aggravated
[1:10:55] and and I told my church
[1:10:59] when you the worst thing you can do to
[1:11:02] somebody
[1:11:03] it's when they're going through
[1:11:04] something
[1:11:05] start going oh
[1:11:09] brother that's not good
[1:11:15] I told my church do not do that to me
[1:11:19] brother prayer nope
[1:11:22] don't do that to me
[1:11:23] I said just pray for me
[1:11:26] I said you remember they tried to do
[1:11:27] that with Paul when he's trying to stop
[1:11:29] him from going he's Paul said no no I'm
[1:11:31] going to pause it no they said oh Paul
[1:11:33] don't go Nook he said you you sat and
[1:11:36] you're breaking my heart I'm not only
[1:11:37] willing to go to Rome I'm willing to go
[1:11:39] die
[1:11:40] trying to mess with emotions
[1:11:42] that's the church don't do that the same
[1:11:45] thing with a child
[1:11:47] you get a little child if they fall
[1:11:49] they might not even be hurt
[1:11:51] but if you go Oh They'll stop they'll
[1:11:54] look at you and go huh
[1:11:59] but if they fall you say get up camp get
[1:12:01] up there just
[1:12:03] yeah
[1:12:05] so I said don't don't do me like that
[1:12:08] because I am not depressed yes I'm
[1:12:10] irritated but I'm not depressed just
[1:12:14] pray for me
[1:12:15] so I want to tell you I want to show you
[1:12:19] which I'm going to use
[1:12:20] the scriptures because it's part of what
[1:12:23] happened how'd this happen
[1:12:27] actually it was
[1:12:36] it was July
[1:12:40] the 30th
[1:12:43] now the accident happened August 3rd
[1:12:47] but July 30th because I went back
[1:12:50] and it was a Saturday night
[1:12:52] I was at uh Mike walls Church
[1:12:56] and I read a quote in the church a book
[1:12:59] that stirred my heart up and I'm going
[1:13:01] to read it in a minute and it has to do
[1:13:04] with eyes
[1:13:05] and and so forth and uh and I preached
[1:13:09] at his church

[1:13:13] then I came home I got home that Monday
[1:13:15] I went to work just excited just excited
[1:13:19] and then Wednesday came
[1:13:22] which would have been August the 3rd
[1:13:25] can't wait to go to church

[1:13:29] understand sometimes you just get a
[1:13:31] sermon you just can't wait to preach

[1:13:48] around down I swear I need to put this
[1:13:51] down before they come so I ain't got to
[1:13:52] crawl up under there and I just start
[1:13:54] shooting quarter around but it was it
[1:13:57] was Walnut crawled around hard
[1:13:59] and I was shooting it

[1:14:05] said maybe I need to press the gun that
[1:14:07] hard I need to get this job done
[1:14:09] and I kept on shooting and I was down on
[1:14:11] my knee and then I said
[1:14:12] when I shot so
[1:14:16] literally like somebody just drew their
[1:14:19] hand back as far as they could get it
[1:14:21] and punch me in the face
[1:14:23] and I failed it where I was already on
[1:14:25] my knees and I was holding my face

[1:14:31] working with me he said uh you all right
[1:14:34] so I'm fine I'm fine
[1:14:37] he said uh all right all right
[1:14:40] that's it okay and then I got up and

[1:18:44] had just preached for Mike walls I told
[1:18:46] him I said brother Mike pray

[1:18:52] in North Carolina
[1:18:54] at Joe Greene and he prayed for brother
[1:18:57] Burley so in that prayer immediately
[1:18:59] started going

[1:20:10] he said but
[1:20:12] you can preach to us
[1:20:13] that was a mistake on his part
[1:20:19] so I'm laying here
[1:20:23] doctor there Nurse there they said you
[1:20:26] can preach to us
[1:20:29] I said okay
[1:20:32] I'm just showing how all of this worked
[1:20:34] up
[1:20:35] now
[1:20:37] I said Doctor
[1:20:40] whistle no the paramedics told him what
[1:20:42] I said because when the paramedics
[1:20:44] picked me up on the way to the
[1:20:47] hospital I told him I was preaching
[1:20:50] tonight on eyes
[1:20:52] they said really I said now this happens
[1:20:54] to me
[1:20:55] he said wow so they told the doctor that
[1:20:58] so when the doctor came he said well I
[1:21:00] did hear you was going to preach your
[1:21:01] eyes tonight I said I sure was he said
[1:21:04] well you can preach to us
[1:21:05] I said okay I will
[1:21:08] so now
[1:21:10] I read this quote
[1:21:12] I'm gonna read it to you are we all
[1:21:15] right
[1:21:18] just come from the lay of the sea in
[1:21:20] church day these things you might know
[1:21:22] but this is where my inspiration comes
[1:21:24] from
[1:21:26] but barely said the name Leah The Seer
[1:21:30] which means people right
[1:21:32] well very common
[1:21:34] and it was given to several cities and
[1:21:36] earned a royal ladies so named
[1:21:39] he said this city was one of the most
[1:21:42] politically important and financially
[1:21:44] flourishing cities in Asia Minor
[1:21:47] enormous amount of property was
[1:21:50] bequitted to them to the City by
[1:21:52] prominent citizens
[1:21:54] then he said it was the seat of a great
[1:21:56] medical school
[1:21:58] people was distinguished in the Arts and
[1:22:01] Science
[1:22:02] for some reason
[1:22:04] this this quote
[1:22:06] great medical school I remembered that
[1:22:08] quote so when I was in Virginia I looked
[1:22:11] this I said great Medical School great
[1:22:13] medical school
[1:22:14] so I decided to do some history research
[1:22:17] on laodicea like I said some of you
[1:22:19] might know this
[1:22:20] I wonder what was the medical school was
[1:22:23] so as I began to research
[1:22:26] I found now I'm telling the doctor this
[1:22:31] he said do you know where in Atlanta to
[1:22:33] see an age
[1:22:34] he said he said that's funny we are
[1:22:36] studying on the Book of Revelation I
[1:22:38] said no I said I said now you might read
[1:22:41] Ephesus and Smyrna and just call them
[1:22:43] churches I said but they're Church ages
[1:22:46] sir I said when we're in the lay of the
[1:22:48] sin age he said okay okay okay I said
[1:22:51] but now in in this scripture I said the
[1:22:54] Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 3
[1:22:57] he said I canceled D to buy me gold try
[1:23:00] to find that those men be rich and write
[1:23:02] Raymond that means be clothed and the
[1:23:05] same in our nakedness does not appear
[1:23:06] and the eyes were I found that thou May
[1:23:10] is see what's so funny I got to read the
[1:23:13] scripture now but when I was laying on
[1:23:15] that the the doctor's bed I quoted it
[1:23:18] verbatim that's how I known it I was and
[1:23:22] I just quoted it that's the doctor that
[1:23:24] you notice he said I sound
[1:23:26] he said yeah I said you're eye doctor he
[1:23:29] said yeah I said this is what I was
[1:23:31] going to preach on I said but the age
[1:23:33] we're living in is called a layer of the
[1:23:35] sin age
[1:23:36] I said now the doctor I said God speaks
[1:23:40] it's just anointing just came
[1:23:43] I said Doctor God speaks to us
[1:23:46] he take things we can relate to so he
[1:23:50] can speak to us he said okay I said for
[1:23:53] instance sir you're a doctor
[1:23:56] I said now God could use Dr terms to
[1:23:59] catch your attention something you could
[1:24:01] relate to he said right I said no let me
[1:24:04] give you some examples sir I said let's
[1:24:06] use Peter for an example I said did you
[1:24:09] know Peter was an expert fisherman
[1:24:12] he said okay I said Jesus
[1:24:15] use fishing to get Peter's attention he
[1:24:19] said okay I said you remember sir I said
[1:24:22] Peter knew in the Book of Luke Peter
[1:24:25] knew was out fishing
[1:24:26] I said they caught nothing
[1:24:28] they toilet all night they caught
[1:24:30] nothing
[1:24:31] I said but then Jesus when he finished
[1:24:33] ministering I said Jesus told Peter and
[1:24:36] him cast your net to the right
[1:24:39] I said Peter said but we called all
[1:24:41] night and caught nothing I said think
[1:24:44] about this doctor I said Jesus knew what
[1:24:46] he was doing he knew Peter was an expert
[1:24:48] fisherman so he used that to catch
[1:24:51] Peter's attention I said now Peter being
[1:24:54] an expert said now I know the fish is
[1:24:58] not bad we ain't caught nothing ain't
[1:25:00] nothing there can't be I said but he
[1:25:03] didn't realize he was talking to the
[1:25:05] expert
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ
[1:25:08] I said what did Jesus say cast that net
[1:25:10] to the right and then Peter said we told
[1:25:13] him so forth but nevertheless according
[1:25:15] to Thy word I said now doctor you
[1:25:16] remember they come up with a big drought
[1:25:18] he said okay that's right I said but
[1:25:20] look what he did he used Peter's job
[1:25:25] to minister to him
[1:25:27] I said all right I said let me give you
[1:25:29] some more examples I said the same thing
[1:25:31] with Jonah I said Jonah in the days of
[1:25:35] Jonah I said he sent Jonah to some
[1:25:37] people to witness to him I said they
[1:25:39] worship a whale
[1:25:40] they worship a fish God I said what more
[1:25:43] actually God could do and let Jonah go
[1:25:46] into the mouth of a fish
[1:25:48] and then that's the god that they
[1:25:51] worship and now here comes Jonah the
[1:25:53] fish their God spitting him out right in
[1:25:55] front of them as they're going to make
[1:25:57] them we're going to listen to this man
[1:25:58] Our God as soon as a God so we need to
[1:26:02] listen to this man I said that's how God
[1:26:04] speaks he uses things we can relate to
[1:26:07] he said okay I said now just like
[1:26:09] Jeremiah he told him go down to the
[1:26:11] Potters he's doing the work on the wheel
[1:26:14] what he doing showing him something
[1:26:16] natural to relate to to apply to
[1:26:19] something spiritual he said
[1:26:22] that's good that's right I just kept on
[1:26:25] going just laying it all out
[1:26:28] and I said now here's the thing doctor
[1:26:31] I said lay of the seal
[1:26:33] God used the I said to get their
[1:26:36] attention
[1:26:37] because what I found out when he God
[1:26:40] told him and to anoint their eyes with
[1:26:43] Isaiah and when brother Bella talk about
[1:26:45] that was a great medical there was high
[1:26:48] medical things actually that was their
[1:26:51] expertise
[1:26:53] in laodicea they actually had Isaiah
[1:26:57] where people would come from all around
[1:26:59] the world
[1:27:01] and they said it was something about
[1:27:03] them that I sell to you it was like a
[1:27:05] miracle would open people's eyes and
[1:27:08] that's what people came to let her they
[1:27:09] see her for he said really I said yes
[1:27:13] sir I said but God used that to them to
[1:27:17] tell them
[1:27:18] their eye problem you got
[1:27:20] your eye self can't fix it but the I
[1:27:24] said I want to kick you
[1:27:26] if we'll fix it and the doctor like
[1:27:29] whoa that's what you see he let them
[1:27:31] know I said this age doctor that's all
[1:27:34] your education all your learning all
[1:27:37] those things ain't gonna get you closer
[1:27:38] to God I said that God got some eye
[1:27:41] sound God got some bomb God got some
[1:27:44] word that he can give I said that'll be
[1:27:46] the only thing going to open your eyes
[1:27:48] and he said whoa
[1:27:52] I said now I said now doctor from what's
[1:27:54] Happening what I'm seeing as I believe
[1:27:56] God allowed this to happen to me to
[1:27:58] preach to you he said I believe you are
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:03] can we say praise the Lord
[1:28:05] this might seem a little Elementary to
[1:28:07] you but it means a lot to me
[1:28:09] how God speaks
[1:28:12] God can deal with you on something that
[1:28:15] you relate to
[1:28:16] to get your attention if anybody hears a
[1:28:19] carpenter or a building you know what
[1:28:21] I'm talking about
[1:28:22] God will deal with you you know if you
[1:28:25] true the church you to the trade you
[1:28:27] build something crooked
[1:28:29] God's going to speak to you
[1:28:32] you're gonna be like
[1:28:34] I can just straighten it out as I go
[1:28:37] that's what I do you know
[1:28:39] it's gonna be painful
[1:28:41] until you finish the job you have to cut
[1:28:43] everything crooked to make it seem like
[1:28:46] it's right but when it comes to the end
[1:28:48] of the day it's crooked
[1:28:49] so God will deal with you and say no
[1:28:51] tear it down Square it up now everything
[1:28:54] will go smooth that's Construction
[1:28:56] if you start off wrong you're going to
[1:28:58] end up wrong but boy I know you know
[1:29:00] what I'm talking about
[1:29:02] if it's out of square guess what you're
[1:29:04] going to build it out of the square now
[1:29:06] it might look good she's like oops still
[1:29:08] look good but somebody that's in the
[1:29:10] trade sooner they look they say that's
[1:29:12] out of square yeah you know it but don't
[1:29:15] nobody else know it
[1:29:16] if that's not right
[1:29:18] you just turn around you fix it and you
[1:29:21] make it right
[1:29:22] see God speaks through things like that
[1:29:25] that's crooked it's leaning no standing
[1:29:27] it up praise the Lord I'll tell you I
[1:29:29] don't see a lot of carpentry work and I
[1:29:31] know they didn't do it right they tried
[1:29:33] to
[1:29:35] it's painful trying to make something
[1:29:37] wrong try to make it go right when you
[1:29:39] need to go fix it make it right so it'll
[1:29:41] go right
[1:29:43] are you with me let me just keep going
[1:29:45] on here
[1:29:47] so
[1:29:48] I began to preach to this man
[1:29:52] and then God began to deal with me
[1:29:56] I sat back
[1:29:58] you're talking about painful
[1:30:01] that was very that was painful
[1:30:03] it was irritating
[1:30:06] but I did know it was a reason and it
[1:30:09] was a purpose
[1:30:10] and and then studying a subscriptor that
[1:30:15] you were very well familiar with God
[1:30:18] began to deal with me
[1:30:20] in Psalms 23 it says that I prepares the
[1:30:24] table before me in the presence of my
[1:30:25] enemies
[1:30:27] thou known as my head with oil and my
[1:30:29] cup runeth over I always wondered when
[1:30:33] David said thou anointed my head with
[1:30:35] oil so when all this I'm going through I
[1:30:39] just begin to study and look this up and
[1:30:42] I found out that Shepherds David is
[1:30:45] speaking Shepherd terms that they
[1:30:47] literally would put oil in the sheep
[1:30:49] head
[1:30:51] and then I said interesting then they
[1:30:54] begin to explain why you know sheeps
[1:30:57] they can get a parasite you know they
[1:30:59] can get it anywhere in their body but
[1:31:01] mostly a lot of time they'll get it in
[1:31:03] their head
[1:31:04] they said that's why sometimes if you
[1:31:06] see a sheep and he'd be beating his head
[1:31:09] on a fence or scrubbing it hitting it on
[1:31:12] the fence what don't happen some
[1:31:14] parasites don't got up in there and it's
[1:31:16] driving them crazy
[1:31:18] but if his head was anointed
[1:31:21] them things couldn't have got there it
[1:31:23] couldn't mess with his mind it couldn't
[1:31:24] make him beat his head up
[1:31:27] myself
[1:31:28] that's interesting
[1:31:30] now anoint my head
[1:31:33] with oil
[1:31:34] because when we are not anointed friends
[1:31:36] you remember the greatest battles fault
[1:31:38] is in the mind
[1:31:40] so when you're not ignoring it and when
[1:31:42] I started this when I started seeing
[1:31:44] people now beating the head on a lot of
[1:31:46] things and complaining about this I
[1:31:48] don't know what's going on I don't know
[1:31:49] what's happening what's going on I said
[1:31:51] they ain't got no anointing on their
[1:31:53] head
[1:31:55] a nut in my head with oil
[1:31:58] that's why we have to stay anointed
[1:32:00] that's God to anoint us so we can think
[1:32:03] right can we say amen and there's
[1:32:05] another thing the prophet said he said
[1:32:07] when they were coming out
[1:32:08] when that was coming out of Egypt
[1:32:12] he was talking about the Revival and the
[1:32:14] thing that they was having
[1:32:18] he said they come across the Red Sea and
[1:32:21] when they got across the Red Sea
[1:32:23] and he said they were caught up in the
[1:32:25] spirit
[1:32:26] he said but when all that excitement
[1:32:28] went down then they started taking
[1:32:31] thought then they start complaining what
[1:32:33] are we going to eat what are we going to
[1:32:35] do because as long as they was in the
[1:32:37] spirit watching The Miracles of God what
[1:32:39] God done the Pharaoh they didn't think
[1:32:41] about things like that
[1:32:43] that's the same thing we need to do
[1:32:44] brother sister get get come in the
[1:32:46] spirit of what God is doing in this day
[1:32:49] all them fat we ain't gonna have time to
[1:32:51] think about all the other things that's
[1:32:52] going on around the message
[1:32:54] could we say man because in this
[1:32:56] generation in the town we're living in
[1:32:58] it was a season people want to puncture
[1:33:01] everybody around the message that's
[1:33:03] falling
[1:33:05] this one failed this one failed this
[1:33:07] one's failed I think that's wrong we
[1:33:09] need to point to the one that's standing
[1:33:12] we can build testimony yeah they might
[1:33:14] fall it but look who is standing in this
[1:33:16] day because God got a bride that's going
[1:33:18] to stand in this day it ain't about our
[1:33:21] who fall it's who's standing and we're
[1:33:24] standing by the grace of God not by our
[1:33:26] own marriage
[1:33:29] can we say praise the Lord
[1:33:32] I'm just getting started
[1:33:35] amen but I'm in Gilead
[1:33:42] let me just go down here
[1:33:45] when brother Baylor talks about the bomb
[1:33:47] in Gilead
[1:33:48] because what I was going through you you
[1:33:51] you think of medical stuff
[1:33:54] because I'm going through it
[1:33:56] but what y'all probably I think for the
[1:33:59] chat knew it was more than just my eye
[1:34:03] that I was going through
[1:34:05] from December of last year
[1:34:08] I was going through a series with my
[1:34:12] mouth but this been going on for four
[1:34:14] years I had got a bad gum disease it was
[1:34:18] and it was just send toxins in my body
[1:34:21] you weak all kind of stuff people kept
[1:34:23] telling me you need to get it fixed I
[1:34:25] said I know I need to get it fixed just
[1:34:27] it's gonna happen
[1:34:28] so I went through a bunch of frustration
[1:34:31] with oral surgeons and dentists and it
[1:34:34] just it was just getting frustrated so I
[1:34:36] just want to say just forget all of it
[1:34:37] but either way it just worked out so all
[1:34:40] of this was going on and then
[1:34:43] I got all of this straight now not the
[1:34:46] surgery
[1:34:47] but when I was getting ready to have the
[1:34:49] surgery
[1:34:50] that's when this happened from my mouth
[1:34:52] so now I got two things going on
[1:34:55] and you're talking about frustration
[1:34:57] I was frustrated to the Mac people would
[1:35:01] always call me and I appreciated it but
[1:35:03] my response was always I'm frustrated
[1:35:06] but not depressed because if I knew if I
[1:35:10] got depressed that's just gonna really
[1:35:12] break me up more worse than what it was
[1:35:14] so I was just trusting in the Lord
[1:35:17] so what was going on
[1:35:19] I had everything set up to get my mouth
[1:35:21] taken care of anybody who got implants
[1:35:26] that's some terrible stuff
[1:35:29] I got eight of them
[1:35:31] that's that's
[1:35:33] the things they can do to your mouth I
[1:35:35] don't even
[1:35:36] know
[1:35:39] it was just
[1:35:41] tears pain a lot went with it but I I
[1:35:45] never blamed God
[1:35:47] I kept my faith that everything is going
[1:35:49] to work out just fine
[1:35:52] now
[1:35:56] I want to read something to you
[1:35:58] I got a lot
[1:36:02] when brother Banner talking about the
[1:36:04] bomb in Gilead
[1:36:07] I realized he he called it the Holy
[1:36:10] Ghost
[1:36:10] he'll call it the word he referred to it
[1:36:13] in different things of what the bomb and
[1:36:15] Gilead is
[1:36:17] and what he says here
[1:36:20] and go away Jesus
[1:36:22] he said there's more to Ministry than
[1:36:24] Divine Healing
[1:36:26] he said the sickest body I know of
[1:36:28] tonight
[1:36:29] is the so-called Body of Christ
[1:36:31] it needs spiritual healing
[1:36:35] now I heard this quote preaching
[1:36:38] different ways
[1:36:40] I know some say
[1:36:42] the Bride of Jesus Christ is not sick
[1:36:45] because the word has came that is true
[1:36:48] that is 100 true it still don't take
[1:36:51] away from the quote but still
[1:36:53] unfortunately there are some still
[1:36:55] amongst the body of Christ is sick
[1:36:58] and because their faith is not where it
[1:37:00] needs to be
[1:37:01] so we can't take away what the prophet
[1:37:03] said this is what he said I believe the
[1:37:05] healing of the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:37:07] the opening of the word that he give us
[1:37:09] but as an individual you have to take
[1:37:12] that word yourself
[1:37:14] because in church we're on different
[1:37:16] levels that one thing you could never do
[1:37:19] and some try to present that we're all
[1:37:21] on the same level
[1:37:23] when we're not
[1:37:25] can we say man I can preach to you the
[1:37:29] pride The Pride The Pride The Pride the
[1:37:30] bride the bride if you ain't careful
[1:37:32] unless it's true but sometimes you got
[1:37:35] people no they ain't nowhere near they
[1:37:37] need to be and then living in a sinful
[1:37:39] condition they say well I'm bride but
[1:37:41] I'm yet I'm a sinner
[1:37:42] no they have to come to a reality where
[1:37:44] they at first
[1:37:46] I need Jesus Christ I believe you're
[1:37:49] predestinated to be the bride but right
[1:37:51] now I ain't living the life I ain't I
[1:37:53] ain't where I need to be but I'm gonna
[1:37:55] get there so you have to be careful
[1:37:57] about those things
[1:37:59] can you say praise the Lord so I believe
[1:38:01] exactly what the prophet said because
[1:38:03] our healing it is in the word about us
[1:38:06] receiving the word that makes us no
[1:38:08] longer sick
[1:38:12] praise the Lord he said there is only
[1:38:15] one bomb
[1:38:16] that I know that will heal
[1:38:19] and that's the word
[1:38:22] and that's the sick body that we want to
[1:38:24] stand up in the strength in the vitamin
[1:38:27] in the power of the Gospel that's why I
[1:38:30] use much of my time now I'm trying to
[1:38:32] strengthen the church so he's saying
[1:38:34] yeah it's sick but here's the healing
[1:38:36] here's what the strength comes from it's
[1:38:38] in the word
[1:38:40] and then I read to you earlier where he
[1:38:43] want to get the uh mess with the faith
[1:38:45] in this generation of the young people
[1:38:47] to lose faith in what the word because
[1:38:49] Satan know if I can get them to lose
[1:38:51] faith in the word I got him
[1:38:54] can we say praise the Lord
[1:38:56] so when he began to talk about the bomb
[1:38:58] it's also the word
[1:39:00] I begin to look into the scripture just
[1:39:03] follow with me
[1:39:05] I said everything that we have need of
[1:39:07] is in the word of God and Genesis 37
[1:39:12] what we read earlier uh let me just read
[1:39:15] it again
[1:39:17] we look in Joseph's life
[1:39:19] and we know Joseph life type Jesus
[1:39:21] Christ we know he's dead but what's
[1:39:23] interesting to me how God pre-planned
[1:39:26] things way ahead
[1:39:29] in the believer's life knowing they're
[1:39:31] going to go through hard times but God
[1:39:33] is just pre-planaged
[1:39:35] in in Joseph's life I don't want to read
[1:39:37] all of it I want to go down here to
[1:39:41] back to Genesis 37
[1:39:46] let's go to verse 23 again it said it
[1:39:48] came to pass when Joseph was coming to
[1:39:50] his Brethren they spilled Joseph out of
[1:39:52] his coat his coat of many colors that
[1:39:55] was on him which we know that types the
[1:39:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:59] and they took him and they cast him into
[1:40:01] a pit and the pit was empty
[1:40:04] there was no water in it now I want to
[1:40:07] skip this go to verse 25. they sat down
[1:40:09] to eat bread they lifted up their eyes
[1:40:11] and looked and behold a company of
[1:40:14] Israelites came from Gilead with camels
[1:40:16] bearing spicery and bomb and myrrh going
[1:40:20] to carry it down to Egypt when I read
[1:40:23] the scripture
[1:40:24] so much has popped out to me
[1:40:28] we see what they was doing to Joseph
[1:40:30] Joseph was in a bad situation
[1:40:33] semen
[1:40:35] but God was behind every bit of this
[1:40:39] even Joseph didn't understand what he
[1:40:42] was going through at that moment his
[1:40:44] brother rejected him just the same as
[1:40:47] the Jews rejected Christ if you notice
[1:40:49] what kind of spices they had when they
[1:40:52] came to pick Joseph up
[1:40:55] look what God did let's read it again
[1:40:58] it says here verse 25.
[1:41:01] now to eat bread they lifted their eyes
[1:41:04] and looked and behold a company of
[1:41:07] ishmaelites came from where Gilead
[1:41:10] that's called The Prophet preached a
[1:41:13] message there's a bomb in Gilead so I
[1:41:15] went back and looked up Gilead and
[1:41:18] Gilead is the place where the bomb comes
[1:41:21] from
[1:41:22] now look at the mind of God
[1:41:25] he didn't they sitting there eating
[1:41:27] wondering what they gonna do God had all
[1:41:30] that pre-planned let them sit down and
[1:41:33] eat now you got these ishmaelites coming
[1:41:36] with bomb with spices and they seeing
[1:41:40] them coming God time every bit of that
[1:41:42] perfectly so they can pick Joseph up
[1:41:47] cause Joseph remember Joseph him type in
[1:41:51] Christ and Christ is also the bomb of
[1:41:53] Gilead God was sending Joseph down there
[1:41:57] before they brother they didn't realize
[1:41:59] the thing that was going to save them
[1:42:01] they were sinning it before them before
[1:42:03] they got there it's all that person this
[1:42:06] is so perfect in the economy of God that
[1:42:09] yeah they had spices and bombs but
[1:42:11] Joseph actually was the true bomb that
[1:42:14] God used the Israelites to get him down
[1:42:17] there so that his Brethren the Jews
[1:42:19] later on Joseph will become their bomb
[1:42:22] they needed Joseph
[1:42:25] so things that you go through in life
[1:42:28] God you can't see it at the time but God
[1:42:31] don't preplaying everything and when you
[1:42:33] get down to the bottom of the road he'll
[1:42:35] take you back say this is why I did this
[1:42:37] and I'll tell you out of all that I went
[1:42:40] through that's what I look back to now I
[1:42:42] know I got done with let what happened
[1:42:45] to me happened literally it brought me
[1:42:48] closer
[1:42:49] to God
[1:42:52] that's what it does let me say praise
[1:42:55] the Lord
[1:42:56] he said the bomb is the word
[1:42:59] so when I look into the scriptures
[1:43:01] Psalms 107
[1:43:03] it says then they cry unto the Lord in
[1:43:06] their trouble
[1:43:08] he saved them out of their distresses
[1:43:12] and that word distresses it means
[1:43:14] straightness straight stress distress
[1:43:17] they say he saved the mind of the
[1:43:19] distress when they call unto the Lord
[1:43:21] and verse 20 said it tells us how did he
[1:43:24] saved them he said he sent
[1:43:27] his word
[1:43:29] and healed them and delivered them from
[1:43:32] all their destruction everything that we
[1:43:35] need is in the message I don't care what
[1:43:37] you're going through what situation what
[1:43:39] problem if you go back to the word God
[1:43:42] got a word in this message it'll save
[1:43:44] you from all your distresses it's there
[1:43:47] praise the Lord
[1:43:49] and then in Matthew chapter 8
[1:43:52] it said when Jesus was entering into
[1:43:53] Capernaum there came into him a
[1:43:56] centurion beseeching him
[1:43:58] saying Lord my servant lies at home sick
[1:44:01] of the palsy grievously tormented
[1:44:04] Jesus said unto him I will come and heal
[1:44:08] him the ceterian answer he said Lord I
[1:44:11] am not worthy that thou should come
[1:44:12] under my roof and then he said speak the
[1:44:15] word only
[1:44:17] in my servant shall be healed he even
[1:44:21] realized where the bomb was at it was in
[1:44:24] the word he realized what healing was at
[1:44:26] and then Jesus responded back he said
[1:44:28] when Jesus said the scripture said when
[1:44:31] Jesus heard it he mobbed and said to
[1:44:33] them that followed barely I said to you
[1:44:35] I have not found such great faith no not
[1:44:39] in Israel
[1:44:41] a gentile had that kind of faith in
[1:44:43] Israel didn't have it he said just speak
[1:44:45] the word what he did he recognized what
[1:44:48] the authority was in the word that's why
[1:44:50] in this day and time the devil knows
[1:44:53] what the authority is at in this time
[1:44:55] that's why he attacked this message so
[1:44:57] hard because he know this is what
[1:44:59] defeats him
[1:45:02] amen
[1:45:03] that's why we have to stay true to it
[1:45:07] so the bomb
[1:45:08] is the word and there is a bomb in
[1:45:11] Gilead
[1:45:13] and then Matthews also says
[1:45:16] verse 16 Matthew chapter 8 verse 16 said
[1:45:18] when Eden was come
[1:45:20] hey brother to him meaning that was
[1:45:22] possessed with devils
[1:45:23] and he cast out the spirits
[1:45:26] with his word
[1:45:28] and he healed all the all that was sick
[1:45:31] he did it with his word so there is a
[1:45:35] bomb in Gilead and I call this message
[1:45:37] of the hour it is the bomb in gilk
[1:45:41] Gilead
[1:45:42] no
[1:45:44] I might say something and I'm not trying
[1:45:46] to say it to be official
[1:45:50] but the confidence I have in the Holy
[1:45:52] Ghost
[1:45:56] I believe
[1:45:58] even marriage life
[1:46:00] is the husband
[1:46:01] and a wife are both born again
[1:46:05] I believe that they just humble
[1:46:07] themselves
[1:46:08] God has straightened that marriage out
[1:46:11] and he'll do it with the word
[1:46:14] many try to try to make excuses for
[1:46:17] failures and marriage and failures and
[1:46:19] decent area some things don't really
[1:46:21] work with me because I know God has said
[1:46:25] a perfect word
[1:46:26] in this day
[1:46:28] and I believe it creates a perfect
[1:46:30] marriage
[1:46:31] now a perfect marriage that don't mean
[1:46:34] you don't have disagreements
[1:46:36] those things happen but I believe by
[1:46:39] both to be lying on the word of God in
[1:46:42] their life it keeps things bring things
[1:46:44] to Harmony and keep things the way they
[1:46:46] supposed to be because they're using the
[1:46:48] word
[1:46:49] in the marriage if it's hurt in the
[1:46:52] marriage the word can hurt heal it is
[1:46:54] there pain in the mind the word can heal
[1:46:57] it if people were just applied to
[1:46:59] themselves put it to themselves it'll
[1:47:01] come out right do you believe that
[1:47:03] tonight
[1:47:05] also believe
[1:47:07] because
[1:47:09] unfortunately
[1:47:13] many believed knowledge
[1:47:16] it's the new birth
[1:47:18] no it's not
[1:47:20] I've seen it too many times
[1:47:23] just meaning can break down Seven Seals
[1:47:27] trumpets and just I'm talking about 100
[1:47:29] accurately just the way the prophet
[1:47:32] taught it
[1:47:33] but yet they themselves don't have an
[1:47:35] ounce
[1:47:35] of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:40] you can't come up like that
[1:47:43] I believe
[1:47:45] I'm just speaking
[1:47:47] I'm not speaking directly here I'm
[1:47:48] speaking worldwide here
[1:47:50] but what I've seen don't happen
[1:47:52] especially down in the area where I'm
[1:47:54] from because we deal with a lot of
[1:47:56] situations that's coming up now I'm
[1:47:58] talking about even in older Saints
[1:48:00] I'm just coming to find out some built a
[1:48:04] house wrong
[1:48:05] they ain't have the right foundation
[1:48:07] they really never was born again
[1:48:11] and wondering why I keep fighting why I
[1:48:14] keep doing this why I can't overcome and
[1:48:16] I said let's go backwards for a moment
[1:48:18] how did you come into this message where
[1:48:21] did you start what what take me back if
[1:48:23] people get offended well I was just I
[1:48:25] raised up in this nuggets let's go back
[1:48:27] okay when did God deal with you when did
[1:48:29] God touch you what kind of experience
[1:48:31] what did you have explained that to me
[1:48:33] and when you start asking people certain
[1:48:35] things
[1:48:36] they can get to a play while I was just
[1:48:38] been in church all my life
[1:48:41] and that's what the problem is
[1:48:43] you've been in church all your life
[1:48:45] but you never received the Holy Ghost
[1:48:48] let Christ come in
[1:48:50] church is not salvation
[1:48:55] can you say Amen it's not we come here
[1:48:58] with a similar ourselves together but
[1:48:59] being born again Christ Having the Holy
[1:49:02] Spirit all right that's salvation that's
[1:49:04] what keeps us let me just read this
[1:49:05] quote to you
[1:49:09] are we all right
[1:49:10] it might not be jump shouting screaming
[1:49:12] but I'm just delivering my heart
[1:49:18] if I could find it right quick
[1:49:27] praise the Lord
[1:49:31] but a better say that man
[1:49:34] has come from the mission power decision
[1:49:37] I'ma tell you why I'm quoting
[1:49:39] pretty much this whole message
[1:49:41] because that's what God woke me up
[1:49:44] he woke me up Friday night said read it
[1:49:46] and I just got to read and it started
[1:49:48] answering a lot of questions I had
[1:49:50] he said if a man once anchors his heart
[1:49:57] of calorie
[1:49:59] because all the devils
[1:50:02] in hell but never Shake him no more
[1:50:06] he's there
[1:50:08] notice he cannot he that cannot stand
[1:50:12] chastise me isn't it illegitimate child
[1:50:16] he claims God to be his father when he's
[1:50:19] not just talked about by everywhere in
[1:50:21] the doctrine not stable and don't know
[1:50:24] where you're going double-minded and a
[1:50:26] lot of times double tongues
[1:50:28] I don't know where you're standing or
[1:50:30] what you're talking about then a man
[1:50:32] that's born again of the spirit of God
[1:50:35] knows exactly
[1:50:37] where he's at nothing phases him because
[1:50:41] something inside of him has already
[1:50:43] witnessed somebody outside the crowd
[1:50:47] Yonder and by faith he sees him
[1:50:51] amen so when we are anchored when we
[1:50:54] were born again and I know this is so
[1:50:56] Elementary but I'm just so convinced of
[1:50:58] the day worldwide that's what the
[1:51:01] problem of a lot of things don't happen
[1:51:03] people have not really received a new
[1:51:05] birth
[1:51:06] because when you receive a new birth
[1:51:08] nothing can shake you Knuckles can move
[1:51:11] you nothing can break you and these are
[1:51:13] sermons that don't got around the
[1:51:15] message because we don't got so educated
[1:51:16] people don't want to hear no more they
[1:51:19] want to hear something they're going to
[1:51:20] stir up their flesh make them jump shout
[1:51:22] kick and stream but what happens when
[1:51:24] you come down what kind of life are you
[1:51:26] living when you come down from there
[1:51:29] that's what I want to see
[1:51:31] can we say praise the Lord and I'll tell
[1:51:33] you brothers and sisters
[1:51:36] that's what we were kind of at today
[1:51:39] well it's 12 o'clock
[1:51:41] this might seem a little chopped up but
[1:51:43] brother sister there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:51:48] this is my
[1:51:50] third time actually being out preaching
[1:51:53] since all this happened to me
[1:51:56] and uh
[1:51:57] I've been a little careful
[1:52:00] did they tell you I don't supposed to
[1:52:02] get super excited and shout and calm
[1:52:06] down and all that kind of stuff
[1:52:08] you know I respect that into a degree
[1:52:11] because I was disobedient one time and
[1:52:15] it backfired me because I got to be very
[1:52:16] very careful
[1:52:18] I know I don't want to get no more pain
[1:52:20] than what I need
[1:52:22] so I kind of have to be a little bit
[1:52:23] reserved but you have a little respect
[1:52:25] because I don't want to go through that
[1:52:27] stuff no more I really really don't but
[1:52:30] I tell you
[1:52:32] Berlin Williams had have grown closer
[1:52:35] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:40] I was on the phone
[1:52:42] I'm just giving testimonies that okay
[1:52:44] I was on the phone
[1:52:46] with a young man
[1:52:48] last week
[1:52:50] he's going to blow his brains out
[1:52:54] when you're dealing with suicidal people
[1:52:59] you you're battling
[1:53:02] you're fighting for it
[1:53:04] you're trying to get ask God to give you
[1:53:06] the right thing to say to them and put
[1:53:09] some Spirits back from them because you
[1:53:10] can't you can't take that lightly when
[1:53:12] people think like that it's a demon
[1:53:17] and remember quote it was a guy that
[1:53:20] came to the altar Brother Bear and say I
[1:53:22] can't remember the message he said wait
[1:53:24] a minute
[1:53:24] he said something different about you
[1:53:27] he said oh there it is
[1:53:30] you see he was thinking on committing
[1:53:32] suicide
[1:53:34] he said if you wouldn't have came today
[1:53:36] you would have did it
[1:53:39] he said you would have did it
[1:53:41] so I don't take those things lightly
[1:53:44] so when you're dealing with somebody
[1:53:45] like that you got to take the word
[1:53:48] and try to pull them pull their thinking
[1:53:50] the right way
[1:53:52] and this young guy
[1:53:54] some of the statements that he made
[1:53:57] it it's this was a bruise away from his
[1:54:00] childhood life
[1:54:03] he said he said I don't even know what
[1:54:06] parent love is
[1:54:09] I can't find a happy spot
[1:54:12] and my life is just hating brood and
[1:54:15] arrogacy I said listen friend I said
[1:54:18] your problem is
[1:54:20] you say you forgive but you won't forget
[1:54:21] and you won't let go
[1:54:24] I said you have to let these things go
[1:54:26] because these Spirits are real the devil
[1:54:28] like to use people's weaknesses and
[1:54:31] things that they went through in life
[1:54:32] and try to bound them with it
[1:54:34] but you got to punt them to the remedy
[1:54:37] Christ why do you think in the Bible God
[1:54:40] recorded an insane man the maniac a
[1:54:42] gallery the meanest man or why you think
[1:54:45] all these messages are there it's to
[1:54:47] deal with different Spirits people go
[1:54:50] through
[1:54:51] now some people be like they must oh my
[1:54:54] mind's stronger than that I ain't gonna
[1:54:55] think about committing no suicide it's
[1:54:57] just you can't treat people like that
[1:54:59] there are different incidents in
[1:55:01] people's lives you got to deal with
[1:55:03] every one of them as a very serious case
[1:55:07] because it is
[1:55:09] but his whole suicidal Act
[1:55:12] is based upon what happened to him in
[1:55:15] his childhood life
[1:55:16] but my job as a minister didn't even ask
[1:55:20] a believer you take them to
[1:55:22] the true parent
[1:55:25] Jesus Christ your natural Parish might
[1:55:27] fail you but I can take you to one
[1:55:29] that'll never fail you
[1:55:31] I could take you to one he can ease all
[1:55:34] that pain you might not uh forget but he
[1:55:37] can take that pain away which you went
[1:55:39] through there's a bomb in Gilead he
[1:55:41] could take all of that away
[1:55:43] and I tell you how to finish talking to
[1:55:45] that young man
[1:55:46] that was a battle I was so empty my mind
[1:55:50] was spaced out because you literally was
[1:55:52] fighting Spirits from that individual
[1:55:55] and to say that
[1:55:58] we as a body of Jesus Christ
[1:56:02] when you go into something in your own
[1:56:04] personal life
[1:56:06] it'd be discouraging but I want to say
[1:56:08] something to encourage
[1:56:12] God will take you through something
[1:56:15] personally
[1:56:16] and you overcome it
[1:56:19] somewhere there in your life you're
[1:56:20] going to run into somebody
[1:56:22] going through the exact same thing
[1:56:24] you're going through and God will use
[1:56:27] you to minister to that person
[1:56:31] that's not the body of Jesus Christ's
[1:56:33] work
[1:56:35] me and Chad was talking
[1:56:38] y'all might know the story
[1:56:41] and I'll say this to minister some
[1:56:43] ministers know I'm sure you're aware of
[1:56:45] it
[1:56:46] when you can't get a message sometimes
[1:56:49] and you pray you can even fast
[1:56:52] and you can't find a channel
[1:56:54] you can't find nothing
[1:56:57] it was you just pressing and pressing do
[1:56:59] you define yourself one day preaching a
[1:57:02] sermon probably even way out of your
[1:57:04] thought pattern
[1:57:06] what God literally done to that Minister
[1:57:08] because people come to that church
[1:57:11] somebody's in the church is going
[1:57:13] through something but he used that
[1:57:14] minister to go through something so he
[1:57:17] can get a message to them people to that
[1:57:19] person
[1:57:20] that not just for preachers
[1:57:23] that's even for you
[1:57:25] that's how God uses the body
[1:57:28] how many you remember that story brother
[1:57:30] Branham speaking in tongues
[1:57:33] he went and go preach he told Billy them
[1:57:36] go on get somebody else to preach sing
[1:57:38] some songs something
[1:57:40] he said he just couldn't do it but then
[1:57:43] he said
[1:57:45] he heard somebody talking at the door of
[1:57:47] his uh
[1:57:48] room he said what voice is dead it's
[1:57:51] sound French or something he's white
[1:57:53] boss is dead he said then he realized it
[1:57:55] was him
[1:57:57] speaking in tongues
[1:57:59] he said what happened I yielded myself
[1:58:02] see what it was he had so he know he
[1:58:05] supposed to preach and his burden was so
[1:58:07] strong he went and yielded himself to
[1:58:09] God and when he yielded himself to God
[1:58:11] he started speaking in tongues he said I
[1:58:13] realized that was me
[1:58:15] he said in all certain the birthstone
[1:58:17] energy comes
[1:58:19] he takes off run down the hall and stop
[1:58:21] Billy Paul and went to the service but
[1:58:23] when he gets to the service he hear a
[1:58:25] testimony
[1:58:26] of a lady that was coming to the service
[1:58:28] and they hit a bump the doctors didn't
[1:58:31] want to do nothing for him no more he
[1:58:33] said then Blood start gushing out of the
[1:58:35] woman they was given the testimony and
[1:58:37] all of a sudden the blood stopped the
[1:58:39] woman get up start moving around he said
[1:58:41] what time what's that happen when it
[1:58:44] happened this is a woman he didn't even
[1:58:46] know
[1:58:47] right when they told him the time that
[1:58:50] it happened he said that was the time I
[1:58:52] was speaking in tongue he said God was
[1:58:55] using me to intercede for her
[1:58:59] that's so I connected
[1:59:01] the body of Christ actually is
[1:59:07] I need you
[1:59:09] and you need me
[1:59:11] if you are a predestinated part of the
[1:59:13] Bride of Jesus Christ we all need each
[1:59:17] other
[1:59:19] that's how those things work praise the
[1:59:22] Lord sometimes
[1:59:24] it goes on even on a higher level
[1:59:26] sometimes you might have a wonderful
[1:59:28] marriage and something's just kind of
[1:59:30] start going crazy a little bit like
[1:59:33] oh
[1:59:34] honey all right I'm fine but something
[1:59:36] seems wrong
[1:59:38] and then a little frictions come up but
[1:59:40] you overcoming
[1:59:41] you'll find yourself somebody gonna come
[1:59:44] through the same thing a brother because
[1:59:45] Hey Brother something's going on between
[1:59:47] my wife oh I know really I know exactly
[1:59:50] what you need to do brother just I went
[1:59:51] through that and you went through that
[1:59:53] sometimes people think preachers don't
[1:59:54] go through stuff we said brother I've
[1:59:56] been through that that happened to me
[1:59:58] and this will be their Deliverance
[2:00:01] that's our so well connected we are
[2:00:04] together the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:00:06] that's why elect don't persecute elect
[2:00:09] I need you you need me and I'll be
[2:00:12] honest with you brother and sister
[2:00:14] brother in the hood around the message
[2:00:16] the devil don't come between it
[2:00:18] but before we leave here in the Rapture
[2:00:21] all of that'll be restored
[2:00:24] it will have to be restored because this
[2:00:26] is a portion of the body of Jesus Christ
[2:00:28] we were just apportioning down here in
[2:00:30] South Carolina a portion over here but
[2:00:32] when we all come together we'll be as
[2:00:34] one
[2:00:35] but the little frictions
[2:00:38] God's breaking all these things down and
[2:00:41] he got ways of doing it
[2:00:43] and uh
[2:00:45] step into some things I was talking to
[2:00:46] your pastor earlier but this is part of
[2:00:48] my Ministry
[2:00:53] you got to remember gifts
[2:00:55] everything God called you for called me
[2:00:58] for it for one purpose
[2:01:00] it is the glorified Jesus Christ
[2:01:04] every fault every failure that we
[2:01:06] overcome is still is to glorified Jesus
[2:01:10] Christ
[2:01:11] I can glorify him in my faults
[2:01:14] I can give him the glory because he's
[2:01:16] the one that helped me with it and I'll
[2:01:18] be honest with you every one of us
[2:01:20] go through a life you'll have a fall in
[2:01:23] your life you got to kill
[2:01:26] and you might say brother Berta what do
[2:01:27] you mean by that
[2:01:29] who chose Saul
[2:01:31] the people did
[2:01:34] but why did they choose him
[2:01:37] they said we want a king
[2:01:39] to do what
[2:01:40] to fight our battles to go before us
[2:01:44] they chose someone to fight their
[2:01:46] battles to go before them they wanted a
[2:01:48] king
[2:01:50] I look at that scripture too
[2:01:53] you remember
[2:01:54] on the Saul's Administration he had
[2:01:57] gifted men
[2:01:58] following him
[2:02:00] and those gifted men was trying to kill
[2:02:03] David with Saul because why they was on
[2:02:07] a Saul's anointing
[2:02:09] right
[2:02:10] but you remember when Saul died the very
[2:02:13] men that was trying to kill David come
[2:02:15] to David
[2:02:17] and the Bible said they came together to
[2:02:20] make David King after Saul died
[2:02:24] right so under David's Administration
[2:02:27] they was able to the gifts that they had
[2:02:30] David put them in the right perspective
[2:02:31] for they to fight the battles of the
[2:02:34] Lord
[2:02:34] not to kill David
[2:02:36] so sometimes we can we can have a Saul
[2:02:39] in our life to fight all about it
[2:02:42] things that we choose Pride selfishness
[2:02:46] this is me I inherited this this couple
[2:02:49] of my parents this come from my family
[2:02:50] line sometimes people want to use
[2:02:52] excuses how they was born to try to
[2:02:54] reflect what they're doing now well you
[2:02:56] know my family you know the prophet said
[2:02:58] their strands and family my family got
[2:03:00] this kind of line just the way that we
[2:03:02] are and this is why I do what I do I'm
[2:03:04] here to tell you one thing that's
[2:03:06] missing in that statement when you were
[2:03:08] born again you break family experience
[2:03:13] so when you keep try to use those things
[2:03:16] this is why I do that it's a song you're
[2:03:18] trying to keep in your life
[2:03:19] that needs to be cut
[2:03:22] need to be killed
[2:03:25] praise the Lord and I'm putting we all
[2:03:28] got a song
[2:03:30] and he's got to die
[2:03:32] remember
[2:03:34] Temple Pride can help you they wanted a
[2:03:37] king to fight for them
[2:03:39] right
[2:03:40] so when you're being confronted about
[2:03:43] something you can raise up King Pride
[2:03:45] and fight for you King selfishness to
[2:03:48] fight for you living the songs you got
[2:03:50] to kill and put them up on a holy ghost
[2:03:52] Administration and kill all that stuff
[2:03:54] out of your life that the Holy Ghost
[2:03:56] kill those things out of your life
[2:03:58] it's all about character brothers and
[2:04:00] sisters
[2:04:01] not how much knowledge we got it's all
[2:04:03] about character
[2:04:06] praise the Lord that's why I loved it
[2:04:09] when I could see a sister in her place
[2:04:13] by the grace of God and a younger sister
[2:04:15] get out of her place
[2:04:17] that sister can go right to her talk to
[2:04:20] her
[2:04:21] sister can we talk
[2:04:23] minister to her say this is what I'm
[2:04:26] seeing that's the way it's supposed to
[2:04:28] be
[2:04:29] that's the way it's supposed to be
[2:04:30] instead of a man have to do it
[2:04:35] let me talk to you pull them aside
[2:04:39] that's like you're supposed to work in
[2:04:41] the body of Christ same thing with men
[2:04:43] see get a brother a brother brother in
[2:04:46] his place he could see uh something in
[2:04:48] the brother's life potential he said
[2:04:49] brother I need to talk to you about
[2:04:51] something the Lord put it on my heart
[2:04:52] that's how the Holy Spirit works
[2:04:55] it don't always have to come from the
[2:04:58] pulpit
[2:05:00] right the gift is Right amongst you
[2:05:01] where you can help each other they're
[2:05:04] there
[2:05:05] but the thing that has to happen we got
[2:05:08] to Die the more we die to ourselves the
[2:05:11] more God can use us for his glory for
[2:05:13] the help ones that even write a mix and
[2:05:16] amongst us
[2:05:17] my business is not to know what happens
[2:05:19] in this church
[2:05:21] I got enough of my own church to deal
[2:05:23] with I'm not trying to find out what's
[2:05:26] happening here no no no I stay right
[2:05:28] there in my church and we deal with what
[2:05:30] we need to deal with but this is what I
[2:05:32] do know the devil and talk out the devil
[2:05:35] that's in South Carolina is still the
[2:05:37] same devil up here in these areas too
[2:05:38] and he just want to divide conquer and
[2:05:41] Destroy that's the only thing he's
[2:05:43] interested in
[2:05:45] but we are the greatest people upon the
[2:05:48] face of this Earth why because God chose
[2:05:51] us for this age
[2:05:54] let me tell you everything God had
[2:05:56] predestinated for us to be he gonna get
[2:05:59] it
[2:06:01] and you can look in the mirror and look
[2:06:02] down on yourself all you want to you're
[2:06:04] looking in the wrong mirror God's gonna
[2:06:06] get it out of you and I'm telling you
[2:06:08] we're not going to leave this earth
[2:06:09] failures
[2:06:11] will lead this Earth over commerce
[2:06:14] but we learn from all of the things that
[2:06:18] we go through in life is just to prepare
[2:06:20] us for what he want us to be
[2:06:23] and I'll say this in close it
[2:06:26] Joseph I always go back to Joseph
[2:06:29] if there ever was a man
[2:06:32] could have paid people back that done
[2:06:34] him wrong was Joseph
[2:06:38] his brothers
[2:06:40] actually sitting in his hands
[2:06:43] because you just said kill him
[2:06:46] they would have did it
[2:06:47] but Joseph had went through so much God
[2:06:50] took him through so much to develop a
[2:06:52] character in him
[2:06:54] and he told his brothers
[2:06:56] don't be hurt don't be angry with
[2:06:58] yourself you didn't send me here
[2:07:00] they the one sold him but he said you
[2:07:03] didn't send me here
[2:07:04] God did
[2:07:05] God put me in this position for you to
[2:07:08] preserve your life but now he got power
[2:07:11] with character have y'all ever thought
[2:07:15] about it the woman that told the lion
[2:07:17] Joseph
[2:07:18] and Joseph come out of that dungeon
[2:07:20] if she was alive
[2:07:22] she had the bow to Joseph
[2:07:27] she's the one told the lie to get him
[2:07:28] down there
[2:07:30] but you know what I don't think Joseph
[2:07:32] would have done nothing to that woman
[2:07:34] because he realized you just used to get
[2:07:37] me where I need to be
[2:07:39] and so in all these things in life that
[2:07:40] we go through this apartment so many
[2:07:43] disappointment even in the ministry all
[2:07:45] these things God know how to shift you
[2:07:49] even a preacher
[2:07:51] sometimes a preacher might want to sit
[2:07:53] fit in a certain circle
[2:07:56] God could ruin that Circle to make him
[2:07:58] go independent to get him to himself so
[2:08:02] he can deal with the preacher
[2:08:04] he's just such a tender hand of God how
[2:08:06] he deal with each one of us differently
[2:08:09] but you have to catch it
[2:08:13] I see Lord will you shifted me or you
[2:08:16] put me in position you're the one doing
[2:08:18] it ain't me you are the one doing it and
[2:08:21] he do it through circumstances in people
[2:08:24] he knows how to do it because remember
[2:08:26] brothers and sisters out of everything
[2:08:28] that was happening in Joseph line God
[2:08:30] was not focused on Joseph's brothers
[2:08:33] he would focus on Joseph
[2:08:35] after he got Joseph or he wanted him
[2:08:38] then he turned his Focus to Joseph's
[2:08:40] brother and brought them to him
[2:08:42] can we say praise the Lord that's why
[2:08:45] all of my faults and my failures I can
[2:08:47] look back now and there are nothing but
[2:08:49] Stepping Stones
[2:08:50] that's what they are and I've been
[2:08:53] molded
[2:08:54] by the word of God and about the trials
[2:08:57] pressures in life God has really molded
[2:09:01] me
[2:09:01] but yet I'm still bold
[2:09:04] I still straight
[2:09:06] and I'm still confident and I'm a
[2:09:08] straight shooter
[2:09:09] but I got another character with it
[2:09:13] praise the Lord I won't compromise
[2:09:15] that's one thing I won't do I would not
[2:09:17] compromise this gospel I'll stay
[2:09:19] straight to it may God bless you can we
[2:09:22] get the Lord of hand
[2:09:31] trust us all as well as the heart talk
[2:09:34] with you
[2:09:36] I got so much I want to preach
[2:09:40] but it's just so much I just want to
[2:09:43] share that with you I'm not telling you
[2:09:46] at all
[2:09:47] was it fun and you know it was pretty
[2:09:50] bad a lot of things bad but ain't no
[2:09:52] need to get into all of that but I give
[2:09:55] God the glory
[2:09:56] for what he has done
[2:09:58] and I appreciate all your prayers all
[2:10:00] support I greatly appreciate it and and
[2:10:03] uh can nobody tell me
[2:10:06] God ain't good you can't do that
[2:10:09] I mean I can I can go all day long
[2:10:12] Supernatural things just lining up I'm
[2:10:14] just like wow wow
[2:10:16] but I appreciate I'm more indebted I'm
[2:10:19] I'm God I said God I just want to be
[2:10:21] more sold out I want to live for your
[2:10:24] bride I want to do whatever I can for
[2:10:26] your people
[2:10:27] because you blessed me you helped me
[2:10:29] make me more determined to consecrate
[2:10:32] myself less and be able to bring a word
[2:10:34] for his people we are some blessed
[2:10:37] people friends
[2:10:38] and God has a five-fold Ministry so I'm
[2:10:41] trying to destroy it but you never can
[2:10:43] destroy what God ordained
[2:10:45] God has a five four minutes he's going
[2:10:47] to preach this message
[2:10:48] so be encouraged can we say Amen
[2:10:51] musicians could come wherever Hard Times
[2:10:54] comes or whatever the devil brings just
[2:10:56] be encouraged and be like David I
[2:10:59] encourage myself
[2:11:01] in the Lord that's one of my favorite
[2:11:04] scriptures and and my wife would tell
[2:11:06] you
[2:11:08] when brother Burley is down
[2:11:10] my greatest place for me to be is in my
[2:11:13] study room
[2:11:15] I always just go right there
[2:11:17] sit right at my dish pop on the tape or
[2:11:20] look at my Bible but when I open my
[2:11:22] bible sometimes just read three words
[2:11:23] and I just come alive
[2:11:26] that's my comfort right there it is the
[2:11:28] word of God he's all I got
[2:11:30] that he's all I need

[2:11:47] just like the prophet sometimes
[2:11:50] to have the words
[2:11:52] to even express what you've done
[2:11:56] sometimes it's hard to find
[2:11:59] one thing we can express how thankful we
[2:12:02] are
[2:12:03] how much we praise you for what you've
[2:12:04] done
[2:12:06] and what you're doing and what you're
