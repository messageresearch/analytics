[35:57] traveling brother Dale as well in
[35:59] particular amen that God's grace would
[36:01] be with them both as you can see I'm
[36:03] dealing with yet another eye infection
[36:05] so as brother Chad says at least now I
[36:08] look like a real Pastor
[36:11] so so I think that's what matters most
[36:14] is if you look like one right no no
[36:17] that's not what matters most amen amen I
[36:20] sure appreciate you brother Chad that's
[36:22] okay that's okay amen it's good to be
[36:24] back here tonight though just trusting
[36:26] the Lord I'll just speak and encourage
[36:28] amen I know it's a very familiar
[36:30] scripture we've read it so many times
[36:31] but like I said before when you're
[36:32] preaching on something like the Holy
[36:34] Ghost well scriptures about the Holy
[36:35] Ghost you tend to read them a lot
[36:37] because they have so many different
[36:38] angles and and thoughts that you could
[36:40] focus on so we're going to take a
[36:41] different thought this evening than we
[36:43] have for a while amen John 14-6 says
[36:45] this and I will pray the father and he
[36:47] shall give you another comforter that he
[36:49] may abide with you forever even the
[36:52] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[36:54] receive because it seeth him not neither
[36:56] knoweth him but you know him for he
[36:59] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[37:01] let's jump down to verse 26 it says but
[37:03] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[37:06] whom the father will send in my name he
[37:08] shall teach you all things and bring all
[37:10] things into your to your remembrance
[37:12] whatsoever I have said to you peace I
[37:15] leave with you my peace I give unto you
[37:18] not as the world giveth I give it give I
[37:21] unto you let not your heart be troubled
[37:24] neither Let It Be Afraid let's continue
[37:26] on verse 28 he says ye have heard how I
[37:28] said unto you I go away and come again
[37:31] unto you if you loved me ye would
[37:33] Rejoice because I said I go unto the
[37:35] father for my father is greater than I
[37:38] and now I have told you before it come
[37:40] to pass that when it is come to pass ye
[37:45] might believe amen God bless you you can
[37:47] have your seats this evening and we're
[37:50] continuing our series of course on the
[37:51] Holy Ghost on the token life and I want
[37:53] to preach on the comforter tonight and
[37:55] we're going to take at least a couple
[37:56] services on this there's a whole lot to
[37:58] dig into amen but you know as I was
[38:00] thinking about this and I was sitting
[38:02] down in my office I thought what does
[38:03] comfort mean to us and you know we all
[38:06] have our own little definition of
[38:07] comfort but I think as new finlanders
[38:09] and people living in New Finland at
[38:11] least um we we have probably a common
[38:14] version of comfort and the comfort is
[38:16] usually when the wind is howling outside
[38:19] and it's either raining or snowing or
[38:21] both simultaneously and there's roads
[38:23] are slick or wet and nobody wants to go
[38:26] outside our our our picture of comfort
[38:28] is to sit in our living room with a
[38:31] fireplace on if we have it with a hot
[38:33] drink next to us and some snacks on the
[38:36] coffee table in front of us and we just
[38:39] relax we don't have to go do anything we
[38:42] don't have to we have no obligations we
[38:44] just get to sit there and we get to
[38:46] enjoy the comfort that we have amen
[38:48] we've got a roof over our head we've got
[38:50] warmth we've got heat we've got food
[38:52] we've got good Fellowship we've got our
[38:54] family around us and and everything is
[38:56] good we don't we aren't forced to go out
[38:58] into those sorts of things amen and then
[39:00] when we're all done with it all there's
[39:01] a warm bed waiting for us that's a
[39:03] comfort for us amen especially in a
[39:04] place that has a climate like we have
[39:06] here in newf land but you know for some
[39:08] of us our comfort may be different it
[39:10] may be that our bank account has
[39:12] thousands of dollars in it rather than
[39:13] the hundreds it used to and see once you
[39:15] get the thousands then your comfort
[39:17] becomes the tens of thousands and then
[39:19] maybe as you're getting close to
[39:20] retirement by God's grace you might have
[39:22] hundreds of thousands in there and your
[39:24] comfort is not so much in the money but
[39:26] what the money represents as you come to
[39:28] another place in your life and another
[39:30] season in your life some of us are
[39:32] Comforts are family that we have a
[39:34] closeness around us we have a family
[39:36] that's tight-knit we have a a church
[39:38] body we have a Ministry perhaps those
[39:41] sorts of things and we have all that
[39:42] comfort and support that we need and
[39:44] that's a great comfort to us you know
[39:45] when we went through covid-19 I I I
[39:48] guess it ought not to amaze me but I I
[39:50] there were so many people and talking to
[39:52] them at work and and covid-19 was so
[39:54] difficult for them and for me it
[39:56] honestly didn't have much of impact in
[39:58] some ways it was much better because
[40:00] what I got was all of my time was spent
[40:03] around
[40:03] Believers and that was a wonderful thing
[40:06] I didn't have any real loss of
[40:08] friendship or or spending time with
[40:10] people but that was the comfort that I
[40:12] needed at that point was the thing
[40:13] that's always with me which is the
[40:14] church body the body of Christ and so it
[40:17] was a great time for me in many ways you
[40:19] know we had Samuel born just three or
[40:21] four weeks before they shut everything
[40:23] down and it was one of the greatest
[40:24] things in Blanca's life I think was when
[40:26] the world shut down so she she could
[40:27] stay at home with her new baby it was a
[40:30] great comfort she didn't have to go
[40:31] around like that amen but the danger
[40:33] always comes when we focus on Comfort
[40:36] rather than growing and maturing amen
[40:39] when we focus so much on comfort and
[40:41] ease we tend to go two directions we
[40:43] either go overboard to try and get the
[40:46] Comfort or we stop trying in the first
[40:48] place to retain our comfort we rarely
[40:51] stay right in the middle because we
[40:52] don't want to be stretched to apply
[40:54] ourselves and we don't want to to to
[40:56] relax too much either brother brah said
[40:58] something very interesting when I was
[40:59] studying on this he says now we find all
[41:02] those things are because people are
[41:04] trying to find Comfort he was talking
[41:06] about alcohol he was talking about
[41:08] sensuality he was talking about all the
[41:09] pleasures of the world and the things
[41:11] that people do with their time and their
[41:12] money he says all those are because
[41:14] people are trying to find comfort and he
[41:16] says remember your comfort is your
[41:20] religion he says and you make those
[41:22] things your religion because people you
[41:25] find what they shift themselves to what
[41:27] they look for what they seek on a daily
[41:29] basis that is their comfort and it
[41:32] becomes their religion it becomes their
[41:34] belief system it comes the thing that
[41:35] drives them to get up in the morning or
[41:37] to not get up in the morning as the case
[41:39] may be it becomes a way of life it
[41:41] becomes a belief system for it but there
[41:43] Comes A Time there Comes a Day there
[41:46] comes a season where your comfort is
[41:47] going to be taken away where it's not
[41:50] going to do what it always did before
[41:52] amen the bank account starts to go down
[41:54] instead of up your health starts to fade
[41:56] sickness starts to come in families
[41:58] start to have internal feuds churches
[42:00] split Ministries fall they may fail they
[42:03] may leave all these things we there's no
[42:06] guarantee to the Christian uh to the
[42:09] believer that all of these things are
[42:11] always going to be there in the way that
[42:12] we want them amen and so what happens is
[42:15] when those things go down that's when we
[42:17] need a real Comfort because a real
[42:20] Comfort can't be lost when the
[42:22] circumstances
[42:23] change that's the that's what a real
[42:25] Comfort is is that it's there so that no
[42:27] matter what the circumstances are you're
[42:29] in a place of peace and rest and you're
[42:31] trusting and you're believing amen you
[42:33] look at Paul Paul never said that we'd
[42:36] never have hard times but Paul said I've
[42:38] never seen the righteous forsaken nor
[42:40] his seed begging bread and yet Paul's
[42:42] testimony was full of times where he was
[42:44] scared for his life and he was being
[42:47] rejected and he was being beaten and he
[42:48] was being put in prison and yet Paul
[42:50] knew what it meant to have a comforter
[42:53] so the comforter is not there to keep
[42:55] you from those situations it's to take
[42:57] you through those situations that's why
[42:59] we need a comfort amen that's the
[43:01] contrast to the hardship or the
[43:04] difficulty that we're going through when
[43:05] the sun is shining and the weather's
[43:07] nice and and there's lots of things to
[43:09] do kids don't need
[43:11] comfort kids don't come running to Mama
[43:14] when everything's good when do they come
[43:15] running to Mama when they're hungry when
[43:18] they've fallen down and scraped their
[43:19] knee or or falling off their bike and
[43:22] bang their head on the sidewalk like
[43:24] ours have done that's when they come
[43:26] running in for comfort and they're and
[43:27] what do they do they come up to Mama or
[43:29] daddy and they wrap them up in their
[43:31] arms and they hold them close and they
[43:33] they murmur soft and loving and soothing
[43:35] things to them or they give them the
[43:37] food they need and they bandage them up
[43:39] that's what Comfort is for it's not for
[43:42] the good times it's for the hard times
[43:44] amen comfort's always there for the
[43:46] difficulty time for the difficult times
[43:48] and so when Jesus said the comforter is
[43:50] coming what was he telling
[43:53] us good times are ahead no he's saying
[43:58] you're going to need a comforter that's
[44:00] why it's coming is because tough times
[44:02] are ahead hard times are ahead trial
[44:04] times are ahead and the whole church
[44:05] said I can't I'm so happy brother John's
[44:08] preaching on trials and tribulations
[44:09] tonight but the fact is if you've got a
[44:11] comforter it's for a reason and it's
[44:13] because times are going to be tough amen
[44:16] Jesus had told them all these things
[44:18] listen we we we read this before but he
[44:20] said these things have I spoken you he's
[44:23] told them all sorts of things good and
[44:25] bad he says these things have I spoken
[44:27] unto you that in me ye might have peace
[44:31] and then he says in the world you shall
[44:34] have tribulation see there's two places
[44:36] there's a place of peace and there's a
[44:38] place of tribulation and they are not
[44:40] one in the same place in him is peace
[44:42] and in the world is tribulation and you
[44:44] can be in those two places
[44:47] simultaneously he says but be of good
[44:50] cheer for I have overcome the world he's
[44:53] told them good things he's told them bad
[44:55] things amen but it look look he's
[44:57] telling them all these things he says
[44:58] cuz there's going to come a time where
[45:00] things look so bad and you don't know
[45:02] what's going on he says you're going to
[45:04] be you need to remember what I've told
[45:06] you when things look dark when things
[45:09] look like there's no way to come through
[45:11] them when everything is shattered you
[45:13] know when they're at that day of Calvary
[45:14] perhaps their entire Faith was shattered
[45:17] because everything they thought he would
[45:19] be everything they thought he would do
[45:21] he hadn't done it maybe the way they
[45:22] thought and he says you got to remember
[45:24] when that time comes there that your
[45:26] peace is in me it's not in what's
[45:28] happening in the
[45:29] world but look at his final words there
[45:32] he says be of good
[45:36] cheer Encourage
[45:39] Yourself when these times come when the
[45:42] good times come have the same attitude
[45:44] as when the bad times come that you can
[45:46] be at peace when these things happen
[45:49] that's what he's saying no matter what's
[45:51] happening be of good cheer amen we know
[45:54] that life isn't easy but sometimes we
[45:56] need a reminder that we're told it's not
[45:58] going to be easy for the believer in
[46:00] this world we've got to know what's
[46:02] coming down the road and it's not always
[46:04] going to be easy it's not always going
[46:06] to be simple amen why cuz God's
[46:08] developing character in you and I and
[46:11] character only comes through T trials
[46:14] and testing remember we we preached last
[46:16] service I think it was on the leyan
[46:19] church age the remedy that they were
[46:20] given was Godly character and that only
[46:23] comes through testing it comes through
[46:25] purification amen
[46:27] it's not easy here because we're
[46:28] pilgrims and strangers We Don't Belong
[46:32] we don't fit in and that makes it
[46:34] difficult amen but our comfort as he
[46:36] gives it here is that he's already told
[46:38] us it's coming and then he gave us a
[46:41] promise at the end what's his promise I
[46:45] have overcome the world whatever you've
[46:48] dealing with whatever you're facing
[46:50] whatever your struggles are whatever
[46:51] your sickness is whatever your hardship
[46:53] is I have already overcome it so what
[46:56] ever you're going through you can have
[46:58] rest that I will take you through it
[47:00] because I've already overcome like you
[47:02] said we're in time he's speaking from
[47:04] eternity but he pulls us through that
[47:06] time into eternity by a victory he's
[47:08] already given it's a finished work
[47:11] amen our comfort is that he told us it's
[47:14] coming and there's already a victory
[47:17] promised for
[47:18] it that's our comfort not that we're
[47:21] going to go through it easy but that
[47:22] when we go through it there's already a
[47:24] victory waiting for it brother R had
[47:26] this beautiful quote got just a couple
[47:28] little hooks this evening for this he
[47:30] says God has not promised a flowery bed
[47:32] of ease he says he promised a battle yes
[47:37] but he promised Victory that's the thing
[47:40] amen I don't want to spend this evening
[47:42] talking about the battles even though we
[47:43] will certainly for some time but the
[47:45] comfort for us tonight is that there's
[47:47] always a victory at the end of the
[47:49] battle no matter what it is whether it's
[47:51] sickness and whether it's financial
[47:53] hardship or marriages Church issues
[47:56] family issues whatever it might be there
[47:58] is Victory awaiting for us whether we go
[48:01] by way of the Grave or whether we
[48:02] continue here with the breath of life
[48:04] that he's given us he said you'll be in
[48:06] for a battle but there's always a
[48:08] victory that's waiting for the believer
[48:10] at the end of this amen he has already
[48:13] overcome those things you say well
[48:15] that's good for him what about me well
[48:17] he said you've got to be in me to get
[48:19] the victory you've got to be in me to
[48:21] have the peace it's in Christ that we
[48:23] have these things my rest is in Christ
[48:25] my peace is in Christ my joy is in
[48:28] Christ my victory is in Christ on my own
[48:30] I have no good thing here I'm not going
[48:32] to make it through but in him is where
[48:35] my peace and rest is amen I've got the
[48:36] victory through Jesus Christ my Lord
[48:39] he's the comforter he already declared
[48:41] that watch how Jesus phrases this
[48:44] statement as we go back to our
[48:45] scriptures that we started with because
[48:47] I want you to see how the Holy Ghost
[48:48] Will Comfort you amen mamas do it with
[48:51] hugs and they do it with kisses and they
[48:53] do it with treats and and bandages and
[48:55] these things but let's see what the
[48:56] comfort will do for us he says in John
[48:59] 14:26 but the comforter which is the
[49:02] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[49:04] my name he shall teach you all things
[49:07] and bring all things to your remembrance
[49:10] whatsoever I have said to you so he I
[49:13] I'm not here to say that the presence of
[49:15] God isn't to comfort it is I'm not here
[49:18] to say that the emotions and the and the
[49:20] feelings of the presence of God are are
[49:23] not of comfort they absolutely are amen
[49:26] I'm but what I'm telling you is that
[49:28] we've got to go to what the word says
[49:30] would be his
[49:31] comfort and his comfort here it comes
[49:34] two ways the comfort of the Holy Spirit
[49:36] comes I sorry I didn't click
[49:39] that maybe I went too
[49:42] far yes there we
[49:45] go he said what I will teach you and I
[49:50] will remind you that's the comfort of
[49:53] the holy spirit amen what will he teach
[49:56] you and everything that Jesus said and
[49:58] what will he remind you of everything
[50:01] that Jesus said and mean that is the
[50:03] comfort that we have if you want to know
[50:05] if the holy spirit is speaking he'll
[50:07] take you back to what Jesus said and if
[50:09] you want to know what to do in the
[50:10] situation he'll remind you of what Jesus
[50:13] said amen and he'll stir up your pure
[50:15] what Minds by way of remembrance amen
[50:18] but I want to say this tonight before we
[50:20] go too much further and brother Brandon
[50:21] would warn us of it that sometimes the
[50:23] worst inspiration comes in the most
[50:26] spiritual place
[50:27] places I can't tell you the things that
[50:30] I have people tell me come not
[50:32] necessarily here but I've come out of
[50:34] service and people have listened to the
[50:35] same sermon that I have and they come
[50:37] out with an idea and it's absolutely
[50:39] contrary to the
[50:40] word why because Satan is sitting in
[50:43] these pews trying to influence us
[50:46] because we know that Satan is a
[50:47] religious spirit to the believer and so
[50:51] everything he's doing is to get you just
[50:53] slightly off the word of God and so his
[50:56] inspiration will seem spiritual it will
[50:58] seem religious it will seem right amen
[51:01] he's trying to get us off of the track
[51:04] amen he's trying to get a wedge in there
[51:07] amen and we know that his inspiration
[51:08] will be so close that it will deceive
[51:10] the very elect if it were possible it
[51:13] won't deceive us but it's going to be so
[51:16] close it's almost impossible to discern
[51:18] it's going to take the Holy Spirit to do
[51:20] that and so that means that everything
[51:22] we hear everything we're inspired to do
[51:25] everything we have an unction to do we
[51:27] take it back to the word of God listen
[51:30] John said this he says beloved believe
[51:32] not every
[51:34] Spirit he says but try the spirits
[51:38] whether they are of God that means there
[51:40] are those that are and that means there
[51:41] are those that are not whether we like
[51:44] to believe it or not even within the
[51:46] church he says because many false
[51:48] prophets are gone out into the world see
[51:50] we look at that as Lord pre preserve us
[51:53] from the false prophets but what he's
[51:55] saying is you've got to realize those
[51:57] false prophets believe that they are
[51:59] true
[52:01] prophets others have not tried the
[52:04] Spirits by the word and they've got a
[52:06] Ministry now and it's taking not only
[52:08] them to hell but it's taking the people
[52:09] under their Ministry to Hell people got
[52:12] pulled away because they didn't test the
[52:15] spirit of their Revelation or their
[52:17] inspiration by the word of God we always
[52:21] check it with the word of God and you
[52:22] know so many times I know I've said this
[52:24] before it Bears repeating people people
[52:26] will say well the word doesn't say I
[52:28] can't do what I'm going to do and that
[52:31] may be true but you have to see what the
[52:33] effect of what you're going to do has
[52:35] because if it gets you into a place
[52:37] where you stop doing what the word says
[52:39] you're ought to do then that cannot be
[52:41] of God it cannot be the Holy Spirit
[52:42] leading to leading you and if it's
[52:44] changing you from what you ought to be
[52:46] into what you ought not to be again it
[52:48] cannot be of God Amen don't just look
[52:51] for the do Nots look for the dos and
[52:53] make sure that what you're doing doesn't
[52:54] keep you from doing what the word says
[52:56] for you to do as
[52:58] well Paul said this to Timothy he said
[53:00] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[53:02] God that means you can't throw one
[53:05] scripture
[53:06] out and it also means you have to take
[53:09] every single scripture into account amen
[53:13] that word inspiration it's funny because
[53:15] it's not actually the correct word
[53:18] inspiration means to take in but that
[53:21] word inspiration is actually supposed to
[53:24] be spiration in other words it's the
[53:27] breathing out of God in other words
[53:30] every the scripture is the breathing out
[53:32] of God Amen it's not breathed in by God
[53:35] it's breathed out by God it's his
[53:37] literal Breath of Life and then it is
[53:39] inspired into us he breathes it out and
[53:42] we breathe it in amen that's what it
[53:45] really is you know we sing that song
[53:47] this is the air I breathe that's
[53:49] literally what the word of God is it is
[53:52] the breath the life of God that's what
[53:54] it's saying right there amen he he
[53:56] breathes it out we breathe it in he says
[53:59] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[54:00] God and is profitable for Doctrine for
[54:03] reproof for correction and for
[54:05] instruction in righteousness that the
[54:07] man of God may be what perfect
[54:11] thoroughly fished unto all good works we
[54:14] preached last service we we preach all
[54:16] the time really that the holy spirit
[54:18] will only point you back to the word of
[54:20] God it will point you to thus sayith the
[54:22] Lord every time because that's what it
[54:25] is amen it'll take you back to the
[54:27] absolute that's what Jesus said the
[54:28] comforter will do it'll take you and
[54:31] it'll teach you and it'll remind you of
[54:33] what Jesus said but what's this effect
[54:35] of when he comes and teaches you and
[54:36] reminds you we read it in the opening
[54:39] scripture he said this peace I leave
[54:40] with you he says my peace my peace I
[54:45] give unto you not as the world giveth
[54:48] give I unto you he says the world can
[54:50] give you peace and then I can give you
[54:52] peace and they are not the one and the
[54:53] same thing he says look when I give you
[54:56] my piece this is the effect let not your
[54:58] trouble let not your heart be troubled
[55:01] neither Let It Be Afraid remember we
[55:03] read in this in the opening scripture he
[55:05] says when it comes to pass ye might
[55:07] believe Church By the time it's happened
[55:10] whether you believed or not is
[55:12] irrelevant so what's he trying to tell
[55:15] us he's saying when what I told you
[55:17] would happen happens let that Inspire
[55:20] your faith for the rest of the things
[55:21] that I told you were going to happen let
[55:23] your faith be built on faith let your
[55:25] faith be built bu on the experience of
[55:27] the reality of the word coming to pass
[55:29] so that for the next stage of your
[55:31] journey you'll believe for that and the
[55:33] next one and the next one so you can
[55:34] build line upon line word upon word here
[55:37] a little there a little and keep growing
[55:39] and maturing so that you can be perfect
[55:41] and thoroughly
[55:42] furnished amen when it's already
[55:44] happened that's not the time for Faith
[55:46] that's there to give you faith for the
[55:48] next time it's supposed to happen for
[55:50] the next stage of your journey amen you
[55:52] know it's amusing these days now that
[55:54] the election in the United States is is
[55:56] over we're facing one for Canada how
[55:58] people are so caught up in the great
[56:00] changes that have been promised make
[56:02] America great again make Canada great
[56:04] again pick your pick your slogan pick
[56:06] your politician amen people look at the
[56:09] changes that are happening and some see
[56:11] great destruction going to happen and
[56:12] some see like everything that they've
[56:14] ever dreamed is going to happen and
[56:17] they're so caught up in that amen but
[56:19] I'm telling you tonight and the
[56:20] scriptures tell us that peace that rest
[56:23] has no basis for the believer there is
[56:25] nothing
[56:26] in it amen there may be some things that
[56:29] improve for the better for Christians
[56:31] I'm not saying it wouldn't but what I'm
[56:33] saying is the system is broken the
[56:35] system is rotten and yes I believe in
[56:38] democracy and there is no better system
[56:40] for this world as it is
[56:42] today but we know there's a new system
[56:44] coming in that's a theocracy where God
[56:47] himself is the king he's the light he's
[56:49] the judge he's the ruler amen that's the
[56:51] only way it's going to work amen this
[56:53] world is broken all of its systems are
[56:55] broken there's nothing good in it amen
[56:59] Jesus said the peace I'm giving you
[57:00] isn't the peace that the world is going
[57:01] to give you why because the Peace of
[57:03] this world isn't even real it's
[57:05] temporary it's not even real it's a sham
[57:08] remember what Paul said in Thessalonians
[57:09] he says but of the times and the seasons
[57:11] Brethren Brethren ye have no need that I
[57:13] write unto you for yourselves know
[57:15] perfectly that the day of the Lord so
[57:17] cometh as a thief in the night for when
[57:20] they shall say peace and safety when
[57:24] they shall shall say Trump is going to
[57:26] make it all better when they say PV is
[57:29] going to make it all better pick your
[57:30] poison pick your politician he's saying
[57:34] then sudden destruction comes upon them
[57:36] as travail upon a woman with child and
[57:38] they shall not Escape in other words
[57:41] when things look like they're getting
[57:42] better that's the time they're going to
[57:45] get worse and not only that it's going
[57:47] to happen like this sudden
[57:51] destruction like a woman having a baby
[57:54] one minute you're sitting there and the
[57:56] next the contractions hit I've heard and
[57:59] you say oh my goodness here it comes you
[58:02] may have had a few little things happen
[58:04] but when it really hits there's no go
[58:07] there's no going back after that point
[58:08] it's started and there's nothing coming
[58:10] back and everything comes crashing down
[58:11] and nobody will see it coming and nobody
[58:14] will escape that judgment amen but we're
[58:16] preaching on the comforter tonight are
[58:19] you feeling comforted
[58:20] yet remember he's for the bad times not
[58:24] just for the good times amen the
[58:26] comforter is the only way to escape what
[58:29] first Thessalonians 5 is talking about
[58:31] that's the only way we're going to get
[58:32] out amen that's the Comfort we have is
[58:34] that we have him indwelling inside of us
[58:36] that's our eternal life that's our peace
[58:38] and rest and joy but brother bam he's
[58:40] talking about the condition of the world
[58:42] and he's talking about how people are
[58:44] trying to be how people are influenced
[58:46] and he says this he says you can't
[58:47] believe nothing hardly but the
[58:49] Bible you know we we've had such a a
[58:53] backlash against media in these days and
[58:55] again I I don't want to speak about
[58:56] politics I don't believe the pulpit is a
[58:58] place for it but we've seen how they've
[59:00] the world has turned on them because
[59:01] they don't believe they can trust them
[59:03] but what's amazing is where they run
[59:05] with their trust
[59:06] now they run to people that agree with
[59:09] them regardless of what the data and the
[59:12] facts may
[59:13] say everybody's running for the sides
[59:17] nobody's running for the truth brother
[59:19] says you can't believe nothing hardly
[59:20] but the Bible we still have Christ thank
[59:23] to God he says for instance when you
[59:25] turn your television off you that have
[59:27] such and see the commercials well if a
[59:29] person tried to live by 100th of those
[59:31] commercials you'd die in a
[59:34] week if you look at everything they're
[59:36] telling you to put on your skin put down
[59:38] your your to to eat to drink to not eat
[59:42] to not drink you'd either be full of
[59:44] food or you'd have no
[59:45] food you you'd look like a
[59:51] clown he says and the very thing that
[59:53] some company will break down like a
[59:55] product and say this is the thing here
[59:56] and don't have this one over here the
[59:58] same company sells the same product then
[1:00:01] another commercial will come out and say
[1:00:02] take this on this side and not that and
[1:00:04] it's the same company somebody's selling
[1:00:07] you two things that are completely
[1:00:08] opposite and they're selling you both
[1:00:10] and saying take them both talking out of
[1:00:12] both sides out of their
[1:00:14] mouth he says the American people fall
[1:00:17] for such stuff as that you know what
[1:00:20] it's not just the Americans sisters
[1:00:22] sister Amber sister Blanca sister
[1:00:24] Priscilla it's not just you it's
[1:00:27] everybody it's everybody till the whole
[1:00:30] thing has become rotten until there's no
[1:00:32] hope at all I'm trying to show you why
[1:00:34] we need a
[1:00:35] comforter nobody knows what to believe
[1:00:38] listen I don't care how objective it
[1:00:40] comes across the news I don't trust any
[1:00:42] of it anymore
[1:00:43] unfortunately even when they're
[1:00:45] objective I wonder if they're hiding
[1:00:46] something behind their objectivity cuz I
[1:00:49] don't know what I don't
[1:00:50] know he says nobody knows what to
[1:00:53] believe the people they lie they cheat
[1:00:55] they steal to you almost have to have a
[1:00:56] bond of security to borrow $5 from
[1:00:59] somebody you know the Bible speaks that
[1:01:01] there be no love in the last days but
[1:01:03] just amongst the elect people that's
[1:01:05] right the scripture speaks of that that
[1:01:07] the husband will be against wife wife
[1:01:08] against husband and children against
[1:01:10] parents can I tell you the most crazy
[1:01:12] thing I've heard of children's against
[1:01:14] parents a woman has sued her parents for
[1:01:18] not getting her consent to conceive
[1:01:21] her grown
[1:01:23] woman okay that doesn't even make sense
[1:01:27] and if she feels so strongly about it
[1:01:28] she has options but she sued her parents
[1:01:31] because they didn't ask her permission
[1:01:32] to conceive
[1:01:36] her it it makes no sense I agree
[1:01:39] sister it makes no sense the world is
[1:01:43] insane that's where we're at I'm trying
[1:01:46] to tell you
[1:01:49] it's it's closer than you think okay
[1:01:53] it's closer than you think he says just
[1:01:56] among the elected of the Lord will there
[1:01:58] be any love
[1:01:59] left he says now we find out that the
[1:02:02] churches too are always promising
[1:02:04] something like television and so forth
[1:02:06] that they never get to the thing they
[1:02:08] promised as I have often said an old
[1:02:10] quotation man is always praising God for
[1:02:13] what he did praising God for what he
[1:02:15] will do looking forward to what he will
[1:02:16] do and then ignore what he's doing see
[1:02:20] they fail and that's the way they become
[1:02:22] polluted history after a while is
[1:02:24] because they fail to re recognize now
[1:02:28] they are they fail to recognize what's
[1:02:29] going on in the here and now and I want
[1:02:31] to stop there because we'll see this
[1:02:33] issue coming up time and time again as
[1:02:35] we go through this little portion on the
[1:02:36] comforter amen because our comfort comes
[1:02:38] for not just looking as to what will be
[1:02:41] or what has been but the purpose of the
[1:02:44] comforter is for the Here and Now what's
[1:02:46] the purpose of a comforter in the
[1:02:48] future I need the comforter now I need
[1:02:51] it for what's going on in my life amen
[1:02:54] and we need to see where we are by the
[1:02:56] word of God Amen if I can find my
[1:02:59] position if I can find my time my age my
[1:03:02] season my test my trial and it lines up
[1:03:05] with the word of God then I've got
[1:03:07] reason to say I can have the comforter
[1:03:09] cuz I see where I'm at amen but the
[1:03:12] challenge is always brother BR saying
[1:03:14] will we recognize what's going on as
[1:03:16] we're going through it rather than with
[1:03:19] perfect 2020
[1:03:21] hindsight what's the point of realizing
[1:03:23] what you've been through if you didn't
[1:03:26] have the Comfort to go through
[1:03:27] it we want it when we're going through
[1:03:29] it amen remember you know was I as I was
[1:03:34] studying this because what happens is we
[1:03:37] set our our minds on a thing and we say
[1:03:39] this is the way it's going to be this is
[1:03:40] the way it's going to happen this is the
[1:03:42] way it's going to show it and then when
[1:03:44] it doesn't happen the way we think it
[1:03:46] does we miss what really happened and I
[1:03:49] there's lots of examples of this in the
[1:03:50] scripture but it it struck me as I was
[1:03:52] studying that when Jesus was coming into
[1:03:54] Jerusalem his Triumph entry he's riding
[1:03:57] on a cult and the scriptures said
[1:03:59] exactly how he would come in and he's
[1:04:01] riding in on the cult and they don't
[1:04:04] recognize what's happening the disciples
[1:04:05] don't the people don't but then it says
[1:04:08] in John 12 it says these things
[1:04:09] understood his disciples not at the
[1:04:13] first he says but when Jesus was
[1:04:16] glorified then remembered they that
[1:04:19] these things were written of him and
[1:04:20] that they had done these things unto him
[1:04:22] see the hard part is when the word is
[1:04:24] happening in front of you both the good
[1:04:26] and bad can you re recognize where
[1:04:28] you're at can you recognize what's going
[1:04:30] on that's what the word is supposed to
[1:04:32] do that's what the holy spirit is
[1:04:34] supposed to do is to open our eyes of
[1:04:37] Revelation so that we can understand the
[1:04:39] season we're in so we can catch the word
[1:04:41] for That season so we can have a
[1:04:43] comforter to take us through to the
[1:04:45] other side that's what he's supposed to
[1:04:46] be doing amen we read before a couple
[1:04:48] Services ago we're not the children of
[1:04:50] Darkness we're the children of light
[1:04:52] that means we're supposed to see and
[1:04:55] understand clearly what's going on
[1:04:56] around us how by the word of God and
[1:05:00] even then church I'll say it again it's
[1:05:01] later than you think even when we think
[1:05:04] we've got it all figured out I'm telling
[1:05:05] you it's later than we
[1:05:07] think not just politically not just
[1:05:09] socially not just religiously not just
[1:05:11] economically amen we can see those
[1:05:13] things clearly but the challenge is to
[1:05:15] see where I am in all of those things
[1:05:18] happening amen when I'm facing hard
[1:05:21] times when you're facing battles when
[1:05:23] you're struggling things are tough
[1:05:24] that's when we're looking for the light
[1:05:26] and the comfort of the Holy Spirit to
[1:05:28] let us know what's going on in our lives
[1:05:30] amen that we can see there's a purpose
[1:05:32] for it in these things and when we do
[1:05:34] that what we see is our response will
[1:05:36] show us where we are
[1:05:38] at anden we're we're a bride that's
[1:05:40] supposed to be getting ready to go in a
[1:05:42] Rapture that means our our maturity
[1:05:45] ought to be changing our response our
[1:05:47] way of reacting to things ought to be
[1:05:49] changing how I reacted last year to
[1:05:52] something should be completely different
[1:05:53] from what I did this year if I was
[1:05:56] immature in that area maybe I'm mature
[1:05:58] that's okay but the thing is we ought to
[1:06:00] be able to see that our response is
[1:06:03] improving by the word as we grow in life
[1:06:06] and that things that used to knock us
[1:06:07] back things that used to hold us back
[1:06:09] things that used to hinder us now they
[1:06:10] don't hinder us anymore why because
[1:06:12] we're growing in Grace in the word of
[1:06:14] God day by day by day is it Faith or
[1:06:18] doubt when things don't go the way we
[1:06:20] wanted it to go what comes up Faith or
[1:06:23] doubt when we don't know what to do is
[1:06:25] it the word or is it worldly wisdom
[1:06:28] that'll tell you where you're at in the
[1:06:29] word cuz we ought to see ourselves
[1:06:32] there says it this way he says you can
[1:06:34] talk of the Comfort Christ gave once and
[1:06:37] say that a comfort he will give in the
[1:06:38] ages to come but refuse the comfort that
[1:06:42] he's got here now for you he says see
[1:06:44] it's on the same basis that we find that
[1:06:47] how do we find comfort in the things
[1:06:48] that are to come by the word we see it
[1:06:52] coming how do we see on the things that
[1:06:54] are passed by the word
[1:06:56] so how do you have comfort in the things
[1:06:57] that are here by the word amen we read
[1:07:00] last service in Revelation 3 of the
[1:07:02] leosan church age and we saw they were
[1:07:04] spiritually delusional we saw that they
[1:07:06] had a religious spirit of self-deception
[1:07:08] and it's only by the mercy and grace of
[1:07:10] God that we can come out of that because
[1:07:12] there was no merit there was no goodness
[1:07:14] in that last Church nothing there it was
[1:07:17] the only one that God had nothing good
[1:07:18] to talk about amen but we saw that
[1:07:20] remedy was three things it was the
[1:07:22] character of
[1:07:23] God so that means you had to lay your
[1:07:25] own down it was the righteousness of God
[1:07:28] so you had to lay your
[1:07:29] self-righteousness down and then the
[1:07:31] third thing was the revelation of God
[1:07:33] the IAP for your eyes that you could see
[1:07:35] and everything everything there goes
[1:07:38] hand in hand because God's calling out a
[1:07:39] bride that's without spot without
[1:07:41] wrinkle Washed by the word matured by
[1:07:44] the tutoring of the Holy Spirit adopted
[1:07:46] into the body of Christ by that same
[1:07:48] spirit and that's what's happening here
[1:07:51] tonight whether you can feel it or not
[1:07:53] whether you can see it or not whether
[1:07:54] you can recognize or not the word that
[1:07:56] is quickened by the holy spirit is doing
[1:07:58] that work in each and every one of our
[1:08:00] Lives tonight just a little bit
[1:08:02] sometimes sometimes we get a big leap
[1:08:04] God does a real work for for us in a
[1:08:06] service or something but it's just a
[1:08:08] little bit here a little there a little
[1:08:09] line upon line as we were talking about
[1:08:11] earlier amen but it's happening
[1:08:14] nonetheless but Jesus said in John 15 he
[1:08:16] says when the comforter has come whom I
[1:08:19] will send unto you from the father even
[1:08:20] the spirit of Truth which proceedeth
[1:08:22] from the father he shall testify of me
[1:08:26] and ye also shall bear witness because
[1:08:28] ye have been with me from the beginning
[1:08:30] now we said earlier that the Holy Spirit
[1:08:32] Comforts by two things teaching and
[1:08:34] reminding us and Jesus says here that in
[1:08:36] verse 26 the comforter will testify of
[1:08:40] me he'll testify of Jesus Christ now
[1:08:42] that's a wonderful thing and I'm
[1:08:43] thankful for that but it does me no good
[1:08:46] for him to testify if I don't get into
[1:08:47] verse
[1:08:48] 27 because verse 27 is what makes me a
[1:08:52] part of it rather than me just seeing it
[1:08:54] or me just understanding amen our
[1:08:56] comfort is complete when we have the
[1:08:58] experience of verse 27 that says and ye
[1:09:00] shall also bear witness amen the
[1:09:03] testimony can't be out there the
[1:09:05] testimony can't just be in brother Chad
[1:09:08] it's got to be in me it's got to be in
[1:09:09] you it's got to be something that we're
[1:09:11] a part of Amen we've got to be a witness
[1:09:13] of the teaching and reminding effect of
[1:09:16] the Holy Spirit and the comfort that
[1:09:18] comes from those things watch how the
[1:09:20] prophet of God explains it he says but
[1:09:22] then if we'll just live close to him
[1:09:25] he'll provide something else for us you
[1:09:27] get close to God and what will he
[1:09:29] provide he said he'll provide you an
[1:09:31] Insight that we can see what the
[1:09:34] ordinary person never sees when we're
[1:09:36] born again we see him see he says you
[1:09:41] know him you've seen him he'll abide
[1:09:43] with you forever oh he's a good father
[1:09:45] he's a fountain of goodness the great
[1:09:47] resource of all goodness and fatherhood
[1:09:50] belongs in our God he is so good to his
[1:09:53] believing children so what is the what
[1:09:55] is the Insight that he's given us it's
[1:09:58] the realities of God in our personal
[1:10:00] lives amen it's the reality of the word
[1:10:02] amen that we could find comfort in it
[1:10:05] the Holy Spirit can't just be an emotion
[1:10:07] it can't just be a church experience
[1:10:09] it's got to be the living proof of the
[1:10:11] word in our lives for this day amen our
[1:10:14] witness is that we have the Holy Spirit
[1:10:16] is when he takes the word and it comes
[1:10:18] down and takes hold of our life and
[1:10:20] produces that word in you and in I amen
[1:10:23] that's our Insight that's our advantage
[1:10:25] that's that's our Assurance that's our
[1:10:26] comfort amen and if we won't limit the
[1:10:29] word of God the word of God will give us
[1:10:31] the reality of Jesus Christ theive and
[1:10:33] well today let me say that again if we
[1:10:36] won't limit it it'll give us the
[1:10:37] realities of Jesus Christ in our lives
[1:10:40] today amen that's what the word the the
[1:10:43] world is saying that's what the church
[1:10:44] world is saying is they're saying the
[1:10:46] days of Miracles are passed they're
[1:10:48] saying that only the disciples had it
[1:10:50] they're saying the Holy Ghost is not
[1:10:51] what they say it is they're saying it's
[1:10:53] only for the ministry whatever they
[1:10:55] might do and they limit it they limit
[1:10:57] the healing of the word they limit the
[1:10:59] the the direction of the word all of
[1:11:01] these different things and their
[1:11:02] unbelief limits the holy spirit because
[1:11:05] their eyes aren't open to it they can't
[1:11:07] see it they can't receive it and
[1:11:09] therefore it can't do anything for them
[1:11:11] amen they come and they put a cap on
[1:11:13] what Christ has said by their own
[1:11:15] doctrines by their own Traditions by
[1:11:17] their denominations whatever it might be
[1:11:19] their human understanding and when they
[1:11:21] do that they lose the opportunity for
[1:11:23] the reality of Jesus Christ in their
[1:11:25] life
[1:11:25] today they may have a reality but
[1:11:28] they'll lose the full reality they'll
[1:11:30] never go all the way Amen brother says
[1:11:32] it this way he says it's our privilege
[1:11:35] it's this sacred trust that God has put
[1:11:38] to his church God gave his word to his
[1:11:40] church and that sacred Heritage is ours
[1:11:44] it's a gift from God not to just
[1:11:46] compromise on this and cut this out and
[1:11:49] throw this out and add this in to suit
[1:11:50] our own taste but to preach the full
[1:11:53] word the whole gospel he says we are
[1:11:56] Duty bound as Christians to take it and
[1:12:00] believe it and he says when we know if
[1:12:03] our hearts condemn us not then we know
[1:12:05] that we have favor with God and if we
[1:12:08] ever expect this word ever to ever come
[1:12:11] to pass if we ever expect God to keep
[1:12:14] his word we've got to do one thing stay
[1:12:18] with it just the way that God wrote it
[1:12:21] and mean God help us not to change it
[1:12:23] for our situations amen he says that's
[1:12:25] the reason if you stay with it the way
[1:12:28] God wrote it there will be all kinds of
[1:12:31] things happening among you every word
[1:12:34] will be fulfilled if you'll stay with it
[1:12:37] exactly the way it's written he says I'm
[1:12:39] under expectations just now myself I've
[1:12:42] seen a shaking power come that will
[1:12:44] shake the Nations pretty
[1:12:47] soon after everything that happened in
[1:12:50] this ministry he says I believe there's
[1:12:51] more why cuz the word said there's more
[1:12:54] that's why he believed it he says if God
[1:12:56] can ever get a people under his own
[1:12:58] control if he'll get a man or a woman
[1:13:01] that won't compromise on his word but
[1:13:03] will stand there like the Rock of Ages
[1:13:06] that will believe every word of it and
[1:13:08] believe that he is behind it he says and
[1:13:11] a man who believes it you
[1:13:13] must act like
[1:13:16] it if you don't act like it then you
[1:13:19] don't believe it that's the great test
[1:13:23] will you act on it he he says but if you
[1:13:25] believe it act like it and you can put
[1:13:29] it to work and the word will live and
[1:13:32] the word will be in
[1:13:35] you he says we lost our heritage because
[1:13:40] we just
[1:13:42] compromise now see we when we look at
[1:13:46] compromise compromise means to put one
[1:13:49] word out or add one word in that's all
[1:13:52] compromise is and what you do when you
[1:13:54] do that then that gives you the right to
[1:13:57] act the way you act but the compromise
[1:13:59] is to take something out of the word or
[1:14:01] add something in of your own
[1:14:02] choice he says and when we compromise
[1:14:05] then we cannot expect God to keep his
[1:14:07] promise to us because we have broken the
[1:14:10] sacred trust and defile the trust that
[1:14:12] God gave us he says let us keep that
[1:14:15] trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep
[1:14:18] every word of it and compromise nowhere
[1:14:21] take God at his word and believe it act
[1:14:24] like it stand on it don't move that's
[1:14:27] what we must do that's what God is
[1:14:30] looking for you'll see this service this
[1:14:32] sermon he preach is called the comforter
[1:14:33] and we're going to be quoting a lot from
[1:14:35] that as we go through the rest of this
[1:14:36] service amen the
[1:14:38] comforter and you'll notice how he's
[1:14:40] setting us up for the comforter as he's
[1:14:42] saying you've got to take him at his
[1:14:44] word no matter what take him at his
[1:14:47] word it struck me as I was studying that
[1:14:50] and just looking back at my own life
[1:14:52] even and the lives of others that we say
[1:14:55] we're a child of God and I believe we
[1:14:57] are but it seems like when the word is
[1:14:59] just getting good that's when we pull
[1:15:02] back and when I say getting good I mean
[1:15:04] when it's getting personal when it's
[1:15:06] getting real when the light is shining
[1:15:08] where light has never Shone
[1:15:10] before then what do we do we pull back
[1:15:14] why we compromise on the word why we
[1:15:17] don't believe it it hasn't struck us yet
[1:15:20] hey I said I looked at my life I'm not
[1:15:23] putting this on you I why because this
[1:15:25] flesh is not it's not redeemed this
[1:15:29] flesh doesn't want those things but it's
[1:15:31] the soul inside that starts to pull on
[1:15:33] that word by the grace of God that takes
[1:15:35] us into where we need to go but our
[1:15:37] nature is to pull back in those things
[1:15:39] cuz this flesh does not believe that's
[1:15:42] why we need to keep it under subjection
[1:15:44] to the spirit amen is to make us believe
[1:15:46] the word amen doubts and fears hold us
[1:15:49] back cuz we're not convinced that God
[1:15:50] will back it up and that the end result
[1:15:52] is not worth the difficulty of the
[1:15:54] battle that we're facing
[1:15:57] but when we pull back what do we do we
[1:15:58] step out of the light and once you step
[1:16:00] out of the light you can't grow you
[1:16:02] can't
[1:16:04] mature you can't you can't grow in
[1:16:06] Christ you can't do it that's a bad
[1:16:08] place to be if you're trying to grow
[1:16:09] mature is in darkness yo we've got uh
[1:16:12] plants all over our house but we've got
[1:16:14] some in our bathroom our master bathroom
[1:16:17] and and I noticed that as I've been
[1:16:19] going in in the mornings now that the
[1:16:21] shades are pulled down we've got a shade
[1:16:22] that can go down from the top or it can
[1:16:24] go up from the bottom and I noticed it's
[1:16:25] pulled down and and uh I I put it back
[1:16:28] up one day at the end of the day thank
[1:16:30] God and uh my wife said when did you put
[1:16:33] that up and I said well I put it when it
[1:16:34] got dark so people couldn't see into the
[1:16:36] house and she said good cuz the plants
[1:16:38] in there need light there's light from
[1:16:41] the ceiling but that's not the light
[1:16:42] they need they need
[1:16:43] sunshine and as soon as you take them
[1:16:45] out of the sunshine then what happens
[1:16:47] they start to deteriorate that's just
[1:16:49] the way it is they need the sunlight
[1:16:52] brother Brown puts it this way this is
[1:16:54] from the comforter
[1:16:55] most of these are you'll see if a man
[1:16:57] will shut himself from God's spiritual
[1:16:59] Sunshine there's something wrong with
[1:17:01] his spiritual condition when a man
[1:17:03] refuses to walk in the leading of a good
[1:17:06] god like our God who is our comfort and
[1:17:09] our strength he says and to live in his
[1:17:11] Sunshine is spiritual growth it's
[1:17:14] spiritual strength to live in his
[1:17:16] Sunshine The Shining of his glory why
[1:17:17] it's the greatest privilege that we have
[1:17:19] to live under the sunlight of God's
[1:17:21] glory he says look at the good healthy
[1:17:23] Christians he he says take the man or
[1:17:26] the woman that would put himself down
[1:17:27] into some Sellar and would not see the
[1:17:29] sunshine the natural Sunshine that God
[1:17:31] has provided for him what he refuses to
[1:17:34] believe it he says and because of
[1:17:37] selfishness he shuts himself off now for
[1:17:41] context there he's talking about a man
[1:17:43] or a woman that doesn't want to grow
[1:17:46] that don't want to change that don't
[1:17:48] want to be responsible for what they've
[1:17:50] heard and what they've seen and so they
[1:17:52] say I'm just not going to listen to it
[1:17:55] what out of selfishness because once you
[1:17:57] hear it once you know it god holds you
[1:17:59] accountable so what do they do they say
[1:18:01] I'm not just not going to go I'm not
[1:18:03] going to go to church I'm not going to
[1:18:04] go hear that Ministry I'm not going to
[1:18:05] do this I'm not going to do that I'm
[1:18:06] going to pull back selfishness you want
[1:18:09] to stay where you are you don't want to
[1:18:10] grow he says that man will soon become
[1:18:13] anemic he'll become pale he won't have
[1:18:15] good strength he won't have health
[1:18:17] because that he shut himself off from
[1:18:18] the very privilege that God gave him he
[1:18:21] says that's right he did it
[1:18:23] willfully then if we shut ourselves off
[1:18:26] from the glory of God from the baptism
[1:18:28] of the Holy Ghost or The Fellowship of
[1:18:30] the spirit the first thing you know we
[1:18:32] become pale sickly Christians our
[1:18:35] experience is growing dim he doesn't say
[1:18:38] you're not a son of God he doesn't say
[1:18:39] you're not a Christian he says you start
[1:18:41] to fail in your
[1:18:43] Christianity and when the Great Trials
[1:18:45] come we shrink and go back it takes that
[1:18:49] soldier who has lived in the sunlight of
[1:18:51] God it takes that Spirit who knows God
[1:18:54] where there is not a wave of doubt they
[1:18:56] can stand in the midst of trouble and
[1:18:59] cry out my redeemer liveth he says
[1:19:01] hallelujah that's it see now catch this
[1:19:04] we shut ourselves
[1:19:08] off he doesn't say God turns it off he
[1:19:12] says we shut it off he says and they
[1:19:15] he's speaking of the world do it
[1:19:17] automatically why they're built that way
[1:19:19] they're built to reject God they're
[1:19:20] built to reject the light of the word he
[1:19:22] says we do it because we want to do
[1:19:26] it he's talking to
[1:19:28] Believers and he's saying the reason we
[1:19:31] don't live in the light is because we
[1:19:33] don't choose to live in the light we
[1:19:36] back away when hardship comes we back
[1:19:38] away when hard decisions come we back
[1:19:40] away when things don't go the way we
[1:19:42] want and he says you turn off the light
[1:19:46] because the light's always there you
[1:19:48] back away it ain't God that's pulled
[1:19:50] away it's you that pulled
[1:19:53] away but catch this this is so beautiful
[1:19:57] but God is good he provides it for us he
[1:20:01] says but too many today don't want to
[1:20:02] get into that healthy place with God a
[1:20:05] healthy Christian and have a healthy
[1:20:07] Spirit now catch this he says you
[1:20:09] certainly would rally for a healthy body
[1:20:12] anybody would hey we'll eat the craziest
[1:20:14] diets we'll do the craziest exercise
[1:20:16] programs we'll go through the craziest
[1:20:18] regimens to get a healthy body to get
[1:20:21] the muscles to get the slimness to get
[1:20:22] the health whatever it might be well do
[1:20:24] crazy
[1:20:26] things he says well that body no matter
[1:20:28] how much health you put in that body
[1:20:30] it's going back to the dust but oh my
[1:20:32] brother that Soul cannot get too healthy
[1:20:35] and every time it grows it grows in the
[1:20:39] strength and Grace and power of God he
[1:20:43] says we need to walk in the sunlight of
[1:20:45] God because he is
[1:20:48] good he'll withhold no good thing from
[1:20:50] his children and everything he has is
[1:20:53] for our good
[1:20:55] and when I was reading this it struck me
[1:20:57] about that rich young ruler that came to
[1:20:58] Jesus and I want you to realize that
[1:21:01] when he came to Jesus he had done
[1:21:02] everything he knew to do to receive
[1:21:06] eternal life he had followed the
[1:21:08] Commandments he had lived a clean life
[1:21:09] he had treated people properly and he
[1:21:11] was sincere in his belief and in his
[1:21:13] actions but yet in all of those things
[1:21:16] when a push came to shove there was a
[1:21:18] lingering doubt in his mind as to
[1:21:20] whether he was going to have eternal
[1:21:21] life when he passed from this life into
[1:21:23] the next he didn't know what was going
[1:21:25] to happen and there was something about
[1:21:27] Jesus that made him think that that man
[1:21:28] had the answer Church what was he
[1:21:30] looking for he was looking for Comfort
[1:21:33] he was looking for Assurance he was
[1:21:35] looking for confirmation he was looking
[1:21:37] for his soul to have
[1:21:40] comfort perhaps everyone around him was
[1:21:42] saying listen you live a good life you
[1:21:45] pay your ti you help pay for the church
[1:21:47] building you're always doing good things
[1:21:49] what are you worried about man you got
[1:21:51] this in the bag you're going to receive
[1:21:52] eternal life but there was something in
[1:21:54] his Soul his heart that wasn't settled
[1:21:57] amen and when he came up to Jesus and he
[1:21:58] said what must I do to receive eternal
[1:22:01] life and Jesus said live by the
[1:22:04] word he said live by the word he said do
[1:22:07] the Commandments and he started listing
[1:22:08] them and look what this young man says
[1:22:10] and he says the young man saith unto him
[1:22:13] all these things have I kept from my
[1:22:15] youth
[1:22:16] up I've done that I've lived that kind
[1:22:18] of Life Jesus exactly what you're
[1:22:20] talking about I've done it since I was
[1:22:22] young enough to know what to do but then
[1:22:24] he said said these words what lack I yet
[1:22:27] he knew there was more to it he knew
[1:22:29] there was more to this walk and Jesus
[1:22:32] said unto him if thou wil be
[1:22:35] perfect see he says I'm lacking he knows
[1:22:38] he's lacking Jesus words there that word
[1:22:41] perfect means complete finished full
[1:22:44] grown mature lacking nothing so Jesus
[1:22:47] said if you want to lack nothing he says
[1:22:50] what lack I yet Jesus says if you want
[1:22:53] to be without lack he says go and sell
[1:22:57] that thou Hast and give to the poor and
[1:23:00] thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
[1:23:03] come and follow me and when the young
[1:23:05] man heard that saying he went away
[1:23:08] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[1:23:12] remember we said last service that the
[1:23:13] word is the discerner of the thoughts
[1:23:15] and intents of the heart amen and that
[1:23:17] young man could do everything the word
[1:23:20] told him to do except trust it
[1:23:22] completely
[1:23:24] he couldn't trust it he could do it by
[1:23:27] law but he could not trust his very life
[1:23:30] amen he could perform the requirements
[1:23:32] of the law but when Jesus said give me
[1:23:34] your life he said I can't do it amen if
[1:23:38] Jesus had asked him go spend a bunch of
[1:23:40] money on the local Tabernacle give the
[1:23:42] money give some of your money to the
[1:23:44] poor give half he might have done it but
[1:23:45] Jesus said you got to give it all you
[1:23:48] got to give it all and you got to follow
[1:23:49] me and he walked away why the price was
[1:23:52] too high he wasn't convinced that that
[1:23:54] what he heard was true and so it had no
[1:23:57] comfort for him amen he just knew that
[1:23:59] hardship was going to be too much the
[1:24:01] word was getting personal now the word
[1:24:04] was Discerning what was in that young
[1:24:05] man's heart and that's when he backed
[1:24:07] away and that young man went away with
[1:24:09] the same issue that he came in
[1:24:11] with his heart was not settled but you
[1:24:14] know brother Braham said this he says
[1:24:15] you know that story of the rich man that
[1:24:17] built the Barns and then had to build
[1:24:19] bigger barns what did he say at the end
[1:24:21] Soul take thine knes brother Braham says
[1:24:25] it's this young
[1:24:27] man what happened after that his
[1:24:29] conscience was seared and he walked into
[1:24:32] judgment thinking that he had the
[1:24:33] greatest life ever and that night he
[1:24:35] died and he went to
[1:24:37] hell when it was all said and done he
[1:24:40] didn't have the comforter that he
[1:24:42] needed amen he never got his rest he
[1:24:45] never got that anchor in his soul but he
[1:24:47] got a searing of that thing and he
[1:24:49] thought that he had made it through we
[1:24:51] can look at people all down through
[1:24:53] history through the scriptures and
[1:24:54] particular that had the same opportunity
[1:24:56] as this young man and the choice is
[1:24:57] always one of two things do it or don't
[1:25:00] do it it's that simple it's yes or no
[1:25:03] I'll go with the word or I'll go my own
[1:25:04] way amen but when they accepted the word
[1:25:06] of God when they said I'll do it they
[1:25:08] had to go all the way they had to be
[1:25:10] fully committed there was no halfway you
[1:25:13] look at somebody like Abraham Abraham's
[1:25:15] halfway uh commitment to God never got
[1:25:17] him anywhere it never got him anywhere
[1:25:20] it was only when he went all the way
[1:25:22] that the promises started to come to
[1:25:23] pass and me you can't go halfway it was
[1:25:25] all or nothing so if there's one thing
[1:25:27] you grasp tonight it's that this
[1:25:29] comforter only comes to somebody who's
[1:25:30] all in it won't be halfway amen it can't
[1:25:33] be a halfway life a halfway Faith a
[1:25:35] halfway commitment a halfway
[1:25:37] sanctification it's all the way or no
[1:25:39] way you're better off not
[1:25:42] starting cuz you'll just be me even more
[1:25:45] miserable if you go half the way because
[1:25:46] you never get the promise and you can't
[1:25:47] go back to what you were either now that
[1:25:50] young man that Rich Young Ruler by his
[1:25:51] reasoning might have said you know I can
[1:25:53] do a lot of good with my wealth
[1:25:56] I can pay for church after church I can
[1:25:58] I can provide for the poor for the rest
[1:26:00] of my life instead of spend it all in
[1:26:01] one shot by Logic and reasoning he could
[1:26:04] come up with all sorts of reasons for
[1:26:06] why he shouldn't do it for things that
[1:26:08] were good for things that would benefit
[1:26:10] the local body and these things but
[1:26:12] remember the word is a discerner and
[1:26:14] Jesus saw something in that young man's
[1:26:16] heart that was going to be bound by that
[1:26:19] money Jesus didn't tell everyone to give
[1:26:21] up their money by no means you can go
[1:26:23] through the script ures and while while
[1:26:25] wealth was not the Hallmark of the
[1:26:27] believer you can find wealthy people job
[1:26:30] was the wealthiest man there Abraham was
[1:26:32] a man of great wealth Solomon was the
[1:26:34] the the the wealthiest of them all we
[1:26:36] believe but you'll find that their
[1:26:38] wealth did not control them remember
[1:26:41] Abraham Abraham left everything he had
[1:26:43] established to follow God job lost
[1:26:47] everything he had and he said the Lord
[1:26:49] gives and the Lord takes away blessed be
[1:26:51] the name of the Lord and Solomon didn't
[1:26:53] even ask asked for wealth he asked for
[1:26:56] wisdom and God said I'll give you
[1:26:57] everything else because you asked for
[1:26:59] the right thing it could not dominate
[1:27:01] him it didn't have a hold on him this
[1:27:03] man was held by his wealth and the word
[1:27:05] said you've got to lay it down listen
[1:27:08] the Holy Spirit can go through this
[1:27:09] church and one of you can hear one thing
[1:27:11] and it'll tell you to lay it down and it
[1:27:13] has no effect on the other you know why
[1:27:15] because you're bound by it and they're
[1:27:17] not that's why we don't do things
[1:27:20] because others do them and it's why we
[1:27:21] don't do things because others don't do
[1:27:22] them some people have weaknesses and
[1:27:24] some have strengths and some of us have
[1:27:26] to lay things down that others don't and
[1:27:29] that's the personal effect of the Holy
[1:27:31] Spirit coming into your life it's to
[1:27:33] save you from yourself that's what he's
[1:27:35] trying to do amen God's trust God's
[1:27:38] requirement is that we trust him
[1:27:41] absolutely and completely
[1:27:44] amen he knows where we're reliant on
[1:27:46] things and he comes in and he just Yanks
[1:27:49] that right out from under our feet pulls
[1:27:51] the rug out from under our feet time and
[1:27:52] time again to teach us
[1:27:54] your rest and your hope is in me I'm
[1:27:56] your comfort not your bank account not
[1:27:58] your health not your intellect not your
[1:28:00] job prospects whatever it might be he
[1:28:02] says your hope and your trust has to be
[1:28:04] in me that's why he's our
[1:28:06] comforter but I want to look at just a
[1:28:08] few people that had to stand this way as
[1:28:11] we start to close just a couple more
[1:28:13] pages he said Noah had a consolation
[1:28:16] that while he was making this Ark he
[1:28:18] knew that he was comforted because he
[1:28:19] had the word of the Lord that told him
[1:28:22] that's the instructions
[1:28:24] Church we're on a path to get out of
[1:28:26] here and we've got a message to take us
[1:28:29] there and we have to trust it
[1:28:32] absolutely and more and more people are
[1:28:35] start starting to not trust it because
[1:28:37] they're sick of waiting for it to do
[1:28:39] what it said it would
[1:28:41] do but the believer sticks with it no
[1:28:43] matter
[1:28:45] what he says what if somebody would have
[1:28:47] said say Noah what do you mean by
[1:28:49] building that out of gopherwood why you
[1:28:51] know that would if there would be water
[1:28:52] it would be the first thing to think see
[1:28:54] gopherwood was
[1:28:56] porous goer wood is not what you build a
[1:28:58] boat out of church if you're looking for
[1:29:00] a
[1:29:03] material it's not waterproof on its own
[1:29:06] but remember God had told him how to
[1:29:07] transform that into something that would
[1:29:10] stand the test am then by using pitch to
[1:29:13] coat it inside and out he says but you
[1:29:16] see Noah was following the instructions
[1:29:18] he had the word of God which was his
[1:29:19] comforter the word was his comfort I
[1:29:22] don't understand why God is making me
[1:29:24] build it like this but this is what he
[1:29:27] said to do you know I can imagine the
[1:29:28] experts were critiquing him you know
[1:29:31] those
[1:29:32] Engineers those trades people coming by
[1:29:34] and saying
[1:29:36] Noah if we're ever going to build a boat
[1:29:38] it's not going to be out of that
[1:29:40] material it's too long it's too narrow
[1:29:44] its slenderness ratio will not hold up
[1:29:46] to what you're talking about you know
[1:29:48] the world has said that today the world
[1:29:51] has said that the dimensions of the Ark
[1:29:53] would cause it to break break and then
[1:29:55] what they did is they got a
[1:29:56] supercomputer that could actually handle
[1:29:58] everything and they said it's an
[1:29:59] ingenious design and it's probably the
[1:30:01] only thing that would not
[1:30:05] break isn't that amazing see today we
[1:30:09] build things so strong that design was
[1:30:12] made flexible enough that it could
[1:30:13] handle all of this great tumult that was
[1:30:16] going on in the world and see they
[1:30:18] couldn't figure it
[1:30:19] out God knew what he was doing
[1:30:22] amen our decision ision are going to be
[1:30:24] challenged they're going to be
[1:30:26] criticized they're going to be critiqued
[1:30:28] people are going to
[1:30:29] say how in the world do you think that's
[1:30:32] going to work
[1:30:33] out and the only answer we have the word
[1:30:37] of God said so that's it that's all we
[1:30:40] have to stand on Amen Satan's job is to
[1:30:42] criticize to try and drive a wedge
[1:30:44] between us and the word he's been doing
[1:30:46] it since Eve came and that's all he's
[1:30:48] trying to do is get us in there to doubt
[1:30:50] what God has said and when we doubt what
[1:30:52] God has said then guess what what we
[1:30:54] don't get the benefit we don't get the
[1:30:55] Comfort we don't get the rest we don't
[1:30:57] get the peace we don't get the promise
[1:30:59] we've got to be able to trust it
[1:31:01] absolutely amen our faith in the word is
[1:31:03] going to be challenged by somebody
[1:31:05] else's knowledge logic and reason and
[1:31:07] our faith has to be able to stand up to
[1:31:09] those things why because it takes time
[1:31:12] for the fruit of a right decision to
[1:31:14] show listen Noah had 120 years of
[1:31:19] criticism 120 years of people telling
[1:31:22] him that ain't going to to work and
[1:31:25] guess what when the trial came who was
[1:31:29] proven
[1:31:30] right not Noah the word was the word was
[1:31:34] proven Noah was with it so he got the he
[1:31:37] got all the credit but he built it
[1:31:39] according to the word his life was in
[1:31:41] the hands of the word and he put
[1:31:43] everything he had into it to stay with
[1:31:45] it and when the time came when the
[1:31:47] trials and tribulation came like God had
[1:31:49] said there was his faith would stand
[1:31:51] because he'd placed it completely in the
[1:31:53] word of God God remember what Jesus said
[1:31:55] trials and tribulations are coming your
[1:31:58] peace is in me you got to be in me amen
[1:32:00] you'll be in me I'll be in you and it'll
[1:32:02] all work out but Braham said this he
[1:32:05] says Christ the chief captain of our
[1:32:07] Salvation there he stands the great
[1:32:09] conqueror he rent the veil in two and
[1:32:11] took down all the middle walls of
[1:32:13] partition and invited whosoever will to
[1:32:15] come and partake of his life to be cover
[1:32:18] with his Divine blessings that there
[1:32:19] will be no judgment strike you and if
[1:32:23] judgment strikes it can't hurt you you
[1:32:26] may be sick for a little while you may
[1:32:29] have to go through something for a
[1:32:30] little while but remember he says Christ
[1:32:33] is at the end he never said this Ark
[1:32:36] will sit in a little pool like that
[1:32:39] where it'll be just as calm as it can be
[1:32:41] no sir he never carried a flowery bed of
[1:32:44] ease he never promised things easy but
[1:32:47] he promised Grace to sustain you in the
[1:32:51] time amen we've been talking about the
[1:32:53] comfort and the time we need the
[1:32:55] comforter is times like this when times
[1:32:57] are tough we don't need the comforter
[1:32:59] when times are good we need it when
[1:33:00] times are weighing us down when
[1:33:02] decisions are difficult when it seems
[1:33:04] like everything is bearing down on us
[1:33:06] that's when we need the comforter when
[1:33:08] we're hurting when we're not sure of
[1:33:10] what's going on when we can't see so far
[1:33:12] ahead we've got to have that comforter
[1:33:14] to say it's okay I'll be with you even
[1:33:16] in you that's our rest that's our trust
[1:33:19] amen look at the Hebrew children he says
[1:33:21] the Hebrew children when they were
[1:33:23] walking to the fiery furnace to give
[1:33:25] their life they had made their stand but
[1:33:28] what happened to them they said our God
[1:33:31] is able amen right there they stood they
[1:33:34] stood on what what was their comfort in
[1:33:36] a few minutes they would be burnt to
[1:33:39] Pieces the furnace was heated seven
[1:33:41] times hotter than it ever was heated but
[1:33:44] they had
[1:33:46] Comfort we don't see them freaking out
[1:33:49] we don't see them quivering we don't see
[1:33:51] them fighting to be held back from those
[1:33:53] flames
[1:33:54] they walked willingly towards
[1:33:57] it he says why knowing this that our God
[1:34:01] is able to Deliver Us from that angry
[1:34:03] fire they their comfort was resting upon
[1:34:06] the ability of the god that they
[1:34:10] served he says that's my hope and stay
[1:34:13] I'm resting upon his ability remember
[1:34:17] what he says in me is your
[1:34:20] peace I'm resting upon his ability I'm
[1:34:23] rest in upon his grace not upon what I
[1:34:26] am what he is I'm resting upon his
[1:34:29] promise because he made the promise and
[1:34:32] he swore to the promise and I know that
[1:34:34] we have eternal life that's right the
[1:34:36] Hebrew children said he is able to
[1:34:38] deliver us nevertheless if he doesn't do
[1:34:40] it will'll never bow to your image
[1:34:45] church I'll tell you this they didn't
[1:34:46] get to that trial without having passed
[1:34:49] through some to prove the reality of God
[1:34:51] in their life remember he had spared
[1:34:53] their life multiple times he had given
[1:34:55] them favor in a place where they weren't
[1:34:57] supposed to have favor he had changed
[1:34:58] the entire process of how those young
[1:35:00] men were D dealt with how they were fed
[1:35:03] how they were housed how the king
[1:35:04] managed them it was all fitted to allow
[1:35:07] them to continue to serve God and he he
[1:35:09] made them wiser he made them smarter
[1:35:11] more intelligent more gifted than anyone
[1:35:14] else in the Kingdom why because they
[1:35:16] stayed with his word no matter what and
[1:35:19] so when the time came what happens as
[1:35:22] their faith grows the trials grow with
[1:35:24] it and when the trial comes of their
[1:35:26] actual life where he says it's bow or
[1:35:29] die they say that ain't even a choice
[1:35:32] that's what they said we don't have we
[1:35:34] don't have to stop and think about it oh
[1:35:35] King we know our answer we will not bow
[1:35:39] we will not do what you say We'll choose
[1:35:43] death they didn't have to stop and think
[1:35:45] about it their faith was such that they
[1:35:47] knew the realities of God that if they
[1:35:49] died they would go to a place that was
[1:35:50] better than where they were amen they
[1:35:53] knew that God was faithful isn't that
[1:35:56] our rest is that he's faithful that he
[1:35:59] doesn't forget his promises though he
[1:36:01] carries at times yet he never forgets
[1:36:03] his promise amen scripture says he'll
[1:36:06] never leave us or forsake us he'll be
[1:36:08] with us even to the End of the Age
[1:36:11] through good and bad through ups and
[1:36:12] downs and all of these things
[1:36:15] amen that's our comfort he said he'd
[1:36:18] always be
[1:36:19] there last section of quotes he said
[1:36:22] Moses knew
[1:36:24] when Moses had that responsibility of 2
[1:36:26] million people when he led them out of
[1:36:28] Egypt how is he going to feed them 2
[1:36:31] million people with the women packing a
[1:36:33] little bunch of needed Bread on top of
[1:36:34] their head for 40 years of Journey how
[1:36:37] is he going to feed them how many babies
[1:36:39] can be born each night in a group of
[1:36:41] people like that how many old and
[1:36:43] infirmed how many clothes will they wear
[1:36:45] out where will I get the clothes where
[1:36:47] will I feed them I've got to I've come
[1:36:49] to them as a leader how will I be able
[1:36:52] to do it
[1:36:57] as a
[1:36:58] pastor those thoughts come to me at
[1:37:00] times how can I do
[1:37:02] this I've got to be able to do it the
[1:37:04] way Moses
[1:37:05] did has nothing to do with me it's not
[1:37:09] my call it's not my people it's not my
[1:37:11] flock amen he's the great Shepherd he's
[1:37:13] the great provider he's Jehovah
[1:37:16] Gyra he says this Moses rested upon this
[1:37:20] because God said surely I'll be be with
[1:37:25] you that's his comfort surely I'll be
[1:37:27] with you that's all he needed Moses
[1:37:30] rested upon the comfort of God's promise
[1:37:32] I'll be with I'll surely be with you
[1:37:34] Moses so then it's not up to Moses to
[1:37:36] see how they're fed how you going to do
[1:37:39] it Lord Moses didn't ask that question
[1:37:41] now catch this as we start to close it's
[1:37:44] not my business to ask the questions
[1:37:47] it's not your business to ask the
[1:37:48] questions it's our business to believe
[1:37:51] him and Obey him and feel comfortable
[1:37:54] while we are resting upon his promise
[1:37:58] God said so that settles it someone said
[1:38:01] to me once brother bradam aren't you
[1:38:03] afraid when you go to the pulpit there
[1:38:04] and are called to a showdown aren't you
[1:38:06] afraid sometimes standing in that line
[1:38:09] there will be a mistake he says no
[1:38:12] sir I'm not afraid because I solemnly
[1:38:15] rest upon his word I'll be with you he
[1:38:20] says when he said to me that night no
[1:38:21] man shall stand before you all the day
[1:38:23] of your life he said I'll be with you
[1:38:26] and he has cut off every enemy catch
[1:38:29] this next line he says he has stood by
[1:38:33] me when I wasn't deserving to be stood
[1:38:36] by Hallelujah if he'll do it for a
[1:38:39] prophet he'll do it for any other child
[1:38:41] of God Amen when I don't deserve it yet
[1:38:44] he's faithful scripture says though we
[1:38:46] deny him he cannot deny us because he
[1:38:50] cannot deny
[1:38:52] himself when I I can't stand he stands
[1:38:55] anyways when I can't take it he props me
[1:38:58] up when I can't do it he does it for me
[1:39:02] and when I fail he picks up the pieces
[1:39:04] and he gets me going
[1:39:06] again but because that he promised it
[1:39:10] because of his grace I've rested
[1:39:12] solemnly upon that word right because he
[1:39:14] promised it he promised it he's able to
[1:39:17] keep what he has promised that's
[1:39:21] right he says don't you never forget the
[1:39:25] Comfort the stream of all my comfort the
[1:39:28] stream of my comfort tonight is I know
[1:39:31] that God keeps his
[1:39:34] word now I want you to notice something
[1:39:36] as we read this last portion because
[1:39:38] it's not that just God keeps his word
[1:39:40] for her or God keeps his word for him or
[1:39:43] that group listen I've got family that
[1:39:45] knows that God keeps his word but that
[1:39:47] hasn't done anything for them they know
[1:39:49] it but that hasn't done anything for
[1:39:50] them that's not enough it's not enough
[1:39:53] to know that God knows his word or God
[1:39:55] follows his word and and fulfills it
[1:39:57] brother B says this I know that
[1:39:59] something happened to
[1:40:01] me why the word has to be born in me the
[1:40:05] word has to be born in you it's not just
[1:40:07] enough to say God keeps his word you
[1:40:09] need to have a revelation that he's done
[1:40:10] it in you and he's done it in me I know
[1:40:13] I have passed from Death unto life I
[1:40:16] know that I keep his Commandments he
[1:40:18] said if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:40:20] he said if you love me do what I tell
[1:40:22] you to do let every man's word be a lie
[1:40:24] and let mine be true don't follow what
[1:40:27] man said follow what God Said and there
[1:40:30] you find the comforter and the Comfort
[1:40:32] brings you the satisfaction of knowing
[1:40:35] it's thus saith the Lord amen God bless
[1:40:39] you let's stand if we would
[1:40:42] amen amen isn't God good amen we've been
[1:40:46] promised trials and tribulations and I
[1:40:48] know we don't like it nobody likes it
[1:40:51] but we've been promised a comforter to
[1:40:53] take us through those trials and
[1:40:55] testings amen and for us they have a
[1:40:57] wonderful effect they make us Rapture
[1:40:59] Ready they make us Resurrection ready
[1:41:02] they make us ready to go to that
[1:41:03] marriage supper of the lamb and there
[1:41:06] he'll be the ultimate comforter
[1:41:07] scripture says he'll wipe the tears from
[1:41:09] our eyes there'll be no more pain
[1:41:11] there'll be no more sorrow there'll be
[1:41:13] no more death there'll be no more
[1:41:15] sickness Amen in this world we have
[1:41:17] trials and tribulations but we're going
[1:41:18] to a place that is perfect peace perfect
[1:41:21] rest and perfect Comfort amen amen God
[1:41:25] grant us to have that Comfort this
[1:41:27] evening each one let's bow our heads
[1:41:29] Heavenly
[1:41:32] Father Lord your word is here to comfort
[1:41:35] us and your spirit is here to Quicken
[1:41:37] that word in our lives and let it be a
[1:41:39] living Comfort Lord a reality inside
[1:41:41] each and every one of
[1:41:43] us Lord I know we're facing Hard Times
[1:41:47] Lord there's people here that are facing
[1:41:49] hard
[1:41:50] decisions Lord there's people here that
[1:41:52] need to stand on your word word in a way
[1:41:53] they haven't before Lord I believe we
[1:41:56] all need to Lord I believe we need to
[1:41:58] draw closer to you than we've ever drawn
[1:42:00] before Lord that we need to stand on the
[1:42:03] unchanging immovable word of God in a
[1:42:06] way that we haven't in this life Lord
[1:42:07] Jesus Lord and it takes you to do that
[1:42:10] in our lives Lord it takes your strength
[1:42:12] it takes your grace it takes your mercy
[1:42:14] takes your courage it takes your very
[1:42:16] Faith Lord God to do that Lord I pray
[1:42:18] you help us to lay down every single
[1:42:20] thing Lord every sin that easily besets
[1:42:22] us Lord every fear and every doubt Lord
[1:42:25] that you'd set us free Lord by your
[1:42:27] comfort this evening Lord that those
[1:42:29] things that are holding us back Lord
[1:42:32] that uncertainty that holds us back from
[1:42:34] fully committing to you Lord I pray your
[1:42:36] spirit would break that chain this
[1:42:37] evening Lord that we'd see the Liberty
[1:42:39] that's been offered Lord that we can
[1:42:41] have peace in a time of storm Lord that
[1:42:44] you can prepare a table before us in the
[1:42:46] presence of our enemies Lord and that we
[1:42:48] can walk through the valley of the
[1:42:50] shadow of death and have no fear Lord I
[1:42:53] pray you give us a deeper Revelation
[1:42:55] lord of the comfort of your spirit by
[1:42:56] Your Word Lord and help us to stand on
[1:42:59] it we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[1:43:03] you
