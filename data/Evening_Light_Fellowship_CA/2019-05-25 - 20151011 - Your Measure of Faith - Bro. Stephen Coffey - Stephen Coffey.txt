of the Lord this morning hey man it's good to be here you know what while you're standing this this turn in our Bibles I'd like to read a scripture before you're seated let's just jump right into the Word of God there's a wonderful atmosphere here this morning if you would turn with me to the book of Romans chapter 12 well it was beautiful weather when I got here and everybody's been telling me that I jinxed it because yesterday it was raining and miserable today was kind of shifting back towards the good side so I guess I won't say anything about the weather just let's see how it turns out but really again I'm just really thankful to be here and real honored and privileged that I'd be asked to come and speak and you know I don't consider myself to be a great speaker or anybody important because I'm not but I do know that the Lord put it on my heart to come so I came in the confidence that he would speak through me if you put it on my heart to come until then if it's not up to me than what I speak or what I wouldn't what I do with it it's up to him to do okay that's what he wants so I have a lot of faith and what faith I do have in his ability to speak to you I place into his hands so that he can speak to you and whatever need that you would have because I really I know some of you very well and so uh I know others very little but he knows you and he knows exactly what's going on songs 139 it says Lord do you know what words I have in my mouth to speak in other words you know the words that I'm going to speak next so you not only know the words that I just said but you know exactly what I'm going to say next we can have a lot of confidence in that if that be true either believe it's true or you don't see the true or it's not I happen to believe that it is true and if it be true that I put the faith that I have that it is truth into his hands and he'll accomplish what he sets out to accomplish so again this very excited to be here and this is the last service and just gonna speak what's on her heart and try to wrap up what we've been talking about this weekend and pray that the Lord would bless that right so if you would turn your attention to the scripture now just for a second Romans chapter 12 let's start at verse 3 I heard a man say one time if there was any book that you'd want to have if you were stuck on an island it'd be the book of Romans he said out of any book in the Bible if you were stuck in an island you could pick just one book that you would want to have it be the book of Romans the Apostle Paul says here in Romans chapter 12 and verse 3 he says fry I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly and that word that word means with self-control I think with self-control think with Sabrina think of your own self then he says this phrase according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith so he uses this phrase the measure of faith that God hath dealt to every man so he's saying that every man has a measure of faith that God hath dealt to him and he's talking about gifts he's saying service that could the Christian life and service and the different gifts that we have among the body but then he says don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to think of yourself think of yourself with self-control subrata sober because God hath dealt you the exact measure of faith and that you will need to accomplish what he's given you let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we're again thankful for this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord and we don't take it for granted Lord that we're here this morning because I know it's it's all by your grace that we have this building you have heat in the building that we have each other that we have family we have friends we have the family of God it's only by your grace that we're here Lord and we don't want to take that for granted we thank you Lord for this opportunity and I ask if there'd be anything that would hinder the moving of your Holy Spirit which I have confidence that you can do if there'd be anything that can that would hinder that and I pray that you just remove it from the building remove it from our minds remove it from our hearts take it away and we humbly submit ourselves into your presence and into your word bring our hearts and our minds and subjection to the word of God granite lets you make that this morning bring us one step further give us something that we can walk away from this service and say did not our hearts burn within us when we were there in your gracious name that we pray a name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated thank you well let's get right into the word and them again just to bring everybody up to date who if you weren't here on the the past services we we saw brother Branham he preached that there's either faith or fear that dominates the entire world and it's either fear that's gonna grip your your being and drive you to do the things that you do or it will be faith that will take ahold of you and drive you to do the things that God wants you to do so if you look at it it's fear that men built the greatest fortresses on the face of the earth so it was by a fear that men developed the greatest businesses that they've ever made they they make more monies in living in fear that they won't be able to live with what they've got that's why a man would be driven to make more money and make more money and then lust is given there and then the fear can come in because lust is it so because Satan has a stronghold in the in the individual then fear can come right in and then take the whole person over and then we see that it is true that it's either faith or fear that someone is driven by so as soon as is as soon as Satan has that Avenue into the human being and you give him that you give him that place in your mind and in your spirit realm then Satan has a right to be there and there could be all kinds of spirits now coming in and giving that person a lot of trouble simply because you gave Satan a right to be there has no right to be in my life because I'm a believer well that's not true at all because you can give place to the devil just because you're born again and Holy Ghost filled doesn't mean that you can't look over here and look to the right or to the left you can give plates to the devil and then he has a right to be there and then the tormentors can come in and all spear all kinds of spirits can then come in and be tormenting you for a year and years and years simply because you've allowed something to have place in your spirit realm it could be true if you if you have a lust and you've been dealing with lust for years and years and years or if someone set something against you and you develop a root of bitterness you develop and you've give place to the devil by dwelling on that in the wrong attitude and the wrong spirit and Satan has a perfect right to be there then and and all the spirits are and you're dealing with lust and all of these kinds of things simply because you have a root of bitterness in your heart it's only until you expose Satan can he leak and he has to flee when he's exposed a spirit does not want to be exposed and the one thing that is in common with all of that is that there is a fear always there so it's either faith or fear that dominates the human being now we know then that the scripture says to fear God and it is the duty of a man to fear God you either you either is it is the entire duty and Solomon said that looking back and at his age and his wisdom he says that it's the duty of a man to fear God with fear not in the not in the respect of to be afraid of him you fear out of reverence so he said it is the duty of man to reverence God in a way that in and to have a certain approach to God in a way that he can honor so he's not obligated to honored if you're not approaching him in the correct way and then Solomon said to fear God and keep his Commandments and when you simply come at God with the respect and the reverence to fear him and then you Allah allow and then you move the wrong kind of fear out of your life then faith can take a hold because brother branham said and the reason I say that is because the Prophet said that if as long as there's the slightest bit of fear there that faith can't move moving your pin your beam you cannot have faith and fear at the same time so you said if you as long as you have fear in there then God cannot work with you you can't grow you can't go further you can't achieve the things that you want to in God you can't be where you should be with God as long as there's that little aspect so you move the fear out and you come to a place and you approach God with reverence and respect and you come to God in a certain way just simply just coming to him and in giving yourself to him with a reverence that gives God the opportunity to come in and the avenue to come in and with the correct approach and he'll come in and faith can take a whole hand so that's where we're at now this morning I'd like this just bring it one step further we're taking one step we'll take another step let's take it one step further well the random says in now in 1958 and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now again the Prophet was subject to progressive revelation he said in 1958 I don't I don't see one thing left to hinder the coming of the Lord Jesus tonight he says that sounds rather erratic but it's it is the truth all the prophecies pertaining to his second coming as far as I know is already fulfilled and it was not 1963 yet the seals had not yet been broken and he said I don't see anything that would hinder the moving of the coming of the Lord tonight he said as far as I know all the prophecies are done but there was still something yet to be done and he says so if that be true if if the Lord would come tonight then what kind of a people should we be and Peter said knowing that the the coming of the Lord is nigh what kind of people should we be and he says any minute let's let's live in this meeting and he was in Chattanooga Tennessee he said let's live in this meeting like it would be the last service that we ever had every service I ever preached I always preach it like it's going to be the last one that anybody will ever hear because it could be and I hope this one is what we don't know we have to we have to live like it is he said what kind of people should we be knowing that the coming of the Lord is here a perfect people living the scripture out to the letter of the law without any error is that the kind of people we should be well we know that we are not because firfer since Christ has come actually since the dawn of time man has never been able to completely fulfill the law on his own so we know then that if that be the case then we cannot be a perfect person acting out the scripture perfectly without any error whatsoever on our own hey man so you simply will net what you you will never come to perfection in the flesh because the flesh is never born again so then that if okay or if we're supposed to be a glorious church without spot or wrinkle as the scripture says we're supposed to be then how on earth are we supposed to be that if our Tabernacles are never perfect and are never born again because if we're born again then what aspect of that achieves in us the perfection that Christ is looking for I mean come on if if it doesn't link up there's got to be there's got to make sense because if it doesn't link up then I don't want to believe it if there's one contradiction in scripture or one contradiction in my ability to fulfill Scripture then I don't want to believe it because if I can't fulfill what God gave me to fulfill what's the point I mean come on what's the point so in 1965 brother Branham says and now this was after he had the full revelation of what God had used him for okay so this is this is exactly what he was standing with the understanding now and the wisdom to look back and say now it actually is fulfilled but then he added something else and he says the first comes the the message and the bride together the next is the direction of the sleeping bride and the one's died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast of the heavens in the sky and all this things and then he says we're right there now we're ready now and the only thing the church coming out he doesn't say I don't see anything else he says now the only thing the church coming out to lay before the Sun as owen to ripen and then after a while the great combine will come by and the wheat will be burned this the stocks will be burned and the grain will be gathered into his gun so he was standing in 1958 and said there's nothing there so what kind of people should we be in 1965 he adds it and he says we're right there now now it actually is the time but the bride has to lay in the presence of the Sun just like the seed has to lay the president to the Sun and ripen what does that even mean when when it when it comes in context to and people who are now fifty years from that point and standing here and we're still believing the same thing that we did back then how does that even relate to us now because it has I don't again I don't want to have something that doesn't relate to me right now if God is a living God and he is the same yesterday today and forever then that means that there's something for me right now and I want that I mean what goodness it what what point is is there for me living if there is not something in this for me right now so he says after a wild it just has to lay in the presence of the Sun and ripen and then after a while the great combine will come by so the thing about it is the worst thing that anybody could do any Minister could do anybody could do is complicate this it is not you try to explain it you try to pursue it and you try to think it and put it together it just doesn't work that way and it's a revelation from God and that's a gift so you can't just just put it together and make it work it's a gift from God to understand this it's just you can't complicate it the worst thing that you can do to the new birth is try and complicated and try to explain it amen you can't explain it and there is you know we teach it but you just can't complicate it that's the worst thing that you can do a birth the new birth there are five aspects to great grace not great drinks and great is another subject but great there are five aspects to grace stay focus and I always you always look at it in the justification sanctification in the baptism the Holy Spirit we know that but if you look at it just for a second you step back it's by grace that we are saved through faith right amen so it's it's by grace that we are saved through faith so then faith that is the thing that we are saved by and it's by grace that we were done that so that means that the new birth would be an act of grace but grace is five there are five works - grace well there's justification sanctification and the baptism the Holy Spirit that regenerates a believer so then if it's a work of grace then what are the other two things that means then that they're had and if you the the type is the natural birth and you cannot beat the type you want to not complicate it go back to the type so the birth what happens well there's conception which is what happened to us in the foundation of the world we were either formed in the in the in the mind of God before the foundation of the world ever was or we were now the arthur pink said it best he said if God just said whosoever will will come to me then how could he have been sure that anybody would come there had to have been a production aided group and I'm looking there had to be a predestinate a group well that's that's the conception now then you come to the water and the blood and the birth but that's only for aspects because there's conception and then there's the water that breaks in there's the blood that comes in then there's the baby that comes but that's only four and if it's a it's if it's five a work of grapes and there has to be another one and the thing about it is is that the birth is meant to produce the baby it's meant to produce a living breathing kicking screaming baby it's not meant just to produce a life and then it's a grown human being and it's done the birth is meant to produce a life that is lived over a long period of time and that is in the hands of God so when you are birthed into Christ you become a living being you become a kicking screaming baby when you're first birthed into Christ and that takes justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit and then you're birthed into you receive the Holy Ghost and you're sealed into Christ at that moment and there's nothing at all to that except faith you believe that's all there is to it it's not complicated so when you you believe now with the faith that you need to accomplish this task which is a gift from God then you become a life that you now live for Christ and once you are a life that you live for Christ you can't backslide you can lose your testimony but you can never lose your salvation you are sealed into Christ and that is it and you either believe that or you don't you're going to either have fear or you're gonna have faith in that matter so when you're in this point in time when you are living the life of that that the that the birth produced and you have the life that you are now living there's there can be fear that get creeps in through the spirit realm and the avenues that Satan will use to get into you and you can actually be all confused and messed up and all over the place or there will be faith there and you can produce the maturity that God wants to bring by the sea laying in the Sun to ripen so you see now he says we're right here ready now but now the seed has got to lay in the Sun was just like there now it's just like with a believer they'd be there a birth into Christ they receive the baptism the spirit there sealed into Christ but they've got to produce something and it starts with faith now the whole plan of God and this is the amazing thing that the the prophets ministry brought to us is that we can understand the the plan that God had for us so it's not some complicated mystical thing it's not that because you can understand all of the doctrines and all of the mysteries and you can understand all of that and not have perfect love and be nothing and be completely void of any growth of anything manifestation or manifesting of God's Spirit in your in your life you can be void of that when you don't have love so in Colossians now 1:15 you don't have to turn to it he says Colossians 1:15 he says who is the image of the invisible God and he's talking about Christ the logos because at the beginning it was God and all of the attributes that God was he poured into Christ I need you to stick with me and listen up because I'm going fast but I'm just gonna touch some points we'll wrap it all together so if he missed the points and you're gonna be sticking hat out of the package and I don't want you to sticking out of the package so we're gonna wrap it up together so you have to stick with me and he says all that Christ wants he are all that God was he poured into Christ so now Christ the logos was the very attributes of God and that was the manifestation of God that was the first thing so this is what Paul is talking about to the people of colossal who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are then that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell and if you ever have any problems with the Trinity and people say well it always says the father and the son there's always the father in the son so if they made that denotation then obviously there's a separation there well you can't have scripture go against scripture and Jesus said that I and my father are one if you've seen me you've seen the father so if that be true then you can apply it to this scripture because they can't disagree with each other so Christ was the if it pleased the father that in Christ all the fullness to dwell not Jesus of Nazareth because that was only one attribute that God fulfilled the attribute of redemption it was Christ the logos that was that Paul is talking about it and Christ is to have the preeminence in all things all things and if that be true then Christ is supposed to have the preeminence in my life another thing that I can do to disallow God's preeminence in my life hey man and brother branham said the Christ is a mystery of God revealed and this is the most this is my favorite quote and I don't think you should have favorite quotes but this is my favorite quote Christ is a mystery of God revealed which some perhaps about David sermon 1963 he says first this is God's three full plan this is it everybody listen this is it he says first to express his self completely God in Christ when he did that second to have the eminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them so first was to express himself in Christ which he did so he's now the low Goff sees everything and he wants to have preeminence and everything second to have a bride a church that he could express himself through them by and thus have the preeminence through them so it was it was God in Christ and Christ in His Church and house God's plan and then by that thirdly to restore the kingdom to it's rightly position and fell by sin by the first Adam the back where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with him and fellowship with God wanted and then awesome he simply wanted to manifest himself in Christ the logos which is the it's it's everything the beginning in the first the end is everything manifests himself in that and then have us to manifest Venna fest himself through on the earth and then by that bring us back to himself so that we could dwell back where it was intentionally supposed to be in the Garden of Eden so God had a plan but he wanted to bring the bride through the bring the bride through what we've been brought through and by Jesus of Nazareth give us access into what we can now be brought back into which is what God's plan was in the beginning to bring us back to what it was in the Garden of Eden so you think well why did he have to bring us all the way through that well if you ever thought character is the only thing we bring with us to heaven why is character the only thing that we bring with us to heaven is because we had to quit we are too the scripture says if we want to reign with him we must suffer with him we had to go through this character building process which Peter said those through many many fold just for a season you'd be tested that the trying of your faith remember now it's faith that the testing of your faith would produce just as like gold so you're bringing brought through this process now where your faith and your character is being built so that you can reign with him and just as king and a queen would ring and if cannot reign or rule characterless so a power without character is satanic so he wanted to bring you through to get the character that you needed to bring you back to what he wanted you to be at the at the beginning that to me makes me happy very few things in planet Earth it'll make me fly fishing and the duck hunting and fish and chips probably a few other things but but this makes me happy that he would that this is the plan this is the plan and when what what on earth what what on earth did you have to be back there in the mind of God that he would want you to be here and you back to that so if you had no capability or no ability whatsoever to be brought to that then how could you have any capability to remove yourself from it if God intentionally in purpose you my predestination to be there then what could you do to be out of there because you didn't do it you didn't have any ability that that brought you into it because it was God that conceived you into it so what could you do then to be brought out of it what could you do then to exclude yourself from them he brought to you on the basis of free moral agency but it was something inside of you that responded to the message not you so it's free moral agency and you you responded to that on the basis of free moral agency so that he could bring you back into it to then bring you back to the same spot that he wanted you to him so we have this idea of when brother Branham said well what kind of people should we be we should be perfect people and we should be this and you think well Christianity is then okay that I've got to produce this perfect life well there's been nobody on the face of the earth that's ever been able to produce a person for a perfect life but then you look at this thing now and you see that the plan of God was to have preeminence in Christ and then preeminence in his church and then bring us back to the beginning in the Garden of Eden which is what he intended well what does that have to do with me and how if I can't produce the life that that I see in the scripture and I think so many times we we look at the scripture and we look at the the profit we look at the message and we think that we do not see the realities of the promises of God manifesting in our life and right there a doubt is brought brought into our minds that we simply do not see and you might think that it is it comes across my mind so many times in a day that I just don't feel like the the promises are being manifested in my life that is nothing but a lie of the devil because it's not it's not the perfect life the that that you live on a fleshly basis that brings you into this kingdom or that had anything to do with the birth or had anything to do with this plan of God because it's flesh it's never born again and it has nothing to do with that and and because we live in the flesh and we we think in the flesh and we think with our mind and we maneuver around with our five senses we use the five senses to then approach the Word of God and it does nothing for us except give Satan an Avenue into our spirit to doubt the Word of God so you understand you you approach the Word of God with the five senses because that's how you approach everything in life and therefore the promises of God become void in your life simply because you're approaching it with something that can produce nothing the flesh profiteth nothing it is the spirit that quickeneth so that is why then that God had to give a human being a sixth sense for them to be able to approach Scripture with a gift from God that is not attained by fleshly means to approach the scripture with which then he could manifest something through us that is not by fleshly means and because the flesh fell and thereby he showed his attribute as a redeemer to redeem us back into that which was eternal so because we fell we then we have it fell into the the the flesh is what we did and then by that he gave us a he manifested himself in Christ as a redeemer to bring us back into it through the new birth to bring us back into the Word of God in an unadulterated way and then gave us a sixth sense to approach it with whereby he could manifest what he needed to manifest now let's explain there has to be a placement of faith there has to be a correct place where your faith is placed in now we see here that there was given to every man the measure the measure of faith so he was given something he was given a certain of just a little aspect of faith and he needed to accomplish what he was given to do and this is what Paul is saying and he stays talking about the gifts he says for through grace given unto me to every man among you don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to in other words and what I draw from that is and if you look at it in the context of our text he says don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to because what you do is then you use flesh and you use your ability to look at what you've been given the gift that you have been given and then you use flesh to think about it and then you eat and then it's my flesh that you approach the Word of God and the promises of God and that can do nothing to get you back into the stream of that that cycle that God has that threefold manifestation that God has the flesh can do nothing to get you into that so he says now there's a major of faith that you have been given to accomplish that which you have been given to accomplish so we see then now that if God has a purpose now of bringing us full cycle back to the plan of back to the Garden of Eden back to where it was where he walked in the cool of the evening back to what we really want to have then there had to be a way that you would have to get back into that and that's the promise of God that we were made more than conquerors we're a glorious stripped without spot or wrinkle the the direct manifestation of Christ into this earth giving God the preeminence in our lives and by the preeminence is he which he was express himself through his church and then by that bring them back to that place where they need to be so he gave us a promise then to be brought back to where we need to be so we have the promise and that promise was through a rapture that we would be we would go through the the season that a plant goes through so we'd have the church goes through seven ages where they're perfected and the plant grows in the stock comes in the seed buds and it's the the analogy is wheat a wheat plant and all through scripture he says a grain of wheat a corn of wheat a kernel of wheat a kernel of wheat and he used his wheat to say and to look at the life of a believer in the life of the church yes so then you see now it just fits so perfectly it's just you don't have you try and explain it you get a long messed up and man and and and I get it all messed up and you just it just it shouldn't be that way and it's just it's it's a plant that grows up and then the wheat at the last day it sits with its ripened in the Sun and it becomes the seed and it's got to just ripen a little bit then a farmer when he when he has a wheat field and it's ready its nearing harvest which were nearing harvest we're nearing that time where we're being brought back to now it was supposed to be so real close to that so that's to make you happy right anything should make you happy right so we've come you know full cycle now it's all happening now we're just right here at this moment he said but they just took the right pin a little bit so we're right there but the farmer would come out into the field and he'd pick a kernel of wheat and he'd press on it then if he couldn't make a dent in the seat it wasn't ready so nearing the harvest time the wheat now it would be seed again but it wasn't ripened yet so it just had delay in that August heat and that September heat I don't even know when weed is harvested but it had to lay in the in the in the atmosphere that was harsh and it was everything was dying and everything was going into the the winter cycle and everything was dying and then just fading out there which is the Seventh Seal everything just kind of fades out and fades out the fades out and the coming of the Lord right so we're in that season now and in the farmer would just come out and press on it well if he couldn't make a dent in it that it wasn't ready so he had to just go back and he'd watch TV and eat country fried steak and do whatever farmers do and then the next morning he'd come out I don't know a farmers do that but I just lord bless all the farmers among us and he'd come out in the field and he'd pushed on the wheat and if it wasn't ready he'd go back and do the same thing where the farmers do then he come out the next morning he'd push on it and that the see it just you couldn't make a dent in it because it wasn't right they were gonna seed it was wheat seed there was no doubt to the fact that it was seed that it produced exactly what went into the ground so what the seed that went into the ground he was now holding it in his hand he was it was definitely seed but it just wasn't ripened enough and just there was something not right so you just press on and then one day he'd come out and he presently make a dent he said fire up the combine boys we're ready and then they're come on come by and they'd harvest the seed and it would be done then they go to the gardeners well there's a little part of portion in between the gardener and the field and that's called the threshing floor and that's where I am now because that's when the wheat was beaten and everything was beaten in and then they throw it up in the air and all of the breeze would carry the stalk away everything that was not supposed to be there in the garner then it would just be original see the exact replica of what would not to be it's fascinating oh just in itself just in the natural type but it's the same with us and you can't beat your types and the quickest way to get complicated is to mess up your type the type is the seed and the natural birth so we have the natural birth and we have this thing so now the way that we get back and were right there now the way that we get back into that is through a sixth sense which carries us all the way through because the Prophet said that faith is the victory and scripture says in 11 of Hebrews 11:6 that you cannot please God without faith because you first must believe that he is you have to believe that he is God it's so simple you just simply have to believe that he is gone you believe that he is God and here's the reward of those who diligently seek Him this is the process of seeking Him alone God will reward if he if you believe that he is but you cannot please God without the faith needed to accomplish this task to get back to where he wanted us to be so therefore faith you see the importance of faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen so it is that thing that that is it is there that but yet it's not there so it's the evidence of things that are not seen it is it is something that is not flesh whatsoever there is nothing that you can do by human ability to attain faith they just simply can't do it try as we may we simply can't do it hey that's why it scripture says it is my grace that you are saved through faith it is a gift of God unless any man should boast which is what the Pharisees did because they were living the letter of the law and yet they were complete hypocrites because they were simply approaching God in a fleshly way they were not approaching God in the correct way and so then you can see from simply from the Pharisees life that when you approach the Word of God and the promises of God and I'm speaking about this threefold cycle what we want to do because so many times we get wrapped up with the with the things that we do wrong and I I don't ever try to preach to somebody you better stop cutting your hair or you better stop smoking I don't think I've ever told anybody you shouldn't smoke or you shouldn't cut your hair brother Branham said he was with the guy and the guy was smoking and the guy that I guess you're gonna tell me to quit smoking brother Graham said no I'm not gonna tell you quit smokin keep smoking they said I thought you were a Christian brother branham he said no I am a Christian well I have no right to tell you to stop smoking all I have to do is preach Christ to you and the life that is in Christ will actually take the desire out of you for smoking because if it's flesh that gets you out of smoking eventually someone will get right back into the the the need for nicotine that they left from and so it takes it's a horrible thing for someone it can quit smoking by natural means but it's only God that can completely take the desire of it and you you guys know that my dad knows that he is dead said he smoked everything that he could possibly smoke and then he said two weeks after he was baptized he reached his hand in his pockets and he pulled the cigarettes out and they realized I used to smoke there was something that was taken out of him that flesh could never have taken out of it so you see it's it's when you approach the word of God and you say I want to do this and I want to believe this and I want to do this then eventually you're going to get right back to the same spot and say I wanted to do this but I can't do it and then you're going to get right back to the same spot and Satan will be right there on your shoulder every single time to produce fear in your spirit realm and then pretty soon you're gonna allow him to stronghold and then all kinds of things will start coming into your life and lust and cheating and all these kind of things the desire to do those things but when you're when you're birthed into Christ you're made a new creation you're sealed into Christ the Spirit which is the only part of a man that is eternal that was in Christ at the beginning so your flesh of his flesh bone of his bone so Christ took the very part of him himself out and placed it in the spirit realm in in the soul in the soul of a man and so it's not me that has anything to do with it it was the very nature and flesh and bone of Christ that was placed into my soul so if it be the very nature and flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then there's nothing that flesh has to do with it it's simply the life of Christ that is in me so I simply need to then approach God in the correct way that is spirit which this the word is the seed then that that's the word that's that's inside of you because Christ in the word are the same thing so if it's Christ then that's inside of you that very nature of his nature the flesh of his flesh the bone of his bone and he predestinated to be in you before the foundation of the world if that be truth and that be inside of your soul then the water is the Holy Spirit so if you have the word because Christ in the word are the same thing and you're made that very part of you that is predestinated to be there which is sealed into Christ it is the very nature of then that since the word if that is if that be in your soul then the water that comes down which is the Holy Spirit it presses through the native the seed the outside of that seed and it bring forth life and so it's the water it's merely presenting yourself and then placing yourself into the right atmosphere so that the seed that is in you can bring forth the life it is not the flesh that brings forth the life and keeps the life there it is Christ that keeps you because it was his very nature that is in you and it is his very spirit that brings that nature out so you think oh I need to stop smoking and I need to stop doing this I really I don't I don't care if you smoke all I want to do is preach Christ to you because the life of Christ is what will reach down into that soul which is what my flesh and my words could never do for you so I could preach to you Tom blue in the face but it's not gonna do a thing for you you keep living like you're living if you want to cut your hair you keep cutting your hair but I am going to preach the word because I happen to have something inside of me that is sealed into Christ that I know that the word is truth so if I preach it then we create an atmosphere and he says if two or three gather in my name I will be with them then that creates an atmosphere white whereby his spirit can come down and anoint the seed that is within you and therefore this the desires are just they drop they just completely drop often and that's what produces a birth there is no creature on the face of the earth that can make a man stop smoking he can prevent from smoking but there's always that aspect in his heart that desires to smoke because it gets into the very chemicals of his brain and messes with it so there's always that desire to smoke a preacher can never take that away only Christ could take that away and because he chose to smoke the effects of which will always be in his natural body he might have lung problem he might have many different things because he chose to smoke and he made the mistake but it's only Christ who could take the desire away and then heal his body if he would so choose so this brings us to a place now where you see that you have a portion of faith that is given to you and what I want you to understand this morning is that once fear is out of the equation the wrong kind of fear then you with reverence and respect approach God in a certain way and that gives God the opportunity to come in and work and then faith can take a hold but what the thing about it is is that he has given to you the exact amount of faith that you need to accomplish what he has given you to accomplish so brother Brandon had a certain amount of faith to allow him to do the things that he did and I have a certain amount of faith that God predestinated in me and gives me a measure for when it is quickened and when fears out of the equation the Holy Spirit can come down and buy that seed that was in me when I was birthed into Christ that Holy Spirit comes down and bubbles up from the inside and what I do is I place that that part of me that was eternal and I placed my faith in his hands and then hid by his spirit and by that word that was already in me he produces that which I need to produce and the problem is is that Steven coffee gets in the way and messes it up but as long as I am going back to that place where I know that he can manifest in me what he needs and I constantly daily died to myself my flesh which is never born again and I placed myself on the basis of the Word of God and say Lord this is the Word of God I believe it's true and if you are really a Living God then I believe you can manifest this word in me and all you do as the scripture says to wait upon the Lord and he shall renew your strength you shall mount up with wings like eagles if you wait upon the Lord all you do is you don't simply try to meddle with it and produce it in yourself you simply lay in the presence of the Sun and he ripened you because you are basing your faith on the basis of the word and not on a fleshly desire to accomplish it by the letter of the law that is how a life of God is produced is you place yourself and you place that part of you that was eternal onto the basis of the word and the Holy Spirit which is the water comes and he brings the life out of that seed but he has given you the exact measure of faith that you need to be brought fullcycle back to this spot back to what it was in the Garden of Eden so don't worry that you're not going to be ending up here exactly like God wants you because he had an image of what he wants you to be like that's his job not yours to stop worrying about that and just place yourself in the right atmosphere and place and base your faith on the basis of the word so that he can bring you back full cycle to what he wants you to be it's his job in the first place it's not yours so submit yourself to him and humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he might exalt you in due time it's nothing that you could do you simply place yourself in his basis and if he be a living God then put him to the test if he can do it then then by George let him do it and don't dare try to tell me that he can because I had a disease that nobody understands I had Lyme disease nobody could understand it it's weird disease it's weird it's cracked it's just weird nobody understands it and you say oh that's that's impossible we understand the disease nobody understands blind disease they approach it and they know how to treat it and they know how to do this but they don't fully understand it and I had it but what what I did was is that I knew that I had this disease then I had this sickness and it was brutal it was just brutal because it just messes with a bunch of different things and it's not as bad as other diseases but it can be brutal and for me it just made me sick and I just annoying you know and a sickness is an interruption in the perfect plan of God that's what it is so he I had this disease and what I did was I knew that the Bible said if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover and I also knew that he said that God said I am the Lord that healeth all our diseases so it's either true or it's not and you know I don't really have to do anything for God to prove his own word God interprets and proof says don't work it's God God proves his own word you don't have to do anything about it if you don't believe it don't believe it you'll answer for it God will prove his own word so I merely took just just a tiny bit of faith because I'm nobody special I'm an ordinary man just like the scripture said that Noah was an ordinary man I'm just you know I'm just a regular guy there's nothing special in me you have to realize that just because this happened to me doesn't mean that I'm any more special than you it just simply means that I know it works and you can see that it worked too because I did it so I nearly took the little measure of faith that God gave to me which he says he will do and he says he has given to you which is by grace so therefore you're not ought to think highly of yourself so he gave me that little measure of faith and what I did is I said Lord if you be a living God and if you really be the same yesterday and today and forever then I believe the scripture and I place myself on the basis of the word and I say if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you said you are the Lord that heals all of your diseases the ones they don't really understand and the ones they do so therefore I place myself and I went up and got paid for and the brother prayed for me was brother Sean Martin and dad and another brother brother Josh Bennett in North Carolina and they all over there and they prayed for me and I was healed right there on the spot now that happened to me before because I had really bad food allergies I was allergic to corn wheat dairy and corn wheat dairy and some kind of a fit some kind of a fish and some kind of a meat and it would cause me to have really bad migraine headaches if you've never had migraine headaches then don't presume you know what they feel like because someone who has had migraine headaches knows what they feel like excruciating and I was healed when I was thirteen from that and that's also when I gave my heart to the Lord and I was healed it's at the same time so I know that he could have done it so I had faith enough to present myself to God on the basis of his word and He healed me on the spot and I don't have Lyme disease anymore others right there's you know effects on your body that has obviously you know from even from the medication as effects from the body and I have but I don't have lyme disease anymore man and i went back to the doctor i said check me check me because if god is real then i'm not afraid if lyme disease shows back up on your test because it's not me who took it away it's not me who's gonna heal me it's God so God can prove it he helped prove himself do you test me again is so actually it and it wasn't what I expected because nothing in life is really as you expected and she said why I can't test it I can't test it the same because Lyme disease won't it won't react to the same because the medication has changed it's probably you did it now so you won't be able to see it but she said but if you really believe that then let's let's take you off all the medication so I said take me off all the medication so if I went back now I've got a blood test there wouldn't be one ounce of Lyme disease in my body in Lyme disease always sticks with you it says it will never leave you it'll always stick with you and I was healed right there on the spot and I don't have Lyme disease anymore and I don't have food allergies at all and I haven't had a migraine headache since I was 13 years old since I got prayed for at the moment I got prayed for I haven't had one single migraine headaches now what that is I'm thankful for that I'm really thankful for that well what that was is that there's no doctor who could ever have healed my food out of these functions and taking that away not one not one on the face of the earth and I eat all of that kind of stuff in multitude and I don't get migraine headaches anymore so God healed me from that and what that was was simply my faith being placed on the basis of the word and God had then heaven and he had an avenue to come and do the work through me because I gave my measure of faith into his hands it wasn't me because I knew that there was nothing that I had to do I simply had to surrender and present myself into his hands and he did the work it's the same with the birth it's the same if you've been in the message or you've been birthed for 30 years or a hundred years it's the same if you're struggling with something or you're just starting or you just want to you want to give your heart to the God you have given your heart to God you're nearing your life to ending your you know is it's the same all the way through all you simply do is present your measure of faith into his hands and he does the work and I am a testimony to the fact that he will do it because he is a Living God so don't try to tell me that he's not living and don't try to tell me that he can fulfill his promises because I am a living testimony to the fact that he will you cannot convince me that he won't do it I know he can because he's proven it to me he proved it to me simply because I gave what little tiny faith an ordinary guy has there's nothing special and I gave it to him and he did the the he fulfilled the promise of his word through his spirit it wasn't flesh it was just me giving it myself to him it was the same when the little boy came up to us and they were had the great multitudes and Jesus was just sitting there preaching you know and all the disciples are how you gonna feed all these people because they're coming you know that we can't afford search potluck like this so we're gonna have to do something because we can't feed all these people they're poor and can't afford anything what are we gonna do so there's a little kid sitting over there you know scrawny little kid sitting over the corner and he had a little lunch which his mother faithfully had packed for him and he had you know a few fishes and few clothes few fish and loaves of bread and he was just sitting there you know and either this the story is true or it's not either you believe it but it's not when I'm a testimony to the fact that he can take what you give into his hands and fulfill this promise through hey I know it's true I believe so the child came up and he gave he said can we use your fish he said just bring bring bring what you've got bring what you've got and place it in here before me so you see now the key you have to bring what you've got and lay it before so you don't have to have this big faith to move mountains and everything and say oh I I don't bring my perfect my perfect life before you because none of us have that to give you simply bring what you got and if God placed something there before the foundation of the world you've got something all you have to do is bring that the measure of faith which he has given you and now place it in the right place so all he did know is he came they placed it in the hands of Jesus and Jesus all of a sudden this and then there's the fish and most feed an army and so all he did now is take just a little few fishes and loaves and then God multiplied it and produce something out of nothing simply because he had something to work with you see it you see how it worked he gave what he had into the hands of Jesus and that's what did the work it was Jesus who did the work not not the child he simply gave what he had into the hands of Jesus and be not afraid 1963 the Prophet says now the little boy that little lunch that he had wasn't very much in his hands but when he let what he had go into Jesus hands the fed thousands you say well I wish they had great faith but what little faith you've got you've got faith enough to come to church and then if you've got faith that much faith why don't you just give it over into the hands of Jesus and it'll feed thousands if you it's not much in your hands but once placed in his hands then it'll do miracles if you just let what faith you've got into his hands so you understand you say oh now faith can take a hold because all the fear is out of my life and with reverence I approach God you think oh that all that uh then now that I've got the faith then now I can start walking and in a second Peter the first chapter he says add to your faith virtue add to this there is a process that you go through to add to your faith but faith is the foundation so yes there are things that you can attain because there is a difference between what you can attain and what you inherit and that part of you that was inside of you is what your inherent because it's God who put that in you and you get it regardless because it's healing who put it within you but there are things that you can attain unto and there's a difference between what you've inherited that lays within you and there's a difference between what you can attain that's why he rebuked the servant who took his talent and put it in the ground and it achieved nothing he had a talent you know the money he had that neat piece of money but he put it in the ground and did nothing with it and he rebuked the servant and said that's unfaithful why would you have done that but the servant who went out and did something with what he was given he attained unto more and doubled it you simply have what you give what you have into the hands of Jesus and he'll feed thousands and I don't believe that this is Jesus of Nazareth because that was God's redemptive act you give what you have into the hands of Christ which is the very manifestation of God the logos which is the life of God you place what you have in that and it's on the basis of his word because Christ and the word are the same thing so when you take what you've got and you say Lord I know that I can be born again I know that I can have the Holy Ghost I know that I can live these things it might not be for the next 40 years but I'm not I'm not gonna have anything to do with the world I'm gonna try to I'm just gonna try to focus myself on this and yes I'm gonna slip up but I'm gonna focus myself and die daily and come back to this and come back to it and come back to it because I know that that is the fountain which with that drama strength from man so it's the daily life and now you can bring in the aspect of the daily struggles that we go through it's the daily life that you come back to this basis and then you build on the basis and you grow in faith and your faith begins to grow just as the seed grows but he said you have to you have to come in Luke 17 Jesus was sitting with the disciples and they were just talking back and forth I think they were talking about forgiveness and forgiving one another and one of the disciples leaned up and he said Lord increase our faith and it was the Greek is pissed off pissed ease which is um gonna written out the Greek word and he says increase our faith don't don't let us be a void of it he says uh faith this Greek word means belief and Trust confidence and devotion and faithfulness and this disciples said Lord increase our faith they increase my trust in you increase our confidence in you he said and he turned around he said all you need is the grain of a mustard seed that's that's all you need to start anytime you're good just the little measure that he has given you however big it is however small it may be he said just the little measure that's all I need and as a grain of a mustard seed goes into the ground it's the smallest seed that you could imagine you barely see it in your hand and yet it produces this big plant this big thing and he said that's all you need just give it the right atmosphere let the water come over it let the ground grab a hold of it let the foundation grab a hold of it let the water come over it and it'll produce something that you couldn't imagine because it's not flesh it's me you just have to give it back to me and it will produce what you want to produce the problem is is that you have the seed and you have that little measure and then you bring it back and then you slip it up and you're doing all these things and you're doing all these things and Satan then all of a sudden gets the avenues into the spirit ground because he has five of them and he gets into those spirit realms and then you're all of a sudden losing your focus and then you're all over the place then all of a sudden you're letting things come into your life that a believer should have nothing to do with that is not godly it's not holy and then you're allowing all these things in your life in your wonder oh why can't I ever do this and everything like that are you coming back onto the basis of the word and placing what you have into these hands because either the scripture is true or it is not you let God prove his own word there's nothing that I could preach to you to say I do this five step process and you'll have this yeah you simply have to give it to Christ and he does the work but I know that he can I know that he can if you have faith that as a grain of a mustard seed you might say to this sycamore tree bit get the plucked up by the root and be planted into the sea and it should obey you wish yeah yeah we you know anybody picked up a sycamore tree lately you know and we think in fleshly terms I then you go to the nearest tree and you're just kind of looking at it yeah you know you're trying to get to move and you understand how quickly your flesh just responds to what the word says there's nobody my fleshly means who could by word alone pick up the sycamore tree except the manager of a tree company but that's another subject altogether there's nobody by word alone who could say pick this tree up and be planted at sea and it would obey you you tell me one one person on the face of the earth who could do that by fleshly means you understand now then it cuts out all fleshly means you understand how very little you have to do with it but what little faith you have he said just give it into the hands but given into Christ's hands and it will be like the grain of a mustard seed they will produce as much as it will allow you to say to a sycamore tree be thou picked up and bigger planted in the sea let God prove his own Word in your life don't try to produce it yourself just like God do it either he's living or it's not put him to the test he's willing and able to prove himself in your life give him half a chance don't tell me it's not possible in James and in Romans we see Paul explaining faith and then we see James explaining faith in James he says you see how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only in Romans 4:3 for what man say it scripture abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness he had faith and it was counted to him and james said it was by his works that he was kind of done to righteousness so you see no they can't contradict each other but what james was looking at was the fleshly the fleshly side of it the works that abraham had produced which faith it works is faith expressed so james was looking simply by what a pretend was producing to see what was on the inside that's why solomon said let a man examine him own self to see what food is he is producing because your character is shown when you're alone the things that you are thinking when you're alone that's what your character really is it's not what you're showing me because you can fool me hey everyone lincoln said you could fool everybody some of the time you can fool some people some of the time you can't fool everybody all the time and you'll never be able to for yourself and definitely not go and james was saying the works is what proof that works on the outside the manifestation what he was producing showed what was on the inside what faith he had but paul was saying now but God looks at the heart of the main and Paul was saying it was his faith that God looked at and that's what God that's what God gave him so man looks on the outside what God looks on the inside so how do you know how God sees you well actually you're gonna filter know how to look at yourself through God because it was the three-fold purpose that in Christ you should have all the preeminence --is and that she should bring our glorious church back to him then self cautions 1 in Ephesians 5:25 and then by that bring us back right to where he was in the Garden of Eden so we see the threefold purpose of God so let that be your filter if anything because he who said he who gave the promise that we would be brought back to that is the one who has the ability to place in your the measure of faith by which you give it back into his hands and he does the work to bring you back to where you need to be so you simply give your what little portion of faith you have into his hand and he will bring it back because he looks at the heart of a man a man looks on the outside so James was looking at the works and it is true because faith without the works is dead you're producing foolish things and you're doing these same things then something isn't right there's something not matching up but if you're if you're and you'll never be free from mistakes because your flesh is not born again but if you're producing the thing and growing in the Word of God and God is giving you and bringing you closer to him and bringing you step-by-step closer to him then you can see the manifestation of Christ simply because he has the preeminence in this in your life and you do what that by giving the wrong kind of fear out and reverence in God in the correct fear and faith takes a hold and faith is the victory that's how simple it is it just fits together so perfectly there's no contradiction in sin Scripture the measure of faith that you have you give it back into his hands now brother Branham says he says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith because we are to walk in the light as he is in the light so you walk in the word you walk in the in the message that we have which points us back to Christ the message is Jesus Christ the message is not a book of rules or a formality that we believe on the basis of fundamentalism it's not a thing that we do just on the basis of fundamentalism although fundamentalism is important to God and the message merely through the Prophet in our last day walking in the light simply pointed us back to Christ so when we go back to Christ oh then we all of a sudden have the Mechanics for the seed torque but what the domination which church has done is that they've approached the Word of God in a fleshly way and said I don't add that the truth then they produce the Trinity doctrine out of simply flesh it's just a bunch of guys at the Nicean council getting together and debating what the Word of God was and they didn't even have up I want to do it with and you think they're gonna produce something godly and look at the seed of it you have the denominational churches acting exactly like the world there's no difference in the world is completely unholy because it's controlled by Satan so you can see the root of it that's the manifestation of it that is the the work of their faith it was placed on a human means but what brother branham did is he didn't provide a rulebook and he didn't say quit smoking Lola he said come to Christ and he did preach you know pretty hard but he said come to Christ and when he pointed the bride back to Christ then the mechanics are all of a sudden mixed up with the dynamics and now all of a sudden we can produce the very nature of Christ the seed which was to be reproduced in the last stage just as it was in Christ when he was on earth do you see he pointed us back to the right place where we present our our little measure of faith in the Christ hang and then it produces in us what we need to be four doable what we need to have to get us back to where God wants us to be he says when you live and walk by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into a bride material see they're getting into rapturing condition now he says when a man lives by faith and walks by faith substance faith isolated from the world and becomes a new creature in Christ you're getting into bride material said you're getting into rapturing condition which is what we need to be in because we're right here at the rapture right here at the time when we're gonna be brought back all the sudden to the place which has to be he says that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with God alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God see it's God in the individual it's not you been baptized into the church it's not you baptizing into dear old lunch it's not you baptized into very coffee or you baptized into in the Steven coffee it's you baptized into Christ and see digital walk human-caused yeah not that ties into the message the message pointed you back to Christ so that it would be an individual walk so that would wake up so it and there's nobody in there but you and God he gives you orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere which fear is down he said there's not a shadow of fear anyway you walk right on and if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it there's nobody in the world that can tell me that God cannot heal because he has proved it and I see the works of it in my life he has proven to me his own word you can't tell me that he won't heal you I can pray for you with confidence that he will heal you because I know that he will because he did it for me and he's the same God the yesterday today and forever and he does not change as his word says so nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect faith brother Branham explained it is the faith that you have to raise your arm like this he says you want to raise your arm you raise your arm it just happens you just believe it it's just as normal as getting up out of bed in the morning that's what perfect faith is nothing big it's nothing elaborate there's no complication to it there's no complexity to it by what you cannot understand it it just simply happens because it's a sixth sense now you're getting into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that thing never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith exactly he was a mystic to us when he said you can actually pick up a tree and have it planted in the water simply if you have just this it's enough faith as a grain of a mustard seed when it's matured it will actually trees will obey you when you say get up and be ruling people you'll see there's a mystic to us just as much as it is to them but the world will never understand it and so it is now with those who have perfect faith a mystic to others and faith is a sixth sense brother Branham said old brother if that sixth sense could understand what we've been preaching about this week you see do you understand now he said I just wish that your faith that that sixth sense that I know God has given you and he knew that they didn't catch it he knew that they didn't understand it completely he said I just wish that you who are hearing my words would understand he said I wish that faith could be latched on he said I wish that sixth sense could understand what we've been preaching about this week he said then it would point you back to where you need to be he knew what was supposed to happen but it had delay in the presence of the Sun and it only knew that four years later but he was saying now I just wish you could understand it and that Holy Ghost God made this promise God made the promise that we're gonna be back there we're gonna be back there we took it through the scriptures this week back and forth and back and forth and combed it over until we know that God promised to do this thing he's going to do now in this day the supernatural now real genuine faith would see that that can catch a hold of it and all Devils out of hell would never shake him away from it just catch it with simple faith and there's not a devil in hell it could shake your phone it but we stumble at it it's not it's not used enough we depend too much on the five senses and when most of most of the time 95% of the people are better as soon as they see the the senses the five senses is finished well it's gone I did my get my grave get my casket ready as soon as the five senses it can't believe it anymore they just to give up that's when faith needs to kick in whatever little portion you have whatever you've got if you've got faith enough to come to church give it to him stay on the basis of his word and he'll bring out of you what he wants to bring out of it hey man he says just lay it just lay it in there the interesting thing about preaching is that you'll probably only most likely retain maybe 1% of what I have said this weekend so I labor and I pour it out for out you know an hour and brother Dale can preach for you know a certain amount of time and you only retain probably 1% of it maybe even less than 1% of it but what will happen is that when you go through something of the next week or the next month or the next 10 years God will bring that out of your memory because it's it's it's physical it's inside of you it's nothing needs to recall a God will bring that out of you what I've said because I felt that led to say what I've been saying God will bring exactly what I've said to that moment that to what you are going through and you'll recall it and that'll be just enough daily bread to get you through but you can forget a 99.5% of what I've said this morning I probably won't even remember a week from them but they'll be that one thing that you'll need that God will give you all you need to do is give the you give what little bit you have into his hands yeah you're going through something and then you'll come to a scripture just base that scripture in his presence just give it to his presence and come to him and say Lord I believe the description you're going through a trial you just say Lord I believe that Scripture there's been trials at my life where I've simply taken the same song and read it out lie a little out on my bed every single night for months the same scripture not another one there nothing I didn't I didn't feel like I grew a lick but just the same scripture just lay it before the presence of God and eventually you'll come through that child and you'll have learned something that no nothing you could buy off of a bookshelf could ever teach you it's the grace of Almighty God go through a short season through many fun many-fold temptations and trials that the trying of your faith bringeth forth something that is like just like gold at the time of your faith just just for a season just life life is just a season and it brings forth this thing you just have to give what little tiny bit of faith you've got into the hands of God he produces that Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it perform it until the day of Jesus Christ that he that has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ until that moment were brought back and more right there so how much what kind of people should we be we shouldn't be they know we're never gonna be these perfect people who do get everything and our errorless people we simply know where our strength lies and we know how the mechanics of our faith can work if we displace it in life right so because of the messenger of this age we're pointed back to Christ and now we have the mechanics and the dynamics for our faith to grow and ripen into a perfect faith that will allow us to rapture out of here bring us back to where God wanted us there's no other age that could have that because there's no other age we had the fullness of the word then we have to recognize who she was but because we recognize who we are through the the book of redemption that that book of redemption was us and it was the lamb whose slate was slain for us before the foundation of the world and by that we are baptized into Jesus Christ and born again into him anew which is what the message in a mister Christ the mister the mister God Christ is the mystery of God revealed as simple as there is to it Christ is the mystery of God revealed so God is all complexin and we do just lose the the the simplicity that God wraps himself in because we're so focused on things in the seat drop fear right in you'll be a million miles off from where you need to be but it's not until God can get the wrong kind of fear out that he can get you into a place where you reverence him and respect him enough and present yourself to him in a way that faith can come in and buy that sixth sense you place what you've got even if it's just enough to believe that he is in a reward of those who diligently seek Him even if it's just that yeah and you believe that alone you place that faith on the run the basis of the Word of God and it's the Holy Spirit that anoints the seed and brings forth the light it's as simple as that wonderful let's stand our feet or the deal if you'd like to come with a song leader for the Bob maybe you'd like to lead us in some sing songs and that we could just take what we've learned and just laid in the presence of the Sun nothing nothing more needs to be done nothing more needs to be done than that it's not flesh it's it's Christ who does the work it's Christ you put that in you and it's Christ that will bring it out of you as he wants to bring it out of you in the way that he will do it and whatever way it may be oh yeah that's pretty gracious Heavenly Father I thank you so much Lord for the opportunity to be here and to speak about your word I'm so thankful Lord that you've given me a place that I can base and found date and place my faith on and build a foundation upon and that's the Word of God when Paul he went to the he went to the people that he went to and he said I can't come to you in enticing words of man's wisdom because it just it simply doesn't do anything I said I come to you in power and demonstration of Almighty God and wasn't dancing and shouting and anything like that maybe so it was just the fact that he came to you in Christ's name and he placed his faith on you and it was you who spoke to him and demonstrated and heal and did mighty signs and wonders because those signs would follow them that believe and they believed because it was just enough faith but he gave into your hands and you brought them back to you would help us to do the same thing to get up tomorrow morning or Tuesday morning and go back to work and just present what we've got back to you and you bring out of us what you want us to bring if even if we do that same routine for the next 20 years let us just not give up let us fight the good fight of faith granite father that you give us our day the strength to keep going we love you Father and we thank you amen gracious name do we pray amen hey hey Matt praises the name of the Lord we thank God again for the word amen and again to say that I believe that the Lord sent our brother to minister on what he ministered and to preach concerning fear and faith by the grace of God and to finish it with the your measure of faith and you want to know what what it's all about what you can go back and meet made reference to it concerning Hebrews 11 and and by faith this one did this and by faith this one did that so it was a measure of faith and the measure of faith that that give that Abel had in the outside the garden in offering the sacrifice that he offered the measure of faith that Noah had the measure of let's talk about the measure of faith that Enoch had the Bible says that it's so pleased God that that he ended God took him off the earth and he just went on and on and on and on but but again let's remember again what our brothers have reminded us of it not to complicate it it is God hidden and revealed in simplicity amen it is God speaking the word and and the believer believing the word and acting on the word and letting God manifest that in your life by grace a man by the grace of God through faith no wonder it says you know again it says it is by grace people say by grace were saved by grace were saved no white we are saved by grace through faith a man and by the grace of God for the fate of God God's revealing this to you entered into that generation to another generation to another generation but you know the measure of faith is it changes from one generation to another God requires more of this generation any required of another generation amen because this is the endtime generation and the prophet of God in this honor preached that message then again our brother Stephen referred to it on perfect faith and he said why am i ministering this message he said to rub out he said unbelief he said to bring us to this perfect faith and he said because we have to come to this perfect faith he's at for the rapture and again what is that perfect faith that is simply believing what God said amen and I pray the grace of God that you'll get that revelation from what I brother ministered on Friday and Saturday and again again this morning and so I'm going to provide you with copies of the of the sermons in the DVDs outside by the grace of God so that you would take them and listen to them again it is I believe honestly speaking I believe there's any messages that we have heard that well I believe we need to hear these messages again amen go back and listen to what he said on Friday night go back and listen to what our brother Stephen ministered on Saturday night and again listen to whatever other ministered again this morning they may and remember God is in and revealing simplicity but again on down to the man has taken it and tried to make it complicated God speaks and God does what he says he's going to do God in simplicity a million we are and God said he was going to do this and he did it God said he was going to do that and he did it you know there's nothing complicated about it you take Noah's message and he said he was good that God was going to bring a flood and Noah acted on that faith that revelation him and day in and day out him and his family went out and they were working on this Ark a man there there's no question there was no doubt none whatsoever and it was our brothers father that that made reference to Noah in the ark and he said they went God called him into the ark and he said the Sun was shining there were no clouds and no death and no doubt he said they might have been in the archive for a couple of days and then they went up and and opened the window that was that that was the only thing that was in the ARCA that at the room and the open the window and anywhere and the Sun was still shining and know that the family might have said God or ever our dad is a really little Wayne yes he said it's going to rain are you sure he said I'm sure why because God said so man God said so and so they they took their stand on what God said I we standing out what God said concerning this day this hour and the resurrection and the rapture amen don't complicate it and try to make it what it is not God God said the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are the living are going to be changed and count away with him to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord that's what God's working on that the faith that he has given us in this hour that's a faith that he is asking us to believe in this day and in this age remember that when you see this when you see all these things happening out there in the world and the things of the world and politics and and the immorality and everything else in the world are there religiously he said this is going to happen that's going to happen they're going to be false for Christ or false prophets and he said now you see when you see that are we going to do what he told us to do if so when you see that he said look up and lift up your heads of understanding because your Redemption draw an eye whether when we stop and consider what our brothers ministered and the faith that God has revealed to us and given to us in this hour lift up your heads of understanding amen don't be blowing - what's a br there but at the same time by the grace of God don't be blind to what God is doing according to his word amen for those that believe for those that have faith they're gone rev up the make-belief and give us a real genuine faith and that we are living day in and day looking for and expecting the resurrection and expecting that in Christ to arise in it and appear to us a million can you explain that I won't really explain it there with any place I go to rise because there when I say arise that coming out of one dimension and into this dimension to appear to those Saints that are that are ready for the resurrection those things that believe in the resurrection and believe in the rapture amen the Lord descending with every little sound the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then I do in the grave so they are in Christ they may live in Christ so they've started pretty to that to the Saints letter that have faith to the face I really believe the face where they're not not fearing the flesh not really what's going on over there who believe in y'all they got the Blessed hope amen so the dead in Christ are gonna start appearing outside by the grace of God to you to me and Julio in instantly we're going to be changed in the glorified bodies like it's worth I body Alleluia that will be caught up into not those clouds hey man don't worry bro Stevens they won't be there amen so it will have nothing to do that that weather then let's make it smaller so it's going to be cultivating the clouds of glory it's going to color it the weather this kind of come from a way it wasn't a rocket ship there was angels they caught up in the clouds of angels all alone they made a place where they've of the Lord the Angels was going to be where we're going to be worshiping the bride and the bridegroom this would be the name of the Lord Alleluia so Larry believed that is that simple amen there's a flood who's coming that it came hey man no matter how he's in the ark for seven days and nothing happened absolutely nothing happened and I was surrounded by make believers and unbelievers and and they were maybe making fun of them because it was a boat on dry land amen he didn't do it down by the ocean if you little dry land hayleybay and far away from the ocean far away from all the literature and everything else amen God separates us unto himself and so there they were baby laughing and making fun and maybe better have been all of a sudden after that seventh day maybe they tried to make it up the hill gangplank wherever they were in the cloud began to come and the moisture be in there began to fall oh well maybe maybe he was right no no not maybe it's just saith the Lord amen and they will try to make it up the old gangplanks all right but the door was shut Charlie but the door was locked amen they couldn't get in amen brother help us God Elvis to believe that God in simplicity that he did it eventually the flood came and washed them all the way and so God give us the faith of Enoch god help us god bless it what is the measure of your faith more faith in the world then he got more faith that in politics and in God more faith in the politicians more faith in religion most have faith in all these things but they don't have faith in God amen but there is a few there is a few and is getting fewer and fewer I trust by grace you're one of the few and that you have that measure of faith it's going to take us from time to eternity it's all right we'll be back again when God's finished with the rest on this world we'll be back and you'll come back and set up his kingdom are you gonna sit with him and his throne and reign with him remember if you can't handle the word here and you can't take the responsibility of the word here and go out and live for Jesus here you won't be able to do it there yes our brother did don't forget what he said what's God doing now God's doing now to us what he's been doing to is elected seed all down through the ages don't sue me for new he's doing is doing to us what he did to them and that's molding our character god bless you brother that's the truth why because only character can sit in the throne wonderful hallelujah with Lu Thursday Westley's day the Pentecostal age where was the old fashioned salvation asst are the revivals that God had down through the ages is molding their character so that they could they they they can reign with him or they they can they can go out and do what he wants them to do outside the city amen there's going to be there's gonna be many outside the city and there's going to be a bright under bright group the city but he's molding your character people think you got a good character for this and good character for that do you have the Christian character not religious character Christian character god help us that will enter in and believe that measure of faith that God has given us in this hour that's good and faith you know faith does hope faith does this day fate does that yes it does but in order for it to accomplish the will of God in your life faith has got to give God preeminence go back and we'll go back and listen listen again to what our brother ministered on Friday and Saturday there is the fear of man the fear of the devil but then there's the fear of God absolutely you know don't forget what he said what is the fear of God respecting and reverence in God a man that he is forgot first place in your life brother so that why so that you walk with God as he knocked it I remember Enoch was the seventh from the first Adam we're the seventh from the second half Christ hallelujah he walked with God and he was not because God took him and look and he saw the Lord coming with ten thousands of his Saints he saw this he saw that and now there's there's another generation a little bright remember is getting the pavement is not getting bigger pyramid is getting smaller amen so it's getting fewer and fewer and the closer you get to the end jesus said when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth will he find the faith that our brother ministry on the tenth this morning the faith that absolutely trust the Lord all things are possible oh so there's going to be a few that it's going to have that thing there's going to take us from time to eternity like it took Enoch from time to eternity just think of Maisie I trust he not reprehended you and me by the grace of God pew there Strait is the gate narrow is the way and few there be that find it few that God saw is just like that Dinah costal pastor one time asked me to explain predestination I was sent him in Pentecostal church and a preacher preached on predestination and they didn't believe it just absolutely didn't believe it and then fellowshiping with somebody one day certain brother that loved the Word of God and came his son-in-law it was the Pentecostal preacher and he said excuse me brother he said could you explain predestination you're saying God predestinated this be decimated that he said where this choice come into it I said there is a choice but I said by foreknowledge is in Peter there according to his foreknowledge what God foresaw he predestinated unto eternal life God seen what was in you as our brother Stephen brought it this morning yeah knew what was in you he knew what your response is going to be and you are predestinated on to this word and this message and this revival and that revival and you would respond according to the word wonderful god help us to believe how expecting our brother I said last night asked her brother you should I thought you were gonna go on for at least another 30 minutes and I've got enough notes I could go on for another three hours from what our brother said why because the revelation God by the Holy Ghost expands the revelation in your heart I trusted the Lord by the Holy Ghost will expand the revelation in your heart but you've got a hunger and thirst for it amen and what you hunger and thirst for God was satisfied by the Holy Ghost in you amen let's go on with God by the grace of God amen and won't keep you any longer god bless you this worship the Lord we're gonna sing faith of our fathers living still one Luther had one Wesley had one what all the others and what Enoch head but no ahead well you heard what Abel had there is the seat of God with that faith they believe God help us Lord while measure of faith do you have today justice to go to church that's good thank you Jesus is that as far as your faith takes you church or does your faith just take you to go out and say well I'm really just now I believe in God and yes or no it's got to go further than that let's just believe what God has said let's believe what God is doing and let's believe what God is going to do so what measure of faith do you have seriously consider but I brother Stephen is Minister doc hey man and god bless your brother for following the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming to minister on these st. because I believe we we needed to be taught it we needed it needed to be expounded to us concerning fear and faith grace to us you got a fear of your Gulf rivers God respect God not the devil not not the world the things of the world the people of the world and there's people afraid they're going to offend this one will fend out dolphin go and don't be offended by God blessed is he that is not offended in me Jesus amen let's sing it faith of our fathers living still Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] amen pay that father to teach you we will be true to thee not to death well looking for that we're looking for the change by the grace of God amen the Lord bless you I had a song there yes number in this book is number 45 but it's I've got a mansion just over the hilltop I'm satisfied with just the cottage below are we that's a good question where's your faith and it says a little silver and the little gold not going out and giving your life to get more and more and more don't leave anything it's the truth let me repeat it again say when I go to a bank and I say can I have some of that worthless paper they just laugh and wonder what I'm saying or what I mean I said because it's worthless I said I you know maybe with the government they want to tell you that it's worth through this and it's worth that it's worth something else but I said as will si sir tomorrow I said a little bit just be paper not worth anything they'll cash their silver and they're clearly into the streets although the way I'm not going to give that bad it's going to get worse than that God have mercy others that we believe God and we're going to trust God in all these things that our faith is not in these scene looking for more of these things but as the generation of idiot [Music] they're satisfied with a cottage they want a mansion major status a with the cottage either gotta give you a mansion their place the name of the Lord if you're satisfied with our service later you'll be as cool there by the grace of God amen there's not a father to that for the influence of the devil oh yeah you know yeah you'll be good in the eyes of man even if you got to listen it'll be good in the eyes and then I look good if you dress this way you dress that way how do we look in the eyes of God amen God Elvis [Music] to have the faith again that our brother mentioned that pleases God it's a faith that diligently not seeks the things of the world but six of things of God can I sing it tonight today rather this way this afternoon and not tell a lie don't sing a lie [Music] I'm satisfied with just a cot even though I'm singing the truth as to one brother say these are the biggest lies total are told in church that's the truth I love him do you love him I say to savor the cottage are you satisfied with a cottage I produce and I run there let's make sure that we're

have a mansion it says here I want one I have he promises I am a mentioned a harp and a crown by the grace of God [Music] and I before we sing let me sleep on one verse of scripture with you again concerning with our brother ministered in these lastly services did you understand his speech did you understand the Ministry of the word and I understand the word that was great for you'd have to hear the logos thereof [Music] jesus said to the Pharisees why do you not understand my speech why do you not understand my speech why do you not understand what I'm saying he said because he cannot hear my word what is the difference between his speech and his word to speak with the literal voice that they heard his word is the logos revelation of what he was saying you can hear what I'm saying we could hear what our brother Steven preached these last three services they're literally those by the letter of the word but do we get the spiritual revelation of it hey man the word have fall on to fall and and you hear the word and one goes out next this way and then another one goes out because they got the logos they go out and live a different life one becomes religious the other one become spiritual hallelujah why because they heard the speech they understood the speech because they to understand it lift up your heads I'm understanding your Redemption draweth nigh they understood the speech because they heard the word their logos behind what it was because what was being said the revelation of the faith the ie what was being said grace that you're not go out with just knowledge in your head but your globe with the revelation of what our brother ministered in your heart and now that it will affect you it'll control you it'll guarantee because it is Christ in control let's say I'm satisfied with just a cottage below and a little silver and little gold and like I said let's make sure we're singing the truth we'll ask our brother Paul break to come and dismiss an Albert what a prayer [Music] [Music] [Applause] three [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] crazy mother for that Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful Lord for this day hey Lord you kept
