[30:23] them again you're like oh i miss these
[30:24] people
[30:25] i need to come back um so at the
[30:28] beginning of this year
[30:29] i well i thought that i would be back in
[30:31] st john's um
[30:33] in the new year but you know i pray to
[30:35] god and
[30:36] uh try to do god's perfect well and um
[30:40] he just led me to be back at home with
[30:42] my parents
[30:43] and uh with mom the under mom
[30:46] i've been getting some good woman
[30:48] training under my mom
[30:50] god bless my mom she's great so that's
[30:53] where i am now but
[30:54] um i do wish to come back because of
[30:57] course with church and everything
[30:58] so i just pray for me that god just
[31:00] continues leading me
[31:02] um i just want to give a little bit of a
[31:04] testimony before singing
[31:06] um so at the beginning of this year it
[31:08] was my new year's resolution
[31:10] and not only new year's resolution but
[31:13] my desire as well
[31:14] and my prayer to get closer to god and
[31:18] to also get to dive deeper into
[31:20] scripture and
[31:21] into the bible and i really want to
[31:23] thank god for
[31:25] answering my prayers i've been really
[31:27] having great moments with god
[31:30] all throughout these months just getting
[31:32] deeper with him deeper in scripture
[31:35] and um him just revealing certain things
[31:38] to me and opening my eyes
[31:39] to more depth of the word and also just
[31:43] leading me to certain books that i've
[31:44] picked up christian books that have
[31:46] really opened my eyes
[31:47] uh just getting deeper in christ and so
[31:49] i really want to
[31:50] thank god for that and just starting a
[31:52] revival within me
[31:54] um like usually when we think of revival
[31:57] we think of like big groups and
[31:59] big like big people and we might be
[32:02] people big churches and big groups big
[32:04] numbers in church
[32:05] but um i never really thought that you
[32:07] could have like a revival by yourself
[32:09] with god
[32:10] in your room so that was that's been a
[32:13] really great experience
[32:14] just between me and god and just want to
[32:17] thank god for restoring the joy of my
[32:19] salvation
[32:21] so the the song that i'm singing is just
[32:23] very directly
[32:24] goes with my testimony

[42:35] is registered in newfoundland
[42:39] as a clergy with the bible believers
[42:42] association here in saint john's and in
[42:44] newfoundland basically
[42:45] so he'll be wherever he would go he
[42:47] would be a clergy representing the
[42:49] church here
[42:50] amen so we be in prayer for our brother
[42:52] johnson as he comes to
[42:53] minister the word amen please in the
[42:56] name of jesus
[42:58] pull on the word amen express your
[43:01] hunger
[43:02] and express your thirst for the word of

[43:06] because again oh my the lord was right
[43:08] straight is the gate now is the way
[43:11] and few there be that bind it
[43:14] amen so we pray the grace of god that
[43:16] we're numbered with the few
[43:18] amen to find the way and you know
[43:20] brother
[43:21] again god is going to do that reveal
[43:24] that
[43:24] through the ministry again there are
[43:26] those that feel as i said
[43:29] when i was at the prayer meeting one
[43:31] time and i was at an altar in a certain
[43:33] church
[43:34] and this person came up and they were
[43:35] kneeling down praying lord thank you
[43:37] thank you you delivered us from from uh
[43:40] denominations and so on and church this
[43:43] church that
[43:44] now she said lord we don't have to be
[43:46] under we don't have to come under any
[43:47] man
[43:48] and no man's gonna have any authority i
[43:50] said lord i said she needs you
[43:53] so i said pray lord that you're going
[43:54] you're going to bring conviction
[43:56] in their hearts amen but it's like the
[43:58] brother said to brother brown brother
[44:00] brown
[44:00] oh the holy ghost is teaching me so i
[44:02] don't need any any any minister
[44:04] brother brown said brother he said
[44:06] that's not right he said the holy ghost
[44:08] teaching you
[44:09] he's going to you he's going to use a

[50:28] good to see you here amen god bless you
[50:31] amen joshua chapter one very familiar
[50:35] scripture since we've read it multiple
[50:36] times already
[50:37] that's where we're going to go from this
[50:38] morning amen joshua chapter 1 says then
[50:41] joshua commanded the officers of the
[50:42] people saying
[50:44] pass through the host and command the
[50:45] people saying prepare you victims
[50:48] for within three days you shall pass
[50:50] over this jordan to go in to possess the
[50:52] land
[50:53] which the lord your god giveth you to
[50:55] possess it amen you can have your seats
[50:57] this morning
[50:58] god bless you each one amen we're going
[51:00] to continue on our series with the
[51:01] overcomers
[51:02] and then this morning we want to speak
[51:04] on a title of super natural
[51:06] access amen supernatural access we've
[51:08] covered leadership
[51:09] we've covered election we've covered the
[51:11] the choosing of god but today we're
[51:13] going to talk about
[51:14] what it takes to go into the land and
[51:15] this is going to be at least the two
[51:17] service
[51:18] part maybe three there's a lot here and
[51:20] then when we talk about going over
[51:22] jordan and the process of of all of this
[51:24] there's a lot to it and i don't just
[51:25] want to skip over it because we've heard
[51:27] these things before
[51:28] i was talking to a good friend of mine
[51:29] the other day and he said don't ever
[51:31] presume
[51:32] that that people know what you're
[51:33] talking about don't ever presume that
[51:35] they remember
[51:36] what they've been taught amen we've had
[51:37] a pastor here for 40 years
[51:39] and i guarantee you there's things that
[51:40] he said that we've forgotten amen so
[51:42] i'm not going to i'm not going to skip
[51:44] through it real quickly because we know
[51:45] what this is or that is
[51:46] we're going to men just take our time
[51:48] and let the lord bless his word as it
[51:50] comes through to us amen
[51:51] amen so we're talking about going in
[51:53] amen we're going to be talking about
[51:54] crossing over jordan this morning
[51:56] and a lot of times people can see the
[51:58] fullness and the blessings of god in the
[51:59] scripture
[52:00] and they stand there and they're looking
[52:02] at them they can see them and they can
[52:03] say i want this and i want that
[52:05] but how many of them are willing to go
[52:06] the jordan way amen there's only one way
[52:08] to come into the kingdom of heaven
[52:10] there's only one way to cross over into
[52:11] the fullness of the promises of god
[52:13] amen and that's got to be through jordan
[52:15] amen brother brown talked about the
[52:17] third pull
[52:18] amen he talked about spoken word we see
[52:20] the gifts of the spirit the true gifts
[52:22] in the spirit we see the fruits of the
[52:24] spirit
[52:24] and we see so many denominations in so
[52:26] many churches these days even within the
[52:28] message if you look closely
[52:29] where they have created another way to
[52:31] get in there amen they have said if you
[52:32] believe a prophet came then you're in
[52:34] there if you believe the message
[52:35] you're here if you do this then you're
[52:37] saved if you do that then you're saved
[52:39] and there's only one way you can be
[52:40] saved the scripture says and that's acts
[52:41] 2 38
[52:42] and that's jordan amen that's jordan for
[52:44] us it's not a coming out
[52:46] lots of people came out there's lots of
[52:47] people have wandered in the desert that
[52:49] have been provided for by christ through
[52:51] many many years where others have fallen
[52:52] away and died and they've stayed
[52:54] but now there's a coming in amen god
[52:56] doesn't just take you out he's got to
[52:57] bring you into something
[52:59] and that's where we want to go this
[53:00] morning amen amen so we're going to
[53:02] cover joshua 10 again one verse 10 again
[53:04] here it says then joshua
[53:05] commanded the officers of his people
[53:08] saying
[53:09] now now let's say man there's a warning
[53:10] given there is no surprise when it comes
[53:13] to crossing over jordan
[53:14] he doesn't just wake up one morning and
[53:16] say okay folks we're going across jordan
[53:18] what does he have he says the lord has
[53:19] given him a time and a season to do it
[53:22] and he prepares the people for it amen
[53:24] and then he sends messengers out to do
[53:25] it and says
[53:26] pass through the host and command the
[53:28] people saying
[53:30] prepare you victuals he's saying prepare
[53:32] food
[53:33] now they've been taken care of
[53:35] supernaturally for 40 years in the
[53:36] desert and all of a sudden he says
[53:38] prepare food something's going to change
[53:42] amen where they were going supernatural
[53:44] manna wasn't going to be available
[53:46] there was going to be some other way of
[53:47] feeding after that amen and they were
[53:49] going to have a portion of that
[53:50] for within three days you shall pass
[53:52] over this jordan
[53:54] so where are you going to pass over
[53:55] jordan and when three days
[53:57] time and a place to go in to possess the
[54:00] land
[54:00] that's why you're crossing over you're
[54:02] not going over to sightsee you're not
[54:03] going over there to grab some food and
[54:05] then we're going to come back but you're
[54:06] going in to possess the land
[54:07] once you're there you're going to stay
[54:09] there forever amen there is no coming
[54:10] back after this
[54:11] once you cross over jordan you're going
[54:13] to hold on to what you take there
[54:15] and you've got to take it in order to
[54:16] stay there he says what to go in to
[54:18] possess the land
[54:19] which the lord your god giveth you to
[54:21] possess it so this is not their idea
[54:23] this is not their plan amen this is
[54:25] something that god has called them to do
[54:27] and they are in obedience to do it
[54:29] this is not a whim this is not some man
[54:31] deciding that this place looks really
[54:32] good and let's take it
[54:33] but he says no this is the lord your god
[54:35] has given it to you to possess it this
[54:37] is god's plan this is god's purpose this
[54:39] is god's will
[54:40] and only on that basis are we to move
[54:42] forward amen we don't want to step out
[54:44] of his will amen
[54:45] jump forward to joshua chapter three we
[54:47] covered joshua chapter two which was
[54:49] about rahab
[54:50] in the last service so we're going to
[54:51] skip over that and jump all the way up
[54:53] to joshua
[54:54] chapter 3 in verse 1. now this is when
[54:58] they start to cross over jordan it says
[54:59] in joshua rose early in the morning and
[55:01] they removed from shatim and came to
[55:03] jordan
[55:03] he and all the children of israel and
[55:05] lodged there before they passed over
[55:07] and it came to pass after three days
[55:09] that the officers went through the host
[55:11] and they commanded the people saying
[55:13] when ye see the ark of the covenant of
[55:15] the lord your god
[55:16] and the priest the levites bearing it
[55:18] then ye shall remove from your place and
[55:19] go after it
[55:20] notice he says then you shall go when
[55:22] you see the word going forward then you
[55:24] go
[55:24] don't go before it you've got to wait
[55:26] amen when the word moves we move with it
[55:29] but we never lead the word the word
[55:30] leads us the word has to go ahead of us
[55:33] and that way you're confident of the way
[55:34] that you're going amen
[55:36] as believers we tend to be really good
[55:37] at what sticking with what
[55:39] god has said what god has done with
[55:42] holding to that but when it comes to
[55:44] turning the corner that's when we
[55:45] usually fail
[55:46] when the word moves on that's when we
[55:48] get stuck so often because we're so
[55:50] safe with what has been proven that we
[55:52] don't want to move forward as the holy
[55:54] spirit moves as the word moves ahead
[55:55] and takes us into deeper revelation
[55:57] takes us into a closer walk with god in
[55:59] these different things
[56:00] we don't like to do that because it's so
[56:02] safe to stay with what you know is
[56:03] proven
[56:04] but god doesn't stand still amen he
[56:06] doesn't stand still he's turning a
[56:07] corner and in this age what do we have
[56:09] we have god sent a prophet and everybody
[56:11] camped at god set a prophet
[56:13] and they stayed there and they believed
[56:14] it and they accepted every word that
[56:16] prophet said
[56:17] but then the prophet went off the scene
[56:18] and what happened the word moved on
[56:20] amen the prophet's word didn't change
[56:22] the prophet's word didn't lose his truth
[56:24] the holy spirit did not anoint his pro
[56:26] his message anymore
[56:28] but the word moved on and what did the
[56:29] word say now i'm dealing with the
[56:31] multi-member bride
[56:32] amen now i'm perfecting a bride you saw
[56:34] a son of man ministry you saw a wave
[56:36] sheath before you
[56:37] but now i've got to do that same work in
[56:39] you and if you stay here and say
[56:40] i believe god sent a prophet and you
[56:42] don't move beyond that what happens
[56:44] you're never going to cross over jordan
[56:46] you're never going to cross into your
[56:47] possession
[56:48] or your inheritance because you're
[56:49] sitting there looking at something that
[56:50] god has done
[56:51] and the words moving and you're not
[56:52] moving with it amen
[56:55] we have to have the holy spirit leading
[56:57] and guiding us individually
[56:59] day by day that's what crossing over
[57:01] jordan's going to do is it's going to
[57:02] bring us to individual leadership and
[57:04] possession
[57:04] of what god has called for each and
[57:06] every one of us amen we haven't
[57:08] forgotten god has sent a prophet i'm
[57:09] going to read a bazillion of his quotes
[57:11] in the coming weeks and months amen
[57:13] his pride this prophet's message is not
[57:15] dead amen what is it it's restored us to
[57:17] the truth of the word it's restored us
[57:18] to our position
[57:19] and the calling of god and the purpose
[57:21] of god in this age but we can't stay
[57:23] with god sent a prophet we've got to say
[57:24] what did he send him for
[57:26] and what is he doing today what has our
[57:28] pastor been hammering for the last
[57:29] months
[57:30] months and months what is god doing
[57:32] today not what did he do yesterday
[57:34] what is he doing today what is he going
[57:36] to do tomorrow and are you ready for it
[57:38] by listening to heating what he's saying
[57:40] today if you don't catch what he does
[57:41] today you're going to miss what he does
[57:42] tomorrow amen
[57:44] you've got to be ready to move amen
[57:46] verse 4 says yet there shall be a space
[57:48] between you and it
[57:50] between you and what the word like i
[57:52] said the word has to lead you can't go
[57:54] first it has to go first
[57:56] about two thousand cubits by measure
[57:58] neither come not near unto it
[58:00] that ye may know the way by which you
[58:01] must go for ye have not passed this way
[58:03] here
[58:04] two four has anybody gone on a rapture
[58:06] before
[58:07] i haven't i haven't gone in a rapture
[58:11] so what the word's got to lead us there
[58:12] because what we have the word which is
[58:14] christ
[58:15] he went in a rapturing and he went and
[58:17] he was translated into a new body he was
[58:19] glorified in front of them amen
[58:21] he's gone the way so the word has to
[58:23] lead us it's not just word scripture
[58:25] amen it's not just letters on a page
[58:27] it's word life
[58:29] it is the holy spirit it is christ the
[58:31] word that we're looking to
[58:32] amen that's where the denominations
[58:33] misses they can see this word but they
[58:35] can't see christ
[58:36] and then they can't see the life of the
[58:38] word moving amongst us in this day and
[58:40] age to bring us to
[58:41] a perfection which is the maturity of a
[58:43] bride amen amen
[58:46] what he says here sanctify yourself
[58:50] right you don't know the way but in
[58:52] order to go this way you've got to clean
[58:54] yourself up
[58:55] and that's a work that you do the holy
[58:57] spirit is there to help us with that
[58:59] right it'll quicken our hearts it'll
[59:01] convict us of what we're doing but
[59:02] you've got to do that work
[59:04] you've got to separate yourself amen
[59:06] that's what sanctification is
[59:07] it's a separating it's a cleaning out
[59:10] it's separating yourself from the world
[59:12] and the things of the world
[59:13] he says joshua said unto the people
[59:15] sanctify yourselves
[59:16] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[59:18] among you today if you'll sanctify
[59:20] tomorrow he'll do wonders
[59:21] amen that's the promise you do what i
[59:23] said and then tomorrow i'll do what i
[59:24] said
[59:25] amen brother brown makes a point in the
[59:28] adoption series about this he says did
[59:30] you notice
[59:31] joshua before they crossed jordan joshua
[59:33] said go through the midst of the camp
[59:35] and clean your clothes and sanctify
[59:37] every one of you and let no man come at
[59:38] his wife
[59:39] for within three days you'll see the
[59:41] glory of god see
[59:42] it is a process of getting ready to
[59:45] inherit the promise
[59:47] now the promise to israel was god gave
[59:49] abraham the promise of the land of
[59:51] palestine
[59:52] and it was to be their possession
[59:53] forever and they was to always remain in
[59:56] this land
[59:57] there was no going back after this and
[59:58] anyone that left that land wasn't
[1:00:00] blessed
[1:00:01] they would be blessed in the ways that
[1:00:02] maybe the world would call blessed but
[1:00:03] they weren't blessed with the way that
[1:00:04] god calls them to be blessed amen
[1:00:07] amen the process didn't start on the
[1:00:09] banks of jordan amen this is not just a
[1:00:11] today sanctification then tomorrow you
[1:00:13] go in
[1:00:14] what happened he called them out of
[1:00:15] egypt under the blood right and then he
[1:00:17] brought him in the desert and he worked
[1:00:18] him in the desert until he cleaned a
[1:00:20] bunch of them up and got rid of the dead
[1:00:22] well literally you know we call it the
[1:00:24] the the um
[1:00:25] oh the dead falls and stuff in branches
[1:00:28] and stuff things that fall off and dead
[1:00:29] they got rid of all the extra stuff
[1:00:31] the heavy weight the dead weight that's
[1:00:32] what i was looking for literally the
[1:00:33] dead weight walking dead that's what
[1:00:35] they were
[1:00:36] and then what now he's got to bring them
[1:00:38] into something takes them out cleans
[1:00:39] them up then he says there's a last
[1:00:40] minute sanctification that's going to
[1:00:42] happen here
[1:00:43] and then you get to go into this land
[1:00:45] and i'm going to read a really long
[1:00:46] quote here i've trimmed it down
[1:00:48] but it's just to set the highlights and
[1:00:50] kind of set what happened before this
[1:00:52] as brother braham spoke that he says
[1:00:54] there were three stages of the journey
[1:00:55] and there's been three stages of this
[1:00:57] journey for we are justified by faith
[1:00:59] believing on the lord jesus christ
[1:01:01] forsaking the land of egypt come out and
[1:01:03] then are sanctified through the offering
[1:01:05] of his blood
[1:01:06] washed from our sins and become pilgrims
[1:01:07] and sojourners claiming that we are
[1:01:10] seeking a land a city that's coming
[1:01:12] or a promise so did israel in the
[1:01:14] wilderness sojourners no place to rest
[1:01:17] traveling night after night following
[1:01:18] the pillar of fire
[1:01:19] but finally come to the promised land
[1:01:21] where they settled down
[1:01:22] that's where the believer comes right he
[1:01:25] says you're coming to a place where
[1:01:26] you'll settle down
[1:01:28] he comes first to a recognition that
[1:01:30] he's a sinner then he is separated by
[1:01:32] the waters the washing of waters by the
[1:01:34] word believing on the lord jesus christ
[1:01:36] then being justified by faith he becomes
[1:01:38] a partaker and a peace with god
[1:01:40] through christ baptized into the name of
[1:01:43] jesus christ to omit him into this
[1:01:45] journey
[1:01:45] he says you get it into the journey so
[1:01:48] you're only starting a journey
[1:01:50] when you get baptized right that's not
[1:01:52] the end
[1:01:53] that's the start amen he says then he
[1:01:56] becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim he's
[1:01:58] on his journey to what
[1:01:59] a promise that god made israel had not
[1:02:02] yet received the promise but they were
[1:02:04] on their journey
[1:02:05] israel when they come to the spot of
[1:02:07] kiddish barnea where the spies went over
[1:02:08] and said the land is great
[1:02:10] but some of them come back and said we
[1:02:11] can't take it because the cities are
[1:02:13] walled up and so forth
[1:02:14] but joshua and caleb stood out and said
[1:02:17] we are more than able to take it
[1:02:19] because of their already signed up
[1:02:21] documented statements they believed in
[1:02:22] two works of grace
[1:02:24] justification and sanctification and
[1:02:26] could not move any further
[1:02:28] he says what not joshua and caleb had
[1:02:29] that he says the people it was
[1:02:31] documented that they disbelieved
[1:02:33] they only went part way they were
[1:02:35] justified they were sanctified but when
[1:02:36] it came to crossing over jordan
[1:02:38] they refused it it was documented he
[1:02:40] says and listen
[1:02:41] that whole generation perished in the
[1:02:44] wilderness
[1:02:45] that's a scary place to be he says you
[1:02:47] had documented statements that you
[1:02:49] didn't believe
[1:02:50] he says and because of that you'll never
[1:02:51] go in you'll die in the wilderness amen
[1:02:54] then instead of the people going on
[1:02:56] receiving the holy spirit speaking with
[1:02:58] tongues receiving the power of god
[1:02:59] the baptism of the holy ghost signs
[1:03:01] wonders miracles they felt it would
[1:03:03] break down their tradition of doctrines
[1:03:04] and what happened to it
[1:03:06] perished in the land that's right now he
[1:03:07] makes a switch here and he's talking
[1:03:08] about what
[1:03:09] what would happen in pentecost you know
[1:03:11] 2000 or many thousands of years later
[1:03:14] but he's typing it back to what they
[1:03:15] were doing he says but the believers
[1:03:17] the caleb and joshua outfit amen that's
[1:03:19] where we want to be called
[1:03:21] right that's the the identification we
[1:03:22] want is i want to be part of the joshua
[1:03:24] and caleb outfit
[1:03:25] amen the ones that believe that said
[1:03:26] we're more than able to take it
[1:03:28] the joshua caleb and josh ralph that was
[1:03:30] going on to the promise
[1:03:32] they moved on over into the land and
[1:03:34] took the land and settled down in the
[1:03:36] land as a possession
[1:03:38] and we never stop at justification
[1:03:40] sanctification
[1:03:41] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[1:03:43] spirit let's not stop
[1:03:45] at believing on the lord jesus and being
[1:03:47] baptized
[1:03:48] let's not stop because he cleaned us up
[1:03:50] from a life of sin how many people have
[1:03:52] stopped there
[1:03:53] and said i'm living clean that's what it
[1:03:55] means to be saved
[1:03:56] no that's what it means to be sanctified
[1:03:59] your life is cleaned up but that does
[1:04:00] not mean you have the life of christ
[1:04:02] amen the scripture says he gives you a
[1:04:04] new spirit and brother brahm says he
[1:04:05] gives you a new spirit
[1:04:06] so that you'll get along with his spirit
[1:04:08] when he gives it to you
[1:04:10] that sanctification is that new spirit
[1:04:11] that's roaming around inside of you
[1:04:13] but you've still got to get the holy
[1:04:15] spirit you've just got to clean up life
[1:04:17] that means you're ready for service but
[1:04:18] he's got to put something in you to make
[1:04:20] you serviceable
[1:04:21] something that's going to do something
[1:04:22] for him amen let's not stop because he
[1:04:25] cleaned us up from a life of sin
[1:04:27] but now we press on into a position to a
[1:04:30] promise of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:33] for people say peter said on the day of
[1:04:35] pentecost
[1:04:36] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:04:39] children and to them that's far off
[1:04:41] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:04:43] call
[1:04:44] amen so to step into canaan brother
[1:04:46] brown says is to step into a promise
[1:04:48] and step into a position as what an
[1:04:51] adopted son and daughter of god
[1:04:53] that's what we're looking for adoption
[1:04:54] is stepping into your place
[1:04:56] and your position amen so it's not just
[1:04:58] that you get the holy spirit but now
[1:05:00] you're going to be about the father's
[1:05:01] business
[1:05:02] and what is the father's business to
[1:05:04] take possession of what he's given you
[1:05:06] and to keep it in order and to hold on
[1:05:08] to it until such time as he calls you
[1:05:09] home amen
[1:05:11] but what it's still going to be an
[1:05:13] individual walk
[1:05:14] right this is an individual walk they
[1:05:16] might go in as a group over jordan
[1:05:18] but when they get in there at some point
[1:05:19] they have to separate and go their
[1:05:21] different ways and start
[1:05:22] taking over their own lands amen but at
[1:05:24] the same time brother branham points out
[1:05:26] time and time again
[1:05:28] what he points to our families and says
[1:05:30] they're a part of this
[1:05:31] amen he says what as many as the lord
[1:05:34] our god shall call so if god's still
[1:05:36] calling
[1:05:37] there's still hope amen he's still on
[1:05:40] the mercy seat could i put it that way
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:42] he's still on the mercy seat as long as
[1:05:44] the bride is here there's still a chance
[1:05:46] for somebody to come in
[1:05:47] amen there's going to be 11th hour
[1:05:48] workers and though it's funny is that
[1:05:50] the sixth hour workers and the eighth
[1:05:51] hour workers say
[1:05:52] nope nobody can come in after me it
[1:05:54] can't be that way man the scripture
[1:05:56] clearly says
[1:05:57] 11th hour worker there someone's going
[1:05:58] to come in work the last hour of the day
[1:06:00] and they'll get the exact same reward as
[1:06:02] the ones that work the entire day amen
[1:06:04] our children can still come in amen
[1:06:06] somebody can still walk in off the
[1:06:07] street brother weishal
[1:06:08] and get the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:06:10] amen it's still available because we
[1:06:12] have proof that it's still available
[1:06:14] amen it's still with us
[1:06:15] it's still in us i still have a daughter
[1:06:17] that got the holy spirit in the last few
[1:06:18] years amen
[1:06:19] so i know that it's still coming and
[1:06:21] then i know there's still blood on the
[1:06:22] mercy seat i know that it's still
[1:06:23] available
[1:06:24] to those that would have a need of it
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:27] but what is it right before we go in he
[1:06:29] says there's this last little cleaning
[1:06:30] up and this is a little that last work
[1:06:32] of sanctification we'll look at it in
[1:06:34] the scriptures
[1:06:34] just as we get a little deeper into this
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:38] what is it you can be all cleaned up but
[1:06:41] you're still walking in a dirty world
[1:06:43] amen with jesus what did he say when he
[1:06:44] was doing communion and foot washing
[1:06:46] with them in the last supper
[1:06:47] he says what i just need to clean your
[1:06:50] feet peter says no no clean every part
[1:06:51] of me and he says no no you only have
[1:06:53] need
[1:06:53] of your feet because what you're walking
[1:06:55] through a dirty world the rest of you
[1:06:57] has been sanctified he had sanctified
[1:06:58] them earlier
[1:06:59] right in scripture you look at he's
[1:07:00] already sanctified him but he says no no
[1:07:02] you just need to clean your feet because
[1:07:03] you're walking through this world and no
[1:07:05] matter how good and how moral you are
[1:07:06] satan's still going to be attacking he's
[1:07:08] still going to be throwing mud at you
[1:07:10] and he's going to throw spirits at you
[1:07:11] he's going to throw thoughts at you he's
[1:07:12] going to throw ideas at you he's going
[1:07:14] to tempt you
[1:07:14] and some of that stuff is going to stick
[1:07:16] a little bit until you clean it off amen
[1:07:18] there's got to be a sanctification and
[1:07:19] when they sanctify themselves
[1:07:21] there could be no uncleanliness allowed
[1:07:23] with them and then he says you notice
[1:07:25] there it says don't go at your wives men
[1:07:27] there's no intimacy there's no central
[1:07:28] intimacy allowed for three days
[1:07:30] everything has to be perfectly clean
[1:07:32] don't let any dirk get into your life
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] if god's moving clean up your life if
[1:07:37] you're expecting god to move
[1:07:39] clean up your life amen don't let that
[1:07:41] be the hindrance don't give satan an
[1:07:43] opportunity
[1:07:43] to hold you back but rather clean your
[1:07:45] life up so that there's no hindrance for
[1:07:46] god to move
[1:07:47] when he's wanting to move amen
[1:07:53] that's what joshua's saying here saying
[1:07:54] for three days clean up
[1:07:56] clean up and be ready because god's
[1:07:58] gonna move on the fourth day amen
[1:08:00] i would say for us the same thing if you
[1:08:02] believe god's moving or god's gonna move
[1:08:04] make sure your life's cleaned up and
[1:08:05] then make sure that your internet is
[1:08:07] cleaned up make sure that your apps are
[1:08:08] cleaned up make sure that your
[1:08:09] computer's cleaned up make sure that
[1:08:10] your friends are cleaned up
[1:08:12] make sure that how you spend your time
[1:08:13] is cleaned up that you're dedicating
[1:08:15] your life to christ so that when he
[1:08:17] wants to move you don't have anything
[1:08:19] amen nothing brother gerald talking you
[1:08:22] know about the minister coming up
[1:08:24] and he's got a he's got a thought on his
[1:08:27] on his mind and he's got something on
[1:08:28] his heart to preach
[1:08:29] but guess what you've got a need there
[1:08:31] and i've got to be able to surrender
[1:08:33] myself and brother gerald has to be able
[1:08:34] to surrender himself to get off of his
[1:08:35] notes
[1:08:36] and hit what you're doing but how does
[1:08:37] that happen we've got to sanctify
[1:08:39] ourselves amen
[1:08:40] i can't have a clinger in there i can't
[1:08:42] have a blockage there
[1:08:43] from something i did last night or this
[1:08:45] week that's holding back
[1:08:47] right that's got to be under the blood
[1:08:48] and i've got to be clean so that the
[1:08:50] holy spirit can move through me
[1:08:51] and touch your need has nothing to do
[1:08:53] with me i'm just making sure there's
[1:08:54] nothing there for him
[1:08:56] to hold him back amen and so it is with
[1:08:58] us and our families amen i'll look at
[1:09:00] the men especially and say
[1:09:01] if you're looking for god in the moving
[1:09:03] of the spirit in your life and your
[1:09:04] family
[1:09:04] make sure you're clean make sure god can
[1:09:07] use you because when he can use you now
[1:09:08] he can use that channel of authority
[1:09:10] to what work on your wife work on your
[1:09:12] children amen you've got to be cleaned
[1:09:14] up
[1:09:15] amen brother braham said this in
[1:09:17] adoption he says oh jesus was training
[1:09:19] 12 men
[1:09:20] that these 12 men was to take the gospel
[1:09:22] to the world and he said
[1:09:23] for their sake i sanctify myself
[1:09:26] sometimes we think it's for us he says
[1:09:28] no for their sake i sanctify myself
[1:09:30] make yourself for your neighbor's sake
[1:09:33] for somebody else's sake
[1:09:34] don't use your liberty for a cloak said
[1:09:37] paul but sanctify yourself
[1:09:39] behave yourself in the neighborhood like
[1:09:41] a real christian ought to
[1:09:43] let your communications be if you're you
[1:09:45] meet your enemy
[1:09:46] sanctify yourself for his sake not
[1:09:48] knowing what you might do what
[1:09:49] you're in a bad attitude you're in a bad
[1:09:51] place and somebody comes up at you and
[1:09:53] starts poking at you
[1:09:54] you're not going to respond with the
[1:09:55] love of christ if you aren't sanctified
[1:09:57] right because you're prickly you've got
[1:09:59] those clingers from the world on there
[1:10:00] you've got some dirt there
[1:10:01] and guess what that book you read that
[1:10:02] movie you saw that clip on youtube
[1:10:04] whatever it might be is going to be what
[1:10:06] comes out of your mouth
[1:10:07] and what's projected through you rather
[1:10:08] than the holy spirit why you're not
[1:10:10] cleaned up
[1:10:11] right sanctify your home and life so
[1:10:14] that there's nothing satan can use
[1:10:16] amen render him useless in the
[1:10:18] millennium remember
[1:10:20] that brother brahm said satan was bound
[1:10:22] by what chains of circumstance right he
[1:10:24] had nobody to work in
[1:10:26] why because all of the all of the
[1:10:28] ungodly are dead and all that's there
[1:10:30] are the believers right what satan has
[1:10:32] nobody to work in
[1:10:33] if he's got nobody working then he
[1:10:35] shouldn't have anybody to work in now
[1:10:37] when it comes to our life amen we should
[1:10:39] be as sanctified now as we're going to
[1:10:40] be over there
[1:10:41] amen that's what we want to be because
[1:10:43] our character doesn't change so your
[1:10:45] character what you're doing here
[1:10:46] means you wouldn't do it over there
[1:10:47] either amen amen first john 3
[1:10:51] 20 says for if our heart condemn us god
[1:10:53] is greater than our heart
[1:10:54] and knoweth all things beloved if our
[1:10:57] heart condemn us not
[1:10:58] then have we confidence toward god how
[1:11:00] are you going to pray when you've got
[1:11:01] something lingering over you and you
[1:11:02] know that you've done something you
[1:11:04] shouldn't you've got something in your
[1:11:05] home something in your life
[1:11:06] and it's not covered up amen amen how
[1:11:08] are you going to pray like that
[1:11:10] what you've got to make that right
[1:11:11] you've got to make sure that there's no
[1:11:13] condemnation there
[1:11:14] because what then in verse 22 it says
[1:11:17] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:11:20] because we keep his commandments and do
[1:11:22] those things that are pleasing
[1:11:23] in his sight amen you want to beat satan
[1:11:26] to the bunch
[1:11:26] clean up your life because he works with
[1:11:29] those things satan loves to work in
[1:11:30] darkness right he loves to work in the
[1:11:32] shadows
[1:11:32] and if you've got that little spot of
[1:11:34] darkness in your life that's where he'll
[1:11:35] hide
[1:11:35] and it'll be like a cancer that spreads
[1:11:37] out from there and he'll go bigger and
[1:11:38] bigger and bigger and bigger
[1:11:40] amen sometimes i think if they had the
[1:11:42] internet on the day of pentecost they
[1:11:43] never would have got the holy ghost
[1:11:45] because they would have been what they
[1:11:46] would have been reading up on the news
[1:11:48] reading the latest things on did jesus
[1:11:50] rise did he not what's the latest
[1:11:51] you know investigation into this right
[1:11:54] did he really go up
[1:11:55] how many are there are they looking for
[1:11:57] us do we need to move from place to
[1:11:59] place to place to stay ahead of the
[1:12:00] authorities or the priests or these
[1:12:01] different things
[1:12:02] what is it the internet can just suck us
[1:12:04] in can't it it can pull us in to where
[1:12:06] all we're focused on is what the world
[1:12:08] is telling us rather than what the word
[1:12:09] is telling us amen
[1:12:11] but what they what did they do they went
[1:12:12] up and they separated themselves for 10
[1:12:14] days with nobody in and nobody out
[1:12:16] they just stayed there and they cut
[1:12:17] themselves off from it amen we're so
[1:12:19] bombarded today by information
[1:12:21] by entertainment and ideas of the world
[1:12:23] it's insane
[1:12:24] i mean you get it just at work just at
[1:12:26] work and you know you're not doing
[1:12:28] anything
[1:12:29] special you're not going out of your way
[1:12:30] to be worldly but just the things that
[1:12:32] come across my way
[1:12:33] whether it's language whether it's jokes
[1:12:35] whether it's new ideas all of the
[1:12:37] support for alternative lifestyles it's
[1:12:39] all in the workplace now
[1:12:40] and people talk about it constantly and
[1:12:42] then if you go online it's even worse
[1:12:44] amen what is it satan's bombarding us
[1:12:46] and we're lacking that quiet time with
[1:12:47] god
[1:12:48] right we're lacking that quiet time
[1:12:49] where we separate ourselves and say lord
[1:12:51] this is just for me and you the other
[1:12:54] day i was driving somewhere and i had a
[1:12:56] bit of a ways to go and
[1:12:57] usually i just go in plug in my phone
[1:12:58] and hit my music and drive
[1:13:00] but i said no not today i said lord i've
[1:13:03] got some things i need to talk to you
[1:13:04] about
[1:13:05] and for that next 30 minutes or so
[1:13:07] that's what i did was him and i talked
[1:13:09] and you know as soon as you give him
[1:13:10] that time as soon as you give him that
[1:13:13] time he responds doesn't he
[1:13:15] listen our kids love to spend time with
[1:13:16] us don't they
[1:13:18] if you give your kid time he's not going
[1:13:19] to waste it right he's not going to say
[1:13:21] no dad not today no mom not today if you
[1:13:22] do something with your kids if you
[1:13:24] show them they're special if you give
[1:13:25] them your time and attention they thrive
[1:13:27] under it
[1:13:28] and then you give your spouse the time
[1:13:29] that they need what is it
[1:13:31] they thrive your employees right if you
[1:13:33] give them time and extra attention they
[1:13:35] thrive under it
[1:13:35] how much more do you think god is
[1:13:37] sitting there wanting to to have us
[1:13:39] thrive by spending time with him we're
[1:13:41] not going to him and blessing him we're
[1:13:43] going to him and he's blessing us
[1:13:45] we lift up our praises to him we give
[1:13:47] him glory and honor in these different
[1:13:48] things
[1:13:49] but the blessing is truly from him to us
[1:13:51] and all we have to do is give him that
[1:13:53] time
[1:13:53] all we have to do is set aside that time
[1:13:55] say lord i'm just going to be quiet
[1:13:56] before you
[1:13:57] and it's not about quantity it's about
[1:14:00] quality
[1:14:01] i'll tell you one sincere and honest
[1:14:02] prayer before god
[1:14:04] does a whole lot better than some
[1:14:05] long-winded prayer where you won't go
[1:14:07] near the prickly bits of your life
[1:14:08] the little things that you know are
[1:14:09] hanging on or the big things you know
[1:14:11] that are there
[1:14:12] and you're just there and you're lifting
[1:14:13] your heads and lord you're so good and
[1:14:14] you're so great and i
[1:14:15] love you and he's saying well why don't
[1:14:17] you just open up your life to me
[1:14:18] let's have a real conversation sanctify
[1:14:22] yourself
[1:14:23] amen amen
[1:14:26] what did brother brahm say this is all
[1:14:27] what a process
[1:14:29] of getting ready to inherit the promise
[1:14:32] remember what he said don't let your
[1:14:34] liberty be a cloak for what
[1:14:36] trip somebody else up amen
[1:14:40] amen there's so coming out but now we're
[1:14:42] talking about it going in amen
[1:14:43] there's a process in there and that's
[1:14:44] the adoption that brother bannon's been
[1:14:46] talking about throughout this series and
[1:14:47] adoption amen
[1:14:49] joshua 3 6 says and joshua spake unto
[1:14:51] the priest saying take up the ark of the
[1:14:52] covenant
[1:14:53] and pass over before the people i am
[1:14:55] going to move pretty quickly through a
[1:14:56] lot of this because we covered it in
[1:14:57] that one service
[1:14:59] but we're going to hit it from a bit of
[1:15:00] a different angle this morning amen and
[1:15:02] they took up the ark of the covenant and
[1:15:03] went before the people and the lord said
[1:15:05] unto joshua
[1:15:06] this day will i begin to magnify thee
[1:15:08] and the sight of all israel that they
[1:15:10] may know that as i was with moses
[1:15:12] so i will be with thee and thou shalt
[1:15:14] command the priests that bear the ark of
[1:15:16] the covenant saying when ye are come to
[1:15:17] the brink of the water of jordan
[1:15:18] ye shall stand still in jordan and
[1:15:21] joshua said unto the children of israel
[1:15:23] come hither and hear the words of the
[1:15:24] lord your god
[1:15:26] and joshua said hereby ye shall know
[1:15:28] that the living god is among you
[1:15:31] this is the purpose of why they're
[1:15:32] crossing this way this day
[1:15:34] in this place hereby ye shall know that
[1:15:37] the living god is among you
[1:15:39] and that he will without fail drive out
[1:15:41] from before you the canaanites the
[1:15:43] hittites the hivites the parasites
[1:15:44] the gergescites the amorites and the
[1:15:46] jebusites amen the miracle they're about
[1:15:48] to see is to prove that god is opening
[1:15:50] up a way and
[1:15:51] because of that he's going to be with
[1:15:52] them all the way through the conquering
[1:15:54] of canaan right
[1:15:55] amen what happens in jordan is to prove
[1:15:58] that god is with you
[1:15:59] remember that when we cover jordan in
[1:16:01] the next service amen what happens in
[1:16:03] jordan is to prove that god is with you
[1:16:05] and he will be with you
[1:16:06] and in you even to the end of the age
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] what happens in jordan will solidify
[1:16:11] your faith in god
[1:16:13] right you'll never be the same after
[1:16:15] jordan i can guarantee that
[1:16:17] behold the ark of the covenant of the
[1:16:19] lord of all the earth passeth
[1:16:21] before over over before you into jordan
[1:16:25] now therefore take you 12 men out of the
[1:16:27] tribes of israel out of every tribe
[1:16:29] amen every tribe we said remember had a
[1:16:31] firsthand witness of what was about to
[1:16:33] happen
[1:16:34] everybody had a first-hand witness there
[1:16:36] was no excuses after this one
[1:16:38] but there's not going to be an excuse
[1:16:39] anyways because everyone's going to go
[1:16:41] through it but he says i want somebody
[1:16:42] to witness everybody needs somebody here
[1:16:44] that's going to be
[1:16:44] a guaranteed a set of eyes at the front
[1:16:47] lines here
[1:16:48] and it shall come to pass as soon as the
[1:16:50] souls of the feet of the priests that
[1:16:52] bear the ark of the lord
[1:16:53] the lord of all the earth shall rest in
[1:16:55] the waters of jordan that the waters of
[1:16:57] jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[1:16:58] that come down from above
[1:17:00] and they shall stand up and heap and
[1:17:03] then we talked about this before
[1:17:04] they had to step into the jordan in
[1:17:06] order for the way to open up
[1:17:08] amen there's a difference here between
[1:17:10] the red sea we'll probably cover it next
[1:17:11] time because we won't have time today
[1:17:13] amen but they had to trust the word of
[1:17:14] god and step into the raging water
[1:17:17] before
[1:17:17] it would part and it came to pass when
[1:17:20] the people removed from their tents to
[1:17:22] pass over jordan
[1:17:23] and the priests bearing the ark of the
[1:17:24] covenant before the people and
[1:17:26] as they that bear the ark were come unto
[1:17:28] jordan and the feet of the priests that
[1:17:30] bear the ark were dipped in the brim of
[1:17:32] the water
[1:17:33] for jordan overflowed all of his banks
[1:17:35] all the time of the harvest
[1:17:36] that the waters which came down from
[1:17:38] above stood and rose up upon a heap very
[1:17:41] far from the city adam that is behind
[1:17:43] beside zaraton and those that came down
[1:17:46] toward the sea of the plane even the
[1:17:47] salt sea failed and were cut off
[1:17:49] and the people passed over right against
[1:17:52] jericho and then so it stood up on a
[1:17:55] wall on one side and all the water just
[1:17:57] washed away on the other side so you
[1:17:58] have a wall here and you have nothing
[1:18:00] there
[1:18:01] it says and those men what the people
[1:18:03] passed over but the first man had to
[1:18:04] walk into jordan
[1:18:06] and do it with full confidence that god
[1:18:07] would keep his word this was not a red
[1:18:10] sea crossing this was a jordan crossing
[1:18:11] and they had to go in obedience to the
[1:18:13] word
[1:18:13] in faith and step into that water
[1:18:16] trusting that when they did they would
[1:18:17] not lose the word they would not lose
[1:18:19] the ark they would not lose their lives
[1:18:20] but the waters would roll back amen it
[1:18:22] was just this is a supernatural event
[1:18:24] that's happening here but it was
[1:18:26] especially supernatural for those men
[1:18:28] because they were the first ones to do
[1:18:29] it
[1:18:29] they were the first ones to go with the
[1:18:31] word and take it and step into that
[1:18:33] water and trust that god would move it
[1:18:34] back amen
[1:18:35] not only that but they have to stand
[1:18:36] there for hours they didn't just walk in
[1:18:39] to roll back and they cross to the other
[1:18:40] side
[1:18:40] they go in and they stand in the middle
[1:18:43] they're standing in the breach
[1:18:45] and they're standing there and they're
[1:18:46] holding that word on their shoulders for
[1:18:48] hours
[1:18:48] while the entire group of children of
[1:18:50] israel cross over
[1:18:52] it says and the priests that bear the
[1:18:53] ark of the covenant of the lord stood
[1:18:55] firm on dry ground in the midst of
[1:18:57] jordan and
[1:18:58] all the israelites passed over on dry
[1:19:00] ground until all the people were passed
[1:19:02] clean over jordan i mean i love that
[1:19:04] they stood firm
[1:19:05] they held fast and then they didn't
[1:19:07] waver they didn't flinch they didn't
[1:19:09] slowly inch their way over to the other
[1:19:10] side
[1:19:11] they weren't yelling at people go go go
[1:19:14] it says they just stood firm
[1:19:16] holding on to the word amen what held it
[1:19:18] back it wasn't their faith it was the
[1:19:20] word
[1:19:21] the word was one that made the promise
[1:19:22] and then god had given the promise and
[1:19:24] all they're doing is stand there saying
[1:19:25] we're holding on to this word and
[1:19:26] trusting that god will protect his word
[1:19:29] amen that god will back up his word and
[1:19:31] if we're in obedience and we're holding
[1:19:32] on to it then it will hold its place
[1:19:34] amen their job
[1:19:35] was not to move once they had gotten
[1:19:37] there to hold firm
[1:19:39] until every single person had crossed
[1:19:41] over amen
[1:19:43] they put their lives on the line they
[1:19:45] put their reputations on the line
[1:19:47] what just to prove god was real to those
[1:19:50] people amen
[1:19:51] they had to step forward in faith amen
[1:19:53] only then would the people cross
[1:19:54] only when they saw the way it was clear
[1:19:56] only when they saw the miracle happening
[1:19:58] would the people cross over amen but
[1:20:00] those men had to say i'll go first
[1:20:02] we'll go first and guess what they
[1:20:04] didn't preach this teach this at
[1:20:05] preschool
[1:20:06] this was not an experience that their
[1:20:08] seminary had taught them amen this was a
[1:20:10] new
[1:20:10] movement this was a new change in
[1:20:12] direction this was a new leadership
[1:20:14] they had to trust that god was using
[1:20:16] joshua moses is gone they're under new
[1:20:18] leadership now
[1:20:19] and they had to trust that god was with
[1:20:20] him the exact same way he was with moses
[1:20:22] amen listen to this brother braham says
[1:20:25] and whenever you see the ministry
[1:20:27] preaching
[1:20:28] the word so plainly you see god coming
[1:20:30] down and confirming that word
[1:20:32] what do you wait on why terry
[1:20:36] preaching is not speaking just speaking
[1:20:39] it's speaking and living amen those men
[1:20:42] weren't just talking to talk they were
[1:20:43] walking to walk weren't they
[1:20:45] they put their lives where their mouths
[1:20:47] were amen they took the word and it
[1:20:49] didn't just live on their mouth now
[1:20:50] it lived in their lives and their feet
[1:20:52] started obeying the word
[1:20:54] and that's what he's talking about when
[1:20:55] you see the ministry preaching the word
[1:20:56] so plainly you see god coming down
[1:20:59] and confirming that word what do you
[1:21:00] wait on he says why terry then it's time
[1:21:02] to rise and say yes lord with a firm
[1:21:05] solid faith my faith looks up to thee i
[1:21:07] believe you
[1:21:08] i'll stay with you lord you're the pilot
[1:21:10] of my ship take me through lord i've
[1:21:12] come to go through with you no matter
[1:21:14] what the cost is what the price is what
[1:21:16] the distance is
[1:21:17] i'll sail this ship with you
[1:21:21] will we do that
[1:21:26] brother brown continues he says and
[1:21:27] joshua now his word was at stake
[1:21:29] yes sir just as noah of old but joshua
[1:21:32] must cross over this river
[1:21:34] and look like he picked the worst time
[1:21:35] that could ever be thought
[1:21:37] but god likes to take those kinds of
[1:21:39] times to prove
[1:21:40] that he's god and men of god who believe
[1:21:43] god and know what god has promised is
[1:21:44] not afraid to do it
[1:21:46] because god will stick with his word
[1:21:47] just as certain as he is god
[1:21:50] and when he said first take the ark and
[1:21:52] go forward
[1:21:53] and when those priests feed touch that
[1:21:54] jordan no matter how wild she was and
[1:21:56] how she was swelling
[1:21:57] it give away to god's eternal word for
[1:21:59] the word was in the ark
[1:22:01] god said now heavens and earth will pass
[1:22:03] away but my word shall never pass away
[1:22:05] and joshua knowing that his word must
[1:22:07] rest upon god's word
[1:22:09] and he put god's word first he says i
[1:22:11] wish you sick people here tonight would
[1:22:13] do that
[1:22:14] put god's word with your confession put
[1:22:17] your confession
[1:22:18] you believe it and set it out there and
[1:22:20] call those things which are not as
[1:22:22] though they were
[1:22:23] then we're marching on do it that way
[1:22:25] god's word will take it through
[1:22:27] and as the priest's feet touched jordan
[1:22:29] she just rolled back from side to side
[1:22:32] and the water stayed now catch this he
[1:22:34] says do you realize
[1:22:36] the roaring of that river would have
[1:22:37] brought forth a bank in there
[1:22:39] in 20 minutes time would have been as
[1:22:41] big as some of these modern big dams
[1:22:42] that we've got
[1:22:43] the colorado boulder dam out there the
[1:22:46] way that jordan sweeps through there is
[1:22:48] coming out of the mountains with a great
[1:22:49] force and she's sweeping through those
[1:22:50] valleys and when two million footmen
[1:22:53] with women and children capacity they're
[1:22:54] probably taking four or five hours or
[1:22:56] more
[1:22:57] and what do you think that river would
[1:22:58] have filled up but god stayed the stream
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] oh how i love that he stayed the streams
[1:23:03] and she laid there until they passed
[1:23:04] over
[1:23:04] you imagine those priests sitting there
[1:23:06] they're standing there they've got the
[1:23:07] word over their shoulder
[1:23:09] and the river perhaps started 20 feet
[1:23:11] deep but
[1:23:12] every second they stand there all of the
[1:23:14] volume of the water the mountains is
[1:23:16] building up in front of them
[1:23:17] and it's getting bigger and bigger and
[1:23:19] bigger and bigger
[1:23:21] tens of stories just building up up
[1:23:24] up up up up up in front of them behind
[1:23:26] them and they're sitting there listening
[1:23:28] to him
[1:23:30] probably can't see the sun by the time
[1:23:32] it's done
[1:23:33] it's up so high and they're standing in
[1:23:35] the shadow of certain death
[1:23:38] as we talked about for four hours they
[1:23:41] stood there
[1:23:42] do you think the hair was rising on the
[1:23:44] back of their neck
[1:23:46] he opened the way i don't know why
[1:23:47] they'd think he'd do anything but hold
[1:23:49] it back amen
[1:23:50] but still sometimes we're standing in
[1:23:52] the shadow of something and the hairs on
[1:23:54] our backs start to get prickly because
[1:23:55] you're looking at that and you're saying
[1:23:57] i really hope he holds it back amen but
[1:23:59] if he made the way
[1:24:02] he'll hold it amen look at god's timing
[1:24:05] worst time of the year to cross the
[1:24:08] river
[1:24:09] now we'll sit back and say lord you know
[1:24:11] we're only human
[1:24:13] we've got young kids i just gave birth
[1:24:15] to a baby
[1:24:16] this is not a time for us to cross right
[1:24:19] he knows we're human but what he's
[1:24:21] waiting for us to realize is that he's
[1:24:23] the supernatural god
[1:24:24] he's not just god but he is a
[1:24:25] supernatural god and so it's up to him
[1:24:28] to make the way
[1:24:29] it's up to us to realize that it's him
[1:24:30] that's doing it amen that we're trusting
[1:24:32] in him we're not trusting to the arm of
[1:24:34] flesh
[1:24:34] we're not trusting in something that
[1:24:35] some man told us but we're trusting to
[1:24:37] the ever
[1:24:38] unchanging never failing word of god
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:41] amen what's god's way through a raging
[1:24:44] river
[1:24:44] today worst time of the year today
[1:24:48] let's go you've had warning you've seen
[1:24:50] it build up doesn't matter
[1:24:52] you have to go across there's no canoes
[1:24:53] there's no rafts and then there's no
[1:24:55] running the line across like they did in
[1:24:57] the old times and then
[1:24:58] going across and handing over hand none
[1:25:00] of this
[1:25:01] right there wasn't a convenient way to
[1:25:02] cross over they had to go through the
[1:25:04] jordan that day
[1:25:06] god's way amen and there's only one way
[1:25:08] to ever come to the kingdom
[1:25:09] there's only ever one way to come to the
[1:25:11] kingdom amen it's acts 2 38
[1:25:12] always has been and always will as
[1:25:14] brother joel said straight is the gate
[1:25:16] narrows the way and few there be that
[1:25:17] find it amen
[1:25:20] straight is the gate narrows the way few
[1:25:22] there be that find it
[1:25:23] amen the only access to the promised
[1:25:25] land was in god's time
[1:25:26] and that was through a supernatural
[1:25:28] event amen let me tell you if you
[1:25:30] believe that you have experienced god
[1:25:32] that you have god inside of you and you
[1:25:33] haven't experienced a supernatural event
[1:25:35] something's wrong it has to be a
[1:25:37] supernatural event we're talking about a
[1:25:39] new birth
[1:25:40] i mean a new birth is supernatural a new
[1:25:42] birth is supernatural so if we're
[1:25:43] sitting here and we're saying yeah yeah
[1:25:45] i did this and i did that and
[1:25:46] that to that and there was no
[1:25:47] supernatural something's wrong
[1:25:49] amen we serve a supernatural god
[1:25:51] everything he spoke about when it comes
[1:25:52] to the believer is supernatural
[1:25:55] right so if we're sitting here with an
[1:25:57] experience that is not supernatural
[1:25:58] we've got a problem
[1:25:59] amen i need to have a new birth i need
[1:26:02] to have a change in my life i had to
[1:26:04] to kill jonathan corlett a man so that a
[1:26:06] new birth could come out amen and that's
[1:26:08] a supernatural event
[1:26:09] because nobody kills himself and comes
[1:26:12] back alive
[1:26:13] but yet here we sit amen
[1:26:19] continuing joshua chapter 4 verse 1. it
[1:26:22] says and it came to pass when all the
[1:26:23] people were passed
[1:26:24] clean passed over jordan that the lord
[1:26:26] spake unto joshua saying take you 12 men
[1:26:28] out of the people
[1:26:29] out of every man tribe of man and
[1:26:31] command ye
[1:26:32] them saying take your hence out of the
[1:26:33] midst of jordan the place where the
[1:26:35] priests
[1:26:36] feet stood firm 12 stones and you shall
[1:26:38] carry them over with you and leave them
[1:26:39] in the lodging place where you shall
[1:26:40] stand this night
[1:26:41] so those 12 witnesses he says all right
[1:26:43] go get the stones
[1:26:44] the priests are saying they're probably
[1:26:45] saying hurry come on
[1:26:48] you know stones really we're going to do
[1:26:50] stones no he says we've got to
[1:26:51] commemorate this
[1:26:52] there's got to be an altar builder
[1:26:53] there's got to be something to
[1:26:54] commemorate this great miracle that's
[1:26:55] here
[1:26:56] and i need 12 men to do it so the
[1:26:57] priests hold on a second guys we're
[1:26:59] going to get some stones
[1:27:01] then joshua called the 12 men whom he
[1:27:03] had prepared of the children of israel
[1:27:05] out of every tribe of man and joshua
[1:27:07] said to them passover before the ark of
[1:27:09] the lord your god into the midst of
[1:27:10] jordan
[1:27:10] and take you up every man of you a stone
[1:27:12] upon his shoulder according unto the
[1:27:14] number of the tribes of the children of
[1:27:15] israel
[1:27:16] that this may be a sign among you that
[1:27:18] when your children ask their fathers in
[1:27:20] time to come saying what mean ye by
[1:27:22] these stones
[1:27:23] then ye shall answer them that the
[1:27:24] waters of jordan were cut off before the
[1:27:26] ark of the covenant of the lord
[1:27:30] wasn't cut off before the men it was cut
[1:27:32] off before the word
[1:27:33] and then the word is what cut it off
[1:27:35] when it passed over jordan the waters of
[1:27:37] jordan were cut off and these stones
[1:27:38] shall be for a memorial under the
[1:27:40] children of israel
[1:27:41] forever and the children of israel did
[1:27:43] so as joshua commanded and took up 12
[1:27:45] stones out of the midst of jordan
[1:27:47] as the lord spake unto joshua according
[1:27:49] to the number of the tribes of the
[1:27:50] children of israel
[1:27:51] and carried over them over with them
[1:27:53] unto a place where they lodged and laid
[1:27:55] them down there
[1:27:56] and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst
[1:27:58] of jordan in the place where the feet of
[1:28:00] the priests which bear the ark of the
[1:28:01] covenant stood and they are there unto
[1:28:03] this day
[1:28:03] for the priests which bear the ark stood
[1:28:05] in the midst of jordan this is these men
[1:28:08] this is a ministry standing there until
[1:28:10] everything was finished that the lord
[1:28:12] commanded joshua to speak unto the
[1:28:14] people
[1:28:14] according to all that moses commanded
[1:28:16] joshua and the people hasted and passed
[1:28:18] over
[1:28:19] and it came to pass when all the people
[1:28:21] were clean passed over that the ark of
[1:28:22] the lord passed over
[1:28:24] and the priests in the presence of the
[1:28:25] people
[1:28:27] stood there and stood there and stood
[1:28:28] there and stood there until
[1:28:30] everyone that was supposed to come in
[1:28:32] came in
[1:28:33] amen what did our pastor say this
[1:28:34] morning what's the ministry there for
[1:28:36] for the perfecting of the saints until
[1:28:37] they come into what the unity of faith
[1:28:39] but brother brahm say the unity of the
[1:28:41] faith was the rapture
[1:28:43] amen until it's all done they have to
[1:28:44] stand in the presence of the people
[1:28:46] until everyone's in
[1:28:47] and then they step out and it closes
[1:28:49] over amen
[1:28:51] and joshua sorry and the children of
[1:28:53] reuben and the children of gad
[1:28:55] and half the tribe of manasseh passed
[1:28:56] over armed before the children of israel
[1:28:58] as moses spake unto them
[1:29:00] about forty thousand prepared for war
[1:29:02] passed over before the lord unto battle
[1:29:04] to the plains of jericho on that day the
[1:29:06] lord magnified joshua in the sight of
[1:29:08] all israel and they feared him
[1:29:10] as they fear moses all the days of his
[1:29:12] life and the lord spake unto joshua
[1:29:14] saying
[1:29:15] command the priests that bear the ark of
[1:29:17] the testimony that they come out of
[1:29:19] that they come up out of jordan joshua
[1:29:21] therefore commanded the precinct come ye
[1:29:23] up out of jordan
[1:29:26] sometimes it's so simple what'd he say
[1:29:29] he said
[1:29:29] joshua say come up out of jordan what
[1:29:32] did joshua say
[1:29:33] come up out of jordan he didn't say boys
[1:29:37] you stood there a long time and god has
[1:29:39] given me a tremendous message for you
[1:29:41] today is the day of your deliverance
[1:29:44] come on out
[1:29:45] what did he say god said tell them to
[1:29:46] come up and he said come up
[1:29:49] he just said what god said he didn't add
[1:29:51] to it he didn't embellish it
[1:29:53] he didn't turn it into some big flowery
[1:29:55] sermon he didn't turn into some big
[1:29:57] thing about him
[1:29:58] god said say this and he said it amen
[1:30:02] we'll see that exact same thing over and
[1:30:04] over and over again with children of god
[1:30:06] they say what god says they don't add to
[1:30:09] it
[1:30:09] they don't take away from it because
[1:30:11] what the flowery speech would have added
[1:30:12] a lot to who
[1:30:14] joshua right my he's a great speaker
[1:30:17] such a powerful speaker he is
[1:30:19] no god said say this and he said it and
[1:30:22] they did
[1:30:22] and then what happened amen
[1:30:25] and it came to pass when the priests
[1:30:27] that bear the ark of the covenant of the
[1:30:28] lord will come up out of the midst of
[1:30:29] jordan
[1:30:30] and the souls of the priest's feet were
[1:30:31] lifted up onto the dry land
[1:30:33] that the waters of jordan returned onto
[1:30:35] their place and flowed over all his
[1:30:36] banks as they did before went right back
[1:30:38] to normal
[1:30:39] and then it closed behind them there's
[1:30:40] no going back it was a finished work can
[1:30:42] we say it that way
[1:30:43] it was a finished work everyone was in
[1:30:45] safe and then it closed over and there
[1:30:47] was no going back for a long time
[1:30:49] to go back you had to work at it you had
[1:30:51] to build rafts
[1:30:52] or wait for the river to go down and
[1:30:54] that basically meant they were not going
[1:30:56] back
[1:30:57] you're not going to cross hundreds of
[1:30:58] thousands of people over anytime quickly
[1:31:00] amen
[1:31:00] what was it from here on out they needed
[1:31:03] to conquer to eat
[1:31:05] they needed to conquer to live they
[1:31:06] needed to conquer in order to have a
[1:31:08] future
[1:31:09] when that river closed they had one more
[1:31:10] night of mana i believe and then that
[1:31:12] was it they had to eat of the old corn
[1:31:13] and then from there it was conquering
[1:31:15] taking over and what they they ate what
[1:31:17] they conquered
[1:31:18] amen and the people came up out of
[1:31:21] jordan on the tenth day
[1:31:23] of the first month and encamped in
[1:31:24] gilgal in the east border of jericho
[1:31:26] and those 12 stones which they took out
[1:31:28] of jordan did joshua pitch
[1:31:30] at gilgal and he spake unto the children
[1:31:32] of israel saying when your children
[1:31:33] shall ask their fathers in time to come
[1:31:34] saying what mean these stones
[1:31:36] then you shall let your children know
[1:31:37] saying israel came over this jordan
[1:31:39] on dry land for the lord your god dried
[1:31:42] up the waters of jordan from before you
[1:31:44] until you were passed over as the lord
[1:31:47] your god did to the red sea which he
[1:31:48] dried up before us
[1:31:49] until we were gone over it says god that
[1:31:52] took us out is the god that took us in
[1:31:54] and then he hasn't changed he hasn't
[1:31:55] lost his power he hasn't lost his
[1:31:57] willingness to help his children
[1:31:58] right he hasn't lost the supernatural
[1:32:00] effect of his presence it's still here
[1:32:02] with us is what he was saying
[1:32:04] that all the people of the earth might
[1:32:05] know the hand of the lord
[1:32:07] that it is mighty that ye might fear the
[1:32:09] lord your god
[1:32:10] forever amen amen a monument of 12
[1:32:13] stones
[1:32:15] placed there you'll see there's 12
[1:32:17] stones in the in the new testament as
[1:32:18] well amen
[1:32:19] we'll get to that a little bit later
[1:32:21] amen let's start talking about our side
[1:32:23] amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 1
[1:32:24] if we would ephesians chapter 1.
[1:32:29] so we've got to cover two things here
[1:32:32] we'll do one today and then one
[1:32:33] on wednesday lord willing so we've got
[1:32:35] the promised land and then we've got
[1:32:37] jordan
[1:32:38] so we need to know what the promised
[1:32:39] land is and then we've got to know what
[1:32:41] jordan is and what it means and what
[1:32:42] that process is because remember brother
[1:32:44] i'm speaking of a process to get to the
[1:32:45] promised land
[1:32:46] so you got to know where you're going
[1:32:48] but you've got to know what it is you've
[1:32:49] got to pass through in order to get
[1:32:50] there
[1:32:51] because there's no other way of coming
[1:32:52] in amen it's like the the the man that
[1:32:54] was at the wedding feast remember he
[1:32:55] didn't have the garment on he didn't
[1:32:56] have the wedding garment on and he was
[1:32:58] kicked out he came another way
[1:32:59] there has to be god's provided way of
[1:33:02] coming in amen
[1:33:04] amen so what's the promised land for us
[1:33:06] for them it was a physical land called
[1:33:07] canaan
[1:33:08] right very clear very easy for them to
[1:33:10] know amen they were the natural seed of
[1:33:12] abraham where the spiritual seed of
[1:33:14] abraham so we can see here in ephesians
[1:33:15] 1
[1:33:17] verse 9. now we covered a bit of this
[1:33:20] before and again
[1:33:21] as we read a lot of joshua sometimes
[1:33:22] over and over we're going to read
[1:33:24] portions of ephesians over and over
[1:33:25] because there's so much in it
[1:33:26] and there's so many different angles and
[1:33:28] aspects of how it applies amen
[1:33:31] so ephesians 1 9 says having made note
[1:33:33] unto us the mystery of his will
[1:33:35] now how many remembers what the mystery
[1:33:36] of his will is from that last service we
[1:33:38] preached on
[1:33:39] and it's a manifestation of the sons of
[1:33:40] god the the mystery of his will is that
[1:33:43] it was what god above us god with us now
[1:33:46] god in us
[1:33:46] amen that's the finishing of the mystery
[1:33:48] that's to happen in this age
[1:33:49] and revelation 10 right the mystery of
[1:33:52] god should be finished
[1:33:53] so having made known unto us the mystery
[1:33:55] of his will which is the manifestation
[1:33:57] of the sons of god
[1:33:58] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:33:59] hath purposed in ourselves it's all him
[1:34:01] it's nothing of us
[1:34:03] in that in in the calling in the
[1:34:04] creating of it in the in the bringing
[1:34:06] out of it
[1:34:07] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:34:08] of times he might gather together
[1:34:10] in one all things in christ this is the
[1:34:12] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:34:14] for the gentiles this is the last stage
[1:34:16] amen this is
[1:34:16] now so he says he's going to gather
[1:34:19] together in one all things in christ
[1:34:20] both which are in heaven and earth even
[1:34:22] in him
[1:34:22] resurrection and rapture amen amen so
[1:34:24] the culmination of the mystery of his
[1:34:26] will is the resurrection the rapture
[1:34:28] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:34:30] inheritance that's our promised land
[1:34:32] right that's the inheritance having
[1:34:34] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:34:36] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:34:38] council of
[1:34:38] his own will that we should be to the
[1:34:41] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:34:43] christ
[1:34:44] in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[1:34:46] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[1:34:48] your salvation
[1:34:49] in whom also after that ye believed
[1:34:52] after they believed ye were sealed with
[1:34:55] that holy spirit of promise
[1:34:58] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:35:00] until the redemption
[1:35:01] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:35:03] praise of his glory
[1:35:04] amen let's break this down a little bit
[1:35:06] so in verse 13 it says ye heard the word
[1:35:07] of truth which is the gospel
[1:35:09] then you trust that what you've heard is
[1:35:11] the truth then you act
[1:35:13] you accept offered salvation by faith
[1:35:15] then you receive confirmation
[1:35:17] confirmation from god that you did the
[1:35:18] right thing how
[1:35:20] the holy spirit right he gives you the
[1:35:22] holy spirit the holy spirit is your
[1:35:23] confirmation
[1:35:24] he says it is what the earnest of your
[1:35:26] inheritance it's the down payment
[1:35:29] amen but then he says there's an
[1:35:30] inheritance coming after that
[1:35:32] this is not just it but there's
[1:35:34] something comes after you get the
[1:35:35] earnest of the inheritance there's an
[1:35:37] actual inheritance that comes afterwards
[1:35:38] amen
[1:35:39] amen and it's tied to what the purpose
[1:35:41] of god it's tied to the manifestation of
[1:35:43] the sons and daughters of god
[1:35:44] and it's happening when the fullness of
[1:35:46] times we just read it so in the fullness
[1:35:48] of times is when the inheritance comes
[1:35:50] here
[1:35:50] before we go over there to what full
[1:35:52] redemption he says there's an
[1:35:53] inheritance that's
[1:35:55] what bringing us to full redemption
[1:35:57] right which is what a new body
[1:35:59] and then after that we're with christ
[1:36:00] and then we come down and we're here for
[1:36:01] a millennium and then we get a new
[1:36:02] heaven and a new earth
[1:36:03] and that's where we rule and reign with
[1:36:05] him forever right
[1:36:07] let's just take another scripture
[1:36:08] galatians 3. i've got it here you don't
[1:36:10] have to turn
[1:36:11] just to lock down so we're talking about
[1:36:12] the promised land so the promised land
[1:36:13] is not just the holy spirit
[1:36:15] but it's a life lived in the holy spirit
[1:36:17] amen there's a purpose after you get it
[1:36:18] god doesn't give it to you so you can
[1:36:20] stand there
[1:36:20] like a like a tree and just do nothing
[1:36:22] amen the tree's got to grow
[1:36:24] galatians 3 verse 13 says christ hath
[1:36:26] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:36:28] be made a curse for us for it is written
[1:36:31] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[1:36:33] tree
[1:36:33] he took our place that the blessing of
[1:36:36] abraham might come on the gentiles
[1:36:38] through jesus christ
[1:36:39] now remember what was the blessing of
[1:36:40] abraham for them naturally it was the
[1:36:42] land of canaan
[1:36:43] but he says now here there's a promise
[1:36:45] for you
[1:36:46] and it's a promise of abraham and it's
[1:36:47] for the gentiles it says that we might
[1:36:50] receive the promise of the spirit
[1:36:52] through faith amen so if we stop right
[1:36:54] there we see that christ
[1:36:56] what took the curse on us so that what
[1:36:58] the
[1:36:59] took the curse from us took it on
[1:37:01] himself so that the blessing of abraham
[1:37:02] might come on
[1:37:03] the seed of abraham that's why he took
[1:37:06] it so what's the promise he says
[1:37:08] it is the promise of the spirit the holy
[1:37:10] spirit through faith
[1:37:11] not through natural bloodlines amen this
[1:37:13] is through spiritual bloodlines this
[1:37:14] goes back to when we
[1:37:15] preached on the the seed amen
[1:37:18] this is what he's talking about now the
[1:37:20] promise of the spirit through faith was
[1:37:21] given to abraham he says
[1:37:23] and it's for the the spiritual seed of
[1:37:24] abraham not through grapes
[1:37:26] great not through works amen but by
[1:37:29] grace through faith
[1:37:30] amen there's no grapes
[1:37:34] listen to what brother braham says
[1:37:35] adoption number one he says now what is
[1:37:37] the lamb promised to the new testament
[1:37:38] believer
[1:37:39] the promise is the holy spirit for it
[1:37:41] shall come to pass in the last days
[1:37:43] joel 2 28 that i will pour out my spirit
[1:37:45] upon all flesh your sons and your
[1:37:47] daughters
[1:37:48] shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and
[1:37:50] my maidservants will i pour out of my
[1:37:52] spirit
[1:37:52] and they shall prophesy i'll show
[1:37:54] wonders in the heavens above
[1:37:55] and in the earth pillars of fire and
[1:37:57] smoke and vapor and peter said on the
[1:37:59] day of pentecost after taking his text
[1:38:01] and preaching repent every one of you
[1:38:02] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:38:04] christ for the remission
[1:38:05] to remit to forgive to take away all
[1:38:08] back trespasses
[1:38:10] so our promised land is the holy spirit
[1:38:12] but as i said it's not just the holy
[1:38:13] spirit but it's a life
[1:38:14] lived in the holy spirit after you get
[1:38:16] the holy spirit
[1:38:17] and then when they crossed over jordan
[1:38:19] they just didn't stand there they had a
[1:38:20] work to do they had a purpose they had
[1:38:21] an inheritance
[1:38:22] to claim amen so how do you get in there
[1:38:25] everyone has to go through jordan he
[1:38:27] says what by one spirit are you baptized
[1:38:30] into this body amen you've got to be
[1:38:32] baptized through the holy spirit
[1:38:33] and then to get into that inheritance
[1:38:35] you can't be in there without the holy
[1:38:36] spirit
[1:38:37] you'll die you'll never make it right
[1:38:39] because it takes a supernatural god to
[1:38:41] claim a supernatural inheritance
[1:38:43] to take a supernatural position so
[1:38:44] without the holy spirit
[1:38:46] you cannot take what is listed in the
[1:38:49] word as your possession
[1:38:50] you can't do it you can sit there all
[1:38:51] day long and look at it and you'll take
[1:38:53] this and you'll take that but the
[1:38:54] problem is god will give you exactly
[1:38:55] what you're asking for but it won't have
[1:38:57] the christian
[1:38:58] character that's required of the bride
[1:38:59] of christ and so it will lead you to
[1:39:01] destruction every time
[1:39:02] there's people out there that approve
[1:39:04] the prosperity gospel time and time
[1:39:06] again
[1:39:07] it's real guess what you can believe for
[1:39:09] money
[1:39:10] and guess what god will give you exactly
[1:39:12] what you asked for but you ask a miss
[1:39:14] and then you're asking according to the
[1:39:15] lust of your own heart and he gives it
[1:39:16] to you and it leads you to destruction
[1:39:18] because there's no character with it
[1:39:19] there's no what does the lord want for
[1:39:20] me it's what do i want and then you when
[1:39:22] you start selectively taking these
[1:39:24] promises and god will honor your faith
[1:39:25] but it's not going to take you into the
[1:39:26] promised land you're just selectively
[1:39:28] taking what you want
[1:39:29] out of his book amen so first before you
[1:39:33] go into the promised land before you
[1:39:34] start taking promises before you start
[1:39:36] taking possession
[1:39:37] you've got to have the holy spirit
[1:39:38] that's the new birth the new birth is
[1:39:40] not
[1:39:40] getting down on your knees and saying
[1:39:41] lord i repent at an altar and then going
[1:39:43] and getting baptized that's not the new
[1:39:45] birth the new birth is when you get a
[1:39:46] new life
[1:39:47] and the new life is the holy spirit
[1:39:49] that's acts 2 38 why i keep saying acts
[1:39:51] 2 38
[1:39:52] amen peter told you how do you get in
[1:39:54] they said
[1:39:55] man and brethren what what are we
[1:39:56] supposed to do and he says and peter
[1:39:58] said to them
[1:39:59] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:40:01] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:40:02] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:40:03] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:40:05] now if you repent and you're baptized
[1:40:06] and you don't get the holy ghost you're
[1:40:08] not going to get in there
[1:40:09] you can't do two you got to go three you
[1:40:11] got to get the holy ghost you can't just
[1:40:13] stop at baptism
[1:40:14] amen i said this but i'll read it first
[1:40:16] corinthians 12 13 says for by one spirit
[1:40:19] are we all baptized into one body
[1:40:20] whether we be jews or gentiles
[1:40:22] whether we be bond or free and have been
[1:40:25] all made
[1:40:25] to drink into one spirit all of us
[1:40:28] everyone in the body of christ has the
[1:40:29] holy spirit
[1:40:30] they've got to because it's his life
[1:40:32] within us amen it's his work
[1:40:34] our meat is to do his work not to do our
[1:40:36] own amen
[1:40:38] amen the holy spirit is the earnest and
[1:40:40] if you don't have the earnest you don't
[1:40:41] get what's waiting at the end
[1:40:42] that's the down payment for what's
[1:40:43] coming so if you don't have the down
[1:40:45] payment how are you going to get what's
[1:40:46] at the end
[1:40:46] you cannot do it it's impossible amen
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:55] let's look at what happened just do a
[1:40:57] quick reminder here because we want to
[1:40:58] see
[1:40:59] the type in in joshua in our own lives
[1:41:01] amen if we're if we're looking at
[1:41:03] crossing into the promised land how they
[1:41:04] did it should be the way we do it
[1:41:06] and then so the first thing they did was
[1:41:07] they were told a time and a place to
[1:41:08] wait
[1:41:09] and then the promise is coming the
[1:41:11] promised land is coming but they're told
[1:41:12] a time
[1:41:13] and a place jordan three days the
[1:41:16] israelites were told to sanctify
[1:41:18] themselves to separate themselves from
[1:41:19] anything worldly and make sure that they
[1:41:21] stayed clean
[1:41:22] separate and keep clean right then god
[1:41:25] told them to put the word in front of
[1:41:26] them the ark in front of them and let it
[1:41:27] lead the way to the river
[1:41:29] so they put the word first when the ark
[1:41:31] came to the river
[1:41:32] the waters parted and were held back
[1:41:33] until all could cross over
[1:41:35] then the river closed backed up after
[1:41:37] they crossed over and a monument was
[1:41:39] raised to commemorate the event
[1:41:40] so we should see all of that when we
[1:41:42] look at the new birth in the new church
[1:41:44] amen
[1:41:44] in the new testament church so let's go
[1:41:46] piece by piece
[1:41:47] and i'll just push through on on on the
[1:41:50] screen here
[1:41:51] so we're looking for a time and a place
[1:41:54] luke 24 and this is jesus speaking to
[1:41:55] the disciples and he says
[1:41:57] then open he their understanding that
[1:41:58] they might understand the scriptures
[1:42:00] and said unto them thus it is written
[1:42:02] and thus it behoove christ to suffer and
[1:42:04] arise from the dead the third day
[1:42:06] remember he read that he took the curse
[1:42:07] and he hung on a tree so that what the
[1:42:08] promise of abraham could come on us
[1:42:10] this is jesus explaining that to the
[1:42:12] disciples now he says but that
[1:42:14] repentance and remission of sins
[1:42:16] should be preached in his name among all
[1:42:18] nations beginning at
[1:42:19] jerusalem so he's given them a place
[1:42:23] but he hasn't given them a time just yet
[1:42:26] right so he's told them what they're
[1:42:27] supposed to do they're supposed to
[1:42:28] preach repentance and remission of sins
[1:42:30] in jerusalem so he's told them what
[1:42:32] they're going to do but they can't do it
[1:42:34] he says you can't do it yet because the
[1:42:36] next one says and ye are witnesses of
[1:42:38] these things so he says you're going to
[1:42:39] be a part of it
[1:42:40] but behold i send the promise of my
[1:42:43] father upon you
[1:42:44] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:42:47] until you be endued with power from on
[1:42:48] high
[1:42:49] amen place jerusalem time sometime in
[1:42:52] the near future
[1:42:53] what does he say wait wait there until
[1:42:56] you have power to do what i've told you
[1:42:57] you're going to do
[1:42:59] you can't jump ahead of the word right
[1:43:01] you can't presume
[1:43:02] right what did brother brown say to
[1:43:04] presume was to venture without authority
[1:43:06] you can't presume you have it he says
[1:43:08] wait until you're endued with power
[1:43:10] you'll know when you get it and when you
[1:43:11] get power then do these things
[1:43:14] then we read in acts chapter one it says
[1:43:16] the former treaties have i made out
[1:43:18] theophilus of all that jesus both began
[1:43:20] both to do and teach
[1:43:22] until the day in which he was taken up
[1:43:24] after that he through the holy ghost had
[1:43:25] given commandments unto the apostles
[1:43:27] whom he had chosen
[1:43:28] to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:43:30] after his passion
[1:43:32] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[1:43:34] them 40 days
[1:43:35] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[1:43:36] the kingdom of god he's preparing them
[1:43:39] let me put it this way he brought them a
[1:43:40] message
[1:43:42] of what was going to come up to that
[1:43:45] point he really hadn't dwelt too much on
[1:43:46] it
[1:43:47] it was more about him and what he had to
[1:43:48] do but now he says look i'm leaving and
[1:43:50] you've got a purpose and there's a plan
[1:43:52] and there's things that you've got to do
[1:43:54] but you've got to get
[1:43:55] endued with power from on high he gives
[1:43:57] them a message we had a prophet come and
[1:43:59] he gives us this huge message
[1:44:00] that says tremendous things about a
[1:44:02] bride in power and demonstration of the
[1:44:04] spirit that's living the very life of
[1:44:06] christ that is a witness to the entire
[1:44:08] world
[1:44:09] but he says you've got to be endued with
[1:44:11] power on high before you can do this
[1:44:14] and being assembled together with them
[1:44:15] commanded them that they should not
[1:44:17] depart from jerusalem
[1:44:18] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:44:20] which saith he
[1:44:22] ye have heard of me so he says don't
[1:44:24] leave jerusalem
[1:44:26] stay there until you get it and don't go
[1:44:28] anywhere else don't go to bethlehem
[1:44:29] because that's where the original birth
[1:44:31] of christ was
[1:44:32] stay in jerusalem because that's where
[1:44:33] i've told you to do it so they couldn't
[1:44:34] go to any other city
[1:44:35] they couldn't pick a place that was
[1:44:37] maybe had a nicer climate while they
[1:44:39] waited
[1:44:39] maybe less persecution less chance of
[1:44:42] being found out they had to stay in
[1:44:43] jerusalem
[1:44:44] verse 5 says for john truly baptized
[1:44:46] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[1:44:49] the holy spirit not many days hence
[1:44:51] so your time is not many days hence it's
[1:44:53] not specific
[1:44:55] but it's there he says stay there until
[1:44:57] you get it it's not going to be too long
[1:44:59] when they therefore were come together
[1:45:00] they asked of him saying lord wilt thou
[1:45:02] at this time restore again the kingdom
[1:45:03] to israel
[1:45:05] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:45:06] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:45:08] the father hath put in his own power
[1:45:10] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:45:12] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:45:14] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:45:16] in jerusalem in all jewish judea and in
[1:45:19] samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:45:20] the earth
[1:45:22] so he says you're going to spread out
[1:45:23] from here but this birth has to happen
[1:45:24] this baptism of the holy spirit has to
[1:45:26] happen
[1:45:27] in one place so we've got a time and a
[1:45:30] place
[1:45:31] then we're followed after that
[1:45:32] sanctification
[1:45:35] and they returned and returned they
[1:45:36] under jerusalem from the mount called
[1:45:38] all of it which was from jerusalem a
[1:45:39] sabbath state journey
[1:45:41] and when they were come in they went up
[1:45:43] into an upper room
[1:45:45] they went up there and they stayed there
[1:45:48] they were separated from
[1:45:49] the world amen it was a group of
[1:45:51] believers and believers only in that
[1:45:53] room 120 believers
[1:45:55] sitting there in what obedience to the
[1:45:57] word amen
[1:45:58] and thereabold peter and james and john
[1:46:01] and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew
[1:46:03] matthew james the son of alphaeus
[1:46:05] and simon zelodes and judas the brother
[1:46:07] of james
[1:46:08] these all continue with one accord in
[1:46:10] prayer and supplication
[1:46:12] with the women and mary the mother of
[1:46:14] jesus and with his brethren
[1:46:16] so they weren't in there playing games
[1:46:18] you know some some light scrabble
[1:46:21] what were they doing prayer and
[1:46:22] supplication they were calling on god
[1:46:25] and waiting for him
[1:46:26] to answer what he had promised through
[1:46:28] his word amen
[1:46:31] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:46:33] come they were all with one accord
[1:46:36] and in one place now what's the next
[1:46:39] thing that's supposed to happen
[1:46:40] the word is supposed to lead the way
[1:46:43] right
[1:46:44] you go to a place you've got a time you
[1:46:46] sanctify yourself and then you're
[1:46:47] supposed to put the word first
[1:46:48] now we say they did put the word first
[1:46:51] but i want to make a another correction
[1:46:54] another correction when we talked about
[1:46:56] them replacing
[1:46:57] uh judas remember with matthias now i
[1:47:00] said they were filled with the spirit
[1:47:02] i need to read my bible in chronological
[1:47:04] order sometimes amen
[1:47:06] that happened in acts 1 before
[1:47:09] the holy spirit fell right while they
[1:47:12] were in the upper room but before the
[1:47:13] holy spirit came in there peter decides
[1:47:15] to use this time to make some changes
[1:47:18] amen the holy spirit hasn't been given
[1:47:20] yet peter's up there and he says look we
[1:47:22] need another one
[1:47:23] we lost one we need to add one to it and
[1:47:25] so they they drew lots and mathias was
[1:47:28] the one that was chosen but what
[1:47:29] happened
[1:47:29] the word didn't lead them we see what
[1:47:32] happens when the word doesn't lead is
[1:47:33] they picked a man that god didn't pick
[1:47:35] if they would have waited until after
[1:47:37] that the holy spirit would have checked
[1:47:38] them and said don't you do it
[1:47:40] i've got a man picked out for this job
[1:47:41] but we see what happens they did obey
[1:47:43] the word they stayed there till they
[1:47:44] were due with power but i just want you
[1:47:46] to catch what happens when you don't
[1:47:47] lead with the word
[1:47:48] and you presume and you step out peter's
[1:47:50] saying hey we're the disciples we're the
[1:47:52] chosen one he says
[1:47:53] chosen ones he said we're going to do
[1:47:55] this and we're going to do that so let's
[1:47:57] do something
[1:47:58] and he wasn't in the will of god and
[1:47:59] neither were the rest of them and they
[1:48:00] all went along with it why
[1:48:02] they didn't have the holy spirit leading
[1:48:03] and guiding them because we'll see later
[1:48:05] that peter he's fully led by the holy
[1:48:07] spirit
[1:48:07] right and he moves and he speaks and he
[1:48:09] goes here and he does this and he goes
[1:48:10] that
[1:48:10] but they choose outside of it what is it
[1:48:12] the word has to go first the word always
[1:48:14] has to go first you have to you can't
[1:48:17] presume you've got to be standing
[1:48:18] clearly on the word of god amen
[1:48:20] but they stayed there and they tarried
[1:48:22] and that's what god took that's what
[1:48:23] jesus had told them to do
[1:48:24] he said terry till you're in dude with
[1:48:25] power on high acts 2 verse 2 says and
[1:48:28] suddenly
[1:48:29] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[1:48:31] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[1:48:32] the house
[1:48:33] where they were sitting and there
[1:48:35] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:48:37] as of fire
[1:48:38] and it sat upon each of them and they
[1:48:40] were all
[1:48:41] filled with the holy ghost and they
[1:48:43] began and began to speak with other
[1:48:44] tongues
[1:48:45] as the spirit gave them utterance other
[1:48:48] tongues means other languages
[1:48:50] not unknown languages as in that nobody
[1:48:52] understood but it says with other
[1:48:54] languages amen now this is supernatural
[1:48:57] in and of itself because they don't know
[1:48:58] any other languages
[1:49:00] they're galileans and you know very
[1:49:02] rough
[1:49:03] in general nature you know these are not
[1:49:05] educated men
[1:49:06] at all and so for them to speak with
[1:49:08] another language is something different
[1:49:10] but this isn't just
[1:49:11] emotion i mean this isn't you know a
[1:49:13] laughing revival or some
[1:49:15] expression of something within them this
[1:49:17] is this is a first time event amen and
[1:49:19] it's a supernatural event
[1:49:21] and that's what we're looking for
[1:49:22] because that's what happened is after
[1:49:23] the word goes forward what happens a
[1:49:25] supernatural event
[1:49:26] so they're filled with the holy spirit
[1:49:28] that's supernatural and then the effect
[1:49:29] of the supernatural
[1:49:30] is in their lives and all of a sudden
[1:49:32] they start speaking in tongues
[1:49:34] which is a different thing than the gift
[1:49:36] of tongues brother brandon preached hard
[1:49:38] against
[1:49:39] the the speaking in tongues as the
[1:49:40] initial evidence why because what the
[1:49:42] pentecostals were doing was not what
[1:49:44] happened on the day of pentecost
[1:49:46] we'll dig into that a little bit and
[1:49:48] then watch the effect of these tongues
[1:49:50] it says and they were dwelling at
[1:49:51] jerusalem jews devout men out of every
[1:49:53] nation under heaven
[1:49:54] and when this was noised abroad the
[1:49:56] multitude came together and weren't
[1:49:58] confounded
[1:49:58] because that every man heard them speak
[1:50:00] in his own language now remember in
[1:50:02] verse 4 it says they spoke with other
[1:50:03] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:50:05] utterance
[1:50:05] says they spoke in other languages as
[1:50:07] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:50:09] and now these men come there and they
[1:50:10] say hey i'm hearing them in my language
[1:50:14] and you're hearing them in your language
[1:50:15] and you're hearing them in your language
[1:50:17] what's going on and they were all amazed
[1:50:20] and marveled saying one to another
[1:50:21] behold are not all these which speak
[1:50:23] galileans
[1:50:24] and how here we every man in our own
[1:50:26] tongue wherein we were born
[1:50:28] parthians and medes and elamites and the
[1:50:30] dwellers in mesopotamia
[1:50:32] and judea and cappadocia and pontus in
[1:50:34] asia phrygia
[1:50:35] and pamphilia and in egypt and in the
[1:50:38] parts of libya about cyrene and
[1:50:40] strangers of rome jews and proselytes
[1:50:42] cretes and arabians we do hear them
[1:50:44] speak in our tongues the wonderful works
[1:50:46] of god
[1:50:47] and they were all amazed and were in
[1:50:48] doubt saying one to another
[1:50:50] what's mean this what means this
[1:50:53] now i'm not going to say this is the the
[1:50:55] evidence of the holy spirit because it's
[1:50:57] not
[1:50:57] but it is an evidence that's way
[1:50:59] different than speaking in tongues
[1:51:00] because watch what happens
[1:51:02] is that it's not speaking in an unknown
[1:51:03] language to others it's speaking in a
[1:51:05] language that you yourself do not know
[1:51:07] and understand
[1:51:08] and when you do it it's unintelligible
[1:51:10] to you but it makes perfect sense to the
[1:51:11] person staying next to you that knows
[1:51:13] that language
[1:51:13] remember brother brown there was in one
[1:51:15] of his services where somebody stood up
[1:51:16] and they prophesied in french i believe
[1:51:18] right that was the holy spirit because
[1:51:20] they didn't know french
[1:51:22] that person that spoke did not know
[1:51:23] fringe and there was i believe a
[1:51:24] translator from the u.n there and he
[1:51:26] he he checked the translation the
[1:51:28] interpretation that was given
[1:51:30] and he says it was perfect that was the
[1:51:32] holy spirit
[1:51:34] this is not just speaking in unintellig
[1:51:35] you know something completely
[1:51:37] unintelligible that's what paul had a
[1:51:38] problem with he says a stranger comes in
[1:51:39] you're all
[1:51:40] and nobody knows what's going on until
[1:51:42] you give an interpretation this was not
[1:51:44] needed here there was no interpreter
[1:51:45] needed when the holy spirit dropped the
[1:51:47] first time amen
[1:51:48] every person around heard what they were
[1:51:50] speaking
[1:51:51] in their own language so they're
[1:51:54] speaking
[1:51:55] and everyone understands not just one
[1:51:57] person
[1:51:58] everyone i counted i think 15 different
[1:52:01] countries or cities or tongues
[1:52:03] listed there and every single one of
[1:52:04] them understood what was being said
[1:52:06] but here's the second thing it was not
[1:52:08] just gibberish
[1:52:10] it was not just highly repetitive this
[1:52:11] or that the other thing it had a purpose
[1:52:13] and what was it it said the wonderful
[1:52:15] works of god
[1:52:16] is what they were talking about they
[1:52:18] were saying this is what's happening
[1:52:19] right here right now
[1:52:20] and they were praising the lord about
[1:52:22] what had just happened to them
[1:52:23] and the experience they were happy they
[1:52:25] were having they were sharing it with
[1:52:27] everyone about them and saying
[1:52:28] something's going on here and they were
[1:52:29] telling about what it was
[1:52:31] and they were saying this is jesus told
[1:52:32] us about this and this is what he did
[1:52:34] and this is who he was and peter
[1:52:35] continues on and on and on until they
[1:52:36] save 3000 people right
[1:52:39] what is it when the holy spirit drops
[1:52:41] down it touches every heart
[1:52:43] it touches every life that's there to
[1:52:44] listen amen you don't need an
[1:52:46] interpreter in that sense right it comes
[1:52:48] down and it opens up the ears it unlocks
[1:52:50] each one of you
[1:52:50] so you can you can get what you need out
[1:52:52] of the word amen
[1:52:54] it was a supernatural confirmation that
[1:52:56] god was with them and nobody there
[1:52:58] i guarantee you those galileans knew i
[1:53:00] don't know
[1:53:02] you know phrygian you know no
[1:53:05] they don't know anything but yet
[1:53:06] everybody's understanding there's a
[1:53:08] there's a
[1:53:08] you talk about unity you talk about
[1:53:10] world peace when that dropped down
[1:53:12] everybody understood what was happening
[1:53:14] as in they understood the words they
[1:53:15] understand the what they were talking
[1:53:17] about amen
[1:53:18] and 3 000 people repented and got
[1:53:20] baptized that day
[1:53:21] one day with peter
[1:53:24] peter not exactly known for his great
[1:53:27] speaking ability
[1:53:28] you know for his tact he said you guys
[1:53:31] killed the prince of glory
[1:53:32] you know he just piled it on them three
[1:53:34] thousand people three thousand people
[1:53:36] came to the church that day amen
[1:53:38] what was it wow how the holy spirit
[1:53:40] speaking to them in a language they
[1:53:41] could understand
[1:53:44] peter speaks and everybody understands
[1:53:46] you tell me how
[1:53:47] peter isn't going through 15 translators
[1:53:49] he's speaking and everybody understands
[1:53:51] and everybody accepts it
[1:53:53] amen that hears it amen that's the
[1:53:55] supernatural event not just the coming
[1:53:57] down but what a way
[1:53:58] for others to go through you had a group
[1:54:00] that went ahead
[1:54:01] that obeyed the word and then they stood
[1:54:03] there and everybody else passed through
[1:54:05] and then the scripture says he added
[1:54:06] under the church daily such as such as
[1:54:09] were
[1:54:09] ordained i guess but then after the
[1:54:12] everybody's across what happens
[1:54:13] the waters cross behind amen it says and
[1:54:16] they that gladly received the word were
[1:54:18] baptized
[1:54:19] and the same day they were added unto
[1:54:20] them about three thousand souls
[1:54:22] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:54:24] apostles doctrine and fellowship
[1:54:26] and in breaking of bread and in prayers
[1:54:29] and fear came upon every soul
[1:54:30] and many wonders and signs were done by
[1:54:32] the apostles
[1:54:33] and all that believe were together and
[1:54:35] had all things coming
[1:54:37] remember we talked about the 12 stones
[1:54:39] you've got 11 right there
[1:54:41] there's a 12th one coming amen
[1:54:44] what a commemoration god's still with us
[1:54:47] he didn't just do it once
[1:54:49] he's doing it again and again and again
[1:54:51] in me and you
[1:54:52] and me and you and you and you and you
[1:54:54] and you and you
[1:54:55] what showing them reality of a living
[1:54:57] god amongst them
[1:54:59] and they sold their possessions and
[1:55:00] goods imparted them
[1:55:03] to all men as every man had need they're
[1:55:06] going into a promised land
[1:55:08] well they do everybody's got a portion
[1:55:11] you need some of what i've got i'll give
[1:55:12] it to you
[1:55:13] what is it everybody's needs are going
[1:55:14] to be met over there we're not going to
[1:55:16] have one that has everything and one
[1:55:17] that has nothing
[1:55:18] and then everybody's going to have what
[1:55:19] they need in the promised land and they
[1:55:21] continuing daily with one accord in the
[1:55:23] temple
[1:55:24] and breaking bread from house to house
[1:55:26] to eat their meat with gladness
[1:55:28] and singleness of heart praising god and
[1:55:30] having favor with all the people
[1:55:32] and the lord added to the church daily
[1:55:34] such
[1:55:35] that should be saved what happened they
[1:55:37] were dead to their old way of living
[1:55:39] it says they sold everything pulled
[1:55:41] their money pooled their resources and
[1:55:42] they just went from place to place to
[1:55:44] place
[1:55:44] each one hosting they get together and
[1:55:46] they fellowship and pray and they'd be
[1:55:47] in the temple and they'd be teaching
[1:55:49] what was it it was a new way of life a
[1:55:50] new way of provision
[1:55:52] remember the man is gone now now there's
[1:55:54] another way of living
[1:55:55] amen and it's with a body united under
[1:55:57] the word moving forward
[1:55:59] into full possession amen let's stand
