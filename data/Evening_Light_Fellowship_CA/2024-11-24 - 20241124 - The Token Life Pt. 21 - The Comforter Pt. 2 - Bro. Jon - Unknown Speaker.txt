pray grant us your grace we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 14 John chapter 14 amen want to welcome brother Vel back he survived amen he wasn't lynched in India for his beliefs though he came close I hear amen we're good to it's good to see you brother good to have our visitors here as well God bless you amen want to also welcome or wish my wife a happy birthday amen I'm very blessed God has granted me a wonderful wife and a mother for our children and we certainly appreciate what he's done for her amen remember her and the boys as they'll be traveling this week to California for two weeks and then sister Priscilla is traveling this week also I believe as well so we want to remember her as she goes as well remember my eye it's still very much bothering me the swelling's down a bit this morning but the infection is still there so I'm struggling to see out of that left eye but uh we'll trust the Lord to get us through this morning if I have to do this then we'll do this so amen God bless you John chapter 14 Jesus speaking here says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning amen we're continuing our series we've been preaching on the Holy Ghost called the token life and I want to take a second thought on the comforter this morning and on Wednesday we started this little thought on the comforter and we talked about how a comforter is needed in the times of hardship he's needed in the times of trial of pain and suffering amen we don't need a comforter when the days are sunny when there's money in the bank when our health is good when our relationships are good when church is great when everything's going our way that's not when we need a comforter we need a comforter for when things are difficult amen and that's why the comforter came was to bring them through a difficult time and we told how Jesus said that the to the disciples he says hard times are coming hard times are coming it's going to seem like everything's Fallen apart like everything you believe for everything you trusted in has gone a different way amen but that Spirit of Truth in Christ had to tell them the full picture amen we'll find that in the word that God doesn't just tell us all of the good things tells us the hard things as well but he says I'll take you through those from start to finish amen amen so God doesn't hold back from us God doesn't hold back from us God lets us know hey things are coming your way you're going to deal with persecutions you're going to deal with hardships you're going to deal with trials amen the spirit of Christ in you is against what the world has and so they're trying to destroy what it is that you have in you and they're trying to pull you away from those things amen but we're meant to produce the word that's what we're meant to do is produce the word in our age and our season and that means that everything in this world is against us and it's not against us as people it's against the word that's living within us amen don't take it personally when you get judged when people say things about you when things go a certain way because of the way you live or the way you dress or the way you speak the the Christian Life that we have because the world is trying to beat that out of us amen it's trying to destroy us it's trying to make us bow down to it rather than us as the three Hebrew children stand up and say it doesn't matter what you do we will not bow amen it'll take us and we see what this world is trying to do it's trying to beat down our mind and and get us into a place of Mind Games where we can think a thought that's contrary to the word of God like Satan did with Eve in the beginning to just get that one thought that's contrary and in that they drive a wedge between us and the word and they got a place now that they can start to work with us tries to beat us down in our bodies with stress and work doesn't it it the world is we talked about this before that it's making us build bricks without straw and it all seems like everything that we do is focused on trying to make a living and so circumstances rise up and stress draws us away from the things of God and we've got to push back against that and say he is Jehovah Gyra he's my provider I can't be all on me I'm going to trust him and I'm going to do what is meant for the kingdom of God Amen it tries to take away our work life balance so that we give up the things of God so that we can have the things that are needful to us but Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God seek ye first what he has for you and then he'll add all all of these things to you amen that's a promise that we have that's one thing I love about the word is that when you go through hard times you have a promise that is waiting for you that is at the end of it all amen but we have to go through those things we need the comforter and he's there to lead us he's there to guide us he's there to remind us and teach us by the word of God what it takes to go through life amen the Holy Ghost is what make the is what makes that word live remember what Jesus said he said my words they are spirit and they are life amen it's not just words written on the pages of a book but the the word is the very essence the very nature the very life of God and it's meant to come and live in human flesh today amen but I want to take another angle on what we preached on Wednesday on the comforter because we know we can find comfort in many things and we spoke even a little bit on this on Wednesday how we can rest in our finances if we have a lot of money in the bank we can rest in our job and our degree or our skill if we have a lot of those things amen we can rest in our health and our strength but there's coming a day where that's going to fade away in some form or fashion I think we can all say we've gone through financial difficulties at times we've gone through health issues I mean I told the brothers I said I'm never preaching on the comforter again because as soon as I preach it I get sick but guess what here I am again today preaching on the comforter why cuz he's a comfort in a time of trial he's a comfort in a time of difficulty and one thing's for sure I'm not going to let the the trials of this life keep me from doing what God has called me to do even if it can only see out of one eye the Lord gives the Lord takes away I'm going to stand in my post and in my duty and in my position amen but I believe I'm speaking to Believers here today and we ought to know where we find our comfort but the problem is sometimes in our spirituality we can put our comfort in things that are of God but yet they are not God Amen if we can get into that a little bit this morning amen I want to focus there in this service because what we can end up is we can focus on the things he gives rather than the things he is if I could put it that way and I've been reading a lot in the Book of John in this study on the Holy Ghost because as I've said before John has a very deep understanding of of the reality and the revelation of Jesus Christ because he didn't start with Jesus in a manger John took us all the way back to in the beginning was the word and he showed us Christ from the beginning he showed us the first creative act of God he showed us the pillar of fire The Dwelling Place of God and then he brought it all the way to 2,000 years and he said that word was made flesh and dwelt among yes amen but the thing is so often the problem is that we can see Christ from Genesis to Revelation but if we can see him then we ought to be able to see ourselves because we were in him in the beginning amen if he he was there then we ought to see ourselves there amen because you can't be a part of him today if you weren't a part of him back in the beginning amen Eve came out of Adam the bride comes out of Christ we are not something that is new or created but we are something that is drawn out of the very essence and personality in the the nature of God Amen so we're not saved this morning by Creed or by baptism or by Church affiliation or by Doctrine amen but we're saved by the receiving of the eternal life that we had in him before the foundation of the world water baptism doesn't save me the church doctrine doesn't save me amen but when I receive eternal life it makes me a new creation it changes me into what I was in him before the foundation of the world Amen our first birth was in sin we come to the world in sin shaped in iniquity the scripture says but it's by the Regeneration of this life that we receive the Holy Spirit and we receive the new birth amen we surrender our bodies we submit it to the word of God by the holy spirit amen and that is the new birth amen we're saved by receiving New Life by eternal life of the Holy Spirit we are not saved by what we're gathered here doing today amen otherwise what we're doing is we're washing an old life amen rather than being born again into new life that old man has died Paul said it's supposed to be dead so we don't want to be washing an old life with the word amen we want to have a new life by the holy spirit amen but remember what we said last service in the scriptures in John 16 Jesus speaking about the Holy Ghost coming and he says these things have I spoken unto you that what in me ye might have peace in the world he says in the world sorry in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world so our peace is not in in the circumstances amen good or bad there's tribulation there the wages of sin is death everything that this world is producing is death to us but our peace is in Christ Our rest is in Christ our joy is in Christ Our satisfying portion is in Christ everything we have need of is in Christ this morning and he says it's in me you're going to find peace even while you're in Tribulation in the midst of this world listen to this quote he says it doesn't lay in the individual I read this a couple Services ago it doesn't lay in you it doesn't lay in me I don't care how good a Christian we are this morning he says it lays in God it doesn't lay within you today it lays within God that's in you the faith that you have in God it doesn't lay within me today it lays within God so if God has raised from the dead and all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church he says I'll be with you he says I've tried across the world to Proclaim that Jesus Christ lives he is not dead he's just as real today as he was in the days he walked in Galilee but the unbelieving world has condemned it because they're carnal and can't understand the spiritual things because he said they wouldn't then he quotes scripture a little while in the world sees me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you and if he is in here and with us then it's God and not us the faith that you have in him is God the works that he would do here with him would be him and not us amen so I said that our comfort it can be in so many things and the more spiritually minded we get sometimes the more we misplace our Comforts because Satan's trying to get us to rest on anything but the sure foundation and so he'll focus our attentions on different things and we can Garner comfort from things that I'm not saying they're not of God and they're not good because they very well well may be but we have to be careful where our resting place is and where we are truly in our comfort amen when Jesus came to the River Jordan and he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was at that moment the fullness of God in flesh he was God incarnate all that God was was in Christ amen that was in a perfect body spoken into existence by the Holy Spirit Mary had nothing to do with it she was not his mother she was just an incubator Jesus never called her mother he called her woman there was nothing of Mary in Jesus Mary had to go into the upper room on the day of Pentecost and get the Holy Ghost just like the rest of us she has no capabilities she has no intercessory Powers she is the same as you and I amen she needed the Holy Ghost she needed a new birth just as you and I were amen but remember when Christ came and died the purpose of that was not just to restore relationship to God that was part and parcel of it but the purpose of God is to restore us back to our eating condition to where we are in full relationship with God and we have full Dominion on the earth God's looking back for a a return to the family of God in the place that God built for us amen so Christ had to die for our sins and yes that was to open the door back to the presence of God but we can see that there were many great things that God gave before Christ ever died we can see great Ministries we can see great gifts we can see men and women with wonderful works and signs and wonders and Power in their life we can look at Samson who did great Feats of Strength we can look at Moses who parted the sea that touched things and they split open that spoke the word whatever it was we saw these great gifts we see that David could have great victories we could have Joshua who could command the Sun and the Moon to stand still all these wonderful things and even in Jesus day we see that his disciples had great works and great Ministries even before he died at Calvary even before the Holy Ghost was given and I want to spend some time there this morning to talk about this because he says in Matthew 10 and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of dis of sickness and all manner of disease jumping to verse 7 he says as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so he gave them power he gave them Authority he gave them signs and wonders and he gave them the word amen he gave them all of those things and here's his his commission he says heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely ye have received freely give we don't charge money for the gospel I was watching a a minister in Nairobi or in in um Nigeria and he was saying I want you to give a thousand naira for every year that you've had in your life on this Earth what is that have to do with the gospel Jesus said freely you have received freely give if somebody wants something that we have that God has given us then we give it to them freely no charge amen that's just what we do that's our Christian obligation is to share as we he has shared and to give as he has given with us amen we do not ever charge anybody people can come in and they can hear the gospel for free they can come for pastoral counseling for free we can go help them move their house for free it matters not we're here to serve he gives us strength he gives us gifts he gives us Ministries to serve amen that's the purpose of these things but I want to stop and dwell on this for a second here because we're talking about the comforter today and we have to be careful where we put that Comfort because if our comfort is not in the person of the word rather than in the gifts of the word then we're going to get into trouble very quickly in this scripture Jesus sends out how many disciples 12 now if you look in the original 12 that means that Judas was a part of this group Judas was the tra betrayer of Jesus Jesus or Judas is listed as the son of ption Jes Judas it says that Satan indwelt him on the night of the LA of the Passover Judas was for a Time the dwelling place of Satan on this Earth and yet Judas Ministry included signs and wonders and healing and casting out demons and raising the dead that that that blows our mind I think because you say how can that be and yet the scripture clearly says that that's the way it it was stop and consider the great Ministries that went out from under Jesus amen if we went out through all of Newan land now if Jesus was here and he commissioned us to do that and he sent all the brothers out to do do that what would happen there'd be this great uproar throughout New Finland and we would have to buy or build another church because thousands would come in to see these great Ministries and to be with these Great Men that's what would happen and we see that that's what happened with Jesus is that he had thousands upon thousands of people around him amen and they were there for the signs and wonders and yes for a while they were even there for his ministry of the word but look at the men that were there those 11 men we would say they were real Believers Judas was a traitor Judas was a son of predition but these were the other 11 were real sons of God Amen they were real men of the ministry amen and they were doing the very works that Jesus was doing and by that I mean they were doing signs and wonders they were doing healing they were casting out demons they were raising the dead but we look at what Jesus uh conversation with Peter and his description with Peter not too long after this and Peter had a great ministry he had great Passion he had great Authority amongst the disciples but this is what Jesus says about him while he has done these things he says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren so Peter has this wonderful Ministry with the rest of the disciples amen and Peter wasn't even converted Peter had not received the kingdom of God Peter had not received the Holy Ghost amen Peter was preaching the kingdom of God is coming and he had signs and wonders following him today we'd say coming it's here the the kingdom of God is here look at this this sister got healed that brother was raised from the dead this one's been delivered from a demon what do you mean the kingdom of God is coming the kingdom of God is here but Jesus said go say it's coming but if you're following the signs and wonders then you'd say it's already here but that's not the proof of it amen these were temporary fixes people that were healed got sick again people that were raised from the dead they died again maybe people that got delivered from demon possession went back and got it again because it came back a while later and found it all cleaned up but not filled with something else that's what the scripture says and they went right back to their original condition it was a temporary fix amen it didn't last so it could not be the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God has no End Amen but Jesus said you're not converted the Kingdom of Heaven is not here he told Nicodemus he said the kingdom he says except a man be born again he cannot see he cannot understand the kingdom of God because it is not something that is seen physically but rather it is a personal experience that changes your life that is what the kingdom of God is remember what Jesus said in Luke 17 it says and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come see they thought it was going to be the return of Israel and and the freeing of them from their captors and their bondage and these different things it says he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words you cannot see the kingdom of God when it arrives you cannot see it coming you cannot go to a place it's not like other kingdoms it's not a physical Kingdom when it comes it's a spiritual Kingdom he says neither shall they say Lo here or low there so it won't be a place you can go hear me this morning it won't be a church you can go to it won't be a denomination it won't be a Creed it won't be a country it won't be a community that is not the way the kingdom of God works amen you can't send someone there rather they have to become a part of it amen they have to be joined to it he says for what behold the kingdom of God is within you amen remember now that Jesus chose the 12 disciples and Judas was one of them and yet God and yet he gave Judas a Ministry with tremendous signs of wonders we preached on this before I won't Bel it this morning but what was it they had an anointing on them but they did not have the Holy Spirit in them amen they weren't in the kingdom of God but they were under the influence of the kingdom of God but they weren't a part of it amen let's take it a step further further the scripture says out of the mouth there two or three Witnesses let a thing be established so let's take our second witness out of the scriptures and in Luke 10 it says and and and these things after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also there's 70 more disciples now remember he chose the first 12 but the 70 chose him he did not choose them they chose him there's a very big difference amen he never held back this Authority from them under their sincerity and under their commitment to him he gave them the same as he gave the other 12 disciples it says and he sent them two and two before his face into every city and place with he himself would come he sent them for him with a Ministry of signs and wonders in verse 9 says he told them heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you come nigh in other words it's nearly here but this is not it this is not it but he gave them the same signs wonders the same power the same Authority he gave them the same Ministry of the Gospel that he gave the the 12 that he chose there was no difference in their Ministry or their Authority at this point and watch the result verse 17 it says and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name they got the same results that the 12 that were chosen did but watches Jesus response now he says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and they did a Jericho March when he said it they started running they started shouting they said this is just the start of a great thing it's going to be amazing nothing's going to harm us nothing's going to touch us we have all power and all authority surely this is the promise that we're waiting for and Jesus says verse 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not in other words don't get all happy about this he says that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight so Jesus is saying don't stop here don't rest here don't let this be your satisfying portion these signs and wonders that that you have power and author over demons that you're casting out sicknesses and and disease that you're raising the dead don't stop here don't let this be your comfort don't let this be your your anchor your your foundation amen these things are all part of the kingdom of God but they are not the kingdom of God this is not what I came to do in other words he's saying don't let your ministerial performance or don't let your gifts be your resting place amen we preached on this before and I mentioned it already that you can have an anointing on you every day of your life and go to hell absolutely you can amen you can be anointed by the Holy Spirit on your flesh but until your soul is sealed and there's a change of you you can still go to hell because an anointing on you is not the new birth it's just an anointing on you and if it's on you it can go off you but if it's in you and it's sealed it can never leave you and that's what eternal life is is the presence of God in you forever amen you can do all these things and not even be converted that's what we read earlier listen to this it says the Bible said in the last days there be false prophets Jesus said there shall rise false christs not false jesuses now cuz nobody would stand still for that but false Christ Christ means the anointed one falsely anointed they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it so in other words their heart their soul condition is false and though they appear to be the real deal they have not had the Regeneration of the New Birth by the holy spirit amen and it takes time for it all to come out cuz by your fruits you'll know them but for a while they are the same as everybody else it looks like he says they are false at the bottom of it they do great signs and wonders they speak in tongues they dance in the spirit and they preach the gospel now watch this he says Judas a scariot did it Caiaphas prophesied balum the hypocrite remember Judas betrayed Jesus Caiaphas judged Christ and sent him to his death balum s reduced Israel into idol worship and yet all of them had signs and wonders and prophecies and and the evidence of the anointing of God in their lives he says sure they did all the signs everything all the religious moves but if you put a cockle bur a uh that's a like a thorn seed and a wheat seed in the same bed and pour the water upon them and anoint them they'll both Rejoice they'll both grow by it by the same water The Sun Shines on the just and the unjust and the rain falls on the just and the unjust but by their fruits ye shall know them the same thing that grows if you if you like to grow vegetables or fruits or or or flowers and you have your flower beds you'll notice that no matter what you do there's always going to be plants in there that you don't want why because the sunshine and the rain produce life no matter what but what it does is it produces life that shows exactly what each plant is and so you might start with a bunch of green things but as they grow and mature you realize some of these are what I planted and some of these are what nature put in there and I've got to weed those things out amen he says how can you keep from lining up with the word amen see what I mean the water falls on the just and the unjust they're anointed Jesus said they'll come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have I not cast out Devils have I not prophesied have I not done great things in your name and he'll say ye work workers of iniquity depart from me I don't even know you go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the devil and his angels He says you see what a word they are falsely anointed they worship in vain they're striving in vain he says why do you do that when you don't have to do it why take a substitute when the heavens are full of genuine you don't have to do it amen I I saw a a video clip of a young woman that's that's doing a 40 days of of praying in the spirit for 30 minutes a day and you know what she's doing she's walking up and down pretending she's talking in tongues why would you pretend what's the point of pretending you know you're doing it who are you fooling you're not fooling God you're not fooling yourself why not wait there until he gives you tongues if you want to speak in tongues but why walk up and down when it's completely obvious that you're just repeating the same thing over and over and over again it's not God working but what is it we don't want to wait we don't want to wait I'm here this is my time this is what I've given over this is when it needs to happen and so instead of waiting on God to do what the word says we try and produce it in ourselves and every time it produces what death that's all I can produce that's all you can produce is death it has to be God that does these things amen so if we look at signs and wonders and and gifts and these things as the comforter we'll see where we're left eventually and it's where those 70 disciples were left and we can see what Jesus says about them in the scripture in John 6 he says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life I mean their focus was on the ministry and on the gifts and he says the words are where you need to be focused the words is where your rest needs to be we we've spoken on this much and I again I don't want to belabor but Jesus had preached that you must eat his flesh and drink his blood and he never explained it but he said unless you do it you won't have eternal life he wasn't talking about eating his literal body or drinking his literal blood he was saying you've got to take all of the word you've got to go all the way with the word but he never explained it amen but what it caused a lot of issues because it was a new doctrine they had never heard it before and they couldn't get past it and why couldn't they get past this church it says verse 64 but there are some of you that believe not they have performed great signs and wonders and yet Jesus said you don't believe what did they not believe the word that's where they stopped was when the word came in its fullness that's where they stopped amen he says you like the effects and you like the authority and the power of the ministry but you're resting in that instead of in the word that's coming behind it it says for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him Jesus had given them power and authority over devils and sickness and death and these different things and he knew that they would not accept his word and yet he did it and he says he knew from the beginning who there were that believed not and should who should betray him there's two groups there there's the unbelievers and then there's the betraying unbeliever and that's just one and that's Judas but they all walked away but Judas was the one that activated the Betrayal but yet Christ never held back from him in that moment amen Jesus knew they didn't fully believe the word yet he gave them power for a time and for a season it says and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of the father you cannot come to God unless God calls you we said before you can't come to God unless you were in God in the beginning we believe that we are predestinated amen and We Don't Preach predestination as God going through the church he's saying okay sister Lydia's in Sister Justine's out brother Bob's in we'll let sister Brenda go in because she's married to him and sister Morin sorry you're out but brother Mark you're in God doesn't go down the line saying in and out in and out in and out but rather before the foundation of the world Amen God had a thought and he had the attributes of himself that would be expressed in a family and because of that he wrote the names of those attributes into the Lamb's Book of Life and he said these are my children they will be with me that's what we believe predestination is it's not he didn't say those are out and those are in what he said is the ones that are in my thoughts that's my family and then what happened you see this in the parable of the swer is that what Satan came in and he sowed seed other seed Bad Seed in the world by the in the Garden of Eden and what was it it was bad seed and God did not reject them they just were not there to have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life but yet some of them will be granted eternal life based on Works they're the only ones that truly have a choice he can't lose me Jesus said he'll lose none of his he'll lose none of his but those that are out there some of them will get in by works because they've done something for the bride of Christ they've done something that he deems worthy to grant them eternal life but we aren't granted eternal life we have eternal life we see we are eternal life as we go through this today amen but we were in Christ from the start like I said as Eve was in Adam we are in Christ from the start we didn't choose him he chose us and that's what takes us through is he's already put our name in the Lamb's Book of Life amen they can't ever receive the Holy Ghost because they're not a part of him but they can be granted eternal life at the end verse 66 it says and from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him remember the 70 disciples chose Jesus and there came a time where they unch him Church my my my stability is not in my choosing of Christ this morning it's because he chose me there's something that holds me even when I can't hold there's something that anchors my soul even when I don't feel like it even when I don't seem like it at times amen why they weren't predestinated they weren't predestinated there was nothing that was in the mind of God about them before time began and that's why Jesus said Rejoice because your names are written in heaven where in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he was saying you're rejoice ing is premature cuz your names aren't there it's not bad to rejoice in the good things of God but you got to make sure that your name is in that book that's where our rejoicing is going to be amen I don't blame them for rejoicing amen but it was small Comfort at this point as they walked away and they lost all authority and all power they had nothing then said Jesus under the 12 will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life Peter was not anchored in the signs and wonders Peter was anchored in the word that was coming from Christ amen that was his satisfying portion me that was his rest that was his comfort he says and we believe and are sure that thou art Christ the son of the Living God where was the comfort those 70 disciples had that walked away now they had it and then they fell away from it and now they had to go back to what they had left what's the point in going back to what you'd left now you're stuck in Middle Ground in no man's land you can't go back to what you left you can't move forward into what you thought was right and so you stay in this Purgatory we don't believe in purgatory but what you stay is in a place where you can't go anywhere because you don't fit with anybody what a shame that ought to be amen they had it all and yet they were left without Comfort why because they took comfort in the wrong thing Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 12 he says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular that phrase members in particular means that we're each individual we're distinct in our own position and purpose with our own gifts and Ministries and that means that you don't have to be the same as me and I don't have to be the same as you and none of us has to be the same as each other but we need to be in agreement because the body works together it can't it can't fight itself amen we have to work together not against each other he says and God had said some in the church now watch the order watch what God deems most important first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles and Gifts of healings helps governments and diversities of tongues amen what is most important to God the word because the first thing he puts there the first three things are the word the word the word people that bring the word of God then after that comes the Miracles the healings the helps the governments and the diversities of tongues amen so what's he saying he's saying where's your comfort right that we are a minister that we are a deacon that we are the wife of a deacon the wife of a minister that we play the music that we lead the songs no our comfort is not in those things now because watch what he says here in verse 29 are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles we're talking about the comforter today and Paul's going through the list and he's challenging us and he's saying does everyone do something big and obvious and Supernatural in the church does everyone have a grand position does everyone have a uh something that's big and wonderful he's not asking that because the answer is yes he's saying no obviously we're not all Apostles you can we can't all be thumbs the body has different parts amen so in what he's saying is in doing them you can't have your comfort and in not doing them can't be your discomfort don't look at what you're doing as your comfort amen that's not where we rest he continues he says have all the gifts of healings gift of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret again Paul's not saying this because we do do we all heal can everyone in raise their hand and say yes i' I've laid hands on somebody I prayed for someone and they've been healed no so the answer is no then he says do all speak with tongues no you go to a Pentecostal Church they say yes you will if you have the Holy Ghost Paul says no they don't not everyone speaks with tongues they says do all interpret again some do some don't that's not where our comfort is amen it will not be our anchor in our time of trouble that I spoke with tongues or that somebody was healed under my Ministry or prayer that's not my anchor that's not my anchor it didn't hold the 70 disciples it didn't hold Judas it's not going to hold me and it's not going to hold you the signs and wonders never converted anyone the word converted them that's the only thing that did it that's the only thing that did did it listen Israel spent 40 years under the supernatural Pillar of Fire pillar of cloud their clothes didn't wear out they have food when they needed it and all but two perished in the wilderness why because they stood on the word we are more than able why because the word says we are going to inherit that's where they stood they were converted by the word not by the gifts amen the gifts and these things are meant to draw people they will never convert people Jesus said you're here for the Loaves and the fishes but would they accept his word Paul says in verse 31 but covet earnestly the best gifts why because the best gifts edify the body the most the gifts are given for service not for self he says the greater your gift the healthier the body the greater the effect that you can have there amen but gifts we know are not about performance gifts are about surrender scripture says humble thyself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up the more that you can get out of the way the more that God can use you amen that's the way it is Paul says covet earnestly the best gifts be sincere but then he says and yet show I unto you a more excellent way so in other words there's more to the Christian walk than signs and wonders and speaking in tongu then then then gifts and all these different things amen that is not our comfort our rest or our anchoring Point amen what's the most excellent way the more excellent way in Chapter 13 this is the love chapter Paul says though I speak with the tongue tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol that means a noisy gong or a clanging symbol anybody ever get a drum set for their kids at some point nobody we're too smart for that because what do they do they make a noisy gong and a clanging symbol all they want to do is make noise we have two guitars in our house we have one that's Out Of Tune and we have one that's in tune and guess which one my youngest son has the Out Of Tune one and guess which one plays the loudest the Out Of Tune one what is it because he's just doing whatever he feels to do and he'll sing his songs along with it and it's completely out ofune it is not a Joyful Noise it's a funny noise and it's endearing but it is not something we want him doing in church that's for sure why it's just a clanging symbol and Paul says here he says if I speak with all the tongues of men and angels I speak every language of man and I speak in tongues and I don't have this kind of love he says I'm just making a bunch of noise but then he elevates it he says and though I have the gift of Prophecy and under understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing how satisfied would we be this morning if thus sayith the Lord was coming through us if we could speak and things would change and I'm not saying we don't I believe we do but if we could have all faith if we knew every we knew the word from front to back all the way through we had all the revelations of the word we would sit here and our comfort would be I know it all I have it all I can do it all and God's using me in a supernatural way how satisfied would we be this morning if that was happening and Paul says if I have not charity I am nothing he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing we can do great works of sacrifice and labor but without that love it does us no good and it is has no representation before God if I can put it that way the more excellent way is love amen this is not our kind of love this is not physical or intimate love it's not familial love it's agape love the Greek GRE word Agape amen it's the love of God which is the Holy Ghost the scripture says God is love it's his very nature it's his very attribute this is a new testament word and it is only for the New Testament believer it is the Holy Ghost it is the supernatural love amen it's the love that knows no bounds it's the love that surpasses every emotion it's the love that takes us through every circumstance it's the love that overlooks fault and failure amen amen it is love that changes us it's love that perfect us and matures us it's a love that never fails the scripture says there's only one thing that never fails what is it the word of God so what is the love it is the Living Word it is the Holy Ghost living in you and I producing Christ all over again yes Christ had signs and wonders yes Christ was a prophet and he did and he did wonderful things but his identification was through the word it was always through the word and it was being led by the spirit to fulfill the word that was written about him remember we read that in in in the scriptures a while back he said Lo in the book it is written of me I come to do thy will oh God so the continuation of the works of Christ that he promised is to fulfill the word that was written about him and so we've got to fulfill the word that's written about us when Christ ultimately laid down his life where was his comfort where was his comfort was was his comfort in his ministry was it in his Perfection was it in the signs and w ERS was it in the prophecies he'd given no Christ's Comfort was in one place for thou wil not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption his comfort was in the word that was written about him that it would never leave him it would never forsake Him it would not leave him in his condition but it would take him from Death all the way back into eternal life and it would restore him and give him his kingdom and in that we were with him in that we were with him amen when he rose we rose with him because we died he took our place so we die with him and when he rose that's our promise that we have everlasting life that if we die and we pass from this this place into another yet we'll come back and we'll be picked up and taken to be within and if we are alive and remain that same spirit that dwells in Jesus Christ will Quicken this Mortal body that's our promise this morning amen that's the Comfort I have is that his word says we've received eternal life amen that his death would not be the end of him there's a lot of people going to be disappointed in the end when they're standing before a great white throne and they're trying to give their excuses as to why their reasons why they dece receive eternal life amen they'll offer their argument but watch what Jesus says and we've quoted it earlier he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of of Heaven he says but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven see it's not about doing great things it's about doing what God wants you to do and how does he let you know that by his word amen the Holy Spirit quickens us to the word great things are not our comfort being in God's will is our comfort amen because yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil no matter our situation when we're in his will we can have comfort because he said he'd be with us amen our comfort is in that word that's been quickened by the Holy Spirit he says many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works the 70 disciples did that Judas did that it makes me wonder as people are standing there watching as after the first one goes through and offers that and he says you can't come in if they'll even offer the argument because if that's where we're resting on our works we're lost that is not it we have works but that is not our resting place he says and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity what does that word iniquity mean to do what you know to not do what you know to do to refuse to do what he told you listen what did they turn down they turn down the word cu the word tells us what to do every time they turned down the word amen they didn't turn down the works they loved the works they turned down the word and so their works could never align with what God wanted them to do Jesus just days before he was crucified he's in Jerusalem and remember the lamb had to be inspected so he goes in day in and day out comes back in and he's questioned by the priesthood about his authority and his ministry and then he gives them this response and it says Jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone with the which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes what is The Headstone what is the Cornerstone Peter had already revealed it he said who do you I the son of man am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church it wasn't on Peter he wasn't the first pope it was built on the revelation of Jesus Christ and Jesus is saying here what are you rejecting you're rejecting the revelation of who I am and because of that you'll be rejected he says therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you what's the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing fruit forth the fruits thereof Israel turned it down so it went to the Gentiles and they produ the same thing that Christ produced in in Matthew 21 did they turn down the Holy Ghost did Jesus say here's the Holy Ghost receive it and they say sorry we don't want that no what did they turn down the word and the Word was what was going to lead them to the Holy Ghost see they didn't know who he was and when they turned him down they turned down his message and they could not receive What followed his message they could never receive the comforter they were sincere perhaps but they're sincerely wrong and guess what sincerely wrong doesn't get you in we can be so sincere amen but it's the word that'll test our sincerity because when it comes before us and we refuse it it means that we're not really in it for sincerity we're in it for ourselves we refuse to make a move amen what was the holding strength of the disciples after Jesus left cuz remember he's with them for about 40 days and then he ascends and he's gone and they're left with nothing and what held them for the next 10 days the same thing that held Christ the word it was the promise of Jesus he said behold I send the promise of the father upon you the comforter the Holy Ghost he says but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high remember God never ask us to do something without a purpose God's not just messing around with our lives God is doing it for a purpose amen he told them to T that means you're going to have to wait and you're going to have to wait and you're going to have to wait and you're going to have to wait until something changes he told them amen their comfort though was that the word spoken by Christ was that they would have the same life in them that he had in him so the promise is what held them amen that they'd experience the indwelling god in the same way that he did amen and then when that happened they'd be comforted because they'd see he hadn't really left but rather he had descended again and he was with them the same way he was except the Corporal body that was the Comfort amen Church realize this we've already read it Peter already had power over sickness Peter already had power over demons Peter already had power over death that was not the power that he was being ued with here Peter already had those things amen Peter didn't need power over everything else Peter needed power over Peter Peter was the failing Point here the power out there was not the failing point this flesh was the failing Point Peter needed overcoming power in the face of opposition in the face of persecution when his life was on the line Peter kept backing down Peter needed something that would take him from Fear into courage Peter needed a nature change that's what Peter was in need of Amen remember what Jesus said he says fear not I have overcome the world he wasn't talking about that he was talking about the influence of on him he had passed every Temptation he had gone through everything that we go through yet without sin and he's saying don't worry about it cuz I've got power coming that'll give you the same sort of thing it'll take you through when you don't think you can go through amen Peter needed that kind of Victory amen he needed that kind of power you'll notice after Peter's uh conversion the signs and the Wonders did not change what he did before he did after what changed Peter himself changed and his message changed cuz remember his message before was repent and the kingdom of God is coming when he comes down what is his message now the kingdom of God is here it's not there it's here it's here what Peter has become the word of his day Peter's got a message of a personal experience that the message he's received works and it has a lasting effect amen it wasn't just repentance amen but it was a message of eternal life amen that was the conversion needed into his life and it's the same thing for us it's not about having the word it's about becoming the word we need the inward Victory before we can ever hope to really have a true effect on the outside amen Peter already had a Ministry Peter already had a gift he had signs and wonders and yet he wasn't con he wasn't converted he kept backing down but after the day of Pentecost when he received the same life that Christ had after he carried after he had obeyed the word he had the same Ministry that Christ had in every single way amen listen to what they say about Peter afterwards remember Jesus said to Peter you're going to deny me you're going to going to deny me Peter tonight you think you got it you're going to deny me watch the testimony of those that he was scared of before says now when they saw the boldness see Peter was a wimp before up and down up and down in and out he' back away when things got tough when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus it was boldness it was a Ministry that was different see the change was not in his gifts the change was in Peter Peter didn't back down in this scripture they had already dragged him to prison for the night and then he stood him up in front of them and they started quizzing him and Peter refused to back down Peter said you can do whatever you want I ain't going to stop preaching I've got a commission and I'm going to keep doing it amen what was it Peter had passed from Death unto life perfect love had cast out all fear in Peter Peter didn't care what had happened to his body because he knew that if this body would be dissolved there was another one waiting for him elsewhere amen he wasn't worried about what was going to happen because what he needed to happen it happened he had his comfort he had his Assurance amen he was settled on this thing amen he didn't just have eternal life he was eternal life it was the life of God now in him he was no longer a slave to his own nature amen what was Peter's comfort Church Peter's Comfort was that the word that had been given to him had produced itself in his life he wasn't just preaching it now he was living it that was his comfort that's the comfort that we're supposed to have amen and these the the the priests and the captains and these different ones they realize now that he'd been with Jesus because remember Jesus never backed down he spoke with authority and he was fearless and Peter now has the same Ministry he has the same style he has the same nature he has the same persona he has the the the same Assurance in his words remember they said about Jesus he spoke with authority unlike the the priests Peter's got the same thing and they're like this guy doesn't know anything he isn't he's barely taught he he can barely write and look at this guy he's got more than we've got Peter received the comforter the Living Word the same Holy Spirit dwelling in him that was in Christ catch this as we start to close one day that word was made flesh that that's it that word was made flesh in the form of a man the word of God that brought Comfort was made a man here among us we could handle the word of God in our hands we could shake hands with the word of God he was the word the scripture says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that word of God was made flesh the comforter he lived here on Earth we see he was the word he acted like God he looked like God he preached like God he healed like God he was God in every manner he was God he talked like the word he looked like the word he preached like the word he was the word amen oh what a comfort it would have been to sit down by him wouldn't you have loved to have done it why I would have run to him sit down by his side when he was here on Earth I'd love to have him touch my eye this morning he can still do it but how what a comfort it would be this morning to go and say if if you'll just speak the word or you'll just lay hands on me I know it'll go away what a comfort that would be he says now one day they saw him go to Calvary they heard him saying a little while and the world seeth me no more I'm the son of man must go to Jerusalem be put into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and die how could they stand it their hearts were broken they were depressed they were all in Gloom how could they ever give him up because the word that the prophet has spoken the word that the sages and all the great holy men back to the end the beginning of the world had spoken of that word and here it was among them the greatest thing ever put in flesh and he says I'm going to leave he says but now look what a promise he made I will not leave you comfortless I will not leave you comfortless I'll pray the father and he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he'll abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth now we said this earlier he says who whom the world cannot receive because it knoweth him not it seeth him not neither does it know him the world can't receive the Holy Ghost because they're not a part of him they can't receive the word he says but you know him you know him because he's with you and he shall be in you he says there it is and how long is he going to abide forever then what is the word of God what is our comfort today it's when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power power of the Living God living in us he says and with that with the word of the Living God we stand that word is made flesh and dwelt Among Us now that same word that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us has become our flesh he says he is with you but he shall be in you he says now that same word that the prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing it did when it was made flesh because your flesh holds it hallelujah what do we see after Pentecost what do we see after that 10 days in the upper room we see Christ The Living Word in flesh again they saw and they knew that they had been with Jesus they recognized that their Ministry was the same as his it was the Living Word all over again it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what it was the same Living Word it never ended when Christ went up but rather he descended and gave gifts to men he gave his life in the form of the Holy Ghost and that's how we know we've not been forsaken that he hasn't left us without hope and comfort amen that we're just set a drift defend for ourselves what is it it's the comfort of Christ in us the hope of glory that'll be in us all the way to the end amen as we close why is it men thirst and hunger because when he was made he was made and created with a little place in him that God dwelt to comfort him and when he shook himself away from God by sin then that place is vacant and that's why he's hungering for it reaching for it and the trouble today with us Christians he's not speaking to the world now he's speaking to us is I'm afraid we're not doing all we can do to show our fallen brother that that's what's the matter with him he says that's what's the matter with juvenile delinquency is because there's been a delinquency in the church and a delinquency in the home that's made the juvenile a delinquent it's a hard thing to tell somebody everything you think you need will never satisfy you when they go buy their new car when they go on their next great vacation when they get their second and third and fourth wife or husband to say that's never going to work when they go out and they drink all weekend and they come in with a hangover on Monday morning to say that's never going to work some of you have a testimony some of you used to drink some of you used to live for the weekend you're the ones that can say that is not going to satisfy but you can say I found a satisfying portion and you can have the same thing but he says we're delinquent because we won't share with people what the answer is what does it take Church a boldness that you have received the reality of the answer it's not just a Doctrine it's not just my church it's not just my pastor it's not just the ministry it's I have the comforter I've got what you need he says that's the reason they're on the streets jumping up and down is because they're trying to find something to satisfy he said let me say this tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus there's nothing will satisfy like the coming of the power of the Holy Ghost that will change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort and eternal life amen let's stand together if we would what a place change your life change your attitudes you know what having a eye that bugs you and your eyes get red and sore by the end of the day I need an attitude changer by the end of the day you know guess what I have a comforter when life wears us down we have a comforter amen what is it it's Christ tabernacled in human flesh again know ye not ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen it's not all signs and wonders but it's there it may not be speaking in tongues and interpretation it might be there it may not be prophecy but it's there amen but rather our comfort is when he comes down with his word and he produces it in you and I that's the Comfort amen that's what our comfort is not that we've heard the word for our age it's that we've become the word for our age listen Jesus had a Ministry of three and a half years and Peter and the disciples and the other uh ones that made up the 120 they heard a lot of things and they saw a lot of things and they enjoyed a lot of things but when he left their only comfort they had was when a word came down and produced itself in them again the signs and wonders didn't hold them it was the reality of the word the reality of the message that he had preached to them amen what's our comfort it's the Holy Ghost in US preparing us to fulfill the word for our age what's the word for our age a resurrection and a Rapture amen scripture says the bride has made herself ready what has she done she's taken the word she's wrapped herself in his righteousness and she has submitted herself to his word and now she's waiting for him to take her so what's my comfort my comfort is day by day the words changing me right it's producing the scripture says she'll be a bride without spot or wrinkle she'll be separated amen she'll have the Life of Christ in her and how does he do it he does it by the word we're seeing things in the word that we have never seen before it's opening up this great Plan of Redemption this whole book is a book of redemption and it's opening up in ways that it has never opened up before why because it's got to come to pass and he shows it to us so that we can ask for it so that we can believe for it so that we can apply it and then he comes down and by the Holy Ghost he makes it live in our life amen that's the Comfort like I said before my comfort is that I'm not who I was yesterday I'm not who I was last week last month last year but I'm being changed from Glory unto glory amen into the image of Christ until one day he comes down and he says it's finished and he sweeps us away and we get to go and be with him eternally amen what a wonderful thing I'm thankful when he heals I'm thankful for when he provides amen but that's not my anchor my anchor is that he fulfills his word in my life amen God bless you let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord how thankful we are for your word this morning Lord how thankful we are that we have a promise that you'll never leave us you'll never forsake us even to the end of the world even to the End of the Age Lord how thankful we are Lord that our eyes have been opened Lord that our sins have been separated from us Lord and that your life lives within us Heavenly Father Lord I pray we take great comfort this morning Lord from your promises Lord that as we dig into the word Lord that we'd not focus on other things Lord but that we'd let those promises be on our lips and on our mind Lord that let those things be yay and amen in our lives we pray Lord let that be our very Focus Lord let it just Lord just so soak us Lord just so fill us Lord that our hearts would ache and yearn for this word to be a greater reality in our lives Heavenly Father Lord pour your spirit out in our lives as we pray Lord the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard Lord and it's you pouring yourself in more and more more and more Lord give us courage give us boldness we pray Lord there's many that need Lord this word that you've given Lord there's many that need the great comforter Lord I pray you help us to be a witness and testimony Lord of this of the saving and the changing power of Jesus Christ in flesh today Lord let us be your Witnesses and testimonies we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen my hope is in the Lord 1088 I stand in all within the presence of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the agees LI For Whom the Raging of the sea subsides The Living
