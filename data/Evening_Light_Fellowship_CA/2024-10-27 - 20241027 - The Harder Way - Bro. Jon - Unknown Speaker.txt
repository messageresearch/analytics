then you came and You' dwelt in Us by your Holy Spirit Lord God to bring us back to you Lord we're a privileged people this morning Lord no matter our color Lord our country of origin our education our family background but Lord be because we are children of God lord we are a privileged this morning Lord so we thank you this morning Lord ask you to give us a greater revelation of what it means to be a child of God Lord that as we preach the word this morning Lord that it would Elevate our eyes Lord that it would build Faith Lord that it would put it into action Lord that the things that we believe will become things that we experience by faith in our lives Lord God Lord won't you speak to your people in a special way this morning Lord touch Our Lives Lord Heal the sick Lord change circumstances change me Lord change this people this morning Lord Just Have Your Way We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning turn if you would to the First Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to see you each one good to see Nadem back with us again amen God bless you each one we want to certainly remember the different prayer requests for little Noah over there in Ontario just that God would be with him give him a recovery amen that's the hardest thing I think as a parent is when your child is suffering and you don't you can't do anything you can't do anything except wait it out and trust God Amen so I know it's been tough on brother Doug and sister Beverly as the grandparents and the only Believers the only Believers in that situation amen but we trust God to work in that situation amen certainly appreciate that special this morning sister Nikki amen God bless you amen we want to remember of course brother Bob and sister Brenda as they travel this week to go get a much need a break and then God bless you as you go and and may He just uh replenish you and refresh you while you're away amen amen First Peter chapter 1 says this blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to His abundant Mercy had begotten us again unto a lively hope a Living Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for for you Peter's trying to lift our eyes because Peter's talking to people that are dealing with real life amen I don't know if you've noticed this but the life of a Believer is hard and he's talking to people that have been persecuted and people that are struggling and people that are dealing with situations and he's saying I know things are tough but he saying look up there's more to this than what you're seeing today he says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning amen I'm taking a different direction this morning and we'll be touching on certainly some things we've been preaching about but I want to take a title this morning of the harder way amen the harder way and we open with Peter and if you just for the sake of time because I have a fair bit here this morning we didn't read it all but you see there that he's talking to the elect the elect is the bride of Christ it's the true church it's the seed of God it's the children of God and he starts out by reminding them of their position in Christ amen I think that something that we need to do day by day is when we wake up in the morning say I am a child of God Amen just to let Satan know whose side we're on and to remind ourselves of what it is that we carry within us as a child of God Amen that if we are a child of God that's been born again that we come into situations with a recognition that there's only one way that this is going to go and that's the word is going to win I'm not going to win you're not going to win but if we stay with the word the word is going to win amen and Peter's trying to start out with the Positive we see here because he knows that the challenge is so often if you can stay in the right mindset then you'll make your way through the trial a lot easier we are guaranteed to go through trials but there there's a way to go through them that gives you overcoming power regardless of how the situation goes and we're told in the book of Philippians to think on things that are good think on things that are lovely think on things that are true think on things that are just why because those are the things of God those are the things that have value to us amen and I found for myself that if I can turn my mind towards the positive of the word of God it changes my Approach and my mindset as I go through things in life amen I want you to read the listen to this quote he says you sit in church and think about everything else but God he says what are you going to do at the office tomorrow how are you going to do this that or the other he says keep your mind off of that and think on God the Bible says if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think that kind of a negative thought don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and every thought thought positive what by the word don't come up with your own thoughts take the thoughts of God Amen so often what we've God is a world that's trying to teach us to be positive Church we've got a positive word here that's supposed to produce something in our lives let's take these thoughts don't come up with your own take what the word says about your life and your situation he says you know after the resurrection of Jesus Copus and his friend were on his road down to Emmas and as he went around talking about Jesus thinking about Jesus he stepped right out of the bushes and walked with them while they were thinking on and while they were meditating he says that's the same way Jesus does today in my heart on my mind all day long let me walk with the L Lord in the light of his word with the Heavenly Dove and let me have Fellowship all day long how do you make God welcome you think on his things you think about him you think of his goodness you praise him you worship Him you put a song on your lips whatever it might be to draw him if you dwell on him he tends to draw near is what he's making and you know I I I can speak to my own life this morning I face some challenges in life and and my mind it wants to get wrapped up in the wha ifs or the what if not so to speak and the thing I found is that when there's uncertainty in life Satan wants to take us on a personal tour of every single possible negative outcome amen he walks you down on every road of what if this happens what if this happens what if this happens and he takes you into great detail about something that has not yet happened amen and none of it is positive every bit of it is negative none of it is of Faith all of it is of doubt and what's he doing Church he's trying to distract you from what God has said and from your purpose in life amen Satan is trying to take us down those roads so he can create stress and worry and fear and it takes our health down it takes our families down it takes our relationships down and we just get beat out because we're so busy walking down roads of what if what if what if and only doubt and stress and worry are waiting at the ends amen but if we can intentionally look to God and that takes conscious effort because Satan is always there to bombard but you've got to respond with a bombardment of your own by the word of God as we spoke last service and say but it is written it is written it is written and don't respond to him respond to yourself and encourage yourself in what God has said about your situation amen sometimes we're working on things or we're waiting on things and it seems like nothing is going to happen the doors keep slamming shut we think it's going to happen then it doesn't we think it's going to happen and then it doesn't and we can't make Headway and nothing's going right and we're getting there and the tendency of our human nature is to get frustrated and to get worried and that's where Faith start or fear starts to dwell amen and this situation in my life I was home and it wasn't working out and then I left to go to Montreal and I went to Edmonton and I'm getting calls and this isn't working and that's not working I don't know if I can do this and and all these things were going on and I could sit there and I could stew or I could do what I did which is say God this in the end is up to you I can't make it happen clearly I'm not going to fret about it and I just said Lord I am committing this situation completely to you and what did I do I disengaged I walked away and I said I'm not going to talk about this I'm not going to dwell on it I'm not going to Stew on it I'm just going to do everything that's asked for me and I'm going to trust you to sort it out that's all I did amen why because Satan was trying to distract me from what I had to do amen I've got to take care of my family I've got to pastor this church I've got a study and all this was was trying to get me to pull away from the things that really mattered in my life and get caught up in things that have no point amen so what did I do I committed it into his hands but let me say this I committed it into his hands from the get-go but I thought things were going to go great and then when they didn't that's really the test of did I commit it into his hands or not because we think it's going to go great well Lord I'm just trusting you that it's all good church there is no test without a test there is no Victory without a battle there is no graduation without a testing time and so when we commit things into his hands the real test is when things don't go the way we thought they were do we get in there and try and make it happen on on our own or do we step back and say Lord this is in your hands my life is in your hands amen and so I refuse to engage and if you know me as a person that is not my way of doing things Germans don't like to disengage they don't they like to go in and they like to work the problem and do everything they can but I said Lord in the end this matters not to me and it truly didn't it would be a frustration yes it would be a disappointment maybe if it didn't happen but I just said Lord this is in your hands and you know what I was sitting with brother Joe and I got the phone call that changed everything and that was it it was done and I didn't have to worry about it and I just said Thank You Lord because I haven't by God's grace and I can say this from the pulpit this morning that nothing had bothered me about it I was able to just say it's going to go the way God wants it to go and if it doesn't go then that's fine as well I'll walk away from these things amen remember I read that quote a while ago we were preaching on the greatest weapons brother Bram said this he says just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it but I think sometimes our problem is is that we think we can do something about it amen whether it's because we've got a skill because we've got money because we've got influence whatever we've got a work ethic we think that because we're putting everything we've got into it God will bless it that's not necessarily the way God works sometimes God just says would you please sit down and let me show you I am God and you are my child amen church he is our God he is our Jehovah Gyra he's our provider how about we let him be that way it'll take so much stress out of our day-to-day lives if we say my life is in your hands amen but we're in a battle we know we're in a battle here and don't think for a second that our Christian walk is easy I'm looking at Believers this morning anybody had an easy life to date even our young people know it ain't easy much less the older ones it is a struggle it is a trial day by day it's a hard way anden Paul would say this to Timothy he says if we suffer we shall also reign with him because he had to suffer to reain we've got to suffer to rain he says but if we deny him he also will deny us but the thing I like about Paul is that Paul never pretended to be anything different or anything special and the thing is he was different and he was special the scripture says that God said of Paul that he's a chosen vessel Paul was literally created to share the gospel to the Gentiles but he wasn't a perfect man he he dealt with health issues he dealt with issu issues of his conscience read Romans 7 sometimes and you'll see that Paul had all sorts of little faults and failings in his life as the angel messenger the prophet to the age amen Paul had internal faults and failures and he never pretended otherwise Paul knew that he needed the blood of Jesus Christ and the grace of God every day of his life and he never hid that from us he never hid that from us sometimes the fact that we share our struggles with people helps them in their struggles James said confess your faults one to another and pray that you may be healed why because sometimes other people need to know that you're struggling too listen there's we look at our elders in this church and we might think they're more spiritual than us and I hope they're more spiritual than us cuz they're further along but sometimes the fact that they struggle and we know that they let us know that they struggle or they're in a battle lets us know that it's okay to be in a battle as well Church the fact that you're in a battle shows whose side you're on because everyone else in this world is just giving in or trying to do it their way but when you battle against the things that are going on the influence of Satan in this world it shows who's in your life it shows who's in your heart it shows whose son or daughter you are amen so what we can't help is how we're born we can't help our flesh we can't help our family traits and church traditions and all these different things but what we can help is whether or not we're going to fight amen and whether we're going to just let it go or whether we're going to seek to be delivered of it by the power of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives Paul faced big challenges in his life and he never pre pretended otherwise but one thing I like about Paul is Paul was never unthankful Paul no matter where he was no matter how bad the situation was and he had a lot of them he got stoned multiple times left for dead he had people trying to kill him people persecuting him he had all sorts of things he got put into prison and Paul never stopped worshiping or praising or thanking God Paul and Silas are in the stocks in jail and they're worshiping that's the kind of person that's the kind of Christian that Paul was Paul said this he said and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful church if you get nothing else from this service get this one a thankful heart will carry you a long way with God if you can thank him in the good times as much as you thank him in the bad times amen that we could no matter what's happening we can thank him no matter what that'll get you a long ways in your relationship with God then Paul would say to the Thessalonians he would say rejoice everm more you know what that means thank God every chance you get thank God that we have sunshine thank God that you have breath in your body thank God that you have a house over your head thank God that you have a wonderful spouse thank God that you don't have a spouse maybe no matter what is going on thank God for it he says pray without ceasing now you say brother John that's impossible and your right it is impossible because we have to think about different things we have to work we have to deal with situations but what Paul means there is be in an attitude where you can always approach God about a situation in other words keep the channel open where you can drop into prayer and prayer does not mean you get down on your knees like this and put your hands in a certain way but it means that you have kept the channel open so that when the moment comes you can say Lord Jesus I have a need not just for your needs but you say Lord I Just Want to Thank You Lord I appreciate your goodness Lord I Thank you for answering prayer I know I thanked you yesterday but it's still on my heart thank you for doing what you did for our brother thank you for doing what you did for our sister thank you Lord after all this time you're still faithful to your body that we can keep that channel open and we can step into his presence at the drop of a hatch as the need arises or as our heart draws us there amen but that's one thing to do but then Paul would say in verse 18 in everything give thanks everything he says for this is what the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you now it's one thing to say it but it's another thing to do it this morning that when things are tough when finances are tight we give thanks when we got lots of money in the bank we give thanks when our health is great we give thanks when our health is poor we give thanks when business is good we give thanks when business is bad we give him thanks when the service is good we give him thanks when the pastor's not hitting the Mark we give him thanks anyways amen amen it's hard to sit in a church service where God's feeding somebody else guess what we don't always come in here for ourselves we want something but sometimes we're there to help somebody else get it and we've got to be okay with that sometimes amen I remember brother Matt Watkins telling this story and he he was going up to the pulpit and he dropped his notes and they got all mixed up and turned all around and he's up there and he's at a special convention and he's got a ton of people there and he's so flustered so flustered and he's just he can't get his thoughts together and nothing's coming right and he's up there and he's blowing it big convention he says and I I finally just gave up and he says and I just started speaking on the value of life and at the end of that service a sister came up and she said I was going to end my life after this service and then you started preaching about that nowhere in his notes nowhere he had no idea and in the end it took God to completely frustrate the thought that he had given given him and to put him in a different channel to speak to that one lady now can you imagine everybody else sitting there listening to something on the value of life and it means nothing to them because they're not dealing with suicide but for the sake of that one woman he completely changed that conference one woman but if those people would have pulled back what might have happened there but if they can stay there and they can say that might not be for me but it's true but it's your word and you start to say Amen you never know how God can change the situation amen Paul Paul doesn't expect anything out of us that he didn't expect out of himself and he put his what he put his life where his words were and these were not just Paul telling us to do it but it was a testimony of Paul and his constant report of God is that God is faithful God is faithful he takes care of his children he takes care of his word and no matter what his situation was Paul would say God brought me through it but I want you to see something in second Corinthians where Paul talks and I put this in the Amplified this morning because it gives us a a greater depth to this and he says we do not want you to be uninformed Brethren about the Affliction and oppressing distress which befell US in Asia he's on a missions trip to Asia and nothing went right Lord I'm in your service I'm on your path I'm doing your will everything's going to go great right nope no there's a challenge there's a trial he says how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life itself anybody weary this morning anybody feeling crushed anybody feeling like the weight has been there for so long that you don't even want to try and walk anymore sometimes the burdens of this life the situations the constant wear the constant stress is there seems like there's no end to the struggle there's no light at the end of the tunnel it's just wait and wait and wait Paul says that's how I felt he says I know how this feels he said when we went on our missions trip things got so bad that we thought we were going to lose our lives and we had committed ourselves to dying he says indeed we felt within ourselves that we have received the sentence of death and were convinced that we would die but watch his testimony but this happened happened so that we would not trust in ourselves he says but in God who raises the dead he rescued us from so great a threat of death and the church said amen hallelujah thank you Paul Paul what's next and will continue to rescue us oh we've got to keep walking this road yes sir there are going to be times in the future Paul says where he's going to have to do the same thing which means I'm going to have to go through the same type of trial so he can be the same kind of God he says on him we have set our hope Hallelujah Church where's your hope this morning on him we have set our hope and he will again rescue us from danger and draw Us near Paul's saying God delivers God makes a way when it looks like nothing can happen God makes away and God completely changed their situation took them out of the very jaws of death and brought them back to make them a testimony amen and Paul says it's going to happen again and he's going to rescue us again and it's going to happen again and he's going to rescue us again because our hope is set on him and he's going to draw us back to him Paul gave God gave Paul a testimony so he could encourage the Believers sometimes that's what your trial is it is literally for everyone else it is think of brother Ron Spencer he's approaching 5 years with stage four brain cancer and he still preaches every week goes and preaches conventions still travels around to preach the gospel church you think that's for him that's for us that's for us he takes 30 pills a morning 30 pills a morning sometimes puking in the bathroom before he goes to the pulpit because his body is so sick but there's something in him that keeps pressing on something keeps holding him and it's not for his sake sake it's for our sake so that when we get up in the morning we have a little headache or we have a little sniffle or maybe we feel horrible we can get up and say God's still God God can still use me no matter how I'm feeling this morning amen but there's going to be times where we're going and we're doing things and it seems like there's no end in sight to what we're doing but what's our purpose here our purpose is to be a witness and a testimony of a living Jesus Christ he's the same God today sister Nikki amen amen I thought that was perfect this morning he's the same God today and the only Christ people are going to see in this age as you and I Jesus Christ never sets foot on this Earth until he comes back in the tribulation We Gather to meet him in the air the only revealing of Christ is in his body his bride so we've got to be that witness and that testimony whether we're going to work whether we're staying at home whether we're at the home school group we're at the gym we're in the office wherever it might be our purpose is to show Christ amen and Paul got a revelation of a God that delivers real quick as soon as Paul gets the Holy Ghost and he goes back to Jerusalem the first thing they do is try and kill him now that's a ways down but Paul just constantly he was put in situations where he had to trust God and what is it it was God taking you say you believe it and putting it into action we have so much knowledge we have so much Revelation God's trying to turn that into faith so we can live by it day by day amen but I want to Pivot this morning just real quickly for this because sometimes life is tough and it's tough because of my decisions and not his decisions sometimes I step into things sometimes we're in a bad spot because we put ourselves in a bad spot amen we what happens we put the word of God aside and we decide this is what I want or this is how I want it or this is when I want it and let me tell you Church my way is hard my way is hard God's way is hard my way is hard too but my way is hard for a different reason amen my choices are hard on me if I'm focused on what this flesh wants if I get an idea in my head and I don't filter it through the pure word of God I'm going to pay a price for that decision if I stick with it look at this it says good understanding giveth favor but the way of transgressors is hard so we're speaking on the harder way this morning but there's a hard way and it's the way of the transgressor that word transgressor means those that act deceitfully or treacherously so other words it's someone that disguises their actions under a cloak of Good Will or spirituality this is not about unbelievers this is about Believers people that live in sin are not transgressing because they're Sinners it's the believer that transgresses because they know better now there's a price to be paid don't get me wrong you do something that is contrary to the word you're going to pay a price the scripture says be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man SS he'll reap you do certain things you're going to reap certain things there's no changing that amen amen but this this this transgressor is someone that gives a reason for what they're doing that sounds good but when you start to compare it to the impact it has and the word that they're supposedly standing on they don't match up amen they can wrap it up in a spiritual reason a religious reason or a good rapper but it's still wrong and in the the ones that's deceived is not us it's them it's self-deception it is not deceiving the rest of us because if we've got any ounce of discernment we'll look at that and we'll say that can't be of God because it's contrary to the word and so they're only deceiving themselves but you make a decision like that church and we all have you make a decision like that what happens after a while you step back and you say something's wrong and it's not wrong because the way is hard it's wrong because there's no peace in the hardship amen that you're going through something and you start to say why is it that this is getting to me so badly and you realize I made this decision I made this choice I took this step on my own amen and what happens is you're suffering and there's no rest there's no goodness coming out of that suffering and what I found in these situations is that when we do these things what we end up doing is turning our guns on other believers because what happens if we is we've walked away from the word if only in that small area of our life I'm not saying you've walked away we've walked away from everything but in one area we've walked away and what happens is when we walk away from the word there's no correction and when there's no correction we think we're right all the time and then we start looking at other people and trying to correct them and what happens is God says no problem and he just steps right back completely and he lets you walk that path alone and what comes out is fruits and the fruits show who was in it and who wasn't because if evil fruits come out of it it wasn't God but if good fruit comes out of it then it was God there's suffering both ways there's hard ways whether you it's a hard way whether you walk with God or you walk of your own nature and your own free will but in the end the fruits will show who was in it whether it was me or whether it was God Amen you might have a hard time in a decision like this but it's never going to be productive because you left God behind and so you walk backwards you go backwards you backslide and what do you have to do you have to come back to him that's the only way back Peter would talk about this he says for this is thankworthy if a man conscience toward God and your grief suffering wrongfully so if because of what you believe you endure hard things that's good he says but what glory is it if when you are buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently if you're an alcoholic and you lose your job that's not suffering righteously you lost your job because you're an alcoholic you lost your family because you're an alcoholic and so you say well I'm just going through it and it's so that's not suffering righteously you're suffering because of your poor decisions Peter says we're not supposed to be there he says but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God I've dealt with this with people many times through life not just as a minister but just in general well people will make wrong decisions and then they sit there and they say but I'm going to make it through what's the point go back don't make it through go back stop going forward go back to where you left God Amen he's waiting there where you left him you know Jonah's that perfect example to me of suffering without a purpose suffering Without a Cause cuz he flat out disobeyed God God said go to Nineveh and instead he jumped on a ship to tarus nearly killed everyone on board because God put up a big storm and so Jonah had to finally admit I'm the problem he says get me off the boat and everything will be okay and so they heaved him over the ship and as soon as he hits the water then the water goes flat and everything's okay and what happens is a whale comes and he swallows Jonah and Jonah spends three sweaty stinky seaweedy rotten fish nights in the belly of the whale repenting and after 3 days God has that whale vomit him up on the shores near Nineveh and turns it into something for God's glory and that's the privilege of a child of God that's the privilege of a child of God Romans 8:28 still holds we know that all things work together for good God will take your poor decisions and he will bring them to to a place where you can give him glory but there's still a price to be paid and Jonah's price was 3 days in the belly of a whale with a lot of nastiness and I don't think he ever forgot that I don't think he ever forgot that amen you're still a child of God but there's a price that has to be paid and then you've got to come back to where he was and we see that in the parable of the prodical son that the father never left the word the father never left his land he stayed where he was but he kept an eye out and as soon as that son came in view on on his land he ran to get him he'll go anywhere you are on his word if you'll come back to his word but he says he never went and found him out in the world he knew better he knew where daddy was he knew where safety was he knew where food was and so God says you got to come back to me now you know where I am you know where you left me you got to come back to it amen God's always merciful he's always gracious but the way of the transgressor is hard amen and you've got to walk back and sometimes that's the hardest thing isn't that the most humiliating thing is walking back and saying that was me and not him it is it's a tough time Moses found out there's a hard way of transgressors and sometimes it's not that we're trying to do wrong it's that we're trying to do something in our time cuz Moses was born a deliverer he was born a special child from birth he had a call in his life he knew the word of God as it related to him amen but Moses transgression was presuming that he knew when God wanted to do it and so all he ended up with all of this in the end was he had one dead Egyptian he lost the influence on his own people and he was banished to the desert for 40 years that's what Moses transgression caught him cost him Amen brother Brown would say this he says Moses found out his way didn't work and as Moses learned the hard way so have I learned in that way no doubt but many of the people here today sitting here or standing here has learned it the same way it's a hard way he says it's best to surrender your will to God's Will and hold a conference with him God what do you want me to do God what do you not want me to do but we look at all that he says it's a hard way but we're not preaching on the hard way this morning we're preaching about the harder way amen the child of a the the the path of a child of God is often far harder and we opened up with the book of Peter and Peter said this he says wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations I want you to catch that thing now first thing Peter said says it's only for a season there's only a time for the trial the trial is not infinite it does not go on forever but there is a trial there's a season for these things and sometimes a season is you have to give of yourself for somebody else and sometimes you have to let go of yourself so God can change you sometimes it's for their benefit sometimes it's for your for for your own and so many times we're asking God God changed the situation and God's promise was not that he would change the situation God's promises that he would change you that he would change me and so many times what God's saying is I'll change the situation if it's ever needed but let's work with you first and see what needs to be done in you because so many times the change that needs to happen is in me not in that situation and I know I've said this many times but I want to repeat it this morning the greatest change has to be in here and then after that so many times we find the situation doesn't really matter that much it doesn't matter it doesn't matter God will give us a peace God will give us rest Church the greatest testimony I have is not that God has met my financial need that God has given me Health that God has given me a home that God's given me a family the greatest testimony I have today is that I'm not what I was yesterday and I'm not what I was last month and I'm not what I was last year and he's continuously changing me into His Image that's the testimony I've got that's the promise he gave me is he give me a new heart and a new spirit and then he put his Spirit within me and he' make me walk according to his word that's what I've got this morning that's what youve got this morning that's the testimony of the Overcomer is that you are no longer yourself you are a child of God walking according to the word of Jesus Christ amen Peter says manifold Temptations oh I hate these scriptures don't we hate them manifold temptations that means many and different it means that he's not just punching you in one spot he doesn't just have one spot but it's things going on in every aspect of your lifetime and that's what Paul was talking about crushed it just seems like we've got an onslaught these days one thing goes away and there's another thing and sometimes you're fighting three battles at the same time you don't know where to put your energy amen you don't know where to put it various trials sometimes it's one thing today another thing tomorrow and sometimes it's everything today those are the rough days nothing's going right everything goes wrong you know we used to sing that song as kids no body likes me everybody hates me might as well eat worms every you ever feel like that where you're just like I might as well just sit down and give up cuz nothing's going right and nobody actually really likes me either it's true we get there don't we we get so burdened by the effects of things but Peter comes behind he says that the trial of your faith it's a trial of whether or not you really believe he says be much more precious than of gold that perisheth he says when this is all done you you'll be so happy you went through this you'll value the experience of these trials he says though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory when at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen we're going to go through events we're going to go through situations and trials in this life hardships and scars and all these different things but Peter says they'll do one thing they will be to the praise and honor and Glory when Christ appears now the world will look at this and say well that's when he comes to get us and I don't disagree but you've got to remember when it comes to purification when does he appear he appears when his reflection is seen in that which has being purified what happens as we go through these things in life and what is it doing church it's producing Jesus Christ in you and in me and so when you start to see that it's Christ in me the hope of Glory that it's bringing out something that you didn't even know was there and through all the scraping and the beating and the trials and the heat all of a sudden he appears in your life and you say Thank You Lord thank you Lord I'm still walking forward I'm still growing I'm still maturing amen we go through these things and it produces the life of Jesus Christ in us remember his appearing right now is in you and I that's what people are saying amen these things were always in Us by the attributes by the thought of God and then the Holy Spirit comes in and it brings it up into life amen but these things we go through what's it there to do it's to produce the life of Jesus Christ amen in plain view in you and I that's what this life is for is to produce the life the character and so we can look back on these things but what Peter's trying to do is we can look back on it and say God was in it Peter's trying to get us to the point to say God is in it from the front rather than from the back because we're children of God that we go through these things with purpose amen you look at purification I was watching this yesterday how they they produce iron ore and iron ore Gres from dirt to a pure metal and there's a lot of processes and it's a lot of dirty and it's a lot of scraping and it's a lot of mess and what comes out in no way reflects what goes in it seems like and it's a lot of things going on at the same time amen it's a lot of beating a lot of mixing if if iron or had feelings it wouldn't feel good but what comes out is far better than what went in because it's taken it's gotten rid of everything that was impure and it's brought in that which was in there in the first place amen I want to share this scripture with you and this is one of the greatest scriptures I know of as it relates to us as Believers and how God develops Us in these things amen because you'll see in the scripture that no believer ever walks into a situation and God just gift wraps them an amazing thing it never happens everybody has to go through trials and testing everybody's got to be proven because what God is coming back for is character he's coming back for character amen and so everyone had to go through training and testing to develop that character above in them above all things to reign with Christ we have to have the character of Christ amen people think they get things from God because they're children of God no you get things from God because you act like you're a child of God there are things we have because we are children listen you can be healed when whether you're a brat in Christ or you're a mature believer in Christ that's the children's bread but if you want responsibility in this life you've got to start acting responsible like a Believer amen You' got to act mature so this scripture in Psalms 105 it's God speaking of his favor to the Seed of Abraham amen that's the children of God and that means it's relevant to us because we are his spiritual seed we're the faith Seed of Abraham this morning amen because we have the faith that we did that he did but he says moreover he's speaking now this is the favor of God watch moreover he called for a famine upon the land and he break the whole staff of bread so God made things difficult he brought a famine to Abraham's people that were under the Covenant and he made them hungry and then it says he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant so stop and consider this Joseph is a prophet of God and he has done nothing wrong Joseph has lived his life righteously when God gives him a vision or a dream he relates it exactly the way it was he didn't add anything to it he spoke the word of God as it came to him and because of that his brothers faked his death told his father he was dead and they sold him into the into slavery but God doesn't say he sold him into slavery God says or or sorry he says it doesn't it doesn't treat it that way like this was just happen St it says God sent sent in other words God is in it this was God's hand moving and God's and moving here in a plan to meet the needs of the Seed of Abraham is through Joseph and the way he does it is he sells him into slavery Church Joseph has all the reasons in the world to be offended to be hurt to be disappointed to turn his back on God because he's done nothing wrong and God sells him into slavery that's God's hand on Joseph's life amen so so Joseph goes there and he's a slave to Piper captain of the king and then Piper's wife comes on to Joseph he turns him down she she she accuses him of assault and so what does God do now Joseph having done everything right with Piper God says whose fo whose feet they hurt with feeds and he was laid in Iron so God now takes him now not just from slavery but now he's a felon through no fault of his own Joseph acted honorably in every single thing that he did and now God puts him in prison he did the right thing and he pays a price for it verse 19 until the time that his word came it says the word of the Lord Tried Him the Amplified says until the time that his word of Prophecy came true the word of the Lord tested and refined him what Peter said there's a season there's a there's a time for the trial there's a time for the test and there's a time for the graduation amen there's a time for the the battle and there's a time for the victory the scripture says until the time was right for God's word to be fulfilled Joseph was tested to see if he believed the word amen that's the harder way we're talking about the word was there the word had been given that Joseph was going to be in authority over his brothers that they would bow down before him and then what does God do is he drives Joseph down into the ground wrecks his life destroys his influence to say Joseph are you going to believe that word are you going to fall away and get offended church but there's a time where the time that his word came Hallelujah and in the moment in a twinkling of an eye Joseph went from a slave and a felon to sitting at the right hand of the king King like that just like that amen it says the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance and to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his Senators wisdom can you imagine remember what happened is the king had a dream and he couldn't remember the dream much less he needed an interpretation of it and he asked around and nobody could do it and then finally uh I don't remember it was a the cup Bearer I think it was the cup Bearer that would that had been spared and the cup Bearer said hey I know a guy I know a guy in prison that helped us and he he interpreted my dream maybe he can help you and so Pharaoh comes and he brings Joseph before him and so Joseph is standing there now he's a slave he's a felon he's a prisoner he's in his prison clothes he's no doubt dirty and ragged and he stands there and he tells the kid the Pharaoh what his dream was then he tells him what his dream means and then Pharaoh says well what do I do about this we're going to have these great years of plenty we're going to have seven years of famine and at the end of the famine there's going to be nothing left it's going to be worse than it ever was what do I do and Joseph said find a wise man and put him in charge and he'll take 20% of of what's brought in every year and he'll put it aside and we'll make it through and the King says you're the man and Joseph in a moment goes from Rags to Riches he gets the Garment of the king he gets the king's apparel he gets the King's Jewelry he gets the Ring of authority on his finger and he's standing now at the right hand of the King acting in the king's purpose and plan like that that's the day that his word came but until then it tried him and it tested him why am I saying this is because it's a harder way to walk with the word because God sets the timeline not you it's all in him it's all in him we don't get to push it amen and so often it seems like nothing's changing but the problem so often is we're looking at the outside and saying nothing's changing but we don't realize what has been happening all along and if Joseph I don't know Joseph was a type of Christ nearly perfect he only ever asked is did one one thing that we know that was wrong I mean I'm not saying that's it but the scripture records he asked his father to lie about being a Shepherd because the Egyptians looked down on Shepherds so he said tell them you raise cattle but as far as we know Joseph didn't lay a foot wrong lay a hand wrong all his life he's there and he's enslaved and he's in prison and his attitude's right his approach is right he he acts of his own free will he he works hard and does all of these things and God blesses him and what was it showing it was producing character in Joseph so that when the time came he would not use his power for Revenge but he'd use it for the goodness of his family and for those around him amen God's working on the Inside Man so often church and that's what takes a while is there's no quick fixes there's no quick fixes amen God's got to produce character and character has to be tested before it can be put into action in God's service amen and then like I said before sometimes the outside situation really doesn't need to change because once you've got character you're able to walk away from situations you're able to let people go you don't get offended the same way you can you you can take somebody to prayer rather than take them before the Throne of judgment and so that's all God's trying to do the way of the transgressor is hard and when you look around this this world though so often they get all of their good stuff up front you can work 60 hours a week and make tons of money and get further ahead in your career than somebody else you get a bunch of money you can spend a lot of money you can buy a big house you can have a nice vehicle you can go on Great Vacations you can get Prestige or influence and all these things and it seems like it's all good but then further down the road you find out there's a price to be paid and when your marriage falls apart and now you're so stressed out that you're into drugs you're into alcohol your kids aren't turning out so good everybody's gone and what you're left with is stuff that has no value there's no there's no value in these things certainly nothing of Eternal value it's hard to come to the end of the road and realize that you don't have anything of value I've got I've got my own family that's in this situation amen it's my father's birthday today 72 years old and for all we know he could be gone tomorrow and he's sitting there and he's looking around and if he's honest with himself he can see I have nothing of value and our only prayer is God have mercy God have mercy that they'll see their condition in these things amen and that they'll come back to him CU It's A Hard Road but Joseph see God front loads the heavy stuff and then the joys is at the end usually but he gives you peace to go through it he'll give you peace to go through it the harder ways you get everything up front and then it hits in the back end and you can't undo it anymore you can't undo it there's no promise in the suffering that comes with the hard way of a transgressor but I want to jump forward for the last portion of the service this morning because we spoke of Jesus in the last couple of services how that he had to make his own choices through life and he had to choose the harder way he had to choose the way that meant rejection that meant persecution that meant people trying to kill him amen people trying to destroy his ministry and he had to choose that way because the word said he would but remember he was the word and we read last service that he says I come to do thy will oh God it's written of me in the volume of the book I come to do thy will he was the word made flesh and so because it's imprinted on him he cannot deny himself it's literally built into him to do it I'm saying this morning it's built into you to do it as well but you got a different rapper than he did and that's where the battle is so many times but you look at Jesus ministry leading up to Calvary he raised the dead he healed the sick he opened blind eyes he healed the lepers he created and and multiplied things he walked on waterers he calmed the storm he stilled the sea he cast out demons he set people free and we would say that is the Apex that is the peak of his ministry and yet church if he never died and rose again it would have been for nothing temporal only for that people only for That season amen it wouldn't have had Eternal significance for you and I if he would have just lived his life and gone on Amen but I want you to see something as we start to close on this thought we're talking about the harder way and I'm saying the harder way is a choice for every one of us he says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world under the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them under the end under the end even when they walked away even when they forsook him even when they betrayed him he says and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas a scariot Simon son to betray him watch this now Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God so Jesus knows what's going to happen remember I'm Mount Transfiguration Elijah and Moses come down they tell him what's happening they tell him what's going to happen in Jerusalem they tell him what he's supposed to do that he's going to go there be betrayed give his life by horrible crucifixion for Humanity so notice there's a time like Joseph where the word of God is going to try Jesus he's had a trial of sorts in his ministry but it's been with signs and wonders and power and authority he always won but now he's got to step into a different trial CU he's going to have to trust the word completely amen Jesus is not in a position where he has no choice it says God has given all things into his hands he's talking about that flesh man now that man has to choose am I going to go ahead or am I going to back away amen he has to choose do I do what the word says I should do or do I do what my flesh really would prefer that I do amen it's on his shoulders it's his decision to make remember the Lambs that were sacrif throughout the Old Testament had no choice but this lamb has to choose to give his life the Lamb of God has to choose to give his life it couldn't be taken from him we had he had to give it amen we're speaking on the harder way and this is the harder way to look at the word and say that's where I'm going to stay no matter what it costs me to get the reward of God you've got to have the full word halfway get you halfway results and let me tell you halfway to Eternity is not enough and then you got to go all the way with God and we look at Jesus he says therefore does my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself he chose to lay it down he says I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again now he knew he had power to lay it down but the power to pick it up again was in faith in the word he had to believe the same way that you and I did church amen he says the this commandment I have I received of My Father Like I said Jesus is the word made flesh that word is imprinted in him and yet the flesh would not desire to go through what he's about to go through the beatings the whipping the nakedness the public shame and then to finish it off crucifixion amen his heart's desire is to fulfill the word but he's got a complete revelation of the pain and suffering that's coming his way and in his flesh he does not want to go through it nobody wants to go through a beating nobody wants to go through a hard time nobody wants to be stripped naked in public nobody wants to do that amen testing isn't easy for anyone including Jesus and he knows what's coming through there and and you talk about a crushing weight that's on him we look at what it talks about him in the Garden of Gethsemane and says and he was withdrawn from them about a Stones cast and kneel down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me I don't want to do it that's what we would say but he says if you're willing he says but nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly why because he's got to go through with it he's chosen to go through with it and watch the effect it says his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down on the ground church you think you face hard decisions this is hard decisions Paul said he was he was crushed under despair but Paul never Paul never sweated blood th this is called hemat hydrosis it's an actual medical condition and for someone like Jesus who had no known diseases or conditions the only thing that would cause us would be extreme stress sometimes we're laying in bed and we can't sleep cuz we're stressed out cuz the bank account doesn't have what we need in it cuz things just aren't going our way we've got a big test tomorrow we've got a challenge at work we're going to have to stand up for what the word says but how many of us have sweated blood Christ is under such extreme revelation of what awaits him that it is causing him to swep blood out of his body so why'd he go ahead why did he go ahead blood pouring out of his body from the stress and yet he says I'll do it he was the word made flesh he could not deny himself he couldn't deny what he was the word will do what the word says it was his very makeup his very nature was to do what the word said because he was the word but Paul would say it this way looking back at Gethsemane he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God in other words Jesus was looking at what awaited him at the end of the trial to take him through the trial he was saying what's going to be at the end is worth going through what faces me in the next couple of days amen he understood the pain but beyond the pain he saw a joy that was greater than raising the dead and Healing The Sick because what he saw at the end there was a restoration of the family of God into relationship with God that was the great joy he saw it was you and I he was he was looking and he saw you and I at the end of this amen he saw Paradise opened up he saw the righteous gathered back to God not just the temporal healing of our bodies and sicknesses and issues but he saw an eternal value that was going to come out of this life that he gave amen so he gave up his position he gave up his power he gave up his authority he gave up his own will for you and me and he took my sin and he took your sin upon him and everyone else's sin and it dropped on him Paul says this it says for he ha made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Church what he's saying there is he literally became our sin he was our literal sin remember he was God manifested and now he becomes sin manifested you talk about a paradox you talk about a a paradigm shift he goes from the highest of the high to to the lowest of the low in a moment he goes from being Anointed God in flesh to the entire weight of all of our sins every sick thought every nasty thing every horrible thing drops on him and in a moment he is separated from God he goes from Anointed God to rejected of God that's what the book of Isaiah says rejected he went from being pleased pleasing to God to not even be able to be in his presence a total separation from God in a moment that's what he chose for you and I church he went from Jesus the Christ to Jesus of Nazareth of his own free will and died in agony on a cross screaming my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me total separation total darkness from God and yet his love for us the joy that he saw kept him nailed to that cross he could have left remember what he told pilate he said I can call for 12 Legions of angels He could have left at any time as they started ripping the flesh off of his back he could have said take me out as they were punching him in the face and pressing the Thorns into his head he could have said take me away as he's up there on the cross heaving trying to catch his breath he could have said take me away I don't want to finish finished the work but he didn't because he saw what was waiting at the end that God should love a sinner such as I can you imagine that transition from absolute Purity and righteousness into total filth what that would do to us and yet his body was built to handle the trial to handle the test that body was built to take the pain and the suffering and the anguish of total separation from God from physical pain humiliation his body was built to bear that burden I don't care where you're at this morning you're built to Bear the burden because you're a part of the word the same as he was the part of the word Paul said this he says there has no temptation taken you but such is common to men in other words what God puts on you is not above your Humanity God's not putting a supernatural burden on your on your on your natural body but what he's given you you're able to handle he says but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to Bear it that word temptation see we think that's about well you know don't look at this or don't do this or that but it doesn't it means to stay with the word of God that word temptation means the trial of a person's Fidelity their integrity their virtue or their constancy he says it's the same Temptation by which the devil sought to divert Jesus the Messiah from his Divine errand so in other words the trial of your faith the Temptation that you face in life is trying to get you away from your Divine errand what's that to fulfill the word of God for your age to to be what God has called you to be everything that Satan is doing is trying to claw you away from the word and say I give up it's not for me and it's only in a little spot usually he's not trying to take you out of church he's trying to take you out of the word you can keep coming to church and you keep making decisions that you turn away the word in this spot this spot what happens is it's a crack and it grows throughout your foundation and pretty soon Life Starts to crumble because your foundation's broken doubt and fear are cancer to a believer and they crack that Foundation amen when we get away from the word of God but Christ was built to take this amen and he did he endured as a man he went to the whipping post as a man he didn't give up at any time he held himself there and in the end he gave his very life because he believed the word that said he'd pick it up again we have to lay our lives into God into his hands but Christ we don't just lay our life we he we don't lay our life he had to give his life we give our lives and we stay alive he had to give his literal life believing the word that says he'd raise him up he would not suffer his body to see corruption amen he goes to the cross and he dies before the other two thieves do why he didn't die from blood loss he didn't die from shock he died before the two of those because he chose to remember what he says on the cross he says it is finished he had fulfilled all that he needed to fulfill up to that point and all that was left was to give his life and so he said it is finished and he gave up the ghost he gave his life away he released it he set it away amen it's finished and maybe like Joseph's life there was many thousands of years before looking from an outside view that looked like the darkest moment in history the Son of God dead laid in a tomb the Earth broke open in a in an earthquake and the sun was hidden for three hours I think it was and and the Earth was just declaring the enormity of what had just happened God had died the Flesh of God had died if we want to put it that way and then a body broken destroyed laying dead all the hopes of that Messiah crumbled and broken laying in a tomb that he didn't even know but under the surface Hallelujah there was something going on that nobody could see there was something happening when he died that made an eternal impact moving forward for the rest of humanity amen because the man Jesus Christ stepped into his theophany he stepped into his spiritual body and he went somewhere amen why he kept walking with the word I want to this is a long set of quotes as we start to close this morning I've got two pages left he says then where did he go when a man dies does that finish it no sir he had to die that way because God's Bible said he would die that way he says and he trusted God's word that's the reason he could say in his life destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in 3 days he knew that God's word could not fail oh my if he could rest solemnly upon that believing that God's word could not fail how much more can we rest as solemnly that we have been born again by the Holy Ghost and it a witness in our heart right now that we know that Our Redeemer Lives and will come again someday he said rest assured that those that are in Christ will God bring with them he says there he was he knew that not one cell of that body could corrupt 72 hours corruption sets in that's the reason he never stayed the three days he died on Friday afternoon and was up on Sunday morning but it was within those three days within those three days he was to rise again because he trusted God's word he says here he goes where did he go when he left the Bible said he descended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the longsuffering of the days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down he says let's follow him up on Earth they're mourning they're crying they've lost hope and yet the word is still being fulfilled right beneath them he says I can see him on that Friday afternoon after his death knock on the door of the regions of the Lost let's follow him a minute he says the door opens there was women there was men there were young ladies they were old they were all together in that hideous place called the prison of the Lost Souls but in that mournful place there Jesus walked to the door everything had to witness he was the son of God because they had been preached to in the long suffering of the days of Noah and they were without Mercy without hope because they had transgressed and the door was shut in their face he says and he knocks on the door of hell he said I am he who Enoch spoke of I'm the seed of the woman that was to bruise the Serpent's head every word of God has been fulfilled I've just died Yonder at Calvary and I have purchased my church he says and when he did the devil came out and I can just hear him say oh you so you finally arrived I sure thought I had you when I killed Abel he says you see when that seed was promised in the Garden of Eden the devil had constantly tried to destroy that seed and the seed of Abel and the coming of Seth was just the death burial and resurrection of Christ that seed must continue and he tried to destroy it he Saidi thought I had you when I destroyed Abel I thought I had you when I destroyed the prophets I was positive I had you when I beheaded John but now after all you've arrived I've got you now can you imagine all those people sitting there listening to this conversation going back and forth he says I can hear him say Satan come here he says he is boss now reaches over and grabs the key of death and hell off his side hung it on his own side he says I want to serve notice on you you've been a bluff long enough he says I am the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross and the full debt is paid you have rights no more you are stripped give me those keys he says that's right turns around and gives him a good healthy kick and slams the door together and says stay in there I'm boss from now on Hallelujah he says he had the keys to death in hell and he took them after his resurrection he said I've got the keys of death and Hell Peter had the Keys of the Kingdom Satan had the keys of death and hell but now Jesus has got them he's boss here he starts up it's getting Easter time is passing fast now we can sit there and we can Rejoice on that but I want you to recognize something because there's something else going on in the background because there's people that have been laying in the regions of the Lost for thousands of years Abraham Isaac Jacob Sarah David Samuel in a place set aside they can't go into the presence of God under the blood of bulls and goats they live their entire lives by the word and the promise of God and then they die and where do they go not into the presence of God and for thousands of years they stay there and they say we live by his word we die by his word but where is his word where's the promise why is God not with us thousands of years but I don't believe they were sitting there like that church I they I believe they were saying he's coming he's coming he promised he's coming and so he's coming amen but yet they were not in the presence of God and so when Christ comes down and starts speaking I believe Faith started to lift up a little bit more and they said here we go here we go he says but there is another group where is where's Abraham where are they at where are those fellows that trusted God's word has he forgotten them did Death annihilate them was that all of it he says never never God has to keep his word he says I can see him and I see Abraham and Sarah walking around there and after a while something knocks on the door Abraham goes and opens the door and says honey come here look here look here that's the very same one that stood with me under the oak that day he's Abraham's God we've been speaking on the godhead and Abraham sees that man and he says that's him that's him that's him I recognize him does he look the say no but it's him I recognize him why cuz he's fulfilling his word he's finishing the job he says then I see Daniel looking over his shoulder and say that's the rock that was hewed out of the mountain just as certain as I'm standing here I see job raise up and say that's my redeemer that I said I knew that lived and someday he would stand upon the Earth my body may not be but a little Spoonful Of Ashes but in 15 minutes from now I'll be in it again he says that's him Ezekiel looked over the top and said I've seen that same person as a wheel in the middle of the wheel turning way up there in the middle of the air then up comes Enoch and Enoch said I saw him coming with 10,000s of his Saints to execute judgment there was the Old Testament Saint waiting sure they were under the atonement of blood they could not go in the presence of God God Of Heaven because gold and sheep blood could not take away sin but he said my brethren I'm the one that you think I am I'm the seed of that woman I'm the son of David I'm the Son of God I'm the Virgin born one my blood has atoned for it you waited under the blood of sheep and goats but now my blood atones and you're free he says let's go up it's getting almost Easter Hallelujah in the moment in a twinkling of an eye you look at the scriptures remember this happened really really fast cuz Christ doesn't come up for 3 days but the scripture says as soon as this happens the graves are opened literally boom done and all of a sudden Abraham and Sarah are walking around Jerusalem and they were seen of many people for days and days and days and then they're caught up with Christ amen he says oh that glorious on that glor glorious Easter morning when he rose from the dead the Bible said according to St Matthew 27 that many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth Rose and come out of the graves who was it Abraham Isaac Jacob job those who by spiritually revealed Revelation knew that the Redeemer would stand on the earth someday he says that's them the first fruits of those that slept there they walked in the city I can see Sarah and Abraham young and handsome and full of life never to be old no more never to be sick no more never to hunger no more walking around in their body see Sarah had a body change before but this was a body change that would never change Sarah still died Abraham still died even after their body change but this was now the word being truly fulfilled remember what Peter said waiting for a Salvation to be revealed in times ahead this was Abraham and Sarah's salvation in times ahead they got the fullness of a body change they got the fullness of their salvation Church you look at Abraham's life was his life the harder way you compare him to lot who had the harder life up front lot's was a lot easier but in the end what did lot have he' lost his wife to Salt he had incestual relationships with his daughters to turn into thorns in the side of the people of God Abraham's walking around intense Dusty windy noisy smelly but in the end Abraham's way though harder brought the greater the greater reward amen but he died remember the scripture says in Hebrews says these all died having not received the promise but on Easter morning they received the promise they received the full promise and they waited in faith all that time believing that he would come and get them amen Church you're here to walk the harder way way and you're built for it you're meant for it amen it's a part of you you can't deny this anymore than you could walk away from your own skin because you're a part of the word we sing that song something keeps holding me there's times where we get so tired there's times where I don't feel like studying there's times I don't feel like preaching but guess what I get up and I do it anyways there's times where I don't feel like reading my Bible but guess what I read it anyways there's times where I don't feel very spiritual but that doesn't change anything that's just feelings that's just mental battles that's just struggles that's just tiredness that comes in this life but something happens and something Rises up and I put another foot forward that's all I'm asking you this morning to do is keep putting your feet forward there's joy in the morning amen weeping only lasts for a night the song says It's always darkest right before the sun comes up they say but there's joy that comes in that morning amen you're meant to produce the word for this age amen trust God if you're weak this morning ask him for strength don't try and go through it like you're you know King Kong say Lord I need you Lord I'm struggling Lord It's a battle Lord you see my faith is being tested Lord you see the struggles you see the weight I'm bearing you see where my mind's at Lord will you give me a peace and a rest amen you know we think the harder way and I'm sure when I said that that title we go back to what happened with brother brandom and remember what happens is he's in a meeting and there's a message given in tongues to him it says because thou Hast chosen the narrow way the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of thine own choosing he says Thou H has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou Hast made and he would say that's what he says I know what that means because I've I've seen beyond the vi you know I went beyond the curtain of time and I saw that bride that was there that end time bride that comes out of that seventh Church age under my Ministry and he says and I recognize that but he would say I don't know what this next purse means he says this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass their tremendous victory in the love divine he said what does that mean he says I'm not really sure near the end of his ministry I believe he understood it but up front he didn't know what it was was but there's a beautiful promise there but watch what he says now he says why he says why did I get this why is this was this message given to me why did God affirm me this way he says not because we had to do it he says he didn't beat me into it he didn't force me into it he didn't say you got to pick this way he says and not because it's just an easy way he says you can be popular you'd be have everybody patting you on the back money flowing in from everywhere for radio or television and so forth he says they would just take it and televise it but he says I don't believe in taking God's things and putting them out on such vulgarity and stuff of the world I don't believe in all this hooping up and making something that isn't I believe in just letting it alone wait he says God he's God let him do with it what he wants to we are servants just serve the Lord just do as God said this is where I want to finish this morning he says man in the midst of it all though is for forced to make a decision amen God bless you let's stand if you would forced to make a decision my way or his way the hard way or the harder way and the thing that gets us through the harder way is the fact that we can see there's something that's waiting at the end amen amen you got to give up what you have now temporally for something that's Eternal at the end and that's all that the decision to serve Christ is is that you say I'm going to lay down this so I can gain that amen and if we can keep our mind on that if we can keep our mind that he promised that there's a purpose for every trial for every sickness for every situation for every hardship for every season that we struggle in it'll help us get through that remember what Paul said though Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing and give thanks in everything for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen it's all in his hands there's a purpose there's a plan for it Christians are the only people in this world that suffer for their own good and it's the purpose and it's the plan of God so where you're struggling this morning and when I say struggling I don't mean where you're weak but where there is a battle this morning recognize there's a victory waiting at the end of this that's far greater than what's gone into it amen there's a law of physics that says you can't it out more than you put in God is outside of that God takes what you do and puts in and he multiplies it and he makes it an overabundance above what you could ever ask or think amen that's the kind of God we're serving this morning when we give up our will when we give up our mind when we give up our desires and we say Lord I'll take the way with your despised few he says that's wonderful he says I'll give you more than you could ever contain in this life and in the Life to Come amen haven't we haven't we got a testimony of that this morning that he's always brought us through and it's been better on the other side than it was where we started amen amen let's go to him now Heavenly Father Lord you've called us on a highway lord it's a it's a highway of hardship it's a Highway of Holiness it's a highway of Separation Lord It's a highway of surrender Lord and there's a great battle that goes on between our soul and this flesh that wants its own way but Lord we're committing ourselves to your word by by your spirit this morning Lord that as we Face these situations we Face decisions day by day that we would look to the end and decide based on that Heavenly Father Lord that we would see the promise of your word Lord and that promise Lord that Revelation that your word can never fail will carry us through Lord God lord you see your children here this morning Lord we have many needs we have those that aren't here because they are sick this morning Lord I pray that your spirit would go to them Lord that it would bring Deliverance that it would bring healing to the home Lord that it would go to a hospital bed and it would bring a total Deliverance for Young Noah Lord that it would come into our lives that we would come into our families our marriages Lord that our decisions could reflect the fullness of the word of God Lord that we might receive the joy that comes at the end of those things Lord Jesus Lord give us strength for the battle Lord I know many are weary here Lord Satan's a good battler Lord he always comes at us he never stops Lord but your word says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would raise up a standard this morning Lord that it would bring the word to our remembrance Lord that we would seek it out and that you would pour more of yourself in Lord God Lord that they could see that you're on their side Lord that you back up your word in their lives Lord may we have a testimony day by day Lord of your goodness and your grace as you fulfill your word and Our Lives Lord we Grant ask you to Grant it now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's sing Jehovah Gyra 722 my provider je G my provider you are more than enough for [Music] me je ra You're My Healer by your stripes I been [Laughter]

gone people moved on situations have dragged on embedded seems like we can't get ahead I'm sure they felt that way down in the regions of the Lost year after year but one day he appeared and when he stepped in everything changed amen there's a trial of our faith will we stay with that word amen but there's also a joy there's a light amen that's coming at the end but if we could know the end from the beginning we' walk through these trials a little more differently if jerus knew that his daughter was going to be raised he'd have walked up to Jesus a little differently but that's why you're different this morning is because you've read the book you've read the back as the song says and we win but there's victory that goes all the way through our lives amen and it's the revealing of Christ in us that gives us the victory amen and so you don't have to go through these things with a A Down face with a despair in your heart with a depression amen but you can say I'm a child of God
