all fear is gone [Music] because I [Music] he holds our fear [Music] the [Music] let us [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] it's approaching with a greater revelation than what the world is expressing today hey man while the world will be expressing even on Wednesday hey man it's Christmas Day but again they're not considering the gift of God - considering the gifts of mom and dad and grandma grandpa family friends and neighbors but brothers for the right a man the great gift is Christ a man and for and for us is that for Christ it is the gift of eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's keep the balance and as I said we'll stay with the word by the grace of Almighty God to God be the glory that's Santa Claus a man but to hit - again this time of the year Santa Claus was getting a lot of glory and getting a lot of praise a man and oh my if the only new you know the history of Santa Claus and where it comes from and how it comes and so on you stay away and when it comes to a lot of things people getting involved in during Christmas the power of God so as Christians we can't do this with Christians we can't do that he says that's idolatry a man is referring to the Christmas decorations and this and that oh yeah a lot of people - a lot they're worshipping it in their heads they worship it in their in their zombie in their hearts so but the grace of God we're going to thank God for the birth of Jesus we thank God that He gave but again it's like the booklet we have over there and there's a picture on it concerning Christmas is it pagan and it is and there's four pictures on the front and one is his birth and the other one is his death and if they for this cause came I into the world a van and then down I said what did he do what do you want us to do and remember severe probable Christmas tree no I said right on the other side is there is the bread and wine the communion Amen praise the Lord so Jesus is not referring to his natural death he's referring to or not death but birth rather he's referring to his death he man he wants to focus us on what happened on Calvary a man by the grace of Almighty God so let's keep our to keep the balance when it comes to Christmas and I guess I've said some some believers now some believers are more and more is getting more and more now are getting involved in Christmas and they're having their going back to what they came out of as I did tell I got a certain brother and sister that present a certain thing concerning brother Branham and Christmas as you shouldn't have done as you're going to improve this increase the sale of Christmas trees this year either guys why because you didn't bring the balance and what you were pretty I said the property did say this but he also said this and so on so we got to take into consideration the whole truth nothing about the truth a man brother and for us to do that is to justify that the denominations out there that are compromising on the word a man they want to add to it or take from it so brother let's not add to it and I'll take from it let's take it the way that it is by the grace of God amen and of course we're not objecting to any the giving of gifts and things like that but let's keep it simple there's not glorify the devil there's not glorify Santa Claus a man no not by any means so we will glorify the Lord Jesus Christ and just think they're putting more emphasis is oh Christmas Christmas that's when Jesus was born yeah but they'll put more emphasis on Santa Claus than on Jesus and that is the absolute truth so grace to us to keep the balance and let let the balance you keep your reflection to the people of witness to the people a witness to your family and friends and neighbors and so on so rather be careful don't don't leave the wrong impression no no not by any means God's gonna required of you because the the in the judgment the gods will say you've done this unit on that and any a part of the prophecy of but on the screen he said what you did as a witness to the and so on and all God was in in that person the word was in that that brother that sister and so on so they're so they'll be without excuse for so the grace of God that you'll judge them and they won't judge you amen so let's be on our guard by the grace of God and the closer I think we get to eternity and the closer we get to to the resurrection rapture of course the less and less and less emphasis were going to put any any on Christmas and on this and on that no we want to get into the reality of it amen he was born without sin and praise the Lord he came back to give us a new birth a man without sin to thank God by the grace of God amen so the Lord blessed us and give us the wisdom we need especially this time of the year and again our brother Bob as mentioned already is concerned there be no service on Wednesday and of course it's it's Christmas Day and they're not only of course there's not going to gonna be a lot of activity around Christmas and gifts and so on but I understand too that the the weather forecast is not so good for a Christmas Day but also during this week our brother Bob sister Brenda brother Matthew and his family they will be they will be journeying to kill morning you know for three or four days there so god bless them and we pray for a safe journey a man and that God will bless them in the heart and in their souls I don't know I could I've been in kill Maury many times when we lived in Dewar and in Mary's time we drove by there many many many times of course it's not the kill Maury that we saw many year forty years ago is quite different now so so god bless our brothers and sisters as they travel amen of course and remember brother Joseph sister Priscilla in Tucson so I don't think they're looking at snow and I don't think they'll need any shovels amen but a brother from Tucson did tell me he said no we don't have the snowstorms and we don't have to worry with that but he said we do have problems sometimes with sand and I said yeah he always says the same problem you got with certain snow conditions he said we have was saying and they said were warned to be on our guard if there's a high wind and there's a lot of sand or yes he says you can go off the road you can run into another vehicle a man if you're not on your guard so thank God for snow amen and as I said to her brother that went to Florida and he emailed me back and he said brother no snow here all I said it's too bad I said the Bible says you should do when it comes to your sins though they be red like crimson and he's everybody said you're gonna be white like snow so I said if there's no snow you won't know what he means a man and it's like certain brethren in central United States and they said well we don't understand this song we can sing it a certain song there in him and he said but he said we can't identify with it like the brothers and sisters maybe a new flannery or down the coast it has to do with the water and so on that we had we know what it's all about but they don't amen could we witness it so the grace of God to us amen and that brother when it comes to snow just check see how many times the Bible refers to snow a man and let's identify with it not in the natural but in the spiritual day man and also to keep in prayer our brother Jeff King in Ontario there brother that well my sister-in-law called and and then he wanted to speak to me and he really appreciates what God has done and what God has said through his servant the prophet and he maybe even online today going to the listen to our some of our services so god bless our brother Jeff and the Lord willing I will be sending him some booklets he has understand he's already got a lot of Browns sermon books I'll see what other booklets he does he doesn't have concerning what God has done in this hour amen and what God is doing in this hour by the grace of God as I said this to many are recognizing what God has done but not what God is doing a man and they're going around the world God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet but like I said around 1977 that cave that took a tremendous change and it was basically our brother lavell that he started to emphasize the message he said God has sent a prophet but why and what about the message he says that that prophet brought what was the message that prophet left us and from there on the ministry started to get into the message a man so and line up with the message not just the revelation God sent the Prophet that's getting to the message that God gave us through the Prophet a man and faith comes by hearing the word a man by the Word of God the Lord for your day the word for your our faith came to Luther by by catching the revelation of what was ordained for his age and the West is a Salvation Army the Pentecostal age a man but what about your age and mine a man what is the revelation of the word that we need amen so we're getting into into it we've been into it we're going to continue with it today and there's going to be maybe a few more services concerning a prisoner of Jesus Christ and when I did some little more study I was surprised to find out how much emphasis the Prophet was putting on a prisoner of Jesus Christ a man I'll share some of those thoughts with you because it was after the opening of the seals that he got into it a man the seals of course was in March or April and he preached of course marriage and divorce he preached another sermon another sermon and he said now he said this is a further revelation on the mystery of the seven seals a man and brother according to heard the emphasis that he was putting on on the prisoner of Jesus Christ and also is a revelation and a further revelation of the mystery of the seven seals they met he's not just an ideas not just a thought it's a revelation and I was surprised when I described that the profit not only preached preached sedessa worry in 1963 July but he went on and he put emphasis on it and yeah again in late later in July he put emphasis on in August a mad and other messages here and there I was surprised at the number of times that he was putting the emphasis on being a prisoner of Christ a man not in jail but in this in this body amen and to be ender and to reflect the the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ God help us brother we need to catch this further revelation on the mystery of the seven seals or we know that this was the seven seals this was the seven seals but then he came and preached marriage and divorce that he preached this he preached that a man and this is in 1963 now listen here this and he went on and he preached Paul a prisoner he preached Christ as the mystery of God revealed and perfect faith and in all these messages he's emphasizing being a prisoner of Christ a man and finally it came to the in when he was nearing the end of 1963 the the Lord came down and said brother Branham you've got a return to evangelism a man because the purpose of his ministry was fulfilled in what in that he had come he had first pole second pole and then it was climax with the third pole the opening of the word the revealing of the mystery of the seven seals and a few others that he preached in 1963 and then God said that's it it was over with so he said now he said go back to evangelism and at the end of 1963 with on the master last message that he preached he said now he said ere I go he said back into evangelism a man he moved from evangelism into a prophetic ministry and now God was moving in from the prophetic ministry back to evangelism a man why to do because the word was laid in now the seed would raise up that would feed on that word a man that that word was ordained for as he said he said now he said I know it's not striking you what right he's just not striking me right because why because it wasn't the time it wasn't that hour but now we're moving into that hour that revelation of the resurrection rapture now the only the seven seals and the other revelations of 1963 ought to be striking us right a man and I ought to be having a greater and greater influence on us than it did before by the grace of Almighty God a man that it's gonna strike us now the way it should and what is it going to do if it strikes us the way it should it's going to it's going to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen it's going to go beyond knowledge when it comes to God did this God said this God said that but back back 40 years ago we never had the revelation that we have now we didn't no no back 40 years ago 150 years ago it went on and on and on God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet but finally as I said met the believers begin to get into the revelation of message a mayor so I pray grace that we are into the message and the message is in us a man god bless you listen this thing only believe as we go into the word concerning prisoner and Christ the mystery of God reveal a man [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus J [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes Lord I believe [Music] possible Lord I pray and trust [Music] yes amen help us to pray in the trust you that was to pray and believe you help us to pray Lord and put our absolute confidence Lord that you're not dead but you're alive and the Lord according to the promise they are with us even in us to the end of the age so lord help us to believe Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever father we know that there is less and less and less that are calling on you less and less that are believing you well we pray God Lord that by the grace of God that were numbered with the few that really truly sincerely believed it is written that we truly sincerely believe that say the Lord we truly sincerely believe Lord Jesus that you're not dead but you're alive forevermore and you're with us and you are in us to bring the pass your word you're with us and you're in a salut you lord that you will want to make the word flesh in us Oh hallelujah Lord I was less than you two thousand years ago we pray that the word is flesh in us today father for the resurrection for the wraptor for the change of our bodies so the grace of your presence and your anointing be with us Lord and they're going for the word and your grace of God amen concerning what our brother Matthew prayed Lord to forgive us father for our sins forgive us where we have failed you forgive us Lord where may be Lord that we have done what is right in our own eyes but not right in the eyes of God amen oh my lord elders to make our calling and election sure hallelu to make sure that we are the prisoners of Jesus Christ nor that we under your control were under your leadership Amen by the grace of Almighty God so we pray for that anointing that or the Holy Ghost said in any of the life of the blood of Jesus with us in us and around us that anointing of the love of Jesus giving us Lord the faith we need in this hour the faith that NEADS the fade my brothers sisters need a man in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord it is for me to our knees but it is all for the glory of God father's not just to say I got it I got it I got it the Lord is the glory for you father as the proof is the evidence that we you gave it to us a man who gave us the revelation and you're there to quicken us to hit and it to us Alleluia to take us some time to eternity so be with us Lord we pray again Lord lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the power and the influence of the devil so we're under your power under your eternity and we're under your influence Lord that we are truly the prisoners of Jesus Christ not a prisoner of the devil but a prisoner of Jesus amen to do or what you want us to do how you want us to do it when and where you want us to do it all for the glory of God so lord be with us we pray again Lord we're asking your grace family friends and neighbors the sick the lowly the suffering father lift up the trunk fallen and Cheer the faint all for God's glory your honor your praise amen and help us if we go to the word father to become more will one with the word Alleluia in the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ to get out of here and into eternity grace in the name of our Lord Grace in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now I believe [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] amen god bless you turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 amen best within the last couple of days I saw the testimony of a certain black singer in the United States and it was a woman and she gave her testimony she said well she said I got saved at 12 years old but she said I still went on and did what I wanted to do yeah it was the influence of her father to get her to place and accept Christ as their Savior but she said it was some years later before he became my lord a man I said God bless her Lord I said she's got revelation so he said she said he's got to be more than my Savior she said he has to be my Lord he said the country says to control my thoughts and my words and my deeds so she's I'm led by his spirit a man and brother there's a lot of believers that they recognize Jesus as their Savior but he's not their Lord a man and their life proves that he is not their Lord that I proved proves that he's not up there not a prisoner of Jesus amen and another thought that I wanted to wanted to share with you today is is a the attributes of those who are prisoners of Jesus amen and that the Bible says that you're working out Europe your salvation with lot oh just just by the word this doctrine that doctrine no Paul says you got to work it out with fear and trembling amen praise the name of the Lord I said Lord I said this is this is the increasing the revelation of being a prisoner of Jesus Christ now I say during her to to work at our salvation with fear and trembling a man you're constantly on your guard am i right am i in the in the in the presence of god am i in the will of God constantly morning noon and night your you want to do that so it's with fear and we're travelling unless we get out of the will of God a man and we're fear and trembling we want to make sure we are in the will of God we stay in the will of God this is God's will that's God's will amen the life I live is by the grace of God for the word of God amen and and again it's tremendous brother it's not just going to church there's other things God wants to do in your life there's other things God wants to do in my life there's other things that Jesus wants you to be a witness of and testimony up a man not just going to serve not just that he's my Savior but he's my Lord amen so brother hallelujah with the grace of God in his lordship so the Lord be with you I want to go in praise the Lord to another thought concerning being a prisoner of Jesus Christ number one thing that we're going to express and and show is fear and trembling in our everyday life making sure we are Christians making sure that we are a man Christ like a man Christian not churchgoers but Christ like sons and daughters of God Christ like a man praise the Lord brothers and sisters in the faith and so also and if and if we are prisoner of Christ and we do have that spirit in that anointing of fear and trembling working at our salvation on daily basis what does it do it brings us to a place of being addicted a man have been addicted to the Lord being addicted to his word brothers sister we know what it means to for somebody to be addicted to this to drugs to liquor and alcohol and all these things a man because they just can't live without it they want it and they're constantly doing this doing this to get it and maybe they got to go out and get some extra money so they can buy it are they going to get this so they can get get get get the liquor get the the the beer or so on and why because they're indicted to it but are addicted to it rather so we have to be addicted to our Lord Jesus Christ we have been addicted to his word now that we got to be if we were born again and we're baptized with the Holy Ghost we are addicted to the Word of God amen we're a prisoner and rejected to his word amen we can't get away from it amen because there is that fear and that reverence and respect that we have for the word that fear and reverence and respect that we have for Jesus amen again not me that lives us Christ liveth in me I didn't redeem me to myself II to redeem me praise the name of the Lord I was born to senator and I'm still in this sinful flesh amen so thank God for Jesus thank God for Calvary thank God for the word thank God for salvation God helped us to become more and more addicted amen to the spiritual things more and more addicted to the revelation of the word amen more addicted to the revelation of the of the message plenty of us to the resurrection and the rapture brother to the true for us to go into it and be part of it and for it to be me flesh in us we had to be addicted to it Christ was addicted to what is ministry let us be addicted to the message amen what was it the LED Christ to get so many it was addiction a man in the flesh well listen what will he letter we went out and came back went out I came back to finally not my will don't be done addiction will lead to that confession amen if you're addicted to the Lord the things of God not my will father don't be done Lord forget my my ideas I want yours praise the Lord sir brother God's grace to be a prisoner of Jesus God's grace to have the fear and trembling of a prisoner and God's grace to have the addiction of a prisoner a man you're addicted to what for the purpose of your prisoner ship and brother again I'm amazed at many times the profit I lighted being a prisoner of Jesus amen not in jail but in well as in jail sense but it's this jail yeah brother don't don't think about that over there that I dare know where we're in a jail here and we are prisoners of Jesus Christ into seal amen but he's given us eternal life a man and he getting out the anointing of the Holy Ghost to make us addicted to what we need and what we need now now religion not more doctrine not more theology we need the resurrection in the rapture amen so having the book of Philippians chapter 2 and verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed hear the word of the Lord as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence a man the ministry was there the messenger wasn't there so he said I want you to I want you to be I want you to be a continual medians to the word not because I'm there not because there's ministers there that minister no no he said much more as you see the Day approaching much more in the absence of the ministry so he said work out work out your own salvation amen are you well I don't have to do anything you should do Christ is the beginning of it he's there to encourage you he's here to give you the strength you need a man but still God looking for something in you and struck at something in me oh he's looking for Jesus yes but it's not just Jesus he thought he were or spirit it's reflecting in the life you live and he's not reflected in the life you live he's not really not in you you might have it in your head but not in your heart amen so wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen for it is God which worketh in you both to will to do of his good pleasure amen is God working in you is God doing his good pleasure in you amen - and it says both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and dismutase god help us yes yeah we need to ask the Lord to forgive us for our Marines and our disputing 'he's a man do all things he said without murmurings and disputing amen sometimes God does this to test you God does that to bring out the certain thing in you and reflect it to others let him know that you got Christ in you you're a Christian and it says that he may be blameless and harmless the sons of God tremendous blameless and harmless by working out that salvation amen glory hallelujah that he may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom he shine as lights in the world god help us amen holy forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain god bless his words you may be seated there with me to Ephesians chapter six just back one book their visions chapter six often I'm sorry Ephesians chapter four and verse one we're familiar with with the other verses concerning the the fivefold ministry but Paul is highlighting the importance of prisoner ship and fear and trembling I therefore the prisoner of the Lord this eats you that's what worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called a man this is tremendous we need to take the scripture more serious than just reading an essay well that's the Bible and that's the word of as the word of the Lord through Paul but let's apply it to our lives make our calling and election sure a man to confirm that we are prisoners of Jesus and that we are addicted to his word a man so he said walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called what does God require in walking worthy of the vocation verse 2 with all lowliness and maintenance with long-suffering forbearing one another in love amen there's a way God is looking for in yours in your life why are you looking for you to reflect these attitudes a man to him and to one another so as with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love a man bearing with one another in love God elvis endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace praise the Lord hallelujah when I there to bring division when I dare to separate but there to unite a man and to encourage the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace because he said verse 4 there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling amen we really need to take it serious our relationship with the Lord our relationship with the word our relationship with each other and it says one Lord one faith one chisholm one God and Father of all who is above all a man praise the Lord and through all and in you all a man that proves the oneness of the God by the grace of God is just like this bookmark and it says the words 1 God are mentioned seven times in the entire King James Version of the Bible one God seven times and it says that we not all one father the Bible says it a man and not one God created us yes why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the Covenant of Our Fathers a man Malachi 2 and the scribe said unto him well master thou has said the truth for there is one God a man and there is none other but he mark 12 and it says seen it is one God which should justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith a man one God and that is Christ Romans 3 but to us there is but one God the Father of all of them all are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we in him 1st Corinthians 8 and again one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all we just read Ephesians 4:6 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus how can you make a trinity of it it's not three persons as one amen it says I believe it said there is one God and I do as well the poles also believe and tremble a man James 2:19 God help us a man to have the revelation of one God the oneness a man of our relationship with God and a oneness of our relationship with each other by the grace of God amen turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 beginning to read at verse 1 so here the word of the Lord here the scriptures apply it to your life apply it to your soul apply it to your spirit to see if we are truly born again the sphere we are truly sons and daughters of God because we are we are prisoner two crates where a prisoner to the word a man and we have that fear and trembling a man before God and we are addicted to Christ and it worked amen if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love and fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies or emotions and mercies fulfilling my joy that she be like-minded is a tremendous challenge to our faith is a tremendous challenge to our everyday living not just our attendants on a Wednesday or a Sunday Sunday service but it is everyday living there we are in him and he is in us by the grace of God so he said fulfilling my joy that she be like-minded and having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind this is tremendous a man sir are we living for Jesus are we living one another are we living for ourselves a man we were born again we're living for Christ and living for the body of Christ and he said let nothing through strife or vainglory a man see again keep your attitude right and your spirit right by the grace of god this is Scripture and it says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory god help us again let's examine our lives make sure that we're not we're not doing anything with strife or vainglory we're not causing anything any strife among the saints no therefore that were there for the unity amen were there to encourage the unity were there to improve the unity were there yes to bring unity amen so let each esteem the other better than themselves is amazing amen you're better than me amen you you you consider that your brother next to you or your sister next year is better than you amen you are what you are by the grace of God they are what they are by the grace of God grace for me grace for you for them amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I tell you there's a prisoner place hallelujah and addicted to Christ in his word brother big and makes us reflect Christ amen it gives us the image of Christ the character of Christ the motives of the objections of Christ living amen this is tremendous I the Lord I said if we need to take these things serious and I just say oh you know the Bible says the Bible says the Bible it's God saying it and it's God revealing it to you and me as God wanted to make it flesh in you and me by grace a man see both other if God is looking for anything is for Christ revealed in you and not crazy in your head or you got the knowledge of Christ I know Christ I know this and I know that amen does he know you amen just consider again the the foolish virgins when they Kate I don't know you he had no no intimate relationship with there or there was a relationship probably gods because they were virgins amen but they never had the extra laded amen so but before the wise virgins did when they come he so I don't know you amen he had no intimate relations that were there and if he knows you he said he does have and he continues to have an intimate relationship with you amen not you that lives as Christ living this is a brother/sister don't take it as the letter of the word but take it as a revelation that God is imparting to us God wants us to see God wants us to hear it God wants to seriously consider it it's not me that lives it's crazy living than me it's a challenge to our faith the challenge to your faith oh I'm a Christian but it's Christ living in you you give me a Christian word and her certainly said some deeds but not the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth amen not to the extent of the labor Christ controlling you not to the extent of being a prisoner of Christ a prisoner of his word and not to the extent of being addicted to the word and the things of God Amen brothers a generation of believers and most of them are addicted to the world and the things of the world they're not addicted to Jesus and they don't really love Jesus my brother-in-law like doesn't like the wives version Amen brother I pray grace that that our lives are going to reflect the addiction our addiction to the word a mayor oh yes your lives whether it whether it's when you were in school where there's at your home whether whether sitting in your job it's gonna reflect your addiction to spiritual Christ oh yeah you're not ashamed of it you don't worry you think you're a Christian or know you're a Christian or something something you got to take a certain stay in and you don't mind yeah man to God be the glory amen now my will father's mind me dead and you're there willing to lay down your life amen as I said I did it my Bible says identify with him and in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering see most just want the power of his resurrection Eve my Savior yeah but he said your Lord that you will identify with him in the in this fellowship of is suffering do you want fellowship with a suffering a man o my brother's sister there's more most Christians oh I'm good if wonderful praise the Lord God's good to me and all that it's all good good good well I'm gonna bring it over a talk about grace oh yeah they think grace hope thank you Lord for that grace thank you for that yeah but what about there's another grace to just grace for this reason it's grace for that reason whole grace does this yeah you can have that and go to hell yeah but there's something else that God by grace once it wants to do in your life oh no no that's not God is it oh yes it's God oh but god is good yes he's good he knows what you need that's why you're gonna give it to you amen we think God is good so we know anything it happens and whatever the Lord is going to do in my life of your life Oh everything's gonna be good and it's going to make me happy it's gonna make me this that no no I said misunderstanding and that's a misinterpretation of grace anymore it's a revelation of grace that goes so far but let's go the whole ways brother Grace in the beginning grace down through the ages grace grace for the search ages amen brother because what what is God what is God requiring of us God what does God expect universe oh but Lord Lord don't want me to do this door don't want that door won't do this yes he will well I can't I can't there be just too much suffering this too much that yes he said but like Paul never these glasses but he was going blind he had to write with big letters and there's others other issues Paul and and he to ask the Lord he asked the Lord he asked the Lord Lord did this door do that I do this and Jesus come now said Paul he said my grace is sufficient for you amen this do this do Paul want God to Oh Elam I want to God to make him good and make him healthy make him strong making this physically know his grace is there to take you through the negative things brother he said my grace is sufficient for you a man if it's for us to sufficient for Paul it's sufficient for you a man you got to go through this test they're going to be tested this way that way any man oh my lord by the grace take it away no grace is going to take you through it now take it away praise the name of the Lord all my brothers god of us you talk about the bride that's going in the right for the bride is going to the resurrection it's a break that experiences the grace of God knows the grace of not just all make it happy and joyfull and all that no it's taking you through the hard times because through much tribulation showed you enter the kingdom and persecution oh well if we're doing it for the Lord we they'll just ignore us or walk away or say things about it we'll go on no father God said even during the Great Tribulation when that's beginning to blend in he said the bride's gonna stay a while God's gonna try your faith you're going to Buddy seed you won't suffer unto death you're going to suffer but not unto death oh yes you're going to have to custom take what's what's it is it's God is bring you no faith because it takes faith to please God a man and faith is the revelation in your heart in your soul and brother to get us to focus on that God's got to work on this amen to get our attention from this that's why this happened let them work so you'll call on his name I don't know he led this Avenue that I work so that you'll trust his grace you get more and more into a relationship with him by grace so brother being a prisoner of the Lord God help us this is this is what God is looking for in your life and mine amen not 2000 years ago but today and he said again verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves as tremendous as a child at our feet well he's better than me yeah she's better than me and so on oh yeah praise the Lord thank God for the faith of our young sisters here I thank God for their testimony Wednesday with the Wednesday after the service Wednesday yeah it was good yeah it's a fellowship boot there and they were confessing their faith in Christ and they are what they are by grace by but what God has done for them any man is not what they've done is what God has done I don't know you know being just religious is being spiritual why it's because the anointing is in their souls and is working out the revelation of Christ hey man praise the Lord I pray God continue to bless our young a man youngest to the oldest pray those pleading the token life of the blood of Jesus and I just saw do this do this no plead the Holy Ghost for him a man by the grace of God and brother reflect Jesus Christ reflect the life all that they can identify with because he's seen them by grace God bless our sisters how I knew you so brother esteem others better than yourself maybe we should have stayed young sisters here are better than we are now what it is is in the eyes of God what are you in the eyes of God how does God see you what's God's attitude towards you Wescott spirit towards you well God knows things about you that others don't know oh yeah a certain spirit certain attitude God's looking at that oh yeah so let's make sure we got the right spirit and the right attitude toward one another hey because that's what God's looking for are we do we have the spirit to our one another that he had toward me in you to redeem us we're gonna lay our lives down for one another as he laid his life down for us if you got Christ in you you will and we're dead to ourselves there live to God amen we're living for one another we're there to help one another dare to encourage one another all praise the Lord amen yes Amen that each esteem the other better than themselves and look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others most are consider well I got yeah I want to keep this I want to keep I want to make sure they smart make sure of that yeah God's gonna take it all away if your heart is on it he's gonna take it all oh yes definitely now and there's too many the hurts that their hardest darts are on the natural things of life not the spiritual it was on the spiritual attend our cottage why should I care again that brother said that some years ago when he preached in the United States he said the biggest lies told are told in church and he brought it he said a tender ecology citizens the truth or a lie he said most salient and they're lying because he said it's not true in their hearts there's a few they saying it they mean it Lord attend or a cottage why should I care they're building a mansion for me over there amen and they really believe it and God knows it god knows what you're putting the Evers is on in this life brother don't single I seen the true expressing your faith not my real father not many want to do that ok want God to do this God do this god do that I need this snort I need that Oh Lord build up my bank account Laura build up my my home make me give me a beautiful home nice they're so nice that forget it Lord whatever you want I'll take amen not my will father dying be done don't want to give you the glory hallelujah the honor and praise amen let my life reflect you is if if it's a life of a beggar like like Lazarus Amen praise the name of the Lord not the rich young ruler yeah amazing how many would if Jesus called us and said to us listen so what you got and give to the bore why it was going to get to me Lord he would consider himself poor he would be trusting his Lord he's trusting himself and he's worldly possessions yeah most are gonna be like the rich man and they left up their eyes in hell God knows our spirits God knows our attitudes God knows right down on the inside the inside and I say God is not a Hitler with that in that spirit that he had on him no God God goes beyond that to a spiritual realm a man a man caught help us brother and again look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others a man Oh bless my brother Lord he needs this meat that brothers need Lauren meat that sisters need Lord amen and it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen we know I got the mind of Christ cuz I believe this doctrine this doctrine no no it goes beyond that Amen so that the mind that was in year increase being you who be in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God a man but he made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men just like God came down as a servant amen the devil wanted it wanted to hell evade him put him up pop him up make him look big and good in the eyes of man but Jesus said no to God be the glory he turned Satan down and Satan comes to tempt us that's a promise that he's the first one in church and he tempts us oh do this do this do this and you you'll experience this you'll experience you live that brother the way you tempted Jesus he's tempting believers yeah oh yeah if you do this all of this and what a 19 are they under amazing isn't it that Jesus was under that anointing of Satan and Satan took him up into the high mountain Satan took him to it to the to the pedicle of the temple saying a power Satan guy he's got an anointing oh yeah yeah you could have the anointing of God all over you got what we needed in us but you can add the anointing of the devil in you or you can have the anointing of the devil on your flesh oh yeah this is all mine Lord my lord just consider what what what the devil did to Jesus what's he doing to you make sure that you're under control of the Lord Jesus Christ make sure that we're prisoners of Jesus not prisoners of the devil amen he has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short so brother that this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus not the mind of the devil but let it be the mind of Jesus and it'll focus always on the word the word the word amen and not just yesterday but today the word today the word today what does you want to do today Lord what does you want to do today anyway give us the revelation and they say sube in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God amen brother and jesus said I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come to you I'll be with you even in you and they said I'll I'm in you you and me I worry in the father and so on and it's was absolute oneness with you Jesus and the father what does your life for click that does your spirit reflect that does your attitude reflect that or does just reflect a religious spirit or is it the Holy Spirit are you God in flesh are you the father are you the son are you the Holy Ghost manifested in flesh they're all one so is Christ in me it's the father's in me the Holy Ghost was in me wonder that such revelation is going to give bride the bride rapturing faith the resurrection faith and no wonder at all that is going to be very very very few living Saints go in the rapture and it says he made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant servant we want others to serve us know you serve them that's the Spirit of Christ and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross we humble ourselves become obedient unto death to die to ourselves a man wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name a man that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father hallelujah Saints as sons and daughters of God we are we surrender as prisoners to our Lord Jesus Christ and give him absolute control of our lives that's as a challenge does he have absolute control of your life your thoughts your words and your deeds what you have done and what you will do today is it Christ in you or is it you it is the evidence that we are absolutely addicted to Jesus Christ in thought word indeed am i addicted to Jesus am i addicted to the word if we are indeed addicted to our Lord Jesus Christ we are under the control of a strong hunger and thirst in thought word and deed if we're addicted to him then we have a oh the anointing upon us creating in us a hunger and a thirst for more and more and more of God amen not this world we don't want this we're finished with this world work tired of it oh yeah the Prophet brings that out in his emphasis on a prisoner of Christ a pressure of Christ he said doesn't know this world and doesn't like this world oh my again it's amazing that the Prophet would go on so long preaching a prisoner again not just this message but other messages so brother it's a further revelation of the mystery of the seven seals we got this mystery in that mystery do we have this mystery that we are prisoners of Christ amen and if we are addicted to the things of God we're under the control of the spirit of hunger and thirst and thought and thought rather in thought word and deed to continually reflect Jesus Christ in our thoughts in our words and in our deeds that's what we want to do whether say you're in your job again no matter where it is whatever you say will express God in thought word and deed you know it is unfortunate that most professing believers are more addicted to the natural things of life rather than the spiritual things of God the prophet of God said sometimes I speak rough to the people but he said you've got to cut loose the worldly things things and become a prisoner to Christ amazing and amazing keep cutting loose until the last lines are cut loose amen he said I speak rough but you got to cut loose the worldly things and become a prisoner to Christ and keep cutting loose onto the last lines are cut amen bear with me in the message Paul a prisoner hear the word of the Lord the prophet of God was pray let me share with you a few thoughts before he gets into the text of being a prisoner and he says speak to us Lord and warm our heartstrings that we would know how to discipline ourselves not discipline somebody else discipline yourself a man and discipline ourselves heesu for the great time that lays ahead as we believe we are making are nearing rather the coming of the Lord and we thank thee for people now beginning to find faith dear to them and knowing what faith means or to many faith is just I believe in God no it's believing God is believing the word believing this revelation that revelation amen this is what pleases God if you believe what he reveals to you a man so he said they're beginning to find faith dear to them and knowing what faith means and knowing you so we are thinking you law for our thanking you for services yet ahead and believing it you're going to do something Lord we're waiting with anticipation like the days of old believing that the time is near when you're going to just raise up the windows of heaven and pour Oh promises that God has promised in the last days and that's what God has done brother he's poured it out by the grace of God amen and continuing in prayer he said chasing us Lord oh you pray that you want the Lord to chasing you correct you chasing us Lord with thy spirit chasing us but thy word that we might discipline ourselves obedient servants again discipline yourself what for to get you to line up with the word of God your heavenly Father as you discipline your children to line up with with with your with your instructions as their father and mother or grandfather and grandmother he said let us remember and try to think in our hearts what the early Christian did what type of people we meet if we met those who had personally been in contact with you how their lives must have been the Living Word of God just written a pistils read of all men as they walked in among the people Amen just think they were the word well this is the word yeah that's written in a book but you're the Word made flesh a man it's Lord and what's written here and what I've just read concerning the right attitude right spirit right anointing the life of Christ and spawn that's what that's what you're going to reflect there's going to be the word in you is not oh we read it and it's there no no is there now yeah it was here now it's here God takes the word and makes the word flesh amen and he said may our lives be so submitted to thee that the Holy Spirit will live itself through us and speak through us Granite Lord may we remember in our minds as we walk upon the streets and rub arms with the world that were not supposed to be like those in the world no and we step aside and give them the place Lord and their rightful position here on earth and we'll take the back seat knowing we are delegates from another world and we have a kingdom that's coming into power Lord and our great king will soon arrive amen and will reign with him a thousand years and be with him forever amen god help us to believe what God is doing and that were a part of what he's doing amen and then he's working it out in you and in me by grace amen again he said I believe the Lord has somehow he'd given me a little say insight on the reasons why there are some people that are not healed I believe it's a lack of understanding and he said I believe and will speak on that Sunday morning he cares do you care you know most caring about their natural lives but not the spiritual he spy believed one of the great things that I find in this day is the lack of sincerity of what we believe and if God in the days of John Wesley would have done it in that day what he has done today what would it have done because they were so sincere amen in the days of Martin Luther as we as what we see I'm doing both proven by the church by the spirit by science and remove and he said God's Word here declaring it and telling it before it comes to pass and then moving upon and prophesying and doing the very things that he said would come to pass perfectly exactly what he said and still we sit kind of slothful as if we wonder wonder if that could be mean me wonder that could be just a church as a whole and what I if I'm really included in this I think Sunday morning I'll try to talk on some of those principles that might enlighten us a little and he preached the message again he cares do you care amen and then he moves on to the message Paul a prisoner I thought it's Lord maybe I should do his brotherly veil did a man and he someone said to me oh you're not a preacher I said no okay and all he said you're not like brother Vail he says he takes one message and he'll preach 70 70 messages on it and so on and I did like I said I preached a message one time and I preached 69 messages on that one thought one the revelation so I did say to somebody I said does that does that equal me with brother Vail a man Amen because you can go on and on and on and on with the revelation of the word by the grace of God a man so and brotherly Bell did take a message and he just took it one line at a time one line at a time and when he was finished he had preached sick or 70 messages on that one sermon see how the law the Lord will do it concerning Paul a prisoner and again I thought we'd just go through some thoughts here because I thought this was the only message that he was putting the emphasis on being a prisoner of Christ but I discovered that there was other messages and that he had mentioned being a prisoner of Christ over and over and over and over again and Justin in in just a maybe three or four messages or four or five messages that he had referenced being a prisoner of Christ oh my almost a hundred times I said Oh Lord it's a revelation that we need I said to to pay attention to a man we want to it's a revelation everybody need to take serious and to make sure that we are a prisoner of Christ we're not a prisoner to that or just to the message a prisoner to william branham because people call it they might call us random lights or whatever we're not we're Christians christ-like not random like any man there's too many our Brenham look and they want to follow this to follow that no no follow Christ because we didn't read him didn't point us to himself we didn't been appointed us to Jesus amen and again nearing the end of the of his ministry under seven seals if there's anything that he wanted to dilate was our relationship with Christ because I'll tell you this the only way we're going into rapture in the resurrection is that we got to enter into a oneness with our Lord Jesus Christ amen he's got to be not just our Savior he's got to be our Lord amen and brother he's the lord of the bright amen I pray that it's his lordship in control of you and again brother brown Stix was only just for five or six words when he read it there in the book of Philemon and we read it and he said Paul a prisoner of jesus christ and he stopped that's all he didn't read as much as i read today and he said that's what i want to use tonight as a text the Lord willing and I said why he wanted to preach on a prisoner and now he says you can hardly imagine Paul with Guardium self a prisoner a born free man filled with the Holy Ghost yet he calls himself a prisoner and now we find out that he's addressing the Corinthians as an apostle of Jesus Christ a man a servant of Jesus Christ and a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he said the prophet of God said Lord Jesus any man that's physically able can pull back the pages of the Bible but only the Holy Spirit can interpret it in the light that is meant to be a man we can read it and turn the pages and read it oh thank you Lord that's good yeah but we need the Holy Ghost to make it flesh in you and me we need the Holy Ghost to give us the revelation that we need of what we read amen so that he can apply it to our lives it's not not just storing it up in our heads no no it's planting the seed of the word in our hearts watering it continually so it's going to bring forth and bring forth and bring forth amen so he said Lord any man physically able can pull back the pages of this Bible but only the Holy Spirit can interpret it in the light that it's meant to be that's true we asked him to come and now help us understand he said this great mighty prophet Paul yet he called himself a prisoner and may the Holy Spirit reveal it to us as we wait on him in Jesus Christ's name a man then he went on and they listened to these thoughts and he said I can imagine Paul when he wrote his letter to Philemon how he was sitting in jail down there in the dungeon of this city a prisoner and he could well know by his position what the word meant and then again I believe that the Apostle meant just a little not exactly addressing it to his present condition as being a prisoner of his physical being sitting here in this jail but I believe he was referring to his spirit he said being a prisoner to Jesus Christ not a prisoner to the government not a prisoner to those that had put him in jail but he was a prisoner to Jesus a man and now he said we will all be born a free moral agent to make decisions he said we wish to God just justly does it because he must put every man on the same basis so he put the first man on the wrong basis he that he put on the free moral agent and he said we're just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve and there's no difference right or wrong that's either one of us and he's a life or death we can make our choice it's up to you the choice you make to accept it or reject it to believe it or not believe it what god is ministry he brings that I would be serious why because he discerns or sometimes we don't desert he saw what we didn't see you know well he preached this he's challenging the people's faith whether or not they were just you know prisoners to this or that or they prisoner of Jesus or they are they prisoners at all oh Christ has set me free Christ has done this Christ has done that yeah but free from sin to become a prisoner to him a man under his control and under his leadership if you're a prisoner you're under another control you're under somebody else's leadership not your own and for Paul it was Jesus well God already told him my grace is sufficient for you Paul don't don't ask you to do this don't ask me to do that you this you want that no law and all of that my grace is sufficient we want God to do this one God it listens my son my daughter my grace is sufficient to take you through all of that my grace is sufficient to help you to endure all these things know but there's so many believers they want everything they want the road paved in gold we're going somewhere streets shall be as pure gold but we wanted here and all we got it we got to endure this and suffer this to get there by the grace of God amen so as as your pastor I'm not here to condemn or to criticize you I'm here to share with you a revelation to challenge your thoughts or to challenge your faith or to get you to meditate on to get you to worry again to work out your salvation with fear and trembling make your calling and election sure and this is how you got to do it just could what judge yourself by the word Lord does that mean sorry Lord I don't mean to I don't mean to leave that I don't mean to admit that I don't mean to forget that lord I need I need more of your anointing or so so that I'm gonna go and live it I'm gonna go and reflect Jesus not just in my thoughts but in my words and my deeds and other people they want to reflect Jesus and their thoughts I sometimes and their words but not their deeds it's the life you live he's is up to you to make the choice he says your life will prove exactly what side you are on your life what you do how you do it when you do it the spirit and attitude you got that reflects the side you're on yeah he said I don't care what side you say you're on he said what you do every day proves what you are yeah it does he says you've heard the old saying he said your life is so loud I can't hear your testimony see your actions just speak so loud they meant is it reflecting the word the message god help us he said I've always believed in shouting and jumping but I've always said don't jump no higher than what you live amen because the world is going to watch that you must jump just as I usually so because somebody is watching you be on your guard amen don't reflect your own nature reflect Jesus it's not reflecting journalist they're not reflecting yet mark copier or your brother Weiser there no no it's reflecting Jesus oh I wanted to all this is me this is me no it's Jesus this is tremendous what a challenge to our faith what that what they see is Jesus not me not that one with that person that was born of this mother and father or this grandmother grandfather no no born again of Jesus amazing so he said don't jump any higher than you live because the world is going to watch that and see you must jump just as I usually so because somebody watching you and when people don't want from the church and some of them not coming our sincere people and they see so much corruption in the church until they don't want to have anything to do with it and many times we're speaking on a correct thought and you can't hardly blame them because the way people that call themselves Christians he said they're the greatest stumbling block in the world the world's God that's true you call yourself a Christian but you're not living like one you might reflect the church but not Jesus a man is the stumbling block and he said as a man and a woman who profess to be a Christian and lives something different from their professions now he said for the disappointments they'd be becoming at the judgment not now he said the sinner the bootlegger the gambler the adulteress he won't be to support it to hear his sentence read to depart into everlasting fire he won't be disappointed but that fellow who is trying to hide himself behind some kind of a church profession don't try to hide yourself behind the message of William Branham no where do we hide ourselves in Christ he said that's the boy that's going to be disappointed the day of judgement who is trying to hide himself behind the church or trying to hide himself behind the doctrine a third theology no it's got to be Christ in you the word all they ask the word the word the word yeah a me yeah well where's Jesus what do you mean is he in you do you think about it do you fellowship with him what no yeah if it's Christ in you you fellowship with him you go through the day and you and Chrysler are community you don't Christ our fellowship me yes that's right sister amen why because you're born again and his seed is in you his nature is in you and you're gonna communicate with him and he'll commit he wants to fellowship with you raise the Lord it's just like again the sister that was praying and praying and praying for a fellowship and this was a and real and so she got up one day and she was so lonely she could laid then under Scott and slept and the door rang oh she got up when they were looking for something no she said just go down the street did you get that they'll be good for you down there and then the door rang after a while I can ringing again she opened the door and there was a beggar there and he was looking for food oh no she said you go down the street you'll get some food dear that's fine and I don't know how many came to the door but finally at the end near the end I guess she said Lord you said you were going to come have ever supper with me a meal with me today but he said she said I've been waiting and she said you haven't come and the Lord said sister our daughter he said I'd knocked at your door two or three times today and you sent me on you're never invited me why she didn't recognize that as Jesus do you recognize your brother your sister as Jesus Christ oh she wouldn't she didn't want that one in she didn't want to invite the other one in no no no she took one she turned them down she turned down Jesus he came as a beggar to her door yeah god help us please that's rich but you better respect one another keep it right add two very spirit cuz you the Bible says you would entertain angels unaware how many have done that and not really entertain them but just push them out god help us real is God to us probably God did say it's going to go on and on and on in the last days until it said you're very faith in God it's going to be tested and challenged oh yeah your faith do you really believe in God he said it's better for him to that he never did make any kind of a profession than the saves a Christian but not live as a Christian always he said don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles he said we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word he's a look back and take an inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live is now bearing well are you bringing forth the life of Christ and the problem referred to a mirror and you see a reflection in the mirror he told about the story of the young boy that had not ever seen a mirror until he went to a certain house with his mother and he was walking around and all of a sudden he walked past a mirror he saw somebody in the mirror and two finally he went back and he did this and he did that do that so did the guy in the mirror and he went back he said oh he said mom that looks like me it would the reflection was him but he didn't know because he didn't know anything about mirrors he says me and it was so now it's Jesus Jesus can look in that mirror and see himself in anyway oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen are you the mirror of the revealed word reflecting Christ amen the question walk past you and oh praise the Lord I'm there I made pleasure that one that's myself amen and he said I said that too we too are reflecting something our life is reflected and if we lived in the days of Noah what side would we had to take it in the days of Moses what side on the days of Elijah the Prophet when all the world was gulped up in a great mass of modernism they met would you have taken the site up molarity or would you have stood with Elijah amazing and in the days of the Lord Jesus what side would you have taken your life that you live now reflects now just what you would have done them because you still possess with the same spirit see he said the devil takes his spirit he just goes off from one man to another God never takes his spirit he said it goes from one to another so the very spirit that was on the on Elijah came on Elijah and the one that John the Baptist so forth the Holy Spirit that was about Christ came upon his disciples and still on the people so God never takes his spirit so there we are left to make a choice and I can't see here where Paul was regretting anything saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he was addressing himself I believe he said as he wrote this letter with the pen that was the and it was the Holy Spirit causing him to write it and he said that maybe even to this night that we might call out of the text to show why Paul did this and I believe that sitting in this dingy old jail that Paul wrote it calling air that his brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could express it by seeing what was around him now he was in jail but that wasn't what he was speaking to his servant of Christ have Minister with him he speaking that he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ because Christ is the word amen bear with me I won't be able to go through all of it because I want to I hate the fact that it's not the prisoner in the jail it's the prisoner in the word and you'll come a prison prisoner to the word and to highlight again to bring out what he's emphasizing here in these other messages after in July in August 63 and brother is emphasizing emphasizing emphasizing Christians or prisoners Christians are prisoners they're prisoners of Jesus Christ and he's challenging the people's faith are you a prisoner oh yeah one of those message book summary brings out now this quote but another quote somewhere might be Crystal Christ the mystery of God revealed there was a great three full purpose of Christ to express himself identify himself with human beings and to reveal himself in Christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is is bright that he might live in the people and he could do that in a domani but sin separated them so now here had to be somewhere to get back again by the grace of God amen but again it's not the quote that I was thinking of believe it we'll find it amen by the grace of God it's a serious quote concerning being a prisoner of Christ if you're not a prisoner of Christ or not a Christian maybe not a person of Christ you're not the right no no because to be a prisoner you're going to follow the one that you're a prisoner to he's got control he's going to do this he's going to do that he's going to do that in your life amen grace of God therefore he said Paul was a prisoner from his objective that he had in life and he became a prisoner of Jesus Christ who was the word and he said the words of Damascus changed Paul a man has the word changed you that some of the Saints here that received the word forty years ago as it changed you now not it's not just to like I said to public God says you can come out of a church and still and still at the same spirit still be be a church person because you got the spirit of that church but brother if you really come out by the word you leave that spirit behind a man you get into the word and you got the spirit of the word amen that's right amazing the probably God recognize many a commodity denominations but they're still part of it because they still had denominational spirits he said oh my what the prophet knew and what the prophet saw what the Prophet realized and like he said I got not see my heart he said by the way I'll go to my grave he'll take it to his grave you wouldn't tell them oh I guess there are certain things he could tell us that would frighten us I would what's going on in the world now he's prophesied it as we mentioned in our talking with our fellowship with our brother David concerning this someone got sick with this got sick with this Sigma this rule well the prophet of God said there's gonna be a germ warfare oh yeah Satan's come down with drat and that's why he's causing this and causing this and causing that and so on and God let him do it but brother I trust by the grace of God will be like Jo and all the in all this job didn't see him he didn't charge God foolishly he didn't blame it on God no not but not by any means but but the Christian goes forth by faith trusting the Lord Amen and I know it's unfortunate that that too many are getting caught up with the tree of knowledge of good and evil that's the internet the internet is a tree of knowledge of good and evil brother whatever we get involved with there or what do we see there while we contact there stay with the word and keep your faith moving forward because they're going by what going by this going by that but they're not going by faith or they believe this oh yeah I believe that yeah but one with the word do you bleeds word god help us ever an hour that our faith is being challenged our faith in God is this our he said the road to Damascus changed Paul going down he's at about 11 o'clock perhaps for the day that he was stricken down and he heard a voice Saul why persecutest thou me and he looked up and looking up being a Jew and knew that the pillar of fire was the Lord and that had led the children of Israel because he knew that was what it was basically must mean something terrific for Paul he said to find out that all at once he had been persecuting his ambitions that Drott him further away from the main thing that he meant to do and and what a great shock it must have been to the apostille when he said he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us the very one that he was persecuting why persecutest thou me another little quotation we ought to drop in here he said you see as they make fun of the church they're not really making in front of the church they're making fun of Jesus why persecutest thou me how could paul then with all of his intellect believe that this was this this group that he was persecuting was the very god that he was claiming to serve and i think he said without going in the detail I think we're all well trained enough to know what I mean here he said the same thing is happening today and that's the truth there are those that will persecute the truth persecute the word and persecute the bride he said what a thing it must have been for Paul he said now he knew that he had an experience see here is another good lesson for us that experience alone isn't enough it's got to be an experience according to the Word of God a man where's your experience according to the word so once seeing this and knowing that it was a great something that somebody else had received it before him he took three years and six months down in a desert in Arabia taking the Bible as it was then and going down there to compare this experience that he had and see if it was scriptural yeah after he had that experience he went three years and studied the word over three years see three years and a half down there lay lying in the word and finding out that the very God that called him was taking him back and changing all of his intellect changing all that he ever thought all that he was trained to be just wiped it away from him and he become a prisoner the love of God has been so tremendous and such a revelation that he could not get away from it that's the true experience of every believer who meets God Amen it's a revelation of the divine love of God amen today a service of Christ we become ernest hooked up and we can't go without it being an artist to the word no matter what anybody else says you are earnest to the word and he so there's something about it that you just can't get away from and he had leaned on the backside of the arabian desert with all the former things and experiences and ambitions and he been stripped of those things and now that's where we find today that we must be stripped first and people don't want to be stripped the methodist brother wants to hold a little of his methodist teaching the baptist brother wants all a little bit of his baptist teaching but he's you've got to be absolutely be stripped of everything and just born again afresh and take up from here as the Holy Spirit leads you you can't say well my daddy said when he got it in the church he shook hands with the pastor he's a real good loyal member that might have been all right for his race but we're in another race a man we come back to the Bible times for this day the priest was honest too but you see they come over into the another dispensation and they failed to strip off their old Ernests and put a new ernest and the same thing we find a day we did come through a denominational age and we as we through the church ages the Bible and so forth but he said we have come to a free age where the Holy Spirit Himself comes down vindicates himself makes himself known makes every promise that he promises come to pass what a great time we're living in he knew he could not go to places that being honest to this ambitious missions drew him amongst brethren where he was invited to come and yet he was pressed in the spirit it wasn't his own he was a prisoner a finish here well God make us prisoners from our own selfish ambition from our own judgments and our better way of thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ amen I think that was a great statement that Paul made I am a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen now he said he could not go certain places that he wanted because why did the spirit forbade him he was a prisoner of Christ you remember many times that I was trying to go someplace thinking there is where I could have a great meeting but the Spirit forbade him amen and brother sometimes we have failed to do this bill to do that but the Holy Ghost is there if we're a prison of Christ the Holy Ghost is there to stop us amen not to do our own will but to do the will of God the whole host is there as we are prisoners of Christ to keep us in the will of God by the grace of God amen and he addressed it to the venom tyrannical he said Oh tonight if we as the Branham tabernacle could only become prisoners to our selfish means to our own ambition that we could completely surrender ourselves and be yoked to Christ no matter what the rest of the world thinks while the rest of the world does we are yoked with fitters of love we are prisoners and my feet are yoked to Christ amen he said it turns my head my heart is so yoked to him and in love to him I can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yoked to him till I don't even know what my ambitions are just whatever you lead I'll follow Lord I will be a pretty a man not my will don't be done amen grace of God that we are Lord willing eventually finished the quotes in Paula prisoner but again to follow the same thought in the message on Christ as the mystery of God revealed and perfect faith amen thank God and brother it's another mystery of the seven seals I believe God did this because just shortly after this as I said the Lord said brother branham that's it that's it that's finished now he said go back into evangelism and he did until the Lord took him home amen thank God for the word this day again just make sure we keep all the Saints in prayer and it's an including our brother Bob's sister Brenda and brother Matthew and sister amber the family as they travel to Komori god bless them amen
