[10:21] let's just read and then we can sit just
[10:24] going to read verses last time the uh 21
[10:29] it's
[10:33] all
[10:41] hello Revelation 1 verse
[10:44] 1-6 and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[10:47] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[10:49] Earth were passed away and there was no
[10:51] more sea and I saw John and I John saw
[10:55] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[10:58] from God out of heav have been prepared
[11:00] as a bride adorned and I heard a great
[11:03] voice out of the heaven saying behold
[11:06] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[11:08] will dwell with them and they shall be
[11:11] his people and God himself says there
[11:14] God
[11:16] himself that he goes in no other no
[11:20] other form and the end I will give unto
[11:23] him that is the thirst of the
[11:25] found of
[11:27] Life May
[11:30] thank the Lord for the reading of his
[11:32] word so again I'm just going to
[11:39] again
[11:42] finish hopes to be finished I did make
[11:44] some changes just so that we could see
[11:46] and read better the other church was
[11:48] definitely different is what I was more
[11:50] used to in terms of smaller that you
[11:52] could uh weren't far from the screen and
[11:55] things but even I just had a lot of
[11:56] trouble reading it uh myself down the
[11:59] back back so it does make more more
[12:01] slides but it's just not as condensed as
[12:04] all so this uh this message particularly
[12:08] is from two messages it's from Mostly
[12:11] from future home of the USC Biden Biden
[12:13] guide Grom and uh I just referred to his
[12:16] future home and also uh the other one is
[12:20] Harvest Time which is only a couple of
[12:22] days after so he kind of flows into the
[12:24] other one uh which he which is so easy
[12:27] to do that you're run the same thoughts
[12:30] into the next message and that's what he
[12:32] did so it's kind of a two-part thing it
[12:34] happens often so we're just thankful for
[12:37] uh and it's it's just amazing uh how it
[12:42] is weaved in there in the future home
[12:44] the these thoughts about the Plan of
[12:47] Redemption in there he it's just because
[12:49] he's got a couple of different topics
[12:51] and it just it just pecks in every right
[12:54] to it's a long message and it goes in
[12:56] from early in the message right till
[12:58] later in the message and it's uh it's
[13:01] just uh really it's it's like U uh the
[13:06] word in due season you know it's just uh
[13:09] when he preached when he preached about
[13:11] that like food in due season and and
[13:14] when there was just things that were
[13:16] stored up word was stored up and it was
[13:19] just let released and let go uh you know
[13:23] over time because you just couldn't take
[13:25] it all in so these things come out and
[13:28] you hear them and you hear the Ministry
[13:29] talking about things and a lot of times
[13:31] they're saying the same thing is because
[13:32] this stuff with the opening of the
[13:34] seventh seel it just it just made it all
[13:38] clear you know and we we all see it
[13:40] ourselves now how God does it how he's
[13:42] back and forth in Ang it Compares as an
[13:45] angel and uh you know I just read a
[13:48] scripture to here uh a quote to her the
[13:51] other day I should have probably brought
[13:52] it but it it was Jesus Christ same
[13:55] yesterday and today and forever and
[13:57] brother Brandon was saying you know I
[13:58] just had so I said I prayed about this
[14:00] and I talked to the angel of the Lord so
[14:02] much about it you know he says it's so
[14:05] casually you
[14:08] know it's just wonderful that he can
[14:11] have that relationship with Christ like
[14:13] that you know in the angel of the Lord
[14:15] you
[14:17] know so here we see the two the two he
[14:21] had to split it for a time it was it was
[14:23] an end and a beginning and an end and it
[14:26] would eventually end there there would
[14:28] be no more time so we're living in that
[14:31] now and we know
[14:38] it
[14:41] oh okay just leave there and it dropped
[14:44] down to a space of time for the trying
[14:47] and the perfecting and for the purging
[14:49] of the loss that God by his Sovereign
[14:51] Grace might someday lift that little
[14:54] hickey or Gap or time back into the
[14:56] perfect
[14:57] circle then she
[14:59] then she rolls on just the same you see
[15:01] see once it time is over it just starts
[15:04] it's just eternity again it's like that
[15:06] forever and never happen again it's all
[15:08] for a reason right and he said like he
[15:11] said here it's what I just read it's the
[15:13] reason was for the trying and perfecting
[15:16] and for the purging of the lost that God
[15:19] by his Sovereign Grace might someday
[15:20] lift that that God of his Sovereign
[15:23] Grace might someday lift that little
[15:25] hickey or Gap back into the perfect
[15:27] circle so like I say we're we're Sons
[15:30] and Daughters of God the Angels didn't
[15:32] have to go through this we were we were
[15:34] bypassed our theophan and went right in
[15:37] here into flesh into a sinful time
[15:40] sinful time there below as as as was
[15:43] created by God in that time created
[15:46] meaning having a beginning and an end
[15:48] but the Angels didn't do that the Angels
[15:50] didn't have to do that they were just
[15:52] Servants of God they did they don't they
[15:55] never would appreciate like we do the
[15:57] salvation and the Redemption that we we
[16:00] go through what we had to go through all
[16:02] the Christians when they get to heaven
[16:04] they they would never understand it
[16:05] right this is when Jesus came in flesh
[16:08] in these spaces made flesh and came
[16:10] through here in order to sanctify or put
[16:13] a streak of blood all across this place
[16:14] to redeem it and connect it back with
[16:17] God again for all eternity you see it
[16:19] there's Plan of Redemption right
[16:22] wonderful and all the all the when he
[16:25] created this he created that Loop of
[16:26] time and all the seed were in the Earth
[16:29] so they were everyone that was going to
[16:31] everyone that was his was in the Earth
[16:33] at that time and of course the Earth is
[16:35] a part also of of God it was in the
[16:38] thoughts of God so if you were in the
[16:40] thoughts of God at the beginning you
[16:42] were put here in the earth when he
[16:44] created the Earth right in Genesis so
[16:47] where you know the Earth was the same
[16:49] the Earth was the thought the Earth will
[16:50] always be the Earth will never not be
[16:53] it'll never it didn't have a it didn't
[16:55] have a beginning because it was in the
[16:57] thought of God just like we were right
[17:00] and you see that alter the seals
[17:01] especially the six seal is just
[17:03] something that's not destroyed same as
[17:05] us is not destroyed but we're we're
[17:07] purified we're clean and then brought in
[17:10] so the Earth is it's an it's a thought
[17:14] of God
[17:15] God and
[17:18] owns so just this quote so just this
[17:20] quote here so just this quote here that
[17:22] I read this quote here that I read last
[17:24] qu here I read last time again I read
[17:25] last time again this is last time again
[17:27] this is from har again this is from
[17:28] Harvest Time this is from Harvest Time
[17:30] which is right after and I want to bring
[17:32] you bring you conscience conscious of
[17:36] that before we approach further that God
[17:39] is in this room the author of this this
[17:42] word is here so he's he's with his word
[17:47] so it doesn't matter how you are dressed
[17:49] or what degree you live in Life or what
[17:52] kind of home you live in or what type of
[17:55] care you drive or how much education
[17:57] you've got God looks at your heart and
[18:00] he looks in my heart and we're judged
[18:03] from our heart not even our words our
[18:05] heart judges us from the heart speaketh
[18:07] the mouth if it isn't it's hypocrisy
[18:14] right so it's it's I just want to just
[18:18] do the review quickly not get too bogged
[18:20] down but it's uh it's just wonderful
[18:22] it's just like David he was a man after
[18:25] God's Own Heart and and David would pray
[18:28] he say you know listen to me you know
[18:29] look at my heart and that's that's what
[18:31] it because you know that's what what God
[18:33] sees right the rest is the Flesh and the
[18:36] flesh is never be will never be purified
[18:40] or in or clean or holy in the sight of
[18:44] God we you'll have it right till you
[18:46] leave it you're always going to have
[18:49] it so so here uh we're familiar with
[18:53] this and I just use it again because uh
[18:56] it just it just shows in terms of in the
[19:00] in the Old Testament and the the Jews
[19:03] they
[19:04] U they they had this the the feast here
[19:08] that they followed every year and they
[19:09] did it for 1,600 years under the law and
[19:12] it was it was for something but they
[19:14] lose side of that it's just so easy for
[19:16] humans to do that you know we get on a
[19:18] path we like and we can just go forever
[19:20] and it a lot of times we don't like to
[19:23] change right and in the case it's a case
[19:25] of everyone you know just there's some
[19:27] things you just don't want to change but
[19:29] God God has a plan and he sees a change
[19:32] coming and he gives he starts to work on
[19:34] you and you're kind of you know it's is
[19:37] you know sometimes not so easy to make a
[19:39] change right and especially in the uh in
[19:43] the Old Testament in the New Testament
[19:45] and B often said that you know it takes
[19:48] a prophet to to take a turn you know we
[19:51] can go straight and keep doing what we
[19:53] have to do and go straight but it takes
[19:54] a prophet to come and make a turn and to
[19:57] do God's will you know to shows the way
[19:59] to go so here you know the the the uh
[20:04] the feast went on for 1600 years and
[20:06] they did the same thing they go through
[20:08] this you know Passover and that
[20:11] represents the lamb that you see it back
[20:13] in Exodus and when uh the children of
[20:16] Israel were leaving Egypt and where they
[20:19] started to do these things and They
[20:21] carried it on forever right up until the
[20:24] person came along that was going to
[20:25] fulfill this right and and the Jews
[20:28] could not come Rend that that here now
[20:30] we have a Passover and it's not a lamb
[20:32] like an animal this is the real capital
[20:35] L lamb that has come now is going to
[20:38] fulfill this and once it's fulfilled
[20:41] it's over right you don't have to do it
[20:43] again you know and we know that now and
[20:47] Peter knew it but a lot of Jews didn't
[20:49] you know and it said it RI ripped the
[20:51] veil that was in the temple from top to
[20:53] bottom and these veils were huge right
[20:55] and heavy and hard but they just went in
[20:57] and fixed it and went out but Jesus was
[21:00] God was showing that you know this was
[21:02] fulfilled you don't need this anymore
[21:03] you we're not going to do it this way
[21:05] anymore well what way are you going to
[21:06] do it well the way Peter did it Peter
[21:09] was a Jew right and he had the
[21:11] Revelation and he came out and told him
[21:13] look this is all fulfilled we don't have
[21:16] to do this anymore now here's what we're
[21:17] going to do and they they remember this
[21:20] Passover in in in in the uh communion
[21:24] and the foot washing and things like
[21:25] that that's how we remember it we don't
[21:27] have to do it like they do like like the
[21:30] Jews do and kill a lamb to show that
[21:33] they that was over that was finished but
[21:36] you know it's still carried on with so
[21:38] many people doing it but the what God
[21:41] was expecting is what he saw in the Acts
[21:43] of the Apostles right and that's what
[21:45] happened and that's what we carry on
[21:47] today and that's what we need to do
[21:49] because it like we said it's it was U it
[21:52] was a revelation and Peter had a firm
[21:54] Revelation he had the Holy Spirit there
[21:56] right and he knew what was
[21:59] what was required so this goes on here
[22:01] and it goes up in I put in a holy
[22:03] convocation because that is U that that
[22:07] was really representing the Eighth Day
[22:10] and so God comes and fulfills the feast
[22:12] the Feast of the Lord Leviticus 23
[22:15] forever once and for all so the Jews
[22:19] after the U Pentecost then there really
[22:23] it was uh it's quiet in the Jewish
[22:26] tradition with these feast days it was
[22:28] was quiet but really you know the the uh
[22:32] Revelation and the carrying out of that
[22:35] was in the Gentiles through the seven
[22:37] Church ages and the Seven Seals that's
[22:39] what that was the type of was the
[22:42] Gentile Church coming into uh God's body
[22:46] so that's that's what happened then and
[22:48] then it comes back into on on on the uh
[22:52] later months in the fall feasts and you
[22:54] see the trumpets the atonement and the
[22:56] and the Tabernacles is what really what
[23:00] the the 144,000 is going to see
[23:02] fulfilled in this and they won't have to
[23:04] do it no more it'll be done it'll be all
[23:06] finished you know so that's uh that's
[23:09] the next thing in line for us and I I I
[23:12] did a whole series on that a few years
[23:14] ago if you remember no you don't but
[23:16] probably but but we went into it quite
[23:19] deep each one of those uh feasts and
[23:20] that
[23:22] right so trying to move along that's my
[23:26] what I just said so the Feast of
[23:29] trumpets the Holy Spirit has been bound
[23:32] by these denominational Rivers for
[23:34] almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed
[23:36] in the evening time so this is
[23:38] a you know a quote that said a lot and
[23:41] this brother R talks about this in terms
[23:43] of after 2,000 years of
[23:47] denominational systems and the the uh
[23:51] the way the the word was hacked up then
[23:54] God and was really at in the seventh in
[23:57] the last day
[23:59] was when that the U uh uh Christ with
[24:04] the word Christ being is is loosed is no
[24:06] longer sealed up under denominational
[24:09] teaching and thinking is no longer like
[24:11] that and denominations brother ban was
[24:13] against denominations he was all against
[24:15] always against denominations and
[24:17] rightfully so because denominations just
[24:20] just separate right they they get a few
[24:24] Believers together and few unbelievers
[24:26] probably and few make believers and they
[24:29] create their own denomination and their
[24:31] own way that God wants us to do things
[24:36] the way that they interpret the word and
[24:38] they build a fence around it and there's
[24:40] no there's no uh uh Fellowship then with
[24:44] any other Christians only the ones that
[24:46] believe that way and we know now there's
[24:48] something like
[24:49] 33,000 denominations and various of
[24:52] various uh different kind of uh
[24:56] organizations up to 33,000 that are just
[24:59] separated from each other and brother
[25:01] Brandon was against it you know totally
[25:03] he was saying you know this is the body
[25:05] and the body needs to be uh you know in
[25:08] fellowship and denominations are keeping
[25:11] us out of Fellowship so you know this is
[25:14] what happened in ' 63 is that you know
[25:17] the uh uh the the full word came it was
[25:21] loosed under those denominations and the
[25:24] full word came into place and and then
[25:27] the bride was called I call you no more
[25:29] church I call you bride right and I
[25:32] remember to this day reading that where
[25:35] I was and it it was just an amazing
[25:38] statement but and it was a big turning
[25:40] point for the church because now you're
[25:43] no longer Church your bride he was
[25:45] finished he was outside the door
[25:47] knocking right he couldn't get in in
[25:49] Revelation three and that's that was
[25:51] that fulfilled right there you know in
[25:53] that for from then on and when the bride
[25:56] was going to be called
[25:59] uh so but to be loosed in the evening
[26:03] time by the evening time light the Holy
[26:05] Spirit back in the church again Christ
[26:07] himself revealed in human flesh in the
[26:09] evening time he said he promised it so
[26:12] after 2,000 years that was done the word
[26:15] being set free and we're the benefactors
[26:17] of all of that amen and I'm
[26:24] thankful from the future home and all
[26:27] our bodies that we live in now was put
[26:29] on the earth when God created because
[26:32] you're out of the Dust of the Earth
[26:34] Earth it was all laid out there when God
[26:36] himself created it and were in in his
[26:40] thinking and in in him the great Eternal
[26:42] was the thought which is his attribute
[26:46] right so you you see here it's God
[26:48] himself he's only by himself everything
[26:50] that he's created now is all separated
[26:52] from him because of sin so God himself
[26:55] can't go in there and the people that
[26:56] are in that that
[27:00] a realm of time can't go in to the realm
[27:03] of Eternity you know you can't go into
[27:05] that realm of Eternity because you have
[27:08] to be holy it have to be totally holy
[27:09] and we're not in that state because it
[27:11] his body right so here he is totally
[27:15] separated so he he begins this is the
[27:18] beginning here where he he's he's he's
[27:22] got to lay out a Plan of Redemption like
[27:24] how all my people are over there they're
[27:26] separated from me so how am I going to
[27:28] get those back there and how am I going
[27:31] to get in there so we all get back
[27:33] together and that's the plan the Plan of
[27:37] Redemption so how will he bring his seed
[27:40] back to Eternity in the condition
[27:41] they're in what is the plan everything
[27:43] created on Earth resides in time under
[27:45] Adam and Eve God himself is not not with
[27:48] them in Genesis 3 after Adam and Eve
[27:50] were removed from the Garden of Eden
[27:51] they were removed and brother randam
[27:53] even alludes that Adam really didn't
[27:55] have full understanding of what happened
[27:57] back there it was like was he was
[27:58] blinded of it so he is in eternity Adam
[28:01] and Eve are in time and two different
[28:04] Realms so that's that's where it's all
[28:06] now starting and he's got to he's got to
[28:08] put a plan in to get them back so what's
[28:11] the plan he knows the
[28:17] plan so I I this is small I know and
[28:20] it's hard it's just a little timeline
[28:22] shown Old Testament here and feast in
[28:25] the feast and nothing really changed in
[28:26] the Old Testament there wasn't there was
[28:29] there wasn't anything God did go he did
[28:31] go in a form and he would go in and he
[28:33] would go to Joshua and he would go to
[28:35] Moses and he would go you know to Gideon
[28:38] or all of these prophets he would go to
[28:41] them and in a form and he would create
[28:43] something that was holy that he could go
[28:45] in and then go into time that's how he
[28:47] did it he could never go
[28:49] himself and and when when people died
[28:53] who are in time they went to a place and
[28:56] we know it was uh it was it was under
[28:59] there was seems to be uh a place where
[29:03] uh the the the ones who were not
[29:06] children of God were heing and there was
[29:07] a great Gulf fixed and then there was
[29:10] other people because you know uh you
[29:12] could see it that they could see AC
[29:14] cross you know in the scriptures you
[29:15] could see in the gospels they could see
[29:17] over there but when Jesus now died and
[29:19] Rose they were taken from them and went
[29:20] to paradise and they went to another
[29:22] place and that was never the case after
[29:24] once Jesus died but but they could never
[29:26] go into that presence of God
[29:28] they never could because they couldn't
[29:30] they still didn't have their body they
[29:32] still didn't have their body it was
[29:33] still in the earth and still couldn't uh
[29:37] uh couldn't go through that change in
[29:39] order that they could go into the
[29:40] presence of God's holiness God
[29:44] himself so that that's what what
[29:46] happened here we see the uh and we
[29:49] wenter this just to go quickly the seven
[29:51] sabbaths at at at the
[29:54] resurrection and of at Calvary and then
[29:57] we went into to the Pentecost which was
[29:59] the 50th day and that's a holy
[30:02] convocation and as it says here
[30:06] below so there's the holy convocation
[30:09] the Holy Fire And The Eighth Day soul is
[30:11] the Eternal uh rain realm forever so in
[30:16] the Holy convocation that's a that's an
[30:19] eighth day and original day that's the
[30:21] Eternal day Jews were required to
[30:22] sacrifice Animals by fire for their holy
[30:24] day but it just didn't work the same
[30:27] until Peter realize it the first one the
[30:30] 120 who went into the upper room went
[30:33] through that Holy convocation which was
[30:35] a a burning and they were totally burnt
[30:37] out from that and received the Holy
[30:39] Spirit they were burnt out by a holy
[30:41] convocation you have to have it the Holy
[30:43] Fire and the Earth has to have it
[30:45] everything that goes back is going to go
[30:47] back up into that eternity realm has to
[30:51] have that Holy convocation and it's the
[30:53] Eighth
[30:54] Day and and then there's also so in the
[30:59] Holy communication there was three
[31:01] elements here and uh that had to be
[31:04] brought to their Eighth Day or back to
[31:06] the first day the original day the
[31:08] Eternal day so it's the Eternal day
[31:09] there's no more no more sevens no more
[31:13] after this once they go through the
[31:14] eighth you're into eternity once you've
[31:16] reached the E Peter was in that Eternal
[31:19] day his soul was in that Eternal day it
[31:22] was in in eternity so the first one
[31:25] first one has to be your soul
[31:28] and then the second one is the Earth and
[31:30] then there was an eighth day for the
[31:32] word of God and we just mentioned that
[31:34] one so it is the end of the seven
[31:36] sabbaths with the baptism of the Holy
[31:38] Ghost and now your soul is in the
[31:39] Eternal day Peter was in
[31:42] eternity amen so we we got that already
[31:45] from from the
[31:48] uh from the last time brother Brian says
[31:51] and notice after 50 days he's explaining
[31:54] this now what happened during that that
[31:56] first day in the day of when the Holy
[31:58] Ghost came down when it came out of the
[32:00] upper room and notice after 50 days or
[32:03] seven sabbaths from here again there
[32:06] come another holy convocation what
[32:08] happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[32:10] of Pentecost the eighth day there was
[32:12] seven sabbaths later 8th day after the
[32:15] seven sabbaths 49 exactly after his
[32:18] resurrection so it had be seven times
[32:20] that again and bring it right back
[32:22] around to the first day of the week
[32:24] again exactly so that's a holy
[32:26] congregation that's an day an original
[32:28] day that's an eternal day and that's why
[32:31] it can never be changed what Peter said
[32:33] can never be altered repent and be
[32:35] baptized he said that on that Eternal
[32:38] day it'll never be changed that can't be
[32:40] altered you can't sidestep and turn
[32:42] around that that's part of the Holy
[32:44] convocation that's part of the mystery
[32:46] of redemption that was laid out everyone
[32:49] has to be B repent and be baptized in
[32:52] the name of the Lord Jesus that's simple
[32:55] but not a lot of people doing it right
[32:58] so the Old Testament continued on the
[33:00] blood sacrifice of the Lamb covered
[33:02] their sins God was revealing himself and
[33:04] God came down in the form of man Jesus
[33:06] Christ so now it's all changed it took a
[33:08] huge change that's why Calvary is so
[33:10] important and we went through that all
[33:12] last time but that quote there brother
[33:13] ROM is saying the same thing I'm saying
[33:16] I
[33:17] hope and
[33:20] pray so I'm really going through
[33:23] the
[33:26] this so of 50 day the Holy Holy Ghost
[33:29] fell on the day of Pentecost and the
[33:31] 50th day sorry about the small I tried
[33:33] to make it a bit bigger it's an eternal
[33:35] Day end of Sabbath your your soul is an
[33:39] eternal day Born Again of the spirit of
[33:42] God and act so we see now the
[33:46] soul what happened with Peter is the
[33:48] soul went into eternity he was in his
[33:51] body but his soul now was was was was
[33:54] eternal because it had hit that e so
[33:57] that's that's why you feel the way you
[33:59] do or sense the way you do or you know
[34:03] because your soul is part of that
[34:04] Eternal it it you you received by the
[34:07] Holy Ghost you've received the Holy Fire
[34:10] you've ref you you've received the Holy
[34:12] convocation so you're you that's all
[34:15] redeemed it's all Eternal and the beauty
[34:18] of it that it's it's in it's in that
[34:21] Eternal part and the devil can't get at
[34:23] it there's no way it can get at it God
[34:26] has you've gone through the judgment
[34:28] you've gone you've gone through it all
[34:30] your soul is is in there will the flesh
[34:33] still will it will the flesh still have
[34:36] trouble the flesh will still have
[34:38] trouble why because it's in the element
[34:40] of time it has not received uh uh uh a
[34:44] holy fire a holy convocation and never
[34:47] will it will never reach it but your
[34:49] soul praise God is in that Eternal realm
[34:53] right and God doesn't see it he doesn't
[34:56] see he doesn't see everybody days
[34:58] anymore what he I sinned yesterday uh he
[35:01] he doesn't go by days he doesn't
[35:03] understand it he he I guess he
[35:06] understands it but he doesn't work work
[35:08] with that he works with eternity this is
[35:11] dumb I can't even see it God can't even
[35:14] see you you know it's all
[35:16] finished there's no way it can be held
[35:18] against you you're going to come up and
[35:20] you've already you've gone through what
[35:22] he wanted you to do I'm doing my plan
[35:26] and I your it's your time time you get
[35:28] the holy you get the holy uh you get the
[35:31] Revelation you get the holy convocation
[35:34] you get the Holy Fire and you're brought
[35:36] into his presence into eternity you're
[35:39] taken away from the devil's presence he
[35:41] can't get at you he can get at your
[35:43] flesh but you know that right you know
[35:46] you see he get he can get at your mind
[35:49] right but you know you can be very happy
[35:52] today to know that you're you're your
[35:56] you're if you're if if you got the Holy
[35:58] Spirit then you're in that presence of
[36:00] the Eternal you're back there where you
[36:02] came from right CU that's where you
[36:05] started you're always in the the mind of
[36:08] God and now the work is done so now okay
[36:11] it's like the symphony I'm a note I'm
[36:12] done he goes on he just goes on right so
[36:15] you're just waiting you're doing what he
[36:17] needs you to do here maybe it's another
[36:19] Soul or whatever it is he needs you to
[36:21] do and that's you're doing it but it's
[36:23] over it's wonderful it's just you got to
[36:26] have the revelation of it
[36:28] right it's part of the doesn't matter
[36:31] it's still done right it's it's part of
[36:33] the Holy convocation that's why people
[36:35] give testimonies right this is what
[36:36] happened me basically you didn't get
[36:38] saved there you were you were always
[36:40] saved right God just want had to get you
[36:43] back that's all you know and that's and
[36:46] that's what you you felt at the altar is
[36:49] that you realize what happened you know
[36:51] God has come to get
[36:53] me it's part of the Holy congregation
[36:56] that was laid out
[37:01] laid out the Holy Fire the baptism of
[37:04] the Holy Spirit on the soul you must
[37:07] have Holy Fire not a
[37:09] handshake it it has to annihilate every
[37:12] Trace Satan has on you or you will or
[37:16] you will or will have on you has on you
[37:19] or will have on you it's not a man-made
[37:22] religion at this stage so it's not like
[37:25] if you're if you're going to a church
[37:26] and you shake hands and and then you
[37:27] just go on you carry on the same way and
[37:29] you come to church every Sunday it that
[37:32] doesn't happen you go through the Holy
[37:34] Fire you go through a total change of
[37:37] desires you don't have any of those
[37:39] desires anymore you don't do this do do
[37:41] these things anymore you you're
[37:44] congregating with a whole different PE
[37:45] set of people right you know you've
[37:47] taken you know it's not yourself but you
[37:50] come down it's just like me I came down
[37:52] the road and I hit a fork and I could
[37:54] carry on in the way I was living with
[37:56] the people I was living with or whatever
[37:58] or I go down this thing now I'm going to
[38:00] go any because you're predestinated you
[38:02] had no choice you're going anyway right
[38:04] but you know that that's what happens is
[38:06] is that you go through a separation and
[38:08] you're separated from those things right
[38:11] and that's the plan of his Plan of
[38:13] Redemption that's how he was planning to
[38:16] come back and get
[38:24] you it's not a man-made religion at this
[38:27] stage right right is not you're into the
[38:30] big leagues now
[38:34] right so
[38:37] here from the future home what happened
[38:40] Christ came and called the church to
[38:42] repentance baptism in the name of Jesus
[38:45] Christ and he's talking about right here
[38:46] now in Pentecost right what happened
[38:48] with Peter at that time and the other
[38:52] other in the upper room and those that
[38:53] were converted that that day baptism in
[38:55] the name of Jesus Christ for the the
[38:58] remission sanctify the church and with
[39:00] the fire of God come down and burn out
[39:02] all the filth and come and dwells in the
[39:05] human
[39:06] heart that because he made that that
[39:10] soul of yours holy so that he could
[39:13] dwell otherwise he couldn't and the only
[39:15] way he can do that is with the Holy Fire
[39:18] that's that's easy right that's easy to
[39:20] understand right that's how he could
[39:22] come into you into your soul because it
[39:25] was it received the Holy convocation the
[39:28] Eternal fire and that was we know in the
[39:31] Old Testament used to be a a Sacrifice
[39:33] by fire that's what they used to do was
[39:36] uh always sacrificed an animal by fire
[39:39] and burnt it like the man was when he
[39:42] still had hatred Mal oh sorry I didn't
[39:45] get like the man was when he still had
[39:49] hatred malice and strife in him when the
[39:51] fire baptism come it cleaned it off no
[39:55] more jealousy no more of nothing it's
[39:57] just just absolutely is a dwelling place
[39:59] for God and remember that's his
[40:02] delegation that's going to meet him
[40:05] Yonder you
[40:07] know so and you can see the difference
[40:09] like it's it's paragraph 107 and he's
[40:11] saying the same thing in paragraph 284
[40:13] so this thing is all weaved into right
[40:16] into that message but you know it's uh
[40:20] it's it's just wonderful what God is
[40:24] doing with his people and you know he's
[40:27] he's not going to come back and get
[40:29] those that weren't in his mind in the
[40:31] foundation of the world he's not going
[40:32] to do it you know it's like like we
[40:35] always thought we always thought that
[40:37] every scripture that dealt with
[40:39] salvation uh applied to everyone but it
[40:42] didn't there's there's there's there's
[40:45] different types here there's the elect
[40:47] and the elect are the only ones that are
[40:49] going to get the Holy Ghost the the
[40:50] elect are only the only ones that are in
[40:52] the Plan of Redemption they're the only
[40:54] ones that will receive the Holy Spirit
[40:57] the the other ones say you know the
[40:59] those that are saved saved uh uh saved
[41:03] in the end uh you know save from
[41:07] destruction they're given uh eternal
[41:09] life they they never did have the Holy
[41:12] Ghost in their real life they just uh
[41:15] they just might have had justification
[41:17] and sanctification and lived the holy
[41:19] life in things but they never received
[41:21] the Holy Ghost right so they will have
[41:23] to go through the tribulation for the
[41:24] sake for the sake of uh they didn't they
[41:28] didn't receive the word in in this day
[41:31] for their age so they go through the
[41:32] tribulation come up to the Judgment they
[41:34] don't take the Amica of the Beast so
[41:35] they're giving eternal life that's what
[41:37] happens so they go and they they go and
[41:40] live outside the city they don't they're
[41:42] not in the city because it's the bride
[41:43] is the only one in the city so they're
[41:45] outside the gates at at night D do dot
[41:48] so that and that's Grace to him you know
[41:51] that's Grace that's God's grace and he
[41:53] goes through through all of those
[41:55] different ones in there the unbeliever
[41:57] and whoever it is in the in the judgment
[41:59] and uh I think he'll have Grace for a
[42:01] lot of people's someone who did good to
[42:03] the bride and all of those things right
[42:05] and they weren't they weren't part of
[42:08] the in God's mind in the beginning they
[42:10] weren't an attribute of God so all that
[42:11] happens but the this is for the bride
[42:14] and there's scriptures and he says when
[42:16] when he goes and he has 99 and he's
[42:18] missing one he's going to leave that 99
[42:20] and go get it right and that doesn't
[42:24] mean uh you got a choice right you're
[42:27] going and you you should want to go
[42:31] right uh so when you when you understand
[42:34] it all I didn't understand it I wasn't
[42:36] looking for it and it it came
[42:42] right because it was your number was up
[42:44] you were called and you think oh I was
[42:47] saved here I wasn't saved I was always
[42:48] saved he was just coming to get me back
[42:50] you got it
[42:52] right wonderful
[42:54] plan so here is in the scriptures and
[42:57] when we were dead in sins has quickened
[42:59] us together with Christ by grace are you
[43:01] saved and has raised us up together and
[43:04] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[43:06] in Christ Jesus this is what he's
[43:08] talking about where Christ is in your
[43:10] soul that Holy Soul who has blessed us
[43:14] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[43:16] places in sorry who has blessed us with
[43:19] all Heaven spiritual blessings and
[43:22] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[43:24] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[43:26] him from the foundation of the world and
[43:30] in Leia Church age yes sir the church is
[43:33] no longer the mouthpiece of God it its
[43:35] own mouthpiece that's what happened in
[43:37] 63 so God is turning on
[43:40] her he he will confound her through the
[43:44] prophet he's talking about the nominal
[43:46] church here right through the prophet
[43:48] and the bride for the voice of God will
[43:49] be in her yes it is for it says in
[43:52] Revelations 22:7 the spirit and the
[43:54] bride say come right amen
[43:57] still in review here we did cover this
[44:00] so here in the future home you be you
[44:02] become a new person amen not just an old
[44:06] one patched up by joining church or
[44:08] trying to turn a new page but you are a
[44:11] complete brand new unit God takes the
[44:15] old man and burns him completely out
[44:17] holy
[44:19] convocation and burns him completely out
[44:21] with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes
[44:23] himself sends down your representation
[44:26] Holy Spirit
[44:27] no one can come to me except my father
[44:30] has drawn him and all the father has
[44:33] given me will come to me you see it some
[44:36] plan same plan same way for everyone
[44:39] right and over here on the side is just
[44:40] these these uh he he just scramble these
[44:43] verses but it says all that the father
[44:46] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[44:49] cometh to me I will in Noah cast out
[44:53] right and the other part of that no man
[44:56] can come come to me except the Father
[44:58] which has sent me draw him so no the
[45:01] father has to to come looking for you
[45:03] right no one can go up a lot of that's
[45:06] denomination when you go up to the altar
[45:08] to be saved and God didn't call you
[45:10] that's denomination because you're going
[45:12] yourself good for you right but uh it's
[45:16] not you're not the elect you may be the
[45:18] elect later God might call you the right
[45:20] way who knows we never know we can never
[45:22] judge but that's denomination when you
[45:24] just go yourself right
[45:27] but if God calls you if you're just
[45:29] going on in your life like me and you're
[45:31] going on and then all of a sudden tap
[45:33] tap God calls you then that's a
[45:35] different story right you're you're
[45:36] elect right so no man can come to me
[45:41] except the father has sent
[45:44] me has sent me draw him and I will raise
[45:48] him up in the last
[45:53] day so there is a way for the elect and
[45:56] that's Under The Plan of
[45:58] Redemption so how we doing on
[46:01] time oh
[46:06] no so Satan will be taken from the earth
[46:10] just exactly like Satan was taken from
[46:12] you Satan cannot bother or he can tempt
[46:16] he can tempt you but he cannot get a
[46:19] born again
[46:21] Christian you're once you're in that
[46:24] eternity once that your soul is in that
[46:26] that eternity realm it's over right it's
[46:30] it's it's Ephesians 4:30 right but God
[46:34] from the foundation of the world foresaw
[46:36] him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the
[46:39] blood speaks for him how can he sin when
[46:42] he can't be seen even by God the only
[46:45] can't he can the devil can't see it see
[46:47] that Soul God can't see it the only
[46:50] thing he hears is your voice he sees
[46:53] your
[46:54] representation amen that is true see but
[46:57] by the same means for the world is one
[47:00] of its attributes just the same as you
[47:02] are one of his attributes the Earth is
[47:04] an attribute of God it's a thought of
[47:05] God it was in there from the beginning
[47:07] the world you see that you read that all
[47:09] in the Sixth Seal the world comes
[47:12] becomes one of his attributes because it
[47:14] was in God's thinking in the beginning
[47:16] to have the world to be on a throne to
[47:20] be a king or a redeemer to be a Healer
[47:22] that's his attributes so he's just
[47:25] whatever he has thought he's going to do
[47:27] it there's nothing going to stop it if
[47:28] that's in his thoughts he's going to do
[47:30] it if that person was in his thoughts
[47:32] it's going to be there right there's no
[47:34] choice here you know I know you could
[47:36] really put up a stink if you wanted to
[47:39] you know it's like brother's brother and
[47:42] God will take you he'll take you off the
[47:43] scene way earlier than you should but
[47:45] you're still some of God now you
[47:47] probably miss you won't get your reward
[47:50] that you see in Revelation 21 22 you
[47:53] won't get your reward or something but
[47:55] you're still there you're a thought of
[48:00] God sorry that I didn't click click on
[48:04] that sorry about that should be reading
[48:06] it out of there so there is your holy
[48:09] convocation not have anything to do with
[48:11] the literal things that's beyond that
[48:13] it's into the kingdom of God look how
[48:16] high this is with eternal life with the
[48:19] predestinated that never did that never
[48:21] did start there was no start right you
[48:23] were always there always have eternal
[48:26] it's never started on any day you wasn't
[48:29] saved on any day you was always saved
[48:32] this is quite statement isn't it amen
[48:34] Jesus just come to redeem that but you
[48:38] were saved from the beginning because
[48:40] you had eternal life to begin with
[48:46] amen and the world doesn't have access
[48:49] to it you say but you made a mistake
[48:51] yesterday I'm not judged in days he says
[48:54] here you know you weren't saved on any
[48:56] day you you're I'm not judging days I
[48:59] don't start on a day the devil can point
[49:01] to yesterday and last and last week day
[49:04] and last year day and 20 years ago day
[49:06] and none of that counts why because I
[49:08] have passed from days and weeks and
[49:10] months and I'm in
[49:12] eternity you you are always saved so
[49:15] there is no such thing as spiritual
[49:17] death now to the baptized saint of God
[49:19] the curse is gone when the Holy Spirit
[49:21] accepts you you you don't accept it it
[49:24] accepts you
[49:27] do you know that Jesus said that to his
[49:29] disciples you haven't chosen me actually
[49:31] I've chosen you you don't accept it it
[49:34] accepts you because it's God's attribute
[49:36] it was accepted because you were
[49:38] ordained for that P that purpose you
[49:41] were you were yes you were born in sin
[49:45] just like everybody else Paul taught
[49:48] taught us that but he says the thought
[49:50] of God has accepted you because you were
[49:52] ordained for that purpose yet you were
[49:55] born in sin but God
[49:57] has had that attribute and here you here
[49:59] you expressed yourself on Earth and he
[50:01] comes down and gets you he came down and
[50:04] got you he took you from there to here
[50:07] and now you can't ever leave here so
[50:09] this is the position you are and the
[50:11] whole thing is based on an attribute of
[50:14] God a thought of God he says he comes
[50:17] down to get you and know you're back
[50:20] there back here here is where you belong
[50:24] so an attribute it's like a gene right
[50:25] it's like a you have a gene it's it's
[50:27] the same with in God's terms
[50:30] right so getting through it
[50:33] here Heaven and Earth have met is from
[50:37] the future home God and man is
[50:40] reconciled a restored Eden has begun has
[50:43] begun see all the curse is
[50:47] gone just like all the curse is gone
[50:50] when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you
[50:54] didn't accept it it accepts you
[50:58] you see because it's God's attribute see
[51:01] if if it's the holy
[51:03] ghost means God's spirit and it's the
[51:06] attribute the thought of God it's a
[51:09] gene has accepted you because that you
[51:12] were ordained for that
[51:15] purpose you was born in sin but God had
[51:19] that attitude and here you are here you
[51:21] express yourself here on the earth and
[51:23] he comes down and gets you see you're
[51:25] back here
[51:27] you're back here he's talking about that
[51:28] eternity part here is where you belong
[51:31] and sin has lost its power that's right
[51:34] the desire for sin has gone from your
[51:37] heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you
[51:39] are a restored person that doesn't
[51:41] happen in your heart that other those
[51:43] desires are be in your flesh that's what
[51:44] you have to work on you have to like
[51:46] Paul says in Galatians you have to push
[51:48] that down right and you push it down
[51:50] eventually it will go
[51:52] right believe me it will
[52:00] so just a quick just some
[52:03] U Insight on this so with St
[52:07] Paul uh was a prophet and when he passed
[52:11] on it went into as we know the Gentile
[52:13] agees from 1 to 7 and then in the
[52:17] seventh age there was another Prophet
[52:19] wood brandham came on the scene and it
[52:21] was for a very specific reason there was
[52:23] many many things for brother Brandman to
[52:26] come come in as the seven Church age
[52:28] messenger and the prophet to that age
[52:30] that would come and you know there was
[52:33] just as a messenger so there was there
[52:35] was many things that brother rham had to
[52:37] do in that
[52:39] age and then after you know before the
[52:43] Rapture he leaves the scene of course
[52:44] and when the Rapture comes it's the end
[52:45] of the Gentile age
[52:48] so in in terms of the Jews they they
[52:52] they have a path this is pretty empty
[52:54] right up to the last last of it but it
[52:57] come all the six trumpets are have been
[53:01] have been uh uh uh you know already
[53:05] finished so they're complete it's only
[53:07] the seventh trumpet which is in
[53:09] Revelations 11 and that's when the two
[53:11] prophets are on the scene with 144,000
[53:14] revelational evidence all that right so
[53:16] in the as I said before in the seventh
[53:19] is when all of this trumpets will be
[53:21] revealed by these two
[53:24] prophets so he knows there Moses Mo and
[53:26] Elijah they'll have other names but
[53:28] that's the spirit of Moses Moses and
[53:29] Elijah these two
[53:31] prophets and then after of course they
[53:35] go into Armageddon they die and then it
[53:36] goes into the Millennium that's the
[53:38] timeline for it all so William manam
[53:41] picked up they automatically picked up
[53:43] where Paul left off right so Paul left
[53:46] off and the church went right into a a a
[53:49] downward slope right down into the uh
[53:52] Dark Ages and it only started come up
[53:55] we've went through this before come up
[53:57] in Luther's time in the re in the
[53:59] Reformation right it started to started
[54:01] to pick up again and but at this point
[54:04] once Paul went off the scene and it was
[54:06] all warnings that it was the spirits
[54:08] that were in the church and it was going
[54:09] to fall and it did in the first age
[54:11] gradually all fall off right into a
[54:13] tribulation so but then brother brandham
[54:16] when brother brandham is not a messenger
[54:18] couldn't pick it up what what had to be
[54:20] done here at the end it had to be a
[54:21] prophet who had to speak to these things
[54:23] in the seventh age right when it was
[54:25] over so a prophet came on the scene the
[54:27] grace of God to us that a prophet came
[54:29] we wouldn't know otherwise you could see
[54:31] how confused the denominations is
[54:33] because and how the world is because of
[54:35] the spirit that's been dropped and the
[54:36] Darkness that's upon the Earth right and
[54:38] gross Darkness upon the people so that's
[54:41] what's happening but in Ghost and there
[54:42] was light right so the bride in this age
[54:45] you know were in light and a lot of
[54:48] light and it's good light but we're
[54:49] still like in that diagram I got with
[54:52] the time it's a shadow it's just like a
[54:55] negative of a f
[54:56] right it's not clear it's not very clear
[54:59] at all in this age really what's going
[55:01] on with God but the light is in the
[55:04] great light is in that Eternal realm
[55:06] right and so when your soul gets that
[55:08] light there's an Awakening and a and a
[55:10] light that you have in this walk on this
[55:13] Earth that let you get through in to uh
[55:16] the into that Eternal peace with all of
[55:18] you Body Soul Spirit everything right so
[55:21] we're in the process so brother Brandon
[55:23] picked up right where St Paul left off
[55:26] and and and he was following what Paul
[55:28] said because we know when he went over
[55:30] into that other dimension they said you
[55:32] know uh you
[55:35] know you know that to the people said
[55:39] said to him you know you know to you
[55:42] know Paul what Paul says and and that's
[55:43] what he said he was doing right he was
[55:45] he was doing what Paul was doing he says
[55:47] what Paul says
[55:49] right and then in the end Moses and
[55:52] Elijah picks up where where Paul uh lead
[55:56] leaves off so they do the same thing so
[55:58] it's all just a a gap for the Gentiles
[56:00] to come in so Paul is here and and then
[56:04] they the the other two prophets come on
[56:06] the scene 2,000 years later and just
[56:08] pick right up so it's all pled right
[56:11] that don't happen just you know H by
[56:15] luck this is all planned the whole thing
[56:17] is planned and they have the same
[56:19] message come out of her my people it was
[56:21] the same message that both both sides
[56:24] have and you know one side Moses Elijah
[56:26] doesn't know really anything about
[56:28] they're not even really manifested yet
[56:30] this will be soon I hope and then you
[56:33] know the prophet is off seen anyway
[56:34] right now it's in the
[56:37] broad so just trying to get through it
[56:41] so here just get down to a point here St
[56:43] Paul goes off the scene and after that
[56:46] John is imprisoned on the a of patmas
[56:48] for two years takes him two years on the
[56:51] thing he's totally blind and he sees all
[56:53] these things writes it down it's all in
[56:55] symbol form not to be not to be
[56:58] revealed so John records what he sees in
[57:02] sees on the island into a book The Book
[57:04] of Revelation and the Book of Revelation
[57:06] is sealed then for 2,000 years no one
[57:09] knew what was going on if you read any
[57:11] commentaries and you if you want to
[57:13] waste your time and you they start
[57:15] talking about Revelation and they say
[57:17] well it could be this they talk about a
[57:19] little phrase and it could be this but
[57:20] it could be this or it could be one
[57:22] person could be that you know it's just
[57:24] blinded to it all right
[57:26] strictly part of the Plan of Redemption
[57:28] it's it's it's for the
[57:31] bride so the Seven Seals are sealed and
[57:34] everything is in symbol form that's what
[57:36] we what the person reading Revelation
[57:39] looks
[57:40] like so it is a closed
[57:43] book in the last seventh last age the
[57:47] seventh age a prophet is on the
[57:49] scene we all know this Christ comes down
[57:52] and breaks the Seven Seals in March 1963
[57:55] what a great
[57:57] day and you know the church is over
[57:59] right it was the first thing he declared
[58:01] the church is over right it's finished
[58:03] the book of Revelation is revealed
[58:05] through a
[58:07] prophet and no one has understood these
[58:11] Mysteries since St Paul Paul St Paul
[58:14] knew he knew this stuff because it was
[58:17] it was uh it was open then because John
[58:22] had it sealed so if something was sealed
[58:24] it must have been opened it had to be be
[58:26] there before right and Paul knew it Paul
[58:29] references it when he goes up in those
[58:30] other dimensions and stuff like that and
[58:31] he sees things now he didn't reveal it
[58:33] because it wasn't his day he knew this
[58:35] was coming but this had to come now and
[58:37] it was all being he knew what was going
[58:39] to happen and Paul was long dead before
[58:42] poor John went on the
[58:45] a so the world says we don't need a
[58:48] prophet has anyone heard that don't put
[58:50] up your
[58:51] hand right everyone's agreed
[58:56] it's only the everyone that's
[58:57] experienced it right it's only the
[58:59] ministry of the son of man that reveals
[59:02] the mystery of
[59:03] redemption it's only in the son of man
[59:05] the son of man is a is is in a prophet
[59:08] form right when it comes down Jesus came
[59:11] as son of man Paul and brother randam
[59:14] came as son of man and they
[59:17] came they came to reveal and they were
[59:20] the only ones that deal in the in
[59:22] Redemption because the Redemption
[59:24] Redemption is only for the elect if you
[59:26] go and say these things to someone who's
[59:28] not in the bride everyone here is in
[59:31] agreement I'm pretty sure right those
[59:34] are are listening are in agreement and
[59:36] you know if you go into the world with
[59:38] this into nominations they would not
[59:40] believe you at all they would they don't
[59:42] can't even get through a prophet let
[59:43] alone The Plan of Redemption and all of
[59:45] this laid out here you know what the
[59:47] prophet laid out in these in these
[59:49] messages they wouldn't believe it we
[59:51] know they won't because they can't
[59:53] they're blinded to it right I understand
[59:54] that I don't hold that against them
[59:56] could be me right but by election is not
[1:00:00] right the ministry of the son of man
[1:00:02] operates to a prophet right so with when
[1:00:06] there's a son of man on this Earth is a
[1:00:09] prophet you know a full-fledged Prophet
[1:00:12] the and brother BR was a prophet the
[1:00:15] ministry of and Paul was a prophet the
[1:00:17] ministry of redemption requires
[1:00:19] prophetic
[1:00:21] Insight because you have to you have to
[1:00:23] turn a corner here God is s the prop to
[1:00:26] turn a corner this is he's saying first
[1:00:28] a second AG third AG I can't remember
[1:00:31] the order of them fifth sixth 7th and
[1:00:35] then there's a turn now we will go on
[1:00:37] the same churches go on the same we go
[1:00:39] on okay this all these people died we're
[1:00:42] still going the same way doing the same
[1:00:43] things every day and it takes something
[1:00:46] like a prophet with God behind it to
[1:00:48] make it make the turn and we're making
[1:00:50] the turn now and it's not easy right
[1:00:53] it's not easy because things change we
[1:00:55] you don't like change there are M
[1:00:59] Mysteries under Redemption that you have
[1:01:02] have there are mysteries on the
[1:01:05] Redemption that you have access to I
[1:01:08] just want get on my notes
[1:01:14] Here the mystery of redemption was
[1:01:17] contained in the book of redemption now
[1:01:19] did you ever hear the book of redemption
[1:01:20] I didn't hear the book of
[1:01:23] redemption so all of these Mysteries
[1:01:25] that happen in for Redemption are hidden
[1:01:29] and they're not mentioned much in the in
[1:01:31] the Epistles or the you see what
[1:01:33] happened but it's not explained very
[1:01:35] well but and that's what the entire Book
[1:01:37] of Revelation is about is about
[1:01:41] Redemption the entire book of redemption
[1:01:44] is about God redeeming his family and if
[1:01:47] you read it that's what it's about right
[1:01:49] it's at the end and he's redeeming his
[1:01:51] family and the Earth and his people in
[1:01:53] the seals and the trumpets and all of
[1:01:55] this
[1:01:56] and the kingdom and setting up a whole
[1:01:59] new civilization right right up to
[1:02:02] Revelations 20
[1:02:03] 2122 all the judgments happen so this is
[1:02:07] all about Redemption the book of
[1:02:09] redemption is the Book of Revelation
[1:02:12] right I never you know that's really
[1:02:16] something that's
[1:02:19] wonderful
[1:02:21] Redemption and in there was seven so
[1:02:25] what is the what The Book of Revelation
[1:02:26] about it's about Redemption and in there
[1:02:29] was a Seven Seals book of redemption and
[1:02:32] Christ opened it and gave it to a
[1:02:34] prophet who gave it to the people and
[1:02:37] everyone has access to it you have
[1:02:39] access to it totally open as much as you
[1:02:42] can is revealed to you you know but it's
[1:02:44] totally revealed as long as you can just
[1:02:46] reach it
[1:02:48] right God has accepted you because you
[1:02:51] were ordained yet you were born in sin
[1:02:54] but you were an attribute and you
[1:02:56] expressed yourself worthy and he came
[1:02:59] and got you now you're back here where
[1:03:01] you belong and sin lost its power these
[1:03:05] are Mysteries under Redemption that you
[1:03:07] have access to
[1:03:10] amen God bless us because when you look
[1:03:12] at the Book of Revelation it was sealed
[1:03:15] up by John John didn't understand it he
[1:03:17] was getting all mixed up he thought that
[1:03:19] he was thought this Angel who was a
[1:03:22] prophet thought it was Christ and it was
[1:03:24] bound down before for it and had to pick
[1:03:27] him up and this is not you know this is
[1:03:29] not this is a prophet right and you know
[1:03:32] the different angels and him trying to
[1:03:33] figure it out and he would look at
[1:03:35] things and they'd say seal it up he
[1:03:36] didn't know what it was it was just in a
[1:03:38] symbol form and they said seal it up
[1:03:40] don't say nothing or don't even put a
[1:03:41] symbol on this part you know the
[1:03:43] Thunders or something so he didn't know
[1:03:45] it and up to the 2,000 years no one knew
[1:03:48] it and then it was opened it was open in
[1:03:50] our age and a prophet came along and
[1:03:53] opened it and we're the only ones the
[1:03:55] bride is the only on that saw in it in
[1:03:58] its full form what it meant not in
[1:04:00] symbol form but in actual revelation of
[1:04:04] what these things mean and what it is
[1:04:05] and let us see see uh all that was going
[1:04:08] to take place upon the Earth
[1:04:12] so that is an
[1:04:14] hour so I've
[1:04:19] got I think I finished my
[1:04:22] review but I don't have many pages here
[1:04:25] just I going to do it quick here just so
[1:04:27] we get through it
[1:04:29] here so on the top here it says the
[1:04:32] earth and the body so the the body your
[1:04:35] body is your soul is redeemed we know
[1:04:38] that it's up in the you see it up in
[1:04:40] eternity there and uh the earth the
[1:04:45] earth and the body are together when the
[1:04:47] earth is is redeemed the body are are
[1:04:50] are redeemed right so you see it here
[1:04:52] and probably can't see it that well but
[1:04:55] it it really goes out here the holy you
[1:04:57] see the seventh age and then there's the
[1:04:59] 3 and 1/2 years of the uh marriage
[1:05:03] supper for the bride and in the
[1:05:05] Millennium for a thousand years a
[1:05:07] thousand years okay so that makes 7,000
[1:05:10] oh seven what happens after seven we all
[1:05:12] know now
[1:05:14] right right if you don't if you know it
[1:05:16] don't put up your hand it's the it's the
[1:05:19] holy convocation right so the fire comes
[1:05:21] down so the earth the earth is cleared
[1:05:25] here now it's coming down not on a
[1:05:26] person but it's coming down on a on on
[1:05:29] the earth now because the Earth is the
[1:05:30] attribute it's a seed of God it's a gene
[1:05:32] of God it's going to be used in eternity
[1:05:35] by God all the people are going to dwell
[1:05:37] on the earth the New Jerusalem new
[1:05:41] heavens and the new Earth is all on the
[1:05:43] earth on the earth the new Earth he's G
[1:05:45] he's doing it now you know Abraham
[1:05:47] looked
[1:05:48] forward we're going to find it it's
[1:05:51] going to be and it has but it has to go
[1:05:53] through here so in theill millenum you
[1:05:56] know we're still on the earth it is
[1:05:57] burnt over here by atomic fire we see
[1:06:00] that all building up now it will be
[1:06:02] Burnt Over by nuclear weapons and the
[1:06:04] whole thing everything destroyed but
[1:06:06] it's not the it's not the cleaning that
[1:06:09] the the fire that God is going to give
[1:06:11] it after the Millennium because we still
[1:06:13] in time in the Millennium right we all
[1:06:15] know we're still in time so in then
[1:06:18] after the Thousand Years then it it
[1:06:21] comes the Holy Fire which is which is
[1:06:23] the holy convocation which is God's now
[1:06:27] doing it totally himself cleaning off
[1:06:28] the Earth and then after that the new
[1:06:32] heaven end the new Earth come down and
[1:06:34] God himself comes down at that point so
[1:06:37] the the Earth is totally changed but
[1:06:39] it's the same Earth and then we go into
[1:06:41] eternity forever and ever and it's not
[1:06:43] the same at all right you know there
[1:06:45] very very little there but it's not the
[1:06:47] same we know you know there's hold it
[1:06:49] there's no sea there and 70% of the
[1:06:52] earth now is sea right 70% of bus is
[1:06:56] water you know it's it's it's going to
[1:06:59] be no there's going to be no sea at that
[1:07:02] time right in the new heavens and new
[1:07:04] earth so just quickly so the rapture we
[1:07:07] see the body change and then the
[1:07:09] marriage supper and the bride body
[1:07:11] redeemed we go into Armageddon three in
[1:07:14] the three and a half year
[1:07:16] tribulation and the Earth is purged
[1:07:19] first time now the second time was we go
[1:07:21] through goag and Magog first and then
[1:07:24] Satan is destroyed and in Revelation
[1:07:28] 20 then there's a great
[1:07:31] Resurrection that's the second
[1:07:33] Resurrection we go through to
[1:07:36] judgment everyone is raised great white
[1:07:39] own
[1:07:40] judgment and then we go into the new
[1:07:43] Heavens then there's the new the purging
[1:07:46] and then new heavens and the new
[1:07:52] Earth so and you are these other parts
[1:07:56] that's draw out of this earth the earth
[1:07:59] you're a part of the earth your body
[1:08:01] your soul is part of God and attribute
[1:08:03] of God displayed here on Earth in a body
[1:08:07] the body is to be redeemed so B in
[1:08:09] future homies focusing now on this part
[1:08:11] the earth and the body right I'm just
[1:08:13] giving you the highlights
[1:08:14] here now the soul is redeemed because it
[1:08:17] was in sin so God came down by the
[1:08:20] process of justification sanctification
[1:08:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed
[1:08:24] your soul
[1:08:26] and you being part of the earth it's re
[1:08:29] it's Redeemed by it your your you're
[1:08:34] you're redeemed with the Earth you're in
[1:08:37] the process now it's gr on your body was
[1:08:41] justified under Noah's
[1:08:44] baptism and your flesh when it dropped I
[1:08:47] put in here the blood of Jesus upon
[1:08:49] there and the Earth is to be cleansed by
[1:08:52] fire the place where you live with the
[1:08:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost so we know
[1:08:56] that it was in Noah's days it was it was
[1:08:58] baptized by water the whole earth in
[1:09:01] Jesus day the blood went down on it from
[1:09:03] the cross we were in that blood right we
[1:09:05] our seed went into that Earth with the
[1:09:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling
[1:09:10] place for Christ and his bride the holy
[1:09:13] the New Jerusalem so Noah was the water
[1:09:15] that's done for the earth and the bodies
[1:09:19] and all and then Jesus the blood that
[1:09:21] was all done and now this holy
[1:09:23] convocation the third time the whole
[1:09:25] thing is just burnt right off right so
[1:09:27] those are the three things that will
[1:09:28] redeem the Earth
[1:09:37] beautiful just as God created the Earth
[1:09:40] in six days made the Earth in 6,000
[1:09:42] years and he said be not ignorant we
[1:09:44] read in the scriptures 1,000 days 1,000
[1:09:48] years is one day and Christ has gone and
[1:09:50] is preparing a place that's been on its
[1:09:52] construction for many many thousands of
[1:09:54] years preparing a place and I go and
[1:09:57] prepare a place and I will come again
[1:09:59] and receive you that wherever I am there
[1:10:01] you may go also notice the Redeemer and
[1:10:04] the redeemed and we're familiar with
[1:10:06] that
[1:10:07] scripture just last couple of quotes
[1:10:13] here and Christ has gone and is
[1:10:16] preparing a place the redeemed and
[1:10:18] redeemed so I went through that one
[1:10:20] sorry about that I need to watch up
[1:10:23] there so what God has has done to redeem
[1:10:26] his world he's done the same plan to
[1:10:28] redeem his people for the unchangeable
[1:10:30] god changes not in any of his plans or
[1:10:33] anything such a glorious thing how he
[1:10:35] led us to how he led us to himself to a
[1:10:40] Tabernacle in Us by three stages of
[1:10:42] Grace just like he's led the world in
[1:10:45] three stages to come to the Earth so
[1:10:47] he's saying this the same for your soul
[1:10:49] it's the same for your body it's the
[1:10:51] same for the Earth it's all those three
[1:10:52] stages of the water water and the the
[1:10:58] fire and the
[1:11:01] blood it's all consistent right so here
[1:11:04] here now you see the the at that point
[1:11:08] when the new heavens and new earth are
[1:11:09] gone that the loop of time that fell
[1:11:12] down is gone right time is over it's
[1:11:15] ended so it goes back to the Eternal
[1:11:17] realm there now which and everything has
[1:11:20] been redeemed soul body representing all
[1:11:22] the elect and the Earth right
[1:11:26] and whatever else was in the thoughts of
[1:11:28] God that was an attribute is all
[1:11:30] finished so he himself there now is back
[1:11:34] just in the regular Eternal in realm and
[1:11:39] uh there's no more time there's no more
[1:11:41] sin there's no more devil it's all gone
[1:11:43] everything is gone
[1:11:45] amen and that is good
[1:11:58] just finishing up here now in the new
[1:12:01] Earth and the new Heavens will never be
[1:12:03] blackened again when the new Earth is to
[1:12:06] come the devil will be bound Satan he is
[1:12:08] still loose now he is accuser but in the
[1:12:11] new Earth he will be bound and cast into
[1:12:13] the Lake of Fire in his in this Holy
[1:12:16] Fire heavens and earth will will have
[1:12:19] met God and man is reconciled a restored
[1:12:23] Eden has begun see and the curse is gone
[1:12:27] curse is gone forever no more Plan of
[1:12:30] Redemption is ended it's over so there
[1:12:34] is a start and there is an end just like
[1:12:37] all the curse of sin is gone when the
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost accepts it see you don't
[1:12:42] accept it it accepts you you always
[1:12:45] thought the other right see because it's
[1:12:47] God's attribute see it's the holy ghost
[1:12:50] means holy spirit and it's the attribute
[1:12:53] the thought of God has accepted you
[1:12:54] because you were ordained for the
[1:12:56] purpose you were in the thoughts of God
[1:12:59] you was born in sin but God had that
[1:13:01] attribute and here you expressed
[1:13:03] yourself here on Earth and he comes down
[1:13:05] and gets you and you're back here here
[1:13:08] is where you belong see sin has lost its
[1:13:11] power that's right the desire of sin has
[1:13:14] gone from your heart when the Holy
[1:13:17] Spirit comes in and you are a restored
[1:13:20] person never to be go back again to that
[1:13:29] but now it's here to go through a
[1:13:31] baptism of
[1:13:34] fire Holy Holy Fire from God which
[1:13:38] cleanses the earth and the heavens
[1:13:40] around it then it's purchased so that
[1:13:43] the redeemed can have can live on it
[1:13:47] live in live in it in
[1:13:51] peace notice the baptism of fire is to
[1:13:54] cleanse it from sin from sickness from
[1:13:58] disease
[1:14:00] germs from sinners from the devil and
[1:14:04] all of his group we know all them right
[1:14:09] it is to be cast out into the Lake of
[1:14:13] Fire but we won't miss
[1:14:18] him one more last quote believe it or
[1:14:21] not
[1:14:28] there that's this is from
