[45:25] up into Heavenly places Lord God as
[45:27] you've drawn us away from the filth and
[45:29] dirt and mire of this world Lord you've
[45:32] changed our Natures you've changed our
[45:33] desires Lord you've brought us subject
[45:36] to your word Lord and we're so thankful
[45:37] this morning that we're on a path Lord
[45:40] to a resurrection and a Rapture they're
[45:42] on a path Lord that brings us into your
[45:44] presence or that unites sword a Heavenly
[45:46] bridegroom with an Earthly bride Lord
[45:48] God that we've got a word Lord that will
[45:50] lead us all the way that we've got a
[45:52] spirit to Quicken it in our hearts and
[45:54] souls Lord and make it live out in these
[45:56] fleshly bodies we have Lord we love you
[45:59] this morning Lord we're just praying
[46:01] Lord that as we read your word as we
[46:02] preached this morning Lord that love
[46:04] would flow that strength would flow Lord
[46:06] that encouragement would flow the
[46:08] correction would flow that alignment
[46:10] would flow Lord whatever we have need of
[46:12] Lord each heart and soul and life Lord
[46:14] we pray that it would be a Fountain of
[46:16] Living Water the this morning Lord that
[46:18] each one could drink from Lord bless
[46:20] your people now we pray
[46:21] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[46:25] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[46:28] Matthew chapter 7. Matthew chapter 7
[46:31] certainly appreciated the special this
[46:33] morning
[46:34] amen it's a good thing to dwell on the
[46:36] blessings of God it's a good thing to
[46:37] dwell on the good things of God Amen
[46:39] it'll give us strength it'll give us
[46:40] encouragement it'll help us see the
[46:42] light at the end of the tunnel and the
[46:44] trials and tribulations that we go
[46:46] through amen it'll keep our minds set on
[46:48] him and it'll give us the right attitude
[46:50] and spirit
[46:51] amen God bless you this morning just
[46:53] wanted to make a quick announcement here
[46:55] you may have noticed at the end of last
[46:56] service brother Josh came up to and I
[46:59] didn't ask him to come up and you'll see
[47:00] that now moving forward the song leaders
[47:02] are going to come up as soon as I'm done
[47:04] praying at the end of a service and if I
[47:06] want to continue to lead to sing then I
[47:08] will but it gives us the opportunity to
[47:11] just transition to them much more easily
[47:12] and and quickly it also means that if
[47:15] you want to come up for prayer then they
[47:17] can automatically just step right into
[47:18] the pulpit and take over the song
[47:20] leading so we're doing that for your
[47:21] sake again sometimes I feel led to just
[47:24] continue to lead the song service rather
[47:26] than turn it over but usually my
[47:28] intention is to turn it over but if I am
[47:30] singing then you don't have to worry
[47:32] about oh I can't go up and ask for
[47:34] prayer or anything like that you come up
[47:36] and the song leader will take over right
[47:37] then and there and I'm I'm happy to pray
[47:39] with you or talk with you or whatever
[47:40] you might need so again we've just done
[47:42] that for the sake of the people and and
[47:44] just to accommodate kind of the way
[47:45] Services go sometimes I mean God bless
[47:48] you Matthew chapter 7. verse 7 says this
[47:51] ask and it shall be given to you seek
[47:54] and ye shall find knock and it shall be
[47:57] opened unto you for everyone that asketh
[48:00] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[48:03] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[48:06] opened amen God bless this word you can
[48:08] have your seats this morning
[48:10] amen as you can imagine we started this
[48:12] this little thought on when God answers
[48:15] on Wednesday night and I just want to do
[48:17] a a quick recap of that this morning we
[48:19] had quite a few people not there and so
[48:21] we want to just continue this this
[48:23] morning and Lord willing we'll do it
[48:24] again on Wednesday but we want to take
[48:27] what we said on Wednesday and kind of
[48:28] show what that looks like in real life
[48:29] what that looks like in in practice but
[48:32] I just want to do a quick recap this
[48:33] morning and we open with the scripture
[48:35] Matthew 7. remember when we focused on
[48:37] that thought of asking seeking and
[48:39] knocking are our requirements that's
[48:41] what God asks us to do in the scripture
[48:43] and it's up to him to provide it's up to
[48:45] him to to show us the way it's up to him
[48:47] to open the doors but it's up to us to
[48:50] ask to seek and to knock and we showed
[48:52] how brother Branham said that this is
[48:53] something you do continually it's not
[48:55] just a and you do this in the literal
[48:57] service he didn't say knock is not just
[48:59] this it's not just a one-time knock but
[49:01] he says it's a knock and a continuous
[49:04] knocking he says it shows that you have
[49:05] faith in a God that's going to answer
[49:07] that God's going to open the door amen
[49:10] so we want to remind ourselves of what
[49:12] that purpose of our asking and seeking
[49:14] and knocking is because remember the
[49:15] prophet of God would align us with what
[49:17] the intent is because so often we think
[49:19] well I've got to go in and I've got to
[49:21] ask for what I want that's not what the
[49:23] scripture is about and brother Brandon
[49:24] would say this he would say look at
[49:25] Nicodemus
[49:27] I can't get the next slide if you can
[49:29] help me brother Levi
[49:30] he would say look at Nicodemus coming to
[49:33] him Nicodemus was a scholar coming to a
[49:36] man that had no diploma he was an
[49:38] aristocrat coming to a pauper he was an
[49:40] old teacher coming to the youth he says
[49:43] but see the difference but when he came
[49:46] he came with an open heart seeking the
[49:49] truth he says you come that way so this
[49:52] asking the seeking and this knocking is
[49:54] to find truth it is to find the will of
[49:56] God it's to find the mind of God it's to
[49:57] find the word of God he says now just
[49:59] come the same way with an open heart
[50:01] seeking truth seek and you shall find
[50:04] knock it'll be opened ask and you shall
[50:06] receive he says that's it that's the
[50:08] basis that Jesus said to come on so this
[50:11] idea of prayer is not to drive God but
[50:14] rather it's to find the will of God it's
[50:15] to find the the thoughts of God and the
[50:17] way that God would have to go us to go
[50:19] in a certain situation so it's not to go
[50:21] to God to ask him to change things it's
[50:23] to ask and say Lord what is your will
[50:25] and then when you can find the will then
[50:27] you can pray and you can step right into
[50:29] it so our goal is to say God what about
[50:31] this not God hears this and here's what
[50:34] you need to do Lord what's your thoughts
[50:36] what's your way of doing this what's
[50:37] your thoughts on the matter and what
[50:38] does your word say about this amen we're
[50:40] not seeking affirmation we said you know
[50:43] so often it's easy to go to the word to
[50:44] find the part
[50:46] that agrees with our thought but we've
[50:48] got to take the full word from Genesis
[50:49] to Revelation to get the full mind the
[50:51] full thought of God for a situation
[50:53] brother Bible say this he says but does
[50:55] God hear prayer he hears prayer does God
[50:58] answer prayer yes does he answer real
[51:01] quick
[51:02] not all the time does he know he says
[51:05] sometimes he makes us wait is that right
[51:07] but God answers prayer doesn't he he
[51:10] says and just because everything is
[51:12] going wrong that's no sign that we
[51:15] should quit praying we just pray on
[51:17] anyhow don't we that's right no matter
[51:20] what the circumstances are he answers
[51:22] anyhow amen so we talked about last time
[51:25] how with Abraham and and Sarah how their
[51:28] prayers and their faith could not speed
[51:31] up the plan of God God had a timeline
[51:34] and they weren't delayed because they
[51:36] lacked faith and it didn't come at a
[51:37] certain time because they had Faith but
[51:39] rather their faith was continuous they
[51:41] were in expectation the whole time and
[51:43] when God said it's time to have the
[51:45] child then that's when they had the
[51:46] child
[51:47] but after this last service we took
[51:49] ourselves into the Book of Ezekiel and
[51:50] then Revelation and we looked at the way
[51:52] that God answers prayer and we took it
[51:54] through the four beasts or the four
[51:56] powers that surround The Mercy Seat the
[51:58] Judgment seat the Throne of God
[52:00] and in Revelation 4 it says this and
[52:02] Before the Throne there was a sea of
[52:04] glass like under Crystal and in the
[52:06] midst of the throne and round about The
[52:08] Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[52:10] before and behind and the first Beast
[52:13] was like a lion the second beast like a
[52:15] calf the third Beast had a face as a man
[52:17] and the fourth Beast was like a flying
[52:20] eagle and brother Brandon would come
[52:21] behind that and he would show us what
[52:22] those look like in practice because none
[52:25] of these powers in themselves is the
[52:27] full expression of God
[52:29] none of it's the full expression but
[52:31] each one of them together as they go
[52:33] together then they express the way that
[52:35] God works they express the power of the
[52:37] Gospel as we'll see in a moment and it's
[52:39] the way that God responds to Satan's
[52:41] attacks and challenges is through these
[52:43] four beasts these are the ones these are
[52:45] the powers that go forth and he would
[52:47] say this again we're still in a recap
[52:48] here it says in Matthew Mark Luke and
[52:51] John those gospels standing there
[52:53] guarding that and again I I don't have
[52:55] the context here but to give it to you
[52:56] he says it's guarding the Acts of the
[52:58] Apostles it's guarding the acts of the
[53:00] holy spirit it's guarding the Gospel of
[53:02] Jesus Christ they're guarding the Holy
[53:04] Ghost he says and so each of those
[53:06] gospels and you see the way that they
[53:08] approached the the the the Gospel of
[53:10] Jesus Christ each one had a different
[53:12] one and we talked about how Luke is a
[53:14] physician was very very specific and
[53:16] detailed and then John is the prophetic
[53:18] eye and he starts out within the
[53:20] beginning was the word he doesn't go to
[53:22] a natural line he doesn't go to a
[53:23] bloodline of Mary or or Joseph but he
[53:26] goes right back to the word origin and
[53:28] we need everything single one of those
[53:30] gospels and every one of their
[53:31] approaches to see the fullness of the
[53:33] revelation of Christ in that day because
[53:35] John has things that Luke doesn't and
[53:37] Luke has things in Matthew doesn't and
[53:39] Mark has things that none of the other
[53:40] ones do all of them together bring us
[53:42] the full picture of who Jesus was and
[53:45] what that gospel really looks like he
[53:48] says they're guarding that he says it's
[53:49] the wisdom of a man the power of a lion
[53:52] the work of an ox and the swiftness of
[53:55] an eagle and now just before he preaches
[53:57] the Seven Seals you know that was just
[54:00] before that's in the breach and then he
[54:01] comes in now and he's preaching in the
[54:03] fifth seal and this is in his notes the
[54:05] angel has told him what to say this is
[54:08] right from the Throne of God this is the
[54:10] very thoughts of God coming to us and he
[54:13] says we find out in the church ages that
[54:15] those four beasts meaning four powers
[54:17] were gathered around the Acts of the
[54:19] Apostles just the way that the
[54:21] Tabernacle was in the wilderness he says
[54:23] how we drew it out here and showed just
[54:25] exactly they were watching over this
[54:27] he's talking about the lamb the word and
[54:29] what was their purpose he says it's to
[54:32] perform the word just as they did the
[54:34] Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in
[54:37] the wilderness and so forth
[54:43] right so these are the anointings that
[54:45] are there to perform the word of God
[54:47] they're there to perform the will of God
[54:48] they're to go out from the Throne of God
[54:50] and remember in Ezekiel it said they
[54:52] would go out and go in and come out like
[54:54] flashes of lightning they go out and do
[54:55] something they come back in and the
[54:57] light and the glory of God was in those
[54:59] anointings as they went out and they
[55:01] were always in response to what Satan
[55:03] was trying to do and it was God's
[55:05] antidote it was God's counterbalance and
[55:07] so we saw last time how that sometimes
[55:09] God Answers by the power of man's Wisdom
[55:11] and that is Supernatural and sometimes
[55:14] God Answers by the raw power of that
[55:16] line anointing and that is absolutely
[55:18] Supernatural and we understand that very
[55:20] easily but then sometimes the answers by
[55:22] way of an ox anointing and it's a
[55:24] sacrifice and it's a surrender and it's
[55:26] a bearing and a carrying of the burden
[55:29] of the gospel and that is Supernatural
[55:31] and that is God's answer to some
[55:33] situations and then sometimes it's the
[55:35] eagle anointing and that just takes us
[55:37] right above the problem the problem
[55:38] stays the problem's still there the
[55:40] problem still exists but he lifts you to
[55:43] a place place where it can't touch you
[55:46] so all four of these are God's
[55:48] expression in the way that God works
[55:50] through the Believers and like we said
[55:51] last time we always want to have the
[55:53] Swift Flight of the eagle and the raw
[55:55] brutal power of the lion that's always
[55:58] what we want to to have when God when
[56:00] we're going to God in situations but the
[56:02] problem is when we do that we miss out
[56:04] on the fullness of the Gospel we miss
[56:06] out on the fullness of the expression of
[56:08] God we miss out on the fullness of the
[56:10] experience of being a true Son of God
[56:13] because all of these help to grow Us in
[56:15] these things remember every single one
[56:17] of these is a victory from God it's a
[56:20] means of overcoming what Satan has
[56:22] placed in our life what Satan's trying
[56:24] to do against us so none is greater than
[56:26] the other if I could put it that way in
[56:28] that they're all a portion of God
[56:29] they're all the way that God does things
[56:31] and again this is what we read last last
[56:33] week he said now that's the only way
[56:35] I've always found it that I can get
[56:37] anything from God is to take him at his
[56:40] word and believe it the way he sends it
[56:43] see we take him at his word but when we
[56:45] prescribe the way it comes then we get
[56:47] into trouble he says no I've got to
[56:49] believe it the way he said it and accept
[56:52] it receive it the way that he sends it
[56:55] he says now if we do not take it just
[56:57] the way we think it is we've built God
[56:59] as an idol he's got to answer just
[57:01] according to our ways or while it's just
[57:03] no good he didn't answer us at all God
[57:06] answers in many ways he answers in
[57:07] Peculiar ways times and everything is
[57:10] odd he says we'll take for instance
[57:12] Moses Moses was 80 years old he was
[57:15] almost you might think too old for God
[57:17] to deal with he was an old man
[57:18] unexpected in his age to be dealt with
[57:21] God another thing he was under Mount
[57:23] Orab an unexpected Place God made him
[57:25] had an unexpected age at an unexpected
[57:28] place in an unexpected way God didn't
[57:30] meet Moses the way he usually met men he
[57:33] met Moses in an unusual way in the way
[57:35] that he chose to meet Moses in
[57:38] we think it would have been so much more
[57:40] effective to not take him out of Egypt
[57:42] get him early Lord get to him at the
[57:45] start so that they don't have to go
[57:46] through those extra years of of slavery
[57:48] and all these difficulties that he
[57:50] doesn't have to go through it but God
[57:52] chose to do it because he had to get
[57:53] Moses to a place where Moses would
[57:55] listen and obey where Moses recognized
[57:57] who and what he really was
[58:00] he says that's the way he answers our
[58:02] prayer in the way that he thinks is best
[58:05] and remember we said this last service
[58:07] he and his way is always right
[58:13] he says if we ask for anything and it
[58:15] doesn't happen just the way we think God
[58:16] ought to let it happen then that makes
[58:18] us lose and fall back he says let's ask
[58:20] God stand firm on the word say it's true
[58:24] and just receive it the way he sends it
[58:26] that's the way you've got to believe God
[58:28] it may come disguised
[58:31] it may come in another way a roundabout
[58:34] way but no matter what way it comes if
[58:37] we ask we shall receive that's the
[58:40] confidence of the believer is Lord I
[58:42] have asked you I've laid it at your
[58:43] throne of mercy and Grace I've come to
[58:46] you I've let you know that you're my
[58:48] Jehovah Jireh and so I'm trusting you to
[58:50] answer and I'm on the lookout now for
[58:52] the answer
[58:53] I'm not telling you what to do but I'm
[58:55] telling you I believe you're going to do
[58:56] it and that the answer is on the way he
[58:59] says God said so that settles it forever
[59:01] if God says so now when you get to
[59:04] taking God like that and believing it
[59:06] now Moses what if he said I pray for God
[59:08] to make me a military man and here he is
[59:11] in a burning bush he says it don't make
[59:13] any difference how God appeared to him
[59:15] just so long as he appeared
[59:18] can we say that today that as long as he
[59:21] shows up that's what really matters not
[59:23] in the way that I expected but in the
[59:25] way that he determines to be best he
[59:27] says that's all that matters here as
[59:29] long as God comes and answers that's his
[59:32] part
[59:34] that's the supernatural but now catch
[59:36] this as long as we recognize it to be
[59:39] God and that's a supernatural as the
[59:41] coming
[59:42] I was listening to Jehovah Jireh today
[59:44] and brother Brandon would say over and
[59:46] over again he says the people only
[59:48] recognize it after it's done and passed
[59:51] and they miss the blessing they miss the
[59:54] anointing they miss the goodness and the
[59:55] greatness of God because they're so
[59:57] bound with blinders in the way that they
[1:00:00] want it rather than keep their hearts
[1:00:02] and eyes and ears open to the way that
[1:00:04] God would bring it
[1:00:05] and that's what we're talking about this
[1:00:07] morning now I just want to take some
[1:00:09] examples this morning of what this looks
[1:00:10] like because we can preach on this all
[1:00:12] day long about these great anointings
[1:00:14] but what does that look like but before
[1:00:16] we do I just want to drop this in our
[1:00:17] lap this is from the message the mighty
[1:00:19] conqueror because we're talking about
[1:00:20] when God answers
[1:00:22] how many are looking for an answer from
[1:00:24] God how many are praying about things
[1:00:26] and God hasn't given us the answer yet
[1:00:29] okay listen to this
[1:00:31] he's talking about them on the road to
[1:00:32] Emmaus he says and while they were
[1:00:35] thinking on him he appeared to them
[1:00:38] he says and that's the way he usually
[1:00:40] comes to us when you usually find your
[1:00:42] greatest blessing you housewise when the
[1:00:44] children's all gone to school that makes
[1:00:46] it tough when you're homeschooling
[1:00:47] doesn't it sisters
[1:00:49] he says and you're out by yourself
[1:00:50] washing the dishes or something
[1:00:53] when you're running the sweeper on the
[1:00:54] floor or something what when do you men
[1:00:56] when you're sitting eating your lunch
[1:00:58] maybe by yourself and reading the Bible
[1:01:00] on the side somewhere where you're on
[1:01:01] your road going home in the car and
[1:01:03] you're meditating on him lunch breaks
[1:01:06] the time to spend time with the Lord
[1:01:07] isn't it brother Grant he calls me
[1:01:09] sometimes when he's eating his meal
[1:01:11] because his thoughts are on the Lord
[1:01:14] right we've got to take advantage of
[1:01:15] these things don't we
[1:01:17] because what when we think on him then
[1:01:19] he comes our way
[1:01:22] it's so simple Church
[1:01:24] it's so simple
[1:01:26] we look and we say God I want to hear
[1:01:28] from you and we don't give them a moment
[1:01:32] we don't give them a moment to come our
[1:01:33] way
[1:01:35] we can't lay things aside for a moment
[1:01:37] and say Lord I need to hear from you and
[1:01:40] just lay it all down
[1:01:42] 15 minutes
[1:01:44] in the presence of God will change your
[1:01:47] life the rest of the year
[1:01:49] but you've got to find that 15 minutes
[1:01:52] now I'm not saying 50 minutes is going
[1:01:53] to do it but I'm saying start
[1:01:56] with what you got don't don't force
[1:01:58] yourself into this hour hour and a half
[1:02:00] two hours a day of devotions and prayer
[1:02:02] time and that you won't make it that way
[1:02:05] but if you can build it up slow just
[1:02:07] Build It Up slow start with where you're
[1:02:09] at say Lord this is what I got will you
[1:02:11] meet me here we get so busy but in that
[1:02:15] busyness we've got to find time for him
[1:02:17] he is the center of our life
[1:02:19] we've got to find as much time for him
[1:02:21] as we can amen he says but if we would
[1:02:25] let the thoughts of our heart and the
[1:02:27] meditation of our minds be upon him he
[1:02:29] would appear how often to us often
[1:02:33] if we would do that he would appear
[1:02:35] often to us but the trouble is we're
[1:02:37] thinking this is what we're thinking
[1:02:39] where we're going to make the next
[1:02:41] dollar what we're going to do here and
[1:02:44] how this is going to be what we're
[1:02:46] trying to figure it out we're trying to
[1:02:48] make it happen we're trying to say and
[1:02:50] believe and set a plan this is how it's
[1:02:52] going to go
[1:02:54] are we looking for our answer are we
[1:02:56] looking for God's answer
[1:02:59] don't try and sort it out we'll twist
[1:03:01] ourselves around and around and around
[1:03:04] and it's just a jumble of knots when
[1:03:06] it's all done
[1:03:07] and it does you no good
[1:03:10] he says what we're trying to where we're
[1:03:12] going to make the next dollar what we're
[1:03:13] going to do here and how this is going
[1:03:15] to be Jesus said all these things will
[1:03:18] be taken care of but seek ye first the
[1:03:21] kingdom of God
[1:03:23] what a promise you put God first you
[1:03:26] seek the things of God and everything
[1:03:28] will be added unto you such as you have
[1:03:31] need of I say praise the Lord this
[1:03:34] morning if I seek him first he answers
[1:03:36] everything else that I have need of in
[1:03:38] my life my health my finances my
[1:03:40] relationship my weight my all of these
[1:03:43] things God takes care of it if we will
[1:03:46] only seek him first
[1:03:49] if you're seeking an answer from God
[1:03:51] you've got to give him a chance to
[1:03:52] respond
[1:03:54] you've got to give him a time you got to
[1:03:57] give them a place you got to get quiet
[1:04:00] you got to get quiet how can he speak if
[1:04:03] I'm stalking all the time
[1:04:05] prayer is not just a time for me to
[1:04:07] speak it's a time for me to shut up so
[1:04:10] that he can speak as well
[1:04:12] he is the great God he's the Jehovah
[1:04:14] Jireh he's the all-sufficient one
[1:04:18] why is the insufficient one talking more
[1:04:20] than the all-sufficient one God help us
[1:04:23] to quiet ourselves Amen brother Brown
[1:04:25] says if we would meditate on him he
[1:04:27] would appear often often to us
[1:04:31] he would say this he says and yet Moses
[1:04:33] after 40 years stood there and in the
[1:04:36] presence of that bush and that one voice
[1:04:38] that called him he knew more about God
[1:04:40] in five minutes after that than all the
[1:04:43] 80 years of training had taught him it
[1:04:45] made a different man out of him it'll
[1:04:46] make a different man and woman out of
[1:04:48] you if you'll just stand long enough to
[1:04:51] hear his voice like Samuel did
[1:04:54] he says stand still
[1:04:56] don't be excited if you want something
[1:04:59] of God ask him then stand still and
[1:05:01] listen and see what he's going to say
[1:05:04] about it you know what brother Brandon
[1:05:06] would do this is the prophet of God the
[1:05:08] angel did not always come to the prophet
[1:05:10] of God and tell him what was going to
[1:05:11] happen
[1:05:12] brother Brown would say I would take my
[1:05:14] notepad and I would write down the
[1:05:17] questions I had and the situations I was
[1:05:19] facing he says and then I go sit down on
[1:05:21] a log somewhere and I'd say Lord here it
[1:05:24] is what about it he says and then I'd
[1:05:26] sit there for a while he says and then
[1:05:28] something will come over me or there'll
[1:05:30] be an unction and I would write down
[1:05:32] that answer and then he would go back
[1:05:34] and check it with the word
[1:05:36] and then if it lined up with the word
[1:05:37] then he would do what he felt led to do
[1:05:39] that's a prophet of God
[1:05:42] that's something I can do I don't have
[1:05:44] to be a prophet to sit still write it
[1:05:46] out ask God write down the unction check
[1:05:48] it with the word and then go act on it
[1:05:49] any one of us can do that
[1:05:53] sometimes he might send an Angel
[1:05:54] sometimes he might send a dream
[1:05:55] sometimes he might send a vision
[1:05:57] sometimes he might have the the minister
[1:05:59] speak it over the pulpit without
[1:06:00] realizing what he's saying but there's a
[1:06:02] place for God to come down and talk to
[1:06:04] us one-on-one and that's what we're
[1:06:06] talking about
[1:06:09] he says just open your heart up and say
[1:06:11] what about it Lord Jesus just stay there
[1:06:13] if he doesn't answer the first five
[1:06:15] hours then wait another if he doesn't
[1:06:17] answer today then he'll answer tomorrow
[1:06:19] if he doesn't answer this week he will
[1:06:21] next week he says stay there till he
[1:06:24] answers
[1:06:26] so we see that that persistence that
[1:06:27] diligence that commitment to finding his
[1:06:30] answer rather than letting the
[1:06:31] circumstances drive us to make decisions
[1:06:34] drive us to do things that are not
[1:06:36] necessarily in his will that's what gets
[1:06:38] us into trouble but if we can stay
[1:06:39] persistent to find his answer that's
[1:06:41] where the power is that's where the
[1:06:43] anointing is amen now that doesn't mean
[1:06:45] we have to keep praying about everything
[1:06:47] all the time either
[1:06:48] I've said this before and I've talked to
[1:06:50] different ones in this church and I
[1:06:52] believe we're at the the same way
[1:06:53] there's some things where I just go to
[1:06:54] him in prayer once
[1:06:56] and I leave it there
[1:06:58] that unction goes that burden goes
[1:07:01] whatever it's just right there I mean we
[1:07:02] get prayer requests from all over the
[1:07:04] world today
[1:07:06] we're bombarded by the needs of the body
[1:07:09] you know if you if you've lived in other
[1:07:11] places uh you know these different
[1:07:12] things you've met people you've been to
[1:07:14] other churches and you keep in contact
[1:07:16] with some of them then what do they do
[1:07:17] they send us all these prayer requests
[1:07:19] and we don't have enough time in the day
[1:07:21] to pray over everything that comes our
[1:07:22] way all day every day we just don't have
[1:07:25] the time to do it so for me you know you
[1:07:28] know in a Minister's group or something
[1:07:29] like that they'll put a prayer request
[1:07:30] you know what I do I bow my head I pray
[1:07:32] right there
[1:07:33] and I take it to the Lord and I leave it
[1:07:35] there unless I feel led to do otherwise
[1:07:37] there's some we'll all keep praying
[1:07:40] now if it's somebody that's related to
[1:07:42] somebody in this church well that tends
[1:07:43] to be a bit different that brings them
[1:07:44] one connection closer
[1:07:46] but our burden really ought to be for
[1:07:47] the local body because this is where we
[1:07:50] are and nobody knows how to pray for us
[1:07:52] like us
[1:07:54] because we know our weaknesses we know
[1:07:56] our strengths we know some of the
[1:07:57] situations we know what's going on and
[1:07:59] we love and care about us because this
[1:08:01] is our local body here and that's where
[1:08:03] my burden is and that's where the
[1:08:04] pressure is for me to pray for people
[1:08:07] again I'm not saying we don't pray for
[1:08:08] others around but for me most of them I
[1:08:10] just pray for them once and leave them
[1:08:12] there
[1:08:13] but if somebody says my brother's sick
[1:08:15] then we pray for that because they're a
[1:08:17] part of our body through that
[1:08:19] and these different things but it's it's
[1:08:21] just not something we can we can focus
[1:08:22] on we don't have the time to do all of
[1:08:24] those things amen
[1:08:26] but as we pray we also need to have
[1:08:28] discernment
[1:08:30] we need to have discernment about
[1:08:31] situations and I've shared this with
[1:08:33] some of you in private after you came up
[1:08:35] for prayer and a lot of times it'd be
[1:08:37] months afterwards where somebody will
[1:08:38] come up for prayer and they'll ask for
[1:08:40] one thing and I know that that is not
[1:08:42] the prayer that needs to be prayed
[1:08:43] and that's when the holy spirit's moving
[1:08:45] and so I will pray as you ask
[1:08:48] but it'll usually be generic rather than
[1:08:50] specific because there's something else
[1:08:52] in my heart that says that's not the way
[1:08:54] that this is going to be resolved is the
[1:08:55] way they're asking for it and so I've
[1:08:57] got to pray with discernment because the
[1:08:58] holy spirit's now moving remember sons
[1:09:00] of God are led by the spirit of God and
[1:09:02] so now there's something in my mind says
[1:09:04] be real careful here pray for them but
[1:09:07] pray in a way that allows God to move
[1:09:08] rather than do it the way that they're
[1:09:10] asking
[1:09:12] so if you ever hear me pray a generic
[1:09:13] prayer you might want to come talk to me
[1:09:15] after service
[1:09:18] because it means that I believe there's
[1:09:19] something else going on there
[1:09:21] okay but we say that we ought not to
[1:09:25] because sometimes and and again I can
[1:09:27] only speak for myself sometimes you ever
[1:09:28] pray and it seems like the prayer is
[1:09:30] just bouncing off the ceiling
[1:09:32] right you know what that is usually
[1:09:34] that's God's saying this ain't the way
[1:09:36] you're supposed to be praying this is
[1:09:38] not the truth for the situation this is
[1:09:39] not the answer for the situation and
[1:09:41] sometimes you just get an uneasy feeling
[1:09:45] and you just kind of pull back and you
[1:09:46] say well that's not the way prayer is
[1:09:48] supposed to feel is uneasy
[1:09:50] getting into the presence of God ought
[1:09:52] not to make us uneasy about what we're
[1:09:54] saying
[1:09:55] so that's God trying to tell us to pull
[1:09:57] back on these things and say there's
[1:09:58] probably more here than you realize and
[1:10:00] you need to just step back a bit and
[1:10:01] just let it hand it over to me
[1:10:04] just pray for the person pray for the
[1:10:06] situation but let me sort out the
[1:10:07] details brother Brown would say this he
[1:10:09] says that's the way in the meeting
[1:10:10] sometimes say well why don't you just
[1:10:12] pray for the people sometimes you notice
[1:10:14] in the meetings it has to be something
[1:10:15] the whole picture is Divine Healing and
[1:10:17] salvation but sometimes there's
[1:10:19] something in a fellow's way that keeps
[1:10:21] him from getting healed you hear it
[1:10:23] right here on the platform something
[1:10:24] they done somewhere else and something
[1:10:26] they've got to make right they have to
[1:10:27] do that before the blessing of God can
[1:10:29] come on them certainly not he says you
[1:10:31] can't do that you can't pray that
[1:10:33] situation out of their life or that
[1:10:35] sickness out of them he says but if that
[1:10:37] person had sinned and something in their
[1:10:39] life that they should not have done or
[1:10:40] they should have done catch that
[1:10:42] shouldn't have done or they should have
[1:10:44] done
[1:10:46] you can have a Jonas sometimes
[1:10:49] Lord telling them what to do and they
[1:10:50] refuse to do it you can't get them out
[1:10:52] of that situation because God's using
[1:10:54] the situation to drive them into his
[1:10:55] will
[1:10:56] he says you can pour oil on them day and
[1:10:58] night and it'll never do them any good
[1:11:00] you can pray scream cry cast out demons
[1:11:02] as much as you want to it'll never leave
[1:11:04] the person until they make that thing
[1:11:06] right he says that's right you've got to
[1:11:08] get right with God first
[1:11:11] he says and you have to be careful God
[1:11:13] dealt with Moses he's speaking about the
[1:11:15] situation where he struck The Rock he
[1:11:17] says he deals with the people so if God
[1:11:19] has put something on a person or let
[1:11:21] Satan put it on them for a purpose to
[1:11:22] bring the person to him nor do something
[1:11:24] then you come and take that off without
[1:11:26] this person repenting for it see what
[1:11:28] kind of trouble you get yourself in he
[1:11:30] says you have to be careful
[1:11:32] we're supposed to have discernment amen
[1:11:35] so let's talk about this lion anointing
[1:11:37] and as I've said before this is this is
[1:11:38] where we love to see God move this is
[1:11:40] the apostolic anointing this is the
[1:11:42] original Pentecost anointing and the
[1:11:44] lion comes in power and brother Brown
[1:11:46] would say he comes with sternness he
[1:11:48] comes with authority and nothing stands
[1:11:50] in front of a line when a lion's going
[1:11:52] down the trail if this was a trail and
[1:11:54] the Lion's here and he's going there you
[1:11:55] do not want to be between him and that
[1:11:56] door
[1:11:57] because everything has to move in front
[1:11:59] of a line he's the king of the beasts he
[1:12:01] knows his position he knows his power
[1:12:03] and nothing's going to stand in front of
[1:12:04] him he's going to move it out of the way
[1:12:06] but a lion just it doesn't try and work
[1:12:09] things out
[1:12:11] you'll never see a lion you know kind of
[1:12:13] uh having a a parley having a trying to
[1:12:16] trying to argue an animal into its mouth
[1:12:19] or to move it away it just does it if it
[1:12:22] wants it it takes it if it wants it to
[1:12:23] go it moves it out if it wants to eat it
[1:12:25] it eats it it doesn't sit and try and
[1:12:27] have a nice conversation with it it just
[1:12:29] comes in and boom and it's done
[1:12:31] and that's that line anointing a man
[1:12:33] with a lion when a lion attacks it's a
[1:12:35] finished work it's not going to put it
[1:12:37] that way and when God moves as a lion
[1:12:39] anointing it's a finished work right
[1:12:41] then and this is the supernatural
[1:12:43] element we'll see of Divine Healing of
[1:12:45] Deliverance of provision in these things
[1:12:47] where one one minute it's not there or
[1:12:49] it's there and it's then it's gone or a
[1:12:50] minute it's not there and then it is
[1:12:52] there and you just don't know what
[1:12:53] happened and God just moves
[1:12:54] supernaturally
[1:12:56] but this was personified brother Brown
[1:12:58] would say in the first church age
[1:12:59] there's four anointings and the first
[1:13:00] this lion age was the first church age
[1:13:02] in the book of Acts and we see that and
[1:13:04] what is it it's Christ proving himself
[1:13:06] real amongst the people again
[1:13:08] we see it in Acts chapter 5 and it says
[1:13:10] in that by the hands of the apostles
[1:13:12] were many signs and wonders wrought
[1:13:13] among the people and they were all with
[1:13:15] one Accord in Solomon's porch
[1:13:17] and of the rest their snowman joined
[1:13:19] himself to them but the people magnified
[1:13:21] them and the Believers were the more
[1:13:23] added to the Lord multitudes both of men
[1:13:25] and women it says in so much that they
[1:13:28] brought forth the sick into the streets
[1:13:30] and laid them on beds and couches that
[1:13:32] at the least the shadow of Peter passing
[1:13:36] by might overshadow some of them they
[1:13:38] had such high regard for Peter for the
[1:13:40] authority of God that was in his life
[1:13:42] that they were putting them under
[1:13:44] Peter's Shadow as he walked with the
[1:13:46] Hope or the belief that they would be
[1:13:47] healed just by being in his shadow
[1:13:52] that's a line anointing
[1:13:55] that's what it looks like he says there
[1:13:57] also came a multitude out of the Cities
[1:13:59] round about under Jerusalem bringing
[1:14:01] sick folks and then which were vexed
[1:14:03] with unclean spirits and they were
[1:14:06] healed every one
[1:14:08] now there's only one other place you'll
[1:14:10] see this in the scripture and that's in
[1:14:11] Jesus own Ministry where they bring
[1:14:13] people and thousands upon thousands and
[1:14:16] the scripture the gospels would say and
[1:14:17] he healed everyone
[1:14:19] now he didn't do that every time but
[1:14:21] there were moments where the allian
[1:14:23] anointing is there and what happens is
[1:14:24] nothing stands in its way
[1:14:26] he didn't sit back and say well you've
[1:14:28] got something wrong in your life and
[1:14:29] you've got this no the lion went in and
[1:14:31] it just cleaned house
[1:14:32] it just booted Satan out of every life
[1:14:35] it just cleaned them out he couldn't
[1:14:37] stand in front of it because that was
[1:14:39] the anointing
[1:14:40] but that's not every anointing that's
[1:14:42] not every time he wasn't always under
[1:14:43] that but that that that they were healed
[1:14:46] everyone is under Jesus ministry and
[1:14:48] then he comes right in behind it and he
[1:14:49] sits right in those Apostles and he's
[1:14:51] proving what Jesus Christ the same
[1:14:53] yesterday today and forever that's that
[1:14:55] Apostolic that line anointing amen
[1:14:58] but I want you to understand one thing
[1:15:00] that these anointings come with people
[1:15:02] that have character to handle them
[1:15:04] and this is the great balance when we
[1:15:05] talk about these things because without
[1:15:07] the character to handle it you'll turn
[1:15:09] yourself into a denomination you'll draw
[1:15:11] people after you you'll talk about it
[1:15:13] you'll make a big deal about it and you
[1:15:15] won't give the glory to God
[1:15:18] but everything the apostles did they
[1:15:19] said we do it but through faith in Jesus
[1:15:22] name and they give the glory to Christ
[1:15:24] rather than to themselves and they just
[1:15:26] like everyone else they would all the
[1:15:28] other Apostles they would always say
[1:15:29] they would point back and say this is
[1:15:30] him brother Brandon will come and he'd
[1:15:32] say I can't do it this is him this is
[1:15:35] him the character for a line anointing
[1:15:37] says this is him that's how you know
[1:15:39] that they're ready for him and it's not
[1:15:41] haphazard God doesn't just drop these
[1:15:42] line anointings into people's lives
[1:15:44] that's not the way it works because this
[1:15:46] is spoken word Authority so often
[1:15:49] and so you've got to have the character
[1:15:50] to handle it brother Brown would say
[1:15:52] this because you've got to prove
[1:15:54] yourself for some of these things he
[1:15:56] said some people gets the wrong
[1:15:57] impression about what the anointing is
[1:15:59] did you ever think of that when was the
[1:16:02] greatest anointing ever give to anyone
[1:16:04] and what did they do when they had the
[1:16:06] anointing this is a great question what
[1:16:07] was the greatest anointing and what did
[1:16:09] it look like he says the greatest
[1:16:10] anointing that was ever given to anyone
[1:16:12] was Jesus Christ so that's our that's
[1:16:15] our example he says we have the spirit
[1:16:17] by measure he had it without measure and
[1:16:19] one day he entered into the temple and
[1:16:21] picked up the scroll and read and said
[1:16:23] the spirit of God is upon me for he has
[1:16:25] anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:16:27] year to bind up the broken hearts to
[1:16:29] heal the sick and give sight to the
[1:16:31] blind he says and now we would think if
[1:16:34] such an anointing was on him he'd been
[1:16:37] prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:16:39] would come and here he was with that
[1:16:41] type of anointing the full blessing and
[1:16:43] anointing of the Lord upon him we would
[1:16:45] want to run all over the building scream
[1:16:47] and holler
[1:16:49] this is a a prophecy that's been bound
[1:16:52] up for 800 years and now it's
[1:16:54] personified in flesh in front of them he
[1:16:57] knows who he is he's ready to deliver
[1:16:59] he's ready to open prison doors he's
[1:17:02] ready to cast out demons he's ready to
[1:17:04] heal the sick and brother Bram says
[1:17:06] you'd think that we just be blowing up
[1:17:07] the church
[1:17:09] you think the minister would be blowing
[1:17:11] up
[1:17:13] he says but the Bible said he laid down
[1:17:17] the scroll and sat down
[1:17:20] remember the question was when was the
[1:17:22] greatest anointing and what did they do
[1:17:24] when they had that anointing
[1:17:26] God in flesh comes into the into the
[1:17:30] temple
[1:17:31] and he takes a chair
[1:17:33] and he says this is the day of
[1:17:35] Deliverance
[1:17:38] and he sits down
[1:17:42] if they could have recognized what was
[1:17:44] there
[1:17:45] everyone there could have been delivered
[1:17:47] healed set free
[1:17:51] but the thing is if the preacher is not
[1:17:52] running around
[1:17:53] yelling screaming
[1:17:56] we can't even say Amen sometimes
[1:17:59] I'm not talking to us here
[1:18:02] you're a quiet group you're listening
[1:18:03] I'm fine with that fine saying sometimes
[1:18:06] we think if we're not yelling and
[1:18:07] screaming the holy spirit's not moving
[1:18:10] that the presence of the Lord isn't here
[1:18:12] the Lord himself was in church brother
[1:18:15] Brown said with the greatest anointing
[1:18:17] ever
[1:18:20] and he sat down and he preached a sermon
[1:18:23] sitting down
[1:18:27] how far will we get
[1:18:28] if we had special meetings and the
[1:18:30] preacher was sitting down
[1:18:36] something to think about
[1:18:38] what's our focus on is it the delivery
[1:18:41] or is it the words that are coming out
[1:18:42] of his mouth because precious words
[1:18:47] precious words while he sat quietly in
[1:18:49] his chair
[1:18:50] the God of all ages the creator of
[1:18:53] Heaven and Earth sat and delivered the
[1:18:56] greatest sermon under the greatest
[1:18:58] anointing ever
[1:19:00] and we say if we're not shouting if
[1:19:01] we're not dancing if we're not speaking
[1:19:03] in tongues if we're not hooping and
[1:19:04] hollering
[1:19:07] Church were in the flesh too many times
[1:19:10] in our expectation of how God's going to
[1:19:12] move remember when God answers he
[1:19:15] chooses the anointing not us
[1:19:17] that's what I'm saying I'm not saying I
[1:19:19] love a hoop and hollering service who
[1:19:21] doesn't that you you get the full Buffet
[1:19:24] when it soaks kind of services but we
[1:19:27] don't always need a buffet
[1:19:28] sometimes we need a surgery
[1:19:30] sometimes we need something that's just
[1:19:32] exactly it and it can only come one way
[1:19:34] and it's not always hooping and
[1:19:36] hollering
[1:19:36] it's also not always just quiet and
[1:19:38] methodical either
[1:19:39] let's go the other way
[1:19:42] I can't be clinical all the time can I
[1:19:44] no no no we gotta move as the spirit
[1:19:46] moves us he says but the Bible said he
[1:19:49] laid down the scroll and sat down and
[1:19:52] precious words proceeded from his mouth
[1:19:54] that's what he did under the anointing
[1:19:56] the anointing is not emotion the
[1:19:58] anointing is supreme power in control
[1:20:01] knowing
[1:20:03] what and how
[1:20:04] no knowing exactly what and how
[1:20:09] it's very specific
[1:20:11] it's not haphazard
[1:20:13] it's not here take this anointing and
[1:20:15] run with it no no here's what it's
[1:20:17] supposed to be doing
[1:20:19] take it and use it the way it's supposed
[1:20:21] to be used
[1:20:22] and then we see that with Moses Moses
[1:20:24] had a line anointing didn't he
[1:20:26] Moses have word authority
[1:20:28] Moses had word authority and he went out
[1:20:30] and God told him exactly what to do with
[1:20:32] that word Authority because he said
[1:20:34] speak to the Rock
[1:20:36] he put word Authority in Moses mouth and
[1:20:38] Moses went and he got angry and the
[1:20:40] Bible says he lifted himself up rather
[1:20:42] than God and he smote The Rock twice and
[1:20:45] said you rebels you this you that
[1:20:48] he got frustrated and in frustration he
[1:20:50] used that anointing wrong he struck the
[1:20:51] rock twice and God said because of that
[1:20:53] you can't go into the land
[1:20:55] we look at Elisha we look at Elisha
[1:20:58] remember he's bald-headed at an early
[1:21:00] age and those kids come out and they
[1:21:01] make fun of him and he calls out he he
[1:21:04] curses them and two bears come out and
[1:21:07] kill him
[1:21:08] that was not the anointing of the Lord's
[1:21:10] purpose to kill children for making fun
[1:21:12] of a prophet
[1:21:13] what was it he spoke out of anger
[1:21:16] rather than character
[1:21:18] and every time you do it it brings
[1:21:20] judgment
[1:21:22] judgment
[1:21:23] judgment
[1:21:24] remember brother Branham the holy spirit
[1:21:25] said there's a trap for you this evening
[1:21:27] look out
[1:21:29] and he's got that couple making out in
[1:21:31] his meetings you can't tell me that's
[1:21:32] not a satanic influence that's Raw Pure
[1:21:36] satanic influences is a couple making
[1:21:37] out on the front
[1:21:39] and brother bam looks at them and he and
[1:21:41] remember the Lord's the angel says
[1:21:43] they're in your hands you do what you
[1:21:45] want and he looks at them and his words
[1:21:47] are what I forgive you
[1:21:51] because God's given him now the
[1:21:52] authority to speak he says I forgive you
[1:21:54] but don't do it again because judgment
[1:21:58] was coming next but he gave mercy first
[1:22:00] judgment second
[1:22:02] but you put that line anointing without
[1:22:03] character in the moment and it brings
[1:22:05] judgment every single time
[1:22:07] but not watch now
[1:22:09] because remember Moses greatest Prophet
[1:22:12] aside from Christ
[1:22:14] in the Old Testament
[1:22:16] terms of works and these different
[1:22:18] things but Moses
[1:22:20] doesn't have the Holy Ghost he's got an
[1:22:21] anointing on him and it is the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost but he doesn't have it in the way
[1:22:25] that we have in the New Testament but
[1:22:26] watch what it does with Paul
[1:22:28] it says and it came to pass as we went
[1:22:30] to prayer a certain damsel possess with
[1:22:33] a spirit of divination met us which
[1:22:35] brought her Masters much gained by Susan
[1:22:37] so this was a girl that had a gift but
[1:22:39] it was demonically controlled and she
[1:22:41] would tell the future
[1:22:43] and she met she was she was owned by
[1:22:45] somebody and she made them a lot of
[1:22:46] money it says the same follow Paul and
[1:22:49] us and cried saying these men are the
[1:22:51] Servants of the most high God which show
[1:22:53] unto us the way of Salvation she's
[1:22:54] speaking the truth
[1:22:56] this isn't necessarily something that's
[1:22:58] going to hurt Paul and Barnabas it says
[1:23:00] and this she did many days
[1:23:03] we're talking lion anointing now
[1:23:06] it says and Paul being grieved
[1:23:09] let me say it this way Paul wasn't
[1:23:11] grieved until he was grieved
[1:23:14] Paul was not grieved all along
[1:23:16] because here's the thing she's doing
[1:23:18] them a favor but there comes a place
[1:23:20] where Paul is grieved not for himself
[1:23:22] he's grief for her
[1:23:24] because she's under demonic influence
[1:23:26] remember the line anointing it's not
[1:23:28] about me it's about you
[1:23:31] God and we're going to get into this at
[1:23:33] the end of this service we think the
[1:23:35] gifts oh well I've got the alignment
[1:23:36] anointing I speak things out of my life
[1:23:37] the line anointings for the other person
[1:23:40] not for me necessarily sometimes it's
[1:23:42] for me but many times this is meant for
[1:23:44] service not for personal use
[1:23:47] if we can put it that way but Paul being
[1:23:49] grieved
[1:23:50] turned and said to the spirit I command
[1:23:53] thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come
[1:23:55] out of her and he came out the same hour
[1:23:57] so the line anointing finally comes out
[1:23:59] of Paul but watch what Paul what brother
[1:24:01] Brown would say he says Paul was
[1:24:03] correctly a prisoner he wasn't making
[1:24:06] any wrong statement he was trained by
[1:24:09] the Holy Ghost again to wait on the word
[1:24:12] now he had been trained one way but God
[1:24:14] had trained him another way now he was
[1:24:16] trained by the Holy Spirit to wait upon
[1:24:17] the Lord no matter what his Ambitions
[1:24:20] were
[1:24:21] he says now I'm going to help by the
[1:24:24] Holy Spirit show you something see now
[1:24:26] let's just take an instance one day Paul
[1:24:28] and Silas coming down the street in a
[1:24:30] certain city where they were holding a
[1:24:31] Revival and the little demon-possessed
[1:24:33] girl kept following him crying him out
[1:24:35] and no doubt but what Paul knew that he
[1:24:38] had the authority as an apostle to
[1:24:41] rebuke that evil spirit out of that
[1:24:43] woman
[1:24:44] just like Moses just like Elisha he has
[1:24:47] authority to do acts on Earth
[1:24:50] of his own choosing
[1:24:52] we see it
[1:24:55] but brother Brown says but did you
[1:24:57] notice he waited day he waited day after
[1:25:02] day until all of a sudden that's why I
[1:25:05] said Paul wasn't grieved until he was
[1:25:07] grieved
[1:25:08] because what the holy spirit said
[1:25:10] now we got us a situation
[1:25:14] Paul had to just deal with it and it
[1:25:16] didn't seem to bother him but all of a
[1:25:18] sudden brother bam says now all of a
[1:25:19] sudden the Holy Spirit speaks to him and
[1:25:21] says this is the hour then he said thou
[1:25:24] Spirit come out of her see he knew to
[1:25:26] wait on the Lord and there's where so
[1:25:28] many people today bring a reproach upon
[1:25:30] the word they go out with an ambition
[1:25:32] see Ambitions about me glorifications
[1:25:35] about him
[1:25:36] right Ambitions about being worships
[1:25:39] about him
[1:25:40] so if it's about me then it's not going
[1:25:42] to do its intended work he says how many
[1:25:44] revivals has been left flat because of a
[1:25:46] thing like that because the evangelists
[1:25:48] don't wait to see what the Lord has got
[1:25:49] to say some of them say come over here
[1:25:51] and they go right now because the
[1:25:53] association said go and the Holy Spirit
[1:25:55] would say something different brother
[1:25:57] Bradham especially early in his ministry
[1:25:59] remember the Holy Spirit the angel tells
[1:26:01] him this is where you're supposed to go
[1:26:02] he goes there they change the itinerary
[1:26:05] on him and he says this ain't the way
[1:26:07] we're supposed to go and he forces him
[1:26:10] to stand by the side of the road and he
[1:26:11] says it will not work we will not be
[1:26:14] blessed I'm having you stand here as a
[1:26:16] witness that the Holy Spirit has told me
[1:26:17] don't do it
[1:26:19] but we'll do it your way because you
[1:26:21] control
[1:26:22] you got the flights you got the money
[1:26:23] everything I can't go if you guys don't
[1:26:25] go with me but he says we're going to
[1:26:26] pay a price and remember brother Brandon
[1:26:27] had malaria I think for six months after
[1:26:29] that the meetings got rained out nothing
[1:26:31] good happened out of it because they
[1:26:33] didn't follow the Holy Spirit and
[1:26:35] brother bam learned after that I won't
[1:26:36] ever do that again because remember God
[1:26:38] wouldn't even hear his prayer after that
[1:26:41] because he told them what the holy
[1:26:42] spirit said but he wouldn't obey it
[1:26:44] himself he wouldn't stand his feet firm
[1:26:46] on his feet
[1:26:47] he says yet the ambition of the man to
[1:26:49] become the state presbyter or something
[1:26:51] another or some elder or some bishop or
[1:26:53] something would pull him you must go and
[1:26:55] yet he knows better the holy spirit's
[1:26:57] saying go here see he's yoked to his
[1:27:00] organization he's a prisoner to the
[1:27:01] organization but if he's yoked to Christ
[1:27:04] he's led by the Holy Spirit he's yoke to
[1:27:07] prisoner doesn't make any difference
[1:27:09] what anything else says he says it's a
[1:27:11] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol it
[1:27:13] means nothing because he's listening to
[1:27:16] what the voice of the shepherd
[1:27:18] he only hears the voice of God and
[1:27:22] he only speaks only when it comes out he
[1:27:26] says nothing
[1:27:28] or underline anointing now what is it
[1:27:30] when you speak under that anointing it's
[1:27:32] not you speaking it's God speaking
[1:27:34] through you and you're quiet until he
[1:27:36] tells you what to say when to say and
[1:27:37] how to say it and then you repeat it
[1:27:39] back
[1:27:40] and then it's a Holy Ghost speaking
[1:27:41] through him so why do I say that because
[1:27:43] it balances this this Doctrine and this
[1:27:45] teaching that is correct because brother
[1:27:47] I would say enough speak the word but
[1:27:49] the fact is we must be led by the Holy
[1:27:51] Spirit to speak the word because the
[1:27:53] word is the thoughts and will and word
[1:27:54] of God so you can't speak the word
[1:27:56] unless you have the thoughts will and
[1:27:58] purpose of God
[1:27:59] you can speak a word but you can't speak
[1:28:02] the word unless you're led by the Holy
[1:28:03] Spirit that's the balances that the
[1:28:05] seeking
[1:28:06] happens before the speaking
[1:28:09] seeking happens before the speaking
[1:28:11] otherwise we become a Joel Olsteen or a
[1:28:12] flow dollar or Kenneth Copeland or
[1:28:15] pick these different false ministers
[1:28:16] right we've got to be in God's Will and
[1:28:18] God's timing to speak and then when he
[1:28:20] tells us to speak then we speak these
[1:28:22] things
[1:28:23] now I want to say this before we
[1:28:24] continue those four powers were specific
[1:28:27] answers of God's attack of God to
[1:28:29] Satan's attack through the church ages
[1:28:31] but that doesn't mean that those powers
[1:28:33] or anointings are only for that age
[1:28:35] because remember these are the responses
[1:28:37] of God and we have a generational uh
[1:28:40] spirit or power like we said before
[1:28:42] we're in the eagle age that's the eagle
[1:28:44] anointing because we're supposed to rise
[1:28:46] above it that we're supposed to go
[1:28:48] ultimately in a resurrection and a
[1:28:49] Rapture but that doesn't mean that God
[1:28:51] won't use the line anointing in our life
[1:28:53] he won't use the ox anointing he won't
[1:28:54] use the man anointing either but all
[1:28:56] three are available to God to speak to
[1:28:58] us and work with us as he chooses but
[1:29:02] the overcoming
[1:29:04] spirit for the age is the one that God
[1:29:06] has designated you're not going to be a
[1:29:08] full Overcomer unless you get in the
[1:29:09] anointing of your age unless you receive
[1:29:11] it and for us it's that ego anointing
[1:29:13] it's that flying away it's that
[1:29:15] swiftness it's the sudden taking away of
[1:29:17] the Bride
[1:29:18] amen but here healing in particular is
[1:29:21] where we see this in different ways
[1:29:22] because we can see it through man we can
[1:29:24] see it through through God we can see it
[1:29:26] supernaturally we can see it immediate
[1:29:27] we can see it over time we start dealing
[1:29:30] with mental conditions and those sorts
[1:29:31] of things and God works in so many
[1:29:33] different ways and you see brother
[1:29:35] Branham he has one service where God
[1:29:37] literally creates an eyeball in the
[1:29:39] socket that's a line anointing that's a
[1:29:42] creative word of God that's putting an
[1:29:45] eye socket there then John Ryan gets
[1:29:47] prayed for and it takes him two weeks to
[1:29:50] receive his blind being healed back to
[1:29:51] sight
[1:29:53] and then he has these kids that come up
[1:29:55] and they're cross-eyed and every time
[1:29:57] brother Brandon would straighten those
[1:29:58] eyes out by the holy spirit because
[1:30:00] remember Sharon Rose when she died she
[1:30:02] was in such pain it crossed her eyes and
[1:30:04] brother Brown had a personal
[1:30:06] um uh empathy with with what happened
[1:30:08] there and every single time he would
[1:30:10] straighten those eyes out by the power
[1:30:11] of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:12] because it meant something to him but
[1:30:14] you have three different eye conditions
[1:30:15] one spoken word one takes two weeks and
[1:30:18] then one gets straightened out right in
[1:30:19] there
[1:30:21] but watch this
[1:30:23] brother I'm saying there's nothing like
[1:30:24] music you know God heals by music do you
[1:30:27] know that God heals by love see God
[1:30:29] heals by medicine God heals by prayer
[1:30:31] God has many ways of healing now listen
[1:30:35] to this depends on what you need
[1:30:40] oh
[1:30:41] that means what you need
[1:30:44] and what you need with the exact same
[1:30:46] condition may be completely different
[1:30:49] completely different see the need is
[1:30:51] based on the person not on the condition
[1:30:54] right so there's different there's
[1:30:56] different ways different means for each
[1:30:58] and every one of us he says sometimes a
[1:31:00] little love stretched out will just cure
[1:31:03] an old sore an old place that's been a
[1:31:04] grudge or something it'll heal right
[1:31:06] over just a little love and a little
[1:31:07] care sometimes when you feel all down
[1:31:10] and as we call it a street expression
[1:31:11] down in the dumpsy just put on one of
[1:31:13] those tapes that music or record and go
[1:31:15] to playing it the first thing you know
[1:31:17] you're patting your foot or your hand
[1:31:18] and it's all over then he says you're
[1:31:20] right up and ready to go again
[1:31:22] some one person needs love one person
[1:31:24] needs music Same condition
[1:31:28] he says now God heals in many ways a
[1:31:30] doctor asked me long ago said what's
[1:31:32] your opinion of medicine brother Brandon
[1:31:34] I said well God is the only one that can
[1:31:36] heal sir I said the Bible don't lie and
[1:31:38] the Bible said I am the Lord that heals
[1:31:40] all your diseases I rest on that
[1:31:43] but it's his choice of how he's going to
[1:31:45] heal he says and I said the Bible can't
[1:31:47] lie I said God heals by medicine God
[1:31:49] heals my love God heals by understanding
[1:31:53] I remember when I got in that bad car
[1:31:55] wreck back in 2006 and I couldn't sleep
[1:31:58] and I was on pain meds and I had
[1:32:00] insomnia all these different things and
[1:32:01] as soon as I found out what was wrong
[1:32:04] they finally figured it out I started
[1:32:06] sleeping
[1:32:07] no worry
[1:32:09] just an understanding of what was wrong
[1:32:12] allowed me to sleep and that's all it
[1:32:14] took
[1:32:15] he says God heals by prayer God heals by
[1:32:19] Miracles the whole thing God heals
[1:32:21] that's all all there is to it he is the
[1:32:24] Healer he says we haven't got a medicine
[1:32:26] that can create and create a cell in
[1:32:28] your hand to heal create in your body to
[1:32:30] heal we can move a tooth we can cut out
[1:32:32] an appendix or take out a gallbladder
[1:32:33] but who healed God no medicine will
[1:32:36] build tissue only God life builds tissue
[1:32:40] he says God's the only healer and we're
[1:32:42] talking on that
[1:32:44] he says I hope each one of you get that
[1:32:46] especially you people that's to be
[1:32:48] prayed for that's so uncomfortable this
[1:32:51] morning with maybe troubles that doctors
[1:32:53] cannot touch we believe that doctors
[1:32:55] help people I believe that God heals by
[1:32:58] medicine God heals by surgery God heals
[1:33:01] by understanding God heals by love
[1:33:05] he says just a little love goes a long
[1:33:07] way let somebody be all upset and just
[1:33:09] show them that you care for them see God
[1:33:12] heals by love God heals my prayer God
[1:33:14] heals by Miracles God heals by his word
[1:33:17] God heals
[1:33:19] that's the bottom line says God's the
[1:33:20] one that's doing the healing work
[1:33:21] whatever Source it is God heals by it
[1:33:24] it's God that heals for he said I'm the
[1:33:26] Lord that healeth all thy diseases so
[1:33:28] all of it should work together and men
[1:33:31] in different Ministries should work
[1:33:33] together for that
[1:33:35] you know what we have ministers come you
[1:33:38] get a Joe Adams right you talk about a
[1:33:40] line anointing of Faith anointing and he
[1:33:43] preaches one way and people get healed
[1:33:45] under that
[1:33:46] and then you get somebody talks real
[1:33:47] come and they show people their place in
[1:33:50] the word in a different way and people
[1:33:51] get healed by that and then you get this
[1:33:54] one coming and that one come in brother
[1:33:55] but I'm saying don't let the don't let
[1:33:57] the different gifts the different
[1:33:58] approaches the different anointings
[1:33:59] change your opinions of each other or
[1:34:02] cause conflict
[1:34:04] conflict can't be because of the
[1:34:06] anointings that are on us because it's
[1:34:07] all the self-same Holy Spirit but he's
[1:34:09] working in different gifts in different
[1:34:11] ways in each of us he says we should
[1:34:13] work together you got something I don't
[1:34:15] I want to work with you that's why we
[1:34:17] bring ministers in is because I know I
[1:34:19] don't have it all heaven knows I know I
[1:34:21] don't have it all
[1:34:22] we bring them in because that's what the
[1:34:25] effective working of the holy spirit in
[1:34:27] the body for the edification of the
[1:34:28] Saints
[1:34:29] amen but now we get the ox anointing and
[1:34:33] let's let's be honest this is our least
[1:34:35] favorite anointing
[1:34:37] nobody's praying usually Lord give me
[1:34:40] the ox anointing
[1:34:42] because the ox anointing remember is
[1:34:44] it's a sacrifice to make
[1:34:46] it's a surrender
[1:34:48] and it's a burden carrying a
[1:34:50] burden-bearing position
[1:34:51] amen and this is anointing where God's
[1:34:53] working with us
[1:34:55] rather than around us
[1:34:58] and so the work's got to be done in US
[1:34:59] God's going to let us prove his word
[1:35:02] by sticking with it until it happens
[1:35:06] and this is the long haul this is the
[1:35:08] long game this is the out in the
[1:35:10] distance the ox anointing is for When
[1:35:11] God says wait
[1:35:14] this is going to take some time to do
[1:35:16] this and we know this was the original
[1:35:17] anointing in the second Church age and
[1:35:19] it came right after the apostles had
[1:35:21] died out and people started moving to
[1:35:23] leadership of men and all of a sudden
[1:35:25] God puts this anointing on them to
[1:35:26] sacrifice themselves for the sake of the
[1:35:28] gospel and Christianity went under
[1:35:30] persecution the Catholic Church took
[1:35:32] over and they moved into the Dark Ages
[1:35:34] but this anointing was still victory
[1:35:37] that's the thing to see this anointing
[1:35:38] was still overcoming this thing was
[1:35:40] still defeating Satan even though so
[1:35:42] often it looked like it was just lives
[1:35:44] being thrown away
[1:35:46] right they gave their lives but God said
[1:35:47] it was their overcoming for that age
[1:35:50] right so when God sends you an ox
[1:35:52] anointing you overcome by two things
[1:35:55] your attitude and your response which do
[1:35:59] not change regardless of the situation
[1:36:02] your response and your attitude they
[1:36:03] hold fast to the word
[1:36:06] regardless of what the situation is and
[1:36:08] that's the power of the ox anointing is
[1:36:09] that you won't change no matter what
[1:36:11] you'll hold fast to what God has said
[1:36:13] you'll hold fast to what you believe and
[1:36:15] you'll bear brother Brandon would say
[1:36:16] this many times he would say you'll bear
[1:36:18] the burden of the Gospel I'm I'm kind of
[1:36:21] paraphrasing that a bit but we talk
[1:36:22] about bearing the burden of the Gospel
[1:36:24] when your confession is one thing and
[1:36:26] what is actually happening is other and
[1:36:28] we see that in Abraham very clearly
[1:36:29] right he professed those things that
[1:36:32] were not as though they were for 25
[1:36:34] years and that was an ox anointing there
[1:36:37] if we can see that we'll stay there no
[1:36:39] matter what it is and we'll bear the
[1:36:40] burden we'll bear the scorn we'll bear
[1:36:42] the apparent reproach no matter what we
[1:36:45] won't move from these things and we look
[1:36:47] at these and and as I was studying this
[1:36:48] Brother Brad would talk about these
[1:36:50] anointings in the in the fivefold
[1:36:51] ministry and he would he would point to
[1:36:53] these different ones and he would say
[1:36:54] the prophets the eagle and then he'd
[1:36:56] also say the Evangelist is the eagle
[1:36:58] then the apostles were the Lions and the
[1:37:00] teachers would be the man anointing but
[1:37:02] there's one thing that's always an ox
[1:37:04] and he never gives this to anyone else
[1:37:05] and he says the pastor is always the ox
[1:37:08] because the pastor has to be able to
[1:37:10] work with patients
[1:37:12] not force issues
[1:37:14] Pastor has to be able to preach and see
[1:37:16] the people not take it
[1:37:18] not act on it right away maybe not
[1:37:20] believe it even turn it down flat he's
[1:37:23] got to be able to tell people what
[1:37:25] they're supposed to do and have them
[1:37:26] completely disagree and disobey
[1:37:29] he's got to be able to do that it's the
[1:37:31] long game it's the patience game it's
[1:37:33] the day in and day out trudging
[1:37:36] just one foot in front of the other and
[1:37:38] the patient recognition that God's work
[1:37:41] is always perfect that's the pastor
[1:37:43] anointing you've got to be okay with
[1:37:45] what waiting
[1:37:48] it's always that way a pastor is always
[1:37:50] in it for the long haul and at Long Haul
[1:37:52] and it's to prove that we will trust and
[1:37:54] believe God no matter what we see
[1:37:56] or don't see as the case may be right
[1:37:59] because we go through things let's let's
[1:38:00] face it we go through things that will
[1:38:02] push most people away from the word of
[1:38:05] God
[1:38:05] we lose families we lose friends we lose
[1:38:08] jobs we lose opportunities or we turn
[1:38:10] them down if I could put it that way
[1:38:11] we're rejected we're scorned we're
[1:38:14] persecuted in different things we live
[1:38:15] our lives a certain way there's a
[1:38:17] financial impact speaking currently of
[1:38:19] serving the lord all these things that
[1:38:21] come in and people would look at that
[1:38:23] and they and then when things get tough
[1:38:24] you'd say you've done everything right
[1:38:25] and then God allows you to do that and
[1:38:27] they walk away why because there's no
[1:38:29] anointing in their life to hold them
[1:38:30] there but we hold no matter what
[1:38:33] now that doesn't mean that under Knox
[1:38:35] anointing God won't change the situation
[1:38:37] absolutely he does but this is a wait
[1:38:39] and see amen and he he's working in us
[1:38:42] to draw something out to prove his word
[1:38:44] in us that we're capable of holding that
[1:38:46] we're faithful soldiers this is a very
[1:38:48] familiar quote I know and it's in the
[1:38:50] message I know and it says why does God
[1:38:52] let troubles come
[1:38:53] God harnesses troubles puts bits in its
[1:38:56] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[1:38:59] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:39:01] fellowship with God
[1:39:03] listen job had an ox anointing
[1:39:06] and in the end he had a revelation of a
[1:39:08] resurrection that he was asking about
[1:39:10] beforehand and in the end he got
[1:39:12] everything back and he had a greater
[1:39:14] life and greater wealth but above all he
[1:39:16] was closer to God than he'd ever been
[1:39:18] why because that Ox anointing said
[1:39:20] blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord
[1:39:22] gives the Lord takes away
[1:39:24] he'd just hold fast in it
[1:39:27] now the ox anointing is a real trial of
[1:39:29] our faith because the answer never comes
[1:39:30] immediately
[1:39:31] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:39:32] and I want to I want to talk about this
[1:39:35] and this is going to be the the last
[1:39:37] thing we're going to dwell on this
[1:39:38] morning
[1:39:39] I'm going to take us right into the
[1:39:40] prophet's life and I've got a lot of
[1:39:42] quotes here to tell this story
[1:39:43] but I want you to see what this Ox
[1:39:45] anointing looks like
[1:39:46] he says when I was healed with stomach
[1:39:48] trouble while I remember holding my
[1:39:51] stomach going along there and when I was
[1:39:52] prayed for I didn't have nobody with the
[1:39:54] gift of healing to pray for me the Elder
[1:39:56] anointed me with oil I read in the Bible
[1:39:58] I seen God's word was right I knew he
[1:40:00] had a right
[1:40:01] though he was a Baptist preacher he come
[1:40:03] along and anointed me said the Bible
[1:40:04] said so he poured some oil on my head
[1:40:07] said now you'll believe you'll get well
[1:40:08] I say God I'm asking with all my heart
[1:40:11] let me get well I went right down home
[1:40:13] to start my eating I've been drinking
[1:40:15] barley water and prune juice for about
[1:40:17] three four months the doctor said one
[1:40:20] mouthful of solid food would kill you
[1:40:21] right now he says you know what I did I
[1:40:24] went right down home and we had
[1:40:25] cornbread beans and onions for dinner
[1:40:28] so the prophet from an early age God
[1:40:30] calls him to the ministry reveals
[1:40:32] himself to him and then he gets stomach
[1:40:34] trouble
[1:40:35] praise the Lord
[1:40:37] said no one
[1:40:39] he says I will never forget poor old dad
[1:40:41] how he cried
[1:40:42] and mother said I don't mind you having
[1:40:44] religion honey but the doctor said it
[1:40:46] will kill you I said but God said I
[1:40:48] would live and if I die I'm coming up to
[1:40:50] your house and when I meet you at the
[1:40:52] door I die trusting your word I said
[1:40:54] I've tried doctors long enough and they
[1:40:56] can't do me no good I took that big
[1:40:58] mouthful of beans and an onion great big
[1:41:00] Chomp of that cornbread and I started on
[1:41:02] it and I chewed it tasted pretty good A
[1:41:04] little funny hadn't eaten in about over
[1:41:07] a year of anything solid
[1:41:09] this is an ox anointing Church
[1:41:12] when I swallowed the first mouthful here
[1:41:14] it come right back up again
[1:41:16] hmm
[1:41:18] Glory
[1:41:19] praise the Lord for his healing
[1:41:22] when I did I held my hand over my mouth
[1:41:25] to keep it from coming up got me another
[1:41:27] Spoonful till I eat the whole plate
[1:41:29] entire plate full of them when I got up
[1:41:31] from the table I just had to hold my
[1:41:33] hand just as sour of acid as I could be
[1:41:36] mother called the doctor and he said he
[1:41:38] will die that's all there is to it one
[1:41:40] mouthful will kill him that's all there
[1:41:41] is here I was going across the floor you
[1:41:43] know she said are you how are you
[1:41:45] feeling I said wonderful fine she said
[1:41:46] you're about to die I said no ma'am just
[1:41:49] swallowed as fast as I could hot water
[1:41:51] in my mouth you know went on a cross and
[1:41:53] I saw they're all gone he says I got in
[1:41:56] the room and I started across the floor
[1:41:57] and he started saying I can I will he's
[1:41:59] singing the song I can I will I do
[1:42:01] believe that Jesus heals me now I'll
[1:42:03] take you as your word I'll take you at
[1:42:05] your word like that you know on down
[1:42:06] believe in that with all my heart I just
[1:42:09] got so weak I almost just almost fell
[1:42:11] across the bed like that I thought oh
[1:42:13] Mercy Mercy and I got up the next day I
[1:42:16] walked down the street you know my I
[1:42:18] didn't care
[1:42:20] he didn't die
[1:42:23] he says mother come in she watched Me
[1:42:25] All Night Long thought sure I'd die you
[1:42:27] know next morning all them beans was
[1:42:28] laying right there at the same place
[1:42:29] said what you want I said I want some
[1:42:31] more Beans and Cornbread oh yes the
[1:42:34] devil wasn't going to cheat me out of it
[1:42:35] no no God said so
[1:42:39] is he enjoying this
[1:42:42] is he having a good time with his
[1:42:43] healing
[1:42:45] he says every promise in the book is
[1:42:47] mine every chapter every verse every
[1:42:49] line I'm trusting in his word divine and
[1:42:52] every promise in the book is mine that's
[1:42:54] right he said whosoever will
[1:42:57] he says then said William Branham he
[1:42:59] says there might be a hundred William
[1:43:00] branhams but everyone he says whosoever
[1:43:03] will I know it's mine he says that's
[1:43:05] right I just said I believe you yes sir
[1:43:06] and I started on went down the street
[1:43:08] said how are you feeling brother Branham
[1:43:10] I said wonderful I go down the street go
[1:43:12] on mouth full of beans swallow them back
[1:43:14] no no I wasn't going to spit them out no
[1:43:17] sir I swallowed them back the Lord
[1:43:19] blessed them they were mine kept down go
[1:43:22] down there say hello brother Brandon I'd
[1:43:23] say hello how are you feeling wonderful
[1:43:30] somebody told me long ago brother
[1:43:32] Brandon you were lying he says no I
[1:43:34] wasn't they were asking me how my body
[1:43:36] was feeling I was answering how my faith
[1:43:39] was
[1:43:41] oh I loved it when I read that I started
[1:43:43] crying
[1:43:45] because sometimes we're in situations
[1:43:47] and nothing has changed
[1:43:49] we still feel horrible we're still
[1:43:52] swallowing whatever it is we got to keep
[1:43:54] swallowing
[1:43:56] and you say how you feeling
[1:43:58] I feel
[1:44:00] horrible
[1:44:02] but that's not what I'm resting on I'm
[1:44:05] resting on the faith that's solid and
[1:44:07] says he has answered my prayer
[1:44:10] oh I love when he said that my I
[1:44:12] answered how my faith was it was
[1:44:14] wonderful yes sir my faith was feeling
[1:44:17] wonderful because I took God at his word
[1:44:19] I didn't care how I felt I'd still been
[1:44:22] belching up I'd still say I'm healed
[1:44:24] amen that's right sure because God's
[1:44:26] word is right
[1:44:27] did you know brother Brandon never got
[1:44:29] his full healing until the last little
[1:44:31] bit of his life
[1:44:33] he went decades
[1:44:36] with stomach trouble
[1:44:39] but did you know that him lasting
[1:44:40] decades was Supernatural
[1:44:42] because remember the doctor said the day
[1:44:44] you eat thereof is the day you die
[1:44:46] and so the supernatural Ox anointing
[1:44:48] comes gives them Faith to keep claiming
[1:44:51] his full healing but in the meantime it
[1:44:53] won't kill him God lets it stay on him
[1:44:55] but it won't kill him but every day that
[1:44:58] brother Branham lives until he gets his
[1:45:00] healing decades later he has a sour
[1:45:02] stomach can't eat food properly can't
[1:45:04] enjoy food properly tastes good in his
[1:45:07] mouth sour in his belly
[1:45:08] constantly
[1:45:11] for the rest of his adult life he dealt
[1:45:13] with stomach trouble he says my stomach
[1:45:15] gets sour oh my brother Jax helped me
[1:45:17] around the house I walk right around the
[1:45:19] house just a hot greasy water like
[1:45:20] flying out of my mouth and walk to the
[1:45:22] pulpit pray for a people that was twice
[1:45:24] that bad and be healed I've had them lay
[1:45:27] my hands on a man with cancer on his
[1:45:28] face and the cancer left his face
[1:45:30] standing there and I was so sick I
[1:45:32] couldn't stand up not fair we would say
[1:45:36] not fair
[1:45:37] healing virtue God's using me there's a
[1:45:40] gift of healing and I'm sitting here and
[1:45:42] I got to deal with this
[1:45:44] God do you even love me
[1:45:46] We can question so easily because he
[1:45:49] won't do for us what he's done for
[1:45:50] others
[1:45:52] but he'll give you the anointing to Bear
[1:45:54] the burden
[1:45:55] he says and you don't know what I've
[1:45:57] suffered just mental oppression every
[1:45:59] seven years it's come all my life he
[1:46:01] says that's where I'm now 7 8.
[1:46:03] he says that I was so distressed
[1:46:08] prophet of the age
[1:46:09] Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 fulfilling
[1:46:12] prophet
[1:46:15] son of man Ministry
[1:46:18] so United with God that this that he
[1:46:21] would speak to him and say this isn't
[1:46:22] even brother Branham speaking
[1:46:24] and he has stomach trouble
[1:46:27] for 30 odd years
[1:46:30] I cried I begged I pleaded
[1:46:35] and I remember when I finally thought I
[1:46:37] had enough money to go to males for an
[1:46:39] examination the Mayo Clinic it said
[1:46:40] they'll find what your trouble is wife
[1:46:42] and I Becky there Sarah was a little
[1:46:43] itty bitty fellow I just entered my
[1:46:45] Healing Ministry he says and we took off
[1:46:47] the males
[1:46:49] he's had this sickness
[1:46:51] he's he he's literally producing the
[1:46:54] supernatural by a gift of Divine Healing
[1:46:56] and he can't access it
[1:46:59] then brother Brandon would explain how
[1:47:00] he had a vision and he's about to get
[1:47:02] his check up and uh this is much much
[1:47:05] further down or sorry this is before he
[1:47:07] goes down he has a vision remember of a
[1:47:09] squirrel and the squirrel is about six
[1:47:10] inches long and it jumps at him and it
[1:47:13] goes down his throat and it goes into
[1:47:15] his stomach and starts and he says it
[1:47:16] was tearing me apart tearing me in
[1:47:19] pieces from the inside out
[1:47:21] but at the end of the vision it said
[1:47:23] remember it's only six inches long
[1:47:27] so brother Ram has his vision and he he
[1:47:29] he he's not sure what it means and then
[1:47:32] he follows up he says now Mayo brothers
[1:47:34] the next day examined me said my father
[1:47:35] your father was an Irishman he drank
[1:47:38] your mother being a half Indian makes
[1:47:39] you almost a half breed you're just such
[1:47:41] a nervous wreck until you're never be
[1:47:43] out of it said otherwise you're healthy
[1:47:44] but that's just something that the soul
[1:47:46] and the soul of man cannot control he
[1:47:48] said you'll never get over it
[1:47:51] said the old timers used to call it you
[1:47:53] had the blues and it wouldn't leave them
[1:47:54] said when that hits you your stomach
[1:47:55] sours you're just upset and I said but
[1:47:57] sir I didn't do I don't do nothing I
[1:47:59] said I'm happy said that's right he says
[1:48:01] it's just out of the human grab bag in
[1:48:03] other words it's just a matter of luck
[1:48:05] or bad luck I guess
[1:48:08] he says oh what a discouraging thing
[1:48:11] but the words to think it remember it's
[1:48:14] only six inches long that's hung with me
[1:48:16] as my dear wife back there can tell you
[1:48:18] year after year I've thought of that
[1:48:23] he's got a promise of Divine Healing
[1:48:24] he's got a vision of Divine Healing now
[1:48:27] and year after year after year he keeps
[1:48:30] thinking about this
[1:48:33] he says I started to Africa I get some
[1:48:36] shots when I was getting these shots he
[1:48:37] said well I can't find anything wrong
[1:48:38] with you I said Thank you so I got a
[1:48:40] physical test to take my health
[1:48:41] certificate to the board so he said you
[1:48:43] know anything else about it I said
[1:48:44] nothing but persistent souring in the
[1:48:47] stomach all the time
[1:48:50] prophet of God had a persistent souring
[1:48:53] stomach all the time
[1:48:55] I said oh I've been examined I've been
[1:48:57] to Mayo brothers and everywhere he said
[1:48:58] but wait a minute he said sometimes an
[1:49:00] altar so little that barrier meal won't
[1:49:02] show it and sometimes it's too big to
[1:49:04] show it because an x-ray is only a
[1:49:05] shadow a little bitty ulcer you can't
[1:49:07] see it well it won't enough stick a
[1:49:09] whole lot of little itty bitty ulcers
[1:49:10] that would do that he said I know an old
[1:49:12] doctor up here that's found an
[1:49:13] instrument they got it now they can put
[1:49:15] you to sleep with the little sodium
[1:49:17] pentathol put a tube down your throat
[1:49:18] they just actually look down in your
[1:49:20] stomach and see what's wrong said he's
[1:49:22] your type of people he's a Christian
[1:49:23] said why don't you go see him I took his
[1:49:26] name Dr Van ravenworth now brother Adam
[1:49:29] goes to see him first and brother and Dr
[1:49:31] ravenworth gives him an examination says
[1:49:33] your stomach lines your stomach walls
[1:49:35] are so hard it's impossible for us to
[1:49:37] cure it
[1:49:38] and brother I'm supposed to go back for
[1:49:40] a follow-up to see if they can do
[1:49:41] something to treat it right to discuss
[1:49:44] what they might do he's been suffering
[1:49:46] for decades Church it hasn't held him
[1:49:49] back one bit
[1:49:50] he's still going up to that platform
[1:49:52] night after night around the world seven
[1:49:54] times healing campaign after healing
[1:49:56] campaign saying Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:58] yesterday today and forever doing the
[1:50:00] signs and wonders and works of the son
[1:50:02] of man Ministry and he's had Decades of
[1:50:05] stomach trouble no healing
[1:50:09] but it hasn't stopped him from doing his
[1:50:10] work
[1:50:12] that's what an ox anointing will do you
[1:50:14] think about brother Ron Spencer
[1:50:17] he's coming up on his fourth year of
[1:50:19] stage four brain and lung cancer should
[1:50:22] have been dead in six months he's coming
[1:50:23] up on four years and he doesn't let him
[1:50:26] stop going to that pulpit
[1:50:29] you know what for a while he took a bit
[1:50:30] of time
[1:50:31] eased off a bit let's see what happens
[1:50:34] and when it was apparent that nothing
[1:50:35] was going to change in the general sense
[1:50:37] he said well then I'm just going to keep
[1:50:39] swallowing it down I'm going to be
[1:50:40] taking my drinks I'm going to go up I'm
[1:50:42] going to preach my heart out and then
[1:50:44] I'm gonna go collapse on the bed out
[1:50:45] back
[1:50:46] and he does that service after service
[1:50:48] not just in his local church traveling
[1:50:50] around the country traveling around the
[1:50:53] continent special meetings preaching for
[1:50:55] people why because he won't let Satan
[1:50:57] get the victory what is it it's an ox
[1:50:58] anointing until the lion comes to take
[1:51:00] it away
[1:51:02] it's a modern day version of what we're
[1:51:04] seeing today
[1:51:05] and it is no less Supernatural than if
[1:51:07] God just clicked his fingers and said
[1:51:09] it's gone
[1:51:10] because how many people can do stage
[1:51:12] four brain and lung cancer and preach
[1:51:14] the word of God the way Ron Spencer can
[1:51:18] what is it
[1:51:19] it's the power of God
[1:51:21] keeping him alive to do the work of the
[1:51:24] ministry
[1:51:27] he goes and just before he's going to
[1:51:29] see the doctor a second time Holy Spirit
[1:51:30] drops down says go to the Catalina
[1:51:32] mountains and we know about that
[1:51:34] experience where the sword of the king
[1:51:35] comes down and he sees the word Eagle
[1:51:37] written in White Stone on the Rock I've
[1:51:38] been there it's a it's a neatest thing
[1:51:40] but you've got to understand he's gone
[1:51:42] now through 30 odd years of stomach
[1:51:44] trouble
[1:51:45] and God cares through the full 30 years
[1:51:49] but God cares in a way that's best for
[1:51:51] William Branham
[1:51:52] in the way that God knows not in the way
[1:51:55] that William Branham knows God knows our
[1:51:57] every trial church he knows how to take
[1:51:59] us through he knows what we're supposed
[1:52:00] to do he knows the effect it's going to
[1:52:02] have
[1:52:03] so brother Brown he's in those mountains
[1:52:04] now and he hasn't gone back to the
[1:52:06] doctor yet he says so I turned him there
[1:52:08] and as I turned into that little Cove I
[1:52:10] felt the presence of the Lord I jerked
[1:52:12] off my hat and looked around I thought
[1:52:13] he's here somewhere I know he's here I
[1:52:15] thought what is it I made a few more
[1:52:17] steps I said Lord you're here somewhere
[1:52:18] as I looked on the path and lay there
[1:52:21] laid that little squirrel that had
[1:52:23] jumped at something and missed it and it
[1:52:25] hit a bunch of choya that's jumping
[1:52:26] cactus and it ran through his head chest
[1:52:29] and stomach and he was dead he says that
[1:52:32] odd looking little squirrel he had
[1:52:33] missed my mouth and hit that choya and
[1:52:36] the voice of the Lord said your enemy is
[1:52:40] dead
[1:52:41] he says I stood there and I trembled
[1:52:47] you know what he did after that
[1:52:49] I mashed through it with my foot
[1:52:53] remember what happened when they killed
[1:52:55] those five Kings
[1:52:57] they captured those five Kings when the
[1:52:59] children of Israel were there
[1:53:01] and they boxed them into a cave
[1:53:05] and then they brought him out
[1:53:07] after they killed all their soldiers
[1:53:09] they brought him out maybe it was a gag
[1:53:11] was it a gag I'm trying to remember they
[1:53:13] brought him out and they said every
[1:53:15] child of Israel come up and put your
[1:53:18] foot
[1:53:19] on the neck of your enemy
[1:53:22] sometimes we've got a show we know the
[1:53:25] battle is won
[1:53:26] we recognize the spirit of God we
[1:53:29] recognize the presence of God
[1:53:31] and we just have to go and say here
[1:53:34] I see it
[1:53:36] and you're driving a stake in the ground
[1:53:40] saying he didn't work
[1:53:43] it is finished my enemy is dead
[1:53:47] amen
[1:53:49] you gotta show you know what's going on
[1:53:52] you got to show you know what the
[1:53:54] spirit's doing you got to show that you
[1:53:55] know that he has met your need that God
[1:53:58] has answered your prayer
[1:54:01] what is it remember Moses would say he
[1:54:03] says write a book of remembrance
[1:54:05] remember the day you put your foot on
[1:54:07] that enemy's neck remember what it says
[1:54:09] we're going to do when Satan at the end
[1:54:11] he says he's going to be down there and
[1:54:13] it says we'll look narrowly on him
[1:54:15] say is this the man
[1:54:19] is this the man
[1:54:20] really if I'd have known that
[1:54:24] I wouldn't have worried
[1:54:26] church I'm here to tell you you don't
[1:54:28] have to worry
[1:54:30] you don't have to think he's greater
[1:54:32] he's a little man he's got an
[1:54:34] inferiority complex and the only Power
[1:54:37] he has is what you give him
[1:54:41] he says I went back around sat down
[1:54:43] again sat there and cried a while
[1:54:45] and prayed looking down over Tucson
[1:54:47] miles below me turn back around and come
[1:54:49] back it's still laid there when I
[1:54:51] entered that Cove the spirit of God come
[1:54:52] on me again I went on around went down
[1:54:55] the mountain went in told my wife and
[1:54:56] said honey I don't know how but I'm
[1:54:58] going to get over this Dr ravensworth
[1:55:00] when he gave me the examination this is
[1:55:02] in the past he says it's totally
[1:55:04] impossible for you to be well he gave me
[1:55:07] a shot of pentathol that was to last me
[1:55:09] for five minutes and I slept for 10
[1:55:10] hours
[1:55:11] when I come to the next morning he told
[1:55:14] me the next morning said Reverend I hate
[1:55:15] to tell you this but your stomach walls
[1:55:17] are even so hard they're dried up
[1:55:19] I never seen it he used the name of
[1:55:21] gastritis and I went and looked up in
[1:55:22] the dictionary and said something that's
[1:55:24] withered away and said you can't get
[1:55:26] over it he said you'll always have it
[1:55:28] this is in the past he hasn't gone back
[1:55:29] to the doctor yet this is the initial
[1:55:31] examination he says and I would have
[1:55:33] been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been
[1:55:35] for the vision of the Lord he's pointing
[1:55:38] way back when 30 odd years he says
[1:55:41] somehow I know he says and I'll tell you
[1:55:43] before it happens in other words I've
[1:55:45] let you know it's done
[1:55:48] he says the doctor is a good doctor no
[1:55:50] doubt I think he's a fine man but I know
[1:55:52] I'm going to be over it it's done it's
[1:55:55] finished and I'm going to be well
[1:56:00] how many want an ox anointing
[1:56:04] sometimes that's what we need
[1:56:06] because the situation ain't going
[1:56:08] and we're not flying and we're not going
[1:56:10] through it
[1:56:12] and we've got to just bear down and say
[1:56:13] Lord I believe
[1:56:16] and I'm going to keep putting one foot
[1:56:18] in front of the other I'm going to keep
[1:56:19] trusting I'm going to keep confessing
[1:56:20] I'm going to keep professing I'm going
[1:56:21] to keep praying I'm going to keep
[1:56:23] knocking
[1:56:25] but I'm going to drive a stake down and
[1:56:27] say the day I asked was the day you
[1:56:29] answered remember Daniel
[1:56:32] prayed for an answer
[1:56:35] he prayed for an answer and it took
[1:56:37] weeks because the angel got into a
[1:56:39] supernatural battle with other Angels
[1:56:41] remember and Michael had to come help
[1:56:42] that angel get through to Daniel he said
[1:56:44] Daniel your prayer was heard the moment
[1:56:46] you prayed the answer was on the way as
[1:56:49] soon as you prayed
[1:56:51] but I got held up
[1:56:53] I got held up
[1:56:55] but the answer was on the way as soon as
[1:56:57] you prayed that's the way God works the
[1:56:59] answer is on the way the timing though
[1:57:01] is in his hands
[1:57:03] what is it brother Branham sacrificed I
[1:57:06] was listening to brother Branham and
[1:57:07] Jehovah Jireh the third one this morning
[1:57:09] he says
[1:57:10] he says what about our rights he says
[1:57:13] I've got rights as an American citizen
[1:57:15] he says you give up those rights to
[1:57:18] become a Christian
[1:57:20] brother Branham gave up his right to be
[1:57:22] frustrated to be upset to be hurt to be
[1:57:26] disillusioned to be disappointed to be
[1:57:27] down in the dumps he surrendered that
[1:57:29] under that anointing and he bore it with
[1:57:32] Grace
[1:57:33] day in day out week months years decades
[1:57:40] didn't begrudge the healing of all the
[1:57:42] ones around him that got it
[1:57:44] didn't begrudge the spoken word the
[1:57:46] Visions the dreams all the answers they
[1:57:47] got did not hold him back from showing
[1:57:50] forth the love of God the mercy of God
[1:57:52] the grace of God the goodness of God
[1:57:53] just because he had trouble in his life
[1:57:55] in his stomach it never held him back in
[1:57:58] his ministry that's how you know there's
[1:58:01] an ox anointing in your life it's for
[1:58:03] When God says wait and you say okay
[1:58:10] he's given you an anointing to hold you
[1:58:12] steady
[1:58:13] if the musicians would come I'm going to
[1:58:15] close with the scripture
[1:58:17] why say us thou o Jacob and speakest O
[1:58:21] Israel my way is hid from the Lord and
[1:58:23] my judgment is passed over from God he
[1:58:25] says why are you acting why are you
[1:58:28] saying that God doesn't see what's going
[1:58:30] on
[1:58:31] that that my judgment's gone on that
[1:58:33] he's not enforcing what I'm supposed to
[1:58:35] receive he says hast thou not known
[1:58:37] Hassall not heard that the Everlasting
[1:58:39] God the Lord the creator of the ends of
[1:58:42] the Earth fainteth not neither is weary
[1:58:45] remember when on Mount Carmel well he
[1:58:47] was saying well maybe he's sleeping God
[1:58:49] doesn't sleep nor does he slumber
[1:58:52] he says neither he's weary there is no
[1:58:54] searching of his understanding in other
[1:58:56] words you can't figure it out
[1:58:58] so don't try and figure it out but rest
[1:59:00] that he's sorting things out he says he
[1:59:03] gives power to the faint
[1:59:05] and to them that have no might he
[1:59:07] increases strength he says even the
[1:59:10] youth shall faint and be weary
[1:59:12] and the young men shall utterly fall
[1:59:15] but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:59:18] that's the ox anointing they that wait
[1:59:20] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:59:23] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[1:59:25] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:59:28] shall walk and not faint
[1:59:30] amen God bless you this morning let's
[1:59:32] stand if we would
[1:59:37] I know the things that many of us are
[1:59:38] dealing with and have dealt with and
[1:59:42] sometimes our only question is God
[1:59:43] what's taken so long
[1:59:46] why are you waiting
[1:59:49] and sometimes all God's trying to get us
[1:59:51] to see
[1:59:52] is his anointing on you in that
[1:59:55] situation
[1:59:56] to recognize that the victory that lays
[1:59:58] in you to keep you steady is the one
[2:00:00] that he's trying to prove through you
[2:00:04] to be still and know that he's God
[2:00:06] brother I would say get there in his
[2:00:08] presence and be still and wait and in
[2:00:10] the meantime be faithful be faithful be
[2:00:14] faithful say Lord I believe
[2:00:16] and you know what
[2:00:18] sometimes say Lord help my unbelief too
[2:00:21] right
[2:00:23] that Ox anointing just one foot in front
[2:00:24] of the other some of us are built for it
[2:00:26] I was talking to Dad last night and and
[2:00:29] he was you know talking about pastorship
[2:00:31] and that and he said you know I can see
[2:00:33] that it suits you in the sense that you
[2:00:35] can just do things day in and day out no
[2:00:37] variance no worrying no must no fuss I
[2:00:39] said yep
[2:00:40] but that doesn't make it easy
[2:00:42] doesn't make it easy
[2:00:43] but it's something that comes more
[2:00:45] naturally to me
[2:00:46] what I don't do easily is turn corners
[2:00:50] and so that's where my trouble is
[2:00:51] oftentimes to make that corner to turn
[2:00:53] that around but my point is to stay with
[2:00:55] it
[2:00:56] it's just one foot at a time
[2:00:58] just one step at a time so often we're
[2:01:00] saying I gotta get there I remember
[2:01:02] hunting up in the mountains sheep
[2:01:04] hunting with brother Jethro Steven
[2:01:06] and if you looked at the journey
[2:01:09] you'd never start
[2:01:11] you're on foot
[2:01:12] you got to carry in I had 65 pounds of
[2:01:15] gear and a nine and a half pound rifle
[2:01:16] almost 75 pounds of gear and we had to
[2:01:19] walk seven thousand feet up
[2:01:24] and you just look and the mountains are
[2:01:27] so far in the distance because you start
[2:01:28] on the flat and then you go into the
[2:01:30] Foothills and then you start climbing
[2:01:31] these mountains and sometimes it's hand
[2:01:33] over hand
[2:01:35] it's the only way you can get up
[2:01:37] and if you looked at how long it was
[2:01:38] you'd never start
[2:01:41] the beauty was I never knew where we
[2:01:42] were going
[2:01:44] I didn't know where we were going I'd
[2:01:46] never been there so I just walked
[2:01:49] sometimes that's all we need to do
[2:01:52] don't say this is where it's going to
[2:01:53] end
[2:01:55] just enjoy where we're at
[2:01:57] because we started walking by streams
[2:02:00] then we had to walk through streams and
[2:02:01] guess what we didn't have the full gear
[2:02:03] for it so we got wet and that was a
[2:02:05] little miserable until our shoes dried
[2:02:07] out a bit and we kept going then started
[2:02:09] getting a little steeper and we slowed
[2:02:10] down a little bit then it got real Steve
[2:02:11] then you had to push through bushes and
[2:02:13] all these different things and the going
[2:02:14] got tough but I knew that at the end of
[2:02:16] it we were going to stop at some point
[2:02:17] and my conviction was I will not let
[2:02:20] Jethro Steven out walk me
[2:02:23] I know we got to go somewhere I know we
[2:02:25] got to Camp somewhere tonight I'm not
[2:02:27] going to open my word and complain or
[2:02:29] say I'm tired or sit down or let's stop
[2:02:30] no no I let him do that
[2:02:35] don't look for the end
[2:02:37] just say I'm going to put one foot in
[2:02:39] front of the other today
[2:02:40] don't have to go all the way today
[2:02:43] it's not a Sprint
[2:02:45] we're not in a Sprint race
[2:02:47] we're in a marathon
[2:02:49] and just go step by step
[2:02:51] kilometer by kilometer week by week
[2:02:54] month by month let him tell you when
[2:02:56] it's over
[2:02:57] but know that there is a Finish Line
[2:03:01] there's an ending
[2:03:02] there's a time and a place where your
[2:03:04] enemy is dead
[2:03:06] and all he's saying trust me until that
[2:03:09] day arrives
[2:03:10] amen
[2:03:11] let's bow our heads each one
[2:03:14] Lord God
[2:03:16] Lord sometimes it seems the way is steep
[2:03:20] it's long
[2:03:22] it's tiring
[2:03:24] Lord It's drudgery from start to finish
[2:03:27] so many times Lord
[2:03:30] it's the way you've called us at times
[2:03:32] in our life
[2:03:35] Autumn we don't want to look at
[2:03:37] everything and say well it's going to be
[2:03:38] an ox anointing for this and an ox
[2:03:39] anointing for that
[2:03:41] but Lord when it comes
[2:03:43] Lord may we trust that the strength and
[2:03:46] the power of God himself is there to
[2:03:49] take us through
[2:03:50] but Lord May us look Also may we look
[2:03:52] also Lord for that lie in anointing Lord
[2:03:55] that sudden coming
[2:03:57] Lord that powerful display of your
[2:03:59] presence in our midst
[2:04:01] Lord we know not the day or the hour
[2:04:04] you hold all these things
[2:04:06] but Lord let us have faith
[2:04:08] Lord renew our strength this morning
[2:04:10] Lord help us to just keep looking and
[2:04:12] trusting
[2:04:14] Lord and when you show us a vision Lord
[2:04:15] may we put our foot on the neck of Satan
[2:04:17] and say this day it's finished our enemy
[2:04:20] is dead
[2:04:22] well grant us Faith to trust you we pray
[2:04:24] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[2:04:26] amen
