have you can use it [Music] or that we can find others that are also meant to be accepted [Music] we ask your grace now for the service speak to hearts and souls we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask him amen amen thank you musicians and if you turn the scriptures to First Corinthians chapter 2 First Corinthians chapter 2. start at verse 9 amen just a few brief updates I just got a message from Sister Kimberly she said that Michael slept well through the night and he's still sleeping so thankful for that what a what a trip they've had as Paul says he says I don't know what's wrong he says Satan's always being mean to me amen anyways God's grace to them and certainly glad to hear that Michael's doing better also talked to brother Ed hammermeister last night and he said brother Dale Walsh lager should be arriving next weekend so the deacons will be reaching out to him to see kind of what his plans are and make some arrangements there so that we have some certainty about what to expect but certainly pray God's grace and traveling mercies to him as he uh as he moves over to Newfoundland as well amen First Corinthians 2 verse 9 says but as it is written I had not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God in other words you can't it takes the spirit of God to know the things of God Amen a a chicken can't understand the things of a man because it doesn't have the spirit of a man inside of him and uh and Paul is saying here he says you've got to have the spirit of God to understand and know the things of God it won't come through the way of a man who's thinking or knowledge it says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually does discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen God bless you you can have your seats may you bless the reading of his word and we want to continue again in our series on in his form and with his mind and we're going to take the second part of of this idea that the word is a thought expressed amen and I want to we're building up to something and and I'm just going to take my time this morning I don't want to jump too too quickly I want to lay in a real Foundation before we get kind of to the purpose of this entire Series in the in the next service Lord willing but I want to take us back to this quote I read at the beginning and brother Brown says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5 19 he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for he has she has thus saith the Lord but as we start to dig into this deeply this morning I want you to recognize one thing and that's if the word of God isn't In You by predestination you'll never get to what we're talking about amen if it's not in you to start then there's nothing can ever be done to put it in you later brother Branham says eternal life has no beginning and it has no end so therefore you either already always had it or you're never going to have it amen you will have people that will live Everlasting in the Kingdom that are not a part of the bride of Christ but they never had eternal life they never had it from the beginning to the end amen we preach the gospel of whosoever will may come and then we preach that why because I don't know who's in and I don't know who's out and honestly I don't want to know who's in and who's out amen let's God judge that but if you look into the scriptures and you see the sort of people that God called guess what we'd have probably put most of them out Paul when he was Saul had an antichrist spirit and persecuted the true church Peter was wishy-washy in the face of persecution amen we just said what's in that man's life he has nothing he's he's doing the wrong things he can't stand up for himself he he won't stick to the true path and so he's definitely out but yet these were Pinnacles and and pillars in the church right so it's not what we see right now but it's what God sees from eternity from the start to the end that's what determines who and is not a seed of God Amen it's somebody that he saw in his mind before it all began Job 14 says this it says I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so there's an elect people Jesus is saying that will both see and hear and receive the spirit of God for their age amen and they are elected they are predestinated it is not by chance it is it is not just because they happen to be in the right place at the right time but God foreordains this and they are there to receive what God has for them at their particular time amen otherwise those people can't receive it because they were never a part of God and they never will be a part of God Amen he doesn't add you into the family you either our family or you're not brother Brown puts it this way he says so God in the beginning was life the Eternal one and in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it has to be somewhere to be brought back to so there's something to the word redeem the root is deem meaning you are you are deemed you are you are are considered your place someplace you're you're considered to be acceptable so if you are deemed then to redeem you means to bring you back to your acceptable place to to be suitable Amen to be accepted and so if he's redeeming it's because you already were something he's not taking you to something but he's taking you back to what you used to be amen so he has to bring it back it has to be somewhere to be brought back to so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts he says and this is in in the the church age book he says so it's a little more wordy as you might notice it is most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear God that ability has to be given him of God and he quotes Matthew 16 17 where Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven putting these verses together we see there's only one group of people and that is a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age and they are not special because of themselves okay that's the first thing we want to recognize is you're not special because of who you are you're special because of what he made you in the beginning amen there's nothing we bring in this flesh our our righteousness our goodness is as filthy rags the scripture says so we're not special because of anything we're doing or anything we've made ourselves or anything we brought ourselves to or a condition or anything like that he says it is one special group that receives the Revelation for each age that group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God John 8 then he says Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and come from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him it didn't just come to him but he says there's no truth in him there's nothing to respond there's no truth in him to respond to the truth that he's hearing amen there is no antenna to catch the thought or the mind of God there's nothing there to receive it it doesn't exist and so he can hear nothing if you take a radio and you break the antenna off of it what can that radio receive nothing it's a radio it's a human I'm human just like a sinner that can't receive God or someone that's not a child of God but I have an antenna and they don't why because he gave me an antenna that's tuned to his frequency now here's the thing they have an antenna but they only have one frequency and that's to hear what the influence in the word of Satan that's the only thing they're tuned to one thing and I'm tuned to another and guess what that nothing can change it nothing can change it you are what you are he says there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not then he says the group that can and does here what the spirit is saying and receives the Revelation thereof is that group described in First Corinthians 2 6-16 which we just read or most of it they are the ones who have the spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost amen so there is a group of predestinated people and when they hear this voice it has an effect amen it causes them to change in the first quote the prophet of God says the bride receives the Word of Life from Christ and he types it as a pregnancy right because the church is always a woman and Christ is always obviously of course typed as as the male so the thing you have to realize is that it's not a pregnancy and that you put something in that wasn't there because the word of life is in you already if we take this naturally to a woman she has an egg there yeah she has something that can be quickened but until she's with the man it can never be quickened she can never bring forth life amen but she has an egg there that can be quickened by the seed of that man and he says until you're in the presence of God until you are intimate with God the life that is within you cannot be born it cannot come forth it cannot start to produce and build itself into a real life and here's the thing you've got to remember that the seed inside of you the egg inside that woman can only be quickened by the seed of somebody just like her amen so you cannot be quickened by another seed a woman cannot be with a dog and produce life amen but if a god bride can be with God then it can bring forth God out of her life if a word bride can have a word seed inside of her then she can take the word and it quickens what is inside of her and it is the only thing that will Quicken is the only thing that will be quick and it was the only thing that will cause a quickening is when what is Insider comes in contact with the life that is outside of her in the man it's got to be the same thing and everything else will die you can put seed after seed after seed inside of that woman and it can cause all sorts of problems but it'll never bring life it's not going to happen amen that is the Revelation here is that when you come in contact with that which is already inside of you then life comes forth and nothing there nothing else will bring it forward and you can go time and time you can go around and around the mountain and nothing will happen until you come in contact with the life that he placed inside you before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen you have to oh if we can only catch that nothing's gonna cause us to live the way his presence will cause us to live the way his word will cause us to live when we truly let him be with us amen amen when we truly let him be intimate with us amen not just a relationship for the facade and for the the eyes of the world and the people in the church but when we truly let him come into us and give us what we have need of to Quicken that which is inside of us amen brother Brahm says you you're in a time space and the only thing that's Eternal is something that had no beginning or no end anything Eternal never had a beginning or it never will have an end see if you're a part of God the spirits that the spirit that's in you never had a beginning or it never will have an end and you're Eternal with the spirit of with the spirit that's in you so then what the what happens is what then in the presence of God by the hearing of the word that portion of God inside of us is quick into life and it starts to grow amen we realize who we are we realize who he is we realize what he's trying to do we realize that there's a purpose and a plan for us here and then what we hear the word of faith and that word of faith quickens what's inside of us and it starts to grow and build and multiply amen where you have one cell and then you have two and then it goes two to four and four to six or four to eight and then eight to sixteen and the more you're in it the quicker it expands amen because every cell is doubling doubling doubling doubling yeah so if you're not quickening if you're not growing then why is it because you're not sitting under the hearing of the word of faith amen that you're not getting yourself what in the thing that feeds your soul because there's only one thing that feeds the bride of Christ and that's the word of God Amen you can try the self-help books you can try education you can try all the things you want to try but there's only one thing that's going to feed the soul of the bride and that is the word of God because why that's the only thing that will cause the word to multiply amen it's got to have the same kind of food it's got to have the same source that its origin comes from amen it's got to be under the same sort of thing amen what happens otherwise otherwise it sits there and it gets stagnant and other things start to grow right other things start to build up and pretty soon what happens is you have what a miscarriage because it didn't continue to grow when the baby stops growing we've got a problem the food supply is cut off it's going to someplace else in the body amen so we got to make sure that what we're feeding ourselves is the right thing amen John 6 63 says it it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life that's what they have to be otherwise they do what they just become the letter that kills amen but their spirit and their life so the question this morning is is this life to you today can you honestly say this word is life to me amen can you say that without this word I will be dead my wife and I were walking this week and I said something along the lines of the world today is all about trying to find balance and fit the right things into their life and it'll never work because they're not doing it Through The Eyes Of God what do they do they're trying to strive for work-life balance we've all heard it right what work hard to get ahead but don't work so hard that you have no other life amen I have enough money to get what you need and have some fun besides exercise regularly get a good partner to share life with be educated and up to date to what's going on in the world travel see new things get New Perspectives support every cause and love everyone because everyone deserves to be happy amen do what's good for the earth and the environment stop climate change right and then for some go to church okay that's what it looks like for the world right now that's what a balanced life looks like for the world but the problem is that they're going about it based on their determination of what is the right balance for their life they're going about it with the thoughts of man and the way thereof is always what death it's not going to lead them to satisfaction it's not going to lead them to peace or rest it's not going to get them where they need to go amen and how many people do you see especially the most famous ones I think are the greatest example and they have hundreds of millions maybe billions of dollars and yet their lives are in shambles and they've got to take so many medications and so many drugs and they go through so many marriages and so many partners and they they wreck and they they binge and then they do what half of them go in go go by Suicide right why because they tried to bring a balance to it they tried to reach something and there is no end to it amen Satan's carrot is always dangling you never get to eat the carrot with Satan he just keeps moving it out moving it out moving it out moving it out why you take yourself all the way to destruction amen and then they look at all of this and if things aren't going well then what do they do whether you just say I'm going to put my time in different buckets I'm going to add a little bit more of this I'm going to change the balance in my life so that I feel better so that I so that things are going going better I looked this up while I was in the office 69 percent of Americans are overweight or obese today how's that balance working out for us I'm lumping Us in with the Americans not looking around the church actually we're doing pretty good but but when you look at the nominal World 69 of Americans are overweight how's the balance working out for you why do you do that because you don't pick the right Foods because you don't exercise because you don't have the right balance in your life we can't lead ourselves to balance we can't take ourselves to where we need to go away man so if we look at this for the unbeliever this is what a balanced life looks like and you see we have lots of wonderful little boxes here and I'm not saying they're all equal I'm just that's the way Excel works really nicely right but when you look at what they pull or bounce life through it's through what personal preferences opinions not just their own but those around them Family Values genetics guess what there are there are there are people that have proclivities towards alcoholism to be promiscuous failed marriages overeating sickness all these things pain avoidance it's the biggest one avoid pain I'll do anything it takes to not be uncomfortable appearances that's right how do I look physically how do I look at my work what's my reputation and then what the expectations of others and that's just a few I could have gone on and on and on but that's all the time I have for it but that's what they're pulling their balance life through is all of these different filters all of these ideas that they have and the ones that they value from people that are even outside of their life you know what half of the things people are doing today are based on what people like on on social media that they've never met and never really know anything about right it's all for the like that's all for the thumbs up it's all for the heart the heart and the you know not their heart but you know what I mean I'm saying right but when we look at what the Believers life looks like in terms of this balance we better see something different we better see something different all those boxes will be there and others but the way that it's managed in their life is going to be completely different First Corinthians says this for ye are Bob with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods so you're you're in a body you're in a life that does not belong to you so it's not yours to control amen you've got to answer to who owns it amen glorify God not only in your body sometimes we're so focused on the body but he says and in your spirit what does your spirit look like the thoughts you think the attitudes you have your discernment the things you say in your mind that are different than the things you do because you know you're supposed to do the right thing but you think something that's a little different but you say but I'm supposed to do this because I'm a Believer right you glorify them on the outside but in the inside the hearts it's a little further away than what your actions should suggests he says you got to do you got to bring the full package amen what is it to glorify God in your spirit means there's something inside of you that's greater than what's outside of you amen that that's not going to determine how you how you do things inside how you think and your attitudes and your motives and objectives First Corinthians also says ye are Bob with a price be not ye the Servants of men well John I've got to work yeah we've all got to work don't we but your boss is not your boss amen you're your boss because you answer to Christ he's the boss amen I I think I've told this story before but brother Cadre Diggs tells the story of a young man who was at a job and it was a good job and he was in a place that didn't have a lot of good jobs and they changed his shift on him and they wanted him to work evenings and that was fine with him but he says I'm sorry but on Wednesday nights I cannot work because I have church and they said if you can't work Wednesdays then we're gonna have to lay you off you know what he said lay me off but what he didn't realize was that he was their best worker and so they said say what he said yeah lay me off I'm I'm gonna have to leave the job then so they went and they huddled and they came back the next day and they said here's what we need you to do you come in they said how much time do you need on Wednesdays to go to church and get back he says well I need to be out of here by 6 30 and I don't know what time I'm going to be back right because guess what Satan will do he'll he'll pin you into a nine o'clock departure won't he just when it's getting good and then you got to leave for work he said so I don't know what time I would be back every service every Wednesday and they said well tell you what you come in and you work till 6 30 and then you walk out that door and you don't clock out and when you get back you pick up where you left off whenever you get back okay that's how God rewards those that diligently seek Him He said I'm willing to leave it and they said who that's not going to work out well for us I guess we can accommodate you amen amen Paul points out we're not our own we're bought with a great price amen and we're supposed to live like that price is something we can pay back even though we know we can't a man that we're to Value it above all other things Colossians 3 17 says and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him now I've said this one before but for any True Believer their life is based on the will of God which is the word of God that's quickened and revealed to them so therefore we read about that quote where he says the bride knows what to do with the word and she has thus saith the Lord and we're talking about a mature bride this is for mature people now what we're getting into but we're checking on our maturity this morning if I could put it that way right but the the idea of this is that whatever you're doing you're supposed to be able to say God has put his name behind it amen amen that whatever you would say how I spent my day how I Spent My Time Each portion of it is stamped with the name of Jesus Christ thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord that what I did on my phone was I saith the Lord that what I did in my computer was I saith the Lord what I did when work was done was I saith the Lord the people I talk to the things I said the way I spend my time is thus saith the Lord because why it's supposed to be able to give thanks to God and Father in the things you're doing so if you can say that then something's crept in that isn't of him isn't it amen you better stop and see where you left them then so often what we're doing is we're presuming because we have had unexperience with God that the way we're walking is his way and that couldn't be further from the truth think of Samson how many times did Samson remember he was messing around where he shouldn't have been messing around and he kept and he'd wake up and he'd destroy the Philistines he'd destroy the Philistines to destroy the Philippines Philistines until he gave away his secret she shaved his head and he got up just like the last time the last couple of times and said I will go out and he knew not that his strength had left him yeah why because he had broken his Covenant he had given it away he had lost the tie to God and he went out and what they do they overpowered him easily brother Brown said Samson wasn't some big muscular dude yeah he was a little scrawny tiny little man because he only performed Feats of Strength when what the spirit of God Came Upon him right so it wasn't anything he did in the first place amen you've got to be able to say is god with me and if he's not then go back and find him where in the path of his perfect will right where you left him amen so as a Believer we don't have a little compartment you know for for for career and another one for relationships and exercise and fun and pleasure and all these things right that's the way the world works but for the believer we have one thing and that is what the word of God and everything else has to fit in and through the word of God so you just have the word of God and everything automatically or will automatically come into its place and balance within your life if you run it through the word of God now Matthew 22 says Master what is the greatest commandment of the law and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment so this is the filter of our life right here then in John 14 15 says if you love me keep my Commandments I Love You Lord remember he spoke of the Israelites he said this is a people that with their lips they draw an eye to me but their heart is far from me yeah amen he says you're going to do it if you believe it if you really love me you're going to do something amen you're not going to just sit there and say Lord I love you I love your word I love the message of the hour no your life is going to reflect it because you'll be in obedience to what you're hearing amen it'll become a very part of you amen amen so everything that is within our life is supposed to come under the authority and through the filter of the word of God Amen and if there's something new that ought not to be then something is slipped through we've let the Phil we've put a hole in the filter and we put the hole in the filter don't we we put it in there it's not there we put it in there we open up we say well that's not what it means or that doesn't apply to me or God has Grace no no no no no you put the filter then you're going to reap amen you're going to reap the problem because scripture says uh you know God is Not mocked whatsoever a man shall shall sow that shall he also reap see because the word says there's a consequence for everything that we do and you think well I'm a Child of God he'll just forgive me no that's not the way it works he will forgive you but the difference between you and the world is that when it when the bad thing happens to you when the correction happens to you you'll learn from it right that he'll turn it into something good because it'll pull you away from that thing you're doing from those people you're around from whatever it is that you've done that's outside of the word of God and he'll turn that around and he'll get you to learn a lesson so that you don't do it again right rest of the world they'll just get hurt and they'll come back and do it again and again and again and again because they like it too much amen but he'll show you you don't want to do this because of the effect it has in your life so what it looks like now for the Believers that we have all of these very same things but we just have one thing and the thing that surrounds all of this is the word of God and if it can't get through the word then it doesn't get in here it can't get in there right and we talked about it last time whether whether it's it's money that never has the preeminence gotta provide amen the entertainment we have you run you really can't do much in terms of entertainment these days in terms of anything with the world has it's just not there anymore education where we go what we do how we spend our time what it takes us away from all these things they feed into these different things amen I read this quote just before I came to the pulpit and so I don't have it in my slides but brother Bram said this in the message enticing Spirits he says give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that'll put God first in everything and I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first amen amen I was talking with a brother this week and and sharing just just some of the things that God has done for me in my career and my testimony to him has never been that it was always because I was the best or the greatest or the smartest or the most capable but that God gave me favor with my bosses and I've always said that I'm not a stupid person I'm well educated but there's lots of smart well-educated people out there Amen in the big pond I'm a little fish and yet by Grace God has treated me like a big fish in those ponds and it's his grace that's done and I've never I've never thought otherwise you know and I was encouraging him to seek what the will of God and seek the kingdom of God first rather than what success because God will give you as much success as you can handle that's it and then when you reach the Pinnacle of what he thinks you can handle then he'll leave you there and you'll be fine with it and you'll be content with it because you followed him all along the way right brother or Paul says this in Romans 6 he says no you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so in other words whatever you spend your time and money and energy on that's your master so if you're seeking one thing and it's outside the word of God then your master is outside the word of God but if you're seek him first the kingdom of God and it's according to the word then it's going to lead you into what righteousness he says everything else leads to death but God be thanked that ye were the Servants of sin until the new birth we all were whether we were raised in the message raised in a Christian Home rarely did anything like the Rich Young Ruler you're still what the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you being then made free from sin ye become the Servants of righteousness brother man puts it this way in the spoken words the original seat he says the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed he says as long as it's laying here just like this it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God Amen listen now he says them Visions come power comes humility comes oh we love the power and we love the Visions wouldn't we how about the humility he says all your know-it-all is gone I'm gonna stop here because I've got to quote maybe I'll share the full thing in another service but brother Brown said when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word wow what about prophets brother John remember when the the woman came the shooter my woman I believe came to to to the prophet and he saw she was troubled and and he says I don't know what's going on God has hidden this thing from me right brother Brown says God only reveals To His prophets and the servants the things they need to know that's it so they don't have an answer for everyone they're not called to give an answer to everything but they have what they need to know he says all your know-it-all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives there it is because he died I live when I die he lives again and when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself so in order I can have his life and how do I do it by taking his word his seed put it in put a seed in here by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said amen the prophet's giving instruction and he says you've got a seed inside of you because that's the sieging of God but you've got to keep what taking the word of God and planting it into your life to produce the fruit of the spirit you've got to be packing inside of you to feed your soul so it will produce the Life of Christ amen amen once you have the experience it's got to keep fed amen you got to keep pushing it you got to keep watering you you got to keep giving it the same thing that started it amen right it's got to be the same thing that started amen otherwise it's just going to wither and die on the vine so to speak amen otherwise what happens it'll try and choke out the life of God inside of you amen and I'll try and what eat up the fruit of the spirit it'll steal the fruit of the spirit is what it's going to do amen it'll steal your discernment it steals your passion to serve God and it'll draw you away from The Fellowship of the Saints yeah it's easy to see it's easy to see because people get less and less satisfied with their life then they start to pull away from the church they start to pull away from the word of God and then pretty soon they're out there doing their own thing why because they didn't keep feeding their experience amen and here's the thing this is blunt if it dies like that it never started in the first place because what once it starts it can never die once the the new birth does not die can I put it that way the new birth does not die why because it's eternal life quickened inside of you so if you're going out and coming in going out and coming in there's a problem because that's not the way eternal life Works amen once and for all right it's done you're sealed to the day of your Redemption until you get to that place it'll be in and out in and out in and out doesn't mean you're not a child of God just means you haven't received a new birth yet amen let's look at another quote just to settle this thought this is speaking of Jesus it says notice see his sinless nature expressed what he was he then if his sinless nature God expressed himself through that sinless nature it shows that our nature is evil why because the things that we express by Nature are evil so he says what's in because the things you do are evil that means that what's inside of you is evil to start with and no matter how much we try to patch it up how much we try to indoctrinate it with other things it's got to become sinless like he was and then God's word can flow through it now listen to what he says he says that doesn't mean perfection in yourself you can't be that praise the Lord that I don't have to worry about the Perfection part yeah he says but you see even our people are getting away from the practice of Holiness in other words they're saying I can't be perfect so I don't need to worry so much about what I look like about the things I do the things I say how I spend my time money and energy it doesn't matter because he's my sinless perfection but that's not it that has nothing to do with it he says we begin to let down so many bars see so he's saying what you've got to come back to what the Highway of Holiness he says we got to come to that place in our profession he is our example he is our sin Bearer and then if we profess that he is our Peacemaker he's our propitiation then if we profess that then that is supposed to reflect him back in us why because we're looking to him the author and finisher of our faith it says and we are a written epistle a Looking Glass that people can see Christ in us we're reflecting him and then people can look at us and see him right because the moon reflects what the light of the sun she has no light of her own right he says and now if they don't then we're looking at something else and we're not looking to him he says if they can't see Christ in you the problem isn't necessarily them but maybe you're looking at the wrong thing too now listen they're still not the majority of the world will never recognize Christ in us okay I'm not saying that but he's saying if somebody that ought to recognize Christ doesn't recognize Christ and the problems in you not in them says Look to Him all the ends of the world and live that's the only way you can he says a man can't be that in himself there's no way to educate it to it there's no way to join it there's no way to baptize it there's no way of doing nothing to it only kill it and then let it be born again and the new nature comes in that's the only way kill that nature of yourself and then the world becomes a living thing it just expresses itself through you see then you're looking in the Looking Glass when people sees you as a mirror because you know God has made a way catch this people won't read the Bible so God has made you a Bible you are what you do people is looking at you Glory listen the only thing most people are reading the Bible for is to go in and and catch what somebody says is a contradiction or that it supports their social agenda or their latest politics or ideologies and whatnot nobody's looking at it to truly understand it and be a part of it they're just looking at to pick and choose the things that support the little the little isms that they have amen but the prophet of God we're talking about remember the word is a thought expressed and so much of the focus is on what we're going to say you know and and third poll and spoken word and all these things and the prophet of God's pointing and he says the first way the word is a thought expressed is in your life amen you're the word of God for the people to read they won't read the Bible maybe they won't read it maybe they don't even know about it but they can see you and notice how you live and that is the expression of the word of God to them and it will be their judge at the final day your life will be their judge my question is can your life stand up to that amen amen what kind of attitude are we to have if he could turn his head when they slapped him and spit him and punched him and all these things what are we to be able to do amen what are we to be ignorant of listen we're in this world not of it and yet so often we know so much about the things that have nothing to do with the kingdom of God now some of it's just because we're in the world and you you hear things and you see things but let us not be seeking those things which have nothing to do with the kingdom of God Amen second Corinthians 3 says Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination Commendation from you Paul's saying do we need a letter of recommendation to come into the church he says ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known in red of all men Paul says you Corinthian Church what has happened in your life since you've said under the teaching of the word through US you're our proof you're our letter of recommendation now if you notice the Corinthian Church was one of the worst that gives me hope that the ones I received the most instruction and perhaps some of the greatest frustration from Paul for their their lack of fervency in their ins and outs and their UPS you know all these different things that Yeti says still you're our Epistles seen him right about men there has been a change and it's taken you in the right direction amen don't get caught up on how bad you are look at what you used to be and look at where you are now and say if there's a difference then praise God he's moving me amen and he'll move you along he'll get you all the way to the Finish Line amen Paul's saying you're our proof of what we preach that it's true and it's real he says for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ Minister by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart that that phrase manifestly declare means to make actual invisible so in other words it is the literal interpretation of what Paul preached he says you are the literal interpretation of my word church Corinthian Church as bad as you are you're the literal interpretation of the word that I've been preaching to you amen what is it the word is a thought expressed they became the word that was spoken to them and they received it with joy and what did it do it produced the life of the word that was there amen amen amen amen it's not just about saying the right thing it's about recognizing the word and then expressing that out through your life amen that's a that's always the first sign of the Believers the first expression is what that they have a life change brother brother Brandon would would talk about Peter and John he says in scripture says it he says they looked on them and they saw that they were ignorant and unlearned but they knew they had been with Jesus ignorant and unlearned but yet they knew they had been with Jesus amen something that changed Peter wasn't wishy-washy anymore Peter had boldness Peter was actually eloquent enough to convince 3 000 Souls not by eloquence but by what the Holy Spirit flowing through him giving them the word of life and they received it with joy into their hearts amen like I said we're talking about a mature bride now and all we're doing is checking up on our maturity this morning amen and this is not a half in and half out Pride this is an All or Nothing bride and she is committed holy to the word of God amen amen and you can't move forward with god without separating from the things of the world cannot do it brother Bob says this about the scripture he says ye are written Epistles red of all men he says I translate that turn it around this way see just turn around you are Epistles that has been written because you can't add nothing to it you can't add nothing to the word he says that's red of all man manifest the word of God in other words and Peter and John to show it when they went up there they perceived there it is this is what I was talking about they perceived they were ignorant and unlearned they had no education but they take a notice that they have been with Jesus see they were ignorant and unlearning but they were written Epistles see read that they had been with Jesus because Jesus was manifesting himself through them Christ veiled in their flesh remember saying in his form Christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive he says like he was in Moses when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh that'll choke every denominational believer when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh see the only thing he'd done was change his mask not his word and not his nature he's the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David and Joseph on down until he come to the fullness of the godhead bodily see it's still the same God Amen he says I hope that gets through see it is the same God but he just takes on another Veil he says now notice Made Alive it's for us he says and today when the word is manifested in human vessels plural because everyone will put this on Malachi 4. yeah yeah Malachi 4 this is what he's talking about he says human vessels plural veils plural it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God Amen his word will not return unto him void he says being baptized into him according to First Corinthians 12 we become identified with him amen amen speaking of Moses he says but you see he identified himself as God's Prophet for what he said come to pass then they knowed he had the word of the Lord Pharaoh had Spears but Moses had the word so when they got to the Sea the spears all went under the sea now most people would have said I'll take the spears over the word every time but when they came to what the separating Waters the waters consumed the Spears and the word walked right on through amen when they went to the Sea the spears all went undersea and Moses took Israel across the sea on dry land why because he had the word and he was the word of that hour Moses was the word may manifest for that hour Elijah was the word may manifest for that hour Christ is the word made manifest and the promises that he made a little while in the world seeth me no more you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also he says he promised these things what is it it's the characteristic of God displaying his word like he did in all ages this is not a new thing this is not just for the the laodicein or the bride age this he's been doing it all along that's why brother Brahm says after the Seven Seals he says the Bible became a new book and if you can't see who Christ if you can't see Christ in every page go back and read it again because he's been revealing himself all the way through from Genesis to Revelation so he's not just doing it with them but he's got to take it all the way to us amen amen I'm trying to paint a picture here this morning because so much we're caught up in this idea of I need to have faith to to to have the spoken word or I need to have faith to have the third poll amen it's not about you and I just getting enough Faith to say something and it happens the way we said it it's so much bigger than that and it's so much simpler than that Amen brother Graham said Moses had the word for the hour and Moses was the word of that hour and then Moses was the word may manifest for that hour so what the key is not necessarily faith in and of itself but the key is do you have the word of God for you for this hour because that's what made the difference with Moses amen Moses was always a deliverer you always were a child of God you always were the bride of Christ that is not in question amen but he wasn't always the word manifested why because he went and he kills that Egyptian and then he tries to judge the children of Israel what ahead of his time he was still a deliverer but until he came into the presence of God until he her he met the I am until he got a commission of what to do and how to do it and to whom he should do it he was not the word but as soon as he got that he became the word and nothing could stand before him why he had found the word for his hour he stepped into it and brother Graham says that was Christ that was Christ right there he wasn't dead up to that point he was always going to be it but he wasn't it yet until he had that burning bush experience until you have your burning bush experience you're not going to be the word made flesh doesn't mean you aren't going to be just means you're maybe not it yet and I'm not speaking like I'm the same as Paul not as if I have attained by any means a seat this morning no man amen I we're all in this together and I'm preaching it to me as much as I am to you amen but the thing is the word for your hour is what makes you display the attributes of God that he has ordained for you amen for you we're not going to display all things to all people we're not all called into the ministry we're not all called We're Not all men we're not all women amen we're not all called to be educated we're not all we're so different God has just a an absolute variety of attributes and guess what he gives us a bunch of different people to express them yes yes amen because the fullness is now in a multi-member body not in any one of us individually right yes yes so the question is what does God want you to display I'm looking for what he wants me and you look for what he wants you and that's when you'll step into the word and that's when you'll step into what third pull that's when you'll step in the spoken word because you'll know exactly what he wants you to do with the word that he has given you amen amen not just the word pick this up and try and make every little bit of it live in your life and you won't do it why because it's not all meant for you brother Brian would even go so far you talk about you say listen Moses didn't go around building arcs the word was there that's the word the word was there but that was not Moses word and David didn't live by Moses word in the sense of Moses doing what he had to do each and every one of them got their own marching instructions from God Amen John 5 and they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God okay you're saying brother John how do I find out what I'm supposed to do this is the answer Jesus answered said unto them this is the work so they asked Works he said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he have sent brother Bible point to this and say the word of God is the work of God is to receive the word of the word of God for your age and for your hour amen that doesn't just mean the prophet of Malachi 4. but it starts there we believe because we've received this message amen because we paced ourselves in our time in our age in our Bible and so that no that lets us know that there had to come a Malachi 4. so we hear him but it doesn't end when he leaves the scene does it because the spirit keeps talking to us amen why because you have the spirit in you it wasn't only in brother Branham yeah yeah it's got to be in you otherwise you're dead right yes sir you've got to receive the ones that God sends and guess what they might look like men because what they are men you've got a prophet of Malachi 4. you've got a five-fold Ministry amen the Bible calls them angels and the Bible calls them Messengers and guess what it's dressed in a suit and looks like Jonathan Curley that's what we're stuck with amen amen but yet it is the voice of God amen right it's thundering out it's not just one prophet it's all of us under that inspiration but guess what we will not contradict that Prophet because that is the voice to the age and we'll read it right here right now Revelation 3 says and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right how many angels one there's only one Angel messenger there's only one Angel Messenger to laodicea he says these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so who's talking is this an angel just talking no it's Christ amen amen the message is going to be spoken by a man but that is just a voice it's God by the Holy Spirit speaking to the last Church age right so guess what you better know who that angel of laodicea is you better know because there's only one voice that'll take you to eternal life that I'll point you to the word for your hour and get you oriented correctly so that you know what to focus on and how to get there amen then we jump to verse 20 it says behold I personal pronoun who the faithful and true witness Jesus Christ behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice is it the voice of William Branham no sir sir no it's the voice of Christ through amen through a son of man a son of man right it is the voice of the Angel speaking to us and it says what if they will hear my voice and open the door why you've got to receive him that has been sent to you amen right if any man hear my voice and open the door then I personal pronoun the person of Christ will come into him and sup with him and he with me this is not a relationship with William Branham William Branham is not here this is a relationship and fellowship with Christ Alone amen we have no man between us and Christ The Voice opened the door and then Christ walks in if William Brennan walks in then we are idolaters right it's that simple yes sir amen I read that I just wish I could make it stand out to you the message does not tie us to a man amen the message gets you to open the door of your personal private life so that Christ himself can step in into your life your Private Affairs and you can have fellowship with him and him alone right to hear the voice of this age to catch the message of this age has one primary effect and that is that it will allow Christ to your life and there's only one person fellowshipping around that table there's only one influence there's only one voice there's only one channel that's coming at you amen and there's what no matter how many voices are outside yelling at that door you cannot hear them because you've got the voice sitting in front of you you're tuned into it and you can't hear anything else amen the scripture says there's only one voice my sheep hear my voice and another what they can't hear he says they hear my voice and I know them and they follow there's only one voice that we can hear amen there's only one way we are going to have that fellowship and that's if we open the door to Christ and then we shut the door after he's in amen amen amen amen once that door is closed once he's in why would we ever open it to anything else why would we ever allow another voice another influence another Doctrine another idea why would we open that up to another man another Ministry even why would we do that when we have Christ the the faithful one the great emancipator the amen the faithful and true witness the promise Giver the promise keeper sitting across the table from us why were we open to any other voice why were we open to an eighth messenger come on why were we open the new no we don't need it because the person of Christ is with us amen amen 21 says to him that overcometh that means there's going to be an overcomer I mean that means there's going to be an overcomer if there is a prize if there's a reward then that means somebody's gonna overcome amen I believe it's me I believe it's you this morning he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit say to the churches again who's talking to the church they hear the voice of the human messenger amen but who's speaking it's the Holy Spirit every single time and you've got to recognize what remember brother gel says this so many times he says they don't recognize the other angels he recognized he was an angel but he's pointing to what the angel of the Lord behind him that's doing all of this Abraham says I'm just a microphone amen what's he telling you Church what does this message do what's the effect of the message in the believer's life amen what it says that even though you're in a chicken yard you're an eagle amen even though you're in Fallen flesh you're a child of God that even though your family habits and traits and genetics are in your body yet you are a new creation in Christ what is it it's letting you know who and what you are amen amen and even though you've got Desires in your flesh that you don't want you've got a life inside of you that will subdue it and take you all the way over into a Rapture in a resurrection amen what's he doing he's telling you who you are and he's tying you back to him he's letting you know that this is not the start of something just this is something that started before you ever really knew about it amen he's tying it back to Eternity so that you'll recognize that it's going to go on forever and ever and what's he doing he takes his word and he says I wrote this about you this is for you this is to have an effect on you this isn't just about me but it's for you so that you can see what's yours to see what I've done see what I'm going to do to have faith that I'm going to take you all the way through these things amen what is it that's why we're not building arcs that's not we're not out there building armies to take natural lands we're not here to take Canada back we're not here to take the states back amen we're here to go what to a city whose Builder and maker is God Amen where pilgrims and strangers here amen amen what is it where Rapture bound and like John he's saying come up a little higher and dig a Little Deeper amen step out a little more have a little more faith confess and believe and move forward amen amen this book this is the word of God that we call a Bible is all about God's plan to redeem you and I back to him amen amen and what it's trying to get us in this time and in this Fallen flesh to express the word attributes that he gave us before there was ever a star before there was ever a light before there was ever a planet on this Earth but in his very mind amen brother Brown says this what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was he says and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are a manifestation of his thinking that gives me a lot of a lot of that makes me feel pretty good even in following condition that I am what a manifestation of his thinking before there was even a world you were in Christ and God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth that's what God is the whole thing he's not talking about Christ he's talking about you that God could be tangible could be handled and then the word is a thought expressed this is the mature bride's life that we're looking at amen God's just trying to get you and I to see one thing and that's that the word must be expressed and it's going to happen to you in you and it's going to happen in me amen amen it's not going to happen because we say it it's going to happen because he already said it he already thought it it's a finished work because his word cannot return to him void so we're not here to just start coming up with things by faith and I'm going to say this I'm going to say this and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that no it's to catch what he has already said what he has already ordained in the time that he has ordained it and then you catch it and you believe it and you confess it and you speak it and it happens exactly the way you said it amen it is not about going out with some magical power that I've got the authority of Heaven behind me no I've found my place in the word and based on that I'm speaking right and it's not pain avoidance and it's not just to be blessed but it's to do what God has already ordained in your life brother Brown says this and I quoted it before but I want to dig into it a little bit we're starting to close he says look Christ in you makes him the center of light oh sorry we'll skip it that's fine look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ we we all say Amen to that Christ in the Bible makes it the complete revelation of God he says Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole sick thing see what what God is trying to do it right the complete revelation of what he's trying to do today now this age this time in a gentile bride what is the new birth then it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you didn't join the message you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you he says that no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon remember he says it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then he says it's Christ in you okay so I could spend a year on that and we probably couldn't unpack that entire thing I meant but I want to just cover that that thought there he says it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he says this is the new birth so the first thing there's a revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you savior Master Lord healer provider deliver a comforter guide and all these things it's the nature and attributes of God being revealed to you right and the first thing is always what savior right he's your savior right and then he's your healer and he's all these different things but he's revealing what he is to you it's an external revelation of what he is to you personally okay so he's letting you know that what it's not just words on the page amen but it's there's a God that backs it up amen it's it's the actor and the nature boots of God Amen how how does he reveal it by the things we go through in life by the good things and the not so good things we see what all of the aspects of God you can't know he's a Healer unless you get sick man you can't know uh Deliverance unless you get bound and then you you can't know provision unless you get needy write down all these things you can't be you can't know a savior unless you're lost so all these things so it's the revealing of God himself to you but then there is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you which is the word revealed to you for the purpose of what your life expressing it because remember brother Brown says the revelation of Jesus Christ to you and then he says it's the Revel of the revelation of Jesus Christ in you amen so what is it that's the part of the Christian Walk Of God showing you himself amen the second part is showing you yourself first thing showing him the next thing showing you who you are and what it's Christ in you he says that's the Revelation that the church is built on so the outside thing the external revelation of Jesus Christ to you what is it it's the understanding and recognition and belief of all that he is by the word and then the second revelation of Jesus Christ you personally is what the understanding recognition and belief of who you are through Christ by the word you've got to receive an outside thing so you can become the inside thing amen so what's outside can come inside and you can start to express it amen brother Brian will put it this way he says now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age wow wow remember when the angel Drew this perfectly there was no light brother Brown says I had permission to put a little thing in there to represent the bride but why was it dark because the bride is not in laodicea Christ is outside and they're outside as well right so there's just a bunch of individual homes here where the light is inside right but there is no group there is no no body there the bride has stepped out of that later cnh she's in a bright age and she's not part of it because she came out of her my people that's right right so she's not in there anymore but he says now you're the light of the age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you're now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and to this people and this neighborhood where you associate hey man God help us to do it and God help the people to recognize it yeah I'm reminded when sister Maureen was in that grocery store and the man was seeking God and and he saw her and he said I saw an angel can they say that about all of us I'm not lifting sister Brenda up or sister Maureen up but I'm saying can they recognize the light of God right can they recognize that can they realize there's something different about you and it's above and beyond anything they've ever seen or heard or run into contact with him right wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you have to you had to be and if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation before there was a world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being he says now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you're citizens of the king not citizens only but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you now then if it was Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifested in flesh you were hearing him then because he was the word amen he says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him and you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says oh that means so much nowadays because now is the time for it church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ I mean let's stand together if we would the musicians could come let's be sure we're solidly here this afternoon amen that we're on a a firm foundation we're talking about speak the word but the first thing that he focuses on is what letting Christ in that relationship letting the word come in so that it can flow out in one place and that is through your life amen amen do we have that relationship do we have that relationship can we say I have a relationship with Jesus not just do I have a relationship because I believe the message or because I go to church or I pay my tithes or any of these things but do I have a REV do I have a a relationship with Jesus Christ personally can you say I've talked to him and then he talked to me because we're sitting at a fellowship table right it's not just a ladder going up and down we're not just sending emails to God but what are we doing he's sitting at a table and he's fellowshipping with us amen you want to make sure you're on Fellowship terms with Jesus amen how do you know when you're in a strong relationship when you can say anything not just when you talk about how good and great and and wonderful things are but when you can talk about what the failures the faults amen when you can repent and say you're sorry in a relationship and the other person can receive it without condemnation that's how you know you're in a strong relationship amen so often we say we're in a relationship because we're giving all the good things to God but what about the bad things amen is repentance found in our relationship yeah amen when I can go to my wife and say I messed up that's when I know that I've I've got to a place where I trust her enough to to allow myself to be vulnerable that way and where she can come back at me and say the same things to me and and share those faults and failures amen what was it that caused the first church to Fall Away he says they left their first love didn't say you never had it he says you left it what happened they let the thoughts of men they left the ideas and the leadership of men come in and so often that's our problem is we've gotten away from our first love amen we've lost the relationship and we've covered it up with message Doctrine that's not the relationship like I said last service Hattie Wright did not know all about the Seven Seals and spoken word and third pull but yet she reached God in a way that most of us probably never have amen amen what is it it's relationship it's a closeness with him so that what the life inside of you has come to life that the egg has been quickened amen that that life is Flowing out of you amen maybe we've just gotten away from time with him right man we've got to talk we've got to talk to him can't just read the word you got to pray you got to have a conversation with them amen he's at the table if you've let him into your life he's at the table can you imagine if I could set a table here in a visible Jesus Christ was right there how I wouldn't be able to hold you back would I be it there's a table set for you every single day if you've let him in he's just waiting he's just waiting at the table for you to sit down and talk to him amen and then come back to our first love right amen if that's what they lost and that was the alpha church then what does the Omega Church have to do its restoration must go completely back through that tight relationship with Jesus Christ amen what does that word restore what do we have a restoring message for is to restore us back to the relationship it's not just uh the doctrines are just the structure that's just to keep us from misplacing our feet yeah right it's to keep us on the right path but it's to restore us back to fellowship with God so that now he has an intimacy with us where he can trust us with his word completely amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your goodness to us for your presence and the service today Lord Lord from the start even to now Lord we are so appreciative of it Lord I believe I can say with certainty that there's a table set here and you're sitting there and you're saying sit down and fellowship have a conversation with me son and daughter let me know what you're going through Lord that we would open up our lives our fears our hurts our offenses Lord even the very things that cause us shame Lord are not only that but we'd sit down and we'd thank you for your goodness and your grace your provision your blessing your mercy Lord your love that follows us day in and day out for those mercies that are new Every Morning Lord God but Lord may we not just talk about the good Lord but may we open up take you to the rooms of our home Lord to open up those places and say I need a cleaning here Lord I want the word to shine a light in this area Lord I want to come up a little
