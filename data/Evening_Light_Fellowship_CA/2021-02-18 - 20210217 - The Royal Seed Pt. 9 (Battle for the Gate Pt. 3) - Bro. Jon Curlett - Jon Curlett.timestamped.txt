[26:52] gathered in Your Name Lord there you
[26:54] would be in the midst Lord we've got
[26:56] more than that here Lord we've got a few
[26:58] in each house and Lord we're asking for
[27:00] your presence to not just be here in
[27:02] this building Lord but we're praying
[27:04] that your Holy Spirit would just
[27:05] activate within each home Heavenly
[27:07] Father Lord that it would reach down
[27:09] into lives and hearts Lord from The
[27:11] Young to the old Lord that you would
[27:13] just minister to hearts and souls
[27:14] tonight heavenly father have your way as
[27:17] your word Goes Forth Lord Jesus may you
[27:19] just find a resting place in the hearts
[27:21] that need it Lord may we may we just be
[27:23] encouraged strengthened Lord for battle
[27:26] tonight we pray Lord just minister to
[27:28] each one now we ask Lord we need your
[27:31] grace every day in your name we ask and
[27:33] pray it amen amen thank you musicians
[27:36] that'll be
[27:37] it amen certainly want to greet each one
[27:39] that's gathered in their homes
[27:42] today certainly wish we were all here I
[27:45] told Brother Gerald this week I said I'm
[27:47] already sick of this
[27:49] so but you know it is what it is and
[27:51] we've got to make the best of it amen
[27:53] I'm glad that we can still gather here
[27:55] and and preach it's I'd certainly rather
[27:56] preach here than from behind a table in
[27:59] my home or something with nobody there
[28:00] or just my family staring at me so
[28:03] thankful to be here regardless and have
[28:04] a song service and worship and just feel
[28:07] the presence of the Lord amen we're
[28:08] going to continue uh this evening finish
[28:11] up the battle for the gate in the series
[28:13] on the Royal seed and if you'll turn in
[28:16] your scriptures to Galatians 2:20 2:20
[28:19] hopefully uh I spoke to brother Matt
[28:21] before the service so he's going to try
[28:23] and put up the scriptures and the quotes
[28:24] as I go through so that you have a
[28:26] chance to read uh along as I'm as I'm
[28:28] saying things since I tend to move
[28:30] pretty quickly amen God bless you
[28:32] Galatians 2:20 we read this last service
[28:35] says I am crucified with Christ
[28:37] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[28:41] liveth in me and the life which I now
[28:43] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[28:46] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[28:49] himself for me amen everything that we
[28:51] do everything that the Christian does
[28:53] that's according to the word of God that
[28:54] meets the standard of the word of God is
[28:56] done by faith and what Christ has done
[28:58] for us and what he is doing through US
[29:01] day by day amen one more scripture if we
[29:03] can and I'll just put it up on the
[29:05] screen here it's First Corinthians 5:7
[29:07] says for we walk by faith not by sight
[29:11] amen you can have your seats amen Grace
[29:13] to each one tonight as we Minister we're
[29:16] going to continue like I said with the
[29:17] Royal seed and uh the battle for the
[29:19] gate part three and last time we talked
[29:22] so much about how the mind is the
[29:23] battlefield and how Satan has claimed
[29:25] the mind and God claimed the soul and
[29:27] once you're locked in in the soul then
[29:29] the battle's over for that but now the
[29:30] battle switches to the Mind amen we
[29:33] spent a lot of time the last time
[29:34] talking about how the the human being is
[29:36] built and it's got the three levels the
[29:38] body the spirit and the soul and then we
[29:40] put the mind in between the soul and the
[29:42] spirit and said the mind is what was
[29:44] guarding the access to the soul because
[29:46] the mind is what makes the choice and
[29:47] you've got to make a free will choice
[29:49] and when you make the Free Will Choice
[29:51] then the Soul is sealed with the Holy
[29:53] Spirit and now that can no longer be
[29:54] changed it can no longer be moved it can
[29:56] no longer be taken in and out of of
[29:58] eternal life but it's sealed until the
[30:00] day of our Redemption amen and once that
[30:02] soul is sealed now then we start to
[30:04] change and and we have all these
[30:06] different Gates here and that and what
[30:07] became self-will at the beginning now
[30:10] switches to a sealed soul and from out
[30:12] of there pushes the will of God and the
[30:14] word of God and faith and doubt now are
[30:16] moved aside and it's only faith that
[30:17] resides in there then starts to work its
[30:19] way back up through those channels and
[30:21] starts to bring them subject to the word
[30:23] of God Amen but when we seal are sealed
[30:26] in the soul then we give up our rights
[30:27] we give up our our our position in this
[30:30] world we give up the things that we
[30:31] would desire of ourselves and it becomes
[30:33] solely and completely in the control of
[30:35] Christ amen the Holy Spirit working in
[30:37] us to do of his will not of our own will
[30:40] amen and we talked about last time about
[30:42] the free moral agency I'm just going to
[30:44] do a a quick recap here so that we're
[30:46] we're up to speed before we move on what
[30:48] we remember how Satan and God are both
[30:50] battling for Authority in our body and
[30:52] when the soul is sealed then that's
[30:53] great but we know the battle as it
[30:55] shifts now to the Mind becomes all the
[30:57] more sharper because this mind is now
[30:59] subject to so many things it's subject
[31:01] to imagination it's subject to
[31:02] conscience and memory and reason and
[31:04] affection and these things it's subject
[31:06] to what it can see what it can smell
[31:07] feel hear and all these different things
[31:09] so the mind is being fed by subconscious
[31:11] things and by conscious things and Satan
[31:13] can maneuver those and push them all
[31:15] over the place and bring these things
[31:16] into your your your remembrance and into
[31:18] your mind and so he's fighting there to
[31:20] keep Faith suppressed he's fighting
[31:22] there to push the word back amen but
[31:25] once that soul is sealed amen once that
[31:27] that soul is sealed then we've got a
[31:29] finish work done inside of us brother
[31:31] brandham says and I'm going to again
[31:32] these are just a couple things I read
[31:34] before but he said see it's the inside
[31:36] no matter how good you are how moral you
[31:38] are how truthful you are these things
[31:40] are respected but Jesus said except a
[31:42] man be born again see there's got to be
[31:45] something happen inside now watch what
[31:47] he says here he says if you don't that's
[31:50] an artificial put on for down in your
[31:52] heart you desire to put to do it anyway
[31:55] he says it can't be artificial it's got
[31:57] to be real
[31:58] that's a great danger especially with
[32:00] somebody that's raised in a church
[32:01] family that's raised with a Christian
[32:03] family or professing Christian family is
[32:05] they start to act like Christ rather
[32:07] than have Christ within them brother
[32:09] Bram says you can't do that you've got
[32:10] to move this into the inside then he
[32:13] says there's only one Avenue that that
[32:15] that can come down and that's by the way
[32:17] of free moral agency to come into the
[32:19] Soul by your thoughts as a man think it
[32:22] in his heart so is he and if you say to
[32:24] this mountain move and don't doubt in
[32:25] your heart but believe that what you
[32:26] have said will come to pass
[32:28] you can have what you said he says you
[32:30] get it there you are see there's the
[32:32] Battleground if you only get that
[32:33] started first he says don't start to try
[32:35] to move mountains until you've sealed
[32:37] that Soul off first until you've settled
[32:38] the the the Eternal life's question
[32:41] forever don't go around trying to do the
[32:42] other thing why because we know that in
[32:44] the last days they're going to come to
[32:46] him and when the Judgment comes and
[32:47] they'll say Lord Lord we did this in
[32:49] your name and that in your name and we
[32:50] did great Miracles and we healed the
[32:52] sick and we cast out demons and all
[32:54] these things and he says get away from
[32:55] me you workers of iniquity because I
[32:57] never never knew you there was no
[32:58] intimate relationship there was no
[33:00] one-on-one time but rather you were
[33:02] going around doing things that built up
[33:04] your kingdom even though it was through
[33:06] my power but you didn't do it according
[33:07] to the will and purpose of God why
[33:09] because your soul was never sealed by
[33:11] the Holy Spirit you took a gift you took
[33:13] a promise in the word you took a
[33:14] principle in the word and you said
[33:16] that's for me and I can use that you
[33:17] built a man a a kingdom for men amen so
[33:21] the starting part for the victory in the
[33:22] battle of the mind is victory in the
[33:24] soul amen you've got to settle that same
[33:26] question forever you've got take him in
[33:28] and let him set up a a headquarters
[33:32] right a a place of authority within you
[33:34] and then from there he's got something
[33:35] to work with to bring now the other 10
[33:37] Senses Into uh subjection amen but we're
[33:41] looking at what we're looking at that
[33:43] new birth and sometimes that puts
[33:44] pressure on us or sometimes we start
[33:46] putting pressure on other people because
[33:48] we know that they can be in there and we
[33:50] look at our kids and they're acting
[33:51] right and we know they're doing the
[33:53] right things and they're in obedience to
[33:54] their parents but we know that they
[33:56] maybe haven't come to a new birth yet
[33:58] and we start to put this pressure on
[33:59] ourselves or we start to put pressure on
[34:01] them to become a child of God Amen but
[34:04] you can't pressure somebody into
[34:06] becoming a child of God it's got to be
[34:08] something else that happens and brother
[34:09] brandham talks about this and this is
[34:11] all within the greatest battle ever
[34:13] fought mind you okay this is not from
[34:14] some other sermon this is him preaching
[34:16] from greatest battle ever fought he
[34:18] throws Us in for a reason because what
[34:20] he doesn't want is stillborn children
[34:22] amen he doesn't want false births amen
[34:25] he says we're so anxious to see things
[34:28] done we're so anxious to do something
[34:30] for God he says this little lady no
[34:32] doubt is anxious to live he's talking to
[34:34] a lady there that's that's there for
[34:35] healing she wants to be well others are
[34:37] here that wants to be well and when we
[34:39] hear about that case like the doctor the
[34:41] resurrection of the Dead the Great
[34:42] Mighty things that are God has done then
[34:44] we're anxious and the thing of it is we
[34:46] try to reach through these senses to
[34:48] grab a hold of something here like
[34:50] conscience so many people lots of times
[34:52] has misconstrued the word and I've been
[34:54] misunderstood by this by making altar
[34:56] calls I say I wasn't n much on an altar
[34:58] call not meaning that you shouldn't make
[35:00] an altar call brother Brandon wasn't big
[35:02] on having people come up to the altar
[35:04] because there's a danger there and he
[35:06] gets into it he says but somebody gets
[35:08] Somebody by the arm and say oh brother
[35:09] John you know what me and you have been
[35:11] neighbors all this time come up here at
[35:13] the altar get down what's he doing he
[35:15] says I wish I had a Blackboard here I
[35:17] could show you what he's doing he's
[35:19] trying to work through his soul on
[35:21] affections he's saying you and I we have
[35:23] a relationship we have a connection we
[35:25] have an understanding here let me bring
[35:27] bring you up to the Altar and he says
[35:29] that don't work he says that's not the
[35:32] Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's
[35:34] working on what a memory through the
[35:36] sense of his soul Oh Brother John you
[35:38] had a wonderful mother she died a long
[35:40] time ago a memory see you can't do that
[35:42] maybe the mother was a Christian oh your
[35:44] mother would really love it if you if
[35:46] she knew that you were coming to Christ
[35:47] today let's go do it he's saying you
[35:49] can't do that that's a pressure you're
[35:51] putting on them but it's not the right
[35:52] kind of pressure he says it's got to
[35:54] come down the line of free moral agency
[35:56] you your yourself let the word of God
[35:59] you don't come because your mother was a
[36:01] good woman you don't come because you're
[36:03] a good neighbor you come because that
[36:06] God calls you to come and you accept him
[36:09] on the basis of his word that word is
[36:13] what means everything that word if you
[36:15] can get everything out of the way all
[36:17] conscience all senses and just let the
[36:20] word come in that word will produce just
[36:23] exactly amen you can't come through by
[36:25] somebody else you've got to come to
[36:27] Christ through Christ which is the word
[36:29] amen and any other way is going to lead
[36:31] to downfall later on you'll stand for a
[36:33] while and then the true colors will
[36:34] shine through and all of a sudden
[36:35] there'll be a falling away amen you
[36:37] didn't truly come to Christ
[36:39] amen like I said we can we can play on
[36:42] our children's emotions and we can talk
[36:44] about how proud we'd be if they came to
[36:45] the Lord in these different things and
[36:46] we have to be very careful with that
[36:48] because we'll end up calling them to
[36:50] Christ when Christ himself hasn't
[36:51] perhaps made that move in their soul
[36:53] what do we do we encourage them by what
[36:56] speaking the word living the word
[36:58] bringing the word to their remembrance
[37:00] being an example to them so that they
[37:02] know what God looks like with skin on it
[37:03] but God himself still has to call them
[37:05] and speak to them amen otherwise we're
[37:08] going to get stillborn children now just
[37:10] cuz somebody came to the Lord a long
[37:11] time ago and then went out that doesn't
[37:12] mean they didn't have a new birth that
[37:14] just means they're backslid potentially
[37:16] amen we don't want to put that pressure
[37:17] on ourselves and say oh well maybe I put
[37:19] pressure on them and that's why they
[37:21] came to the Lord and then they're not
[37:22] serving today no no no that's between
[37:23] them and God Amen we live the word we
[37:25] bring the word up we raise them in the
[37:27] ab of the Lord and then it's up to the
[37:29] Lord to call him amen amen amen but like
[37:32] we said before once you've accepted
[37:34] Christ once he's in the Soul by the Holy
[37:36] Spirit then we're sealed to the day of
[37:38] our Redemption and now the battle shifts
[37:40] purely to the mind and the mind is what
[37:42] we're going to focus on of course
[37:43] tonight because that's what we've been
[37:45] talking on and that's where the battle
[37:46] is brother brandham says and once the
[37:49] Holy Spirit comes in we're we should see
[37:51] results right if somebody's got the Holy
[37:53] Spirit and their life is exactly the way
[37:55] it was before they got baptized and
[37:57] received the Holy Ghost something's
[37:58] wrong amen something hasn't happened
[38:00] there according to the word because
[38:01] every time you look in the word it had
[38:03] an effect on those people amen they came
[38:05] into a group and they started acting the
[38:07] same way not exactly the same way as the
[38:09] one next to them but they had common
[38:10] traits amen the world started slipping
[38:12] further and further away the influence
[38:14] of the Believers What mattered more amen
[38:16] they came under the hearing and the
[38:17] preaching of the word they submitted
[38:19] themselves to the authority of the word
[38:20] and then their lives started to change
[38:22] amen so there's always going to be an
[38:25] effect in Romans 12 this is Paul
[38:27] speaking says I beseech you therefore
[38:29] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[38:31] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[38:34] holy acceptable under God which is your
[38:36] reasonable service am me he's talking
[38:38] about sanctification there he's saying
[38:39] set aside the things that are going to
[38:41] cause dirt and filth on your body this
[38:43] the stains of sin and these things he
[38:45] says set your body aside don't use it
[38:47] for evil things whether it's the sensual
[38:48] side or whether it's for financial gain
[38:50] and you put the focus on those things
[38:52] whether you're eating the wrong sorts of
[38:54] food if you don't exercise all of this
[38:55] fits into this it's all a part of
[38:57] sanctification it's making yourself fit
[38:58] for purpose and that can be through
[39:00] Health right that it's okay to talk
[39:03] about health behind a Pulpit because if
[39:05] you're sick all the time and you have
[39:06] poor sleeping habits and poor eating
[39:08] habits and these things guess what
[39:09] you're going to be useless for God
[39:10] because you're going to be sick all the
[39:12] time so you got to take care of your
[39:13] body but there's other things that come
[39:15] with it again how do you fill your time
[39:17] what are your eyes looking at on a
[39:18] regular basis what are you reading what
[39:19] are you listening to who are you hanging
[39:21] out with in these things it's all a part
[39:22] of presenting your body a Living
[39:24] Sacrifice but verse two watch where Paul
[39:27] goes now he says now when the body is
[39:28] taken care of he says and be not
[39:30] conformed to this world but be ye
[39:32] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[39:36] that ye may prove what is that good and
[39:39] acceptable and perfect will of God Amen
[39:42] so it's not just present your body
[39:44] Living Sacrifice but he says now there
[39:46] has to be a renewing of your mind it has
[39:47] to be transformed your whole being's
[39:50] going to be transformed by what the
[39:51] renewing of your mind now he doesn't say
[39:53] newing he says renewing it's bringing
[39:55] you back to something that you were you
[39:57] were in before it's bringing you back to
[39:59] the mind of Christ bringing you back
[40:01] into the mind of Christ we could even
[40:02] say that you have before the foundation
[40:04] of the world he says we got to bring
[40:05] that now back now that everything else
[40:07] is taken care of let's bring that out
[40:09] and let's start working on the rest of
[40:11] your system here Amen brother Paul had
[40:12] mentioned this in this closing prayer
[40:14] last time and I thought it was was very
[40:15] fitting as as a way to kind of Kick this
[40:18] off this evening amen so after the
[40:20] Soul's been sealed what's next is the
[40:22] transforming of everything else by the
[40:24] renewing of your mind cuz remember when
[40:26] we drew the picture
[40:29] here we have the soul but we have the
[40:30] Mind marked in here I can draw it real
[40:36] quick and then we have the mind in here
[40:39] and that's controlling what's going in
[40:41] and out right the soul sealed so nothing
[40:44] else can come in but it's now
[40:45] controlling what moves out and brother
[40:47] Bron will'll talk about that a a little
[40:48] bit later but now we've got to transform
[40:51] this because this is the gateway to this
[40:53] and the gateway to this and then this
[40:55] has been sealed this has been changed
[40:57] this has been locked in this is all
[40:59] Christ and the soul but now the mind is
[41:01] the Gateway here and he says You' got to
[41:02] do something with that mind you've got
[41:03] to there's got to be a renewing of that
[41:05] mind so that you can come into the
[41:07] fullness of Christ Amen brother Braham
[41:10] says this in the power of transformation
[41:12] he says now that now that we have been
[41:14] saved so saved means what doesn't mean
[41:17] that you've gone down to the Altar and
[41:18] and cried and then got baptized saved is
[41:20] when you get the Holy Ghost right we're
[41:22] talking to Believers now salvation is
[41:24] when you get the Holy Ghost he says now
[41:26] so if we could say now that we've been
[41:28] saved as we are and that we have been
[41:30] filled with the Holy Ghost as we have so
[41:32] he's covered it all here whichever way
[41:34] you want to look at it he says now we
[41:36] want the mind that was in Christ to be
[41:38] in us that we might be transformed from
[41:41] what that we might be transformed from
[41:43] the Natural Things of life and be
[41:46] brought in to do the perfect will of God
[41:48] by transformation of God's spirit by his
[41:50] word what did Paul say that ye may be
[41:53] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[41:55] that you may prove what is that good and
[41:56] accept cable and perfect will of God
[41:58] brother BR saying the exact same thing
[42:00] here so he says you have to be what
[42:02] transformed from the Natural Things of
[42:04] life so what is it that drives the
[42:06] Natural Things of life in our in our in
[42:08] our lives it's the senses right it's the
[42:10] 10 inner senses and the 10 outer senses
[42:12] that's how the whole natural world is
[42:13] living today they're living by those 10
[42:15] senses and that's what drives everything
[42:17] nobody's moving by Supernatural power
[42:19] the way we are is in they're consciously
[42:21] feeding on the supernatural they're
[42:22] looking to the supernatural they're
[42:24] expecting the supernatural they're
[42:26] expecting to manifest the Supernatural
[42:27] they're not doing that they're just
[42:28] going by what I put in is what I get out
[42:30] what I put in is what I get out what
[42:32] I've done what I've learned the school
[42:33] I've been to the job experience I have
[42:35] the marital relationships I have d d d
[42:37] and they're putting that all together
[42:38] and they're coming up with a natural way
[42:40] of life and occasionally they'll learn
[42:42] from somebody else's mistake and do a
[42:43] better thing but usually they won't
[42:45] they'll just follow their own way of
[42:46] going right but their mind has shifted
[42:49] from some semblance of good manners and
[42:50] general citizenship to one of
[42:52] selfishness today that's where we're at
[42:54] now is total selfishness right
[42:56] everybody's looking out for themselves
[42:57] and nobody's looking on the things of
[42:59] the other when we go back to the
[43:02] beginning this is before the flood in
[43:04] Genesis and God saw that the wickedness
[43:06] of man was great in the earth and that
[43:08] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[43:10] heart was only evil continually every
[43:13] imagination of the thoughts of his
[43:15] Hearts was only evil continually amen
[43:18] all the time all they could think about
[43:20] was evil that's before the first
[43:22] judgment okay we're coming right up to
[43:25] the borders of the second judgment now
[43:26] and watch watch what Paul says in
[43:28] Timothy he says this know also that in
[43:32] the last days perilous times shall come
[43:36] the last days are today amen so if he
[43:38] says in the last days perilous times
[43:40] will come that means perilous times are
[43:42] when now right the perilous times are
[43:44] here but what kind watch what kind of
[43:47] peril comes because too many people
[43:49] think that the Peril is in the type of
[43:50] people that's going to be described here
[43:53] but it's
[43:54] not right we look at the bad traits here
[43:56] and we say that's the Peril that's here
[43:57] but I want you to see something because
[43:59] this is only a symptom verse two says
[44:01] for men shall be lovers of their own
[44:03] selves Covetous boasters proud
[44:06] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[44:08] unthankful Unholy without natural
[44:11] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[44:13] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[44:16] that are good traitors heady high-m
[44:19] minded lovers of Pleasures more than
[44:20] lovers of God now that sounds like some
[44:22] pretty bad people but let we get to
[44:25] verse 5 and it says having a form of
[44:27] godliness but denying the power thereof
[44:30] from such turn away now remember we're
[44:32] talking about perilous times but he's
[44:33] talking about perilous people but he
[44:35] says perilous times not perilous people
[44:38] so I want you to pay close attention to
[44:40] verse 5 here because if you're listening
[44:41] to the service that we listen to
[44:43] recently what did it brother BR say
[44:45] about the people that were described in
[44:47] those verses because we look there and
[44:49] we if we look through verses 2 through 4
[44:51] we'd say that's the
[44:53] world but then we read verse 5 and we
[44:55] realize that can't be the world because
[44:57] it says having a form of godliness the
[44:59] world has no form of godliness God
[45:01] hasn't even entered in the equation he's
[45:03] not in their mind he's not in their
[45:04] thoughts he's not in their actions they
[45:06] have no comprehension of God but there's
[45:08] a people that has a comprehension of God
[45:10] but they're still fitting the
[45:11] descriptions of 2 through four so who is
[45:14] it on Wednesday night the tape that
[45:16] brother Gerald played it talked about
[45:18] this and what did it say it said that
[45:21] these are religious people right what is
[45:25] it they are people that have a form of
[45:28] godliness they have enough of God to go
[45:29] to church and listen but when they leave
[45:32] there they have no power to live the
[45:34] life that they're hearing about or maybe
[45:36] not hearing about these days with the
[45:38] way the churches are going amen but they
[45:39] have enough godliness to go to church
[45:41] and that's about it they can't live the
[45:43] life and so they have all of these other
[45:45] things lovers of their own selves
[45:46] Covetous boasters without natural
[45:49] affection truth Breakers traitors heady
[45:51] high-minded this is Christians
[45:54] professing Christians that they're
[45:55] talking about here he says this is the
[45:57] Peril that's here and what is it it's a
[45:59] religious spirit that is focused on
[46:01] selfishness and good living amen it's
[46:03] the leoan church here this is the leosan
[46:05] church that Paul's describing right here
[46:07] right what is it and he says you're what
[46:11] you're poor miserable blind wretched
[46:13] naked and you don't even know it right
[46:15] because why they think they're in a for
[46:17] they think they have God they think
[46:18] they're they're truly Christians and
[46:19] they're not because they have no power
[46:21] in their lives Amen brother Braham says
[46:24] this in looking to the Unseen now he's
[46:25] praying here he says and I know there's
[46:28] so much unbelief in the world you said
[46:30] in the last days they'd rise there'd
[46:32] rise scoffers behead high-minded lovers
[46:34] of pleasure more than lovers of God
[46:36] truth Breakers false accusers
[46:38] incontinent despisers of those that are
[46:40] good even hated and they would be a
[46:42] religious group having a form of
[46:45] godliness but would deny the power
[46:47] thereof from such turn away said that
[46:49] the spirit spoke that expressing that in
[46:52] the last days these signs would be so
[46:54] how did they get there there religious
[46:57] group but how did they get there they
[46:59] turn down the word of God you go all the
[47:02] way back to the first church Age and
[47:03] what happened was they kicked the Holy
[47:04] Spirit out and they took on what the
[47:07] leadership and thoughts of men and every
[47:09] time what does that lead to it leads to
[47:11] separation from God which is death amen
[47:13] and that's how they got there is that
[47:15] they turned down the truth they turned
[47:16] down the very life of God and they paid
[47:18] a price and this is it this is where
[47:20] they've gotten is second
[47:22] Timothy brother Brown's pointing to
[47:24] First Timothy he says now the spirit
[47:26] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[47:28] times some shall depart from the faith
[47:31] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[47:33] doctrines of devils seducing Spirits is
[47:35] what ones that tell you what the flesh
[47:38] wants rather than what the word or the
[47:39] spirit would want in your life amen a
[47:41] seducing spirit is one that appeals to
[47:43] the flesh rather than to the word so he
[47:45] says you've given into you've given heed
[47:48] to seducing Spirits listening to things
[47:50] that give you what you want as opposed
[47:52] to what the word has for you and
[47:54] doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[47:57] hypocrisy you know what does that mean
[47:58] says you're saying one thing and you're
[48:00] doing another right saying one thing and
[48:02] doing another having their conscience
[48:04] seared with a hot iron what is it they
[48:07] get to the point where they've so
[48:09] allowed the devil to wrap up their mind
[48:11] with great ideas and campaigns and how
[48:13] to monetize this and how to take
[48:15] advantage of that and how we can build
[48:16] this great Kingdom for God and in the
[48:19] end what does it lead to it leads to
[48:21] wealth and then from there what happens
[48:23] is God is just he's completely moved out
[48:26] right it's popularity in
[48:28] women it was a shame this
[48:31] week Ravi Zacharias I don't know if you
[48:33] know him right wonderful man great
[48:37] apologist for for for the word he he had
[48:39] a great mind for answering people in the
[48:41] way that they think and it came out this
[48:43] week that he'd had a bunch of
[48:44] relationships with women in the
[48:46] background and abusive relationships and
[48:48] and taking advantage of people and
[48:49] things like that why because they don't
[48:52] have God that's the unfortunate truth is
[48:55] that they have a form and they've St
[48:57] well and I say God blessed the man for
[48:58] what he did that was good but yet there
[49:00] was a failing there why because he
[49:03] wasn't sealed in he didn't have the full
[49:05] truth someplace he turned it down and so
[49:07] what happened was God couldn't guard
[49:09] those things out what is it Satan could
[49:11] come in through those channels because
[49:12] he wasn't locked down and all of a
[49:14] sudden he's using the word to now put
[49:15] these people into a a state of
[49:17] depression and telling them you can't do
[49:19] this because it'll undo all the good
[49:20] work I've done and all these things and
[49:21] now he's using the word and his ministry
[49:23] as something to hold people back as
[49:25] opposed to free their lives amen it's
[49:27] horrible horrible why because they've
[49:30] gone the way of Cain amen they've gone
[49:32] the way of K and these ones that they
[49:33] said doesn't God speak to us doesn't God
[49:35] do these things and isn't my sacrifice
[49:37] as good or better or be more beautiful
[49:39] and they just end up in death every
[49:41] single time and disappointment and now
[49:43] you have this coming out and it destroys
[49:45] most of his ministry people say he
[49:46] helped me so much and then they find the
[49:47] man falls and they don't know what to do
[49:49] with it right it's a shame amen God help
[49:53] us what is it they get to the place
[49:56] where they're conscious is sear with the
[49:57] hot iron the spirit of God and the word
[49:59] of God can have no effect and if you
[50:01] know anything about animals what do they
[50:03] do to mark them they brand them right
[50:06] they put a brand in the hot coals of a
[50:08] fire until it's glowing hot then they
[50:10] come down and they sear that hide and
[50:12] they put a permanent mark on that animal
[50:14] and it doesn't hurt for long why because
[50:16] they sear all the nerves there and they
[50:17] actually can't feel anything it only
[50:19] hurts for a split second and then
[50:20] there's no pain because they burned it
[50:22] or when somebody's wounded and there's
[50:24] blood coming out in these things and
[50:25] what was the emergency procedure for
[50:27] that they cauterize a wound right they
[50:29] take something that was very hot and
[50:30] they just and it closes the ends of all
[50:33] the blood vessels and it keeps the and
[50:35] it just stops the bleeding from
[50:36] happening but what happens is from now
[50:38] on in that place they can't have any
[50:39] more they can't feel anything there's no
[50:41] nerves there anymore it's permanently
[50:43] damaged but it stopped the bleeding and
[50:45] it saves their lives amen he's saying
[50:47] the same thing with their mind he says
[50:48] your conscience has been seared with a
[50:49] hot iron it's been applied to it and now
[50:52] it doesn't actually work anymore it's
[50:54] there but it has no effect on you amen
[50:56] it's been seared it's it's all the
[50:57] nerves all the conscience all the
[50:59] ability of the conscience to work has
[51:01] been
[51:02] destroyed amen but why why doesn't that
[51:04] work for us why aren't we covered by
[51:06] this why aren't we why aren't we the
[51:08] ones that are are speaking lies and
[51:10] hypocrisy why it's because we've
[51:12] accepted the truth it's because we've
[51:14] opened up to the truth because when we
[51:16] opened up to do what he told us to do
[51:18] and he comes into our lives then now
[51:20] that seals it forever amen and though
[51:22] the devil can play with our minds he can
[51:24] play with our emotions and he can play
[51:25] with our bodies in these different
[51:26] things he can't get into the route amen
[51:29] he can't get into the basement there he
[51:30] can't get into the place of of security
[51:32] the place where the the control is and
[51:35] so we can never get to this place he can
[51:37] literally take our our sanity and we
[51:39] would still go to heaven because our
[51:40] souls are sealed amen he can drive you
[51:42] to a place and how many times did
[51:43] Brother Bram deal with people that were
[51:45] almost gone insane from nervousness
[51:48] right women going through the change of
[51:50] life in these different things and it
[51:51] just got into their mind and they get so
[51:53] frustrated and so worked up about do I
[51:55] have the Holy Ghost different things he
[51:57] said and they'd almost go crazy Satan's
[52:00] still working there and H almost all the
[52:01] time brother Brian would say yes sister
[52:03] yes brother you have the Holy Ghost you
[52:05] have the Holy Ghost and they would just
[52:07] settle them down and all of a sudden
[52:08] that thing would go away but God the
[52:10] Satan could never get in all the way he
[52:12] could never turn them they'd still stay
[52:13] and they'd still keep coming even though
[52:14] it was driving them crazy do I have this
[52:16] do I not have this but Satan couldn't
[52:18] get in there and take them all the way
[52:19] down amen why because it was sealed and
[52:21] he can't have dominion there right
[52:23] there's only one has dominion and when
[52:24] the Holy Spirit comes in nothing else
[52:26] ever gets get in there anymore
[52:28] amen we talked about this last time what
[52:31] happens 2 Corinthians 10:5 says casting
[52:35] down imaginations this is what the
[52:36] believer does right our conscience isn't
[52:39] affected this way we don't have access
[52:41] Satan doesn't have access to us why
[52:42] because we're we're obeying the
[52:44] scripture that says casting down
[52:45] imaginations and every High thing that
[52:48] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[52:50] God and bringing into captivity every
[52:52] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[52:55] brother Bram talked about thoughts he
[52:56] said you don't originate all your
[52:57] thoughts he says you've got you've got
[52:59] the word you've got God on one side and
[53:01] you've got Satan and they're like birds
[53:03] flying overhead and they're dropping
[53:04] things in he says and the only thing he
[53:06] says you can't stop the birds from
[53:07] flying overhead but you can stop them
[53:09] from building a nest right so Satan's
[53:11] going to be constantly dropping thoughts
[53:13] and ideas and feelings and memories into
[53:15] your life all the time and God's trying
[53:17] to bring up Faith in the word and
[53:18] Satan's trying to bring up doubt right
[53:21] and bad feelings and bad thoughts and
[53:22] all these different things he says' and
[53:24] you get to choose which one stays but
[53:26] they're going to keep dropping no matter
[53:27] what getting the Holy Ghost doesn't mean
[53:29] that your thoughts are always going to
[53:30] be good that's what Paul says here he
[53:31] says bring into captivity every thought
[53:34] he's not blaming you for the thoughts
[53:36] but he's saying it's up to you to bring
[53:37] into captivity the ones that don't align
[53:39] with the word amen and what does he say
[53:41] he says casting down imaginations amen
[53:43] bringing them from a place of regard a
[53:45] place of consideration a place of
[53:47] acceptance and putting them under your
[53:48] feet so he's saying cast them down take
[53:51] them from a high place and put them down
[53:53] into a low place for me it kind of
[53:54] reminds me of a tower you know when the
[53:56] old in the medieval days they'd always
[53:57] build a big strong tower and they'd have
[54:00] only one way in there and it would be
[54:01] completely fortified up and you couldn't
[54:03] do anything to get in then they'd stand
[54:05] up at the top and nobody could get in
[54:07] but if they could get a battering ram up
[54:09] there somehow and theyd knock down one
[54:10] corner of the walls there then that
[54:12] whole thing would come tumbling down
[54:14] right they cast down that entire Tower
[54:16] by knocking it out from the base if they
[54:17] could get at
[54:19] it amen he's talking about what bringing
[54:21] your mind into a higher plane brother
[54:24] Brandon puts a really a really neat way
[54:26] talking about he says what does it mean
[54:27] to to cast down imaginations he says now
[54:30] somebody will say just a minute brother
[54:32] isn't it reasonable that we he says this
[54:35] is beyond reasoning what we're talking
[54:37] about here he says it's an outer space
[54:39] outer space of reasoning we're supposed
[54:41] to cast them down he says so when you go
[54:44] above them they are cast down now he
[54:47] doesn't say pull them down he says go
[54:49] above them he says that's when they're
[54:51] cast down is when you go above what
[54:53] they're talking about when you're going
[54:55] above the experience above the thought
[54:57] above the memory he says when you go
[54:58] above that that's when they're cast down
[55:01] he says that's how you put them under
[55:02] your feet he says you don't pull them
[55:03] down you go over them you go above them
[55:06] you take them to a higher place he says
[55:08] cuz they're under you outer space the
[55:10] astronaut raised up above all human
[55:12] imaginations he says you're in the
[55:14] Glorious presence of Christ and Christ
[55:17] is in you what's he saying go up above
[55:19] them get into the presence of Christ get
[55:21] into the place of the word get into the
[55:23] promises of God and every single one of
[55:25] things those things will go below you
[55:26] amen what's brother Gerald said so many
[55:28] times we are now in Heavenly places he
[55:30] said what is that that's the full
[55:32] revealing of the word that's where we
[55:34] want to be is where that word is taking
[55:35] the preeminence and it's bringing us
[55:37] above all of this sinful flesh and the
[55:40] problems that we have in our lives and
[55:41] bringing us to the place of promise and
[55:43] Faith
[55:45] Amen brother bam starts talking now back
[55:47] in the greatest battle ever fought he's
[55:49] talking about what it means to cast
[55:50] these things down in the battle in the
[55:53] mind he says now remember it's not
[55:54] Christian Science Now Mind Over Matter
[55:57] he's not saying think good thoughts and
[55:59] then that's how you're going to overcome
[56:01] because that's what we tend to think
[56:02] sometimes as we say well just keep your
[56:04] mind positive and that's a good thing
[56:07] better to be positive than negative but
[56:08] he says you can't start with the mind
[56:11] you got to start with the soul and then
[56:13] something else happens he says the mind
[56:15] accepts the life which is the word of
[56:18] God and there brings the life he says
[56:20] just your thought doesn't do it so if
[56:21] you're dwelling here in the mind he says
[56:23] that's never going to do it he says you
[56:26] got to start in the soul he says and
[56:28] then the Soul brings it to the mind and
[56:30] the mind says yes or no to it he says it
[56:33] accepts it and then when the mind
[56:35] accepts it he says it's brought in the
[56:37] channel of your thought see it's not the
[56:39] thought as Christian Science make it
[56:40] Mind Over Matter that's not it why
[56:43] because life doesn't originate in the
[56:44] mind life originates in the soul so he
[56:46] says if you're trying to bring life to
[56:48] any of these situations to any of these
[56:50] areas it's got to start here it can't
[56:52] start in the mind can never be in the
[56:54] mind he says he can continues he says
[56:56] but your mind accepts it it grasps it
[57:00] what is your mind controlled by your
[57:02] soul and your soul catches the word of
[57:04] God and that's the thing that's got life
[57:06] in it it brings life into you he's
[57:08] talking about life into you there and
[57:10] then it brings life into the rest of you
[57:13] he says oh brother when that takes place
[57:15] when life comes down that channel from
[57:17] the soul to the mind and into the rest
[57:19] of the body then into you then the word
[57:23] of God is manifested in you very
[57:26] simple but what's the problem you got
[57:29] this stinking mind here where Satan has
[57:31] free reign right and he's running around
[57:33] there trying to stop the flow from of
[57:35] life from there to there to there right
[57:38] he says if you abide in me and my words
[57:40] abide in you then you ask what you will
[57:42] and it'll be done for you now watch the
[57:44] progression here we read read this last
[57:46] time I believe but I want to you want
[57:47] this to catch he says then what does
[57:49] that do from the middle of the heart
[57:51] which is the soul from There Goes Forth
[57:53] feeding every channel he says the
[57:56] trouble is we're standing in here in the
[57:59] mind says we're standing in here with a
[58:02] lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out
[58:04] here the preacher preaching right the
[58:07] word going forth he says we're standing
[58:09] in the mind trying to accept the word
[58:11] out here okay he says you got to stop
[58:14] that he says and come down that Channel
[58:17] with the true word of God and then it
[58:19] goes out itself automatically it's
[58:22] what's on the inside that's the thing
[58:23] that counts as the inside he says you
[58:25] can't stand here here and accept the
[58:27] word here he says the word has to be
[58:29] here to come out it's got to be in to
[58:31] come out it can't go out to come in to
[58:33] go out that's what we're trying to do is
[58:35] we're saying everything I need is out
[58:37] here let me bring it in through my mind
[58:38] and I'll accept it here and then it'll
[58:40] go there he says no you got to get it
[58:41] into the soul here and push it out
[58:43] through the mind he says don't treat it
[58:45] as something outside of you it's got to
[58:47] be something that's inside of you the
[58:48] word has to be inside of you and when
[58:49] you have the word which is God himself
[58:51] then you have everything you're ever
[58:53] going to need as we've talked about many
[58:54] times amen amen I put it on the slide
[58:57] here we look at it and it's like we've
[58:59] got healing Deliverance change peace Joy
[59:02] love all these things that we're looking
[59:03] for and we've got them all outside the
[59:05] body and so a special Ministry comes in
[59:08] and we say that's great now I'm going to
[59:09] get what I need and he's saying that's
[59:10] not it he says you're treating that as
[59:12] something that's outside of you he says
[59:14] but if you'll treat it now like it's
[59:16] inside of the Soul if you're sealed with
[59:18] the Holy Spirit this is something now
[59:20] that's going to be in you already you
[59:21] already have it this is not something to
[59:23] be attained to this is something you
[59:25] already have attained it's inside you by
[59:27] the Holy Spirit and all you've got to do
[59:29] is pass it through this mind and get it
[59:31] to accept it he says and it'll flow
[59:32] through everything else in your body
[59:33] that you have need them he says don't
[59:35] look out for it you got to look inward
[59:37] for it get it settled inside and then
[59:39] the outside's going to push it's going
[59:41] to push all the way out through the mind
[59:42] out through the spirit and out through
[59:44] the body and it'll meet every need that
[59:45] you ever have
[59:47] amen amen the fai's got to be on the
[59:49] outside it's not on the in it's got to
[59:51] be on the inside it can't start on the
[59:53] outside amen why the mind's going to
[59:55] make that choice but it's got to be a
[59:57] choice has already been made is really
[59:58] what we're talking about you made a
[1:00:00] choice in the soul and that's what's
[1:00:02] going to drive the choices for
[1:00:03] everything else settle the soul and
[1:00:05] everything else will be there I remember
[1:00:06] we had a a men's meeting one time at a
[1:00:09] particular church and a brother said you
[1:00:11] know we talk about these issues we have
[1:00:13] and this and that the other thing he
[1:00:14] says and everybody says get the Holy
[1:00:16] Ghost he says but that's you know that's
[1:00:20] just two pad of an answer we need
[1:00:21] something more than
[1:00:23] that what do you do with somebody that
[1:00:26] says that doesn't realize that the Holy
[1:00:28] Ghost inside of you is the
[1:00:30] answer I mean that is literally acts 238
[1:00:34] what what are we supposed to do to be
[1:00:36] saved this is it and then after that we
[1:00:38] see men that failed all time and time
[1:00:40] again Peter the classic example after
[1:00:42] that Peter doesn't fail he makes errors
[1:00:46] right he has to be corrected on Doctrine
[1:00:48] these different things but Peter himself
[1:00:50] never walks back from the word again he
[1:00:51] never walks back from the gospel he
[1:00:53] never walks back from the testimony of
[1:00:54] Jesus Christ what is the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:57] the answer you have to get the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost and this brother said that's what
[1:01:00] everybody says but that's like give us
[1:01:02] more when youve got the Holy Ghost you
[1:01:04] have everything of God in you what more
[1:01:06] could he give you that's right so
[1:01:08] brother Braham says he gave you the best
[1:01:09] thing he could give you which was the
[1:01:10] Holy Ghost that's all you need and then
[1:01:13] yes you need teaching we've got a five
[1:01:15] full ministry you need an active body
[1:01:17] you need a a well-built you know Church
[1:01:19] body that's feeding the needs of the
[1:01:20] people and that this all goes together
[1:01:22] that's what God uses but without the
[1:01:23] Holy Ghost you're not getting anywhere
[1:01:25] in the word yeah as in in the
[1:01:27] manifestation of the word the healing of
[1:01:28] the word the Deliverance of the word the
[1:01:30] fruits of the spirit all these things
[1:01:31] you can't get that outside of the Holy
[1:01:32] Ghost blew my mind when he said
[1:01:36] that brother Bram now he takes us back
[1:01:38] this is in in Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:40] yesterday today and forever but he takes
[1:01:42] you back to your original purpose here
[1:01:45] he says and man was made to be a God we
[1:01:48] know that Genesis 1:26 he had dominion
[1:01:50] over the whole earth and he was made to
[1:01:52] be an amateur God and now when he
[1:01:54] receives God he becomes a Son of God
[1:01:57] again that's where we are today you're a
[1:01:59] Son of God again you're a daughter of
[1:02:01] God again today if you have the Holy
[1:02:02] Ghost you are a son or a daughter of God
[1:02:04] he was made in the image of God God had
[1:02:07] hands God had feet and so therefore a
[1:02:08] man was made like him so he's an amateur
[1:02:11] God but sin has blinded every fiber in
[1:02:14] his body in his mind in his heart he
[1:02:17] says now don't ever try to study it out
[1:02:18] you can't figure it out amen he says in
[1:02:21] the Garden of Eden Satan chose his part
[1:02:23] of the man his head his intellectuals
[1:02:26] God took his heart the intellectuals
[1:02:28] will reason why well I'm this way and
[1:02:30] I'm that way you'll never get anywhere
[1:02:32] with God there but your heart your faith
[1:02:35] now look what he's talking about the
[1:02:37] origin now your heart your faith will
[1:02:40] make you believe things that your mind
[1:02:43] knows intellectually nothing about let
[1:02:46] me read that again your heart your faith
[1:02:48] will make you believe things that your
[1:02:50] mind knows nothing about he says You
[1:02:53] cast down reasoning see you must be
[1:02:55] positive and you stay there until you
[1:02:57] are positive then when you're positive
[1:02:58] nothing can turn you he's not talking
[1:03:00] about a positive attitude he's saying
[1:03:01] you stay here until you're positive that
[1:03:03] your soul is sealed to the day of your
[1:03:04] Redemption make your calling and
[1:03:06] election sure make sure that you have
[1:03:07] the Holy Ghost Inside and when you are
[1:03:09] positive that you have that he says then
[1:03:11] nothing can turn you because that's the
[1:03:13] only thing that will keep you from
[1:03:14] turning is the Holy Ghost amen that's
[1:03:17] not me trying to interpret that he says
[1:03:18] when you're positive then there's
[1:03:19] nothing can turn you there's only one
[1:03:21] thing in the scripture that allows you
[1:03:22] to never be turned again and that's the
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost so he says get there when
[1:03:26] you've got the Holy Ghost then you stay
[1:03:28] there till you're positive and nothing
[1:03:29] can turn you you are then a son you are
[1:03:31] a daughter of God being manifested you
[1:03:33] always were amen we've covered this
[1:03:35] before you always were a son you always
[1:03:37] were a daughter but now it's
[1:03:38] manifestation time it's adoption time
[1:03:40] it's stepping into the role and the plan
[1:03:42] and purpose of God for you and then from
[1:03:44] there you're going to start moving into
[1:03:46] what he has for you
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:51] amen let's put this in the word of God
[1:03:53] we talked a lot of quotes here but let's
[1:03:55] take it back to the scriptures amen John
[1:03:57] 9 this is taking everything we've talked
[1:03:59] about and putting it now into a story in
[1:04:02] the scripture amen so listen closely
[1:04:04] John 9 And1 says as Jesus passed by he
[1:04:06] saw a man which was blind from his birth
[1:04:10] think about that man now he's been blind
[1:04:11] from his
[1:04:12] birth and he has no idea why I'm sure
[1:04:15] he's had lots of stories and people have
[1:04:17] told him this that and the other thing
[1:04:19] but Jesus comes here for a very specific
[1:04:21] purpose and his disciples asked him
[1:04:23] saying master who did Sin this man or or
[1:04:25] his parents that he was born blind see
[1:04:27] back then they thought that if something
[1:04:29] bad was in your life it was because you
[1:04:30] did bad or your parents did bad cuz it
[1:04:32] talked about the sins of the father
[1:04:33] going down all the way to the fourth
[1:04:35] generation generation these different
[1:04:37] things and and so they always felt that
[1:04:39] if there was if you were poor if you had
[1:04:41] a a limitation in your body if you were
[1:04:43] dumb if you were ugly whatever it was it
[1:04:45] was because somebody had sinned in your
[1:04:48] family or you sinned okay now he's he
[1:04:50] was born from birth blind so I don't
[1:04:52] know how he sinned right anyways Jesus
[1:04:55] answered and said neither had this man
[1:04:57] sinned nor his parents but that the
[1:05:01] works of God should be made manifest in
[1:05:05] him I must work the works of him that
[1:05:07] sent me while it is day the night cometh
[1:05:10] when no man can work as long as I am in
[1:05:12] the world I am the light of the world
[1:05:16] now let's stop there for a second
[1:05:17] because mentally intellectually if we're
[1:05:19] the blind man what's going through our
[1:05:20] head now cuz we've had these questions
[1:05:23] all our life why am I blind poor me why
[1:05:25] do I have to do this I sit here I beg
[1:05:27] every day woe is me my life is horrible
[1:05:30] and now some man comes along and right
[1:05:32] in front of you they have a conversation
[1:05:34] about you and they say this guy how come
[1:05:37] he's blind is it because he was bad or
[1:05:39] his
[1:05:40] parents Jesus says no no no this has
[1:05:43] nothing to do with him this has to do
[1:05:45] with me and so that I can show The Works
[1:05:47] of my father he says this is for the
[1:05:50] works of God to be made manifest in him
[1:05:53] this is you literally have this problem
[1:05:56] so that God can manifest himself in you
[1:05:59] he's gone through his entire life with
[1:06:00] this problem and it is purely so that he
[1:06:03] can be healed and God can show a work
[1:06:05] and show that he's doing something
[1:06:07] through Christ in that day amen that's
[1:06:09] the only reason he's blind has nothing
[1:06:10] to do with him has everything to do with
[1:06:12] the manifestation of the works of God in
[1:06:16] him verse six says when he had thus
[1:06:18] spoken he spat on the ground and made
[1:06:21] clay of the spittle and he Anointed The
[1:06:23] Eyes Of The Blind Men with the clay now
[1:06:25] I want you to think about this for a
[1:06:27] second it's kind of funny you're
[1:06:29] standing there you can't see and you
[1:06:31] hear somebody
[1:06:34] go
[1:06:36] okay and then you maybe hear I'm rubbing
[1:06:39] down in the dirt and then something
[1:06:42] touches your face and you realize that
[1:06:45] this man has just spit in the ground
[1:06:47] made mud and put it on your
[1:06:50] eyes what do you do what's going through
[1:06:53] your mind are you ping trying to get it
[1:06:56] away or has something else happened that
[1:06:58] allows you to allow him to keep going
[1:07:01] amen Jesus said sorry I didn't click
[1:07:05] Jesus said unto him go wash in the pool
[1:07:08] of salom which is by interpretation
[1:07:12] sent now what are you going to do when
[1:07:14] he says this this man's walked up said
[1:07:16] that you're not you didn't do anything
[1:07:18] bad your parents didn't do anything bad
[1:07:20] you're there to manifest The Works of
[1:07:21] God and then he spits in the ground
[1:07:23] makes mud rubs it on your face and then
[1:07:25] doesn't does tell you to go into the
[1:07:26] house that's behind you and clean up he
[1:07:28] says no you got to go all the way to the
[1:07:29] pool of salom now and and clean up
[1:07:32] there who would do
[1:07:35] it you'd be an idiot to do
[1:07:38] it if you're thinking with the natural
[1:07:40] mind right if something else hasn't
[1:07:42] dropped in there amen but listen to what
[1:07:45] brother brandham says he says when he
[1:07:46] had the blind man his parents talked to
[1:07:48] him he was spitting on the ground while
[1:07:49] talking to the man and the words that he
[1:07:51] was saying over his lips and the saliva
[1:07:52] in his mouth spitting on the ground he
[1:07:54] says do you accept spitting on the
[1:07:55] ground this is covid-19 today right when
[1:07:59] there and when he spit a great big
[1:08:00] puddle of spit on the ground picked it
[1:08:01] up in his hands the M had made a cake
[1:08:03] and put it over the Man's eyes and told
[1:08:05] him to go wash in the pool of salom what
[1:08:07] would the health rule say about that
[1:08:08] today I think we know what they would
[1:08:10] say amen that's ass
[1:08:12] salt
[1:08:14] right now listen we're going to continue
[1:08:16] it says go wash in the pool of salom and
[1:08:19] he went his way therefore and washed and
[1:08:22] came seeing now watch what brother
[1:08:23] Braham says but Jesus spit and the man
[1:08:26] obeyed what he told him to do and he
[1:08:28] came back receiving his sight and they
[1:08:30] marveled listen to this not because of
[1:08:32] the spit not because of the mud but
[1:08:35] because he believed what Jesus told him
[1:08:38] was the truth is that right he says now
[1:08:41] that's what you've got to believe today
[1:08:44] believe it with all your heart he says
[1:08:46] they didn't Marvel because of what Jesus
[1:08:47] did they marveled that the man believed
[1:08:50] and obeyed in the first place Hallelujah
[1:08:53] that is the place of the believer right
[1:08:55] there built to manifest The Works of God
[1:08:58] and you'll obey the silliness of what
[1:09:00] everybody else says makes no sense
[1:09:03] amen amen this man is there so that God
[1:09:06] could show a reality in that day a
[1:09:08] testimony of the power and working of
[1:09:10] God through Christ amen what ought that
[1:09:12] to do to us today amen how many things
[1:09:14] do we have in our lives genetically
[1:09:17] right emotionally relationally
[1:09:20] financially healthwise whatever it is
[1:09:23] how many of us have something that we've
[1:09:24] dealt with all of our
[1:09:26] lives and if we look at this scripture
[1:09:29] and we know that everything is under our
[1:09:31] foot then what out that to tell us that
[1:09:34] it's there for if only to do what
[1:09:37] manifest The Works of God in our life if
[1:09:39] we were perfect creatures where would
[1:09:41] the power of God be in our lives amen
[1:09:42] but when we're dealing with these things
[1:09:44] when we're facing these things then what
[1:09:46] is it it's something that God can show
[1:09:48] himself real in our life to us and to
[1:09:51] others that are looking on our lives
[1:09:52] amen and they won't see that anywhere
[1:09:54] else they won't see that anywhere else
[1:09:56] we are the ones that they're looking at
[1:09:58] we are the Epistles seen and read of all
[1:09:59] men and so when they see that one day
[1:10:01] Jonathan was this way and then the next
[1:10:03] day he was this way whether it's fi
[1:10:05] whether it's his health whether it's a
[1:10:07] mannerism whether it's a an issue he has
[1:10:09] with certain people whatever it may be
[1:10:12] they see one day he's this way and then
[1:10:13] the next he's that and they say what
[1:10:15] happened God took it away from me God
[1:10:17] healed me here's my testimony of what
[1:10:19] God's done in my life amen what is it
[1:10:22] he's come and he's put those things in
[1:10:24] our lives so that he can manifest The
[1:10:26] Works of God even today
[1:10:29] amen look at what the neighbors said the
[1:10:32] neighbors therefore and they which had
[1:10:33] seen him that he was blind and said is
[1:10:35] this not he that sat and begged some
[1:10:37] said this is he others said he's like
[1:10:39] him but he said I am he therefore said
[1:10:42] he unto thee him how were thine eyes
[1:10:45] opened here's the answer he answered and
[1:10:47] said a man that is called Jesus made
[1:10:49] clay and anointed my eyes and said to me
[1:10:51] go to the pool of salom and wash and I
[1:10:52] went and washed and I received sight
[1:10:55] very matter of fact there isn't a big
[1:10:58] story he says a man told me to do
[1:11:00] something I went and did it and here I
[1:11:02] am it's that simple what a
[1:11:05] response he put mud on my eyes told me
[1:11:08] to go wash off in the pool of salom and
[1:11:09] I did it and I received my sight end of
[1:11:12] story nothing special to see here guys I
[1:11:14] didn't do anything crazy I just listened
[1:11:16] to him but remember the quote we said
[1:11:18] that brother Bram said he said they they
[1:11:20] marveled not because of what had been
[1:11:22] done to him but that he had obeyed that
[1:11:24] he had believed what Jesus had said amen
[1:11:27] what did Brother Ram say faith will make
[1:11:29] you believe things that your mind knows
[1:11:31] nothing about something about that
[1:11:33] conversation that identified him that
[1:11:35] put him in the word that put him in the
[1:11:37] purpose and plan of God it took his
[1:11:39] faith and it started to rise up and all
[1:11:40] of a sudden he says this is somebody
[1:11:43] that I can take this is somebody I can
[1:11:45] believe this is somebody I can put Faith
[1:11:46] in there's more here than just a man
[1:11:49] there's something going on that I'm a
[1:11:50] part of and I'm going to take every
[1:11:52] advantage of it and I'm going to do what
[1:11:53] he says cuz what I've done before hasn't
[1:11:55] hasn't got me anywhere amen what a
[1:11:57] scripture amen I went and washed and I
[1:12:00] received sight it's no different today
[1:12:03] what do the scripture say if you need
[1:12:05] healing you can have it a couple
[1:12:07] different ways you can be like the
[1:12:08] Centurion where brother Bram talked
[1:12:09] about where you can just claim it by
[1:12:11] faith and it happens you can have the
[1:12:13] elders lay hand on you and anoint you
[1:12:14] amen if you got a demon on you if you
[1:12:16] got a problem in your life we can lay
[1:12:18] hands on you all these things we've got
[1:12:19] all sorts of methods here but it's up to
[1:12:21] you to say what am I going to take but
[1:12:23] you've got to take something and go with
[1:12:25] it amen you've got to stick with it
[1:12:27] you've got to say this is what he said
[1:12:28] to do so I'm doing it and I'm going to
[1:12:30] have what he said and it's just that
[1:12:32] simple that's what he's saying he told
[1:12:33] me what to do I did it and I got what he
[1:12:35] said I was going to get and the word is
[1:12:36] no different for us when we're looking
[1:12:38] at it what does he say to do I've done
[1:12:40] it I've met every requirement brother BR
[1:12:41] says if you meet the requirement he's
[1:12:43] obligated to do exactly what he did with
[1:12:45] the other person there's nothing can
[1:12:46] hold it back and the only variable there
[1:12:48] is time is he going to do it right now
[1:12:49] is he going to do it tomorrow is he
[1:12:50] going to do it next week or next year
[1:12:52] right like he said if you speak to the
[1:12:54] mountain say move he said it'll move but
[1:12:56] he didn't say when but it's still going
[1:12:58] to move and that's the only that's the
[1:12:59] trial of your faith is to wait until it
[1:13:00] happens but you hold there and say I did
[1:13:02] what he told me to do and now what's
[1:13:04] going to what he said would happen is
[1:13:06] going to happen amen that Faith what did
[1:13:08] it do it drop down in here and then it
[1:13:11] made his mind do what Jesus said because
[1:13:15] he had to make a choice remember that
[1:13:17] Faith had to override what he would
[1:13:18] naturally want to do if you've got mud
[1:13:20] all over your eyes and face you want to
[1:13:21] get it off quickly but it had to go now
[1:13:23] and say are you going to obey yes then
[1:13:25] it comes down to his legs and makes his
[1:13:27] legs move all the way to the pool of
[1:13:29] salom then it makes his arms bend down
[1:13:30] and go and clean it off of his face he
[1:13:32] had to bring his body into subjection he
[1:13:34] had to bring his Spirit into subjection
[1:13:35] for this to happen it wasn't just you
[1:13:38] know across the street he had to go to
[1:13:40] the pool of salom he had to do exactly
[1:13:42] what Jesus said he had to bring
[1:13:43] everything into subjection if you
[1:13:46] remember the end of this story it's
[1:13:47] incredible I mean a man has received a
[1:13:49] sight and they kicked him out of the
[1:13:50] synagogue because he said this man is of
[1:13:52] God he says Jesus is of God and his
[1:13:54] parents even after seeing their son
[1:13:57] healed would not say that Jesus was the
[1:14:00] one that did it or that this was a
[1:14:01] miracle why because they had said that
[1:14:03] anybody that says that Jesus was sent
[1:14:06] from God or whatever they'd be kicked
[1:14:07] out of the synagogue so the parents
[1:14:08] didn't want that they need their
[1:14:10] denomination amen so they said look he's
[1:14:12] a man he's of age go ask him and they
[1:14:14] went to him and he said look all I know
[1:14:16] is one day I was blind the next day I
[1:14:19] have my sight that's it he says and it's
[1:14:22] only we haven't seen this ever happen so
[1:14:24] he says it only comes from God this
[1:14:25] isn't of Satan so this man is of God and
[1:14:27] they kicked him out of the they kicked
[1:14:28] him out of the the synagogue says and
[1:14:31] Jesus heard that they cast him out and
[1:14:33] when he found him he said to him DST
[1:14:35] thou believe on the Son of God he
[1:14:37] answered and said unto him who is he
[1:14:38] Lord that I might believe on him and
[1:14:40] Jesus said unto him thou Hast both seen
[1:14:42] him and it is he that talketh with thee
[1:14:45] so up to that point this man just
[1:14:47] believes that Jesus is a man of God like
[1:14:49] a prophet perhaps you know and he said
[1:14:51] Lord I believe and he worshiped him the
[1:14:54] very same faith that got him to accept
[1:14:56] his his healing got him to recognize who
[1:14:58] it was that was standing right there in
[1:15:00] front of him amen this was a child of
[1:15:02] God through and through right and he
[1:15:03] didn't just get his healing he got
[1:15:05] salvation here and I'm sure he went all
[1:15:06] the way on and and became you know maybe
[1:15:09] he was in the upper room later for all
[1:15:10] we know but he says Lord I believe just
[1:15:12] like that
[1:15:15] boom he believed and he worships him
[1:15:19] he's kicked out of the synagogue he's
[1:15:20] never going back but he's got his sight
[1:15:22] spiritually he's got his sight
[1:15:23] physically now amen and Jesus said for
[1:15:26] judgment am I come into this world that
[1:15:28] they which see not might see and they
[1:15:32] which see might be made blind oh I love
[1:15:35] that he says that they which see not
[1:15:37] might see that they which are defeated
[1:15:39] might have victory that they which are
[1:15:41] weak might be strong that they which are
[1:15:42] sick might be well that they which are
[1:15:44] depressed might have joy that they which
[1:15:45] are lost might be found that they which
[1:15:48] have not would have so he's saying
[1:15:50] that's what I've come to the ones that
[1:15:52] have needs he says I'm here to meet it
[1:15:54] the ones that think they don't need it
[1:15:56] they don't get anything that was the
[1:15:57] Pharisees and the Sadducees each one
[1:16:00] right what is it he's coming to those
[1:16:02] that have a need not to those that
[1:16:03] declare they have everything Pharisees
[1:16:05] what did they always say they went back
[1:16:06] to pedigree and they went back to the
[1:16:08] law yeah right we are the sons of
[1:16:12] Abraham we are the children of Abraham
[1:16:14] and we do everything that the scriptures
[1:16:16] say right that's what they fell back on
[1:16:19] their works and their pedigree Jesus
[1:16:21] doesn't have anything to do with that
[1:16:22] amen that's not what we're looking to as
[1:16:24] our works and our ped agree so when we
[1:16:26] say what it's too big it's too tough
[1:16:27] It's too ingrained I've tried
[1:16:29] everything right the blind man I'm sure
[1:16:31] he tried all sorts of Remedies all sorts
[1:16:33] of healers right nothing doesn't matter
[1:16:38] past experience and the current
[1:16:39] condition have nothing to do with it
[1:16:40] then we're not looking to what we have
[1:16:42] we're not looking to what we are we're
[1:16:43] looking to the word that says that we
[1:16:45] would have what we have need of and that
[1:16:46] he can change us that he can heal us
[1:16:48] that he can deliver us that he can save
[1:16:50] us that he can fill us that he can
[1:16:51] strengthen each and every one of us
[1:16:53] amen amen
[1:16:59] Amen brother Bram starts to make a shift
[1:17:01] now and how he's talking he starts to
[1:17:03] focus on the five inner senses and the
[1:17:05] five outer senses but he really starts
[1:17:07] to focus more on the spirit side of
[1:17:09] things you know affection memory
[1:17:10] conscience and these different things
[1:17:12] reason and whatnot and he starts to call
[1:17:14] them channels and when I was doing a
[1:17:16] study he did a lot of he spoke a lot of
[1:17:18] of senses and then he called them Gates
[1:17:20] but now he starts moving to channels and
[1:17:22] it's kind of like the idea of uh you
[1:17:24] know a furn or a fireplace or something
[1:17:26] like that where you've got what you've
[1:17:28] got chimneys that come out and he says
[1:17:30] you got to keep those chimneys clear
[1:17:31] otherwise the fire can't exhaust right
[1:17:34] the smoke can't go out it starts to clog
[1:17:36] it down then the fire can't breathe Well
[1:17:38] it can't exhaust well and it just
[1:17:39] eventually goes out right so he says you
[1:17:41] know the chimney is supposed to be there
[1:17:43] to allow the fire to function properly
[1:17:45] but when it gets blocked up it doesn't
[1:17:47] he says and these senses are no
[1:17:48] different and here he says if you get
[1:17:50] them all blocked up with doubt and these
[1:17:52] different things then it's going to
[1:17:53] hinder the moving of of the holy spirit
[1:17:55] in your life and so you got to clear
[1:17:57] those out
[1:17:58] amen so they'll hold back or they'll
[1:18:00] resist your healing Deliverance Joy
[1:18:02] whatever it is you're looking for then
[1:18:04] they'll hold you back cuz they get
[1:18:05] clogged up with something and the
[1:18:07] problem is like we said is so often
[1:18:09] we're looking and people are coming in
[1:18:11] to church or they're coming to a service
[1:18:12] or they're coming to a Ministry and
[1:18:14] they're saying I have need of these
[1:18:15] things and they're treating it all as
[1:18:16] outside and the problem is they've got
[1:18:18] all these things clogged up inside and
[1:18:20] so when they're trying to push it in
[1:18:21] it's just pushing it deeper and deeper
[1:18:23] into their body it's not cleaning it out
[1:18:25] it's pushing it in and then eventually
[1:18:26] you just get it so packed down with
[1:18:28] things and I think sister Kimberly sent
[1:18:30] the the quote the other day about
[1:18:31] letting off the pressure and the problem
[1:18:33] is when it when it's out here and it's
[1:18:35] pushing in all it's doing is you got two
[1:18:36] things working on it's just packing it
[1:18:38] Tighter and Tighter and Tighter and
[1:18:39] something's going to give eventually
[1:18:41] right brother BR says you got to keep
[1:18:42] them clean and we'll get into that a
[1:18:44] little bit
[1:18:45] amen amen when people are coming in like
[1:18:48] this and they're looking at out outside
[1:18:49] it's always a what if and a maybe and a
[1:18:51] possibility as opposed to a certainty
[1:18:54] right and it's never going to work that
[1:18:56] way brother Bram says it must be
[1:18:58] accepted in the mind and then it's
[1:19:00] believed with the heart then the word of
[1:19:02] God becomes a reality then every senses
[1:19:04] of soul and body is just scoured out
[1:19:07] with the Holy Spirit then your sense of
[1:19:10] God your conscience of God everything
[1:19:12] that's Godly flows through you there's
[1:19:14] not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can
[1:19:16] rise up why because it's cleaned out
[1:19:18] it's scoured out there's nothing can
[1:19:19] come up in the memory and say well I
[1:19:21] remember Mrs Jones tried to trust God
[1:19:22] and miss so and so and Miss do tried to
[1:19:24] trust God for healing one time and she
[1:19:26] failed see but if that channel has been
[1:19:29] cleared out and been purged and been
[1:19:33] filled on the inside with the holy
[1:19:34] spirit so we got to be careful because
[1:19:37] sometimes it's like scripture says you
[1:19:39] clean out the house but you don't fill
[1:19:40] it with anything else and then the the
[1:19:43] demon comes back with seven others
[1:19:44] stronger than himself right sometimes we
[1:19:46] the holy spirit does a work in our life
[1:19:48] and we clean out all these things but
[1:19:50] then he says you can't just clean it he
[1:19:51] says you got to fill it with something
[1:19:53] that's the Holy Spirit faith in the word
[1:19:55] in these different things he says you
[1:19:56] it's got to be cleared out and purged
[1:19:58] and then filled on the inside with the
[1:20:00] Holy Spirit then those things don't even
[1:20:02] come into memory no matter what missed
[1:20:04] Jones and what she did it's you and God
[1:20:06] together and nobody else but you two
[1:20:08] there you are there's your battle kill
[1:20:10] him at the beginning stop him dead in
[1:20:12] his tracks it ain't how long you can
[1:20:14] make the war linger it stop it right now
[1:20:18] and the problem is like I said is you
[1:20:19] clean it out but you don't fill it with
[1:20:21] anything and so these things start to
[1:20:22] trickle back in and then Satan has
[1:20:24] another foothold again and now you're
[1:20:25] fighting the same battle over and over
[1:20:27] and over again he says if you'll come
[1:20:30] and you'll keep them memories and
[1:20:31] conscience and everything thinking about
[1:20:33] well I might fail it might not be right
[1:20:35] he says don't you do that at all you
[1:20:37] throw aside everything and open up the
[1:20:40] channel and say God your word is
[1:20:42] eternally true and it's for me we all
[1:20:45] have tremendous faith for the other
[1:20:46] person don't we right have you ever
[1:20:49] noticed that when somebody else is going
[1:20:51] up for healing going up for deliverance
[1:20:53] going up for a need we've got tremendous
[1:20:55] Faith amen but he says you got to say
[1:20:58] that it's for me not your word is
[1:21:01] eternally true for Joe but your word is
[1:21:03] eternally true for Jonathan and that's
[1:21:05] the challenge for us is it's it's for me
[1:21:08] I'm under the banner of the word you can
[1:21:10] have the Holy Ghost and people still get
[1:21:12] these complexes where they say it's not
[1:21:13] for me it's for everybody else but it's
[1:21:15] not for me this is mine to bear it's
[1:21:17] mine to bear I'm going to have to deal
[1:21:18] with this all my life it's never going
[1:21:20] to be resolved da d da d da d da no he
[1:21:22] says your word is eternally true and
[1:21:25] it's for me if the whole church fails if
[1:21:29] the whole world fails yet I can't fail
[1:21:32] because I'm taking your word there's a
[1:21:36] battle that's the thing what's he saying
[1:21:38] throw everything aside push it out clean
[1:21:41] it out fill it with the word fill it
[1:21:43] with faith let the Holy Spirit flow
[1:21:45] through it and dwell on the promise not
[1:21:46] on the past not on somebody others
[1:21:48] somebody else's failures not on those
[1:21:50] that have lacked faith not those that
[1:21:52] have fallen by the wayside focus on the
[1:21:54] promis of the word amen so what's the
[1:21:57] secret how do you get to that
[1:21:59] place Philippians 4 says be careful for
[1:22:03] nothing that say almost seems like it
[1:22:06] means don't wor don't think about
[1:22:08] anything don't do anything but the
[1:22:09] amplifi says do not fret or have any
[1:22:11] anxiety about anything what it means is
[1:22:14] don't be worried about anything but in
[1:22:18] everything not in most things in some
[1:22:20] things but in everything by prayer and
[1:22:23] supplication
[1:22:25] with
[1:22:26] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:22:29] known unto God so this is how we
[1:22:30] approach God right with Thanksgiving for
[1:22:33] what he has done and what he will do
[1:22:37] always with Thanksgiving you go in with
[1:22:39] a thankful heart when we're having
[1:22:41] devotions at home you know at the end
[1:22:43] when we pray we always start with praise
[1:22:46] reports before we go into prayer
[1:22:49] requests right that's what you start
[1:22:51] with you start with Thanksgiving and you
[1:22:53] go in with a fa F heart you go in with
[1:22:55] an expectant heart and say Lord we're
[1:22:57] we're we're we're reminding you and
[1:22:59] we're thanking you for what you've done
[1:23:01] and Lord we're looking for the same
[1:23:03] thing to happen for these requests now
[1:23:05] amen go in with Thanksgiving and prayer
[1:23:07] and supplication you always start with
[1:23:09] the Thanksgiving he says and if you do
[1:23:11] this then the peace of God verse 7 which
[1:23:13] passees all understanding shall keep
[1:23:16] your hearts and Minds through Christ
[1:23:19] Jesus so this is how you keep your mind
[1:23:21] he says is through prayer and
[1:23:22] supplication with Thanksgiving amen
[1:23:25] notice that last bit it says it will
[1:23:27] keep your hearts and Minds through
[1:23:28] Christ Jesus it will keep it it will
[1:23:30] preserve it it will protect it it will
[1:23:32] hold it the Amplified says and God's
[1:23:35] peace which transcends all understanding
[1:23:38] shall Garrison and mount guard over your
[1:23:41] hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus shall
[1:23:43] Garrison and mount guard over your
[1:23:45] hearts what does it mean to Garrison
[1:23:47] when you have a Garrison what does it
[1:23:49] mean it means there's a bunch of
[1:23:50] soldiers in there it means there's an
[1:23:51] army inside there to hold what is in
[1:23:54] there right and that's what it's saying
[1:23:56] is that the God's peace is going to set
[1:23:59] up an army inside there and it's going
[1:24:01] to mount a guard over your heart and
[1:24:04] over your mind in Christ Jesus
[1:24:07] amen sorry then he says finally
[1:24:10] Brethren so you've done all that and
[1:24:13] when it mounts a Garrison when there's
[1:24:14] an army inside of you now that's
[1:24:16] guarding your mind what is it going to
[1:24:18] do verse 8 says finally Brethren
[1:24:21] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:24:23] Things Are honest whatsoever things are
[1:24:25] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:24:27] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:24:29] things are of good report if there be
[1:24:31] any virtue that's strength so if there's
[1:24:33] any strength if there be any praise
[1:24:36] think on these things this is the
[1:24:38] Garrison in your mind this is a Holy
[1:24:40] Spirit Army in your mind now that's
[1:24:42] telling you what to dwell on and he says
[1:24:44] things that are true honest just pure
[1:24:47] lovely good report and it's going to
[1:24:49] give you what strength and
[1:24:51] praise think on these things that's what
[1:24:54] he's saying that's how you keep it
[1:24:55] that's how the Holy Spirit keeps is it
[1:24:57] keeps your mind on those things so if
[1:24:59] you're dealing with a situation if
[1:25:00] you're looking for something in the word
[1:25:02] of God if the promises of God are being
[1:25:03] Amplified then what do you do you're
[1:25:06] going to spend time in the word you're
[1:25:08] going to be reading your Bible you're
[1:25:09] going to be praying you're going to be
[1:25:11] singing songs you're going to be
[1:25:12] listening to songs you're going to be
[1:25:13] hanging around with Believers that have
[1:25:15] a like mind to you that are believing
[1:25:16] for healing Deliverance change all these
[1:25:18] different things you're going to be
[1:25:20] feeding that so that that's what's
[1:25:22] inside your mind all the time amen
[1:25:24] you're going to be thinking on the good
[1:25:25] things not on who failed not on how long
[1:25:28] it's taken not on these different things
[1:25:30] but you're going to be dwelling on the
[1:25:31] goodness of God
[1:25:34] Amen why you're going to keep pressure
[1:25:37] on your other senses to keep them clear
[1:25:39] keep the holy spirit inside there so
[1:25:41] things don't get to come in
[1:25:43] Amen brother Braham says this what was
[1:25:45] the matter he says you had to open the
[1:25:48] Channel first you got to get the soldier
[1:25:50] the Holy Spirit placed at the
[1:25:51] Battlefront that takes God's word he is
[1:25:54] the word and he stands there and there's
[1:25:55] nothing going to stop it then there's
[1:25:57] nothing can every one of the other
[1:25:59] channels is cleared out just like an old
[1:26:01] boiler with the flu stopped up if you
[1:26:03] put a fire in it it'll blow your thing
[1:26:05] up right because it can't hold the
[1:26:07] pressure very long that's what the
[1:26:09] matter with so many blowed up Christians
[1:26:12] is because they didn't clean the
[1:26:13] channels out they don't go down to the
[1:26:15] inside You' got to clean it conscience
[1:26:18] memory thoughts laying aside everything
[1:26:21] and coming from the inside out
[1:26:25] with that unadulterated word of God that
[1:26:27] it's the
[1:26:29] truth you look at it you'll see it so
[1:26:32] many times special meetings who comes to
[1:26:34] special meetings everybody people that
[1:26:37] haven't been to church for days weeks
[1:26:39] months everybody comes to special meanss
[1:26:41] and they come in there and they've got
[1:26:42] this little special need or this special
[1:26:43] request and what happens is they're
[1:26:45] coming in and it's all out here and
[1:26:47] they're trying to bring it in they're
[1:26:48] trying to get something something
[1:26:49] that'll take them to the next set of
[1:26:50] meetings the next Camp the next this the
[1:26:52] next that brother Brown says that's what
[1:26:54] blows Christians up is that they don't
[1:26:56] have this all worked out and so they're
[1:26:58] coming in trying to force it down
[1:26:59] through it and they're trying to take it
[1:27:01] through an intellectual side as opposed
[1:27:02] to a faith built side in their soul amen
[1:27:05] it blows you up that's what he says it
[1:27:07] blows you up if you're not taking care
[1:27:09] of the inside and you're trying to bring
[1:27:10] stuff in it's not going to work he says
[1:27:11] you got to get it settled in here and
[1:27:13] then it can flow out amen let's take
[1:27:16] this into the scripture very familiar
[1:27:18] scripture Isaiah 59:19 says when the
[1:27:21] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:27:23] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:27:25] standard against him I want you to catch
[1:27:27] something here it says when the enemy
[1:27:28] shall come in like a flood the enemy
[1:27:30] wasn't in there in the first place the
[1:27:31] enem is outside man we're talking about
[1:27:33] Believers here the enem is out
[1:27:35] here so what does that mean about the
[1:27:38] spirit spirit's got to be here because
[1:27:40] the spirit raises up a standard amen
[1:27:43] right so when the enemy comes in the one
[1:27:45] that is already there is going to raise
[1:27:47] up the standard so if you don't have the
[1:27:48] Holy Spirit what are you left with when
[1:27:50] Satan comes in your mind you're going to
[1:27:53] fight with your mind all in all over and
[1:27:55] over and over and the battles of the
[1:27:56] mind you're never going to win on your
[1:27:57] own amen we know you don't win a mind
[1:27:59] battle with the mind you've got to win
[1:28:01] it with the Holy Spirit in your soul
[1:28:03] amen but it says what's on the inside is
[1:28:05] going to raise up the standard so on the
[1:28:06] believer the spirit is the one that's on
[1:28:09] the inside and then it says it raises up
[1:28:10] a standard now what's a standard we
[1:28:13] don't think of this so much today but
[1:28:14] back in the days way back when they
[1:28:16] always had a standard in the armies and
[1:28:19] it was to identify what whose Army it
[1:28:22] was who was leading the army
[1:28:25] right so if there was a king there then
[1:28:27] he'd have a flag he'd have a standard or
[1:28:29] he'd have a a gold or a brass you know
[1:28:32] figure of some sort on a on a high pole
[1:28:34] and as long as that standard was up in
[1:28:36] the air they knew that the the king or
[1:28:38] the general or whatever was alive and
[1:28:39] well and he was in control so he the
[1:28:41] scripture is saying now when the enemy
[1:28:43] comes in like a flood the Holy Spirit
[1:28:45] raises up a standard and says somebody's
[1:28:47] already here right this place is already
[1:28:50] occupied and now we're identifying who's
[1:28:52] in the battle and the spirit is is
[1:28:54] fighting for me now amen so the battle
[1:28:56] isn't mine the battle is the holy spirit
[1:28:58] cuz the Holy Spirit raises up the
[1:28:59] standard and all I've got to do is keep
[1:29:01] feeding that Holy Spirit opening up
[1:29:02] those channels to him and he raises up a
[1:29:04] standard and the battle's over before it
[1:29:05] starts cuz the Satan can't defeat the
[1:29:08] holy spirit amen he can keep pushing he
[1:29:10] can keep shoving he can keep fighting
[1:29:12] but he's never going to break through
[1:29:13] amen the holy spirit's the one raising
[1:29:15] up the standard it's not me fighting the
[1:29:16] battle it's the holy spirit inside of me
[1:29:18] and what is the standard the standard
[1:29:20] for the holy spirit is always the word
[1:29:22] it's always the word it's never going to
[1:29:23] be a Ministry it's never going to be a
[1:29:25] man it's never going to be an idea or a
[1:29:26] Doctrine it's going to be the word over
[1:29:28] and over and over again how do you know
[1:29:30] that's what Jesus defeated Satan with
[1:29:31] the first time it is written it is
[1:29:33] written it is written thus sayeth the
[1:29:34] Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith
[1:29:36] the Lord and that's what the holy
[1:29:37] spirit's using in the believer's life
[1:29:39] amen amen now brother Brandon watch how
[1:29:42] he starts to address these channels
[1:29:44] these Gates these senses to our bodies
[1:29:46] this will help you when you're dealing
[1:29:47] with something because we want to say
[1:29:49] you know and often we hear this idea of
[1:29:52] well just ignore it you know don't don't
[1:29:55] pay any attention to your reason don't
[1:29:56] pay any attention to your memory or your
[1:29:58] affection or these different things if
[1:29:59] you're feeling bad don't pay attention
[1:30:01] to it you know if you're sick don't pay
[1:30:03] attention to your senses but that's not
[1:30:05] what brother Braham says watch what he
[1:30:06] says here he says there it is right
[1:30:09] there those channels he says you just
[1:30:11] get them open up don't just bypass them
[1:30:15] cuz so often we're saying well those
[1:30:16] aren't redeemable those aren't those
[1:30:18] aren't under you know that's not the sav
[1:30:20] portion of our body so let's just bypass
[1:30:22] them he says no no no don't bypass him
[1:30:24] he says open them up and push this now
[1:30:27] through them right bring them under
[1:30:29] subjection bring them under control so
[1:30:32] that the Holy Spirit can flow through
[1:30:33] them don't bypass them where you want to
[1:30:35] bypass them is on the way in but on the
[1:30:38] way out now we've got to bring this
[1:30:39] whole thing under subjection so he says
[1:30:40] don't go around them go through them let
[1:30:42] the Holy Spirit clean them out and push
[1:30:44] these things out of your life so that
[1:30:46] you can have full full Victory amen he
[1:30:48] says when Satan walked up to even said
[1:30:50] you know the fruit is Pleasant she
[1:30:51] stopped for a moment well that's when
[1:30:53] she made a mistake when she stopped for
[1:30:55] a moment he says don't stop for nothing
[1:30:57] you've got the message Jesus lives this
[1:31:00] is the message he says Jesus Lives God
[1:31:02] Is A Healer that's the message don't
[1:31:06] stop for nothing no reasonings no
[1:31:08] nothing else but he's saying don't go
[1:31:09] around them go through them don't let
[1:31:11] them hold you up just pound it through
[1:31:13] amen just drive it through fill them
[1:31:16] with the word of God and that's how
[1:31:17] you're going to sedu them fill them with
[1:31:18] faith fill them with the holy spirit
[1:31:20] amen now brother br's dealing a lot with
[1:31:23] healing in this service cuz this is what
[1:31:25] most people came to his meetings for
[1:31:28] right and he starts to address this idea
[1:31:31] of why do some people get healed and
[1:31:33] other people not and why is it that some
[1:31:35] take longer and some don't and and these
[1:31:37] different things like that amen and we
[1:31:39] know God's working on different things
[1:31:41] in our lives and he has a purpose and he
[1:31:42] has a plan so Deliverance isn't always
[1:31:45] immediate we know that especially when
[1:31:46] we're talking about things in the spirit
[1:31:48] realm when we start getting into
[1:31:50] relationship issues emotional issues
[1:31:52] memory issues past experience
[1:31:54] past failures past hurts and these
[1:31:56] different things that can take a long
[1:31:58] time before God will actually clear that
[1:32:00] out but even with physical healing
[1:32:01] sometimes it happens immediately and
[1:32:03] sometimes it takes a while
[1:32:05] amen but we know that it has to be by
[1:32:08] faith these things happen by faith they
[1:32:09] don't happen by emotion they don't
[1:32:11] happen by the education these different
[1:32:13] things it has to be by faith so there's
[1:32:14] a moment of faith that occurs and in
[1:32:17] that moment that's when the work is done
[1:32:18] in time right it's a finished work
[1:32:21] everything that we've got here is done
[1:32:22] Deliverance is done healing is is done
[1:32:24] salvation's done all of it's completed
[1:32:25] it's a finished work man that's what
[1:32:27] Calvary did for us but we're a creatures
[1:32:29] of time and so there's this element here
[1:32:32] that we've got to deal with and that's
[1:32:33] that God doesn't always deal with it
[1:32:34] right then and there he may be dealing
[1:32:36] with it but the finished work may come
[1:32:37] in time or it may happen
[1:32:40] immediately so brother Bram says this he
[1:32:43] says when that bomb of Faith drops in
[1:32:46] there in the soul with the word of God
[1:32:48] behind it it blows every devil every
[1:32:49] sickness every disease you say is that
[1:32:51] right brother brandom when that then why
[1:32:53] why does it on some and not on
[1:32:56] others he says it's because of the
[1:32:58] channel you look out you can look out
[1:33:01] and see it but you got to have it in
[1:33:03] here so he says you can look out and see
[1:33:05] he says your eyes are here and they're
[1:33:07] looking out and they're seeing healing
[1:33:08] here you just pick this up so I can do
[1:33:10] this so he says you've got to have it in
[1:33:14] here looking this way he says not out
[1:33:19] there looking in you got to be in
[1:33:22] looking out so you can't come through
[1:33:24] reason you can't come through these
[1:33:26] things we've got to come right down
[1:33:27] God's channel of it right into the soul
[1:33:30] remember when we're looking for
[1:33:31] something to come in we've got to bypass
[1:33:33] all those things and get it here but
[1:33:35] when it's in here now it's got to push
[1:33:36] through those things right so it's a bit
[1:33:39] of an odd thing you skip them on the way
[1:33:40] in but then you you subdue them you
[1:33:42] bring them into subjection on the way
[1:33:43] out
[1:33:45] amen he says you can't come through
[1:33:47] these other things you've got to come
[1:33:48] right down God's channel of it right
[1:33:50] down into the soul this is where we
[1:33:52] start in the service amen so like I said
[1:33:54] people are looking at these things as if
[1:33:56] they're outside and if you got the Holy
[1:33:58] Ghost everything you have need of is in
[1:33:59] here right it's like if you take a
[1:34:02] teaspoon of the ocean you got everything
[1:34:04] that's in the ocean within you and when
[1:34:05] you take a portion of the of the
[1:34:08] infinite God you've got everything you
[1:34:10] need inside of you amen it's God's life
[1:34:11] himself
[1:34:12] amen but so many of us are trying to do
[1:34:15] what we're trying to bring it through
[1:34:16] here we're saying well could it be true
[1:34:19] some of us are believing for for
[1:34:20] tremendous things in our lives and we're
[1:34:23] saying could it be true true why cuz
[1:34:25] we're we're fighting in the mind that's
[1:34:27] the battle of the mind we're saying
[1:34:28] could it be true could it be for me is
[1:34:30] this for me is this something I'm going
[1:34:31] to have to deal with take it back to the
[1:34:33] word the word never left anybody no no
[1:34:36] believer ever stayed under those things
[1:34:39] even Paul look at brother Brandon
[1:34:41] brother Bram fought those stomach issues
[1:34:42] his entire life until just before the
[1:34:44] end and then it was a finished work he
[1:34:46] had a battle but there was always a
[1:34:48] Deliverance at the End Amen and it's
[1:34:50] sticking through the times that you've
[1:34:52] got to hold on that's the difficulty
[1:34:54] isn't it when it's lingering and you say
[1:34:56] Lord I've done everything i' I I've had
[1:34:58] to I believed your word my life is
[1:35:00] Sanctified I'm not doing anything I
[1:35:01] shouldn't my conscience is clear why
[1:35:03] isn't it happening that's the trial of
[1:35:05] your faith having done all to stand
[1:35:08] stand that's the point stand and stand
[1:35:11] and stand and keep the standard of the
[1:35:12] word by the holy spirit in your life and
[1:35:14] stand and stand and stand and say Lord I
[1:35:16] believe it's like John Ryan amen the
[1:35:18] blind man that went up brother Brown
[1:35:21] said you're healed he came back that
[1:35:23] evening I believe and said I thought you
[1:35:25] said I was healed he said I thought you
[1:35:27] said you believe he went out and
[1:35:29] testified two weeks later he's in the
[1:35:31] barber chair and his eyes come open he
[1:35:32] could see right the trial of your faith
[1:35:34] is what it's doing and the thing is when
[1:35:36] you have that Victory now you start
[1:35:38] moving on to the next thing and things
[1:35:39] start to fall a little more quickly
[1:35:41] because why you can see what God is
[1:35:43] doing in your life and you've become a
[1:35:44] real weapon in his hands
[1:35:48] amen what is
[1:35:50] it that little bit of disbelief brother
[1:35:52] Braham says if and if one little ioda of
[1:35:55] God's word was dis disbelieved and
[1:35:56] caused all this trouble how are we going
[1:35:58] to get back by dis disbelieving the word
[1:36:01] you can't do it you've got to shut off
[1:36:02] all these other things conscience
[1:36:04] memories and say reasonings and all
[1:36:06] these other things casting down
[1:36:07] reasonings we don't reason about it at
[1:36:10] all nothing at all we just accept the
[1:36:12] word upon the basis that God said so and
[1:36:15] that sets a stream between you and God
[1:36:18] every channel comes open between you and
[1:36:20] God then so when that Soul stream is
[1:36:23] open the is filled with the holy spirit
[1:36:24] the mind is open by faith that's when
[1:36:26] something starts to happen amen like I
[1:36:29] said sometimes it's immediate sometimes
[1:36:30] it takes a while but the mountains got
[1:36:32] to move because everything is opened up
[1:36:34] and it's God that's moving not you how
[1:36:36] foolish you you think Satan's out there
[1:36:38] trying to tell us to believe for the
[1:36:40] things that we're believing for S Satan
[1:36:42] has better things to do than to try and
[1:36:43] get us to believe God's word he doesn't
[1:36:46] want to tempt Fate on the chance that
[1:36:48] you're a Believer and you believe it and
[1:36:50] he gets kicked out amen he doesn't work
[1:36:51] against himself like that if you're
[1:36:53] believing in a promise if the if the
[1:36:55] word of God has been quickened to you
[1:36:56] that's the Holy Spirit that's doing that
[1:36:58] it's not Satan so Satan's never going to
[1:37:00] try and get you to believe that amen
[1:37:02] it's the Holy Spirit that's bringing
[1:37:03] that to your attention that's quickening
[1:37:04] it to you brother Braham says when God
[1:37:07] can get a man in his hands till he gets
[1:37:09] the senses conscience everything cleared
[1:37:11] out until it stands with God behind it
[1:37:13] in the spirit there's not a devil in the
[1:37:16] world can poke a doubt in there that's
[1:37:17] right he come around and say you don't
[1:37:19] feel any better your conscience has even
[1:37:21] gone to that the flu is so clear it
[1:37:23] shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a
[1:37:25] whistle glory to God it shines out
[1:37:27] certainly just as clean and clear for
[1:37:30] the word of God to work through the
[1:37:31] power of God see that's the main
[1:37:35] thing what does it say you don't feel
[1:37:38] any better what does he say hallelujah
[1:37:41] glory to God you don't feel any better
[1:37:43] you don't look any different nothing's
[1:37:46] changing glory to God hallelujah that
[1:37:48] just means it's one day closer
[1:37:51] amen so when everything is cleaned out
[1:37:53] he says when God can get a man in his
[1:37:55] hints and he gets all of these things
[1:37:57] cleaned out until it's just God standing
[1:37:58] there with his Spirit there's not a
[1:38:00] devil that can poke a doubt in there
[1:38:03] that's when you become a weapon in the
[1:38:04] hands of God Amen that's when you become
[1:38:06] a a a a devil killing tool in the hands
[1:38:10] of God in your life and in the life of
[1:38:12] others amen often he starts in you and
[1:38:14] then he starts to use that for others
[1:38:16] and you'll see people that get healing
[1:38:17] that get delivered that get all these
[1:38:19] things you what's the best person to
[1:38:21] testify of Salvation so one to just got
[1:38:23] saved isn't it the one that just got
[1:38:25] something is the one that's going to
[1:38:27] it's going to flow from them to the next
[1:38:28] one the next one and it's going to
[1:38:29] Quicken the faith and it's going to
[1:38:30] Quicken the word to those different
[1:38:32] people because they see a reality in the
[1:38:34] experience that they themselves have
[1:38:35] maybe not experienced yet amen so you
[1:38:37] become a a wrecking crew against the the
[1:38:40] powers of hell if you'll hold on Amen
[1:38:43] why because instead of fighting your own
[1:38:45] self your own senses your own Gates and
[1:38:47] your own channels in your faith it's the
[1:38:49] Holy Spirit doing the work in you and it
[1:38:51] turns this all into wug big channel for
[1:38:53] for God everything is a channel for God
[1:38:56] then
[1:38:56] amen this was sent on the group chat a
[1:38:59] while ago and it was was already in here
[1:39:02] he says who will be like David and said
[1:39:05] you stand and let that uncircumcised
[1:39:06] Philistine defy the armies of the Living
[1:39:08] God I'll go fight him amen God wants men
[1:39:11] and women this morning who can raise up
[1:39:13] and say I'll take the Lord at his word
[1:39:15] amen no matter what fails where this and
[1:39:17] that and what that one did that has
[1:39:19] nothing to do with it you SS and so
[1:39:21] forth if you're afraid of them get back
[1:39:23] you belong but God's Army is moving
[1:39:25] forward amen Men of Valor men of Faith
[1:39:28] men of power men of understanding they
[1:39:30] don't have to be smart they don't have
[1:39:32] to be educated they have to be
[1:39:36] channels they have to be channels God
[1:39:39] takes those little channels we're
[1:39:41] talking about like I said when
[1:39:42] everything here has been cleaned out
[1:39:44] scoured out by the Holy Spirit and it's
[1:39:46] full of the Holy Spirit now you've got
[1:39:47] just one big channel for the might and
[1:39:49] the power of God to move in in your life
[1:39:51] and in other people's life he says God
[1:39:53] takes those little channels what is it
[1:39:54] little Davids that'll just take him at
[1:39:56] his word and step forward and fight
[1:39:59] amen a life fully surrendered to the
[1:40:02] holy spirit is a channel for God that's
[1:40:04] what we're talking about fully
[1:40:06] surrendered cleaned out scoured out
[1:40:08] surrendered to the will of God that
[1:40:10] becomes a weapon in God's hands amen and
[1:40:13] even if you're young in the Lord all he
[1:40:15] needs is one channel cleared out when
[1:40:18] you get all of them cleared out that's
[1:40:19] great but the thing is these are this is
[1:40:20] going to be going on your entire life
[1:40:22] okay the battle doesn't happen in one
[1:40:24] day and then everything's cleared out
[1:40:25] you're going to be fighting things over
[1:40:27] and over and over again when we're
[1:40:28] reading brother braham's life story and
[1:40:29] these things how many times does you
[1:40:31] know the Holy Spirit tells him to do
[1:40:33] something he thinks it's his own
[1:40:34] thoughts he's not sure if it's God
[1:40:35] moving this that and the other thing
[1:40:37] there's doubts come in and these
[1:40:38] different things and he still got to
[1:40:40] deal with that and it's no different
[1:40:41] with us you're always going to be
[1:40:43] fighting that's right but just because
[1:40:44] you're fighting doesn't mean God isn't
[1:40:46] there the very reason you're fighting is
[1:40:49] because God is there and Satan's trying
[1:40:50] to get in on your territory again so the
[1:40:52] battle's always going to be there amen
[1:40:54] but if the holy spirit's there then
[1:40:56] Victory is imminent it's always imminent
[1:40:57] amen it's always ready to come out amen
[1:41:00] that's what we're looking for just keep
[1:41:02] those channels full of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:03] and God can use you anytime any place
[1:41:05] amen you'll still battle in certain
[1:41:07] areas until the word of God is full
[1:41:09] control of your life but that doesn't
[1:41:10] mean he can't use you man he'll take
[1:41:12] whatever portion of you that he's got
[1:41:13] full control in and he'll use it brother
[1:41:16] Bram said this he said God is calling
[1:41:17] every Seed of Abraham this morning to
[1:41:19] that same kind of Life The Great Battle
[1:41:22] is on now worldwide
[1:41:23] God wants his children separating
[1:41:25] themselves from what see taste feel
[1:41:29] smell hear imaginations conscience
[1:41:32] memories reason affections everything
[1:41:35] open up their mind and let the word come
[1:41:37] in and March with the word that's a real
[1:41:40] Soldier so we start to wind down I'm
[1:41:42] going to finish this with a a scriptural
[1:41:47] example to show how this works you say
[1:41:50] how do I get my eyes
[1:41:53] to do things that they to go against
[1:41:55] what they see if I can feel something
[1:41:58] how do I believe beyond what I can feel
[1:42:01] let's look at that Romans 4 this is
[1:42:04] speaking of
[1:42:05] Abraham it says who against hope
[1:42:08] believed in hope that he might become
[1:42:10] the father of many nations according to
[1:42:12] that which is spoken so shall thy seed
[1:42:15] be and being not weak in faith so Faith
[1:42:19] was not his weakness Faith was his
[1:42:21] strength it says he considered not his
[1:42:23] own body now dead when he was about a
[1:42:25] 100 years old neither yet the deadness
[1:42:27] of Sarah's womb so he did not reason he
[1:42:30] did not dwell on his condition he did
[1:42:32] not entertain the possibility of failure
[1:42:35] even though his body no longer
[1:42:36] functioned properly when it came to
[1:42:38] fathering a child he literally has no
[1:42:41] capability in his body to father a child
[1:42:43] and the scripture says he considered it
[1:42:47] not this is what we're talking about now
[1:42:49] this is the father of our faith and this
[1:42:51] is what we're talking about overcoming
[1:42:52] the battle of the amen taking the battle
[1:42:54] and winning the gate it says he
[1:42:56] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:42:58] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:43:01] giving glory to God now notice it was
[1:43:03] says he was strong in faith giving Glory
[1:43:06] why because he was so far gone he was so
[1:43:09] old he was so decrepit that there was no
[1:43:12] part of him that could make this happen
[1:43:14] so he's giving all the glory to God
[1:43:15] because he says Lord there's nothing
[1:43:16] that I can do to make this promise come
[1:43:18] to pass I am so far gone even though I'm
[1:43:21] not dwelling on I'm so far gone that
[1:43:23] there is definitely no part of me that's
[1:43:24] going to make this thing come to pass so
[1:43:26] he says I'm giving all the glory to you
[1:43:27] because when this happens it will only
[1:43:29] be you that does it when the doctors
[1:43:31] have thrown up their hands when the
[1:43:32] church has thrown up their hands when my
[1:43:34] family's thrown up their hands when
[1:43:36] everybody has says it can't happen yet
[1:43:38] I'm giving you glory because it's your
[1:43:40] work from start to finish anyways and I
[1:43:42] have no part in it all I'm doing is
[1:43:44] standing here and saying I believe your
[1:43:46] word and giving glory to you and that's
[1:43:48] it
[1:43:50] amen and being fully persuaded that what
[1:43:54] he had promised he was also able to
[1:43:56] perform so he gave Glory why because
[1:43:58] he's persuaded that what God told him
[1:44:00] was going to come to pass and therefore
[1:44:02] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[1:44:05] now listen to this says now it was not
[1:44:07] written for his sake alone that it was
[1:44:09] imputed to him but for us also to whom
[1:44:12] it shall be imputed if we believe on him
[1:44:16] that raised up Jesus our lord from the
[1:44:17] dead amen we have great and precious
[1:44:20] promises equally impossible as Abraham
[1:44:23] right what's
[1:44:25] yours what's your promise you're
[1:44:27] claiming equally impossible I'm
[1:44:29] sure might be 25 years might be 30
[1:44:33] years if you've got a chronic condition
[1:44:35] anything like that what they were all
[1:44:37] taking care of at Calvary it was all
[1:44:39] taken care of and when he rose from the
[1:44:41] dead now we're the ones that are going
[1:44:42] to be resurrected you talk about an
[1:44:43] impossibility we're not going to die
[1:44:45] folks but why do we give glory to God
[1:44:48] because I can't keep myself alive for a
[1:44:50] millennia but he's going to keep me
[1:44:52] alive forever I can't raise up a dead
[1:44:54] body but he's going to raise one up like
[1:44:55] his glorious body I can't do that so
[1:44:58] what do we do we say Lord we give you
[1:44:59] the glory and we give you the praise
[1:45:01] this isn't our doing this is your doing
[1:45:03] from start to finish amen so and in
[1:45:05] doing so it's imputed to us for
[1:45:07] righteousness the exact same way it was
[1:45:09] for Abraham our response to those great
[1:45:11] and precious promises our belief our
[1:45:13] expression of Faith to him is imputed to
[1:45:15] us for righteousness the same way amen
[1:45:19] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:45:21] was raised again for our justification
[1:45:25] Amen brother Bram closes with a little
[1:45:27] story and I'm going to do the same
[1:45:30] thing now listen to this closely as we
[1:45:32] close because this is going to be the
[1:45:33] attitude of the believer when it comes
[1:45:35] to every promise of
[1:45:36] God it says like a chicken in an egg
[1:45:40] what if he's afraid to peep what if he's
[1:45:43] afraid to pip the egg what if the little
[1:45:45] chicken inside the egg the little bird
[1:45:47] was afraid to hit the eggshell what if
[1:45:49] he would have heard a sound on the
[1:45:50] outside say don't hit that shell might
[1:45:53] hurt
[1:45:55] yourself how many people are telling us
[1:45:58] just deal with it it's never going to
[1:46:00] change hasn't changed yet why do you
[1:46:02] think something's going to change now in
[1:46:03] the
[1:46:04] future right listen to this but nature
[1:46:08] itself in the bird tells him peck it
[1:46:11] knock a hole in it amen when you're a
[1:46:14] born again child of God filled with the
[1:46:16] Holy Spirit what is your nature your
[1:46:19] nature is to believe the word of God
[1:46:22] your your nature is to fulfill the word
[1:46:24] of God your nature is to expect the word
[1:46:27] of God your nature is to manifest the
[1:46:30] word of God and the word has nothing the
[1:46:32] world has no idea what that nature is
[1:46:34] like and so they'll stand on the outside
[1:46:36] and they'll say don't Peck at that shell
[1:46:38] don't try and do that don't believe that
[1:46:40] don't look for that because it's
[1:46:41] silliness you need to do this this this
[1:46:43] and this anything except Peck that shell
[1:46:46] I'll help you get out
[1:46:49] right what is it the world knows nothing
[1:46:51] about the nature of God but you do
[1:46:53] because you have it inside of you amen
[1:46:56] he says let all the or organizations say
[1:46:58] days and miracles are passed you're
[1:46:59] going to hurt yourself you're going into
[1:47:01] fanaticism Peck right against the shell
[1:47:03] just as hard as you can Hallelujah Satan
[1:47:05] get away I'm coming out of here that's
[1:47:07] it I'm not laying here anymore I'm not
[1:47:09] sitting here anymore I'm not on this old
[1:47:11] Devil's Ground no more I'm pipping my
[1:47:14] way out this morning amen I'm an eagle
[1:47:16] amen hallelujah but that little old
[1:47:18] Eagle that trip Hammer neck back there

[1:47:53] set down through all those senses and
[1:47:56] consciences and things to get settled
[1:47:57] down here and that mind opens up and
[1:47:59] lets it oh God have mercy there's never
[1:48:02] nothing to bondage it again you're free
[1:48:05] he who the son has made free is out of
[1:48:07] the shell your denomination can never
[1:48:09] call you back the devil can never do
[1:48:11] anything more to you he can hiss and
[1:48:13] howl then what's he saying now he's just
[1:48:16] not talking about a new birth here he's
[1:48:18] talking about everything that comes
[1:48:19] against the believer every bondage
[1:48:20] everything that Satan tries to put on
[1:48:22] you every sickness every complex every
[1:48:25] insecurity that comes against you
[1:48:26] whatever it is that he's facing you with
[1:48:28] every single one of those things he says
[1:48:30] treat them just like you're in the shell
[1:48:32] and don't let anybody tell you you can't
[1:48:34] get out or that you have to go another
[1:48:36] way amen he's talking about anything
[1:48:38] that comes against you not just the new
[1:48:40] birth he says grab the faith that sword
[1:48:42] of the spirit thus sayeth the Lord
[1:48:44] scream hallelujah amen then cut down

[1:49:45] wife is too old he just chopped the
[1:49:47] thing out of the way the devil said you
[1:49:49] can't do this you can't do that Abraham
