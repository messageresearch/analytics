morning in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to II Peter chapter one second Peter chapter one I want to thank brother Paul for taking the Wednesday service while we were away we went to Terra Nova and went camping with the intention of rest and we went camping I don't know that we got any rest but it's always good to get away and just kind of lay down the mantle for a little bit so I appreciate that certainly want to welcome brother Gerald and sister Betty back I think they're starting to enjoy their retirement now where they don't have to be back in service and don't have to preach every time they don't have to have a cat to to luck after these things so I I just see think they're going to start really enjoying life now and they can come and go and they can get up and go down when they want so God bless you thank God for bringing you back safely but the Kings he's not here this morning but we do want to thank him for his work for cleaning the fellowship hall over the over the week and as you if you go out and see he he stripped it where is he there he is he's right in front amen sorry there he is God bless you brother Kingsley it certainly looks wonderful and I know you put a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears into it so we're thankful for that and then the the trustees and many others went in and helped paint the the fellowship Hollow over again and rearrange it and brother Joe and brother Kingsley came in on on Saturday morning to move the heavy stuff that we'd moved out last Sunday and then the others came in and did the lighter stuff so it's a body effort amen amen a body that works well works together and so I'm very appreciative for those that have done that this morning amen second Peter 1 we'll just read the first verse here Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you can have your seats this morning and as you can imagine we're continuing on our series on manifesting time and I want to take a second service on on this title of the the rape Foundation we're talking about faith this morning and as I said before we're pressing now into this message on the stature of a perfect man and we know that the basis for the Christian walk the basis for our life is always Faith amen our foundation our Anchor Point our our settled attribute of our life is always on faith and you know there's a lot of misplaced Faith going around these days you see what's going on and you see the polarization that's happening in the world and whether it's around political systems and you've got people that think that the Democrats are going to make it happen or the Republicans are going to make it happen or the liberals or the conservatives and people think well if we can just get this one in here if we can just get that one in it'll change it listen it's all under Satan's control God is the great orchestrator of all these things but these things are in Satan's hands until God redeems the Earth back to him so there's no answers coming through political parties there's no answers coming through Economic Policy there's no none of this is going to work out it's not going to work out and listen we've got people that have placed faith in their pastor and we've seen where that leads as well because the pastor doesn't stand the word stands amen we're all each one faithful we're all each one um yeah you know doing our best up here but in the end men fall men rise gifts come gifts go but the word is the thing that stands true amen people have a faith in the inherent goodness of other people and we've seen how that works out as well because there's nothing good in us our righteousness our goodness Paul said us as filthy rags there's there's nothing that we can trust unless it's the word and so when we're looking at where we place our trust we've got to see the word as our anchor the word is our basis the word is our foundation and it's our faith in that and so for the believer our faith is based on something real and it's something that is absolute and it's something that is firm and it is the word itself not just the word written not just the word spoken but it is the person of the word and we remember last service we showed that slide and we've got some issues going on this morning but we showed that slide of the word and what it was and we've got that big circle and within it we had all of those attributes because the word is the attributes of God it is the nature of God it's the characteristics of God it's the truth and the plan of God it's it's the anointing of God it's it's the personality of God it's the plan of God all these different things it's the life of God it's the light of God all of these different things is is the word and we saw what in last service we went to John 1 and we said the word was with God and the Word was God and it was all of these these ideas and Concepts but it was only that it seemed only conceptual to us as humans but there came a time where the word became a hymn and then the hymns started doing things if I could put it that way and he started the word started to have an impact on on our life and it had an impact on our world and it had an impact on the creation that he made and all of these things came and he said there came a point where that hymn became not just impactful but it became the life of men and it became the light of man amen that means the word is alive it's not just outside of us it's not just around us but now it's something that comes in and it's working and it's dealing directly with us as Believers it wasn't abstract anymore this word it wasn't just the father above us and it wasn't just God with us but now it became God in us if we could put it that way the word was progressing the revealing of the word went from above us to with us and now we're in the age where it's the word in us and we are the revealing of the word in this final time as Gentiles and since that word has been revealed everything that any believer has ever done has come through faith in that word anything that's worth talking about anything that's worth having has come through faith in that word and it was based on the revealing of the word to each person and we're going to talk about the revealing of that word and the faith that it brought this morning but every time we see it we see the word is constantly unfolding this was the slide that I was talking about this is the word and it was all those things wrapped up inside of it and it was all the word but since that time or since the beginning the word has been constantly unfolding Christ has been unfolding Christ has been revealing and it's not that he's ever contradicting himself but it's that he's opening himself up more he's showing himself up more as he goes through time so you can't rest on a message from yesterday because Christ has kept moving the word has kept revealing the word is kept unfolding and so we can't even rest on something that's come you know a hundred years ago or even 50 years ago but the word is constantly unfolding because it's life and it's light and it's wanting to reveal itself it's wanting to show himself but I want to read a quote this morning and this is a reminder of why we're not a denomination we hold the Bible as our absolute that is the word to us that is the written word it is God's God's thoughts and his words that he spoke written down for us and that's where we hold our foundation is always with the word because what happens with the denomination is God revealed himself in a way and what happened is they caught the truth but then they only stayed with that truth and they did not move on as God continued to reveal himself what they have is truth but the truth has continued to be revealed the truth is kept walking remember the word says if we walk in the light as he is in the light that means he's walking and that means he's light so you've got to stay with them otherwise you're going to be left behind and when you get left behind what are you doing you're resting on something from another day the word is continually opening the word is continually moving amen so we want to constantly be quick to hear quick to understand quick to grasp what God is doing because as he moves he's bringing a bride with him he's bringing a church out with them now listen to this quote it says this all Christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word see I can't put my faith on nothing else if I was going to put it on the church which church would I put it on Catholic Lutheran Methodist Baptist Pentecostal you said where would I put it on I don't know they all scruple everything up and everything else they twist lines and everything else what because they've stayed there and they've had to make it into something that it wasn't meant to be and they twisted up like I said last time I was talking about the Pentecostals and I was looking at even yesterday and all they want to do is get you to speak in tongues all they want you to do is do the least of the gifts and they say that's it when you got that you're done you're finished that's all you need Paul said it's the least of the gifts and they're not even doing it the way it did on the day of Pentecost because everyone's supposed to understand you as you speak if you want a gift of tongues if you want it is the original evidence that they had it was that everybody understood what they were saying not this stuff that they're talking about that's not the gift of tongues on the original day everybody heard it in the language that they understood that's the original gift but this gift of tongues to speak and unknown languages Paul said it's the least they said you can only do it a little bit in church less people come in and think we're crazy he says and then if you don't have an interpreter then just be quiet because it just brings confusion in the church but what they stayed there and God had restored it in Azusa we see that God have restored those gifts and they stayed with the gifts rather than moving into the full revealing of the word of God they took the guess but the giver was coming behind it the full revealing of the word amen we believe in the gifts we believe in the operation of the spirit we do absolutely 100 but that is not the evidence that is not the evidence of that he says he says they scruple things up and everything else twist lines and everything else but when I put my faith in his word it's anchored nobody interpret it here it is thus saith the Lord then I believe that there's the basis amen if you've got a Doctrine you want to bring to me if you've got an idea you want to bring to me you got to bring it through here first don't bring me your preacher don't bring me your profit or anything you bring it to this because this is our absolute this is where we stand amen this is the word that never fails this is the word that never fails now we read in second Peter one last Service as we mentioned the start of the stature of a perfect man and Peter never says the statue of a perfect man but Paul brings it from Ephesians 4 and he coins the phrase Paul tells us uh Peter tells us what it is but Paul's the one that mentions it and he's talking in Ephesians 4 about the fivefold ministry he says he gave some Apostles he gave some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so Paul is telling us who God gave to do the primary work of the ministry to the gospel and it's in a five-fold Ministry now listen we notice today that people will lean on one or two have you noticed that people that are drawn to prophets all they want is a prophetic Ministry but the prophetic Ministry alone won't do it or they just want their pastor and they run everything through what their pastor says but guess what that Pastor doesn't have it all either or they just want the Evangelist because the Evangelist Hypes you up and he gets you going in these different things no no we need all five we need teachers come stable anointed teachers that'll Place us solidly on the word that'll take emotion out of it but then you'll have an evangelist come in and he'll bring that emotion back into it because an emotionless marriage is no marriage at all there's no relationship if there's no emotion but the thing is if you lean towards emotion you'll never listen to the teacher and you'll be what flighty the rest of your life and if all you do is listen to that teacher you'll get cold and formal you need a pastor that'll come in and shape you that'll say the things you don't want to hear for your good even though it makes his life difficult you need a Prophet come to come and what catch the mind of God and what speak into our lives and these different things and we know those gifts exist in the body but you can't rest on any one of them but the five of them together what they produce a finished work what they all have a work to do but we need every single one of them in the body what is the work it's for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body if you want to be perfect you want to be mature you need to sit under a five-fold Ministry that's it Paul's unequivocal about it he says You must have all five you can't just pick one or two you need all five of those and the goal of the ministry is to bring us to what the unity of the faith the full maturity of the Bride him and it's too edified to build up to help develop the body of Christ around them and that is our only goal my only goal is to get you in a Rapture or get you in a resurrection if you go by way of the Grave that's my only goal and everything else falls to the side if I'm sitting here and I'm talking about me me me get me out because this is not to build me up this is not to build me up if anything this ministry will break me down frankly it will it'll break me down but if all you can hear is me talking about myself get me out in any other minister that all he can do is talk about me me I I that is not a man that you want because he's focused on himself not on you listen we are servants to Christ I am not your servant but I serve you he's my master I answered him but I serve you listen proud servants don't last long they don't last long do they what Pride goes before destruction in a haughty spirit before a fall doesn't mean I can't get up again but if I come in Pride God will knock me flat on my back he'll do it he's done it he'll continue to do it if I get raised up in any way of myself he'll knock me flat on my back because he can't work with pride humility is power with God amen amen I serve you in humility and in love to edify you to help you grow to help you mature whether you like it or not and whether I like it or not that's the way these things work how long are we going to do it for how long are you going to be a minister brother John until we all come I'm in there with you until we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now what's the effect of all this this is how you know when you're there it says that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive Peter would sum it up this way he said You shall never fall you come into the statue of a perfect man you'll never fall remember the scripture says adjustment a righteous man falls seven times but he gets up again it's not that you don't have issues it's not that you don't stumble it's not that you never break down but you keep getting up again you keep getting up because there's something inside of you that won't let you stay down it says but speaking the truth in love this is to the fivefold ministry there's our motive it's always in love the the preeminent nature of Christ the word is love everything he does is love whether it hurts or whether it feels good it is always done in love there are things that that a Ministry is going to say that are going to seem cutting and hurtful at times we say it to our kids we do it to our kids no kid enjoys a spanking it's hurtful for them but we do it for their benefit amen but we can't hold back the truth and call it love we can't hold back the truth and call it love Paul said I have not you know I'm not shunned to declare to you the full counsel of God Paul had some hard things to say Paul had them put people out of the church but he also had them bring them back when they repented what for their sake not for his sake amen the world says today as soon as you hurt me you don't love me I'm not saying it to hurt you I'm saying it to help you but that's where motive comes in that's where attitude comes in Paul will talk about he says we're supposed to be meek in these things we're supposed to be making these things what so perchance that person would hear us and come to the truth because if they don't accept the truth eventually they're lost God's only obligated to give us one opportunity but God will give it over and over again so many times but if they keep turning down the truth that they continually turn it down they're lost and so we're seeking their souls not their comfort and certainly not our comfort the hardest thing you can do sometimes is tell a person that they're lost but that's not the gospel the gospel is not your law loss the gospel is there's a way to get back there's a way to be found there's a way to make it into eternity but we're talking about faith this morning and I want to go back to the great Heroes of the faith and the the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter and I I started it last week and I want to finish it and I don't want to spend too much time on faith but I want us to look at where the start of faith is and and what it looks like this precious Faith this like Precious faith that Peter was talking about so we go to Hebrews 11 this is Paul talking about this he says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and it is the evidence of Things Not Seen so in other words when you have faith faith is as tangible to you as this you have it you may not be able to see it but you have it you can't touch it you can't feel it but yet you know it's there you can rest on it it's an assurance it's that set of feeling it's a knowledge it's a revelation that what you're believing for is what you're going to get that's what real Godly faith is amen it says and for a buy it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things that are seen were not made of those things which do appear we could spend a month on this just on that phrase there we because what when our faith is is settled it's not based on what we can see it's not based on how we feel that morning when we get up it's not based on how we feel as we're going through the day it's not based on how we feel when we go to bed at night it's not based on what we see in the mirror it's not it's not based on what the doctor tells us it's not based on what the work is telling us our colleagues none of it is based on that amen it is based on God has revealed it to me and I believe it so what he says at the beginning God made everything out of nothing God is a Creator and so circumstances have no effect on the faith of a child of God because God can create anything out of nothing and God can turn anything into anything else Jesus said listen if they would be silent when he was coming into Jerusalem he said if they would be silent he says God's able of these stones to raise up children heals the cattle on a thousand hills we don't have to worry about our employer we don't have to worry about it getting favor with this one or that one God provides us the favor God provides us with the source for every need that we have he is our source he is our Jehovah Jireh amen God speaks and things happen God declares it by his word and nothing will stop it the word is like that great Energizer Bunny come commercial they used to have and every other thing that had a battery and it would fall by the wayside but they had that that bunny rabbit that was just going and banging the drum with the Energizer batteries in it why everything else failed but Energizer the word is the Energizer amen it does not stop it does not sleep it does not need to rest it goes and it goes and goes until it produces what it said it was going to do amen but then we jump to verse six and it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him we're talking about faith as the foundation of a Christian walk and Paul would go so far as to say is if you don't have faith you can't please God in other words you're not acceptable to God and we'll see this as we go into the scriptures amen face the starting point but Faith takes you somewhere Faith puts you into action Faith changes you amen it's not dormant but faith is active it has an ingredient to it that causes it to do things amen it has purpose and intent in itself remember we preached about a seed and everything that you are going to get out of a seed is in the seed at the beginning and the first thing that comes out of a Believer is faith and it's faith in the word of God it's faith in the finished work of Calvary it's faith in what God has revealed to you now we spoke how Paul said last service in First Corinthians he said for no other Foundation can no for no other Foundation can no man lay then that which is laid which is Jesus Christ what the word our foundation is Christ's the word and it's the Cornerstone of our faith and Peter had the greatest Revelation which is Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and that's the Cornerstone under the New Covenant but we see if we go all the way back into Hebrews 11 that they had what a different revelation of who Christ was all throughout and it was him revealing his Plan of Redemption it was him revealing the the power and the the intention behind his word because Christ was not revealed to Abel the way he was to Peter Noah did not have a revelation of Christ the way that Peter did and yet the word was being revealed Christ was being revealed through all of these different things and he's been revealing himself all through the last six thousand years so if we look at Hebrews 11 it says this by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now listen to this he says when Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and God Vindicated Abel by coming down and receiving a sacrifice it caused jealousy with Cain because he was jealous of his brother and slew his brother it started at the beginning that when the natural and the spiritual you've got two lineages here you've got a spiritual line and you've got a natural line he says you have both Cain and Abel worshiped the same God we like to draw a big distinction between children of God and children that are not of God but yet we look here and we see that they both worshiped the same God worship is not what defines you as a Christian it is a part of being a Christian but saying I worship God does not make you Christian because Cain comes with worship to God it says they both built the same kind of altars they both worshiped the same God at the church same church at the same altar among the greatest demonic spirit is a religious spirit and that's what we're fighting in laodicea it's a religious spirit that makes you think because of what you do just like every other believer that's what makes you a Believer no what makes you a Believer is the Holy Ghost inside of you and that is the only thing that makes you a Believer because you can't even call Jesus Christ Christ without the Holy Ghost inside of you you can't truly understand what it means to be anointed until you yourself have been anointed amen what is the differentiation between a child of God and a child that's not of God the true revelation of the word not worship not the church you attend but what is the word doing in your life it'll be a true revelation it says but Cain by carnal reasoning brought in the fruits of the land and laid them upon the altars of sacrifice thinking that surely that this would answer God for an atonement oh they're coming not just to worship but they're coming with intention they're coming with an atonement they're trying to cover themselves they're trying to make themselves acceptable in the presence of God so he must have brought in as people think today apples that Adam and Eve took that caused a sin he says but Abel had the right sacrifice he knew that it was blood that did it so he brought a lamb and God received his act sacrifice he says now Abel by Faith by Revelation no other way there was no Bible written so you see the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth and the entire Church of the Living God is built upon that notice he says no Bible Abel didn't have a Bible and until Moses comes there is no scriptures all there is is God dealing with people and whether he talked to them by Dream by Vision an audible voice an unction in their heart whatever it might be that was the word to those people and so Abel had something and he was trying to come back into fellowship with God he was trying to get restoration to what to have a relationship again he wanted to be able to talk to God he wanted God to be able to talk back to him he wanted to be accepted back in the presence of God because everybody's trying to get back to Eden everyone wants to get back to what they know they lost and so Abel comes and he comes by Revelation it says he had to bring blood God had chosen blood as the original covering Abel came with the exact same thing that God did but Cain on the other hand was bringing the fruits of the land now I'm not going to go into original sin but if you think that the original sin was an apple or any fruit then we're sorely mistaken why would an apple cause them to be aware of and ashamed of their nakedness and someone said if apples make us aware and ashamed of our nakedness we need to pass the apples because nobody's aware of it and nobody's ashamed of it anymore why did they cover their nakedness if the mouth is what it caused them to sin it makes no sense amen but Abel brings the right sacrifice and God Scripture says God had respect unto it now it doesn't say specifically what that means but if we go to the Mount Carmel Showdown with Elijah God showed acceptance of a Sacrifice by what fire he consumed the Sacrifice from fire from heaven and we know it was a type of the Holy Ghost today wherever you come and you lay your sacrifice you die out you lay yourself on the word you take God at his word Holy Ghost fire comes down and it cleanses you and it makes you what fit for service for God amen God consumed Abel's offering by fire and Cain was left with the most beautiful Altar and the most beautiful offering unconsumed he worshiped he prayed he offered it to God and God didn't even recognize it God didn't even recognize it why Cain had no revelation now this is just me but sometimes I think Cain understood but if Cain acknowledged what that original sin was Cain would have had to recognize who he was as well listen Cain is not listed in any genealogy of Adam why Original Sin Cain had to recognize what and who he was to make the right sacrifice because remember God came down to him scripture says Cain was of that Wicked one doesn't say he was of Adam in fact he's never listed says he was of that Wicked one amen but Hebrews 11 says April's basis for sacrifice was faith and what is faith we said it before faith is a revelation of the will or the word of God and it's not just a revelation you receive but it's a revelation you act on if it only stays in our head you know what that does it condemns Us in the end if we have Revelation but we don't act on it then it condemns us because we did not respond to what God gave us we've got to act on what God gives us amen but what happens is as soon as you take that Revelation and you act on it it changes you it puts you into action it puts you on a path towards God and it puts you on the path with God because God is trying to restore us back to that Eden condition it puts you in a place where God can bless you it puts you in a place where God can work with you Abel's Faith didn't get him back to Eden but it got all of humanity started back towards Eden what was it it was the starting of the revelation of the word and that Revelation had to come from what is the problem itself if you don't understand original sin you don't understand why Jesus had to be born by a virgin you want to understand you won't understand why it has to be blood you don't understand why it has to be a lamb you don't understand that the fact that I'm standing here today born of a woman means that I am in sin if you don't understand the original sin what was it it was the revealing of the word and it starts with trying to make you acceptable and able sacrifice made him acceptable amen God told Cain if he'd do the same thing he says if thou do us the same thing will thou not also be accepted and Cain refused to do it why because there was nothing in him to respond to the revealing of the word he couldn't do it he just wouldn't do it but Abel's Faith brought him back into relationship with God we read read this quote it says the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth what the beginning God had to reveal himself to Abel God had to reveal what was going on and God had to reveal a path to get back into his presence through Abel and then Abel had to what act on it we have the word today Abel didn't have this Abel didn't have 66 books to go and say this is the way back all he had was a revelation of what God had done and what God was going to do God had promised I'm going to bruise the Serpent's head and he gave no explanation and it started with an atonement it started with an atonement so that God would work with his sons and daughters as he was going through amen but in the early days before Moses nothing was written and so we see Abel and we see Noah and we see Abraham and all these different ones and they don't have a word to go back to but God comes down and again we only know some of them how it actually worked but God will reveal something to them and they would change their entire life around that one moment with God what are we to do if one moment with God would change their life and cause them to go and do the things they did what ought we to do as we sit and we have 66 books a thousand plus pages of God's talking to us of God talking to us what are it to do but it says the beginning of righteousness what is righteousness to do the will of God that's what righteousness is Amen to be found pleasing to God why because you're in his purpose you're in his plan in his timing with his motive and his objective you're stepping literally right into the word of God that's what righteousness is is when you step into the word how by faith by faith your faith in the word of God to act on the word of God to live by the revelation of God is righteousness but it's his righteousness because it's not you that decides it it's not you that comes up with how you're going to do or what you're going to do or when you're going to do but it's God opening himself up to you and he gives you the Revelation and behind that comes Faith to put you into action to do what God wants you to do it's a work of Grace from start to finish that he's even talking to us that he's even open to us in these things but we see these things these actions of great faith in the scriptures long before the word was ever written down and yet God would speak to men and women and they would respond in perfect obedience eventually and God would produce the word exactly in their lives amen we look at the next one we look at Enoch it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death but was and was not found because God had translated him but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God he says now but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now we're in the age of resurrection and Rapture now this is this is it this is the final age it's the seventh Church agents the laodicean church age this is the rapture and Resurrection season it's the declared end of the Gentile plan of God Amen and that ends with a resurrection and a Rapture before tribulation comes our way but notice the Enoch he experienced the Rapture before we ever did and if you notice Enoch is the seventh from Adam and what is it it was a type of the seventh Church age it was the type of the Bride that goes before tribulation ever comes and it was God showing us that what was going to happen but Enoch walked for 500 years with God and then he took a Rapture and you say brother John how are we going to do it maybe the best of us will be here 70 or 80 years how are we going to achieve in 70 or 80 years when Enoch took 500 years to achieve or under an anointing worrying the word of God to go in this that's how we're going to do it is because this is the time this is the season this is the anointing that's on the bride it's an eagle anointing that lifts us up above the trouble rather than making us have courage to go through it amen we hold to the word and we're in expectation but the anointing of the church is to go up not to go through right our tribulations right now our testing our trial is right now and that's Faith to take us through here until he takes us up and out of these things but if you want to know what a Rapture Ready Church looks like we look at Enoch for a bit amen if we want rap stream Faith let's look at Enoch's walk because Enoch dedicated his life to Walking with God for 500 years Church 500 years and he never had a Rapture until he had a rapture I don't know what was going through Enoch's mind I don't know if Enoch had this Revelation that I'm gonna go in a Rapture but Enoch the scripture says he walked with God he didn't just walk in the morning he didn't just walk in the afternoon but day after day after day Enoch walked with God morning noon and night Enoch dedicated his life to Walking with God and it was by faith by Faith by a revelation that God wanted to be spending time with him what Abel had showed him how to be accepted and under that acceptance comes what the ability to go into the presence of God and so Enoch says if there's a way made I'm going to walk in the way that's made if I'm accepted now under the blood of a shed lamb then I'm shed blood of a lamb then I'm going to go in and I'm going to take full advantage of that revealing of that word and I'm going to take it and go on to the next step as soon as you're accepted you've got access to that amen but Enoch I believe he had like that one of Abraham the revelation of Abraham that were pilgrims and strangers that ought to be in our hearts today that Enoch recognized that I'm not of this world and we ought to be looking and saying this world has nothing for me absolutely nothing there's nothing that I can identify with in this world you walk around I was driving with my wife yesterday and you see the the state of undress you see the nature you see the idiocy the insanity of what's going on in this world and you say this cannot be my home I don't identify with it I don't like it all I want to do is get out and I believe Enoch came to the place where he put everything he had into getting out and the world wasn't even as bad as it was yet but yet he said I can't do it but his Rapture Revelation Enoch's Faith said God is pleased with me he walked with God and God kept coming back to him and God kept walking with him and talking with him and that came to the point where Enoch said God is pleased with me now let me say it again we're nothing I'm nothing you're nothing but God has already said I'm going to have a bride that is spotless she's dressed in white she's without spot she's without wrinkles she's acceptable she's the apple of my eye he's already declared it and because we're accepted in his sight now we can come in and we can have the same Rapture Ready what Revelation that Enoch did I please him I please him but I've got to be walking by faith to do it what pleases God when we obey his word when we take him at his word simple faith in the word of God is what pleases him we saw it with Saul so many times was he go in and he would make a sacrifice to God and God Samuel said to him God doesn't want your sacrifices Saul he just wants you to do what he said don't go with the grand gesture we love grand gestures as humans because we think it makes us more acceptable or God likes us better with the grand gesture and all God wants us to do is just take him at his word it's so simple take him at his word walk with God trust him to do what he said he's going to do we've been given a Bible that's full of stories and history has proven it you know they thought for so long I've shared this they thought for so long that Jericho wasn't real and then finally they dug down far enough and they found exactly what happened to Jericho and it matches exactly what the scripture says they couldn't find evidence for King David and all of a sudden they're starting to find evidence for King David you think that would you think that would be an easy one King David I mean he's he he's the Cornerstone King of the Jews you'd think there'd be tons of that but no there was nothing but now they're starting to find it what they're finding proves the history of the scriptures but by faith we hopefully have already received it and so we know that what he's done shows that what he's going to do is going to happen that what he said he's going to do is going to happen amen we have everything in here we have encouragement we have correction we have direction we have anointing we have praise worship all these things in there everything that we have need of and so all we have to do is take it and say I'll walk with this I'll take this I'll take it I shared that quote you know brother Brown would talk about he say you know I like to look around the things that I own we read the word and we see the things that he's offered to us you start walking in that and you watch what God starts doing in your life look at Noah it says by faith Noah being warned of God of things has not yet not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness with which is by faith God just takes one scripture here to summarize the entire thing that Noah did in his life and God warns Noah by revealing the time that he's in the season that he's in and what God's going to do in it and it's a revelation of God nobody else get this gets this revelation God comes and talks to one man and everybody else has to hear what that man says God doesn't come to the entire population one by one and say I'm going to destroy the Earth he comes to one man and he lets that man's actions and response to that Revelation let people know how much he really believes it it wasn't just words but no one now the scripture says that he moved he moved with fear the revelation of what God was going to do moved him and it caused him to change his entire focus in his life and he started building an ark and he built and he built and he built and he let nothing distract him every minute amen we need to be moving under the inspiration of the word not sitting back well what God's going to do is what God's going to do and I'm a child of his he's going to take it no he's provided a way for you by the word of God he's revealed his word he's opened his word and he's asking you to just step into it to follow it to obey these things amen we need to be moving under this understanding the revelation of the word for this age it's a rapturing word that's what God's trying to get us to we're at a time where fire is coming not water there's no getting away from it this time the whole thing's going to burn up amen we ought to be moving what did Noah's fate do it moved him with fear to do what prepare an ark to follow God's provided way to get out of things amen and what did he do he convinced his family he convinced his family he was concerned he knew he believed that God was going to destroy the Earth by water and so he convinced them to join him in the ark no easy thing maybe after the first year it wasn't so bad but when you're going for decades decades building this stupid Ark I imagine they started calling it that after a while you know just so annoying the day in the day out why do we have to do this why does it have to be so big why does it have to be with this type of wood we have to do every every scene my brother was just that they've got that Noah's Ark down in the States you look at it it is huge can you imagine being the one that had to go and put the pitch in every single line every single seam every single crack you're the tar guy for the next 10 years what are you doing today pitch in the cracks what are you doing tomorrow pitch in the cracks what are you doing the day after next month next year I'm gonna be putting pitch in the cracks praise the Lord Sometimes It's a Grind it ain't always easy I was talking brother Paul you know he had took service on Wednesday then he had Sunday school this morning which brother Joe thankfully took from and then he's got youth group it ain't always fun to sit there and study and study and pray and prepare and prepare It Ain't Easy Being a mother is it day in day out no breaks serving and then you serve on top of that with the local body it's not easy is it brother Josh get pressure to come up and find the will of the Lord for a service to sing and worship in these things sometimes it's just pitch after pitch after pitch day in and day out fill in the cracks but they had to do it because that was God's design they had to take him at his word and they had to go through the heavy times so that they could actually float when it all came down amen didn't matter what they said listen if you really believe would you believe it'll show in your life it'll show in the way you live day to day Noah's life showed that he believed that there was water coming because he followed God to the letter and built the exact design of a boat that God did they had said there's never been rain the meteorologists of that day remember all that came was a mist from the earth they had never had rain come from the sky and the Judgment that Noah's talking about has never happened before they were smart people back then they said there's nothing up there nothing to come down it's all bogus science has proved it our instruments can't measure anything up there there's no moisture in the atmosphere Noah what are you talking about it's gonna rain It's Gonna Rain get in help me build this and only ate God in and even one of them was not a real believer but he believed enough to get out he says this you've got to First find the will of God remember last service I said that means that our Focus not ought to be on do we believe it's do we have the will of God to believe in we'd spend as much time seeking as we did believing then we'd get a lot more of what we believe for because we take the time to find out what God's will is amen he says and then if you really have received the seed in your heart then you can be persistent there's nothing going to move you no matter what wisdom man tries to say it's not so and it's not this and that and the other it doesn't move you one iota because you know what the will of God is he spoke it into your heart your faith sits there and it'll hold right on no matter if there's no more than like a grain of mustard seed it'll bring you right out to the place the will of God little Mustard Seed of Faith you hold it there it'll bring you to the place where it puts you right into the will of God the purpose of God the word of God the manifestation of what that Faith was for in the first place what does our life declare this morning we're looking at Noah his life declared there's judgment coming and there's a way out what's our life declaring this morning look at your life how do you spend your time how do you talk with people what's your focus in life that'll tell you what you really believe is it on getting comfortable or is it on getting out what are we building and are we building it with enough purpose that somebody can look at it and say he's got something she's got something she's convinced he knows something I don't know what is it and why is he living the way he's living why is he doing things the way he's doing it's because I believe there's a Rapture and a Resurrection coming before tribulation hits Noah acted on his Revelation it says he became heir of the righteousness which is by faith Noah's actions Noah's faith in the word of God made him act on the word of God and by that he received the righteousness of God by faith then we go to Abraham it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should hear he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went we read about we've read about Abraham the Book of Genesis and we see the great detail that God did there but when you look at the starting point God literally just comes to Abraham and he gives him this big heavy command look at what God says let's go back to the original in Genesis it says now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee That's Heavy that is a total separation and you'll see it time and time again in the word that God's word calls for what a total separation from unbelief God didn't call Abram's family God called Abraham God didn't call lot God called Abraham he said Abraham get away from all of them why because there'll be a ball and chain on you the rest of your life if you don't separate now I'm taking you I'm going to do something with you it's for you it's not for them so you've got to get away from them that means what we can't walk in the call of somebody else I can't be walking because brother Mark and sister Maureen or brother Gerald and sister Betty or brother Bob and sister Brenda have gone before me that's an inspiration but that can't be my call because what's going to happen is they're going to come a challenge to that call at some point and I'm not going to have the Revelation that they had which is that God called me out God made me separate God made me go where I am God made me do what I'm doing amen what you'll come to friction eventually if I'm walking in your call it'll come to friction it'll come to fussing we'll come to a junction and what will happen is we'll split off because my call is not your call and I'll end up going the way that lot did amen we've got to have our own call we've got to have our own experience with Christ listen to this he says in Abraham one day when he was perhaps out in the field hunting or whatever he was doing picking berries or whatever his job might have been he met God and from that time he was changed he could call things that were not as though they were because he had met God he knew the minute and the hour that he met God let me ask you this do you know when you met God because the the word is not just here the word is a person and you've got to have a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you the the the the Living Word to you the person of the word has to be it is not in Doctrine it is not in going to church but it's when the person of Christ comes down and speaks to you I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord I've said it many times before I didn't want to get saved but yet there was something drawing me to give my heart to the Lord for many many years but the night I gave my heart to the Lord was when he spoke to me personally personally and I knew he was talking to me and no one else because what it was personal to me it was so specific to me that it could mean nobody else that's how I knew he was calling me and that's where my anchor is is that he personally met me and called me so it didn't matter if brother Gerald stayed or went didn't matter if my mom went to a state or wait didn't matter what my dad did didn't matter what people around me did didn't matter people left people came in up and down in and out had nothing to do with it because he called me and that's what I rest in is I met him personally that night and he's never left me since that's where I rest amen you need to know the day and the hour that you met God personally he says it changed him and God called him to be the father of many nations he believed God and he believed his promise because he had met God 25 years later they were discussed discussing trying to discuss him tell him that he had believed something was wrong but the Bible said he got stronger all the time giving praise to God that because he knew that God had to keep the promise he says and when man meets God it changes his makeup it gives him a super sense as I was speaking the other night the natural man only has the five senses but the believer when he meets God he gets something different it's a super sense that lifts him up above the Shadows it makes him believe things that are impossible to come to pass have you believed that which is impossible you're sitting here that's impossible you're staying here that's impossible you're pressing on that's impossible when we look at the rest of this world he says it makes him believe things that are impossible to come to pass he still believes they will come to pass because God said so when a man meets God he says something takes place God told Abraham get out leave it all drop it dump it didn't say get your best price for your business we don't know what Abraham had or did maybe had a successful business maybe you had a ranch maybe had a farm maybe he was a Tradesman of some sort we don't know we know he left with something because God blessed it but God said separated out get out leave it behind and get moving because I've got something I want to do for you amen we don't know what Abraham had heard before that we don't know that Abraham had a relationship with God of any sort all we know is there came a time and God chose it and he said I'm going to do something with you Abraham literally plucked him out of the crowd and said this is my man this is my Prophet this is my child and then he started revealing himself to him but watch what he said he says and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him now you notice here Abraham's part of this Covenant is nowhere because remember God had given them a two-sided Covenant in Egypt in Eden and they broke it and so God knew he can't give a two-sided Covenant anymore so now he gives a one-sided Covenant and this is to Abraham and this is to Abraham's Royal seed this is the lineage of Faith he says I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it Abraham has no part in this he says I'll make you a great nation all bless thee I'll make your name great I'll make you a blessing I'll bless him that bless you curse him and curse of you I will I will I will I will where's Abraham in all of this Abraham only has one thing to do have faith and act that's all he's got to do now you know the scripture says God had told Abraham that means there was a period of time before God said it and Abraham did it and then he goes out and Abraham doesn't do what God tells him to do you notice that he takes a lot with him God said separate from all your family and we don't know why he took law maybe lot was was you know he had lost his parents or something so maybe he did it out of out of a sense of obligation or maybe emotion whatever it might be but until lot Got Away God couldn't even confirm the Covenant but it's still a one-sided Covenant what was he doing he had to bring Abraham to a place where Abraham would step into the Covenant that's all where Abraham would completely obey the word of God and he never got that full Covenant God never talked to him again until Abraham comes out and separates from lot but you know how God did it he blessed them so much that it caused friction you know they say there can't be two sheriffs in the town listen you're his child God takes care of you God meet your needs he's Jehovah Jireh but he blessed them so much that the two of them couldn't be in the same place at the same time notice Abraham and lot never had issues with each other but the people that were backed up behind him had issues Abraham and lot had a good relationship and they resolved it amicably in the end but the servants the people underneath them couldn't get along because they were too busy fighting for their masters rather than trying to see the big picture and God used His blessings to bring friction to cause a separation God's Got You but he doesn't care if we got out of here rich or poor middle class what he cares about is getting us into the Covenant so he got Abraham to a place where Abraham willingly separated where life was so difficult even with his great blessings that he says listen we got to make a change here so a lot you pick first that's how you know you're a child of God you give the other person the opportunity you go the way you want to go I'll take what's left why because he had the Covenant to fall back on he believed the Covenant lot had nothing it's a lot needed to go where it was good Abraham knew the Covenant would make wherever he went good God was bringing Abraham to Abram to that place of total obedience amen it was unconditional the work was going to be Gods but Abraham had to step into that Covenant it's waiting there this is waiting here it's unconditional God's just asking you step into it separate separate from unbelief step in in faith and see what he'll do and Abraham did the same thing that Enoch did he walked with God but we look in Genesis and we see it Through The Eyes of a of an imperfect atonement and he had his ups and downs he had his ins and outs he didn't always stay in the land but he kept coming back to the promise and the scripture testifies that he what he continued to get stronger in faith calling those things that were not as though they were why he had a revelation of the word to him that God had given him personally but watch how it can how it continues this morning he says by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles that means tense with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is god listen I just spent three days in a tent it's no way to live it's no way to live it's no wonder they wanted a city which had foundations but they were in obedience as long as they were what walking in the land that God had given to him it says through faith also Sarah herself now we're switching from Abram to Sarah that said by faith for everyone else with Sarah says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as did as many as the stars of the skies in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable that through the lens of the perfect sacrifice Christ Jesus we see a very different picture of Sarah compared to what we see in Genesis under the blood of bulls and goats we see a very imperfect woman we see a very imperfect man in Abraham but now as he's writing this from the what looking through the blood of Christ all we see from Sarah's faith that's all we see that's all he sees with us the same cover the blood covers the sin and what he sees is the faith that comes out and steps into the word that's the effect of the New Covenant the Grace Covenant amen but the scripture says through faith Sarah receives strength Faith was a vehicle Faith was a carrier for the strength that came to cause her to be able to conceive seed and I don't want to get into this too heavily this morning because this is really the where we're going to go for the next Services we talk about virtue but notice that Sarah's Faith was that she judged God to be faithful her faith said you're faithful she believed that he would do it and though she tried in many different ways she still believed that he was going to do it one way or the other amen her faith was that she would do what he said he would do notice God never had a conversation with Sarah God talked to Abraham God came to Abraham God gave his Covenant to Abraham God gave visions and dreams to Abraham Gall of God's conversations God's covenant God's promise was through her headship Sarah never got a word directly from the Lord she had to hear it all secondhand but she still have faith because she received it from the one that received it she believed it in the one that have received it amen God gave Abraham the Covenant sign before Isaac ever came along she had no Covenant sign she had nothing it was all through Abraham Sarah was just along for the ride but she had faith she had faith in these things but what there came a day when the Lord himself dropped down in flesh and he came to visit Abraham and notice he still isn't talking to Sarah 's in the tent she's not sitting out there with Abram and these three men that are there but the promise was to Abraham but Sarah receives it through faith because what she's a part of Abraham the covenants to Abraham but the manifestations through Sarah we're a part of Christ promises through him the manifestations through us it's just a type of what he's doing today God himself comes down to Abraham to talk to him for 24 Years brother hammermeister said remember that God talked to Abraham if you read everything God said to Abraham it took about eight minutes so Abraham walked for 24 years on eight minutes of conversation with god and there were many years where God didn't do anything with him but he's been what dirty Dusty living in tents right tents are no fun they're not sound proof they're not dirt proof they're not bug proof and after a while they're not waterproof things come and go smells come and go it just ain't the same as a house that's built on foundations and Sarah was dragged through that for 24 years if you like a clean house a tent is not for you if you like being separated from the elements a tent is not for you if you like privacy intent is not for you if you like decorations a tent is not for you but she had been doing it for 24 years and God himself comes down now you say that wasn't God's scripture says this it says the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day it says this the angel came to Abraham in the form of a man and Abraham spiritually recognized him and he sat down with his back to the tent and Abraham fed him and he said Abraham I'm going to visit you about the time of life Abraham was a hundred Sarah was 90. they've been looking for that promise for years and years and years and years though we Terry he's not going to tarry forever he says them who are looking for the coming of the Lord is watching every move blessed be the name of the lord they're watching for something to take place just like a piece of metal to a magnet they're watching for it to take place Abraham was looking for it that promise that God had made this scripture we read on Sarah I think it's one of the greatest scriptures for the Bride of this age because the question is how is he going to do it when there's nothing in us to do it when we are incapable of it ourselves when we're past time past due it's gone on so long it's It seems impossible but yet he comes and he personally confirms the promise to Abraham and it's going to come all the way through Sarah but what this this scene that we have on the plains of memory it shows us three things for the bride it shows us the sign of God it shows us the faithfulness of God and it shows the impact of the personal presence of God and that's all three things that had to happen in this age he had to come down he had to remind us of his word he had to make himself known and it was him personally because remember he said I'm going to visit you he didn't say something's going to happen he says I'm going to be there it's going to be me that does it it's going to me that does the work amen they've been slogging along for 24 years watching waiting watching waiting disappointment trying this trying that in and out up and down 24 years not a single change in fact things had gotten worse had him held they'd gotten worse they gotten old they got wrinkled and then and not a single movement towards the fulfilling of the word promise they'd had nothing happening but there came a day where God dropped down the word came down the one that had said it came down and Abraham recognized him I've always marveled at that that Abraham recognized him he saw three and he called one he said Lord and he spoke to one he spoke to one he knew which one it was this is just me but Abraham had met him before he knew the way he walked he knew the way he talked he knew the things he said and when he saw them I believe something triggered it and spiritually he recognized this is the physical of the spiritual that I've been experiencing all along you walk around the word long enough you'll recognize the word when it comes your way amen because we don't get Christ walking amongst us in flesh the way that he did two thousand years ago but you'll see the word walking and Believers you'll see the word walking in ministries and it's not the fullness but you'll see a portion and you recognize it because what you've met the person of this word and it matches up and you say there's the word there's the word there's the word and you realize God's moving something's happening amen the word said Paul said we are the Epistles seen a red of all men people say where is Christ today it's in the believer by the Holy Ghost they're looking at us that's why I'm saying what is our what are we building what is our Focus today and can people see that it's serious enough for us that they ought to be serious about it as well we've dedicated Our Lives I believe it I'm not trying to harangue you this morning but I'm saying where are we at can people look and say they know judgment's coming but they also know Christ is alive and well that he's the same yesterday today and forever and there's a remedy there's a way to get out it says in the time Drew nearer and a man came up it wasn't a man it was an angel and the angel was none other than almighty God manifested in a man now listen you Bible readers Abraham called his name Lord take that Lord and see whether it was Elohim the almighty Jehovah dressed in a man's clothes and sat down with his back to the tent he said I'm personal pronoun I'm going to visit you about the time of life for Sarah and she's 90 years old even in this conversation God is not talking to Sarah directly she's sitting there eavesdropping like any good wife she's interested in the things of God she's hanging on to every word she knows he's special but something in her had her holding on and listening in but he's still not talking to her tents aren't very soundproof like I said earlier she can hear the entire conversation I'm sure she made sure to move over to the side closest to that conversation and started making her food right there she wanted to know what was up 99 she was 90 years old 89 years old there's got to be a time maybe this is the time I think Faith and Hope brought her over to that corner so she could hear those things amen Abraham was the called out one Sarah went along because she was married to him she's the beneficiary of the Covenant it's not to her but because she's a part of Abraham she gets to be a part of it amen Abraham received the promise Sarah fulfilled the promise you ever see that she fulfills it promises through Christ but the manifestation is through the bride today and it's because we're a part of him remember the prophet would say he said that she should have been struck dead when she doubted when she laughed in her heart and he called her out he said why did Sarah lie she should have been struck dead but because she was a part of Abraham she had to be saved that's no different with the bride sometimes we don't believe we say our mouth and with our mind we believe but our actions say we don't but he can't strike us because we're under the blood and we're a part of the Covenant through Christ and we're part of the same Royal seed they both needed a body change Abraham needed it as well as Sarah did but you'll see serenita more than Abraham did Sarah needed more than Abraham didn't we'll get into that a bit but that Faith was the vehicle that brought strength Faith was a means to the end it was the anchor it was the foundation it was the resting place but it took a personal revealing of God to her for that body change to take place that was in her amen amen if the musicians would come what are we talking about we're talking about faith in a word that God reveals to you not a new word but they were starting where no word was given and they had to walk so completely by faith but we have a more sure word of Prophecy we have this all laid out for us we've got a path we've got a plan we've got everything we need laid out for us our faith is way different than theirs and that we don't have to say is that God or is that this or that you know is that just a voice am I just a schizophrenic or bipolar or any of these different things but we know it's Christ the word that's speaking to us because it matches up with what he's told us before amen but they never had a fullness Abel had the start of righteousness that through the sacrifice of a of an innocent animal you can be accepted but it wasn't a restoration to Eden then Enoch comes along and he gets go to go in a Rapture but he doesn't go through the things that we have to go through he's not in the last stage he's not in a restoration he walks up he's a type of the Bride that goes through Noah has a revelation that there's a way of Escape but it didn't take him back to Eden Abraham has a revelation that there's going to come a serpent bruising man and he's the start of it but he never gets to finish it remember Hebrews 11 says these all they didn't get the promise they got a portion but they didn't receive the promise which is what the word made flesh in them the Holy Ghost the New Birth the promise of God coming Upon Us amen what was it it was God showing I've got a plan and I've got a way to do it but it's got to roll up into something it's got to roll up into a bride it's got to roll up into a bride that's ready to come back to Eden and a bride that walks completely by faith in the fully revealed word they only had a portion but they walked fully in the portion they had that's why when you talk to somebody from a denomination don't put them down they're walking if they're walking fully in the Revelation they have praise the Lord but let them see there's more let them see there's more but don't put them down they're faithful to what they've seen just pray that God opens their eyes and keeps them moving along that's all we're looking for in those things amen but in every one of these instances where that Faith come from a personal revealing of Christ to that person the word coming down and putting something in their heart that kept them going forward they gave them a direction that gave them purpose that gave them Focus that gave them energy they gave them strength that gave them something to hold them through 24 years of Dusty dirty tent living that walk through around in the desert for 40 years with Moses that walked with God for 500 years that held on for four thousand years until Christ came what was it it was God revealing himself and they were standing in faith on the portions as he opened it up but now we've got the whole thing now we've got the whole thing and if we've got the whole thing that means the plan is ready to be rolled up starts with faith but we've got to add to that faith we've got to have strength we've got to have knowledge we've got to have all these other different things amen let's stand if we would this morning I said it last service I'll say it again this is not a flat plane that we build and we look at that pyramid but it's it's a continuous growing you have faith to believe you have faith to believe in the finished work of Calvary that's a starting place but the word is greater than that because Hebrews 13 8 says he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever where's the word today what's it doing today our faith has to grow from just that faith in Calvary it's got to move into what Greater Works than this show you do it's got to be the living manifestation of that bride so our faith grows and as it does we add in virtue and those different things like I said before it's it's like the rings of a tree so I don't sit here and say I've got it all I've got faith and then I've got virtue and so I've only got a few more things to go in there I'm done no no no the whole thing is being built up the whole thing is growing together the whole thing is producing Christ the word in my life and in your life so don't stop don't stop don't say I've got it you know I was I was picking blueberries yesterday and I had on polarized glasses and let me say this those glasses were not made for blueberry picking because what happens is they turn the blue nearly the same shade as the Green so I'm walking up the road to pick blueberries there's a reason for this okay and a man calls out he says hey I thought it was a Believer I thought oh Matt's here and Amber you know somebody else oh get some fellowship in no no it's just a stranger he said come up here I'm nearly done he says there's tons of blueberries up here but I'm full he says I'm ready to go you come up and take over I said okay I walked up I couldn't see blueberries anywhere couldn't see a blueberry I like gee thanks you know call me up waste my time so it took me like almost two hours to pick the first gallon but I did find places where I could see there were blueberries and so I finally started getting picking them anyways I picked more or less my first gallon I'm walking down to where I picked the last time last year I'm looking around like where are the blueberries anyways I was sweating and I was leaning over to pick up a blueberry and a drop of sweat hit my glasses and so it was blurring them so I took off and the blueberries appeared and I said what have I been missing all along the blueberries were there but the filter I had on would not allow me to see all the blueberries that were there we come in with a filter I've got it I'm here it's a finished work I know everything I've got the full revelation of the word I've received an end time message I'm going in a Rapture I'm a member of the bride and we put a filter on and it stops our growth it stops us from seeing what the word really has there I I I was shaking my head thinking how much did I miss behind me because I had those stupid polarized glasses on and if I'd have just taken them off and use what God had given me I'd have seen there were blueberries everywhere and the second bucket was better than the first bucket and I picked it twice as fast because all of a sudden I could see blueberries see all I was looking for was shape but not color the color was blending in but as soon as I took those glasses off blueberries appeared everywhere and you know what I started picking normally I'm good for a gal and I said there's enough blueberries here to get two I didn't quite make it but it went so fast and so easy I said how could I have been so silly had the wrong filters on I just let God do the work use what he gave me not try and add to it not try and take away from it not saying stand still in some idea or some Dogma or some Doctrine or some pride in what I am or who I have I was literally this is even funnier I went through areas where I could see footprints and they walk past monster Blu-rays I said what kind of blueberry picker went past these berries but you know what there was somebody coming behind me no doubt a few hours later said what kind of idiot walks past all of these blueberries I can see he went by them why didn't he pick them and then get the beam out of my own eye I'm saying sometimes we're looking and we think we're so far ahead we've got it all we've figured it out no no no till we're wraps you're ready there's stuff still there for us amen and then let's not put a filter on that just because of what we have we're there we don't have it until we can live it we don't have it till we can live it we can have a conceptual idea we can have an intellectual Revelation but until we're living it I say we've got a filter in our life a holy man's filter is what the word of God anointed by the Holy Spirit amen I appreciate our older our Elder people here listening to this this is foundational this is for the young people and this is for maybe the middle aged as well this is for this is this is old hat for our elders but the jails probably preached it 73 times in his life but they'll sit here and listen patiently because they know they're not there yet not that they don't have faith but there's a greater Faith there's a Rapture in faith there's a Rapture in grace that we're looking for amen so I appreciate that you don't sit here with a filter and say well this is going to be on faith and I'm so far past that I don't need it no no there's always more blueberries if we'll just look through the right lens amen hey man let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord your word is so good Lord and there's more in it more than I think we ever realize or recognize but Lord if we'll keep walking around in the land you've given us Lord okay we'll keep looking on it if we'll keep meditating on it if we'll keep reading it if we'll keep hearing it Lord I believe we'll see those blueberries Lord that you've laid out for us Lord we'll see the healing we'll see the Deliverance we'll see the Redemption Lord we'll see the goodness of God we'll see the provision we'll see the grace we'll see the love we'll see the healing Lord every bit of it that you've given to us Lord but Lord let us not just rest on what you've given Lord but may we press towards that Mark Lord may we look for the greater things the deeper things the higher things Lord God Lord let no Pride be found in US Lord keep us humble but keep us in expectation Lord for your soon coming and the soon fulfillment of your whole word we pray Lord bless us now
