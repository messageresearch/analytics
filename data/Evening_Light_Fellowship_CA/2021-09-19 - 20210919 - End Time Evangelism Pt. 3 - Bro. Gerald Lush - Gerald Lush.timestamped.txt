[34:36] joy it's according to your faith
[34:38] amen by the grace of god
[34:41] and brother all down through the ages
[34:43] god has come to give his elect to give
[34:44] his sons and daughters what they needed
[34:47] amen
[34:48] to encourage them amen to give them
[34:50] strength to keep pressing on keep
[34:52] pressing on oh brother it had to be a
[34:54] reality for sure
[34:56] oh yes to the seed of god that even
[34:58] endured this endure this experience this
[35:00] experience that amen to many they just
[35:03] stop and forget it but no because of
[35:06] what god had given because of god what
[35:08] god had revealed they get pressing on oh
[35:10] no they didn't want to stop amen because
[35:13] they could look down and see the promise
[35:15] of god they could see the end result by
[35:18] the grace of god so brother and it
[35:20] encourages the believers this is where i
[35:22] come from and this is where i'm going
[35:24] amen
[35:25] i'll tell you there's not there's not
[35:27] many that are that are believing that
[35:29] today there's not many that are hearing
[35:31] that preach today concerning where we
[35:32] come from why we're here and where we're
[35:34] going oh no to most that are being
[35:37] preached today is always this this
[35:38] happened and oh yeah god let the devil
[35:41] do this let the devil do that oh now oh
[35:44] now you got to come back and redeem us
[35:46] yeah but we got we got a revelation of
[35:47] who we are
[35:49] amen as the sons and daughters of god
[35:52] amen brother sister amen yeah we're
[35:54] sinners saved by grace but understand he
[35:57] came to save his sons and his daughters
[35:59] praise the name of the lord to god be
[36:02] the glory oh there are others out there
[36:03] too that he
[36:04] that he's going to save amen but they're
[36:07] they're we're focusing on the bride amen
[36:09] that's him the prophet was focusing on
[36:11] the bride and it got to the place where
[36:13] he yeah even brother branham was
[36:15] becoming critical of others
[36:17] he was critical of those outside the
[36:19] message he was critical of this critical
[36:20] that until the angel came down said
[36:22] brother roman don't you do that he said
[36:24] because some of them are my children
[36:27] amen so the problem was ordained with
[36:29] the word to focus on the bride amen he
[36:33] would leave the rest with god amen so
[36:36] brother sister god help us to keep that
[36:37] right attitude and they keep their right
[36:40] spirit understand this then all that god
[36:42] has allowed to happen there's a reason
[36:44] almost definitely to bring out what's in
[36:47] you and in me to bring up what's in is
[36:50] sons and daughters praise the lord is
[36:52] nature his character amen his actions
[36:55] his reactions amen how would god react
[36:58] in this i would what would god do in
[36:59] this situation amen well that's what he
[37:02] what he would do he's required of you
[37:04] and me amen when i just dared to condemn
[37:07] we're not just here to kill we're not
[37:08] just here to do that no no we're there
[37:10] amen to encourage
[37:12] faith
[37:13] to encourage hope amen in the plan of
[37:16] redemption praise the name of the lord
[37:18] so we're challenging even those outside
[37:20] to keep a right attitude and a right
[37:22] spirit amen by the grace of almighty god
[37:25] just think if the problem of god was
[37:27] convicted
[37:28] condemning that woman that was walking
[37:30] down the street maybe because she had
[37:32] slacks on she had this on she had that
[37:33] on and the angel said don't you do that
[37:36] he said they said
[37:38] some of their she said some of them are
[37:39] my children amen brother i guess it was
[37:42] surprising for the prophet to think that
[37:44] amen because we focus on the bride amen
[37:47] the bride is in the city but again
[37:50] you've got to understand there's going
[37:51] to be many outside the city that's right
[37:53] that's right praise the name of the lord
[37:55] because the bible does say when it comes
[37:57] to the bride is you're going to sit with
[37:58] me in my throne and those outside the
[38:00] city are going to come and bow before

[39:29] one here to encourage the word faith in
[39:32] god amen and brother the faith that we

[39:37] the from the revelation that luther
[39:39] wesley and the pentecostal said oh
[39:41] amazing
[39:42] oh yeah that is pointing to what god was
[39:44] doing in their day amen what they needed
[39:47] what they hungered for what brother god
[39:49] god gave him the hunger god gave him the
[39:51] thirst amen because he knew there's
[39:53] coming a generation that would need it
[39:54] all amen

[42:11] knew that they were the ones that got
[42:12] the last ones that god had used and i
[42:14] was waiting for the next move of god
[42:17] amen and as i said it was 1965 december
[42:21] that i was baptized in the pentecostal
[42:22] church

[42:29] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[42:31] christ in bishop falls river amen
[42:34] brother bill lackett baptized me amen
[42:37] because when i went back to gamble for
[42:38] the holidays oh because i was going to

[42:46] always have fellowship with brother and
[42:47] sister barnes amen and other brothers
[42:49] and sisters amen when i got back why
[42:52] because they were non-denominational and

[42:55] they believed that amen they listen to
[42:57] oral roberts say hey allen amen
[43:00] yeah t.l osborne and other ministering
[43:02] brethren on on tapes or on records oh
[43:05] yeah

[43:18] revelation of the message and the
[43:20] messenger amen and from there we stepped
[43:22] into the light of the revealed word amen
[43:25] thank god oh hallelujah brother he did
[43:28] what he wanted to do luther wesley
[43:30] pentecost amen and what we needed was

[43:34] rapturing faith
[43:36] amen resurrection faith not just
[43:39] justification not just signification and
[43:42] not just the faith the baptism of the

[44:31] and gone amen but the message of the
[44:33] revealed word is still here
[44:35] amen yes sir but what is our attitude
[44:38] toward that revealed word amen amen what
[44:40] is their attitude toward what god is
[44:43] doing that's right amen unfortunately
[44:45] too many recognize what god did in
[44:48] malachi 4 but when he left the scene
[44:50] that was it
[44:52] and then we just went back oh well we
[44:54] believe this doctrine we believe that
[44:55] doctrine yeah
[44:57] but they're now they're no more than

[1:16:27] believe on the lord believe on the lord
[1:16:28] and so on well brother that was
[1:16:30] evangelism down through the ages but not
[1:16:32] now
[1:16:33] the the the evangelism that we're cut

[1:16:36] is amen is turning our hearts from time
[1:16:39] to eternity oh yes
[1:16:41] praise the lord on the the other
[1:16:44] evangelism is focusing on time time but
[1:16:46] now we're getting out of time into
[1:16:48] eternity and god is focusing not on time
[1:16:51] but on eternity there comes a generation
[1:16:53] that god wants to have that faith for
[1:16:56] eternity
[1:16:57] amen the faith of the resurrection the
[1:16:59] faith of the rapture brother he gave the
[1:17:02] others the faith to lead them on to

[1:17:50] we need
[1:17:51] amen it's not just a faith god has sent

[1:17:55] has revealed this mystery this mystery
[1:17:57] that mystery amen concerning these
[1:17:59] doctrines no no now brother it is the
[1:18:02] faith for the rapture

[1:31:34] atmosphere
[1:31:35] oh yeah

[1:32:00] spirit of the revival oh my brother

[1:32:04] anointing was there amen because i and
[1:32:07] then my family you're going to remember
[1:32:08] me even when we lived in
[1:32:10] saint john's and then i would get up in
[1:32:12] the morning
[1:32:13] and i would go to the window and look at
[1:32:15] the sun rising and and praise the lord
[1:32:18] amen because the anointing was in the
[1:32:20] atmosphere when i go to bed at night and
[1:32:22] lay down the anointing was in the
[1:32:23] atmosphere
[1:32:25] in the home that i lived in if i walked
[1:32:27] it on the street you know he was there

[1:32:32] oh brother it's not there like it used
[1:32:33] to be
[1:32:34] not by any means brother because back
[1:32:37] then if i
[1:32:38] about years and years ago if i'm at
[1:32:40] pentecostals praise the lord hallelujah
[1:32:42] you know he was on them the anointing
[1:32:43] was on me we have fellowship amen the
[1:32:46] anointing of what pulled us together the
[1:32:48] anointing is what made us to fellowship
[1:32:50] amen and the same thing with believers
[1:32:52] back back years and years ago when we
[1:32:55] first came to the message oh yes
[1:32:56] definitely
[1:32:58] amen we get together believers hell
[1:33:00] praise the lord hallelujah god bless
[1:33:02] your brother god bless you sister thank
[1:33:04] god for the prophet amen oh but that
[1:33:07] anointing is gone amen and even even
[1:33:10] even now i said lord i said where's the
[1:33:11] anointing now the anointing is in the
[1:33:13] heart of the bride
[1:33:15] amen oh it's gone it's where it's been
[1:33:18] rejected so much the anointing is not in
[1:33:20] the atmosphere like it used to be the
[1:33:22] united
[1:33:23] states not even in churches like it used
[1:33:26] to be you know it is not not in
[1:33:28] believer's homes like it used to be
[1:33:30] brother it's going to come back back
[1:33:31] back back to the anointing in our hearts
[1:33:34] amen the anointing is in your soul you
[1:33:36] know it's in your spirit amen
[1:33:38] but brother
[1:33:40] it's getting to the place where jesus
[1:33:42] said when the son of man comes will he
[1:33:43] find faith that's right on the earth
[1:33:46] amen amen
[1:33:48] oh yeah why where's the word the faith
[1:33:50] for the resurrection where's the faith
[1:33:51] for the rapture brother people are
[1:33:53] caught up too much with this world
[1:33:55] they're caught up too much with what the
[1:33:56] devil's doing and they're cut out less
[1:33:58] and less and less with what god's doing
[1:34:01] amen god did this god did that but
[1:34:03] what's he doing in your life
[1:34:05] what's he doing in your heart what's he
[1:34:06] doing in your soul
[1:34:07] amen what do you feel on the inside of
[1:34:09] the inside by the grace of god and so
[1:34:12] god have mercy on us
[1:34:14] amen because as time goes on we say we
[1:34:17] we feel the anointing less and less and
[1:34:19] less and less in the atmosphere so why
[1:34:22] because it's come down down down to just
[1:34:24] in you
[1:34:26] in your heart amen oh my brother no
[1:34:29] wonder that he questioned when the son
[1:34:31] of mankind will he find faith amen
[1:34:34] because i remember about years ago when
[1:34:37] my family lived in here amen and we get
[1:34:39] up on a sunday morning oh we look out
[1:34:41] and we see or even even in in our
[1:34:44] hometown in gamble look out and see
[1:34:46] people going walk going to go in the
[1:34:47] church oh yeah you you sense that
[1:34:50] atmosphere especially you knew you knew
[1:34:51] it was sunday oh yeah because if you
[1:34:54] went outside all the atmosphere was
[1:34:56] different or you sensed it you felt it
[1:34:58] amen and we look outside and we see
[1:35:00] people going to church amen oh yeah
[1:35:04] they're going to church
[1:35:06] oh they're dressed to go to church and
[1:35:08] and you see them while i remember seeing
[1:35:09] them walk up the road and they walk and
[1:35:11] walk and walk into the church and they
[1:35:13] have their bible in their hand
[1:35:15] oh yeah they have their bible there and
[1:35:17] then they'd be hugging their bible
[1:35:19] men going to church
[1:35:22] not now neither take the bible the
[1:35:23] church will leave it there
[1:35:26] or don't take it there at all
[1:35:28] yeah
[1:35:29] why because back then they gave the word
[1:35:31] preeminence
[1:35:32] amen brother i tell you the bread that's
[1:35:35] going in the rapture she's given the
[1:35:37] word preeminence in her heart and soul
[1:35:39] she's giving god preeminence to giving
[1:35:40] jesus preeminence amen she can truly say
[1:35:44] is not me that lives as christ that
[1:35:45] liveth in me amen so i pray grace
[1:35:48] brother that we'll continue on in the
[1:35:50] spirit amen by the grace of god and the
[1:35:52] spirit in us

[1:54:49] god help us
[1:54:51] god help us there's many there's many
[1:54:54] ministries out there professing the

[1:55:08] make your calling an election sure
[1:55:12] amen
[1:55:16] brother
[1:55:17] just think again like i said
[1:55:19] the lord has revealed to me i was
[1:55:21] wondering i said lord
[1:55:23] all these false christs and the prophet
[1:55:25] of god did say they got the right
[1:55:26] anointing false teachings and he said
[1:55:28] false prophets
[1:55:30] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:55:34] this is amazing what
[1:55:36] i said great signs and wonders
[1:55:40] that if it were possible they should
[1:55:43] deceive the very leg
[1:55:45] they're doing this around the message
[1:55:47] that's right
[1:55:49] amen it's not out there it we got to
[1:55:52] deal with it around the message satan
[1:55:53] has come down with great wrath knowing
[1:55:55] his time is short so i tell you this one
[1:55:57] of the biggest preachers of the message
[1:55:58] is the devil always he's anointed this
[1:56:01] one to preach the message not only that
[1:56:02] when he preached the message and he oh
[1:56:04] yeah but he's going to
[1:56:06] all
[1:56:07] 99.9
[1:56:09] right
[1:56:11] and then that point
[1:56:13] one percent whatever
[1:56:14] you you change there change the area or
[1:56:17] you'll put the answers on this but not
[1:56:19] on that not denying it but he won't put
[1:56:21] the emphasis on it
[1:56:24] brother what does god want us to put the
[1:56:25] emphasis on
[1:56:26] that's what the ministry is supposed to
[1:56:28] do
[1:56:30] sort of put you on your guard
[1:56:32] so i said lord this is this is amazing
[1:56:36] i said i pray in the name of jesus give
[1:56:38] them the revelation they need
[1:56:40] amen so that they're going to recognize
[1:56:42] these great signs and these wonders
[1:56:45] that these preachers these preachers are
[1:56:47] doing
[1:56:51] see what it well
[1:56:53] what is it
[1:56:54] brother i'll tell you this the word is
[1:56:55] god hidden
[1:56:57] and god revealed in simplicity
[1:57:01] don't add to it don't take from it
[1:57:03] leave it the way it is
[1:57:05] amen
[1:57:06] brother are you content with god in
[1:57:08] simplicity in the ministry
[1:57:11] amen god help us
[1:57:15] their brother that end time evangelism
[1:57:18] is there
[1:57:19] to deceive us
[1:57:21] yet
[1:57:22] they're going to preach the message
[1:57:26] and and they might change it a little
[1:57:28] here or not not change it at all but not
[1:57:30] put the emphasis on this they won't put
[1:57:31] the emphasis on that they're just
[1:57:33] putting emphasis on this here and they
[1:57:34] say oh yeah that's the message that's
[1:57:36] the message yeah
[1:57:38] but
[1:57:39] that's not giving you the faith that god
[1:57:41] wants in you
[1:57:42] that's not giving you the faith for the
[1:57:44] resurrection
[1:57:45] that's not giving you the faith for the
[1:57:46] rapture
[1:57:48] no no that's all that's all right this
[1:57:50] is all right that's all right yeah
[1:57:53] god help us
[1:57:56] brother brown said
[1:57:59] after the opening seals
[1:58:02] he was wondering lord what have i got to
[1:58:03] do now he preached this message that
[1:58:06] message said now that's another
[1:58:07] revelation of the seals that's another
[1:58:09] revelation of the seals and then it was
[1:58:11] finished
[1:58:13] and what did he say he said here i go he
[1:58:15] said back
[1:58:17] into evangelism that's right
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:22] brother the evangelism for us is getting
[1:58:24] their bride ready for the rapture
[1:58:26] amen
[1:58:28] is to emphasize what god has given us
[1:58:30] through the ministry of the prophet to
[1:58:32] give us
[1:58:33] rapturing faith
[1:58:35] get out of here
[1:58:37] that's what god wants us to do
[1:58:39] get out of here
[1:58:41] lord you want us to leave yes i want you
[1:58:43] to leave
[1:58:44] how are we going to leave well he said
[1:58:46] i've given you i've given you the word
[1:58:47] to give you the faith
[1:58:49] to focus on
[1:58:50] leaving
[1:58:51] to focus on resurrection focus on the
[1:58:53] rapture by the grace of god
[1:58:57] listen
[1:59:00] sufficient has been said to help us
[1:59:02] distinguish between
[1:59:03] beginning evangelism middle of the day
[1:59:06] evangelism and end time evangelism
[1:59:11] amen
[1:59:12] back then with the beginning evangelism
[1:59:15] then there was the middle of the day
[1:59:16] evangelism down through the church ages
[1:59:18] now it's endtime evangelism
[1:59:22] it's not just to get out there and get
[1:59:23] people to believe the message get people
[1:59:24] believe the message no no it's getting
[1:59:26] the bride ready for the rapture
[1:59:29] to get out of here
[1:59:31] amen
[1:59:33] it has progressed from prophets into the
[1:59:36] god prophet for the redemption of our
[1:59:38] souls
[1:59:39] and since the day of pentecost it has
[1:59:41] progressed from god prophet to the
[1:59:43] church age messengers
[1:59:45] forming into the body
[1:59:47] of the word
[1:59:48] bride
[1:59:50] amen
[1:59:51] for the redemption of our bodies
[1:59:53] praise the lord
[1:59:55] remember
[1:59:59] was the alpha redemption of our physical
[2:00:02] redemption of our souls
[2:00:04] now
[2:00:05] is jesus in the bride redeeming our
[2:00:07] bodies
[2:00:08] praise the lord yes sir amen
[2:00:12] and this isn't my idea this is the
[2:00:14] pattern of the bible this is the
[2:00:16] teaching of the prophet of malachi 4
[2:00:18] especially in his messages on end time
[2:00:20] evangelism
[2:00:22] and the evening messenger the
[2:00:24] recognizing your day and its message
[2:00:27] amen and he preached on what is the
[2:00:30] attraction on the mountain that's right
[2:00:33] amen it's not just recognizing god did
[2:00:36] this god did this god did that amen is
[2:00:38] recognizing what god has revealed and
[2:00:40] why he has revealed it
[2:00:42] what is god doing
[2:00:44] amen
[2:00:48] brother do we recognize the day we're
[2:00:51] living do we recognize the message to
[2:00:52] give us rapturing faith
[2:00:55] amen
[2:00:56] what is the attraction on the mountain
[2:01:00] what is spiritual food in due season
[2:01:03] amen
[2:01:04] amen to give us rapturing faith praise
[2:01:08] the lord amen
[2:01:10] it's hard to get the people to change
[2:01:13] from the old expectations to the new
[2:01:15] expectations
[2:01:17] and we're not ordained to have lutheran
[2:01:19] methodist pentecostal expectations
[2:01:22] brother god has given us bright
[2:01:23] expectations
[2:01:25] amen
[2:01:26] the lutherans look for this the
[2:01:28] methodists look for that the pentecostal
[2:01:30] look for that but the bride is looking
[2:01:31] for this amen
[2:01:33] amen
[2:01:35] brother to the lutherans jesus was their
[2:01:37] justifier and to the others he was their
[2:01:40] sanctifier he was the baptizer with the
[2:01:42] holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but
[2:01:44] to the bride he's the resurrection and
[2:01:46] the rapture

[2:01:51] they wanted god to do this they said
[2:01:52] thank you lord thank you thank you thank

[2:01:58] resurrection and the rapture

[2:02:04] living in the hour of that physical
[2:02:06] resurrection and that physical rapture

[2:05:00] than the second coming of our lord jesus
[2:05:03] christ and our union with him
[2:05:06] the resurrection of the dead and the
[2:05:08] rapture of the living saints if we fail
[2:05:10] to focus on the mystery of these
[2:05:12] revelations
[2:05:13] then we're not hearing the voice
[2:05:16] of evening time evangelism
[2:05:19] if we're really hearing the evening time
[2:05:21] evangelism in the message the word of
[2:05:22] the hour
[2:05:23] amen we are focusing on the resurrection
[2:05:27] and the rapture
[2:05:29] thank god for luther thank god for the
[2:05:31] others
[2:05:32] well thank god for william branham
[2:05:35] amen
[2:05:38] remember it is written unto them that
[2:05:40] look for him shall he appear the second
[2:05:43] time
[2:05:44] without sin unto full salvation
[2:05:49] with full salvation
[2:05:51] the redemption of our souls and the
[2:05:53] redemption of our bodies
[2:05:56] amen
[2:05:58] but what you got to be looking for
[2:06:00] if you're not looking for him
[2:06:02] you're not expecting it
[2:06:04] you're not going to experience it
[2:06:07] amen but if you're baptized with the
[2:06:09] holy ghost and the life of christ is in
[2:06:11] you amen you're looking for the
[2:06:12] resurrection looking for the rabbis
[2:06:14] you're expecting it lord you said this
[2:06:16] you promised this you promised that amen
[2:06:18] lord we're still looking for it
[2:06:21] amen amen
[2:06:26] amen
[2:06:27] he will appear the second time without
[2:06:29] sin unto salvation
[2:06:32] that's a promise he will with full
[2:06:35] salvation soul and body appear to those
[2:06:38] who are eagerly and constantly looking
[2:06:40] for him amen how do we look for him to
[2:06:43] appear
[2:06:44] we look in the word and watch as god
[2:06:46] interprets the promise of his appearing
[2:06:48] and coming by bringing it to pass in our
[2:06:51] day
[2:06:52] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:06:54] angel declares is appearing and is
[2:06:57] coming for the bride
[2:07:00] anything that the problem of god was
[2:07:01] putting the emphasis on was the second
[2:07:03] coming of christ for the bride
[2:07:06] and the invisible union of the heavenly
[2:07:09] bridegroom and the earthly bride
[2:07:13] amen
[2:07:16] again it is written that the marriage of
[2:07:18] the lamb has come
[2:07:20] and his bride has made herself ready
[2:07:23] and before she can make herself ready
[2:07:25] she's got to recognize by the scriptures
[2:07:28] that she's the bride spoken of in the
[2:07:30] scriptures
[2:07:31] amen
[2:07:35] evening time evangelism is showing the
[2:07:37] bride who she is
[2:07:39] amen you are the bride of the lord jesus
[2:07:42] christ you are making yourself ready by
[2:07:45] time lining up with the word
[2:07:47] amen and you are personally uniting in
[2:07:50] an intimate relationship with jesus
[2:07:53] you are looking with great expectation
[2:07:55] to gather with the saints of all ages
[2:07:58] for the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:08:00] amen you are living for jesus
[2:08:03] you are living for our lord jesus christ
[2:08:07] not your wife not your husband

[2:08:27] after jesus first
[2:08:30] give jesus preeminence
[2:08:32] amen
[2:08:34] we are living in a changing time
[2:08:37] and more so now than it was 40 years ago
[2:08:43] in 1962 the prophet said
[2:08:49] he said in malachi of
[2:08:50] the
[2:08:51] third chapter of the first verse six
[2:08:54] verse he said i want to take a reading
[2:08:56] for i am the lord i change not
[2:09:00] i want to take a little subject he said
[2:09:02] it would be pleasing to the lord he said
[2:09:04] the unchangeable god works in an
[2:09:06] unexpected way
[2:09:09] and he says we are living in a changing
[2:09:11] time everything is changing that's true
[2:09:14] and it's just everything that you can
[2:09:16] look and see with your eyes come out of
[2:09:18] the earth and it's material and it
[2:09:21] starts changing
[2:09:23] amen
[2:09:24] and he said now he said now he said that
[2:09:26] this place he's a phoenix has changed
[2:09:29] and it goes to show that it goes right
[2:09:31] with the times it changes just as time
[2:09:34] changes amen
[2:09:36] other places are changing
[2:09:38] he says so the roads has changed the
[2:09:41] city's changed politics change
[2:09:44] he said they are constantly changing
[2:09:46] year after year
[2:09:48] he said politics changed nations change
[2:09:51] and he said that he said year by year
[2:09:53] and he said there they they changed
[2:09:55] their attitude and they changed their
[2:09:57] program
[2:09:59] he said it's got so that people today
[2:10:02] are not friendly
[2:10:03] like they used to be
[2:10:05] and that's true
[2:10:07] he said i don't know whether you noticed
[2:10:08] it or not but he said we noticed it back
[2:10:11] he sit in the south and cast and he said
[2:10:13] people are changing year by year
[2:10:17] and he said there's too much of a hurry
[2:10:20] where they're going
[2:10:22] naturally but not spiritually
[2:10:26] the more caught up we're going here
[2:10:28] going there doing this doing that
[2:10:30] but what about spiritual
[2:10:31] god help us
[2:10:33] amen
[2:10:35] and he said you notice most of the women
[2:10:37] today they have washing machines they
[2:10:40] have electrical irons and push-button
[2:10:43] dishwashers and everything like that and
[2:10:45] yet they got less time to pray than they
[2:10:48] ever had
[2:10:52] but things are changing
[2:10:55] and we could go a little further issa to
[2:10:57] the people and to bring it in the church
[2:11:00] he said the church is changing
[2:11:03] yeah the atmosphere in churches today is
[2:11:05] not like it was back years ago

[2:11:55] and he said i don't mean to be different
[2:11:59] but he said it's just that i'm living in
[2:12:01] a changing time
[2:12:02] and as long as you're building the wall
[2:12:04] one straight way it's all fine and
[2:12:07] bricklayers can go right down the road
[2:12:10] but he said when you have to turn the

[2:13:53] prophet no it's the faith for the
[2:13:55] resurrection
[2:13:57] looking for the faith of the rapture now

[2:14:33] from the church age to the bright age
[2:14:36] amen
[2:14:38] hallelujah
[2:14:39] and in this bright age under evening
[2:14:41] time evangelism by the prophet of the
[2:14:44] faithful ministry the bride is receiving
[2:14:46] the change of our physical body
[2:14:49] the old is giving way to the new
[2:14:52] amen the change that took place in the
[2:14:55] prophet

[2:15:00] bride
[2:15:02] amen amen

[2:15:12] and sure in this revelation believing
[2:15:15] with all of our hearts that it is the
[2:15:17] absolute truth that we can just rest
[2:15:20] like ruth
[2:15:21] knowing that there's a change come
[2:15:23] coming on she would experience boaz's
[2:15:26] redemption that's what we want
[2:15:28] and that's what we need as well as is
[2:15:31] redemption of our bodies
[2:15:33] amen we he's redeemed us spiritually but
[2:15:35] how many are looking for the redemption
[2:15:36] of your body
[2:15:39] thank god lord you redeem them
[2:15:41] spiritually
[2:15:42] spiritually and in my soul i am redeemed
[2:15:45] but god is now looking for us to have
[2:15:46] the faith to redeem our bodies
[2:15:52] amen
[2:15:53] believe us thou this
[2:15:58] oh lord we believe in the resurrection
[2:16:00] we believe there but he said i am the
[2:16:02] resurrection
[2:16:05] again do i like
[2:16:07] that my brother did email me some
[2:16:09] scriptures there and it was there
[2:16:13] where lazarus was in the grave
[2:16:17] and
[2:16:18] jesus came oh no he oh and they said
[2:16:20] lord if you come before you would he
[2:16:22] wouldn't have died you would have raised
[2:16:24] him
[2:16:24] jesus said
[2:16:26] what he said i am the resurrection
[2:16:29] yeah
[2:16:30] and then he went on to the grave of
[2:16:31] lazarus and and oh yeah his friends were
[2:16:34] there weeping and mary and martha was
[2:16:36] weeping
[2:16:37] and then it says jesus wept and they
[2:16:39] said jesus went because lazarus was dead
[2:16:41] no
[2:16:42] i said no
[2:16:43] as that wasn't it brother i said jesus
[2:16:46] went because they were weeping
[2:16:48] jesus went because of their unbelief
[2:16:51] jesus went because of their doubt
[2:16:53] jesus said why he said he said because i
[2:16:56] am the resurrection
[2:16:58] amen
[2:16:59] he told he told martha oh he said he'll
[2:17:00] rise again oh yes she said he'll rise in
[2:17:02] the last day yeah no he said i am the
[2:17:04] resurrection
[2:17:06] amen why would jesus weep if he was
[2:17:08] going to raise him from the dead
[2:17:12] so i said no i said are you weeping
[2:17:13] because of their unbelief
[2:17:15] he was weeping because of their doubt
[2:17:18] amen i said he when it comes to raising
[2:17:20] lazarus i said he was the resurrection
[2:17:24] and i said he said lazarus
[2:17:26] come
[2:17:26] forth and lazarus that was dead for was
[2:17:29] it four days came forth amen
[2:17:33] amen amen
[2:17:35] brother
[2:17:36] i pray grace that god's not gonna that
[2:17:38] we're not gonna cause god to weep
[2:17:39] because of our unbelief
[2:17:42] but rejoice because of our faith
[2:17:44] amen
[2:17:46] by the grace of god
[2:17:49] remember the bride cherishes this as
[2:17:52] luther cherished the revelation of
[2:17:53] justification
[2:17:55] wesley sanctification the pentecostals
[2:17:57] the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts
[2:17:59] of the spirit the bride cherishes the
[2:18:01] revelation of the resurrection and the
[2:18:03] rapture how many are really really
[2:18:06] really putting the emphasis on
[2:18:07] resurrection and rapture
[2:18:09] how many
[2:18:11] i really believe what god has done what
[2:18:12] god's doing
[2:18:14] god help us
[2:18:16] amen
[2:18:20] listen
[2:18:23] in the end time evangelism the prophet
[2:18:26] said
[2:18:28] i was thinking about going into the
[2:18:29] message but i don't have that time right
[2:18:30] now i want to turn to our brother joseph
[2:18:32] eventually to say what he he feels to
[2:18:35] say
[2:18:38] but in the message end time evangelism
[2:18:40] on page eight the prophet said now he
[2:18:42] said we are thinking of evangelism at
[2:18:44] the end time
[2:18:45] and anyone can read a newspaper and see
[2:18:47] the conditions of the nation
[2:18:49] realize that something is fixing to
[2:18:51] happen
[2:18:52] and when you see one with a chip on his
[2:18:54] shoulder and them arguing with all kinds
[2:18:57] of weapons
[2:18:59] and so forth to fight with
[2:19:01] and he's in kicking off their shoes
[2:19:03] beating desks
[2:19:04] and everything he said you know
[2:19:06] something is fixing to happen
[2:19:09] and he said that brings upon the people
[2:19:10] it's a kind of a feeling that something
[2:19:13] is fixing to happen the world as we
[2:19:15] would call it cosmos the outside world
[2:19:18] feels that there is coming destruction
[2:19:21] amen
[2:19:22] say like an atomic age is fixing the
[2:19:25] blast forth
[2:19:27] and the christians knows it's the coming
[2:19:29] of the lord
[2:19:30] and he said see there's an atmosphere
[2:19:33] and it depends on what you're looking at
[2:19:35] for our lord has strictly told us
[2:19:39] just what was going to happen at that
[2:19:41] time and we don't know the middle of the
[2:19:43] hour but we know we are nearing
[2:19:46] something now amen definitely
[2:19:50] and he said we know redemption is nigh
[2:19:53] and something is fixing to take place
[2:19:55] the world doesn't see that that's true
[2:19:58] but the bride sees it
[2:20:01] he said they laugh at it because they
[2:20:03] did it in other days but we know that
[2:20:06] it's coming near and that's the reason i
[2:20:08] chose this subject today
[2:20:11] amen
[2:20:14] end time evangelism
[2:20:17] he chose that to preach on to show that
[2:20:20] the emphasis is put on the resurrection
[2:20:22] and the rapture
[2:20:24] is not getting people to come and just
[2:20:26] be christians come in and be and receive
[2:20:28] christ come and do this come on that no
[2:20:30] it's to recognize the hour for the
[2:20:32] resurrection the rapture brother
[2:20:35] now is to leave and be with jesus
[2:20:38] grace
[2:20:41] the prophet was commissioned to get a
[2:20:42] bride ready and he don't want us to miss
[2:20:45] what's happening and like ruth we have
[2:20:48] to go beyond just coming into the land
[2:20:50] we have to find boaz in the field
[2:20:53] lay at his feet and pull the battle of
[2:20:56] his word and shekinah glory over us
[2:20:59] amen
[2:21:01] the grace of god
[2:21:02] recognize who he is and our need for him
[2:21:06] by the grace of god end time evangelism
[2:21:09] is bringing the bride into a greater and
[2:21:11] greater awareness
[2:21:13] of what he has done and what he is doing
[2:21:17] amen
[2:21:18] praise the lord that we are experiencing

[2:23:51] him uh just felt like it was a good time
[2:23:53] to just to have a quick update on on
[2:23:56] cover 19. uh unfortunately it's still
[2:23:59] with us
[2:24:00] and um you know for example as you know
[2:24:02] i believe it was yesterday um they they
[2:24:05] put the mask mandate in place um so it's
[2:24:07] one of the things that we uh emailed the
[2:24:09] church about yesterday which i'm sure
[2:24:10] you all saw but we're kind of taking a
[2:24:12] step back now again uh asking that uh we
[2:24:16] refrain from handshakes and hugs and
[2:24:19] that sort of thing outside
[2:24:21] okay we're just going to go back to that
[2:24:23] and hopefully you know the mask mandate
[2:24:25] will be
[2:24:26] lifted again soon and we can go back to
[2:24:29] uh that being okay
[2:24:32] so um the other thing i just wanted to
[2:24:34] uh just talk about real quick is that um
[2:24:38] because of the vaccine and uh you know
[2:24:41] different countries and provinces
[2:24:42] opening up
[2:24:44] we're now able to travel with a bit more
[2:24:46] freedom and so uh you know some some
[2:24:48] families have been traveling uh others
[2:24:51] have plans for example my in-laws are
[2:24:53] planning to come
[2:24:55] october 10th and they're going to be
[2:24:56] here for i believe five weeks
[2:24:59] um four or five weeks
[2:25:01] um bichol is is planning to travel to
[2:25:03] india at the end of the month maybe
[2:25:04] there's other travel plans
[2:25:06] i'm not sure but with that
[2:25:09] we just felt like it's important to um
[2:25:11] just talk about that real quick um if
[2:25:13] you are planning to travel
[2:25:15] we ask that you let myself or paul know
[2:25:18] uh just your your travel dates okay uh
[2:25:21] just so we know who's coming and going
[2:25:23] and
[2:25:23] the reason for that is we just want to
[2:25:25] make sure that when folks return that we
[2:25:28] know when they're coming back and paul
[2:25:30] or myself would be following up uh with
[2:25:32] anyone who travels like yourself i shall
[2:25:34] when when you get back
[2:25:37] just to talk about okay what what are
[2:25:39] the quarantine requirements now uh for
[2:25:41] you
[2:25:42] uh when do you expect to be back in
[2:25:44] church um any of those details like that
[2:25:46] i think it's important that that we have
[2:25:47] that conversation
[2:25:49] and uh that we're not we're not here to
[2:25:52] uh enforce uh a quarantine uh we're not
[2:25:55] quarantining experts uh if anything uh
[2:25:59] the details it seems of of what's
[2:26:00] required and what's not required
[2:26:03] at a macro level seems to be saying
[2:26:04] relatively the same for the province you
[2:26:06] know 14 days and all those things but
[2:26:08] the details of that i'm learning are are
[2:26:10] seem to be evolving and and
[2:26:13] that conversation with an individual or
[2:26:15] family is i think is really important uh
[2:26:18] just so we can get educated myself and
[2:26:20] paul on kind of what what you've been
[2:26:22] told
[2:26:22] um and so we know what to expect and
[2:26:25] ultimately our goal there is not to
[2:26:27] get into your business obviously
[2:26:30] it's it's really just about the church
[2:26:31] here
[2:26:32] and uh so that everyone here can be
[2:26:34] comfortable coming to church and knowing
[2:26:36] that for example if i shall use your
[2:26:38] voice as example but
[2:26:41] if he goes to india comes back and a
[2:26:43] week later he's sitting in church
[2:26:45] i just want everyone to be comfortable
[2:26:47] to know that if he's here it's because
[2:26:50] he's spoken with the deacons and he's
[2:26:52] allowed to be here and he's followed all
[2:26:54] the rules and and no one needs to be
[2:26:55] concerned okay in that regard
[2:27:00] the reason i'm i'm bringing this up is
[2:27:01] like there there hasn't been anything
[2:27:03] done wrong okay um
[2:27:05] it's really if i'm being honest um the
[2:27:07] fact that uh
[2:27:09] we the deacons didn't have this thought
[2:27:11] through uh in the last few weeks is is
[2:27:14] really why i'm up here um there was some
[2:27:16] some confusion that was created with the
[2:27:18] colombo family um because we didn't have
[2:27:20] this in place and i take responsibility
[2:27:22] for that okay and i've been talking with
[2:27:25] the family about that
[2:27:26] so i just want to make that clear that
[2:27:27] that's why i'm up here is really it's
[2:27:30] it's on us
[2:27:32] and to make it clear going forward as
[2:27:35] best we can
[2:27:36] just looking through my notes here
[2:27:44] yeah the last thing is just with with
[2:27:46] this you know brother john um
[2:27:49] i believe has been through one or two
[2:27:51] quarantinings i think uh so far and uh
[2:27:54] i just want everybody to know that we
[2:27:56] really are doing our best to be
[2:27:58] impartial to the objective uh to treat
[2:28:00] every individual every family the same
[2:28:02] uh when it comes to holding them to the
[2:28:04] health orders of the day okay
[2:28:07] uh the guidelines are we've said from
[2:28:09] the beginning as a church there's orders
[2:28:10] there's guidelines we kind of put those
[2:28:12] in two different categories the health
[2:28:14] orders are the health orders um
[2:28:16] even if they seem foolish
[2:28:18] even if we think there's a very low
[2:28:20] probability of kova being spread among
[2:28:22] us because of our unique you know
[2:28:25] social uh activity and our kind of close
[2:28:28] circle
[2:28:29] all of that is a material it it's really
[2:28:31] just when it comes to health orders we
[2:28:33] are going to um try to adhere to them as
[2:28:35] best we can as a church
[2:28:37] and just know that we we are really you
[2:28:39] know there isn't uh individual treatment
[2:28:41] going on it's it's uh we're being as as
[2:28:43] impartial as we can be
[2:28:44] and uh and just really just taking the
[2:28:47] lead of the province uh of the in terms
[2:28:49] of their guidelines the the orders uh
[2:28:51] that they've set out we're just going to
[2:28:53] line up with those as best we can um you
[2:28:55] know for the duration of this so
[2:28:58] is there any questions about any of that
[2:29:02] so would it be
[2:29:03] easy to say that if you have traveled
[2:29:05] you should not come back to church
[2:29:11] yes yeah
[2:29:13] yeah and if you you know
[2:29:16] you don't want to tell us you're leaving
[2:29:17] that's fine it's more so when you come
[2:29:18] back you know that that's
[2:29:20] it's not important that we know you're
[2:29:22] you're gone as such it's more so when
[2:29:23] you return just to let us know you know
[2:29:25] before before you come back to church
[2:29:28] uh we'd really appreciate that um
[2:29:31] if for some reason that doesn't happen
[2:29:32] it'll just end up being a conversation
[2:29:35] uh in the parking lot you know
[2:29:37] to
[2:29:38] to understand uh what's happening which
[2:29:40] which we would like to avoid that i
[2:29:42] think that would be uncomfortable
[2:29:45] any other questions
[2:29:49] okay
[2:29:51] brother bob
[2:29:52] thank you
[2:30:05] what can i stand
[2:30:24] if i could just add one thing it's
[2:30:27] it's nice to know if you are going
[2:30:30] and it's a little bit self-serving on my
[2:30:32] part but uh
[2:30:34] i would put you on the prayer request
[2:30:36] list until you come back
[2:30:38] and then everybody will know and
[2:30:39] everybody will be praying for you while
[2:30:41] you're while you go because we need each
[2:30:43] other's prayers and we uh and we need
[2:30:47] god's protection and we need a new bass
[2:30:49] player or a bass amplifier not a bass
[2:30:51] player
[2:30:52] amplifier
[2:30:55] sorry joe you're always you're okay
[2:30:59] so that's just uh
[2:31:01] i just thought i'd throw that in

[2:31:08] if we go away
