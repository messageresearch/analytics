[30:16] again this morning we pray Lord asking
[30:19] your touch on your people in Jesus
[30:21] Christ's name we ask it amen amen God
[30:25] bless you turn if you would easy
[30:26] scripture to find Genesis 1 And1 this
[30:29] morning Genesis 1 And1 it's good to be
[30:32] here this morning appreciate your your
[30:34] graciousness to let us move the service
[30:36] back we didn't get to bed till about
[30:37] 4:45 this morning uh Blanc and the boy
[30:41] flight got pushed back an hour and a
[30:43] half and then when I woke up it had been
[30:45] pushed back another 20 minutes so they
[30:46] didn't land till 3:20 and uh then the
[30:49] luggage took the longest that's ever
[30:51] taken I think in St John's airport and
[30:53] so we didn't get home till late and then
[30:55] putting all the boys to bed and whatnot
[30:57] so
[30:58] uh I had planned to stay up and just
[31:00] till about 1:30 and then pick them up
[31:01] but when I saw 3:00 and then 3:20 I said
[31:04] I'm just going to go to bed and that
[31:05] worked out pretty well I'm I'm actually
[31:07] feeling quite good this morning so I
[31:08] thank the Lord for that amen but uh it
[31:11] gives me a bit of a feeling for how
[31:12] brother Grant feels so often when he
[31:14] works through a night and then comes
[31:15] into church and and and and sits through
[31:18] a service like this so anyways God bless
[31:20] the grants good to see you back again
[31:22] we've missed you while you're away amen
[31:24] just trusting the goodness of God we did
[31:26] have brother kmen Mills book his flight
[31:27] so he will be here while I'm gone to
[31:29] Vancouver and he'll preach the Saturday
[31:31] January 20th at 6: p.m. Lord willing and
[31:34] then again Sunday morning at 11:00 a.m.
[31:36] so looking forward to that amen Let's uh
[31:39] let's go to the word this morning
[31:40] Genesis 1 And1 says in the beginning God
[31:43] created the Heaven and the Earth and the
[31:46] Earth was without form and void and
[31:48] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[31:50] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[31:53] face of the waters and God said let
[31:55] there be light and there was light and
[31:57] God saw the light that it was good and
[31:59] God divided the light from the darkness
[32:01] and God called the light day and the
[32:03] Darkness he called night and the evening
[32:05] and the morning were the first day amen
[32:07] God bless you you can have your seats
[32:08] this morning maybe bit of a strange
[32:10] start uh start you know considering the
[32:13] the topic we're on and we are continuing
[32:14] our our series on manifesting time and
[32:16] we're moving towards adoption but we're
[32:18] taking a subtitle this morning of the
[32:21] spirit of light brother Matt I've got
[32:22] just a bit of an echo here I don't know
[32:24] if there's something you can do about
[32:25] that amen but we're going to talk about
[32:26] the spirit of light we're going to take
[32:27] at least a couple services on this and
[32:29] I'm I'm more to set a a foundation again
[32:32] this morning because we're still talking
[32:33] about this attribute of Charity Divine
[32:35] love it's the the nature and attributes
[32:37] and the effect of the Holy Ghost and you
[32:39] know as I read this first scripture we
[32:42] looked at the first portion of creation
[32:44] was a division between Darkness and
[32:45] Light and to me that's an amazing thing
[32:48] because as we see here this is not just
[32:49] a scripture about what happened them but
[32:51] it's a scripture about what's happening
[32:53] day in and day out and season and age
[32:55] after age in the lives of the the
[32:57] Believers amen and before we see that
[32:59] division though what we see is a moving
[33:01] of the spirit of God Amen you'll find as
[33:03] we go through this that there's a
[33:04] working of the holy spirit in the people
[33:07] because it says it moved upon the face
[33:08] of the waters and you'll see if you go
[33:10] through scripture and brother Brandon
[33:11] makes it clear time and time again he
[33:12] says Waters is people Waters is people
[33:15] so what if you take the scripture and
[33:17] you move it into US it says the Holy
[33:18] Spirit moved across the people amen and
[33:21] what was it doing it was preparing them
[33:23] for something that was going to happen
[33:25] the moving of the holy spirit is a prec
[33:27] cursor to an event that God wants to
[33:28] happen and we'll see it in a service the
[33:30] moving of the holy spirit is not to make
[33:32] us shout and dance and jump that's a
[33:34] wonderful thing but it's there to
[33:36] perform something that God wants done
[33:38] it's there for something that God has
[33:40] planned there's an event there's a
[33:42] situation that God has foreordained and
[33:44] so the moving of the spirit prepares you
[33:47] for what God's trying to do amen and we
[33:49] see that What's Happening Here is it's a
[33:51] working of the Holy Spirit and it's
[33:53] preparing the World to Change because
[33:55] it's been in a certain way for so long
[33:57] and there's been no life it's been dark
[33:58] it's been in chaos but what's happening
[34:00] is the spirit's moving and when the
[34:02] spirit's moving then something has to
[34:03] happen after that amen there's supposed
[34:05] to be a purpose behind all these things
[34:07] brother B puts it this way he says well
[34:09] there was a time when the world was
[34:10] laying in utter Darkness it was without
[34:13] form and was void and it was all covered
[34:15] with water and was laying there in the
[34:17] dark dismal gloomy
[34:19] atmosphere sometimes that's where we're
[34:21] at dark dismal gloomy amen look for the
[34:25] moving of the spirit because something
[34:27] will move that away he says and the
[34:29] spirit of God moved upon that water and
[34:31] said let there be light God had a reason
[34:35] to do that for down beneath that water
[34:37] there were seeds that he had planted and
[34:40] it had to have that sunlight to make it
[34:43] live so catch that thought the spirit of
[34:45] God moves on the waters it's moving on
[34:47] the people and it's preparing the world
[34:49] to produce what's already in it it's
[34:51] moving on the people to produce what's
[34:53] already in it the seeds are there they
[34:55] just need light to start growing and so
[34:57] the spirit moves and the spirit moving
[34:59] is going to bring the light afterwards
[35:00] amen but everything's in chaos it's not
[35:02] growing it's submerged it's hidden it's
[35:04] mky it's dark it's just turmoil and
[35:07] death he says and the first light was
[35:10] ever given in the Earth was God's spoken
[35:12] word the first light that ever struck
[35:14] the Earth was God's spoken word he said
[35:17] let there be light and there was light
[35:19] that turned Darkness into light in order
[35:23] watch this to bring forth a creation of
[35:26] joy and life upon the earth a creation
[35:31] of joy and life if that's what it was in
[35:34] the beginning what ought it to be now he
[35:36] says then the spirit of God as it moved
[35:38] with what love and
[35:41] compassion anden the spirit of God moves
[35:43] with love and compassion it's doing it
[35:45] for your good it's doing us to do
[35:48] something in your life that'll bring out
[35:50] good things in your life says it moved
[35:52] with love and compassion at that gray
[35:54] the first day of the dawn of creation
[35:56] upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept
[35:59] across its rays and dried up the waters
[36:01] from the earth and made an atmosphere
[36:03] above and for its first time it was to
[36:07] bring joy and life to the Earth by a
[36:10] seed he says that was a great hour so
[36:13] the Holy Spirit was moving to prepare
[36:16] the Earth to produce what's already in
[36:17] it and we've talked about this many
[36:19] times as we've preached on the statute
[36:21] of a perfect man that the moving of the
[36:22] Holy Spirit the working of the holy
[36:24] spirit is to draw out what God has
[36:26] already placed inside of the believer if
[36:29] you never were part of the word you will
[36:30] never be a part of the word if you
[36:32] didn't have the word you won't be the
[36:33] word amen it's something that's in there
[36:35] but the moving of the holy spirit is to
[36:37] draw out what's there and it's setting
[36:39] an atmosphere brother Braham said
[36:41] setting an atmosphere for the word to
[36:43] come forth for the seeds to come forth
[36:45] and each one to produce of its own kind
[36:47] amen so when the Holy Spirit starts
[36:49] moving look at it this way it's a
[36:51] countdown the moving of the holy spirit
[36:53] is a countdown to an event that God has
[36:56] planned because God doesn't move with
[36:58] purpose and so he sends the spirit and
[36:59] brother Brandonwood said he sends the
[37:01] Holy Spirit to you to put an unction in
[37:03] your heart to put a desire in your heart
[37:05] to put a call in your heart for what
[37:08] God's already planned to give you in
[37:09] your life that God is preparing the
[37:11] church that God's preparing the People
[37:14] by the unction the moving of the holy
[37:16] spirit so that they're ready when the
[37:17] spirit moves to bring forth what's
[37:19] supposed to happen in its time and in
[37:20] its season amen so when we see the Holy
[37:23] Spirit moving look for its purpose
[37:27] it's easy to enjoy the atmosphere and we
[37:30] don't want to stop that it's like being
[37:32] in a marriage you don't want to lose the
[37:34] atmosphere but the atmosphere is for a
[37:36] purpose and it's to bring life it's to
[37:37] bring joy it's to bring love and all of
[37:39] these different things if God's wanting
[37:41] to do something then let's look for what
[37:43] he's wanting to do not just bask in the
[37:45] presence let the presence have its
[37:47] effect amen if he's moving then he's
[37:49] moving to take out Darkness he's moving
[37:50] to cast out sickness he's moving to
[37:52] change things he's moving to break
[37:55] change inside of every one of our lives
[37:56] lives he's looking to bring things into
[37:58] order that's what's happening when the
[38:00] spirit's moving it's bringing things in
[38:02] order remember brother bradam had to
[38:04] preach Church order why because they
[38:05] were stuck on the blessings rather than
[38:07] the purpose but when the Holy Spirit
[38:09] comes in the opening of the full word
[38:11] what does it do is it puts those gifts
[38:13] it puts those things in their right
[38:14] place and all of a sudden now it's an
[38:15] effective body rather than chaos one
[38:18] jumping up here brother said one pop up
[38:20] here and one pop up here they would
[38:22] interrupt the preaching of the word in
[38:23] these different
[38:24] things brother Bram said but this time
[38:26] he's speaking about Easter now and it is
[38:28] the rising of the sun it's his e last
[38:30] Easter message he says but this time
[38:32] when the sun rose there was a dual sun
[38:34] rising he's talking about the
[38:35] resurrection he says another son s o n
[38:38] Rising it was not only Su Rising it it
[38:41] was the s o n had risen to bring eternal
[38:44] life to All God's promised Sea by that
[38:47] forn knowledge he had seen laying upon
[38:49] the Earth no more could the botney life
[38:51] live back there at the beginning without
[38:53] the Su to bring it to life and no more
[38:56] than today when sons of God is is upon
[38:59] the Earth it takes the s o n light to
[39:02] bring them to eternal life his chosen
[39:05] ones that he knew before the foundation
[39:07] of the world he had chosen them in
[39:09] himself before the foundation of the
[39:11] world so brother BS jumped 2,000 years
[39:13] now 4,000 years and he said there was a
[39:15] first light that came forth and there
[39:17] was a rising of the sun and it prepared
[39:19] things he says now we come 4,000 years
[39:21] and now there's an s o n a capital s o n
[39:24] rising and it's to bring forth the same
[39:26] type of thing is to bring forth the
[39:27] seeds of the predestinated sons of God
[39:30] out of this world he says and on Easter
[39:32] morning in this dirt somewhere laid our
[39:34] bodies at that time for we are the dust
[39:36] of the Earth but In Heaven There was a
[39:39] book of memory and his attributes were
[39:41] in him knowing that because this son of
[39:44] God raised it would also raise to life
[39:47] every son that was for ordained to this
[39:49] great time he knew it would be and what
[39:52] a more glorious Sunrise that was than it
[39:55] was at the beginning when it first done
[39:58] so the prophet saying we read Genesis 1
[40:00] and we see that in the beginning was the
[40:02] word and then we see that it says let
[40:04] there be light and light comes forth but
[40:06] he says that's not the great light that
[40:08] was really intended that word that said
[40:10] let there be light was for a sunlight to
[40:12] come a capital s o n light and when the
[40:15] First Sunlight comes then now there's
[40:16] many sons that are going to be born
[40:18] after there's sons and daughters that
[40:19] are going to come up out of the dirt of
[40:21] this Earth and they're going to be the
[40:22] same word as that sunlight that came
[40:24] forth on Resurrection morning amen
[40:27] brother bam said there's an Easter
[40:28] morning and the first Son of God Rises
[40:30] and that's to set the pattern because
[40:32] there's more sons of God that have to
[40:33] rise there's more Daughters of God that
[40:35] have to rise that morning there was a
[40:37] death that was broken there was a death
[40:39] that was bound and it's so that there's
[40:41] another death that's going to be bound
[40:42] in your life and in my life it was
[40:44] setting a pattern for Sunrise after
[40:46] Sunrise of each child of God being born
[40:48] by the spirit of God and breaking the
[40:50] chains and shackles of death and of
[40:51] Satan's kingdom amen these events are
[40:53] meant to happen over and over again as
[40:56] the word is born in its time and season
[41:00] brother B says this he says now in
[41:01] Genesis 1 the first CH or Genesis the
[41:04] first chapter the spirit of God moved
[41:06] upon the face of the waters and the
[41:08] Bible said in the beginning back there
[41:09] that this world was without form and was
[41:11] void there is nothing but just a
[41:13] darkness of chaos and what a horrible
[41:16] shape it must have been in nothing but
[41:18] way into the darkness Yonder without
[41:20] light or anything the churning of the
[41:22] water and that wandering star twisted
[41:25] around around the orbits out there
[41:27] somewhere it must have been a terrific
[41:29] mass of something lost like it was it
[41:32] couldn't find its
[41:34] way he says and that's just what we
[41:37] become when we became wandering Stars
[41:39] away from God just without hope without
[41:42] God just turning around in darkness not
[41:44] knowing where we're going he says and
[41:47] God took that great chaos of darkness
[41:50] and transformed it into a Garden of Eden
[41:53] SE by his word he says and that's how
[41:56] we're transformed by God's word when God
[41:59] said let there be light and that mass of
[42:01] creation out there come over and around
[42:03] the Sun and begin to revolve around the
[42:06] sun and it became a Garden of Eden
[42:09] how because it obeyed the word of God
[42:15] now church let me put it this way the
[42:17] Earth did not choose to
[42:19] obey the word went forth with power and
[42:22] it moved it to where it needed to be to
[42:25] set up the conditions for the word to be
[42:27] born he says it done the perfect will of
[42:30] God for it was transformed from chaos
[42:32] into a Garden of Eden by the word of God
[42:36] then he says now that's what we are here
[42:39] for that's what we're here for today he
[42:42] says that's my message it has been all
[42:44] along is the word of God we must hold to
[42:47] that regardless of what other things
[42:48] take place always stay with that word
[42:51] always what does that look like always
[42:55] check your motives and objectives if it
[42:58] is according to the word of God see we
[43:00] look at the action is the action right
[43:02] but is your motive and objective right
[43:03] too cu the wrong motive with the right
[43:05] action will still produce the wrong
[43:07] result cuz what my fingers are in it my
[43:10] fingers mess things up we got to get our
[43:12] hands out of it and let God work through
[43:13] us he says if it isn't leave it alone if
[43:17] your motives and objectives are right
[43:19] leave it alone it might be the right
[43:21] thing to do but if your motives and
[43:22] objectives are wrong leave it alone
[43:24] until you get them right by the word he
[43:26] he says but if it's with the word of God
[43:28] and lines up with the word of God then
[43:30] that he says you hold to that now I've
[43:33] got I had a ton of quotes as I was
[43:34] studying This and like I said I think
[43:36] we'll take two services on this probably
[43:38] but there's dozens and dozens of
[43:40] scriptures on the Holy Spirit and light
[43:42] and what it means but the thing that
[43:44] came through time and time again is that
[43:46] light brings the seed of God into the
[43:48] order of the word of
[43:50] God seed can lay a long time and nothing
[43:54] happen but you got got to remember when
[43:56] we go to the parable of the swer he
[43:58] planted seed specifically in an area he
[44:02] planted it good seed in a good field
[44:05] that was prepared and then an enemy
[44:07] comes and he Blends in a bunch of things
[44:08] other around it but when the sunlight
[44:10] comes forth no matter what it's going to
[44:12] bring the good seed out The Bad Seed
[44:14] might come with it but the good seed are
[44:16] going to come forth no matter what
[44:17] because they've been planted with
[44:19] purpose and the purpose is to bring you
[44:21] into your full word potential that's
[44:23] what we're supposed to be doing here
[44:24] coming into the word for our day coming
[44:26] into the word for our season that Spirit
[44:28] of light it's the Living Word of God is
[44:30] to here to take us out of Darkness out
[44:32] of chaos out of gloominess out of
[44:35] Despair and despondency whatever it is
[44:37] that's murky around us and to take us in
[44:40] the light of God that shows us the path
[44:41] and the way of a holy ghost filled
[44:43] believer what is it it's so that the
[44:45] word can be produced that's all it's
[44:47] trying to do that's all light is trying
[44:48] to do is produce life we've said this
[44:51] scripture in John 1 many times and and
[44:54] it says in the beginning was the word
[44:55] the the word was with God the Word was
[44:57] God the same was in the beginning with
[44:59] God all things were made by him and
[45:02] without him was not anything made that
[45:04] was made now watch these last two verses
[45:07] in him was life and the life was the
[45:10] light of men and the light shineth in
[45:13] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[45:15] it not the darkness did not overcome on
[45:17] it did not overcome it now I preached on
[45:19] this scripture in John 1 many times and
[45:21] I think it's probably the greatest
[45:23] scripture that you can have when it
[45:24] comes to what what the the plan of God
[45:26] looks like because it tells us our
[45:28] origin and it takes us through the
[45:29] process and it takes us all the way to
[45:31] our destiny all over again amen it takes
[45:33] us from the word as a thought it brings
[45:35] us through the Fulfillment in flesh not
[45:37] just in Christ but it's in you and I you
[45:39] see the whole plan of God right here in
[45:40] John 1 if you read the entire chapter it
[45:43] says in the beginning was the word the
[45:44] word was with God and Word was God so we
[45:46] see our origin was where in the
[45:48] beginning in the beginning was the word
[45:51] and then we see our position the word
[45:53] was with God and the Word was God
[45:56] that's not just Christ that's those that
[45:58] are in Christ as well then we see the
[46:01] word was not just a thought and it was
[46:02] not just an idea and it wasn't just
[46:04] something spoken but it was a person
[46:06] because it says in verse three all
[46:08] things were made by him so the word has
[46:10] to come into a person it is a person and
[46:13] then from there we come in from the word
[46:16] was a person and him in him was life and
[46:19] that life now becomes the light of men
[46:21] and so the word now moves all the way
[46:23] down from God in morphed in a in a
[46:25] Pillar of Fire into a morphate into a
[46:28] body and now he's come down into you and
[46:30] I and it's the exact same word it's the
[46:32] exact same life it's the exact same
[46:34] light every bit by bit it's God just
[46:36] dispersing him down through all of these
[46:38] things because look it doesn't stop with
[46:41] Christ that's where denomination has
[46:43] stopped so many times as they point to
[46:45] 2,000 years ago and they neglect to see
[46:48] that there's a life that is a light of
[46:49] men today amen and Christ is being
[46:52] manifested again what is light light is
[46:55] the prec cursor to life if you have
[46:57] light you will have life if there's
[46:59] anything to come to light if there's
[47:01] anything to come to life listen if
[47:03] you've just got dirt guess what nothing
[47:05] comes out of
[47:07] dirt if you got a seed in the dirt you
[47:10] put it in light in time that seed will
[47:13] come forth because light produces the
[47:16] conditions for life but whatever's in
[47:18] there is going to come out no matter
[47:19] what if you put it under light whatever
[47:22] is in there is going to come
[47:24] out but if it's just dirt what happens
[47:27] when the Sun goes
[47:28] away what happens the dirt loses the
[47:32] victory doesn't it CU there's no life in
[47:34] it CU see there's Cycles in life isn't
[47:36] there there's a daytime there's a night
[47:38] time there's a good time there's a tough
[47:40] time there's there there's times of
[47:41] wealth and there's times of poorness
[47:43] there's times of Health there's times of
[47:44] sickness all these things but if there's
[47:46] a seed in there and the life has
[47:47] quickened it even though it turns into
[47:50] night the seed still grows in the
[47:52] night cuz there's life there's something
[47:54] there but if it's just dirt as soon as
[47:56] that Sun Goes Over the Horizon then the
[47:58] dirt just gets cool again and we lose
[48:01] everything brother Braham says this he
[48:03] says life comes only by the word of God
[48:06] made
[48:07] manifest he says as long as it's just in
[48:10] the book like this he says it can still
[48:12] be questioned but when it's made
[48:14] manifest then you see the product of
[48:16] what it spoke of be manifest then that
[48:19] is the light of the word he says see the
[48:22] word said so and then when it come to
[48:24] pass that is life in light it's light
[48:28] bringing Life Light brings life he says
[48:32] plant the wheed out here and put it in
[48:33] the basement covered all over and it'll
[48:35] never bring forth anything CU it can't
[48:38] there's no light there but as soon as
[48:40] light strikes it then it'll bring forth
[48:42] life if it's a germatize seed he says
[48:45] there's the same thing it is in the word
[48:47] see the word is God and when the light
[48:50] strikes it it brings the word to life
[48:53] again he's pointing us back to Genesis
[48:55] one he says when the word was a light
[48:57] and it struck a seed It produced the
[48:59] word he says and it's got to be the same
[49:01] thing again it's been laying dorant but
[49:04] as soon as the light of God's word
[49:05] strikes the word inside of you it's got
[49:08] to bring forth life again because it has
[49:10] to produce it's a word seed and it has
[49:12] to produce the word for its age he says
[49:14] every age has always been that oh how we
[49:16] appreciate these great things how that
[49:18] the word being Vindicated is the light
[49:20] of the spoken word see cuz we've always
[49:24] it's so easy to look at the script and
[49:26] put things only for the moment that
[49:27] they're in but brother braham's taking
[49:29] us back to Genesis 1 and this is the
[49:32] last year he's alive seals are open he's
[49:34] understanding the scriptures in a way
[49:36] he's never understood them before and
[49:37] he's saying you've got to realize that
[49:39] you were part of that light being called
[49:41] forth that you were part of that word
[49:43] being called forth at the very beginning
[49:46] and that word has been sitting there for
[49:48] 6,000 years to bring you
[49:52] out the light came forth the first time
[49:54] and it drew natural seeds out of the
[49:56] earth he said but there's a word that
[49:58] went forth and it was based on the
[49:59] memory the thoughts the book of the
[50:01] thoughts of God and that's been going
[50:03] forth and it's working and it's working
[50:06] and it's moving upon the face of the
[50:08] people on the face of the waters and
[50:10] it's bringing you to the place where
[50:11] you'll come to
[50:13] life and it's been going on for 6,000
[50:15] years and the word has been moving with
[50:17] power and with authority to bring you to
[50:19] the place where you're at today right
[50:22] here right now that's the working of the
[50:25] word of
[50:26] God that's an amazing thing to think
[50:29] that the word has been working for 6,000
[50:31] years to bring a bride to this place
[50:33] where she's at today that's what he
[50:35] thought he thought of you right here
[50:37] where you are today just like this and
[50:39] then he said the same thing when Christ
[50:41] Rose he says that's not just an event
[50:44] but that's an event that has to be
[50:46] repeated because if the word goes down
[50:47] the word must come up if there was a
[50:50] word planted then a word has to come
[50:51] forth and if Christ goes down and dies
[50:53] and comes up then if the word is planted
[50:55] again and comes up it has to come up
[50:57] again it's the same thing there's a
[50:59] resurrection there's a Rapture there's a
[51:01] changing of the bodies for each and
[51:02] every one of us so that means that if
[51:04] there was a light for them there's a
[51:06] light for us if there was a time for
[51:07] them there's a time for us if there's a
[51:09] season for them there's a season for us
[51:11] each and every one of us has been
[51:13] planted and the light comes to us in a
[51:15] particular season and if we're under the
[51:17] right light it'll produce the right
[51:20] thing Isaiah 60 very familiar scripture
[51:23] for the bride says arise
[51:26] Shine for thy light is come and the
[51:29] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee let
[51:31] me stop there it didn't say arise Shine
[51:34] for light has come it says your light
[51:36] has come that means you've got a light
[51:38] to sit under you've got a light to rest
[51:41] under and you've got a time for the
[51:43] light to come to you your light may have
[51:45] been lit before mine was you may have
[51:48] come to light before I did but I've got
[51:50] a light and you've got a light and
[51:52] you've got a season and I've got a
[51:54] season the scripture says says that each
[51:55] one is supposed to bring forth fruit in
[51:57] their
[51:58] season some of you are ahead of me and
[52:00] some of you are behind me it doesn't
[52:02] bother me CU we've each got a season to
[52:04] bring forth our fruit and it's based on
[52:06] when the light came to us and what we've
[52:08] been pled for and what our purpose is as
[52:10] the Earth spins around the Sun and turns
[52:12] around it's moving around but as it
[52:14] moves it spins and every Revolution is a
[52:16] day and guess what the Eastern s Eastern
[52:20] Hemisphere gets light before we do does
[52:22] that make them better no it just means
[52:27] they got light before we
[52:28] did and what happens is as the Earth
[52:30] continues to spin then light comes to us
[52:33] their day starts way before ours does
[52:34] but their day ends way before our does
[52:36] as well and it's a cycle and it's a
[52:38] season so they get their light and
[52:40] things start and then they things start
[52:42] to really grow and work and then it goes
[52:44] into night time and things slow down a
[52:45] bit but we're just getting started and
[52:47] so what you'll find is in the end it all
[52:48] works
[52:49] out it all works out we all end up in
[52:52] the same place the same time right that
[52:55] extra eight hours that Africa gets ahead
[52:57] of us doesn't really give them an
[52:58] advantage it's all the same thing cuz
[53:00] they cool down when we get hot it all
[53:03] works out in the end amen but the light
[53:05] has to come to
[53:07] you there's a light that's come in this
[53:10] age and it's for you behold I send unto
[53:14] you Elijah the prophet right there's a
[53:17] light that comes to you and what is the
[53:20] effect of
[53:21] it it says if your light has come then
[53:24] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[53:26] what's the glory of the Lord you look in
[53:28] the scripture you look up that this is
[53:30] exactly all I did in the scriptures I
[53:31] just looked up glory of the Lord and
[53:33] quotes and you know what it is time and
[53:35] time again it's the pillar of cloud and
[53:36] it's the pillar of fire it's the
[53:38] personal presence of Jesus
[53:41] Christ so it says arise Shine for thy
[53:45] light has come and when your light comes
[53:48] the personal presence of Christ comes in
[53:50] your midst comes into you CU it says
[53:53] it's risen upon thee it's it's resting
[53:55] upon you that's what happened with
[53:58] Christ at the River Jordan Remember unto
[54:00] whom thou seest what the spirit
[54:03] descending resting upon that's the one
[54:07] and then he says what we've each one got
[54:09] it as well we've got a time we've got a
[54:12] season where this thing's going to come
[54:13] down upon us and it's the personal life
[54:15] amen it's the Living Word it's the
[54:16] presence of God it's the Holy Spirit the
[54:18] glory of God is the holy spirit in a
[54:21] believer's life bringing us into full
[54:22] maturity that's what it looks like
[54:25] brother Braham said this I don't have it
[54:26] in the notes I was just reading in the
[54:27] office he said every man born again of
[54:30] the Holy Ghost is glorified in God's
[54:33] presence right now waiting for the time
[54:35] of
[54:36] redemption right now the holy spirit is
[54:39] upon you and you are glorified now in
[54:41] Christ's presence but it's not me as in
[54:45] it's not about me there's nothing
[54:47] glorious about me there's someone
[54:48] gloriest that has to be inside of me in
[54:50] order for his glory to rise upon me amen
[54:53] CU in this flesh dwells no good thing
[54:54] Paul say said amen but if we've died out
[54:57] and there's something else that's risen
[54:58] up in us like it says risen upon us now
[55:01] we've got the Glorious one inside of
[55:03] us Paul said in 2 Corinthians he says
[55:06] but we
[55:08] all
[55:10] all he says with open face beholding as
[55:13] in a glass a mirror the glory of God are
[55:16] changed into what the same
[55:20] image we all being changed into a word
[55:22] image we all being changed to reflect
[55:24] Christ
[55:26] oh we look different this morning from
[55:29] different backgrounds different colors
[55:30] different genders whatever it might be
[55:32] we look and we say we're all different
[55:34] but we're being changed into the same
[55:35] thing and it's Christ The Living Word he
[55:37] says we're changed into the same image
[55:39] from what glory to glory he says his
[55:43] glory is risen upon thee we're being
[55:44] changed from glory to glory here a
[55:47] little there a little here a line their
[55:49] line precept upon precept building us up
[55:52] into the exact same thing that it was in
[55:54] the beginning he says how even as by the
[55:58] spirit of the Lord so the spirit of the
[56:01] Lord in you changes you into the glory
[56:03] of the word for your day so if we come
[56:05] back to our scripture it says arise
[56:07] Shine for thy light is come and the
[56:09] glory of the Lord is risen upon the that
[56:11] we're risen means to appear to break
[56:13] forth or to shine in other words a light
[56:15] coming into US brings light out of us if
[56:19] you got a light in you then there's
[56:20] going to be a light that comes out of
[56:21] you we'll get into that maybe in the
[56:23] next service amen that's there there's
[56:25] something in us that lays hold of us and
[56:27] it makes us like itself that's what's
[56:29] happening the spirit of God is coming in
[56:31] but watch why we need this light because
[56:33] in verse two it says for Behold The
[56:35] Darkness shall cover the
[56:37] Earth the darkness that's a specific
[56:41] Darkness it's not generic Darkness this
[56:43] is the darkness and you know what that
[56:44] is it's the absence of the presence of
[56:47] God we're in Satan's edting now there
[56:51] there there's nothing here amen but then
[56:55] watch this it says that the darkness
[56:57] shall cover the Earth that word Darkness
[57:00] means things are obscured they're hard
[57:02] to see but then it says and gross
[57:04] Darkness shall cover the
[57:06] people now you got darkness and then you
[57:09] got a gross darkness that word gross
[57:11] means heavy cloud and darkness so the
[57:14] cloud the darkness on the people is
[57:16] worth some what's on the the Earth
[57:18] itself that's why the Earth is groaning
[57:21] and travailing it's it's crying out for
[57:22] the manifestation of the sons of God cuz
[57:24] it's in darkness
[57:25] but the people are even in a worse
[57:27] place it says for so and gross Darkness
[57:31] upon the people so the people are in a
[57:33] worse condition but look what his promis
[57:34] to us he says but the Lord shall arise
[57:37] upon thee and His glory shall be seen
[57:40] upon thee church I love a good promise
[57:42] and that's about as good as it gets when
[57:45] things are as dark as it's ever been I'm
[57:48] going to be a light upon you and my
[57:50] glory is going to be seen in you in a
[57:52] time of chaos unrest confusion uh m work
[57:55] nothing seeming clear yet I'll be with
[57:58] you and not only will I be with you but
[58:00] my glory is going to be shown in your
[58:01] lives each and every one of us God's
[58:03] going to come to us and he's going to
[58:04] put us in a personal relationship
[58:06] that'll make us live a word that nobody
[58:08] else can live amen notice now it's a
[58:11] cloudiness it's dense it's dark in New
[58:13] Finland we know what dense cloud is like
[58:15] don't we
[58:17] fog and you know what's the worst fog in
[58:20] the late
[58:22] evening why cuz you can't see anything
[58:26] the light is fading and the light fades
[58:30] it there's just a bit enough to light
[58:32] the fog up so you can't see through it
[58:34] you're almost better off in the sheer
[58:35] Darkness with fog
[58:37] sometimes but it just makes it so hard
[58:39] to see I remember when I was here in
[58:40] November of 2019 and I had sister
[58:43] moren's little Corolla and I was going
[58:45] through on the on a peacekeeper way up
[58:47] towards there and when I came up to the
[58:49] main highway I couldn't see a thing
[58:53] nothing at all the fog was so dense
[58:56] couldn't see a thing and all I was doing
[58:58] was trying to see the markings on the
[59:00] road to make sure that I was going to
[59:02] stay in the right lane and go in the
[59:04] right direction cuz I couldn't see
[59:05] anything that's the conditions God's
[59:07] talking about for this age you can't see
[59:10] anything you know where you are but you
[59:14] can't see anything around you you have
[59:15] no point of reference you have nothing
[59:17] to say which way I'm going and is it the
[59:19] right way now we've got cars with
[59:21] headlights and we've got roads with road
[59:23] marking so we know we can follow that
[59:25] but in that day they didn't have that
[59:26] and if you're in a gross darkness and
[59:28] you don't have any points of reference
[59:29] you don't have any landmarks what
[59:31] happens you get lost and that's what
[59:34] we've had today is it's become so dark
[59:36] in the church world that they've lost
[59:38] all points of reference they've call
[59:41] good evil and evil good they've made the
[59:44] word they've made the word fit them
[59:47] rather than them fit the word they've
[59:49] cut it they've trimmed it out they've
[59:51] made it and here's the thing church
[59:52] that's why they're naked is because they
[59:54] have no covering none of the word is
[59:56] covering them they've changed it and
[59:58] it's a garment of their own making and
[59:59] so they're naked in the eyes of God but
[1:00:01] they moved away from the absolute
[1:00:03] reference of God's word and so they're
[1:00:06] walking around in murkiness and then
[1:00:07] they wonder why things happen the way
[1:00:09] they do and they they wonder why they
[1:00:10] don't get the results that they want in
[1:00:12] these different things why it's because
[1:00:14] they lost the reference it's so dark
[1:00:16] it's so murky they're so caught up in
[1:00:18] their man-made conditions and their
[1:00:20] denominations and these things and they
[1:00:22] end up going in a direction that they
[1:00:23] think is right and the ways thereof are
[1:00:25] the ways of death cuz there's only one
[1:00:27] way there's only one path there's only
[1:00:30] one door and it's Christ the
[1:00:32] word and says straight is the way and
[1:00:35] few there be that find it it's a
[1:00:38] dangerous time this mariness is
[1:00:41] dangerous in Zechariah it says it shall
[1:00:44] come to pass in that day the light shall
[1:00:47] not be clear nor dark it's not full dark
[1:00:51] and it's not full light it's murky
[1:00:54] nothing's clearly dist displayed it
[1:00:56] Shadows it's it's obscured it says but
[1:00:59] it shall be one day which shall be known
[1:01:02] to the Lord not day nor night but it
[1:01:04] shall come to pass that at the evening
[1:01:07] time it shall be light this is evening
[1:01:09] Light Fellowship that's what we call
[1:01:11] ourselves this the the the title we put
[1:01:13] on this church right now and he says at
[1:01:14] the evening time the end of the day the
[1:01:17] End of the Age the end of the season the
[1:01:19] end of God working with mankind the
[1:01:21] Gentiles have an evening time and we're
[1:01:23] in it this is it we're here nothing more
[1:01:26] coming for the Gentiles after this and
[1:01:28] then God moves to the Jews and they have
[1:01:29] their evening time as well and they both
[1:01:32] get the exact same light and what is it
[1:01:35] it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:38] yesterday today and forever it's Christ
[1:01:42] the word being manifested in flesh once
[1:01:44] again in the true believer's lives amen
[1:01:47] what is it it's the Holy Ghost living
[1:01:50] again that's all it is because in a day
[1:01:53] they'll get it and we've had 2,000 years
[1:01:56] to get it and we go into rap
[1:01:57] resurrection and Rapture and then it
[1:01:59] comes back to them and they get the Holy
[1:02:00] Ghost and in a day 144,000 are sealed
[1:02:03] and then it goes into absolute and total
[1:02:05] chaos brother Braham says it this way he
[1:02:07] says and you predicted there would be a
[1:02:09] time from your crucifixion until your
[1:02:11] coming a day that would not be night nor
[1:02:14] day it would be a dismal gloomy time he
[1:02:16] says just enough light to see how to get
[1:02:20] around I call it muddling around you're
[1:02:23] not getting anywhere but you see enough
[1:02:25] to to know that where your next step is
[1:02:27] going to be but you can't see anything
[1:02:29] beyond that and you don't know where
[1:02:30] you're headed again because you can't
[1:02:31] see any references you can't see any
[1:02:33] landmarks amen they're stumbling in the
[1:02:35] darkness in the dimness they can get
[1:02:37] around but they can't see where they
[1:02:38] need to go and they can't confirm that
[1:02:39] they're going in the right direction CU
[1:02:42] it's all in their own head amen but
[1:02:44] there's a promise to the True Believer
[1:02:46] and he says in Isaiah 42 he says and I
[1:02:48] will bring the Blind by the way that
[1:02:50] they knew not I will lead them in paths
[1:02:53] that they have not known I will make
[1:02:55] Darkness light before them and watch
[1:02:58] this and crooked things straight if
[1:03:01] there's anything you know about people
[1:03:02] that W that are in the woods getting
[1:03:04] lost you know what they do they never
[1:03:06] walk straight they call it the death
[1:03:08] spiral and they tend to walk in
[1:03:11] circles what they don't do is walk in a
[1:03:13] straight line he says I'm going to bring
[1:03:14] light in a time of darkness and I'm
[1:03:16] going to make your path straight so you
[1:03:17] know how to walk I'm going to light the
[1:03:20] path and here's the thing Church it
[1:03:22] doesn't matter how dangerous it is die
[1:03:24] side as long as you follow the light in
[1:03:26] the middle of the path you stay in the
[1:03:27] middle of the road brother Ram told us
[1:03:29] always stay in the middle of the road
[1:03:32] remember that story he told about the
[1:03:34] the the king that needed a new Chariot
[1:03:35] driver I don't know if he told I've
[1:03:37] heard ministers talk about it the king
[1:03:39] needed a new Chariot driver and so he
[1:03:41] had him take him along the L A Road
[1:03:43] along the edge of a cliff and one guy
[1:03:45] came and he was going as fast as he
[1:03:47] could go and he was sliding that Chariot
[1:03:49] around the corners and the wheels just
[1:03:51] skidding on the very
[1:03:53] edge
[1:03:54] the king says that's no good for me you
[1:03:56] put my life in your hands
[1:03:59] recklessly then the next guy came and he
[1:04:02] was driving along and he was so close to
[1:04:04] the inside of the cliff that the King
[1:04:06] was worried that he was going to flip
[1:04:07] the Chariot if he made a single mistake
[1:04:10] cuz the thing is this we're going to
[1:04:11] make a mistake at some point he said
[1:04:14] that's no good he says you're too busy
[1:04:16] trying not to make a mistake that you'll
[1:04:19] end up wrecking us anyways then the
[1:04:21] third guy came and he drove at a sane
[1:04:23] speed just in the middle of the road and
[1:04:26] the King was never in danger from
[1:04:27] falling off nor hitting the inside of
[1:04:29] the cliff he says you're the one I want
[1:04:31] because you're taking my life into
[1:04:32] account rather than trying to impress me
[1:04:35] that's where God wants a believer in the
[1:04:37] middle of the road that's the safest
[1:04:39] place to be
[1:04:41] amen but the promise is there he says
[1:04:43] there's going to be light in the evening
[1:04:44] time he says he turned Darkness into
[1:04:46] light he'd straighten out the path of
[1:04:48] our lives but the question we have then
[1:04:49] is how do we know if we found the light
[1:04:52] there's a lot of lights I was read a
[1:04:54] quote where brother BR says Hollywood
[1:04:55] shines there's lots of glittering going
[1:04:58] on out there there's lots of Ministries
[1:05:00] out there and I'm just talk not talking
[1:05:02] message I'm talking around the world
[1:05:04] there's lots of gifts out there lots of
[1:05:06] manifestations how do you know if you
[1:05:08] found the light how do you know what is
[1:05:10] the right
[1:05:11] light there's got to be a word answer
[1:05:13] for it we know what ours is revelation 1
[1:05:17] says write the things which thou Hast
[1:05:19] seen and the things which are and the
[1:05:21] things which shall be Hereafter The
[1:05:23] Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou
[1:05:25] sawest in my right hand and the Seven
[1:05:27] golden candlesticks he says the Seven
[1:05:29] Stars are the Angels of the seven
[1:05:31] churches and the Seven candlesticks
[1:05:33] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[1:05:36] so there's a light for every age and
[1:05:38] it's one
[1:05:40] man anointed by the Holy Ghost that's it
[1:05:43] it's always been that way it will ever
[1:05:45] be that way it's one Ministry it's one
[1:05:49] man that can catch the voice of the Holy
[1:05:51] Ghost the Holy Spirit to that age and he
[1:05:53] comes with a message and it saves and it
[1:05:56] sanctifies and it does the work that God
[1:05:58] requires For That season and that age
[1:05:59] that's the only one a Candlestick can
[1:06:02] only burn as it has
[1:06:03] fuel and remember those candlesticks in
[1:06:06] those days they had to have oil
[1:06:07] constantly and oil is the Holy Ghost so
[1:06:11] the only way you're going to get oil is
[1:06:13] if the Holy Ghost is moving to produce
[1:06:15] that light it's the only thing otherwise
[1:06:18] it's dead it's dead it's man-made light
[1:06:21] the only light that God works with is
[1:06:23] the word being made Real by the Holy
[1:06:25] Spirit otherwise it's a false light amen
[1:06:28] we can preach till we're blue in the
[1:06:29] face we can say Amen all day but until
[1:06:31] it's alive in me I'm lost that's just
[1:06:35] this it's the simple truth of it brother
[1:06:37] bam says this in the church age book he
[1:06:39] said the seven spirits and the Seven
[1:06:40] Stars the spirits were the angels that
[1:06:43] went to the Stars which were Messengers
[1:06:45] seven spirits seven different times the
[1:06:47] Holy Spirit would anoint a messenger
[1:06:50] which was a star in his day he says a
[1:06:52] spirit is eternal and the star was made
[1:06:55] for a purpose to reflect light in the
[1:06:58] dark of these Church ages where candles
[1:07:00] and stars were
[1:07:01] representing the angel the spirit was
[1:07:04] the one that went to the star and
[1:07:06] reflected the light of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:08] through this star to that church age he
[1:07:11] says that you might wonder who the seven
[1:07:12] spirits are it say seven messengers of
[1:07:14] the seven Church ages see now and each
[1:07:17] time that star came on the scene the
[1:07:19] Holy Spirit came down and anointed that
[1:07:22] star and kept it just exactly like the
[1:07:24] first ones was only one light for one a
[1:07:28] for each age and it comes by the Holy
[1:07:29] Spirit anointing a single
[1:07:31] messenger we have people talking about
[1:07:33] eighth Messengers today impossible
[1:07:37] there's only one messenger for each age
[1:07:40] he said clearly there's Seven Ages you
[1:07:42] say we're in a bride age that that's
[1:07:45] that that's a a metaphor that we're
[1:07:47] outside of the Leo Deans because we're
[1:07:49] out Christ is out so we've got to be out
[1:07:52] they've kicked him out of the church but
[1:07:54] that doesn't mean we're out of the
[1:07:55] season the age itself but we're not
[1:07:57] identified with Leo deia we've come out
[1:07:59] of her my people amen there's no eighth
[1:08:01] messenger eighth messenger goes to the
[1:08:04] Jews that's who gets it amen that's
[1:08:07] their season it's not ours there's
[1:08:08] nothing more coming brother Braham says
[1:08:10] you've got your last sign all that's
[1:08:12] left now is the producing of the word of
[1:08:14] God in our lives last signs come
[1:08:17] greatest signs ever seen since Christ
[1:08:18] was on Earth in this day that was the
[1:08:21] last sign there's nothing more coming
[1:08:24] so the question is then will we receive
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:27] light light's a funny
[1:08:30] thing youo there can be light there but
[1:08:32] you've got to take advantage of
[1:08:34] it if we were to turn out all the lights
[1:08:37] and black out all the windows here and I
[1:08:39] sha a light and I sha it down this path
[1:08:42] down the aisle here you'd you'd easily
[1:08:44] find your way out as long as you stayed
[1:08:46] in the light that I'd sha on that path
[1:08:49] but if you turn down that light and you
[1:08:50] say I'm going to find my way out of this
[1:08:52] church another way
[1:08:54] you know what happens the light that you
[1:08:56] ignore actually puts a greater Shadow on
[1:08:59] where you're trying to go it makes the
[1:09:01] situation worse because you have this
[1:09:02] contrast between light and darkness and
[1:09:04] so it makes things more obscure it makes
[1:09:06] things more shadowed and your lights
[1:09:08] your eyes are trying to compensate for
[1:09:10] light and darkness at the same time and
[1:09:12] what it does is it actually blinds you
[1:09:13] even worse than you would be than in
[1:09:15] total darkness because you're trying to
[1:09:17] ignore the light and find your own way
[1:09:19] and the light actually causes shadows as
[1:09:21] you walk away it makes it worse
[1:09:25] but we have a choice we have a choice to
[1:09:27] walk in
[1:09:28] light we have a choice to walk in what
[1:09:30] the holy spirit's doing in our lives
[1:09:32] what it's convicting what it's leading
[1:09:33] how it's guiding how it's trying to work
[1:09:35] inside of our Lives amen and if we turn
[1:09:38] it down things get tough in a hurry a
[1:09:40] real hurry first John says this but if
[1:09:45] we you know what that says it's not just
[1:09:48] you and it's not just me we means more
[1:09:51] than one that means there's at least two
[1:09:53] real Believers in the
[1:09:55] world if we walk in the light as he is
[1:09:59] in the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:10:01] another so that means if there's two
[1:10:03] Believers they're going to get
[1:10:05] along if we can't get along we're not
[1:10:07] walking in light if we can't have
[1:10:09] Fellowship we're not walking in light he
[1:10:12] says we have Fellowship one with another
[1:10:14] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:10:17] cleanses us from all sin brother man
[1:10:20] puts it this way he says then to see God
[1:10:21] in the midst of darkness and the
[1:10:23] Darkness of Creed the darkness of
[1:10:25] denominations take his word and a bunch
[1:10:28] of people that will believe it and shine
[1:10:30] forth his light and his life catch this
[1:10:34] he says it's more
[1:10:36] light it's not more than was it's more
[1:10:40] of what was in the
[1:10:41] beginning God's bringing more because
[1:10:44] there's sons and go Daughters of God
[1:10:46] that have to be produced it's more light
[1:10:47] coming forth it's not new light it's
[1:10:49] just the light coming forth it's more he
[1:10:52] says it's eternal life more more than it
[1:10:54] was at the dawn of creation where he
[1:10:56] said let there be light and there was
[1:10:58] light certainly so there's more to
[1:11:00] Genesis 1 than we thought when he called
[1:11:02] forth light he was not just calling
[1:11:03] forth light in terms of the logos the
[1:11:06] Son of God he wasn't just calling forth
[1:11:07] the Sun and the Moon which was actually
[1:11:08] later but he was calling forth children
[1:11:10] of God word born Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:13] God Amen so we've got to be found
[1:11:16] walking in the word today with God today
[1:11:19] amen here's the thing Jesus said you are
[1:11:22] the light of the world
[1:11:24] he says here more light remember he said
[1:11:26] I'm the light of the world and then he
[1:11:28] comes to the end he says I'm going away
[1:11:30] and now you're the light of the
[1:11:31] world so the word became light the word
[1:11:34] the light became life he says and now
[1:11:37] I'm going away but I'm going to send the
[1:11:39] same life upon you I'm going to send the
[1:11:40] same light upon you he takes them up
[1:11:42] into an upper room and on the day of
[1:11:44] Pentecost what does he do he puts light
[1:11:46] inside of them what was it tongues of
[1:11:48] fire came down he lit their Wicks he
[1:11:51] turned them into lamps and then he says
[1:11:54] you are the light of the world now and
[1:11:56] so the word is being made flesh in the
[1:11:58] same way that it was in Christ in you
[1:11:59] but we've just got a little portion
[1:12:02] we've just got a little bit but we've
[1:12:03] got it that's the thing is we've got it
[1:12:05] and we've got to recognize that on the
[1:12:07] day of Pentecost he was doing was he was
[1:12:09] redistributing the light he was
[1:12:11] redistributing the life so that he could
[1:12:14] have little lights all over this world
[1:12:17] cuz when he was there there was only one
[1:12:18] light and if you missed them you missed
[1:12:20] them but then on hundreds and thousands
[1:12:23] and tens of thousands and millions of
[1:12:25] Lights perhaps in the world today now
[1:12:27] there's a witness that the whole world
[1:12:28] can see no matter where we are cuz it
[1:12:30] had to go to Every tongue and Nation had
[1:12:33] to go to every place and he needed to
[1:12:35] put little lights in each and every one
[1:12:36] of us
[1:12:37] amen but we've got to be walking with
[1:12:40] God
[1:12:41] today the message that we Preach Today
[1:12:44] is not the same message that was
[1:12:45] preached 50 years ago it's the same
[1:12:48] message but the preaching has changed
[1:12:50] why because God has been continuing to
[1:12:52] reveal himself
[1:12:54] he's been revealing where we're at he's
[1:12:56] been revealing what is supposed to be
[1:12:58] done in this age you look at what the
[1:13:00] message
[1:13:01] was you know even even 30 years ago so
[1:13:05] much was about God sent a prophet God
[1:13:07] sent a prophet God sent a prophet Church
[1:13:09] we've moved so far beyond God sent a
[1:13:11] prophet that it almost has no relative
[1:13:13] Rel it's not even relative anymore
[1:13:15] because we've moved on from like John
[1:13:17] and Christ we've moved on from he was
[1:13:20] here to point us to him now we moved on
[1:13:22] to the one he was pointing us too we've
[1:13:24] accepted that light but we've moved on
[1:13:26] Into the Light of Christ himself the
[1:13:27] word made flesh amongst us amen we've
[1:13:29] got to keep walking and if we walk he
[1:13:31] says then what the S the blood of Jesus
[1:13:34] Christ cleanses us day in day out that
[1:13:38] walking cleans us it keeps us clean puts
[1:13:42] things in that need to be put in it
[1:13:43] takes things out that need to be taken
[1:13:45] out it's a washing of Water by The
[1:13:47] Living Word of God Amen and there's a
[1:13:49] there's a mercy there's a Grace that
[1:13:50] comes with Walking with God that you
[1:13:52] can't get anywhere else you just can't
[1:13:54] do it we've got to keep going from with
[1:13:56] Christ we've got to go from repentance
[1:13:58] to baptism all the way to the spirit of
[1:14:00] God dwelling inside of us and leading us
[1:14:02] and guiding us and that's our Victory
[1:14:04] that's our overcoming Powers when he's
[1:14:06] in the house
[1:14:09] Amen on that thought of the blood of
[1:14:11] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sins
[1:14:12] if we walk with him Paul said in Romans
[1:14:14] 8:1 he says there is therefore now no
[1:14:17] condemnation no condemnation
[1:14:20] none no condemnation to them which are
[1:14:23] in Christ Jesus who walk how not after
[1:14:26] the flesh but after the spirit church
[1:14:29] there is a contrariness between the
[1:14:31] Flesh and the spirit and Paul's drawing
[1:14:34] a distinction he says if you walk in the
[1:14:35] spirit if you walk in the light as he is
[1:14:37] in the light there's no condemnation CU
[1:14:40] you're with him you're in his light
[1:14:42] you're in his presence you're under his
[1:14:44] authority you're under his headship How
[1:14:46] can there be condemnation when you're
[1:14:47] with him he's the perfect one he's the
[1:14:49] Holy One if you're with him and in in
[1:14:52] him dwells all good things then how can
[1:14:53] you be wrong you can't you're with him
[1:14:57] you're following him then Paul would say
[1:14:59] in Galatians he says if we live in the
[1:15:01] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[1:15:04] the Amplified says if we claim to live
[1:15:06] by the Holy Spirit we must also walk by
[1:15:08] the holy spirit with personal Integrity
[1:15:11] Godly character and moral courage he
[1:15:13] said let us go forward walking in line
[1:15:17] our conduct controlled by the spirit
[1:15:21] it's not a popular thing to say and I
[1:15:23] can say it this morning because we don't
[1:15:24] have any people here that that that are
[1:15:26] unbelievers as I would call it but if
[1:15:28] you don't accept that light all that's
[1:15:30] left is judgment and we preach light and
[1:15:32] we preach mercy and we preach Grace and
[1:15:34] we preach love because that's the remedy
[1:15:37] but if you turn that down God's done
[1:15:39] everything he can and all that's left is
[1:15:42] Judgment but he's given us a way out
[1:15:46] he's told us how we can do it and it's
[1:15:47] to walk in the light of God's word for
[1:15:50] today
[1:15:51] amen not just just a revelation of a man
[1:15:54] 2,000 years ago that died and gave his
[1:15:56] life for us and rose from the dead but a
[1:15:58] revelation of what he's doing today
[1:16:00] brother Bram said this way he says don't
[1:16:02] refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:16:04] Christ which brings the warming rays of
[1:16:07] the Holy Ghost upon you and makes you a
[1:16:09] new creature in Christ Jesus don't try
[1:16:11] to walk in some glare of another age now
[1:16:14] that glare might have been all right in
[1:16:16] the other age it might have been all
[1:16:18] right for them he's not saying it's
[1:16:21] wrong he's saying it was right for
[1:16:24] then he says it proved so in the days of
[1:16:27] our Lord Jesus he was the scriptural
[1:16:28] light of that day he was the light but
[1:16:31] he wasn't the light until he come on the
[1:16:33] earth to vindicate the promised word you
[1:16:36] know he said there John was a bright and
[1:16:38] Shining Light and you love to walk in
[1:16:41] his light for a
[1:16:44] season John was light for six months
[1:16:47] that's it but he was light a bright and
[1:16:50] a Shining Light John flipped the system
[1:16:54] on its head he came in and he just
[1:16:57] upended everything he took away the
[1:16:59] spirituality of the of the priesthood he
[1:17:01] told the people to repent he's trying to
[1:17:03] prepare the way and for 6 months he gave
[1:17:06] them a way
[1:17:08] out and then he introduced him to the
[1:17:10] person of the way out the way the truth
[1:17:13] and the life amen he says here was John
[1:17:16] on Earth making that written word live
[1:17:19] he was the voice of one crying in the
[1:17:20] wilderness he also was preparing the way
[1:17:22] before the Messiah and Jesus said you
[1:17:24] love to walk in his light because he was
[1:17:26] that light bright and Shining Light but
[1:17:29] he says in John he said now I must
[1:17:32] decrease my light must go out because
[1:17:35] why I have served my time that's
[1:17:37] prophesied of me he ye him he's the one
[1:17:40] follow him it living in that day it
[1:17:43] proved this that's why we don't take
[1:17:46] away from what people believe brother
[1:17:48] says you come up to a denominational
[1:17:50] believer build on what they have that's
[1:17:52] right don't break it all down if all
[1:17:55] they know is I've accepted Jesus Christ
[1:17:57] as my savior build on that and say have
[1:18:01] you been baptized in the name of the
[1:18:02] Lord Jesus Christ if they've been
[1:18:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:05] Christ take them on to the Holy Ghost
[1:18:07] and say have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:18:09] since you've been
[1:18:10] baptized and if You' got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:12] has your life been completely changed
[1:18:14] don't tear it down but take the even the
[1:18:16] smallest bit of Truth they've got and
[1:18:18] build on it because they've got a truth
[1:18:20] that was Truth for its day but it's not
[1:18:22] the full truth now now cuz the word has
[1:18:23] continued to
[1:18:25] move the word keeps moving because it's
[1:18:28] opening up it's bringing us into the
[1:18:31] fullness that's bringing us into the
[1:18:32] maturity of what God wants for this age
[1:18:35] amen he says now the Jews thought they
[1:18:37] were worshiping in the True Light they
[1:18:39] thought they were worshiping this same
[1:18:41] God that they were turning down the very
[1:18:43] one that they thought they were
[1:18:44] worshiping they were crucifying they
[1:18:46] were making fun of the very God and
[1:18:48] making him a laughing stock of the
[1:18:49] people the very God that they thought
[1:18:51] that they were worshiping
[1:18:53] we look around this message and the
[1:18:55] first thing that Believers had to
[1:18:56] realize was God sent a prophet why
[1:18:59] because you had to recognize where you
[1:19:00] were in
[1:19:01] time and Malachi 45 and 6 and Revelation
[1:19:06] 3 and the lat of see and age that was
[1:19:08] all a requirement so we could see where
[1:19:10] we were at and when you realize where
[1:19:13] we're at then that focuses you on the
[1:19:16] word for your day so that you're not
[1:19:18] living in the glare of another age
[1:19:20] you're not resting on the truth of
[1:19:21] another age but you're walking now into
[1:19:23] the fullness of what God has told is
[1:19:26] meant for this age that's why I tell
[1:19:28] people that say well why do you need a
[1:19:29] prophet because he focuses us on where
[1:19:31] God
[1:19:32] is he tells us what's for us so that
[1:19:36] we're not trying to produce a word that
[1:19:38] has nothing to do with our age but we're
[1:19:39] focused on producing the part that
[1:19:41] belongs to us the part that's written
[1:19:42] about us the part where our name's
[1:19:44] written as as a part of our fruit as a
[1:19:47] part of what we're supposed to manifest
[1:19:48] in our time remember what brother Braham
[1:19:50] said he says people are always looking
[1:19:52] at what God did and they're looking
[1:19:54] forward to what God will do but they're
[1:19:55] missing what he's doing right
[1:19:58] now and what happened is we had people
[1:20:01] that came and they said God sent a
[1:20:02] prophet and they preached it for 20
[1:20:04] years and they were happy to say I know
[1:20:06] what time it is scripturally I know the
[1:20:09] season I'm in but they forgot that he
[1:20:11] was just a voice pointing to a
[1:20:14] person that's what he was here to do he
[1:20:17] was preparing a way he was preparing a
[1:20:20] bride to meet the bridegroom and so you
[1:20:23] can sit there and you can be with
[1:20:24] Eleazar all day long but if you never
[1:20:26] get in the temp with Isaac Eleazar won't
[1:20:28] do you any good that's why brother
[1:20:30] Braham had to die this is just my
[1:20:32] personal opinion I believe if he would
[1:20:33] have stayed alive it would have they
[1:20:35] would have created a denomination around
[1:20:36] him whether they wanted to or whether he
[1:20:38] wanted it or not because it was going
[1:20:39] that way remember the deity spirit and
[1:20:42] it just went from him to his son we've
[1:20:44] already seen the results of that it's
[1:20:46] absolutely a
[1:20:48] denomination but he had to decrease why
[1:20:51] he had fulfilled his script scriptural
[1:20:53] purpose and he was done seals are
[1:20:57] open he's handed her off to the
[1:21:00] bridegroom he said my message is to
[1:21:02] declare him that he's
[1:21:04] here not that a prophet's here that the
[1:21:08] son of man is here he said I'm a son of
[1:21:10] man I'm a prophet declaring the son of
[1:21:12] man revealing the son of man that's what
[1:21:14] he was here he was doing a handoff and
[1:21:16] so we have Believers that have stuck
[1:21:18] with God sent a prophet and guess what
[1:21:20] church they can repeat Doctrine like you
[1:21:23] wouldn't believe they can explain
[1:21:25] everything like you wouldn't believe and
[1:21:27] the problem is they never moved on to
[1:21:29] Christ they fell in love with the
[1:21:31] prophet's message rather than the person
[1:21:33] of the prophet's
[1:21:35] message it's true I've met them I've
[1:21:38] seen them I know them I pray God's grace
[1:21:41] to those people but they're stuck in the
[1:21:43] glare of this message that has since
[1:21:46] moved on into a true relationship with
[1:21:49] Christ the true baptism of the Holy
[1:21:50] Ghost the fullness of the opening of the
[1:21:52] word Amen brother bah didn't come to
[1:21:53] teach us some message
[1:21:56] catechism I I don't mean to be you know
[1:22:00] sacriligious but repeating this message
[1:22:02] is not what makes you a
[1:22:04] Christian being able to explain Doctrine
[1:22:07] is not what makes you a member of the
[1:22:08] bride of Christ that has nothing to do
[1:22:11] with it you ought to know where you
[1:22:12] stand but sitting here saying da d da d
[1:22:15] da d da and paragraph so and so that
[1:22:17] does not make us a believer that just
[1:22:19] means we can read and we have a
[1:22:21] memory cuz the pr could do
[1:22:23] that and they were white at sepers they
[1:22:26] were sons of the devil so that's not
[1:22:28] going to do it and we've turned this
[1:22:29] message into a Catholic thing where we
[1:22:31] just repeat things rather than we live
[1:22:33] things
[1:22:35] amen but that Prophet came to reveal
[1:22:37] Christ with us so that we'd recognize
[1:22:39] him and we'd accept him into our lives
[1:22:41] and he said you're supposed to do the
[1:22:43] same things I'm doing not in the same
[1:22:45] level cuz he's a prophetic gift he's a
[1:22:48] special vessel he's anointed to do those
[1:22:50] things but yet we're supposed to produce
[1:22:52] the same word that he did amen like John
[1:22:54] the Baptist had to die it had to make
[1:22:56] way for the person of the word so that
[1:22:58] he could have the preeminence and so
[1:23:00] what happens is we haven't moved on some
[1:23:02] people haven't moved on because we're
[1:23:04] supposed to come into that second book
[1:23:05] of Acts where we are led by the spirit
[1:23:09] that's what I mean by book of Acts see
[1:23:11] we'll focus on the signs and wonders but
[1:23:14] scripture says sons of God are led by
[1:23:15] the spirit of God leadership guidance
[1:23:19] that's the first thing you need
[1:23:21] everything else will follow everything
[1:23:23] else will follow after that get close to
[1:23:25] God brother Ron Spencer I love what he
[1:23:27] says when he talks to ministers young
[1:23:29] ministers starting out he says fall in
[1:23:30] love with Jesus fall in love with Jesus
[1:23:33] and the rest will take care of itself
[1:23:35] the study will come the understanding
[1:23:37] will come fall in love with Jesus and
[1:23:40] the rest will take care of it
[1:23:42] amen what happens you fall in love with
[1:23:45] a prophet instead of the Christ he came
[1:23:46] to introduce you can't get along with
[1:23:49] anybody you can't
[1:23:51] Fellowship
[1:23:53] can't go to church everyone's doing
[1:23:55] something wrong nobody's doing it right
[1:23:57] nobody's doing it your way and you end
[1:23:58] up sitting at home with nothing it's the
[1:24:01] truth because what nobody's preaching
[1:24:04] what they used to preach 30 years ago
[1:24:06] and that's the only place you're
[1:24:07] comfortable is a 30-y old
[1:24:10] message I'm not sure who I'm saying this
[1:24:12] to this morning I'll be honest but if we
[1:24:15] can't live it do we really understand it
[1:24:16] the way we mean
[1:24:18] it I don't think so brother Braham says
[1:24:21] just keep walking
[1:24:22] don't stand still you'll never get
[1:24:25] nowhere of course you'll never get
[1:24:27] nowhere if you're standing still but
[1:24:28] sometimes that's literally what we're
[1:24:30] doing Church we're standing still
[1:24:33] because it's comfortable to stand
[1:24:35] still God doesn't let us stand still
[1:24:38] brother said if you're standing still
[1:24:39] you're backsliding why because Christ is
[1:24:41] moving on
[1:24:43] Amen we're talking about our
[1:24:45] walk talking about what Christ is doing
[1:24:48] in our lives he says if you've been
[1:24:49] saved walk to sanctification you say how
[1:24:51] do you get there just keep walking is
[1:24:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost after
[1:24:57] sanctification how do I get that just
[1:24:59] keep walking in the light is signs and
[1:25:01] wonders and miracles just keep walking
[1:25:03] in the light see so often what we're
[1:25:06] saying is I'm looking for the next post
[1:25:08] I'm looking for the next sign I'm
[1:25:10] looking for the next this and that and
[1:25:11] the other he says just keep walking just
[1:25:14] keep walking what happens will happen
[1:25:17] what's meant for you will happen to you
[1:25:19] I keep repeating brother Hank's little
[1:25:21] statement the film has already been
[1:25:22] recorded you just got to keep walking
[1:25:24] and when it needs to happen it'll happen
[1:25:27] just keep walking he says just keep
[1:25:29] walking in the light see just keep on
[1:25:31] every time you make a step the light
[1:25:34] will jump just a little ahead of you he
[1:25:37] says cuz he's always ahead of you he
[1:25:40] don't push he
[1:25:42] leads he says he is the light oh I'm so
[1:25:46] glad of that aren't you he is the light
[1:25:48] and in him there is no Darkness we read
[1:25:51] that scripture that said if if we live
[1:25:52] by the spirit let us walk in the spirit
[1:25:55] in other words let our lives reflect our
[1:25:57] confession Amen Let what we say be what
[1:25:59] we live if we say we believe the message
[1:26:01] let us live the message let this word of
[1:26:03] God come into our lives and shine a
[1:26:05] light around and light is the most uh
[1:26:08] discombobulating thing you can get I
[1:26:10] think in life you know what we don't
[1:26:12] maybe realize it so much but when you're
[1:26:13] on TV or these different things you know
[1:26:16] how much makeup those people are wearing
[1:26:17] men and women alike because why the
[1:26:20] light the harsh lights sit under
[1:26:23] illuminate every
[1:26:25] flaw every crack in the skin every Every
[1:26:29] Little Dot every pimple every
[1:26:31] imperfection under those lights is
[1:26:33] completely highlighted and so what they
[1:26:36] do is they actually have to over paint
[1:26:39] them put way more makeup on them that
[1:26:41] under normal light would look ridiculous
[1:26:44] when they put it under that harsh light
[1:26:46] it actually looks normal because the
[1:26:47] lights are so
[1:26:49] powerful but we sit under the harshness
[1:26:51] of the light of the world word sometimes
[1:26:53] it's embarrassing sometimes isn't it
[1:26:56] when the word comes down and it says
[1:26:59] look at
[1:27:01] that it's
[1:27:04] tough but we've got to do it willingly
[1:27:08] sit there and let the word go to
[1:27:10] Discerning inside in each and every one
[1:27:12] of our Lives Illuminating it the good
[1:27:14] and the bad when it's good we say praise
[1:27:16] the Lord but when it's bad we need to
[1:27:18] say praise the Lord as well because he's
[1:27:20] highlighting it for a purpose'
[1:27:22] amen this is one of my favorite
[1:27:26] scriptures says but all things that are
[1:27:30] reproved are made manifest by the light
[1:27:33] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[1:27:36] light the Amplified and this is a a
[1:27:39] newer version actually says everything
[1:27:41] exposed to light is revealed clearly for
[1:27:44] what it
[1:27:45] is so if it shows bad it's bad if it
[1:27:51] shows good it's good and church if it
[1:27:54] shows there's nothing there guess what
[1:27:56] there's nothing
[1:27:58] there it is what it is and light is what
[1:28:01] proves what's really there
[1:28:04] amen like I said sometimes it's
[1:28:06] embarrassing I remember sitting in in
[1:28:08] Services when we've had visiting
[1:28:10] ministers and and it just felt like God
[1:28:13] came in and just opened the door and
[1:28:15] just put a a 10,000 watt flood light in
[1:28:18] a room and said what about this son
[1:28:22] and you sit there and you feel
[1:28:25] naked but guess what that's what light
[1:28:28] does for a child of God's life it says
[1:28:32] this is the real
[1:28:34] condition you know it's funny I uh I had
[1:28:37] a BMW sports car back in Alberta and
[1:28:40] when I bought it the guy had rubbed it
[1:28:42] along a a a traffic cone and he'd
[1:28:45] scraped up the edge of the edge of the
[1:28:48] uh the door and he put a little crease
[1:28:50] in it
[1:28:52] and when I sold the car I said there's a
[1:28:56] crease in the door you know there's
[1:28:57] there's a flaw on the door but you know
[1:28:59] what I didn't want anybody to do look
[1:29:01] real close at it because it was going to
[1:29:04] cost them a lot more money to fix it
[1:29:07] than they probably
[1:29:08] realized and I just lived with
[1:29:11] it and so when a guy came to look at it
[1:29:13] I took him out for a ride the car was in
[1:29:15] good condition that and I show him the
[1:29:16] door I said now here's here's that spot
[1:29:18] I was looking at and he looked at it and
[1:29:19] he
[1:29:20] said yeah I get rid of that I thought in
[1:29:24] my head no you can't no you can't and if
[1:29:27] he' looked at it in a strong light he'
[1:29:31] to realize there's a flaw there that's
[1:29:32] going to take a lot more
[1:29:34] work that's what the word of God does
[1:29:36] the Discerning of the word of God comes
[1:29:38] in and it says this is deeper than you
[1:29:40] thought there's more here than you
[1:29:43] realized and we're going to have to dig
[1:29:45] deep to fix
[1:29:48] this we like to gloss things over
[1:29:52] smooth it out ah it's just that's a
[1:29:55] family trait you know we this this is
[1:29:57] generational we all have this no no no
[1:30:00] no the word is here to set us free right
[1:30:04] I've said before Satan dwells in shame I
[1:30:07] got a quote it's not here I'll bring it
[1:30:08] next service he said Satan hates light
[1:30:11] Satan and the devil Satan and his demons
[1:30:13] hate light because it exposes them for
[1:30:16] exactly what's going
[1:30:17] on Amen you know what we like to we like
[1:30:22] to gloss over it but the simple fact is
[1:30:24] this if it ain't God it ain't God it's
[1:30:28] that simple and what is it really then
[1:30:30] it's
[1:30:31] carnality Paul said I Die
[1:30:34] daily and if the prophet of the age if
[1:30:36] the first church age Messer had to Die
[1:30:38] daily and allow the washing of the water
[1:30:40] of the word the light of the word the
[1:30:42] working of the holy spirit in his life
[1:30:43] how much more do you and I need it amen
[1:30:46] every single day that we've got to be
[1:30:48] able to say Lord just let the light
[1:30:50] shine in our lives
[1:30:52] but I'll tell you this I'm going to give
[1:30:54] you a pat on the back this morning you
[1:30:56] know what I love about this
[1:30:58] church how many times I'll walk out
[1:31:02] those doors and somebody come up to me
[1:31:04] and say that's exactly where I am that's
[1:31:07] exactly what I needed that's exactly
[1:31:09] what I've been dealing with and you
[1:31:11] don't try and
[1:31:14] hide that shows a maturity that shows an
[1:31:17] honesty that shows a sincerity I have
[1:31:20] prayed for people with needs that I
[1:31:22] don't know how in the world they had the
[1:31:24] courage to come up and talk about it but
[1:31:26] I say God bless you I say God bless you
[1:31:29] because that's what it's going to
[1:31:33] take that's what it's going to take as a
[1:31:37] people that will humble themselves to
[1:31:40] the word of God and say this is me
[1:31:44] Lord that's me that's where I
[1:31:49] am that's my problem
[1:31:53] now I'm giving it to you for the
[1:31:56] answer I so appreciate that in this
[1:31:59] church it shows real character in the
[1:32:01] people don't lose that there's no
[1:32:03] embarrassment you come up for prayer I
[1:32:06] don't tell a soul I don't talk to my
[1:32:09] wife I don't talk to my Minister friends
[1:32:12] I don't talk to anybody it's between me
[1:32:14] and you and God don't ever think it's
[1:32:16] going to come out but don't ever lose
[1:32:19] that simple sincerity and honesty before
[1:32:23] God because that's what this preaching
[1:32:25] of the word is supposed to do it's
[1:32:27] supposed to be a discerner of the
[1:32:29] thoughts and intents of the
[1:32:31] heart to what get you into True Light to
[1:32:36] get you into word condition to get you
[1:32:37] into rapturing
[1:32:40] condition and some people have run from
[1:32:43] that oh so and so told Brother John or
[1:32:46] this no no no that's the Holy Spirit God
[1:32:49] is my witness God is my witness this
[1:32:51] morning if you can't handle the Holy
[1:32:54] Spirit Discerning things in your life
[1:32:55] you need to leave cuz it'll be judgment
[1:32:58] if you keep sitting here God's grace to
[1:33:01] us a one every one of us amen I'm not
[1:33:04] talking about little things I'm talking
[1:33:07] about big things not complimentary
[1:33:09] things people that have serious serious
[1:33:11] issues and when the word Goes Forth they
[1:33:14] step up to it and they say I want that I
[1:33:17] want to live where that is I shared this
[1:33:20] quote in the in the in the church
[1:33:23] WhatsApp group there but I know not all
[1:33:25] of us are on
[1:33:27] there brother Braham said this the very
[1:33:29] first step to successful Christianity
[1:33:32] how many want to be successful in their
[1:33:33] Christian walk amen and to show that man
[1:33:37] has receive the holy spirit is h u m i l
[1:33:42] i t y
[1:33:45] humility he says it's humility real
[1:33:49] god-given humility that it must be given
[1:33:53] humbly cuz there's a man-made humility
[1:33:55] there's a false humility and there's a
[1:33:57] real god-given
[1:33:59] humility what is it it's a surrender to
[1:34:03] what the word says you
[1:34:04] are so that you can become what the word
[1:34:07] says you
[1:34:08] are cuz we're in a condition here we're
[1:34:10] not in rapturing condition yet we're
[1:34:13] getting ready and that means there's
[1:34:14] bumps it means there's flaws it means
[1:34:16] there's faults it means there's there's
[1:34:18] isms and little things that have caught
[1:34:20] on to our lives amen but we've got to be
[1:34:22] able to say in order to get there I've
[1:34:24] got to realize I'm not there and when
[1:34:26] the light comes in it's to move us the
[1:34:28] next step forward that's what the
[1:34:30] light's doing remember he says as you
[1:34:31] come to here the light moves forward and
[1:34:33] says all right come here and you got to
[1:34:35] step there and to step there you got to
[1:34:36] realize you can't stay where you were
[1:34:38] the step is a changing of position it's
[1:34:40] a changing of your order it's a changing
[1:34:42] of your placing so you got to keep
[1:34:45] walking as the light moves and you step
[1:34:48] there and then it reveals another thing
[1:34:50] and another thing and another thing
[1:34:52] this this big step of a Rapture is many
[1:34:54] tiny little steps church and we've got
[1:34:56] to take them day by day like I've said
[1:34:58] before if you think there's just going
[1:34:59] to be this sudden massive swell of the
[1:35:01] Holy Spirit and all of us will leave I
[1:35:03] this is my opinion I believe you're
[1:35:04] sincerely wrong because I believe that
[1:35:06] we're being caught up day by day just a
[1:35:08] little bit more just a little bit more
[1:35:11] and that last step will be the littlest
[1:35:12] and it'll be the easiest it'll just seem
[1:35:14] a natural thing like Enoch he just
[1:35:17] started walking and one day he started
[1:35:19] walking I can't do it cuz I'm not eating
[1:35:21] but he started walking and when his foot
[1:35:23] went to there it didn't go to the
[1:35:27] ground oh that's firm ground and then
[1:35:29] the other folk came up and he just kept
[1:35:31] walking walking walking into the
[1:35:32] presence of God in a moment in the
[1:35:34] twinkling of an eye we'll catch it and
[1:35:35] we'll say this is it and we'll be
[1:35:39] gone but what this coming into the light
[1:35:42] is a willful act we've got to do that
[1:35:45] we've got to step into it amen not
[1:35:46] shrink away from it Paul said in
[1:35:49] Ephesians he says for ye were sometimes
[1:35:51] and Darkness but now are ye light in the
[1:35:53] Lord walk as children of
[1:35:58] light Live Like You're a Believer live
[1:36:01] like you're a Christian Live Like You're
[1:36:02] Christ because that's what you are don't
[1:36:05] talk it only but live it don't muck
[1:36:07] around with Darkness run to the light
[1:36:09] and stay there brother brah said and
[1:36:11] God's got the Holy Ghost tonight for
[1:36:13] every believer that wants to receive
[1:36:15] it we've got anointed preachers in the
[1:36:17] land that preaches it daily and nightly
[1:36:19] but it's the people's own stubborn way
[1:36:22] that they love Darkness better than
[1:36:24] light that they'd rather live in the
[1:36:26] world than to walk in the light walk in
[1:36:28] the Gospel Light he says oh people you
[1:36:30] don't know what a pleasure it is to walk
[1:36:32] in the light the light of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:34] and have fellowship with him it's glory
[1:36:36] Divine to have fellowship with the Holy
[1:36:39] Spirit catch this now you cannot have
[1:36:42] fellowship with the world and with the
[1:36:43] Holy Spirit at the same
[1:36:46] time can I read it again you cannot have
[1:36:50] fellowship with the world world and with
[1:36:51] the Holy Spirit at the same time you've
[1:36:54] got to abstain from the things of the
[1:36:56] world what does that look like brother
[1:36:58] John live clean honorable upright and
[1:37:01] holy and then the holy spirit will dwell
[1:37:04] with you and will work with you what
[1:37:07] does that look like he will perform
[1:37:09] Miracles through you he will heal you
[1:37:13] give you joy peace and love and
[1:37:15] longsuffering goodness gentleness
[1:37:17] patience and faith if you will walk in
[1:37:20] God's way there's plenty of holy
[1:37:23] spirit
[1:37:25] amen who wants God to do more in their
[1:37:29] life live
[1:37:31] clean abstain set it aside don't muck
[1:37:36] around with
[1:37:37] it don't dabble in it don't try and
[1:37:40] sanctify it it is what it is church
[1:37:44] leave it
[1:37:46] alone God help us to stay
[1:37:48] separated God help us to keep coming
[1:37:50] back here
[1:37:51] feeding on this amen there's a fountain
[1:37:54] open amen an unending Supply and it's
[1:37:57] clean all the time you'll never get
[1:37:59] filthy with
[1:38:00] this it'll never do you harm it's always
[1:38:03] for your good and it'll always bring you
[1:38:05] closer to God Amen stay with that and
[1:38:08] you'll start to see the good things of
[1:38:09] God coming through in your life feed on
[1:38:12] the right things fellowship with the
[1:38:13] right people dwell on the right things
[1:38:16] it's bound to produce amen God help us
[1:38:18] to welcome that light of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:20] moving in our lives
[1:38:22] brother John Andy shared this quotee a
[1:38:23] little earlier in the week and I told
[1:38:25] him I was going to put it in the service
[1:38:26] he says you might go through life living
[1:38:27] a good Christian Life you might belong
[1:38:30] to some church you might have a fine
[1:38:31] membership you might be a moral
[1:38:33] character and all of that but brother
[1:38:35] that still is in Christianity
[1:38:37] Christianity is when the Holy Ghost has
[1:38:39] taken full possession of you and you're
[1:38:42] led by the Holy
[1:38:44] Spirit that's bringing down to rubber
[1:38:46] meets the road isn't it when the Holy
[1:38:49] Spirit has taken full possession of of
[1:38:51] you and you're led by
[1:38:54] it we're going to talk about this a
[1:38:56] little more on Wednesday night Lord
[1:38:57] willing about what it looks like when
[1:38:59] the Holy Spirit leads us when we live in
[1:39:00] that light day by day because we're in
[1:39:02] the darkest time in history remember
[1:39:04] when brother bam Drew out when the angel
[1:39:06] sorry Drew out the seven Church ages
[1:39:08] when he came to the seventh brother Bram
[1:39:10] said it was complete
[1:39:12] darkness when the angel drew it there
[1:39:14] was no light in
[1:39:16] leoa and brother Braham says I added in
[1:39:19] a little bit to represent what the bride
[1:39:22] but the angel didn't put it there there
[1:39:24] was no light and I believe that's a
[1:39:26] reflection of what happens to the bride
[1:39:27] she's taken out of it amen but there is
[1:39:32] so little light here it's a gross
[1:39:36] darkness and all we've got is a little
[1:39:38] light each one now if you're in a little
[1:39:40] room with a little light that'll do okay
[1:39:45] but when you're in a big world with a
[1:39:47] little light that light is almost
[1:39:49] useless people can see the light light
[1:39:51] but that's about it that's all we're
[1:39:53] trying to be is a little light just a
[1:39:55] little light so people can come and say
[1:39:57] how'd you get that how come you're
[1:39:59] different than I am you know it gets
[1:40:01] uncomfortable in life you know the more
[1:40:04] we spend at work and we've got to be
[1:40:06] back two days a week and that you spend
[1:40:07] time around with people you realize very
[1:40:09] quickly we are not the
[1:40:11] same and it gets very uncomfortable at
[1:40:14] times because even if you don't say
[1:40:16] anything your life is such a contrast to
[1:40:19] what they think is right to what they
[1:40:21] think is good and it can be
[1:40:23] uncomfortable because they're talking
[1:40:24] about things and they're doing things
[1:40:26] and they're looking at you and they're
[1:40:27] saying oh right John doesn't do that
[1:40:29] brother Bob doesn't do that brother
[1:40:31] Grant doesn't do
[1:40:33] that right and it puts you in awkward
[1:40:36] positions and we've got to have courage
[1:40:37] to still be the light to not shrink back
[1:40:40] to not dial the wick down turn it up
[1:40:44] turn it up you know I I if nothing else
[1:40:47] people ought to be able to look at our
[1:40:49] families and see there's a benefit to
[1:40:50] being the way they are cuz almost
[1:40:52] everybody now agrees sorry young
[1:40:55] people that we're we're really sliding
[1:40:57] downhill quickly that Society is sliding
[1:41:00] down quickly and they love the fact that
[1:41:02] they can see young men and women that
[1:41:04] can be honest that can be
[1:41:06] polite that can be
[1:41:09] sane cannot give their parents a ton of
[1:41:12] trouble that aren going around getting
[1:41:14] pregnant at 15 16 17 all these different
[1:41:19] things they can look at that and they
[1:41:21] can say they're different but they've
[1:41:23] got some benefits to that we have not to
[1:41:25] shrink from those things I'm proud I'm
[1:41:28] proud of my daughter I'm proud of what
[1:41:30] my boys are doing and Jonathan as he
[1:41:31] grows up in these different things and I
[1:41:33] talk to people about it so that they can
[1:41:34] see we're different they see I'm
[1:41:37] different but I want them to see this is
[1:41:39] not just a generational thing this is a
[1:41:41] God thing amen that the light can be lit
[1:41:43] in a young person just as much as it can
[1:41:45] an older person
[1:41:47] amen but we've got to let it happen
[1:41:52] Moses saw a light from a distance he saw
[1:41:54] a fire burning and he went up to see
[1:41:57] what it was and then God called him
[1:41:59] closer and Moses had to willingly walk
[1:42:03] close to that fire and God revealed some
[1:42:06] things about
[1:42:07] Moses cuz you'll notice Moses starts to
[1:42:09] see his flaws and failures in that light
[1:42:12] but here's the thing Church it never
[1:42:15] stopped God lord I
[1:42:19] stutter doesn't matter I'll give you a
[1:42:22] mouthpiece Lord I this doesn't matter
[1:42:25] I've made a way Lord I that doesn't
[1:42:27] matter Moses just go in my word in my
[1:42:31] strength I'll take care of it Lord I'm
[1:42:34] just a shepherd with a staff let me use
[1:42:36] the staff you got then let me show you
[1:42:39] what I can do with a staff when I start
[1:42:41] using it instead of you start using it
[1:42:43] Moses and Moses never got in trouble
[1:42:45] until he started using that staff for
[1:42:47] his own will when he let God use it God
[1:42:50] used that staff staff to deliver a
[1:42:51] people out of a out of a country that
[1:42:53] was far greater than they
[1:42:55] were brother Braham says it this way he
[1:42:57] says why brother if we'd ever come in
[1:42:58] the presence of God like Moses did why
[1:43:01] it was revolutionary to him in the light
[1:43:04] of that angel of God standing there on
[1:43:06] that mountain that day everything he
[1:43:08] once had or thought never would happen
[1:43:11] come to be a reality Moses knew he was a
[1:43:15] deliverer or Moses thought he was a
[1:43:17] deliver Moses been told he was a
[1:43:19] Believer Moses has been told told he
[1:43:21] would had a purpose and then he tried to
[1:43:22] make it happen and it all just fell it
[1:43:24] crumbled he made a mess of things and
[1:43:26] now he's out for 40 years running for
[1:43:28] his life in the backside of the
[1:43:30] desert but when he comes into that
[1:43:32] presence all of a sudden God makes a
[1:43:35] reality the things that Moses had been
[1:43:36] told and
[1:43:38] believed but it came into the
[1:43:41] light to reveal that God said now I'm
[1:43:45] going to go with
[1:43:47] you sometimes we hear so much over the
[1:43:50] pulpit and in the reading of our Bible
[1:43:51] or the listening to the message and we
[1:43:53] say well I ought to do this and I ought
[1:43:54] to do that no get in his
[1:43:56] presence and everything that you need to
[1:43:58] do will follow afterwards
[1:44:00] everything because God's got to go with
[1:44:02] you God's got to send you God's got to
[1:44:04] be with you and if he's not with you
[1:44:05] you're not going to get anywhere you're
[1:44:07] going to be dead in the water making a
[1:44:09] mess of
[1:44:10] things he says everything he once had or
[1:44:14] thought would happen come to be a
[1:44:15] reality and I think if men and women
[1:44:17] today would ever step into the light of
[1:44:19] the Holy Spirit under the unction of
[1:44:21] God's spirit and the light of God's word
[1:44:25] everything that's an absolute Church
[1:44:27] everything that God has promised will
[1:44:30] illuminate to you and be real again amen
[1:44:34] let's stand together if the musicians
[1:44:35] would
[1:44:37] come he says we've got to come into that
[1:44:39] light
[1:44:41] church and our prayer time devotions and
[1:44:44] service wherever it is we've got to come
[1:44:46] in and we've got to be honest before
[1:44:48] God we've got to come in and say Lord
[1:44:50] Lord here I
[1:44:51] am here I am such as I
[1:44:55] am not make
[1:44:58] excuses you can say Lord I got a stutter
[1:45:02] Lord I have trouble talking to people
[1:45:03] about you Lord I clam up when people ask
[1:45:06] me about this and that and the other
[1:45:07] thing Lord I'm struggling to fellowship
[1:45:10] with that brother and sister Lord I'm
[1:45:11] struggling with the ministry Lord I'm
[1:45:13] struggling with my parents Lord I'm
[1:45:14] struggling with my attitude I know what
[1:45:16] I think on a daily basis Church it ain't
[1:45:18] always good I know the thoughts I have I
[1:45:21] know the preconceived notions I have and
[1:45:24] I've got to be able to take that into my
[1:45:25] prayer with God and sayl here's the
[1:45:29] lumps but what I'm hoping he'll see is
[1:45:32] my
[1:45:33] heart that in all of those lumps and all
[1:45:36] of that carnality and all of those
[1:45:38] failures is a heart that desires to
[1:45:39] serve him and so I don't hide but I
[1:45:42] bring it into the light if I know
[1:45:44] there's a problem I've got to bring it
[1:45:45] into the
[1:45:47] light but if I won't bring it then he'll
[1:45:49] send the word and the world will bring a
[1:45:51] light no matter what but if we can come
[1:45:53] in and say Lord I'm trusting you'll look
[1:45:54] at my heart and realize I don't want to
[1:45:56] be like this Lord I don't want to do
[1:45:58] this I don't want to have this attitude
[1:46:00] I don't want to have this problem I
[1:46:03] don't want to have this
[1:46:04] friction then he's bound to come down
[1:46:06] and say I'll take that out let the light
[1:46:08] come in clear it all
[1:46:11] out you know I don't think we have this
[1:46:14] because we have wonderful house wives
[1:46:16] that that that keep our homes clean but
[1:46:19] sometimes we have a closet
[1:46:22] and we just throw things in the closet
[1:46:23] the rooms are spectacular but sometimes
[1:46:26] we have the closet and anything that
[1:46:28] doesn't have a place we put in the
[1:46:31] closet and you know what we'll find we
[1:46:33] have a lot of things that don't have a
[1:46:34] place and so we throw them into the
[1:46:36] closet and what happens we've got one of
[1:46:39] these we call it a storage
[1:46:42] closet but it's really a a
[1:46:44] jumble of
[1:46:46] things and so what happens eventually is
[1:46:48] you get tired of looking at it so you un
[1:46:50] screw the light bulb so nobody knows
[1:46:51] what's in there and you just throw
[1:46:53] things in
[1:46:56] blindly and then what happens one day is
[1:46:58] you forget how bad it is and you send
[1:47:01] somebody down to get something from
[1:47:02] there and they open the door and it all
[1:47:03] tumbles out and it hits
[1:47:05] them you know what sometimes we're
[1:47:07] walking through life and somebody opens
[1:47:10] our closet door and a bunch of bumps and
[1:47:13] lumps hit them don't
[1:47:15] they and we say oops forgot about that
[1:47:19] it's just God shine a light
[1:47:21] church just God saying come on
[1:47:24] now there's no place for that in your
[1:47:26] life why you even storing it get rid of
[1:47:29] it if it doesn't have a place now it'll
[1:47:32] never have a place in the future because
[1:47:33] you're going to grow and mature if
[1:47:35] there's no place for it now just get rid
[1:47:37] of it deal with
[1:47:38] it then sometimes the room is already
[1:47:42] it's there it's
[1:47:44] clean it's just no good because we have
[1:47:46] nothing in there an empty room does us
[1:47:48] no good
[1:47:51] sometimes God's got to show the light to
[1:47:52] say hey let's put something in this room
[1:47:54] let's make it useful let's take this
[1:47:56] part of your life that you've cleaned
[1:47:58] out now and let's put something in here
[1:48:00] that'll be a benefit to the body of
[1:48:01] Believers let's add something in that'll
[1:48:03] help somebody on their Journey you know
[1:48:05] in our house we've got that little Suite
[1:48:06] downstairs where visitors and ministers
[1:48:09] stay in that sometimes that's what we
[1:48:11] need as a place for somebody else in our
[1:48:12] life where they can come in and take a
[1:48:14] rest when they're in our presence when
[1:48:16] they're around us that they can get
[1:48:18] something from us that they can't get
[1:48:19] from anybody else but it takes the light
[1:48:20] of the Holy Spirit to turn that on and
[1:48:22] say hey let's start adding in now your
[1:48:25] life's clean you're good let's start
[1:48:27] adding in let's start Furnishing the
[1:48:29] dwelling place for the benefit of the
[1:48:31] body of Believers in our life
[1:48:32] amen Church the key is don't shrink from
[1:48:35] light don't step
[1:48:38] back sometimes it's like I said it's
[1:48:40] embarrassing it hurts it's
[1:48:41] painful we say I ought not to even be
[1:48:44] dealing with this I'm so far up the road
[1:48:46] and yet I still deal with this or I I
[1:48:47] deal with this now don't shrink from
[1:48:49] that
[1:48:50] say Lord here I am
[1:48:52] again you've dealt with me
[1:48:55] before deal with me now let the light do
[1:48:58] its work and bring forth what the life
[1:49:01] of the word of Christ inside of you

[1:49:05] heads Heavenly

[1:49:16] morning and Lord I'm trusting that that
[1:49:19] atmosphere is going to move in
[1:49:22] hearts Lord that we won't pull back from
[1:49:24] where your word shines a
[1:49:27] light Lord when it seems like everything
[1:49:29] is bare before you where there's no
[1:49:31] hiding Lord that we would not put on a
[1:49:33] religious garment a religious spirit
