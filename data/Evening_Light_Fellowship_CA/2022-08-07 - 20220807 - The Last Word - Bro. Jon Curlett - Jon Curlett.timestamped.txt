[50:48] lord jesus
[50:49] the lord we know there's a a time
[50:51] there's a road between now and then that
[50:53] we have to walk so lord we pray you give
[50:55] us strength for the journey this morning
[50:57] lord that lord if we've wandered off to
[50:59] the left or right that you bring us back
[51:01] to the center of the road heavenly
[51:02] father to that highway of holiness lord
[51:04] jesus may you just draw us closer to you
[51:07] in this service lord lift us up to a
[51:09] higher plane lord take us into deeper
[51:11] depths of your love lord
[51:13] of greater revelation lord in our lives
[51:15] that would hold us against the enemy we
[51:17] pray
[51:18] lord touch your people once again we ask
[51:21] in jesus christ's name we pray
[51:23] amen amen thank you musicians that will
[51:25] be it this morning if you'll turn the
[51:26] scriptures to isaiah 55
[51:30] and then isaiah 55
[51:32] and certainly good to have
[51:36] delfina back she's not here this this
[51:37] morning but she's back we want to
[51:39] remember to pray for her as she starts
[51:40] to think about where she's going to live
[51:42] when she's done her school she'll be
[51:44] here for one semester i believe and then
[51:46] after that she's got to decide does she
[51:48] stay here does she go somewhere else
[51:49] does she go back home does she go to bc
[51:52] or these different places so we want the
[51:54] lord to lead her amen i remember when i
[51:57] left newfoundland and i met with brother
[51:58] gerald and we talked for two hours and
[52:00] we got down and we prayed together and
[52:02] we believed the lord led us didn't we
[52:03] brother gerald even when he led us away
[52:06] we believed he let us amen and we know
[52:08] that he brought me back but we always
[52:09] want the lord's will we don't want to
[52:10] hold things too tightly and then we want
[52:12] him to have his way in to take her to
[52:14] where she can grow where she can mature
[52:16] where she can be best fit into a body
[52:18] where she can have a real effect amen i
[52:20] see we've got a new family here i think
[52:22] it's brother joe and sister priscilla
[52:24] amen good to have them back
[52:26] amen they've been gone so long i'm not
[52:28] sure if it's them but by their fruits
[52:29] we'll know them amen that it was brother
[52:31] joe and sister priscilla that returned
[52:33] to us amen brother chad and sister lee
[52:34] also back from vacation and then good to
[52:36] have them back as well
[52:39] amen
[52:41] yes brother joe says remember the saints
[52:43] in central with the fires they've got a
[52:45] state of emergency there and beta spare
[52:47] highway's been opened and closed a
[52:49] number of times but things are very dry
[52:51] there it's been very hot so we
[52:52] definitely want to remember not only the
[52:54] saints there but everyone there amen
[52:56] amen but certainly remember the saints
[52:58] that god would preserve their lives
[52:59] preserve their property amen that he
[53:01] bring rain and bring those fires under
[53:03] control amen isaiah 55 and verse 9 says
[53:07] for as the heavens are higher than the
[53:08] earth
[53:10] so are my ways higher than your ways
[53:14] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[53:17] for as the rain cometh down
[53:19] and the snow from heaven
[53:22] and returneth not thither but watereth
[53:24] the earth
[53:25] and make it it to bring forth and bud
[53:27] that it may give seed to the sower and
[53:30] bread to the eater
[53:31] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[53:34] of my mouth
[53:46] it shall not return
[53:49] unto me
[53:50] void
[53:52] amen but it shall accomplish that which
[53:55] i please
[53:57] and it shall prosper in a thing
[54:00] where unto or where to
[54:02] i sent it
[54:04] amen god bless you can have your seats
[54:06] this morning what a beautiful scripture
[54:08] to start with this morning amen amen not
[54:10] just promise but it's prophecy amen
[54:13] amen i can think of no greater promise
[54:16] in the word of god where when he says
[54:19] when god speaks it's going to happen
[54:21] amen that once it leaves his lips that
[54:23] when the thoughts of god are expressed
[54:25] then it cannot return to him without
[54:26] achieving that which he sent it out amen
[54:29] isaiah 55 in a nutshell says when god
[54:31] says it it's going to happen and you can
[54:33] take it to the bank amen i'm taking a
[54:35] bit of a different direction this
[54:36] morning we're going to leave our
[54:38] regularly scheduled program and i want
[54:40] to speak this morning on the last word
[54:43] amen now today when we think of you know
[54:45] somebody getting the last word when
[54:46] you're in a discussion with somebody so
[54:48] often the goal if we were to be honest
[54:50] is to get the last word isn't it if
[54:52] you're in an argument with somebody if
[54:53] you're having a disagreement the idea is
[54:55] that whoever gets the last word is going
[54:58] to win amen amen and that's not what we
[55:00] want to do as believers amen but that's
[55:02] often what our carnal minds would want
[55:04] to say is if i can get the last word
[55:06] then i'm going to show them who won and
[55:07] who really knows most and this and that
[55:09] the other thing and you know when it
[55:10] comes to the last word there was an
[55:12] infamous incident that happened at
[55:13] philly and gardens about 25 years ago on
[55:15] the soccer field if you remember
[55:18] where the brothers
[55:19] of bible believers association took on
[55:21] the young men
[55:22] of bible believers association
[55:25] and this incident was caught on video if
[55:27] you remember
[55:28] and what happened was there was a young
[55:29] slugger named jonathan corletta
[55:32] at the home plate and he hit a pitch and
[55:35] it went about just over second base
[55:38] and he was a fast runner but there was a
[55:40] fast thrower there around second and
[55:42] when that man threw that ball to first
[55:44] it was a very close call that was made
[55:46] there and of course all of those behind
[55:48] jonathan curlett's slugging team said
[55:50] he's safe
[55:51] and all of the older brothers said he's
[55:54] out
[55:56] and the question was who was going to
[55:57] get the last word
[55:59] amen and this went down in infamy in
[56:01] newfoundland history we know because
[56:02] they called me out
[56:04] and we disagreed heavily with that but
[56:06] the truth is in those games there's only
[56:08] one umpire and it's the adults isn't it
[56:11] the adults were the ones that got the
[56:12] last word now we've we've held long that
[56:16] that i was safe there but i will have to
[56:17] admit that i did review the footage last
[56:19] year sometime and i was indeed out
[56:23] amen they had the last word and were
[56:25] lucky that they were right but for many
[56:27] years we held a grudge against them
[56:28] because they were the ones that had the
[56:30] last word
[56:31] and they called us out in that game and
[56:33] i believe we lost that game on account
[56:34] of that call
[56:36] so
[56:37] no doubt there was much judgment called
[56:38] down on them in our prayers that night
[56:40] amen
[56:41] but the thing is whoever gets the last
[56:43] word that's the one that holds the power
[56:45] and that's the one that holds the
[56:46] authority so often amen many times we're
[56:48] in a situation perhaps you get into one
[56:50] and and perhaps i've been on the bad
[56:52] side of this where somebody's doing all
[56:53] the talking
[56:55] and you've got something you want to say
[56:57] and it's one thing if you agree with
[56:58] them but if you disagree with them and
[56:59] they're dominating the conversation it's
[57:02] really hard to sit there because you
[57:03] can't get any word in i mean they're
[57:05] dominating it they've got so much that
[57:07] they've got to say and really what's
[57:08] happening is if somebody else is
[57:09] speaking they're sitting there waiting
[57:11] for that person to take a breath so they
[57:13] can get right back in and either
[57:14] interrupt them or start speaking yet
[57:16] again
[57:17] and then they always want the last word
[57:19] and there's nothing so satisfying again
[57:21] in our carnality as when that person
[57:23] takes a pause to maybe hydrate their
[57:25] parts throat from talking so much and
[57:27] you jump in and you expound on
[57:29] everything that you have that that that
[57:31] refutes their argument and then you say
[57:33] i've got to go now.
[57:35] and you walk away having gotten the last
[57:37] word having destroyed their argument at
[57:39] least in your own mind and you walk away
[57:41] and you've got the last word and there's
[57:42] a deep sense of satisfaction that comes
[57:44] from that
[57:46] if you've ever been in a debate you know
[57:48] the satisfaction that comes from
[57:49] dismantling somebody's argument and then
[57:51] being able to walk away with them being
[57:52] able to offer a rebuttal kind of as you
[57:55] you know you're getting in your car and
[57:56] you just as you're about to close the
[57:57] door you say one last thing that seals
[57:59] it and then you drive away and they
[58:00] can't ever come back and talk to you
[58:02] anymore
[58:03] and that's when we're the speaker but so
[58:04] often we're in the audience and if you
[58:06] look at a debate
[58:07] so many times if you look at a court
[58:09] case if you've noticed the defense
[58:10] always gets to go last if they want
[58:12] because it's the last opportunity to
[58:14] influence the jury it's the last
[58:16] opportunity to influence the judge with
[58:18] their case and so what happens so often
[58:19] is they'll jockey to try and get that
[58:21] last that last word in especially again
[58:24] in debates because the person that
[58:25] speaks last gets to leave the greatest
[58:27] impression usually they get to override
[58:29] the evidence that has been brought forth
[58:31] perhaps they get to leave in your mind
[58:33] the points that highlight the strengths
[58:34] of their case while dismissing the
[58:36] things that would take away from their
[58:38] case they get to highlight from a
[58:39] position of strength having put aside
[58:42] all of the weaknesses that the other
[58:43] person has tried to put in them amen but
[58:45] the thing is when it comes to the
[58:46] audience listening because we are an
[58:48] audience listening amen as the bride of
[58:49] christ and then regardless of who goes
[58:51] last the audience the jury has to decide
[58:54] who they're going to believe which voice
[58:56] they're going to heed which one makes
[58:57] the most sense which one brought the
[58:59] most truth which one held closest to the
[59:01] facts that would
[59:02] approach the story that they've tried to
[59:04] present amen and they've listened and
[59:06] they've regarded each argument and point
[59:08] and when it's all said and done they've
[59:09] got to make a decision on which word
[59:11] they're going to believe amen and as
[59:13] believers we're listening to voices that
[59:15] have been speaking for over 6 000 years
[59:18] amen and there's only two sets of voices
[59:20] there's god's voice and then there's
[59:21] everybody else there's god's voice and
[59:24] then there's everybody else amen you
[59:26] only have one side to pick but one side
[59:28] has many voices and one side has one
[59:30] voice amen because satan will come at
[59:32] you from so many different angles with
[59:34] so many approaches there's so many
[59:35] people with so many temptations with so
[59:37] many points of logic and education and
[59:40] experience and god only comes at you
[59:42] with one voice and that is the word of
[59:43] god amen he only comes to you with one
[59:45] thing but satan will come at you with
[59:47] many things and as they say in in law
[59:49] they say they're trying to prove by a
[59:51] preponderance of evidence by an
[59:53] overwhelming weight of evidence which
[59:54] one is right and god's sitting there and
[59:56] he just reads from the same playbook
[59:58] over and over and over again and satan's
[1:00:00] trying to keep bringing things over and
[1:00:02] over again from as many places as he can
[1:00:04] draw from to try and get us to believe
[1:00:06] his word amen now my title this morning
[1:00:09] is the last word and the question i want
[1:00:10] to ask is who is getting the last word
[1:00:13] in your life amen i want to go back to
[1:00:15] our opening scripture and take it from
[1:00:16] the beginning of isaiah 55 this morning
[1:00:19] and just stay here for a little bit if
[1:00:20] you would and it says ho
[1:00:22] everyone that thirsteth come ye to the
[1:00:24] waters and he that had no money
[1:00:27] come ye buy and eat ye come buy wine and
[1:00:31] milk without money and without price so
[1:00:33] what he's saying here is what's your
[1:00:35] excuse for being thirsty and what's your
[1:00:37] excuse for being hungry because he says
[1:00:39] if you're hungry there's food to eat and
[1:00:41] if you're thirsty there's something to
[1:00:42] drink so if you're thirsty it's not
[1:00:44] because
[1:00:45] that there's nothing to drink it's
[1:00:46] because you're not drinking and if
[1:00:48] you're hungry it's not because there's
[1:00:49] nothing to eat but because you haven't
[1:00:51] taken that which is available to you
[1:00:54] verse 2 says wherefore do you spend
[1:00:56] money for that which is not bread and
[1:00:58] your labor for that which satisfieth not
[1:01:01] hearken diligently unto me and eat ye
[1:01:03] that which is good and let your soul
[1:01:05] delight itself in fatness he's saying
[1:01:07] why are you spending so much time and
[1:01:09] money and effort for something that
[1:01:11] won't feed you why are you working so
[1:01:13] hard for something that won't truly
[1:01:15] satisfy he says listen up focus on
[1:01:18] things that will feed your soul that
[1:01:20] will make your soul fat in this day and
[1:01:22] age fatness is not considered a sign of
[1:01:24] health or or anything like that but in
[1:01:25] the old days fatness meant wealth
[1:01:27] because only wealthy people could eat so
[1:01:28] much that they could get fat they didn't
[1:01:30] work so hard but they made more than
[1:01:32] everybody else so they could eat and get
[1:01:33] fat but people that were just scrounging
[1:01:35] to get by they were always lean and mean
[1:01:37] why because they had to work so hard and
[1:01:39] they never had enough
[1:01:40] he's saying eat so that you're fat show
[1:01:42] that you've got an abundance of what it
[1:01:44] takes to make your soul prosper
[1:01:46] verse three says incline your ear and
[1:01:49] come unto me here and your soul shall
[1:01:52] live and i will make an everlasting
[1:01:53] covenant with you
[1:01:55] even the sure mercies of david we're
[1:01:58] listening to voices and god says hear my
[1:01:59] voice and you'll live and he says look
[1:02:01] to david as an example as to what that
[1:02:03] looks like amen it's easy to jump back
[1:02:05] this morning as i'm thinking on you know
[1:02:07] in his form and with his mind and i
[1:02:09] don't want to do that this morning i
[1:02:11] want to stick tight to my inspiration
[1:02:12] but this this scripture i had actually
[1:02:14] in the in the next
[1:02:16] service but i wanted to bring it back
[1:02:18] into this one and brother branham says
[1:02:20] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:02:22] the spirit saith unto the churches this
[1:02:24] is all through revelation two and three
[1:02:25] in the church ages and then he says how
[1:02:28] tragic it is that this first age did not
[1:02:30] listen to the spirit instead it listened
[1:02:33] to man but thank god in the last stage
[1:02:36] there will be a group rise up the true
[1:02:38] bride of the last day and she will
[1:02:41] listen to the spirit
[1:02:42] and in that day of gross darkness the
[1:02:46] light will return by the pure word and
[1:02:49] we will return to the power of pentecost
[1:02:52] to welcome back the lord jesus christ
[1:02:56] amen you want to be able to hear the
[1:02:58] right voice not just hear a voice but
[1:02:59] you've got to make sure it's the right
[1:03:01] voice that it's the voice of god that
[1:03:03] you're hearing what the spirit is saying
[1:03:05] to the churches amen and what he's
[1:03:07] saying here in isaiah 55 is that it pays
[1:03:09] to heed the voice of god recognize it
[1:03:12] believe it heed it and then wait on it
[1:03:14] or trust on it to come to pass amen
[1:03:17] amen i hear people talking sometimes and
[1:03:20] and the language that they're using
[1:03:22] doesn't come from the scriptures i'm
[1:03:23] listening to the things they say and the
[1:03:25] way they say it and i'm sitting there
[1:03:26] i'm saying that doesn't sound like a
[1:03:28] bible reading christian i'm talking
[1:03:30] about believers now i'm talking about
[1:03:32] professing christians and the things
[1:03:33] that they're saying sounds like somebody
[1:03:35] that's feeding on something other than
[1:03:37] their bible it comes from feeding on the
[1:03:38] news and it comes from feeding on social
[1:03:40] media and it comes from feeding on on
[1:03:42] things that popular people are saying
[1:03:44] but it doesn't come back and align with
[1:03:46] the word and i'm sitting there and i'm
[1:03:47] saying that's not going to take me in a
[1:03:49] rapture that's not going to get me out
[1:03:51] of here furthermore it's not going to
[1:03:53] give me peace and it's not going to give
[1:03:54] me rest it's not going to give me joy
[1:03:56] and it's definitely not going to give me
[1:03:58] patience
[1:03:59] because all it's doing is riling us up
[1:04:01] rather than settling us down into
[1:04:03] resting on the foundation the sure
[1:04:05] foundation of the word of god amen it's
[1:04:07] taking them to a different kingdom and
[1:04:09] it's not the heavenly kingdom and it's
[1:04:11] not for the heavenly kingdom's purpose
[1:04:14] amen our language ought to reflect what
[1:04:15] we're it does reflect what we're reading
[1:04:17] it reflects what we're listening to what
[1:04:19] we're watching every day and i want to
[1:04:20] make sure that what we're speaking
[1:04:22] sounds like we've been reading our
[1:04:24] bibles in man we ought to be saying what
[1:04:25] the word says
[1:04:27] now in isaiah 55 continuing it says
[1:04:29] behold i have given him who david for a
[1:04:32] witness to the people a leader and
[1:04:35] commander to the people he's saying
[1:04:36] watch david's life and if you do what
[1:04:38] david did you're going to come out okay
[1:04:40] in the end and you look at it because
[1:04:41] david's life is a witness of the grace
[1:04:43] of god and the election and calling of
[1:04:45] god david is not perfect but he's
[1:04:47] probably my favorite person in the
[1:04:49] scriptures because he is what he is
[1:04:51] because god called him
[1:04:53] and he heeded it and he followed it and
[1:04:55] he didn't push it
[1:04:57] but he sat back and he let god do what
[1:04:59] he needed to do but as god moved on him
[1:05:01] he moved into situations and he took
[1:05:03] care of business so to speak we heard it
[1:05:05] when uh brother gerald played the the
[1:05:07] three kinds of believers where
[1:05:10] david said as he ran up to goliath he
[1:05:13] says what the god that made me
[1:05:16] is greater than you
[1:05:18] he wasn't saying i'm greater than you he
[1:05:20] didn't say i have more skill i have more
[1:05:22] experience or anything like that none of
[1:05:23] that would be true but he says the god
[1:05:25] that made me the god that called me is
[1:05:28] greater than you goliath and that's the
[1:05:30] basis on which i'm going to defeat you
[1:05:32] is that i'm coming because he's greater
[1:05:33] than you not because i'm greater than
[1:05:35] you but david got himself into problems
[1:05:37] he numbered the people didn't he
[1:05:39] and you weren't supposed to number the
[1:05:40] people because it was going back to the
[1:05:42] arm of flesh
[1:05:43] and he did what he went to the
[1:05:45] philistines because he got so tired of
[1:05:47] running around that he said i'll go to
[1:05:49] my enemies because the enemy of my enemy
[1:05:51] is my friend and i'll go spend some time
[1:05:53] with them to get the break i need and
[1:05:54] god still delivered him out of that
[1:05:57] but he paid a price didn't he he paid a
[1:05:59] price but every time god was able to
[1:06:01] bring him all the way back around to
[1:06:03] where david needed to be so he could
[1:06:04] come and take the throne of israel again
[1:06:06] amen he paid prices for his mistakes but
[1:06:08] god was always there to bring his word
[1:06:10] to pass and that's what david you're
[1:06:11] going to be a king amen and nothing
[1:06:13] david did could stop that
[1:06:16] verse 5 says behold
[1:06:18] thou shalt call a nation that thou
[1:06:20] knowest not that's us
[1:06:22] he says and nations that knew not thee
[1:06:24] shall run unto thee because of the lord
[1:06:26] thy god and for the holy one of israel
[1:06:29] for he hath glorified thee
[1:06:31] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[1:06:34] call ye upon him while he is near we
[1:06:36] spoke on the mercy seat last time and
[1:06:38] there's mercy now
[1:06:40] so take advantage of it amen don't look
[1:06:42] for judgment look for mercy now take
[1:06:44] advantage of all it's here because when
[1:06:45] it's gone it's gone for good right and
[1:06:47] you've got to go all the way then to the
[1:06:48] white throne judgment
[1:06:50] verse 7 says let the wicked forsake his
[1:06:53] way and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:06:56] and let him return unto the lord and he
[1:06:59] will have mercy upon him and to our god
[1:07:02] for he will abundantly pardon him and
[1:07:05] his mercies are new every morning
[1:07:07] and then to those that are asking for it
[1:07:09] there's always mercy available amen and
[1:07:11] if there's a call for it then there's
[1:07:12] going to be something waiting for the
[1:07:13] believer when he does it
[1:07:15] now we come to where we start it says
[1:07:17] for thy my thoughts are not your
[1:07:19] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:07:22] saith the lord so if you have given your
[1:07:24] heart to god and your thoughts haven't
[1:07:26] changed then there's a problem with your
[1:07:27] conversion
[1:07:29] if you're saying that i am a child of
[1:07:31] god now and your thoughts and mannerisms
[1:07:33] and and the way of life hasn't changed
[1:07:35] then there's going to be a problem
[1:07:36] because he says what my thoughts are not
[1:07:39] your thoughts and my ways are not your
[1:07:40] ways so if you've changed from an old
[1:07:42] creature to a new then you've got new
[1:07:44] thoughts and you've got new ways because
[1:07:45] now you're walking with him amen you
[1:07:47] can't walk with god and not change it's
[1:07:49] impossible
[1:07:50] even if you're raised in a message home
[1:07:53] especially if you're raised in a message
[1:07:54] home i would say because you've got to
[1:07:56] come up to a higher level of thinking
[1:07:58] you've got to come to a new way of
[1:08:00] living and it's through the holy spirit
[1:08:01] it's not through you know isms and
[1:08:03] legalism and you must do this and you
[1:08:05] must do that it's not dead doctrine now
[1:08:07] but it's life living within you
[1:08:09] verse 9 says for as the heavens are
[1:08:11] higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:08:13] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:08:15] and your thoughts so which way will you
[1:08:17] choose his way or your way and his
[1:08:19] thoughts are your thoughts his thoughts
[1:08:21] are going to be way up here
[1:08:23] and his way is going to be way up here
[1:08:25] but through the holy spirit you can get
[1:08:27] there amen you can catch the thoughts of
[1:08:29] god
[1:08:30] jesus said i call you friends i share
[1:08:32] things with you i don't share with
[1:08:33] anybody else because why you're close to
[1:08:35] me
[1:08:36] we're allowed to catch the thoughts of
[1:08:37] god
[1:08:38] and those thoughts of us god show us the
[1:08:40] way of god in our lives for as the rain
[1:08:43] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[1:08:45] returneth not thither but watereth the
[1:08:48] earth and maketh that bring forth and
[1:08:49] bud that it may give seed to the sower
[1:08:52] and bread to the eater now i want to
[1:08:53] stop here this is where we finish
[1:08:55] because god's setting a type for us to
[1:08:57] understand how his word works and he
[1:08:59] says my word is like the rain and snow
[1:09:01] that fall now rain and snow come down
[1:09:03] and when they come down they stay down
[1:09:06] now we know the water cycle we know that
[1:09:07] water can't evaporate and it goes up as
[1:09:09] a vapor but it doesn't go back up as
[1:09:11] rain and it doesn't go back up as snow
[1:09:13] does it when it comes down it stays down
[1:09:15] now some of it leeches into the ground
[1:09:17] and plants and whatnot take it some of
[1:09:19] it goes even further down and it feeds
[1:09:21] the underground rivers and streams and
[1:09:22] then some of it stays on the surface and
[1:09:24] it flows to other areas where it can
[1:09:25] help water the plants and the earth and
[1:09:27] these different things
[1:09:28] but in the end there's a cycle that's
[1:09:30] happening and it's unchanging and it
[1:09:32] works
[1:09:33] it works once the water cycle was set in
[1:09:35] motion it's been going ever since and
[1:09:37] guess what man doesn't have to start it
[1:09:39] man doesn't have to stop it men doesn't
[1:09:41] have to do anything it just goes and
[1:09:43] goes and goes it's unrelenting
[1:09:45] you can't stop the water cycle it's
[1:09:47] going to happen when rain comes down
[1:09:48] then something's going to happen there's
[1:09:50] going to be an effect of it amen and so
[1:09:51] as long as there's something on earth to
[1:09:53] receive that rain and put it to use then
[1:09:55] it will always bring forth food amen
[1:09:58] it'll always bring forth something it's
[1:10:00] going to bring forth fruit amen as long
[1:10:01] as seeds are there the water will bring
[1:10:03] it out listen you can put a seed in a
[1:10:05] napkin
[1:10:07] a dead seed a dry seed you put it in a
[1:10:09] napkin you dip that napkin in water and
[1:10:11] just lay it out on your on your
[1:10:12] windowsill and that seed will come to
[1:10:14] life just with water and warmth
[1:10:17] eventually it's going to need some dirt
[1:10:19] but just the water alone will bring that
[1:10:21] seed out and it'll get it started amen
[1:10:23] now the the scripture says that just as
[1:10:25] that is just as the rain is and how it
[1:10:27] works it says so shall my word be that
[1:10:30] goeth forth of my forth out of my mouth
[1:10:33] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:10:35] shall accomplish that which i please and
[1:10:37] it shall prosper in the thing whereto i
[1:10:39] sent it so you say my words just like
[1:10:41] rain and when it comes when it falls out
[1:10:43] it can't come back the way it went and
[1:10:45] then it drops and it's given by what his
[1:10:48] pleasure
[1:10:49] amen so if it speaks it's uh if he
[1:10:52] speaks it's always going to produce is
[1:10:53] what he's saying here god speaks his
[1:10:55] word with two things intention and
[1:10:58] pleasure
[1:10:59] amen now pleasure not meaning that it's
[1:11:01] fun but pleasure meaning that it pleases
[1:11:03] him
[1:11:04] that it is right in his saw in his eyes
[1:11:07] that doesn't mean it's always good for
[1:11:08] the receiver but it means it's right in
[1:11:09] god's eyes amen god speaks things that
[1:11:12] what are good in his sight and right in
[1:11:14] his sight
[1:11:16] and so when he speaks he cannot take it
[1:11:18] back as we started with it has to happen
[1:11:20] if god speaks judgment judgment happens
[1:11:22] if god speaks peace peace happens if god
[1:11:25] speaks healing then healing happens if
[1:11:27] god speaks joy then joy happens god
[1:11:29] speaks sadness and sadness happens
[1:11:31] and if god speaks restoration the
[1:11:32] restoration happens as well amen
[1:11:35] i want to be on the side of the good
[1:11:36] things that god speaks that's for sure
[1:11:38] amen but i love how the scripture says
[1:11:41] it shall accomplish that which that
[1:11:42] which i please and it shall prosper in
[1:11:45] the thing where to ascend it so his will
[1:11:47] drives his word and his word ensures
[1:11:50] that prosperity follows now i'm not
[1:11:52] preaching a prosperity gospel this
[1:11:54] morning because the prosperity that it's
[1:11:56] talking about here is not financial
[1:11:57] prosperity necessarily it is not the
[1:12:00] blessings of god necessarily but this
[1:12:02] word prosper means to advance
[1:12:05] to make progress to succeed
[1:12:08] to bring to successful issue
[1:12:12] so what it's saying here is that when it
[1:12:14] says god's word will prosper it means
[1:12:16] that it's going to keep moving forward
[1:12:18] it will not cease until that word has
[1:12:20] been fulfilled what it means is that the
[1:12:22] word of god when it says it's prosperous
[1:12:24] it means it is relentless
[1:12:27] it is going and going and going and
[1:12:29] going until it achieves that which it
[1:12:31] was meant to achieve now if you've ever
[1:12:33] played sports you'll always find
[1:12:35] eventually you run up against somebody
[1:12:36] that's relentless
[1:12:38] right if you're in hockey and you've got
[1:12:39] a relentless guy that's for checking you
[1:12:41] and no matter what you do as soon as you
[1:12:43] get that puck he's on you and he's
[1:12:44] whacking your stick and he's whacking
[1:12:46] your shin pads and he's shoving you away
[1:12:48] from the puck and everywhere you go he's
[1:12:50] on you
[1:12:51] i played against guys like that i hate
[1:12:52] them
[1:12:53] because you can't do anything it's so
[1:12:55] they're so relentless they're like a dog
[1:12:57] on a bone that's the way my brother
[1:12:59] nathan is when he plays hockey
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] he's just always on you and it's brutal
[1:13:05] to play against them there's a couple
[1:13:06] guys i've played against in my life amen
[1:13:08] and it makes life difficult on the ice
[1:13:10] because you can't do anything they're
[1:13:12] always on you they're stuck to you like
[1:13:13] glue
[1:13:14] and that's what he's saying here is the
[1:13:15] word of god is relentless
[1:13:17] that it is always pressing towards what
[1:13:19] it's supposed to achieve it doesn't slow
[1:13:21] down it doesn't take naps it doesn't go
[1:13:23] to sleep it doesn't take a break doesn't
[1:13:25] have to rehydrate
[1:13:27] it doesn't have to recharge itself once
[1:13:29] it goes it goes and it doesn't stop
[1:13:31] until it's achieved today man the
[1:13:33] relentless word of god is going to
[1:13:35] achieve what god has promised that it
[1:13:36] would achieve
[1:13:38] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:13:39] just think the earth that we're setting
[1:13:41] on tonight is the word of god made
[1:13:43] manifest the world was framed together
[1:13:46] by things which does not even appear
[1:13:49] that's the way the word works
[1:13:51] you don't have to see what's creating
[1:13:53] what needs to come to place as long as
[1:13:55] it comes out eventually amen he says he
[1:13:57] just said let there be and it was how
[1:14:00] easy is it for that god to heal a sick
[1:14:02] body then if he can build a creation by
[1:14:04] just speaking it
[1:14:06] see his word if we could only get faith
[1:14:09] to see what his word is
[1:14:11] we are so earthbound and so
[1:14:13] conglomerated in our mind he says oh i
[1:14:16] don't know we've had so many and i took
[1:14:18] out what he said here because it was a
[1:14:19] nonsensical word but he blended two
[1:14:21] words together and i think what he meant
[1:14:23] was we've had so many inoculations
[1:14:26] and indoctrinations a shot from this one
[1:14:29] and a shot from that one and it's just
[1:14:30] got us to a place where she's all
[1:14:32] twisted up he says but if you could ever
[1:14:35] shake the whole thing loose come back to
[1:14:38] know that he is god and his words can no
[1:14:41] more fail than he can fail amen we need
[1:14:44] a shaking in our lives i believe
[1:14:46] i believe i need a shaking in my life
[1:14:48] amen i want it i need it
[1:14:50] every day i'm saying lord i remember
[1:14:52] when brother aaron oglesby was here and
[1:14:54] he he asked that question at the
[1:14:55] beginning of service he says what
[1:14:56] hinders you
[1:14:58] what is it that hinders you whatever
[1:15:00] hinders me i want to have shaken out of
[1:15:02] my life amen i want god to knock those
[1:15:04] things off to cut them off to beat them
[1:15:06] up whatever it takes to get them off
[1:15:08] amen it needs to be pulled away so that
[1:15:11] we can be what
[1:15:12] creatures that are maturing in christ
[1:15:15] how do you shake those things off
[1:15:17] heed the voice that's what paul says
[1:15:19] he says see that you refuse not him that
[1:15:22] speaketh
[1:15:23] for if they escaped not who refused him
[1:15:25] that spake on earth much more shall not
[1:15:28] we escape if we turn away from him that
[1:15:30] speaketh from heaven whose voice then
[1:15:33] shook the earth but now he had promised
[1:15:35] saying yet once more i shake not the
[1:15:37] earth only but also heaven
[1:15:40] and this word yet once more signified
[1:15:42] the removing of those things that are
[1:15:44] shaken as of things that are made that
[1:15:47] those things which cannot be shaken may
[1:15:50] remain i say god shake my life
[1:15:53] shake my habit shake my friendships
[1:15:55] shake my desires shake all of it amen
[1:15:57] get rid of anything that won't stand
[1:15:59] before your word what's he saying here
[1:16:00] everything that can be shaken will be
[1:16:02] shaken and in the believer's life it's
[1:16:04] going to be replaced with something that
[1:16:05] cannot ever be shaken i want to stand on
[1:16:07] a more sure foundation this morning amen
[1:16:10] he says what wherefore we
[1:16:12] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:16:15] moved
[1:16:16] are you being moved this morning are you
[1:16:19] unstable are you unsure are you in doubt
[1:16:22] if you are then i've got to say that
[1:16:24] you're not receiving a kingdom the way
[1:16:26] you ought to receive it because that
[1:16:27] kingdom can't be moved and when you're
[1:16:29] in that kingdom when you're a part of
[1:16:30] that kingdom when you're on that
[1:16:32] foundation then you'll be as stable as
[1:16:34] the kingdom that you're in
[1:16:36] he says receiving a kingdom which cannot
[1:16:38] be moved what happens let us have grace
[1:16:41] let us have grace whereby we may do what
[1:16:44] serve god acceptably with reverence and
[1:16:48] godly fear why for our god is a
[1:16:51] consuming fire
[1:16:53] amen a believer is going to have
[1:16:54] everything taken out of their life that
[1:16:56] gets in god's way
[1:16:58] he'll burn it out shake it out beat it
[1:16:59] out and then like the gold that has to
[1:17:01] go through the refining process he beats
[1:17:03] it until all the dross is out and he
[1:17:05] sees his perfect reflection amen
[1:17:08] brother brown says and if that word
[1:17:10] fails then god fails and if god fails
[1:17:13] there he isn't god see and you remember
[1:17:16] he can't say one thing here and
[1:17:18] something else over here he's got to
[1:17:20] stay with his first decision in order to
[1:17:23] be god
[1:17:24] and he's only asked us one thing to
[1:17:26] believe that what he said is the truth
[1:17:28] and he'll bring it to pass oh how
[1:17:30] beautiful he says you expected a
[1:17:32] spontaneous thing to happen
[1:17:34] we do sometimes we believe we say we
[1:17:36] believe and we say that's it it's going
[1:17:37] to happen boom
[1:17:39] he says that's what you believe
[1:17:41] he says sometimes it just takes a little
[1:17:44] bit of faith
[1:17:45] it won't make a miracle but if you'll
[1:17:47] hold on to it it'll bring you out just
[1:17:50] stay right with it i've read this quote
[1:17:52] before
[1:17:53] now brother ram takes this whole thing
[1:17:55] and he's saying once the word goes forth
[1:17:56] if you can tie into that word if you can
[1:17:59] anchor yourself to that word it'll carry
[1:18:01] you through
[1:18:02] and then he gives us the example of the
[1:18:04] the children of israel to show what it
[1:18:06] looks like when god sends his word out
[1:18:07] and it prospers when it is relentless
[1:18:10] and he says israel was in their journey
[1:18:12] going to palestine coming from egypt and
[1:18:15] the lord was with them
[1:18:17] that's the key here the lord was with
[1:18:19] them he says every enemy that had raised
[1:18:22] up before israel was moved out of the
[1:18:24] way
[1:18:25] for god said he would send hornets
[1:18:27] before them and would drive out the
[1:18:29] enemy as long as they walked in
[1:18:31] obedience to his command
[1:18:33] watch this the job was never too big
[1:18:38] the job was never too big moses or
[1:18:40] joshua take two million men women and
[1:18:43] children across a raging river and
[1:18:45] destroy a land that has walled cities
[1:18:47] that has giants that has people that are
[1:18:50] dedicated to destroying you that has
[1:18:52] trained people with weapons and chariots
[1:18:54] that you can't even hope to match go in
[1:18:56] there and do it
[1:18:57] he says the job was never too big
[1:19:00] the amalekites the giants of the day
[1:19:02] meant nothing to israel though they were
[1:19:05] small men in stature but they were
[1:19:07] walking in what thus saith the lord so
[1:19:11] no matter what the opposition was god
[1:19:14] has always seen that his words of
[1:19:16] promise never failed israel
[1:19:19] now catch this he says and the old
[1:19:21] testament the israel of the old
[1:19:22] testament is a type of the bride of the
[1:19:25] new testament coming up where out of
[1:19:28] this world marching on the road to
[1:19:30] canaan or the canaan that we go to the
[1:19:33] millennium
[1:19:34] so what's he saying no job is too big
[1:19:37] whatever faces you as long as you're on
[1:19:39] the road to canaan
[1:19:41] no job is too big
[1:19:43] what battle lies before you this morning
[1:19:47] is it a battle of your poor choices and
[1:19:49] decisions
[1:19:51] so many times we're in battles and it
[1:19:53] ain't because we're in god's will it's
[1:19:54] because we're in our will
[1:19:56] and what we do is we sit back and we say
[1:19:57] well i'm in a battle that means that i'm
[1:19:59] in god's will
[1:20:01] no no no no in a battle does not mean
[1:20:03] you're in god's will listen if you're in
[1:20:04] a battle with the world if you're in the
[1:20:06] battle with other people that doesn't
[1:20:07] mean a thing because the world's
[1:20:09] fighting with everybody these days
[1:20:11] right so if you're in a battle with the
[1:20:12] world if you're in a battle with with
[1:20:14] the way things are going that's not
[1:20:16] necessarily meaning that it's god
[1:20:19] amen you can't win a battle you started
[1:20:21] by listening to the wrong voice
[1:20:23] and we can take that right back to the
[1:20:24] scriptures because we see jehoshaphat
[1:20:26] remember
[1:20:27] he was there with ahab and ab says will
[1:20:29] you come and fight with me at rammeth
[1:20:30] gilead and he says well let's talk to
[1:20:32] god about this do you have any prophets
[1:20:34] and ahab says yeah i've got 450 of them
[1:20:37] 450 prophets come out and they say go up
[1:20:39] the lord is with you
[1:20:41] one man even makes the horns and says
[1:20:42] with these horns you're going to destroy
[1:20:44] the enemy
[1:20:45] now what happens is he says but is there
[1:20:47] one more
[1:20:48] and that one man comes out and he says
[1:20:50] don't do it for i saw israel scattered
[1:20:51] as sheep
[1:20:53] and guess what jehoshaphat ignored the
[1:20:55] one man that was anointed by the spirit
[1:20:57] of god and he went out and he aligned
[1:20:59] himself with a man that was under god's
[1:21:01] judgment
[1:21:02] but i want you to see how he got there
[1:21:04] because they never did win that battle
[1:21:07] but joshua jehoshaphat was in the battle
[1:21:09] and he gets out alive and it's only
[1:21:10] god's grace but watch how he gets there
[1:21:13] in second chronicles 18 verse 1 it says
[1:21:15] now jehoshaphat had riches and honor in
[1:21:18] abundance
[1:21:19] you know what that tells me jehoshaphat
[1:21:21] was blessed before he ever met ahab god
[1:21:24] was with him
[1:21:25] it says and then he joined affinity with
[1:21:28] ahab
[1:21:29] so jehoshaphat was doing great because
[1:21:32] god didn't bless israel unless you were
[1:21:33] in god's will
[1:21:34] if you were following god's word then he
[1:21:36] blessed you and if you weren't then he
[1:21:37] brought judgment
[1:21:38] so now ahab's facing judgment and
[1:21:40] jehoshaphat has nothing to do with it
[1:21:43] joseph's blessed but it says in verse
[1:21:45] two and after certain years he went down
[1:21:47] to ahab to samaria
[1:21:49] and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him
[1:21:51] in abundance and for the people that he
[1:21:53] had with them and persuaded him to go up
[1:21:55] with him to rhamath gilead
[1:21:57] and ahab king of israel said to
[1:21:59] jehoshaphat king of judah will thou go
[1:22:01] with me to ramoth gilead and watch his
[1:22:04] answer he said and he answered him i am
[1:22:07] as thou art and my people as thy people
[1:22:10] and we will be with them war
[1:22:12] joseph wasn't like ahab
[1:22:14] but he says i'm just like you and my
[1:22:16] people are just like yours as well
[1:22:18] he's confessing that i'm the same as an
[1:22:20] unbeliever
[1:22:22] not a make-believer ahab's an idolatry
[1:22:24] he's not a make-believer anymore he is
[1:22:25] an unbeliever yet he has prophets that
[1:22:28] report to him
[1:22:30] that's a messed up man he's got a
[1:22:32] murdering idolatrous wife joshua doesn't
[1:22:34] have that but jehoshaphat says listen
[1:22:36] i'm just like you
[1:22:38] and ahab wined him and he dined him and
[1:22:40] he made him feel special until
[1:22:41] jehoshaphat started to feel that he was
[1:22:43] special
[1:22:44] joshua was special before he ever came
[1:22:46] to ahab god was with him god bless them
[1:22:48] but he comes and this man this king
[1:22:50] starts to whine and dine him starts to
[1:22:51] make him feel like a big shot and all of
[1:22:53] a sudden he says i'm just like you
[1:22:56] when you start saying things like that
[1:22:58] to unbelievers you're on the path to
[1:22:59] pain
[1:23:01] when you start linking up with people
[1:23:02] that are not believers you're on the
[1:23:04] path to pain and he's aligning himself
[1:23:06] with a man that has had judgment already
[1:23:08] pronounced on him by the prophet
[1:23:10] ahab's been judged
[1:23:12] he's already been said the dogs are
[1:23:14] jezebel the dogs are going to lick your
[1:23:15] blood and ahab you're going to die in
[1:23:17] battle
[1:23:18] it's already been told that prophet's
[1:23:20] long gone
[1:23:21] but the prophecy is still there ahab
[1:23:22] you're going to die in battle and now
[1:23:24] he's about to go into battle and he's
[1:23:25] scared and he gets another believer he
[1:23:26] gets a believer to come in and say can
[1:23:28] you join up with me and keep me safe
[1:23:32] that's hard preaching when we say don't
[1:23:34] line up with unbelievers but guess what
[1:23:35] we can get into it in business we can
[1:23:38] get into it in social media we can get
[1:23:39] into it with friendships we can get into
[1:23:41] it with acquaintances
[1:23:42] listen our hobbies
[1:23:44] like i said so many times i like cars
[1:23:46] guess what if i started hanging out with
[1:23:48] car people there's a lot of bad people
[1:23:49] out there when i say bad meaning people
[1:23:51] that have none of the values and morals
[1:23:52] of a believer and you see it because
[1:23:54] fast cars attract fast money and fast
[1:23:57] women and guess what that's what you'll
[1:23:58] find if you hang around a lot with it
[1:23:59] that's why i don't hang around with car
[1:24:01] people because there's nothing good in
[1:24:03] it
[1:24:03] my part might be clean but what it comes
[1:24:05] with it is nothing good amen it's the
[1:24:07] same thing for anyone else you can't
[1:24:08] align yourself with people that aren't
[1:24:10] under the word of god for this day in
[1:24:12] this age amen it'll never profit the
[1:24:14] kingdom of god and if it won't profit
[1:24:15] the kingdom of god it won't profit you
[1:24:18] because that's the only prophet we're
[1:24:20] concerned about isn't it amen
[1:24:23] the thing i'm saying is if you're in a
[1:24:25] battle check and make sure you're on
[1:24:26] spiritual ground before you get hurt
[1:24:29] because if you're not you need to repent
[1:24:30] and back off and say lord help me
[1:24:32] get me out of this i got in it but lord
[1:24:35] i'm asking you to get me out i'm your
[1:24:36] child i'm sorry but will you help me to
[1:24:38] get out of it amen
[1:24:40] amen we're not spiritual because we're
[1:24:41] in a battle
[1:24:42] and then we're all going to be in
[1:24:43] battles but you got to make sure you're
[1:24:44] in a real battle amen
[1:24:48] listen to what ahab says verse 29 he
[1:24:50] says in the king of israel that's ahab
[1:24:52] said to jehoshaphat i will disguise
[1:24:54] myself and i will go to the battle but
[1:24:56] put thou on thy robes in other words he
[1:24:59] says yeah i'm the king but i'm just
[1:25:01] going to dress like a regular soldier in
[1:25:02] this one but you you dress like the king
[1:25:05] why he wants him to be the target
[1:25:08] he wants him to take the pain of ahab's
[1:25:10] judgment he wants him to pay the price
[1:25:11] that ahab's rightly supposed to pay
[1:25:14] and jehoshaphat the king of israel
[1:25:16] disguised himself and they went to the
[1:25:17] battle
[1:25:18] so we've got a make-believer we've got
[1:25:19] an unbeliever that take asks the
[1:25:21] believer that he knows is blessed of god
[1:25:23] to take his judgment now puts him under
[1:25:26] pressure to try and take what the
[1:25:27] pressure off of ahab the probability of
[1:25:29] ahab dying in that battle
[1:25:36] you know what that looks like today
[1:25:37] sometimes
[1:25:39] when i make a mistake and i go and i ask
[1:25:40] a deacon to come with me to sort it out
[1:25:43] because what i'm asking somebody to come
[1:25:45] and support me in my pain
[1:25:48] that's not what we're supposed to do
[1:25:50] i'm supposed to take my own lumps aren't
[1:25:52] they and whether it's a retraction from
[1:25:54] a pulpit or going to talk to a brother
[1:25:55] and sister and saying i'm sorry i did
[1:25:56] something wrong we don't gain we don't
[1:25:59] set up alliances to help us make things
[1:26:01] right
[1:26:02] we got to take our own lumps we got to
[1:26:03] take our own pain we got to go and
[1:26:04] humble ourselves to that person or to
[1:26:06] that situation say i was wrong
[1:26:09] forgive me
[1:26:10] because otherwise if i go in and i got
[1:26:11] brother matt or brother joe with me
[1:26:13] what's that brother or sister going to
[1:26:14] think i'm under attack
[1:26:16] and my goal shouldn't be to go to attack
[1:26:18] it should be to go there and make things
[1:26:19] right
[1:26:20] and i do that humbly and sincerely by
[1:26:22] myself and the only time i'd ever go
[1:26:24] back with another person is if it wasn't
[1:26:25] received that they wouldn't do anything
[1:26:27] for it amen and then we're not here to
[1:26:29] build each other up in our mistakes
[1:26:32] right so when you see somebody sliding
[1:26:34] you don't go and help them get out of
[1:26:35] their sliding you let god get them out
[1:26:37] because they've got to pay a price
[1:26:38] sometimes they've got to learn the
[1:26:39] lesson for themselves if we keep doing
[1:26:41] what getting them out of pain they'll
[1:26:42] never learn
[1:26:44] we learn that with our children
[1:26:45] eventually right there comes a point
[1:26:47] where you have to hand them over to god
[1:26:48] and you say god they're in your hands
[1:26:49] now i've taught them i've helped them
[1:26:52] i've done everything i can but at this
[1:26:53] point they know better and so they've
[1:26:55] got to pay the price
[1:26:57] there is uh
[1:26:59] hopefully it's okay to say this um
[1:27:02] i will say that i won't say names but
[1:27:04] one of the kids that that came with my
[1:27:06] family to visit left something here
[1:27:08] and uh they said if you find it send it
[1:27:10] to us and we'll pay well what we found
[1:27:12] out and my wife told me is that samuel
[1:27:14] had taken it from this person and so my
[1:27:16] wife just kind of stuck it on the
[1:27:17] counter and it got left there so i told
[1:27:19] my sister i said yep we found it i'll
[1:27:21] send it back and she says well we'll pay
[1:27:23] for i said no no samuel took it so we'll
[1:27:25] pay for it and she said well no because
[1:27:27] we've been trying to teach him a lesson
[1:27:29] not to forget that everywhere he goes
[1:27:31] so she said we'll pay for it
[1:27:33] she said it wasn't that much anyways it
[1:27:35] was 35 or something to ship it really
[1:27:37] quickly but she said he's got to learn
[1:27:39] the lesson
[1:27:40] and the only lesson he's going to learn
[1:27:41] now we've told him too many times the
[1:27:43] only lesson he's got to learn now is
[1:27:44] through the pain of his wallet right
[1:27:46] she didn't say we'll pay for it she said
[1:27:48] he'll pay for it he should have checked
[1:27:50] he should have made sure that he had
[1:27:51] that before he left your house this
[1:27:52] morning amen
[1:27:54] make sure you're under the right kind of
[1:27:55] protection make sure you're under
[1:27:57] protection of the word not under the
[1:27:58] protection of your own rightness or your
[1:28:00] own thoughts amen we don't want to take
[1:28:02] the heat off of each other because god's
[1:28:03] using the heat we're all under heat
[1:28:05] we're all under pressure we're all under
[1:28:07] under the working hand of the of the
[1:28:10] master craftsman aren't we and he's
[1:28:11] beating things out of us and guess what
[1:28:13] at the end it's maybe not too difficult
[1:28:15] but at the beginning there's a lot of
[1:28:16] beating that goes on
[1:28:18] what he's knocking off the big chunks
[1:28:20] he's taking out the big things in our
[1:28:21] lives that we need to get rid of
[1:28:23] says now the chit now the king of
[1:28:24] assyria had commanded the captains of
[1:28:26] the chariots that were with him saying
[1:28:28] fight ye not with smaller greats save
[1:28:30] only with the king of israel now he
[1:28:32] knows the king of judah is there
[1:28:34] but he says focus on the king of israel
[1:28:36] that's ahab he says the king of israel
[1:28:38] says the only person i care about in
[1:28:40] this battle is ahab kill ahab
[1:28:43] and guess who looks like ahab
[1:28:45] joseph
[1:28:46] he's the face of the business he's the
[1:28:48] face of the kingdom now he's the only
[1:28:50] one dressed in the king's robes and the
[1:28:52] king of syria says kill that guy
[1:28:55] and it came to pass when the captains of
[1:28:56] the chariot saw jehoshaphat that they
[1:28:58] said it is the king of israel therefore
[1:29:00] they can pass about him to fight but
[1:29:02] jehoshaphat cried out and the lord
[1:29:05] helped him and god move them to depart
[1:29:07] from him
[1:29:08] now listen he's listened to lying
[1:29:10] prophets he's aligned himself with an
[1:29:12] unbelieving idolater and he's entered a
[1:29:14] battle that the spirit of god has said
[1:29:16] don't enter
[1:29:17] okay he ain't where he's supposed to be
[1:29:18] he's not fighting god's battle and yet
[1:29:21] what
[1:29:23] god takes him out i guarantee you there
[1:29:25] were some some close moments i guarantee
[1:29:27] you he didn't get out there without of a
[1:29:28] scratch
[1:29:29] i guarantee you a spear and arrow nicked
[1:29:31] him or cut him open a little bit or
[1:29:33] whatnot made him fear for his life
[1:29:36] but in the end he cried out to god and
[1:29:38] god was the one that had the last word
[1:29:40] why because jehoshaphat was his child
[1:29:43] joshua was a good man joshua was a king
[1:29:45] that god approved of and so when he
[1:29:47] cried out god says i'll pull you out of
[1:29:48] this amen i'll take care of you amen
[1:29:52] it's no different with us
[1:29:55] how many times can we say we've gotten
[1:29:56] ourselves into a mess
[1:29:58] i've got myself and many and what do you
[1:30:00] do you come to your senses like the
[1:30:01] prodigal son you say
[1:30:03] i really ought not to be here and i
[1:30:06] can't get myself out anymore i'm
[1:30:08] addicted i'm in too tight i'm too close
[1:30:11] i'm in this job i've moved whatever the
[1:30:13] case may be lord what can i do here and
[1:30:15] he says it's okay son
[1:30:17] your names are engraved in the palm of
[1:30:19] my hands your names are written in a
[1:30:21] lamb's book of life that cannot be
[1:30:22] erased it can't be blotted out have you
[1:30:24] ever thought about that
[1:30:26] it talks that it can't be erased which
[1:30:28] means it can't be taken out but guess
[1:30:29] what it can't be covered with something
[1:30:31] so your name is unreadable either it
[1:30:33] can't be blotted out by your mistakes
[1:30:35] can't be blotted out by your failures by
[1:30:37] by by your unwillingness to do what god
[1:30:39] asks you to do you can't be blotted out
[1:30:41] or erased in that in that lamb's book of
[1:30:42] life amen
[1:30:44] so what he comes behind and he says i'll
[1:30:46] get you out of this
[1:30:47] now they never won the battle and ahab
[1:30:49] lost his life
[1:30:51] but your husband got away with his skin
[1:30:53] but guess what i guarantee he lost some
[1:30:55] soldiers he lost some friends he lost
[1:30:58] some loved ones why because he got out
[1:30:59] of the will of god
[1:31:01] there's always a price to pay when you
[1:31:02] listen to the wrong word
[1:31:04] but the prophet of god who's pointing us
[1:31:06] in the quote we read earlier to the
[1:31:07] children of israel and what the word of
[1:31:09] god gave them and he's telling us
[1:31:10] there's a path that we want to be on
[1:31:12] amen and that's a path where the last
[1:31:13] word we hear is the word of god for our
[1:31:15] lives
[1:31:17] that when we hear the word of god that's
[1:31:19] where we stop and say i'm going to go
[1:31:20] now
[1:31:21] that's what i'm going to accept that's
[1:31:23] what i'm going to believe is true and
[1:31:24] i'm going to move on based on the last
[1:31:25] word i had and we don't let satan get in
[1:31:28] we don't let friends get in we don't get
[1:31:29] influence in we don't let our jobs get
[1:31:31] in but we say the word of god is yay
[1:31:32] amen and that's good enough for me and
[1:31:34] we just keep moving forward in it he
[1:31:36] says what giant stood up what happened
[1:31:38] to the giants annihilated he says they
[1:31:40] were small men in stature
[1:31:42] up against giants all of them were
[1:31:44] annihilated walled cities how do you
[1:31:46] knock down a walled city he took down
[1:31:48] jericho by by a miracle and now they got
[1:31:50] to knock down wild cities by what
[1:31:53] their own might
[1:31:54] little men
[1:31:56] with no tools and yet they did it three
[1:31:58] months six months to take them down
[1:32:00] sometimes but in the end they always got
[1:32:01] their city
[1:32:03] right it wasn't always miraculous
[1:32:05] remember brother brown says just a
[1:32:07] little bit of faith it'll take it down
[1:32:09] they just had to keep walking walking
[1:32:11] walking footsteps is possession the
[1:32:13] prophet of god said
[1:32:14] keep moving forward be relentless
[1:32:18] if the word is relentless be relentless
[1:32:19] to stick with it and then don't let it
[1:32:21] get ahead of you
[1:32:22] don't fall behind it and then stay
[1:32:24] really close to it why because god
[1:32:27] called them and god gave them a thus
[1:32:28] saith the lord
[1:32:29] that's what they were doing he said thus
[1:32:31] saith the lord go in and take the land
[1:32:33] i'll be with you i'll send hornets to
[1:32:35] drive them out it's the prophet what god
[1:32:36] was saying
[1:32:37] he says just follow me in just follow me
[1:32:40] in
[1:32:40] he says and i'll take care of you in
[1:32:42] there that's no different with us
[1:32:44] he says what it's the same thing for the
[1:32:45] bride you're called out the same way he
[1:32:47] says you're going to a millennium now
[1:32:49] he says and so everything that stands
[1:32:50] before you has to fall the exact same
[1:32:52] way as long as you're relentless to
[1:32:54] stick with that last word that he gives
[1:32:55] us
[1:32:56] prophet god puts it this way he says
[1:32:58] when god speaks to a man
[1:33:01] he has faith and he has ambition and he
[1:33:04] has a purpose
[1:33:05] when god speaks to a man he gives him a
[1:33:08] purpose so you don't come with a purpose
[1:33:10] you go away with a purpose
[1:33:12] when god speaks to a man he gives him
[1:33:13] ambition so you don't come with ambition
[1:33:15] you leave with ambition
[1:33:17] because so often i can say for myself
[1:33:18] you come with ambition and it doesn't go
[1:33:20] well because what you're not surrendered
[1:33:23] to his will you're coming in with your
[1:33:24] own thoughts you're coming in with your
[1:33:26] own ideas and so he can't work with that
[1:33:28] but if he can give you his ambition if
[1:33:29] he can give you his thoughts if he can
[1:33:31] give you his purpose then now you've got
[1:33:32] something to do
[1:33:34] he said when god speaks to a man he
[1:33:36] gives him faith to do it to accomplish
[1:33:38] or achieve what his purpose in life is
[1:33:40] and what god called him to do he's
[1:33:43] called us to be in the church of god
[1:33:46] and he says amen
[1:33:47] so what you're doing not to be by his
[1:33:49] faith by his ambition
[1:33:52] and by his purpose
[1:33:54] so whether you're a wife and a mother at
[1:33:55] home
[1:33:56] when you're a father and a husband
[1:33:57] that's out of work every day whether
[1:33:59] it's a young person at school whether
[1:34:00] it's a young person in the workforce
[1:34:02] each and everything that we're doing
[1:34:03] we're supposed to have a faith and
[1:34:05] ambition and a purpose behind it
[1:34:07] that god has led us there and we're
[1:34:09] there for a purpose because it's not
[1:34:11] always going to be you're going to get
[1:34:12] into battles
[1:34:14] but if you're there by his faith
[1:34:15] ambition and purpose then you know that
[1:34:16] it's got to fall before you that you'll
[1:34:18] make it through and it's going to do
[1:34:19] something for your good and not to your
[1:34:21] hurt
[1:34:22] amen brother bam saying that he wants
[1:34:25] you to live according to the word of god
[1:34:27] completely
[1:34:28] completely by faith ambition and purpose
[1:34:32] let's go back to isaiah again as we
[1:34:33] start to close this out he says so shall
[1:34:35] my word be that goes forth out of my
[1:34:37] mouth it shall not return to me void but
[1:34:39] it shall accomplish that which i please
[1:34:41] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:34:43] to i sent it now watch its effect
[1:34:46] it says for ye shall go out with joy
[1:34:50] so there's two things
[1:34:51] there's a leaving
[1:34:54] there's a going out
[1:34:55] and there's a joy that comes with the
[1:34:56] going out
[1:34:58] if we're sitting here and we're mourning
[1:34:59] what we've left behind something's wrong
[1:35:03] because we haven't caught a revelation
[1:35:04] we haven't caught a vision of what lays
[1:35:06] before us when israel left egypt there
[1:35:08] was no mourning when they left
[1:35:10] now later when they backslid they were
[1:35:12] they were mourning for the garlics and
[1:35:14] the leeks and the delicious food
[1:35:16] that they had while they were working
[1:35:18] the the pits and making bricks and
[1:35:20] building feral cities
[1:35:22] but when you're leaving there's joy
[1:35:24] he says and you'll be led forth with
[1:35:26] peace so there's a leading someplace
[1:35:28] else and peace goes with it
[1:35:30] it says and the mountains and the hills
[1:35:32] shall break forth with you before you
[1:35:34] into singing and all the trees of the
[1:35:36] field shall clap their hands
[1:35:40] instead of the thorn shall come up the
[1:35:42] fir tree and instead of the briar shall
[1:35:44] come up the myrtle tree and it shall be
[1:35:47] to the lord for a name for an
[1:35:49] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[1:35:52] off what's he saying are you saying you
[1:35:54] looked at this situation that you were
[1:35:56] in
[1:35:57] and you thought that out of this would
[1:35:58] come thorns and briars that the the
[1:36:01] horribleness the nastiness the
[1:36:03] difficulty of this situation was going
[1:36:05] to turn you into something that nobody
[1:36:07] could approach
[1:36:08] then it would be a person that was
[1:36:09] prickly standoffish grumpy mad angry
[1:36:12] disillusioned disappointed
[1:36:15] nobody wants to be around somebody like
[1:36:16] that he says what would have come out of
[1:36:18] this situation typically would be thorns
[1:36:19] and briars but he says out of it is
[1:36:21] going to come a fir tree and fur is
[1:36:24] prized for its strength and durability
[1:36:26] and construction solomon used it to
[1:36:28] overlay the temple
[1:36:30] fir trees
[1:36:32] it's a part of the building of god
[1:36:35] and this is what it looks like the
[1:36:38] biggest tree in the world is a fir tree
[1:36:41] he says so out of this situation that
[1:36:43] should have brought forth prickly people
[1:36:46] that are hurt and offended and want
[1:36:48] nothing to do with anything he says out
[1:36:50] of it comes the greatest tree on the
[1:36:52] living earth
[1:36:54] biggest tree in the world is the nook
[1:36:56] sack giant 465
[1:36:58] feet tall
[1:37:00] can you imagine
[1:37:02] 46 and a half stories i think scotiabank
[1:37:05] is like 10 stories four times taller
[1:37:08] than scotiabank building downtown
[1:37:10] that's a tree
[1:37:11] out of the situation that looked
[1:37:13] completely hopeless comes a tree that
[1:37:16] was 465 feet tall
[1:37:20] why
[1:37:22] because there's a seed of god in there
[1:37:24] amen and a seed of god can't change
[1:37:27] it's got to come forth
[1:37:29] out of a situation that would normally
[1:37:31] destroy everyone else if there's a seed
[1:37:32] of god in there it's going to bring
[1:37:34] forth a child of god every single time
[1:37:37] and it's going to bring forth something
[1:37:38] that looks like a fir tree
[1:37:40] now i looked it up
[1:37:42] because of fir tree i was like why a fir
[1:37:44] tree
[1:37:45] why not something else
[1:37:47] there's lots of trees in the bible why a
[1:37:49] fir tree
[1:37:50] and i looked it up it says and these are
[1:37:52] the the attributes of a fir tree it says
[1:37:55] wood grain denotes stability if grain
[1:37:57] lines are straight and close together
[1:37:59] wood is strong and stable
[1:38:01] fur has tight close grain lines the
[1:38:05] software between the grain lines shrinks
[1:38:07] and expands making the wood cup or twist
[1:38:09] but it says fur has little soft green
[1:38:12] for stability and strength fur is much
[1:38:14] less prone to warping or twisting and
[1:38:17] much stronger
[1:38:19] in other words it's built word upon word
[1:38:22] line upon line here little there little
[1:38:24] it grows the grains are very tight
[1:38:26] together so there's not much in between
[1:38:28] that can warp and twist
[1:38:30] it says fur offers stability when used
[1:38:32] for decking or other exterior
[1:38:34] applications guess what god used it for
[1:38:36] in the temple
[1:38:37] exterior applications it was a cladding
[1:38:40] it says
[1:38:41] even though fur will shrink and expand
[1:38:43] as it absorbs moisture anybody that's
[1:38:45] built anything knows what happens with
[1:38:47] wood when it absorbs moisture not good
[1:38:49] right it says it always returns to the
[1:38:52] same shape
[1:38:55] so in a rugged environment in our
[1:38:57] newfoundland weather you put a piece of
[1:38:58] fur out there and you put it in a bunch
[1:39:00] of soaking hot rain we don't get hot
[1:39:03] rain soaking rain
[1:39:05] right what's going to happen is it's
[1:39:07] going to expand a little bit
[1:39:08] but as soon as that rain's done what
[1:39:10] happens it dries out and it goes right
[1:39:12] back to its original shape it doesn't
[1:39:13] warp and twist
[1:39:15] it doesn't let its environment define
[1:39:17] what it is
[1:39:19] it says this is a prized quality for
[1:39:21] builders and fur is so reliable that is
[1:39:24] it is even shipped cut and installed on
[1:39:27] homes while it is still green
[1:39:30] everything else you have to put it
[1:39:31] through a lumber kiln to dry it out or
[1:39:32] you have to let it sit out and age for a
[1:39:34] couple of years so it will dry out so
[1:39:35] that it's what it's in the shape that
[1:39:37] you can trust but they say fur you can
[1:39:39] put it in as soon as it's cut you can
[1:39:41] put it into a home and it won't warp or
[1:39:42] twist you can what rely on it
[1:39:46] it says when the first stabilizes it
[1:39:48] will take on the shape of wherever it is
[1:39:51] installed
[1:39:52] pine under the same circumstances will
[1:39:54] take our moisture swell and warp
[1:39:57] completely out of its original shape
[1:39:59] so out of this situation comes what a
[1:40:01] believer
[1:40:02] that won't twist
[1:40:04] that won't warp
[1:40:05] sure when things go through life what do
[1:40:07] we do we always get worked up a little
[1:40:09] bit
[1:40:10] we get moved a little bit
[1:40:12] but we always come back to what exactly
[1:40:14] what we were in the first place
[1:40:16] we don't go in straight and come out
[1:40:18] crooked
[1:40:19] we're going straight and we come out
[1:40:20] straight
[1:40:21] in between there might be a little bit
[1:40:22] of bow
[1:40:24] but we'll always come out to what we
[1:40:25] were in the first place amen what it can
[1:40:27] handle the storms of life and when it's
[1:40:29] fully cured when it's mature it will
[1:40:32] always hold the shape that god made it
[1:40:34] to be
[1:40:35] amen
[1:40:36] then it says that there's also a myrtle
[1:40:38] tree that comes out of this so instead
[1:40:40] of thorns you get a fur tree and then it
[1:40:42] says a myrtle tree instead of a briar
[1:40:44] what do briars do
[1:40:46] one briar is not a problem
[1:40:49] but when you get a bunch of briars what
[1:40:50] they do they grow together and they
[1:40:51] intertwine and you'll get your skin and
[1:40:53] clothes ripped off if you try to go
[1:40:55] through briars without cutting them away
[1:40:57] what one won't do the job but they
[1:41:00] always grow in groups and they come up
[1:41:02] and they go over a structure like
[1:41:03] brother aaron was showing us a lot of
[1:41:04] times briars will do that they'll close
[1:41:06] over a pathway or they'll grow up along
[1:41:08] the house and you can't go into it
[1:41:09] anymore because the briars block your
[1:41:10] way and you have to burn them or cut
[1:41:12] them
[1:41:13] but he says instead of something like
[1:41:14] that he says out of that a myrtle tree
[1:41:16] grows
[1:41:17] and i had to look up a myrtle tree
[1:41:18] because we got lots of myrtle trees we
[1:41:19] got crepe myrtles here right
[1:41:21] but the myrtle tree in israel is
[1:41:23] something different
[1:41:25] and it has four key attributes
[1:41:28] one is that it has evergreen leaves that
[1:41:30] keep it fresh all year round
[1:41:32] doesn't ever die down the life never
[1:41:34] leaves it
[1:41:36] it's always able to produce something
[1:41:38] the second thing is that it has flowers
[1:41:40] that blossom every year and give a
[1:41:42] beautiful fragrance
[1:41:44] it's full of oil year-round that has
[1:41:46] healing properties
[1:41:48] and it always lives near a water course
[1:41:51] where it can easily survive
[1:41:54] we're talking about the growth of a
[1:41:55] believer now out of these situations
[1:41:57] amen so out of an environment where you
[1:41:59] could expect somebody to put up great
[1:42:00] barriers
[1:42:02] to block access to their life to their
[1:42:04] heart
[1:42:05] he says out of that grows this thing
[1:42:07] that is always producing life
[1:42:09] that has a sweet fragrance every year
[1:42:11] that is full of oil that can heal
[1:42:14] and that always stays close to the
[1:42:16] flowing water of the word of god
[1:42:18] it knows where it needs to stay to have
[1:42:20] life amen
[1:42:22] that what when nothing is happening the
[1:42:23] way we think when our expectations
[1:42:25] falter beneath the weight of
[1:42:26] circumstances we know that out of those
[1:42:29] things god brings forth a people of
[1:42:30] great strength people full of the holy
[1:42:33] ghost tied to that fresh flowing word of
[1:42:35] god that's keeping them clean that's
[1:42:37] growing them and maturing them every
[1:42:39] single day of their lives amen and we
[1:42:40] can look back on our lives and see that
[1:42:42] we can look back and see situations
[1:42:44] where out of that came something good
[1:42:47] amen the great separation that brother
[1:42:50] mark and sister maureen and brother bob
[1:42:51] and sister brenda in particular had to
[1:42:53] do brother gerald has spoken over the
[1:42:55] pulpit of the troubles he's faced with
[1:42:57] his families
[1:42:58] you know and different loved ones issues
[1:43:00] at work
[1:43:01] things that we face things at school
[1:43:04] and men are young people and i've been a
[1:43:05] part of it you get you get harassed and
[1:43:07] you get made fun of for these things and
[1:43:10] so many in other situations if you were
[1:43:12] bullied and you were a child of the
[1:43:13] world guess what that many times would
[1:43:15] turn you inward and make you resent the
[1:43:17] god that makes you do the things that
[1:43:19] you do and the parents that make you
[1:43:21] live and dress the way that you do but
[1:43:22] out of it comes what holy ghost-filled
[1:43:24] children that can stand on their own two
[1:43:25] feet out of it comes pillars of the
[1:43:27] church
[1:43:28] that can help support us as we grow and
[1:43:30] as the second generation the third
[1:43:32] generation and if the lord tarries the
[1:43:33] fourth generation to come through this
[1:43:35] church where the holy ghost is still
[1:43:36] moving where revival still happens where
[1:43:38] you've got people that can still praise
[1:43:40] god that they can still show forth to
[1:43:42] the world that there's still a light to
[1:43:43] be had amen
[1:43:46] sometimes we get into troubling god
[1:43:48] takes us out but what happens when
[1:43:49] somebody we loves gets into trouble
[1:43:51] that's often hardest isn't it we know
[1:43:53] who we are
[1:43:55] we know who we are we know where our
[1:43:56] place is we know what our condition is
[1:43:58] and so it's a lot harder a lot easier to
[1:44:00] trust but when somebody else gets out
[1:44:01] there
[1:44:02] that's a lot harder isn't it
[1:44:04] because i can't help them the way i can
[1:44:06] go to god i can go to god but i don't
[1:44:08] know where their heart is i don't know
[1:44:09] where their where their relationship
[1:44:11] with god is sometimes you look at and
[1:44:12] say there is none and oftentimes there
[1:44:14] isn't but when somebody like that goes
[1:44:16] away when a family member slips away
[1:44:18] when a church member slips away what do
[1:44:20] we do then
[1:44:21] they're going into a situation all you
[1:44:23] see is briars and thorns coming out of
[1:44:24] it isn't it
[1:44:26] so many times
[1:44:28] do we look at that
[1:44:30] do we lose hope and faith do we start
[1:44:32] confessing they can't come back
[1:44:34] god can never rearrange the situation
[1:44:37] or do we go to the scripture says his
[1:44:39] word cannot return to him void
[1:44:42] they're a part of his word
[1:44:44] so it can't return to him void
[1:44:46] amen is anything too hard for the lord
[1:44:49] sometimes we're trying to have the last
[1:44:51] word and you know why that is because
[1:44:52] we're trying to make it about us
[1:44:55] and it's not about us
[1:44:57] i've said it before when you we look at
[1:44:59] the example remember when joshua and
[1:45:00] he's standing on the edge of the jordan
[1:45:02] and he sees a man drawing with the sword
[1:45:03] he says are you for us or against us and
[1:45:05] he says neither
[1:45:06] no
[1:45:07] he says but what i'm a captain for the
[1:45:10] host of the lord i'm for the word is
[1:45:11] what he was saying i'm for the lord if
[1:45:13] you're with the lord then that's great
[1:45:15] but i'm not with you you got to be with
[1:45:16] me
[1:45:17] and when we make it about us what we're
[1:45:19] saying is god is with us no no no what
[1:45:22] the question is is are you with god
[1:45:24] then it's about god and it's not about
[1:45:26] you and then he's got a place to work
[1:45:27] but if you make it all about you what's
[1:45:28] he going to do he's got nothing to
[1:45:30] respond to but if you make it about the
[1:45:31] word now he can respond to that because
[1:45:33] his word can never return void we'll
[1:45:35] mess up time and time again i return
[1:45:38] void all the time but the word in me
[1:45:40] never returns void and then it always
[1:45:42] brings out what it's supposed to do even
[1:45:43] when i'm getting in its way even when
[1:45:45] i'm bringing up thorns and briars
[1:45:47] out of it still comes a fir tree out of
[1:45:48] it still comes up murderly man
[1:45:50] so what is it when we make it about us
[1:45:52] then nothing can happen but when we say
[1:45:53] god
[1:45:54] listen you've got this
[1:45:57] this is about your word this is about
[1:45:59] your promise
[1:46:01] whether it's about your children whether
[1:46:02] it's about your marriage whether it's
[1:46:04] about your business you called me you
[1:46:06] placed me you gave me these things and
[1:46:08] so i'm just putting them back into your
[1:46:09] hands you've got it
[1:46:11] we'll let you handle it amen i'll shut
[1:46:14] up lord and i'll let your word speak for
[1:46:16] me
[1:46:17] i love what uh we heard in in in the
[1:46:19] tape i think in three kinds of believers
[1:46:21] i think that's what it was where brother
[1:46:22] brown says you confess what the word
[1:46:25] says he says and that's what you're
[1:46:26] looking for confess what the word says
[1:46:29] don't confess your thoughts don't
[1:46:30] confess your preference confess what the
[1:46:32] word says and that's where you can hang
[1:46:34] your hat on you can hang your life on it
[1:46:36] amen it's not about us it's about the
[1:46:37] word of god not returning void
[1:46:40] and the question is are you the word
[1:46:42] or are you not and if you are then it
[1:46:44] can't come back to god without doing
[1:46:46] what it's supposed to amen what do you
[1:46:48] say to moses stand still moses said
[1:46:49] stand still and see the salvation of god
[1:46:51] praise the lord
[1:46:53] god told moses what to do i read quotes
[1:46:54] there where brother bram says he has no
[1:46:56] voice but yours no hands but yours no
[1:46:58] feet but yours but you've got to speak
[1:47:00] what the word speaks
[1:47:01] then you can be expectant amen
[1:47:04] we heard this last sunday
[1:47:06] moses was a believer
[1:47:09] can you say i'm a believer this morning
[1:47:12] watch what a believer did
[1:47:14] though he tried intellectually he had
[1:47:16] tried every scheme he could but it
[1:47:17] wouldn't work he tried to take israel
[1:47:20] out know that he was called to do it he
[1:47:22] tried the mathematical way he tried the
[1:47:24] military way he tried the educational
[1:47:27] way he tried every way but it wouldn't
[1:47:29] work and then he took god's way
[1:47:32] what happened he says there was a fire
[1:47:34] on a bush up there one day that wouldn't
[1:47:37] leave
[1:47:38] he won't leave
[1:47:40] he's just waiting for you to get what
[1:47:43] a view
[1:47:44] there's something there that's doing
[1:47:46] what it doesn't normally do
[1:47:48] there's a fire there there's a light
[1:47:50] there that doesn't burn out
[1:47:52] i want to go see what that is
[1:47:54] he says and from there the word spoke to
[1:47:56] him and said i am not i was or i will be
[1:48:01] i am and he is still the i am he is the
[1:48:04] word the eternal everlasting word
[1:48:08] so when moses has tried all those things
[1:48:10] and when he came to god what did he let
[1:48:12] go of his thoughts
[1:48:14] and his ambition and his purpose because
[1:48:16] moses was thinking this is about me
[1:48:19] i'm the deliverer
[1:48:22] what did god say i have heard the voices
[1:48:25] of my children
[1:48:26] i have come down to deliver them not you
[1:48:29] moses moses you're the tool but it's not
[1:48:31] about you it's about me coming down to
[1:48:32] deliver now moses gets a new purpose he
[1:48:35] gets a new ambition and it is only to do
[1:48:37] what god tells him to do
[1:48:38] and all of a sudden he is the deliverer
[1:48:40] he was all along but he couldn't do it
[1:48:42] in his own way but once he catches that
[1:48:44] i am all of a sudden now he's got his
[1:48:46] ambition his purpose and he's got faith
[1:48:48] to do it brother brad says an old man
[1:48:50] scraggly beard flowing down the front of
[1:48:52] his chest with an old stick where you
[1:48:53] going moses i'm going to deliver israel
[1:48:56] where's your math education experience
[1:48:58] yeah we left that in the desert
[1:49:01] what do you have a stick and thus saith
[1:49:04] the lord
[1:49:05] beautiful
[1:49:06] good luck with that moses and he did it
[1:49:08] and god brought them out with a mighty
[1:49:10] hand amen
[1:49:13] we heard this again i really enjoyed
[1:49:15] that three kinds of believers tape i
[1:49:16] took four pages of notes on it i think
[1:49:18] he says but just remember god is always
[1:49:21] on the scene
[1:49:23] see he's right there
[1:49:25] ready
[1:49:26] at any time
[1:49:30] i want to read the last word for our
[1:49:31] lives this morning
[1:49:33] i want to encourage you this morning
[1:49:35] jeremiah 29 4 it says thus saith the
[1:49:37] lord of hosts
[1:49:38] the god of israel
[1:49:40] unto all that are carried away captives
[1:49:43] whom i have caused to be carried away
[1:49:45] from jerusalem into babylon
[1:49:47] bilgi houses and dwell on them and plant
[1:49:49] gardens and eat the fruit of them where
[1:49:51] jerusalem no babylon
[1:49:54] takey wives and beget sons and daughters
[1:49:56] and take wives for your sons and give
[1:49:58] your daughters to husbands that they may
[1:49:59] bear sons and daughters that ye may be
[1:50:01] increased there and not diminished
[1:50:04] so many times have you heard people say
[1:50:06] i don't want to bring a child into this
[1:50:07] world
[1:50:08] it's too horrible it's too black it's
[1:50:10] too bleak it's too weird it's too
[1:50:13] strange it's too corrupt i hear all
[1:50:15] sorts of people saying that i even hear
[1:50:16] believers saying that that's not what
[1:50:18] the word says
[1:50:20] he says when you're in babylon he says
[1:50:22] increase because there's a promise for
[1:50:25] you
[1:50:25] amen
[1:50:27] he says and seek the peace of the city
[1:50:29] whether i have caused you to be carried
[1:50:31] away captives and pray unto the lord for
[1:50:34] it for in the peace thereof you shall
[1:50:36] have peace he didn't say seek peace for
[1:50:38] jerusalem he said seek peace for babylon
[1:50:40] he says you are where you are because i
[1:50:42] allowed it
[1:50:43] don't give up hope but pray for peace
[1:50:45] while you're there because you're going
[1:50:46] to need it
[1:50:48] for thus saith the lord of hosts we want
[1:50:50] thus saith the lord here it is the god
[1:50:52] of israel let not your prophets and your
[1:50:54] diviners that be in the midst of you
[1:50:56] deceive you neither hearken to your
[1:50:58] dreams which you caused to be dreamed
[1:51:00] for they prophesy falsely unto you in my
[1:51:02] name i have not sent them saith the lord
[1:51:05] what was it everybody's saying you're
[1:51:06] going to get out you're going to get out
[1:51:07] you're going to get out
[1:51:08] get ready to go we're getting ready to
[1:51:10] go getting ready to go he says no no
[1:51:12] that's not it
[1:51:13] he says for thus saith the lord that
[1:51:15] after 70 years will be accomplished at
[1:51:17] babylon
[1:51:19] everyone wants to be the prophet with
[1:51:20] good news and so that's what they give
[1:51:22] good news good news we're going to get
[1:51:25] out trump's going to get the second
[1:51:26] presidency
[1:51:28] how many prophets prophesied that down
[1:51:30] the states every single one of them
[1:51:32] wrong and yet we'll still give them
[1:51:33] credence not us but other people will
[1:51:35] prophesied completely incorrectly and
[1:51:37] yet we're still listening to them out
[1:51:39] there messed up
[1:51:40] why because they gave the people what
[1:51:42] they wanted to hear he says don't listen
[1:51:43] to people that give you what you want to
[1:51:45] hear listen to people that give you what
[1:51:46] the word says amen he says for thus
[1:51:49] saith the lord after 70 years be
[1:51:51] accomplished at babylon i will visit you
[1:51:54] and perform my good word toward you
[1:52:00] in causing you to return to this place
[1:52:02] amen there's a time and there's a season
[1:52:04] for god's good word to go into action
[1:52:07] and he says you've got to wait 70 years
[1:52:08] for this but when it says
[1:52:10] it's time it's time and nothing's going
[1:52:12] to stop it
[1:52:14] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:52:16] towards you saith the lord thoughts of
[1:52:18] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:52:20] expected end i love this scripture it
[1:52:22] says unexpected ends that means there's
[1:52:24] something you can be an expectation of
[1:52:26] and be sure of
[1:52:28] because what his word will not return
[1:52:31] unto him void amen the thought of god
[1:52:33] expressed is his word and it leans to a
[1:52:35] definitive result
[1:52:38] god doesn't hide his intentions that's
[1:52:39] what i love about god
[1:52:41] he sits there and he says there's good
[1:52:43] things coming you've got pain on this
[1:52:45] earth you're gonna have to dwell in
[1:52:46] laodicea for a while
[1:52:48] you're gonna have to put up with all of
[1:52:50] the junk that's going on you're gonna
[1:52:52] have to have it rubbed in your face and
[1:52:53] you're gonna have to get it rubbed in
[1:52:54] your nose and you're gonna have to be
[1:52:56] turning your head every time you walk or
[1:52:57] drive down the street or go through a
[1:52:58] mall but he says after a while he says
[1:53:01] what
[1:53:02] something's going to happen
[1:53:03] and it's take you out of it and it's
[1:53:04] going to bring you back to the place
[1:53:06] that you came from it's going to take
[1:53:07] you back to your garden of eden amen
[1:53:10] he says then shall you call upon me and
[1:53:12] you shall go and pray unto me and i will
[1:53:15] hearken unto you
[1:53:16] listen they were praying to get out
[1:53:18] we're praying to get out aren't we
[1:53:20] but we ain't going until he says it's
[1:53:22] time to go
[1:53:23] there's a place and there's a time to
[1:53:25] find for it and then and when that
[1:53:26] trumpet sounds
[1:53:28] that final trumpet that last word goes
[1:53:30] that last one's in then what does he say
[1:53:32] time to go
[1:53:34] he says then you're going to call on me
[1:53:35] that's why i believe brother joe's read
[1:53:37] this quote where he says a young you
[1:53:38] know a young boy or a young girl should
[1:53:40] be able to raise their hands and say
[1:53:41] lord i'm coming home
[1:53:43] that's the fulfillment of this where
[1:53:44] they say lord i'm coming home why you're
[1:53:46] calling on him to take you because
[1:53:48] there's an unction now that's greater
[1:53:49] than anything because you know you're in
[1:53:51] the rapture season
[1:53:52] and then the holy spirit drops down and
[1:53:54] we'll read a quote about it a little bit
[1:53:55] later where that holy spirit drops down
[1:53:57] it's going to take us completely off of
[1:53:58] this
[1:53:59] i think i've got it might be in the next
[1:54:00] service amen
[1:54:02] he says and you shall seek me
[1:54:05] and find me
[1:54:06] praise the lord
[1:54:08] we've been seeking a long time
[1:54:11] and we found him and we found him and we
[1:54:12] found him but we're going to find more
[1:54:14] and more and more of him aren't we
[1:54:19] when ye shall search for me
[1:54:21] with all your heart
[1:54:23] when you've heeded the voice when
[1:54:25] everything that's shaken has shaken off
[1:54:27] and then when you've dedicated your life
[1:54:29] your thoughts your time your money your
[1:54:31] effort to one thing and that's seeking
[1:54:33] the will and purpose of god in your life
[1:54:35] he says that's when you're going to find
[1:54:36] me
[1:54:40] and i will be found of you saith the
[1:54:42] lord and i will turn away your captivity
[1:54:45] and i will gather you from all the
[1:54:46] nations and from all the places where i
[1:54:49] have driven you saith the lord and i
[1:54:51] will bring you again unto the place once
[1:54:53] i caused you to be carried away captive
[1:54:57] an angel drove us out of eden
[1:54:59] another one's gonna drive us back as
[1:55:00] we've read that quote before him and
[1:55:02] what's taking you captive in your life
[1:55:03] this morning
[1:55:05] what have you lost
[1:55:07] what have we lost
[1:55:08] we've lost loved ones
[1:55:10] we've lost health
[1:55:12] we've lost joy
[1:55:13] we've lost peace
[1:55:15] we've lost patience
[1:55:18] the gifts of the holy spirit the fruit
[1:55:20] of the holy spirit is available to every
[1:55:21] believer
[1:55:23] you got the holy ghost there's nothing
[1:55:24] that you can't have from love joy peace
[1:55:26] patience kindness goodness faith
[1:55:27] gentleness and self-control
[1:55:29] none of that you have to put up with
[1:55:32] but then there's the blessings the
[1:55:33] redemptive blessings amen the healing
[1:55:35] the deliverance and all these different
[1:55:36] things amen
[1:55:37] everything is available this morning
[1:55:41] remember we preached that sermon we
[1:55:42] talked about he said i could go free
[1:55:45] right
[1:55:46] everything is free for the believer this
[1:55:48] morning
[1:55:50] the doors of captivity have been opened
[1:55:53] and we're on our way back
[1:55:55] we just haven't gotten there yet
[1:55:57] but we're looking for everyone that
[1:55:58] needs to go back to join in the caravan
[1:56:00] aren't we
[1:56:01] to get tied in
[1:56:03] to get joined up
[1:56:04] to get made part of our part of the body
[1:56:06] amen
[1:56:11] i've got family so far on left field now
[1:56:12] you think how can they even come back
[1:56:15] worst of the worst the craziest or the
[1:56:16] craziest
[1:56:18] guess what
[1:56:19] i was crazy
[1:56:21] just in my head
[1:56:24] listen uh someone away from god is
[1:56:26] someone away from god it doesn't matter
[1:56:27] if they're a million miles or one mile
[1:56:28] you're still out of god
[1:56:30] right the arm of the lord is not so
[1:56:31] short that he can't bring them back
[1:56:33] what are we doing what's our confession
[1:56:35] what is the last word that we're
[1:56:37] speaking in our prayers when we go to
[1:56:38] god
[1:56:40] right are we repeating his word back to
[1:56:41] them
[1:56:42] are we repeating the situation back to
[1:56:44] him
[1:56:46] i think too many times in prayer i share
[1:56:48] too much of what the situation is rather
[1:56:50] than what the word says the situation
[1:56:51] could be
[1:56:53] amen
[1:56:54] god's looking for people that will say
[1:56:56] one thing lord i believe you and i'll
[1:56:59] rest on your word
[1:57:00] i look at saul you talk about too far
[1:57:02] that the lord can't help you saul was on
[1:57:05] the road to damascus the antichrist
[1:57:07] spirit on him to persecute the true
[1:57:10] church of god
[1:57:11] and he hasn't he has a a moment with the
[1:57:14] pillar of fire
[1:57:16] listen sometimes we're wanting our kids
[1:57:18] to get into church
[1:57:19] saul didn't get into church
[1:57:21] saul was on his way to the bar
[1:57:23] right saul was on his his way to to
[1:57:25] fornicate saul was on his way to to to
[1:57:28] go to some crazy left-wing thing
[1:57:31] or right thing thing right-wing thing
[1:57:32] for that matter
[1:57:34] right you don't have to be in church for
[1:57:35] the holy spirit to drop down and touch
[1:57:37] you
[1:57:38] i remember the story of philip roncalli
[1:57:41] i think it was
[1:57:42] it might have been somebody else
[1:57:44] and his sister's in
[1:57:46] in a meeting at brother tim pruitt's
[1:57:47] there and she's in there and everyone's
[1:57:49] come up to the altar and they're praying
[1:57:51] for the loved ones
[1:57:52] and and she's up there and she's praying
[1:57:54] for him and he's back home and he thinks
[1:57:57] the rapture has happened and he runs i
[1:58:00] believe in his pajamas to church
[1:58:03] and get saved
[1:58:06] wasn't in church when that started
[1:58:08] but what happened there were people
[1:58:10] calling on the name of the lord that
[1:58:11] were confessing the word for the
[1:58:13] salvation of his soul and he came back
[1:58:15] and he's never left since
[1:58:18] we don't have to get him in church we
[1:58:19] have to get them in the presence of god
[1:58:21] and all they need is one moment
[1:58:24] with a burning bush experience and
[1:58:25] they'll change their life forever
[1:58:27] whether or not they're in this church
[1:58:29] amen
[1:58:30] that's what we're looking for
[1:58:33] as we start to close i want to read this
[1:58:34] one quote brother braham says if the
[1:58:36] church would come back and make god's
[1:58:38] word their ultimate
[1:58:39] make god's word their tie post that
[1:58:42] would do it
[1:58:44] but they're trying they're tying to a
[1:58:46] man-made achievement and it's bound to
[1:58:48] fail
[1:58:49] he says well the bible said they would
[1:58:50] do it but there is going to be a bride
[1:58:52] that's been elected since the foundation
[1:58:55] of the world that's going to be tied to
[1:58:57] that thai post i can see eternity break
[1:59:00] come down into time since eden and when
[1:59:02] it did there come a line of blood all
[1:59:05] the way up unto calvary and from calvary
[1:59:08] tied with this line and goes to the
[1:59:10] typhos jesus
[1:59:12] he says and someday when he comes to
[1:59:14] claim his own everyone that's tied to
[1:59:17] that ultimate will be raised up into
[1:59:19] eternity everyone
[1:59:22] amen not where they are now
[1:59:25] everyone that's tied
[1:59:27] everyone that's got that seed gene of
[1:59:28] god inside of them they're going up
[1:59:31] he says why they have been in eternity
[1:59:34] all the time they were predestinated in
[1:59:36] turn in eternity they are part of god
[1:59:40] they were in his thinking at the
[1:59:42] beginning and when that big rope is
[1:59:44] pulled of the line of the blood that
[1:59:47] token i was speaking of when it comes up
[1:59:49] from the earth everyone that was
[1:59:51] included in that blood will be dropped
[1:59:54] right up into eternity again but the
[1:59:56] only way it'll be will be tied to that
[1:59:59] absolute jesus christ
[2:00:01] he says it's absolute not an achievement
[2:00:03] of man but god raised him up from the
[2:00:05] dead and he is the absolute and we know
[2:00:08] he's alive because he is here with us in
[2:00:10] the power of his resurrection doing the
[2:00:12] same thing he did when he was here on
[2:00:14] earth
[2:00:15] he says i'm tied to the ultimate
[2:00:18] that's the end of all strife i'm tied to
[2:00:21] it that's my life i was a sinner when
[2:00:24] christ saved me
[2:00:26] i'm at something and since that came
[2:00:28] into me it's been different
[2:00:31] and i'm tied to it everything that i am
[2:00:34] is tied right there and then god's
[2:00:36] separating his life and let me live in
[2:00:39] him and him and me them were tied it
[2:00:42] doesn't make any difference what others
[2:00:44] want to believe
[2:00:46] to the individual you are tied to that
[2:00:48] that's your ultimate that's the last
[2:00:50] word
[2:00:52] he says and then if he is the word then
[2:00:55] this must be the last word
[2:00:57] that must settle it
[2:00:59] whatever that says that's that scarlet
[2:01:02] thread that is christ and anything
[2:01:04] contrary to that i know nothing about it
[2:01:07] can you say this morning i'll know
[2:01:08] nothing about it
[2:01:10] i won't feed on it i won't look at it i
[2:01:12] won't confess it i won't talk about it
[2:01:14] i'll know nothing about it
[2:01:21] that's what we want to know is what the
[2:01:23] word says for i am tied to christ and
[2:01:26] christ is the word he says you get it
[2:01:28] now
[2:01:29] and the portion of his word that's
[2:01:31] allotted for this day
[2:01:33] his holy spirit is here to manifest that
[2:01:36] portion of word amen
[2:01:39] what does the last word bring he says
[2:01:42] it brings the end of all
[2:01:45] strife
[2:01:48] it's the end of all worrying it's the
[2:01:50] end of all wondering it's the end of all
[2:01:52] fighting it's the end of all struggling
[2:01:55] how many times did god yank david out of
[2:01:57] trouble
[2:01:59] how many times did saul had the complete
[2:02:00] mountain surrounded no way out
[2:02:03] and god comes and he sends a messenger
[2:02:05] says there's a battle here there's a
[2:02:06] problem here and saul has to run away
[2:02:09] david's pinned in a cave
[2:02:11] and god saves him time and time again
[2:02:15] what is it david didn't even have to
[2:02:17] fight david didn't even have to lift up
[2:02:19] a weapon against saul
[2:02:21] all his life
[2:02:22] and the one time he did he repented of
[2:02:24] it
[2:02:25] all he did was cut the hem of his
[2:02:27] garment the skirt of his garment
[2:02:29] the only time he did it was when he was
[2:02:31] goaded into it by somebody
[2:02:33] every other battle david didn't have to
[2:02:35] fight against his own people god kept
[2:02:37] taking them away and away and away he
[2:02:39] wouldn't get him to raise a sword
[2:02:40] against them
[2:02:44] how many times did he do the miraculous
[2:02:46] for israel they need water they need
[2:02:48] food they need shelter they need light
[2:02:51] whatever it is cloud by day a pillar of
[2:02:53] fire by night he brings quails he brings
[2:02:55] mana he brings water
[2:02:57] every time they needed it he was there
[2:02:58] for it
[2:03:00] what is this the end of struggling and
[2:03:02] strife that doesn't mean you're not
[2:03:03] going to battle
[2:03:05] we'll always have that till we take a
[2:03:06] rapture but the struggling so many times
[2:03:08] is because we think we're going to lose
[2:03:12] we think that it's our fighting that's
[2:03:13] going to make us win
[2:03:15] no we fight because there is somebody
[2:03:17] arrayed against us
[2:03:19] but the battle is the lord's not ours
[2:03:22] he's the one that's fighting amen
[2:03:24] remember where he we we
[2:03:25] the the quote was there in the three
[2:03:27] kinds of believers about david where he
[2:03:29] says that that david threw the rock but
[2:03:31] god directed it
[2:03:33] you're the hands and feet but it's god
[2:03:35] that brings the result
[2:03:37] it's god that does the work
[2:03:39] you might be the hands and feet but it's
[2:03:40] god that's giving the effect that we
[2:03:42] need in our lives amen peter's in prison
[2:03:45] they're having a prayer meeting over
[2:03:46] there and they're praying get prison get
[2:03:48] peter out of prison and what happens the
[2:03:50] angel of the lord comes in and he takes
[2:03:51] peter right out of prison like that
[2:03:54] goes to the door and wrote answers and
[2:03:56] she says who's there peter she runs up
[2:03:58] and says peter's ghost is at the door
[2:04:00] that's how quickly god answered prayer
[2:04:03] amen amen
[2:04:04] but it was a work of his not a work of
[2:04:06] peters
[2:04:08] they're just trusting and god makes a
[2:04:09] way because it wasn't peter's time to go
[2:04:14] struggling because we think it's up to
[2:04:15] us and struggling because we think our
[2:04:17] efforts make the difference we've got to
[2:04:18] fight
[2:04:19] resist the devil
[2:04:21] and he'll flee from you
[2:04:23] but the effect is the lord's it's not
[2:04:24] ours amen i can't make it happen
[2:04:27] and that's why i struggle so often is
[2:04:29] because i think i can make it happen
[2:04:31] no i'll fight
[2:04:32] to hold to the word and i'll let the
[2:04:34] word take care of the situation amen
[2:04:38] amen if we can all stand and the
[2:04:39] musicians come
[2:04:41] we have a part to play but the reason we
[2:04:43] make it
[2:04:44] is not of our own efforts
[2:04:46] it's because his word won't return to us
[2:04:48] void
[2:04:49] amen his word has gone forth he said
[2:04:51] he'll have a spotless bride
[2:04:53] he said there's going to be an overcomer
[2:04:54] in this age
[2:04:56] he said there's going to be people that
[2:04:57] will search them with all their heart
[2:04:58] and soul and strength
[2:05:01] amen
[2:05:03] amen that's why we're at the end
[2:05:05] of all strife it's because the word's
[2:05:07] gone out
[2:05:08] we can't lose
[2:05:09] you can't lose and guess what he can't
[2:05:11] lose a 1.
[2:05:13] he told the disciples he says i won't
[2:05:14] lose a single one that the father has
[2:05:15] given me
[2:05:17] so no matter where you're at where your
[2:05:19] loved ones are at where your co-workers
[2:05:22] are at where your neighbors are at what
[2:05:24] situation you're in it doesn't matter if
[2:05:26] the word has said it's going to come
[2:05:27] through and the word has said that he
[2:05:29] says my thoughts to you are for what
[2:05:30] good not of
[2:05:32] evil he wants to bring us to a place
[2:05:35] where his thoughts are going to achieve
[2:05:36] good
[2:05:37] but you got to get back to his word you
[2:05:38] got to stand under that umbrella so that
[2:05:40] you can be blessed by it because outside
[2:05:42] of that umbrella there's only judgment
[2:05:43] amen he wants us to draw closer to him
[2:05:46] amen
[2:05:47] amen let's bow our heads heavenly father

[2:05:54] for our day

[2:06:03] and daughters of god
[2:06:05] lord if there's anything we want lord

[2:06:08] would produce
[2:06:10] lord but it's not in our trying that's
[2:06:12] going to make it happen
[2:06:14] lord it's not in our doing that's going
[2:06:15] to make it happen lord but it's because
[2:06:16] your word said that it was going to
[2:06:18] happen that we can have a confidence and
[2:06:20] a trust that as we move forward lord the
[2:06:22] process is going to work amen and lord

[2:06:32] that we get rid of the strivings lord
[2:06:34] that we get out of the battles lord that
[2:06:35] we've got ourselves into lord and that
[2:06:37] we seek lord to find your will and your
[2:06:39] way in our lives each one
[2:06:41] lord that our purpose
