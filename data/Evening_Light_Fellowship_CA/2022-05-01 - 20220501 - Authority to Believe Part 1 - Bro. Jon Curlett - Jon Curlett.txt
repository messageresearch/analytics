this morning to our lives heavenly father as we've set aside this time this day to just spend time in your presence lord to fellowship with you lord we're asking the grace of your presence lord to just be in this service to speak to hearts and lives heavenly father lord you know what each one needs lord i've laid myself before you and study but we're trusting you to lead this morning heavenly father lord that you would just have your way we ask lord grant me grace give me strength to preach this morning lord god lord and give the the hearers grace to hear it we pray lord just have your way now we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you and then turn to hebrews 11 if you would this morning hebrews chapter 11. let me start reading the first verse amen pray for me this morning i've been sick but if ron spencer can preach with stage four cancer then i can preach with a sore throat and a cold amen so just trusting that my voice will make it through the service amen hebrews chapter 11 very familiar scripture of course verse 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report down to verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i mean god bless his word you can be seated this morning i want to take a a few services on on a new topic this is no by no means a a big series we're going to do but i want to take a a serious title of authority to believe and then authority to believe and in studying this and and just uh the different things that have been going on in my own life in the lives of others it struck me how so often in life we are we are in a position we're in a place of responsibility and because we are there we're expected to have everything it takes to be good at doing that amen so as a parent perhaps you get married and you have a child and the expectation is that you're going to raise that child exactly right and that you're going to do all things well and that you're going to know what to do in certain situations and you're going to know how to do it and you're going to have the discernment to know when the baby is just trying to pull one over on you when it's genuinely in pain and when it's genuinely in need you know and and you come into different situations in life maybe as an employee and you're promoted to boss for the first time and all of a sudden everybody isn't it but i want to tell you today if you have the holy ghost you have faith for the rapture amen now you may not realize you have it but you have the capacity for faith for the rapture today brother branham says when you get the holy ghost he says you have the ability to create a world and go live on it but you can't because the laws of god forbid you from doing it it's not in his will or his way so if you've got enough faith in you if you've got enough power in you to go create a world and live on it then you've got enough faith in you to go and take a rapture amen to rise from the dead even you know as christ did this morning amen but i want to to read a quote here and i don't have it in the slides there for the matter brother vaishal so i'm going to just read it from my phone this morning because i i was listening to as the eagle stir her nest this morning and and it struck me because i had some examples and i thought i'll just use what the prophet shared this morning so i'm going to read it from my phone here and he's he's talking about the mother eagle and she's made her nest and and she's put the eggs in there and then they they they've hatched and they've grown into into little eaglets he says and she's sitting there and knocking off all those little old feathers out because if they don't they don't have enough feathers left to take the flight she won't take them until all them little old baby feathers blows out of them so you see little baby birds when they're born they just have basically little dustings of fur and and feathers on them they're not flight feathers they're just warmth feathers but he says that little mother that mother eagle is knocking out all those little ones so that they can grow in the big feathers that will help them to fly amen he says but then she comes from up there and she screams she is ready to give them some experience then she throws her great big 14 foot wings out like that and these little eagles reach over and climb up she's talking to them because they have heard her voice they know to trust her how to fly and she says now children i'm going to take you on a solo flight and each one goes over and gets his little foot and catches onto the wing puts his little bill against one of them feathers he says he can pull it out it'll hold 50 eagles for the power of that feather in his wing he holds across the feathers like that and the old mother lifts her wings like that and flies off of the rock so she's taking them out of the nest on their first solo flight he says here she goes sailing up up up up until she gets way up into the blue way high them little fellows had never been there before oh they're just having them a wonderful time and then the holy spirit catches you into this amazing experience in your personal life in church wherever it might be and he lifts you up high but i want you to catch what happens now the first thing you know you know what she does in the middle of their wonderful experience she turns right over and shakes them off every one they're eagles they ought to know how to fly you're a believer you ought to know how to believe that's what he's saying amen they ought to know how to fly that's exactly right she shakes them right off to their self now you're not latched on to me now you're not flying by my power but you've got to learn to use the same power that i have to do what i'm doing right she says all right children your eagles fly now as long as you say well i belong to this church i tell you i don't know about that you'll never fly uh-uh uh-uh all right you need to get shook off one time up in the air then little eagles begin to fly now i want you to catch what this flight looks like she'll holler flop your wings children just keep flopping your little faith up and down you're high enough now that you won't hit the earth takes them way high up he doesn't just take her she doesn't just take them to the top of a tree she takes them fifteen hundred feet up in the air two thousand feet up in the air and she says flop and fly it won't matter what happens because you're not going to hit the earth you got lots of room to fall amen and then what does she does and then what she does she darts out to one side and watches them she just sails around and here they are just exactly like a pentecostal revival just topsy-turvy one over one the other one just a flapping all of them acting they don't care they've got supreme confidence in their mommy that's out there watching them okay then he says that how ought the church ought to do that if one of them the little eagles gets out of balance then she swepts right down with them big wings picks him up and bears him into grace again amen right now that's not baptist teaching that's the bible so it brings him right back up shakes him off again and lets him start a new amen what does he say oh you're an eagle you failed no no no takes them up by grace and says let's do this again and again and again and again until what that eagle learns how to fly them eagles has got confidence in their mothers supreme confidence that that mother will help them bear them up again bear them up on wings of eagles and take them up there and shake them off again let him start again then he quotes a song if i fail or if i fail let me rise and try again oh lord he says go again god will lift you right back up take you up there and shake you off again try to balance yourself and just keep going just keep flopping till you learn how to fly he says oh my so we see the prophet of god he doesn't he doesn't get on us because we don't have everything that we we don't act like an eagle every time we act like an ego but we don't always have the capacity in our learning to do what an eagle has to do is what he's saying but he says it's in you so don't stop trying because one time it didn't work out perfectly your first time it didn't work out perfectly but he says keep going keep going keep going and he's likening it to the faith of the church amen that she's got to learn to fly on what the power of the holy spirit within her to bring her to an expected end amen amen i fee i feel like faith is like this and that's that you're here as a believer and i can't give you faith i can't give it to you and we'll get into that why in the next couple of services amen but what i can do is point you to the source i can inspire what you have within you but i can't give it to you it's something that you have to have yourself amen and it's something that's been in the back of my mind for many months now and i think we're at a crossroads in our lives and i say that universally not this church personally or just not me personally but i think we're at a crossroads in our life in across the world as believers that we have to know who we have believed what we have believed and what effect it's supposed to have in our lives amen it is not just enough and i know i keep saying in service it is not just enough to be identified with this message anymore that was a carrier it was a carrier for life but the life still has to come out of that message amen the life if it stays on the page will kill you because it will condemn you because you can't do it but the holy spirit inside of you is the life of that message amen brother brown says this he says i think it's time if somebody can hit that this doesn't seem to be working here i think it's come to a time that we've got to know how we stand he says how can you do anything unless you've got faith in what you're doing you've got to have faith and that's my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the believers faith and confidence in what they are standing for because it is the word of god then as long as through the scripture it's sovereignly placed from genesis into revelation back and forth up and down not a way for the devil to move in there then you've got perfect confidence see you know where you're standing now i'm going to say many things in these services because the prophet said them i'm going to say many things because the scripture says them i'm not going to say them because i have all of it okay i want you to understand it i'm looking for more faith i'm looking to grow in faith i'm looking to grow in grace i'm looking to have more the manifestation of the faith of god in my life so i am by no means preaching to you from a position of i have all of this amen this is for me as much if not more for me as it is for you amen i'm expecting more of god amen and this is where it starts is that we look into the word and we say what does god have to say of it amen so we're going to take i think four services on this and this is really just a prep for the course amen i'm not going to get into anything deep i'm not going to get any real teaching but this is more of a preaching to get us in the mindset of what it's going to be like to to be able to to understand faith and to be able to take faith and have it move in our life amen but i want to share a quote that a minister shared with me some time ago and and it really it really struck me when when he when he sent it to me and he says there's another great event that i won't forget to call and that was when david was in his worst of time when he was a fugitive he had already been anointed he know what he was to be he was to be king god said so and yet he was hated he was standing in between two deep great deep fires here is the philistines on one side after him and here was saul on the other side and he was a man without a nation just as a church stands today the true living church of god without a denomination or anything else she stands alone but yet she's had the anointing poured on her she knows what she is you know you're an eagle this morning because you've heard the eagle voice and responded to something that was inside of you amen but let's see where this goes he says how in the world can it ever come to pass the devil on both sides driving at david he says david's annoying to be king but he's caught between two pinschers and they're trying to snuff his life out he had taken refuge in strongholds in the wilderness and in caves trying to hide out with a little band of faithful warriors just a few believing like him but those men believe god that that would be the king so is the believers today who is hid out from place to place but yet they know who was coming to be king i don't care who's going to be president i know he's coming and looks further away than it ever did when science is trying to overrule and saying they can build a man they can do this they can take a rabbit and take the pollen take another rabbit and so forth trying to disprove god's word he's saying that man is coming to the point where he can create can't create but he can manipulate the creation to make it look like he's creating he says they're trying to disprove god's word yet there is a people who believe god who stands just as pat as they ever did no matter what comes or goes they still believe god god is right they hold to god's unchanging hands in the midst of the battle in the midst of tears in the midst of sickness and death and everything they still hold to god's unchanging hand they know that he is coming king people today laugh at them and make fun of them and call their holy rollers call them everything they want to but then warriors of god stands faithful at the post of duty might call them a healing group you might call them a bunch of fanatics or whatever you wish to they hang to that king they know he is coming in power though they take his name in vain and scoff and make fun call the people who believe him outcast a bunch of backwash that doesn't bother them a bit they stay true at the post of duty those warriors who was with david stay right by his side if a philistine come up he had to fight whoever it was they were picked on every side poor david in his mind all confused and he thought how can it be lord okay look into your life and say how can it be lord you've anointed me to be something and yet all i face is trouble and trials and battles day in and day out he says you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know they're going through when you think of promises god has made then why don't it come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate with but there's many flusterations in the heart of a real leader now the man that shared it with me shared it as a minister to a minister but look at this as a father amen look at this as a husband and you're looking and you're praying and you're seeking the will of god and the leadership of god and the provision of god and yet you're sitting there and all you're getting is battles and trials and battles and trials rather than the promise and he says you're sitting there and you're you're wondering why isn't coming to pass he says there's many frustrations amen i can speak there have been many frustrations there are still frustrations when the promise is there i'm walking according to the promise and yet there's no manifestation it can get frustrating at times he says david was sitting here there his throat burning it was in the middle of the summer the philistines was taking advantage of that split between david and saul and saul looking for david everywhere the philistines also and the philistines looking for the israelites talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now david had taken refuge in this little place in this little shelter everywhere he could get to the little strongholds that he could hold into he's just going from place to place place to place i'll hide out here for a while i'll take this scripture and i'll hide under that for a while then i'll go to the next one and i'll go the next one i'll go the next one lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe and you're just moving and you're just one step ahead of death every day he says then he got up on the mountain in that hot middle of the summer when the heat was tremendous his throat parching and the frustrations and fears in his hearts and wondering oh god how could it be you poured that oil upon me not because i chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the sheep out yonder and told me you give me this to serve your people and now you've got me between the fires everywhere he's saying what did i do to deserve this i didn't ask for this but you anointed me you chose me and you told me to serve your people and now i'm out here hiding out fighting for my life day in and day out what's this all about lord amen it's like i said last service there are times and i think we're in them to stay where we seem to be moving from trial to trial very quickly and there's not a lot of rest in between amen or the battle is just that long that it seems interminable and you're just going and going and going and every day you get up and you're facing a battle and you're facing a battle and you're facing a battle amen amen there's a lot going on because why we're at the end of the gentile age and god is wrapping things up and satan is unwrapping amen so the satanic power is dropping down into the earth in a way that it's never been felt before and god is wrapping up his power so it seems like the battle is stacked against us amen but in the midst of all of this we still have psalm 23. amen david said the lord is my shepherd i shall not want in the caves in the desert heat with his his throat parched without water battle score battle scarred weary warn the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul you know what restoration says it implies that we can get depleted worn out needy amen that we require something to be put back in that used to be there amen we need a refilling of the holy spirit like they did in acts 3 right we need our soul restored we need god to come back again i was listening to brother branham and he said that's what we need he said we need a refilling of the holy spirit why to prepare us to keep the battle going amen to give us strength he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil you've got to walk through the valley of the shadow of death so that you can experi you can experience the lack of fear amen thou anoi sorry thou for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff come for me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over amen in the caves in the battle my cup runeth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever that looks a lot like caves and of the chosen few many times it's not big crowds it's not big flashy things it's not a lot of publicity it's not a not a lot of greatness it looks a lot like work amen the glory of god in you looks a lot like a work day doesn't it because the battle is real what do they say today the struggle is real the struggle is real amen believers ought to be able to say the struggle is real amen so many times our recognition needs to be not why am i in this trial or why are my finances struggling or or what's going on in my marriage or why am i constantly dealing with an issue but we want to stop and ask ourselves why am i facing these challenges in the first place and we've got to look at the big picture rather than at the situation because if you can catch the big picture it'll take you through the situation you're in amen i believe when you ask yourself that correctly what do you remember i am a child of god those that come to me must be tried they must be tested and if they're not they are no longer his children they never were his children amen they've got to come through those trials and tribulations amen in order to be an overcomer there must be something to overcome in front of me amen i can't be an overcomer without a trial this is not meant to be a life of ease amen when you look in revelation 12 where it says that they overcame by two things it says they overcame by the blood of the lamb that's what he did for us and then it says they overcame by the word of their testimony and that's what he did through us okay so if you look at that and you you see very quickly that of those two things none of those have anything to do with your power strength might intellect education whatever it might be because the blood of the lamb that gives you power amen is his work at calvary and the testimony if you ever have a real testimony you know i had absolutely nothing to do with amen nothing to do with it it's like brother branham what he talks about you know when he was he was there and he was baptizing the angel came down he says i just happened to be there right because it had nothing to do with him as a person it was the power of god moving in him that's what a testimony is for you is the overcoming power of god working through you to overcome the situation in your life amen and the first thing he's overcoming is you and then he moves to overcome your life i was talking with brother weissel and i said sometimes i feel like we're praying the things out of our life that are supposed to give us the very thing we're asking for amen what are we trying to do we're we're we're bucking the trend of trying him trying to develop our character so that we can take the trial away and he's saying no no no you've character means there's a melting pot there's a beating process goes on there and we're trying to get that out of you and the only way it comes out is if you go through a trial or a tribulation amen amen the blood was his and the power to give you a testimony by the holy spirit is also his listen to this quote brother brown says but the works of jesus christ is done by the holy ghost when he comes to anoint the people so you can't do the works of christ unless you're anointed by the holy spirit to do that work not just anointed by the holy spirit but to do that work we'll get into that in a moment do you believe that certainly we believe it what would keep us from believing because god made the promise god said so when that settles it now man cannot do that it's supernatural it's something that man can't do so stop trying to do it we'll get to a quote where brother braham says stop trying to do it and just do it it's something that man can't do he says now while i've got just a couple minutes time i want to explain that see man can't do nothing it's god in man jesus said i'm the vine you are the branch now as long as a branch is in the vine it'll bear the fruit of the vine now god has always used men for his agent that's why he used his own son to unveil himself he came down and took the form of a man in order to die the death for men he could not die in the spirit but he was put to death in the flesh he says then god was in abraham god was in isaac god was in jacob god was in joseph god was in david he was in all those people back there then prophets and so forth it was god working through men now in this new testament age the blood of jesus christ cleanses his church and sanctifies it that his holy spirit might continue the work of god on through all the ages and he's just the same today if it isn't then then we're false witnesses of this bible if that isn't true then the bible isn't true it's time that men preach the gospel it's time that the power of god was made known when heathens try to step on the word we need men like the hebrew children our god is able to deliver us from this that's right it's time god remains the same now i want you to go back to that first statement that we do the works of jesus christ when we are the when we are anointed by the holy spirit to do it we aren't all anointed to do everything okay that's easy to prove there's a five full ministry and every genuine member of the five full ministry has the holy ghost and is a man okay he's a man and he's got the holy ghost you have to be that to be a member of the five full ministry but guess what to be a member of the bride of christ a man also has to have the holy ghost okay so you have a lot of men that are in the bride of christ anointed with the holy ghost but just because they're annoying with the holy ghost doesn't mean they're anointed to preach the gospel okay they have the anointing of the holy ghost but they're only anointed to do certain things and it's only those that are ordained to preach that are allowed to preach right so it's the same thing in your life don't go around saying i should be doing this and i should be doing that and i no no no he says as you're anointed to do it you do it so don't put pressure on yourself to do it but seek the anointing to meet the need amen if you have need of something if there's a situation there then you say lord i'm available i'm available if you want to use me but if you want to use brother david instead then go ahead and do it and then if you want to use sister brenda go ahead and do if you want to use sister lily go ahead and do it if you want to use brother jeremiah back there go and do it lord i'm a willing vessel but anoint the one that you want to do this work right we can't do it all and we're not expected to do it all so don't put pressure on yourself to do it all amen what is it that what as god inspires them according to the word or let me put it this way not contrary to the word then god can use a man or woman to do the very works of god now i'll speak from my own experience and the key for myself is to recognize what i am called to do to be committed with that to that and to be satisfied with that okay that's what i have to learn to do is to stay with what god has put me into and not try and branch into anything else and put it all on my heart all of my soul all of my strength into that area okay so if god has given you a gift and he's called you to use that gift then that's where you put your strength in your might amen but i don't go around seeking a bunch of other different things either you know it's like when we needed a new deacon and i said brothers i'm willing to stand in as a deacon but i don't believe that's what i'm called to do my calling is to preach the word so let me preach the word that's the best thing to do amen so whatever it might be in your life whether you're you're you're a leader in worship you know whether it's in singing specials whether it's in teaching the sunday school whether it's in hosting whatever it might be put all your soul and strength into that be anointed for that because that's what god calls you to do and don't try and strain yourself to do a bunch of other things fit into your portion of the body and stay there and we'll be a just a a wonderful tremendous body of christ amen amen and then when i'm in there i don't have to stretch myself because guess what god's gonna stretch me god's gonna pull me god's gonna make me grow to match the task that's in front of me amen and then i don't have to worry well am i anointed for this is this my place or is this my no no because he's anointed me to do it then i just step into it and he just starts growing me in it my confidence is high because i know that i'm sure that he called me to do that very thing amen amen the beautiful thing is that when you know you're in your place you don't have to pretend right because what happens when you're pretending is you're trying to prove yourself that's what pretenses is you're trying to prove it and it's not up to me to prove it it's up to me to believe it and it's up to him to prove it and then if i'm in the position he's placed me and if i'm doing what he's asked me to do then it's up to him to prove his word and all i'm doing is believing it that's how we prove his word is we believe it but i'm not going out there to try and prove myself to anybody nor should you to anybody else amen what you do is stand in your position believe the word act on the word of god and it's up to him to come behind and prove himself through it amen brother brown says this and i've read this many times he says i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward notice how i said that this way and that way left and right what are you either the you're on the left or you're on the right today aren't you if you're focused on that then what is it it's the spirit of the world he says the spirit of god pushes us up amen he says the spirit of god which is the word of god my spirit my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ and it will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the council churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory and out of it out of everything amen you can't force yourself into the rapture amen you can't make yourself an overcomer because if you can then anybody can right but that what that would eliminate the need for the holy spirit that would eliminate the need for a new birth that would eliminate the need for god to actually change your life if you can make it happen then we don't need god amen but what is it it's a work of god from start to finish and it starts with grace by grace through faith and that faith is not of yourself it's a gift of god and from there everything and we'll get into this later but everything that you do by faith is based on the very fact that he called you in the first place we'll bring it back to that is if he called me and he chose me then that means he'll carry me through the rest of the way amen but we have to realize what time we're in what place we're in and our position and purpose within that time and if we can believe that we're in a scriptural time and tied to the scriptures then that allows us to look with expectation for what is to come and not to put it all into the future but put it into the present day man i was studying something else and i ran into this next quote and it jumped out and i copied it into another file and i said i'm gonna i know i'm gonna preach on that and here we are today amen but it's the prophet of god and he's speaking about the woman at the will at the well he says now look quickly that predestinated seed laying there glory my what could not have been anything else that predestinated seed and when that water began to fall on that seed it started blooming you didn't have to tell her she knew she said sir i perceive that you're a prophet we know the messiah is coming we're looking for him when he comes he will tell us these kinds of things he said i'm he she said that's good enough for me no presuming she didn't come in and say say you doctors of divinity i would like to take you all in a scriptural argument she said i'm presuming nothing come see a man that's told me the things i've done isn't this the very christ i want to stop there because i want you to catch one thing the predestinated seed of god in you will always come to life under the preaching of the word for your day now it may not start immediately as i said in the last service i said under the preaching of the word for this hour for 17 years before it started to truly blossom but i fought it for six years before i gave my life to the christ but for those first 11 years there was nothing there but as soon as it's your time then it starts to blossom and it never dies after that it cannot die once it starts because it's the life of god inside of you it is a turtle that cannot die amen and i want you to catch there that for every seed there is a time and it has nothing to do with how you look has nothing to do with how you act where you're at in life whether you know god whether you don't know god look at the samaritan woman she's essentially a prostitute that's what the prophet calls her she's married and divorced five times she's living common law okay this is a woman that has a poor reputation she's unclean she's not allowed to mingle with the rest of them we would say she was an unspiritual woman wouldn't we there was nothing looking at her at her life that would say that's the seed of god amen but yet she said we know that when messiah comes he'll do these things there was an expectation there was an understanding inside of her that was still looking for the messiah even in her fallen condition and so when it comes in front of her she's got the expectation to recognize it right she wasn't saying they're bemoaning her current condition bemoaning her fate that she had to go get water in the middle of the day when it was hot and now i got this guy talking to me and he's a little bit weird and it's weird to have a guy sitting there while i'm trying to do my work why can't he just leave me alone and now he's digging into my personal life is he trying to pick me up i don't know right but as she's jumping as she's there and she starts to converse with him and he starts to talk to her something in her clicks right and something in her says hey that sounds like something i've read before when abraham talked to elohim this very thing happened like this man's talking to me amen and what did she say that's the nature of god right there that's the nature of elohim the lord what a thing it would be if we had expectation that out of every situation out of every trial out of every door out of every window out of every bush we'd drive by then god would come out of there and step into the scene amen that there be an expectation of the promise of god coming into our situation amen that even as we're doing something as mundane as going about our daily work that god would jump out of that and into our lives and touch us in a way that we needed to touch amen what is it she's sitting there and she's understanding this is different this ain't just a man talking to me he says now she didn't have to presume to venture out without authority she had authority he says she had scriptural authority to believe it oh woman you don't know you don't belong to our school you don't belong to any of these organizations she said i don't care what you say i know what thus saith the lord is they said he will be a prophet and there he is amen she had scriptural authority she didn't presume what school did this come from it came from the bible that's right like peter on the day of pentecost she's had an experience and she's saying inside she said hey i believe we're in the time of the messiah i believe that the time is right but i look around we're under the foot of the romans we need deliverance we need this we need that and we've been without a prophet so long the timing is right and all of a sudden this man's talking to her but she's not looking at the man but she's now listening to his words when it started she was looking at him but the more he speaks she's thinking this is just like abraham at the time of his possession right this is the kind of situation he was in he was talking to a man as well and that man told him things that he wasn't supposed to know amen she wasn't looking at the vessel because the vessel always fools the people the vessel always fools the people and whether it's whether it's john the baptist with his clothes and his looks in his manner that was wrong whether it was jesus with his unassuming attitude and his quiet voice and he wasn't good looking or charismatic or any of these things or whether it's brother jail behind this pulpit or me the vessel is always going to fool you it's always going to fool you if you're looking at the vessel amen but what she was looking for in experience and when her experience matched the word experience then she said this is it and that's all she was looking for was the experience she didn't care how it came just that it came amen no matter how it looked no matter the packaging no matter the lack of visual appear she said this is it because it matches the word brother brown says that's where she had authority to believe amen so the key for any believer man or woman is to be able to say where they're at and the place in time we're at matches the word we ought to know we're at the end time listen we could go tomorrow morning i want to say that again we could go tomorrow morning are we looking for it amen because that's the time we're at brother branham said i see nothing else except the going away of the church that's it and that's 65 it's done he's gone how much closer are we today it could be tomorrow amen if you notice like i said we see satan we see the ability for satanic influence to just come in and just roll over things now it doesn't take 10 or 15 or 20 years to introduce an agenda now takes two right it's just going off the rails amen so what does that tell you about the bride of christ if satan is accelerating his work then what is god doing god's got to accelerate his work to stand up against it amen amen but god's got to allow it satan can't move unless god allows him he's bound he's bound unless god allows it so as he's accelerating it's because god's pushing down on the faith accelerate god's pressing down on the word accelerator and he's bringing the people up to speed to match that standard amen so my question to you is if you recognize it's the end time then what do you what i want you to be an expectation for exactly what you to be looking for we ought to be looking for a couple different things the last seed the last seed amen and i'll take us back to acts 2 38 and it's for you and what as many as the lord your god shall call that's what we're looking for it's the last ones to come in and i've heard it time and time again in many other churches where they just have people come coming out of nothing one day they're a ranked center and maybe they know about the message maybe they don't and then the next day it's just boom something got them up and moved them into the church and they're back and they're serving god faithfully what is it it's that quickening power that quickening spirits coming in and saying you got to get in and god will not allow you to stay out of it amen remember that's that quote we read a couple of services ago where brother brahm said talked about the enemy coming in like a flood he says but now when we need it the spirit of god raises a standard what is it he is pouring in the spirit i want you to catch this thought now because it'll help you when things get tough when things get difficult and you're saying i can't do this anymore right and you're struggling to keep your head of above water what are you to be asking god to do not take the situation away pour in more of your spirit pour in more of your spirit lord fill me again fill me up shake it down let it overflow when i use it up fill it up again and fill it up again and fill it up again and fill it up again amen brother brown puts it this way he says he was deity himself made flesh here on earth to manifest his love to the people and to take away sin on the earth he came here in order that he could anchor death in his own body he could anchor sickness in his own body the curse that ought to have been on you he took it upon himself and had to die as a man in order to redeem you back to this full fellowship with the father again what a marvelous thing he says our hearts can't conceive what a thing that was what he did but we're too slow our minds are sluggish the valves have been stopped up they've been paralyzed by unbelief and fear and doubt and it can't flow free like it should do unless we let the holy spirit so dominate our lives till it pushes those vows till life begins to start to operate see then we can see then he says when what the holy spirit has cleaned it out and it's now operating then we can see sure it's the father then unconsciously your faith is there he's saying you've got faith you don't even know about and we'll get into why that is in the next service lord willing amen there's a lot more to that quote but i want to start with one thing and that's that if you could you can only have the fullness of faith if we call it that if you're letting the holy spirit have free reign in your life amen the prophet of god says that the holy spirit dominates your life dominates the question is what dominates our life then today how do you know what dominates your life what dominates your time very simple what dominates your time we've got certain responsibilities and guess what as men and certainly some of the women we don't get to shirk going to work that day so that's not what dominates our time that's a requirement right but what happens when we come home from work or how much are we working two are we working more than we need to because that can dominate our life or what happens we get so stretched out from work then what do we do brothers we come home we engage in our hobbies instead of doing the work that god told us to do as a father and as a husband amen that can dominate us it can be our passions it can be anything i mean you look at the world we covered it last time whether it's social media whether it's politics whether it's feminism whether it's social justice movements whether it's books whether it's movies whether it's music all of these things can come in and dominate your life it'll take you to a place that has nothing to do with the kingdom of god amen and what is it what dominates the scene and what you do when you don't have to do something else amen look at your free time and i'll tell you what's not what's i'd say denominating i guess it is kind of denominating but what dominates you it's a question you know you can have the holy ghost and you can still be dominated by something else for periods of time you can get a spirit on you absolutely been there done that amen why you let something in and you let it take over your life and all of a sudden you're sitting there and you're saying how come i'm overwhelmed by overwhelm meaning this is a consuming influence in my life and it can be as simple as this that can be a consuming influence whatever you do on it whatever you do on it doesn't matter right it can be what hobbies i love cars i love things with motors i could easily get caught up in that and then i know i know the brothers down south hunting's a big thing they can get caught up in hunting every week in their way setting up the tree stand and baiting and this and that and the other thing and then sisters you know what you do i maybe don't put your own little thing in there and say is it dominating me or is the holy spirit dominating how you know it's a dominating spirit is it will don it will overwhelm your life with things that have nothing to do with the kingdom of god and it will not cause you to grow at all in the word of god amen put your own thing there i don't know what it is amen but what happens when that comes in is you end up trying to live in two kingdoms at one time the scripture says you can't serve two masters at the same time so what is it is you end up trying to serve the colonel man or woman and the spiritual man or woman simultaneously and guess what it doesn't work and you know what happens when you start to go that way god will put up a flag he'll say whoa whoa leave that alone and then if you insist on going what happens that dove of the holy spirit just goes and sits there and says all right we'll let you go for a while let you see if you catch it and if not we're gonna have to go into what correction right amen but what's he saying he's going to see are you going to catch it are you going to see you're off are you going to keep pushing it amen you got to pick one or the other what's the what's the result of that but the brad says this jesus said except a corner wheat falls in the ground and dies it abides alone and the people don't want to die you want to be alive in the world and still you want to be religious so you accept an intellectual conception of it i wrote in my notes here worldly desire plus religious spirit equals intellectual gospel can i say that again worldly desire plus religious spirit equals an intellectual gospel and then when you do that you're still dead in sin and trespasses remember last service i read that quote that said the halfway christian is the most miserable place to be and that's what makes people act and do the way they do because the spirit that's in them dominates their life say well other people do this he says well you're not like the other people you're not supposed to be like the other people and don't pattern yourself after another believer pattern yourself after the word of god man don't look to another believer for permission to do something you go pull it through the through the sieve of the word of god and get your permission from that and don't go looking for holes go to look to fulfill what it says not to go through the holes where it doesn't say anything he says well other people do this well you're not like the other people you are dead and your life is hidden god through christ and was sealed by the holy spirit that's life friends that's what he's talking about is a life you are dead and something else is living in your place it's not just doctrine but it's the active life of jesus christ in you working to get you tuned up to the word of god men like a guitar here we sit there and they've got a they've got a little tuner on the end and they can sit there and if it gets out of tune all they do is turn that on it brings them right back into tune you ought to be tuning by the word of god not by what the world says not by what your friends say but tune yourself up by the word of god amen it's breaking down all those things brother brahm talked about he says unbelief and fear and doubt is breaking all of those things else that the life can begin to work through us amen but there's a cleaning that happens first amen i believe we've missed it in the message that there's still three works of grace paul still talked about justification and sanctification before he ever got to the baptism of the holy ghost and he's got to clean your life out him and he's got to pull these things out so that you can be of service and use amen and you don't go from zero to a hundred like that he grows you and he moves you and he pushes things out and he fills it in and does these different things amen but the instantaneous work is when you were quickened and then when life came forth when that word hit that eternal life of god inside of you that seed inside of you and it came forth that was the instantaneous part everything else after that is a function of time amen amen repentance means that you've got to turn around and go opposite to where you're going and that's the first work and god builds on that and guess what that's the same for a message believer as it is for a ranked sinner you aren't walking according to the word even if you've sat in a message church all your life until you get the holy ghost because you didn't have the mind of christ prior to that so how could you properly have the word applied in your life as good as you might think you are you don't have it until you have the holy ghost because that is the mind of christ in you and then you've got to do what you've got to run that through that sieve again as we talked about last last service amen this is a beautiful quote not this one the next one but did you ever see a man that has been stricken by an evil spirit like that he's several times his strength how i have noticed them in the meeting when groups of police couldn't even hold them they would tear them police to pieces throw them aside and get out and carry on because he is so fully surrendered to the evil one it took possession of him he had not his own understanding he only did what the evil spirit put in him to do and you'll run up against this in people where they're so stuck on something that they cannot be moved from it they have so much strength to stick with what they're convinced of and they don't realize it's an evil spirit that's on them so brother ram says these these men that come in and they are women perhaps but he says they have a demon on them and it gives them strength that is supernatural demon strength but catch what he says next he says then i thought with a complete surrender to the devil can give a man maybe five times his strength what would a complete surrender to god do to a man five times your strength with a demon without the holy spirit to do in our lives amen i can't do it i can't do it as not the word of god amen what would a complete surrender to god do to a man amen that's what i'm seeking what would it do to a that's weak in body and can't walk or something if we could just completely yield to the holy ghost give us super strength to rise in the name because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see the strength in god that's in you is greater than any affliction that can come upon you there is nothing can overtake you that can supersede you because you are full of superpower and that superpower is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you are a christian it matters what's dominating you today amen amen our goal is not to have influence when you read this does that speak of influence from me it speaks of letting go of influence our goal is to be influenced amen by one thing alone and that's the holy spirit amen when we talk about dominating i'll take it to hockey easy one to relate to if a team wins 10 to nothing they dominated another team didn't they the other team might well have not even shown up 10 to nothing that's a real beating isn't it brother bob you beat a hockey team 10 nothing that is dominating them amen the question is though in my life there's a hockey game going on and it's the holy spirit versus jonathan corlett and my question is is the score holy spirit 10 and jonathan corlett zero or is the holy or is it holy spirit five jonathan curlette five or is it god forbid jonathan collette 10 and holy spirit zero like i said look at how you spend your time that'll tell you what's been dominating your life recently amen what is it i want to be dominated so completely that i have no thought i have no say no influence no intent but to follow the holy leader holy spirit's leadership in my life amen and i do that by confirming it's in alignment with the word every time otherwise you can come under an influence that's very powerful and it feels right and it feels real and it feels good but guess what it's your carnal nature that's feeding on that it's not the holy spirit inside of you amen and for the believer it is always going to start as a religious spirit when it comes to the things we're talking about now i'm not saying there can't be other things but the one that we battle and we'll get to the quote here is religious spirits in a believer amen what is it because what it's demonic but it has the appearance of god satan appears as an angel of light amen and that's what he's trying to do is he's trying to fool the believer amen look at those 400 prophets in the time of ahab okay does the scripture say they were false prophets no says they were real prophets real men anointed and gifted to speak for god for god to speak through really is the way we should put it but what is it ahab wanted to get the go-ahead to go into battle and so he went to the prophecy he said seek the lord he said by the way i'd really like a positive answer here and so those men wanting to have influence and favor with the king opened themselves up to a line spirit because they wanted to give him a prophecy that would match his desires and so their desire to get the influence and favor of the king opened them up to a lying spirit it didn't come on micaiah because he wasn't seeking his own will and way he wasn't seeking to curry favor with the king or jehoshaphat or anybody he stayed there and he says i can only say what he says but those guys those 400 prophets right out of the school of prophet said yeah we'd like to give the king his answer the answer he wants and so that opened them up to that lying spirit and what happened they got caught up in their own desires and their own will and they became the speaker instead of the microphone that's what happened amen we're not supposed to be the speakers we're supposed to be the microphones amen i haven't noted here if you're never being corrected the holy spirit isn't working in your life and you're under a religious spirit that's hard but it's true because he always corrects his children and if we're not rapture ready then he's got to keep correcting us doesn't he amen i've been talking a lot about influence and what dominates us and the reason i'm doing that is because what dominates you determines if you have faith or not brother brown says this there's two elements for control that control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear and the other is faith now it's either faith or fear controls every nation every denomination and every individual it's either fear or faith that controls you so the question is when you act is it out of faith or is it out of fear easy answer faith reacts faith rests fear reacts faith rest fear gets worked up it gets frantic it justifies its action it tries to make it happen and what does it do it starts getting your humanity involved but faith just rests on the solid word of god and stays there and doesn't move until god tells you to move faith doesn't just sit there as we said faith is for action but it's to let you to sit still and know that he is god and find his will and then he puts you into action amen so look at the effect of what your actions in your life and are you acting to try and fix something are you acting to try and make yourself feel better guess what faith rarely takes you in the place that your carnality wants to faith rarely takes you to where your five senses say this is a good idea can i get an amen on that if you've ever walked in the will of god it rarely takes you into comfort amen right look at david in psalm 23 but he's in the caves the lord is my shepherd i shall not want while i sit in a cave fighting for my life amen faith rarely takes you where carnality would ever say it say to go amen but if you look at that and you see that you're trying to make yourself feel better rather than to work through it the way god wants you to you're never going to get the supernatural effect of god in your life because you keep ducking away from the thing he's trying to do be a supernatural god in a situation that requires a supernatural god amen so what do we say god i'm giving this to you i'm letting you have control and i'm going to rest on what you say and i'm going to keep moving forward and i'm going to keep doing what i always do and i'm just going to let you work the situation out and all of a sudden it's worked out like i said the testimony i gave of that that young man or that man that lost his wife you know when she wanted to go down to voice of god recordings and all these different things and threaten to leave him and he lost his job and this that and the other thing and he's sitting there now he could have went and he could have tried to do a lot of things maybe he could have divorced her said you know what she's out from under my head ship i'm going to divorce her. but what did he do he stayed there and he prayed and he held on to the word of god and god restored his marriage god restored his job and actually forgot to mention that they're pregnant as well right so he added to their life as well all of these things because he stayed there and didn't try and react to it amen but just trusted the word of god but what is it that turns faith into fear because it's human to have fear fear is a is a survival mechanism that's right right fear is a survival mechanism but we're not looking to survive because the song says we're looking to thrive amen we're not supposed to just be surviving i made it we're supposed to be overcoming we're supposed to be putting fear into other things can i put it that way we're supposed to be the one that they fear that satan fears you know that when he says you know what i'm going to send you over to selena today you demon he says don't send me to the selena don't do it in him that's what we ought to be don't for the love of all that is evil send me to take care of selena today right i've said it before we ought to be hell for hell remember what gives what takes that fear and turns it into faith what gives us faith very familiar scripture romans 10 says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god brother bryan would say what is it a revelation what is faith it is god by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised now if you only hear faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread see hearing only brings the word that produces faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen then you see you hear the word god reveals it to you that it is the truth and by spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to god he says do you get it that's why i keep saying you've got to have the new birth you've got to have the holy spirit because for the believer for perfect faith for rapturing faith you've got to have the holy spirit in there to quicken the faith that lies within you amen what is it true faith only comes by understanding the word of god which is the will of god amen what is it it's impossible to even comprehend the things of god jesus said you can't even understand the kingdom of god unless you have that new birth and that's why i have to shake my head when people that aren't christians or even professing christians try and take the bible and tangle with you they have no understanding of it they have no concept of what it means they'll pick one scripture out that they've looked up on google from somebody that's an atheist and say this is proof and you're like that's nothing to do with what we're talking about right what is it because they're trying to understand or combat the battle the word of god with the word of god which makes no sense amen that's why i keep talking about what is it that dominates your life listen paul the apostle used to be saul the pharisee and he spent day in and day out studying the scriptures in the word of god he had committed his very life to it and until he got the holy spirit he was literally going after the true church of god he was persecuting the true believers while being buried in the word with his nose and the scrolls day in and day out to the point where he was a pharisee among pharisees he was the best of the best when it came to a religious person and yet he was persecuting them why because he didn't have the new birth you can do the same thing today you can you can be doing things and you think that you're in the will of god and you think that you're spiritual and it has nothing to do with it because you lack the holy spirit in your life amen that's why it matters what dominates you what dominates your time if hearing comes by the word how much word are you hearing that's a that's a real easy question isn't it how much time are you spending in the message how much time are you spending reading your bible because you can't have faith unless you know what to have faith in remember brother brown says you got to have something to have faith in to have faith it's got to rest on something that's got to be based on something amen so if you have another spirit working in you you can't have faith until you move that spirit out you move that spirit out and all of a sudden you've got a place now for the holy spirit to rise up inside of you and take its place but other than that we can attend church we can read our bible we can pray till we turn blue in the face but until we get the new birth then all we're doing is looking under something but we don't actually have it amen what is it what's going to happen is it's going to turn itself into a religious spirit and that's what you end up seeing is you see people that have been around the message for 20 30 years they never got the new birth and eventually they just end up wandering away they go sit by themselves they do whatever it is because they have nothing in them that unites them with the body right they've got a religious spirit they've got the word in terms of the letter but they don't have the spirit of that word inside of them amen look at this he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts he didn't say the book of facts because you know what facts lead to factions left and right right liberal conservative democrat republican whatever you want to call catholic protestant whatever it is facts lead to factions because everybody's got facts amen they didn't say it was a book of pacs either you think the way i think so let's join up no we're brought into what unity by one spirit amen one spirit is what draws us together into a book of acts church amen but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people in the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he has cast in the lake of fire satan never quits he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now like i said don't get caught up in doing the greater works yourself because we'll get into it it's not you that does it anyways the life that i live i live by the what faith of jesus christ so it's not you doing the work it's christ in you doing the work so all you're looking to do is get yourself out of the way so that he can have more access to you but this is we're talking about influences he says if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her she he will be as definitely thwarted today as christ when christ withstood every effort to gain power over him in the desert satan yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them because he says what faith is a revelation right so what is it you've got to have a revelation for your situation you've got to have a revelation for who you are and you've got to have a revelation for what comes with who you are amen it's like i said for most believers the spirit they will most often fight is a religious spirit becomes with because it comes with a skin of spirituality with the meat of carnality inside of it amen it puts a spiritual spin on a carnal desire that's a religious spirit puts a spiritual spin on a carnal desire and i can say this from my own life that when i've had to deal with those things it became it came with a desire to influence to make people look up to me to impress people to make more money to improve my appearance or to make people admire me or to make people think i was something i wasn't i'm speaking by experience brother jonathan you've had a religious spirit absolutely i have i guarantee most of us had at some point in our life where what you tried to put on a facade that didn't match your experience that's what a religious spirit does it makes you pretend and guess what satan loves pretenders satan loves pretenders they are his greatest soldiers look at the seven sons of siva they were pretenders weren't they they said what they tried to cast out a demon in the name of jesus whom paul preaches and the demons said jesus i know paul i know who you are i have no clue who you are and what it is scripture says he ran them out of the house beating them and stripping their clothes off naked and made them there for everyone to see that they were false believers satan loves pretenders because they have no power remember what he said what we read in the last service where he said peter stood there and he preached and three thousand souls came to christ and satan didn't move but the minute he cast him out of a blind man then what happened sorry i have a man at the gate beautiful as soon as he casts them out he says they got thrown into jail why because satan can't stand it when he is cast out of your life he doesn't care if you come to church what he cares is if coming to church has an effect on your life that causes him to be pulled out amen god's looking for the genuine believer that takes him at his word him and we're at the pinnacle of the gentile age right it started high alpha we're at the end omega it's the same thing but it takes us into a rapture and so we're at the pinnacle of all this after that he's going to the jews and the 144 thousand and the gentiles are out there's no hope for the gentile except by works and to give their life amen but what's the challenge today we've heard our pastor say it do you have faith to go in the rapture do you have faith for this do you believe for this do you do all these things what's our challenge challenges to believe that we do even though it doesn't always appear that we do it's like i said at the beginning if you have the holy spirit you have everything in you that's needed for this walk on earth to take you all the way to a rapture and a resurrection amen how do i know that brother brown would he doesn't say it this way i've summarized it but the word opens the door to faith right that's what we just read in in romans there is that faith cometh by excuse me hearing and hearing by the word so the word opens the door to faith so we saw faith drop as the purity of the word dropped right we saw it preached on the day of pentecost in its full purity there was no man in there there was no ideas there was no doctrines that weren't of god on the day of pentecost three thousand souls came in and they went and signs and wonders followed them but then as they moved on and then it talks about in revelation the ephesian church what did they do they left their first love and what happened is men got involved and they started adding to it and they started wanting influence and power over the people as a rather than over this the powers of satan and they got in and they started to add in things that had nothing to do with the word of god and what happened was the faith went down as the purity of the word came down because you can only rise to the level of the word that you're hearing right so the more tainted it is the more hybrid it is then the weaker it is until the point that it comes as brother brown says cold formless and powerless lukewarm and powerless amen as it went into the dark ages they got to the place where only the priests could read the word the common man couldn't do it and by then it was so wrapped up in catholicism and all the dogmas and ideas and these different things that there was no faith to be had it was dead it was dead nothing there you had just a couple select believers that was it i'd be curious to know how many come out of these ages right here can't be many because the word wasn't being preached all right you just had a select few that would show these things amen but then we come to here and we have the restoration of the faith through what malachi 4. why did he have to come back and restore the word because the restored word can give us a restored faith that'll bring us all the way to full redemption i mean that's all he was doing so that's why he had to clear up godhead that's why he had to clear up marriage and divorce and serpent seed and all these different things is because the word had to come in purity so that the faith that follows it could come in purity as well if the word is pure then the faith that follows it will also be pure and it'll take you directly into the will of god amen so all we're asked to do is have faith in it believe obey obey means to act on it not just say it in our head but to act on it and then we wait in expectation because you can't make it happen it's god that's doing the work so all you're doing is you're waiting an expectation you're walking in expectation you're talking an expectation you're speaking an expectation but it's god that's going to do the work in you and we're at the place now where there is nothing in the word contained in the word that we can't have amen we're at the end of time at the end of the gentile dispensation there's nothing written in this book that pertains to us that isn't available to us the redemptive blessings were available all through there regardless redemptive blessings have nothing to do with the word if you preached it and believed it you could have it right but now we're at the point where it's not just redemptive blessings but it is full redemption faith for full redemption which is what our bodies coming into that perfect theophany amen amen so now in the purity of the full word the fullness of faith is available to the believer and we've had the same angel visitation that abraham had just before he got his promise right abraham had a body change sarah had a body change they weren't having intimate relations she was way past the time of a woman and his seat had dried up inside him there was nothing there but yet in a few short months they had a full body change that's an amazing thing to hear listen to this as we start to close he says but watch what kind of a miracle this angel did that stayed with abraham he had his back turned and told abraham his name had been changed abram yeah called him abraham instead of abram he could not have the baby till his name was changed and neither sarah he told them what their name was the angel told them that and he said he was going to visit sarah according to the time of life and sarah laughed about it and when sarah laughed the man with his back turned the man eating the flesh of the calf and drinking the milk from the cow and eating bread a man with dust on his clothes a traveler was god himself and abraham recognized it because he knew the thought that was in sarah's heart behind him he said why did sarah say within herself how can these things be is anything too hard for god see and sarah run out and denied it he said yes you did now here took sarah's life right there for her to disbelieve but see she is a part of abraham amen now catch this last sentence and our unbelief in his great manifestation in this hour he says we're a part of christ he just he has to keep it amen why because we don't always believe do we church i i identify i think more often with the man with the man that came with his son that had had to have the demon cast out of him of epilepsy and jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible he said lord i believe help thou my unbelief we'll get into why he said that in a couple services but i think that's where a lot of us are these days is that we have ups and downs when it comes to our faith we have a ton of faith when the holy spirit's moving in the service but when we're standing alone and facing it at home it's a lot more difficult isn't it amen amen but what does he say that what our unbelief that god looks past is our disbelief that the great manifestation of this hour is here today now we had a great manifestation through malachi 4 didn't we but that wasn't enough because the great manifestation wasn't abraham it wasn't eliezer but it was the life that came out of sarah that was the great manifestation was out of death came life and so it's no different for us as he's sitting there and he's saying bride sometimes you don't believe what i'm telling you about yourself but he says i look past that because you're a part of me and god's word has to come true so i'm going to keep looking past it until you come to the place where we can be one together that's what he's doing is he looks past he looks past it and we can say lord i don't disbelieve and he'd say no no no you do but it's okay because i'm gonna bring you to the place it has nothing to do with you in the first place i'm just proving my word in your life and i'm going to bring you to the place where you have exactly what i'm talking about and despite her condition despite her unbelief there sarah still had a body change but i guarantee you i don't know i'd be curious to know what happened you know did it happen over three months and she just started getting less wrinkly you know and things started to appear that it long disappeared or did she just wake up one morning and she was a beautiful young woman again but i imagine they had a a hallelujah revival in the tent abraham especially when the wife of his youth had been restored to him and then sarah said you're not so bad looking yourself there sport amen i believe they woke up one morning and they just realized wow he's done it the body's been changed all that's going to come forth now is life amen that's why our faith rests in the fact that he changed our life that's why you've got to have the new birth because that's the life-changing experience amen and then you know that he changed you then you know that he's going to take you all the way through because he started the work and he'll be faithful to complete it amen let's stand together if we would and then praise the lord my voice didn't go cracked a couple times but i meant i'm glad for that amen what is the great manifestation of this hour it's not brother branham that was one man but now he's got a manifestation and a complete bride of christ amen that's walking this earth and all he's waiting for is her to step up into that realm of faith amen it's not me that's holding me it's not you that's holding you amen it's god's great grace and his word that promised a certain end to us that's holding us amen each and every day amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord thank you for your goodness and grace lord we thank you when you look past our unbelief lord we thank you for
