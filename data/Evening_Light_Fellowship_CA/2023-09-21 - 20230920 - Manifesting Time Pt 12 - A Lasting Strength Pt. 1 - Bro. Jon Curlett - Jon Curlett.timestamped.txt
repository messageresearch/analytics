[11:48] amen
[11:50] amen praise the Lord Let's uh
[11:53] thing number 657 and that is the uh the
[11:57] chorus we're more than conquerors I mean
[12:01] let's sing that uh tonight and praying
[12:04] for Brother John as he brings the word
[12:06] of the Lord and also uh we just
[12:10] want to remember those not with us as
[12:12] the grants of course and uh brother Chad
[12:15] just want to remember them brother Josh
[12:17] sister Rochelle I don't see him yet so I
[12:20] just want to remember them in prayer
[12:22] also
[12:23] and we also had a couple of requests uh
[12:28] given to me by Brother David for a
[12:30] friend of his Patrick chafe who uh just
[12:34] found out that he has uh he's full of
[12:36] cancer so we want to remember him and uh
[12:39] he's he's he'd be around 70 years of age
[12:42] so we want to remember him for the
[12:43] Salvation of his soul and for a touch of
[12:45] healing in his body and God is more than
[12:48] able and also a little boy that's four
[12:50] years old Brother David did not remember
[12:52] his name did not know his names but uh
[12:55] uh he's the son of a tenant in the
[12:58] building and he has a problem with uh
[13:00] some some kind of a blood condition so
[13:03] um
[13:04] we just want to remember that child
[13:06] today we may not know his name but God
[13:08] does so let's just remember that today
[13:10] also
[13:12] we have in the past been praying for
[13:15] brother Joel C sister Amber's brother
[13:18] who was having a really rough time with
[13:21] uh
[13:22] the red bowel disease and and the
[13:25] surgeries and the cancer and all that so
[13:27] but he's been given a clean bill of
[13:30] health and that's the God we serve isn't
[13:34] it
[13:35] so when we bring a prayer request up
[13:39] here you can this is not just routine
[13:41] this is uh not just because it's a
[13:45] service and we do it it's because we
[13:47] believe that God answers prayer and
[13:49] we're bringing the serious need before
[13:52] him today
[13:53] so for him each and every time so let's
[13:56] just remember that also
[13:58] we did pray for Rena Walsh and she I
[14:03] just got a report from her yesterday and
[14:06] she is doing really well so we're
[14:09] thankful for that also she had surgery
[14:12] for thyroid and a goiter that was
[14:15] wrapped around it so uh just believe God
[14:19] just believe God and so let's do that
[14:22] tonight that's probably Daniel just to
[14:24] take us to the throne of grace in prayer
[14:26] and we just pray one for another tonight
[14:29] may God just touch us in a special way
[14:31] as he had for those people may touch

[14:37] our needs tonight let's just sing it

[39:35] out of
[39:36] Lord we see how far you've taken us
[39:39] Lord we've seen the the separation that
[39:41] you've put in our lives from these
[39:43] things Lord
[39:44] and we can see your love for us
[39:47] but Lord I'm trusting Lord that our
[39:49] lives say that we love you more and more
[39:51] Lord that we love you more today than we
[39:53] ever have Lord Lord that our lives are a
[39:56] reflection Lord of our appreciation Lord
[39:58] our thankfulness Lord for all that
[40:00] you've done for us Heavenly Father
[40:02] Lord may it not just be something we say
[40:05] the Lord above all may be something we
[40:07] do may it be something we live may it be
[40:09] something we show every day or by our
[40:12] words by our thoughts and by our actions
[40:14] Lord God
[40:15] Lord I'm worthy for it but we're so
[40:17] thankful for it Lord God lord and we're
[40:19] praying that we just be vessels Lord
[40:21] that that love didn't just come to Lord
[40:23] but that love can come through Lord that
[40:25] others could see you could receive you
[40:27] Lord that we would give them their
[40:29] salvation Lord by bringing them to the
[40:31] word to the gospel that you've given us
[40:32] Heavenly Father
[40:34] Lord make us fit for service we pray
[40:36] Lord bless us now this night as we hear
[40:38] your word in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[40:40] him amen
[40:42] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[40:44] Second Peter chapter one
[40:47] amen
[40:48] just for every service probably for the
[40:50] next month or so just start in second
[40:52] Peter 1 and we'll probably be there in
[40:54] one one form or the other amen it's good
[40:57] to be in service it was a beautiful day
[40:58] it's nice to get this so late in the
[41:00] season but thankful for the sunshine and
[41:02] the warmth amen I got a chance to go and
[41:05] dedicate brother Chad's new office his
[41:06] new building for his business this week
[41:08] so that was a real honor real pleasure
[41:10] to see God just providing for him that
[41:12] way also we confirm with Brother David
[41:14] Nash the missionary that we've been
[41:17] supporting he'll be here from November
[41:18] 3rd through 5th of this year it'll take
[41:21] three services and I never tell them
[41:23] what to preach but I'll probably ask him
[41:24] to at least take a portion of a service
[41:26] or a service to tell us what he's been
[41:27] doing and kind of share with the church
[41:29] some of the the testimonies and the
[41:31] things that God's been doing through him
[41:33] and and through his ministry there but
[41:35] certainly keep those things Imperial
[41:36] just be him coming up but uh but I'm
[41:39] looking forward to seeing that amen it's
[41:40] a part of the fivefold ministry it's why
[41:42] we support it it's why we appreciate it
[41:44] and men and we just want to to trust
[41:46] that God will use him to be a blessing
[41:47] to us you know it's uh we can't all be
[41:49] missionaries in the way that they are
[41:51] but we can definitely support one and we
[41:53] don't want to ever lose a heart for
[41:54] Souls amen we want to do it locally but
[41:57] we also want to do it around the world
[41:58] and brother Dave has been very faithful
[42:00] to do this he he's just given his life
[42:02] to doing it and we're thankful for that
[42:05] amen second Peter chapter 1 and verse 5
[42:07] says this and besides this giving all
[42:10] diligence add to your faith virtue amen
[42:13] God bless you you can have your seats
[42:15] this evening and as you might imagine
[42:16] we're going to be speaking on virtue
[42:18] tonight and I want to take a title for
[42:19] this service and maybe for the next one
[42:21] Lord willing on a lasting strength amend
[42:23] a lasting strength and we're pressing
[42:25] forward and these attributes of the
[42:27] characteristics of a child of God and we
[42:29] talked about faith for a couple services
[42:30] and then we're going to preach on virtue
[42:33] and we're going to preach on it from two
[42:34] angles because if you've ever listened
[42:36] to the Statue of a perfect man as soon
[42:38] as I start preaching you're going to say
[42:39] that's not the way brother Brandon
[42:40] preached it but brother Branham jumped
[42:42] to the Apex of virtue really and he gets
[42:44] to an attribute of virtue and that's the
[42:45] strength portion but before there comes
[42:47] strength there has to come a foundation
[42:49] from that there has to come a source for
[42:50] those things there has to come A Life
[42:52] That's behind that strength if I could
[42:54] put it that way so I'm going to take the
[42:55] the basic portion which is which is what
[42:58] Peter's talking about here and then we
[42:59] get to the higher portion which is what
[43:01] Paul ends up talking about in a later
[43:03] way as well so we start with this idea
[43:05] virtue if we take it back to the
[43:07] original Greek word it's a word called
[43:09] irate irate it sounds French almost and
[43:11] it means a moral goodness or Excellence
[43:14] of good moral character or uprightness
[43:17] so this virtue starts as a Christian
[43:20] Life a Christian Life by appearance if I
[43:22] could put it that way and they say here
[43:23] that an example of this word Virtue
[43:26] would be modesty modesty or purity
[43:29] so this is something that is certainly
[43:31] something that's going to be shown
[43:32] throughout their life and we hear a lot
[43:34] about virtue and scripture and as I said
[43:36] brother Branham jumps right to that
[43:37] other word but that's a different word
[43:39] for virtue but this word Virtue is only
[43:41] mentioned four times in the scripture
[43:43] and three of them are in Peter's
[43:44] writings one of them's in Paul's
[43:46] writings and I want to focus on the way
[43:47] that Peter brings it before we get to
[43:49] how Paul brings it which is really how
[43:50] brother Branham would talk about it in
[43:52] many other ways so if we go to First
[43:55] Peter SEC 2 9 it says this and this is
[43:58] the first word that mentions this word
[43:59] Virtue or virtues and it says but ye are
[44:01] a chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[44:05] holy nation of peculiar people now you
[44:09] notice that this is very much about
[44:10] appearance and it's about what you do
[44:12] and how you spend your time
[44:14] when we look at priesthoods when we look
[44:16] at a holy nation we look at a peculiar
[44:18] people it's something that is obvious
[44:19] from the outside what you are if I could
[44:21] put it that way
[44:22] okay and he says that ye should show
[44:24] forth the Praises of him who have called
[44:27] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[44:29] Light now that word Praises is an
[44:31] English word but the the Greek word the
[44:33] original word is virtue that you might
[44:35] show forth The Virtue or the virtues of
[44:38] him who has called you out of Darkness
[44:40] into his moderate unto His Marvelous
[44:41] Light so in other words what Peter's
[44:43] saying here is there's a difference in
[44:44] how you act now and how you used to act
[44:48] because when you were in darkness you
[44:49] acted one way but now you're a different
[44:51] way and the way you live now is
[44:52] reflective of a priesthood a royal a
[44:56] holy nation and A peculiar people it's
[44:58] three three things that are combined
[45:00] that show you the virtue that that Peter
[45:03] is talking about here amen so this is
[45:05] we're all born in darkness
[45:08] and whether we're born into this message
[45:10] whether you're born in a Christian home
[45:11] we're born in darkness and that darkness
[45:13] is of the Soul
[45:14] it's a darkness of the Soul you you can
[45:16] be surrounded by the light of this
[45:18] message you can be surrounded by the
[45:19] Light of the presence of God you have
[45:21] holy ghost-filled parents you're in a
[45:22] church with holy ghost-filled people but
[45:24] that's not what we're talking about but
[45:26] we can have the truth presented to us
[45:27] but until the word until that word comes
[45:30] to us and brother Brown says until that
[45:31] word flashes across our soul and we
[45:34] recognize it for what it is and what we
[45:36] res and we receive it for what it is
[45:37] then we're in darkness our soul is in
[45:39] darkness it hasn't been quickened it
[45:41] hasn't been brought to light it hasn't
[45:42] started to produce the the sea Gene of
[45:45] God that's inside of us so knowing what
[45:47] is right is not just the light but
[45:49] living it that's when you know you've
[45:51] really caught the light because you can
[45:53] you can hear it all day long and Nod
[45:54] your head but until it steps into your
[45:56] light it's not truly light to you
[45:58] brother bam says if you believe it
[45:59] you'll do it it's very simple if we go
[46:02] into that amen but the calling of God in
[46:04] our life and our positioning as the
[46:06] people of God the chosen the elect bride
[46:08] of God this called us out these called
[46:10] out ones is putting us in a position to
[46:12] show The Virtue or the virtue issues of
[46:15] God that's what Peter's talking about
[46:17] here and he says it they we call it
[46:19] Praises but he says that praise is
[46:21] really a virtue so let me put it this
[46:23] way the way you live your life is a
[46:26] praise to God the way you live your life
[46:28] is a worship to God the way you live
[46:30] your life is a reflection of the god
[46:32] that you serve that makes it real easy
[46:34] doesn't it because whatever's coming out
[46:36] is going to worship some God whatever is
[46:38] you you do with your life is going to
[46:40] show what influence you're under what
[46:42] you really believe and so the the fruit
[46:44] of your life the way that you live is
[46:45] the virtues of the god that you're
[46:47] serving if I could put it that way Peter
[46:49] would say this just a few verses earlier
[46:51] in verse 5 he says ye also as Lively
[46:54] Stones as living stones are built up a
[46:57] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[46:59] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[47:01] to God by Jesus Christ so in second
[47:03] Peter 1 he talks about how to be built
[47:05] up in second Peter in First Peter 2 he's
[47:08] saying you are a spiritual house this is
[47:10] what it looks like to be this sort of
[47:11] thing and so he's saying that the people
[47:13] of God are an upright people
[47:15] these are people that that the word
[47:17] flows through that live by the word and
[47:20] it sets them apart and it makes them a
[47:22] different people our choices our
[47:24] decisions our view of right and wrong
[47:25] the things that we would say are are
[47:27] moral absolutes for us are different
[47:29] than this entire world because we're
[47:31] built on an unwavering absolute that
[47:33] does not change based on society that
[47:35] does not change based on laws that does
[47:37] not change based on governments that
[47:39] does not change based on Ministry
[47:42] amen the word holds absolute through all
[47:44] of these things and the world hates an
[47:46] absolute I've said this many times
[47:47] before do you know there are people
[47:48] today that are saying that two plus two
[47:50] does not equal four
[47:51] and they're getting time on the national
[47:53] news and saying it
[47:55] as a valid thought
[47:57] they'll even go so far as to say two
[47:59] plus two equals four is racist
[48:01] that that's the the absurdity that we're
[48:03] facing today now people are smiling
[48:06] about that that tells you how far we've
[48:07] sunk from an absolute
[48:09] when we've made everything a negotiation
[48:13] then nothing's going to work
[48:15] there is no negotiation with God there
[48:17] is no negotiation with God Amen we have
[48:20] absolute positions in our life by the
[48:22] word we have an absolute position on
[48:24] marriage don't we till death do us part
[48:26] right wrong made a good decision made a
[48:29] bad decision until death do us part
[48:31] that that's what we believe
[48:33] amen
[48:34] we have an absolute position on gender
[48:37] it's absolute there is no changing in it
[48:40] I was listening to brother Brown the
[48:41] other day and he says when a man wants
[48:42] to be and a woman wants to be
[48:44] masculine there's a problem
[48:45] it's that simple God divided the literal
[48:49] Spirit of Adam into two portions one for
[48:51] the woman and one for the man physically
[48:53] and they're meant to stay apart because
[48:55] they have a purpose they have a
[48:57] god-chosen purpose and we'll get into
[48:58] this a little bit later as we go amen
[49:00] but we have absolute positions on what's
[49:02] most important in life
[49:04] we live our lives by an absolute and
[49:06] that's that the word takes preeminence
[49:08] in everything and it is the filter for
[49:10] every decision and everything that we do
[49:11] in our life or it ought to be amen if
[49:13] we're a True Believer but watch how
[49:15] Peter lays it out he lists these three
[49:17] things he says a royal priesthood a holy
[49:19] nation and A peculiar people and that
[49:21] word that phrase of royal priesthood
[49:23] means we live a Sanctified life
[49:25] we lead a focused life and we leave us
[49:28] live a set aside life that is in a
[49:31] prescribed manner when you look at the
[49:32] priesthood their days were defined
[49:35] their actions were defined you go read
[49:37] in the Book of Leviticus it is it tells
[49:39] you everything that a priest is supposed
[49:40] to do
[49:41] tells them how to dress tells them how
[49:44] to talk tells them how to play tells
[49:46] them how to sacrifice tells them how to
[49:48] approach God tells them who can approach
[49:50] God when they can approach God what it
[49:52] takes to make things right what it takes
[49:54] to make things clean what it takes to
[49:55] make things holy
[49:57] all of these things a priest is
[49:59] completely prescribed in what he was
[50:01] doing a priest didn't have to wonder
[50:03] about what he was going to do each day
[50:04] or how to handle a situation God laid it
[50:07] out very clearly for them amen
[50:09] and now Peter comes along and he says
[50:11] you're part of a royal priesthood
[50:14] that means you're serving a king
[50:16] not just to God but you're serving a
[50:18] king now and with that priesthood comes
[50:21] what expectations of conduct and
[50:23] behavior
[50:24] it's that simple brother Branham said
[50:25] that the Holy Ghost should not make you
[50:27] do one thing and me do another
[50:29] when it comes to things relating to the
[50:31] word amen we ought to all be living
[50:33] working off the same Playbook amen so
[50:35] with it comes expectations for conduct
[50:37] and behavior and with that also comes an
[50:40] understanding and a knowledge of how to
[50:43] approach God
[50:45] amen it says that you offer we'll get
[50:48] into this ability that we offer what
[50:50] spiritual sacrifices the bride is the
[50:52] only group that knows how to approach
[50:54] God in a way that pleases him much like
[50:56] Esther did
[50:58] we have instant access because the
[51:00] priesthood had access to God in a way
[51:02] that everybody else didn't amen
[51:04] remember brother Brandon would say if
[51:06] God ever did something for someone
[51:08] you can do the same thing get the same
[51:10] thing from God by doing the same thing
[51:12] he says God never changes
[51:14] God never changed we have this idea of
[51:16] an absolute and listen God does not sit
[51:19] back and take our thoughts into
[51:20] consideration
[51:21] God has thought it through
[51:23] God has already decided what's right and
[51:25] wrong what's good and bad what is
[51:26] acceptable and what is not and he trains
[51:28] us he teaches us what is acceptable to
[51:30] him and he expects us to live by those
[51:33] things amen
[51:34] but only the bride can offer a spiritual
[51:36] sacrifice in that day in this day
[51:38] because she is the one that has been
[51:39] appointed to serve him to be with him to
[51:42] be the one that approaches his throne of
[51:44] grace amen why because we've heard a
[51:45] word we've heard a message and we've
[51:48] responded not just with our heads not
[51:50] just with our mouths but we've responded
[51:51] with our lives to align it with what he
[51:53] says is right and what is wrong amen we
[51:55] don't just give him verbal amends amen
[51:57] means so be it
[51:59] that means it has to come into a natural
[52:00] fruition that means it has to step into
[52:02] our lives and when we do that then God
[52:04] knows that our main our amen is truly
[52:06] something that that we believe amen now
[52:09] Peter comes along and what he's saying
[52:10] is you're a royal priesthood so act like
[52:12] it
[52:13] we ought to have an expectation for how
[52:15] we live we ought to be a sanctified
[52:16] people we ought to be a set-aside people
[52:18] amen we ought not to be wishy-washy
[52:21] about how we live that's for sure
[52:23] the world is looking for people that
[52:24] will compromise
[52:26] listen if you want a a person that
[52:29] displays this attribute of virtue the
[52:30] best in the scripture the best I can
[52:32] think of is Daniel
[52:34] because Daniel gets taken into captivity
[52:36] in Babylon and everyone except three of
[52:39] his friends goes to the dark side
[52:42] they start eating the wrong food they
[52:44] start hanging around the wrong people
[52:45] they start worshiping the wrong God they
[52:48] start bowing down to political pressure
[52:50] which leads to them bowing down to an
[52:51] idol
[52:53] all of these things are putting pressure
[52:55] on them and Daniel in all of this does
[52:58] not bow one bit he does not back off he
[53:01] does not take their knowledge or their
[53:03] wisdom but he stays true to the calling
[53:05] and the word of God that he has learned
[53:07] as a young man and he applies it there
[53:09] and in that he is set aside and in that
[53:11] he is blessed and elevated above all
[53:13] because he refuses to compromise
[53:16] he refused to do it nothing would change
[53:18] me man you'll notice when it comes to
[53:20] the priesthood they never went to the
[53:22] people to get approval for how they were
[53:24] approaching God
[53:25] ever
[53:27] ever you do not seek approval for how
[53:30] you approach God if it is by the word
[53:31] then that's what you care about doesn't
[53:33] matter what this world says this world
[53:35] will say sisters you don't have to you
[53:37] can cut your hair you can wear any sort
[53:39] of closes there's no difference between
[53:40] a man and a woman all these different
[53:42] things
[53:43] no no no no you have a way to approach
[53:45] God
[53:46] you've got a way to dress to approach
[53:48] God Amen
[53:50] stick with the word of God Scripture
[53:52] says let your yea be ye and your
[53:54] neighbor yea man don't don't flip-flop
[53:57] based on who you're talking to don't
[53:59] flip-flop based on what the laws come in
[54:01] with listen they're going to bring in
[54:02] laws that are going to make it just
[54:03] about impossible to be a Christian if
[54:04] you want to abide by the law
[54:06] they're gonna do it The Squeeze is
[54:08] coming politically absolutely remember I
[54:11] believe we'll get taken out before that
[54:12] all happens amen but anyways the priest
[54:15] was never trying to get approval from
[54:16] the people because he had to do it the
[54:18] way God said Remember When Aaron's two
[54:20] sons came in and they brought Strange
[54:22] Fire they brought in a way of worship
[54:24] that God had not authorized and God
[54:26] killed them both like that and he said
[54:28] this was so egregious this was so bad
[54:31] you're not even allowed to mourn them
[54:33] you're not even allowed to mourn them
[54:36] destroy them they've been destroyed put
[54:38] them out forget about it and move on and
[54:40] learn a lesson do it God's provided way
[54:43] he's always got a way to to approach him
[54:45] do it his way that's the way that he'll
[54:47] accept amen but that priest worship was
[54:49] to God for the people
[54:52] you start changing it to the way that
[54:53] people want you to do it you have no
[54:55] access to God
[54:56] our worship is for their sake many times
[54:58] to keep us in the presence of God we're
[55:01] literally the blood of Christ to this
[55:02] age
[55:03] as long as the bride's here there's
[55:05] mercy here but as soon as we leave then
[55:07] The Mercy Seat turns into a judgment
[55:09] seat so as long as we are here we are
[55:10] the blood of Christ applied to this
[55:12] world
[55:13] and so we've got to stay right with God
[55:15] so that we can apply the mercy to them
[55:17] so they can step in by grace through our
[55:19] witness through our testimony through
[55:21] our stand and have access to a god that
[55:23] will change him into the same thing that
[55:24] we are
[55:25] program will put it this way he says do
[55:28] you ever realize that God's way is a few
[55:31] goes that way
[55:32] he says and they're despised and
[55:34] rejected because they're not of the
[55:36] world they are of God A peculiar people
[55:39] a royal priesthood offering spiritual
[55:42] sacrifices that is the fruits of the
[55:44] lips giving praise unto God anybody had
[55:47] a person look down on them based on what
[55:49] they believe
[55:50] ever been called old-fashioned
[55:53] oh you know what the best one is
[55:54] narrow-minded
[55:57] you won't you won't consider it
[56:01] you know what happens when you consider
[56:03] compromise
[56:05] every time
[56:09] all they want you to do
[56:10] is have a conversation we're going to
[56:12] talk about conversations a little bit
[56:14] later
[56:15] all they want to do is have a
[56:16] conversation
[56:17] will say we won't Bend we won't bow
[56:21] and you can burn us
[56:23] we don't know what God's going to do
[56:26] you can do what you got to do but I've
[56:28] already done what I've got to do and I'm
[56:29] sticking with what I've got amen amen
[56:32] even if you haven't done it yet there's
[56:34] going to come a day where you speak up
[56:35] and you are going to completely
[56:36] flabbergast somebody that you believe
[56:39] the things that we believe
[56:40] absolutely
[56:42] I had a I had a man in Edmonton and I
[56:45] got to witness to him for for seven
[56:47] hours that day and we had a tremendous
[56:49] time but he said John how can you be an
[56:52] educated engineer and believe in God I
[56:54] said let me tell you
[56:55] and I told him about the supernatural
[56:58] because the supernatural supersedes
[57:00] science
[57:02] we're having a conversation today does
[57:04] science prove truth I said no it doesn't
[57:07] because God can do things that are
[57:08] beyond what science understands what
[57:11] they believe
[57:12] listen you look in the scriptures Philip
[57:14] was transported 200 miles
[57:16] like that
[57:18] yeah
[57:20] Enoch was translated without seeing
[57:22] death
[57:23] they threw a dead man on Elijah's bones
[57:25] and he came to life you tell me how that
[57:27] could be approved by science
[57:30] the word transcends all science Our
[57:33] Truth is not on the knowledge of man
[57:34] because it's constantly changing it's
[57:36] constantly upgrading it's constantly
[57:38] learning God already knows it
[57:40] and he controls it all
[57:42] and so we're not going to go by what
[57:44] somebody thinks today is the right thing
[57:46] because they thought that was the wrong
[57:47] thing yesterday or last year
[57:49] or the last decade or the last century
[57:51] whatever it might be they're constantly
[57:53] changing but God doesn't do that God is
[57:55] a closed-minded God if I could put it
[57:56] that way
[57:57] brother Bram says he he knows everything
[58:00] and it's right the first time therefore
[58:03] that's why he's unchanging
[58:05] and if as a Believer we've caught the
[58:07] true revelation of the word then we are
[58:08] close-minded as well we are close-minded
[58:11] to everything remember brother Bram said
[58:12] a wife is closed to the seed of any man
[58:15] but her husband and that's what it is
[58:17] because remember the mind is the is the
[58:19] what it's the womb to the soul
[58:21] amen that's why you block it here so it
[58:24] can't get down inside of here God
[58:26] doesn't consider Society God doesn't
[58:28] consider social norms these days or
[58:30] anything like that he's already declared
[58:31] what is right and he expects us to stick
[58:33] with it amen
[58:34] now people aren't going to like what we
[58:36] have to say and today if you say
[58:37] something is wrong then they say you
[58:39] hate us and you can't help people
[58:41] getting offended but let's not let our
[58:42] attitudes be the orphans
[58:44] amen we don't have to be confrontational
[58:47] we don't have to be rude listen we're in
[58:50] it for their souls we ought to be in it
[58:52] for their souls not to be right but
[58:53] we're in it so that they can receive
[58:55] what we've got him and that's the right
[58:56] approach for these things and if we make
[58:58] fun of people if we put them down if if
[59:00] we we we take away the humanity whatever
[59:03] it is we're not doing them any help and
[59:05] we're not doing our testimony any help
[59:06] listen as Proverbs 18 19 says this a
[59:09] brother offended is harder to be one
[59:11] than a strong City and their contentions
[59:13] are like the bars of a castle
[59:15] now you say they're not a brother how do
[59:17] you know they're not a brother
[59:19] hey Saul wasn't a brother until he was
[59:21] Paul
[59:22] and he was a brother in an instant
[59:25] listen God can get a hold of somebody
[59:28] let's not let our attitude be the thing
[59:29] that holds him back mother brother
[59:30] Branham said that your attitude could
[59:32] determine somebody's Eternal destination
[59:34] you can't determine the Eternal
[59:36] destination of a true son or daughter of
[59:37] God because they're going to be there no
[59:38] matter what but there are people that
[59:40] will make it by choice and that choice
[59:42] can be related to how you treat them and
[59:44] your attitude towards them amen we've
[59:47] got a responsibility and we could
[59:49] literally hold somebody back from
[59:50] eternal life just by making our attitude
[59:53] wrong
[59:54] remember Paul said this to Timothy it's
[59:57] a good lesson to learn as a young man or
[59:58] a young woman
[59:59] it says in the servant of the Lord must
[1:00:01] not strive you're not there to battle
[1:00:03] you're not there to fight you're not
[1:00:05] tried there to try and win the fight for
[1:00:08] yourself he says but be gentle unto whom
[1:00:12] all men
[1:00:13] that means everybody
[1:00:15] he says apt to teach and patient my wife
[1:00:18] and I we we comment about this and
[1:00:20] brother Tim was here and I was asking
[1:00:21] him so many questions and you know what
[1:00:23] he never got frustrated with me we
[1:00:25] talked hours after hours after hours and
[1:00:28] and late into the night sometimes and he
[1:00:31] was always patient with me always
[1:00:33] patient I appreciated that
[1:00:35] now can I do the same thing with
[1:00:36] somebody that is relatively as ignorant
[1:00:39] or somebody that is just pure ignorant
[1:00:40] towards me and the things that we
[1:00:42] believe can I be apt to teach can I be
[1:00:44] patient with them it says in meekness
[1:00:45] remember what meekness is meekness is
[1:00:48] what having power to destroy but having
[1:00:50] character not to
[1:00:52] there are times where people do things
[1:00:54] and you could pin them to the wall
[1:00:58] but you're in it for them not in it for
[1:00:59] you and because of that you forego the
[1:01:02] power to give them the truth
[1:01:04] amen instructing those that oppose
[1:01:06] themselves they're doing damage to
[1:01:08] themselves their thought their their the
[1:01:10] way they're handling things the way
[1:01:11] they're looking at things is damaging to
[1:01:13] themselves and they don't see it that's
[1:01:14] what you're trying to get them to see is
[1:01:16] that you're hurting yourself you're not
[1:01:17] hurting me you're hurting yourself it
[1:01:20] says what if God prayer Venture so if by
[1:01:22] some chance God will give them
[1:01:24] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[1:01:26] truth and that they may recover
[1:01:28] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[1:01:30] who are taken captive by him at his will
[1:01:32] so they're trapped and our attitude is
[1:01:35] the very thing that can determine if
[1:01:36] they get out of that trap or not our
[1:01:38] attitude not our words our attitude
[1:01:41] you'll see here he addresses our
[1:01:43] attitude not our words we got the right
[1:01:45] words how do we approach the situation
[1:01:47] how do we approach the person amen
[1:01:49] the way we handle people ought to be
[1:01:51] completely different from the way the
[1:01:52] world does because we ought to be in it
[1:01:54] for them not for us not to give them
[1:01:57] something they didn't earn not we're not
[1:01:59] we're not getting into that sort of
[1:02:00] thing but to take them to a gospel that
[1:02:02] can free them from where they are
[1:02:04] because that's what he did for us amen
[1:02:06] brother Brian would say this he said
[1:02:07] God's people is never
[1:02:11] that's an absolute
[1:02:12] never to act like the world or look like
[1:02:16] the world or be anything to do with the
[1:02:19] world
[1:02:20] never act never look never do it be
[1:02:22] anything to do with the world you are a
[1:02:24] separated people the church a called out
[1:02:27] A peculiar people a royal priesthood a
[1:02:30] holy nation all together different and
[1:02:33] set aside and all your actions and
[1:02:36] habits and ways from the things of the
[1:02:39] world
[1:02:40] they know I was I was studying this and
[1:02:42] you know something that jumped out of me
[1:02:43] and I'm going to get a little pastoral
[1:02:44] this evening
[1:02:48] but as a warning not as something I see
[1:02:50] here
[1:02:51] but I'm not seeing this in the church
[1:02:53] here but you know what I'm seeing so
[1:02:55] much around this message who's being
[1:02:57] affected by this
[1:02:58] young men
[1:03:01] used to be we focused on the women
[1:03:04] but you know what's happening now is
[1:03:05] it's it's it's twisting and it's trying
[1:03:07] to get young men into this place where
[1:03:09] they're starting to act more and more
[1:03:11] like the world
[1:03:12] and you're finding it's getting a lot
[1:03:14] harder to find a good husband
[1:03:16] because they're being drawn into the
[1:03:17] world and they're getting drawn up and
[1:03:18] and tied into the things of the world
[1:03:20] I'm seeing trendy haircuts left right
[1:03:22] and Center
[1:03:24] listen we don't all have to have our
[1:03:25] hair parted to the side
[1:03:27] we don't have to nothing said that you
[1:03:29] know brother Brown talks about a man
[1:03:30] putting his hair down the middle he says
[1:03:31] I thought that looked kind of nice
[1:03:33] but we are not to be changing our
[1:03:36] hairstyle every year based on what is
[1:03:38] trendy they're buying designer clothes
[1:03:40] they're buying 500 sneakers they're
[1:03:42] starting to wear all kinds of jewelry
[1:03:44] they've got all the latest toys and
[1:03:46] Technology they're very active on social
[1:03:49] media
[1:03:50] where is this coming from
[1:03:53] that ought not to be in the life of a
[1:03:55] true Son of God it not ought to be in a
[1:03:57] daughter's light a daughter of God's
[1:03:58] life either but you know what if the men
[1:04:00] do it the women will take it twice as
[1:04:01] far
[1:04:03] so I say God let those men get the Holy
[1:04:05] Ghost that'll take them out of that so
[1:04:07] that they're not looking for what
[1:04:08] somebody online to approve them but say
[1:04:11] what does God think about me because
[1:04:14] that's what an online life is all about
[1:04:15] is getting what the what approval of
[1:04:18] somebody that doesn't affect you day to
[1:04:20] day
[1:04:21] it's just shallow approval it means
[1:04:24] nothing it costs nothing
[1:04:26] and you'll find that they give it back
[1:04:28] and forth back and forth but there's no
[1:04:30] change that comes through those things
[1:04:31] amen I say what's driving us to make our
[1:04:34] lifestyle mimicked out of the world
[1:04:35] what's the influence it ain't a royal
[1:04:37] priesthood that's on Instagram
[1:04:39] all the time
[1:04:41] the anti-royal priesthood that's on
[1:04:43] social media all the time it's not a the
[1:04:45] royal priesthood that's posting selfies
[1:04:47] of what they're doing all the time in
[1:04:48] videos and these things that's not it
[1:04:50] because a priesthood is focused on
[1:04:52] worship
[1:04:54] not on appearance
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] like I'm saying we don't have to all
[1:04:59] dress the same way we don't have to look
[1:05:01] the exact same way I'm not saying that
[1:05:03] but I'm saying if we're chart if we're
[1:05:05] if the changes we see in our appearance
[1:05:07] in life mimic those of what the world is
[1:05:09] doing then we got a different we got
[1:05:11] something else that's influencing us
[1:05:12] amen and I say that by Grace we don't
[1:05:14] see it today in our in our in our church
[1:05:16] and our young men are maybe a bit too
[1:05:17] young for some of those things but we
[1:05:19] don't see it in our young women either
[1:05:20] and I praise the Lord for that I praise
[1:05:22] the Lord for that we've got young
[1:05:23] sisters that can hold themselves apart
[1:05:24] from these things amen
[1:05:26] but let me put it this way if your
[1:05:28] inspiration to do something comes from
[1:05:30] the world
[1:05:31] throw it away
[1:05:34] because you can't get something pure
[1:05:36] from a dirty fountain
[1:05:38] you can't do it
[1:05:39] you have to start with purity
[1:05:42] not purify
[1:05:43] you can't purify this world the only
[1:05:45] thing that purifies this world is fire
[1:05:47] and you know what Holy Ghost Fire if you
[1:05:50] go back into uh
[1:05:52] and I forget if it was I think it was in
[1:05:53] numbers Maybe
[1:05:55] that that anything they took
[1:05:58] in Canaan had to pass through the fire
[1:06:02] to be usable
[1:06:04] why because if it was an idol when it
[1:06:07] went through the fire it'd go to gold
[1:06:10] it'd go to the base material it would
[1:06:11] have no value other than the material
[1:06:13] you couldn't worship something that made
[1:06:14] it through the fire
[1:06:16] that's the way it's got to be in our
[1:06:17] lives it's got to go through the Holy
[1:06:18] Ghost and guess what the Holy Ghost does
[1:06:20] not take what this world has and then
[1:06:22] massage it and and shape it up a little
[1:06:25] bit and present it as something that's
[1:06:26] holy it doesn't work that way you can't
[1:06:28] start with a with a with a polluted
[1:06:31] Fountain and come out with clean water
[1:06:32] that's not the way these things work
[1:06:34] amen that's what the world did the world
[1:06:36] went out and they saw how to speak they
[1:06:38] saw how to present they saw how to do
[1:06:40] these things and what you end up with is
[1:06:42] a Hillsong church or a Bethel Church in
[1:06:44] these different things and they saw that
[1:06:46] what if you brought a program
[1:06:48] and you brought an approach then you
[1:06:50] could get people in and you could turn
[1:06:52] them into people that sit on the bench
[1:06:54] in the pews of the church rather than
[1:06:56] convicting and converting them they got
[1:06:58] away from the original gospel and they
[1:06:59] got into programs that worked oh they
[1:07:01] worked all right
[1:07:03] to make you what twofold more a child of
[1:07:04] hell
[1:07:06] a religious spirit sitting in a Pew in a
[1:07:08] church amen you can't do it to music you
[1:07:10] can't do it to preaching you can't do it
[1:07:11] to prayer you cannot start with an
[1:07:13] influence that's outside of the word of
[1:07:14] God and then make it conform to it
[1:07:16] listen I've seen churches today and
[1:07:19] literally these are some of the better
[1:07:20] known churches in America and they're
[1:07:22] using Disney themes including costumes
[1:07:25] for their Series in their Church
[1:07:29] so we're doing one on manifesting time
[1:07:31] you know what they're doing a Disney
[1:07:33] theme where the pastors plural the man
[1:07:36] and a woman dress up in Disney themed
[1:07:39] costumes to present their messages in
[1:07:41] place
[1:07:42] that's how far they've sunk
[1:07:44] how silly is that you say how could they
[1:07:46] ever think that that's of God that's
[1:07:48] where they've gotten is they think that
[1:07:49] that works more than the original gospel
[1:07:52] let me put it this way they're satisfied
[1:07:54] with the results they get from that
[1:07:56] and that's why they don't change
[1:07:59] you can't draw a natural influence from
[1:08:01] the world and get a supernatural result
[1:08:02] that's the simple truth
[1:08:04] brother Brown says this
[1:08:07] he says why do you want to wear clothes
[1:08:09] like that
[1:08:10] he says now I'm talking to you women
[1:08:11] because I see you letting your kids on
[1:08:14] the street act like that and you
[1:08:16] yourself are
[1:08:17] so mama what happens when daddy's not
[1:08:19] away
[1:08:20] does the does the standard slip when
[1:08:22] Daddy's Gone to work when daddy's away
[1:08:24] for a few days
[1:08:26] he says what in the world do you want to
[1:08:28] wear clothes like that for I don't care
[1:08:30] how much religion you're supposed to
[1:08:31] have that shows in your heart what's
[1:08:33] coming out that shows exactly what
[1:08:35] you're made out of why he says you
[1:08:37] deafened your ear to the real Gospel of
[1:08:41] liberation
[1:08:42] you haven't been set free yet you
[1:08:44] haven't been set free there's something
[1:08:45] still has a hold on you and that's why
[1:08:47] you do it and that's why you let your
[1:08:48] kids do it is because you haven't been
[1:08:50] freed from it yourself
[1:08:53] listen the wives of the greatest
[1:08:55] reflection of the husband and you'll see
[1:08:56] that go right down through to the kids
[1:08:59] and sometimes the reflection in the wife
[1:09:00] is a husband hasn't hasn't defeated
[1:09:02] something and sometimes what's in the
[1:09:03] kids is that the mother hasn't defeated
[1:09:05] anything either
[1:09:06] you'll see it play on through because
[1:09:07] she has to allow it because she's
[1:09:09] allowing it in her own life he says you
[1:09:11] are marked by the Antichrist acting like
[1:09:13] him and the fruits of your life proves
[1:09:16] what you are
[1:09:17] now then he says and you men because you
[1:09:20] let her do it it shows who your God is
[1:09:22] brother man would always take it back to
[1:09:24] the man of the house
[1:09:25] buck stops with us men
[1:09:27] husbands fathers the buck stops with us
[1:09:29] everything that happens in her house
[1:09:32] it it's our it's our responsibility
[1:09:35] whether or not we know it it's still our
[1:09:38] responsibility because it's our
[1:09:39] responsibility to know it
[1:09:41] amen we've got to stay connected we've
[1:09:43] got to know what's going on in these
[1:09:44] things he says it shows who your God is
[1:09:46] and shows what you've done that's gospel
[1:09:48] that's the word now who has got the mark
[1:09:50] of the beast he said it's so close that
[1:09:53] it would deceive the very elective
[1:09:54] possible can't you see friends at apple
[1:09:56] trees bear apples pear trees bear pears
[1:09:59] what in the world does a woman that's
[1:10:01] supposed to be a child of God want to
[1:10:03] dress like that it's because that down
[1:10:05] in your heart he says trying to hold it
[1:10:07] over with the religious crust
[1:10:10] he says you've listened to the devil
[1:10:16] you got a reason you've got an excuse
[1:10:18] you've got something that says this is
[1:10:20] why I do it but he says it's just a
[1:10:22] religious cross that's covering up the
[1:10:24] fact that you listen to the devil
[1:10:25] somewhere
[1:10:26] he says that's right and maybe your
[1:10:28] pastor is guilty for not telling you the
[1:10:29] truth that's right God help us to speak
[1:10:32] the truth amen like I said I'm not
[1:10:35] seeing this here by God's grace by God's
[1:10:37] grace and I I had this in my notes and I
[1:10:40] struggled whether to bring it but you
[1:10:41] never know who's listening and guess
[1:10:42] what as fathers I'll speak to the
[1:10:44] fathers and husbands we got to be aware
[1:10:46] of what's going on in our house and
[1:10:47] we've got to be responsible for what's
[1:10:49] going on our house and our lives ought
[1:10:51] to be what an example of what's supposed
[1:10:54] to be happening in our lives amen
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:58] don't ever take a worldly idea and try
[1:11:00] and spiritualize it don't ever do it it
[1:11:03] doesn't work get your inspiration
[1:11:06] from the fount of life amen that's where
[1:11:08] we want to get these things like I said
[1:11:10] churches doing Disney themes and and
[1:11:12] costumes and plays to try and bring
[1:11:14] people to Christ
[1:11:16] how the mighty have fallen
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:19] the other thing of a priesthood is that
[1:11:21] they were the only ones that could eat
[1:11:22] the showbread in the temple and eat the
[1:11:24] Manna in the presence of God
[1:11:26] that's the only ones that had access to
[1:11:28] if they had access to a feast they had
[1:11:30] access to a bread to to the bread of
[1:11:33] life that only a priest could touch
[1:11:36] the laity never got it
[1:11:39] and yet Peter comes along and he says
[1:11:40] we're all royal priesthood it's not just
[1:11:43] brother John it's not just the the
[1:11:45] fivefold ministry that gets the taste of
[1:11:47] this bread of life but now we all have
[1:11:48] access to it and he says your access to
[1:11:50] the word proves that you're a royal
[1:11:52] priesthood because only the royal
[1:11:53] priesthood had had access to that what
[1:11:55] that bread of life that was a manner
[1:11:57] that never went bad
[1:11:59] so one of the greatest Miracles you
[1:12:00] could see is that until Christ died
[1:12:04] there was fresh Manna in there year
[1:12:06] after year for thousands of years it
[1:12:08] never went away it never rotted it never
[1:12:12] ran out every year if you were the high
[1:12:14] priest you got to go in and you got to
[1:12:15] taste of that manna
[1:12:17] is a supernatural thing and now today
[1:12:19] you get to taste of that Manna every
[1:12:21] single day because the veil has been
[1:12:23] torn and Christ the word has been
[1:12:25] revealed to us and now we've got access
[1:12:26] to that amen
[1:12:30] he says what you're chosen and elected
[1:12:32] to taste see understand and experience
[1:12:34] things that the rest of the world can't
[1:12:35] even comprehend that's where you're
[1:12:37] sitting today
[1:12:39] then he would call us a holy nation and
[1:12:40] what does that word holy mean it means
[1:12:42] dedicated to God and set aside for
[1:12:45] service to God Brother Brad would say
[1:12:47] the word holy and this this is confirmed
[1:12:48] by many others the word holy in Hebrew
[1:12:51] is the same word as Sanctified in Greek
[1:12:53] so holy and Sanctified are two things
[1:12:55] that are that are synonymous but the
[1:12:57] very definition of Holiness comes
[1:12:59] through its attachment to God
[1:13:01] in other words God determines what
[1:13:03] sanctification looks like God determines
[1:13:05] what holy looks like God determines what
[1:13:07] can be holy and what is Holy and what
[1:13:09] makes something holy it's a definition
[1:13:10] that rests in God and not in man so I I
[1:13:13] could say that this is a holy suit it's
[1:13:15] it's blue and it's I wear a white shirt
[1:13:17] and I wear a copper tie and it's a holy
[1:13:19] soup because I'm a preacher and I'm
[1:13:21] doing the things of God no I don't get
[1:13:22] to say that but if God says a preacher
[1:13:24] wears a blue suit with a white shirt and
[1:13:26] a copper tie now it's a holy soup
[1:13:28] because he said that it's a holy suit I
[1:13:30] don't get to determine it he gets to
[1:13:32] determine it
[1:13:33] so Peter says you're a holy nation
[1:13:34] you're holy because God said you're holy
[1:13:37] but we'll get into why we're holy in
[1:13:38] just a minute amen but the right thing
[1:13:40] has to be used the right way for it to
[1:13:42] be holy because you take what people are
[1:13:44] doing this word they're using a holy
[1:13:46] bible to do a lot of Unholy things like
[1:13:48] using Disney as an example in their
[1:13:49] Church
[1:13:51] the Bible's still holy but they're using
[1:13:53] it in a holy way and what do they do
[1:13:55] they pervert it with their own thoughts
[1:13:57] and ideas you can't add to it you can't
[1:13:58] take away from it you got to take it the
[1:14:00] way it is for it to be holy
[1:14:02] amen otherwise it becomes a perversion
[1:14:05] brother Brown says it this way he says
[1:14:06] we want to be so big we're some kind of
[1:14:09] a big turned around caller some kind of
[1:14:11] close you know that makes us look so
[1:14:12] holy and reverent there is no Holiness
[1:14:15] with us we can't be holy Holiness is of
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:19] see certainly it ain't a holy church it
[1:14:21] ain't a Holy Mountain it's a holy God
[1:14:22] that's right not a holy people a holy
[1:14:24] God it's God in the people Peter
[1:14:28] referred to the Mount Transfiguration as
[1:14:29] the holy Mount but it meant the holy God
[1:14:32] was on the mountain it was a holy God
[1:14:34] there the presence of God is what made
[1:14:36] it holy he said it's the presence of God
[1:14:39] in our midst now that brings Holiness
[1:14:42] brings Holiness you know not have the
[1:14:45] the nature of the characteristic of
[1:14:46] Holiness but it's the presence of God
[1:14:48] that makes you holy he says it's not my
[1:14:51] Holiness not yours but his Holiness his
[1:14:53] presence is what brings the Holiness we
[1:14:56] ought to Humble ourselves cover
[1:14:58] ourselves in reverence and humility and
[1:15:01] say Lord Jesus receive me into your
[1:15:03] kingdom he says it's his Holiness not
[1:15:06] ours now let me read this is one of the
[1:15:08] most beautiful quotes tonight he says
[1:15:10] the beauty of Holiness is where God
[1:15:13] dwells
[1:15:15] it's a different standard and it's not
[1:15:17] that you can do something but when God
[1:15:19] dwells with you when God's presence is
[1:15:21] with you that makes you holy and there's
[1:15:24] a beauty that comes with it and this is
[1:15:26] a whole different Beauty standard than
[1:15:27] what this world has
[1:15:29] you know tall skinny legs whatever
[1:15:31] whatever you want to go to this is not
[1:15:33] it the the beauty of Holiness is the
[1:15:35] presence of God in your life producing
[1:15:38] Christ that's what it is
[1:15:40] short tall fat thin
[1:15:44] ugly beautiful does not matter
[1:15:47] the beauty of a church is in the
[1:15:49] character of the people and the beauty
[1:15:52] of Holiness is shown in the character of
[1:15:53] Christ that's produced in each and every
[1:15:55] one of us amen
[1:15:59] then he says we're A peculiar people
[1:16:01] that were peculiar we say that means
[1:16:03] weird strange different you know what
[1:16:06] the word peculiar actually means
[1:16:08] it means valued property or treasure
[1:16:12] so if somebody says you're peculiar
[1:16:13] they're actually giving you a very nice
[1:16:15] compliment
[1:16:16] but we've switched it today to peculiar
[1:16:18] meaning like I said uh weird or strange
[1:16:21] or odd or different or these different
[1:16:23] things and none of us by choice would
[1:16:25] want to be known as peculiar
[1:16:27] you wouldn't want to be known as The
[1:16:29] Peculiar one in a group would you
[1:16:30] because that would set you aside that
[1:16:32] would make you different from everyone
[1:16:33] else it would make you the oddball
[1:16:36] brother Brian would preach the Oddball
[1:16:37] remember
[1:16:38] every believer is an oddball
[1:16:41] we might match in certain ways to the
[1:16:43] world because we just are what we are
[1:16:45] we're humans we dress a certain way in
[1:16:47] these different things especially for us
[1:16:48] men we can look just like it but there
[1:16:50] comes a point where that oddballness
[1:16:52] comes out and people realize he ain't
[1:16:54] what I am
[1:16:56] he doesn't think the way I think he
[1:16:57] doesn't talk the way I talk he's an
[1:16:58] oddballer she's an oddball in these
[1:17:00] different things right now we've touched
[1:17:02] a bit on this already and I don't want
[1:17:03] to beat it to death but this idea of
[1:17:05] being separated or differentiated from
[1:17:06] the world and the and the things of the
[1:17:08] world but I want to share just two
[1:17:09] quotes with you and then we'll move on
[1:17:11] brother I would say this he says they
[1:17:13] don't want to act any different than
[1:17:15] what they always act
[1:17:17] but when you become a Christian you are
[1:17:19] a peculiar person a royal priesthood a
[1:17:22] strange Nation odd people do odd things
[1:17:25] and strange things he says in their
[1:17:28] Unbecoming to the world
[1:17:31] if the world is giving us accolades all
[1:17:33] the time we're doing something wrong
[1:17:35] now I'm not talking about work ethic
[1:17:39] no no I'm not talking about dedication
[1:17:40] but there comes a point where we do
[1:17:43] things and people say you're odd I
[1:17:44] remember I was at a Christmas uh
[1:17:46] celebration of Christmas party at work
[1:17:48] there back in Edmonton and and everybody
[1:17:50] was drinking except for me and my wife
[1:17:52] of course and I was talking to one of my
[1:17:54] engineers and he said yeah you know I I
[1:17:56] don't like I never liked the taste of
[1:17:59] beer
[1:18:00] I said so why are you drinking it he
[1:18:03] said
[1:18:03] well it's an acquired taste I said why
[1:18:06] would you try and enjoy something you
[1:18:08] don't enjoy naturally
[1:18:09] he said because everybody does it
[1:18:13] you go someplace you go to an event
[1:18:15] everybody's drinking and so you stand
[1:18:16] out if you don't do it so he said I
[1:18:19] learned to drink it
[1:18:20] I learned to enjoy it he literally
[1:18:23] forced himself to take something into
[1:18:26] his body that was distasteful to him for
[1:18:28] the sake of acceptance
[1:18:30] fit in
[1:18:32] brotherbraham says no no what you're
[1:18:34] doing is you're Unbecoming to the world
[1:18:37] he says and you're when you're in the
[1:18:38] world you're Unbecoming to God one is
[1:18:41] vice versa from the other what makes you
[1:18:42] act like they do in heaven the other
[1:18:44] makes you like they do on Earth so
[1:18:46] you're going to be peculiar here you're
[1:18:47] going to be peculiar there
[1:18:51] you're going to fit in one way one time
[1:18:55] I'd rather be out of place here so I can
[1:18:57] be in place up there
[1:18:58] I want to fit in at the marriage supper
[1:19:00] of the Lamb amen I want to know who's
[1:19:02] sitting around me and why we're friends
[1:19:03] and why we're Believers and why we're
[1:19:05] all together
[1:19:07] brother John Andes was literally reading
[1:19:09] the same scripture that I I've read here
[1:19:11] about a royal priesthood yesterday and
[1:19:13] he shared this this quote with me with
[1:19:15] with a number of people he says he
[1:19:17] doesn't want us to be fashioned like the
[1:19:18] things of the world
[1:19:20] he wants us peculiar set aside he said I
[1:19:23] don't mean now to be silly as we call it
[1:19:26] you know what he means weird for the
[1:19:28] sake of being weird
[1:19:29] don't don't just stand out to try and
[1:19:32] let people know you're a believer
[1:19:34] be real be sincere
[1:19:37] but don't try and make it obvious that
[1:19:40] you're a Christian just to let people
[1:19:42] know you hang around long enough they'll
[1:19:44] know
[1:19:45] and it'll be much more natural and it'll
[1:19:46] be much much more easy to have a
[1:19:49] discussion or or to test you know give a
[1:19:51] testimony or share these things
[1:19:53] he said he says don't don't don't don't
[1:19:55] don't be silly he says I mean to be a
[1:19:58] called out people oh a blessed holy
[1:20:00] nation living lives that's above
[1:20:02] reproach
[1:20:04] he says acting behaving ourselves just
[1:20:07] like he would working in us for we are
[1:20:10] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[1:20:12] unto good works
[1:20:15] then he would say this he says we need a
[1:20:16] cleaning up all the way from the public
[1:20:18] Plum to the janitor he says no wonder
[1:20:22] that's right no wonder this laodicean
[1:20:23] church is lukewarm he says lo I stand at
[1:20:26] the door and knock lay it a scenes we
[1:20:27] can still shout we can make a little
[1:20:29] noise but what goods the noise if the
[1:20:32] life doesn't compare with it
[1:20:35] and then your praise ought not to exceed
[1:20:37] your testimony is what he's saying
[1:20:41] Peter's saying The Virtue you've got has
[1:20:44] to be something that can be shown
[1:20:46] it's your identity as a people dedicated
[1:20:48] to God and that means you can't look
[1:20:51] like anything that this world has to
[1:20:52] offer you can't conform to it you can't
[1:20:54] mimic it you can't mirror it you can't
[1:20:56] do anything it has to be a reflection of
[1:20:58] the word of God and out of this virtue
[1:21:00] comes praise and glory to God
[1:21:03] that's what it is the virtue we're here
[1:21:05] is for him it's for others not for
[1:21:08] ourselves and that's what you'll find as
[1:21:10] we're talking about the Statue of a
[1:21:11] perfect man is you really start with
[1:21:13] things that are internal and then God
[1:21:15] uses them to become external
[1:21:17] they develop you and then when you're
[1:21:18] developed then he can use you to help
[1:21:20] develop others help grow others help
[1:21:21] feed others help encourage others so uh
[1:21:24] you know all these different things he
[1:21:25] can put you into use the first thing is
[1:21:26] to make you ready so that you can be
[1:21:28] used
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:31] but we want to see how we get this
[1:21:33] virtue we want to see brother John we're
[1:21:35] talking about virtue how do I get this
[1:21:36] kind of virtue where we're talking about
[1:21:38] moral living we're talking about
[1:21:39] uprightness we're talking about living
[1:21:41] by the word now Peter will put it this
[1:21:43] way he says according as his divine
[1:21:45] power hath given unto us all things that
[1:21:48] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:21:50] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[1:21:51] to glory and virtue
[1:21:54] so it's what it's the divine power of
[1:21:56] God it's the working of God as we said
[1:21:58] before the statue of a perfect man is
[1:22:00] absolutely a working of the holy spirit
[1:22:02] with us it's the tutoring of the holy
[1:22:05] spirit it's the Willing it's the
[1:22:07] presence it's the the the the the
[1:22:09] dwelling of the Holy Spirit around us
[1:22:11] it's an anointing around us that's
[1:22:13] drawing the word out of us it's pulling
[1:22:15] out of us the attributes that are in
[1:22:16] that seed of God that are inside each
[1:22:18] and every one of us it's inside of you
[1:22:20] and it's drawing it out
[1:22:22] it's the working of God and this takes
[1:22:24] the power of God it takes the life of
[1:22:25] God takes the presence of God to pull
[1:22:27] these things out of us amen
[1:22:29] how are you going to live what kind of
[1:22:30] life that pleases God unless you're
[1:22:31] taught how to do it
[1:22:34] you've got to be taught how to do it
[1:22:36] that's why we have the preaching of the
[1:22:37] word that's why we have the reading of
[1:22:38] the word the hearing of the word is to
[1:22:40] what to draw us into these things and
[1:22:41] we'll read a quote where brother Brown
[1:22:42] would say this very thing he says that's
[1:22:44] why you come to church
[1:22:45] that's why you come to church is to
[1:22:47] learn how to live right
[1:22:49] to learn what God expects us to do and
[1:22:51] then we have to make a conscious choice
[1:22:52] for those things
[1:22:54] amen so virtue is about this moral
[1:22:56] Excellence or uprightness and we see
[1:22:58] that with job maybe above all others in
[1:22:59] the scriptures and Job 1 1 it says what
[1:23:02] there was a man in the Land of Oz whose
[1:23:04] name was job and that man was perfect
[1:23:06] and upright
[1:23:08] in other words he had virtue
[1:23:10] and one that feared God and issued evil
[1:23:13] now we don't use that word issued
[1:23:15] anymore
[1:23:17] because we've got much easier words it
[1:23:19] means departed turned away from or
[1:23:22] removed himself from
[1:23:24] evil so you'll find that virtue is
[1:23:27] evident in being applied when evil is
[1:23:29] being issued
[1:23:31] when evil has been turned away from when
[1:23:33] evil has been pushed aside when evil is
[1:23:35] being departed from that means virtue is
[1:23:37] being expressed inside of your life
[1:23:39] and this is really a portion of
[1:23:41] repentance amen and it's a conscious
[1:23:43] decision to say I'm going to do what the
[1:23:46] word says you'll find that what we're
[1:23:48] talking about because faith is something
[1:23:49] that's inside of you but you'll find
[1:23:51] that virtue starts with your mind first
[1:23:53] you have to decide I'm going to do it
[1:23:58] you have to make a conscious decision to
[1:24:00] these things amen everything we have the
[1:24:02] things we look at on our phones or
[1:24:03] computers the way we spend our time the
[1:24:04] way we spend our day the things that we
[1:24:06] dwell on all of these things are
[1:24:08] conscious decisions and Satan has five
[1:24:11] inner senses and five outer senses that
[1:24:13] try and influence our mind to do the
[1:24:16] things that he wants us to do
[1:24:18] what's he trying to do get us off the
[1:24:20] path that leads us to Christ let us out
[1:24:22] get off the path that leads us to
[1:24:24] eternal life and all we've got to do is
[1:24:26] come to the place where we recognize it
[1:24:28] and then say consciously I'm not
[1:24:31] interested
[1:24:32] I'm not interested that's the first
[1:24:34] thing the scripture says resist the
[1:24:36] devil
[1:24:37] and he will flee from you
[1:24:39] so remember the greatest battle ever
[1:24:41] fought is up here
[1:24:43] and if you're going to do right it
[1:24:45] starts here
[1:24:46] if you're going to do wrong it also
[1:24:48] starts up here remember Brandon would
[1:24:50] talk about a man that would go and
[1:24:51] commit adultery with his wife I already
[1:24:53] did it in his mind before he did it in
[1:24:54] real life the sin started here so Eve
[1:24:58] sin started here before she ever
[1:24:59] committed a fornication
[1:25:02] it starts here and so virtue starts with
[1:25:05] a conscious decision
[1:25:06] you know it has the greatest expression
[1:25:08] of virtuous decision making in the
[1:25:10] scriptures Joseph
[1:25:14] had had some of the greatest virtue
[1:25:16] we'll ever see Joseph's method for
[1:25:18] dealing with temptation
[1:25:19] was it was perfect because remember his
[1:25:22] master's wife came to him she tried to
[1:25:24] seduce him if you read the scriptures
[1:25:26] the first time Joseph says no and here's
[1:25:30] why
[1:25:31] you're allowed to have that conversation
[1:25:34] somebody wants you to do something
[1:25:36] somebody wants to introduce you to
[1:25:37] something somebody wants you to try
[1:25:39] something you get to say no and here's
[1:25:41] why
[1:25:43] he says your ma your husband my master
[1:25:46] has given me Authority in his house over
[1:25:47] everything except you how could I do
[1:25:49] that to him you're his wife I will not
[1:25:52] touch you
[1:25:53] and then after that when she tries to
[1:25:55] seduce him again he never says a word he
[1:25:58] uses his feet for discernment and he
[1:26:00] gets out of there
[1:26:02] he gets out of there he does that say I
[1:26:04] done told you once I done told you twice
[1:26:06] stopped he left the scripture says he
[1:26:09] ran she laid hold of him and he ran
[1:26:13] he didn't stop and have a conversation
[1:26:15] he got out of that room to where he
[1:26:18] would be safe
[1:26:21] struggling with something maybe it's
[1:26:23] because you keep having a conversation
[1:26:24] with it
[1:26:25] turn and walk away
[1:26:27] Paul would say this to Timothy Timothy's
[1:26:30] a great one young people you want to you
[1:26:31] want to know how to live your life read
[1:26:33] Timothy Timothy was a young man coming
[1:26:35] into Ministry Paul Was preparing him for
[1:26:37] a life of service and Paul would say
[1:26:39] this he says flee also youthful lusts
[1:26:43] but follow righteousness Faith charity
[1:26:45] peace and with them with them that call
[1:26:48] on the Lord out of a pure heart Paul's
[1:26:50] me speaking to Timothy he was a young
[1:26:51] man but let me say today this ain't just
[1:26:53] for a young person this is for all of us
[1:26:56] but Paul would say flee youthful us
[1:26:58] because if you don't defeat it as a
[1:26:59] youthful us it becomes an adult lust and
[1:27:02] let me tell you it's way harder to kick
[1:27:04] an adult loss than it is a youthful lust
[1:27:06] because as an adult you have time you
[1:27:08] have money you have privacy you have
[1:27:09] choices you have options that you don't
[1:27:11] have as a young person
[1:27:13] amen parents that's why we protect our
[1:27:15] kids so that they can defeat these
[1:27:17] things before they get the chance Satan
[1:27:19] gets a chance to really get his hooks
[1:27:21] into him there's things I had to defeat
[1:27:23] as an adult because I didn't flee them
[1:27:24] as a youth because I didn't defeat him
[1:27:26] as a youth and they're way harder to
[1:27:27] beat as an adult because that demon
[1:27:29] grows up into a big demon a strong demon
[1:27:32] he becomes a strong man in the house and
[1:27:33] you get addicted or you get calloused
[1:27:37] you get addicted or you get callous an
[1:27:39] addiction means you give excuses and
[1:27:42] callous means you don't even realize you
[1:27:43] got a problem you're so used to it
[1:27:45] you're so hard into it it's just an
[1:27:47] accepted part of your life and then what
[1:27:49] it takes is the word to come along and
[1:27:51] say you ought not to have that and not
[1:27:53] only that but I can free you from it if
[1:27:55] you'll just let me do it
[1:27:57] God comes along and he offers you an
[1:27:59] opportunity to be free of whatever's
[1:28:00] been holding you up that's tough as an
[1:28:03] adult
[1:28:04] it's so much harder to humble yourself
[1:28:07] it seems as an adult it's so much harder
[1:28:09] to confess I got a problem
[1:28:12] it is tough
[1:28:14] it's very tough beat it as this young
[1:28:16] person so you don't have to deal with it
[1:28:17] as an adult
[1:28:23] takes God to come along it's like a
[1:28:24] chained animal brother Brian would talk
[1:28:26] about that Crow remember that was
[1:28:28] chained to a post and it was on its foot
[1:28:31] and so that Crow could only go so far
[1:28:33] and so it wore a circle into the ground
[1:28:35] because that's as far as the chain would
[1:28:37] go and when the chain came off that Crow
[1:28:39] never flew anywhere because it was so
[1:28:40] used to its binding
[1:28:42] don't get to the place where you can't
[1:28:43] fly because you've been bound so long
[1:28:45] a man gets set free while you still have
[1:28:47] a desire to fly
[1:28:49] and you you do these some of these
[1:28:51] things you try some of these things it's
[1:28:53] amazing what we see you know living in
[1:28:55] Vancouver the drug problems they have
[1:28:57] there
[1:28:58] and people I don't know how they get it
[1:28:59] I wouldn't know where to go if I wanted
[1:29:01] to get a hard drug
[1:29:02] but people try it once and they're
[1:29:05] hooked for life and it destroys their
[1:29:07] life it destroys their marriage it
[1:29:09] destroys their family it destroys their
[1:29:10] finances destroys their career one hit
[1:29:12] of these opioids that's going around
[1:29:15] or it kills them
[1:29:18] it literally destroys their life one
[1:29:19] thing and you can't forget it once
[1:29:21] you've tried it once you've seen it once
[1:29:22] you've heard it once you've tasted it
[1:29:24] once you've tested it you can't forget
[1:29:26] it the memory is there forever
[1:29:29] it's the hardest thing to forget is
[1:29:31] something you've done or seen that you
[1:29:32] ought not to have done or seen
[1:29:34] beat it while you're young
[1:29:36] adults let us set an example
[1:29:38] Amen Let Us set an example for what not
[1:29:41] to do
[1:29:42] for what to keep clean from but also to
[1:29:44] show how to get clean
[1:29:46] how to repent how to be honest about the
[1:29:48] things that we're dealing with
[1:29:50] and let God take them out of our Lives
[1:29:51] amen I'm proud of our young sisters here
[1:29:53] we've got Selena and Justine and they go
[1:29:55] to work
[1:29:56] and they hold their standard and they
[1:29:58] they testify and they share the things
[1:29:59] of God and they're not they're not
[1:30:01] ashamed to talk about the things that we
[1:30:02] do as a church and as Believers in what
[1:30:04] God's done in their lives and and all of
[1:30:06] these different things but let me tell
[1:30:08] you there's a reward that comes with how
[1:30:09] you're being raised and how you've been
[1:30:11] raised and that's that you don't have
[1:30:12] the scars and the bruises and the lumps
[1:30:16] that come from Satan getting his hooks
[1:30:18] into you as a young person
[1:30:20] you don't have to deal with what young
[1:30:22] women are dealing with today
[1:30:24] and it's a wonderful thing
[1:30:26] and we don't always appreciate it I know
[1:30:27] that as a young man I didn't always
[1:30:29] appreciate the protection of my parent
[1:30:31] or my parents but it was for my good and
[1:30:33] I'm glad today that I can stand here and
[1:30:34] I don't have a lot of those things in me
[1:30:36] that people have had to deal with it's
[1:30:37] the grace of God that we have those
[1:30:39] things
[1:30:40] but you know as I was studying this I
[1:30:41] said you know we're talking about
[1:30:43] Temptation and we're talking about
[1:30:44] things that Satan's trying to put into
[1:30:46] your life but Satan attacks us in many
[1:30:48] other ways
[1:30:49] he doesn't just come with temptation but
[1:30:51] he comes to us with oppression
[1:30:53] he comes with us with sickness he comes
[1:30:55] with us with thoughts amen he'll come
[1:30:58] after your health he'll come after your
[1:30:59] mind he'll come after your peace he'll
[1:31:00] come after your rest he'll come after
[1:31:02] your joy
[1:31:03] your satisfaction your contentment
[1:31:06] he'll come after all these things Satan
[1:31:08] is a destroyer
[1:31:11] and a Tormentor
[1:31:13] nothing good comes out of what he does
[1:31:15] he can't help it
[1:31:17] brother Graham said this
[1:31:19] he says as I said a while ago to a young
[1:31:21] lady
[1:31:22] just drive down a post she was dealing
[1:31:24] with something he said just drive down a
[1:31:26] post right there in your mind and say on
[1:31:29] this platform tonight the prayer of
[1:31:32] faith was prayed for me
[1:31:35] it says and Satan the blood was put
[1:31:37] between you and me
[1:31:40] you've ever heard that song he can't
[1:31:41] cross the bloodline
[1:31:43] he can't cross a blood barrier
[1:31:46] you plead the blood he cannot cross it
[1:31:49] you put it under the blood he can't
[1:31:50] bring it out
[1:31:52] it's gone
[1:31:53] he can't bring it out only you can bring
[1:31:56] it out
[1:31:58] so don't you bring it out but don't let
[1:32:00] him bring it out
[1:32:02] he says you might as well go
[1:32:07] you come up to that post and say uh
[1:32:12] what's he saying he's saying you come
[1:32:14] and you rest on that experience you come
[1:32:17] rest on that promise you come rest on
[1:32:18] that prayer of faith and you say it's
[1:32:21] under the blood and I'm Healed I'm
[1:32:23] delivered I'm saved I'm filled with the
[1:32:24] Holy Ghost whatever it is you stand
[1:32:26] there and say uh-uh you can't cross past
[1:32:28] this point I've laid a stake here I've
[1:32:30] driven a post here and you can't dig it
[1:32:33] out
[1:32:34] he says here's a symptom comes
[1:32:38] you say
[1:32:40] he says don't punch at it don't punch at
[1:32:43] it don't punch a snake
[1:32:45] what's the worst thing you can do with a
[1:32:47] snake
[1:32:48] put your hand near its face
[1:32:49] because you're going to get bit you
[1:32:51] don't punch a snake he says just keep
[1:32:54] saying he says or just keep saying I
[1:32:56] rebuke you I rebuke you
[1:32:57] he says he will bite you see just ignore
[1:33:00] him walk away from him so he's defeated
[1:33:03] anyhow so there you are
[1:33:06] walk away from him because he doesn't
[1:33:09] have anything to say to you that you
[1:33:10] want to hear
[1:33:11] say Don't just punch it just don't punch
[1:33:13] it and say oh Lord rebuke him rebuke him
[1:33:15] ah don't do that see you're weakening
[1:33:18] what you really believe see
[1:33:20] tearing down your faith he's saying you
[1:33:22] do believe you really do believe
[1:33:26] so don't weaken your real Faith by
[1:33:30] having the conversation you're a
[1:33:31] Believer and you have believed so don't
[1:33:34] have the conversation because that never
[1:33:35] helps your belief
[1:33:37] having a conversation with doubt does
[1:33:39] not increase faith
[1:33:41] stand let him know he's not in he's not
[1:33:44] allowed to be there and then walk away
[1:33:53] if that happens up here
[1:33:55] you got to know who's talking to you
[1:33:59] you got to know who's talking to you
[1:34:01] I battled some things this week things
[1:34:03] kept coming up in situations
[1:34:06] and I'm about to preach on it and I had
[1:34:08] to realize this ain't God
[1:34:11] this is Satan trying to get me down
[1:34:13] trying to get me to look at
[1:34:14] circumstances trying to get me to look
[1:34:15] at people
[1:34:17] rather than what the word of God says
[1:34:20] so I had to literally stop and say
[1:34:22] I ain't thinking about this I'm going to
[1:34:24] think about the promise
[1:34:26] I'm going to think about Grace I'm going
[1:34:28] to think about Mercy I'm going to think
[1:34:29] about what the word is giving me as an
[1:34:30] option rather than what the
[1:34:32] circumstances are that you're telling me
[1:34:33] about constantly amen
[1:34:36] but this way we live there's a virtuous
[1:34:38] way to live there's a virtuous way to
[1:34:40] dress there's a virtuous way to talk
[1:34:41] there's a virtuous way to make a living
[1:34:43] there's a virtuous way to interact with
[1:34:45] people and we're supposed to live that
[1:34:47] way but if you look in the Bible that
[1:34:49] word virtuous is only mentioned four
[1:34:52] times
[1:34:55] the word Virtue is mentioned four times
[1:34:57] and the word virtuous is mentioned four
[1:35:00] times and every single time
[1:35:03] do you know who it refers to
[1:35:06] a woman
[1:35:09] every single time it mentions a woman
[1:35:11] one of them is Ruth
[1:35:14] and Naomi says everyone knows that
[1:35:17] you're a virtuous woman why
[1:35:19] she acted
[1:35:21] her life reflected virtue
[1:35:24] and then all other three times are in
[1:35:26] Proverbs and it refers to a wife
[1:35:30] you know what that tells me
[1:35:31] you sisters
[1:35:33] are the epitome of virtue
[1:35:36] God has in his word said that women are
[1:35:40] the greatest reflection of virtue that
[1:35:42] he has
[1:35:44] because why
[1:35:46] the Bride is a reflection of The Virtue
[1:35:49] and character that Christ expects
[1:35:51] he chooses her based on her character
[1:35:55] and so you Sisters You wives you mothers
[1:35:58] are the greatest attributes of virtue
[1:36:01] that God could find and he has literally
[1:36:03] placed you in the word as the epitome of
[1:36:05] the greatest expression the Apex of
[1:36:08] virtue
[1:36:09] is a virtuous woman
[1:36:13] you know what that word virtuous means
[1:36:17] wives mothers listen up
[1:36:21] a virtuous wife a virtuous woman is
[1:36:24] strong
[1:36:26] mighty
[1:36:27] able
[1:36:29] efficient
[1:36:31] wealthy
[1:36:33] a force
[1:36:35] and an army
[1:36:37] that's what God says you are
[1:36:41] I thought I'd get an amen out of that
[1:36:46] that's what God thinks about you sister
[1:36:47] Leah sister Blanca
[1:36:51] sister Amber sister Maureen sister
[1:36:53] Brenda
[1:36:54] that's sister Betty back there
[1:36:58] God thinks you are strong
[1:37:02] able Mighty efficient a force to be
[1:37:07] reckoned with an army and he thinks
[1:37:10] you're wealthy
[1:37:13] I say hallelujah
[1:37:15] I love it when God tells me what he
[1:37:17] thinks of me
[1:37:18] but this is for you sisters tonight
[1:37:20] amen I'm getting ahead of myself we're
[1:37:23] getting into the next service because
[1:37:24] we're going to talk about Sarah and
[1:37:25] these different things but it just just
[1:37:27] jumped out at me when you are producing
[1:37:28] The Virtue that Christ expects what does
[1:37:31] it do what does it produce it produces a
[1:37:35] life that can live the word in a way
[1:37:37] that benefits people around you
[1:37:40] because it would say of that wife it
[1:37:42] says you know there's women that do well
[1:37:44] your daughters do well it says but thou
[1:37:47] excellus them all you're better than
[1:37:49] every one of them
[1:37:51] there's people that do well there's
[1:37:53] people that try but you do it better
[1:37:56] than anybody else can do it
[1:37:58] you're the best of the best
[1:38:01] you are the Elite
[1:38:04] you are The Virtuous bride
[1:38:08] I was listening to brother Aaron McGeary
[1:38:10] just briefly today
[1:38:12] he was talking about this and he
[1:38:14] referenced First Corinthians 11 7-9 it
[1:38:17] says the woman
[1:38:19] is the glory of the man
[1:38:21] I'm not doing this to prop the men up
[1:38:23] but I'm putting it as a type because
[1:38:25] what the expression of the glory of God
[1:38:27] is in the bride
[1:38:29] and so you women are the literal
[1:38:31] reflection of what the bride of Christ
[1:38:33] is your reflection of the attribute one
[1:38:36] of the greatest attributes that can be
[1:38:37] in a Believer is that a virtue is the
[1:38:39] strength to what produce something that
[1:38:42] helps those around you that virtuous
[1:38:44] wife you look at in Proverbs of what
[1:38:46] that virtuous wife does she is a machine
[1:38:50] I'm glad I'm not a woman
[1:38:52] because you look at what she does she
[1:38:54] gets up before it's light and she goes
[1:38:56] to bed after it's dark
[1:38:57] and she's planning and she's arranging
[1:38:59] and she's making clothes and she's
[1:39:00] buying this and she's selling that and
[1:39:02] she's making sure everyone's clothed and
[1:39:03] fed and warm and this and that and the
[1:39:05] other thing
[1:39:06] hair comb for church good clothes on
[1:39:08] everything is set in order
[1:39:11] everything is run she knows what she's
[1:39:13] doing she's got it all in hand she's a
[1:39:16] force to be reckoned with she's like an
[1:39:17] army that's what happens when the virtue
[1:39:20] of Christ is shown through you you
[1:39:21] become something that can't be stopped
[1:39:23] you're an Unstoppable Army there's a
[1:39:25] reason why brother Brown calls a mother
[1:39:26] The Fifth Gospel
[1:39:28] you have access and to a to a people
[1:39:31] your children you get access to
[1:39:33] something that is so precious to God and
[1:39:36] he literally gives you the majority of
[1:39:37] your time to produce them and draw them
[1:39:40] into service and draw them into a life
[1:39:42] as a believer
[1:39:46] brother Ryan would talk about the three
[1:39:48] sacred trusts for a woman how you handle
[1:39:49] yourself how you yield yourself and how
[1:39:51] you express yourself
[1:39:53] and you sisters are the embodiment of
[1:39:56] what he's talking about
[1:39:57] this virtue that we're talking about I
[1:39:59] want to finish it with one one last
[1:40:01] thought on virtue this evening and this
[1:40:03] is Paul's thoughts on it and he would
[1:40:04] talk to the Philippian church about
[1:40:06] virtuously he talked come at it kind of
[1:40:09] from the way of how we think
[1:40:11] Paul understood what goes on our mind
[1:40:15] he understood what it was to fight to
[1:40:17] battle to struggle
[1:40:19] to have Satan come and bombard us with
[1:40:21] these things and he would say this to
[1:40:22] the Philippian Church
[1:40:24] he says finally brethren
[1:40:26] whatsoever things are true
[1:40:29] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:40:32] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:40:34] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:40:37] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:40:39] he says if there be any virtue if there
[1:40:42] be any praise think on these things the
[1:40:45] Amplified would say this way he says for
[1:40:46] the rest Brethren whatever is true
[1:40:48] whatever is worthy of reverence and is
[1:40:50] Honorable and seemingly whatever is just
[1:40:52] whatever is pure whatever is lovely and
[1:40:54] lovable whatever is kind and Winsome and
[1:40:57] gracious if there is any virtue and
[1:40:59] Excellence if there's anything worthy of
[1:41:01] Praise think on and weigh and take
[1:41:04] account of these things he says fix your
[1:41:07] minds on them
[1:41:10] you got to think on the right things to
[1:41:13] produce the right things amen Paul's
[1:41:14] saying be careful what you dwell on be
[1:41:17] careful where your thoughts are in any
[1:41:19] given day amen we're going to talk about
[1:41:21] how virtue of morality and character
[1:41:23] turns into strength in the next service
[1:41:24] but the decision for virtue happens
[1:41:27] first in your mind and you've got to
[1:41:28] take what's in your heart what's in your
[1:41:30] soul and apply it by your mind through
[1:41:33] your will to your life
[1:41:35] amen you've got to decide what you're
[1:41:38] going to think about
[1:41:39] it is a choice
[1:41:40] it is a choice amen
[1:41:42] Paul said dwell on good things think
[1:41:44] good thoughts if there's something right
[1:41:45] and wholesome talk about that
[1:41:47] we have a tendency to talk about the
[1:41:50] things that are going wrong rather than
[1:41:52] the things that are going right
[1:41:55] we have a tendency to talk about the
[1:41:57] problem rather than the promise
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:03] don't let Satan lead your mind around
[1:42:06] remember a bull has a ring through its
[1:42:07] nose for one reason
[1:42:09] it's real tender
[1:42:10] sometimes he gets into our minds and our
[1:42:12] minds are tender and he just starts to
[1:42:13] tug on our emotions he starts to tug on
[1:42:15] our memories he starts to to tug on
[1:42:17] things that have caused us problems in
[1:42:19] the past and he's trying to lead us
[1:42:20] around so that we don't get around
[1:42:24] to this
[1:42:25] if he can get us caught up in head games
[1:42:27] he's got us beaten that's where the
[1:42:29] greatest battle is is in your mind
[1:42:31] amen don't let circumstances lay hold of
[1:42:34] your thoughts don't be dwelling on the
[1:42:35] problems or failures or issues brother
[1:42:37] Brown had this beautiful quote
[1:42:40] he says
[1:42:41] you cannot get anything from God with a
[1:42:44] negative thought
[1:42:48] can we read it together
[1:42:49] you cannot get anything from God with a
[1:42:54] negative thought
[1:42:55] now you say brother John I can't stop a
[1:42:57] negative thought
[1:42:58] we're going to read a quote what brother
[1:42:59] Brown talks about it you know we're
[1:43:01] receivers
[1:43:03] that's what we are
[1:43:04] we're receivers
[1:43:06] but listen we got two two kingdoms
[1:43:10] and guess what we're built to tune into
[1:43:12] a Heavenly Kingdom
[1:43:15] and so we have a choice to decide
[1:43:18] what station we're going to listen to
[1:43:21] and if I'm not saying we can't say the
[1:43:25] reality of things
[1:43:26] but how do you take a negative thought
[1:43:29] true though it may be
[1:43:31] and turn it into a good thought
[1:43:34] think about the antidote
[1:43:37] think about the word promise to resolve
[1:43:39] the issue
[1:43:41] think about what the word says rather
[1:43:43] than what the circumstance does and turn
[1:43:46] it into a testimony potential
[1:43:48] rather than into a failure or a fault or
[1:43:51] a problem or an issue
[1:43:54] amen repeat the word listen to the word
[1:43:57] rather than the problem
[1:43:59] the confession of our mouth has to be
[1:44:01] the word of God and guess what words
[1:44:03] don't start in your mouth they start in
[1:44:05] your mind
[1:44:06] so you've got to have the right thinking
[1:44:07] there amen they begin in your mind and
[1:44:09] your thoughts and then your mouth speaks
[1:44:11] them so if you spend your day thinking
[1:44:13] negative thoughts then what kind of
[1:44:14] words come out of your mouth negative
[1:44:16] words depressed words defeated words
[1:44:19] words that find fault words that speak
[1:44:21] of failure words that speak about the
[1:44:23] maybes rather than the musts
[1:44:27] if you're dwelling on negative then all
[1:44:29] that's going to come out of you is
[1:44:30] negative as well we're not in Psychology
[1:44:32] here we're in the word
[1:44:35] if you're going to dwell on the
[1:44:36] negativity that's all that God can bring
[1:44:38] out
[1:44:39] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:44:40] come out of your mouth amen an
[1:44:42] overcoming Life starts with an
[1:44:43] overcoming mind because you've got to
[1:44:46] win here before you can win out here
[1:44:48] right virtue must reside in our thoughts
[1:44:50] before it ever comes out and be produced
[1:44:52] in our life
[1:44:54] you know what I love about brother Chad
[1:44:56] you can't drag a negative confession out
[1:44:58] of that man
[1:45:00] it's annoying sometimes
[1:45:05] I know he's listening
[1:45:07] brother Chad
[1:45:09] always has a positive confession
[1:45:13] he's not saying that the reality isn't
[1:45:15] there
[1:45:16] but he's saying I believe God
[1:45:19] time and time and time again
[1:45:26] that's an amazing thing to have
[1:45:30] that doesn't mean we can ignore
[1:45:31] realities
[1:45:33] doesn't mean we can't skip out on our
[1:45:35] work and our obligations I'm not
[1:45:36] speaking about the chat I'm speaking of
[1:45:38] all of us here right you can't say I
[1:45:40] believe God's going to do something
[1:45:41] wonderful and then sit around and do
[1:45:42] nothing
[1:45:43] Amen brother Chad has had to work to get
[1:45:46] where he's at brother Joe has had to
[1:45:48] work to where he's at in his business
[1:45:51] that doesn't exclude you from doing
[1:45:52] those things but his positive testimony
[1:45:55] you can't beat him down
[1:45:56] you can't beat him down
[1:45:58] that's literally what Paul's saying
[1:46:01] think on the good things
[1:46:03] think on the good things of God
[1:46:07] brother Brian would say this
[1:46:08] we're almost done here he says just
[1:46:10] around the corner when you get to
[1:46:11] thinking about Divine Healing get to
[1:46:13] thinking about Christ keep him on your
[1:46:15] mind he says if there be any praise if
[1:46:16] there be any virtue the Bible said think
[1:46:18] on these things if anything thought
[1:46:20] comes by well maybe it couldn't be so
[1:46:21] maybe it he says get it off your mind
[1:46:24] right quick think on things that are
[1:46:26] positive never let a negative thought
[1:46:28] pass through he says don't let it stop
[1:46:30] anyhow if it starts through keep your
[1:46:32] thoughts positive and then he says Jesus
[1:46:37] he says don't think sitting here in a
[1:46:40] wheelchair you you're helpless you're
[1:46:42] hopeless church we don't have anybody in
[1:46:44] wheelchairs here but you take your
[1:46:46] situation don't sit here in whatever it
[1:46:49] is that's bugging you anything that's
[1:46:50] been bothering you anything that's
[1:46:51] looming over you holding you back today
[1:46:53] don't sit there and say well this is
[1:46:55] what it is it is what it is
[1:46:57] he's saying don't sit there thinking
[1:46:59] you're hopeless or helpless he says
[1:47:01] you're not don't let that negative
[1:47:03] thought ever pass through or don't let
[1:47:06] it anchor you can't help it from going
[1:47:08] through your mind but don't let it stop
[1:47:11] he says like the old farmer said I can't
[1:47:13] keep the birds from flying over my place
[1:47:15] but he had a double barrel shotgun see I
[1:47:19] can sure keep them from roosting so you
[1:47:21] do the same thing and you too see don't
[1:47:24] let them Roost let them pass right on
[1:47:26] through and brother Brown would say
[1:47:27] right after that he says and we've got a
[1:47:28] double barrel shotgun we've got the Old
[1:47:30] Testament and we've got the New
[1:47:31] Testament we've got the fully revealed
[1:47:33] word he says use that to keep them
[1:47:34] moving on they get uncomfortable when
[1:47:37] you start blasting with the Old
[1:47:38] Testament the New Testament when you
[1:47:40] bring a balanced word approach to the
[1:47:41] situation
[1:47:43] Devils don't like it
[1:47:45] they go for an easier Target amen
[1:47:47] what is it's the full word of God being
[1:47:49] applied
[1:47:51] he'd say this God lets you think on
[1:47:54] things and study about it it's what you
[1:47:56] come to church for
[1:47:59] that's why we're here tonight
[1:48:01] he says if there be any praise if there
[1:48:03] be any virtue think on these things what
[1:48:05] are you thinking about tonight
[1:48:07] maybe I won't get healed I'll go back
[1:48:09] home you'll get what you're thinking
[1:48:11] about have it determined in your heart
[1:48:13] that God will do it and God will do it
[1:48:16] don't pack your sin back home don't pack
[1:48:19] your unbelief don't pack your disease
[1:48:23] church is it just a Wednesday night
[1:48:26] or is it a time to catch the thoughts of
[1:48:27] God
[1:48:29] are we just coming to church or is it a
[1:48:32] place for strength and encouragement
[1:48:34] are we just performing our habit or our
[1:48:37] Christian Duty or are we coming in to
[1:48:39] see God do a work in our lives that's
[1:48:40] what he's saying don't just come in to
[1:48:42] come in come in with purpose come in
[1:48:44] with intent come in and say Lord get a
[1:48:46] hold of my life
[1:48:48] speak into my life reveal to me what
[1:48:51] needs to happen reveal to me what you
[1:48:53] want to do revealing me what's possible
[1:48:55] and then let me step into it amen
[1:48:57] brother bam says don't pack what you
[1:48:59] brought in all the way back home
[1:49:01] leave it here at the altar leave it here
[1:49:04] in your pew
[1:49:06] kick it out
[1:49:07] get it off remember in Pilgrim's
[1:49:09] Progress Christian comes to the cross
[1:49:11] and he's been carrying this burden and
[1:49:13] as he kneels at the cross the burden
[1:49:15] Falls away and it goes down the hill to
[1:49:17] where he can't ever pick it up again lay
[1:49:20] it down is what he's saying
[1:49:21] don't don't don't lay it down to pick it
[1:49:24] up at home later either
[1:49:26] don't teleport your problem to tomorrow
[1:49:28] and say well I'll deal with it tomorrow
[1:49:30] no deal with it here today
[1:49:33] this is where virtue is
[1:49:35] say I've decided the word is going to
[1:49:38] have an effect
[1:49:41] and there'll be a strength that comes
[1:49:42] behind it you'll see amen don't have a
[1:49:44] conversation with symptoms
[1:49:46] don't have a conversation with what it's
[1:49:48] been to date
[1:49:51] say from this day forward
[1:49:54] what did Moses say
[1:49:56] these Egyptians you won't see him after
[1:49:58] today
[1:49:59] you won't see him after tonight
[1:50:02] once God does a work it's done
[1:50:05] it's a finished work amen
[1:50:08] Paul gave an admonition about how we
[1:50:10] think he said this
[1:50:12] he says these things
[1:50:14] which ye have both learned
[1:50:16] and received
[1:50:18] and heard
[1:50:20] and seen in me
[1:50:22] believe
[1:50:25] do
[1:50:27] virtue is in doing
[1:50:30] the application of the word is virtue
[1:50:34] living out the word is virtue he says
[1:50:37] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[1:50:39] what's he saying don't let it stay in
[1:50:40] your mind cleanse your mind let your
[1:50:42] mind think the right things let what's
[1:50:43] in your heart what's really in your
[1:50:45] heart come through don't let just be
[1:50:46] thoughts but put it into action now live
[1:50:48] what you've heard obey what you've heard
[1:50:50] apply it to your life what show
[1:50:52] agreement with your life and then what
[1:50:54] comes behind it he says the God of Peace
[1:50:57] there's a rest there's a settled
[1:51:00] there's a finished work that comes
[1:51:02] behind it amen
[1:51:05] I'm going to close with this quote
[1:51:07] the musicians can come if they want
[1:51:10] he says may we be upright
[1:51:12] honest and true he's praying here
[1:51:14] he says may we be the kind of a
[1:51:16] Christian that would be a credit to any
[1:51:18] community
[1:51:20] Grant it Lord
[1:51:21] may we be women and men such as you
[1:51:24] could lay your hands upon and say my
[1:51:26] servant behold this is my servant in
[1:51:28] whom I am delighted I can send them and
[1:51:31] they'll go they know how to speak and
[1:51:33] when to speak and I can be with them he
[1:51:36] says oh Father grant that blessing to
[1:51:39] every one of us
[1:51:41] amen God bless you let's stand if you
[1:51:43] would
[1:51:45] amen
[1:51:49] I love what he said
[1:51:53] he said don't pack your sin back home
[1:51:56] don't pack your unbelief
[1:51:58] don't pack your disease don't pack your
[1:52:00] problems don't pack your past
[1:52:02] leave it here he says have it determined
[1:52:06] in your heart that God will do it
[1:52:08] and God will do it
[1:52:11] and then virtue starts here
[1:52:14] virtue starts with a conscious decision
[1:52:16] a conscious acceptance of what the word
[1:52:17] has said
[1:52:19] and a belief that it'll have the same
[1:52:21] effect if you'll applied in your life
[1:52:22] amen
[1:52:24] I mean if we just close our eyes each
[1:52:26] one bow our heads
[1:52:29] I want you to reflect
[1:52:35] sometimes
[1:52:37] we're looking for victory and it seems
[1:52:39] like we can't get there
[1:52:42] brother Brown says just lay it down
[1:52:48] look into your life this night
[1:52:51] nobody's looking
[1:52:53] every head's bowed every eyes closed
[1:52:57] you got something you say Lord I've been
[1:52:59] fighting this one way too long
[1:53:01] Lord I've been dealing with this
[1:53:03] this Tormentor
[1:53:06] I've been dealing with this feeling
[1:53:09] I've been dealing with this barrier
[1:53:12] and I'm sick and tired of it
[1:53:16] Lord give me the right thoughts
[1:53:19] give me the right mental attitude
[1:53:22] well give me a word
[1:53:25] that'll give me the antidote to what
[1:53:27] Satan's been trying to do in my life
[1:53:30] hey man let's just bow our heads
[1:53:31] together
[1:53:32] Heavenly Father
[1:53:34] Lord you see your precious children Lord
[1:53:37] hands raised
[1:53:39] Lord and we're coming before you this
[1:53:41] night
[1:53:43] Lord we don't want
[1:53:44] just a church service
[1:53:48] or the mediocre sermon
[1:53:50] we've done our duty
[1:53:53] but Lord what we desire is a Living Word
[1:53:57] a living reality
[1:53:59] Lord of virtue a strength Lord that
[1:54:01] flows out of us
[1:54:03] Lord a life that is cleansed and
[1:54:06] suitable for your use
[1:54:08] Lord you said that we're supposed to be
[1:54:10] a royal priesthood a holy nation of
[1:54:12] peculiar people Lord set aside
[1:54:15] Lord we're supposed to be a city on a
[1:54:17] Hilltop a light on a hill that cannot be
[1:54:19] hidden Lord
[1:54:21] Lord I pray you help us
[1:54:23] Lord let us lay hold of your word
[1:54:26] Lord let us Rise Up by faith each one
[1:54:28] Heavenly Father
[1:54:30] though each one battle we struggle Lord
[1:54:32] we have these little foibles and faults
[1:54:34] and isms and inferiority complexes and
[1:54:37] family issues and even our genetics Lord
[1:54:40] fighting against us Lord but you sent
[1:54:42] your word to heal our every disease Lord
[1:54:45] you've given us Victory Lord through the
[1:54:46] blood and by the power of your Holy
[1:54:48] Spirit
[1:54:49] so Lord I'm praying for each one that's
[1:54:51] raised their their hand Lord that even
[1:54:53] in their hearts Lord have said Lord
[1:54:54] touch me this night Lord may we leave
[1:54:57] every single thing here Lord may you
[1:54:59] strip us of every burden of every issue
[1:55:01] of every flower thing that Satan just
[1:55:05] throws in our face sort of every
[1:55:06] Tormentor that's here Lord may we go
[1:55:09] free tonight by the power of your Holy
[1:55:10] Ghost we pray
[1:55:12] Lord for we ask these things in Jesus

[2:03:56] in Isaiah 66 and 9 he says shall I bring
[2:04:01] to the birth and not cause to bring
[2:04:03] forth saith the Lord shall I cause to
[2:04:06] bring forth and shut the womb saith thy
[2:04:08] God in other words he says shall I cause
[2:04:11] a start
[2:04:12] and not finish
[2:04:14] shall I begin a work and not start it
[2:04:15] shall I make a promise and not go
[2:04:17] through with it
