[21:05] me. My sins they are
[21:10] many. Their stains are so
[21:16] deep. And
[21:18] bit the
[21:20] tears of
[21:23] remorse that I
[21:26] weep. But
[21:29] useless is
[21:31] weeping. Thou great crimson sea man. Thy
[21:39] waters can cleanse me. Thy
[21:44] waters can cleanse me. Thy
[21:50] waters can cleanse me. Come roll over
[21:56] me.
[21:58] My
[22:00] tempers are
[22:03] faithful. My
[22:06] passions are
[22:08] strong. They bind my poor
[22:13] soul and they force me to wrong.
[22:19] [Music]
[22:21] Beneath thy

[22:57] haunted with fears.
[23:01] My
[23:02] life has been
[23:05] joyless and
[23:08] useless for
[23:10] years. I feel something
[23:16] better. Oh,
[23:18] surely would be.
[23:22] If once thy pure
[23:26] waters, if once thy pure
[23:31] waters, If once thy pure
[23:36] waters were roll over me.
[23:44] Ocean of
[23:46] mercy, how
[23:49] longing I've stood, man, on the brink of
[23:55] thy
[23:57] wonderful
[23:59] lifegiving blood.
[24:02] Once
[24:03] more I have reached this soul cleansing
[24:11] sea. I will man
[24:16] back. I will not go
[24:21] back. I will not go back till it rolls
[24:29] over me.
[24:32] The
[24:34] tide is now
[24:37] blowing. I'm
[24:39] touching the
[24:42] wave. I hear the loud call of the

[25:02] be I plunge neath the
[25:07] waters. I plunge neath the
[25:12] waters. I plunge neath the
[25:17] waterers. They roll over
[25:22] me. And now,
[25:27] hallelujah, the rest of my
[25:32] days shall

[25:37] spent in
[25:40] promoting his praise.

[25:45] open his
[25:47] bosom to pour out the
[25:52] sea. Oh
[25:55] boundlessly
[25:56] [Music]
[25:57] salvation,
[26:00] aboundless
[26:02] salvation,
[26:05] aboundless
[26:07] salvation for you and for me.
[26:13] And
[26:14] now,
[26:17] hallelujah, the rest of my
[26:22] days shall
[26:25] gladly be
[26:27] spent in
[26:29] commoting his
[26:32] grace.
[26:34] All his
[26:37] bosom to pour out this sea my glory.
[26:43] Thank you Lord.
[26:47] Salvation. Oh
[26:49] boundless
[26:52] salvation. Oh

[27:08] Amen. Let's sing uh number 226.
[27:18] The love of
[27:23] God is
[27:25] greater
[27:29] far than tongue or pen.
[27:36] can never
[27:40] tell. It goes beyond
[27:45] man. The highest
[27:50] star and reaches
[27:55] to the lowest hell.
[28:01] The guilty
[28:05] pair bowed down with
[28:09] care. God gave his
[28:14] [Music]
[28:15] son to
[28:19] win
[28:21] his child.
[28:25] be
[28:26] [Laughter]
[28:29] reconciled and pardoned
[28:34] from his sin. Thank you Lord.
[28:40] Oh love of
[28:44] God, how rich and
[28:49] pure, how
[28:54] measureless and strong.
[28:59] He shall
[29:01] [Music]
[29:04] forever more endure.
[29:09] The saints stand
[29:13] in
[29:15] just
[29:17] my when ally
[29:20] [Laughter]
[29:22] time shall pass
[29:27] away and earthly
[29:32] thrones and kingoms fall.
[29:37] And men who
[29:41] hear refuse to
[29:45] pray on rocks and hills my
[29:50] grace and mountains call.
[29:56] God's love so
[30:00] sure shall still
[30:04] endure all
[30:10] measureless and
[30:14] strong
[30:15] redeeing
[30:18] grace to Adam's
[30:22] [Music]
[30:23] race the saints
[30:28] standing just on the mountain.
[30:33] Oh love of
[30:37] God, how rich and
[30:42] pure, how
[30:47] measureless and strong.
[30:51] [Music]
[30:52] It shall
[30:56] forever more
[31:00] endure the saints and
[31:06] angels song.
[31:10] stood we
[31:14] within the ocean
[31:19] fair and were the
[31:23] skies of punishment made.
[31:29] Were every
[31:32] stalk on earth a
[31:37] queen and every
[31:41] man a scribe by
[31:46] train to write the
[31:51] love of God
[31:55] above would train me
[32:01] shame
[32:04] dry. Nor could the
[32:09] scroll
[32:13] contain the stretch from
[32:18] sky to sky.
[32:23] Oh love of
[32:27] God, how rich and
[32:32] pure, how
[32:37] measureless and
[32:41] strong. It shall
[32:46] forever more endure.
[32:51] a saint
[32:53] [Music]
[32:55] and just
[32:59] song.
[33:01] Amen. Let's sing
[33:11] 12:23. There are two
[33:16] roads you may take.
[33:22] One by
[33:25] side and one by
[33:30] faith. Take the word of
[33:34] God, not what you
[33:38] see. What you
[33:43] believe is what will be
[33:47] mine. Attach your
[33:51] wings to the wings of
[33:56] faith. You can
[34:00] fly in a higher
[34:05] place. Do not
[34:10] struggle. It's by
[34:14] grace set your way.
[34:18] to the wings of
[34:22] faith. Oh, what's your
[34:27] need? Was your
[34:31] cry? Was your
[34:35] mountain much too high.
[34:40] speak the word of
[34:43] God and by and
[34:48] by they will move your mind. Thank you
[34:52] Lord for you will
[34:57] fly. Set your
[35:00] wings to the wings of
[35:05] faith. You can
[35:08] fly. Oh, thank you Lord.
[35:11] Your
[35:14] place do not
[35:18] struggle. It's by
[35:22] grace. Set your
[35:26] wings to the course again of
[35:29] [Music]
[35:31] faith. Set your
[35:34] wings to the winds of faith.
[35:40] You can
[35:43] fly to a higher
[35:48] place. Do not
[35:51] [Music]
[35:52] struggle. It's by
[35:56] grace. Set your
[35:59] wings, man, to the winds of faith. Let's
[36:04] stand.
[36:06] Watch the
[36:09] eagle in the
[36:13] sky. He does not
[36:17] struggle. He does not
[36:21] strive. For the
[36:25] power that makes him
[36:30] rise is already command. Thank you Lord
[36:35] in the
[36:38] sky. Set your
[36:42] wings to the wings of
[36:47] peace. You can
[36:51] fly to a higher
[36:56] place. Do not struggle.
[37:01] It's by
[37:04] grace. Set your
[37:08] wings to the winds of faith. One more
[37:12] time. Oh, set your
[37:16] wings to the winds of
[37:21] faith. Bless you, brother. Bless you.
[37:30] Do not
[37:32] [Music]
[37:47] tr our
[37:49] hearts before him.
[37:53] Oh heavenly father, oh
[37:55] God, Lord, we give you thanks one more
[37:58] time for being in your presence
[38:00] Lord and we are gathered oh God as your
[38:03] children this evening Lord to worship
[38:06] you. Lord, we acknowledge you, your
[38:08] presence among us, Lord. And Lord God,
[38:11] we feel the atmosphere, Lord God. Lord
[38:15] God, being saturated, Lord God, with the
[38:17] heavenly angels and your presence, Lord
[38:20] God, are so real in our hearts, Lord
[38:23] God, as we come, Lord, we ask for your
[38:25] blessing upon our lives, Lord. Lord
[38:28] Jesus, Lord God, recognizing that by
[38:30] ourself we can do nothing, by oursel we
[38:33] are nothing, Lord.
[38:35] Oh God. But Lord, with humble hearts,
[38:37] Lord God, we Lord, we present our lives
[38:40] before you. We present these bodies,
[38:42] Lord, and all that we know, all that we
[38:45] have, Lord God, we surrender it to you,
[38:47] Lord God, that Lord God, as we ask that
[38:50] you will come, Lord, hallelujah, for
[38:53] except you come, Lord God, it it will
[38:55] not, Lord God, come out in the way that
[38:57] it ought to be said and all, oh God,
[39:00] that ought to be done, Lord. But but
[39:02] Lord God, but if you speak to your
[39:03] people this evening, hallelujah, then
[39:06] surely Lord God, it will be a blessing.
[39:08] And so God, may you come, Lord God, may
[39:11] Lord God, remember the needs, Lord God,
[39:13] all that was presented before you, Lord
[39:15] God. Lord, your promise as you have
[39:18] spoken to us by the voice of Malachi 4
[39:20] that you will come Lord God as El Shadai
[39:23] in this end time the strength giver the
[39:25] breasted God Lord God that we may
[39:28] nurture from your breast Lord God and
[39:31] nurturify ourself into a body change
[39:33] Lord God may you give us strength give
[39:35] us virtual healing Lord God and
[39:38] forgiveness Lord Lord God and may you
[39:40] bless your people thank you Lord God for
[39:42] coming thank you for hearing and
[39:44] answering prayer in Jesus Jesus Christ's
[39:46] name we pray. Let me say amen and amen.
[39:51] Praise the Lord. Ain't God
[39:54] good? Amen. Praise God. I just want to
[39:58] thank the Lord for another time to be
[40:02] standing, you know, at my point of duty.
[40:06] You know, it's a it's a joy for me to
[40:08] stand before the bride of Jesus Christ
[40:10] to to speak the word. You know, last
[40:13] week we started a a topic and um I'd
[40:17] like to um I mean I started it last week
[40:22] and I didn't even know that it was it
[40:25] was real good stuff, you know, I got
[40:27] some good stuff from brother Mark and um
[40:30] man I like this morning I was up until
[40:33] about 4, you know, not because I didn't
[40:35] want to go to my bed, but you know
[40:37] sometime you're eating something and it
[40:39] tastes so good you didn't want to stop.
[40:41] So you just keep on eating, you know,
[40:43] and so, you know, it was real good this
[40:46] morning. And so we like to continue the
[40:48] topic of the conflict between um Michael
[40:51] and and
[40:53] Lucifer. Um this evening, we like to
[40:56] turn our Bibles to the book of
[40:58] Revelation
[41:00] 12. So we're going to read two places
[41:03] before we before we
[41:06] sit. That's Revelation 12 and verse 7.
[41:13] The Bible says
[41:16] here, "And there was war in
[41:19] heaven. Michael on his and his angel
[41:22] fought against the dragon. And the
[41:25] dragon fought and his angel and
[41:28] prevailed not. Neither was their place
[41:31] found anymore in heaven." And the great
[41:34] dragon was cast out, that old serpent
[41:38] called the devil and Satan which
[41:41] deceived the whole world. He was cast
[41:44] out in the into the heart and his angel
[41:48] were cast out with him. We like to also
[41:51] read from Ephesians 6 and verse
[41:58] 12. And it
[42:00] reads, "For we wrestle not against flesh
[42:04] and blood, but against principalities,
[42:07] against powers, against the rulers of
[42:11] the darkness of this world, against
[42:14] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[42:17] You may be seated.
[42:25] over to where we are. And you know, we
[42:28] were pulled into this war because uh by
[42:32] reason of the position that we were in
[42:36] Michael, you know, at the beginning. And
[42:38] so we as the people of God, we stand
[42:41] with Michael and we stand and you know,
[42:45] uh we stand with him in in this battle.
[42:48] And so it was a war, it was a real war
[42:52] that was, you know, that was happening
[42:53] there. And and so, you know, we saw that
[42:57] when he came here, you know, we we see
[42:59] that though we were we are flesh and
[43:01] blood, we were born with with with the
[43:04] natural elements really, but the war
[43:06] that we're fighting is not a natural
[43:09] war. It is a spiritual war. And you
[43:13] know, and so it makes it a little bit
[43:15] more complicated because you're fighting
[43:17] things that you cannot see. You you're
[43:19] not able to relate to them, but they're
[43:21] there and they're affecting our lives in
[43:23] a way that, you know, in in ways that
[43:25] matter. It's beyond our human
[43:27] understanding really. And so, you know,
[43:30] we if we're fighting a an enemy that is
[43:33] so unique, then we have to be equipped,
[43:36] amen, to fight this battle really. And
[43:38] so and so the the the Bible said that
[43:40] the weapons that we use to fight the war
[43:43] is not carnal but they are made mighty
[43:45] to the spirit for putting down of
[43:48] stronghold. Amen. Praise God. And so we
[43:52] want to look and see tonight. We we want
[43:54] to go in stages that we go I I I trust
[43:57] God that I'll not get so excited like
[44:00] last week. I try not to but amen. But um
[44:04] we would like to look on this war to see
[44:06] exactly how it started. And you know we
[44:08] saw that this war was started by
[44:11] Lucifer. You know he believe you know
[44:14] because of the position that he was in
[44:16] in heaven. He believed that the
[44:18] inheritance belongs to him. you know he
[44:22] believed that that you know when God was
[44:24] placing you know positionally you know
[44:27] the inheritance that he should be the
[44:29] person you know you know in other words
[44:31] because he was the a close friend to God
[44:34] you know he believed that all that
[44:36] heaven has to afford belongs to him but
[44:39] it wasn't so church the inheritance
[44:42] belongs to the seed of God and that is
[44:45] very important to us to understand
[44:47] tonight that if you are seed of God the
[44:49] blessing belongs to the seed seed not to
[44:52] angel not to archangel it belongs to the
[44:55] seed of God. Amen. Hallelujah. And we
[44:59] say what blessing is that? You see, you
[45:03] know, we we look at it last week when we
[45:05] look on divine nature on we speak in the
[45:07] context of nature. When we we speak of
[45:10] of of a tree unfolding itself, we see
[45:13] nature unfolding itself. And we saying
[45:16] that in the life source, hallelujah, you
[45:18] know, it has in it all that that it has
[45:21] to be made manifested. And we said that
[45:24] God within himself, he knows all that
[45:26] there is within himself. And so because
[45:29] of his knowledge, he was able to
[45:31] express, you know, all of that really.
[45:34] And so it it is hallelujah. It is the it
[45:37] is divine nature and expression and it
[45:41] is God's creative power. In other word,
[45:43] when God say the word, he didn't just
[45:46] say it openly, but he take the word from
[45:49] himself, the thought from himself and
[45:51] expresses it. And so Lucifer didn't have
[45:54] that. It belongs to the seed of God. Are
[45:58] you there, church? The power of creation
[46:01] belongs to the seed of God. It was not
[46:04] given to Lucifer. And so, you know, and
[46:07] and you know, it was one of the the
[46:09] entry point that he had, you know.
[46:12] Hallelujah. And so the the reality of
[46:14] our journey, the reality of our walk,
[46:16] the reality hallelujah is is of of of
[46:19] the the expression that belongs to the
[46:22] seed. Hallelujah. And so you know and
[46:25] and one thing we we need to establish
[46:27] tonight that Lucifer was and still is a
[46:32] servant. Angels are servants to the
[46:36] bride.
[46:38] Amen. That you you owe them nothing. And
[46:41] if you are in a right position, they
[46:43] would have served you right. But now
[46:46] because you are out of position that you
[46:49] know and they are spiritual beings and
[46:50] you're natural being they make it appear
[46:52] as if you are subjected to them but it's
[46:55] not true. You know but they are
[46:57] subjected to you. You know Lucifer is a
[47:01] servant and you know he could not
[47:03] produce that word. You know last week I
[47:06] was using the analogy when we look at
[47:08] the the triunal state of of our being
[47:10] where we were body spirit and soul by
[47:13] virtue of that by virtue of the way you
[47:16] were born you were born having that
[47:19] nature of God you know and so if you if
[47:22] everything was in its rightful order by
[47:24] virtue of your birth you would have
[47:26] expressed the eternal things of God
[47:29] right and so you know the angel there
[47:32] the there were created beings they had
[47:35] they had spirit and and soul but they
[47:37] they cannot have a body. In other words,
[47:39] there's nowhere possible for them to
[47:42] express unless if there's a medium by
[47:44] which to do so. But God didn't create a
[47:47] body for them. The animal they have body
[47:50] and spirit but they do not have a soul.
[47:52] But we hallelujah but take the image and
[47:55] the likeness of God. We have body,
[47:58] spirit and soul. Hallelujah. Praise. In
[48:01] other words, I'm saying to you church,
[48:03] hallelujah, divine nature, you speaking
[48:06] the word would have been a second
[48:07] nature. It wouldn't be a supernatural
[48:09] act to say it. It would have been a
[48:11] natural hack for you to say the eternal
[48:14] word. It would been it would have been a
[48:16] part of you by h divine
[48:19] providence. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[48:23] Amen. And so the Bible, you know, in
[48:26] Isaiah 14 and verse 12, the Bible said,
[48:29] "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[48:31] Lucifer, son of the morning, how art
[48:34] thou cut down to the ground, which
[48:37] didest weaken the nation, for thou has
[48:40] said in thine heart." And you know, when
[48:42] I when I was going through this,
[48:44] something jumped out at me. You you
[48:46] know, he didn't say it loudly. He had it
[48:49] here. He kept it in his heart.
[48:52] Hallelujah. But the Bible said, "But the
[48:55] word of God is a discerner." Hallelujah.
[48:58] God discern his heart and see exactly
[49:01] what was the intent of his thought.
[49:04] Hallelujah. Praise God. And so the Bible
[49:06] said, "For thou hast said in thy heart,
[49:08] I will ascend into heaven and I will
[49:11] exalt my throne above the stars of God."
[49:14] That's the sons of God. You know, he
[49:16] wanted to exalt himself above,
[49:19] hallelujah, above the stars or the sons
[49:21] of God. And he said, "And I will sit
[49:23] also upon the mount of the
[49:26] congregation in the side of the north. I
[49:29] will ascend above the heights of the
[49:31] cloud. I will be like the most high."
[49:35] No, there's there was a reason why he
[49:38] was making this statement because where
[49:40] they were
[49:41] hallelujah as I dramatize this a little
[49:44] bit where they were as angel of being
[49:47] hallelujah they weren't directly into
[49:49] the presence of God where God was he was
[49:52] high above them so they were able to
[49:55] look up into that dimension and God was
[49:58] looking down so he wanted to go up to
[50:02] where God is because he know that if you
[50:04] go There you are in control. So his
[50:07] intention is that for me to control it,
[50:10] I have to ascend to where God is.
[50:13] Hallelujah. Or to ascend into a
[50:15] position. But church, it's not his
[50:18] position to ascend into. Hallelujah. And
[50:21] so Revelation 12 and verse 7, the Bible
[50:24] said, "And there was war in heaven. And
[50:27] Michael and his angel fought against the
[50:29] dragon. and the dragon fought and his
[50:33] angel. Now listen and you know the
[50:37] reason why I gave that analogy because
[50:39] you see when when when Christ was
[50:42] descending into the realms of the angel
[50:46] the form Hallelujah it takes an a formal
[50:49] which is Michael an angel Michael is
[50:53] Christ hallelujah is it's God in his
[50:57] angelic form so when he stepped down he
[51:00] stepped down as an angel Michael Hal
[51:03] Hallelujah. And he said, "Why did he do
[51:05] that?" You see, that's the power of the
[51:07] creative word. When he need a body, he
[51:11] speak it into existence and walk right
[51:13] into it. Are you there at the church? If
[51:16] he wants to come to earth, all he does
[51:18] is speak a body into existence and walk
[51:20] right into it. Hallelujah. That's the
[51:23] power of the creative creative of the
[51:26] creative world of God. How it gives you
[51:29] the opportunity to express how creation
[51:32] in its creative form. Hallelujah. And so
[51:37] Michael when Christ was represented in
[51:40] heaven. His angelic form is Michael.
[51:44] Michael is Christ. He has hallelujah a
[51:48] form in heaven. And you know we say he's
[51:50] Michael. And so you know we say when he
[51:53] comes to earth he has a form. When he is
[51:56] in heaven, he has a form. Brother Vam
[51:59] said in the message question and answer
[52:02] preach 19 of 59. Brother Adam said, see
[52:06] Satan was was the original archangel of
[52:10] God. He said he once dwell in the
[52:13] heaven. He once was the greatest person
[52:17] in heaven outside of God. What a
[52:21] position. What a position. And he
[52:24] believed that because he had this that
[52:28] everything else should follow behind
[52:29] that. You know, you know you are the
[52:32] boss. In other words, when when Michael
[52:33] was not there, who run
[52:35] it? Hallelujah. And so you believe.
[52:38] Hallelujah. But everything else should
[52:40] have followed behind that. Hallelujah.
[52:43] Brother said outside of God, he said he
[52:47] was the greatest person in heaven
[52:49] outside of God. He was God's right hand
[52:53] man to fellowship and he got puffed up
[52:56] in his
[52:57] heart. Hallelujah. And so it's not for
[53:03] angel to ascend. It is for sunship. The
[53:07] position of inheritance belongs to you.
[53:12] You got to tell yourself that. But it's
[53:14] my blessing. It's my inheritance.
[53:18] Hallelujah. What give you that? By
[53:20] reason of your birth. Hallelujah. You
[53:23] were born. Hallelujah. To inherit it.
[53:27] Because of your position as a son of
[53:29] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the
[53:32] position is but to sunship. And sunship
[53:36] bear the divine nature of their father.
[53:40] Sunship have the divine creative power
[53:43] of God word. And by faith he could speak
[53:46] the eternal word from the mind
[53:49] hallelujah of God into
[53:51] existence. Hallelujah. Praise
[53:54] God.
[53:55] Amen. Hallelujah. But here this one he
[53:59] said in his heart hallelujah that though
[54:04] he said in his heart I will ascend into
[54:06] the heaven. I will exalt my throne above
[54:09] the stars of God. I will sit upon the
[54:12] mount of the congregation in the side of
[54:15] the north. I will ascend above the
[54:17] heights of the cloud. I will be like the
[54:20] most high God. Hallelujah. He wanted to
[54:24] elevate
[54:25] himself. Hallelu into position that was
[54:28] neither his, neither by birth nor by
[54:31] inheritance. But church, let me tell you
[54:34] this evening, but the bride, the seed
[54:37] has the birthight to the inheritance.
[54:40] It's yours by by birthright. Hallelujah.
[54:44] That God had has given it to you, not to
[54:48] angels. Hallelujah. Praise God. I'm
[54:51] trying to show you what caused the
[54:53] war. An angel want something that was
[54:57] not his.
[54:59] He wanted something that belongs to you
[55:02] and he will do anything to get it.
[55:05] Hallelujah. Praise God. Even if it mean
[55:08] pull down heaven. Hallelujah. Tear the
[55:11] assemble of the angel and of heaven in
[55:14] order to to take the position.
[55:17] Hallelujah. But where did he find
[55:18] himself? He found himself on the
[55:22] outside. Hallelujah. Praise God. So
[55:26] better said in the message.
[55:29] Hallelujah. Uh
[55:31] uh question and answer
[55:35] uh preached 19 59. He said, "Now, as I
[55:39] just got to basing up this that Lucifer
[55:43] in heaven tried to exalt himself and Eva
[55:48] be just a little higher than his boss.
[55:51] And he betrayed
[55:53] Michael and made himself a great kingdom
[55:57] in the side of the north and came down
[56:00] and said, "Now, and he and his angel was
[56:03] cast out."
[56:06] Hallelujah. In the message Christ the
[56:09] mystery of God
[56:12] reveal oh preach 1963 paragraph
[56:17] 543 said notice Lucifer in the last days
[56:23] is doing as he did at
[56:25] first. What did Lucifer do? The first
[56:28] thing that Lucifer done uh done to
[56:31] separate the fellowship of God and man.
[56:34] He wanted to build him a united kingdom,
[56:38] a great splendor, and seemingly more
[56:41] cultured, a greater kingdom than Michael
[56:45] Christ had. He said, "You got
[56:48] it." He said, "Now, now if you missed
[56:52] it, just hold up your hands and I'll say
[56:55] it again." He said Lucifer at the
[56:58] beginning his purpose in his heart was
[57:00] to achieve a brighter a greater thing in
[57:04] heaven than Christ had. He said is that
[57:07] right by seemingly a more cultured more
[57:11] beautiful more splendor than the kingdom
[57:13] of Christ. He said do you think we'll
[57:17] have automobile in the
[57:19] millennium? Do you think we'll have a
[57:21] plane in the millennium?
[57:24] But he wanted this. Hallelujah. He
[57:28] wanted to build something. Hallelujah.
[57:30] But listen church. But all that he does
[57:33] it comes to not. You know when I speak
[57:36] in this context I remember Peter
[57:40] speaking of Hallelujah. All that comes
[57:43] outside of the word. Peter said the
[57:46] grass witherth the flower fadeth. In
[57:49] other word, hallelujah, by his wisdom,
[57:51] he could create it, but it will not
[57:54] last. Only thing that lasts is the word
[57:57] of God that stands
[58:01] forever. Hallelujah. And so, let us look
[58:03] at his
[58:04] characteristics. Some of the things that
[58:06] he he possess, why he had that mindset.
[58:10] Hallelujah. I want to tear it apart a
[58:12] little bit. Let you see exactly the
[58:14] person that you're dealing
[58:15] with. Hallelujah.
[58:18] In the book of Ezekiel 28 and and verse
[58:22] three, the Bible said, "But thou art
[58:25] wiser than Daniel, there's no secret
[58:28] that is can there's no
[58:31] secret that they can hide from thee.
[58:35] With thy wisdom, hallelujah, and with
[58:38] thy understanding, thou has gotten thee
[58:40] riches, and has gotten gold and silver
[58:44] into thy treasure. By thy great wisdom,
[58:47] and by thy t
[58:49] ter has thou increased thy riches, and
[58:53] thy heart is lifted up because of thy
[58:55] riches. Therefore, thus said the Lord,
[58:58] because thou a certain heart as a heart
[59:01] of God. Listen church, he was a very
[59:04] wise angel. You can imagine all these
[59:08] years standing there watching God
[59:10] unfolding all the creation. He absorbed
[59:13] all that knowledge. He sees it. Are you
[59:16] there? And he believed that listen, I am
[59:19] equipped. I am qualified and I can take
[59:22] on the job. Hallelujah. And so he was
[59:25] deceived by one concept. Hello. Which
[59:28] was this wisdom. He was driven into
[59:31] believing by wisdom.
[59:34] Hallelujah. We look also uh in Ezekiel
[59:37] 28 and verse 13.
[59:42] The Bible said, "Thou has been in the
[59:45] heathen, the garden of God. Every
[59:48] precious stone was was thy covering. The
[59:51] sardis, the tass, the diamond, the
[59:54] barrel, the onyx, the jasper, the
[59:57] sapphire, the emerald, the carbon and
[1:00:01] gold, the workmanship of thy tibra. And
[1:00:05] all thy pipe was prepared in thee in the
[1:00:08] day, hallelujah, that thou was created."
[1:00:11] You know, when I when I read this, it
[1:00:14] reminds me, hallelujah, why the Bible
[1:00:16] call him Lucifer, the son of the
[1:00:19] morning. Because if you see him, if you
[1:00:22] are there in heaven, and I'm taking you
[1:00:24] a trip to heaven, of course. Go with me
[1:00:26] a little bit. If you are there to see
[1:00:28] him, he stands out above all the other
[1:00:32] angels. Why? Because, hallelujah, he had
[1:00:36] 10
[1:00:37] lights reflecting from him. You know,
[1:00:40] it's like the Bible speak of the 12
[1:00:42] stones or the 12 light that was on the
[1:00:45] breastplate of of of of Heron and the
[1:00:48] urine venim that represents hallelujah
[1:00:52] the 12 tribe of Israel according to the
[1:00:54] covenant. But he didn't have hal Lucifer
[1:00:58] God did not give him the 12 light. God
[1:01:00] gave him 10 out of it.
[1:01:03] And so when you see him, I wish I could
[1:01:06] demonstrate. When he's coming forth, you
[1:01:09] see light protruding from him.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah. All the radiance.
[1:01:13] Hallelujah. And he looked real
[1:01:17] good. Are you church? He stands out
[1:01:21] differently from all the other
[1:01:23] angels. He was an angel of light.
[1:01:27] Hallelujah. Praise God. And because of
[1:01:29] his position, he believed. Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] But the the inheritance belongs to
[1:01:35] him.
[1:01:37] Hallelujah.
[1:01:39] Amen.
[1:01:41] Amen. So that was what he was. He was
[1:01:45] the right hand man of God. Lucifer. He
[1:01:49] was the Bible call him the light bearer
[1:01:52] or shining one or as sometime called the
[1:01:56] morning star. But later when he fell his
[1:01:59] name was changed to Satan. Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] After his rebellion against
[1:02:05] God in verse 28, verse 14, the Bible
[1:02:09] said, "And thou art the anointed cherub
[1:02:11] that coverth, and I have set thee so
[1:02:15] that thou was up on the holy mountain of
[1:02:18] God. Thou have walked up and down in the
[1:02:21] midst of the stones of fire, and thou
[1:02:25] was perfect in thy ways." Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] from the day thou was created till
[1:02:30] iniquity was found in thee. Hallelujah.
[1:02:34] Praise God. He was the anoint. In other
[1:02:37] word, he has an anointing upon him. And
[1:02:41] we're going to get in the anointing a
[1:02:42] little bit. Hallelujah. The Bible say he
[1:02:44] was the anointed term that coverth.
[1:02:47] Hallelujah. Praise God. And he was so he
[1:02:50] was created perfect until iniquity was
[1:02:53] found in his heart. What was that
[1:02:56] iniquity? He knows, hallelujah. Knowing
[1:02:59] the thing was wrong and still do it
[1:03:02] anyhow. Hallelujah. He caused a
[1:03:05] rebellion in heaven and he knew it was
[1:03:08] wrong but he did it
[1:03:10] anyhow. Hallelujah. And so iniquity was
[1:03:14] found in him. Hallelujah. Now I'd like
[1:03:18] to uh for us to turn our Bibles to
[1:03:22] Ezekiel 31.
[1:03:25] I have a very long read so you just bear
[1:03:28] with
[1:03:28] me
[1:03:30] now. Hallelujah. Ezekiel 31 and we start
[1:03:34] at verse
[1:03:35] one. And this in my mind it gave a real
[1:03:39] holistic understanding of the this
[1:03:41] creature that we're dealing with. But
[1:03:43] the Bible types him in in you know as
[1:03:46] not just a person but the
[1:03:48] anointing. Hallelujah. And so it
[1:03:50] referred that anointing to the the the
[1:03:53] the king of of of of of Pharaoh, the
[1:03:56] king of Egypt. And so the Bible said,
[1:03:59] "And it came to pass in the 11th year,
[1:04:02] in the third month, in the first day of
[1:04:04] the of the month, that the word of the
[1:04:06] Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
[1:04:09] speak unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt,
[1:04:11] and to his multitude, whom thou who art
[1:04:14] thou like in thy greatness? Behold, the
[1:04:17] Assyrians was a cedar in Lebanon with
[1:04:21] fair branches with a shadowing shroud
[1:04:24] and of an eye structure. And his stop
[1:04:27] was among the tip bra. The waters made
[1:04:31] him great. The deep set him up and high
[1:04:35] with a river running about his plant and
[1:04:40] sent out his little rivers unto all the
[1:04:43] trees of the field. Therefore, its
[1:04:46] height was exalted above the trees of
[1:04:49] the field, and its brawl w were
[1:04:53] multiplied, and its branches became
[1:04:55] long, because of the multitude of waters
[1:04:58] which he when he shot forth. All the fo
[1:05:03] of heaven made their nest into his gro,
[1:05:07] and under his branches did all the
[1:05:10] beasts of the field bring forth their
[1:05:13] young. and under his shadow dwell all
[1:05:17] great nation. Thus was he fair in his
[1:05:22] greatness. In his length of branches,
[1:05:25] for his root was by great waters. The
[1:05:29] cedars in the garden of God could not
[1:05:32] hide him. The fur tree were not like its
[1:05:36] br and the chest tree was not like unto
[1:05:40] its branches, nor any tree in the garden
[1:05:43] of God was like unto him in its beauty.
[1:05:47] I have made him fair by the multitude of
[1:05:50] his branches, so that all the trees of
[1:05:53] Eden that were in the garden of God
[1:05:56] envied him. Therefore, thus say the Lord
[1:05:59] God, because thou hast lifted up thyself
[1:06:02] in height, and he has shoot up among the
[1:06:07] thick,
[1:06:10] Hallelujah, among the thick bra, and his
[1:06:14] heart is lifted up in his eye. I have
[1:06:18] therefore delivered him into the hands
[1:06:20] of the mighty one to the of the heathen.
[1:06:23] He shall surely deal with him. I have
[1:06:26] driven him out uh for his
[1:06:28] wickedness. And stranger, the terrible
[1:06:32] of the nation have cut him off, and have
[1:06:35] left him upon the mountain, and all the
[1:06:38] valley of the branches are fallen. And
[1:06:41] his braw are broken by all the rivers of
[1:06:44] the of the land. And all the people of
[1:06:47] the hurt are gone down from his shadow,
[1:06:50] and have left him upon his ruin. And
[1:06:54] shall all the f of the heaven remain,
[1:06:57] and all the beasts of the field shall be
[1:06:59] upon its
[1:07:01] branches, to the end that none of all
[1:07:05] the trees by the water exalt themselves
[1:07:09] for their height, neither shoot up the
[1:07:12] top among the tip braw, neither their
[1:07:15] trees stand up in their height, all that
[1:07:18] drinkketh water, for they are all
[1:07:21] delivered unto death. to the neither
[1:07:24] part of the hurt in the midst of the
[1:07:27] children of men with them that go down
[1:07:30] to the pit. Thus said the Lord God, in
[1:07:33] the day when he went forth to go to to
[1:07:37] the to the to the grave, I cause a
[1:07:39] mourning. I cover the deep for him and I
[1:07:42] restrained the flood thereof and the
[1:07:45] great waters were stayed and I ced
[1:07:48] Lebanon to mourn for him and all the
[1:07:51] trees of the field a faint for him. I
[1:07:54] made the nation to shake at the sounding
[1:07:57] of his fall when I cast him down to hell
[1:08:01] with them that descend into the pit. And
[1:08:04] all the trees of Eden, the choice and
[1:08:07] best of Lebanon, and all the drinkkeeth
[1:08:09] water shall be comforted in the nether
[1:08:12] part of the earth. Verse 17 it says,
[1:08:16] "And all they all they also went down
[1:08:19] into into hell with him into unto them
[1:08:24] that be slain with the sword, and they
[1:08:27] that were is harm that dwelleth upon his
[1:08:31] shadow in the midst of the heathen."
[1:08:33] Verse 18. To whom are thou thus like in
[1:08:37] glory and in in greatness among the
[1:08:40] trees of Eden? Ye shall thou be brought
[1:08:43] down with the tree of heeden unto the
[1:08:46] neither part of the hurt. Thou shalt be
[1:08:49] lie in the midst of the
[1:08:52] uncircumcised with them that be slain by
[1:08:55] the sword. This is Pharaoh and all the
[1:08:58] multitude say the Lord God. Amen. Praise
[1:09:02] God. Thank you for listening. This was
[1:09:04] very long. But it speaks to this
[1:09:07] devil. Hallelu. Oh, he was distinct
[1:09:11] above all the
[1:09:13] trees. Hal by position that he he had.
[1:09:17] But you know what? But he wanted to to
[1:09:19] extend himself. Hallelujah. To the side
[1:09:23] of the north. He wanted to be like the
[1:09:26] most high. But God said, but instead of
[1:09:28] God take him up, God put him down. He
[1:09:32] was sent to the pit. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:09:35] God. Amen. He was demoted out of
[1:09:38] position.
[1:09:39] Really? Hallelujah. And so when he when
[1:09:44] he was kicked out of
[1:09:45] heaven, he was brought to earth. He was
[1:09:48] he he he descended to hurt. Hallelujah.
[1:09:51] And the Bible said in Revelation 12 and
[1:09:54] verse 9, the Bible said, "And the great
[1:09:56] dragon was cast out, that old serpent
[1:10:00] called the devil." Hallelujah. Praise
[1:10:03] God. He was cast out. But where did he
[1:10:06] go? You see, church, hallelujah, he was
[1:10:09] a spirit. And a spirit, hallelujah, need
[1:10:12] a body. It needs something to express
[1:10:15] itself. Hallelujah. But listen and so
[1:10:18] when he was there and he was there in
[1:10:21] the garden of God but he was like a
[1:10:24] statue you know every time I think about
[1:10:26] I and imagine he was just there every
[1:10:29] day like this nothing to do why because
[1:10:34] hallelujah the son of God was under
[1:10:37] divine leadership by the by the divine
[1:10:40] nature of God the son of God had the
[1:10:43] word Adam was living by the word of God
[1:10:46] and So God was living in a vessel and
[1:10:49] Satan didn't have a power to create a
[1:10:51] vessel for himself. And so he was there,
[1:10:54] hallelujah, powerless in a spiritual
[1:10:57] form. Hallelujah. Are you there with me,
[1:11:00] church? Hallelujah. Amen. But what did
[1:11:04] he do? Hallelujah. I'm taking it down
[1:11:07] that you see exactly. So we take him out
[1:11:09] of heaven. We bring him to earth. And
[1:11:11] here is he on hurt but powerless. But
[1:11:14] what did he do? He needed a vessel.
[1:11:17] Hallelujah. And there was none that he
[1:11:20] couldn't inhabit. So what did he do?
[1:11:22] Hallelujah. He went to a vessel that was
[1:11:25] the the closest to the human race which
[1:11:28] was the serpent. And what that spirit
[1:11:31] did? Hallelujah. What was happened?
[1:11:34] Because he started something in Genesis
[1:11:37] that he keep on doing for all the time
[1:11:39] for 6,000 years. He came to the serpent
[1:11:43] and he anoint the serpent. The serpent
[1:11:46] bears the anointing of the hallelujah of
[1:11:50] the dragon. And so when he was when that
[1:11:52] serpent was anointed here what the Bible
[1:11:55] said in Genesis 3 and verse one. Now the
[1:11:59] serpent
[1:12:01] hallelujah hallelujah. The serpent was
[1:12:05] more subtle than any beast of the field,
[1:12:09] which the Lord God has made. Hallelujah.
[1:12:12] And he said unto the woman, "No, it
[1:12:14] seems like it was a casual normal
[1:12:18] conversation, but it was a conversation
[1:12:21] that he was under an
[1:12:24] anointing." Listen, church, but serpent
[1:12:27] had that conversation with Hea all the
[1:12:29] time. But this morning, this particular
[1:12:32] time, he was anointed by a
[1:12:35] devil. Because what Satan want, he
[1:12:38] wanted a channel. Remember, he did not
[1:12:41] have the power of creation. He could not
[1:12:44] produce a seed. And so the conversation
[1:12:48] was was with the intent, h to get the
[1:12:52] human race, Hallelujah, to get into it
[1:12:55] by what? By a
[1:12:57] seed. Hallelujah. Why did he need a
[1:13:00] seal? Because if he could get a sealed,
[1:13:03] hallelujah, then he could populate that
[1:13:06] anointing. Hallelujah. He want that
[1:13:08] anointing to have a voice. It didn't
[1:13:11] have one. But if he Hallelujah, if he
[1:13:13] could anoint something, which he did, he
[1:13:16] anointed an
[1:13:17] animal. Hallelujah. And so when the
[1:13:20] animal, the serpent was having the
[1:13:23] conversation with
[1:13:25] heave, he said, "Hallelujah. Now the
[1:13:29] serpent was more subtle than the beast
[1:13:32] of the
[1:13:33] field which the Lord God has made. And
[1:13:37] he said unto the woman, "Yeah, had God
[1:13:40] said, he shall not eat of the trees of
[1:13:43] the garden?"
[1:13:46] And the woman said unto the serpent, "We
[1:13:48] may eat of the fruit of the tree of the
[1:13:51] garden, that of the fruit of the tree in
[1:13:54] the midst of the garden, God said, he
[1:13:57] shall not eat of it, neither shall he
[1:13:59] touch it, lest he die." And the serpent
[1:14:02] said unto the woman, "He shall
[1:14:06] not," three letters, "He shall not
[1:14:10] surely die." What did he do? Hallelujah.
[1:14:15] He injected a word, a seed to thought in
[1:14:19] her head. She never thought about that,
[1:14:22] church. Hallelujah. I'm trying to show
[1:14:24] you. But when the anointing, that
[1:14:26] Lucifer anointing comes, he comes to
[1:14:28] inject thought. The battle is in your
[1:14:31] thought. He wants you to think about it.
[1:14:34] But church, if God said it, that's
[1:14:36] secular, don't think about it. It's
[1:14:38] God's perfect
[1:14:40] word. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:14:45] Hallelujah. But of the fruit of the tree
[1:14:47] in the midst of the garden, God said, if
[1:14:50] he shall he shall not eat of it, neither
[1:14:54] shall he touch it, lest he die. And the
[1:14:56] serpent said unto the woman, he shall
[1:14:59] not surely die. For God know that in the
[1:15:02] day he eat thereof. Hallelujah. Then
[1:15:05] your eyes shall be open, and he shall be
[1:15:09] as God's, knowing good and evil.
[1:15:12] Hallelujah. We go down to verse verse uh
[1:15:16] verse
[1:15:18] 12. Hallelujah. And the Bible
[1:15:21] said, "And the and and the man and the
[1:15:25] woman whom thou gavest uh this was Adam
[1:15:28] speaking. The man said, the woman that
[1:15:30] thou gavest to me to be with me, she
[1:15:34] gave me off the tree, and I did eat."
[1:15:37] And the Lord God said unto the woman,
[1:15:40] "What is this thou hast done?" And the
[1:15:43] woman said, "The serpent beguiled me,
[1:15:46] and I did heat." And the Lord God said
[1:15:48] unto the serpent, because thou has done
[1:15:51] this, thou art cursed above all the
[1:15:53] cattle, above every beast of the field,
[1:15:56] upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust
[1:16:00] thou shalt heat all the days of thy
[1:16:02] life. And I will put emity between thee,
[1:16:06] hallelujah, and the woman, between thy
[1:16:09] seed and her seed, and it shall bruise
[1:16:12] thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
[1:16:15] heel. Hallelujah, church. What did that
[1:16:18] angel achieve? Hallelujah. It did not
[1:16:20] have the power of creation, but he was
[1:16:23] able to exercise his wisdom by
[1:16:25] deception. And by that deception, he was
[1:16:28] able to plant a seed. Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] something a vessel that he can manifest
[1:16:34] his work. In other word what I'm saying
[1:16:36] church hallelujah he want to bring the
[1:16:38] battle here but he could not bring it
[1:16:40] here because there was no vessel but now
[1:16:43] that he has a vessel the battle move
[1:16:45] from out of heaven and it comes right
[1:16:47] down here because what we are seeing now
[1:16:50] church coming out of Genesis are two
[1:16:53] vines hallelujah two seed coming out
[1:16:56] hallelujah one that belongs to Michael
[1:16:59] and one that belong to the
[1:17:01] serpent hallelujah praise God. Verse
[1:17:05] two, anointing. Hallelujah. Now in in
[1:17:08] Genesis, it was Cain and Hel. Now it
[1:17:12] comes forward. So we are watching the
[1:17:14] trail of the seed. We're able to follow
[1:17:17] the seed of the serpent and be able to
[1:17:20] see it by the anointing. Hallelujah
[1:17:22] church. But Antichrist anointing,
[1:17:25] hallelujah, has been
[1:17:27] here. Hallelujah. Anointing, anointing,
[1:17:30] anointing. And we saw it comes and it
[1:17:34] anoint it seal. You said go did Satan is
[1:17:38] Satan a father? Yes he is. He begotten
[1:17:42] children not in the way that God would
[1:17:44] have wanted it but by his wisdom he was
[1:17:47] able to do
[1:17:49] that. And so we saw the seed the two
[1:17:53] vines coming forth. Hallelujah. Cain and
[1:17:57] Haber and they're moving forward and
[1:18:00] they're going all the way down through
[1:18:02] history. We're seeing Isaac and Ishmael.
[1:18:06] Hallelujah. We're seeing Jacob and Esau.
[1:18:09] We're seeing Jesus and Judas.
[1:18:12] Hallelujah. We're seeing Christ and the
[1:18:14] Antichrist is it's coming all the way
[1:18:17] down. Hello. To where we are today.
[1:18:20] Hello. The trail of the seal.
[1:18:23] Hallelujah. Amen. And so that's why
[1:18:26] church, we have this war. Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] Paul said, "Hello, we are battling not
[1:18:33] with flesh and blood, but we are
[1:18:35] fighting church that anointing. We are
[1:18:38] fighting that anointing. Hello. And it's
[1:18:41] set forth, church, to do what? It's set
[1:18:43] forth to go against the Christ seed.
[1:18:46] It's coming against you." Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] You and I, church. Hallelujah. It's
[1:18:50] designated to come against you and I.
[1:18:55] Hallelujah. So listen, we're fighting
[1:18:58] the same battle. We're fighting the same
[1:19:01] war that started in heaven. Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] Between Michael and Lucifer. We're
[1:19:08] fighting the exact same battle.
[1:19:12] Hallelujah. And so here what we're
[1:19:15] looking at, what we are seeing is
[1:19:17] Lucifer and Michael again. Hallelujah.
[1:19:20] Church, which side are you on? It
[1:19:23] depends. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:19:25] which on and whether or not the word of
[1:19:27] God is being revealed to you in this day
[1:19:30] because the seed of God gets the
[1:19:32] revelation by faith. The seed of God get
[1:19:36] the promise by faith. And the Bible
[1:19:38] said, hallelujah, the judge shall live
[1:19:40] by faith. You will live by the revealed
[1:19:43] word of the hour in the day in which
[1:19:45] you're living
[1:19:46] in. Lucifer and Michael again once
[1:19:49] again. Hallelu. And it's Christ. So what
[1:19:53] we're seeing church hallelujah is
[1:19:55] Lucifer and his
[1:19:57] family. It's a wow. Hallelujah. And what
[1:20:01] we are seeing is Michael and his
[1:20:04] family. Hallelujah. Praise God. The two
[1:20:07] seed. Hallelujah. So we are seeing them
[1:20:11] separated.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. We're looking at the two
[1:20:15] anointing coming down. Hallelujah. The
[1:20:18] anointing Christ. Hallelujah. and that
[1:20:23] antichrist. Amen. Anointing. So let's
[1:20:26] let us zone in a little bit because now
[1:20:29] you see we look on him in heaven as an
[1:20:32] angel. But we are now looking on him in
[1:20:35] his earthly manifestation as an
[1:20:38] anointing. Hallelujah. Because that's
[1:20:41] what he does. He comes in and he
[1:20:44] anoints. And so in the revelation 12 and
[1:20:47] verse one, hallelujah. You know, we're
[1:20:50] taking him back, you know, 2,000 years
[1:20:52] ago. Revelation 12 and verse one, the
[1:20:55] Bible said, "And there, and there appear
[1:20:58] a great wonder in
[1:21:00] heaven, a woman clothed with with the
[1:21:03] sun, and the moon under her feet, and
[1:21:07] upon her head a crown of 12 star, and
[1:21:11] she being with child cried, travail in
[1:21:15] birth, and pain to be delivered." And
[1:21:18] there appear another wonder in heaven.
[1:21:21] And behold, a great red dragon having
[1:21:24] seven head and 10 arms and seven crowns
[1:21:28] upon its head. And it tail drew the
[1:21:31] third part of the stars of heaven and
[1:21:34] did cast them to the earth. And the
[1:21:37] dragon stood before the woman which was
[1:21:39] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[1:21:43] child as soon as it was born. and she
[1:21:47] brought forth a manchild who was to rule
[1:21:51] or nation with a rod of iron. And her
[1:21:54] child was caught up unto God.
[1:21:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Unto his throne.
[1:22:00] Hallelujah. And so, church, what we're
[1:22:02] seeing, hallelujah, for those of us who
[1:22:04] are taking notes, you know the Bible
[1:22:06] speak in Revelation 13 of the first
[1:22:09] beast. Now the beast, hallelujah,
[1:22:12] hallelujah, was that anointing, halle
[1:22:14] that was working at the time of that
[1:22:17] dispensation when Herod the king,
[1:22:20] hallelujah, was there, he was, he was a
[1:22:22] king of of Rome. And so when he heard,
[1:22:26] hallelujah, of the Christ seed that was
[1:22:29] born, what he did, he wanted to kill it.
[1:22:33] Hallelujah. When the when then the when
[1:22:35] when the wise men go to him and said,
[1:22:37] "Hallelujah, we have seen a star. We
[1:22:40] know that the king was born. Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] We see we know that the Christ child is
[1:22:46] here." What did he do? He said, "You go
[1:22:48] out and if you find him, send bad news."
[1:22:52] Hallelujah. That we may go and worship
[1:22:54] him just the same. But what was the
[1:22:56] intent? The intent, church, hallelujah,
[1:22:59] was to kill that Christ
[1:23:01] child. Hallelujah. And so what we saw,
[1:23:05] hallelujah, was under that first
[1:23:07] revelation 13:1, the first beast,
[1:23:11] Hallelujah, when Rome was anointed, when
[1:23:14] Herod was anointed by that anointed,
[1:23:18] Hallelujah, by by that by that anointing
[1:23:21] of Lucifer. The anointing was set forth
[1:23:25] to destroy
[1:23:27] Christ. It was set forth to destroy
[1:23:29] Christ. Are you there with me, church?
[1:23:32] Hallelujah. Praise God. And so pagan
[1:23:35] Rome, hallelujah. It was Rome by their
[1:23:39] paganism. Hallelujah. It wasn't because
[1:23:41] they were converted, but they were
[1:23:44] pagan. And under that pagan ship,
[1:23:47] hallelujah. What did what they want to
[1:23:49] do? They wanted to kill Christ with
[1:23:51] what? With a physical
[1:23:53] sword. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. But
[1:23:57] God delivered. Hallelujah. The Christ
[1:24:00] child, what am I saying? The Rome,
[1:24:04] hallelujah, having that anointing, pagan
[1:24:07] Rome, hallelujah, have that anointing to
[1:24:10] do what it set forth to destroy
[1:24:14] physically. Hallelujah. Satan was
[1:24:18] working through the Rome to kill that
[1:24:20] Christ trial being anointed by the same
[1:24:23] devil anointing coming after Christ
[1:24:26] tried to kill it with with a physical
[1:24:29] sword. But listen church. Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] And and I probably just slow down a
[1:24:33] little bit because I want you to catch
[1:24:35] this. It was a physical sword.
[1:24:38] Hallelujah. It wasn't a spiritual sword.
[1:24:41] It was a physical sword that he was
[1:24:44] sending forth. Hallelujah. By a physical
[1:24:47] system, but that system was anointed by
[1:24:51] the
[1:24:53] devil. Hallelujah. And so the anointing
[1:24:58] was up and wrong. Which anointing? That
[1:25:01] same anointing that was in heaven,
[1:25:03] hallelujah, came to earth and it found
[1:25:06] vessels, sealed children to manifest.
[1:25:09] And that an anointing set forth to
[1:25:12] destroy the seed of God. Hallelujah.
[1:25:15] Amen. And so pagan Rome rose up.
[1:25:19] Hallelujah. To do that. But remember
[1:25:22] now, hallelujah. Revelation 13 and verse
[1:25:26] three, the Bible said, "And I saw one of
[1:25:28] one of his head as it were wounded to
[1:25:31] death, and his deadly wound was healed,
[1:25:34] and all the world wander after the
[1:25:37] beast." Now, what was happening in
[1:25:39] Revelation 3, Revelation 13 and verse
[1:25:42] three? Hallelujah. Now that pagan Rome
[1:25:45] system, Hallelujah. Praise God. It was
[1:25:49] dismantled. It was in shambles. Hallelu.
[1:25:52] And so the power that was once there in
[1:25:55] operation could not, Hallelujah. be
[1:25:58] effective. And so what that devil does,
[1:26:01] it move away from pagan Rome. Rome with
[1:26:05] its political power and political
[1:26:07] influence to paple Rome. Are you there
[1:26:10] in the church? Hallelujah. But with what
[1:26:13] I'm saying to you, it is the same devil
[1:26:15] all the
[1:26:17] time. Hallelujah. It just simply changes
[1:26:21] position from just a physical power to a
[1:26:25] spiritual
[1:26:27] power. Hallelujah. To paple Rome.
[1:26:32] Hallelujah. Now when that system came on
[1:26:35] board, Hallelujah.
[1:26:38] AD3:25. Hallelujah. when hallelujah they
[1:26:41] wanted to establish who was Christ and
[1:26:44] they said that he was not God.
[1:26:46] Hallelujah. But it came out that he was
[1:26:49] like substance. Hallelujah. In other
[1:26:51] word and so what they did hallelujah the
[1:26:54] the the political power and the
[1:26:57] religious power came together and anoint
[1:26:59] a man called the pope. Hallelujah. And
[1:27:03] that pope become the vic of Christ. In
[1:27:06] other word, he become instead of up the
[1:27:08] Holy Ghost. He become the voice of God
[1:27:10] to the people. Whatever he says is law.
[1:27:14] Are you there me church? Hallelujah. But
[1:27:17] let me tell you church that he was
[1:27:19] anointed by the same Lucifer spirit.
[1:27:22] Hallelujah. And it has one position
[1:27:24] church. It has one objective and that is
[1:27:28] to get you and I to get the seed of God.
[1:27:33] Amen.
[1:27:35] Oh
[1:27:36] my. Oh, forgive me. I'm getting get a
[1:27:40] bit too excited
[1:27:42] here. Hallelujah. That great
[1:27:46] of
[1:27:48] Revelation, Papa Rome, Hallelujah, was
[1:27:52] risen up with the same anointing. So the
[1:27:55] same anointing that was on Herod is on
[1:28:00] that hand, that war, that church that is
[1:28:04] anointed
[1:28:05] Hallelujah. Halle And she was anointed
[1:28:08] to do what? To destroy Christ.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah. And it already shown what
[1:28:13] Era tried to do. So we know what the
[1:28:17] nature of the dragon is. There's
[1:28:20] anointing. Hallelujah. That's why church
[1:28:22] in this day you got to watch it because
[1:28:24] there's so much anointing out there. And
[1:28:27] these anointings are religious.
[1:28:29] Hallelujah. They take they're so close
[1:28:32] Hallelujah. the original. The Bible said
[1:28:34] it would have deceived the very elect.
[1:28:37] Hallelujah. But how the elect cannot be
[1:28:40] deceived. Why? Because the elect doesn't
[1:28:42] judge it by the anointing. The elect
[1:28:45] judge it by the word. Are you there in
[1:28:47] the church? If it's not God's word,
[1:28:49] listen. It got to run. Hallelu not to
[1:28:52] Genesis and stop. But it got to go from
[1:28:54] Genesis all the way to
[1:28:56] Revelation. It got to be perfect.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah. according to the scripture
[1:29:01] and it cannot break the scripture at any
[1:29:04] point. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:29:08] God. So we know that the nature of the
[1:29:12] dragon. Hallelujah. And there's an
[1:29:15] anointing to bring to pass what must be
[1:29:19] brought to pass. Of course, we say that
[1:29:21] the anointing on Herod was a natural
[1:29:25] sword to kill the children. But this
[1:29:28] anointing on the church is a spiritual
[1:29:31] sword. And what is it doing church? The
[1:29:35] sword of the word, what it is doing. It
[1:29:38] is
[1:29:39] twisting. It is twisting the word in the
[1:29:42] word. Hallelujah. Satan knows exactly
[1:29:45] what he's doing. You see, church, in
[1:29:48] this war, if I can take from you your
[1:29:51] identity, if I can make you feel as if
[1:29:53] you cannot overcome, if I can pressure
[1:29:56] you to believe uh that all you're
[1:29:57] praying for, all you're seeking for that
[1:30:00] this God that you're trusting in is not
[1:30:02] hearing you, I can keep you into a
[1:30:05] position. Are you there, my me, church?
[1:30:06] Uh but what is he doing? Uh he attacks
[1:30:09] the word. Uh he attacks the word.
[1:30:11] Because if you can get the word then you
[1:30:13] can step forth with your identity
[1:30:15] believing what God say about you. What
[1:30:18] he says about he said you're more than
[1:30:21] conqueror. He said you are hallelujah.
[1:30:23] You're his children and he said he has
[1:30:25] chosen you in himself before the
[1:30:28] foundation of the
[1:30:29] world.
[1:30:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what he's
[1:30:35] doing, he has a
[1:30:37] sword. He's twisting by tradition. He's
[1:30:40] taking out pieces. He's not taking all
[1:30:43] of the church, but bits and pieces out
[1:30:45] of it. Hallelujah. He's putting in stuff
[1:30:48] and he's taking out stuff. Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] And what is he doing by doing that? Uh
[1:30:53] he's making the word of God has none
[1:30:55] effect. Uh because the spirit of God
[1:30:57] only operate by the word of God.
[1:31:00] And if the word is not perfect, then the
[1:31:02] spirit of God cannot operate. Uh are you
[1:31:04] there with me church? Uh and so that
[1:31:06] anointing when it came to kill with the
[1:31:09] sword, it moved the teaching of the
[1:31:11] apostles and replaced it with the
[1:31:14] tradition of men. Uh are you there
[1:31:16] church? And when it does that, it drove
[1:31:18] the Holy Spirit out of the church.
[1:31:21] Hallelujah. Praise
[1:31:24] God.
[1:31:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:28] making the word of
[1:31:29] God of none effect and that is death.
[1:31:34] Listen church, you talk about crucifying
[1:31:38] Christ aresh if you take the word out
[1:31:41] but what you're doing church you're
[1:31:43] crucifying Christ. Are you there the
[1:31:45] church? Hallelujah. And so that what
[1:31:48] they're doing church how they're nailing
[1:31:50] him to the cross. They're killing his
[1:31:52] influence upon the people. And what
[1:31:55] you're seeing, you know, it's always
[1:31:56] something Mark when I when you go into a
[1:31:58] Catholic church where you see you see
[1:32:00] vestries of pictures and images and
[1:32:02] cross. Hallelujah. And what they're
[1:32:04] doing with all of those they say a
[1:32:06] picture say a thousand words because
[1:32:08] when you look upon it and you see it
[1:32:10] hallelujah for too long you begin
[1:32:12] believe that it is real. It's not real.
[1:32:14] It's an image. Hallelujah. Is something
[1:32:17] to catch your attention in your thought
[1:32:19] in something else. Uh but I tell the
[1:32:21] church keep your mind of the word of
[1:32:23] God. Keep your mind stayed on him. Stay
[1:32:26] on the word. Stay in the position. Stay
[1:32:28] on the promises of
[1:32:30] God.
[1:32:32] Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:32:36] Amen. Oh my. We're getting there.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. So, Revelation. So, we
[1:32:44] saw the pagan Rome died under its
[1:32:49] physical Hallelujah. sword and and and
[1:32:52] that's physical anointing. The anointing
[1:32:55] move into the church. And so we saw a
[1:32:58] woman, a church rising up with the same
[1:33:03] anointing. And when she started,
[1:33:06] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. We
[1:33:08] saw her in Revelation 17. Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] Revelation 17 and verse three. And the
[1:33:14] Bible said, "And so and verse three, we
[1:33:16] saw it in verse three. And so he carried
[1:33:19] me away in the spirit into the
[1:33:21] wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting up
[1:33:24] upon a scarlet color beast full of eyes
[1:33:27] of blasphemy having seven head and 10
[1:33:30] horns. And a woman was array in purple
[1:33:34] scarlet colored and decked with gold and
[1:33:36] precious stone and pearls and having a
[1:33:40] golden cup in her hand full of
[1:33:42] abomination and filthiness of her
[1:33:45] fornication. And upon her forehead was a
[1:33:48] name written mother mystery Babylon the
[1:33:52] great the the mother of harlot and
[1:33:56] abominations of the hurt. And I saw the
[1:33:59] woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:34:01] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:34:04] of Jesus. And when I saw her I wonder
[1:34:08] with great
[1:34:09] admiration. Oh church. It was the same
[1:34:12] system. Hallelujah. that that went after
[1:34:16] Christ. Hallelujah. Now she's anointed.
[1:34:19] And what she's doing, she's going after
[1:34:21] the apostles. She's going after the
[1:34:23] believers. Why? Because, hallelujah,
[1:34:26] because all that does not agree with her
[1:34:28] and her teaching. All that doesn't
[1:34:31] accept this Romanism teaching, you know
[1:34:34] what she does with them? She kill them.
[1:34:36] She force them to. She burn them. She
[1:34:38] trap them. She feed them to lions. Are
[1:34:41] you there, church? Hallelujah. That's
[1:34:43] the position that she take against the
[1:34:45] seed of
[1:34:47] God. And don't think that we're going to
[1:34:49] escape her. There got to be a time that
[1:34:51] this bride have to confront one way or
[1:34:53] the
[1:34:54] other. We're not confronting a church,
[1:34:57] but we are confronting an anointing that
[1:35:00] is set forth. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah. And the angel said unto me,
[1:35:07] "Wherefore did thou marvel? I will tell
[1:35:10] thee of the mystery of the woman, and of
[1:35:12] the beast that carried her, which had
[1:35:16] the seven head, and 10 arms,
[1:35:19] uh, the beast that thou size was and is
[1:35:22] not, and shall ascend out of the
[1:35:23] bottomless pit, and go into predition.
[1:35:27] And they that dwell on the herd shall
[1:35:29] wonder whose names are not written in
[1:35:32] the book of the of life from the
[1:35:34] foundation of the world when they the
[1:35:37] behold the beast that was and is not and
[1:35:40] yet is. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:35:44] And so this church hallelujah this woman
[1:35:48] that was riding on this scarlet colored
[1:35:51] beast h it was pouting empowering her.
[1:35:55] She was being anointed. And so when we
[1:35:58] saw this church, hallelujah, you say
[1:36:00] Satan doesn't have miracle. Yes, he has
[1:36:02] miracle. He will call fire from heaven.
[1:36:05] He will do he will raise. He will heal
[1:36:09] the sick and all these things. Hello. He
[1:36:11] has that. But church, the bride is not
[1:36:14] drawn into Hallelujah. Is that drawn
[1:36:17] into spiritualism. Hello. But the bride
[1:36:20] must see the word and the bride must
[1:36:23] obey the word. But she's anointed with
[1:36:26] all of these spiritual happenings. Are
[1:36:29] you getting me? There's a power that is
[1:36:31] behind her. And she
[1:36:34] start 2,000 years ago. And so we pick up
[1:36:38] on that trail, a ride, riding that
[1:36:42] beast, that anointing. She's riding it.
[1:36:45] And we pick up on that riding in
[1:36:47] Revelation chapter 6 under the seals.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. when we saw her coming
[1:36:53] forth. Hallelujah. And the Bible said in
[1:36:56] verse revelation 6 and verse two, "And I
[1:36:59] saw and be all a white horse." That's
[1:37:02] innocency. She comes in innocent,
[1:37:05] religious, looking real
[1:37:08] good, looking like something you want to
[1:37:10] be a part of with all that
[1:37:13] administration. Hallelujah. But what was
[1:37:16] it? There was a beast. Hallelujah. That
[1:37:19] was carrying it. Hallelujah. But now
[1:37:22] church, hallelujah. It was so much that
[1:37:25] that hand of this. Hallelujah. That the
[1:37:28] Bible didn't mention of her, but the
[1:37:31] Bible said, "But he that was upon it."
[1:37:34] And we thought that it was her. But it
[1:37:36] was him. Oh, church. Hallelujah. What
[1:37:40] was Satan doing? He was guising himself
[1:37:42] in the church. He was taking a form that
[1:37:45] when you look, you see people, you see
[1:37:48] men and and dressing all of this.
[1:37:50] But what it was, it was the power of the
[1:37:53] devil. Oh
[1:37:55] my. It was
[1:37:58] Satan. Hallelujah. Starting his trail
[1:38:03] religiously. And watch him. Starting at
[1:38:06] as a white horse rider, moving through
[1:38:09] the system. He was riding innocently.
[1:38:13] Starts quite well. Hallelujah. Behold, a
[1:38:16] white horse. And he that sat upon him
[1:38:19] and a bow. Hallelujah. And a a crown was
[1:38:23] upon upon him. And he was set forth to
[1:38:26] do what? To
[1:38:28] conquer. A set for conquering and to
[1:38:31] conquer. What was he doing church?
[1:38:34] Hallelujah. Praise God. But when I'm
[1:38:37] speak about this under the church age,
[1:38:39] he said that that nicolating demon,
[1:38:41] that's nicolating spirit. It said forth.
[1:38:44] He said the word nic mean to conquer and
[1:38:48] lady mean the people. Hallelujah. That
[1:38:50] that spirit was set forth to conquer the
[1:38:53] lady. Are you there with me church? It
[1:38:55] was set forth. Hallelujah. The Bible
[1:38:58] said that he had a bow but had a but he
[1:39:01] had no arrow but what was it? He was a
[1:39:07] impersonator. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:39:10] But he takes hallelujah that religious
[1:39:12] form. And so when he started in the
[1:39:15] church, hallelujah, it was little isim
[1:39:17] and schism and and the different thing
[1:39:19] that was coming up. It wasn't the full
[1:39:22] power. Hallelu are you there me church?
[1:39:25] But watch as it moves as it rides.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah. Verse three. And when he had
[1:39:31] opened the second seal, I saw the second
[1:39:34] beast and he said, "Come and see."
[1:39:36] Hallelujah. bride, what are you looking
[1:39:39] at? Are you seeing that beast? Are you
[1:39:41] seeing it straight? He said, come and
[1:39:43] see. And so there went forth another
[1:39:45] horse. Hallelujah. That was red. And
[1:39:48] power was given unto him that sat there
[1:39:51] on to take peace from the earth.
[1:39:54] Hallelujah. That they should kill one
[1:39:56] another. And there was given unto him a
[1:39:59] great sword. In other words, church, it
[1:40:02] didn't have a sword before. But now,
[1:40:04] hallelujah. What started as a deed
[1:40:07] becomes a doctrine. In other word, what
[1:40:09] I'm saying, hallelujah, nicolatism that
[1:40:12] came into the church discreetly under
[1:40:14] the anointing, it become the standard.
[1:40:17] Hallelujah. By which the people are
[1:40:20] judged. And if you do not accept the
[1:40:22] standard, there's a sword that will
[1:40:25] catch
[1:40:26] you. Oh
[1:40:29] my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:40:33] And when he opened the third seal, I
[1:40:36] heard the third beast said, "Come and
[1:40:37] see." And behold, and a black ars, and
[1:40:40] he that sat upon him had a pair of
[1:40:42] balance in his hand. And I heard a voice
[1:40:45] in the midst of the four beasts, say, "A
[1:40:48] measure of wheat for a penny, and three
[1:40:50] measure of valley for a penny, and see
[1:40:53] thou not earth, the oil, and the wine."
[1:40:56] And when he had opened the fourth seal,
[1:40:58] I heard the voice of the fourth beast
[1:41:01] say, "Come.
[1:41:03] and see. And I look, and behold, a pale
[1:41:08] horse, and his name that son upon him
[1:41:11] was dead, and hell followed with him.
[1:41:14] And power was given unto them over the
[1:41:17] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:41:19] the sword, and with hunger, and with
[1:41:22] death. Hallelujah. And with the beast of
[1:41:25] the hurt. Hallelujah. Oh church, can you
[1:41:28] see? This is the age that we're living
[1:41:30] in. the age. Hallelujah. Under the dead
[1:41:34] rider church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:37] You see when he started, he started in
[1:41:39] the name of the church. Hallelujah. But
[1:41:42] under the fourth seal, the Bible reveal
[1:41:44] his name. We know what his name is now.
[1:41:47] His name is death. And the Bible said,
[1:41:50] "And anywhere that angel is, anywhere
[1:41:53] that infest is hell follow."
[1:41:57] Hallelujah. Church, what am I saying? No
[1:42:00] wonder the time is so dark. No wonder
[1:42:03] the healing shadows are failing because
[1:42:05] debt is everywhere. Hallelujah. Debt is
[1:42:08] in the school. Debt is in the home. Debt
[1:42:11] is in the church. Why? Because of that
[1:42:13] influence of that demon, that Satan
[1:42:16] anointing that get inducted into
[1:42:19] it. She's under an
[1:42:22] influence. Hallelujah. That produces
[1:42:25] death. And listen where death is.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah. L follow behind that.
[1:42:33] Hallelujah. So we said there comes papal
[1:42:37] Rome riding with her power the power of
[1:42:41] the
[1:42:42] antichrist. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[1:42:46] we said the mechanical the mechanics.
[1:42:48] Hallelujah. So listen. And so when it
[1:42:51] started it started in Europe.
[1:42:54] Hallelujah. It's established itself and
[1:42:57] it's enforced itself by law in in
[1:43:00] Europe. And so all that did not agree
[1:43:03] with it. Hallelujah. It it went against
[1:43:06] them. And what did it do church?
[1:43:08] Hallelujah. Listen, not everybody
[1:43:10] accepted it. Not everybody agreed with
[1:43:13] that that anointing. There were people
[1:43:15] there who never had embraced it. But
[1:43:18] what did that church do? Hallelujah. It
[1:43:20] it slaughtered them. Hallelujah. because
[1:43:23] uh to reject
[1:43:24] Catholism to accept Protestantism and
[1:43:27] what Protestantism was it was protesting
[1:43:30] uh the teaching of the Catholic and
[1:43:33] because they protest the teaching of the
[1:43:36] Catholic what what it brought.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah. It brought forth church
[1:43:40] hallelujah 68 million Protestant that
[1:43:44] are killed because they said no to her.
[1:43:49] two Christians who said no to her, they
[1:43:52] were
[1:43:53] killed. Hallelujah. So the European
[1:43:57] Union Ha enforced it. She was under law.
[1:44:02] Hallelujah. In other word, there was no
[1:44:05] criminal hal application to to her
[1:44:09] action. If you don't believe, you're
[1:44:12] dead. That's a measuring stick. Do we
[1:44:15] embraced it? No. That's it. Hallelujah.
[1:44:20] Praise God. And so she slaughtered 68
[1:44:25] million.
[1:44:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we saw that
[1:44:30] same anointing rising up Papa Rome was
[1:44:35] covering all over, you know, it was
[1:44:38] covering for the last 300 years.
[1:44:41] Hallelujah. because the law of the land,
[1:44:44] you know, gave her that that power, that
[1:44:46] that will. And she does she did all of
[1:44:48] that. Hallelujah. She had the law in her
[1:44:51] hand and she killed the 68 million and
[1:44:54] they were true believers. Hallelujah.
[1:44:58] And she put them to death
[1:45:00] who she crucified. She crucified the
[1:45:03] manifested word in the day in which hal
[1:45:06] it came forth unheard. But I'm trying to
[1:45:09] show you church quickly as we go. We're
[1:45:11] coming to an end quickly. I want to show
[1:45:13] you exactly what the intent of this of
[1:45:16] this war. Listen, it's not a picnic.
[1:45:19] It's not a jaw ride, church. Listen.
[1:45:22] Hallelujah. Something I want to show
[1:45:24] you. You know, I'm talking about Mark,
[1:45:26] you know, he gave me something and man,
[1:45:27] it I didn't see this. Hallelujah. But
[1:45:30] listen, we saw that spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] And so in Europe, they they recognize
[1:45:37] they could not fight that system.
[1:45:39] Protestantism could not survive there.
[1:45:42] And so what it did, it moved from Europe
[1:45:45] and it travels to the west for what?
[1:45:47] Hallelujah. Because they wanted a safe
[1:45:50] house. They want somewhere that they
[1:45:52] could have freedom of religion. Are you
[1:45:55] there, church? They want religious
[1:45:57] freedom and they could not get that in
[1:46:00] Europe because of
[1:46:03] capitalism. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:46:07] hallelujah. And so we saw the first
[1:46:10] beast which was a political Rome and the
[1:46:14] Herod. We saw hallelujah that that that
[1:46:18] beast coming forth and changing.
[1:46:21] Hallelujah. But now we are going now
[1:46:23] into that second beast. Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] Which now speak to America. You know I I
[1:46:30] think I better say it. You know, because
[1:46:32] now with the appointment of of of a a
[1:46:36] new pope into the Americans, you got to
[1:46:39] know why and what Brother Bottom says
[1:46:42] about that, right?
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. So, the second beast in
[1:46:47] Revelation 13 there. Revelation 13 11.
[1:46:51] And I beheld another beast coming out of
[1:46:54] the hurt. Hallelujah. And he had two
[1:46:58] horns like a lamb and spoke like a
[1:47:01] dragon. Hallelujah. Now this is the
[1:47:03] second beast that was coming out of the
[1:47:05] earth. Now listen, this was America.
[1:47:09] Remember now how the American dream or
[1:47:11] it was started. It was started upon the
[1:47:13] base of
[1:47:15] Protestantism. Hallelujah. They were
[1:47:17] protesting the teaching of the
[1:47:19] Catholics. Hallelujah. And so they said
[1:47:22] what happened in Europe under that
[1:47:24] killing it said it will never happen
[1:47:27] again. Hallelujah. And so the America
[1:47:30] was established upon freedom.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. And so when we saw that
[1:47:36] beast, watch what I'm saying. The Bible
[1:47:39] said, hallelujah. It had two arms.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah. Like a lamb. That's America
[1:47:45] starting under Protestantism. Real godly
[1:47:49] nation.
[1:47:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It
[1:47:55] started as a lamb having arms like a
[1:47:58] lamb or he the hand of it. The Bible
[1:48:02] said she speak like a
[1:48:05] dragon. Which dragon? The same dragon
[1:48:09] that she run away
[1:48:11] from. Oh
[1:48:13] my.
[1:48:14] Hallelujah. She end up speaking like a
[1:48:17] dragon. That same spirit that was upon
[1:48:19] the first beast, hallelujah, is now
[1:48:23] revived. Hallelujah. The two arms are
[1:48:27] two powers. Hallelujah. One speak to the
[1:48:30] civil power. Hallelujah. The state and
[1:48:34] authority, the federal authorities and
[1:48:36] and so forth. And the other speak of the
[1:48:40] ecclesiastic. Hallelujah. Which is the
[1:48:42] religious power. Hallelujah. under under
[1:48:46] the west under
[1:48:47] Protestanism. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:48:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what was the
[1:48:55] church? It was Protestantism fleing from
[1:48:58] Europe to get out from under the
[1:49:01] pressure of the Roman church and they
[1:49:04] came over here to find freedom of
[1:49:06] religion. Therefore, when it had
[1:49:09] therefore it was a little lamb with the
[1:49:11] two powers the church wanted to remain
[1:49:14] free from capitalism and she wanted to
[1:49:18] stay with the word the political world
[1:49:21] hallelujah wanted to remain free from
[1:49:24] capitalism. So she lined up with their
[1:49:27] laws according. So both powers stood
[1:49:30] together. Hallelu. And then two
[1:49:33] Hallelujah. 200 years after look what
[1:49:37] happened. 200 years after brother John
[1:49:40] look what happened to
[1:49:42] her. Hallelujah. Oh my. Brother Benham
[1:49:46] said I quote brother Benam. They're
[1:49:48] coming down quickly. Brother said in the
[1:49:53] message, hallelujah, a testimony of the
[1:49:57] sea, he said, "If God's willing, I'm
[1:50:02] giving a trying now of
[1:50:05] evangelism." We know that the re revival
[1:50:08] is over. He said, "Everyone knows that.
[1:50:12] I predict that back then in 56, he said
[1:50:16] it would start ending." He said, "Billy
[1:50:19] Graham, come back and Tommy Osborne and
[1:50:25] them." I said, I said, "This is it.
[1:50:29] America will receive. I reject it this
[1:50:33] year." And they rejected it and we are
[1:50:37] nothing waiting but judgment. He said,
[1:50:40] "But you mark that down and see if
[1:50:43] brother Brandham is right or not." He
[1:50:45] said that's thus said the Lord.
[1:50:48] Hallelujah. We're heading for it. We are
[1:50:50] going to pay what we have done. We have
[1:50:54] got too much glamour in the church and
[1:50:56] Allwood and everything. God is sick and
[1:50:59] tired of it. And the last one will come
[1:51:02] after a while and say and that will be
[1:51:05] it. Hallelujah. Church of the living
[1:51:08] God. Hallelujah. How can someone tell
[1:51:12] me? Hallelujah. that a church that
[1:51:15] rebelled against a system. Hallelujah.
[1:51:18] Now form a conglomeration of churches.
[1:51:21] Hallelujah. Where now who's sitting at
[1:51:24] the head of that conglomeration is Rome.
[1:51:28] And to the point, Hallelujah. She now
[1:51:30] become the voice. Hallelujah. Speaking
[1:51:33] of the second beast, America anointing,
[1:51:37] hallelujah, embracing a
[1:51:39] pope. Hallelujah. What are they getting
[1:51:42] ready for? Hallelujah. A revival of the
[1:51:46] beast. Oh my. Hallelujah. Oh my. Let us
[1:51:51] read it. Let us read it quickly.
[1:51:53] Revelation 13. Hallelujah. I didn't have
[1:51:56] my note, but it just came to my thought
[1:51:58] that I should read it. Revelation 13 and
[1:52:01] verse
[1:52:03] 11. And and I beheld another beast
[1:52:06] coming out of the the hurt. and he had
[1:52:09] two arms like a lamb and he spake like a
[1:52:12] dragon. This was like 2,000 years after
[1:52:15] 200 two 200 years after rather and he
[1:52:19] exercised all the power of the first
[1:52:22] beast. What am I saying church? But this
[1:52:26] beast had a
[1:52:28] disappointment. Hel is Rome
[1:52:31] again. Rome have one intent. Hallelujah.
[1:52:35] The intent is all that does not agree
[1:52:37] with her. She's coming after them.
[1:52:41] Church, little churches like this will
[1:52:44] not survive her because either you
[1:52:47] accept or you
[1:52:49] die. Hallelujah. And so churches,
[1:52:52] places,
[1:52:53] believers will be placed under
[1:52:57] pressure. Why? Because now the dragon is
[1:53:01] speaking again. The anointing that was
[1:53:04] in Europe, the anointing that was in
[1:53:07] heaven is coming after you and
[1:53:11] I. And it has one position is to kill
[1:53:14] with a
[1:53:16] sword. They want us to accept the
[1:53:19] teaching. Hallelujah. And if you accept
[1:53:22] the teaching of catalism, hallelujah, is
[1:53:25] accept the mark of the beast. You're
[1:53:27] doomed. But you know what, church? But
[1:53:30] this bride, I'm closing now. I had it
[1:53:33] long enough. Amen. I'm closing now.
[1:53:38] And so brother Bam said under the feast
[1:53:40] of
[1:53:41] trumpet paragraph
[1:53:44] 207 he said while this great group is he
[1:53:47] said while this group down here got
[1:53:51] 2,000 he 2,000 bound in the river
[1:53:55] Euphrates he said is meaning
[1:53:59] 200,000 he said had been bound for 2,000
[1:54:03] years he said also the church has bound
[1:54:07] B the Holy Ghost for no nearly 2,000
[1:54:10] years. He said under Hermatum back there
[1:54:13] and under the church ages it has been
[1:54:16] bound. He said not of the river
[1:54:18] Euphrates but that the church door of
[1:54:21] creeds and dogmas. He said that the Holy
[1:54:24] Spirit can't work in the church because
[1:54:27] of the man-made system. But he said but
[1:54:30] she's going to be he said but she is
[1:54:32] going to be liberated. Come on church.
[1:54:36] We are going to be liberated.
[1:54:38] Hallelujah. But said, but this church is
[1:54:42] going to be liberated. She's coming
[1:54:44] back. He said that's what the Bible
[1:54:46] said. Those two, Hallelujah. will meet
[1:54:49] again. It said once another, it said
[1:54:52] those two will meet one another on the
[1:54:55] battleground. Lucifer, Michael again
[1:54:58] like it did in the beginning. It said
[1:55:00] they have got bound for 2,000 years.
[1:55:03] almost uh almost 2,000 years. But he
[1:55:06] said what was loose, hallelujah, from
[1:55:09] the Euphrates two 200 millions demon.
[1:55:13] They're coming after the bride church
[1:55:15] are coming after you and I under the
[1:55:18] Hallelujah. Know your understanding why
[1:55:20] there had to be a pope from the west.
[1:55:23] Hallelujah. Why? Because the churches,
[1:55:26] the Protestantism that came from her,
[1:55:29] she sent to saying to them, "Come back
[1:55:32] home to mama." Hallelujah. The Bible
[1:55:34] said she's a war with daughters and her
[1:55:38] daughters are Protestanism and she's
[1:55:40] bringing back everything back to
[1:55:42] herself. What about you and I if we
[1:55:45] don't agree? Oh my God. Hallelujah. But
[1:55:48] what is it church? demons from the
[1:55:51] pitfer that was laid in the river
[1:55:54] Euphrates. They're waiting their time
[1:55:57] because they know church that there's a
[1:55:59] bride in the land. There's a people that
[1:56:02] Hallelujah who have heard the voice of
[1:56:05] God. A people who have received thus
[1:56:07] said the Lord. A people who have
[1:56:09] received an entire message. A people who
[1:56:13] have the revealed word of God for the
[1:56:16] hour. Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] and see. Hallelujah. She's rising up
[1:56:24] because the people who have heard the
[1:56:26] word of God. Hallelujah. And those
[1:56:30] demons that are in the river Euphrates,
[1:56:33] they're coming at you, church. They're
[1:56:35] coming in sickness. They're coming in
[1:56:37] your families. They're coming in your
[1:56:39] school. They're coming in your dream
[1:56:41] church. This demonic power, they're
[1:56:44] coming from everywhere. Are you there at
[1:56:46] the church? political demons, religious
[1:56:49] demons. They're coming church with one
[1:56:52] intent. Hallelujah. To make the word of
[1:56:54] God of none effect. But what church,
[1:56:58] hallelujah, but let me tell you this
[1:57:00] evening, you stood with Michael back
[1:57:02] then. Hallelujah. Until the Bible said
[1:57:05] in this day, hello. Michael your prince
[1:57:09] is going to descend. Oh, can I tell
[1:57:12] somebody this evening that Michael your
[1:57:14] prince uh Revelation 10:1 has descended
[1:57:18] to do what church? To match that devil,
[1:57:21] to fight that devil on the battlefield.
[1:57:23] Hello. We are not alone, but we have
[1:57:25] Michael on our side.
[1:57:28] Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] He has given you the word to overcome.
[1:57:34] Hallelujah. And the Bible said in
[1:57:37] closing
[1:57:38] brother in closing, hallelujah, what is
[1:57:42] what has he done? He has given us the
[1:57:44] word thus said the Lord that cannot
[1:57:48] fail. God has given us the word to
[1:57:50] overcome. And the Bible said, "And they
[1:57:53] shall overcome him by the blood of the
[1:57:56] lamb and the word of your testimony."
[1:57:59] Church, when God called you, he called
[1:58:01] you as an overcomer. Are you there,
[1:58:04] church? And Michael, your prince is
[1:58:06] here. He's fighting your battles for
[1:58:08] you. Hallelujah. He's here to match
[1:58:13] Lucifer. Hallelujah. Amen. Michael
[1:58:17] Christ is standing in his bride to meet
[1:58:20] the challenge because Lucifer has been
[1:58:23] loose and Christ has been loosed.
[1:58:26] Church, the powers of heaven has been
[1:58:28] loosed upon the bride. You're not
[1:58:30] powerless. You're not a chicken.
[1:58:33] Hallelujah. You're not a defeated bride,
[1:58:36] but you have the word. Brother Adam
[1:58:38] said, what started Hallelujah? What
[1:58:41] started in its infancy, the power of the
[1:58:44] resurrection that started in it in its
[1:58:46] infancy, brother said, hallelujah. In
[1:58:49] instances, brother John, you see little
[1:58:51] bits of it like sister Justin the other
[1:58:54] day, she came up and she had a hair
[1:58:56] problem. Hallelujah. She came and
[1:58:58] Michael her prince came and meet her at
[1:59:00] the altar. And what Michael did, he gave
[1:59:03] her a foretaste of the resurrection. Are
[1:59:06] you there me church? Life sign is in her
[1:59:09] again. She recognized that he is here
[1:59:13] and he is here to do what? To bring
[1:59:15] forth resurrection sign. Oh church,
[1:59:18] you're marked. Hallelujah. With
[1:59:20] resurrection power.
[1:59:24] Power of the Holy
[1:59:26] Ghost. Resurrection power. Sign of life
[1:59:30] is coming again and we are seeing it
[1:59:32] little by little. What is it church?
[1:59:35] Michael your prince is matching the
[1:59:38] occasion. Fighting your battles for you.
[1:59:42] God bless you tonight. I didn't meant I
[1:59:45] got excited about
[1:59:49] you.
[1:59:50] But you're not
[1:59:53] alone. Hallelujah.
[1:59:55] The reason why God sent a prophet is
[1:59:58] that God wanted you to know by the word
[2:00:01] what he's doing that you're not left in
[2:00:04] the dark. Hallelujah. I said when you
[2:00:06] get the word and he come to the sea, you
[2:00:09] know exactly what God is going to do. Or
[2:00:10] you know by the scripture. God bless you
[2:00:13] this even. God bless
[2:00:19] you.
[2:00:25] Then I'll
[2:00:28] stand. Let's sing. Um, how great is our
[2:00:42] God? Just start with the first verse.
[2:00:47] The
[2:00:48] splender of a

[2:01:03] rejoice. All the earth
[2:01:08] rejoice. He wraps
[2:01:11] himself in life.
[2:01:16] The darkness tries to
[2:01:20] hide and trembles at his
[2:01:24] voice. Trembles at his
[2:01:29] voice. How
[2:01:31] great is our
[2:01:34] God. Sing with me. How

[2:03:30] above all
[2:03:33] names. You are worthy of our
[2:03:40] praise. Oh my heart will
[2:03:44] sing. How
[2:03:47] great is our
[2:03:51] God. How
[2:03:53] great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How
[2:04:00] great is our
[2:04:03] God? And all will see how
[2:04:08] great how
[2:04:11] great is our God.
[2:04:14] [Music]
[2:04:19] The splender of a
[2:04:25] king clothed in
[2:04:30] majesty. Let all the earth
[2:04:34] rejoice. All the earth
[2:04:39] rejoice. He wraps
[2:04:42] himself in
[2:04:44] life. Thank you, Lord. And darkness has
[2:04:49] to
[2:04:51] hide and trembles at his voice. It
[2:04:56] trembles at his
[2:04:59] voice. How
[2:05:02] great is our
[2:05:05] God. Sing with me. How
[2:05:09] great is our God.
[2:05:13] And all will see how
[2:05:17] great, how
[2:05:19] great is our
[2:05:28] God. Age to age he
[2:05:34] stands. And time is in his hand.
[2:05:41] Beginning and the
[2:05:43] end. Beginning and the
[2:05:48] end. The bride in Christ, my glory.
[2:05:55] Hallelujah. Unite in time, man.
[2:06:01] Glory. Soon we're going
[2:06:04] home. Soon we're
[2:06:06] going home.
[2:06:10] How
[2:06:12] great is our
[2:06:15] God. Sing with me. How
[2:06:19] great is our
[2:06:21] God. And all will see how
