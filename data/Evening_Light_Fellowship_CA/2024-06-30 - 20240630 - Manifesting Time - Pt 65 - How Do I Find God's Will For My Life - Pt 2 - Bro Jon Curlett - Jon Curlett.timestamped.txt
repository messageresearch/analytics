[44:08] invite God on the scene for our meetings
[44:10] this weekend amen God bless you each one
[44:13] Jeremiah 2129 let's start in verse 11 I
[44:16] only have 13 up there but just in the
[44:18] study let's start in verse 11 it's a
[44:20] very familiar scripture he says for I
[44:22] know the thoughts that I think toward
[44:24] you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace
[44:27] not of evil to give you an expected end
[44:30] then shall you call upon me and you
[44:32] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[44:35] hearken unto you and ye shall seek me
[44:38] and find me when you shall search for me
[44:41] with all your heart amen God bless you
[44:43] you can have your seats this morning and
[44:45] we're taking a second series and as far
[44:47] as I know the last series on this
[44:48] thought of of how do I find the Lord's
[44:52] will for my life the clicker is not not
[44:54] connecting there for some reason amen
[44:56] how do I find God's will for my life and
[44:57] we spent last service really uh going
[45:00] through the big picture and we spoke
[45:02] about how the the big picture of God's
[45:03] will is to bring us into a place of
[45:05] spiritual maturity Amen to bring us to a
[45:07] place of adoption he wants to bring us
[45:09] to a place where he can trust us where
[45:11] he can use us where he can flow through
[45:13] us for his glory and for his purpose
[45:15] amen it's not to put us into something
[45:17] great but it's to reveal Christ in this
[45:19] age amen God was revealed in Christ and
[45:21] Christ is being revealed in his bride
[45:23] and there's a a great mystery revealing
[45:25] that's happening in that and it's a
[45:26] process of time it doesn't just happen
[45:28] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[45:29] that's the finish of it is in a moment
[45:31] in the twinkling of an eye but it's a
[45:33] process of time amen and last time we
[45:35] showed how Jesus never did anything
[45:37] except the father showed him to do it
[45:39] and we would say that was anything
[45:41] relating to his kingdom purpose I don't
[45:43] believe Jesus was going around saying
[45:45] praying Lord should I eat this second
[45:46] piece of bread at this meal or what robe
[45:48] should I wear today those are not
[45:50] generally things that that that we're
[45:52] talking about but we're talking about
[45:53] those that relate to the kingdom amen
[45:55] and and that's the things we want to
[45:57] make a matter of prayer those things
[45:58] that affect where we go and what we do
[46:00] and and how we spend our time and
[46:02] whatnot so we're talking about being uh
[46:04] led by the spirit of God Amen walking in
[46:07] the word of God and that's that purpose
[46:09] is to destroy the works of Satan amen
[46:11] it's it's to destroy it first in our
[46:13] life and then we turn into a tool in the
[46:15] hands of God and it's to destroy the
[46:16] works of Satan in other people's lives
[46:19] amen it starts with us and it goes to
[46:20] them and Jesus came to do that very
[46:22] thing and we know that we're a
[46:23] continuation of the works of Jesus Jesus
[46:25] said the things that I do you'll do also
[46:27] and Greater Works than these shall you
[46:29] do but in 1 John 3:8 it says he that
[46:31] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[46:33] devil sinth from the beginning and for
[46:36] this purpose the Son of God was
[46:38] manifested that he might destroy the
[46:40] works of the devil that is the
[46:42] overarching view of of of Jesus Christ's
[46:45] Ministry was to destroy the works of the
[46:47] devil so if we're continuing in the
[46:49] works of Christ let me ask are you
[46:51] destroying the works of the devil this
[46:52] morning what is Christ doing through you
[46:54] this morning is he destroying Satan's
[46:55] hold in your life and then is he
[46:57] destroying it in others or is he just
[46:59] kind of sitting on the sidelines because
[47:01] if the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[47:03] active in you then it is destroying the
[47:05] works of Satan in your life amen it is
[47:07] bringing you out of the world it is
[47:08] separating you for the things of the
[47:09] world it's separating you from the
[47:11] influence that Satan's trying to put on
[47:12] you and it's bringing you closer to the
[47:14] word and it's making you sensitive to
[47:16] the Holy Spirit that's how you know that
[47:18] he's working in our life amen Christ
[47:20] always sought the father's will amen why
[47:23] because there was a portion of the word
[47:24] that was given to him but he had to know
[47:26] when and how to do those things amen
[47:28] it's not just about fulfilling the word
[47:30] that's written but it's about finding
[47:32] God's time and season to fulfill those
[47:34] things Jesus was a Healer he was a
[47:36] redeemer he was a savior he was a he was
[47:39] all of these things but he didn't just
[47:41] go out and do those things as soon as he
[47:42] found out who he was but he sought the
[47:45] father daily he prayed to the God that
[47:47] was within him what would you have me to
[47:49] do and how would you have me to do it
[47:51] and when do you want me to do it now we
[47:54] read this scripture in John 5:19 last
[47:56] time but just to Anchor it this morning
[47:58] it said then answered Jesus and said
[47:59] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[48:02] the son can do nothing of himself but
[48:05] what he seeth the father do for
[48:07] whatsoever he doeth those also does the
[48:10] son likewise but we would know that even
[48:12] by by the Malachi 4 Ministry we have
[48:14] today that Jesus had an open Vision
[48:17] Ministry that's what we saw with brother
[48:19] Brandon we see it with Paul as well but
[48:20] he would literally see a vision of what
[48:23] was going to happen and his role and his
[48:25] timing in it and then he would go do it
[48:27] and until he was supposed to do it he
[48:29] would do nothing remember brother BR
[48:31] would talk about that person that was
[48:32] going to get healed and he had a vision
[48:33] of the whole scene and there was a hat
[48:35] that had to be placed in a certain spot
[48:38] now brother brandom going into that room
[48:39] saw the Hat was in a different spot so
[48:41] he knew it was not time to pray or
[48:43] declare thus sayeth the Lord and he
[48:45] could not move the Hat because the
[48:47] vision didn't show him moving the Hat
[48:49] the vision just showed that the Hat had
[48:50] to be in a certain place and so he sat
[48:52] back and he waited until somebody moved
[48:54] the hat and then he says then I was in
[48:56] the vision and then I could step and say
[48:58] thus sayeth the Lord you'll be healed
[49:00] amen you have to stay with the way that
[49:02] God reveals it to you and these sort of
[49:04] things amen now we don't have generally
[49:06] speaking an open Vision Ministry it's
[49:08] not that God can't do it it's God that
[49:10] God won't do it amen remember he said
[49:12] I'll give your young men visions and
[49:14] your Old Men Dreams there's a promise of
[49:15] that being available to the believer but
[49:18] speaking frankly most of us don't have
[49:19] an open Vision ministry as far as I know
[49:21] there's no one in this church has an
[49:22] open Vision Ministry some of us have had
[49:25] Visions some of us have had spiritual
[49:26] dreams but it's not always the way God
[49:28] works with us but he does do it with
[49:30] some of them but yet we have to find
[49:32] God's will and if we don't have visions
[49:34] and we don't have dreams it means there
[49:35] must be another way than those things
[49:37] and believe me there is because God
[49:39] can't say I want you to find my will and
[49:41] then not tell you how to do it and not F
[49:42] give you a way to find his will but you
[49:45] know it's so often when we're talking
[49:46] about adoption we're talking about
[49:49] doing but what I find a lack of is we
[49:51] don't find so much a talk about finding
[49:54] first we talk about when I'm a Ed Son of
[49:57] God I'll speak and this will happen and
[49:58] I'll do do this and I'll do that but
[50:00] what I don't hear so often is the
[50:02] ministry focused on the finding the will
[50:03] of God so much as doing the Greater
[50:05] Works and we we'll find as we go through
[50:08] this that we preach so much about
[50:09] speaking and nobody's talking about
[50:12] seeking come on now amen we're all
[50:14] looking for for the part that we're
[50:16] going to do but the part that we're
[50:17] going to do starts with letting him know
[50:19] what he wants done that's the way it
[50:21] works amen we preach about Victory but
[50:23] we forget about the leadership that
[50:24] takes us to Victory amen this is all
[50:27] part and portion of being an adopted son
[50:29] and daughter of God so we can't just say
[50:31] I'm going to go do do do and then forget
[50:33] that we have to wait wait wait and find
[50:34] find find and seek seek seek first
[50:37] because otherwise we're going to fall
[50:38] flat on our face amen and we'll realize
[50:40] as we go through this and I think by
[50:41] experience most of us could say this
[50:43] morning the seeking and the finding and
[50:46] the waiting is by far the hardest part
[50:47] of the Christian walk because that's the
[50:49] trial of our faith Amen brother bramwood
[50:51] put it this way in the message
[50:52] perseverance he says You must first find
[50:55] the will of God God before you can do
[50:58] the will of God well I'm an adopted son
[51:01] I'm going to go do well if you're an
[51:02] adopted son you're going to find first
[51:04] he says You must first know what his
[51:06] will is in the matter and then don't
[51:08] turn it loose and as the lady said today
[51:11] she was trying to get beyond that sound
[51:12] barrier he was talking about a lady
[51:13] trying to break through doubt to for her
[51:16] healing he says then the plane just
[51:17] picks up speed and it goes on unlimited
[51:20] when it passes the sound barrier we
[51:22] talked before and we read the quote
[51:23] where when you're going up to the sound
[51:25] barrier everything starts to shake and
[51:27] vibrate and it feels like everything's
[51:29] going to fall apart and blow up and
[51:30] you're going to be left with nothing but
[51:33] he says once you break through that
[51:34] sound barrier once you break through
[51:36] that doubt barrier he says it's
[51:38] unlimited what can happen after that he
[51:40] says well when you pray until you passed
[51:43] the doubt barrier then you're running
[51:45] free you can go on and there's nothing
[51:48] can bother you then because you're
[51:50] running free you're past the unbelief
[51:52] it's done been settled it's all over
[51:54] when you get the Assurance in your heart
[51:57] that it's going to be that way you're
[51:59] just as happy as if it had already
[52:02] happened that's the kind of Faith that's
[52:04] the kind of assurance the Blessed
[52:06] assurance that is available to the bride
[52:08] of Christ this morning that you can
[52:09] break through the doubt by what by
[52:11] Prayer by seeking God by dwelling on his
[52:13] promises and come to a place where you
[52:15] know it is finished it's a done job it's
[52:19] a finished work and nothing is going to
[52:21] hold me back from getting what God has
[52:23] promised to me the challenge is always
[52:26] will we seek and
[52:27] find and then having found it will we
[52:30] hold to it will we not let anything
[52:32] deviate us from that will we wait for
[52:34] that Assurance or will we what presume
[52:37] will we presume that we know that it
[52:40] that it is God's will the characteristic
[52:41] of a child of God is that they are led
[52:44] by the spirit of God we read this we we
[52:46] spoke of this last service but just to
[52:48] put it down Paul said for as many as are
[52:51] led by the spirit of God they are the
[52:53] sons of God the defining characteristic
[52:56] of a child of God an adopted son is that
[52:58] he is led by the Holy Spirit you have to
[53:01] be led amen you're sealed first and
[53:04] you're LED second amen you've got to
[53:06] have a ceiling in your soul that is the
[53:08] new birth that is a requirement it is
[53:10] not baptism it is not a confession in
[53:12] Jesus Christ's name it is the New Birth
[53:14] by the sealing of the holy spirit in
[53:16] your soul and that and that alone gives
[53:18] you access to adoption that's the
[53:21] requirement for us Amen brother B would
[53:23] put it this way now this is a bit of a
[53:25] long quote but hold me because this this
[53:27] Paints the whole picture we're looking
[53:29] at this morning he says notice the
[53:31] harmony of the father and the son Jesus
[53:33] never did anything until it was first
[53:35] shown him by the Father John 5:19 as we
[53:37] read I do nothing except what the father
[53:39] shows me he says this harmony is now to
[53:42] exists between the groom and his bride
[53:44] between Christ and the bride of Christ
[53:46] he shows her his Word of Life first two
[53:51] she receives it she never doubts it
[53:55] therefore nothing can harm her her not
[53:56] even death for if the seed be planted
[53:59] the water will raise it up again then he
[54:02] says here is the secret of this the word
[54:05] is in the bride as it was in Mary in
[54:08] seed
[54:10] form he says the bride has the mind of
[54:13] Christ for she knows what she want what
[54:16] he wants done with the word why because
[54:18] she is a seeking bride she is a
[54:20] listening bride she is a Praying bride
[54:23] she is a waiting bride he says she
[54:25] performed the command of the word in his
[54:28] name for she has thus sayeth the Lord he
[54:31] says then the word is quickened amen it
[54:34] is put into action with power the word
[54:37] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[54:39] to pass he says like a seed that is
[54:42] planted and watered it comes to full
[54:45] Harvest there's a process of planting a
[54:48] watering a growing and then there's a
[54:50] full Harvest what you get in the end is
[54:52] what you started with in the beginning
[54:53] and then all of and but it's multiplied
[54:56] he says it's planted and watered it
[54:58] comes to full Harvest serving its
[55:01] purpose it's always done with
[55:03] purpose he says those in the bride do
[55:06] only his
[55:08] will how do I find the Lord's will for
[55:10] my life one thing's for sure the bride
[55:12] will only do his will no one can make
[55:15] them do otherwise he says they have thus
[55:18] sayeth the Lord or they keep still they
[55:21] do not speak and they do not
[55:24] move both
[55:27] you stand and you wait and you say Lord
[55:30] give me direction a I go the wrong
[55:33] direction amen they know why do they
[55:36] stand still church this is the key to it
[55:38] all they know that it has to be God in
[55:42] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[55:45] word I can do nothing in myself anything
[55:48] I do will fall flat over this Pulpit you
[55:51] can do nothing of Eternal value except
[55:54] God is in it because it takes God to do
[55:56] a Godly work amen he did not complete
[56:00] all his work while in his Earthly
[56:01] Ministry so now he works in and through
[56:03] the bride she knows that for it was not
[56:06] yet time for him to do certain things
[56:08] that he must do now he will now fulfill
[56:11] through the bride that work which he
[56:12] left for this specific time he says now
[56:14] let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our
[56:17] promised land is coming in sight even as
[56:20] theirs did coming in sight he did not
[56:23] declare it to be here he says now Joshua
[56:26] me means Jehovah Savior and he
[56:28] represents the end time leader that will
[56:30] come to the church even as Paul came as
[56:32] the original leader Caleb represents
[56:34] those that stayed true with Joshua he
[56:36] says now remember God had started Israel
[56:39] as a virgin with his word but they
[56:41] wanted something different and so did
[56:44] the last day Church notice how God did
[56:47] not move Israel or let her go into the
[56:49] promised land until it was his own
[56:52] appointed time the word promises there
[56:55] the deliverer is there the word is there
[56:58] the signs and wonders are there but they
[57:00] had to wait on God and you'll notice the
[57:02] first thing that held them back was that
[57:04] they had to come to a place of
[57:05] worshiping the one true God they had to
[57:07] find a place of worship and they built
[57:09] the Tabernacle before they ever went in
[57:11] because God said I've got to be first in
[57:13] your life you've got to know who I am
[57:15] and you got to know where to go to
[57:16] worship you got to know how to find
[57:18] me he says now the people might have put
[57:21] pressure on Joshua the leader and said
[57:22] the land is ours let's go and take it
[57:24] Joshua you're all through you must must
[57:26] have lost your commission you don't have
[57:28] the power you used to have you used to
[57:30] hear from God and know the will of God
[57:31] and act quickly something's wrong with
[57:34] you what oh Moses is dead let's go in
[57:36] immediately Joshua he's made you the
[57:39] leader you got to go this is our time
[57:41] this is our season the word's been given
[57:43] he says but Joshua was a god-sent
[57:46] prophet and he knew the promises of God
[57:49] so he waited for
[57:52] them he waited for them he waited for a
[57:56] clearcut decision from God and when the
[57:59] time came to move God placed the full
[58:02] leadership in Joshua's hands why because
[58:05] he had stayed with the word stay with
[58:09] the word and if you're not with the word
[58:11] get back to the word he says God could
[58:13] trust Joshua but not the others and so
[58:16] it will repeat in this day he says the
[58:19] same problem the same pressure what
[58:21] people saying the promise of God is here
[58:24] let's go do it I'm not saying let's stop
[58:28] I'm saying what is God's will that is
[58:31] the only question here is what is God's
[58:32] timing what is God's season for these
[58:34] things because timing is so often what's
[58:36] missing in our decisions we know who we
[58:38] are we know what God wants done we know
[58:40] the plan for this age we know we're
[58:42] coming to a resurrection and rapture we
[58:44] know we've got an end time message to
[58:46] declare and all of these things but what
[58:48] is God's time and season for our actions
[58:50] in this life God wanted Israel to go
[58:53] into or Cana Israel to go into Canaan
[58:55] that was his will but he had a time of
[58:57] it and remember his time came up at
[58:59] kades Baria and he said go in and the
[59:02] people backed away and God said because
[59:04] of that you'll die in the desert then
[59:05] they said oh okay we'll go in now and
[59:07] God said no you can't go in you've
[59:09] missed my time they said well we'll go
[59:10] in anyways and what happened a bunch of
[59:12] them
[59:13] died why they missed God's timing and
[59:15] God said now I've got a different timing
[59:17] you can't just say okay I'm I'm sorry
[59:19] I'm sorry no you've got to go back to
[59:21] God and say okay what's the new
[59:23] plan you can't presume
[59:27] something that was something was wrong
[59:29] to cause you to miss the first one
[59:31] you've got to fix that before you go the
[59:33] second time cuz they didn't go in in
[59:35] faith they went in
[59:37] desperation we missed it I don't want to
[59:39] die in the desert so I'm going to go in
[59:41] anyways and they were completely out of
[59:42] the will of God Amen there are promises
[59:45] available to us in the Bible healing is
[59:48] the children's bread it is the earnest
[59:51] of the resurrection and the
[59:52] Rapture but look there's a man that
[59:55] prayed at the pool Bethesda until he was
[59:57] 38 years old and when he was healed it
[59:59] was in God's perfect time and it was in
[1:00:01] God's perfect season and it was to
[1:00:04] glorify God and Jesus perceiving Faith
[1:00:06] he had perceiving he had Faith to be
[1:00:08] healed said do you want to be healed
[1:00:11] stand up go your way that woman with the
[1:00:14] issue of blood for 12 years sought every
[1:00:18] bit of
[1:00:19] help and nothing happened and she blew
[1:00:21] all her money on doctors and then one
[1:00:24] day she touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:00:26] and she is recorded in history for that
[1:00:31] action Abraham and Sarah 25 years
[1:00:34] waiting on the promised
[1:00:35] son and then God gave a completely new
[1:00:38] body to
[1:00:40] Sarah and to Abraham to produce the sun
[1:00:44] Lazarus
[1:00:46] died the friend of Jesus
[1:00:49] died too
[1:00:52] late and then Christ comes over and he
[1:00:54] raises him from the dead just just in
[1:00:57] time God's got a time and God's got a
[1:01:00] season even Isaac Church Isaac had a
[1:01:03] promise of being the start of a great
[1:01:04] gener of a great nation and he had to go
[1:01:07] to God and say God you promised us a
[1:01:09] child because Rebecca was Barren Rebecca
[1:01:12] with the promise was
[1:01:14] Barren and Isaac had to go to God and
[1:01:17] say God give us the child that you
[1:01:19] promised there was a seeking there was a
[1:01:22] finding and there was a timing amen
[1:01:24] trusting God to work out the timing is
[1:01:26] one of the hardest things for a Believer
[1:01:28] it's that trial of our faith and and we
[1:01:30] look at that so often and we say God why
[1:01:32] is it because he wants a mature bride
[1:01:35] and a mature bride is going to be a
[1:01:36] faithful bride able to stand still
[1:01:39] amen sometimes we know his will we
[1:01:42] absolutely know it we know who we are we
[1:01:44] know what God wants done but will we
[1:01:46] wait and say Lord when do you want me to
[1:01:48] do it see here's the thing we know our
[1:01:51] purpose but we don't know his
[1:01:54] plan I know who I I am but I don't know
[1:01:57] how I fit in it and so what happens is
[1:01:58] he give us his plan and that gives us
[1:02:00] where the timing is for our purpose
[1:02:03] greatest example that when you when you
[1:02:04] when you look at Moses brother BR puts
[1:02:06] it this way he says now when you have a
[1:02:08] call from God that doesn't altogether
[1:02:09] mean you just jump right out and you're
[1:02:11] doing the will of
[1:02:13] God Amen the gift does not mean you just
[1:02:16] go do because you want the Holy Spirit
[1:02:18] to be behind that
[1:02:20] gift he says you have to find out the
[1:02:23] will of God and the time of God to do it
[1:02:26] Moses thought well the children of
[1:02:27] Israel will understand now that I'm to
[1:02:29] be their deliverer so he starts out to
[1:02:31] do so and he killed a man and he found
[1:02:33] out that the children of Israel did not
[1:02:35] understand who are you you're going to
[1:02:37] kill us the way you did the Egyptian and
[1:02:39] he fled Into the Wilderness Moses was a
[1:02:41] deliverer from his
[1:02:43] birth but he was out of God's will in
[1:02:45] his timing he says and then what happens
[1:02:49] Moses lost all the hopes and all the
[1:02:51] power that he had thinking that freedom
[1:02:53] wasn't for the children of Israel he'
[1:02:55] lost all thoughts of Freedom till God
[1:02:57] met him one day in a burning bush and
[1:02:59] then when God's season came along just
[1:03:02] exactly he says then he revealed his
[1:03:04] plans to Moses now the reason that Moses
[1:03:07] had forgot about Freedom God's promise
[1:03:09] that he would free them but God had him
[1:03:11] forgot his promise Moses tried in
[1:03:14] himself and
[1:03:17] failed that's what the church has done
[1:03:19] many times we've tried in ourselves to
[1:03:22] do this and when we fail to find God's
[1:03:25] El element of time see that's our part
[1:03:28] find God's will find God's timing find
[1:03:32] God's plan and then you step right into
[1:03:35] it and nothing can stop
[1:03:36] you he says this God's got a time for
[1:03:40] all
[1:03:40] things we plant corn we got a time that
[1:03:43] we plow corn then at the time we harvest
[1:03:45] corn the spring rains come the drought
[1:03:47] come through the summer the fall rains
[1:03:49] in the snow you just can't say I plant
[1:03:51] my wheat today and tomorrow and go out
[1:03:53] and harvest it God has times for season
[1:03:57] he has seasons for his word he has times
[1:03:59] in the scripture where it said and the
[1:04:01] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[1:04:03] the sick that's when Jesus was
[1:04:05] ministering too and the presence of the
[1:04:07] Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at
[1:04:09] other times the presence of the Lord
[1:04:10] wasn't there to heal the
[1:04:12] sick he says we find out that God works
[1:04:16] everything
[1:04:17] seasonally and now when Moses what he
[1:04:20] failed to find was the time limit of God
[1:04:23] then when God revealed himself to him in
[1:04:24] the burning bush he found out that the
[1:04:26] very thing that was in The Burning Bush
[1:04:29] was the thing that he lacked what the
[1:04:31] leadership of
[1:04:33] God the presence of God with him the
[1:04:37] pillar of fire that's what made the
[1:04:40] difference Moses wasn't necessarily any
[1:04:42] better or worse but he needed God to go
[1:04:44] with him he says I think that's what a
[1:04:47] whole lot with us today that many times
[1:04:49] we try to do the program ourselves and
[1:04:52] failed to get what was in the burning
[1:04:53] bush the direct revelation of the will
[1:04:57] and time of
[1:04:59] God church if he's saying that's what we
[1:05:01] need then that's got to be available to
[1:05:03] us he says so then Moses found out now
[1:05:06] the real direct will of God and the time
[1:05:09] of God and the revelation of everything
[1:05:11] to do he says now try to keep him out of
[1:05:13] Egypt right back to Egypt he went just
[1:05:16] as hard as he could go for he knew that
[1:05:18] God had promised deliverance and the
[1:05:21] time for deliverance had
[1:05:24] come God had promised promised it and
[1:05:26] now is the time for it he says now Moses
[1:05:28] was looking first at the word that's
[1:05:31] where we go that's our claim is right
[1:05:34] here you find it here you say God that's
[1:05:37] mine when is it mine is it today is it
[1:05:41] tomorrow what's holding it back lord
[1:05:44] what would you have me to do he says
[1:05:47] Moses was first look looking first at
[1:05:48] the word the word of God had promised
[1:05:50] them Deliverance he knew the time was
[1:05:52] nigh why because God gave them a
[1:05:54] timeline he says now he had to have a
[1:05:57] direct contact with God to know how and
[1:06:00] when to do
[1:06:02] it he says now we as Full Gospel people
[1:06:06] I think we have made many mistakes by
[1:06:08] looking into the word and say God said
[1:06:11] this and we failed to find the direct
[1:06:13] revelation of our life to fit in that
[1:06:17] program see it's not just about me it's
[1:06:19] not just about you it's not just my
[1:06:21] little issue or my little problem or my
[1:06:23] little maybe it's your big situation or
[1:06:25] your big problem or my big problem but
[1:06:27] he says how does it all fit into the
[1:06:29] program of God cuz see God sees the big
[1:06:32] picture God sees the big picture and
[1:06:35] we're sitting here in our own little bit
[1:06:37] of humanity saying me me me me
[1:06:39] me God do it for me God do it for me
[1:06:43] sometimes God's using you for a
[1:06:44] testimony that you really don't
[1:06:47] want sure testimonies don't feel real
[1:06:51] good in the middle of them usually but
[1:06:53] God will use you to help somebody else
[1:06:56] I I sent a a video around to the to the
[1:06:59] to some of the church members uh on on
[1:07:01] our our WhatsApp chat there brother Matt
[1:07:04] Watkins was talking about a uh an event
[1:07:07] or a thing they had there and he was
[1:07:09] talking to this this couple that had
[1:07:11] been saved in their in their church and
[1:07:12] then they had a a a friend or a relative
[1:07:14] that had stage four non Hodgkins
[1:07:17] lymphoma cancer now you've seen the
[1:07:20] testimony of my sister right and so he
[1:07:22] said he went in and he was testifying to
[1:07:24] them and he was showing them the
[1:07:25] pictures of my sister atanta her before
[1:07:28] and after and remember she didn't have
[1:07:29] it that bad generally speaking and I say
[1:07:32] that bad because when you see what this
[1:07:34] guy was like it was completely worse and
[1:07:35] they were saying this is what we believe
[1:07:38] God does this is what God did and the
[1:07:40] sis and this lady said I've always
[1:07:42] wanted to believe that God heals like
[1:07:44] that I've always wanted a God that had a
[1:07:46] reality like that and so brother Matt
[1:07:48] went and he prayed for this man and this
[1:07:50] man his body was black with cancer from
[1:07:54] his neck all the way way down to his
[1:07:56] groin almost solid black if you look at
[1:07:59] the pictures and he has like this big
[1:08:01] growth out of his neck the exact same
[1:08:04] thing that my sister had and you know
[1:08:06] what happened he laid hands on him he
[1:08:09] prayed and a little while later he
[1:08:11] sitting with them and they look down at
[1:08:12] their phone and they say oh my goodness
[1:08:14] he's completely healed of cancer there's
[1:08:16] nothing left church this man had a
[1:08:19] growth the size of a large potato on the
[1:08:21] side of his neck visible and completely
[1:08:25] healed
[1:08:28] completely healed there's a time and
[1:08:30] there's a season she went through that
[1:08:33] testimony so God could do a greater work
[1:08:35] in somebody that had it even worse than
[1:08:36] she
[1:08:38] did can you imagine what God can do if
[1:08:42] we'll just sit back and say God I'm
[1:08:44] trusting you I believe you're with me I
[1:08:48] believe you're a Healer I believe you're
[1:08:50] a deliverer I believe you're a provider
[1:08:52] and even though it doesn't look like it
[1:08:54] right now I still believe you're it cuz
[1:08:56] that's the faith of the believer as they
[1:08:58] hold on when nothing else seems to be
[1:09:00] pointing in that direction we're growing
[1:09:02] into rapturing Faith Church what's below
[1:09:04] rapturing Faith healing Faith saving
[1:09:07] Faith leading Faith providing faith and
[1:09:10] so we've got to be growing up bit by bit
[1:09:13] precept upon precept line upon line word
[1:09:15] upon word a little bit here and a little
[1:09:18] bit there growing up into the rapturing
[1:09:20] faith I'm sorry to tell you I know I've
[1:09:21] said it many times you're not just going
[1:09:23] to get rapturing Faith but you will go
[1:09:25] from Faith to Faith and glory to glory
[1:09:27] until you step off of this Earth it's a
[1:09:30] process of time that's going this is
[1:09:32] what brother Ram saying it's starts as a
[1:09:34] seed and it's growing through your life
[1:09:36] and what matters is what you do to help
[1:09:38] it grow do you water it do you get in
[1:09:40] the presence of God to let it ripen in
[1:09:42] the sun that's our part that's our
[1:09:45] portion that's the part that's holding
[1:09:47] people back because you get to choose to
[1:09:50] water it you get to choose to get in the
[1:09:51] presence of God you get to seek and find
[1:09:54] that's the part that you play in side of
[1:09:55] this thing
[1:09:57] amen Jud would say this he says but ye
[1:10:00] beloved building up yourselves on your
[1:10:03] Most Holy Faith don't stop with
[1:10:06] salvational faith keep moving on into
[1:10:09] the next step and the next stage of your
[1:10:11] life and the growth that God has for you
[1:10:13] he says praying in the Holy Ghost that
[1:10:15] means getting in the presence of God
[1:10:17] that means fighting for these things how
[1:10:19] do we get up in that how do we how do we
[1:10:21] grow in the in God Church how do we get
[1:10:24] our faith to stret stretch out there's
[1:10:27] only one way there's only one way you
[1:10:30] can have
[1:10:32] faith so then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:10:36] and hearing comes by the word of God
[1:10:38] that's a supernatural hearing that's a
[1:10:41] spiritual hearing that's not just saying
[1:10:42] I went to church and I heard the word
[1:10:44] but something deep inside of me laid
[1:10:46] hold of that word and it finally caught
[1:10:48] what that preacher was talking about it
[1:10:50] finally caught what that scripture meant
[1:10:52] and it changed my life it only comes by
[1:10:55] the preaching and hearing of the word of
[1:10:57] God
[1:10:59] Amen my wife shared a testimony with us
[1:11:02] yesterday and I was down studying for
[1:11:04] most of the day it was a long day and
[1:11:07] she was in the room NE she was in the
[1:11:08] room just opposite me and I through the
[1:11:10] wall I could hear her listening to
[1:11:12] brother brandom all throughout the day
[1:11:14] and she came up and she said I want to
[1:11:16] tell you what happened because she said
[1:11:18] I was listening to this message and
[1:11:20] brother R's going through it and through
[1:11:21] it and then he gets to the end and he's
[1:11:23] about to call a prayer line and then he
[1:11:25] stops and he says how many in here want
[1:11:28] to be healed or need to be healed that
[1:11:29] doesn't have a prayer
[1:11:32] card this is maybe 40 50 60 years
[1:11:39] ago well my wife needed healing so he
[1:11:42] said I want you to just repeat this
[1:11:44] prayer with me in faith and she repeated
[1:11:46] it and she was healed
[1:11:49] immediately Faith cometh by
[1:11:52] hearing does it matter it matters who
[1:11:55] you sit under it matters what you're
[1:11:57] hearing and it matters whether you go to
[1:11:58] hear it amen she put on an anointed word
[1:12:02] from an anointed prophet and it had an
[1:12:04] anointed effect in her body it brought
[1:12:07] her body subject to the word that she
[1:12:09] was listening to if she could accept it
[1:12:12] she had to say that's for me I don't
[1:12:14] have a prayer card I've been tormented
[1:12:16] by
[1:12:17] this and God sent a Deliverance to her
[1:12:20] if she could hear it by ears of Faith by
[1:12:23] spiritual ears amen
[1:12:25] finding the will of God is always an
[1:12:27] exercise of Faith amen but those that
[1:12:29] come to God must believe that he is that
[1:12:32] he exists that he's real and that he is
[1:12:34] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:12:36] Him diligently seek him all the time in
[1:12:40] everything unrelentingly seeking the
[1:12:42] will of God in their lives amen not just
[1:12:44] sitting back but knocking knocking and
[1:12:46] knocking Jesus talked about the unjust
[1:12:48] judge and that woman that went to him
[1:12:50] and just kept knocking on his door and
[1:12:51] saying deliver me deliver me he says if
[1:12:53] the unjust judge will do it well how
[1:12:55] much more will your father in Heaven do
[1:12:57] if you keep knocking in faith and saying
[1:12:58] deliver me provide for me heal for me
[1:13:01] whatever it might be that we have need
[1:13:03] of David said this in Psalms he says
[1:13:06] teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in
[1:13:08] a plain path because of mine enemies why
[1:13:12] because there's things all over trying
[1:13:14] to drag us out of the will of God trying
[1:13:16] to influence us just that little bit
[1:13:18] just to take us a little bit away lay
[1:13:20] something aside compromise a little
[1:13:23] bit but what is a the word do it keeps
[1:13:26] you in the minds and thoughts of God so
[1:13:28] that you can see that deviation you say
[1:13:30] not today Satan I'm going
[1:13:32] straight brother B puts it this
[1:13:36] way we've lost it he says you've got to
[1:13:40] First find the will of God now you've
[1:13:42] got to find the will of God this morning
[1:13:44] as you're coming to be prayed for you've
[1:13:46] got to find the will of God whether it's
[1:13:47] God's will to heal you or not you say
[1:13:50] it's God's will to heal everyone God
[1:13:52] would desire that we would be healed but
[1:13:55] there are conditions to healing for the
[1:13:56] real
[1:13:57] believer absolutely God is not just a
[1:14:00] grandfather that gives healing to
[1:14:02] everyone there's a purpose behind it and
[1:14:04] he's got to see certain things in our
[1:14:05] lives we'll talk about that in a bit he
[1:14:07] says the next thing you have to do if
[1:14:08] you're coming to get salvation you got
[1:14:09] to find out whether it's God's will to
[1:14:11] save you or not the first thing you have
[1:14:13] to find out is what God's will is he
[1:14:16] says and then if you really have receive
[1:14:19] the seed in your heart then you can be
[1:14:23] persistent you seek until you find and
[1:14:26] once you find then you lay hold of it he
[1:14:28] says there's nothing going to move you
[1:14:30] no matter what wisdom man tries to say
[1:14:32] it's not so and it's not this and that
[1:14:34] and the other it doesn't move you one
[1:14:37] iota because you know what the will of
[1:14:39] God is he spoke it into your heart by he
[1:14:43] says and your faith sits there and it'll
[1:14:46] hold right on no matter if there's no
[1:14:48] more than like a grain of mustard seed
[1:14:51] he says it'll bring you right out to
[1:14:54] that place the will of
[1:14:57] God it doesn't take
[1:14:59] much I was talking with someone after
[1:15:01] church the other day they're talking
[1:15:03] about healing and remember that woman
[1:15:04] that comes up and she gets healed and
[1:15:06] brother Braham says you didn't realize
[1:15:07] you had that much Faith did you it just
[1:15:10] has to be the real deal doesn't have to
[1:15:13] be much it just has to be real because
[1:15:15] you got a little bit and it'll move a
[1:15:18] mountain he says as I was speaking on
[1:15:20] private interviews today and met a
[1:15:21] couple a man and his son I said you can
[1:15:24] never
[1:15:25] never go forward until you're perfectly
[1:15:28] satisfied and know without a shadow of a
[1:15:31] doubt you're walking in God's
[1:15:33] will he says then when you know that
[1:15:36] you're in God's Will and walking in his
[1:15:38] way nothing can stop
[1:15:41] you nothing can stop you because you
[1:15:45] know where you're standing he says the
[1:15:48] know you know the way you're going you
[1:15:50] know what you have in your mind you know
[1:15:52] what the will of God is and then you can
[1:15:55] do
[1:15:57] it we've got to find the will of God you
[1:16:00] say brother John we got it how do we do
[1:16:03] it let's talk about that let's get to
[1:16:06] the Practical side how do we find the
[1:16:08] will of God for our lives amen now I
[1:16:10] want to prefis a bit because we have we
[1:16:12] we have the will of God for two things
[1:16:14] we have the will of God for us to
[1:16:15] receive something and then we have the
[1:16:17] will of God for us to do something and
[1:16:20] those are very different things the
[1:16:22] process is the same but yet they're very
[1:16:24] different in terms of what we're looking
[1:16:26] for amen you're seeking God's will to
[1:16:28] receive something perhaps it's healing
[1:16:29] financial needs something he provides
[1:16:31] amen but we we read last last service in
[1:16:34] the scripture where he said that it is
[1:16:36] that it is God's will for us to prosper
[1:16:38] and be in health even as what even as
[1:16:41] our soul prospers so what God's looking
[1:16:44] for in The Believer is not Earthly
[1:16:46] wealth it is spiritual wealth it's
[1:16:48] spiritual growth it's spiritual maturity
[1:16:50] the revealing of his work of his will
[1:16:52] the mystery of his will is to produce
[1:16:54] adoped Sons and Daughters of God so
[1:16:56] Above All Else God wants us to grow
[1:16:58] spiritually I I've quoted that that
[1:17:01] thing that brother Eugene taught me so
[1:17:02] long ago that agape love God's love is
[1:17:05] based on spiritual growth that is all he
[1:17:07] looks for spiritual growth everything he
[1:17:10] does is to get us to grow spiritually
[1:17:13] because the scripture says seek ye first
[1:17:14] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:17:16] and then all these other things that he
[1:17:17] knows you need he'll add them to you but
[1:17:20] seek that first amen so whatever we need
[1:17:22] to receive is so often depend dependent
[1:17:25] on our spiritual condition now just
[1:17:28] because you're sick just because you're
[1:17:29] in financial need just because you're
[1:17:32] dealing with things doesn't mean we're
[1:17:33] spiritually sick amen but it may
[1:17:37] indicate that there's a deeper issue
[1:17:38] than just the sickness or the the the
[1:17:40] want that you're you're going through in
[1:17:42] these different things so we always need
[1:17:43] to check up we always need to check up
[1:17:46] but really as we come into adoption
[1:17:48] we're not talking about receiving
[1:17:49] because remember adoption is about
[1:17:51] service not receiving it's about working
[1:17:54] it's about destroy destroying the works
[1:17:55] of Satan and so it's not about what I
[1:17:57] get it's about what I can give it's
[1:17:59] about what I can do for the body of
[1:18:01] Christ amen and so when we're going into
[1:18:03] action when we're in adoption then what
[1:18:05] we're doing is we're saying God I'm
[1:18:06] about your kingdom work now what would
[1:18:09] you have me to do where would you have
[1:18:10] me to go how would you have me to do it
[1:18:12] when would you have me to do it why
[1:18:14] because we're going to face opposition
[1:18:16] we're going to face uh battles we're
[1:18:18] going to face struggles and so we've got
[1:18:20] to know that when those things come that
[1:18:22] we're facing them because we're in the
[1:18:23] will of God not because we're proud of
[1:18:25] the will of
[1:18:26] God now here's the thing you say how do
[1:18:29] I find the will of God for my life if
[1:18:31] only we had somebody that had asked the
[1:18:32] profit this question how do you feel is
[1:18:35] the best way to find the Lord's will in
[1:18:37] some important matters here you
[1:18:39] go he says I tell you dear friend the
[1:18:42] best way not the only way the best way
[1:18:46] to find the will of God in some
[1:18:47] important matters is
[1:18:50] prayer he says here's a wonderful little
[1:18:52] thing here if you have a matter that's
[1:18:54] very important now here's the way I do
[1:18:56] it I take it before the Lord it's always
[1:18:59] been my strength what's my his strength
[1:19:01] his Visions his dreams no I wait upon
[1:19:04] the Lord and see what he
[1:19:06] says he says and I just let myself be
[1:19:09] neutral to it and don't take either side
[1:19:13] it's not wrong to have a
[1:19:15] preference Jesus had a preference in
[1:19:18] Gethsemane I don't want to do it it's
[1:19:20] going to hurt a
[1:19:22] lot but he said nevertheless less not my
[1:19:26] will but thy will be done that's what
[1:19:28] neutrality means this flesh is always
[1:19:31] going to have a preference and it's
[1:19:32] always going to be the easy Road the fun
[1:19:34] road the nice Road the wealthy Road the
[1:19:36] healthy
[1:19:38] road it's not wrong to want it but we've
[1:19:40] got to lay it aside and say Lord I know
[1:19:43] your way is the best
[1:19:44] way he says and so if I was in your
[1:19:47] place and didn't have visions from the
[1:19:49] Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and
[1:19:51] say Lord now you show me what's the
[1:19:54] decision to make notice he did not say
[1:19:56] Lord here are your three options tell me
[1:19:58] which one to take he said Lord you tell
[1:20:01] me the decision to make because so often
[1:20:04] what Satan does is he gives us three
[1:20:05] options and we think one of them's got
[1:20:07] to be the will of God
[1:20:10] no that's Satan's tools they're putting
[1:20:13] us through these things that work and
[1:20:15] and it's these situational things that
[1:20:16] are uh it's it's all this alternative
[1:20:18] lifestyle stuff and everything they're
[1:20:19] trying to get us to to think wider and
[1:20:21] bigger and you know what they do they
[1:20:23] give you four answers as to how to
[1:20:24] respond to a situation you know what I
[1:20:26] do I don't click any of them because
[1:20:27] none of them are my answer but here's
[1:20:29] the thing Satan will give you answers
[1:20:31] and say pick four one of the four one of
[1:20:33] the three one of the two whatever it is
[1:20:35] listen God can give you an answer that
[1:20:37] you don't even realize God can lead you
[1:20:40] in a way you didn't consider before so
[1:20:42] don't go and say God here's the option
[1:20:43] say God here's the situation what do you
[1:20:45] have me to do amen he says and then the
[1:20:50] way you feel led to do it oh I got an
[1:20:52] unction brother John he says wait a
[1:20:55] little wait just a little bit okay it's
[1:20:58] still there and then wait a little
[1:21:00] little while longer he says and see
[1:21:03] which way which side you lean towards
[1:21:05] which way the spirit would lead say now
[1:21:07] father in my heart you know it doesn't
[1:21:09] matter but I want to know what you want
[1:21:11] to do about
[1:21:13] it and he doesn't say it here but I will
[1:21:15] add to it this when you get an answer
[1:21:17] check it with the word always always
[1:21:21] I've had too many people come to me and
[1:21:22] say I feel led to do this and I say it's
[1:21:24] against the word of God and you know
[1:21:26] what that's embarrassing for them and
[1:21:27] it's embarrassing for
[1:21:30] me check it with the word because God
[1:21:33] cannot lead you outside of his word he
[1:21:35] cannot Lead You contrary to his word
[1:21:37] can't do it he doesn't do it he says
[1:21:39] that's the way I do about meetings
[1:21:41] sometimes I feel kind of led to go this
[1:21:43] way or that way then I'll follow that
[1:21:44] way that's the way to do it cuz it's in
[1:21:46] prayer then you're doing the best you
[1:21:51] can he says and I believe this my
[1:21:53] friends as Paul was in the new Testament
[1:21:55] in days gone by he was between two
[1:21:57] Straits which way he should go and he
[1:21:59] started on the wrong road and he got a
[1:22:01] Macedonian call he says and I believe if
[1:22:04] you are making a decision for god making
[1:22:07] a decision for God and do it the best
[1:22:10] you can I believe God will correct you
[1:22:13] and see that you don't go wrong I
[1:22:16] believe God will do it that's a great
[1:22:18] grace and mercy to us this morning amen
[1:22:20] that in your sincerity if you step
[1:22:22] outside of his will he'll bring you
[1:22:23] right back around to it why because a
[1:22:25] sincere heart is easily corrected a
[1:22:27] sincere heart is always easily corrected
[1:22:29] now this isn't a platform for laziness
[1:22:33] church let me say that again this is not
[1:22:35] the platform for laziness well brother
[1:22:37] John I prayed once and this is how I
[1:22:39] feel led to do
[1:22:40] it and you're not answering to me by the
[1:22:43] way I have nothing to do with it you
[1:22:45] answer to him but you don't just say I
[1:22:47] prayed last night for three minutes and
[1:22:49] this is the way I feel led to do it he
[1:22:51] may give you a clear answer in three
[1:22:52] minutes but the prophet God says wait a
[1:22:54] little bit and then wait a little bit
[1:22:55] more and make sure it stays that way
[1:22:58] make sure it stays that way amen
[1:23:00] remember what we said we read the
[1:23:02] scripture says God is a rewarder of them
[1:23:04] that diligently seek Him
[1:23:08] diligently constantly it's a continual
[1:23:11] thing and it's got to be sincere and
[1:23:12] it's got to be
[1:23:13] honest remember what Paul
[1:23:16] said pray without
[1:23:19] ceasing now that doesn't mean that your
[1:23:22] entire day is spent in prayer we has
[1:23:24] only so much capacity we have a a mind
[1:23:26] that has to work and take care of things
[1:23:28] and whatnot but what he says here when
[1:23:30] you go into this it means be prayerful
[1:23:33] pray constantly without unnecessary gaps
[1:23:36] in time meaning don't go long times
[1:23:39] without talking to God don't go a week
[1:23:42] without praying to God don't go a day
[1:23:45] without having a conversation with god
[1:23:47] and as you come up to situations say
[1:23:50] Lord I need you Lord lead and guide me
[1:23:54] because what's going to happen in those
[1:23:55] situations so many times you don't know
[1:23:57] you can't pray ahead of time when they
[1:23:58] say this what do I say so you've got to
[1:24:00] go in prayed up you got to go in
[1:24:03] prepared you got to go in Washed by the
[1:24:05] Water of the word you got to go in
[1:24:06] fortified with the sword of the word so
[1:24:08] that when the situation comes up when
[1:24:10] circumstances go sideways you know how
[1:24:12] to respond because you've been in his
[1:24:14] presence like brother brah talked about
[1:24:17] David he says David was prayed up when
[1:24:18] he met Goliath he didn't have to go get
[1:24:20] ready he was ready for the battle right
[1:24:22] then and there amen you can't read your
[1:24:24] Bible too much and you can't pray too
[1:24:26] much that's for sure there's a lot of
[1:24:29] things you can do too much but those
[1:24:30] aren't them you when you look in the
[1:24:32] scriptures and you look at Believers
[1:24:34] you'll see that there are always people
[1:24:36] of prayer always people of prayer David
[1:24:39] is probably the greatest example of a
[1:24:41] man that just went in and he didn't
[1:24:42] leave until he got his answer because
[1:24:44] David never lost the
[1:24:46] battle why because he kept looking for
[1:24:48] God's will that's the way it always
[1:24:50] worked with David he sought the Lord in
[1:24:52] all of these things amen you know I
[1:24:54] think of Paul and and remember he's he
[1:24:56] he he's appealed to Caesar God tells him
[1:24:58] appeal to Caesar I'm going to send you
[1:25:00] for a witness you've got to go before
[1:25:01] Caesar and plead your case and you're
[1:25:03] going to die there by the way Paul so
[1:25:06] Paul goes and remember he's going to
[1:25:07] take a ship and before he gets on the
[1:25:09] ship because the Centurion is taking him
[1:25:11] he says guys we really shouldn't go on
[1:25:13] this trip it's not going to end
[1:25:16] well Paul was a prophet they knew he was
[1:25:19] something special and he says I highly
[1:25:20] recommend we don't do this and so what
[1:25:23] happens the the Centurion says no no no
[1:25:25] the sailor's no better than you P we're
[1:25:26] going to go and they go out and they get
[1:25:28] this
[1:25:29] storm and for three days they're doing
[1:25:31] everything they can to to hold the ship
[1:25:33] together and then what does Paul do
[1:25:36] Paul's not comfortable in this situation
[1:25:38] Paul knows he's going to make it through
[1:25:40] because he's got to go to Caesar Paul's
[1:25:42] not worried for his life but what does
[1:25:43] Paul do in this situation they've they
[1:25:46] they they've disobeyed his his his
[1:25:48] recommendations they put his Prophet uh
[1:25:50] mantle aside and now he goes and he
[1:25:53] starts to pray for those Souls that are
[1:25:55] in that
[1:25:56] ship they've turned him down but he goes
[1:25:59] and he starts praying for
[1:26:01] them and then he gets an answer and what
[1:26:03] does he do Church does he come up and
[1:26:05] say ner ner
[1:26:08] ner I told you not to do it and now look
[1:26:10] where you're at Paul says you should
[1:26:14] have listened to me he reminds them you
[1:26:16] got you had the word of the Lord and you
[1:26:19] turned it down but watch what he says
[1:26:24] he says for there stood by me this night
[1:26:26] the angel of God whose I am and who I
[1:26:30] serve adopted sons have access to
[1:26:33] something that many people will never
[1:26:34] even know about he says saying fear not
[1:26:37] Paul for thou must be brought before
[1:26:40] Caeser and lo God have given thee all
[1:26:44] them s them that sail with thee Paul
[1:26:46] goes down and he starts to pray for the
[1:26:49] souls on that
[1:26:50] ship and he gets an answer from God that
[1:26:52] says I'll give you every one of them
[1:26:55] cuz he
[1:26:56] asked cuz he asked Church doesn't matter
[1:27:00] if we pray it matters if we pray does it
[1:27:02] matter how we pray it matters how as we
[1:27:04] pray continually Paul's there for three
[1:27:07] days and that thing drags on for 14 days
[1:27:10] if I'm not mistaken 14 days where
[1:27:12] everything's just going south south
[1:27:14] south and Paul says listen don't worry
[1:27:16] let the ship go get in the water you'll
[1:27:18] all be safe and sure enough they come
[1:27:20] out there they come out
[1:27:22] safe it's not just about praying but
[1:27:24] it's praying the right
[1:27:26] way they said to Jesus teach us how to
[1:27:29] pray have you ever looked at the order
[1:27:31] of the Lord's Prayer I did a whole
[1:27:33] series on on on this way back when here
[1:27:36] in Newland but you notice that it always
[1:27:38] starts with acknowledging who God is you
[1:27:41] know what that's saying God you're the
[1:27:43] most important thing you're the
[1:27:45] Sovereign power You're My Healer you're
[1:27:47] my provider you're my deliverer you're
[1:27:49] my guide you're my
[1:27:52] protector and I just want to knowledge
[1:27:54] that before I talk about anything
[1:27:57] else Our Father who art in heaven
[1:27:59] Hallowed be thy name thank you Lord I
[1:28:02] love you Lord I appreciate that you've
[1:28:05] been my
[1:28:06] God then what does it say thy kingdom
[1:28:09] come thy will be done Lord You're
[1:28:12] Sovereign your will is perfect your will
[1:28:15] is what's best for me and then after
[1:28:18] that it says thy will be done on
[1:28:22] Earth this Earth
[1:28:24] as it is in heaven and then it says give
[1:28:27] us this day our daily bread and forgive
[1:28:30] us lead us not in Temptation Deliver Us
[1:28:33] from Evil see so often we go into prayer
[1:28:36] and all we're focused on is
[1:28:37] me and at the end we say I love you Lord
[1:28:40] by the
[1:28:41] way if we'd invert that and say Lord I
[1:28:45] love you I worship you I praise you I'm
[1:28:49] sick I'm tired I'm weary I'm
[1:28:52] broke I'm broken
[1:28:55] but I love you anyways You Are God
[1:28:58] Alone and you do all things well I think
[1:29:01] that it changed sometimes the results we
[1:29:03] have
[1:29:06] Amen brother Bram says this he says now
[1:29:08] if we have went to seeking the giver
[1:29:11] instead of the gifts I believe the
[1:29:12] church would have been further up the
[1:29:13] road don't you think so he says if we'd
[1:29:16] stayed close to God and loved him and
[1:29:19] just kept living for him and not trying
[1:29:22] to push things over not trying to make
[1:29:25] it happen not trying to do it our way
[1:29:27] not trying to force our will into his
[1:29:29] will not trying to tell God what to do
[1:29:32] but just living for
[1:29:34] him he says just live for God live a
[1:29:38] pure and holy life and live and pray
[1:29:41] every day keep yourself refreshed in his
[1:29:44] presence and God will take care of the
[1:29:46] rest of it he will adopt the people into
[1:29:49] his own beloved body the church and when
[1:29:51] the Rapture comes you'll be found
[1:29:53] without a blemish because you're living
[1:29:55] in the presence of the king he says
[1:29:57] that's the secret friend living in the
[1:30:00] presence of the king he says there it is
[1:30:02] when you're meeting really face to face
[1:30:04] with demon powers when you're meeting
[1:30:06] face to face with opposition where
[1:30:08] there's where the testing time comes he
[1:30:11] says a chains only its strongest at its
[1:30:13] weakest link that's right and when
[1:30:14] you're face to face with opposition be
[1:30:17] sure that you know what you're talking
[1:30:19] about what's he saying your daily life
[1:30:21] your daily experience with God is what's
[1:30:24] going to hold you in those moments
[1:30:25] because you know who you have believed
[1:30:28] you know that he's real you know that
[1:30:29] you've talked to him you know that he's
[1:30:30] spoken back to you he's LED you he's
[1:30:32] guided you he's provided for
[1:30:34] you he says live a Pure Life live a life
[1:30:38] that's pleasing to God and keep yourself
[1:30:41] refreshed in his
[1:30:42] presence this world it used to be you
[1:30:45] had to go out of your house to get
[1:30:46] influenced by the world now all you have
[1:30:48] is a smartphone and Satan has every bit
[1:30:50] of influence he ever used to have at the
[1:30:53] tap of a button at a couple little
[1:30:56] queries or searches
[1:30:58] apps Satan can be influenced just by the
[1:31:01] simple picking up of of a phone Satan
[1:31:03] can influence us by a simple picking up
[1:31:04] of our phone turning on your
[1:31:07] computer right you don't have to go buy
[1:31:09] a book anymore you don't have to go look
[1:31:10] at a bad magazine you don't have to go
[1:31:12] to a concert or something it is all
[1:31:14] available right
[1:31:16] there and here's a sad thing sometimes
[1:31:18] we're inviting him
[1:31:21] in sometimes we go down that road
[1:31:24] and guess what when you invite somebody
[1:31:26] into your house they have full access
[1:31:29] and full right to your
[1:31:32] home we've got instant access to
[1:31:34] distraction to entertainment to filth to
[1:31:37] news to personalities to
[1:31:41] influence and what happens is Satan
[1:31:43] moves in slowly and what happens is we
[1:31:45] stop seeking the presence of
[1:31:48] God Prophet said keep yourself
[1:31:51] refreshed anyone need a refreshing this
[1:31:54] morning
[1:31:56] weary God bless
[1:31:58] you weary
[1:32:01] tired you know what this ought to be the
[1:32:04] happiest time of the year for us as as
[1:32:05] we have summer and sunshine and it's the
[1:32:08] most miserable time for me because of my
[1:32:11] allergies you know what I get weary in
[1:32:13] the spring and early summer I don't
[1:32:16] sleep well my eyes are watering my
[1:32:18] throat gets acting
[1:32:20] up I get weary and you know what this
[1:32:23] body
[1:32:24] can drag down my spirit when you're
[1:32:27] tired when you're worn
[1:32:30] out I need to get in his presence to
[1:32:32] refresh because I've got to be able to
[1:32:34] push past how I
[1:32:36] feel Amen to get into the promise of the
[1:32:39] word and let the Holy Spirit Quicken me
[1:32:42] amen he says keep yourself what does
[1:32:45] that mean it's our
[1:32:47] choice we have to do it God is a
[1:32:50] gentleman he will not force himself in
[1:32:53] we have to seek we have to push we have
[1:32:57] to give the time because what happens is
[1:32:59] we're trying to cram God into the 15
[1:33:01] minutes we've allocated for him each day
[1:33:03] and then we get stuck on our phone for
[1:33:04] two hours and you think that 15 minutes
[1:33:07] that you got is going to push out the
[1:33:09] two hours that you spend looking at
[1:33:10] stuff that's a total waste of your time
[1:33:13] my
[1:33:14] time meaning me
[1:33:16] personally I'm preaching to us
[1:33:19] all refreshment of the presence of God
[1:33:23] let ask us ourselves this morning what's
[1:33:26] the timeline look like between time with
[1:33:27] God and time with everything
[1:33:30] else my phone every Sunday morning gives
[1:33:32] me a report on how much time I averaged
[1:33:34] on my phone every week per day and I
[1:33:37] cringe when I see it go up because I
[1:33:40] don't want it going up I want it going
[1:33:41] down down down because I know that half
[1:33:45] of it at least is a total waste of my
[1:33:48] time where are we
[1:33:51] at we want rapturing faith
[1:33:54] we want healing faith we want delivering
[1:33:57] faith we want provisional
[1:34:01] Faith where's the
[1:34:04] diligence amen God's a rewarder of those
[1:34:07] that diligently seek him not
[1:34:10] conveniently seek Him
[1:34:12] amen my mom said this way she said I
[1:34:15] give God a tithe out of my day minimum
[1:34:18] your waking hours give them one tenth of
[1:34:21] that that's a good rule that's a good
[1:34:24] rule but guess what you're going to have
[1:34:26] to fight you're going to have to seek
[1:34:28] that out you're going to have to push
[1:34:31] things away and decide what really
[1:34:33] matters what's really in your core work
[1:34:36] for the kingdom of God and then take
[1:34:38] everything else and say sorry that's got
[1:34:40] to go by the wayside because I want to
[1:34:41] go in a
[1:34:43] Rapture I want to get out of
[1:34:45] here so often we're asking where's the
[1:34:48] god of Elijah and God's saying well
[1:34:49] where are the
[1:34:50] elijas God hasn't changed
[1:34:53] God has not changed the Holy Spirit has
[1:34:56] not changed so where are those that'll
[1:34:58] have the commitment of Elijah the prayer
[1:35:00] life of Elijah Elijah got weary too
[1:35:03] remember Elijah got tired Elijah got
[1:35:05] down but it never stopped him from
[1:35:07] following the will of God finding and
[1:35:09] following the will of God in his life
[1:35:10] and God backed him up every
[1:35:13] time we're human we're going to get
[1:35:15] tired we're going to get worn out we're
[1:35:17] going to get weary we're going to get
[1:35:19] dragged down we're going to trip up and
[1:35:21] fall but ajust matter a righteous man
[1:35:24] gets up over and over and over again
[1:35:26] that's not what defines us Christ is our
[1:35:28] Perfection but spiritual maturity brings
[1:35:31] us to a place where we give him the
[1:35:33] preeminence in our day and in our time
[1:35:35] amen Elijah had lots of Trials and Faith
[1:35:38] of his faith amen but he rested in
[1:35:39] knowing that God had told him what to do
[1:35:41] he's going up and he's facing 450
[1:35:44] prophets he's putting himself in the
[1:35:46] lion's
[1:35:47] mouth and God backs him up his simple
[1:35:50] prayer Lord vindicate your word
[1:35:54] vindicate your word and he destroys
[1:35:56] everything the altar the wood the
[1:36:01] stone The Oxen the water everything
[1:36:05] just vindicating you stay with my word
[1:36:09] I'm the one true God brother Braham says
[1:36:11] this but whatever I'm trying to get
[1:36:14] these things settled down where I can
[1:36:16] find his perfect Divine will number one
[1:36:20] then he says his channel to walk in and
[1:36:23] stay there there regardless of what
[1:36:25] anyone says about
[1:36:26] it he says when you find the will of God
[1:36:29] don't let nobody talk you out of
[1:36:31] it there's a story of a young prophet in
[1:36:33] the book of First Kings and God gave him
[1:36:35] a message for King jeroboam and he went
[1:36:37] and he he gave it to the king and the
[1:36:39] King reacted poorly and he went out to
[1:36:40] grab him and as soon as he laid hold of
[1:36:42] him his hand
[1:36:43] withered and the King was of course very
[1:36:46] shocked I'm
[1:36:47] sorry will you pray for me and so the
[1:36:49] young Prophet prays for him and his hand
[1:36:51] is restored and the King says to him he
[1:36:53] says well come home with me and he says
[1:36:55] I'll give you a good meal and I'll give
[1:36:56] you a reward for what you've done to me
[1:36:59] but catch this thought now cuz God knew
[1:37:01] what was coming coming and he told his
[1:37:02] Prophet what to do he says and the man
[1:37:04] of God said unto the king if thou will
[1:37:06] give me half of thine house I will not
[1:37:08] go with thee in other words you give me
[1:37:09] half of what you own I still won't come
[1:37:11] he says neither will I eat bread nor
[1:37:13] drink water in this place for so it was
[1:37:16] was it charged me by the word of the
[1:37:17] Lord saying eat no bread nor drink water
[1:37:19] nor turn again by the same way that thou
[1:37:22] came he says you came by the King's Way
[1:37:24] do not go back by the king's way and
[1:37:25] don't eat anything with anybody he says
[1:37:28] and so he went another way and returned
[1:37:30] not by the way he came to bethl notice
[1:37:33] he followed the word of God and did not
[1:37:35] tempt
[1:37:37] himself because when you walk by a place
[1:37:39] of Temptation you're going to be tempted
[1:37:41] more than you were if you weren't there
[1:37:43] amen we've talked about this before
[1:37:46] Joseph used his feet for discernment he
[1:37:48] did not sit and have a conversation with
[1:37:50] Piper's wife when she tried to force him
[1:37:52] to have a relationship with her he used
[1:37:54] his feet for discernment 99% of the
[1:37:57] battle is won if you just walk away do
[1:37:59] not give yourself the option you know
[1:38:01] your weakness you know that hole in your
[1:38:03] armor you know where Satan's got a Punch
[1:38:05] Coming do not give him the
[1:38:07] opportunity and here's the beautiful
[1:38:09] thing God had shown him don't do it
[1:38:13] don't do it so he just had to Simply
[1:38:15] obey and he did he did but I want you to
[1:38:19] see how Satan works because sometimes he
[1:38:22] can't get you with an un believer so
[1:38:23] he'll get you with a Believer or
[1:38:26] somebody you think is a
[1:38:28] Believer now I want to be very careful
[1:38:30] this morning this isn't aimed at anyone
[1:38:31] or anything but but I want you to look
[1:38:33] at this story because every bit of
[1:38:35] scripture is given for our admonition
[1:38:37] we're talking about personally finding
[1:38:39] the will of God for our lives because
[1:38:41] there's this old prophet in bethl do you
[1:38:44] remember what bethl means House of God
[1:38:46] there's an old prophet in the house of
[1:38:48] God that hears of all of this that's
[1:38:50] happened and so he gets on his donkey
[1:38:52] and he chases down the the younger
[1:38:54] prophet and he's trying to bring him in
[1:38:56] for Fellowship but he knows the message
[1:38:59] that young man has been given that says
[1:39:01] do not stop and yet he goes and he
[1:39:03] willfully seeks without that young man
[1:39:06] and watch what he says so he comes up to
[1:39:08] that young man and the young man says
[1:39:10] hey uh nice to see you but I can't come
[1:39:12] back with you I can't stop and eat God
[1:39:15] told me don't do
[1:39:16] it listen to what this believer says and
[1:39:21] he said unto him I'm a prophet also as
[1:39:23] thou
[1:39:24] and an angel spake unto me by the word
[1:39:26] of the Lord saying bring him back with
[1:39:28] thee into thine house that he may eat
[1:39:30] bread and drink water it says but he
[1:39:33] lied unto
[1:39:34] him remember what Paul said though we
[1:39:37] are an angel from heaven speak any other
[1:39:40] gospel when God shows you his personal
[1:39:43] will for you do not
[1:39:46] move do not move I have no idea how this
[1:39:49] Prophet did it maybe God hadn't been
[1:39:51] using him in a while maybe he got
[1:39:52] jealous
[1:39:54] maybe he was trying to exert his
[1:39:55] influence the scripture never tells us
[1:39:57] why but this man intentionally went to
[1:40:00] get this young man out of God's
[1:40:03] will it's not inspiration and the only
[1:40:07] thing that we can decipher from this is
[1:40:09] that he wants to destroy this young man
[1:40:11] cuz he knows the promise is death if you
[1:40:14] get out of the
[1:40:16] word he says and so he went back with
[1:40:18] him and did eat bread in his house and
[1:40:20] drank water he listened to what someone
[1:40:22] else had said even even though the word
[1:40:23] of the Lord had come to him and had come
[1:40:25] true already and God had stayed with
[1:40:27] them all the way through this he had
[1:40:29] God's Will and now somebody else coming
[1:40:32] somebody senior to him comes and tells
[1:40:34] him no God's will for you is
[1:40:36] different it says and it came to pass as
[1:40:38] they sat at the table that the word of
[1:40:40] the Lord came unto the prophet that
[1:40:41] brought him back now the old guy is
[1:40:43] suddenly getting a word from the Lord a
[1:40:45] real word from the Lord and he cried
[1:40:47] under the man of God that came from
[1:40:48] Judah saying thus sayeth the Lord for as
[1:40:50] much as thou Hast disobeyed the mouth of
[1:40:52] the Lord and has not kept the
[1:40:54] Commandment which the Lord thy God
[1:40:55] commanded thee but camest back and has
[1:40:57] eaten bread and drunk water in the place
[1:40:59] of the which the Lord did say to thee
[1:41:01] eat no bread and drink no water thy
[1:41:04] carcass shall not come unto the separer
[1:41:06] of thy fathers he says you're not going
[1:41:08] to make it back to where you live alive
[1:41:09] and you won't even get buried with your
[1:41:11] fathers you went against what I told you
[1:41:14] you got influenced by somebody who was
[1:41:16] not me you let their gift override your
[1:41:18] test your personal witness and
[1:41:21] testimony now
[1:41:24] that young Prophet took his donkey home
[1:41:26] and on the way back a lion killed him
[1:41:28] killed him did not eat him and it stood
[1:41:30] over his body and you know who came and
[1:41:32] dragged it back that old Prophet came
[1:41:34] put it on a donkey and came and buried
[1:41:36] it with his
[1:41:39] family that old
[1:41:41] Prophet that old believer dragged that
[1:41:44] young man to his death by exerting an
[1:41:46] influence on him because he knew that
[1:41:49] young man would respect
[1:41:51] him as ministers we have to be so
[1:41:54] careful but church let me say it's not
[1:41:56] just ministers it's Mom and it's Dad
[1:41:59] amen deacons we can push people in
[1:42:03] directions without knowing the
[1:42:06] situation if they prayed and it is not
[1:42:08] contrary to the word of God we must let
[1:42:11] them
[1:42:12] go but here's the
[1:42:15] thing sometimes we've been down that
[1:42:17] road and it looks the exact same we're
[1:42:19] allowed to say I'm not sure that's the
[1:42:21] best idea but we should never try and
[1:42:23] force it cuz they've got to grow and
[1:42:26] learn just like we did and guess what
[1:42:28] you learn by your mistakes as much as by
[1:42:30] your your successes amen we're here to
[1:42:33] edify one another but here's the thing
[1:42:36] I've got weaknesses that you don't and
[1:42:37] you've got weaknesses I don't and so God
[1:42:39] can lead me a certain way and it's
[1:42:40] perfect for me and it's horrible for you
[1:42:41] and vice versa so God may lead you in a
[1:42:44] way that's different than mine and he
[1:42:45] may lead me in a way that's different
[1:42:46] than yours amen and so we've got to find
[1:42:48] God's will for our lives each one I
[1:42:50] can't do it based on my life and you
[1:42:52] can't do it based on yours amen but as
[1:42:54] long as our our leadership doesn't
[1:42:55] contradict the word of
[1:42:57] God then we've got to let it go but if
[1:43:00] it is contrary to the word of God you
[1:43:02] have an obligation to speak up and so do
[1:43:04] I you see a brother or sister going in a
[1:43:06] way that is absolutely contrary to the
[1:43:08] word of God you have a right and an
[1:43:10] obligation to say brother sister watch
[1:43:12] out and here's why not I feel not I
[1:43:17] believe thus says the word that's it no
[1:43:21] opinions word that's that's how we do it
[1:43:23] amen but let me stop
[1:43:26] here because sometimes it's not contrary
[1:43:29] meaning there's nothing in the word that
[1:43:30] says you should not do this but what we
[1:43:33] do is we ignore the instruction of the
[1:43:35] word in other
[1:43:36] areas so sometimes the word doesn't say
[1:43:38] don't do this but what it does say is do
[1:43:41] this and when we do this it doesn't
[1:43:43] allow us to do this can I give an easy
[1:43:44] example we're living in Alberta uh we
[1:43:47] had a lot of people that worked on the
[1:43:49] oil
[1:43:50] rigs and if you know oil rig jobs they
[1:43:52] are typically 3 weeks on and then one or
[1:43:55] two weeks off and then they come back
[1:43:57] well in those three weeks they have no
[1:43:59] church they're away from their families
[1:44:01] they're among some of the the crudest
[1:44:03] roughest people on the planet they work
[1:44:06] hard they play hard and there's all
[1:44:08] sorts of Filth that's available in those
[1:44:10] camps okay there is nothing Godly about
[1:44:13] it but yet the scripture does not say
[1:44:17] don't work on an oil
[1:44:18] rig
[1:44:20] amen the scripture doesn't say don't go
[1:44:22] work don't work work there we all work
[1:44:25] in filthy workplaces I work for the
[1:44:26] federal government and it's as filthy as
[1:44:28] any place I've ever been in many ways
[1:44:30] but it's not filthy the way an oil rig
[1:44:31] is but yet it's filthy it's more subtle
[1:44:33] though so that in and of itself is not
[1:44:35] bad so you can't say well the the word
[1:44:38] doesn't say no to oil rigs amen but
[1:44:41] remember we're supposed to thrive
[1:44:43] spiritually in God's
[1:44:46] Will and everything else comes next so
[1:44:49] if we're
[1:44:51] surviving in that oil rig job that's not
[1:44:54] what God's looking for he's looking for
[1:44:55] us to grow I was talking to a a minister
[1:44:59] from Alberta there a while back and he
[1:45:01] said you know I've had a number of young
[1:45:02] men that that wanted to go there and he
[1:45:04] says and I've told every one of them it
[1:45:05] is not a good idea he says I'm not
[1:45:08] saying it's not God's will he's saying
[1:45:09] I'm not it's not a good idea and he says
[1:45:11] for you to survive it it takes a very
[1:45:13] strong
[1:45:16] Christian not to mention grow
[1:45:19] amen but here's the problem is the
[1:45:23] scripture does say forsake not the
[1:45:24] assembling of yourselves together so it
[1:45:27] doesn't say don't go to the oil rigs but
[1:45:28] it does say keep going to church it does
[1:45:31] say You're supposed to be home with your
[1:45:32] family you're supposed to lead your
[1:45:33] house and what happens so many times in
[1:45:35] those families is that the mother is
[1:45:36] left the wife is left to completely take
[1:45:38] care of everything on her own and she's
[1:45:39] put out of her position because you get
[1:45:41] out of your position amen so there's
[1:45:44] nothing wrong with an oil rig job except
[1:45:46] when you look at the instruction of the
[1:45:48] word the job
[1:45:49] fails and so you say I'm sorry you can
[1:45:52] say to a brother like that and say I'm
[1:45:53] sorry I don't believe the word supports
[1:45:55] that kind of a life I don't believe the
[1:45:58] word supports that kind of a way of
[1:45:59] making money because it's going to
[1:46:01] destroy your family it's going to
[1:46:02] destroy your your ability to support the
[1:46:04] local body if nothing else it affects
[1:46:06] the
[1:46:07] body see here's the thing and we'll get
[1:46:09] into this in a little bit if it's purely
[1:46:12] selfish it's not God's will if it only
[1:46:15] benefits you it's not God's will CU
[1:46:18] God's got a purpose for all these things
[1:46:19] and it's for a body amen he says brother
[1:46:22] Bram said find his perfect Divine will
[1:46:24] his channel to walk in and stay there
[1:46:26] regardless of what anyone says to do it
[1:46:29] that's simply put but it's harder to put
[1:46:30] into practice as we're talking about how
[1:46:33] do I find God's will for my life and
[1:46:34] brother B said pray and wait and wait
[1:46:37] and wait and wait amen and too often I
[1:46:40] find what we're doing is we're resting
[1:46:41] on the fact that we are a child of God
[1:46:44] we've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:45] we've received an end time message and
[1:46:47] we believe that because of that
[1:46:48] everything we do will be
[1:46:50] blessed that's never that's never in the
[1:46:52] scripture
[1:46:54] it's not there just because you sit in a
[1:46:56] certain place sit under a certain
[1:46:57] Ministry just because you're a a holy
[1:47:00] ghost filled child of God does not mean
[1:47:01] that anything you do will be blessed
[1:47:03] you'll never find that in scripture
[1:47:05] quite the
[1:47:06] opposite quite the opposite scripture
[1:47:09] never says you'll never be sick but it
[1:47:11] says if they lay hands on them they'll
[1:47:12] recover and it doesn't say that you'll
[1:47:14] never have Financial stress but it did
[1:47:17] say I've never seen the righteous
[1:47:18] forsaken nor seed begging bread it did
[1:47:20] not say you'd never face a battle but it
[1:47:23] did say you'll be
[1:47:24] delivered
[1:47:26] amen there's a way that God works in
[1:47:28] these things and sometimes we're looking
[1:47:29] at our lives and saying why aren't I
[1:47:31] flourishing why aren't things going well
[1:47:34] well it's because God's looking at the
[1:47:36] spiritual side of us first and foremost
[1:47:38] many times and that's failing and so he
[1:47:40] can't bless us in the other ways because
[1:47:42] we're children of God anybody else he
[1:47:44] just lets them go they can do whatever
[1:47:47] they want and they will maybe flourish
[1:47:48] in those things how how often would
[1:47:49] David say why do the why do the Heathen
[1:47:52] you know get rich and do so well and I'm
[1:47:54] stuck here and running around the desert
[1:47:56] trying to keep my head on its
[1:48:01] shoulders our Soul's health is what
[1:48:03] God's looking at and if we're focused on
[1:48:05] the flesh rather than the soul guess
[1:48:07] what the flesh is going to keep
[1:48:09] suffering got to put God first in our
[1:48:12] lives and then second all even our
[1:48:13] sincerity Even in our sincerity there's
[1:48:16] still a requirement for us to seek the
[1:48:18] will of God not to presume on these
[1:48:20] things amen this is an age where
[1:48:22] everybody presum assumes I'm right and
[1:48:23] I'm good that's a lat ofy and curse
[1:48:26] isn't it and people assume these things
[1:48:28] and this is not just a mental issue it's
[1:48:29] not just a social issue but it's a
[1:48:31] spiritual issue as well well I'm a
[1:48:33] message believer I've received this end
[1:48:34] time message and we think that then all
[1:48:36] of our thoughts and our ideas and our
[1:48:37] influences are there good and right and
[1:48:39] God's obligated to bless them wrong
[1:48:43] wrong it's never been that way amen
[1:48:45] we've got to check up constantly we got
[1:48:48] to check up constantly because satanic
[1:48:49] influence tends to come in very slowly
[1:48:52] and you don't realize it often until you
[1:48:54] get to a big decision and that's when it
[1:48:56] falls
[1:48:57] apart brother Bram says it this way he
[1:49:00] says oh that's what we do sometimes we
[1:49:03] go off on a tantrum somewhere and not
[1:49:05] think about God not pray over it or ask
[1:49:07] the Lord whether we should do it or not
[1:49:09] and we find out that our supply of
[1:49:10] blessings is cut
[1:49:13] off he says then we wonder sometimes
[1:49:15] we'll wonder why I can't have no more
[1:49:16] blessings he says you don't watch and
[1:49:19] you let down in your prayer life you're
[1:49:22] not guarding
[1:49:23] in you're not keeping an eye on what's
[1:49:26] coming in and what's going out you're
[1:49:28] not tapped in to what God's trying to do
[1:49:30] on your life you're just cruising
[1:49:34] assuming
[1:49:35] presuming and guess what God says I'm
[1:49:39] going to stay here when you want to come
[1:49:42] back to me you can but you just keep
[1:49:44] cruising then when you get sick of the
[1:49:46] bruising you can come
[1:49:49] back he says you don't watch you let
[1:49:52] down in your life you say well I'm a
[1:49:53] Christian I'm a message believer he says
[1:49:56] well that's the more sign you should
[1:49:58] pray more than
[1:50:00] ever amen he says read the Bible every
[1:50:04] day pray every day church this is this
[1:50:07] is rubber meets the road
[1:50:10] Simplicity there is nothing here that
[1:50:12] not a single person in this church can
[1:50:14] do except maybe the ones that can't
[1:50:17] read and they can still pray Samuel
[1:50:20] loves to pray
[1:50:24] amen why because he's seen it as an
[1:50:26] example of what it's supposed to be
[1:50:28] where it's supposed to be in our life he
[1:50:30] says don't make any decisions too
[1:50:32] harshly or too quickly notice that
[1:50:35] harshly that's an attitude problem
[1:50:39] that's an attitude problem and it comes
[1:50:40] down to motive and
[1:50:42] objective he says don't make any
[1:50:44] decisions too harshly or too quickly
[1:50:46] without first considering God about it
[1:50:48] ask him shall I do this father ask him
[1:50:51] is it your will for me to do do this
[1:50:53] then see what the holy spirit will speak
[1:50:55] to you he might not give you a vision
[1:50:57] but he will speak in some way to you to
[1:50:59] let you
[1:51:00] know if you'll be sincere and ask him
[1:51:04] not just ask him be sincere and ask him
[1:51:07] he says then we see that when the crisis
[1:51:09] come it showed just who was down in
[1:51:11] their heart yet a Believer that's the
[1:51:14] time you get to see the true colors amen
[1:51:17] who's been praying and who hasn't who's
[1:51:18] been reading and who hasn't who's really
[1:51:20] got something in their soul and who
[1:51:21] doesn't amen reading your Bible as I
[1:51:24] said before it sets you in the mind and
[1:51:26] intentions and purpose of God and we're
[1:51:28] forgetful hearers we're forgetful
[1:51:31] hearers we're forgetful readers amen and
[1:51:33] so the more you read it prayerfully and
[1:51:34] the more you consider it the more it'll
[1:51:36] take away these thoughts and give the
[1:51:39] mind of Christ in replacement because
[1:51:40] what's happening is the washing of the
[1:51:42] word takes away the world and the
[1:51:43] influence of the world and it replaces
[1:51:45] it with deity by the word that's what
[1:51:47] you're doing is you're wanting to wash
[1:51:48] that away so that he can have the
[1:51:50] preeminence amen and that's got to be a
[1:51:52] daily thing CU Paul said I Die daily and
[1:51:54] that's what's happening with the word
[1:51:55] washing over us is it's causing that
[1:51:57] flesh to Die daily and then what happens
[1:51:59] is with that daily death comes a daily
[1:52:00] quickening as well by the Holy Spirit to
[1:52:03] make the word live inside of us notice
[1:52:05] what he says here he'll show you in some
[1:52:07] way he'll speak if you'll be sincere and
[1:52:10] ask him ask sincerely you know we spoke
[1:52:13] last service about asking for
[1:52:15] permission that's not
[1:52:17] sincerely sincerely is what do you want
[1:52:20] me to do not can I do it it amen prayer
[1:52:24] is not getting permission it's about
[1:52:26] getting direction amen permission
[1:52:29] injects us into the situation amen but
[1:52:32] Direction puts God in the driver's seat
[1:52:34] so we need to seek that direction first
[1:52:36] and foremost because permission Seekers
[1:52:38] find themselves in the permissive will
[1:52:41] of God and the person that's always
[1:52:44] affiliated with permissive will is
[1:52:45] balum and you do not want to become a
[1:52:47] balum balam was a true Prophet as in he
[1:52:50] had a true gift and by the end he's
[1:52:52] called sser he's a preacher For Hire
[1:52:54] he's a prophet For Hire that'll tell you
[1:52:56] what you want to
[1:52:57] hear that's where he went from he went
[1:53:00] from being able to get the word of God
[1:53:01] to merely being a paid guy that tell you
[1:53:04] whatever you
[1:53:06] wanted what a story of balum what a
[1:53:09] fall brother B is talking about people
[1:53:11] that seek the permissive will of God he
[1:53:13] says they remind us exactly of balum he
[1:53:15] had the prophetic office he knew the
[1:53:17] proper approach to God as demonstrated
[1:53:19] in the sacrifice of the clean beasts yet
[1:53:21] he was not a true word Prophet for when
[1:53:24] God told him not to go honor BAC with
[1:53:26] his presence he sought to go anyway for
[1:53:28] he was motivated by his Lust For Gold
[1:53:30] and
[1:53:31] Prestige catch this so God let him
[1:53:35] go the perfect will of God gave way to
[1:53:38] the permissive will of God because of
[1:53:40] the heart desire of balum God actually
[1:53:43] said go
[1:53:45] ahead go listen to the message false
[1:53:47] anointed ones anointed ones at the end
[1:53:51] time he says did God change his mind no
[1:53:54] sir God had his way regardless of balum
[1:53:57] going balam did not an know the will of
[1:53:59] God God had his way regardless it was
[1:54:02] balum who was the loser for he bypassed
[1:54:04] the word he says today we have that very
[1:54:07] same thing women preachers organization
[1:54:10] false Doctrine Etc and people worshiping
[1:54:12] God manifesting in the spirit and going
[1:54:15] right on as did balum claiming that God
[1:54:18] has spoken to them even when the
[1:54:19] commission received is opposite to to
[1:54:22] the revealed word now catch this last
[1:54:25] statement he says and I will not deny
[1:54:28] that God spoke to
[1:54:32] them he
[1:54:34] says but it was just like what he spoke
[1:54:37] to balum that second
[1:54:40] time he says as he knew that balum
[1:54:42] wanted his own heart desire above the
[1:54:44] word and he gave it to him yet all the
[1:54:46] while in the end having his own way even
[1:54:49] so God today tells folks to go ahead in
[1:54:51] their own heart's desires for they have
[1:54:53] already rejected the word he says but
[1:54:55] the will of God will be done regardless
[1:54:57] Hallelujah he says amen I hope you see
[1:55:00] this it will not only clear up much of
[1:55:02] what is seen in all ages but it will
[1:55:04] especially help in this last age which
[1:55:08] has so much manifestation and external
[1:55:11] blessings when the whole period is so
[1:55:14] against the word revealed will of God
[1:55:18] what a sad State of Affairs the lean
[1:55:20] church I am rich and increased with good
[1:55:22] and have need of nothing what
[1:55:24] manifestations and external blessings
[1:55:26] and he says and you know not that you
[1:55:27] are poor wretched miserable blind and
[1:55:29] naked and know it
[1:55:31] not
[1:55:33] amen the prophet saying here you better
[1:55:35] check why you're asking as much as
[1:55:38] you're checking what you're asking amen
[1:55:41] why because balam wasn't seeking to
[1:55:43] glorify God he said he wanted Prestige
[1:55:44] he wanted honor he wanted influence he
[1:55:46] wanted wealth amen he wanted to be a big
[1:55:48] shot and guess what there ain't no big
[1:55:51] shots in this God's the big shot and he
[1:55:54] calls the shots amen we're just his
[1:55:56] tools we're just vessels we're
[1:55:58] surrendered vessels amen all glory
[1:55:59] belongs to him and when we seek our own
[1:56:01] benefit above his then that's when we
[1:56:03] get off the rails he would say this he
[1:56:06] says You must test your motive and
[1:56:07] objective first he says first find the
[1:56:10] will of
[1:56:12] God he says and then find your
[1:56:15] objective you find the will of God then
[1:56:17] find your objective and then test your
[1:56:20] motive and see if your motive is right
[1:56:22] then as Jesus said in mark 11:24 if you
[1:56:25] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:56:27] doubt in your heart he says but as long
[1:56:29] as you've got doubt in the heart whether
[1:56:30] it's the will of God number one he says
[1:56:33] or your motive or objective is wrong he
[1:56:35] says how's it going to move he says but
[1:56:37] when you know that your motive is right
[1:56:39] and it's the will of God and your
[1:56:41] objective is right it's got to move
[1:56:43] that's all or God told something wrong
[1:56:45] and we know God doesn't tell us
[1:56:46] something wrong so therefore there must
[1:56:48] be an issue on our motive objective or
[1:56:50] finding his will amen
[1:56:53] sometimes we B at that inner type of
[1:56:56] examination I think I don't really want
[1:56:58] to look too deep sometimes we know it's
[1:57:00] there but here's the other time other
[1:57:03] side of it truly in sincerity sometimes
[1:57:06] we say if it benefits me it can't be
[1:57:07] God's will sometimes we're Catholic that
[1:57:10] way we beat ourselves up that if
[1:57:13] anything for me is good for me out of
[1:57:16] this then then I must be wrong my motive
[1:57:18] and objective must be wrong no not NE
[1:57:21] not necessarily that's for sure if all
[1:57:23] we want is our
[1:57:25] benefit we're
[1:57:27] wrong
[1:57:30] totally but if I get a benefit and the
[1:57:32] body of Christ gets a benefit and my
[1:57:34] intent is to benefit you first and
[1:57:36] foremost as the body of Christ then yes
[1:57:39] that's fine I get tremendous
[1:57:42] satisfaction out of ministry it's a ton
[1:57:44] of work it is a stress but it's
[1:57:47] something that that that's in me to do
[1:57:49] and it it's a tremendous thing it's a
[1:57:51] tremendous benefit to me to do that but
[1:57:54] if I'm only in it for me it's going to
[1:57:56] fail every time but I do benefit from it
[1:57:59] Amen brother B said check find your
[1:58:01] objective and test your motive what is
[1:58:04] your objective that's your goal it's
[1:58:07] your true purpose and it's your desired
[1:58:09] impact so what do you want to happen as
[1:58:12] a as a as a preacher as a minister my
[1:58:14] objective cannot be to make the people
[1:58:18] shout it cannot be to have the altar
[1:58:20] full of people it has to be Lord that
[1:58:23] your word would find good ground and
[1:58:26] produce
[1:58:27] life because if all we're looking for is
[1:58:29] the
[1:58:30] appearance then we'll be satisfied with
[1:58:33] anything but if we're looking for the
[1:58:35] real thing then we know that comes with
[1:58:38] patience it comes with the hard work of
[1:58:40] sewing and watering and then reaping
[1:58:43] amen I can't force
[1:58:46] God I had a brother say one
[1:58:49] time we had a tremendous service and he
[1:58:51] said say wait till the next
[1:58:54] service and something struck me wrong
[1:58:56] about what he
[1:58:57] said and I said well I'm just going to I
[1:58:59] just want to see what happens and you
[1:59:01] know what that next service
[1:59:03] flopped and this is just
[1:59:05] me I felt there was an arrogance behind
[1:59:10] it God showed me what's going to happen
[1:59:12] here's what's going to happen I know
[1:59:13] what's going to and you know what
[1:59:15] nothing
[1:59:16] happened it's not about me it's not
[1:59:19] about the ministry it's about the God
[1:59:21] that's work working in US it has to
[1:59:24] be amen objective goal the true purpose
[1:59:27] what you really want to happen the
[1:59:29] desired impact then the motive is the
[1:59:31] reason behind your request why do you
[1:59:34] want this why do you want it to happen
[1:59:36] simple
[1:59:37] example pick on our singers and
[1:59:39] musicians this morning you say Lord
[1:59:42] should I sing a song in service on
[1:59:43] Sunday and you pray about it you pray
[1:59:46] about it and the Lord said and you feel
[1:59:47] that the Lord wants you to sing a song
[1:59:49] remember we're supposed to use our gifts
[1:59:51] as we're led to use them
[1:59:52] amen but let's not get so spiritual we
[1:59:54] never use them but the Lord hasn't shown
[1:59:57] me to do it start seeking because he
[1:59:59] doesn't give us a gift so we don't use
[2:00:00] it then seek his time seek his his his
[2:00:03] way of doing these things so God's shown
[2:00:05] you his will his will is for you to sing
[2:00:07] a song he wants you to go up there amen
[2:00:09] but now you're supposed to check what's
[2:00:11] behind that question why did you say
[2:00:13] Lord should I sing a song on Sunday amen
[2:00:16] what's your objective what do you want
[2:00:17] to happen if if you sing do you want
[2:00:19] people to give you compliments do you
[2:00:21] want want to show somebody
[2:00:23] up do you want to get in the spotlight
[2:00:25] do you want to attract a young man or a
[2:00:27] young woman do you want to put it up on
[2:00:29] social media so you can get lots of
[2:00:31] likes if that's your objective guess
[2:00:34] what's going to happen probably all of
[2:00:36] those things and nothing of Eternal
[2:00:38] benefit or god'll just let you
[2:00:42] flop
[2:00:44] amen but if your objective is to glorify
[2:00:47] him to testify to thank to give him the
[2:00:52] preeminence to encourage to set an
[2:00:55] atmosphere now you've got the right
[2:00:57] objective don't you but now he says
[2:00:59] what's your motive what are you as you
[2:01:02] know why are you asking God if you
[2:01:03] should sing is it because you want
[2:01:05] recognition is it because you're trying
[2:01:07] to show somebody up is it because you
[2:01:08] want to be popular you want to be
[2:01:10] recognized or is it for the benefit of
[2:01:12] the body of Believers that are there
[2:01:15] because if you can say Lord you know my
[2:01:17] heart and say Lord I'm doing this for
[2:01:20] you cuz guess what it it ain't always
[2:01:22] easy to get up here some people do it
[2:01:24] really easily and some don't and there's
[2:01:25] a real sacrifice that comes behind those
[2:01:28] things but you say Lord I'm in it
[2:01:30] because you want me to do it because a
[2:01:33] lot of times you'll find with these
[2:01:34] gifts is that they don't really want to
[2:01:36] they don't always feel up to it I hope
[2:01:39] sister Marine's okay with me saying this
[2:01:40] but she's had times where she didn't
[2:01:41] feel she should be up there but the Lord
[2:01:43] told her to do it and so she did it and
[2:01:46] it was a tremendous blessing there's a
[2:01:47] blessing in obedience Church absolutely
[2:01:51] we don't always feel anointed but if
[2:01:53] we're in in under his call then we know
[2:01:55] that it's going to happen
[2:01:56] amen gifts are not about perfection
[2:01:59] unless you're prophesying prophecy has
[2:02:01] to be perfect but gifts are not about
[2:02:03] perfection gifts are about anointing and
[2:02:06] it's anointing on the giver and it's an
[2:02:07] anointing on the receiver and if they're
[2:02:09] both anointed then something something
[2:02:11] Supernatural is going to happen and then
[2:02:13] because it's God that's working now it's
[2:02:14] a vessel that's yielded amen when you
[2:02:16] you're you're coming in God's will and
[2:02:18] you're in God's Channel and you're and
[2:02:19] you're setting yourself aside and you've
[2:02:21] got the right m an objective that's when
[2:02:23] God can really use people amen I don't
[2:02:25] know if you've noticed this but not
[2:02:26] every special song is
[2:02:31] perfect sometimes people cry a lot when
[2:02:34] they sing right sister
[2:02:36] Priscilla she beats herself up about it
[2:02:40] sometimes those are the greatest
[2:02:41] blessings we
[2:02:42] have is that heart that says I'll praise
[2:02:46] you I'll Trust you I'll worship you even
[2:02:51] in the midst of the storm even when the
[2:02:53] battle's Raging even when the answer
[2:02:55] doesn't seem to be there amen it's not
[2:02:58] about perfection it's about anointing
[2:03:00] it's about surrender amen that's what it
[2:03:03] is the thing to check is what brother
[2:03:05] Bram saying here is what is your purpose
[2:03:08] in the kingdom of God for doing what
[2:03:10] you're doing because if there's no
[2:03:12] Kingdom Purpose why are we doing it in
[2:03:14] the first
[2:03:15] place Brothers your kingdom purpose is
[2:03:18] to provide for your family but it needs
[2:03:20] to be according to God's will
[2:03:22] we get educated according to God's will
[2:03:24] or we don't according to God's will
[2:03:26] there are things we have to do but let's
[2:03:27] not let's not just make it about a job
[2:03:29] let's not just make it about an
[2:03:30] education let's not just make it about a
[2:03:32] career or a house or these things but
[2:03:33] say Lord how would you glorify your
[2:03:36] kingdom and your people with what I'm
[2:03:38] about to do when we bought our house we
[2:03:41] bought a bigger house than I ever wanted
[2:03:43] for the specific reason that we knew
[2:03:46] that we were going to have to open it up
[2:03:47] for Fellowship not that we had to it's
[2:03:49] not that we didn't want to but we
[2:03:51] literally bought the house we did for
[2:03:53] the sake of having people over cuz
[2:03:56] otherwise i' I prefer a smaller one it's
[2:03:58] easier to clean easier to maintain and
[2:03:59] it's cheaper to buy as well but we
[2:04:01] bought it with the intent of using it
[2:04:03] for the sake of the body not just for
[2:04:05] ourselves amen the question is does it
[2:04:08] glorify God or does it glorify you and
[2:04:11] if it's all about you walk away very
[2:04:13] very quickly lay it down lay it down
[2:04:16] that's really what we do amen listen
[2:04:17] when God is truly using men and women it
[2:04:20] brings attention
[2:04:22] and the thing is what do you do with
[2:04:23] that attention what do you do with that
[2:04:25] influence what do you do with that
[2:04:27] Spotlight do you point it right back to
[2:04:28] him or do you leverage it for
[2:04:30] yourself that's easy way it's an easy
[2:04:33] way to look at it brother puts it this
[2:04:35] way we're almost done he says then
[2:04:37] what's your objective in doing it if
[2:04:39] it's selfish you'll never get it done
[2:04:42] that's
[2:04:43] all he says it's got to be real Clean
[2:04:45] and Clear before God or it just won't
[2:04:48] happen that's all he says you have to
[2:04:50] always keep that on your mind that it's
[2:04:52] got to be clean and clear your cups must
[2:04:55] be clean and clear before God or God
[2:04:58] cannot work with you now see that can
[2:05:00] feel like a lot of
[2:05:03] pressure we can we can put that into
[2:05:05] this sphere of perfection we can work
[2:05:06] ourselves into a place that we won't
[2:05:08] make a decision because we're scared
[2:05:10] that things aren't perfect or things
[2:05:11] aren't perfectly clean or
[2:05:13] clear and then we get paralyzed and the
[2:05:15] problem with that is that it's fear
[2:05:17] that's doing that and fear is never of
[2:05:18] God that's not that's not righteous fear
[2:05:21] that's that's satanic fear that holds
[2:05:23] you in a place where you can't make a
[2:05:25] decision you can't move God's not
[2:05:26] looking to put us under his thumb God's
[2:05:29] just asking us to yield to him that's
[2:05:31] all he's looking for amen God looks at
[2:05:33] the heart that's the beauty of all this
[2:05:35] God looks at the heart God looks at the
[2:05:36] Integrity of the heart where remember
[2:05:38] what he said to Solomon he said if
[2:05:39] you'll walk before me as your father
[2:05:41] David did in Integrity of heart he
[2:05:44] didn't say David was perfect David was
[2:05:47] clearly not perfect murdered another man
[2:05:49] for his wife he numbered Israel caused
[2:05:51] the death of what 25,000 people David
[2:05:54] was not perfect but in his heart God
[2:05:56] said he's just like me there's an
[2:05:59] Integrity there's a sincerity there's an
[2:06:01] honesty there there's a purity of
[2:06:02] purpose in David's heart that lets me
[2:06:05] know that he loves me even when he makes
[2:06:08] mistakes amen that's what God's looking
[2:06:11] at remember what brother Bram said if we
[2:06:13] in sincerity make a wrong decision God
[2:06:15] will come right around and he'll say no
[2:06:16] no no come over here do this let's fix
[2:06:19] this up this isn't quite what I was
[2:06:20] looking for
[2:06:22] and then we don't always go to our kids
[2:06:23] if we see our kid I've told the story
[2:06:25] many times of one of my children who
[2:06:27] shall not be named who wrote Love in the
[2:06:30] side of the car with a
[2:06:34] rock what do you do with that in
[2:06:38] sincerity and integrity of heart that
[2:06:40] person that young child who knew no
[2:06:43] better wrote it so did I take that
[2:06:45] person over my knee and just beat the
[2:06:47] living toar out of them no what did I
[2:06:51] say
[2:06:52] Daddy's glad you love him just don't
[2:06:54] ride it on the car with a rock anymore
[2:06:56] right in sincerity they did it and in
[2:07:00] Integrity of heart I responded the way
[2:07:02] that I knew they meant it just said
[2:07:04] let's not do that anymore let's not do
[2:07:06] that
[2:07:07] anymore and they didn't they didn't God
[2:07:11] wants to be with us church he wants to
[2:07:13] work with us he wants to work through us
[2:07:14] he's not seeking to punish
[2:07:17] us he's just looking for yielded vessels
[2:07:20] people that'll seek Him daily da people
[2:07:22] that will commune with him daily people
[2:07:23] that will invite him in Daily and in
[2:07:26] that we'll find his will for our lives
[2:07:28] he promises it if you seek me you'll
[2:07:31] find me when you seek me with your whole
[2:07:33] heart I'll show you a plain path amen
[2:07:37] one last quote as we close the musicians
[2:07:40] can come he says so we really believe
[2:07:42] that God never changes his mind about
[2:07:44] what he said he always keeps it true but
[2:07:47] he has a permissive will now there is
[2:07:49] where the trouble is we try to work on
[2:07:50] God's permissive will and he will permit
[2:07:52] it but also if we take his permissive
[2:07:55] will though it's not right he will make
[2:07:57] his permissive will to work out together
[2:08:00] to glorify his perfect will amen even
[2:08:04] balam and his Disobedience could only
[2:08:05] bless Israel with his prophetic
[2:08:08] gift but then he used his knowledge of
[2:08:10] their weakness to come in and what get
[2:08:12] an angle that they couldn't protect
[2:08:14] against that's where he lost
[2:08:16] it he says there is nothing will go
[2:08:18] wrong with God you say Brother John I
[2:08:21] know I made
[2:08:22] mistakes and I'm scared I'm going to
[2:08:24] keep making them he says there is
[2:08:27] nothing will go wrong with God he knows
[2:08:31] just where the clock is ticking at
[2:08:33] tonight there's nothing wrong look at
[2:08:36] your life look at your situations Church
[2:08:38] let's stand together if we would look at
[2:08:39] your situations and say it doesn't look
[2:08:43] right and you're wondering do I am I in
[2:08:45] his will am I not it seems like I'm not
[2:08:47] it seems like I'm struggling more than
[2:08:49] I'm winning it seems like I'm defeated
[2:08:50] more than I'm inct Victory he says
[2:08:52] there's nothing will go wrong with God
[2:08:55] he knows just where the clock is ticking
[2:08:57] at tonight there's nothing wrong he says
[2:09:00] every lick is hitting just the way
[2:09:03] exactly it should be everything he says
[2:09:07] we think it's wrong but he knows it's
[2:09:09] right it's supposed to be like this
[2:09:16] amen we take some inventory this morning
[2:09:24] how many's facing a
[2:09:26] battle how many's in a struggle this
[2:09:28] morning 10 of
[2:09:31] us the rest of you are going to be in
[2:09:33] one very shortly
[2:09:35] then but we struggle we fight we seek we
[2:09:41] ask we knock we pray we
[2:09:47] plead it seems like things just
[2:09:50] spiral so many times that's the trial of
[2:09:53] our
[2:09:55] faith it's a very it's the very
[2:09:58] foundation of the believer if you
[2:09:59] remember his faith then to you had
[2:10:02] virtue strength to hold on strength to
[2:10:05] hold to what he's given you amen but he
[2:10:09] says every lick is hitting just exactly
[2:10:11] the way it should be we think it's wrong
[2:10:15] but he knows it's right why he's got it
[2:10:17] all in control he sees the way this is
[2:10:19] going I think that's the reason that
[2:10:20] Satan thinks he can win is because it
[2:10:22] looks like he's winning more than he's
[2:10:23] losing and then what happens is God
[2:10:26] finally comes down and he says enough is
[2:10:30] enough and magically Satan has no power
[2:10:32] anymore he has no access anymore and the
[2:10:36] thing that you thought would hold you
[2:10:38] down cannot even be seen remember what
[2:10:41] the scripture talks about when we
[2:10:42] finally look at Satan in his
[2:10:44] Incarnation says we're going to look
[2:10:46] narrowly on him and say is this the man
[2:10:49] is this the thing that we were so scared
[2:10:51] of
[2:10:51] about cuz he's just a puny little
[2:10:54] shriveled up little
[2:10:56] weasel and the youngest weakest
[2:10:59] Christian has more than enough strength
[2:11:01] by the Holy Ghost to defeat that devil
[2:11:04] but we got to fight be brave against all
[2:11:06] evil never run or even lag behind if we
[2:11:10] would win for God in the right keep on
[2:11:12] the firing line amen I'm encouraging you
[2:11:14] this morning keep on the firing line
[2:11:16] even when it looks like nothing's
[2:11:18] happening say Lord I believe you Lord I
