[38:39] Lord to walk in Victory to walk in faith
[38:42] or to walk an overcoming power Lord not

[38:46] we step outside those doors Lord when

[39:00] Heavenly Father Lord looking to the end

[39:09] higher this morning heavenly father

[39:12] Lord and by the going forth of your word
[39:14] we pray Lord minister to hearts and
[39:17] souls remembering those Lord many not
[39:18] here this morning Lord my family brother
[39:21] Chad sister Leah Lord Brother Gerald
[39:23] sister Betty Lord the different ones
[39:25] Lord we pray your mercy and Grace to
[39:27] them each one Lord and bless us now we
[39:29] pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[39:32] amen
[39:34] may God bless you if you turn in the
[39:35] scriptures to Galatians 3 this morning
[39:38] amen I thought I heard brother Ellie's
[39:40] voice out there and sure enough when I
[39:42] came out there he is so it's good to see
[39:43] him amen God bless you
[39:44] amen I know there's many await today and
[39:47] sick and traveling and whatnot but uh
[39:49] good to have us all back in the service
[39:52] this morning amen
[39:54] and then Galatians chapter 3 and we'll
[39:56] start at verse 26 Galatians 3 and 26.
[40:07] for ye are all the children of God by
[40:11] faith in Christ Jesus
[40:13] for as many of you as have been baptized
[40:15] into Christ have put on Christ
[40:18] there's neither there's neither Jew nor
[40:20] Greek there's neither Bond nor free
[40:23] there is neither male nor female for ye
[40:26] are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be
[40:29] Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and
[40:32] heirs according to the promise amen God
[40:35] bless you you can have your seats this
[40:37] morning and we are continuing our series
[40:39] on Redemption this morning and we're
[40:41] kind of getting to the to the end as we
[40:43] start to cross over into Canaan so to
[40:45] speak and we've got a little ways to go
[40:48] and we'll be talking about things like
[40:49] adoption and overcoming power in a
[40:52] Victorious Life and these different
[40:53] things but these are all kind of part
[40:56] and parcel of what's inside of what that
[40:58] promised land is and what it represents
[41:00] for the believer what we want to realize
[41:02] in all of this is that we're going back
[41:04] to what belongs to us that's what this
[41:06] is all about is we're painting a picture
[41:08] of what it means to not just be a
[41:10] believer but what it means to have what
[41:11] a Believer has and to experience the
[41:13] reality that it is to be a believer so I
[41:16] want to kind of springboard off the last
[41:17] serve person take a last time we spoke
[41:20] of of your your land of promise and then
[41:22] today I'm going to say our promised land
[41:24] so I want to bring it to where we are in
[41:26] this age and in this time and and I will
[41:28] read some quotes this morning but I want
[41:30] to preach it out of the scriptures this
[41:31] morning to really set a scripture
[41:33] balance for it so that we know that
[41:35] we're not just just taking the words of
[41:37] a man so to speak but we're basing it on
[41:39] the word of God Amen
[41:41] and we've spoken at length of how
[41:43] Redemption takes you out of something
[41:44] and it's a wonderful thing and so many
[41:46] people stop just at the taking out and
[41:49] they get that freedom and justification
[41:50] and and under their their sins are under
[41:53] the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary and
[41:56] and the guilt is stripped away and they
[41:58] say that's good I'm I'm happy with that
[42:00] and they go out and they live the exact
[42:01] same life they've always lived but
[42:03] without the guilt but that's not what
[42:05] God that's not what the full Redemption
[42:07] process looks like and we know there was
[42:09] the desert portion that's a time of
[42:10] Separation that's a time of
[42:12] sanctification it's a time of taking you
[42:14] away from the things that have affected
[42:16] you for so long but again that's not the
[42:18] end of redemption but as we start to now
[42:20] come up to Jordan and to cross over to
[42:22] Canaan now we're getting into what it
[42:24] means to be redeemed because now we're
[42:25] getting back to where we belong we're
[42:28] getting back to the position that we
[42:29] were promised in the first place we're
[42:31] getting back to relationship and all
[42:33] these things and that's the fullness of
[42:34] redemption and the day of our Redemption
[42:36] will never happen on this Earth
[42:38] the Redemption happens when we cross
[42:40] over to the other side to that marriage
[42:42] supper of the lamb but everything here
[42:43] is building up to that climax which is
[42:45] the rapture and it is the resurrection
[42:47] and that's really the proof of of who is
[42:49] redeemed and who is truly a child of God
[42:51] and who isn't amen but Redemption is
[42:54] always always always about taking you
[42:57] back to where you belong
[42:59] so if you stop along the way you can't
[43:01] be Redemption and then you've got to
[43:03] keep going until you get to where you
[43:05] were in the beginning amen redemptions
[43:07] of restoration process that puts you
[43:09] back to your original position and when
[43:11] he gets you into your position then you
[43:13] have possession of all the things that
[43:15] come with that position but he's got to
[43:17] get you into your original position and
[43:19] that's easy for us to forget as
[43:20] Christians because so often what we
[43:22] really seek are the benefits
[43:24] you know we're sitting here and and
[43:25] we're sick and so we desire healing we
[43:27] have needs and so we desire provision
[43:29] and and we have problems and so we we
[43:31] seek deliverance and we start to seek
[43:34] after those things but what we need to
[43:36] really recognize is who we are and if we
[43:38] recognize who we are then we'll
[43:40] recognize and have the benefits that
[43:41] come with who we are this morning amen
[43:43] if we're put in our proper position then
[43:46] the possessions will follow but if
[43:48] you're not in your right position then
[43:50] all you are is a gold digger you know
[43:52] like you're seeking after God for the
[43:53] things that he has amen rather than who
[43:56] you are in him
[43:58] and so you've got to recognize who you
[44:00] are so what that means to me as a
[44:01] Believer right now is that the greatest
[44:03] thing I need is a revelation of who I am
[44:06] that's what I need to know is who I am
[44:08] in Christ in the context of God not in
[44:11] the context of whom my father or my
[44:12] mother is or what Ministry I was raised
[44:14] under or where I live or what my job is
[44:16] but who I am in Christ is the greatest
[44:19] Revelation that I have in need of this
[44:21] morning amen I don't need a revelation
[44:23] of healing if I don't have a revelation
[44:25] that healing is for me
[44:27] you've got to be able to read this Bible
[44:28] and say this is speaking to me and this
[44:31] is speaking of me and therefore based on
[44:34] that I am a child of God and therefore I
[44:37] have all that the Bible says that I have
[44:39] but if you don't believe that that Bible
[44:41] is talking about you you'll never get
[44:42] healing you'll never get Deliverance
[44:44] you'll never get provisioned because you
[44:46] don't realize it's talking to you and
[44:48] you'll read the Bible until you're blue
[44:49] in the face and it won't have any effect
[44:51] on you but as soon as you realize I am a
[44:53] child of God
[44:55] and it is talking to me and it is
[44:57] speaking of me now you can start to say
[44:59] what this is mine and this is me and now
[45:02] you can start to take possession of
[45:03] these things but as I was studying that
[45:05] because
[45:07] I I know there's more for us
[45:09] I know there's more for me
[45:11] I believe there's more in in Christ than
[45:13] what we have here today and that's not
[45:15] to put down what we have but it's to say
[45:17] let's keep moving forward and if I'm
[45:19] going to keep forward moving forward
[45:21] what is it that's going to draw me into
[45:23] that
[45:23] what is it that's going to bring me into
[45:25] a greater revelation of who I am in
[45:27] Christ
[45:28] and I ask myself that question I think
[45:30] we need to ask ourselves that question
[45:31] is what is it that's drawing us forward
[45:34] or what is it that's holding us back
[45:36] because I want to be moving forward
[45:37] every day I want to be moving forward if
[45:39] it's only one step I want to move
[45:41] forward every day and I went back and
[45:43] brother Branham says this
[45:45] he says you know there's something about
[45:47] getting a loan to yourself
[45:50] it's one of the hardest things to do
[45:51] today
[45:52] especially speaking to to our couples
[45:55] that have children the hardest thing to
[45:57] do is get time alone
[46:00] he says many people never pray until
[46:02] they come to church
[46:04] many people think that the only place to
[46:07] pray is at church but the Bible said for
[46:09] men to pray everywhere lifting up holy
[46:11] hands and then when we get by ourself
[46:14] we'll usually pray different than what
[46:16] we would if we prayed in church
[46:19] it's the secret prayer that Jesus spoke
[46:22] of saying enter ye into a secret closet
[46:25] and close the door and when you have
[46:27] done so pray to your father who sees in
[46:29] secret then he that seeth in secret
[46:31] shall reward thee openly
[46:34] we have to have a place where we can
[46:36] pray in secret and it's just us and him
[46:40] he says and when we're praying like that
[46:42] there seems to be something to the
[46:45] prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out
[46:47] of it
[46:48] because what you don't have to have a
[46:50] facade with God because if you know he's
[46:52] there you know he sees right through it
[46:55] he sees right through everything that we
[46:57] throw up every every bit of spirituality
[46:59] that that we posture in front of him he
[47:01] sees through it and he sees right to the
[47:03] heart and he sees right through to the
[47:05] nature and the motives and the
[47:06] objectives and you'll never that it'll
[47:09] be like you're praying with a with a
[47:11] brass ceiling above you if you go in
[47:13] there and you try and posture in front
[47:15] of God
[47:16] but brother bam says when you get there
[47:17] and you really start talking to God it
[47:20] takes the hypocrisy out of it you don't
[47:22] pretend what you're not anymore
[47:24] you're just stripped down to who you are
[47:27] and you break down and you say Lord here
[47:29] I am again
[47:30] and I'm in need
[47:32] and I'm looking for more and I have need
[47:34] of more and I need answers and I need
[47:36] leadership and I need guidance and all
[47:38] of a sudden you stop pretending that you
[47:40] have all the answers and you start to
[47:42] realize you're in the presence of the
[47:43] one that has the answers and that's
[47:46] where your need is going to be supplied
[47:48] he says it seems like that we get a
[47:50] better connection with God to get alone
[47:54] and there's been many times in my life
[47:56] whereas perhaps in your life that you
[47:58] just have to get alone once in a while
[48:00] with Jesus
[48:01] and I this is a cut down quote I hope
[48:04] you don't mind because he talked about
[48:05] I'll get out in the mountains he says
[48:07] and they think I'm going to hunt he says
[48:09] but I'm going out there to get alone
[48:11] with God to get away from it all
[48:14] he says and then you just have to
[48:16] sometimes sit out there on a rock and
[48:18] just talk to him
[48:19] he says oh for those precious hours
[48:22] alone with God and it's there that when
[48:25] the greatest Revelation and inspiration
[48:28] comes is when we're alone with God
[48:32] you say brother John that ought to be
[48:34] under the preaching of the word
[48:35] hey there's a lot happens in services
[48:38] and you've got to be sitting under the
[48:40] preaching of the word but you've got to
[48:42] have your time alone with God as well
[48:43] where he can work with you as an
[48:45] individual he says the greatest
[48:47] Revelation and inspiration comes when
[48:49] we're alone with God we take more time
[48:51] on that I'm sure that we would live a
[48:54] better life a more Victorious Life In
[48:58] Christ so real prayer time matters
[49:00] Church
[49:01] now that this is down where you live
[49:04] soft this is simple but you know what I
[49:06] love about simple it's doable it's
[49:09] doable you know what we do so many times
[49:11] is we do three amazing things a year and
[49:14] expect it to have this great impact and
[49:16] guess what it doesn't and it won't
[49:19] that's what happens with people that'll
[49:20] go to two or three camps of special
[49:22] means a year and that's supposed to
[49:24] sustain their spirituality and their
[49:26] walk with Christ for the year it will
[49:28] not work it is the habitual life of the
[49:30] believer in constant communion with
[49:33] Christ that will give you the overcoming
[49:35] power that you seek that'll give you the
[49:37] direction that will give you the
[49:38] leadership in your life
[49:40] we duck away from the little thing every
[49:42] day and then we try and do the amazing
[49:44] thing once or twice or three times a
[49:45] year that's never going to work
[49:48] it's never going to work that has to be
[49:50] a daily thing that we're doing amen
[49:53] brother Brown says Oh how we need
[49:55] Revelation by the spirit we don't need a
[49:58] new Bible we don't need a new
[50:00] translation though some of them are very
[50:01] good and I'm not against them but we
[50:03] need the revelation of the spirit and
[50:06] thank God we can have what we need
[50:09] what is your need this morning he says
[50:12] you can have we can have what we need
[50:14] for God wants to reveal his word to us
[50:17] by his Spirit God's wanting to reveal
[50:19] himself to us
[50:21] he wants to do it so the only thing that
[50:23] will hold it back is you
[50:25] that's the only thing brother Bob said
[50:27] God wants to heal you more than you want
[50:29] to be healed God wants to bless you more
[50:32] than he you want to be blessed God is
[50:34] just waiting to pour it out upon his
[50:36] people that will call on his name and
[50:38] ask for it
[50:39] he says God wants to reveal his word to
[50:42] us by his Spirit may God begin to give
[50:45] his Spirit to do what to give us
[50:48] continuous
[50:50] life-giving and prevailing Revelation
[50:53] all if the church could only get a fresh
[50:56] Revelation and become by it the Living
[50:59] Word manifested we would do the Greater
[51:02] Works and glorify Our God in heaven oh I
[51:05] love that continuous life-giving and
[51:08] prevailing Revelation I need more
[51:10] continuous
[51:11] I need a day in and a day out not an ups
[51:14] and not a Downs not a back and not a
[51:16] fourth but just straight as an arrow I'm
[51:19] going through every single day that's
[51:21] what I'm seeking in my life day in and
[51:23] day out more of it if I take one step
[51:26] today tomorrow I want two steps and the
[51:28] next day I want three steps and building
[51:30] and growing and building momentum where
[51:32] Satan can hold me back where Satan can't
[51:34] hold you back where you're pressing
[51:36] forward continuously what is it it's
[51:39] life-giving and prevailing Revelation
[51:41] overcoming power
[51:45] not being held back by circumstances not
[51:47] being held back by by the symptoms that
[51:50] we face in our life amen but it's a
[51:52] winning
[51:53] believer
[51:54] day in and day out
[51:57] amen
[52:00] we're talking about our promised land
[52:01] this morning I want to Anchor this in
[52:04] because everything here
[52:06] you can do everything you can accept him
[52:08] as your savior you can walk through the
[52:10] desert you can go through justification
[52:11] justification sanctification but if you
[52:14] don't go into the promised land you fall
[52:16] short of the grace of God the full grace
[52:19] of God if I can put it because it's
[52:20] three works of Grace justification
[52:22] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[52:24] Spirit but if you only do the first two
[52:26] you fall short of his grace his grace
[52:29] doesn't fall short you fall short of it
[52:31] because you won't go all the way brother
[52:32] Brown says that's the problem is that
[52:34] they always turn back
[52:36] I don't want to be one of those that
[52:38] turn back amen we're not scripture says
[52:40] we are not of them that turn back indeed
[52:43] amen so I don't want to scare you this
[52:45] morning and say you're not going to make
[52:47] it I'm saying keep pressing keep pushing
[52:49] keep walking keep crying out keep
[52:51] praying keep expecting keep looking to
[52:53] God for these things amen keep believing
[52:56] I'm going to open up again with our
[52:58] original scripture in Galatians 3 it
[53:00] says for ye are all the children of God
[53:03] by faith in Christ Jesus now I want you
[53:06] to recognize one thing because we're
[53:07] talking about our promised land and we
[53:09] know it's an inheritance and we'll get
[53:10] into that a little later it's an
[53:12] inheritance and you don't get an
[53:13] inheritance because of what you do
[53:17] you get an inheritance Because of Who
[53:19] You Are
[53:20] that is what we have to realize and
[53:22] that's why I was talking about that need
[53:24] for a greater revelation of who we are
[53:26] in Christ because if our inheritance is
[53:28] in him we need to recognize who we are
[53:30] and recognize that what we have is
[53:32] because of what who our parents are who
[53:35] our parent is not because of what we do
[53:39] listen I do believe that most parents
[53:42] are wise and if they set up a will so
[53:43] that when they die then certain kids get
[53:45] certain things guess what they give more
[53:47] to the good kids because the good kids
[53:49] can handle it
[53:50] and the not so good kids usually have
[53:53] some restrictions or they get a little
[53:54] less and guess what it's no different
[53:56] with Christians some bring full 34 some
[53:58] 60 foot some 100 full right God gives
[54:00] things to the ones that he can trust
[54:02] more but etch each and every child of
[54:04] God has an inheritance each and everyone
[54:07] has an inheritance and it's it's really
[54:09] up to us how much we'll limit those
[54:10] things I think but we have an
[54:12] inheritance from our natural parents not
[54:14] because of what we've done but because
[54:15] of what they've done
[54:17] because they put in the sweat they put
[54:19] in the blood they put in the tears and
[54:21] that's what Christ did for us is he did
[54:22] the work to get what an inheritance for
[54:25] us so what we get is not because of what
[54:27] we're done we've done or what we're
[54:29] going to do but it's because of what has
[54:31] already been done a work that's already
[54:33] been done and it's been set aside for us
[54:35] and we just have to step into it amen
[54:37] and Paul's saying here what look at who
[54:40] your daddy is
[54:42] because if you recognize who your father
[54:43] is if you recognize who your dad is
[54:45] you'll recognize what sort of an
[54:46] inheritance you're supposed to be
[54:48] looking for amen why because Godly Cho
[54:51] the children of God get what a Godly
[54:53] inheritance
[54:55] so don't go looking around this world
[54:56] for your inheritance that's not it our
[54:59] attorneys our inheritance comes from
[55:01] Eternal God so it's going to be an
[55:03] eternal inheritance our our inheritance
[55:05] comes from a supernatural God so it's
[55:07] going to be a supernatural inheritance
[55:09] so we don't preach a gospel of wealth
[55:12] and great things in this world but we
[55:14] what we seek a city that is to come
[55:16] because that's where the fullness of our
[55:18] inheritance is and brother Brown will go
[55:20] over on the other side and his
[55:22] inheritance was what
[55:24] those that he saved those that he
[55:26] brought to Christ that was his
[55:27] inheritance all that loved you and all
[55:29] you ever loved will be there that was
[55:32] his inheritance and he says there was
[55:33] Millions
[55:34] Millions over there that he was going to
[55:37] what introduced to God that he was gonna
[55:39] he was going to bring us his
[55:40] representation as his his sacrifice amen
[55:44] listen all of it he says here starts
[55:46] with faith in Christ Jesus and each and
[55:49] every one of us that's the confession of
[55:51] the Believers that I am doing this by
[55:53] faith in the finished work of calvary
[55:55] that's the starting point for every
[55:56] single one of us there is no other
[55:58] starting place but Calvary it has to be
[56:01] there it doesn't start with the message
[56:02] of the hour
[56:04] that's not it
[56:05] you've skipped you've skipped to the end
[56:08] you skip to what the holy spirit will
[56:10] lead you into and you make that your
[56:11] Calvary you will not make it because
[56:14] it's an idol then you've got to start at
[56:16] Calvary you've got to repent you've got
[56:18] to get down confess your sins and what
[56:20] accept the finished work of Calvary and
[56:22] then after that everything will follow
[56:24] that he promised amen listen our part is
[56:27] to confess that Faith but that is not
[56:29] the finish and that is not what makes us
[56:31] children of God because there are
[56:32] millions and millions professing
[56:34] Believers that have knelt there at an
[56:36] altar or maybe stood in their seat and
[56:37] prayed a sinner's prayer and they took
[56:39] that finished work of Calvary and they
[56:40] stopped there and there are no more
[56:42] children of God than Esau was
[56:45] it's the truth remember Jacob and Esau
[56:48] came from the same family but only one
[56:49] of them was a child of God
[56:51] why because only one of them would do
[56:53] what the word said to do
[56:54] but watch this sequence because this is
[56:56] a this is pointing us back to what it
[56:58] looks like uh in our promised land and
[57:01] it's our inheritance he says in verse 27
[57:03] for as many of you has been baptized
[57:05] into Christ have put on Christ now we
[57:08] see there's a baptism but this is not a
[57:10] water baptism
[57:11] right he says we're baptizing to Christ
[57:13] but we'll see that there's a specific
[57:15] baptism that's required verse 28 says
[57:17] for there's neither June or Greek
[57:19] there's neither Bond nor free there's
[57:20] neither male nor female for ye are all
[57:23] one in Christ Jesus
[57:25] uh I was talking to my wife about this I
[57:27] says we have a true Multicultural church
[57:29] now
[57:31] we have all colors we have all ages we
[57:33] have people from every region we've got
[57:35] the whole thing and the beautiful thing
[57:36] about this scripture is it says every
[57:38] one of us is the same every one of us is
[57:40] a part of the body of Christ there is no
[57:42] limitation in Christ because you're a
[57:44] woman or because you're a man because
[57:46] you're a boy or a girl because you're
[57:47] black or white or yellow or purple or
[57:49] whatever your color might be whatever
[57:51] your socioeconomic background is it's a
[57:54] big word for us this morning how much
[57:56] money you have how good your parents are
[57:58] or weren't
[58:00] none of that matters in this we are all
[58:03] one in Christ
[58:05] he says and if if
[58:08] ye be Christ then he ye are ye Abraham's
[58:12] seat and heirs according to the promise
[58:14] this is the key to the whole thing
[58:15] because Paul is tying us back to
[58:17] Abraham's promise
[58:19] and he's saying you're what you're in
[58:21] line with Abraham you have the same
[58:23] you're from Abraham's seed you have the
[58:25] same nature as Abraham you have the same
[58:27] way to receive it as Abraham did and if
[58:30] you are in Christ then you are one of
[58:32] Abraham's seed and there's an
[58:33] inheritance that's waiting for you amen
[58:35] because remember Israel got caught up in
[58:37] who their dad was
[58:39] naturally speaking and they forgot about
[58:41] the God behind them
[58:43] and so they focused on the natural and
[58:45] they focused on the land and all they
[58:47] wanted was the land now they wanted was
[58:48] the land and they forgot that Abraham
[58:50] was chosen by God's election
[58:53] Abraham was chosen by election Abraham
[58:55] was walking around I believe brother
[58:56] Brown said he was packing Idols in these
[58:58] different things he was just like
[59:00] everyone else and then God came down
[59:02] sovereignly and he picked out Abraham
[59:04] and then by faith Abraham acted on God's
[59:07] choice if I could put it that way God
[59:09] chose him and then by faith Abraham
[59:10] responded to it God chose Abraham and he
[59:13] spoke to Abraham and called him out and
[59:15] Abraham had an opportunity to act in
[59:17] faith and he did
[59:18] and that's what proved what was inside
[59:21] of Abraham that he was a child of God it
[59:22] was that there was Faith there to
[59:24] receive the word of God and act on it
[59:27] now we notice Abraham did not act
[59:29] perfectly but he acted he started down
[59:32] the road
[59:34] but God was going to take him to where
[59:35] he would have a perfect walk where he
[59:37] would do exactly what God had told him
[59:39] to do it's the same thing we have today
[59:41] and we can sit here and we can say I'm
[59:43] raised in a in a Christian home and I'm
[59:45] raised around the message therefore I am
[59:46] a child of God
[59:48] no
[59:50] I'm not saying you're not I'm saying how
[59:52] you respond to what is preached to you
[59:55] how you respond to the word is what
[59:57] proves what's inside of you not where
[59:58] you're born or who you're born into
[1:00:00] that is not what's going to happen like
[1:00:02] I said Jacob and Esau were were raised
[1:00:04] in the same family and early on we could
[1:00:07] maybe say that Esau was a better guy
[1:00:08] than Jacob because Jacob was a shyster
[1:00:10] remember
[1:00:12] Jacob was a cheater he was a manipulator
[1:00:14] Esau was what he was but at least he
[1:00:16] didn't pretend to be otherwise
[1:00:19] but Jacob always had an inclination
[1:00:21] towards the things of God
[1:00:23] but he always tried to get it on his own
[1:00:25] was the problem and God had to take that
[1:00:27] out of him but his inclination was
[1:00:28] towards that and over time Jacob finally
[1:00:31] surrendered and he finally started
[1:00:32] letting God have a hand in his life
[1:00:34] instead of trying to make it all happen
[1:00:35] on his own and that's when we see when
[1:00:37] we're children is when we will not only
[1:00:38] humble ourselves to the world but we'll
[1:00:40] take to the word rather but then we'll
[1:00:42] take take our hands off of it and say
[1:00:44] Lord my life is in your hands and that's
[1:00:46] what Jacob had to do he came to the
[1:00:48] point where he knew he couldn't save his
[1:00:49] own life and so he had to step fully
[1:00:51] into God Amen
[1:00:52] but Paul says here that you are heirs
[1:00:54] according to the promise now the thing
[1:00:56] is when we look at Abraham's life and we
[1:00:58] look at what God Said to Abraham there
[1:01:00] were many promises given to Abraham
[1:01:03] it wasn't just one but it was three and
[1:01:05] four and depending on where you look at
[1:01:07] these things amen so but we see that
[1:01:09] Abraham's seed natural Israel they only
[1:01:11] cared about one thing and that was the
[1:01:13] land they wanted the land the land the
[1:01:15] land and they forgot about the big
[1:01:17] promise so let's go back to what God
[1:01:19] Said to Abraham in the beginning in
[1:01:20] Genesis 12. now this is him calling him
[1:01:23] out this is this is the first time that
[1:01:24] Abraham as God speak to him he says now
[1:01:27] the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee
[1:01:29] out of thy country and from thy Kindred
[1:01:31] and from thy Father's House unto a land
[1:01:34] that I will show thee now I want you to
[1:01:36] catch something here he didn't say unto
[1:01:37] a land that I will give thee he said
[1:01:39] unto a land that I will show thee
[1:01:41] he says go where I tell you to go
[1:01:44] there was no promise of land
[1:01:46] he says and I will make of thee a great
[1:01:48] nation and I will bless thee and make
[1:01:50] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:01:52] blessing so here's the blessing here's
[1:01:54] the promise he'll be a great nation
[1:01:55] he'll be blessed he'll have a great
[1:01:57] reputation and he'll be a blessing to
[1:01:59] others as well
[1:02:01] and in verse 3 says and I will bless
[1:02:02] them that bless thee and curse him that
[1:02:04] curseth thee and in thee shall all
[1:02:07] families of the earth be blessed this is
[1:02:10] the final portion of the blessing he
[1:02:11] says the entire world is going to be
[1:02:12] blessed Because of You Abraham
[1:02:16] so this couldn't be a promise that was
[1:02:18] fulfilled only by Israel
[1:02:20] it couldn't just be Israel because all
[1:02:21] he said all the nations the whole world
[1:02:23] is going to be blessed so it couldn't
[1:02:25] just be focused on Israel this was a
[1:02:27] global blessing and a global impact that
[1:02:29] Abraham was going to have so the Israel
[1:02:31] and Israel in the land was not the
[1:02:32] fulfill them fulfillment of the
[1:02:34] abrahamic Covenant it couldn't be
[1:02:36] because it had to bless the entire world
[1:02:38] Amen now we know later that God promises
[1:02:40] Canaan to Abraham and Promises to bring
[1:02:42] his descendants back to the land and
[1:02:44] that was a big part of Israel's identity
[1:02:46] but that was not supposed to be the
[1:02:48] great part that was not supposed to be
[1:02:49] the big part of it amen
[1:02:51] but this was just a type because we know
[1:02:53] this the Bible and all of its stories is
[1:02:55] about Redemption it's a book of
[1:02:57] redemption so him bringing Israel back
[1:02:59] to a place where Abraham walked was a
[1:03:01] Redemption story but it was a type of
[1:03:03] the bigger picture of what he was doing
[1:03:05] with the entire world Amen
[1:03:08] like we said it's not just about
[1:03:09] possession of land but it's about
[1:03:10] position it's relationship it's
[1:03:12] communion it's about restoration of what
[1:03:14] we had in Eden and sorry to say but
[1:03:16] Israel the land of Israel is not Eden
[1:03:19] it never was Eden and yet they treated
[1:03:21] it as Eden and all they cared about was
[1:03:23] the land the land the land and they
[1:03:24] forgot the God that was giving them the
[1:03:26] land
[1:03:27] now Paul says this earlier in Galatians
[1:03:29] 3 Verse 6 he says even as Abraham
[1:03:31] believed God and he was accounted to him
[1:03:34] for righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:03:36] they which are of Faith the same are the
[1:03:39] children of Abraham so it's people that
[1:03:41] are of faith that are related to Abraham
[1:03:43] it is not the natural lineage but it's
[1:03:45] the spiritual lineage those that have
[1:03:46] faith to take the promises of God and
[1:03:48] live by them
[1:03:49] it says in verse 8 and the scripture
[1:03:52] foreseen that God would justify the
[1:03:54] Heathen through faith just like Abraham
[1:03:57] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[1:04:00] saying in these shall All Nations be
[1:04:02] blessed so in other words the
[1:04:04] Fulfillment of Abraham's promise was the
[1:04:07] Gospel coming to the entire world
[1:04:09] through Christ
[1:04:11] that was the Fulfillment of the promise
[1:04:13] amen and it was not only to the Jews but
[1:04:15] it was to the Gentiles also paulicene
[1:04:17] verse 9 so then they which be of Faith
[1:04:20] are blessed with faithful Abraham so in
[1:04:22] other words if you have the faith of
[1:04:24] Abraham you get the promise of Abraham
[1:04:26] if you have the faith of Abraham you get
[1:04:28] the inheritance of Abraham if you have
[1:04:30] the faith of Abraham you are identified
[1:04:32] with him and you have this the access to
[1:04:34] the same things that Abraham had
[1:04:37] verse 16 says now to Abraham and his
[1:04:40] seed were the promises made and say he
[1:04:43] saith not and to seeds as of many he
[1:04:46] says but as of one and to thy seed which
[1:04:48] is Christ so we're trying to tie this
[1:04:51] package together and I preached on this
[1:04:52] before and and we preached on you know
[1:04:54] people of the Covenant and these
[1:04:55] different things or or along those lines
[1:04:57] I think that's brother Tim's thing but
[1:04:59] but we preached on the the people of the
[1:05:01] promise I think or whatever it was but
[1:05:03] I've covered this before so I'm going to
[1:05:05] tie it together quickly Lord willing but
[1:05:07] Paul's saying your children of faith and
[1:05:09] that's what makes you children of
[1:05:10] Abraham because he was the man that was
[1:05:12] righteous by faith you look at Abraham's
[1:05:15] life and it was not righteous by action
[1:05:17] all the time Abraham was a very very
[1:05:20] human man
[1:05:22] very he would forget so easily the
[1:05:25] things that God had told them amen but
[1:05:27] what is what is it that makes Abraham
[1:05:29] righteous was he received a faith
[1:05:31] promise and that Faith promise was
[1:05:33] fulfilled in Christ
[1:05:35] was a fulfillment of that and so all
[1:05:38] that are baptized into Christ get the
[1:05:40] full blessing because that is the
[1:05:41] Fulfillment of Abraham's inheritance is
[1:05:44] in Christ
[1:05:46] we look at Abraham's life and we see him
[1:05:47] do great things we see him do foolish
[1:05:49] things but as I was thinking on these
[1:05:51] things and it drew me to to Genesis 15
[1:05:54] which is right after Abraham goes and
[1:05:56] Slaughters the five Kings remember they
[1:05:58] came and they battled against Sodom and
[1:06:00] Gomorrah and they went and they took out
[1:06:02] lot and his family and they took them
[1:06:03] captives and the Kings and all these
[1:06:05] different things so Abraham goes out and
[1:06:07] he takes his servants 300 plus of them
[1:06:09] and they go out and they actually
[1:06:10] destroy those kings
[1:06:12] and after that the king of Sodom comes
[1:06:15] to him and he says Abraham you've saved
[1:06:17] us thank you he says here take
[1:06:19] everything that we have because if you
[1:06:21] hadn't come into and saved us we'd have
[1:06:23] lost it anyway so he says you take the
[1:06:25] good stuff we'll take our families we'll
[1:06:27] go back we'll rebuild we'll be okay you
[1:06:30] take all of this wealth and listen
[1:06:32] that's not a an unreasonable thing to do
[1:06:34] and it's not unreasonable for maybe
[1:06:36] Abraham to take it he's the one that
[1:06:37] stuck his neck on the line I'm sure he
[1:06:39] had costs he spent food you know he had
[1:06:41] to take his servants out he had to keep
[1:06:43] him going the whole time maybe it'd be
[1:06:45] reasonable for him to take at least
[1:06:46] something from it but Abraham says I
[1:06:48] won't even take a shoelace from you
[1:06:50] not even a shoelace he says because if I
[1:06:53] do you will say you've made me wealthy
[1:06:57] why did Abraham turn it down Abraham
[1:06:59] turned it down because he didn't want to
[1:07:01] taint his personal testimony of the
[1:07:03] provision of God by taking something
[1:07:05] from an Unholy man
[1:07:07] he was he was more worried about his
[1:07:09] testimony than the provision that he may
[1:07:11] have gotten from that from winning that
[1:07:12] battle amen
[1:07:14] and then right after Abraham does that
[1:07:16] right after he has this great Victory
[1:07:18] and he he routes an army that he should
[1:07:20] never been able to do and he makes that
[1:07:22] conscious decision to turn down that
[1:07:24] that treasure from those kings that well
[1:07:25] from the King God walks into his life
[1:07:28] and look at this conversation he has
[1:07:31] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:07:33] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[1:07:36] not Abraham
[1:07:37] don't worry that you turned down all of
[1:07:39] this wealth Abram he says I am thy
[1:07:43] shield and I exceeding great reward
[1:07:45] Hallelujah I am your reward Abraham what
[1:07:48] Comfort we can take church when we turn
[1:07:51] down things that anybody else would have
[1:07:52] taken for his sake and he comes back and
[1:07:56] he says I am your reward I I am what's
[1:07:59] going to give you what you're looking
[1:08:00] for in the first place that would never
[1:08:02] have given it to you Abram but I'll give
[1:08:04] you what you're really seeking I'll give
[1:08:06] you the reward that you want I'll give
[1:08:07] you the inheritance that lasts beyond
[1:08:09] anything that this King could have given
[1:08:11] you he says what I am thy exceeding
[1:08:14] great reward can you imagine what an
[1:08:16] exceeding great reward looks like if I
[1:08:18] were to give it to you listen we go out
[1:08:21] and we compete and we work hard and
[1:08:23] maybe we get employee of the year and
[1:08:25] they give us a bonus for five thousand
[1:08:26] dollars or the company does really well
[1:08:28] and they give us a 20 bonus of our
[1:08:31] annual salary and we say that's a great
[1:08:33] reward and it's commensurate with the
[1:08:35] work we put in
[1:08:37] maybe if it's a really generous man he
[1:08:40] he'd write you a huge check that day and
[1:08:42] you'd say that would be a great reward
[1:08:44] somebody goes to the Olympics and they
[1:08:46] spend years and years four years
[1:08:48] training they come and they win a gold
[1:08:49] medal and that's the reward they get a
[1:08:52] gold medal they're the world champion
[1:08:53] they're the best in the world and we say
[1:08:55] that's a great reward but God comes to
[1:08:57] Abraham and he says no no no I'm not
[1:09:00] just going to give you a reward I'm not
[1:09:01] just going to give you a grave reward
[1:09:03] I'm going to give you an exceeding great
[1:09:05] reward I'm gonna go above and beyond
[1:09:07] what you can even ask or think I'm going
[1:09:10] to blow your mind with how great it is
[1:09:12] that I am for you Abraham
[1:09:14] that's the kind of God we're serving
[1:09:16] churches that he goes so much further
[1:09:18] than we could ever expect amen above and
[1:09:21] beyond your effort is the reward that
[1:09:23] you will get
[1:09:24] that's what he promised to his church
[1:09:27] Paul says this in Corinthians he says
[1:09:29] that is as it is written I had not seen
[1:09:32] nor your hurt neither have entered into
[1:09:34] the heart of man the things which God
[1:09:37] hath prepared for them that love him
[1:09:40] that's what God has for us Church
[1:09:43] in ways we never expect in times we can
[1:09:45] never expect above and beyond whatever
[1:09:48] we could we could even think about
[1:09:50] whatever we've seen it's greater than
[1:09:52] anything we've seen whatever we've heard
[1:09:54] it's greater than anything we've heard
[1:09:55] brother Bradham when he went beyond the
[1:09:57] curtain of time and he comes back and he
[1:09:59] says you can't imagine and he says
[1:10:01] whatever you do don't miss it don't miss
[1:10:05] it because it's better than we ever
[1:10:07] imagined
[1:10:08] oh I was thinking this morning I've been
[1:10:10] listening to the adoption series
[1:10:14] and brother Branham is talking about
[1:10:17] a place of Prayer
[1:10:20] and we look at how our lives are in this
[1:10:23] church building and the things we will
[1:10:24] and won't do in a church building
[1:10:27] and it struck me that will keep this
[1:10:29] church building so clean
[1:10:32] and yet in our life we'll do the little
[1:10:34] things that we'd never do in church
[1:10:36] and guess what this isn't the Tabernacle
[1:10:39] of the Living God this is the Tabernacle
[1:10:42] of our living God
[1:10:44] my if we could recognize what's waiting
[1:10:47] for us
[1:10:48] he was talking about he says the entire
[1:10:50] he says somebody can lose our their
[1:10:52] healing because of what we're doing in
[1:10:54] our personal life
[1:10:56] Church how serious is it this morning
[1:10:59] how serious is it this morning
[1:11:02] but the promise to Abraham and assib was
[1:11:04] what was it a promised land no the
[1:11:07] promise was I am
[1:11:09] I am
[1:11:11] not I was not I will be I am the present
[1:11:14] God today that is what we're looking for
[1:11:17] that is the continuous life-giving
[1:11:20] prevailing revelation we need as the I
[1:11:22] am is with me
[1:11:23] and he's given himself to me and he's
[1:11:26] given his word to me and so I can have
[1:11:27] Victory so I can have overcoming power
[1:11:29] so I can have my needs met so I can have
[1:11:32] the leadership and direction that I need
[1:11:34] in my life amen he is the promise he is
[1:11:37] the dwelling place he is a rock he is a
[1:11:39] shadow in a weary land he is our all in
[1:11:42] all amen that's what we seek amen our
[1:11:45] promised land is not a what it's a Who
[1:11:48] that's where our rest is that's where
[1:11:50] our joy is that's where our peace is
[1:11:52] that's where our communion is that's
[1:11:53] where our provision is that's where our
[1:11:55] food is that's where our water is it is
[1:11:57] in Christ amen what is it our promised
[1:11:59] land is that person first and foremost
[1:12:01] then from that person comes a position
[1:12:04] in Christ and then from that position in
[1:12:06] Christ comes the possessions of the
[1:12:08] promises of the word of God for each and
[1:12:09] every believer amen Israel all they
[1:12:12] wanted was a land of promise they wanted
[1:12:14] Eden again and they completely missed
[1:12:16] out that there was a person that was
[1:12:18] supposed to be walking in the midst of
[1:12:19] their Eden in the cool of the evening
[1:12:21] every single day and that's what they
[1:12:23] missed out and time and time again they
[1:12:25] started doing what was right in their
[1:12:26] own eyes and they lost that communion
[1:12:28] and they lost that communion and they
[1:12:29] lost that communion and when they lost
[1:12:30] that communion they lost the land every
[1:12:32] time if they'd have focused on the
[1:12:33] communion they'd have had the land even
[1:12:35] today
[1:12:36] they'd have never lost it they'd have
[1:12:37] never lost it if they'd stuck with that
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] but Abraham got the god of the promise
[1:12:43] and he got the land
[1:12:45] and that's what we want we want the God
[1:12:47] first and get the promises later make
[1:12:49] sure you've got God in your life make
[1:12:50] sure you've made him welcome in your
[1:12:51] life and everything else will fall into
[1:12:54] place amen
[1:12:55] listen make no mistake Abraham wanted
[1:12:57] the blessing Abraham wanted the land and
[1:12:59] he wanted the promised son but more than
[1:13:02] anything he wanted the god that made
[1:13:03] that promise and time and time again
[1:13:05] Abraham proved Lord you're more
[1:13:07] important to me even than the life of
[1:13:09] that promised son
[1:13:11] even that he says he'll raise him up if
[1:13:14] he asks me to do it I'll do it because
[1:13:15] he's got to raise him up because there's
[1:13:17] a promise in that lineage amen what is
[1:13:19] it God's the blessing God himself is the
[1:13:21] blessing that we seek he's the promise
[1:13:23] that we're seeking
[1:13:25] but look what happens just before God
[1:13:28] gives Abraham the promised son in Isaac
[1:13:30] look at his commission to Abraham look
[1:13:32] at God's requirement of Abraham
[1:13:34] it says when Abraham Abram was 90 years
[1:13:37] old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram
[1:13:39] and said to him I am the almighty God
[1:13:42] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:13:47] the Holy Ghost hasn't been given yet
[1:13:50] there's no sacrifice at Calvary yet
[1:13:52] there is no way to be perfect as we
[1:13:54] would deem Perfection but yet God says
[1:13:57] do it do the impossible Abram
[1:14:00] Church what is perfection
[1:14:02] Perfection is to do what the word tells
[1:14:06] you to do to walk as the word does tell
[1:14:09] you it's it's the Fulfillment of the
[1:14:10] word of God and Abraham is unable to do
[1:14:12] it God's saying Abraham have your child
[1:14:15] and Abram's 99 years old Sarah's 89
[1:14:19] years old and God's saying Arab go
[1:14:21] fulfill the word of the Lord that's what
[1:14:23] perfectionist is to do what God told you
[1:14:25] to do
[1:14:26] because that's all that matters
[1:14:27] if you do what he tells you to do then
[1:14:29] everything else doesn't matter that's
[1:14:30] what he's looking for is the children
[1:14:32] that will obey him
[1:14:36] I was I was listening again this morning
[1:14:37] to adoption brother Bram says Cain and
[1:14:39] he says it represents that it must be a
[1:14:42] perfect walk
[1:14:44] and we think Perfection means sinless
[1:14:46] Perfection no it means to fulfill the
[1:14:49] word of God
[1:14:50] so that's what he was telling Abraham
[1:14:51] here he's saying fulfill the word
[1:14:53] Abraham Abram he says and I will make my
[1:14:55] Covenant between me and thee and will
[1:14:58] multiply thee exceedingly now you'll
[1:15:00] notice if he's what he's doing here is
[1:15:02] he's performing through Abraham's seed
[1:15:04] the thing that he told Adam and Eve to
[1:15:06] do
[1:15:06] he told Adam and Eve he says go forth
[1:15:09] and what multiply
[1:15:12] replenish the Earth
[1:15:14] that's what he told the Adam and Eve to
[1:15:15] do and they messed it up and now he's
[1:15:17] coming to Abraham and he says and Abram
[1:15:18] through your seed I'm going to do what I
[1:15:21] told them to do in Eden and that's going
[1:15:22] to happen through Christ and that's
[1:15:23] going to happen through the new birth
[1:15:25] that's what we're looking at in this is
[1:15:27] that's going to be the Fulfillment of
[1:15:28] what he told him to do in the beginning
[1:15:30] now he's bringing it down through Abram
[1:15:31] and it's prophetically pointing to
[1:15:33] Christ and the and the falling of the
[1:15:34] Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[1:15:37] so Abraham still hasn't had a name
[1:15:39] change Isaac hasn't been born he's 99.
[1:15:42] sarai's 89 he's weak and old and frail
[1:15:45] and able to Father child and God says
[1:15:46] now is the time Abram walk the walk that
[1:15:48] I've told you to walk do what I've told
[1:15:50] you to do bring forth the promise Abram
[1:15:56] God knows how to time a request doesn't
[1:15:58] he Church
[1:16:01] when you're feeling at your worst
[1:16:04] when you're feeling like you're past
[1:16:05] your due date
[1:16:06] God comes down says Now's the Time
[1:16:09] listen if Caleb can do it we can do it
[1:16:14] because Caleb went into the land and he
[1:16:16] came out and says we're more than able
[1:16:17] and 40 years later he hadn't lost an
[1:16:20] ounce of strength and he says we're
[1:16:21] still more than able and we're going to
[1:16:22] go into it and then he says give me this
[1:16:24] my Mountain give me what you told me to
[1:16:26] do but God's telling Abram he's saying
[1:16:28] Abraham time to have that child
[1:16:29] Abraham's saying are you kidding
[1:16:32] I'm 99.
[1:16:34] my wife is 89. it ain't happening God
[1:16:37] says nonetheless Abram
[1:16:39] time for you to do it
[1:16:41] but listen God didn't say you will
[1:16:43] produce a son
[1:16:45] what did he say he said I will return
[1:16:48] unto thee
[1:16:51] I will return to you Abram and when that
[1:16:55] happens a birth will take place and it's
[1:16:57] my returning that brings the birth not
[1:16:59] your doing that that does it
[1:17:02] what is it and he gave them a body
[1:17:04] change
[1:17:06] he put a change inside of them that made
[1:17:08] it possible and that's what happens when
[1:17:10] he comes back
[1:17:12] when he returns to you when he restores
[1:17:14] you to position there's a change in you
[1:17:16] where life can now come forth where
[1:17:18] before it couldn't before amen
[1:17:21] it says in Abram fell on his face and
[1:17:22] God talked with him saying as for me
[1:17:24] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[1:17:27] shalt be a father of many nations
[1:17:28] neither shall end thy name anymore be
[1:17:31] called Abram but thy name shall be
[1:17:33] Abraham for a father of many nations
[1:17:35] have I made thee so notice Abraham Abram
[1:17:39] gets a name change to Abraham which
[1:17:41] means father of many nations and he's
[1:17:43] now a laughing stock
[1:17:46] because he's still 99
[1:17:48] he hasn't had a body change Sarah hasn't
[1:17:50] had a body change there's no pregnancy
[1:17:52] yet and yet he's going around he's
[1:17:53] telling everyone by the way don't call
[1:17:55] me Abram anymore call me Abraham
[1:17:58] and they're saying
[1:17:59] you're 99 Abraham
[1:18:04] right he's a laughing stock and God has
[1:18:06] put his name in him that is what
[1:18:09] pointing to the promise that's coming
[1:18:10] and he's got to carry that for three
[1:18:12] months
[1:18:14] he's got to carry that for three months
[1:18:15] with nothing happening but God's working
[1:18:17] in the background regardless isn't he
[1:18:21] says and I will make the exceeding
[1:18:23] fruitful and I will make nations of thee
[1:18:25] and Kings shall come out of Thee
[1:18:28] and I will establish my Covenant between
[1:18:31] me and thee and thy seed after thee in
[1:18:34] their generations for an Everlasting
[1:18:35] Covenant to be a god unto thee and to
[1:18:38] thy seed after thee
[1:18:39] what is he saying I am thy exceeding
[1:18:41] great reward
[1:18:43] and I will give unto thee and to thy
[1:18:45] seed after thee the lamb wherein thou
[1:18:47] art a stranger all the land of Canaan
[1:18:49] for an everlasting possession and I will
[1:18:52] be their God
[1:18:53] so the first promise was Supernatural
[1:18:55] the second one is natural amen and
[1:18:57] Israel was focused on the natural all
[1:18:59] the time
[1:19:01] that's why so few really really did
[1:19:03] anything wonderful in Israel was because
[1:19:04] they only cared about the land and they
[1:19:06] didn't care about the God that was
[1:19:07] supposed to be in their midst amen
[1:19:09] they assume that if they're in the land
[1:19:11] everything was all right no if they had
[1:19:12] the god that gave them the land then
[1:19:14] everything was going to be all right
[1:19:15] because they had to follow the statutes
[1:19:16] of God to stay in that land and God said
[1:19:19] unto Abraham thou shall keep my Covenant
[1:19:21] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:19:23] in their Generations this is my Covenant
[1:19:26] which he shall keep between me and you
[1:19:28] and thy seed after thee every man child
[1:19:31] among you shall be circumcised but this
[1:19:33] doesn't sound very much like our
[1:19:35] promised land does it
[1:19:37] sounds like pain
[1:19:39] but I'm promising you this is it we're
[1:19:41] going to get there God says I promise
[1:19:44] that I will be a God to you and your
[1:19:45] seed your family forever
[1:19:47] and that's a standalone promise
[1:19:50] that's a standalone promise because the
[1:19:52] next one is for Israel only but the Seed
[1:19:54] of Abraham spiritual
[1:19:56] that's the one that we're looking to
[1:19:58] because we're not looking for land here
[1:20:00] we've been promised no land here but
[1:20:02] that first one is the one that we seek
[1:20:03] after and that's the one that Christ
[1:20:05] came to fulfill was that Covenant that
[1:20:07] he would be a god unto us all the way
[1:20:09] through these things amen he says I will
[1:20:11] be a a god unto you personal
[1:20:15] then he says the land is for them but
[1:20:17] the God is for you right now here today
[1:20:20] listen so we can't be seeking something
[1:20:22] natural
[1:20:23] that's not what we're here for
[1:20:25] we're not seeking a land we're not
[1:20:26] seeking big houses we're not seeking
[1:20:28] great wealth in these different things
[1:20:30] but we're seeking something else that he
[1:20:31] promised and that's that he says I will
[1:20:33] be with you even in you to the end of
[1:20:35] the age that's our promise amen
[1:20:37] as I was reading this
[1:20:39] and I came across this quote as I was
[1:20:41] studying it's a bit of a long one and
[1:20:43] we'll we'll be almost done after this
[1:20:44] but the prophet breaks down what he's
[1:20:47] talking about here in Genesis 17.
[1:20:50] and he says now watch here
[1:20:54] if you can get that next one brother
[1:20:56] vaishal now watch here the first thing
[1:20:59] you know I see when he's 19 and 9 God
[1:21:02] Appears to him to kind of confirm this
[1:21:04] thing the 17th chapter of Genesis he
[1:21:06] appeared to him in the name of El
[1:21:07] Shaddai and now when the El which the El
[1:21:10] Shaddai is the Hebrew word which means
[1:21:12] the breast or the breasted one like the
[1:21:14] mother he said now Abraham I am El
[1:21:16] Shaddai the almighty God now yet you're
[1:21:19] old your strengths all gone Sarah's womb
[1:21:23] is dead she's 90 little grandma like now
[1:21:25] a great great great grandma 90 years old
[1:21:28] she's awful old the people's laughing at
[1:21:31] you making fun of you
[1:21:32] thanks Lord for boosting my faith
[1:21:36] he says there's nothing here Abraham and
[1:21:39] you and Sarah that's going to make this
[1:21:40] happen but he says but I am the breast
[1:21:42] of one
[1:21:43] like a mother to her sickly fretting
[1:21:45] baby now when the little baby's all weak
[1:21:48] and run down his strength's gone the
[1:21:50] mother pulls it to her bosom and the
[1:21:52] child nurses his strength from the
[1:21:53] mother he says the mother's strength
[1:21:56] becomes the child's strength as he draws
[1:21:59] it from her
[1:22:00] and so he said now Abraham you're old
[1:22:02] you're past the age shares past the age
[1:22:04] but I have to bless her through you so
[1:22:07] you just lean upon my bosom and just
[1:22:09] keep nursing amen hallelujah he says
[1:22:12] I'll give you your strength you draw it
[1:22:14] out of me
[1:22:16] now watch the breasted one not one but
[1:22:19] two he says he was wounded for our
[1:22:21] transgressions and with his stripes were
[1:22:23] healed he says just turn your head to
[1:22:26] the other one if you need healing amen
[1:22:28] see I'm the breast of God that's what it
[1:22:30] means in so many words Abraham I am the
[1:22:33] breast of God now what I will have to do
[1:22:35] I'll give you eternal life by nursing
[1:22:38] from here
[1:22:39] now I'm going to do some Divine Healing
[1:22:41] in your body if you'll nurse from there
[1:22:44] listen God is a source of healing
[1:22:47] eternal life is the source of healing
[1:22:49] because he says Divine Healing is what
[1:22:51] the down payment is the proof
[1:22:53] of what eternal life
[1:22:56] prophet of God would teach us that he
[1:22:58] said he's the same El Shaddai tonight he
[1:23:00] changes not and his Covenant people has
[1:23:03] the same privilege to draw from the same
[1:23:06] resource that Father Abraham had to draw
[1:23:08] because God swore by the same Covenant
[1:23:10] that he'd give us the promise hallelujah
[1:23:13] oh my there you are that's where my hope
[1:23:16] is built on nothing less but Jesus blood
[1:23:18] and righteousness when all around my
[1:23:21] soul gives way he's All My Hope and stay
[1:23:23] on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[1:23:26] other ground is sinking sand he says
[1:23:29] there you are El Shaddai the bosom the
[1:23:31] breast of God if you need salvation for
[1:23:34] your weak Soul draw from this side if
[1:23:36] you need healing for your body draw from
[1:23:39] this side for my Covenant was with
[1:23:41] Christ my son and in there he was
[1:23:43] wounded for your transgressions by his
[1:23:46] stripes you were healed I am the
[1:23:48] almighty just lean up here and go to
[1:23:50] drawing from them promises
[1:23:53] he says take them in your heart tonight
[1:23:55] and just drawing from them God you
[1:23:57] promised it tomorrow I don't care how
[1:24:00] you feel what you look like Lord I'm
[1:24:02] drawing from that promise watch how
[1:24:05] strength begins to renew how things
[1:24:07] begin to straighten up how arms begin to
[1:24:10] move out how eyes begin to brighten up
[1:24:12] how Hearts begin to beat normal the
[1:24:15] breasted God I'm drawing well I don't
[1:24:17] care how I feel what I look like I'm
[1:24:20] drawing from that breast Lord you
[1:24:21] promised it I'm the Seed of Abraham
[1:24:24] that's why I said the greatest
[1:24:26] revelation we need is who we are in
[1:24:28] Christ
[1:24:29] I am your child and I'm drawing This
[1:24:33] Promise it's thus saith the Lord
[1:24:36] I believe you next day I'm sicker than I
[1:24:39] ever was I'm still drawing I'll stagger
[1:24:41] not at the promise of God through
[1:24:43] unbelief but strong in faith giving
[1:24:45] glory to God for the promise that he
[1:24:47] said it will be so he says hallelujah
[1:24:50] Church what a covenant we have and it's
[1:24:53] a Covenant of Grace
[1:24:55] it's a Covenant of Grace amen it's his
[1:24:58] doing it's not ours the promised land
[1:25:00] for us is an eternal land not a natural
[1:25:02] one and it's not bound by our actions
[1:25:04] but it's bound because God swore by
[1:25:06] himself that he would have a bride
[1:25:09] without spot or wrinkle and so the very
[1:25:11] fact we're sitting here today we're
[1:25:13] standing here today is because he wrote
[1:25:15] our name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:18] before we took the breath of life here
[1:25:20] and that is why we can stand and we can
[1:25:23] overcome today amen that's why you have
[1:25:25] access to the word of God to the
[1:25:26] promises of God to the very attributes
[1:25:29] of God is because he wrote your name in
[1:25:31] that book before the foundation of the
[1:25:32] world Amen before you ever chose him he
[1:25:35] chose you
[1:25:37] you can't stop the grace of God
[1:25:40] you also can't earn it
[1:25:42] you can't deserve it all you can do is
[1:25:45] accept it and walk in it and show your
[1:25:47] appreciation by the life that you live
[1:25:48] back to him amen everything we have
[1:25:51] today is because of Grace
[1:25:53] as we start to close I want to just wrap
[1:25:56] this up in a bit of a bow and then we'll
[1:25:57] we'll continue on Wednesday Lord willing
[1:26:00] but we read this earlier in the service
[1:26:01] and he says for ye are all the children
[1:26:03] of God by faith in Christ
[1:26:05] who have been baptized into Christ have
[1:26:07] put on Christ for as many of you has
[1:26:10] have been baptized into Christ have put
[1:26:12] on Christ there's neither Jew nor Greek
[1:26:14] there's neither Bond nor free there's
[1:26:15] neither male nor female for ye are all
[1:26:17] one in Christ Jesus and if he be Christ
[1:26:20] then are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:26:23] according to the promise
[1:26:24] so he says what to be the heir of the
[1:26:26] promise to be the children of Abraham
[1:26:28] you have to receive this Promise by a
[1:26:30] baptism it's not a baptism of natural
[1:26:33] water
[1:26:34] that's our confession but this is a
[1:26:36] baptism that's Supernatural because when
[1:26:38] you have that baptism it takes you into
[1:26:40] Christ it baptizes you into a body amen
[1:26:43] so we're looking for a promise that's
[1:26:45] related to baptism and then Paul comes
[1:26:47] in first Corinthians 12 and says for as
[1:26:49] the body is one and had many members and
[1:26:52] all the members of that one body be many
[1:26:54] are one body so also is Christ he says
[1:26:57] you look at your body it's got all
[1:26:58] different parts and members and organs
[1:27:01] and these different things and he says
[1:27:02] that's the way the body of Christ is it
[1:27:04] has a bunch of different things put
[1:27:05] together and they work as one
[1:27:07] but in verse 13 He says what for by one
[1:27:10] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:27:13] Israel have one land we have one body
[1:27:16] and were baptized into it by capital S
[1:27:19] Spirit that's the Holy Spirit whether we
[1:27:21] be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond
[1:27:23] or free and we have all been made to
[1:27:26] drink into one Spirit remember last
[1:27:28] verse we spoke about how it was the land
[1:27:30] with springs and Brooks and there was
[1:27:32] there was ponds and lakes and there was
[1:27:34] a pressure behind it and brother Bradham
[1:27:36] says that or Paul says here he says that
[1:27:38] what we're drinking from one Spirit
[1:27:40] there's a life-giving source in each and
[1:27:42] every one of us and it's the same thing
[1:27:44] and it's the Holy Spirit he says for the
[1:27:46] body is not one member but many so that
[1:27:49] means it isn't just me and that it isn't
[1:27:51] just you but it's all of us together
[1:27:52] that make up this body that make up this
[1:27:54] Promised Land
[1:27:56] so the true baptism of the true promise
[1:27:58] to the true Seed of Abraham is a baptism
[1:28:00] of one spirit and that is the very
[1:28:02] spirit of God which is the holy spirit
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:05] but then we remember that God told
[1:28:07] Abraham he says listen you've got to
[1:28:09] reflect this Covenant back to me
[1:28:11] you've got to do something
[1:28:13] you've got to let me know that you're
[1:28:15] accepting it you've got to let me know
[1:28:16] that you're believing it you've got to
[1:28:18] let me know that you're accepting the
[1:28:20] identification of This Promise Abraham
[1:28:22] and he says what this is my Covenant
[1:28:25] which you shall keep between me and you
[1:28:27] and thy seed after thee every man child
[1:28:29] among you shall be circumcised
[1:28:32] so there was a sign in their flesh that
[1:28:34] they were children of promise
[1:28:37] and then Paul comes along and he's
[1:28:39] talking about Jesus Earthly Ministry and
[1:28:41] he says now I say that Jesus Christ was
[1:28:43] a minister of the circumcision he's not
[1:28:45] talking of the circumcision that the act
[1:28:47] or the the process but he's saying Jesus
[1:28:49] Christ was the minister of the Jews for
[1:28:51] the truth of God to confirm the promises
[1:28:55] made unto the fathers so in other words
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ came and preached to the
[1:28:59] Jews the natural Seed of Abraham to
[1:29:02] confirm the promises God made to them
[1:29:04] but Israel was in the land
[1:29:06] so if the land was the promised and why
[1:29:08] did christ need to come and why was he
[1:29:10] coming to preach promises if they
[1:29:12] already had the promise
[1:29:14] the only answer can be was because that
[1:29:15] wasn't the real promise that wasn't what
[1:29:18] they were supposed to be looking for
[1:29:19] amen there was a greater promise than
[1:29:21] just a natural land and then Paul comes
[1:29:23] in Colossians 2 and he says and ye are
[1:29:26] complete in him in Christ which is the
[1:29:29] head of all principality and Power in
[1:29:31] whom also ye are circumcised
[1:29:34] so there is a circumcision that we have
[1:29:36] to have just like they did
[1:29:39] and when they crossed over Jordan they
[1:29:40] had a time of circumcision because the
[1:29:43] parents hadn't circumcised their
[1:29:44] children so they went over Jordan they
[1:29:46] died to themselves and then there was a
[1:29:48] circumcision there and they had to rest
[1:29:50] and heal
[1:29:52] and Paul says each and every one of us
[1:29:54] is circumcised with the circumcision
[1:29:57] made without hands in putting off the
[1:30:00] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:30:02] circumcision of Christ so there is a
[1:30:04] supernatural circumcision there's a
[1:30:06] supernatural cutting away of something
[1:30:08] and guess what we have nothing to do
[1:30:10] with it these hands can't perform the
[1:30:12] circumcision that we need it has to be a
[1:30:14] supernatural circumcision because it
[1:30:16] brings a supernatural promise with it it
[1:30:19] can't be something you do it has to be
[1:30:20] something done and he says it's a
[1:30:22] circumcision of Christ
[1:30:24] amen it's a work of God because God's
[1:30:27] covenant is one-sided so he's got to do
[1:30:29] the circumcising amen we are merely the
[1:30:32] ones that benefit from it in verse 12 he
[1:30:35] says buried with him in baptism
[1:30:37] that's our doing
[1:30:39] we do that thing but it's a
[1:30:40] representation of a death that's
[1:30:42] supposed to be happening in another way
[1:30:44] he says wherein also ye are risen with
[1:30:47] him through the faith of the operation
[1:30:48] of God who hath raised him from the dead
[1:30:51] and you being dead in your sins and the
[1:30:54] uncircumcision of your flesh so your
[1:30:57] flesh needs a circumcision
[1:31:00] hath he quickened together with him
[1:31:03] having forgiven you all trespasses
[1:31:06] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:31:09] ordinance that was against us which was
[1:31:11] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:31:13] way nailing it to his cross so what is
[1:31:16] he saying he's saying now it's possible
[1:31:17] for you to walk thou before me and be
[1:31:20] thou perfect
[1:31:21] he's made a way he's taken away all the
[1:31:23] ordinance he's taken away the law he's
[1:31:25] taken away the sin he's taken away
[1:31:26] everything that would hold us back from
[1:31:28] walking before him and fulfilling the
[1:31:30] word being a perfect believer amen
[1:31:34] he took care of it all
[1:31:36] he took care of it all
[1:31:38] I want to close with this quote
[1:31:41] I know there's a lot here and it's a lot
[1:31:43] to dwell on and we'll bring more in the
[1:31:45] next service Lord William but I want to
[1:31:46] set this foundation for what it means
[1:31:48] and what the what the the what Kanan
[1:31:50] really is for the believer
[1:31:52] but brother Bram says this he says God
[1:31:55] keeps his word
[1:31:57] church if there's one thing we ought to
[1:31:59] believe it's that God will fulfill his
[1:32:00] word
[1:32:02] sometimes he says I can't keep mine and
[1:32:04] you can't keep yours always but God can
[1:32:07] keep his I don't know what's in the
[1:32:09] future but God being infinite knew the
[1:32:11] end from the beginning and then he
[1:32:13] cannot make a statement unless it's
[1:32:14] absolute truth for he knows everything
[1:32:16] to be infinite we're mortal and we're
[1:32:19] finite so therefore we can make mistakes
[1:32:21] but God can't make mistakes and our
[1:32:23] thought this afternoon is dealing with
[1:32:25] Israel in a time of such as the church
[1:32:27] is going through today
[1:32:29] listen he says all things come to a
[1:32:31] place of Crisis before it hits a climax
[1:32:34] diseases usually you go through the
[1:32:36] crisis and after the crisis then you get
[1:32:38] Well turns one way or the other he says
[1:32:40] you die or you get well
[1:32:42] he says and God has been dealing with
[1:32:43] the people in those days he was dealing
[1:32:46] with a nation the nation of Israel and
[1:32:48] God had let them go down into Egypt and
[1:32:51] they were there for 400 years according
[1:32:53] to his word
[1:32:54] catch this according to his word they go
[1:32:56] into Israel into Egypt it says they lost
[1:32:59] their fellowship with God when they went
[1:33:01] down into Egypt but they did not lose
[1:33:03] their Covenant
[1:33:05] for God's covenant was made with Abraham
[1:33:08] unconditionally for all generations not
[1:33:10] only Abraham but but to his children
[1:33:12] through all generations if we could just
[1:33:15] think of that that you being Abraham's
[1:33:17] children the promise is just as much to
[1:33:20] you as it was to Abraham for God made
[1:33:22] the covenant not only with Abraham but
[1:33:25] his children
[1:33:26] and who is Abraham's children those with
[1:33:29] our that are dead in Christ take on
[1:33:31] Abraham's seed and our heirs according
[1:33:33] to the promise
[1:33:35] therefore if you're born again of the
[1:33:37] spirit of God you become Abraham's
[1:33:40] children and every promise that God made
[1:33:42] to Abraham you are an heir to that
[1:33:45] Promise by grace
[1:33:47] and their Journey coming through the
[1:33:49] Wilderness out of Egypt going to the
[1:33:50] promised land is a type of the church
[1:33:52] today in its Journey coming up out of
[1:33:54] Egypt or chaos the world and on its
[1:33:57] pilgrimage up to the promised land he
[1:33:59] says and I'm sure that we can all agree
[1:34:01] today that we are on our way to the
[1:34:03] promised land we're just camping
[1:34:05] building little campfires passing
[1:34:08] through deep Waters and hard trials amen
[1:34:12] God bless you let's stand this morning
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:16] amen there is a promise for us
[1:34:20] and we'll see that that promise is the
[1:34:22] Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] brother Brian would say it's not just
[1:34:24] about the Holy Ghost he says but finding
[1:34:26] your place in the Holy Ghost
[1:34:29] what an amazing statement to say you say
[1:34:31] I just need to get the Holy Ghost no you
[1:34:33] need to be positionally placed you need
[1:34:35] to be put where you can do the most
[1:34:37] damage to Satan's kingdom and the most
[1:34:39] benefit to the kingdom of God and that's
[1:34:41] what it is is God's going to give it to
[1:34:43] you and then God's going to use you and
[1:34:44] place you positionally where you can do
[1:34:46] what he's he's ordained he's prophesied
[1:34:49] for this age he's prophesied for each
[1:34:51] and every one of us to do something in
[1:34:52] this age that's a reflection of the
[1:34:54] prophetic aspects of this Bible
[1:34:57] each and every one of us is going to
[1:34:58] fulfill prophecy we're doing it here
[1:35:00] today but we're going to fulfill
[1:35:02] Prophecy in the last one we're going to
[1:35:03] fulfill is that death where is thy sting
[1:35:05] and Grave where is thy Victory amen but
[1:35:08] until that point he's going to use us
[1:35:09] he's going to place us in a pace of
[1:35:11] adoption and then he's going to start
[1:35:12] using us first Kingdom purposely man
[1:35:14] that's what we're going forward in in
[1:35:16] this in this little series from here on
[1:35:18] amen God bless you let's
[1:35:20] just close our eyes and go to the throne
[1:35:21] of grace Heavenly Father

[1:35:42] infilling of the Holy Spirit Lord not
[1:35:44] just something that's on us or around us
[1:35:46] Lord but something that's inside of us
[1:35:48] that can give us continuous life-giving
[1:35:50] prevailing Revelation heavenly father

[1:56:16] your Prophet says positioning Place Lord
[1:56:19] father God in the word for the age is
[1:56:22] the third Paul
[1:56:25] Lord father God I'm reminded by the
[1:56:27] quote where your Prophet says Lord
[1:56:30] Lord father God that Moses in Janice and
[1:56:33] Chambers had the same signs
[1:56:35] but the difference between Janus and
[1:56:38] Chambers look God and Moses
[1:56:40] is that those Egyptians father God had
[1:56:43] an Egyptian voice
[1:56:45] but Moses had the voice of God for the
[1:56:48] age
[1:56:49] why the Egyptian Lord father God was
[1:56:51] telling them to stay in Egypt but when
[1:56:54] that voice of God for the age started
[1:56:56] its blasting forth it said applied the
[1:56:59] token in the evening time and an exodus
[1:57:03] of Egypt happened oh Lord and Lord
[1:57:06] father God as Moses was given to sign so
[1:57:10] we give you to sign o Branham but that
[1:57:14] was not his message oh Lord the voice of
[1:57:17] God for the age came when those book was
[1:57:20] open oh Lord and he said we're no longer
[1:57:23] in Rhodesia we in the bright age we're
[1:57:26] no longer under the shock we in the seed
[1:57:29] age we're no longer Son of God we in the
[1:57:32] son of man we're no longer in the
[1:57:34] chemistry we're in the token now
[1:57:37] Hallelujah oh thank you Lord father we
[1:57:40] are positioning place this morning

[1:57:59] they said where's our portion where's
[1:58:02] our land
[1:58:04] but a voice told them look up I am your
[1:58:09] portion
[1:58:11] you don't have a physical land you have
[1:58:14] a personal person
[1:58:16] and the chief levite of our day the
[1:58:20] seventh angel went into the office of
[1:58:22] Oral Roberts he went into the office oh
[1:58:26] lord of teal Osborne and he said Lord
