[50:04] that your word would flow tonight Lord
[50:07] that gracious words would Lord just move
[50:09] out of this Pulpit Lord into the
[50:10] people's hearts Lord Lord that we've
[50:13] received what you have for us tonight

[50:36] you can be you can take your Bibles this
[50:39] morning turn to or this evening
[50:40] Ephesians chapter 2.
[50:43] Ephesians chapter two amen good to be in
[50:45] the house of the Lord we have a smaller
[50:47] group here tonight I talked to brother
[50:48] Josh she says they're still not quite uh
[50:51] quite ready to come back to church yet
[50:53] so I said we continue praying for him
[50:54] I'm still not a hundred percent but I uh
[50:57] I told Brother Bob just because you have
[50:59] headaches that's that's a condition it's
[51:00] not sickness so we're here tonight and
[51:03] we're preaching amen just trusting the
[51:04] lord to bless amen as brother Bob point
[51:07] out brother brother Lowell can go to
[51:09] church with cancer and brother Ron
[51:10] Spencer can go to church with cancer
[51:12] then I should be able to get past a
[51:14] headache or two amen so trusting will be
[51:16] blessed this evening amen not because
[51:18] I'm here but because the Lord speaks
[51:20] amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 says
[51:23] but God who is rich in Mercy for his
[51:26] great love where with he loved us even
[51:29] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[51:32] us together with Christ and by Grace ye
[51:35] are saved and hath raised us up together
[51:37] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[51:39] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[51:42] to come he might show the exceeding
[51:44] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[51:46] toward us through Christ Jesus for by
[51:49] grace are you saved through faith and
[51:52] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[51:55] God Amen you can have your seats to see
[51:57] me may the Lord bless the reading of his
[51:59] word and we're going to continue as you
[52:01] might imagine in our in our series on
[52:03] Redemption this evening and what I do
[52:05] love about this series is I could preach
[52:07] just about anything and say we're
[52:08] continuing on our Redemption Series so
[52:10] we may go to the left and the right here
[52:12] sometimes but I want to take a sermon
[52:15] title tonight of the nature of Grace
[52:17] amen as we're speaking on Redemption and
[52:19] maybe that's a bit of an odd title given
[52:21] we just spoke on the prevailing Lion and
[52:23] the fierceness and the focus of God and
[52:25] his unwavering you know dedication to
[52:28] bringing us to the the place that he put
[52:30] in the word that says what we are to be
[52:31] and what we're going to do in these
[52:33] different things but even in in that
[52:35] we've got to understand that the
[52:37] foundation for the Redemptive work is
[52:38] always Grace amen and so sometimes we
[52:41] look and we see that nature of God that
[52:43] is it doesn't let go and that's really
[52:45] the nature of Grace it's really the
[52:46] nature of Grace is it never lets go away
[52:48] men there's always more there than what
[52:50] you can do to it it always overcomes
[52:52] because it's a it's an overwhelming
[52:54] thing of God Amen is that nature of
[52:56] Grace but as I was studying this and I I
[52:58] felt that so often the the the the the
[53:01] thing that we struggle with is that we
[53:03] receive Grace one way and we give it in
[53:05] another amen and that's speaking as
[53:08] humans maybe not as Believers but
[53:09] certainly as as Believers I believe we
[53:11] struggle with this sometimes is that we
[53:13] receive Grace one way and when we give
[53:15] it we tend to give it maybe in a
[53:16] slightly different way or maybe more
[53:18] than a slightly different way than than
[53:19] we got it from God Amen but the thing
[53:22] I'm reminded as I said more than
[53:23] anything in this as we go through
[53:25] Redemption is that it's based on Grace
[53:27] it's based on Grace it's a Grace work
[53:29] that starts it and it's a Grace work
[53:30] that finishes it you know our kids just
[53:32] got uh their per their their report
[53:34] cards from school and sometimes the
[53:37] further you get into your walk with God
[53:39] you start to you start to get into a
[53:41] performance-based relationship with God
[53:43] and that's not what Grace is Grace is
[53:45] never Performance Based we don't get
[53:47] grades from God Amen it is a work of
[53:49] Grace and we'll get into it as we talk
[53:51] about Abraham and these different things
[53:52] but but where we stand in him is not
[53:55] because we perform well it's because of
[53:57] what he's done for us and that we are
[53:59] accepted in the Beloved him and so we
[54:01] don't get grades we don't get grades in
[54:03] our life you know what we get we get
[54:04] fruit
[54:06] amen we get fruit out of it and this is
[54:08] just that's it brother Jonathan but I
[54:10] believe that you get as much fruit as
[54:11] you want to get amen if you take in a
[54:13] lot of the word then it's going to push
[54:14] out a lot of the word if you take in a
[54:16] little bit of the word if you only drink
[54:18] a little bit then guess what you can
[54:19] only support so much fruit but the more
[54:21] of God you take in and the only one that
[54:23] limits that is you the more fruit that
[54:25] you can push out and still be a healthy
[54:26] believer and still maintain your your
[54:28] relationship with God and these
[54:30] different things amen but I sat down and
[54:32] and Sundays are actually the best time
[54:34] for me to study so I went home on Sunday
[54:36] night or Sunday afternoon and played
[54:39] some games with the family and then I
[54:40] went right back down started studying I
[54:41] have 50 pages of notes built up into
[54:43] this series at this point and I said
[54:45] where am I going to go from this and and
[54:47] the thing that jumped out it says if we
[54:49] don't settle Grace here very quickly
[54:51] then we're going to get off to the left
[54:52] or we're going to get off to the right
[54:53] because so many times that's where we we
[54:56] get into issues is that we we get past
[54:58] that initial moment of Grace where God
[55:00] Saves us and we see our failures and we
[55:03] see our faults and we see our sins and
[55:05] so we're very thankful and we're very
[55:07] appreciative and we're very conscious of
[55:09] Grace but after that we start to set
[55:12] expectations for ourselves and we stop
[55:14] looking at Grace and we started looking
[55:16] at performance like I said and we start
[55:17] grading ourselves against the word and
[55:19] we start to think that is why God
[55:21] blesses us or doesn't bless us or
[55:23] approves of us or doesn't approve us is
[55:25] because of our our ability to match up
[55:27] to the word or our failure to match up
[55:29] to the word and so what happens is we
[55:31] can either get to the point where we
[55:32] deserve Redemption because we're
[55:34] performing well or we think that we
[55:36] don't Reserve Redemption we don't
[55:38] deserve the things of God because we're
[55:39] not performing well amen we get into
[55:41] trouble if we think we deserve it and we
[55:43] get into trouble if we don't think we
[55:44] deserve it we get into trouble if we
[55:46] think we can add anything to it and then
[55:48] we get into trouble if we don't do
[55:50] anything at all and we sit there like a
[55:51] lump on a pickle now that sounds
[55:53] complicated doesn't it but it's not
[55:55] complicated the idea of Grace is that it
[55:57] doesn't have anything to do with you you
[55:59] can never deserve it Grace is unmerited
[56:01] favor with God and so it doesn't matter
[56:04] what you do that can never change Grace
[56:05] but what it does change like I said is
[56:08] your fruit it changes what God can do
[56:10] with you but it doesn't change who you
[56:11] are in his sight amen
[56:13] it's amazing because as we get further
[56:16] into our walk with Christ we start to
[56:18] say well I did this and I did that and
[56:19] so I don't deserve it and I don't
[56:21] deserve that and and he's not going to
[56:23] love me anymore and he's not willing to
[56:24] do this or do that and God's sitting
[56:26] there saying listen you are a sinner
[56:28] when I first saved you Grace didn't look
[56:30] at what you did then why do you think
[56:32] Grace is looking at it now
[56:34] we think that the grace that we that was
[56:37] there originally somehow disappears as
[56:39] soon as we accept Christ into our life
[56:40] as soon as we commit our life to him now
[56:42] it's about what we do and it's not that
[56:44] could not be further from the truth amen
[56:45] God has an expectation for our behavior
[56:48] and then God's going to deal with us as
[56:49] children he's going to discipline us and
[56:51] he's going to correct us and he's going
[56:52] to teach us and all these things but
[56:54] never let it think that your condition
[56:56] is going to keep you out of the presence
[56:57] of God
[56:58] in the sense of who you are and and the
[57:00] failures that we have amen we put this
[57:02] massive pressure on ourselves as
[57:03] Believers sometimes man I think the
[57:05] young people will face us more often as
[57:07] certainly as you're young I know I did
[57:09] and still do in many ways you know I I
[57:12] unfortunately or fortunately I've had to
[57:14] change in my life in the sense that I
[57:16] went from a lay member now coming into
[57:18] the ministry and guess what you got to
[57:20] have a lot of Grace for yourself in the
[57:21] ministry you've got to have a lot of
[57:23] Grace for yourself because you're going
[57:24] to make failures and you're going to
[57:25] have faults and you're going to grow and
[57:27] your growth is very public and your
[57:28] failures are equally public and so
[57:30] you've got to recognize that God has
[57:31] Grace and even if the people sometimes
[57:33] don't God has Grace and they'll pull you
[57:35] through these different things amen but
[57:37] guess what we're all in condemned bodies
[57:38] aren't we every single one of us and so
[57:40] you can have the Holy Ghost inside of
[57:42] you and you can be you can have the new
[57:45] birth and you can be baptized and you
[57:46] can have a heart that's leaned towards
[57:47] God but you're still subject to
[57:49] tiredness you're still subject to
[57:51] frustration you're still subject to
[57:52] weariness you're still subject to the
[57:54] emotions that are in this body you're
[57:56] still subject to having a bad day so
[57:58] don't let that ever stop you from coming
[58:00] into his presence amen amen don't ever
[58:02] stop and say we're not good enough for
[58:04] because we've disappointed him I can't
[58:06] do this or he won't do that because
[58:07] that's never going to be true so I want
[58:10] to start with this one quote from
[58:11] Brother Branham that'll kind of set the
[58:13] tone for this because if we can we can
[58:15] recognize and accept what he says here
[58:17] then Satan will never be able to hold
[58:19] that on you when you make a mistake
[58:21] brother Brown says this he says
[58:24] now God said take a red heifer now did
[58:27] you ever notice scientifically you take
[58:29] something real red and look through red
[58:32] at red and it looks wife the white
[58:35] rather did you ever know that red
[58:37] through red looks white now I don't have
[58:39] a red filter here but what he's saying
[58:42] is that if I write something on this
[58:43] board if I if I took this red here and I
[58:46] put a red filter over top of that you
[58:48] wouldn't even see those letters it
[58:50] disappears because red blanks out red
[58:51] and all you can see is the clear the
[58:53] clarity the purity of the board that's
[58:54] there he says so God knowing that man
[58:57] was a sinner by Nature knowing that he
[58:59] was wrong to begin with he made a
[59:02] preparation of the shed blood
[59:04] and God looking through the blood of the
[59:06] Lord Jesus sees you a red sinner white
[59:09] as snow he says you have no more sin so
[59:13] I want to say this God sees you in a way
[59:16] that you can't ever see yourself he sees
[59:18] you in a special way and even though God
[59:20] is omnipotent he's omnipresent he's
[59:22] all-powerful he's all these things he
[59:24] cannot see your sin if you're under the
[59:26] blood of Jesus Christ
[59:28] it's a it's a paradox that the
[59:29] all-powerful God cannot see your sin and
[59:31] as we spoke last service or the service
[59:33] before it's not your sin isn't even
[59:35] attached to you it's separated from you
[59:37] and he still can't see it and he still
[59:39] can't attach it to you amen he says you
[59:41] have no more sin and when God looks
[59:44] through the blood of Christ no matter
[59:46] what you've done how much sin you've
[59:48] committed see we've got big black sins
[59:50] and then we've got little white sins he
[59:52] says no no no matter how much sin you've
[59:55] committed what you've done if the blood
[59:57] of Christ has been applied to your heart
[59:59] God sees you perfect
[1:00:03] perfect as if what you never did it in
[1:00:06] the first place we've read that before
[1:00:07] and we'll get into a deeper revelation
[1:00:09] of that in the next few services but I
[1:00:11] remember as a young man and shortly
[1:00:13] after I got baptized and when I was a
[1:00:14] young man
[1:00:16] um not many people knew this of course
[1:00:17] the kids that maybe saw me at school
[1:00:19] knew this I like country music I like
[1:00:21] certain types of rock and roll and these
[1:00:23] different things and when I went and I
[1:00:24] gave my heart to the Lord and I got
[1:00:26] baptized guess what that didn't take
[1:00:28] away those desires
[1:00:30] because I didn't have the new birth what
[1:00:32] I had done was given my heart to the
[1:00:34] Lord I had committed my life to him I
[1:00:36] had said I wanted to serve him but that
[1:00:38] is not the new birth
[1:00:40] I had repented completely I have been
[1:00:42] baptized completely but I had not
[1:00:44] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:46] and so I had uh you know I came back and
[1:00:49] I was doing really well and then I fell
[1:00:50] back to something
[1:00:52] and it happened multiple times and there
[1:00:54] was a time where I got down by my bed
[1:00:56] this is a true story I'm telling you
[1:00:58] exactly as it happened I got down by my
[1:01:00] bed this is not the proverbial getting
[1:01:02] down by your bed I got down and I was
[1:01:04] kneeling by my bed and I was sitting
[1:01:07] there and I was just praying out and I
[1:01:09] was crying to God I was crying out I
[1:01:11] wasn't sitting in a chair I wasn't
[1:01:13] leaning back I was on my knees crying
[1:01:15] before God because I was so heartbroken
[1:01:17] I was so heartbroken because I'd failed
[1:01:20] him yet again I had a besetting sin
[1:01:22] there I had something that my flesh
[1:01:24] liked that I knew I shouldn't like
[1:01:26] but yet I kept going back to it from
[1:01:28] time to time and I was sitting there and
[1:01:30] I was crying out to God and I said God
[1:01:32] I'm so sorry I'm sick and tired of this
[1:01:34] and I was crying tears coming down my
[1:01:36] face
[1:01:37] and eventually what happened was at that
[1:01:39] time God broke through and he showed me
[1:01:42] that my failures will never keep me out
[1:01:44] of his presence
[1:01:46] that what when I put my life under the
[1:01:48] blood of Christ it covered me from the
[1:01:51] beginning to the end and that never
[1:01:53] changes that never changes the blood is
[1:01:56] there and it covers me forever
[1:01:58] until he does what gives me the fullness
[1:02:01] of my Redemption which is a new body and
[1:02:03] I go to be in his presence amen then we
[1:02:04] don't need the blood anymore because
[1:02:06] we're in his presence and we're accepted
[1:02:08] in the Beloved amen but what I realize
[1:02:10] that everything I do is already under
[1:02:12] the blood
[1:02:14] everything is under the blood and as
[1:02:16] long as what I have a repentant heart I
[1:02:19] can always come back in his presence
[1:02:21] my sin won't keep me out of his presence
[1:02:24] I'll keep me out of his presence because
[1:02:26] if I don't repent if I don't realize
[1:02:28] there's mercy and Grace there I can't go
[1:02:30] back in his presence he is always
[1:02:32] willing to receive me back into his
[1:02:34] presence if I come with the right
[1:02:36] attitude and spirit and I was and guess
[1:02:38] what it was that time that moment that
[1:02:41] exact moment that God gave me the Holy
[1:02:43] Ghost and I got delivered and so
[1:02:45] remember last Source we we sang that
[1:02:47] song where it said you know that a man
[1:02:49] was he could not conquer uh passion lust
[1:02:52] and pride that's what happened to me
[1:02:54] there as I conquered that
[1:02:56] that's what happened there as I
[1:02:58] conquered that because he took the
[1:02:59] desire out
[1:03:00] now it's not that I've never failed
[1:03:02] again in my life the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:03:04] mean you never fail the holy ghost means
[1:03:06] you're sealed to the end and the blood
[1:03:07] covers you so that he doesn't seal your
[1:03:09] failures if anybody deals with you now
[1:03:11] as a son and a daughter of God Amen and
[1:03:14] what that the miracle aspect of the
[1:03:16] blood is that it covers the sin but it
[1:03:19] lets him see the need so he can address
[1:03:21] the need in your life without seeing the
[1:03:23] sin that tends to follow the the what we
[1:03:26] would call a fault he sees as a need
[1:03:27] there's no sin attached to it and so
[1:03:29] what's he doing is he's restoring we're
[1:03:32] in a Redemptive work he's restoring his
[1:03:34] Masterpiece which is what the bride
[1:03:36] that's his that's his Masterpiece in
[1:03:39] this age is going to be the bride so the
[1:03:40] fact that you have flaws and cracks and
[1:03:42] failures does not bother him because
[1:03:44] he's in a restoring work
[1:03:46] so he can see your faults without seeing
[1:03:48] your sins that's the amazing thing about
[1:03:50] the blood of Christ amen so that he can
[1:03:52] continue to work on me without
[1:03:54] attributing sin into my life amen and so
[1:03:56] from that moment on I haven't struggled
[1:03:58] with my faults and failures
[1:04:00] not struggle with them meaning I didn't
[1:04:02] have them but I haven't struggled to go
[1:04:04] back into the presence of God and seek
[1:04:06] forgiveness when I do mess up and I do
[1:04:08] mess up often and regularly amen but
[1:04:12] it's not my opinion that now keeps me
[1:04:14] out I remember there's a brother back in
[1:04:16] one of the churches that I used to be in
[1:04:19] and and he had never gotten the
[1:04:21] revelation of justification
[1:04:24] justification means you didn't do it
[1:04:26] it's not attributed to you and he went
[1:04:28] and it's a shame perhaps that he had
[1:04:30] never heard justification preached in
[1:04:32] the message and he went out and he heard
[1:04:34] a nominal Minister preach on
[1:04:35] justification he came to one of the
[1:04:36] deacons he said listen to this this is
[1:04:39] amazing
[1:04:40] the brother said yeah that's the first
[1:04:42] work of Grace he says I've never heard
[1:04:44] this before and he went out and that's
[1:04:46] what he followed for the rest of his
[1:04:47] days and he's still alive today and
[1:04:49] that's as far as he got but he had never
[1:04:50] gotten to the point and his conscience
[1:04:52] had bothered him all of his life because
[1:04:54] he'd never gotten to the place where he
[1:04:55] recognized that under the blood God
[1:04:57] can't even see your sins and so he was
[1:05:00] never free he was never free from his
[1:05:02] own failures and his own consciences and
[1:05:04] I know people today that have gotten to
[1:05:05] that place that got to the place where
[1:05:07] all they could see was their own
[1:05:08] failures their inability to live the
[1:05:10] life that was in the word and so they
[1:05:12] what they stopped right there they
[1:05:14] couldn't get under the blood they
[1:05:15] couldn't recognize the effect of the
[1:05:16] blood and today they're right where they
[1:05:18] always were unable to live it and so
[1:05:20] they're sitting miserable outside of the
[1:05:22] presence of God Amen
[1:05:26] let's go back to our opening scripture
[1:05:28] here and start to maybe open this up a
[1:05:30] little bit Ephesians 2 verse 1 says and
[1:05:32] you had the quick and who are dead in
[1:05:34] trespasses and sins we preached on this
[1:05:36] way back when we did the Joshua and
[1:05:38] Ephesians series amen but I want you to
[1:05:40] realize that every one of us were dead
[1:05:42] in trespasses and sin that's not for the
[1:05:45] the unbeliever that's outside of the
[1:05:47] message that's not the the person that
[1:05:48] was raised outside of a good Christian
[1:05:50] home this is every single one of us
[1:05:52] we're dead in trespassing sin the moment
[1:05:54] we were born we were dead and
[1:05:56] trespassing sin and our our intellectual
[1:05:58] ability to nod our head to what was
[1:06:00] being said behind the pulpit did not
[1:06:01] make us any less it dead in our
[1:06:03] trespasses and sins amen the Bible says
[1:06:05] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:06:07] glory of God
[1:06:08] he says wherein in times past ye walked
[1:06:11] according to the course of this world
[1:06:12] according to the prince of the power of
[1:06:15] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:06:17] the children of Disobedience again we've
[1:06:19] covered this before but our natural
[1:06:21] inclination is Disobedience to the word
[1:06:23] of God there is nothing in US Naturally
[1:06:26] Speaking that wants to do what the word
[1:06:28] of God says so he says every one of us
[1:06:30] are subject to the power of the air the
[1:06:32] Prince of Darkness and we are by Nature
[1:06:34] the children of Wrath it says fulfilling
[1:06:37] sorry yes among whom also we had all our
[1:06:39] conversation in times past in the lusts
[1:06:42] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:06:44] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[1:06:47] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:06:50] others amen so this is a spirit of
[1:06:52] Disobedience to the word of God and that
[1:06:54] spirit is a spirit that is proud because
[1:06:56] it cannot humble itself to the word of
[1:06:59] God and because it cannot humble itself
[1:07:01] to the spirit of God to the word of God
[1:07:03] it will always be proud and arrogant
[1:07:05] towards the word of God Amen it will
[1:07:08] always be about itself and it will never
[1:07:10] humble itself and therefore it can never
[1:07:11] act in Godly love so it is always a
[1:07:14] selfish motive that's going to drive a
[1:07:15] child of Disobedience it's always about
[1:07:17] me me me amen he says what we had our
[1:07:20] conversation that means our way of life
[1:07:22] our natural way is as a child of God's
[1:07:24] Wrath under the Judgment of God that's
[1:07:26] the way we naturally are until we get
[1:07:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:30] but I love verse 4 because it says but
[1:07:32] God who is rich in Mercy rich
[1:07:35] rich not just a little bit
[1:07:38] you don't you ever go to somebody's
[1:07:40] house and they only have a little bit of
[1:07:41] something what do they do they just give
[1:07:42] everyone a little bit God doesn't God
[1:07:44] doesn't have just a little bit of Mercy
[1:07:46] he's rich in Mercy he's rich in Mercy
[1:07:48] amen he wants to forgive you more than
[1:07:50] you want to be forgiven let me put it
[1:07:52] that way for with his great love
[1:07:53] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:07:56] dead in sins I love that word even
[1:07:58] because that would mean although it's
[1:07:59] not typical or reasonable
[1:08:02] probably doesn't make sense but even
[1:08:04] because even in that condition when we
[1:08:06] were dead in sins he had quickened us
[1:08:08] he's made us alive together with Christ
[1:08:09] and it says by Grace ye are saved
[1:08:14] now I want to take this and I want
[1:08:15] there's a timeline of Grace that's built
[1:08:17] into this scripture here and I want to
[1:08:19] walk through this because I want to get
[1:08:21] this home it's something that the Lord's
[1:08:22] been dealing with me on personally and
[1:08:24] so I thought I'd bring it to the church
[1:08:25] as we did this so the timeline of Grace
[1:08:27] if we look at this is that we were first
[1:08:30] children of Wrath deserving of death
[1:08:32] right if you're under God's judgment
[1:08:34] then death is the thing that you deserve
[1:08:36] he says then what Grace is applied to us
[1:08:39] as a second stage and then because that
[1:08:42] Grace is applied we become the children
[1:08:43] of God we're accepted in the Beloved
[1:08:45] okay
[1:08:47] so if I were to to change this maybe
[1:08:49] into modern words I would say that we
[1:08:51] start out that the person is wrong
[1:08:54] they're deserving death still Grace is
[1:08:56] applied and they become a child of God
[1:08:59] but now that's how we receive Grace
[1:09:01] but I want to talk about how we give
[1:09:03] Grace because what often happens is that
[1:09:07] we reverse this around and so we say
[1:09:09] that someone is a child of God and we
[1:09:11] put a conditional requirement on our
[1:09:13] Grace if they're a child of God then
[1:09:14] we'll show them Grace if we believe then
[1:09:16] to be a child of God we'll show them
[1:09:18] Grace then the person does something
[1:09:20] wrong they're deserving of a penalty or
[1:09:22] judgment and and then Grace is applied
[1:09:25] but that's not Grace
[1:09:27] that's not Grace if we put a condition
[1:09:29] on who the person is before we do the
[1:09:32] right thing to them then that is not
[1:09:34] Grace it's far from it amen see so often
[1:09:37] what happens and I've talked to my wife
[1:09:39] about this and a couple others
[1:09:40] throughout the last week or so as God
[1:09:42] was dealing with with me on this so
[1:09:44] often what we have is we have a close
[1:09:46] friend close friends people we have good
[1:09:48] relationships with people we've known a
[1:09:50] long time and as we spend time with
[1:09:53] those people they build up a bank of
[1:09:55] Goodwill in our lives
[1:09:56] okay so let me pick brother Gerald since
[1:10:00] he's the oldest one amongst us
[1:10:02] brother Gerald could walk up to me and
[1:10:04] slap me across the face and I would
[1:10:05] forgive him
[1:10:07] you know why because brother Gerald has
[1:10:10] gotten to the place where he's done so
[1:10:11] much good in my life that it would take
[1:10:13] more than a slap in the face to ever
[1:10:15] take him out of my life or cause me to
[1:10:17] push him away
[1:10:19] but
[1:10:20] that's not Grace
[1:10:23] that's me taking all the value that
[1:10:26] brother Gerald has added to my life I'm
[1:10:28] treating it like I'm a banker now and
[1:10:30] he's built up a massive deposit of good
[1:10:33] things into my life and that what he
[1:10:34] does he comes in and with that one slap
[1:10:36] he says I'm going to take a withdrawal
[1:10:37] today
[1:10:38] so I say you've got plenty in the bank
[1:10:40] brother take your withdrawal and we
[1:10:42] forgive and we forget and we move on and
[1:10:44] nothing changes in our relationship
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:47] that's not Grace
[1:10:49] That's Good Will based on how much that
[1:10:51] person has done for me amen we're
[1:10:53] gracious and we forgive and forget but
[1:10:55] we're not actually being gracious we're
[1:10:57] just saying the value you put into my
[1:10:58] life is greater than the value that
[1:11:01] you're pulling out now in terms of what
[1:11:02] you're requiring of me and my Christian
[1:11:04] character amen
[1:11:07] but that's not the way it works Romans 4
[1:11:09] says for If Abraham was justified by
[1:11:11] works he hath whereup to Glory but not
[1:11:14] before God what is saying that Abraham
[1:11:16] wasn't deemed that if Abraham was deemed
[1:11:19] not guilty or righteous because of his
[1:11:21] Good Deeds the neighborhood would have a
[1:11:23] reason to boast
[1:11:25] it says for what saith the scripture
[1:11:27] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:11:29] unto him for righteousness so Abraham's
[1:11:32] faith in God is what God accepted and
[1:11:34] credited to Abraham's account
[1:11:36] even as if he had done the right thing
[1:11:39] all his life
[1:11:41] but we know that's not the case with
[1:11:42] Abraham Abraham did more wrong than
[1:11:44] right in his life in terms of what the
[1:11:46] scripture documents about his life he
[1:11:48] kept leaving the promised land he kept
[1:11:50] getting in trouble with with the
[1:11:51] different Kings and whatnot his wife
[1:11:53] kept getting taken away from him because
[1:11:55] he kept lying about her Abraham and his
[1:11:57] life did more wrong than right in terms
[1:11:59] of the major decisions of his life but
[1:12:01] it says God credited it to his account
[1:12:03] because he believed the promise
[1:12:04] nonetheless
[1:12:06] okay so Abraham he says did not deserve
[1:12:09] this by works but it was his faith that
[1:12:11] God said gave him credit and God deemed
[1:12:14] that as righteous he says now to him
[1:12:16] that worketh is the reward not reckoned
[1:12:19] of Grace but of debt so this is the key
[1:12:22] to Grace that what it can't be earned
[1:12:26] so if somebody earns something from you
[1:12:28] then you can't be giving them Grace back
[1:12:30] that's not Grace that's just good will
[1:12:32] that's just you being a nice person
[1:12:34] that's just you saying that yes you've
[1:12:36] done enough to me that I'll look past
[1:12:37] this little thing amen guess what my
[1:12:40] point in this is if you try to earn
[1:12:42] Grace God can't give it to you if you
[1:12:44] try and go to God and say now I'm worthy
[1:12:46] of your grace he'll say I can't I don't
[1:12:49] have any Grace to give you because
[1:12:50] you're earning it
[1:12:51] so everything you've done I'll give you
[1:12:53] based on what you've earned but I can't
[1:12:54] give you Grace and guess what Grace is
[1:12:56] so much more than what I could ever earn
[1:12:57] with my Works choose Grace every single
[1:13:00] time amen now contrast that to giving
[1:13:02] Grace because when someone has done you
[1:13:04] all these good things will quickly
[1:13:06] forgive and forget
[1:13:08] because they've earned it
[1:13:09] and then we think we're being gracious
[1:13:12] we are being christ-like because he said
[1:13:14] turn the cheek you know do these things
[1:13:15] look back that I read in in Proverbs
[1:13:17] where I was talking about a wise man he
[1:13:20] says he covers Mischief he takes an
[1:13:22] insult
[1:13:24] okay you can be a Christian and do that
[1:13:25] but don't think you're being gracious
[1:13:27] you're just turning the other cheek so
[1:13:29] to speak
[1:13:30] if we go back it says but to him that
[1:13:32] worketh not
[1:13:34] but believeth on him that justified the
[1:13:36] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:13:38] righteousness even as David also
[1:13:40] described this blessedness of the man
[1:13:42] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[1:13:45] without works
[1:13:46] this is what Grace is church because the
[1:13:48] person is made righteous without being
[1:13:50] righteous
[1:13:51] amen purely because they have believed
[1:13:54] God and expressed their faith in their
[1:13:56] decisions
[1:13:57] and David said blessed are they whose
[1:13:59] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[1:14:01] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[1:14:04] the Lord will not impute sin
[1:14:06] so in other words blessed is the person
[1:14:09] that God won't ever credit sin to their
[1:14:11] account even though they've done things
[1:14:13] wrong
[1:14:15] that's what Grace is is when you've done
[1:14:17] wrong they won't credit it to your
[1:14:19] account
[1:14:20] they're not even looking at accounts
[1:14:22] because if they looked at the accounts
[1:14:24] they realized there was nothing there to
[1:14:25] draw on most of the time so they just
[1:14:27] say I'm not even going to look at the
[1:14:28] account I'm just going to respond the
[1:14:30] way you need to be responded to as
[1:14:32] Christ would amen
[1:14:34] we see that with Abraham like I said you
[1:14:36] see his major decisions he made a lot of
[1:14:38] bad Majors decisions and sometimes his
[1:14:40] decisions weren't bad is that they were
[1:14:41] incomplete
[1:14:43] incomplete we don't go all the way
[1:14:45] that's what he did remember God said
[1:14:47] pull him out leave your family what'd he
[1:14:48] do he took his father and he took lot
[1:14:50] and then his father died so that held
[1:14:52] him back for a few years and then he
[1:14:54] took lot and that held him back and he
[1:14:55] got into fights and then lot ended up
[1:14:57] going into a place he shouldn't have
[1:14:58] been in losing his wife getting into an
[1:15:01] incestuous relationship with his
[1:15:02] daughters so he messed up lot's life
[1:15:04] probably by bringing them along and then
[1:15:05] taking him to a place of great
[1:15:06] Temptation then finally he gets out of
[1:15:08] there and he starts going into the
[1:15:10] different lands and these different
[1:15:11] things Abraham's actions were not
[1:15:12] particularly great but in the end he
[1:15:14] believed God and that's what God
[1:15:16] accounted to him brother Brown puts it
[1:15:18] this way he says God's children
[1:15:19] unconditionally you don't deserve your
[1:15:22] healing tonight there's not a one of us
[1:15:24] in here deserves to even hear the gospel
[1:15:26] wow
[1:15:27] there's not a one of you deserves the
[1:15:29] grace of Jesus Christ none of us we're
[1:15:31] all together but God by Grace has did it
[1:15:35] anyhow that's right there's none of you
[1:15:37] deserve your healing every one of you
[1:15:39] ought to die me too all of us we're not
[1:15:41] deserving to live on the earth that's
[1:15:43] right we're not even deserving to look
[1:15:44] at God's creation but
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:49] God has promised us and he cannot lie he
[1:15:52] swore that he would do it healing
[1:15:54] belongs to us amen salvation belongs to
[1:15:57] us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven
[1:16:00] belongs to us now we are the sons of God
[1:16:03] now we're sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:16:05] Christ Jesus and there's nothing can
[1:16:07] harm us
[1:16:08] he says the same God was watching
[1:16:11] Abraham in his mistake
[1:16:14] the same God was watching brother
[1:16:16] Jonathan in his mistakes
[1:16:18] God made Abraham pay for it don't you
[1:16:22] think he got by with it but God didn't
[1:16:24] cast Abraham out he just made Abraham
[1:16:28] repent for it
[1:16:31] he says and you think you're not worthy
[1:16:32] to be healed tonight now the reason I'm
[1:16:34] saying this is because I know what
[1:16:36] you're thinking someone says well I'm
[1:16:38] not worthy I guess maybe I've done this
[1:16:39] get that out of your mind sure you're
[1:16:43] not and you'll never be but Jesus is and
[1:16:46] he's the one who gave it to you
[1:16:48] he's the one who paid the price
[1:16:50] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:16:52] freely from The Fountains of the Water
[1:16:54] of Life it was so perfect that we sang
[1:16:56] on what
[1:16:57] there is a what a well there is a spring
[1:17:01] that never runs dry
[1:17:03] he says God has made an unconditional
[1:17:05] Covenant he swore by the death of Jesus
[1:17:08] Christ he sent the Holy Ghost back upon
[1:17:10] you to be a confirmation that the
[1:17:12] Covenant is made with you brother I
[1:17:15] don't want the devil to rob you out of
[1:17:17] that
[1:17:19] he said
[1:17:20] Jehovah Jireh says now he's making the
[1:17:22] abrahamic Covenant and the abrahamic
[1:17:24] Covenant according to Genesis the 12th
[1:17:26] chapter it was given unconditionally
[1:17:28] therefore it's Eternal because it's
[1:17:31] unconditional because if you look in
[1:17:34] contract law there are clauses that say
[1:17:36] if you do this then this contract is
[1:17:38] null and void
[1:17:39] we'll do this and you'll do that but if
[1:17:41] you don't do that then we don't have to
[1:17:42] do this but brother I'm saying because
[1:17:44] God said I'm going to do it and it was
[1:17:46] not conditional on you it is eternal
[1:17:49] because God's the only one that's got to
[1:17:50] do anything so it's Eternal because he
[1:17:52] is eternal
[1:17:53] amen not if you will I will he said I
[1:17:57] have I've already done it not I will
[1:17:59] done it do it I have done it he says oh
[1:18:02] that base is Faith see God is determined
[1:18:05] to save man
[1:18:07] if he makes a covenant if you will I
[1:18:10] will he'd break it he's talking about
[1:18:11] man would another one you will I will he
[1:18:15] broke it and that's what happened with
[1:18:16] the law with Adam and Eve all of us
[1:18:19] every time he says I'll do it if you do
[1:18:21] it we end up not doing it and that
[1:18:23] doesn't allow him to do it so he says I
[1:18:25] got to get past this so I'm going to
[1:18:26] make a an oath by myself
[1:18:28] man can't keep his Covenant so God Saves
[1:18:32] Man by his grace under a covenant that's
[1:18:34] unconditional an unconditional Covenant
[1:18:36] oh my never-ending that was all of it
[1:18:39] three Perfect Adam Noah and Abraham now
[1:18:42] that's the reason we are Abraham's
[1:18:44] children that Covenant can never end
[1:18:46] because it's unconditional
[1:18:47] listen to this now it isn't because you
[1:18:51] do something
[1:18:52] it's because God did past tense God did
[1:18:57] something not because you chose God God
[1:19:01] chose you
[1:19:03] and he says can you believe it
[1:19:05] amen we're here because we believe it
[1:19:07] this morning amen we're here because we
[1:19:09] have believed it and we believe that
[1:19:10] he's more than able to do what he's
[1:19:12] promised he was going to do amen listen
[1:19:14] but I say all this
[1:19:16] because we look at this and we see the
[1:19:18] great grace for us
[1:19:20] we see the great grace for us we we
[1:19:22] identify ourselves in here your amens as
[1:19:25] we said that identifies that you've been
[1:19:27] you you've received that Grace amen
[1:19:29] but then what happens when God forbids
[1:19:31] somebody does something to us
[1:19:33] and we put them outside of that Grace
[1:19:36] and what do we say Well they're not
[1:19:38] really saved they don't really have the
[1:19:40] Holy Ghost they haven't had a new birth
[1:19:42] they don't act the way I want to act
[1:19:44] they keep doing this they keep doing
[1:19:45] that and what do we do is we put
[1:19:47] conditions on what we're going to do
[1:19:48] when we respond to them amen and so what
[1:19:51] happens in these situations is there is
[1:19:53] no Grace there and we say the person's
[1:19:55] wrong and therefore death is applied
[1:19:58] that's what happens so often
[1:20:00] because what happens in catch this is
[1:20:03] we'll take that person and we'll say
[1:20:04] they're not a part of the body of Christ
[1:20:06] and we'll we'll pull Grace out of the
[1:20:08] equation and we'll hand them over to
[1:20:10] judgment
[1:20:11] that's not the way it works
[1:20:13] because even while we were yet sinners
[1:20:15] God died for us right the grace was
[1:20:17] applied before we were ever in a
[1:20:19] condition to what deserve it
[1:20:22] amen but what happens is we dehumanize
[1:20:25] and we de-christianize and we pull them
[1:20:27] out we spiritualize their condition
[1:20:31] so that what it can justifies to treat
[1:20:33] them in a way that maybe we wouldn't
[1:20:34] treat a True Believer in our heads amen
[1:20:37] now the first time it's easy
[1:20:39] now to do it the first time you forgive
[1:20:41] but let someone keep working on you for
[1:20:43] a while
[1:20:44] we're going to get to what the scripture
[1:20:46] says about that but let someone keep
[1:20:47] doing it 70 times seven times in a day
[1:20:49] and then see if maybe Grace is still
[1:20:52] sitting in this equation or if we jump
[1:20:53] to just there wrong and therefore
[1:20:55] they're under judgment
[1:20:57] that's the human nature is to do this
[1:20:59] is to take Grace completely outside of
[1:21:01] it amen now I know this is direct and
[1:21:04] it's direct because God's been very
[1:21:05] direct with me about this and I believe
[1:21:07] that the church needs to hear this
[1:21:08] because if he's dealing with one chances
[1:21:10] are he can deal with all of us if
[1:21:12] nothing else is a warning because we're
[1:21:13] all in the same bodies amen we still
[1:21:15] deal with these sorts of things because
[1:21:17] Satan loves to drive wedges in he loves
[1:21:20] to drive wedges in remember if he can
[1:21:21] break up the unity of a group of
[1:21:23] Believers then he's got us on the run
[1:21:25] the Sheep get scattered and all of a
[1:21:26] sudden he can pick us off one by one and
[1:21:28] where does he start he starts with our
[1:21:31] attitude if he can get your attitude
[1:21:34] wrong
[1:21:35] remember brother Brown said the right
[1:21:36] mental attitude towards any promise of
[1:21:38] God will bring it to pass in your life
[1:21:39] guess what the wrong mental attitude
[1:21:41] towards any believer or promise of God
[1:21:43] will take it right out of your life as
[1:21:44] well so if he can get your attitude
[1:21:46] wrong he's got you whipped every single
[1:21:49] time
[1:21:50] so he loves to drive that wedge in and
[1:21:52] he starts with an attitude problem
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] listen brother Bob says Grace is what
[1:21:58] God did for me works is what I do for
[1:22:01] God he says now they'll make a Doctrine
[1:22:04] out of it they think that works is what
[1:22:06] wins your marriage he says if it is it
[1:22:08] isn't a free gift Grace is what God did
[1:22:10] for you by Grace you're saved and works
[1:22:13] is what you do in appreciation of the
[1:22:15] grace that he showed to you and if you
[1:22:18] love him you like to do the works of the
[1:22:20] Lord certainly because then you love him
[1:22:23] amen now watch the attitude now because
[1:22:26] this is what it looks like in real life
[1:22:27] and I've read this quote many years ago
[1:22:29] I know but let's listen to it again
[1:22:31] tonight because here's the attitude of
[1:22:33] Grace
[1:22:34] a lot of people say now you scratch my
[1:22:36] back and I'll scratch yours yeah you do
[1:22:38] something for me and I'll do something
[1:22:40] for you that's not Grace
[1:22:43] now watch what Grace is
[1:22:45] Grace is if your back is itching I'll
[1:22:48] scratch it anyhow whether you scratch
[1:22:51] mine or not you can slap me on the face
[1:22:53] and say my back needs scratching I'll
[1:22:55] scratch it
[1:22:57] see that's it do something I don't
[1:23:01] believe in works I believe that works is
[1:23:04] Love Now catch this next line he says
[1:23:06] works is the manifestation that Grace
[1:23:09] has taken place I'm going to read it
[1:23:12] again works is the manifestation that
[1:23:15] Grace has taken place in other words how
[1:23:17] you act shows whether or not you've
[1:23:20] received Grace in the first place
[1:23:23] I don't live true to my wife because I
[1:23:25] believe she divorced me if I didn't I
[1:23:27] lived true to her because I love her
[1:23:31] so we see then that Grace is for what
[1:23:33] the person that has done nothing to earn
[1:23:35] a nice a good a soft response that has
[1:23:39] no banked value in your life that has no
[1:23:41] relationship to call on
[1:23:43] that's what Grace is for Grace is for
[1:23:45] the one that has nothing deserving in
[1:23:47] your life and yet you give the right
[1:23:49] response regardless amen as we said
[1:23:51] before Grace's unmerited favor
[1:23:54] and because it is undeserving it has to
[1:23:56] be Limitless
[1:23:58] yeah
[1:23:59] because it's undeserving it has to be
[1:24:01] Limitless
[1:24:02] that's what Christ was it was full of
[1:24:04] grace and truth we're going to read in a
[1:24:06] little bit amen he was full of grace you
[1:24:08] have to have that Grace to have the
[1:24:10] nature of God inside of you amen that
[1:24:11] doesn't mean we don't hold each other
[1:24:13] accountable
[1:24:14] amen that doesn't mean we let people run
[1:24:15] roughshod over us that doesn't mean that
[1:24:18] the word standard goes out the door and
[1:24:19] Grace means that you never you never say
[1:24:22] anything to anybody about anything no no
[1:24:24] no no no but how you say it is going to
[1:24:26] determine whether Grace comes forward
[1:24:27] and if your love is going to be that of
[1:24:29] Christ then there's going to be a
[1:24:30] difference in the way you approach it
[1:24:31] amen but we've got an obligation I've
[1:24:33] I've been reading through some of the
[1:24:35] things Paul said about church order and
[1:24:36] I'll tell you he was pretty rough when
[1:24:38] it came to church order
[1:24:40] Paul didn't play any games when it came
[1:24:41] to church order he says if you got an
[1:24:43] issue with somebody you go to him you
[1:24:44] see somebody doing something they ought
[1:24:45] to be doing you go to them he says and
[1:24:48] if they don't listen to you take another
[1:24:49] one if they don't listen to you then you
[1:24:50] take them before the church and if they
[1:24:52] don't listen to the church and kick them
[1:24:53] out that's pretty scary stuff
[1:24:55] remember when ananias and Sapphira
[1:24:57] conspired they said that whatever we
[1:24:59] sell this land for the prophet will give
[1:25:01] to the church then they came in and they
[1:25:03] held some back and what did Peter say
[1:25:04] why did you desire to why did you
[1:25:06] conspire to deceive the Holy Ghost
[1:25:09] and they both died right there
[1:25:11] it was it was scary in Paul's day
[1:25:14] he was talking about you know that young
[1:25:15] man that took his father's wife who
[1:25:18] and he said kick him out of the church
[1:25:21] kick him out of the church he says for
[1:25:23] what the the destruction of his body and
[1:25:25] for the saving of his soul and then he
[1:25:27] comes back in second Corinthians and he
[1:25:28] says oh I just I I did that in tears I
[1:25:31] didn't want to do it but you had to do
[1:25:33] it you had to do it for his sake but now
[1:25:35] go back and restore him go back and
[1:25:37] restore him you know what sounded so
[1:25:39] harsh but they said no go back and
[1:25:40] restore him he's learned his lesson so
[1:25:42] come back and bring him back in if he'll
[1:25:43] come in again you know
[1:25:45] but it was it was it was still harsh in
[1:25:47] those times
[1:25:49] and we we had to hold each other
[1:25:51] accountable in those times and I think
[1:25:52] we've lost a bit of that these days
[1:25:54] because we're too kind sometimes there
[1:25:56] we're too forgiving and what we end up
[1:25:57] doing is we let people go down a path
[1:25:59] that if we were maybe a little quicker
[1:26:01] in love to help them they wouldn't go
[1:26:02] down as far and they wouldn't get into
[1:26:03] such trouble as they do sometimes amen
[1:26:06] amen the bride is here as long as the
[1:26:08] bride is here there's Mercy there's
[1:26:10] blood on the mercy seat and so I believe
[1:26:11] that our every opportunity should be to
[1:26:14] offer mercy and Grace amen amen as long
[1:26:17] as we're here hey even in the end the
[1:26:18] end the Book of Revelation says the the
[1:26:20] spirit and the bride say one thing come
[1:26:22] she's always beckoning she's always
[1:26:24] trying to draw people in to the love of
[1:26:26] Christ amen let's go back to Romans 4.
[1:26:30] verse 6 it says and he hath raised us up
[1:26:33] together and made us sit together in
[1:26:34] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:26:37] the ages to come he might show the
[1:26:40] exceeding Riches of his grace how in his
[1:26:44] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[1:26:47] remember we just read that works is the
[1:26:49] manifestation that Grace has taken
[1:26:50] places taken place so if we've receive
[1:26:53] the exceeding Riches of his grace what
[1:26:55] are our works to him and to others ought
[1:26:57] to look like
[1:26:58] amen I want to stop there because it and
[1:27:01] talk about that bit it says the
[1:27:03] exceeding Riches of his grace and his
[1:27:05] kindness towards us because we see that
[1:27:07] in Christ time and time again regardless
[1:27:09] of his condition
[1:27:11] listen remember that they brought it to
[1:27:13] him the woman caught in the very Act of
[1:27:15] adultery the very act so there was no
[1:27:18] question at all that she was guilty
[1:27:19] remember and Jesus he gets down he
[1:27:22] Stoops and he writes in the dirt and
[1:27:24] from the oldest to the youngest they all
[1:27:25] left after they read what he wrote I'm
[1:27:27] really curious to know what he wrote
[1:27:28] there
[1:27:29] but after it was all done said and done
[1:27:31] we have a guilty adulterous woman there
[1:27:33] and we have Jesus Christ standing there
[1:27:36] and he says woman where are thine
[1:27:37] accusers she says there are none and he
[1:27:40] said what neither do I accuse thee go
[1:27:42] and sin no more amen he knew she was
[1:27:45] guilty
[1:27:46] but he also knew the word and the word
[1:27:48] said you had to have two or three
[1:27:49] witnesses to judge anyone so he wasn't
[1:27:51] enough and so he went back what with the
[1:27:54] kindest thing he could and said the word
[1:27:55] allows me to let you go I'm Gonna Let
[1:27:57] You Go don't do it again
[1:27:59] Dan what does he do he's on the cross
[1:28:03] he's on the cross he's an absolutely
[1:28:05] excruciating Agony and pain and
[1:28:07] suffering he's about to die he's nailed
[1:28:09] between two thieves one of them's giving
[1:28:11] him a hard time and the other one is
[1:28:13] saying Lord remember me when you're in
[1:28:15] paradise and what is he says he says
[1:28:16] remember you when you when you get your
[1:28:18] kingdom he says this day you'll be with
[1:28:20] me in Paradise
[1:28:22] that man was guilty listen he wasn't
[1:28:24] just guilty once you don't kill a thief
[1:28:26] because he steals once you kill a thief
[1:28:28] because he steals and he steals and he
[1:28:30] steals and he steals he never learns his
[1:28:31] lesson that's why they end up on a cross
[1:28:33] this was a thief of all thieves And yet
[1:28:36] when he showed the right attitude when
[1:28:37] he asked for forgiveness
[1:28:39] and he was kind to Christ Christ came
[1:28:41] back he says you'll have eternal life
[1:28:42] because of what you've done here amen
[1:28:43] that kindness is a the Hallmark of
[1:28:46] Christ amen
[1:28:48] I want to read a scripture here and if
[1:28:50] there's anything that you take out of
[1:28:51] this service it's this next quote it's
[1:28:54] the most amazing thing I think and if
[1:28:56] you've ever received Grace it'll really
[1:28:58] resonate with you brother Brown says
[1:29:00] that's the reason our sins today we'd
[1:29:02] everyone be condemned but God can't take
[1:29:04] us because if he does he hurts Christ we
[1:29:07] are part of him we are the bride don't
[1:29:09] you see so there it is now catch this he
[1:29:12] says Grace holds us in our mistakes
[1:29:15] until we can see better
[1:29:19] Grace holds us in our mistakes it
[1:29:21] protects us until we can see better he
[1:29:24] says I'm so thankful for that amen isn't
[1:29:27] that just the way it is I would probably
[1:29:29] maybe expect the older ones to know this
[1:29:32] more than the younger ones at this point
[1:29:33] but I remember as a young man and and so
[1:29:35] full of myself in so many ways and yet
[1:29:38] in all of my Folly and all of my naivety
[1:29:41] and all of my silliness and all of my
[1:29:42] high opinions and pride yet God didn't
[1:29:45] just come along and just whacked me
[1:29:46] across the head and say you stupid man
[1:29:48] he didn't he didn't he let me bumble
[1:29:52] along in my foolishness
[1:29:54] and tell him one day the grace pulled
[1:29:57] the scales off my eyes and I saw that
[1:29:59] there was so much more to be had than
[1:30:00] what I had there was so much more growth
[1:30:03] to be had there was so much more of God
[1:30:04] there was so much more of the word there
[1:30:06] was so much more of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:07] there was so much more Victory and
[1:30:09] overcoming and what did it do it humbled
[1:30:11] me so that he could actually start to
[1:30:13] work through me and use me but it was
[1:30:15] Grace that held me until I could see
[1:30:18] better as a young husband as a young
[1:30:20] father I wasn't raised with a good
[1:30:22] example in my home
[1:30:24] so I didn't know how to be a good dad I
[1:30:27] didn't know how to be a good father and
[1:30:29] what was it Grace held me until God
[1:30:32] could open my eyes and say you need to
[1:30:34] do better at this you need to do a whole
[1:30:36] lot more than you're doing right now
[1:30:37] bucko and it was Grace that opened my
[1:30:40] eyes
[1:30:42] it was Grace that held me and then in
[1:30:44] his time and in his place he opened my
[1:30:46] eyes gently so I could see it and I
[1:30:48] could receive what he had waiting for me
[1:30:51] so that I could grow in Christ it was
[1:30:53] Grace that held me through it amen what
[1:30:56] a wonderful thing it is to have Grace
[1:30:57] Hold Us until Grace opens our eyes to
[1:31:00] what he wants to do in our lives amen so
[1:31:03] that we can look past our Human
[1:31:04] Condition remember the laodicean
[1:31:06] condition is that they think they're
[1:31:09] rich increased with Goods have needed
[1:31:11] nothing and it's not just physical it's
[1:31:13] a religious spirit we're talking about a
[1:31:16] religious spirit and he says you can't
[1:31:18] see that you are miserable wretched
[1:31:21] blind naked
[1:31:24] and I'm speaking to myself and say there
[1:31:27] was early times and there are still
[1:31:29] times no doubt because if you're blind
[1:31:30] you don't know what you don't know
[1:31:32] you can't see what you can't see because
[1:31:34] you can't see
[1:31:36] and he's saying God's grace holds you
[1:31:39] and the blood of Christ covers you so
[1:31:41] that he doesn't look at your foolishness
[1:31:43] and your sin until the time is ready for
[1:31:45] him to bring that son or daughter up
[1:31:47] into another step into another plane
[1:31:49] into another level because he needs to
[1:31:51] use you now he needs to move you to
[1:31:53] another level so that you can have an
[1:31:54] effect in the local body so you can have
[1:31:56] the right effect in your family so you
[1:31:58] can have the right effect in your
[1:31:59] co-workers but as Grace that holds us
[1:32:02] there amen and then as soon as our eyes
[1:32:04] are open what do we do we say
[1:32:06] how did anion not see this before
[1:32:09] what held me back
[1:32:13] Foolish Pride usually
[1:32:16] Foolish Pride
[1:32:19] but his grace held me until he could
[1:32:21] open my eyes amen Grace holds us in our
[1:32:24] mistakes until we can see better
[1:32:27] Romans 4 8 says for by grace are ye
[1:32:30] saved through faith and that not of
[1:32:31] yourselves it is the gift of God not by
[1:32:36] works not of Works lest any man should
[1:32:38] boast so listen works is never a reason
[1:32:40] to boast is it
[1:32:42] if where we are where we are by Grace
[1:32:44] every single time then why are we
[1:32:46] boasting about what we've done for him
[1:32:48] it has no place remember Timothy warned
[1:32:51] us in the last time so what will come
[1:32:52] boasters remember
[1:32:55] proud that's what he would we would be
[1:32:58] dealing with in the last stage me me me
[1:32:59] me me I I I I I that has no place in the
[1:33:02] life of a Believer no place the works of
[1:33:05] William Branham and he ever all he ever
[1:33:07] did was he pointed the Christ every
[1:33:09] single time I can't do it I couldn't do
[1:33:11] it if I if I was left of my own thing
[1:33:13] the branhams they're alcoholics and
[1:33:14] they're they're this and they're that
[1:33:16] they're losers guess what branhams were
[1:33:17] losers
[1:33:18] half the curlets are losers too
[1:33:21] losers that's what we be without the
[1:33:23] grace of God Amen and that Prophet comes
[1:33:26] out of it and he says I could I didn't
[1:33:28] even have friends back then
[1:33:30] didn't even have friends
[1:33:32] he says and now I gotta run and hide
[1:33:34] away because there's so many people want
[1:33:36] to be my friend
[1:33:37] not because of him because of what God
[1:33:39] did through him amen
[1:33:42] verse 10 says it beautifully he says for
[1:33:44] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:33:47] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:33:49] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:33:51] them
[1:33:52] so even the fact that you're walking the
[1:33:54] way you walk today is his grace and he's
[1:33:56] the one that ordained it you think I
[1:33:59] chose it no no no
[1:34:00] no man can come to God except God draw
[1:34:02] him first and they says you are created
[1:34:04] by his workmanship not your own you
[1:34:08] can't fashion yourself the statue the
[1:34:10] the Masterpiece can't carve itself out
[1:34:12] it has to be carved out by somebody else
[1:34:15] so we start to close I want to take us
[1:34:17] to John 1 verse 12.
[1:34:20] says but as many as received him to them
[1:34:22] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:34:24] even to them that believe on his name
[1:34:26] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:34:29] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:34:31] but of God and the Word was made flesh
[1:34:34] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:34:36] glory the Glorious of the only begotten
[1:34:39] of the father full of what Truth full of
[1:34:42] grace and truth amen now John's a
[1:34:46] special man amongst the four gospel
[1:34:47] writers because he's the only Prophet
[1:34:49] amongst them all and so John looks at
[1:34:51] things through an Eagle View he sees it
[1:34:53] he doesn't just see it from a little bit
[1:34:55] higher but he sees it from eternity to
[1:34:57] Eternity he starts his gospel with in
[1:34:59] the beginning
[1:35:00] was the word and he brings it all the
[1:35:02] way down to his time and then he pushes
[1:35:04] all the way past it even amen but he
[1:35:06] wrote insights that the rest of the
[1:35:07] disciples never grasped because he had a
[1:35:10] prophetic eye he had a prophetic
[1:35:11] Ministry so he wrote prophetically he
[1:35:14] could see things in a way that other
[1:35:15] people weren't and his description of
[1:35:17] Christ is that he was full of two things
[1:35:19] Grace and Truth
[1:35:21] grace and truth and that's a really
[1:35:23] amazing thing to me today because people
[1:35:25] that have the truth or believe they have
[1:35:27] the truth are rarely gracious
[1:35:29] and you only have to spend three minutes
[1:35:31] on social media to figure that out amen
[1:35:33] very few people have the real truth and
[1:35:35] the wisdom to share it properly to get
[1:35:37] it across so that somebody can receive
[1:35:39] it without beating them between the eyes
[1:35:40] or punching them over the head or
[1:35:42] something like that amen people are so
[1:35:44] bound and determined to be right today
[1:35:45] in their positions in their beliefs that
[1:35:48] it turns them into argumentative devils
[1:35:50] that's what we have today argumentative
[1:35:52] devils and it's it's in the workplace
[1:35:54] it's in the message it's in the church
[1:35:56] it's in families and it rips people
[1:35:57] apart
[1:35:59] it rips people apart it's it's amazing
[1:36:02] I read a scripture in Proverbs and in my
[1:36:04] devotions a week ago and it stuck with
[1:36:05] me because it relates so often to that
[1:36:08] issue of of having truth but lacking
[1:36:11] Grace and I'm mostly absent from those
[1:36:13] social medias most of you know I have
[1:36:15] accounts on a couple of them and I'm on
[1:36:17] there mainly to see what my family does
[1:36:18] and share my pictures I don't engage I
[1:36:21] don't really write things that don't do
[1:36:22] anything on there but when I read this
[1:36:24] scripture in Proverbs I said this is
[1:36:26] something to myself to remember when
[1:36:28] you're on social media and I shared it
[1:36:29] with my wife as well but it says this in
[1:36:31] Proverbs 3 verse 30 it says strive not
[1:36:34] with a man without cause if he have done
[1:36:37] thee no harm
[1:36:39] the Amplified says do not quarrel with a
[1:36:42] man without cause if he has done you no
[1:36:44] harm
[1:36:46] can I phrase it in maybe even in a
[1:36:48] better way don't fight with somebody
[1:36:50] that hasn't done anything to you
[1:36:51] personally
[1:36:53] so don't get sucked into somebody else's
[1:36:55] problems don't get sucked into somebody
[1:36:57] else's politics don't get sucked into
[1:36:59] somebody else's passions don't get
[1:37:01] sucked into other people's jihads you
[1:37:03] know what a Jihad is
[1:37:05] it's a holy war and it is when a person
[1:37:08] spiritualizes their problem
[1:37:11] because they won't recognize the problem
[1:37:12] lies within not without and so they come
[1:37:15] into a place of spirituality
[1:37:18] and they start to draw other people into
[1:37:20] it to try and protect themselves rather
[1:37:21] than deal with the issue jihads I've
[1:37:23] seen it in message Believers time and
[1:37:25] time and time again on social media it
[1:37:27] never works and people get sucked into
[1:37:29] it and it drags them down into it amen
[1:37:31] don't get sucked into other people's
[1:37:32] habits
[1:37:33] don't get sucked into other people's
[1:37:35] pain don't get sucked into other
[1:37:36] people's history
[1:37:38] and don't get sucked in to other
[1:37:40] people's issues
[1:37:42] because what you're fighting a battle
[1:37:43] with somebody that hasn't done anything
[1:37:45] with you
[1:37:46] and here's the other thing you never
[1:37:47] know what the other side is saying or
[1:37:49] doing all you're going by is one side of
[1:37:51] the issue and another place in Proverbs
[1:37:52] it says a man is a fool who judges and
[1:37:55] only hears one side
[1:37:57] and that's what social media is and
[1:37:59] guess what everything on social media
[1:38:01] today the algorithms are are designed
[1:38:03] such as to do what provide confirmation
[1:38:06] bias you know what confirmation buy says
[1:38:08] confirmation bias is when you only read
[1:38:11] things that agree with your personal
[1:38:12] opinion or belief and everything there
[1:38:15] as soon as you like one thing it goes to
[1:38:17] look for other things that match that
[1:38:19] and keeps feeding it to you feeding it
[1:38:21] to you and you think because of the
[1:38:22] abundance of information you're
[1:38:24] receiving that is suddenly right
[1:38:26] it's not right it's a self-fulfilling
[1:38:28] prophecy when you like the first thing
[1:38:29] then it it decided it was going to give
[1:38:31] you all the rest of the things and so
[1:38:32] you continue in it and you're convinced
[1:38:34] of it it'll never give you a dissenting
[1:38:36] opinion
[1:38:38] it's not meant to because social media
[1:38:40] thrives on what controversy
[1:38:43] if everybody on there was being
[1:38:45] lovey-dovey then it would fold in a week
[1:38:47] because there's only four people that
[1:38:48] are lovey-dovey on there
[1:38:50] instead of the billions that are using
[1:38:51] it worldwide amen
[1:38:54] if we truly believe that what we have is
[1:38:55] the church is the truth
[1:38:57] our attitude will be way different than
[1:38:59] what we're seeing on social media these
[1:39:00] days
[1:39:01] that's not that say that people aren't
[1:39:03] going to get offended in Matthew 24
[1:39:05] Jesus said very clearly they're going to
[1:39:07] be offended
[1:39:08] and they're going to what betray you
[1:39:11] who can betray you there's only one
[1:39:12] people one set of people can betray you
[1:39:14] and that's those that are close to you
[1:39:15] in the first place isn't it family
[1:39:17] friends church members brother Joe let's
[1:39:19] talk about a judiciarian's pretended
[1:39:21] Brothers even those are the ones that
[1:39:23] are going to turn in the end is because
[1:39:24] they're offended because we stay with
[1:39:26] the word of God amen amen but let them
[1:39:28] be offended because we stayed with the
[1:39:29] word of God not because we preached it
[1:39:31] or we said it or did it in a way that
[1:39:33] was what mean
[1:39:35] harsh judgmental
[1:39:38] off-putting listen it's uncomfortable to
[1:39:41] be exposed under the light of the word
[1:39:43] and if you're living one way and the
[1:39:45] word says that's wrong then that's hard
[1:39:46] for somebody to do but if they can see
[1:39:48] that you mean it well then they'll maybe
[1:39:50] have a chance to accept it
[1:39:52] Proverbs 19 19 says this a brother
[1:39:54] offended is harder this is the Amplified
[1:39:57] now a brother offended is harder to win
[1:39:59] over than a fortified City and
[1:40:02] contentions that are separating families
[1:40:04] are like the bars of a castle
[1:40:08] now talking about our attitudes brother
[1:40:09] Brown says this think of it love and
[1:40:12] grace are sisters twin sisters you can't
[1:40:15] have Grace without having love
[1:40:18] that's why I said remember earlier I
[1:40:20] said that if we're under our natural
[1:40:22] inclinations we're under the the nature
[1:40:24] of the children of Wrath you can never
[1:40:25] act in God's love because you have to
[1:40:27] have Grace to have God's love and you
[1:40:29] have to have God's love to have Grace he
[1:40:31] says they're they're one and the same so
[1:40:32] once you receive God's grace if you're
[1:40:35] ever going to give it out you'll have to
[1:40:36] have the same Godly love that gave you
[1:40:38] the grace in the first place
[1:40:39] he says before you can actually show
[1:40:42] somebody a favor you love them right or
[1:40:45] wrong you have to love them anyhow or
[1:40:48] you can't
[1:40:49] wow
[1:40:50] you gotta love someone before you can
[1:40:52] show them Grace see so love and grace is
[1:40:55] the same thing they're just twin sisters
[1:40:56] that's all love and grace we can't see
[1:40:58] one without the other God so loved the
[1:41:01] world that's the love gave His only
[1:41:04] begotten son that's the grace
[1:41:06] he shed his grace and brought it in our
[1:41:09] hearts through the Holy Ghost see
[1:41:10] there's just nothing you can do without
[1:41:12] working one with the other the Grace
[1:41:15] Grace of God is what saves us
[1:41:18] so I read that to say this let us not
[1:41:21] say that our attitude is what offended
[1:41:22] somebody
[1:41:24] our approach is what offended somebody
[1:41:26] amen listen they're going to get
[1:41:28] offended at the word that's okay
[1:41:30] but let our not our conscience be
[1:41:31] triggered if our conscience is triggered
[1:41:33] let's make that right and then if our
[1:41:35] attitude if our approach was wrong even
[1:41:37] if our words were technically correct if
[1:41:39] our approach was wrong let us approach
[1:41:40] and say I'm sorry
[1:41:42] my Approach was wrong
[1:41:45] and I didn't help the situation when I
[1:41:46] did that amen
[1:41:49] listen people make accusations all the
[1:41:51] time
[1:41:52] the fact that there's an accusation out
[1:41:54] there doesn't make it true but when an
[1:41:56] accusation is made check your conscience
[1:41:58] and say is there any truth to it and if
[1:42:00] there is then go make the part that's
[1:42:02] wrong right amen amen
[1:42:05] John 1 says John bear witness of him and
[1:42:07] cried saying this was he of whom I spoke
[1:42:09] he that cometh after me is preferred
[1:42:12] before me for he was before me and of
[1:42:15] his fullness have all we received and
[1:42:17] Grace for Grace now I read that and I
[1:42:19] said what in the world does that mean uh
[1:42:22] Grace for grace and I looked in the
[1:42:24] amplifier and it's the most beautiful
[1:42:25] scripture it says for out of his
[1:42:27] abundance we have all had a share and we
[1:42:31] were all supplied with one Grace after
[1:42:34] another spiritual blessing upon
[1:42:36] spiritual blessing and even favor upon
[1:42:40] favor and gift heaped upon gift
[1:42:44] amen haven't we received that can't you
[1:42:47] say that in one day we receive this sort
[1:42:49] of a Grace every day amen that he gives
[1:42:51] us good things and good things and mercy
[1:42:54] and Grace and gift after gift and favor
[1:42:57] after favor
[1:42:58] he's always working to lift us up up
[1:43:01] even when we're doing our best sometimes
[1:43:03] to go down down amen his Mercy his grace
[1:43:06] is just there continually continually
[1:43:07] renewing us washing us bringing us back
[1:43:10] into his presence reaching out
[1:43:13] drawing Us close wooing us closer even
[1:43:15] when we don't deserve it day after day
[1:43:18] his grace is there
[1:43:19] Grace is not a one-time event when you
[1:43:21] come in and you finally give your life
[1:43:23] to God and you resp and you realize what
[1:43:25] he's done for you but it's a it's a
[1:43:26] daily thing it's a lifetime thing where
[1:43:28] his grace is always there to work in our
[1:43:30] lives amen the fact that we have a sound
[1:43:33] mind today that's his grace
[1:43:35] the fact that we have eyes to see and
[1:43:37] ears to hear that's Grace the fact that
[1:43:40] we have eyes to see that we're not
[1:43:42] perfect is Grace that we would desire to
[1:43:45] have more of him and less of us that's
[1:43:47] Grace in our lives today amen that we
[1:43:50] want to move further than where we're at
[1:43:52] that we're not satisfied with who we are
[1:43:54] that we're not satisfied with what we
[1:43:55] are in the word but that we're looking
[1:43:57] to those promises and saying I want more
[1:43:59] of that and less of everything else in
[1:44:01] the cosmos that's Grace this evening
[1:44:04] every day the fact that you can keep
[1:44:06] pushing towards the mark of the prize of
[1:44:08] the high calling in Christ Jesus is
[1:44:10] Grace because he put that inside of you
[1:44:12] to do it in the first place amen
[1:44:15] so if we've received it
[1:44:18] can we do what Matthew 10 says
[1:44:20] freely you have received
[1:44:22] freely give
[1:44:25] brother Brown would say this he says
[1:44:26] it's beyond any of our senses to
[1:44:28] comprehend what this means that we
[1:44:30] tonight are now seated in Christ
[1:44:33] every blessing that he died for is ours
[1:44:35] right now we have it
[1:44:38] oh God help us to have faith tonight to
[1:44:41] use your faith that you said it was ours
[1:44:44] and let us claim it tonight Lord every
[1:44:47] god-given privilege that we have for you
[1:44:49] have bought us and called us by Grace
[1:44:53] washed Us in the blood of thy son the
[1:44:55] Lord Jesus and has cleansed us up filled
[1:44:58] us with the Holy Spirit set us in Christ
[1:45:01] Jesus here tonight to claim anything any
[1:45:04] Redemptive blessing and our enemy
[1:45:07] tonight is just a bluff for Christ
[1:45:09] robbed him of everything he was at
[1:45:11] Calvary when he stripped him of
[1:45:13] everything every Power that he ever had
[1:45:15] for man was reconciled to God at that
[1:45:18] time through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:19] when he fully paid the price and the
[1:45:22] full Supreme offering was made and God
[1:45:24] was pleased with it and tonight we're
[1:45:27] resurrected in him how we thank thee for
[1:45:30] this knowing this that no matter what
[1:45:32] comes or goes we're in him no matter
[1:45:35] what comes or goes we're in him those
[1:45:39] who he has Justified he has already
[1:45:42] glorified and the father in his own
[1:45:45] faith believing that we'll hold to our
[1:45:48] Redemptive blessings and the
[1:45:50] righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:52] foresees us Yonder in eternity glorify
[1:45:56] together with him with glorified Bodies
[1:45:59] free from sickness free from death and
[1:46:02] to live with him as his dear beloved
[1:46:05] children through all ceaseless ages and
[1:46:08] Aeons of time to come
[1:46:10] that's Grace
[1:46:12] that's Grace to receive that
[1:46:14] the very Faith you have to claim it is
[1:46:16] Grace tonight
[1:46:18] the very Faith you had to claim your
[1:46:20] salvation was his grace in the first
[1:46:21] place
[1:46:23] brother Branham is speaking in this next
[1:46:24] quote
[1:46:26] of being fully persuaded talk about
[1:46:27] Abraham being fully persuaded of the
[1:46:29] promises of God he says it makes you act
[1:46:32] funny your decisions are odd to the
[1:46:34] world but it's a Believer no matter how
[1:46:37] strange it seems the Bible said that he
[1:46:39] was fully persuaded that God was able to
[1:46:41] perform what he said he would do that
[1:46:44] ought what to believe that God was able
[1:46:46] to perform it that ought to be the
[1:46:49] achievement of every believer this
[1:46:51] afternoon God is able to keep every word
[1:46:54] that he said he'd do I don't care what
[1:46:56] the denominations say words days of
[1:46:59] Miracles has passed all this is
[1:47:01] telepathy and all this fortune telling
[1:47:02] it doesn't matter to me what they say I
[1:47:05] still believe if that gun is zero to the
[1:47:08] Target it'll Hit the Target and I
[1:47:10] believe if a Believer is zeroed with the
[1:47:13] word of God it'll hit the same thing
[1:47:16] if the word of God ever promised it
[1:47:19] it'll do it again
[1:47:21] I'm fully persuaded of that that when we
[1:47:24] see we're in this age when it's supposed
[1:47:26] to be here it's supposed to be here
[1:47:30] these things he says are supposed to
[1:47:32] take place
[1:47:33] that's the reason I do believe that when
[1:47:35] the bride is called out and elected and
[1:47:38] said in the Book of Life there will come
[1:47:40] a sound from Heaven that'll take such a
[1:47:42] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:47:44] Pride that'll take her from the earth in
[1:47:46] a rapturing
[1:47:48] Grace
[1:47:50] God promised it I don't care how much
[1:47:53] science and how many astronauts they
[1:47:54] signed up and everything else how many
[1:47:56] million miles they can see I don't care
[1:47:58] nothing about that there is a Heaven
[1:48:01] There is a literal Jesus Christ there
[1:48:03] that will come in a body form to receive
[1:48:06] his church to himself no matter how old
[1:48:08] the story seems it's still the truth God
[1:48:11] said so that's what Believers believe
[1:48:15] I want to close with this one last quote
[1:48:19] brother Brown says you're going to the
[1:48:22] wedding in the sky
[1:48:25] can you say with me you're going to the
[1:48:28] wedding in the sky and you are wearing
[1:48:32] the wedding band a predestinated before
[1:48:36] you could ever choose
[1:48:37] unmerited you didn't earn it Grace a
[1:48:42] wedding band of Grace a merited of your
[1:48:44] own God did it himself he knew you
[1:48:48] before the foundation of the world so he
[1:48:50] slipped the wedding band on you there
[1:48:52] and put your name on a book
[1:48:56] amen God bless you let's stand this
[1:48:58] evening
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:01] we're not standing because I choose to
[1:49:03] stand
[1:49:04] you're not standing because you choose
[1:49:06] to stand
[1:49:07] you're standing because he chose you
[1:49:09] before you could ever choose he saw you
[1:49:11] before you could ever see he put life
[1:49:13] into you before you could ever breathe
[1:49:15] and he said I'm going to take a bride
[1:49:17] out of this
[1:49:18] out of all this I'm going to take a
[1:49:20] bride and brother Bram says he put the
[1:49:21] predestinated
[1:49:23] unmerited ring of Grace on your finger
[1:49:26] the unmerited wedding band of Grace you
[1:49:29] couldn't do it on your own
[1:49:31] so stop trying to do it on your own
[1:49:33] do what he wants you to do
[1:49:35] surrender to him
[1:49:37] relax
[1:49:41] don't relax with Satan
[1:49:43] relax with God
[1:49:45] let him do what he's going to do
[1:49:48] sometimes we get so worked up like I
[1:49:49] said we're so Performance Based
[1:49:52] today was a net positive
[1:49:54] today was a negative
[1:49:56] I did more good than bad
[1:49:58] and what happens is we push the grace of
[1:50:00] God completely out of our life sometimes
[1:50:02] it's our failures that allow us to draw
[1:50:04] closer to God than we would if we just
[1:50:06] kept motoring along and everything was
[1:50:07] good and hunky-dory and we never did a
[1:50:09] thing wrong it draws us back into his
[1:50:11] presence it lets us know that we need to
[1:50:13] stay close to him every day
[1:50:15] not because we're so weak and pathetic
[1:50:17] and whatnot but because in his presence
[1:50:19] that's where we're strong
[1:50:21] amen it's when we are in the presence of
[1:50:23] his word is when we're in the presence
[1:50:24] of his anointing when it's in the
[1:50:26] presence of his love when we see him
[1:50:27] feel his mercy and Grace that prepares
[1:50:30] us to go give the very same thing out to
[1:50:32] those that we start to run into on a day
[1:50:33] in day off basis amen our failures
[1:50:36] prepare us to treat others the same way
[1:50:37] that he treats us when we fail amen if
[1:50:41] we're going to have Grace we've got to
[1:50:42] receive Grace I remember brother talked
[1:50:44] to me one time and he said you know so
[1:50:46] and so you know did you see what he he
[1:50:48] spoke on at this church a while back and
[1:50:50] I said I looked at a little bit and he
[1:50:51] said
[1:50:52] he said he was just so hard
[1:50:55] he said there's no Grace there
[1:50:57] the reason why he didn't have Graces
[1:50:59] because he hadn't recognized Grace in
[1:51:00] his own life yet
[1:51:02] you're hard when you don't receive it
[1:51:04] you'll see people are gracious when
[1:51:06] they're receiving Grace when they're
[1:51:07] aware they're self-aware of their
[1:51:09] failures and their faults they're aware
[1:51:10] that God's having to work with them too
[1:51:12] and then that gives us an opportunity to
[1:51:14] start allowing other people to have God
[1:51:16] work with them too rather than requiring
[1:51:18] a standard of them that we ourselves
[1:51:19] can't ever achieve amen so often we're
[1:51:22] more judgmental because we're not where
[1:51:23] we ought to be
[1:51:25] and so we project that on to the next
[1:51:27] person
[1:51:28] rather than saying he's got Grace for me
[1:51:30] in my condition I'll have Grace for you
[1:51:31] in yours let's just bow our heads
[1:51:35] Heavenly Father
[1:51:37] Lord what Grace
[1:51:39] what Grace Lord that you would
[1:51:41] predestinate us Lord before we ever did
[1:51:43] a thing good or bad
[1:51:44] Lord and then after we did bad Lord yet
[1:51:47] you gave your life for us Heavenly
[1:51:49] Father Lord Your Grace is new your
[1:51:51] Mercy's new every day
[1:51:53] Lord and we know that if we can come to
[1:51:55] you with repentant hearts Lord if we can
[1:51:58] just come back in and continue to claim
[1:51:59] that blood Lord Your Grace Just flows
[1:52:01] over and US day in and day out heavenly
[1:52:04] father but Lord we don't want to receive
[1:52:06] it and never give it
[1:52:08] and Lord that's the challenge for our
[1:52:09] day I believe is to hold that merciful
[1:52:11] Grace gracious and loving attitude Lord
[1:52:14] that the bride is supposed to have
[1:52:15] Heavenly Father Lord would you grant us
[1:52:18] that Grace to be gracious today Heavenly
[1:52:20] Father Lord that when there is none
[1:52:21] deserving your yet we give it out Lord
[1:52:24] when somebody pushes us past our limit
[1:52:26] Lord may we look to your grace and
[1:52:28] decide to just raise it up a little bit
[1:52:30] more Lord and give it right back to them
[1:52:32] Heavenly Father Lord let us not hold
[1:52:34] each other to a performance contract
[1:52:36] Lord even ourselves Lord but may we fall
[1:52:39] back into the perfect Grace that you
[1:52:40] gave us and trust that you'll take us
[1:52:43] through to the end Heavenly Father Lord
[1:52:45] give us victory
[1:52:46] Lord give us victory in our lives Lord
[1:52:48] over the things that hold us back Lord
[1:52:51] and give us eyes of Grace as we look at
[1:52:52] our brothers and sisters around Lord
[1:52:54] that we'd encourage them on the way Lord
[1:52:56] rather than judging before us Lord would
[1:52:59] you just help us now we pray in Jesus
[1:53:01] Christ's name we ask it amen amen let's
[1:53:05] sing that song new Mercy that I talked
[1:53:06] about it's it's 1062 but I know Matt put
[1:53:09] in a different number as well so either
[1:53:10] one will work
[1:53:11] all right 12 48. I know some of us know
[1:53:14] this I checked with the group but uh
[1:53:16] it's a song I've known for quite some
[1:53:18] time and I asked the musicians to learn
[1:53:21] it and they had so we'll start with the
[1:53:22] course if we can brother
[1:53:24] foreign
[1:53:26] Lord you make your mercy new every day
[1:53:32] you change my life in so many
[1:53:36] ways
[1:53:38] you cradle me in your sweet Grace
[1:53:43] you fill me
[1:53:48] yesterday today forever Lord
[1:53:55] there's one thing I know for sure
[1:54:00] oh fresh as a morning dear
[1:54:05] you make your mercy new
[1:54:12] every morning sing the course again
[1:54:17] Lord you make your mercy new every day
[1:54:23] you changed my life in so many ways
[1:54:29] you cradle me in your sweet Grace
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:45] there's one thing I know for sure
[1:54:51] fresh as a morning dinner you make a
