[31:16] heavenly father
[31:19] lord surely we are nothing if you're not

[31:23] and lord we're thankful that we can lift
[31:24] our hands lord that we can lift our
[31:27] voices lord that we can worship you here
[31:29] tonight yes
[31:30] but lord we're coming with needs as well
[31:32] or we're coming with lives that need to
[31:34] be changed or we're coming with issues
[31:36] lord we're coming with lord a desire to
[31:38] be drawn closer to you heavenly father
[31:40] and that's a work that only you can do
[31:42] in our lives
[31:43] the lord your prophet told us that if we
[31:45] could have a desire for it lord it meant
[31:47] that there is a way to meet the need or
[31:49] that there is a great jehovah lord the
[31:52] the jehovah gyra that sees the need and
[31:54] meets it lord that even puts the desire
[31:56] in us to call for it in the first place
[31:58] and lord we pray that you take this
[32:00] simple message tonight lord lord as i've
[32:02] studied and prepared lord all we ask is
[32:05] that you would anoint the lord take away
[32:06] what doesn't need to be there add in
[32:08] what needs lord to meet the need of your
[32:10] bride and feeder tonight we pray lord
[32:13] touch each one we ask lord the many
[32:15] needs that have been brought forth lord
[32:17] we ask your grace to them and thank you
[32:18] for answering prayer lord for the many
[32:20] things that you've done in this last few
[32:22] days lord we pray you'll be with us now
[32:24] in jesus christ's name right amen
[32:27] amen thank you musicians that'll be it
[32:29] if you can turn your scriptures this
[32:30] morning to ephesians chapter four
[32:33] ephesians chapter four just uh by way of
[32:35] uh praise reports we prayed if you
[32:38] remember for brother tim pruitt's church
[32:39] in the hurricane ida that was hitting it
[32:42] ended up being i think the second or
[32:43] third worst
[32:45] uh hurricane to hit and it missed them
[32:47] completely he said they were going to
[32:49] get a bit of rain and 13 mile an hour
[32:51] winds
[32:52] the following day so we had worse
[32:53] weather than they did so
[32:55] we say praise the lord for that and uh
[32:57] brother brother jean has a church there
[33:00] as well and he said they have minimal
[33:01] damage and most of the folks in the
[33:03] church were okay a few lost power but
[33:05] other than that uh they were all good so
[33:07] we absolutely thank the lord for that
[33:08] that's an answer to prayer because
[33:10] they're saying a place that got hit
[33:11] directly there four to five weeks before
[33:14] they'll have power restored so amen we
[33:17] praise the lord for that i mean that's a
[33:18] real answer to prayer i also want to
[33:20] thank brother paul and sister kim he
[33:21] stepped out here but thank them for all
[33:23] the hard work and taking the children
[33:25] away for a few days everyone came back
[33:27] with all their fingers toes limbs
[33:29] had a good time by all accounts so
[33:31] certainly want to thank them for taking
[33:33] the time and effort to do that that's a
[33:34] big job it's a thankless job many times
[33:37] but we want to make sure we give them
[33:38] our thanks and appreciation for the hard
[33:40] work that they put in a minute it's
[33:41] wonderful to have people with a burden
[33:43] you don't have to tell them anything you
[33:45] just have to let them go amen and that's
[33:46] what they did they just took off and
[33:48] went and took the kids with them so amen
[33:50] and some good things certainly came out
[33:51] from it spiritually even in our own home
[33:54] so we're thankful for that as well this
[33:55] wasn't just a trip for fun it was for
[33:57] spiritual edification it was to help the
[33:59] children grow in the lord and that's
[34:00] absolutely what we can testify happened
[34:02] in our family amen so we praise the lord
[34:04] for that ephesians 4
[34:07] a very familiar verse by this point
[34:09] ephesians 4 15 says but speaking the
[34:11] truth and love may grow up into him in
[34:14] all things which is the head even christ
[34:16] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[34:18] together and compacted by that which
[34:21] every joint supplyeth according to the
[34:23] effectual working in the measure of
[34:25] every part maketh increase of the body
[34:28] unto the edifying of itself and love
[34:30] amen may the lord have his blessing to
[34:32] the word you may be seated this morning
[34:35] as you can imagine we're going to
[34:36] continue on our series on the overcomers
[34:38] and we're going to speak on a title of
[34:40] gifts that keep on giving amen and this
[34:42] will be a multi-part series i think a
[34:44] partial series here certainly and if you
[34:47] think we've been stuck on this verse for
[34:48] a while we have this will be the third
[34:50] or fourth service i think that we've
[34:51] preached on this amen but there's a lot
[34:53] here to talk about amen this is not just
[34:56] a simple verse but there's so many
[34:57] things that tie into this idea of the
[34:59] body of christ and that's really the
[35:00] theme that we're going to be spending a
[35:02] little bit of time on in in the series
[35:04] on the overcomers is really that body of
[35:05] christ and we preached on how do you get
[35:07] into it and what does that look like and
[35:09] even the last service and many many
[35:11] services before we covered how do you
[35:12] get into it it's by one body by one
[35:14] spirit you're baptized into that body
[35:16] amen you can't be a part of the body of
[35:18] christ without the holy spirit you can
[35:20] be around it you can be
[35:21] in the anointing of the holy spirit in
[35:23] the services and around anointed people
[35:24] that but that's not what makes you a
[35:26] part of the body of christ amen you've
[35:28] got to have the anointing in you you've
[35:29] got a holy have the holy spirit god's
[35:31] own life god's own love inside of you
[35:33] and that's the thing that connects you
[35:35] to christ and that's the thing that
[35:36] allows him to now build you and set you
[35:38] into the body into your place amen and
[35:41] this is not a temporary thing we don't
[35:42] get to join the body and then leave on
[35:44] vacation for a little bit and then come
[35:45] back and join and back and forth this is
[35:47] a 24 hours a day seven days a week 365
[35:50] days a year until the day that god takes
[35:52] us home by death or by rapture amen we
[35:54] don't get to take a break from being a
[35:55] believer we don't get to take a break
[35:57] from being a part of a body of believers
[35:59] amen but we're there to do a
[36:01] a purpose and he's got a plan for us and
[36:03] that's the thing that we're supposed to
[36:04] be focused on our entire time here even
[36:06] when we're on vacation and then even
[36:08] when we go out as brother joel said when
[36:09] we go out you know try and find people
[36:11] that you can encourage you know make
[36:12] sure that you're staying connected to
[36:14] the body try and take in a service if
[36:15] you're away in these different things
[36:17] and then we want to be surrendered and
[36:18] connected not only to him in terms of
[36:21] the spiritual side but also to each
[36:22] other and then we've got a duty a post
[36:24] of duty here as well amen and there's a
[36:27] process we know getting the holy ghost
[36:28] is a process it's repent and then be
[36:30] baptized and then after that you'll
[36:32] receive the holy ghost and it may be one
[36:34] minute from the minute you repent to the
[36:36] time that you're baptized and get the
[36:37] holy ghost and it could be 10 years for
[36:39] some people amen not everybody gets it
[36:41] immediately and you'll look in the
[36:42] scriptures you'll see that there were
[36:43] some that didn't even know there was a
[36:44] holy ghost they'd been baptized but they
[36:46] didn't even know there was a holy ghost
[36:48] to be had you know and i think it comes
[36:50] down to when we look in the scripture it
[36:52] says repent a lot of times we don't
[36:54] repent and then we we desire christ and
[36:56] we give our lives to christ but we don't
[36:57] repent and then when we get a true
[36:59] repentance now that gives us something
[37:01] to respond to if you're not baptized in
[37:02] the right name how can he come in you
[37:04] haven't done it the right way you've got
[37:05] to follow the word to get in there amen
[37:07] but then once you get the holy ghost
[37:09] then we start another process and that's
[37:11] the process of maturing and we covered
[37:13] that in depth with the last series i did
[37:14] amen
[37:16] but one thing we know is that when you
[37:18] get the holy ghost it will never
[37:19] disagree with the word of god amen when
[37:21] you are led by the holy spirit it will
[37:23] always align itself with the word of god
[37:25] if you say the holy spirit has called me
[37:27] to be a minister and you happen to be a
[37:29] sister then it wasn't the holy spirit
[37:31] that said that isn't that true amen if
[37:32] we look in ii timothy 2 it says let the
[37:34] women learn in silence with all
[37:36] subjection and i suffer not a woman to
[37:38] teach nor to usurp authority over the
[37:40] man but to be in silence amen and the
[37:42] feminists jump all over this and say
[37:44] well men can speak as well as women or
[37:46] women can speak as well as men and
[37:47] they're absolutely right this isn't
[37:49] about competence i mean this is about a
[37:51] divine order that god put in place
[37:53] because of the original sin and because
[37:55] of the fall in the garden of eden it was
[37:56] a reflection of what the orig the first
[37:58] woman did not a reflection of all women
[38:00] but yet there is a divine order for how
[38:02] this is going to happen so a sister that
[38:03] gets up and says well i'm going to teach
[38:05] i'm going to preach then she's going
[38:07] against the word amen so you can say all
[38:09] day long that i had a dream i had a
[38:10] vision i was anointed to do this and do
[38:13] that but if you're going against the we
[38:14] go to the word as an absolute to check
[38:16] our leadership amen we want to always be
[38:19] found doing that
[38:20] we talked in the last service how we
[38:22] have to get to christ first to get into
[38:23] that body we don't come in with a gift
[38:25] we don't come in with a talent we don't
[38:27] come in with something to offer but
[38:28] rather we come in and we surrender amen
[38:30] and in that surrender now he decides
[38:32] what he wants to use and what he wants
[38:33] to discard amen and sometimes we have to
[38:36] give up something of great value in
[38:37] order for us to use for him to use us in
[38:39] something of eternal value amen the
[38:41] world will look at something and say
[38:42] well you're a great leader you're a
[38:43] great speaker you make money well you
[38:45] know
[38:46] and they'll say and you come and say god
[38:48] i'm going to give you that. he says no
[38:49] no just come to me come to me and then
[38:51] i'll tell you what i want you to bring
[38:52] and what you want to give up amen it's
[38:54] for him to decide not for us and rather
[38:57] we come and surrender yielding ourselves
[38:59] to him and then he places us where he
[39:00] wants to be amen
[39:03] glory
[39:05] amen i read this quote last service
[39:07] and i believe it's worth repeating
[39:09] what brother brown said
[39:11] not working here brother rachel
[39:16] he says when you surrender fully he'll
[39:18] come in fully but until you surrender he
[39:21] can't come in fully surrender surrender
[39:24] your thoughts surrender your thinking
[39:25] surrender your life surrender your all
[39:28] right surrender your prestige surrender
[39:30] everything to him now and he'll come in
[39:32] and fill you with the holy ghost that's
[39:34] here that's what he's here to do amen
[39:37] now you look at that and you say well
[39:38] what if i surrender just a little well
[39:41] he'll come in just a little he'll come
[39:42] in as much as you'll allow him to amen
[39:44] but the problem with that is that when
[39:46] you have a gift and you allow him in
[39:47] just a little often what that means is
[39:49] the gift is anointed but your life isn't
[39:51] in line with the word and that can lead
[39:53] you into a very dangerous situation amen
[39:56] where you think that you're something
[39:57] that you're not because you have an
[39:58] anointed gift and the rest of your life
[40:00] is in shambles remember brother uh
[40:02] brother branham he saw those two
[40:03] brothers and one stood up and spoke in
[40:05] tongues and the other one interpreted
[40:06] they were both anointed they both had
[40:08] the holy spirit activating their gifts
[40:10] but what happened when he looked was by
[40:12] vision he saw that one of them was a
[40:13] true blue believer and the other one was
[40:15] cheating on his wife and he said how can
[40:16] this be and it's the fact that the holy
[40:18] spirit can anoint a gift without you
[40:19] having on the inside amen the gift
[40:21] doesn't prove anything
[40:23] amen but we also know for a part of the
[40:25] body of christ that each one of us has a
[40:27] gift and that means each one of us has a
[40:29] purpose we have a benefit that we bring
[40:31] to the local body and then just as our
[40:33] natural bodies have no extra parts so
[40:34] the body of christ doesn't have any
[40:36] extra parts no matter how small or
[40:38] little you might be god has a purpose
[40:39] and a plan for you being where you are
[40:41] and if we can surrender to him then we
[40:43] can be used in that manner amen the
[40:45] challenge for us is to do what is to sit
[40:47] still be quiet and wait on him amen the
[40:50] hardest thing for a human to do i think
[40:52] is to sit still to just wait and believe
[40:55] and trust that god is moving when
[40:56] nothing seems to be changing amen
[40:59] i can say that specifically in my life
[41:01] certainly in the recent past where it
[41:03] seemed like nothing was happening and
[41:04] nothing was happening but there was
[41:06] stuff happening internally and god was
[41:08] moving and making changes in certain
[41:09] things and all of a sudden god moves and
[41:11] now i'm here right and all of a sudden
[41:13] i've got purpose and i've got things to
[41:15] do and he's using me but for a long time
[41:16] there he wasn't using me and it's real
[41:18] easy to think well something's wrong no
[41:20] you've got to sit you've got to be quiet
[41:22] you got to learn you got to be trained
[41:23] you got to be humble you got to be
[41:24] broken down you got to let god open the
[41:26] door so that when you move you can move
[41:28] with confidence amen
[41:30] amen i mean
[41:32] paul says this in first corinthians 7 7
[41:34] he says for i would that all men were
[41:36] even as i myself but every man every
[41:39] person this does this includes the
[41:41] sisters every man had his proper gift of
[41:44] god one after this manner and another
[41:47] after that
[41:48] so we're not all the same we're not all
[41:50] built the same we don't all have the
[41:51] same gift and even with the same gift it
[41:52] can operate differently depending on who
[41:54] you are right god works with you
[41:56] according to the way you are and it may
[41:58] be different for one that's singing this
[41:59] way versus one that sings that way look
[42:01] at the preaching gifts we have
[42:03] look at the variety of preachers we have
[42:04] my goodness and each one of them has a
[42:07] has a way of delivering in a way that
[42:08] the people can receive it and there's
[42:10] grace for them for the hearers that are
[42:11] there amen but so many different ones
[42:14] you know i remember looking back and if
[42:16] you were to ask me john did you ever
[42:17] think you would be a preacher i'd say no
[42:19] there was never really an inkling of it
[42:21] and the few little things that were
[42:22] there i didn't recognize as being
[42:24] something that was calling me to preach
[42:25] and it's only now looking back in
[42:27] hindsight that i can see ah there was
[42:29] something there i just didn't know what
[42:30] it was i remember talking to david butts
[42:33] one time my brother-in-law i said do you
[42:35] ever feel like you have something you're
[42:36] supposed to share with the church
[42:38] and i mean david's a a fine christian
[42:40] he's a deacon he's an upstanding husband
[42:42] a father
[42:43] he's a fantastic christian and he looked
[42:46] at me like i had 10 heads and said no
[42:49] right
[42:50] because why it's not that he never had
[42:51] something worth sharing but he never
[42:53] felt an unction to share it
[42:55] right to stand up in front of people to
[42:56] feel that he was supposed to bring that
[42:58] to the people but i did even back then
[43:00] occasionally and it was weird and i just
[43:02] thought well whatever that's weird
[43:03] obviously if he doesn't do it then why
[43:05] would you know it shouldn't mean
[43:06] anything to me amen but that was a
[43:08] foreshadow what of something that god
[43:10] was going to do later in my life there
[43:11] was a burden there that i couldn't
[43:13] respond to because the call hadn't been
[43:15] activated yet but i could see in in
[43:17] hindsight that burden was there to share
[43:19] that and it was god preparing me for
[43:21] ministry and then preparing me putting
[43:23] something putting a burden putting an
[43:24] unction on my heart now that doesn't
[43:26] mean a burden defines your calling amen
[43:28] there's lots of people get burdens for
[43:29] things and for different reasons but it
[43:31] can certainly show you what's coming
[43:32] your way and if you'll surrender god may
[43:34] turn that into a calling within your
[43:36] life amen
[43:37] amen but that burden is so great because
[43:39] when you have a burden you don't need
[43:41] anyone to tell you what to do like i
[43:42] said even talk about paul and kim and
[43:44] then they didn't need somebody to tell
[43:45] them to go out and take the young people
[43:46] out they did it on their own and we just
[43:48] get behind them and we support them and
[43:50] all of a sudden good things happen amen
[43:51] that's what we're looking for is those
[43:53] burdens those unctions of the holy
[43:54] spirit that are for the benefit of
[43:55] others and that's when you can trust
[43:57] that the holy spirit's working amen and
[43:59] they'll do it people with a burden they
[44:00] don't sit there and trumpet it that's
[44:02] what i found people with a real godly
[44:04] burden they don't sit there and tell
[44:05] everyone what they're gonna do and how
[44:06] they're going to do it or after they've
[44:08] done it they don't come back and tell us
[44:09] all what they did they just do it and
[44:11] oftentimes you don't find out till days
[44:13] or months or weeks later sometimes even
[44:15] years later and you'll find out wow
[44:16] you've been doing that for two years and
[44:18] we're seeing the fruit of it now and we
[44:19] have no clue how it got there because
[44:21] you were so quietly working brother jim
[44:23] dooley did that for two years he was
[44:24] working down in washington just going
[44:26] around talking to believers that had
[44:28] left church and disillusioned or
[44:30] disappointed or kicked out as a case
[44:31] where and and he go around he just
[44:33] fellowship with all him and eventually
[44:34] he got enough together to where we could
[44:36] have house meetings so i go down and and
[44:38] some of the other brothers and we preach
[44:39] to them
[44:40] and he's done the work for two years
[44:41] just to get us in the door right he
[44:43] didn't tell anybody about it except the
[44:45] pastor
[44:46] right but he didn't go around telling
[44:47] everybody hey you don't pray no no he
[44:49] just went out and did it and the lord
[44:50] blessed it and then and he's brought
[44:52] fruit out of it amen
[44:54] amen so we want to talk about gifts
[44:55] today we want to talk about what it is
[44:57] what its purpose is and what it's look
[44:59] what it looks like in action so the
[45:00] first thing that we ask ourselves is
[45:02] what is a gift
[45:03] most of us we look at a gift and we'd
[45:04] say well it's a talent or an ability
[45:07] that's what we think certainly from a
[45:08] worldly standpoint when you say
[45:09] somebody's gifted it means they're
[45:10] really good at doing something sidney
[45:12] crosby is gifted in hockey you know you
[45:14] can look at your athletes and these
[45:15] different ones great singers and you say
[45:16] well they have a gift to singer they
[45:18] have a gift for entertainment or comedy
[45:20] or sports or these different things but
[45:22] if we take it back to the scripture
[45:23] we'll see what a spiritual gift is
[45:25] because we're only interested in the
[45:26] spiritual gifts amen we're talking about
[45:28] a spiritual body we're talking about a
[45:29] spiritual heritage so spiritual gifts
[45:32] are the ones that we're going to be most
[45:33] interested in
[45:34] so first corinthians 12 if your turn
[45:36] here because we're going to stay here
[45:37] for a while today
[45:40] i have it up on the
[45:41] screen if you want but it'll help
[45:42] because i'm going to be going back and
[45:43] forth in different places so paul says
[45:46] in first corinthians 12 1 now concerning
[45:48] spiritual gifts brethren i would not
[45:50] have you ignorant amen he says spiritual
[45:52] gifts not gifts but spiritual gifts amen
[45:55] just because you have a gift it doesn't
[45:56] make it spiritual and he's going to show
[45:58] you the criteria for it to be a
[45:59] spiritual gift in the in the following
[46:01] verses he says you know that you were
[46:03] gentiles carried away unto these dumb
[46:04] idols even as ye were led in other words
[46:07] your past is nothing to brag about right
[46:09] nothing special looking back in the past
[46:11] you're not some amazing person but
[46:13] rather you were leading down the path of
[46:15] death right serving what idols you
[46:17] weren't serving the true god you had no
[46:18] idea of god you had no no concept of
[46:21] what it meant to serve god until he
[46:22] brought you out of that he says
[46:25] wherefore i give you to understand that
[46:26] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[46:28] call it jesus accursed and that no man
[46:30] can say that jesus is the lord but by
[46:32] the holy ghost we covered this before
[46:34] the proof of the holy ghost is that you
[46:35] can what say that jesus is
[46:38] right that he is he is the present day
[46:40] man he's not just in the past he's not
[46:42] just in the future but he is the present
[46:44] christ amen
[46:45] amen so the word you're listening to is
[46:47] is what's going to determine whether you
[46:49] recognize christ because he is the word
[46:51] before he ever was jesus christ he was
[46:53] christ the word amen before the
[46:55] foundation of the world before time even
[46:56] began that's where the word was and so
[46:58] we're looking not for christ as we saw
[47:00] him 2000 years ago but we're looking for
[47:02] the word amen for our age and for our
[47:04] day and when you recognize that then you
[47:06] know you're on the right track amen it's
[47:08] not some man it's not some headquarters
[47:10] or some overseer that we're looking to
[47:11] but we're looking to the word which is
[47:13] christ for our day
[47:15] then paul gets into these spiritual
[47:16] gifts he says now there are diversities
[47:18] of gifts there's different gifts but the
[47:20] same spirit so the criteria for a
[47:23] spiritual gift is that there's a spirit
[47:26] operating it yes amen so when you have a
[47:29] gift it is something that can be
[47:30] anointed by the holy spirit and used by
[47:33] god
[47:34] so that opens us up to a whole lot of
[47:35] things besides just the nine things that
[47:37] are listed in the rest of this of this
[47:39] chapter doesn't it because anything that
[47:41] you have that can be anointed by the
[47:43] holy spirit and used by god is a
[47:44] spiritual gift
[47:46] amen so that can literally be the two
[47:48] hands that you have to do just about
[47:50] anything for the service of god it can
[47:51] be your mouth speaking what he would
[47:53] have you to speak amen going this place
[47:55] fellowshipping with that one it can be
[47:56] taking a meal to someone it is anything
[47:58] that god can anoint you to use for his
[48:01] purpose is a spiritual gift that paul
[48:03] says amen
[48:05] amen but it's only spiritual if it's the
[48:07] holy spirit that's anointing it and
[48:08] guess what you can have a spiritual gift
[48:10] that you use every day and it's not
[48:12] spiritual and then the holy spirit
[48:14] anoints it and it becomes spiritual for
[48:15] that moment and then it goes back to
[48:17] something else you can have brother bam
[48:19] talks about men that have a gift to make
[48:20] money
[48:21] guess what it can be anointed for the
[48:23] for the use of the kingdom of god and
[48:24] then he can go right back to making
[48:26] money and it has nothing to do with god
[48:27] but then god will put something on his
[48:28] heart and he'll go out and he'll make
[48:29] money and he'll give it to the church
[48:30] and say that one was from god and then
[48:32] he'll go back and keep making money and
[48:34] back and forth back and forth amen it's
[48:35] not that it can't be used for your
[48:37] benefit but when it's a spiritual gift
[48:39] when it's being used spiritually it is
[48:40] for the benefit of the body of christ
[48:42] and it's used for the benefit of others
[48:43] amen
[48:44] brother braham says this he's speaking
[48:46] of himself he says what is it it's a
[48:48] gift that i have that god gave me not
[48:50] that somebody laid hands on me that
[48:52] doesn't work gifts and callings are
[48:54] without repentance you're born with them
[48:56] in all your life this is what we call a
[48:58] creation gift the bible said so see
[49:00] moses was born a prophet john the
[49:02] baptist 712 years before he was born was
[49:05] a voice of one crying in the wilderness
[49:07] god told jeremiah before you was even
[49:09] conceived in your mother's womb i knew
[49:11] you i sanctified you and ordained you a
[49:13] prophet to the nations so the fivefold
[49:15] ministry is a gift that's ordained
[49:16] before the foundation of the world and
[49:18] then you don't choose it it's in you
[49:19] beforehand god god foreordained it he
[49:21] predestinated it and you can't do
[49:23] anything to take it away and you
[49:24] definitely can't add it into your life
[49:26] he says see it's god's election and
[49:28] calling not that you're any better than
[49:31] anybody else he says we're all the same
[49:33] we're just children but god has chose
[49:36] some to be one thing and some another he
[49:38] says and if you pick where god chose you
[49:42] then you can yield yourself and that
[49:44] spirit will work through your
[49:46] through you
[49:48] so what he's meaning there is that if
[49:50] you pick by your free will
[49:52] now your free will is to surrender
[49:55] that's what this looks like it is not
[49:56] like i choose to be a preacher it's lord
[49:58] i surrender to your will he quickens to
[50:00] your heart what you're supposed to be
[50:02] and then you say i will be it that's
[50:04] what brother brahm saying here if you
[50:05] choose by your free will to be what god
[50:08] wants you to be
[50:09] then you can yield yourself because
[50:11] god's already prepared you he's given
[50:13] you a gift he's given you a nature he's
[50:15] given you a makeup to yield in a way
[50:17] that will allow that gift to operate and
[50:19] brother branham remember when he talks
[50:20] about his gift he says i i work i i live
[50:24] a lot closer to the supernatural
[50:25] dimension he says i can slip in and out
[50:27] of it very easily and that was the gift
[50:29] that was required for him to operate
[50:31] under the anointing that he was under
[50:33] and he says my gift was what
[50:35] to yield myself right to surrender
[50:38] myself so he had a great ability to
[50:40] yield and to slip into the supernatural
[50:42] to slip into the spiritual and god made
[50:45] him that way and once he accepted that
[50:46] you saw his ministry start to take off
[50:49] as long as he was questioning it as long
[50:50] as he was fighting it he didn't get very
[50:52] far with it it was still wonderful but
[50:54] as soon as he recognized his place in
[50:56] the word as soon as he recognized the
[50:57] call then all of a sudden he starts to
[50:59] surrender to it and all of a sudden god
[51:01] can do things in him that he couldn't do
[51:02] earlier on in his ministry why he
[51:04] chooses now to embrace what god has
[51:06] called him to do and now he can yield
[51:08] the way god wants him to and the holy
[51:10] spirit can flow through him in a
[51:11] supernatural way that it couldn't before
[51:13] amen
[51:15] so a gift is something that the holy
[51:17] spirit can operate
[51:19] what it is not is a vindication that you
[51:21] are a child of god
[51:22] because so often what we find is people
[51:24] are saying i want a gift i want a
[51:26] ministry i want a place in the body so i
[51:29] can prove to myself that i am a son or a
[51:31] daughter of god amen what happens
[51:33] usually is that they don't think they
[51:35] have the holy ghost and so they say well
[51:37] if i can have a gift then that'll make
[51:39] me feel like i'm important it'll make me
[51:40] feel like i'm a part and that'll confirm
[51:42] to me that the holy spirit is in my life
[51:45] but that has nothing to do with it we
[51:46] covered that before whether you look at
[51:48] judas whether you look at balaam whether
[51:49] you look at the different ones that paul
[51:51] talks about he says they left having
[51:52] loved this present world and this and
[51:54] that and the other thing what was it
[51:56] they had gifts they had ministries but
[51:58] yet they didn't truly have the holy
[52:00] spirit inside of them and so what we do
[52:02] is often
[52:03] it's really an inferiority complex
[52:05] right is it satan that has put doubt in
[52:07] our mind as to our position in christ
[52:09] and so we say well if i have a gift it's
[52:11] going to make me feel like i'm a i'm an
[52:12] important part and that's the last thing
[52:14] you need to seek gifts for him and a
[52:16] gift is for the benefit of others not
[52:17] for the benefit of yourself amen so when
[52:19] you start doing that now you're going to
[52:21] get yourself in a real tangle real quick
[52:23] because guess what satan will anoint you
[52:24] in lots of ways and then he'll mimic all
[52:27] of those gifts and we'll touch on that a
[52:28] little bit what brother branham says
[52:29] about it but he'll mimic those things
[52:31] and pretty soon you think you're pretty
[52:32] spiritual and you'll end up falling off
[52:34] of a cliff and failing badly amen
[52:36] amen if you aren't carl to be a preacher
[52:38] i don't care how much you surrender to
[52:39] the holy spirit you will never be an
[52:41] ordained minister by ordained i mean by
[52:44] god amen you can't do it you can't do it
[52:46] if you think that you're going to be the
[52:47] world's best singer and you say i'm
[52:49] anointed to be a singer and god hasn't
[52:50] called you to be a singer it doesn't
[52:51] matter if you can sing like the the
[52:53] greatest singer in the history of the
[52:54] world god won't anoint it amen you've
[52:56] got to find your place and if you don't
[52:58] do that you can't be blessed
[53:00] i mean you can't be a blessing is more
[53:02] to the point right we want to find a
[53:03] place where we can be a blessing to
[53:05] others amen
[53:08] now that word gift that that is used
[53:09] here is is charisma and brother mark
[53:11] shared some things from brother jason
[53:13] watkins with you know i'm going to
[53:14] borrow from them for the next little bit
[53:15] here but that word gift is charisma in
[53:18] the greek so he gave charisma
[53:20] to different people
[53:22] now in in the english language charisma
[53:24] means compelling attractiveness or charm
[53:27] that can inspire devotions in others
[53:28] devotion and others not devotions that's
[53:30] for sure
[53:32] and then so you see actors and actresses
[53:34] that have great charisma comedians you
[53:36] see politicians and what is it it's
[53:37] people that draw others to them very
[53:39] easily they have a great personality
[53:41] they usually have a good smile they're
[53:42] great speakers they're very personable
[53:44] they remember things about you they
[53:46] flatter you easily right and what do
[53:47] they do they draw people to themselves
[53:50] and that's what charisma does when we
[53:51] speak of it from an english standpoint
[53:53] but most of those people today are
[53:54] demonic and the re the way you know that
[53:57] is you look at where they lead people
[53:58] and it is rarely to christ and it's
[53:59] usually to themselves and to do what
[54:01] they want them to do which makes it what
[54:03] demonic amen because we always lead to
[54:05] christ if you're under uh the holy
[54:07] spirit anointing then you're going to
[54:08] lead them to christ and you're going to
[54:09] point to christ every single time but
[54:12] charisma in the greek has a completely
[54:14] different meaning it is a free gift
[54:17] a favor which one receives without any
[54:20] merit of his own
[54:22] that's grace
[54:23] that's that's the definition of grace so
[54:24] charisma is literally a gracious gift it
[54:27] is a gift given without any merit on the
[54:29] part of the person that has it the gift
[54:31] of divine grace the gift of faith
[54:34] knowledge holiness and virtue grace or
[54:37] gifts denoting extraordinary powers
[54:40] distinguishing certain christians and
[54:42] enabling them to serve the church of
[54:44] christ
[54:45] not serve themselves but serve the
[54:47] church of christ the reception of which
[54:49] so the gifts are given due to the power
[54:52] of divine grace operating on their souls
[54:55] by the holy spirit so there's nothing of
[54:57] their their worth here there's nothing
[54:59] that they've done to deserve this and
[55:01] there's nothing that they can do to
[55:02] operate it in a spiritual way but it is
[55:04] all grace that it is given given to them
[55:06] it is grace that they can be used and it
[55:08] is grace that it can be received from
[55:10] start to finish amen amen so the gifts
[55:12] are grace to us and it's only the holy
[55:14] spirit working them that makes them
[55:15] worthwhile to us in terms of spiritual
[55:17] worth amen
[55:19] but catch that definition it says
[55:20] extraordinary powers given freely to us
[55:23] not based on our worthiness but rather
[55:25] ordained by god to serve the church of
[55:28] christ
[55:29] so when you see somebody take a gift and
[55:31] they leverage it to fame fortune
[55:34] popularity and these different things
[55:36] then you don't even need discernment to
[55:37] say that's not christ because when you
[55:39] see the greatest elements of these gifts
[55:42] in scripture how many of those turned
[55:43] out to be popular moses the greatest
[55:46] prophet aside from john the baptist
[55:48] right wasn't particularly popular was he
[55:51] they killed jesus they killed paul they
[55:53] killed all of the apostles that had the
[55:55] greatest power and authority in the
[55:56] early church right none of these men
[55:58] came to great popularity none of them
[56:00] came to a great end most of them died
[56:03] right so if you see somebody and they're
[56:05] coming into all of those things then i
[56:07] can guarantee you it's not the holy
[56:08] spirit that's leading them because the
[56:09] world will never accept it because the
[56:11] world never has accepted it so all
[56:13] that's left is is the true church and
[56:14] guess what the true church is not that
[56:16] big it's never been big it'll never be
[56:18] big and so the acceptance is going to be
[56:20] a very small group of people and the
[56:21] rest are going to deny it because it's
[56:23] too strict it doesn't line up with their
[56:24] way of thinking it doesn't give them an
[56:26] excuse and it doesn't allow them out
[56:27] from under the thumb of the word of god
[56:28] amen amen it will never be accepted in a
[56:30] way that makes people popular amen
[56:33] that's why this prosperity gospel and
[56:34] these different things word of faith and
[56:36] all that all it is is what a gross
[56:37] distortion of the scripture and men
[56:39] trying to draw people to themselves and
[56:40] they turn themselves into multi multi
[56:42] multi-millionaires what's the what's the
[56:44] the big one uh ken
[56:46] kenneth copeland uh 250 300 million
[56:49] dollar net worth now i think
[56:51] third of a billion dollars preaching the
[56:53] gospel amen right
[56:55] and jesus had one cloak
[56:57] right it's a problem there amen
[57:02] because why in our opening scripture we
[57:03] read this it said ephesians 4 16 it says
[57:06] the effectual working in the measure of
[57:08] every part
[57:10] maketh increase of the body unto the
[57:12] edifying of itself and love it's
[57:14] edifying everyone else around you it's
[57:16] not focused on producing something for
[57:18] yourself amen so if all of us benefit
[57:20] it's god and if only i benefit and i'm
[57:22] the one with the gift it's antichrist
[57:25] that's simple you don't need discernment
[57:26] you don't need discernment for that you
[57:28] just say who's benefiting from their
[57:29] gift is it them or is it everybody else
[57:31] and if it's everybody else you're good
[57:32] to go and if it's just them then you say
[57:34] there's a problem here doesn't mean it
[57:35] couldn't be a real gift but it means
[57:37] that right now it's operating under
[57:38] something else amen
[57:40] brother adam couldn't use his gift to
[57:41] heal himself
[57:43] how long did he go on with with stomach
[57:45] problems right and and he could he could
[57:47] heal anybody else if the lord showed him
[57:49] to do it but he could never take his
[57:50] hand and lay it on himself and say get
[57:52] out yeah why jesus never healed himself
[57:56] jesus laid down in the boat he had
[57:58] headaches he was he was in agony he was
[58:00] tired and all these things and he could
[58:02] not take that power and use it on
[58:03] himself because why a true gift is given
[58:05] for the benefit of others and even you
[58:07] look at jesus he would become exhausted
[58:09] we saw it in brother bannon's ministry
[58:11] the same thing he would become exhausted
[58:12] by the use of the gift and then that
[58:14] gift was not able to restore him
[58:16] and then he would they said jesus you're
[58:18] not a man over 50 years old and he was
[58:21] only 33 when he died
[58:23] right he aged so heavily because of the
[58:25] use of that gift because of the pressure
[58:27] the burden that was on him and the
[58:29] strength that people drew out of him
[58:30] amen so what a gift is for others and it
[58:33] is a gift for service not for
[58:34] selfishness
[58:36] first corinthians 14 12 says even so ye
[58:40] for as much as you are zealous of
[58:41] spiritual gifts we want gifts in the
[58:42] body amen do we want christ moving in
[58:44] our midst do we want the holy spirit
[58:46] moving
[58:47] paul says seek that ye may excel
[58:50] seek that you may do really really well
[58:52] that you would be above and beyond
[58:54] what's normal
[58:55] but to what purpose he says to the
[58:57] edifying of the church
[58:59] right so we say lord i want a great
[59:00] ministry i want to be a great minister i
[59:03] want to be a great minister
[59:04] i want to be a great singer i want to be
[59:06] a great musician i want to be a great
[59:07] song leader
[59:09] right and god says why
[59:12] right and then he gives us the truth
[59:14] pill so we can't lie and what do we say
[59:18] so that i can be identified with a group
[59:19] of other great ministers so that when i
[59:22] walk into the service then they announce
[59:24] my name over the pulpit
[59:26] so that i'm the one that's always asked
[59:27] to go up and sing the specials so that
[59:29] everybody knows who i am so that when
[59:32] they're in their little humble church
[59:33] and they're sick and tired of what
[59:34] they've got they'll stream me
[59:37] what is it it has nothing to do with the
[59:39] benefit of the body oft times if we were
[59:41] honest with ourselves there's a lot of
[59:42] selfishness that's built into those
[59:44] sorts of things we want to be careful
[59:46] that our we're looking for the benefit
[59:47] of others and not for the growth of
[59:49] ourselves that sounds silly those things
[59:50] i just said and i made them extreme for
[59:53] you know to make an extreme point and
[59:55] that's that sometimes if you take what
[59:57] you really want and take it all the way
[59:59] that's where you'd end up i want to be
[1:00:01] popular i want to be known
[1:00:03] right i want to be recognized
[1:00:06] that has nothing to do with it
[1:00:08] that has nothing to do with it i'm going
[1:00:09] to pick on sister maureen
[1:00:11] when she went to
[1:00:12] louisiana and
[1:00:14] brother phillip saw her
[1:00:16] come up
[1:00:18] on the platform
[1:00:20] and he said what's that old lady doing
[1:00:22] up there
[1:00:24] right
[1:00:26] why because he's used to someone younger
[1:00:28] coming up lots of power
[1:00:31] you know humble
[1:00:32] but usually a little younger
[1:00:34] you know maybe going to really bellow it
[1:00:36] out
[1:00:37] and he played her song for the next
[1:00:39] month
[1:00:40] after he got off after she got down from
[1:00:42] there why because he was expecting
[1:00:44] something different than what came up
[1:00:46] amen the holy spirit is humble and then
[1:00:48] it walks up and it's clothed in a way
[1:00:50] that we don't often expect but then when
[1:00:52] that spread in that presence comes down
[1:00:54] and anoints that gift look out
[1:00:56] and guess what if you got the holy ghost
[1:00:57] you'll catch that and you'll say that
[1:00:59] sure looks simple it sure looks simple
[1:01:01] there today but that touched me no way i
[1:01:03] haven't been touched in a long time with
[1:01:05] all the power with all the yelling all
[1:01:08] the shouting all the dancing all the
[1:01:10] great things that came our way and yet
[1:01:12] that little one came by and touched me
[1:01:14] in a way that i haven't been touched in
[1:01:16] a long time and you recognize that's the
[1:01:18] holy spirit that was moving and maybe
[1:01:19] some of the other stuff you've been
[1:01:21] dwelling on hasn't been quite so
[1:01:22] anointed as you thought amen i know
[1:01:25] sister maureen doesn't like to be lifted
[1:01:26] up like that but it was to make a point
[1:01:28] that our expectation should be that god
[1:01:29] will use whoever he wants to use amen
[1:01:32] and that if they're led to be up there
[1:01:33] then it's going to be a blessing to
[1:01:34] every one of us whether it's preaching
[1:01:35] whether it's singing whether it's going
[1:01:37] to help somebody move whether it's
[1:01:38] bringing a meal whether it's bringing
[1:01:40] blueberries over whatever it might be
[1:01:41] when god leads you to do it trust that
[1:01:43] it is a blessing and trust that he's
[1:01:45] leading you to do something for the
[1:01:46] benefit of somebody else amen
[1:01:49] amen but we watch out those people they
[1:01:51] get a little bit of success and that'll
[1:01:53] take their brain a lot of places if they
[1:01:55] don't have the character to match what
[1:01:56] god's putting their life in man so
[1:01:58] you'll find that if it's a godly gift as
[1:02:00] they grow their character grows with it
[1:02:02] to keep them lockstep so that they don't
[1:02:04] get a swelled head that's why you can't
[1:02:05] have a pastor that is a young man
[1:02:07] because the scripture says lest he get
[1:02:08] what caught up in himself right and he
[1:02:11] thinks he thinks of himself more than he
[1:02:12] ought to right it'll take him down and
[1:02:15] he'll take the whole church with them
[1:02:16] and you'll make a big mess out of it
[1:02:18] brother brown says this he says but see
[1:02:20] there's no bird can follow an eagle oh
[1:02:22] you say well hawkeye that hawk tried to
[1:02:24] follow an eagle he'd disintegrate in the
[1:02:26] air he couldn't follow that eagle if he
[1:02:28] had to see because that eagle can go so
[1:02:30] far that the hawk can't even get to it
[1:02:32] and before he can go there he has to be
[1:02:35] built so he can stand it
[1:02:38] but the higher you go the further away
[1:02:40] you can see like the astronauts and so
[1:02:42] forth now see the higher you go the
[1:02:44] further you can see if you're equipped
[1:02:46] to see now what good would it do the
[1:02:48] eagle to go way up there if he couldn't
[1:02:50] see after he got up there
[1:02:51] what's he saying you're looking for
[1:02:53] something you're looking for an
[1:02:54] expansion of your gift and you're not
[1:02:56] even equipped to use it if he was to if
[1:02:58] he was to give you what you're asking
[1:02:59] him for he's saying don't go any further
[1:03:01] than the gift will take you don't get
[1:03:03] ahead of it don't presume but rather
[1:03:05] wait till god equips you and then you've
[1:03:07] got some place that you can go with
[1:03:08] confidence
[1:03:09] he says i think that's the way
[1:03:12] really struggling here today brother
[1:03:13] weisha
[1:03:16] so i think that's the way many of us
[1:03:17] trying today to lift up into something
[1:03:20] when we're not first equipped oh god
[1:03:22] give me the gift of this and do this and
[1:03:24] that there you don't get it why you're
[1:03:26] not equipped for it you wouldn't do no
[1:03:28] good after you got up there and when you
[1:03:30] do and if you did try to lift yourself
[1:03:33] up you'd only bring what i call today
[1:03:35] what's hurt our church more than
[1:03:36] anything else a kernel comparison what
[1:03:39] is it you're making up something to
[1:03:42] replace the original that's supposed to
[1:03:43] be in your life amen you get there and
[1:03:45] realize you don't have what you thought
[1:03:47] you had and so you put something on to
[1:03:49] try and convince everybody else that you
[1:03:50] still have it and then we talked about
[1:03:52] those men that try and lead you down
[1:03:54] this place of you need to see visions
[1:03:55] and dreams and you've got to do this and
[1:03:57] you've got to have a supernatural angel
[1:03:58] and blah blah blah blah blah like they
[1:03:59] do and they're doing it just to try and
[1:04:01] get you to feel below them and to pay
[1:04:02] attention to them and they don't have a
[1:04:04] supernatural experience at all
[1:04:06] and then you watch people respond to a
[1:04:08] to a god anointed gift sometime and go
[1:04:11] give feedback to that person and now
[1:04:12] watch how that person responds when they
[1:04:14] say that was for me that was the holy
[1:04:16] spirit does that person get puffed up
[1:04:18] does that person start strutting around
[1:04:21] this is the real key how do they look at
[1:04:23] other people that have a gift like them
[1:04:25] do they start looking down you know
[1:04:27] there's a singer a great singer then the
[1:04:28] holy they sing and the holy spirit drops
[1:04:30] in the room you go say brother sister
[1:04:32] that was amazing that was so timely do
[1:04:35] they now go and when the next person
[1:04:36] gets up do they just kind of sit back
[1:04:38] and cross their arms do they look down
[1:04:40] their nose at that person because they
[1:04:42] may not have the same level of gift
[1:04:44] or do they enter in do they support do
[1:04:46] they put their shoulder to the wheel do
[1:04:47] they encourage those people do they use
[1:04:50] what they what that person's giving to
[1:04:51] the full effect
[1:04:52] right because we're going to have
[1:04:53] variations of gifts in this body whether
[1:04:55] it's singing whether it's preaching
[1:04:57] whether it's the different helps in the
[1:04:58] church deacons whatever it might be
[1:05:00] you're going to have variances and
[1:05:02] you've got to be able to handle those
[1:05:03] differences without getting snooty about
[1:05:04] it amen
[1:05:07] you take a great service with a minister
[1:05:09] and i've been in some tremendous
[1:05:10] services with some tremendous miracles
[1:05:12] in them and you go talk to that minister
[1:05:13] and you tell them and they talk about
[1:05:15] what happened and do they get arrogant
[1:05:16] do they start talking about themselves
[1:05:18] or do they keep pointing back to christ
[1:05:20] back to christ back to christ because
[1:05:21] that's what brother branham did right he
[1:05:23] said i can't do a thing and if i could i
[1:05:25] would but i can't and if those men start
[1:05:27] pointing to themselves and if they start
[1:05:28] putting down those that don't do the
[1:05:30] things they do you got a problem because
[1:05:31] it's an arrogant spirit and it's drawing
[1:05:33] to yourself
[1:05:34] amen remember moses went out he was kept
[1:05:38] out of the out of the land of kane and
[1:05:39] why because he put himself in the place
[1:05:41] of god when god didn't tell him to do it
[1:05:43] he said must die
[1:05:45] must i
[1:05:46] give you water
[1:05:48] and that's not what god told him to do
[1:05:50] right and god and brother brahm says i
[1:05:51] just heard it today he says he presumed
[1:05:53] and he put himself he took he took the
[1:05:55] credit to himself and he says that's
[1:05:57] what kept him out of the land of canaan
[1:05:59] one of the greatest prophets ever
[1:06:02] looking back that's the only one that
[1:06:03] the the the the the priests the the
[1:06:06] jewish priests look to moses he was the
[1:06:08] great prophet right there was a prophet
[1:06:10] like unto him that's who jesus is
[1:06:12] compared to that's how great he was and
[1:06:14] yet when he lifted himself up what
[1:06:16] happened god said you can't go into the
[1:06:17] promised land for that one time all the
[1:06:19] great things he did standing in the gap
[1:06:21] surrendered himself humbled himself gave
[1:06:23] himself up sacrificed himself for the
[1:06:25] children of israel and god kept him out
[1:06:26] because he put himself in the place of
[1:06:28] god and took credit for something that
[1:06:29] wasn't his amen
[1:06:31] i was listening to
[1:06:32] to how can i overcome today i've been
[1:06:34] listening to it for a while and i heard
[1:06:36] this next one and i i felt i had to put
[1:06:39] it in and he's talking about satan's
[1:06:41] temptation of jesus
[1:06:42] and he says
[1:06:45] no
[1:06:46] now we're fighting each other
[1:06:50] so he's talking about the the first uh
[1:06:51] way that satan attacked and the second
[1:06:53] one he said was that he made upon him
[1:06:55] that he would be a show-off
[1:06:57] and how that he how that does hit god's
[1:06:59] servants to be a show-off to show what
[1:07:02] you can do glory to god hallelujah i'm a
[1:07:04] deliverer i'm so he says see see
[1:07:07] come up here on top of the mountain and
[1:07:08] set down here he tempted him to do it
[1:07:10] now remember he was tempted to do it
[1:07:12] hard
[1:07:14] now if you want to be something before
[1:07:15] the people stand up here on this temple
[1:07:17] and jump off see i'll give you a
[1:07:19] scripture for it because it's written
[1:07:20] he'd give the angels charge over thee
[1:07:22] lest at any time dash a foot against the
[1:07:24] stone he barely up to make him a
[1:07:26] show-off to show his authority
[1:07:30] and he says no true servant of god ever
[1:07:32] does that you see a man showing off his
[1:07:34] chest out and all like that just
[1:07:36] remember there is something wrong there
[1:07:38] remember we talked about that arrogant
[1:07:40] spirit right anything that happens
[1:07:42] behind this pulpit that is supernatural
[1:07:45] is only by his grace and it has nothing
[1:07:47] to do with the man behind the pulpit
[1:07:49] ever
[1:07:49] ever ever it is god from start to finish
[1:07:53] no god don't want that jesus set the
[1:07:56] example he could have done it he
[1:07:57] certainly could have done it but he
[1:07:59] didn't do it no servant of god is a
[1:08:01] show-off of himself to try to take god's
[1:08:04] power and show himself above
[1:08:07] somebody else
[1:08:08] what is it you're there to do what edify
[1:08:11] the body and that's your constant thing
[1:08:13] howard how do i edify the body how do i
[1:08:14] build somebody up how do i encourage
[1:08:16] somebody how do i correct somebody with
[1:08:18] love today lord how do i add to the body
[1:08:20] rather than take away
[1:08:22] what can i do to benefit your body today
[1:08:25] now lord what can they do for me what
[1:08:26] can i do for them
[1:08:28] who was it that said i don't know if it
[1:08:29] was jfk that's not what you can do
[1:08:31] that's not what your country can do for
[1:08:33] you ask what you can do for your country
[1:08:35] that's how gifts operate that's not what
[1:08:37] the body can do for you ask what you can
[1:08:39] do for the body amen
[1:08:42] amen if you see a need ask god
[1:08:44] say lord use me
[1:08:45] listen when we're asking for revival we
[1:08:47] don't say lord send a revival on brother
[1:08:49] paul
[1:08:50] what do we say lord send a revival of me
[1:08:52] let it happen in me so you see a need
[1:08:54] you see a situation you go to praying
[1:08:55] and say lord help that person if you can
[1:08:57] use me to do it then do it
[1:08:59] but that don't but don't presume then
[1:09:01] that he's going to do it let him use
[1:09:03] whoever he's going to do
[1:09:04] it through and you can sit back and wait
[1:09:06] as well amen but if he moves on you to
[1:09:08] do it then move
[1:09:09] amen look to be an answer look to be a
[1:09:12] solution look to be a help look to be an
[1:09:13] encouragement in these things and we
[1:09:15] don't want to just sit back and pray all
[1:09:16] the time either sometimes that's we we
[1:09:19] we we're so spiritual that all we do is
[1:09:21] pray and we never move our feet our
[1:09:22] hands
[1:09:23] can i say that
[1:09:25] and then sometimes we sit there and
[1:09:26] we're in our prayer closet and we're
[1:09:27] being all so spiritual my wife and i
[1:09:29] were talking about a situation a while
[1:09:31] back and i said let's not just pray
[1:09:32] about it but let's look for a way to
[1:09:34] enter into this situation and then let's
[1:09:36] not just be somebody that's talking to
[1:09:38] god about it but let's be quick to act
[1:09:40] if he puts something let's look for ways
[1:09:41] that we can support people and encourage
[1:09:43] people along their path amen and if god
[1:09:46] wants to you to help he'll anoint your
[1:09:47] gift he'll put a burden there he'll put
[1:09:49] an unction there and we don't move until
[1:09:50] that action comes amen we're able to sit
[1:09:52] and wait
[1:09:54] romans 8 13
[1:09:56] says for if you live after the flesh ye
[1:09:59] shall die
[1:10:00] we're talking about gifts now
[1:10:02] if you do it your way it brings death
[1:10:05] brings death to you and it brings debt
[1:10:06] to the one that you're trying to work on
[1:10:08] he says but if you through the spirit
[1:10:11] to mortify the deeds of the body you
[1:10:14] shall live so when the holy spirit's
[1:10:16] working in you that's when life is
[1:10:18] generated and if it's you that's working
[1:10:20] in you that's when death is generated
[1:10:21] and then that way the it says it talks
[1:10:23] about the way that a man thinks and it
[1:10:25] is what death
[1:10:26] he thinks it's life but it's death every
[1:10:28] single time but he says now if you
[1:10:29] mortify the deeds of the body if you get
[1:10:31] yourself out of the way and you let the
[1:10:33] spirit roll through you you shall live
[1:10:35] life flows out of you you'll be a living
[1:10:36] fountain
[1:10:37] amen that's what we're looking to do be
[1:10:39] a living fountain that we can benefit
[1:10:40] somebody else
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:43] so again we're looking for the holy
[1:10:45] spirit to flip the switch if i can put
[1:10:47] it that way if i flip the switch bad
[1:10:49] things happen if god flips the switch
[1:10:51] supernatural things happen above and
[1:10:52] beyond what we could ever ask or think
[1:10:54] amen i'd much rather that amen than if i
[1:10:57] flip the switch and try and make a mess
[1:10:58] of things because that's what's
[1:10:59] absolutely going to happen
[1:11:01] amen let's go back to first corinthians
[1:11:03] 12 here verse 5. so we talked about
[1:11:06] gifts
[1:11:07] and it says and there are differences of
[1:11:09] administrations but the same lord now
[1:11:11] the first thing said that gifts it says
[1:11:13] it was we have diversities of gifts
[1:11:16] but the same spirit but now it says now
[1:11:18] we have administrations but the same
[1:11:21] lord so we've got a we've got a changing
[1:11:23] now of the order of this now this
[1:11:25] administration's means ministries and
[1:11:27] that's talking about the fivefold
[1:11:28] ministry apostles prophets evangelist
[1:11:30] pastors and teachers but it's also
[1:11:32] talking about the office of deacons and
[1:11:34] those that do charitable work in the
[1:11:36] church including the distribution of
[1:11:37] money goods food and taking care of the
[1:11:39] sick
[1:11:40] so this is people that have an active
[1:11:42] daily ministry if i could put it that
[1:11:44] way this is not people that have a an
[1:11:46] occasional thing but these are people
[1:11:48] that are constantly in a ministry of
[1:11:50] sorts if i could put it that way and
[1:11:51] paul says that these are under the same
[1:11:53] lord gifts are under the same spirit but
[1:11:55] he says these ministries these
[1:11:57] administrations are under the same lord
[1:11:59] what's the difference
[1:12:01] holy spirit's an anointing but lord is a
[1:12:03] whole different animal isn't it when we
[1:12:05] start talking about lord it means master
[1:12:07] the possessor and disposer of things the
[1:12:10] owner the one who has control of the
[1:12:13] person or the sovereign so again an
[1:12:15] anointing on a gift can come and go
[1:12:17] if we were to talk about a singing gift
[1:12:19] you're not sitting all day long singing
[1:12:21] under the anointing are you
[1:12:23] but you're sitting there and you're
[1:12:24] reading your book and then all of a
[1:12:25] sudden you jump up and next thing you're
[1:12:26] at the piano or you're at your guitar or
[1:12:28] whatever it is and you're playing a song
[1:12:30] and practicing it because the holy
[1:12:31] spirit has anointed you to sing it and
[1:12:33] then you'll go to church and you'll sing
[1:12:34] it and then you'll go back to reading
[1:12:36] your book
[1:12:37] right so it's an anointing that comes
[1:12:38] flips a switch and then steps back and
[1:12:40] now you can go back to regular life
[1:12:42] but when we start talking about
[1:12:44] ministries now this is a continuous
[1:12:46] thing where you don't get to back away
[1:12:48] like that this is something where you
[1:12:50] have to be open to the moving of the
[1:12:51] holy spirit on a regular basis now as
[1:12:54] believers we should be open to that
[1:12:56] anyways but your ministry your portion
[1:12:58] in the body now is much tighter because
[1:13:00] you have to be constantly under that
[1:13:02] leadership because if you don't people
[1:13:04] get hurt
[1:13:05] right when you talk about five full
[1:13:06] ministry if we presume if we get under a
[1:13:08] man anointing if we start doing things
[1:13:10] the way we want to do it then
[1:13:11] everything's gonna fall apart we'll get
[1:13:13] into a denomination is what we'll do
[1:13:15] right so you have to be under that
[1:13:17] anointing you have to you have to be
[1:13:18] seeing him now as lord over your life in
[1:13:22] a way that it isn't required if you're
[1:13:24] going to be a singer or or these
[1:13:25] different things it's a different type
[1:13:27] of ministry if i can put it that way
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:30] so the the element here is of continuous
[1:13:32] direction and leadership because now
[1:13:34] that gift has to be subject to lordship
[1:13:37] all the time you have to be always
[1:13:39] moving as god wants you to move and it's
[1:13:41] always happening in your life brother
[1:13:43] jail doesn't get to leave the church and
[1:13:45] then turn off his pastorship
[1:13:47] he goes home and he's still a pastor
[1:13:48] whether we need him at two o'clock in
[1:13:50] the morning or whether we need him at
[1:13:51] seven a.m the next day or whether we
[1:13:53] need him in the afternoon he's going to
[1:13:54] be studying he's going to be praying
[1:13:56] he's going to be open to the needs of
[1:13:57] the body and if there's issues going on
[1:13:59] then guess what he doesn't go to work
[1:14:01] he's in there and he's praying isn't he
[1:14:03] and he's studying he's looking for
[1:14:04] answers in the word and he's seeking
[1:14:06] god's purpose and leadership in these
[1:14:07] different things right so he doesn't get
[1:14:09] to turn it off deacons they get pulled
[1:14:11] into situations and guess what they
[1:14:13] don't get to turn it off they've always
[1:14:14] got to be ready that's why there's a
[1:14:15] spiritual requirement for a deacon they
[1:14:17] have to have the holy ghost in their
[1:14:19] life because they're going to get into
[1:14:20] situations where if men get involved and
[1:14:22] try and do things their way we're going
[1:14:23] to make a mess of it but they have to be
[1:14:25] led in the same way that the five full
[1:14:27] ministry is and then now we come down
[1:14:29] and you say well what about the people
[1:14:30] helping those charitable work going to
[1:14:32] the to be with the sick and that again
[1:14:34] you've got to be led you can go into a
[1:14:36] hospital room and leave that person
[1:14:37] worse than when you came in if you say
[1:14:39] the wrong things sometimes you've got to
[1:14:41] be a little harder than you would
[1:14:42] imagine right sometimes god's put them
[1:14:44] on their back and you got to let them
[1:14:45] know other times you're there purely as
[1:14:47] an encouragement and to keep them from
[1:14:49] getting what depressed down in the dumps
[1:14:51] worried are they going to die
[1:14:53] what sometimes it's just to go home and
[1:14:55] take care of the cat
[1:14:56] or the dog whatever it is you've got to
[1:14:58] be led on how you go and what you say
[1:15:00] and who you go with
[1:15:01] all these things you're ministering to
[1:15:03] people on a regular basis and not just
[1:15:05] over a pulpit or through that but now
[1:15:07] you're coming into their very lives
[1:15:09] you're getting real personal in these
[1:15:10] things and that's where you don't want
[1:15:12] man's finger going around and stirring
[1:15:13] up the spaghetti amen we want the holy
[1:15:15] spirit to be there and lead us and guide
[1:15:16] us so that we're not talking out of
[1:15:18] order so that we're not moving out of
[1:15:20] order and god can do what he wants in
[1:15:21] those different lives amen the most
[1:15:24] common greek word for minister is
[1:15:26] diaconos and it means a servant
[1:15:29] or one who executes a command of another
[1:15:32] and that's the root word that we're
[1:15:33] going back to when it comes to this
[1:15:35] these administrations is that we talk
[1:15:37] about ministers we talk about servants
[1:15:39] so a minister is one that gives not gets
[1:15:42] right a servant does not go around and
[1:15:44] do everything that the master says and
[1:15:46] then expect big accolades and rewards
[1:15:48] and clothes and nice cars and no a
[1:15:51] servant's duty is to do what what the
[1:15:52] master says when the master says it how
[1:15:55] the master says it and then in return he
[1:15:58] just gets taken care of he gets a a roof
[1:16:00] over his head he gets close on his back
[1:16:01] and he gets three square meals a day
[1:16:04] that's what a servant does they give and
[1:16:05] they give and they give and they get no
[1:16:07] more than anybody else in life even
[1:16:08] though they work harder than most why
[1:16:10] they're under a lord they're under a
[1:16:12] master and their constant duty is serve
[1:16:15] serve serve so if you want to get into
[1:16:17] this type of ministry get ready to serve
[1:16:19] because they're going to take way more
[1:16:20] than you're going to get
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:23] the pastor still gets to feed off the
[1:16:25] flock doesn't he we still pay him our
[1:16:26] ties we still support him in these
[1:16:27] different ways but i guarantee you
[1:16:29] brother gerald has given way more than
[1:16:30] he's gotten from us if i could put it
[1:16:32] that way why a minister serves they
[1:16:35] serve they serve they serve every day
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:39] amen so their gift here is not so much
[1:16:41] that they're an amazing speaker an
[1:16:43] amazing helper but the gift is that they
[1:16:44] can be led on a continuous basis by the
[1:16:46] holy spirit they can be led by the holy
[1:16:48] spirit in ways that most people can't
[1:16:51] and that that means that requires a
[1:16:52] sanctified life and it requires focus of
[1:16:56] purpose
[1:16:57] you've got to remember we talked about
[1:16:58] for the working of the ministry that's
[1:17:00] what they were given for the working of
[1:17:02] the ministry a minister is there for the
[1:17:04] ministering purpose alone that his that
[1:17:07] that's his primary focus in life is to
[1:17:09] minister to the body of christ amen amen
[1:17:12] amen equally important so it says that
[1:17:14] they can be led by god on a consistent
[1:17:16] basis but until they're led they won't
[1:17:18] move these are men and women that can
[1:17:20] sit still until they are firmly led by
[1:17:22] the holy spirit and even they can look
[1:17:24] at a situation they can see chaos they
[1:17:26] can see pain they can see suffering and
[1:17:28] yet they won't move until god tells them
[1:17:30] to move
[1:17:31] when you think about a chicken
[1:17:33] you get a chicken that's been born and
[1:17:35] it's sitting there in that egg and it's
[1:17:37] pipping its way out and it's got the
[1:17:38] little hook on the top of the beak to
[1:17:40] knock its way out remember what do they
[1:17:42] say if you see a chicken trying to break
[1:17:43] out do you help it
[1:17:45] no
[1:17:46] why because the strength that it is
[1:17:47] building up is what allows it to survive
[1:17:49] the first few hours after it breaks out
[1:17:51] of that egg
[1:17:52] so if you help that chicken break out of
[1:17:54] the egg then it's going to die
[1:17:56] immediately and sometimes what it is is
[1:17:58] we look at situations as ministers or
[1:18:00] people that are in these ministries and
[1:18:01] you want to help and you want to help
[1:18:02] and you want to help and the holy spirit
[1:18:04] has put a wall there and says do not
[1:18:06] touch this leave it alone i'm working
[1:18:09] here
[1:18:10] they have to develop strength they have
[1:18:11] to be able to stand on their own two
[1:18:13] feet they've got to have their own
[1:18:14] personal walk they've got to get their
[1:18:16] own leadership and until they do they're
[1:18:18] not going to be of any use so don't go
[1:18:19] in and touch this one i've got to work
[1:18:21] with them one-on-one and god's got to
[1:18:23] come into a life and he's got to work
[1:18:24] with a father he's got to work with a
[1:18:25] husband he's got to work out these
[1:18:27] situations himself and you can't get in
[1:18:29] there and try and fix it because there's
[1:18:30] no fixing it god's got to bring that
[1:18:32] person back to the word themselves amen
[1:18:34] of times usually the way that is is
[1:18:35] you've helped and helped and helped and
[1:18:37] nothing's happened and then god says
[1:18:38] step away i've got to do this one on one
[1:18:40] now and it's usually not very pretty
[1:18:42] you've got to be able to step back even
[1:18:44] when you see things going going south
[1:18:46] when you see things going bad and say i
[1:18:48] don't move until i'm told to move
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:52] continuing on here verse 6. it says
[1:18:54] there are diversities of operations but
[1:18:57] it is the same god which worketh all in
[1:19:01] all so again we have another you know
[1:19:03] the first one it was by by the holy
[1:19:05] spirit the second one is by lord but now
[1:19:06] with operations it comes to god
[1:19:09] now we don't believe in a trinity and
[1:19:10] this is not a trinity but there are
[1:19:11] attributes and descriptions of god and
[1:19:13] they matter paul didn't put three
[1:19:15] different words here just to have fun or
[1:19:17] because he had a really good uh you know
[1:19:20] dictionary in his head right he put this
[1:19:22] here by the holy spirit there's a reason
[1:19:24] why he says spirit and then he says lord
[1:19:26] and then he says god now the thing with
[1:19:28] operations is that he's saying here
[1:19:31] that's the same god that works in each
[1:19:33] one and achieves what is achieved
[1:19:36] it's god that's doing it men are doing
[1:19:38] it women are doing it but it is god that
[1:19:40] actually does the work amen so we have
[1:19:42] operations in there in a different
[1:19:43] category and it's only used twice in
[1:19:45] scripture and both of these verses are
[1:19:47] are in first corinthians 12 the second
[1:19:49] one is listed there it says to another
[1:19:51] the working of miracles the operation of
[1:19:53] miracles
[1:19:55] and then so an operation here is a thing
[1:19:58] wrought
[1:19:59] a working or an effect now you think of
[1:20:01] something rot like wrought iron it's
[1:20:03] usually metal work and then so you take
[1:20:05] something that is not a finished
[1:20:06] material and you turn it into something
[1:20:08] that is a finished good you take a raw
[1:20:10] material and you turn it into something
[1:20:12] that is eminently useful
[1:20:14] that word rot means worked into shape by
[1:20:16] artistry or effort
[1:20:18] elaborately embellished or processed for
[1:20:21] use
[1:20:22] beaten into shape or deeply stirred
[1:20:26] so we're talking about rot things that
[1:20:28] are rot
[1:20:29] so you may be heard of a wrought iron
[1:20:30] fence i guarantee you when they took
[1:20:33] that that rod that iron rod and they
[1:20:36] forged it in their in their
[1:20:37] manufacturing facilities it didn't look
[1:20:39] like this
[1:20:40] but now that takes a craftsman that
[1:20:42] takes a welder that takes somebody that
[1:20:43] knows how to rot iron and they'll take
[1:20:47] that and they'll build that right on
[1:20:48] site there's a brother down ex-brother i
[1:20:50] guess at this point down in louisiana
[1:20:52] that does this sort of thing and he'll
[1:20:54] take it and he's a welder by trade and
[1:20:55] he'll take all those pieces of metal and
[1:20:57] it's just flat bar and tubes or or
[1:20:59] whatever it might be bars and he'll turn
[1:21:01] it into these fancy gates like this it
[1:21:03] costs thousands and thousands of dollars
[1:21:05] because it requires incredible precision
[1:21:07] and incredible workmanship and
[1:21:08] repeatability
[1:21:11] it takes a lot of work this is artistry
[1:21:13] here nobody you don't just walk up and
[1:21:15] do this one day it takes a lot of
[1:21:17] training you've got to really know what
[1:21:18] you're doing with your materials with
[1:21:19] your heat and these different things
[1:21:21] amen so we blend all that together and
[1:21:23] we see that enough that operations are
[1:21:25] things that are worked into shape by
[1:21:27] artistry or effort
[1:21:29] so that scripture said to another what
[1:21:31] the the working of miracles and before
[1:21:33] that said the diversities of operations
[1:21:36] it's a it's the same god working so it's
[1:21:38] god that's doing the working here it's
[1:21:40] god that's doing the embellishing it's
[1:21:41] god that's doing the artistry we're
[1:21:43] talking about putting the finishing
[1:21:44] touches on something taking it from a
[1:21:46] raw state into a beautifully finished
[1:21:48] state turning what looks like just a
[1:21:50] bunch of raw steel into something that
[1:21:52] looks like this that takes an artist
[1:21:54] that takes an author that takes a
[1:21:56] creator if we can put it that way and
[1:21:57] that's why he talks about god here is
[1:21:59] because he's what the author and the
[1:22:01] creator of the body of christ amen he's
[1:22:03] the one that's going to bring us to that
[1:22:04] finished state amen these are things
[1:22:06] that are ordained to be what we're
[1:22:08] looking at here is what the image that
[1:22:10] was in his mind before the world began
[1:22:12] and he says there are people that are
[1:22:14] here to do that to bring you into that
[1:22:17] image that he had of you before the
[1:22:19] world began but the one that's doing it
[1:22:21] in them now is god and he is the author
[1:22:23] and he's the finisher and he's the cre
[1:22:24] he's the great creator of all these
[1:22:26] things and then he's the alpha and omega
[1:22:28] if i could put it that way and he's the
[1:22:29] one that's working through these
[1:22:30] different gifts to bring out the
[1:22:32] beautiful product that we see at the end
[1:22:34] amen so now we've got a different group
[1:22:36] of gifts and this is a very special
[1:22:38] group and he jumps down and we'll get
[1:22:40] into it in a little bit
[1:22:42] but just to hammer this down in the
[1:22:43] scripture ecclesiastes 3 11 says he hath
[1:22:46] made everything beautiful in his tongue
[1:22:49] amen we don't get to choose it and again
[1:22:50] these men these people that are in these
[1:22:52] ministries they can't choose to do these
[1:22:54] things but these are supernatural events
[1:22:56] usually that cause a great change from
[1:22:58] something that's very common into
[1:23:00] something that is amazing and beautiful
[1:23:01] amen and you'll see that with people
[1:23:03] that that get saved they get delivered
[1:23:05] in these different things and in a split
[1:23:07] second something happens in their life
[1:23:09] and it's a supernatural effect and it's
[1:23:10] through men and women with great gifts
[1:23:12] that these things tend to happen
[1:23:14] amen so he had made everything beautiful
[1:23:16] in his time also he has set the world in
[1:23:18] their hearts so that no man can find out
[1:23:20] the work that god maketh from the
[1:23:21] beginning to end i put the amplified
[1:23:23] there because it explains this a little
[1:23:25] more easily it says he has made
[1:23:27] everything beautiful in his time he has
[1:23:29] also planted eternity in men's hearts
[1:23:32] that's the seed word of god
[1:23:34] amen he's planted it in their hearts and
[1:23:36] minds it says a divinely implanted sense
[1:23:40] of a purpose working through the age
[1:23:42] which nothing under the sun but god
[1:23:44] alone can satisfy and that's what
[1:23:46] happens is when that light crosses your
[1:23:48] path and it quickens that seed inside of
[1:23:50] you you knew there is something
[1:23:51] something jumps out and you're like why
[1:23:53] am i thinking these thoughts why am i
[1:23:55] desiring these things why am i going in
[1:23:57] this direction towards god when i've
[1:23:58] never even thought about it before and
[1:24:00] he says it's something that was planted
[1:24:02] in there and you'll never understand it
[1:24:04] and you never could understand it but
[1:24:05] it's there and it's god that did it and
[1:24:07] then it's god that's going to bring out
[1:24:09] the very thing that he placed inside of
[1:24:10] you into that finished thing we talked
[1:24:12] about it's the original seed that we
[1:24:13] talked about so long ago amen he says
[1:24:16] what it's done in a way so that men
[1:24:19] cannot find out what god has done from
[1:24:21] the beginning to end and then his ways
[1:24:23] are higher than our ways we're never
[1:24:24] going to figure this out intellectually
[1:24:26] we're never going to understand it all
[1:24:28] intellectually we're never going to be
[1:24:29] able to figure it out by by education or
[1:24:31] theology and these different things amen
[1:24:33] but it is something that he alone can
[1:24:35] work and he understands what it's
[1:24:37] supposed to look like and now he can
[1:24:38] move in men and women and help bring
[1:24:40] this out and all they see is a portion
[1:24:42] of it each one of them only sees a
[1:24:43] portion but if they can be anointed for
[1:24:45] to do that little portion god will use
[1:24:47] them and then it'll go to the next one
[1:24:48] the next one the next one until we all
[1:24:50] end up what in the unity that we talked
[1:24:52] about we're all in a rapture we're a
[1:24:54] perfect spotless bride and everybody's
[1:24:56] had a little bit of a part to play in it
[1:24:57] but it was god through the whole thing
[1:24:59] amen the author and the finisher of our
[1:25:01] faith amen so we when we get into people
[1:25:03] that are working in the operation side
[1:25:05] it's kind of like a surgeon that's doing
[1:25:07] reconstructive work right if you really
[1:25:09] all of us are like we're in a hospital
[1:25:11] and we're all broken up we're in a bad
[1:25:12] accident and god's trying to put us back
[1:25:14] together he's trying to put us back into
[1:25:16] our original condition and nobody knows
[1:25:18] what we're supposed to look like because
[1:25:19] we're all broken so what he does is he
[1:25:21] he comes in as what a great surgeon he
[1:25:23] restores our body to the way it was
[1:25:24] supposed to look before we were ever in
[1:25:26] the accident but we don't know because
[1:25:27] we're all broken up so he's turning us
[1:25:30] into what we were and all we've ever
[1:25:32] seen is broken and he's turning us into
[1:25:33] beautiful amen and so he's got people
[1:25:36] that do that so now you're in these
[1:25:38] operations now as i mentioned there you
[1:25:39] get into miracles of healing
[1:25:41] what's a miracle of healing it's
[1:25:42] restoring you back to the health that
[1:25:44] you were supposed to have from the very
[1:25:45] beginning
[1:25:46] you'll get miracles of deliverance what
[1:25:48] is it restoring your mind or your nature
[1:25:50] or your body to its intended place
[1:25:52] taking away things like addictions and
[1:25:54] bad habits and those sorts of things
[1:25:56] you'll get into what the miracles of
[1:25:57] safe keeping
[1:25:58] paul on the remember when he he was
[1:26:00] shipwrecked and he goes in and he works
[1:26:02] a miracle when he puts his hand in the
[1:26:03] wood and he gets bitten that's a miracle
[1:26:06] that he worked there and it was for his
[1:26:07] safe keeping it but it was also a proof
[1:26:09] to them that a man of god walked amongst
[1:26:11] them you have miracles of childbirth
[1:26:13] right elisha and the shunammite woman
[1:26:15] what is it he speaks to her
[1:26:18] what she desired
[1:26:19] and she says you know don't tease me you
[1:26:21] know i i don't want to be disappointed
[1:26:23] death to that to death he says no no no
[1:26:25] let's say it the lord you're going to
[1:26:26] have a child and she gets the child and
[1:26:28] then she goes back to that man when she
[1:26:30] loses the child he restores him back yet
[1:26:32] again
[1:26:33] and then what is it it is operations it
[1:26:35] is doing supernatural things for people
[1:26:37] that they can't do themselves that's
[1:26:38] what operations are now that is not
[1:26:40] always a gift as in it doesn't have to
[1:26:42] be working all the time but it can be
[1:26:44] the lord dropping something in on your
[1:26:45] heart and we get into a thus say at the
[1:26:47] lord moment in our in our lives where we
[1:26:49] speak the word and what happens is
[1:26:50] exactly what we said what is it that's a
[1:26:52] gift of operations that's god moving in
[1:26:54] you supernaturally to do something for
[1:26:56] your for somebody else that they can't
[1:26:58] do for themselves that's a gift of
[1:27:00] operations amen
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:03] amen so we have the holy spirit
[1:27:04] controlling gifts then in
[1:27:06] administrations you've got to recognize
[1:27:07] him as full lord and now then we get
[1:27:09] into operations that is god is the
[1:27:11] author and finisher of our lives amen
[1:27:13] it's all one and the same god like i
[1:27:14] said it's not a trinity but you look at
[1:27:16] the timing and the impact of each
[1:27:18] attribute or expression of god and those
[1:27:20] gifts and you can see how they differ
[1:27:22] switching on and off in some cases
[1:27:24] always on and then you have people that
[1:27:26] literally just supernaturally they'll
[1:27:27] drop into your life and do something
[1:27:29] then they walk away and you may never
[1:27:30] see them again what is it they're going
[1:27:32] around just doing supernatural things in
[1:27:33] people's lives that's not that's our
[1:27:35] ministry it's just and sometimes it's
[1:27:37] only once
[1:27:38] you can look in the scripture and see
[1:27:39] people that did great things only once
[1:27:41] but they were anointed to do it
[1:27:43] amen shamgar what he did that was an
[1:27:46] operation
[1:27:47] right he destroyed an enemy by himself
[1:27:49] that they couldn't destroy with all of
[1:27:50] their men before that what is it the
[1:27:52] holy spirit dropping down on him and
[1:27:53] anointing him for victory amen and it's
[1:27:55] the same thing amen all of these people
[1:27:57] in these roles have to be under a
[1:27:59] supernatural influence and it's always
[1:28:01] through yielding to the holy spirit it
[1:28:03] is not something that they operate in
[1:28:05] and of themselves
[1:28:06] james 1 17 says every good gift and
[1:28:09] every perfect gift is from above and
[1:28:11] cometh down from the father of lights
[1:28:14] with whom is no variableness neither
[1:28:17] shadow of turning what that means is
[1:28:18] that if he did it one time you'll always
[1:28:20] do it the same way and then brother
[1:28:22] branham focused on that time and time
[1:28:23] again of his ministry if you can point
[1:28:25] to the word where god did something one
[1:28:26] way one time you can go back on the same
[1:28:28] ground and do get the exact same results
[1:28:30] amen those gifts will operate in the
[1:28:32] same way jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:28:34] today forever it wasn't only for the
[1:28:36] apostles it wasn't only for a book of
[1:28:37] acts church amen but it was for every
[1:28:39] son and daughter of god that can believe
[1:28:40] the word amen amen the thing that we see
[1:28:44] here is that their gift is always in how
[1:28:46] they yield and the and how much they can
[1:28:48] yield
[1:28:49] and how often they can yield
[1:28:52] it's difficult to do that on a regular
[1:28:54] basis
[1:28:55] you'll see it in jesus life i don't have
[1:28:56] to look to myself or any other minister
[1:28:58] just look to jesus how weak and weary he
[1:29:00] got under the operation of his gift
[1:29:01] brother branham we saw that thing in a
[1:29:03] modern day right it absolutely destroyed
[1:29:05] their body but they were able to yield
[1:29:07] in a way and it destroyed their body but
[1:29:09] they were able to help so many people
[1:29:11] because they had such an ability to get
[1:29:13] themselves out of the way and let god
[1:29:14] move through them so when you start with
[1:29:16] the the original gifts that's actually
[1:29:17] the lowest level of yielding
[1:29:19] it's a temporary yielding it's a it's an
[1:29:21] occasional thing then you get into the
[1:29:23] administrations and that's a constant
[1:29:25] one but it's not as deep
[1:29:27] and then you get into operations and
[1:29:28] that's a heavy impact that's really the
[1:29:30] supernatural coming through a person and
[1:29:33] that's
[1:29:34] again occasional but it's a very
[1:29:36] significant moment i remember when when
[1:29:38] blanca and selena in in dallas and we
[1:29:40] had brother joe adams come from
[1:29:42] louisiana and he prayed for blanca she
[1:29:44] didn't ask
[1:29:45] he found out she had gallbladder attacks
[1:29:47] and he called her up in the service he
[1:29:48] prayed for her and he cast it out and
[1:29:49] she's been the be she's been fine ever
[1:29:51] since
[1:29:52] you don't get healed from gold attack
[1:29:54] gallbladder attacks doesn't happen once
[1:29:56] they once they start you can't get away
[1:29:57] from it and he laid hands on her she
[1:29:59] said i didn't have faith for nothing i
[1:30:01] wouldn't go up expecting anything i
[1:30:03] didn't have some great anything she just
[1:30:04] said i went up bowed my head he prayed
[1:30:06] and it was gone
[1:30:08] that's an operation that's a gift of
[1:30:10] supernatural capacity where a man says
[1:30:13] this isn't supposed to be he gets
[1:30:15] anointed to do it he calls that person
[1:30:17] up out of the congregation and he cast
[1:30:19] that thing right out of her that place
[1:30:20] and at the same time he prayed for
[1:30:22] selena and she had lactose intolerance
[1:30:24] and she's never had it you can't keep
[1:30:25] her off the milk now
[1:30:27] right we went out and had we left that
[1:30:29] service and we went and had ice cream
[1:30:30] immediately after that and that would
[1:30:32] normally have given selena that she
[1:30:33] would have been up all night screaming
[1:30:35] because of gas and blanco had a
[1:30:38] gallbladder attack and we went out and
[1:30:39] had big ice cream after that service
[1:30:41] amen that's an operation amen but that's
[1:30:43] just one thing and guess what joe's
[1:30:45] preached many wonderful services but
[1:30:46] he's never done that again in our life
[1:30:49] and there's been opportunities to do but
[1:30:50] he never has but just at that one time
[1:30:52] that was him yielding following the
[1:30:53] leadership of the holy spirit and that's
[1:30:55] what happened amen an operation a
[1:30:56] supernatural event where somebody's
[1:30:58] anointed to speak a word to give to to
[1:31:01] do something and step out in faith and
[1:31:02] god meets them there and does something
[1:31:04] tremendous in the body of christ amen
[1:31:09] philippians 4 13
[1:31:11] says i can do all things through christ
[1:31:14] which strengthens me and then our only
[1:31:16] limit is how much of christ will allow
[1:31:18] in and he matches that gift to how much
[1:31:20] you'll allow in you want a great gift
[1:31:23] great yielding great surrender is what's
[1:31:24] going to be the requirement amen you got
[1:31:26] to get a whole lot of yourself out in
[1:31:28] order to allow him to work amen
[1:31:30] so how much of christ will you allow in
[1:31:31] your life look at the the parable of the
[1:31:34] sower amen you had some that produced 30
[1:31:35] fold you had some that produced 60 fold
[1:31:37] and some that produced a hundredfold
[1:31:38] what was the difference
[1:31:40] i'd like to know
[1:31:42] i'd like to do the hundredfold thing if
[1:31:43] i could amen
[1:31:45] brother branham takes us back to the
[1:31:46] scripture to answer this he takes us to
[1:31:48] psalm 1. he says blessed is the man that
[1:31:50] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:31:52] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:31:55] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:31:57] scornful
[1:31:58] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:32:00] lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[1:32:03] and night
[1:32:04] amen you bring forth the lot of god when
[1:32:06] you don't take advice from people that
[1:32:07] aren't a part of the body of christ
[1:32:09] when you don't even associate much less
[1:32:12] do
[1:32:13] the lifestyle of a sinner when you're
[1:32:15] not a critic and when your great
[1:32:17] pleasure and enjoyment is the word of
[1:32:18] god
[1:32:19] you want to produce 100 fold brother
[1:32:21] brown takes us back here and says this
[1:32:23] is the way to do it
[1:32:24] then he continues in verse three and he
[1:32:26] says
[1:32:27] this is the end result and he shall be
[1:32:29] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:32:31] water that bringeth forth his fruit
[1:32:34] that's your fruit that's your gift it's
[1:32:36] what you bring to christ we all have a
[1:32:37] crown delay at his feet and the jewels
[1:32:39] in it are the work that you do on here
[1:32:41] that are that's of eternal value that's
[1:32:42] the souls you bring with you right so
[1:32:45] you have fruit in his season you have a
[1:32:47] season you have a time
[1:32:49] and not all of us are in the same time
[1:32:50] and season but we know before we get out
[1:32:52] of here we'll all have fruit amen we'll
[1:32:54] have all brought forth something of
[1:32:55] eternal value his leaf shall not wither
[1:32:58] that's your way of supernatural living i
[1:33:00] mean that's the way you absorb the word
[1:33:02] that's the way you absorb eternal life
[1:33:03] he says that doesn't go away when you're
[1:33:05] planted here this way you'll never lose
[1:33:07] that ability to have super supernatural
[1:33:10] life coming out of you the life of god's
[1:33:11] going to be in you for the rest of your
[1:33:13] time amen and whatsoever
[1:33:16] he doeth shall prosper everything you do
[1:33:18] is going to prosper in the eyes of god
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:21] brother brown says this right after he's
[1:33:23] read this he says rivers what is that he
[1:33:25] says the nine spiritual gifts rivers of
[1:33:27] one water one spirit one water but
[1:33:30] coming from nine different resources
[1:33:31] rivers of water see
[1:33:33] he's saying what you need to have nine
[1:33:35] those nine spiritual gifts in the body
[1:33:37] because they're there to benefit it's
[1:33:38] going to help you grow
[1:33:39] he says it the tree wasn't set out he
[1:33:42] shall be like a tree that set out
[1:33:44] transposed from this to that he was
[1:33:46] planted what's that predestinated the
[1:33:49] thought of god before the foundation of
[1:33:51] the world placed him there see not stuck
[1:33:53] out not by chant
[1:33:55] chants but was planted or predestinated
[1:33:57] what to the rivers of water
[1:33:59] his root shall not wither he says oh
[1:34:01] hallelujah though he dies i'll raise him
[1:34:03] up again at the last day what the life
[1:34:05] goes down into the roots but it rises
[1:34:06] again in the in the spring he says
[1:34:08] that's right
[1:34:09] he is predestinated to be there just not
[1:34:12] just by chance he was predestinated to
[1:34:14] catch that word when it
[1:34:17] what was sowed
[1:34:17] catching
[1:34:19] are you catching the word that's being
[1:34:20] sold
[1:34:21] he says you're predestinated to do it
[1:34:24] he says and she'll be right there when
[1:34:26] it sticks she is there he's planted not
[1:34:28] just stuck down he says he's actually
[1:34:31] planted that's right it's a lot
[1:34:32] different between sticking a stick in
[1:34:34] the ground and planting something this
[1:34:36] is done with purpose and intent he says
[1:34:39] people that have a life like this have
[1:34:41] been planted they've been purposefully
[1:34:42] placed in a way that they can grow
[1:34:44] spiritually he says it's different the
[1:34:47] seed was planted it found its own root
[1:34:49] holes he says there was a place prepared
[1:34:51] for it to get in there and start growing
[1:34:53] and when the water began to come in and
[1:34:55] bring forth its life the spirit it began
[1:34:57] to say you say there are nine spiritual
[1:34:58] gifts and he says amen jesus christ the
[1:35:01] same yesterday today and forever amen he
[1:35:03] still heals the way he always did amen
[1:35:06] amen amen he says what that man that's
[1:35:08] planted by the rivers of life is going
[1:35:10] to say amen to every word of god
[1:35:12] he says he's planted by the rivers
[1:35:14] rivers coming from every side rivers of
[1:35:17] water no wonder he can't winter wither
[1:35:19] no wonder he's planted some of them
[1:35:22] seeds fell over there he can't die it's
[1:35:24] right in the stream of life it keeps
[1:35:26] producing that's right it's drawing its
[1:35:28] life out of them rivers rivers the new
[1:35:31] testament and the old testament amen
[1:35:33] just being fed right on through
[1:35:36] what is it genesis to revelation that's
[1:35:38] how we keep living that's how we keep
[1:35:39] growing as we keep that alignment
[1:35:41] between the first and the last amen from
[1:35:43] the beginning and the end it has to line
[1:35:45] up and that's how we know that we're on
[1:35:46] the right path amen that it's life
[1:35:48] that's coming through us and then i've
[1:35:49] talked to believers that i luck up to i
[1:35:51] fellowship with believers that i i see a
[1:35:53] great consistency in and every single
[1:35:55] one of them tells me if you want to get
[1:35:56] close to god do what brother brahm said
[1:35:58] read your bible and pray every single
[1:36:01] day
[1:36:03] don't take saturdays off
[1:36:05] right don't take sundays off just
[1:36:07] because you're going to church every day
[1:36:09] read your bible and pray and guess what
[1:36:12] the world will take up every time that
[1:36:14] you set aside so you've got to set aside
[1:36:16] and say this is my time for the lord no
[1:36:18] matter what
[1:36:19] no matter what and sometimes what i'm
[1:36:21] finding is that means you get up earlier
[1:36:23] and earlier amen but you still got to
[1:36:25] get that time otherwise you're going to
[1:36:26] come to the end of the day and you're
[1:36:27] going to wonder why you're so beat out
[1:36:29] and it's because you haven't taken the
[1:36:30] time to do
[1:36:32] what
[1:36:33] rivers of life and then start drinking
[1:36:35] from the rivers of life you can't be
[1:36:37] much help if you're destroyed yourself
[1:36:38] if you're withered up if you're dried
[1:36:40] out if you're you're scaly and hard
[1:36:43] what if you can start your morning like
[1:36:44] that you're going to do a whole lot
[1:36:45] better to those you run into i think
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:49] otherwise what the holy spirit's not
[1:36:51] there to quicken what you if you don't
[1:36:53] bring anything in then how can the holy
[1:36:54] spirit quicken it right you've got the
[1:36:56] holy spirit i'm not taking away your
[1:36:57] christianity but if he's got nothing to
[1:36:59] quicken then you've got nothing to offer
[1:37:01] and now you're feeding on yesterday's
[1:37:02] manna and guess what that's maggoty
[1:37:05] right it's lost it's savor it's lost
[1:37:06] it's the good flavor it's it's it's dead
[1:37:09] that was for yesterday you've got to
[1:37:10] have something new each and every day
[1:37:14] almost done
[1:37:15] paul says first corinthians 12 we're
[1:37:17] back here again he says he's talking
[1:37:19] about gifts and why they're given
[1:37:22] he says but the manifestation of the
[1:37:24] spirit that's what these gifts are the
[1:37:26] true gifts or manifestations of the
[1:37:28] spirit is given to every man to profit
[1:37:30] with all
[1:37:32] amen it's the prophet and benefit the
[1:37:33] body of christ for to one is given by
[1:37:36] the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:37:38] to another the word of knowledge by the
[1:37:40] same spirit to another faith by the same
[1:37:42] spirit to another gifts of healing by
[1:37:44] the same spirit
[1:37:46] you look at that wisdom that can look at
[1:37:48] it that can look like a lot of different
[1:37:49] things can't it it can be words it can
[1:37:51] be actions it can be your presence
[1:37:54] presence meaning you being you know
[1:37:55] there with somebody it can be fellowship
[1:37:58] and then these are not all things that
[1:37:59] are just you know ethereal something out
[1:38:01] there but these are real tangible things
[1:38:03] that can that can really be shown to
[1:38:04] people amen a word of knowledge word of
[1:38:07] knowledge just say the right thing at
[1:38:08] the right time to the right person amen
[1:38:10] amen and it's god speaking it's not you
[1:38:12] speaking
[1:38:13] amen faith how do we cover faith what
[1:38:15] does faith look like
[1:38:17] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[1:38:19] but you've got to have faith in so many
[1:38:21] different things that to have a gift of
[1:38:22] faith you got to go if you're going to
[1:38:24] go pray for somebody if you're going to
[1:38:26] intercede in a situation you've got to
[1:38:27] know that god wants you to do it and so
[1:38:29] that faith comes after what you seeking
[1:38:31] out the will of god and getting that
[1:38:32] direction
[1:38:33] that can look like a lot of different
[1:38:34] things whether you can be financially
[1:38:36] helping somebody you can go to talk to
[1:38:38] somebody you can have a dream of
[1:38:40] somebody and say
[1:38:42] hey i had a dream about this i wanted to
[1:38:44] run it by you what
[1:38:46] sometimes there's an issue there
[1:38:48] sometimes there's an issue and you say
[1:38:49] brother i dream this about you i have no
[1:38:51] idea if it means something but i felt
[1:38:53] that i should come tell you about it
[1:38:54] right and sometimes you don't need to
[1:38:56] give any you don't need to give them
[1:38:57] what it means they know exactly what it
[1:38:58] means and the fact that you told them no
[1:39:00] is letting them know what the lord has
[1:39:02] an eye on this situation and either you
[1:39:04] better watch out
[1:39:06] or you're on the right path
[1:39:07] or you need to be careful
[1:39:09] or you better look out because
[1:39:10] something's headed your way right it can
[1:39:12] be in so many different ways that these
[1:39:14] things come a gift of healing what's
[1:39:16] healing physical mental emotional
[1:39:19] spiritual
[1:39:20] all these different things right healing
[1:39:22] takes on so many different facets you
[1:39:24] can heal through music right you can
[1:39:26] heal through the preaching of the word
[1:39:28] you can heal through fellowship
[1:39:30] right you can heal through good food
[1:39:34] you can heal through helping somebody
[1:39:35] out in a time of need so many things
[1:39:37] that we can do to heal somebody amen
[1:39:40] he says what to another the working of
[1:39:42] miracles this was the operations we were
[1:39:44] talking about to another prophecy to
[1:39:46] another discerning of spirits to another
[1:39:48] diverse kinds of tongues to another the
[1:39:51] interpretation of tongues
[1:39:53] but he finishes and says but all these
[1:39:54] worketh that but all of these worketh
[1:39:57] that one and selfsame spirit dividing to
[1:40:00] every man severally as he will what that
[1:40:03] means is that the holy spirit is always
[1:40:04] the one that's operating those gifts
[1:40:06] amen brother branham says these gifts
[1:40:08] are not necessarily creation gifts
[1:40:10] meaning that you're born with them
[1:40:12] he says these can be operated in most
[1:40:14] people at any time based on what the
[1:40:16] need of the body is
[1:40:18] so one day brother bob could come up and
[1:40:19] lay hands on somebody and they could get
[1:40:21] healed and then the next day brother
[1:40:22] mark could do the same thing and then
[1:40:23] the next day brother joe could do it and
[1:40:25] then the next day brother josh and then
[1:40:26] the next day brother gerald
[1:40:28] it can move around in the body based on
[1:40:30] the need and based on what the surrender
[1:40:31] and the yielding of that vessel to be
[1:40:33] open to that sort of thing
[1:40:35] lots of people wouldn't have the courage
[1:40:36] to do something like that but they can
[1:40:38] always go and they can help in other
[1:40:39] different ways right but these things
[1:40:41] are available to all but then you have
[1:40:43] others that have actual ministries based
[1:40:45] on this and that's maybe a slightly
[1:40:46] different thing amen
[1:40:48] but all of them he says in the end it's
[1:40:50] dividing to every man as he will it's
[1:40:52] not our choosing amen it's god's
[1:40:54] choosing
[1:40:55] this is a long quote i'm going to read
[1:40:56] but stick with me here if you will
[1:41:01] he says and the power that will raise us
[1:41:03] up is right in us now we're talking
[1:41:05] about a body of christ now
[1:41:07] we are now in heavenly places and we are
[1:41:09] now in the power of the resurrection
[1:41:12] if there wasn't a law to that sons and
[1:41:15] daughters of god would create them a
[1:41:16] world out here and go live a private
[1:41:18] life on it you have the power in you to
[1:41:20] do it if you've got a shadow of the
[1:41:22] power of god in you you've got power to
[1:41:24] do it
[1:41:25] god is omnipotent he says see what i
[1:41:27] mean the power that's in you will make
[1:41:30] create
[1:41:31] you could speak a world into existence
[1:41:33] and go live on it he says hallelujah
[1:41:34] there you are
[1:41:36] but he says there's a law that says you
[1:41:38] can't do it that's the reason you don't
[1:41:39] do this because he doesn't he hasn't
[1:41:40] allowed us to do it but he says if you
[1:41:42] realize who you are and that law wasn't
[1:41:44] there we could go create a world and
[1:41:45] live on it we could get out of all of
[1:41:46] this
[1:41:48] he says that's what power is in the
[1:41:51] church now but it is controlled by a law
[1:41:54] that's in the body of believers that's
[1:41:56] in us right now is what he's saying he
[1:41:57] said this in 1961 and it's still here
[1:42:00] he says and that law he says it's
[1:42:03] controlled by a law so this is
[1:42:05] collectively he says there's power in
[1:42:07] the church now you say john we're
[1:42:08] talking about the overcomers why are we
[1:42:10] talking about gifts and body unification
[1:42:12] these different things because what
[1:42:13] there's a power when we are together
[1:42:15] that is greater than when we are
[1:42:17] individuals and then we've got to be
[1:42:19] able to work together on some of these
[1:42:20] things we aren't going to achieve it on
[1:42:22] our own so if you want to be an
[1:42:23] overcomer and do about without your
[1:42:24] neighbor next to you it's not going to
[1:42:26] happen you look at the natural when the
[1:42:28] children of israel did they didn't do it
[1:42:29] all alone they had help right they had
[1:42:31] their neighbors helping them they had
[1:42:33] they had the neighboring tribes there
[1:42:35] what keeping the place clean keeping
[1:42:36] enemies out we've got to work together
[1:42:38] on this and that's why i'm focused so
[1:42:39] much i believe on this is because
[1:42:41] there's some things we're going to
[1:42:42] overcome as a group and there's some
[1:42:43] things we're going to overcome as an
[1:42:44] individual
[1:42:45] amen he says that's what power is in the
[1:42:47] church now but it is controlled by a law
[1:42:49] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:42:51] commandments
[1:42:53] it's a law of faith jesus said all
[1:42:55] things are possible to them that believe
[1:42:58] and if you can believe it
[1:43:00] listen what he says and if you can
[1:43:02] believe it whatever god will lead your
[1:43:05] soul to believe
[1:43:06] that is yours
[1:43:08] you say that's crazy what that brother's
[1:43:10] believing if the lord led him to believe
[1:43:12] it hallelujah it's going to happen that
[1:43:14] sister is nuts what is she thinking
[1:43:16] that's going to happen for the holy
[1:43:18] spirit has led her to believe it and so
[1:43:20] it's going to happen
[1:43:22] if you can believe it and it's the holy
[1:43:23] spirit quickening it to you he says what
[1:43:26] that is yours not you might have it or
[1:43:29] you should get it he says that is yours
[1:43:32] personal possession amen so when he
[1:43:35] drops down into our hearts and he leads
[1:43:37] us to believe for the supernatural why
[1:43:39] would we think that anything other than
[1:43:41] a supernatural god is going to fulfill
[1:43:42] it
[1:43:43] why would we believe in the supernatural
[1:43:45] if there wasn't a god that was going to
[1:43:47] fulfill it he dropped supernatural
[1:43:48] thoughts into our human hearts so that
[1:43:50] he can show himself to be god amen
[1:43:53] every place the souls of your foot can
[1:43:55] sit upon by faith god gives it to you
[1:43:58] amen it's yours you possess it if you
[1:44:01] can find the key to this law of faith
[1:44:03] that opens it to you he says you see
[1:44:05] what i mean
[1:44:06] that power is controlled by if you are a
[1:44:09] son of god you are a daughter of god
[1:44:11] that never leaves you it's with you all
[1:44:14] the time but your faith gets away from
[1:44:18] it but it's still there he says
[1:44:19] hallelujah what you may step away from
[1:44:22] it but it doesn't step away from you
[1:44:23] it's always available he says when you
[1:44:25] are saved god gives you faith to rise
[1:44:28] from the muck of the earth amen
[1:44:30] he says your faith overcomes the things
[1:44:32] of the world what is your faith your
[1:44:35] faith in that act that god has done in
[1:44:37] you to make you a son of god you quit
[1:44:39] your line you quit your stealing you
[1:44:41] quit your drinking because your faith
[1:44:44] rises above it amen if you don't do it
[1:44:46] you don't have any faith
[1:44:48] he says what and by faith are you saved
[1:44:50] and that through grace
[1:44:52] as much as your faith will be released
[1:44:55] that's how much power you can have
[1:44:57] so the only limit here is our faith
[1:44:59] which means that the only limit then is
[1:45:01] what god will reveal to be his will
[1:45:04] because if you see that as god's will
[1:45:05] then your faith will rise to the
[1:45:07] occasion and you can have what you will
[1:45:09] because it's not what you will now but
[1:45:10] it's him that put the will inside of you
[1:45:12] in the first place he says as much as
[1:45:14] your faith will be released that's how
[1:45:16] much power you can have because in you
[1:45:19] dwells the power to make heavens and
[1:45:21] earth
[1:45:22] god dwells in you and you are sons and
[1:45:25] daughters of god amen there you are but
[1:45:27] it's your faith jesus said according to
[1:45:30] your faith be it unto you if thou canst
[1:45:32] believe all things are possible verily i
[1:45:35] say unto you if you say unto this
[1:45:37] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[1:45:39] believe what you have
[1:45:41] said
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:43] he says then what kind of people are we
[1:45:46] to be having faith in this great
[1:45:48] redeeming christ that lives in us this
[1:45:51] smitten rock that never leaves the
[1:45:54] church amen the never failing presence
[1:45:56] of jesus christ not in our midst only
[1:45:59] but in our lives
[1:46:01] in your life because he says what you
[1:46:03] have the holy spirit inside of you he is
[1:46:05] ever present inside of you he says what
[1:46:08] kind of people are we to be
[1:46:10] he says that smitten rock never leaves
[1:46:12] the church i am with you always even to
[1:46:14] the end of the world the ever presence
[1:46:17] of the great gusher

[1:46:22] a gusher in the oil field do you know
[1:46:24] what it looks like uncontrollable
[1:46:27] pressure
[1:46:28] uncontrollable power they can put the
[1:46:30] biggest valve they want on it and it
[1:46:32] blows through the valve and it shoots at
[1:46:33] 150 feet up in the air and covers their
[1:46:35] equipment in oil it's a gusher it's a
[1:46:38] pressure that cannot be contained that's
[1:46:40] what's inside of you he says the ever
[1:46:42] presence
[1:46:44] it never relieves
[1:46:46] that's what he's saying it never dies
[1:46:47] down it never loses its power the ever
[1:46:50] presence of the great gusher of
[1:46:52] salvation
[1:46:54] and power that poured forth from calvary
[1:46:57] into the church the ever presence of the
[1:46:59] living god the great flowing smitten
[1:47:02] rock that goes with us in our journey
[1:47:05] you read that call and you say what
[1:47:06] could ever hold us back why aren't we in
[1:47:09] a rapture why aren't every one of us
[1:47:11] healed why aren't all of us lovable now
[1:47:15] slipped that one in didn't i
[1:47:18] amen what's holding us
[1:47:20] back let me add fuel to the fire
[1:47:24] and then we'll close
[1:47:26] we'll set you on fire till the next
[1:47:28] service amen
[1:47:30] brother says this now let me tell you
[1:47:32] something each man
[1:47:34] and woman
[1:47:35] that's born again with the spirit of god
[1:47:38] in him is a miniature creator
[1:47:42] now that might shake you a little bit
[1:47:43] but that's the truth
[1:47:46] do you know you're a creator brother
[1:47:47] david
[1:47:54] do you know you're a creator
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:47:59] he says you are
[1:48:01] he says you're a creator every man and
[1:48:04] every woman that's born again with the
[1:48:06] spirit of god in him is a miniature
[1:48:08] creator
[1:48:10] amen that means we've got power
[1:48:13] and he doesn't give power without a way
[1:48:15] to use it
[1:48:16] doesn't give power for no reason
[1:48:18] right god doesn't give it to us to show
[1:48:20] off he does it for what to allow us to
[1:48:22] achieve the purpose that he has for our
[1:48:24] lives he says now that might shake you a
[1:48:26] little bit but that's the truth we're in
[1:48:28] the image of god and god is a creator
[1:48:31] that's the reason that you can believe
[1:48:33] that god could heal a person is because
[1:48:35] god is in you and god made this world
[1:48:38] he just spoke it and his word became
[1:48:41] material the very ground that you're
[1:48:43] sitting on is the word of god made
[1:48:46] manifest that that that shook me when i
[1:48:49] read that amen that shakes me when we
[1:48:51] say the very thing we're standing on
[1:48:53] here literally is the word of god he's
[1:48:56] not talking about this in this way he
[1:48:58] says the very thing you're standing on
[1:49:00] is the word of god made manifest what's
[1:49:02] he saying is that the word of god always
[1:49:04] becomes a reality amen it doesn't leave
[1:49:07] his word his mouth and come back void
[1:49:09] but it goes out and it accomplishes that
[1:49:11] which he has sent it forth to do it
[1:49:13] becomes a reality it comes into
[1:49:15] existence
[1:49:17] where something before was chaos and
[1:49:19] confusion amen where it was in a fallen
[1:49:21] state whatever it might be the word of
[1:49:22] god comes forth into something that we
[1:49:24] can stand on amen
[1:49:26] he says he just spoke it and his word
[1:49:28] became material the very ground you're
[1:49:30] setting on is the word of god may
[1:49:31] manifest if he didn't where does he get
[1:49:34] it see he just spoke it and it turned
[1:49:37] into existence
[1:49:39] it turned into existence from nothing
[1:49:41] became something he believed in his own
[1:49:44] word and if a man
[1:49:47] last one brother visual and if a man's
[1:49:49] born of the spirit of god he's an
[1:49:51] offspring of god and that part of god is
[1:49:54] in him and he believes every word that
[1:49:56] god says will materialize see and so
[1:50:00] that makes him part of god
[1:50:05] that makes you part of god if you have
[1:50:07] the holy spirit he says the holy spirit
[1:50:10] in the man makes him a part
[1:50:13] of god
[1:50:14] amen let's stand to our feet if we will
[1:50:18] the holy spirit in the man the holy
[1:50:20] spirit in the woman
[1:50:21] makes her
[1:50:23] a part of god amen
[1:50:24] what a powerful thing to believe
[1:50:27] amen
[1:50:28] not just
[1:50:29] affiliated with him
[1:50:31] you know not just some sort of a
[1:50:33] relationship but this makes you a part
[1:50:36] of god that you can identify yourself
[1:50:38] with the great jehovah god amen what a
[1:50:41] place he's put us in this is what we're
[1:50:43] talking about now miniature creators
[1:50:46] that's what these gifts are doing is
[1:50:47] what you're doing is you're bringing
[1:50:48] forth what the word you're manifesting
[1:50:51] the word you're manifesting the will of
[1:50:53] god and what brother brown is pointing
[1:50:54] us back and saying is look if he puts
[1:50:56] the holy spirit in you he's got you here
[1:50:58] for a purpose he's got you here to do
[1:50:59] something and it's going to be to
[1:51:01] manifest the word and sometimes it's to
[1:51:02] manifest it in somebody else and
[1:51:04] sometimes it's to manifest it in you but
[1:51:06] you're there to help every single one of
[1:51:08] us bring out what god has placed inside
[1:51:10] of our lives amen amen let's just bow
