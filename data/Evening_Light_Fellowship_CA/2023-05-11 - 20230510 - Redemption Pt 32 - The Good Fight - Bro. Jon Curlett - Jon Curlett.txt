God bless you thank you musicians if you would turn to First Timothy chapter one First Timothy chapter one we'll start at verse 18. certainly want to give thanks to everyone that kind of made the services this weekend to success and you know it's uh it's one thing to come in and enjoy it but there's a lot of work went into that week especially beforehand mother Matt was here with the trustees and wiring things and putting up the new TVs and screens and whatnot and I know the trustees were here touching off this and that and their spouses as well amen so everyone was doing it and then we had sister Priscilla and Blanca preparing the children and the the specials and these different things and then the sisters with the food and whatnot so it's it's a body effort and it's a body effort and I'm so thankful for each one that put their shoulder to the wheel Amen brother Dwayne and sister Connie got back about 4 a.m last night with an uneventful trip quick trip relatively speaking so you he's back in the saddle there but he said share his love and appreciation to the people and he certainly enjoyed himself and he's looking forward to coming back again sometime remember the Kingsley is also traveling to Nigeria today he was kind of getting things set in order this weekend so he could fly back to spend some time with his wife and deal with some things over there so we want to remember him in prayer as well and of course it doesn't look like brother Gerald's sister Betty are here so certainly she's especially on our hearts and Minds this evening and into tomorrow so let's be praying for them amen certainly appreciate the services amen I thought it was just absolutely Supernatural in so many ways for for me and the different needs and the body and talking to different ones afterwards and they said that was me he was talking to there you know and that I was praying about that and I was struggling with that and I was wondering about that and and whatnot so I just thought it was absolutely tremendous amen amen you can you can have a service where it's all you know It's Shouting and it's praise and it's worship and then sometimes it's just that still Small Voice just speaking to you and it's all God it's all God sometimes he's in the Thunder and the lightning and the smoke and the fire and other times he's just like I talked about he's just sitting next to you in the pew just saying hello daughter hello son we got some things to talk about him and so I certainly appreciated that and appreciate it brother Dwayne coming in on his 36th wedding anniversary and putting his shoulder to the wheel like that so God bless him amen First Timothy chapter 1 verse 18. it says Paul speaking to Timothy he says this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as War a good Warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're back to our Redemption series and we're building up to this idea of adoption and I know we say we're going to get there and it seems like every service I want to get there and something else kind of drops in so I want to set a bit of a picture before we go into adoption and for a title tonight I just want to preach on the good fight and then the good fight and when we last preached on Redemption many weeks ago it feels like we stopped right after the children of Israel had crossed over and they've been circumcised and these different things and they were preparing to go in and they were preparing to go in and take possession and they were going in with a lot of knowledge if you think about it they'd spent 40 years hearing about it and hearing the testimonies of of the ones that had gone in and been close to it and had actually seen it and all these different things but they're going in with knowledge but not a lot of experience they weren't going in as as seasoned Warriors or anything like that they they had an idea of what they were facing but they didn't have a reality of what they were going to be facing and and so I want to take this idea of the good fight because when we're going into battle we we have to have something more than just knowledge and then we got to have something greater than knowledge and certainly the greatest thing we can have is revelation amen but but but you've got to go in prepared and you've got to go in ready for the fight and you've got to make sure you're fighting the good fight you've got to make sure you're fighting the right fight that you're focusing your energy and you're pointing the sword at the right thing if I could put it that way and that that what's in your heart to get is going to be in line with what God Said So I've read the scripture before but it's used in so many ways in this Redemption series but God said to Moses he said and I have said I will bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites onto a land flowing with milk and honey and we've talked about this before how it's a land of promise and it's a land full of promise but it's also a land full of enemies it's a land full of people that don't like you it's a land full of of people that don't want you there a land full of people that want to kill you and yet it is still the land of promise Amen to what's on it is not reflective of what it's meant for and so often we get stuck on what's guarding it rather than what is what's in it for us you know and you have to be able to see beyond those things and just because something has it right now doesn't mean that it's not yours to take if God said it's yours then it's yours amen and that we've got to get our Direction though from the word so that we're fighting for the things that to belong to us amen and if you look at something like this and and you look down that list and you've got Canaanites and Hittites and amorites and parasites and headlights and jebusites you got you got six nations in there and if you focus on what's waiting for you you're going to struggle if you focus on what's on the other side of what's of what's holding on to your promise right now of what's on your property of what's what what Satan has laid in your path to keep you from getting what you're going to get you're going to struggle because your focus is on what's waiting for you rather than what is promised to you amen what belongs to you if you're focused on the enemy then you're going to get into trouble every single time but you have to realize this is that he said I will bring you up I'll bring you to the land what he was saying is I'll bring you to the fight so if you're in the fight of his leading and not your own you can have confidence amen you don't have to wonder about the outcome you don't have to worry about what's going to happen if he has led you to the place of battle then you can have confidence that you're going to go through no matter what comes against you amen but if you come of your own choosing if you come of your own time if you come of your own way you're going to fail because remember God tried to get them to go into Canaan and they refused and then he pronounced judgment on them and they said well now we're going to go in now that you pronounce judgment we're going to go and we're going to take the the land and what happened is they went in and a bunch of them died because God wasn't with them they refused his time they refused his season they refused his word and then they tried to do themselves and they all died they picked a fight now of their own choosing and God said don't go in there it'll be dead it'll be horrible for you and they went in your but God is saying here I'm going to bring you to a place full of people that want to kill you and it's my will that you go in and it's my will that you fight and it's my will that you overcome as well amen there's going to be a battle but it's my will you've waited over 400 years closer to 500 years to get here and it doesn't look like it's much of a Promised Land but believe me when I'm done with you you're going to be the Overcomer and you're going to have everything that I promised you inside of that land amen in Exodus 23 says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared you know what I read when I see that there's no excuse not to get there the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud went in front of them every day and as long as they stayed with the pillar of fire as long as they stay with the pillow Cloud then they were going to be okay and they could have confidence no matter what they were facing or where they were being led whether it was a dry place a well-watered place lots of grass no grass whatever it was lots of enemies no enemies it did not matter as long as they were following that pillar of cloud that pillar fired then they knew they were in God's will verse 21 says beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries that's why I said if you're in a fight of your own making you need to back out because he said if I take you there then I'll be with you but if you go of your own choosing your own way you're in a fight of your own making guess what God can't help you he'll take you out he'll preserve you but you won't win a battle that you're in of your own choosing you make a bad decision you make a wrong decision you go against the word of God and you get into a fight guess what God's not there to give you the victory God's there at best to preserve your life not your dignity not your reputation he'll preserve your life because you're a son and daughter of God look what happened with Abraham the the two times that he went into the land of the Philistines and these different things and the King saw in garage and whatnot and he did not give Abraham a victory there but he preserved his life he kept his promise he kept the vessels of his promise through it all but Abraham didn't go in and get a victory in fact he really annoyed them Abraham lost face Abraham lost reputation when he went someplace of his own choosing God protected him but God did not give him a victory there amen we've got to find the will of God and that's what gives us confidence Faith gives us faith is really what it is he gives us confidence in his faith that we're walking where he wants us to be verse 23 says for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off listen it's not us that does the winning it's not us that wins the battle but we're going to be in the battle but he says I'm the one that's going to do the work it's going to look like you're doing it but I'm the one that's going to cut them off I am going to completely obliterate them from the face of this Earth it will be as if they never existed in the first place but it's going to look an awful lot like battle to you when you're in these things he says I will cut them off I'll cut them off listen we can focus on on what we choose to this evening we can focus on the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and it'll tear our faith down and it'll make us wimps or we can focus focus on where God said and I will cut them off amen that I'm in it that I'm with you and I'm going to take you through I'd rather focus on that than on the six kingdoms before me on the things that are laying in front of me the enemies that want to take my life what a Revival it would be if we'd focus on what God said he was going to do rather than what Satan has laid before us Amen Let us look to the promise let us hold fast to what God said he would do in these situations he said I will send my fear before thee not a fear of you they might think they're scared of you but he says it's my fear that goes before me I'm going to put something in their heart that's going to win The Battle Before you ever get there they're going to be scared of you before you even cross swords before you ever throw a spear before you ever walk up to the gates they're going to be scared and the battles won when the enemy is scared if you have no confidence in yourself then the other person wins no matter how weak they are because you're not going to think you can fight and you'll fight like you think you'll fight like you believe and if you don't think you can win you'll never win but he says I'm going to send my fear before you and I'm gonna I'm going to destroy all the people to whom thou shall come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs into these things unto thee in that church when things start to break apart in front of us don't think it's because of us you know we I remember we had that old movie The Bear I think it was called or something it's a little little bear company standing there and there's a cougar coming towards him over the river and he opens his mouth and he's gonna he's Gonna Roar and this great Roar comes out and the cougar turns and runs away and the Bears all proud of himself and then the camera pans and behind him is the Big Mama Bear the big papa bear that really made the sound that's what's happening in these situations is they might flee from before us but it's Papa God that's behind us that's producing the results amen amen we do not strive we do not put our faith in the arm of Flesh amen but we look to the god that has anointed us to do these things amen if we win when we win when we win not if we win when we win it's because God has gone before us and he has put fear and he's driven them out and he's the one that has destroyed what's going on in them amen listen perfect love casts out our fear and it goes ahead of us and puts it into those that would hold us back amen what is it he's telling us don't worry son don't worry daughter I brought you here and I'm going to bring you through this amen I'll take you through if you only knew how scared Satan is that you'll find out who you are you'd have a whole lot more courage tonight you'd have a lot more faith tonight your Revelation would come to a new level because he's scared brother Brown said that the weakest Christian when he falls to his knees all of Satan all of hell trembles that's how powerful you are when you go to the god that can put fear Into the Heart of the enemy amen he says and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the himite the Canaanite the hittite from before thee but he says I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the lamb become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee listen the reality of the promised land was Progressive they crossed Jordan they were in the land but to actually take possession and benefit from it did not happen overnight they entered in overnight they entered in one afternoon but to actually take possession of it and get the benefits of it was Progressive and God said bit by bit little by little I'm gonna drive them out you're going to come into possession just a little bit at a time he says because you've got to be able to hold on to what I've given you before you take the next bit otherwise it doesn't produce and you don't hold on to these things amen listen the Rapture is Progressive the Rapture is Progressive what's happening is God's doing what precept upon precept line upon line he's building up a church in The Most Holy Faith and he's building this up to the Apex which is a resurrection and a Rapture but if you're waiting for everything to happen until the Rapture you're going to miss the Rapture because it's little by little he's building us up into it he's giving us the promise and that's why we had a prophet coming to say not just to open the word but to show us what it looks like to possess it to be a part of it and it was that Divine Healing it was that discernment it was that Holy Ghost leadership it was overcoming power it was the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God all of that combined is what brings us to a rapturing point the last step is what death where uh death was a nice thing grave where's thy victory in these things that's the last thing we're going to face but until then we're getting little Victory and then bigger victories and bigger victories and one thing tumbles and falls and then the next thing does and the next thing does we're not just gonna maybe one day we're going to be just an a good for nothing loud and the next day where the manifested sons of God he's training us and he's growing us and he's building us bit by bit you know don't don't look down on the day of the Small Things the little victories the little Revelations the little things that God does in our life because they're building a big picture they're building you into a son and daughter of God Amen but overcoming power is there all along overcoming Powers all along whether you're going around Jericho which had never been taken or whether you're in these little towns that are just surrounded by a bit of sticks all of it is overcoming powers given to you if God's leading you through these things amen we spoke in the in the last service on this this idea of expectation in the land of the living and now the word of of God is promises for Here and Now there's very little we know about what's going to happen on the other side when we're an attorney we don't know a whole lot it's it's just generally descriptive but most of it is focused on what we're facing here and what we're going through life here and sometimes we we want to see God and we say well if God's going to take me somewhere it's going to be Supernatural and it is this is a supernatural walk listen I don't know if the prophet said it but I've heard it many times he says we are a supernatural people having a natural experience we're a supernatural people we are the children of a supernatural God and we look and and we say that if God is with us everything must appear Supernatural is what we're really saying and sometimes it is you look at you know Blanca with her gallbladder trouble and that went away in a moment that was literally Supernatural in the way that we expect and Selena with their lactose intolerance in these things but then there are you we see somebody that maybe slowly recovers from something and we say well that's just natural no the scripture says I'm the Lord God that healeth all thy diseases listen it's still Supernatural otherwise you go into the hospital two people one comes out with the exact same technology or medical science applied against them and they live and the other person has the same thing and they die why because they can't heal you they can just take out what's wrong with you but it takes God to move in these things and so what happens is we look at something that appears natural but if you can find the promise in the word it's the supernatural that's going on in your life amen what am I trying to get at when you look at what it looks like to take possession of the promised land practically speaking it looks a lot like you fighting it looks a lot like you doing work you know they have that saying that luck looks an awful lot like hard work why because you're making your own opportunities you're developing an opportunity because you're working hard not because there's luck there amen and listen they went into the into the promised land and God gave them Jericho and Jericho was a hundred percent Supernatural in the way we would expect the supernatural they walked around it for days and days and days they didn't blow trumpets they didn't shout they didn't do anything they didn't try and knock down the walls and yet on the last day they walked around seven times finally started shouting and blowing trumpets and the whole thing fell down created ramps that they could run up over the walls and they took it in just an afternoon completely Supernatural and every single city after that was done the old-fashioned way the first one was Supernatural and everybody watching them after that would have said where did God go after that the walls didn't fall down they didn't blow trumpets and get victories they just went into hand-to-hand combat for every city after that as far as We Know where's the supernatural in that The Supernaturals that they didn't lose a man except the next one after Jericho because what happened in Jericho if you remember was somebody got out of line and disobeyed God and that's what caused them to fail because Joshua presumed that they would just have Victory instead of following the leadership of God as to which city was to be next because if he would have went to God and asked him God would have said you can't fight until the camp gets cleaned up but he didn't inquire and so they went and they went to I call it AI maybe it's pronounced I I don't know it's a AI is how it's spelled but they go there and they lose 36 men because one man got his eyes off the promise and he took something that belonged to God because God said with Jericho he says this place is mine and nobody's allowed to touch it this is my victory I'm showing it I'm showing you what I can do he says and nobody can take a victory from this this is a it's a commemoration to God basically was what he was talking about he said you can't take anything what happened was Aiken went in there and he saw the the wedge of gold and the silver and the Babylonian garment church he had a city waiting for him he had a land waiting for him he had a farm waiting for him he had a house waiting for him he had all the wealth that he could ever expect and want in life and his little short-term sight got him into trouble if he would have held on to the end he'd have had way more than a wedge of gold and a wedge of silver and a Babylonian garment but it's The Human Condition to what look at the short term and say I'm going to make a decision for that rather than look at the big picture what to trust God and do it the way that he said instead of the other way amen but listen after Jericho as I said every single battle was fought the old-fashioned way and they never lost the person and that's what was Supernatural but you could get caught up in the carnality and say where is God I'm the one that's Swinging The Sword I'm the one that's getting sweaty I'm the one that's buckling on the armor I'm the one that's got to stay there for days and months and put a Siege around the city and do all this hard work where is God in it listen they weren't soldiers and they were defeating all of the soldiers that came against them they weren't up they were War they weren't Warriors and they were up against train Warriors they didn't have all the the instruments and weapons of war but yet somehow they kept winning that's what made it Supernatural if they if we'd only stop and say sometimes the reason I'm winning is not because I'm good at it listen we are not ourselves Warriors the way Satan has trained his we don't go into those things but we go in by what faith trusting that God will take us through to the other side because we can get caught up in the idea that we're fighting and we're striving and we're pushing and we're saying where's the supernatural the Supernatural is here because you're still alive you have a sound mind you still have a heart to serve God you have something that keeps you going day in and day out when so many people will fall away and we see people the following not after five years not after ten years after 30 and 40 years sometimes they fall away because they get tired of the fighting and they don't realize that God was with them through it all keeping them alive amen you're not alive because you're good you're alive because he said there had to be an overcomer you're alive because he said this is the land that I've given you and I brought you in to take it that's why we're alive it's his grace that does it not our skill but he is looking for Faith he is looking to people that will step into it and say that I'll take this Lord I'll be a part of the battle I'll be a part of the struggle I'll get sweaty I'll get my hands dirty I'll pick up a sword and do something about it amen listen if you've got a sound mind today that is Supernatural because everybody else is having their conscience here with a hot iron that they will believe a lie and be damned by it the fact that we come in day in and day out and we've got a heart that keeps seeking the things of God that looks for greater relationship that surrenders and puts aside the things that this world offers that in of itself is the supernatural working in our lives day in and day out you young people listen if that's what you've got you've got God in your life that's what it looks like brother Brown would say this he said that's what the matter with people tonight in Divine Healing and everything it's yours go take it Hallelujah God promised you to walk Brethren you believe it you have to take it God promised you life brother do you believe it he says take it God promised you Joy brother do you believe it take it God said I will give it to you it's yours that we wouldn't be right for God to go and Dish all the things out he give them the land but they've got to do the house cleaning he says Amen in other words you've got a job to do you've got a place you've got a position you've got a purpose you've got something to put your energy into you got something to put your time into you've got something to put your focus into and it's cleaning out what God has said is yours he says it's yours but he ain't going to come poke it down your neck you've got to take the land yourself not yourself and I won't be with you but I'm going to go with you but you're gonna have to do some work in this he's given it to you and it's yours rise and possess it Hallelujah and he says this it's your choice you've got to choose you have to step willingly into the battle he says if you want a murmur like the other 10 did you'll wander in the wilderness a long time longer till tomorrow night still sick but if you're ready to take it tonight it's yours what kind of a choice are you going to make he says I will take Jesus and his promise and tell the Devil he's a liar amen what is the good fight the good fight is fighting for what God Said is yours going in and saying we are more than able to take it we are more than able to possess it I don't care how big it looks I don't care how many of them are how well trained they are we are more than able I love how he talked about Caleb and he says you know Caleb's portion this weekend Caleb had a different Spirit we've got a different Spirit Church we've got a different spirit that tells us I'm willing to go in and we willingly choose to step into battle for what belongs to us amen listen we don't preach a Prosperity Gospel I'm not talking about going in and fighting for your money and fighting no no we have a promise of healing we have a promise for salvation we have a promise for the infilling of the Holy Ghost we have a promise where two or three are gathered in his name I'll be in your midst we have a promise for our Resurrection we have a promise for a rapture we have a promise for the Salvation of our families that's the good fight amen not to have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank or a house paid off but to what see your loved ones on the other side and to see the promises of God manifested in the body of Christ around us that's what we're fighting for amen and not just for myself but for my brothers and sisters that are all around us each one listen there's a promise of an overcomer I want to fight for that amen I want to Pro I want the promise that that I'm going to overcome in this age I've read this quote before and I keep coming back to it he says Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they come out of the Wilderness is where there were a Sanctified called out Church Canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit because they still have wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the Holy Spirit once what are you doing what do you do in Canaan they were possessing their rights their rights not rights because they said it not rights because they believe it but because God said that's yours What God Says is yours that's what you have a right to this evening amen Glory says they were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights until they got into Canaan they don't own nothing in the wilderness then when they come into Canaan then when they come into Canaan then they had rights and we've got rights when you receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan but you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it he says yes sir I've said it before I'll say it again we're in a battle Church if you're not feeling the effects brother Dwayne was telling me and he says it seems like we're either coming out of one we're in one or we're going into another one it just seems constant it's one thing or another and if it's not for us it's for the person next to us it's for our brother and sister whether it's Health whether it's relationships whether it's our children Church issues whatever it might be it is a constant battle right now and the battle sometimes is what will you focus on what are you going to just commit to God and say God that's yours and then the other one say but you put me here to battle for this they couldn't knock Jericho's walls down but they could run up once he knocked them down amen there's a portion that's for God and then there's a portion that's for us to do amen every day it's a battle for our time for our mind for our eyes for our affections for our Focus for even our emotions and how we're going to use up that our physical strength all of these things everything is a battle what are you going to do what are you going to fight for how are you going to do all these things amen and it's exhausting it's exhausting to be a Christian so many times because every gun in hell is trained at us every gun in hell is trained at us but listen God says you've got to mature and that means you've got to go through battles and you've got to learn that there's victory in the battles and that's where your Victory is is in the battles it's not in always dodging or getting around it but you've got to go through the battle sometimes and come out the other side and realize God's with me amen but listen he said bit by bit he's going to do it you know what Pride makes us want to accelerate because it says I've got this but humility sits back and says in your time lord we'll move in your time Lord oh it's taken three months to knock this city down in your time Lord I'm staying right here I'm not moving I'm in the battle I'm going to stay I'm gonna fight the good fight until it falls because you led me here which means if you let me here something's got to give and it's not going to be me hey man let's have some endurance let's have some courage let's have some staying power amen as we fight through this life I want to take us back to our original scripture to just highlight something before we move on and Paul said to Timothy this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as War a good Warfare holding faith in a good conscience with some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck Paul was saying to Timothy Timothy you're not just anybody how many of us would love to have two two books of the Bible written about us church we got 66 books of the Bible written about us he's telling Timothy he says Timothy you were hand-picked by God you've been prophesied over you're supposed to be a preacher among preachers you're supposed to be a leading evangelist you're supposed to be a leading Pastor you are going to be one of the greatest ministers here and he says it's based on what's been said over you there's been a word from the Lord that's been given over you there's a prophecy over you Timothy and you've got to fight the fight that takes you into the Fulfillment of that prophecy Church we've had prophecy after prophecy over us whether it's that we're going to be Overcomers whether it's that we're going to be healed whether it's that we're going to get the Holy Ghost whether it's that we're going to go in a Rapture whatever it is we've been told we're going to overcome and our fight is to stay in the channel of overcoming and to hold to those things which cause us to overcome rather than to get distracted by everything else that Satan throws our way amen that we pick the battle that leads us into God and eternal life and ignore all those other things that we put the blinders of the word on us and stay on the straight and narrow and not get sucked to the right not get sucked to the left not get distracted not get depressed by these things that comes our way amen but to hold fast and to stick with the things that God has said are ours that's our good Warfare if we'll focus on what he has for us we'll be fighting for the right things we'll be in the right place at the right place right time doing the right thing saying the right things acting the right way that's our good Warfare is to get in line with what God has said about us and fight to stay with that amen that's what he was trying to get Timothy to do he says Timothy you've got a prophecy in your life but you've got to make a choice to get in line you've got to make a choice to be where God needs you to be you've got to make a choice for the things that God has for you and that's where your battle is going to be a good battle notice he says War a good Warfare that means it's possible to war a bad Warfare you can be fighting the wrong things you can be dealing with the wrong issues you can be burning yourself out on things that have nothing to do with God's purpose and plan for you absolutely listen you make a bad decision Satan will run you ragged trying to get you to win a battle that he knows is on his own land listen we don't go into bars none of us would go into a bar willingly but we'll go into a bar in other areas of our life areas where no Christian has a right to be and then when something comes up and an issue comes up and we get in trouble and it's the result of our decision we'll sit there and we'll get obstinate and we'll fight and we'll fight and we'll fight instead of backing out and saying I'm going back to where God told me to be fight the good fight don't fight the bad fight like I said before if you made the wrong decision it made you wrong get out of it and get back to where God wants you to be because he's not going to give you the way the victory but he'll save your life but you're going to pay a price for it brother Duane read it it was in my notes and I had to take it out where he said that Abraham he says he went over there and he says God preserved Abraham but he made him repent Abraham had to say he was sorry Abraham had to recognize I messed up and then God comes around he takes him out of these things amen he says you've got to war a good Warfare you got to fight a good fight Timothy fight for the right things fight to stay in line with what the prophecy said fight to stay in line with the promise of God for your life fight to stay in tune with what God has spoken for you that's what we're trying to do we're trying to catch the voice we've had a voice we've had a seventh age messenger a prophet coming this day and tell us and that's what we need to be focused on is what he told us to do and then the holy spirit in our life ought to be confirming that into our lives day by day that we ought not to just have to turn the tape on to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit but it ought to be in our lives for our own personal situations leading us and guiding us day by day what does it look like to war the good Warfare to fight the good fight verse 19 says hold Faith holding the faith stick to what's been proven stick to what's true stick to what God has said stay there and don't move from it no matter what happens remember the scripture says having done all to stand stand stay there don't back up hold fast to that which you've laid hold of amen and then he says what trust that's what he means is trust God absolutely hold by faith say Lord I'm trusting you and I'm going to stick with your word then he says what having a good conscience what's he saying keep your conscience clear like I said when we make mistakes admit it back up to where we left the word back up to where we left God and then continue on from there listen Brothers we've got to keep our conscience clear and it's not just for us but it's for our household amen as for our families we've got to be able to go before God with a clear conscience and say Lord my house is clean my life is clean listen when you've got to pray you don't want to have to go back and make something right that you've been letting go in your life for the last few weeks or months you want to keep your conscience clear you want to know that you're where God wants you to be that your house is pure that your family's pure that you're keeping your house clean from these things amen listen sisters you're not just a mother you are a weapon in the hand of almighty God when it comes to defeating what Satan would try putting your children's lives day to day you're not just a mother you're not just a wife you are a holy ghost-filled woman and just like a man you're a warrior of the faith and God has put you where you are for a specific purpose and it's to fight the good fight you have authority when God gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you Authority and that's to go against everything that Satan brings up against you and your family the father's there is the head of the household but Sisters You've Got as much power Before the Throne of God as your husband does Satan has to listen to you just like he has to listen to your husband and the father in the house amen you're a weapon in the hands of God Paul wrote to Timothy twice encouraging him he said my son Timothy son Timothy was like he wasn't just a mentor I believe he was like a father we never hear about Timothy's dad I often wonder if maybe he lost his father at an early age or something but he was like a a son to Paul and Paul was laboring to bring Timothy to the place where he could be what what he was supposed to be according to the prophecies Paul laid hands on Timothy yeah I assume he's the one that prophesied we don't know but he laid hands on Timothy and he ordained him to be a minister but he said Timothy you've got to work you've got to fight to come into this not fight to get it but fight to step into it to fight to step into what the character the nature to be what God has you to be but it's not just to go for the gift it's to go in and get the character that God needs you to have before he can really start running this gift because why Timothy can't make it by a gift he's got to make it by a life he's got to prove to the people that he's a he's a real believer that he's got the holy ghost that God can lead him and guide him before he's ever going to be an effective minister listen to what Paul said to him he said let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers because he wrote to Timothy and if you read the words but he's he kind of says Timothy don't don't back away don't don't let your foot off the gas keep pushing here keep fighting for this but he says the first thing you've got to do is be an example to the Believers in what word it matters what we say conversation that doesn't mean conversation the way we're talking means your manner of life in charity in spirit in faith and in Purity so he says listen you've got to fight to be an example first and then you'll be the preacher that was prophesied about later so he says let's let's focus on how you live let's hope focus on how you talk let's focus on how you put your shoulder to the wheel in love let's look at how you talk let's look at how you clean your life up and get that all in line and then the prophecies for the rest of your ministry will come true but Timothy you've got to fight for this first you gotta fight to be an example before you can be a leader in these things listen so often we we hear Brother Branham say Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but if you look in Hebrews 13 7 it says that we're supposed to look to the ministry and see if their lives are a reflection of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the standard for the ministry is do you reflect Christ in your life before you ever get behind that pulpit that's where you're supposed to judge me by and every other minister that steps behind that Pulpit is do you see Christ in me before you ever put me behind here to speak the words that's what he was saying to Timothy what was Timothy fighting for to get in the ministry ranks to get his own church to become a pastor no Timothy was fighting first to be an example to the Believers to have the kind of character that God could trust to be the kind of man the people would look at and say I can see God moving in his life and so I can accept the words that he's going to bring over that Pulpit amen his battle was to be in alignment with God's word first and then the prophecies would come later amen we talked about it before when we we spoke on on the uh the characteristics of a seduction and Timothy was facing conditions in people similar to what we have in laodicea because what we're facing today Paul said at the end times that's what's going to come and they came in the end time of that age and they came in the end time of this age amen and we talked about those different things and Paul Paul was trying to tell Timothy you got to be a solid Minister you got to be able to preach the full word and you got to be able to say it whether people want to hear it or not and whether they're receiving it or not and all of these different things but he said Timothy you got to be built up into that and you got a fight to be built up you got to focus your energy to fight to be growing and maturing and not just trying to get the position look at what this looks like this is Timothy this is Paul talking Timothy he says but godliness with contentment is great gain church if God would say that's a Godly Man Of Me that'll be enough if you can look at your life and say I know I'm a real believer that's about the most wonderful thing you can have and to be content with the idea that God would look at you and say my good and faithful servant I'm pleased you've done what I said you've acted the way I've acted you've talked the way I talked all of these things enter into the joy if God is content with your life that's where I want to find my contentment amen and then whatever happens in life whether the house is big or small I've had it I've had the rusted out cars and I've had the new cars I've had the big house and the small house I've had air conditioning no air conditioning I've had lots of money and not much money but in it all if I know that God's working with me that's where my contentment has to be amen he says for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we can carry nothing out but having food and Raymond let us be there with content the simple life is the life of the believer and then we don't seek these great things if we've got food and we've got clothes he doesn't even say a roof over your head says food and clothes that's all you really need maybe he didn't live in Newfoundland but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and Perdition anyone want to be rich I don't want to be rich after reading that they didn't start in hurtful lusts they didn't start in foolish lusts but it drowns them and it takes them into destruction and perdition Jesus said how hard it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven why because you get your eyes off of the word it's not a faith-building lifestyle if you have a lot of wealth that's for sure verse 10 says For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows he says but thou o man of God flee these things but I want you to notice something because sometimes we run and we don't run in the right direction sometimes you run from one problem into the next problem but he tells Timothy where to run he says flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness in other words he was saying fall in love with what God loves seek after the things that God wants to seek see in your life and that's where you're going to have the victory amen start seeking Godly character start seeking a Godly nature seek after the attributes that God's looking for and that's where you're going to get the Victory and that'll keep you out of the all of those foolish less that you've been chasing before and then he says fight the good fight of Faith this is where I took my scripture from for the for the title he says fight the good fight of Faith what does that look like brother John lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses that word lay whole means to seize it to hold on to it and don't let go don't get the idea wrong now you're not holding on to it because if you don't hold on to it you'll lose it see that's fear that's fear you're not holding on to it because if you don't hold on to it you'll lose it remember Paul says what it's yours you're called to it so it's always available to you but what do you do you're holding on to it not out of fear but because that's what matters most to you eternal life the kingdom of God and the things that are associated with it that's what matters to us most so that's where we ought to see our hands gripping and saying I Won't Let You Go I Won't Let You Go today I'm going to lay hold of eternal life and that's what I'm going to be fighting for that's what I'm going to be struggling for to lay hold of eternal life amen to walk one step closer to Eternity today amen it's not a fight to somehow make you a great warrior or achieve great things or anything but it's a fight for what God to express himself through you that's what eternal life is is it's God expressing himself through you here now that's what our fight is to what lay hold and fight for him to express himself through us that's what we're seeking for for Timothy it was going to be through preaching ultimately but we've got a a whole body of people here like I said with the meetings we just had that happen because we've got it people that are laying hold of their portion of what they're supposed to do here whether it's brother vaishal on the audio visual to the sisters that are helping to clean and cook and all these things lay hold on the things that God has for you to promote the kingdom of God let eternal life flow out of you in servanthood usually and watch what follows watch what follows you'll be amazed that that influence looks a lot like servanthood that leading looks an awful lot like serving that promotion looks an awful lot like humility remember Jesus said when you go in don't sit at the at the the the high table don't sit at the high chairs don't go to the the head of the table he says sit low and he says they'll call you up but he says it's really bad if you go up to the top and they say no you've got to move down you're not what you think you are we've got somebody that really deserves to be there amen Paul says you're in a good fight make sure it's tied to eternal life make sure it's tied to the things of God Amen Church were supposed to be in a good fight what have we been fighting lately what have you been fighting lately what's your struggle for is it something that that is attached to eternal life or is it something of your own choosing or making when I was studying this and and I read that that portion lay hold on eternal life it reminded me of Jacob when he was wrestling with the Lord and it says and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with them and he said let me go for the angel for the day break it this is the Angel of the Lord saying this and he and Jacob said he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he the angel of the Lord said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob I don't know if you remember when brother Ed hammermeister was here but I loved it when he brought out how Jacob had to admit that he was a shyster that he was a con man that he was a cheater because that's what Jacob means shyster and he had to say I'm a shyster before he could ever be changed into a prince having power with God he had to admit where he was at he had to admit what he was what name he was under he had to admit what his nature was before he could get the promise but in the meantime he didn't let his shyster nature keep him from laying hold of what he was guaranteed to get he was determined that even being a shyster he was going to get what God had promised to me man God had said I'm going to bless you I'll preserve you don't worry about it but Jacob got in a place where he says I gotta know that I know that I know that you're with me God and he would not let go though he touched the thigh he knocked it out of joint so that he was crippled though he was a shyster he said I'm not going to let you go until you give me the blessing amen Church don't let your current condition stop you from seeking what God has for you I loved and and I guarantee you I'm going to preach on it in more depth where brother Dwayne said he said you can't have Hebrews 11 until you have the the blood at the cross of calvary because you can read all about Abraham in the Book of Genesis and then when you go and you pass it through the blood of Christ you get Hebrews 11. you get a faith chapter listen when we're done we won't be called shysters we won't be called failures and and flawed people and all these different things we won't be called Liars or no no no through the blood it will be by faith Selena corlett by faith Brenda coffee by faith David Sharp by faith Jensen curlette by faith Joshua Colombo that's what he's going to see amen don't let what you're in right now don't let your current condition keep you from laying hold and say Lord I know there's more why because he promised it amen and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and men and with men and has prevailed he said Jacob you've overcome but did Jacob overcome by winning did Jacob win this wrestling match Jacob didn't win it you think you can be gone in a wrestling match can't even beat ourselves much less God but how did Jacob overcome he wouldn't let go he refused to let go of God until he got what God had promised your overcoming is when it comes to God is Not By beating him it's by saying I will not let you go until you give me what you promised that's a good fight that's Lane hold of eternal life that's taking hold of the word that's letting Faith do the talking in your in your relationship with God saying God I'm not moving remember brother Brown talks about that brother I forget his name now I've got the quote at home in my notes where he said that he he says I'm going to go out in that field and I'm going to stay there until I get the Holy Ghost he says and if I don't get the Holy Ghost they'll find a pile of bones someday he went out determined to get what eternal life he went up determined to get the Holy Ghost and he says I'm not coming back until I got it and guess what just like Jacob he wrestled until he got it he laid hold of the promise until God gave him the Holy Ghost and then he came back that's what we've got to do sometimes that's the good fight is stay there and hold on and say God you said it was for me and I'm here to get it it's his calling Paul said you're called to this you didn't come in here and make it up yourself you didn't make yourself into a child of God you didn't determine that you're worth it you didn't determine that you deserve it but he said you are called to do it and that's what allows us to come up and say I'm not letting go until you give it to me God Amen that's the good fight lay hold until you get it stay there don't move until he gives it to you amen what was Paul telling Timothy he was saying Timothy you're some of this you got to do yourself it's going to be up to you you're the one that's going to have to decide whether you're going to step in or whether you're going to stay out whether you're going to lay hold or whether you're going to let it go for another day for another person Timothy you're going to have to make a choice you're going to have to make a decision about what happens here listen we've got two roads ahead of us every single day we sang that song twice this weekend there are two roads you may take one by sight and one by faith and the good fight is faith faith faith faith faith day in and day out by Faith by Faith by faith and you're staying with the word of God every single day what am I saying pick your fight and pick the right fight because you're going to be offered fights every single day and one of them is going to be for ease of life and luxury and the goods of this world and and and and and short-term gain for long-term pain which he won't tell you about by the way of course but if you'll pick the right one that's where the supernatural Lays but it often looks a lot like a battle not just a walk in the park listen David said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil the Supernatural is that he could walk through that and fear no evil you never walk any place where there's a reason to be scared you're never going to experience the supernatural you've got to be put in a situation where you've got to recognize that God's the one that's taking me through all these things amen what's he saying he's saying you can pick to be a spectator or you can pick the the road that takes you into being a soldier because Satan will put you as a spectator all day long you can sit in church and be a spectator all day long you can read your Bible and do all these things and if you don't pick the Road of Faith you're just going to be a spectator but the RAM says this he says and that we know there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle listen to this now and they have the material on Earth right now to make themselves ready well he said God's going to have himself a bride without spot or wrinkle he says you're the one that has to put it on the scripture says the bride had made herself ready he says there if you notice it said she's made herself ready so many says well if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or for lying or stealing I'll serve him he says but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they didn't overcome he says you have power to do it you have power to overcome but you must be willing to wait lay it down lay what down that Spirit that's bothering you that habit that friendship that hindrance whatever it is he says you've got to be willing to lay it down so that overcoming can happen you've got to make a decision I want overcoming more than I want that thing that's bogging me down that habit that's been in my life for months or years or whatever the family tradition that I've had or the DNA that I've got whatever it is he says you've got to be willing to lay it down and that's what you've got to do he says see she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other end and then same blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through see this is where we get the balance in these things because we can sit there and say it's God it's God it's God but we'll get into her and he says but I've given you the sword you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God so the decisions we make to step into battle to step into a place that requires us to overcome is how we show faith and how we show respect to God in his word I was reading in James today where he says he says show me show me your Works without faith I'll show you my faith by my works and he says faith without works is dead The Works is the good fight The Works is the decisions you make to step willingly into a situation where you're going to have to trust the word of God to take you through in doing that he says we show our faith and respects to God Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain This Promise for 25 years the ups and downs that he had in Temptations in those 25 years but he held to the word of the promise that's the good fight and Israel was promised to Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that have I given you well listen if you just stand here you're not going to get anything you'll get where you're standing you walk over here he says that's yours you walk over here that's yours when we get the car when we can have the confidence of the Revelation that if we're walking in his will everywhere we step belongs to us I think we'd start running rather than walking uh it struck me when he was talking this weekend about David and Goliath he didn't mention it but it struck me that David did not stand and wait for Goliath to come to him the scripture says he ran towards Goliath he brought him into range of his weapon and then God killed him he ran towards him footsteps were possession he wasn't scared he was confident that victory was going to follow and all he had to do was get in range wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that have I given you God said to Joshua it was all there the lamb was there and God gave it to them but they must fight for it the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way you'll fight every inch of the way you say well brother John I'm fighting I don't feel like I got faith the fact that you're fighting proves that you got faith so keep fighting if you didn't have faith you wouldn't fight but you're fighting so hold on to that and say God I'm fighting because you told me to fight and I'm trusting that you're going to take me through and you're going to give me my healing god listen to this this is amazing he says God has got Amazing Grace to save you and we all say hallelujah praise the lord it's by Grace by Grace by grace and he says and he will do it hallelujah praise the Lord but you'll fight every inch of your way purified every inch of your way to get the grace that God has given you because every gun in hell is trained at you Satan is trying to turn his grace into disgrace he's trying to keep you from it what getting what God has given you of a free will offering but you're gonna have to fight to get it because it's surrounded by Giants it's surrounded by enemies it's surrounded by demons it's surrounded by habits it's surrounded by distractions you've got to fight a good fight to focus on where God wants you to and to take it for yourself he said I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has and he quotes the song but if we must fight if we must Reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready what does he say this looks like be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us we must lay aside ourself we can't say God you come and lay them aside for us we've got to do that ourselves what's our part to lay aside everything that holds us back and that's a battle isn't it it's a battle to lay down the things that you like that this flesh likes that this flesh craves that this world says are important it's tough to lay that down that's a battle to lay it down and then it's a battle after you lay it down to fill that hole to fill that Gap to fill that time with something that's going to benefit you in your walk with God it's a fight to lay it down then it's a fight to put the right thing in behind it you know I I spoke this weekend you know I said that you know it's so nice to come in and get scoured out in those type of services but the other thing is you want to get filled up too you can't just be empty because otherwise it's like the scripture says that the the spirit goes out of the house and he goes around and dry place then he comes back and he finds it all cleaned up and he brings seven more worse than him and the state of that man is worse than he was in the beginning you got to fill up what's been cleaned out you got to put something in there so the fight is to get it out and then the fight is to get the right thing in there so that you can move on so that you can possess the land and keep moving on and on and on and grow and mature in Christ into the stature of a perfect man amen every distraction every Temptation whatever it might be we've got to make a decision do I do what Satan wants by sight or do what God Says by faith every day all we're doing is making decisions and the more right decisions you make the heart of the battle is but the greater the victory is that's all we're doing every day every every every every time we spend as a Believer is a fight to make the right decision that's it and how many times you see in scripture they make one bad decision and it causes so much pain and so much hurt and so much sorrow and so much loss so much wasted time wasted effort that's where the grace comes in for us we're under our Grace Covenant now and so he just brings us back like he said about Abraham he didn't give him a victory but he made him repent didn't let him get away with it he made him repent but then he brought him right back into the promise anyways amen what are we willing to fight for what are we fighting for what have we been fighting for this week look back at this week and say and just just consider what have I been fighting for where has my struggle been where have I where have I applied my time where have I got what have I gotten stressed about even is it things of this world or is it things of the kingdom of God it's not that you can't be stressed with the things of this world as long as they're in the will of God but let all of our fights not be about things for this world and nothing for the kingdom of God either in other words what what's gotten us worked up lately maybe that's a better way of putting it what have we gotten worked up about really God you know really really twerked you know there's really you know what I'm not letting this one go what's the last time we said I'm not backing down anybody had an I'm not backing down moment lately one was it something of God that's what I'm asking was it a promise of God was it a direction God had given you or was it something where it was just our own obstinence that got us into that what are we fighting for today amen I spoke of shamgar the last service and and I think shamgar is kind of like the the poster child the spokesman for the good fight campaign and I ran across this quote we're nearly done here he says little shamgar looked and you know what he says I say this to you Holiness people his righteous indignation got up you know what I mean yes you know I seen a little sign one time I was walking into a football stadium to have a meeting there's a little sign up over the door that said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog he says that's right brother he says that's right brother if you let the devil run over you he will just show you what size he is in other words he'll make himself as big as you let him make himself you sit there and listen to Satan talk he'll make himself way bigger than he actually is I remember when I was a kid a long long time ago and they used to have Looney Tunes and if we were out with Dad or something we watched Looney Tunes on Saturday morning and there was one where it was uh Bugs Bunny was the principal of the school and whenever anybody went into the into the principal's office then then this this monstrous principle was yelling and screaming at them and nobody wanted to go in there but when what happened was one day a student wasn't wasn't cowed by that and so they saw a little room to the side and they went and they looked in and there was Bugs Bunny standing in front of a projector and he was projecting himself onto a massive screen so that it transformed Bugs Bunny who was whatever this tall into a 30-foot demon basically you know the the the the rabbit from hell and the projector the light of that projector was making him appear way bigger than he was and as soon as that student went around and saw that it was bug's bunny that was projecting himself into this monstrous demon he didn't care what he was doing he'd seen him for what he was so he didn't care if he was screaming at him they was yelling at him that he was all these different things because he knew it was just a little bunny wabbit nothing to be scared of that's what brother Brandon's seen don't let the devil tell you how big he is you tell him how little he is scripture says at the end we're going to look narrowly on him and say is this the man is this the one that did it really remember that today when you're in the battle you're gonna look at him and he's going to be a little short cracker about yay high probably skinny little twerp little pencil neck tiny little biceps sunken in chest and you're going to say that's it that's what we're fighting today but what he's trying to do is he's trying to talk a big talk so that you don't get in a fight with him in the first place he says if you let the devil run over you he'll show you what size he is but you get a little grit yourself claim your god-given privileges in Jesus Christ and you'll Rejoice that's right I love this next one I started crying he says old shamgar stood there and his righteous indignation got up and here they was Trump trump big heavy armor what did he do he said I'm an Israelite I'm a Believer I've been circumcised in other words he says receive the Holy Ghost but listen to his next words I'm not a warrior I'm not a fighter I'm just a young person I'm just a housewife I'm just a new believer I'm just a new convert I've never won a victory before and there's nothing I can do he says only one I know one thing that's God's with me that's all I know and he reached up on the mantle and got an old Ox goat a little stick with a piece of brass on the end of it you punch the dirt off the flower bead and knocks to the gate with it it says he jumped out there under the power of the Holy Ghost knowing that he knew he had the right and slew 600 Philistines he says hallelujah that's right brother he was God's witness if God had led Moses if God had led the rest of them he was in Israelite just the same as they were Church whose family are you a part of tonight you're a part of the family of God you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are the faith children of God he says if God did it for them it's good enough for me if I come from that lineage then I've got the same promise if they had the rights I've got the rights I said and I've got the sign in my body you got the Holy Ghost you got access to everything that Christ had you got the access to the things that brother Branham had it is yours because you're in the same lineage you're on the same family line that's right he says and Mister you sitting in the wheelchair you in the Cod you here are back you under wherever you are if you're born of the spirit of God you got just as much right to rise from that chair and wheelchair tonight as any other man is you're born again he says get a little grit about you stand up and Jesus Christ standing here in his word proving what he is showing signs wonders miracles of his resurrection he says what more do you want he said shamgar's righteous indignation got worked up Church when's the last time our righteous indignation got worked up and we said enough's enough is enough sick and tired of being sick and tired sick and tired of sniffling day all in day in and day out sick and tired of not sleeping sick and tired of a besetting sin sick and tired of family issues sick and tired of this sick and tired of that why because the word says I don't have to keep it in my life anymore because the word says I'm supposed to have it and I don't have it that's when our righteous indignation ought to be worked up church is when he says it's supposed to be ours not when someone says something we don't like not when somebody offends us not when somebody ignores us that's not what gets our righteous indignation worked up our righteous indignation is for things that are righteous of God Amen not to preserve our dignity or or the facade of our outward appearance no no no righteous indignation is for the things that God has said Belong To You amen when's the last time we got indignant because of that Satan standing on our property rather than somebody said something about us did something we didn't like that's that's a waste of our righteous indignation Church let's get mad at Satan let's focus on what he's doing because so often what happens we get caught up in the little petty things of life and family and all these different things and meanwhile Satan's sitting on our couch eating our storm chips and he's just sitting there laughing at us because he's taken the joy out of our life he's taken the rest out of our life he's taken the peace out of our life and we don't have healing and we don't have the Holy Ghost moving in our life and we've lost Direction and all these things he's just sitting there laughing because we're fighting the things that don't matter what's gotten our indignation up our righteous indignation up amen I think it was brother Matt was telling me brother Ron Spencer preached on shamgar and he said something along the lines of he says the Philistines left enough every year for shamgar to survive and plant the next crop but they never left enough for him to get ahead or to enjoy the true benefits of what he had he did all the work and all he got was enough to take him through another year skimp through make it by the skin of his teeth year after year after year remember brother Brown says the Church of the Living God is living below her privileges I think it's because our indignation's gotten up about things that don't matter and we're not fighting the good fight for the things that do matter amen brother Brian said shamgar one day he had enough he said I know who I am and I know what comes with it he says that I'm going out there and whether I die or whether I live at least one Philistine is going to know he shouldn't have stepped on my property today and one by one by one he killed 600 Philistines who for to make a great name for himself to be known as shamgar the Great he did it for his family he was fighting in his own backyard for the souls and for the the well-being and the health and the preservation of his family church that's where we ought to be fighting first in our own homes and then in this home because this is the body and listen if you got time after that then we got plenty of prayer requests from outside this local body for you to pray about and put your time into in these different things amen but shamgar got to the place where he realized who he was and what benefits came with that position he got a revelation of who he was remember that's that's the greatest Revelation the bride's going to have because when that happens as the prophet said the Rapture will go he got a revelation you know what that did that took shamgar out of religion and into relationship into a real Revelation what it meant it took him out of just talking about it to be in it to experiencing it in his day-to-day life amen listen he didn't just have doctrine that day he had overcoming power he had the Holy Spirit moving in him and it didn't matter what he used he picked up what he had available to him listen you go up against swords with an ox code sword wins every time Naturally Speaking you put it up against Spears and Shields and thick armor and that what's an ox go going to do but that's what he had next to him and God blessed what he had next to him when he turned in righteous indignation and he turned it on the ones that were holding them back from his promise shamgar wasn't Supernatural that Ox goat was Supernatural God preserved him through the whole thing LeBron would say this he says now the word of God is a sword Hebrews 4 12. he says and a sword is perfectly dormant if it isn't yielded by a hand or a power now we don't use swords anymore we use guns but had gone up on the wall is completely dormant a gun has never killed anybody people with guns kill people a gun is dormant sitting there on the Shelf he says the sword is the same way the word of God is the same way you leave it sitting here it won't do a thing for you you can say you can believe it you can identify with it you can come here and hear the preaching of the word but he says it's dormant unless it's yielded by a hand or a power but it takes a hand to hold the Sword and the hand that holds a sword is the hand of Faith now that hand of faith it depends on how strong it is you look at these big swords they had in the medieval times and these things require two hands to hold them these things were five and six feet long you didn't just swing that with a little puny wrist you had to have real arms and real hands of a power to hold a sword like that and to use it effectively he says the word of God is the same thing the hand of faith it depends how strong it is this hand of Faith might just be strong enough to cut a little hole through the darkness and say by faith I'm saved that's a great cup but then if that's all the strength that hand has to yield that sword then that's all it can cut but if it's a strong hand it'll cut Plum through everything the devil can put out there make every promise of God shine forth in the power of his resurrection if it's a strong hand of Faith the days of Miracles Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever Cuts its way through he says it depends on the power of the hand that yields that's behind the sword and the sword he says is plenty Sharp in other words there's nothing wrong with the weapon scripture says the the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword right cutting the sun even to the asunder of bone and mirror and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart problem is not the weapon yo you get these snipers and they've got these these weapons and they're dialed in perfectly now I go out there and I use it and I'd probably start putting it all over the place and I'd say there's something wrong with your gun but the guy that just put three bullets in the same hole would say it ain't the gun buddy it's you you got to learn how to handle it he says the sword is plenty sharp Hebrews 4 said it's sharper than a two-edged sword that cuts both coming and going even to the marrow the bone and in the joints of Discerning the thoughts of the heart it goes beyond the physical it goes into the spiritual realm and picks up the thoughts of the heart and reveals him the spirit of God the word of God now that word will cut in there if there's enough arm behind it to push it in it'll find its place and cut out every promise and give it to you if you just got the strong arm enough strong enough arm behind it brother Brown doesn't read this I put this in there in second Corinthians it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not warn the flesh see so often we get the issues whether it's it's issues with sickness and these different things and we think it's all about us it's it's in this natural world Paul's saying listen you're not fighting against flesh and blood he says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds I want to mention two things here it can't be our weapon if it's not being used in our war if you don't use it you can't say the weapon's no good so if you're using a different weapon than what God's given you and it ain't working don't blame the weapons that God has that you're not using you've got to take his weapon in your hand but the next thing it says is that the weapons are mighty do you ever notice that he didn't say we're mighty he said the weapons are mighty it's not me that makes this powerful in and of itself the weapons Mighty as long as I've got faith to swing it so my faith is what's going to move it but it's the strength of that weapon that makes it cut it's the edge that's on it and that's not of my making that's of God's making listen look at Gideon what was Gideon's weapon trumpets and flames in pictures why because that wasn't Gideon's weapon Gideon's weapon was obedience that simple time and time again he obeyed and when Gideon obeyed less and less people followed less and less people were part of his army until the end he only had 300. he went from tens of thousands down to 300 in obedience and then God used them and they didn't even have to really fight they just had to break down those pictures wave the the the the the the Torches and blow the trumpet and say the sword of the Lord and Gideon and all of a sudden the enemy started killing themselves Gideon's weapon was obedience to the word of God and God used him then to do the rest but the first thing he had to do was obey brother Brian will continue it says the sword pick it up in an arm of Faith grip it tight hold on to it and walk into the face of the enemy how can that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God not your presence the big papa bear behind you the almighty God that says I'm going to go forward ahead of you and I'm going to send hornets and I'm going to send fear and I'm going to make them scared before you even get there that's who they're going to be scared of that's who's going to bring the victory so he says you take the sword of the word and every promise belongs to you pick it up in a strong hand of faith and walk forward if you need healing cut it out with the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if you need salvation every promise in the book is yours it's laying back in there and Satan's trying to hide it but take the sword and push through the darkness until the light of God shines in upon your soul and you have the promise he says notice it says you're holding the sword but God's performing the work you're swinging it but God's making it effective I don't know if any of you have ever played with a young child that's got a hockey stick in their hands or a baseball bat or a Nerf gun you can't beat a child like that because they're completely unpredictable it's just you you can't or if you have a toy sword that's even worse because there's no Rhyme or Reason to what they do they just flail around and you you know they don't go by the the gentlemanly conduct of play swords they're just trying to hit you and they do hit you and you always have to give them the the sword that's made of wood while you take the plastic one or the foam one or whatever so they wrap you on the knuckles and they wrap you on the ankles and whatnot they're not beating you because you can't beat them they're beating you because what you're not allowed to hurt them that's the way it is with God you got a little child swinging a big sword and Satan's not allowed to kill you so he's just trying to get out alive and all you gotta do is keep swinging the sword the sword is effective because you're swinging it but God's making the sword do the work if I'm fighting with Samuel with swords in myself I could kill him I could hurt him anytime but I don't hurt him out of love Satan can't hurt us because God won't let him he's blocking everything Satan does and he says go for his ankles chop them down wrap them on the knuckles make them howl make them pay make him not want to come back again God's the one that's blocking all of his blows and letting yours slide through his guard time and time and time again until he falls over shamgar had an ox goat that was the weapon God gave him and God made that weapon prosper that simple brother I'm saying there Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that scripture will get you every promise in the book Hebrews 13 8. just keep using it and saying you said it Lord and I'm believing it and that's it and just keep swinging just keep swinging just keep swinging don't worry I don't know how to fight don't worry I've never used a sword before just keep swinging it and God will bring the results amen he says it'll cut through anything Satan puts in front of you anything but you got to trust it brother Brad would say if Satan can get you to doubt your weapon that's when he defeats you so don't stop because you're not seeing the results because sometimes it takes a while but the results will come if you stick with it scripture says lean not on your own understanding amen Paul would finish this with Timothy so he's telling Timothy says you got to fight the good fight Timothy you got to war a good Warfare and then at the end he comes and he says I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith notice what is it that is the good fight for Paul he fought for the right things he fought to obey God he fought to be a reflection of Christ he's fought until he's finished the work that God had for him on this Earth he says that's it I'm done I'm going to go out he says there's now a crown of crown of righteousness laid up for me I'm good to go I have no more need to fight anymore if they kill me if they let me live it doesn't matter I've done my part and so he was happy to go and you'll find that so often with with Believers is when they're done their work God takes them home because there's no rest here there's no peace here that's all waiting for them so he says when you're done I just want to get you home so you can actually get your reward so you can relax a bit so you can sit back and enjoy the things that God has in store for them to love him but this fight for Paul what was it it was a lasting overcoming faith that took him all the way willingly into death in Caesar's Court through it all God had the supernatural God made him a preacher a preachers a prophet of prophets a prophet to the age listen we're still reading his words today that's how good his fight was that he found the will of God and he stayed with it no matter what came his way in weakness in issues with his health conscience problems all these different things through it all Paul fought and he fought to do what God had called him to do amen brother Brown would say this and we're closing with these these two quotes he says I love all of you and I want you to love me and if we love the Lord we'll feel that way about each other someday I'm going to go to dinner with all of you amen won't that be wonderful now just think after the battle's all over and the smokes died down we come up and meet our loved ones and then we meet him we sit down at the table across from each other won't that be wonderful there'll never be a crutch or a wheelchair around the table never know won't that be marvelous and then when we see all of that sitting there I look across the table and I say well God bless you my brother my and then we'll just have to cry a little bit don't you believe so if we can we'll just cry a little bit for joy and then at the head of the table will come out our King in his majesty he'll walk down among all of us and put his arms around us and say you've suffered much you went through much for me he wipes all the tears away from the eye now don't cry anymore it's all over oh for that great time he says that's why we're here isn't it that's what I'm looking forward to not just to go to the other curtain you know be on the curtain of time if I would die in this life but I want to go and see my Lord and Savior I want to see everybody else the fullness of the of Christ the the fullness of the body of Christ there I want to have Fellowship I want to have the tears wiped away I want to get my 21 year old body back again I don't want to have to worry I don't want to have to strive and fight for the things we do today he says that's why we're here isn't it won't it be wonderful to feel his arm around you and say now don't cry enter into the joys of the Lord you fought a good fight and he says so while we're here and got this opportunity let's make it a good fight a real fight amen God bless you this evening let's stand and the musicians would come amen we're in a fight sister Betty's in a fight Mama's in a fight Daddy's in a fight young people are definitely in a fight worse than it's ever been the craziness that we see today I I'm so glad I'm not a young person young at heart but I'm not young I would not want to be there and it's a fight and you've got to decide what are you going to fight for we've got to decide what we're going to decide what we're going to fight for amen what's our righteous indignation going to kick up this week is it going to be for the promises of God is it going to be for the things that that he's told us belong to us or is it going to be wasted on some petty little thing that'll fall and fade away and break and it's made of man and it's not going to last amen I want to encourage us tonight sister Betty's in a fight a man that will be praying tonight that we'll be praying in the morning that God will show his mighty hand in her life amen that she'll have a hand of faith that she'll go in expecting that God's going to move in her body if he hasn't already if he hasn't already why put it off till tomorrow it could be done my sister when she got healed of cancer she knew it was done but she didn't have proof until days later but it was a finished work before they ever got in there amen we're trusting God to do these things amen but we've got to fight amen we've got to be in prayer we've got to be supporting her no matter what comes out no matter what comes out amen We Believe that's what we are as Believers we believe and we're in it for a fight but we're in it for the young people we're in it for the Holy Ghost we're in it for the Lord to move in these Services we're in it for anointed preaching but I'm in it for anointed fathers and anointed mothers and anointed husbands and anointed wives that God can step in and say you've had enough time to move these things out time to take hold of it time to lay hold of eternal life and start saying Satan it's over you've bothered me long enough you bother my children long enough you bother my job long enough you kept my peace my joy whatever it is lay hold of eternal life lay hold of the promises of God and say Satan you're going to have to back down or you're going to get a hurting because I've got a sword that can cut through anything you put in my way and I'm going to swing it until there's nothing left that's the good fight stick with it amen lay hold of that which God has promised you and say I will not let thee go unless you bless me amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I want to be found fighting the good fight Lord and I believe every heart and soul here Lord wants to be fighting for the right things Lord but Satan's greatest weapon I think so many times is distraction Lord is to get us focused on the little things that don't matter while keeping our eyes off of the great things that you promised to us Heavenly Father Lord we know we're in a time of manifestation Lord everything that can be shaken will be shaken Lord and only that which is of Christ that only that which is eternal is going to stand Lord would you help us to fight for things that are Eternal and let the rest of it be shaken off Lord let us lay hold of eternal life let us lay hold of the purpose and plan and will of God Lord let us seek after that Lord let our fight be for the things of God lord for the good things that you've laid in your word Lord and let us not let go until you've given us what you promised Lord May our names be written like those in that Hebrews book or chapter 11 Lord that that chapter of Faith Lord it says for time will fail us to tell of all of these different ones Lord May our names be in there as well Lord that we overcame Lord that our testimony was that your word was yea and amen that by your stripes we are healed Lord that we have every promise in the book and it belongs to us Lord let us be walking in it Lord let us not leave it Lord on our desk or on our bedside table Lord but let us take it in our hands and put it on our lips Lord let us speak and let us not just think it but let us speak it in Faith Lord expressing our confidence our Assurance Lord that you'll do what you said you would promise Lord Lord bless us this evening Lord pray in your grace especially for sister Betty Lord God Lord I believe most of us Lord can't even understand what it's like to go through it Lord but you brought us through many dangers toils and snares Lord and we're trusting you to bring her through this one as well Lord we give you the glory we are we give you the honor we give you the praise Lord would you make us fit to serve you in your kingdom Lord to fight for the things that truly matter Lord that it would be a benefit not only to us but Lord to the the body of Christ around us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen by my spirit 547 is there a mountain in your way
