had come the Bell fries of all Christ and dumb had rolled Along The Unbroken Song of Peace on Earth Good Will good men till ringing singing on its way the world revolved from night to day a voice a chime a chance Sublime of peace on Earth Good Will to men then from each black a curse and mouth a cannon thundered in the South and with the sound the carols drowned of peace on Earth good will join men it was as if an earthquake rent the hearthstones of the continent and made forlorn the households born of peace on Earth Good Will toward men and in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on Earth I said for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on Earth good will for men then peeled the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doth he sleep the the wrong shall fail the right Prevail with peace on Earth Good Will toward men here foreign [Music] and while there's rain there's always [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] please on Earth [Music] as easy [Music] [Applause]

bless you turn with me to home in Exodus chapter 13. the book of Exodus chapter 13. praise the Lord brother what Israel experiencing coming out that the bride is experiencing and what is it is going in amen there's one thing to come out but there's another thing to get the faith to go in and brother that's what Joshua and Caleb struggled with Israel and struggled with the Jews to get him to believe that have that faith and to try to give them that Faith to point them to the promised land and then and just think that God God allowed them to to No Doubt God predestinated for ordained it but for for them to go into the promised land and take some of those Jews into the promised land oh yeah so that they could see that it was it was a wonderful land that God said he was going to take them into but oh yeah they saw it they acknowledged it oh the language good but they focused on the negative not the positive and the negative was the those that were living in the land and now they said oh no oh yeah the land is good exactly what God said it is but they said oh although those that are living there we can't we can't fight them we can't do this we can't do that amen but Joshua Caleb was giving them the Revelation if God be forced who can be against us amen they're encouraging with the faith listen God brought us this far and God brought us right to the Borderland amen God's going to take us across the border amen and God has brought us all the way down through the church ages amen one age after another amen and brother all the saints in all the ages they had to fight those those evil spirits amen and yet they were religious Spirits amen oh yeah it's very religious see the devil is there to try to get you to be religious but not spiritual amen so brother it's all it's all right if you're going to be religious but let's let's go a little further and be spiritual amen by believe leaving what God has promised in his word by believing what God is doing according to his word amen praise the Lord and remember too much Religion Today is just based on what what God did oh yeah and what our forefathers did and they believed if they started this they did this they did that yeah but now God wants us to move on Amen to Perfection by the grace of God hallelujah and the and the Jews that came out of out of Egypt oh yeah God oh yeah wonderful yeah Lord did this the Lord did that oh yes and he brought us through the Red Sea and he did this he did that oh my but now he wants us to go into this land there and oh my but those that are in the land oh they're they're they were to them they were soldiers and they were afraid of them oh we don't know if we can fight them well no God fights them Amen brother it's not you it's God in you amen by the grace of God and brother the thing who was God waited for another generation to rise up and go in and possess the land amen it was a third generation and we are about I believe the third generation since the going of the Prophet amen because there was a generation that that came at the time of the Prophet brother and they just didn't really never add the faith that the prophet was trying to get to them because God sent their properties and now he's going to go forth and he said with the revelation of the word and he said and increased their faith amen get them he said get them to believe amen that's where the angel commissioned him Amen in when he when he was in the cave and the angel came to him and he said get get he said here he said give him the word and he said get him to believe Amen brother all the way down through in every age brother God I sent a messenger with the word and to get the people in that age trivity right on down to Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostal age it was Amen to get us to believe amen so brother I pray Grace now Hallelujah we believe what God did with Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals we know what yes rather because we need justification amen we needed sanctification we needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the gifts of the Spirit Amen to move on to the greater revelation of God the resurrection and the Rapture Amen brother it was it was the Jews to believe the believe the prophets and Believe The Messengers that God has sent down to them down Through the Ages unto finally they were challenged to believe the Christ they were challenged to believe the word made the fullness of the word amen because the word was with the others and the Word was made flesh in the prophets but then the fullness of the word was made flesh in Jesus amen and they were challenged to believe it and we are rather concerning all that God has done down through the Seven Ages through this messenger that messenger another messenger amen and now brother God is challenging us concerning what he has done in the last messenger through this age amen we're not going to worship the messenger we're going to worship the one that he talked about as he as he as he said let me say it again when he came to the pulpit with with the anointing that was that of Jesus and Discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart now he said oh he said I got to get out of the way he said because he said I can't do this amen why he knew that Jesus would do it so he would get out of the way and let Jesus control his being let God get brother I pray you you'll get out of the way and let God let Jesus control you for the resurrection for the Rapture he needs to control us Amen brother he needs to have control of you any of your faith for what for the Resurrection The Rapture amen it's so it's not you that lives is Christ Living in you amen and as Christ leave it in you oh praise the Lord you got the Assurance of the Resurrection that's right they're not going to miss it no no Jesus was predestinated onto it he did this he did that when he was made flesh he knew he said I'm going to lay my life down and pick it up again and brother oh yeah and oh what did he has he done it now yes all the way down through he got in he got in the Believers he was made fleshing in the bride and all the way down through brother oh yes their lives were laid down physically amen but amen but the promise is that he's going to bring him back again in the Resurrection The Dead In Christ shall rise first hallelujah amen he came back so that now the seed of God would be in him amen by the revealed word praise the Lord until finally he comes right down to the end of the ages the resurrection and the Rapture amen we don't have the time to go through what he did in every age what he revealed in every age and so on but brother yes Pentecost thought they were going to do it no God was going to raise up the brain according to the resurrection because Pentagon sought the restoration of their gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that was going to take us right out into the resurrection Rapture no that was just to get us ready for the revealed word amen Revelation 10. amen praise the name of the Lord amen why because what what we need for the resurrection is is Faith Resurrection Faith right through faith brother what was the anointing we got under Pentecost the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now it's going Beyond it it's not just healing your body your body physically no it's going to change your body completely amen amen amen oh oh do you believe in healing oh I tell you if God is challenging our faith in healing he's challenging it now amen because now God is expecting us to believe for the healing of the body unto the change of the body amen it's not just to oh just to Cast Away this sickness or this feeling or this or this or that no no now it's to change the body amen from physical to eternal from that time to Eternity to get out of this and into each oh praise the Lord God help us to believe Amen brother we got it in our souls he's working out it he's bringing it out in our Spirits amen the prophet of God I elated it he said because we are threefold and he says Soul or the the soul and the spirit and the body amen so the Holy Ghost amen baptism in the soul will control your spirit amen and through your spirit you will control your body hello praise the Lord amen do you have that baptism in your soul amen if you do it's controlling your spirit amen your human spirit amen if you've got the baptism in your spirit he's going to control your flesh and you're going to go and you're going to go go and live the life of Jesus amen amen why because he's he's working himself out through your your soul your body your spirit and your body by the grace of God Amen Hallelujah till we go into eternity in a glorified body Amen brother we need to get out of this one yeah I can look and I can see you know that most of your brothers and sisters here you need it but you need a young body amen well brother do we have that faith that we're going to get out of this body and we're going to get into a young body that'll never grow old Grace yeah and we're going to be the same as our young sisters here that would be around 20 years old oh yeah yeah well we're believing to get back to them but brother sister God God's expecting our young brothers and sisters here to believe for others so that they're not going to go and get any older than 20. amen amen so they're not going to experience old age no no they're going to experience eternity amen amen amen we think oh yes we're just us because we're old and gray and getting bald and so on no no no yeah that's good too praise God but they're they're believing that the age they are some of them they're not going to get any older amen and those that are younger they're good they're going to be that age yeah praise the name of the Lord God help us to be late with a complete belief amen that we truly believe it and we got no as I said no question and we got no doubt amen We Believe amen and brother that's the faith that God's looking for Grace brother is the prophet of God highlighted in a certain message it was called why cry speak speak what speak the word amen the enemy is there to get you to focus on the natural God is there to get you I get you to focus on the spiritual and the eternal amen not time but eternity by the grace of God God bless us again in Ezekiel or Exodus rather chapter 13. and verse 17. and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them out through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said lest per Adventure the people repent when they see War and they returned to Egypt yeah not repent and get closer to God repent and get further away from God God help us but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up Earnest out of the land of Egypt and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him amazing for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall

minister get up and you remind them of this word and that word amen sure but it's more than that bring it is to bring us into a Oneness with the word amen it's Amen is to bring us to the place where it's not me that lives it's the word living in me amen oh it's Jesus it's the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us now the words may flesh in you amen the same word revealing Jesus amen all right brother is your life reflecting the word oh can you say Yeah in the beginning was the word word with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and the word is made flesh in me amen why how do you know that because it's not me that lives it's Christ Living in me and Christ was the word amen he was made flesh to redeem us now he's made flesh what for amen to make that Redemption flesh in you praise the Lord hallelujah Glory praise the lord it's not just a it's not just the thoughts that we believe in our heads and oh yeah it's just a feeling no no it's a revelation in your heart amen not me that lives is Christ Living in me just think of that amen Christ is in you Christ is in me but he he was there luck two thousand years ago there's Jesus amen here's Jesus no no it's it's he's now he's the Holy Ghost he's the Holy Spirit In You amen now you are you are reflecting Jesus the word was made flesh now the words may flesh in you SG oh my God apples oh this is this is serious this is tremendous challenge to our faith amen it's not not us just here and we're we're believing Jesus and and we look at the picture oh yeah this is Jesus this is Jesus oh yeah amen so Lord we we believe that that you were the word made flesh we believe what you did and so on do you believe what he's doing amen the devil believes what he did do you believe what he's doing brother the devil is there to add too and just just to get you away from what what God is doing brother and he's done that all the way down Through the Ages God went and did this and the devil come in and says yea I say unto you but forget the much again God bless our brother Folger buds belong to goats not sheep or lamb no no amen yeah I say unto you but the day that's what the devil Devil's there brother where there was where there was Adam and Eve in Genesis amen where there's some Believers in the last days oh yeah we want to take our stand for the word of God God has said God requires this it is written in the word of God Amen and the devil say yeah but but he wants to add a word to it or take a word from it oh yeah to make you wait that's why that is his deception in in denominational influence oh yeah God God went and did this God went dead there what did the enemy do the enemy came in and what did he do he caused him to make a make a denomination out of it oh yeah and make a Creed out of the out of the Lord make a Creed out of it yeah amen yeah we believe this we believe this we believe that and that was it that was a period oh yeah and then when God would come back and reveal more of the word to them they wouldn't believe it now after three or four generations amen most of them just believe what what God what God had done originally in the in their in their first Revival and so on whether it's the Lutheran Revival the Methodist Revival or even the Pentecostal Revival and unfortunately now among among so-called message revivals yeah brother it's oh yeah they're they're going to get well God did this and God did that God revealed this and God revealed that yes brother but God is moving on amen God don't want you to just sit there and just just make a denomination out of it that's the enemy doing that yes I believe this but they want they want they won't let God come in and increase it they won't let God come in amen and give them greater and greater and greater Revelation understanding of what he gave you when you started yeah you we need it yes sure because when when Martin Luther started with justification and God would God would move on and God wanted to reveal sanctification no no because they denominated and they were and they there's very few of them would believe few did believe and went on with with John Wesley in sanctification and they of course we know again after the third generation they organized and when the god came with the Pentecostals amen and The Bachelors of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen so there was a few there that believed that and they would go on with the Pentecostal Revival amen but now brother we're moving beyond that because the Pentecostal Revival was over 100 years ago amen but now for the last maybe 50 60 years whatever God has God has revealed his word what for because brother the word that heard the word that he gave the Lutheran them it gave them the faith that God wanted them to have in justification the word that he gave Wesley gave them sanctification and the word that he gave them under the Pentecostals gave them the baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives of the spirit now where do we go from here amen now we've got to go on to Resurrection and rapturing Faith amen amen because o brother sister don't don't think that oh yes listen the the lutherans and the Wesley they had they had a faith for the resurrection amen because God took them by way of the Grave amen and they believe that in in that hour and that age brother we're living now amen when the dead in Christ shall come first come forth first they'll come forth Amen brother sister yes indeed we're all down through the ages including Lutheran Wesley and amen including the early Pentecostals Amen to God be the glory praise the name of the Lord but brother what about you and me what are we looking for amen and what what is the faith that God is giving us father through the revealed word in this hour amen brother thank God for justification thank God for sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen thank God for the ministry of the of the revealed word amen glory Alleluia to Crown what he did brother through all the prophets in the Old Testament Jesus was the crown of it he crowned it his ministry was the crowning of the of the of the what the all the prophets were prophesying and preaching Jesus came the word in flesh amen and all down through the eight Church ages Amen brother there is a bride that right comes on the scene amen and is the crowning of all that God has done down Through the Ages amen so do we believe what God has done do we believe what God is doing amen amen because what God has done through the revealed word the opening of The Mystery of finishing the mystery of God Amen is to give us the faith we need now amen and we need it sure thank God for justification we believe it sanctification we believe in the gifts of the Spirit baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe it amen but now brother God's requiring something of us that he didn't require of them amen God's looking to do something with us in us through US amen that he didn't he didn't never predestinated to do it with them amen they went down amen but they had the faith for the resurrection they'll come forth the dead in Christ shall rise first amen and that's that's the saints of God that went down in all the ages amen right on up to this hour We're living now amen and they'll come forth but there's going to be a living Saints and living bride amen with a with a resurrection and a rapturing faith amen again I got to repeat this again that the prophet of God our brother William randomly he said God is waiting on us and he said the dead in Christ are waiting on us amen why are they waiting on us they're dead in Christ brother if we're going to have the resurrection of raptory Faith whether we'll call him out come on Amen to bring the dead out of the grave I'll tell you what now I'll be out to be honest that there won't be we know there won't be many living Saints when it comes to physically so most of the most of the of us that's going in the resurrection Rapture are they they're they're saints that are gone on yeah and and the living bride is going to call them forth as it were for the resurrection and amen and we'll have fellowship and then now after after a little while we're gonna look up there Jesus amen amen Jesus was with us Jesus was in US amen as Jesus calling the elect all down true Amen to finally the word that was made flesh in Jesus and the word they flesh in in his seed in these sons and daughters in his bride down Through the Ages defining the word is made flesh in the bridegroom again and he comes back to be United with his bride Grace are we uniting with Jesus amen brother it is brought to do so that we're going to the marriage supper of the Lamb by the grace of almighty God it's right there in in Revelation amen that we're gathering for the marriage from the lamb and not all but the elect the seed of God amen are you the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ are you married to him let's focus the more yes on our spiritual marriage oh we can focus on our physical marriage yes good but okay is it a type of your marriage to Jesus God help us God is challenging our faith no wonder he come to Peter Peter love us thou me more than these do we love him more than we love loved him Alleluia Eternal more than we love the temporal God help us truly we can't love the temporal without loving him to love amen to love one another one another as we ought to love one another we truly ever loved him and experience his love for the baptism the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love Amen brother search the scriptures Grace amen amen and amen I don't know if I read Exodus 14. okay sorry thank you brother okay Exodus 14 verse 10 again and when Pharaoh Drew nigh and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt as thou taken us away to die in the wilderness oh people years ago first we come to this word the message people would oh you're not you're no no you're not part of no denomination no we don't agree with that oh who's going to bury you um that question then asked me I said we want to bury me I said don't worry about that I said they won't leave me Underground I said I'm sure of that so I said after a while I said this whole body of stink and I said they want to get rid of it so I said I said forget that no they're just worried about who's going to bury them who's going to bury me forget it brother let's pray Grace that you haven't got to Bear you spiritually amen but you got we gotta you got eternal life amen don't worry about the natural amen focus on the spiritual not pleasing natural man is pleasing God Hallelujah pleasing God what you do pleasing God in what you believe by the grace of God God in control of your life amen so amen Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God so are you led by the spirit of being here tonight amen that's right god Elvis oh no we just I trust that it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost not religious leadership it's Holy Ghost leadership oh because religiously there's many in churches around the world tonight oh brother sister not they're not predestinated to Resurrection not predestinated to a Rapture rather so I pray Grace that do not remember they're not all lost we know that but they're not bright oh no they're not bright there's very few if there's going to be over the summer there they're going to be saved yes but I wouldn't say there's many there's going to be few there is I believe that because there's going to be many that's going to witness the the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride oh yeah the Bible says there's many that so many that that saw it and witnessed it and so on the grace of God so are you bride I pressured bride we're here I pray Grace brother if we're we're here because we believe we're bright and that oh yeah God has called me to be a part of the bride of Christ that's why I'm here that's why we're believing this believing that God is challenging my faith your faith amen brother pray in Grace oh yeah and not not all that's out there in those denominations not

thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands that's going to going to witness it outside the city oh yeah the the bride and the bridegroom are in the city but outside the city there's going to be Millions oh yeah again when I was into a certain seniors home and there was this sister there and she was moving on and uh she was a certain denomination and she said pastor she said I want the one first she said I want you to pray for me and she said because I trust you and she said but she said I got a Bible question she said and so on and she wanted to know where everybody was going to be you know when it comes to all being saved she said brother she said where are they going where's the Lord gonna get them to live in the new heaven new world she said she said if the the Bible speaks of the the water that was coming out of the throne and so on away from the throne now I said that represented the word I said the water of the word I said but I suggest there's going to be seeds there and she talked about what the Bible said about you know this sea and that sea and so on the water and she said but she said well she said will there be enough room on the earth land she said for for all the seed to be saved and so on and live I said oh yes so I give scripture concerning that and so on oh she said thank you she said I didn't I I didn't understand that I didn't know that she said well thank you so I give her scripture give her the word amen concerning the new Heaven and the new Earth and what it's going to be like praise the name of the Lord but brother what we are endeavoring to be is the bride amen we're going daring to be the bride of Christ so that we're going to be in the city with the bridegroom amen not outside the city but by Greece in the city that's the Carly and the bride don't think oh we're going to heaven Brothers come here heaven oh my I've had that question over the years too when certain other believers out there they say oh was it was Heaven going to be like you know because oh will it be any Earth oh yes I said there's going to be a a new Heaven and a new Earth amen the Bible says that and so on I said oh yeah she I said there's going to be a oh yeah Heavenly Jerusalem a New Jerusalem I said yes New Jerusalem I said right is going to be what she said there are only that many only that minute is going to be the bride in the New Jerusalem in Jerusalem I said yeah I said have you any idea how big the New Jerusalem is going to be no well I said according to scripture I said it's going to be around 1500 Miles Square and I said 1500 miles this way 1500 miles that way length and width at 1500 miles high and at the top is going to be the throne amen praise the Lord she said what I quoted some scripture there oh she's amazing wonderful yeah so I said be encouraged I said keep pressing on amen brother we're not going to a fairy tale we're going to a real new Heaven and a new Earth amen glory we're not going into into a fairy tale body no just didn't think it's just going to be a spiritual body it's going to be an eternal body amen by the grace of almighty God God help us to really believe God help us to truly believe amen it is written thus saith the Lord amen a new Heaven and a new Earth and those that live there in glorified bodies with our Lord Jesus Christ in the city amen but there's going to be those outside the city please please don't think that it's just us in the city no no brother you got to understand who you are according to the word and who are you according to scripture we are elected predestinated seed amen but there's going to be many still others are going to be saved and they're going to be outside the city just that's why you got to keep the right attitude and you've got to keep a right Spirit to everybody amen by the grace of almighty God Amen so brother see sorry oh they go in about an hour well that's all right an hour yes we're dealing with eternity and brother it's difficult sometimes just to break to take what's in eternity to bring it down into time but by the grace of God Billy Endeavor to do it amen but in your life there's no way no you're gonna you're gonna go out and and let eternity control you morning noon and night amen you're in eternity when you get up in the morning you reach energy through the day you're in eternity through the night and committed yourself into the hands of God in eternity leaving Amen to Eternity is in control by grace in your thoughts in your words and your Deeds eternity is controlling amen Grace in verse 11 again in chapter 14 of Exodus and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt as thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore as thou dealt with thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt amen and brothers sometimes people want denomination and the benefits of a denomination natural rather than come out of the nomination into a non-denominational church yeah they want they want the more the assurance and of the nomination than a non-denominational building or church or group Grace to us amen oh yes there's a price one of these days they're going to put the pressure yeah that we'd have to what non-denominational groups would have to identify with a denomination or that hour is coming oh yeah you certain sure yes and I believe that that there's many non-denominational groups out there they will humble themselves and become identified with this church or that church or this denomination or that now oh yeah you won't be non-denominational no no they won't they won't allow that they wouldn't want that but are we going to stay with that faith by the grace of God that's why he eventually whether God's going to Rapture the bride but those there's going to be many that are going to be left behind and they're going to lay down their lives yeah because they won't identify with organized religion they want so God help us amen so he's not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness no brother but God let him die in the wilderness they paid the price because of their lack of faith to go on to move on to the promised land God help us keep going amen don't feel like we got we got to identify with this and identify no way stay with the word amen by the grace of God and he said and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord amen oh to them they were oh it was tremendous test of their faith and God brought it out their lack of faith amen but Joshua and Caleb oh they had the faith to keep on going and they and they waited for another generation to rise up a third generation that would believe and go into the Promised Land but this generation that came out of Egypt they died in the wilderness God help us of all that has come out of denomination of Egyptian bondage how many have died because of unbelief not all but some yes God help us as I said that one time when I was preaching in a church in central Newfoundland and the the whole audience was there and there might have been two or three hundred people in the in the audience and as I said we had a altar call and now I I didn't preach there but there's another idea I have preached there but not at that time it was the pastor really that was preaching and after then he turned it over to me and we were having a altar call and so on and as I said they all came this these few came up this one came up that one came up and finally as I said I noticed there was two sisters there and they were they were they weren't their young or teenagers or anything but they might have been in their 30s and I remember when we were singing and worshiping and I looked down and I said Lord I said they're not believers I said they don't have the Holy Spirit you know they yet they were they were worshiping but there's just something about it that I noticed that there was a different Spirit on them and around them you know and they weren't because later they went back into the world yeah yes so brother we better make our calling and our election sure by the grace of God that we're not going to die in the wilderness not by any means whether it might be a spiritual Wilderness but don't don't die under spiritual Wilderness I pray Grace the brother of Dead deaths were to take you there you go you're going into Glory amen by the grace of God amen and this generation that died in the wilderness rebuked Joshua rebuking Moses for work doing what they did and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord don't fear what's coming what's going stand still and see the resurrection and the rapture amen don't let the enemy bring in the butts to you amen leave the butts to the goats amen brother you know what the oh you know what they use the goats for how are the goats related to the Sheep the goats were used to go up the path into into a certain place that where they want to get the Sheep to slaughter the Sheep so the Sheep would know ordinarily go up so what they did was they would put the goats there and the goats would walk up amen and the Sheep would follow the goats and when it got to the top the goats would jump off and go and and and and go down but the Sheep would keep on going to the slaughter yeah so they should make sure we're not led by goats amen that we are sheep amen again verse 13 and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord stand still and see the resurrection stand still and see the rapture brother we were dead and now oh yes we're now we're alive you have you quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses he has made you alive and not only that he's raptured us hello I was preaching that in a certain church one time that I've been raptured I said I've been resurrected I've been raptured and as I said the Pastor was turned around to his audience and he was shaking his head no no he didn't agree with it I said Lord I thought for sure he would believe that that we had been resurrected and we have been raptured and he was shaking his head to his congregation no no don't don't respond to that it's not right and so I the Lord led me to the scripture and it shocked him why I said I want to show you I have been resurrected have you I'll tell you if you haven't been resurrected now you will never experience Resurrection in the in the time of the rapture you've got to have it now and not only that you got to have the right you got to have rapturing faith now yeah Resurrection fee Glory so I went to the scripture and I said I want to prove to you I've been resurrected and I've been raptured I said what about your faith amen because have I been resurrected spiritually and raptured spiritually I'll be resurrected and raptured physically Ephesians 2. and you hathy quickened what does that mean resurrected Made Alive you were dead in sins and trespasses but you as he resurrected amen is this you as he quickened amen a resurrection who were dead in trespasses and sins you were dead spiritually but now you've been made alive you were cut off from God now you re you're United with God amen oh praise the Lord hallelujah that's why you go forth and you live that resurrected life you live you're living that raptured life amen and it says we're in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience amen and then he went on down and says even when we were dead in sins now I said oh you were dead but now you're Resurrected amen when you we were dead in sins as quickened us together with Christ amen by Grace ye are saved amen and it's from the inside out you got to if you if you want to experience want Resurrection in your body you got to have it in your soul it's going to work its way out by grace and it says even when you we were dead in sins and quickened us and quickened means to resurrect together with Christ oh so when Jesus came forth you and I came for it spiritually by Grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we've been raptured into Heavenly places in Christ and the power of God said what's going on there when he quoted the scripture he said what's going on there he said the word is being revealed amen praise the Lord to increase our faith he said we've been raised up sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen Heavenly places are you in a Heavenly place tonight Grace he said that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus Hallelujah for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen praise the Lord why he said we are his workmanship is what he's done in you and me and what he's doing in you and me amen created in Christ Jesus praise the Lord Hallelujah to God be the glory brother oh yes if you're resurrected and you're raptured spiritually all there's no way that the devil can get get the true revelation of the resurrection and Rapture physically from you amen because you've already experienced it in your soul amen all praise the Lord and the power of the anointing the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings you into a Oneness with that Revelation amen and what you're looking crying calling for the natural physical resurrection and rapture you're hungry and thirsty for the natural and physical Resurrection Rapture amen praise the Lord God's grace to us brother I pray Grace that we have the faith that Jesus had when he was going to Calvary Amen brother we're experiencing it 24 hours a day we gotta die die die to the Natural become more and more and more alive to the spiritual amen the more we die to the Natural the more the more we're more spiritual and resurrected physically oh it's gonna you're gonna strike strike it one day and amen and we'll go from time to Eternity will there be a generation that'll rise to that faith and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air and if we're caught up to with them brother we're changed we're changed to a glorified body Hallelujah Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord amen see the resurrection and the rapture which he will show you today to do to you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever oh yes let's get into the place too where we'll get out of oh out of this and into eternity and there'll be no more denominational religion no no Grace the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen and amen and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me spake unto the Church of Israel that they go forward it was the prophet of God that ministered in the message why cry speak amen and God was challenging Moses why are you crying to me wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the Church of Israel that they go forward don't listen we don't have to cry for this and cry for that father sister let's go forward why because through the anointing and baptism of the Holy Ghost we have the resurrection and Rapture in us we've been resurrected and we've been raptured in our souls and God by that experience in our souls God is working out in us the physical resurrection and rapture by the grace of God and then and to remind you again if you want to get that time maybe later tonight or whenever to read Ephesians chapter 2 and especially the first 10 verses concerning the resurrection and the rapture that we have been resurrected and we have been raptured the spiritual is moving us on to the physical by the grace of God amen why Christ speak the word Satan get behind me we've been resurrected and we've been raptured Satan is not not that I'm going to be resurrected not that I'm going to be raptured I've already been resurrected Satan and I've always been raptured and I've been caught up into a Heavenly place in our Lord Jesus Christ amen I trust that you've got the experience of a resurrection and you've got the experience of a Rapture in your life amen and you're pressing on to the physical resurrection and Rapture of your body believe it with all your heart don't let the devil cause you to doubt it believe it amen he said now he said we got quite a subject on why Christ speak as God said to Moses why are you crying to me speak the word and he said I'll try he said I want he said to do this as they felt the Holy Spirit would lead him leading him to minister on why Christ speak and he said to this text of Moses crying out to God in the time of trouble and God rebuking Moses back right when trouble was in session amen God rebuked Moses the way you're crying to me for speak the word yeah Moses what's wrong God was questioning Moses faith is God questioning your faith when you experience this and you experience that and you cry under the Lord cry cry cry speak the word he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he shall be with you even in you to the end of the age amen speak the word don't just worry about the devil don't let the devil hit you and put you down you get down oh oh no oh no Satan get behind me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen Brother Where where's our faith in Jesus where's our faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because Christ reminded us anything you ask the father in my name he will do it what Lord please forgive us of our unbelief forgive us of our sin and brother the greatest sin that God sees is unbelief God help us amen and he said God rebuke him Moses right when trouble was in session and it's just nature seeming like for a person to cry out and then he said well what a rebuke it is for God he said to turn around and rebuke him for saying for crying out to him God rebuked him and he said it looks like it's a very hard thing and many times when we look at the scriptures in our own way of looking at it it seems very hard but if we study a little while we find out that the all-wise God knows just what he's doing amen he knows and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man amen now he said we don't but God does and he said we only know from the intellectual side but God knows what's really in the man we judge things intellectually but God judges things spiritually from the soul amen God looks at you oh the works oh man judges you by your works but God's going to go into your soul Amen to judge the spirit that controls you amen so be careful don't don't judge and condemn your brother your sister oh this one or that one oh you do this you did that or you said this you said that no just leave it and commit him to the Lord and pray for them yeah pray for them grace of God remember he said God knows what is in a man he knows we don't we only know from the United intellectual side but he knows what's really in the man because Moses was born in this world as a gifted boy and he was born a prophet he was born a deliverer and he was born with equipment born in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment as I firmly believe in the foreknowledge of God the predestination not that God is willing that any should perish but that all will come to repentance being being God he had to know and does know the end from the beginning amen he wasn't willing certainly that Eddie should perish but he knowing who would perish and who would not perish that's right God knows here tonight Who's going to make it in the resurrection and Rapture and who's going to miss it you'll confirm your faith by responding to give him your strength and your encouragement he'll be there to help you move on amen amen he said listen he knew who would be who wouldn't perish and who would not perish and he said that's the very purpose that Jesus came to the Earth was to save those that God through is for knowledge amen sin that wanted to be saved do you want to be safe in your heart in your soul not just your flesh but your heart and soul do you want to be resurrected do you want to be raptured well brother I'll tell you if you were got the nature of God in you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to be resurrected and you want to be raptured amen you most definitely want to get out of this whole world for the glory of God got up our young brothers and sisters that are here tonight God bless you please in the name of Jesus sir and I pray that they'll seriously consider the plan purpose and pattern of God that there's a reason for it so I pray God help our young brothers and young sisters amen that they're not try to consider it and understand it intellectually but pray God speaks with them in their hearts and give them a revelation yes and understand this that as you get older the Lord willing Lord tarries amen that he he's going to give you a greater and a greater and a greater revelation of what he has done and what he is doing and what he will do offense in just a moment he said listen he said no man can have his sins recovered unless his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world thank you Jesus thank God Amen he said Moses was born with a gift of faith a great faith Moses had and we see it after a while he said coming out in him hey amen he was strictly Moses was strictly a type of the Lord Jesus amen all right so Grace brother sister that we have that faith that pleases God amen and again why Christ speak what's the end what's the highlighting he's highlighting faith because Faith speaks the word faith speaks the will of God Amen he said listen a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture he said we know we've lived the time out the time of the Rapture is at hand and we have we are looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the churches together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in amen we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give us rapturing Faith amen he said that when that light he said flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds and the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens listen you've got to meet the light amen you've got to find that light amen Grace Grace for that anointing of the resurrection and the rapture amen Lord there's the anointing for the for the gifts but now they're experiencing the anointing for the resurrection and the rapture Amen to get us out of time and to get us into eternity Grace to give us that faith that pleases God amen again understand this the faith that pleases God oh well the disciples at it Luther at it Wesley at it Pentecostals at it yeah but what was it what was the faith that they had that pleased God for Luther it was justification Leslie sanctification the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit they had that faith and they went forth oh yeah the Pentecostals were living living for the gifts the baptism the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit morning noon and night they were going around the world with the with the revelation of the Revival but what God had done and what God was doing what was it that God in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was God in the restoration of the gifts in the restoration of the anointing and so on what God was doing in their lives amen Grace healing signs wonders yeah yeah and that's why that's why the Lord warned us in the word that they're gonna there's gonna be a deception yeah because the enemy is always there to to imitate what God's doing whether it's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen the enemy was there to impersonate it and use false anointed ones yeah Grace but why the prophet of God said the anointing was real but their teaching wasn't he said they had a false teaching or they'll say oh yeah I believe this I believe that then they'll add this and add that or take away this and take away that God help us stay with the word of God look up look up your Redemption draws nine look out the Rapture is upon us the rapture how much longer we got to go I don't know but brother we're at the end it's been 2
