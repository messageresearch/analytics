[45:39] for the gift that you gave myself and
[45:40] the family at Christmas you are very
[45:42] generous we certainly appreciate that
[45:45] and as many of you know we take that and
[45:47] we put it towards a family vacation so
[45:49] we can get some time together away as a
[45:51] family so thank you for each one that
[45:53] gave you know it's been a I think a
[45:54] rough year financially for most of us
[45:56] things have just been cost of living so
[45:59] high and things pop up and maintenance
[46:01] on homes and vehicles and these things
[46:03] and seems like there's more month left
[46:05] than there is money every every month
[46:07] but uh I'm thankful and I'm I'm very
[46:10] appreciative of the gift that you gave
[46:12] us so God bless you each one wanted to
[46:14] thank those that went and visited sister
[46:16] Violet Ellsworth in the hospital many of
[46:18] you went that could and I know she
[46:20] appreciated it once she realized who you
[46:22] were and uh I think just being in a
[46:24] hospital Christmas about the worst way
[46:26] to spend spend it so having people come
[46:28] in and and bring her things and talk to
[46:30] her and encourage her and help her out I
[46:33] know she appreciated it very much so God
[46:35] bless you for that amen God bless you
[46:38] Galatians CH 5:1 says Stand Fast
[46:41] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[46:43] Christ has made us free and be not
[46:46] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[46:49] amen God bless you you can have your
[46:50] seats this morning and I'm going to be
[46:52] very pastoral this morning brother
[46:54] Carson and sister Sharon I hope you
[46:55] don't get in the crossfire this morning
[46:57] but I was talking to brother Matt before
[46:59] service he said brother John I'm going
[47:00] to remind you I love the teaching but I
[47:01] like the preaching even more preaching
[47:03] gets down to where we're living amen and
[47:05] so I want to take a a topic this morning
[47:08] or a thought this morning on Liberty or
[47:10] loopholes Liberty or loopholes and it's
[47:13] this time of year you know as we're
[47:14] approaching the new year and I think
[47:16] it's a good time for us to stop and look
[47:18] back at where we've been and what we've
[47:19] done and how we've lived and how we've
[47:21] made decisions and not just what we've
[47:23] done but what's the fruit of what we've
[47:25] done cuz really what we've done
[47:27] sometimes we don't know what we've done
[47:28] until the fruit comes out you know as
[47:30] Believers we trust that we pray about
[47:31] things and we look to the word of God
[47:33] and we trust that we make the right
[47:35] decisions but really it's not until the
[47:36] decision comes to its full fruition that
[47:38] we see whether it was of God or not
[47:40] whether we found the will or God of God
[47:42] or not and so I think it's a good time
[47:44] to check up and say is my life showing
[47:47] the leadership of the go of the word of
[47:49] God in my life I think we ought to do
[47:51] that every single day not just at the
[47:52] end of the year and as we come into a
[47:54] new year but the reason I say that is
[47:56] because as Believers we're always under
[47:58] attack whether we realize it or not we
[48:00] are always under attack and so often
[48:03] what we see is what we think are the big
[48:04] attacks but really what we need to be
[48:06] worried about are the little attacks
[48:08] that we don't realize have happened
[48:10] because so often what happens is we see
[48:12] big results and we think the result is
[48:14] the attack the result is not the attack
[48:16] the attack is what caused that result
[48:19] this the attack is the seed that was
[48:21] planted the decision that was made the
[48:23] choice that was made that resulted in
[48:25] this big effect see so often we blame
[48:28] Satan for the effect and we are the ones
[48:29] that have made the choice and that's not
[48:31] the way it is so many times you know so
[48:33] many times we've missed where it started
[48:35] because we didn't have discernment of
[48:37] what Satan was trying to do we miss the
[48:40] same things of God many times we don't
[48:42] have the discernment to see what's going
[48:44] on but so often like I said we're seeing
[48:46] the result of the attack and not the
[48:47] attack itself you know I I have to laugh
[48:49] a little bit and maybe it's not
[48:51] something to laugh about but earlier
[48:52] this year remember when Hezbollah had
[48:55] had these attacks going on and their
[48:57] cell phones were blowing up or their
[48:59] Pages were blowing up and this is a
[49:02] terrorist group and Israel knew that
[49:04] they were going to attack them and so
[49:05] Israel blew up their pagers but how do
[49:07] you blow up a pager you can't just blow
[49:10] up a pager Israel had made a sneak
[49:13] attack at the point of manufacturer and
[49:15] put a minor amount of explosive in every
[49:18] single one of those pagers and little
[49:20] did they know the attack had been made
[49:22] it just hadn't had its full result yet
[49:26] and so one day when Hezbollah decides to
[49:28] attack Israel Israel targets thousands
[49:31] of their leadership and their members
[49:33] and in one day they kill a bunch of
[49:35] people and they name a bunch of others
[49:37] and then they think the attack's over
[49:39] and then a day and a half later they
[49:40] blow up their walkie-talkies the attack
[49:42] happened at the source of manufacturer
[49:44] it didn't happen on their bodies but all
[49:46] they had to do was they press the button
[49:47] and that seed that they planted that
[49:49] explosive that they planted it blew
[49:52] up if they'd only guarded the point of
[49:54] manufacturer they wouldn't have been
[49:57] seeing the results of that attack on
[49:58] themselves amen Paul's giving us a
[50:01] warning here not just to the galatian
[50:03] church he's giving it to all of us about
[50:05] a slow slide into things that God has
[50:08] set you free from that God has led you
[50:10] out of that God has has drawn you out of
[50:13] that God has delivered you from because
[50:15] remember Satan is Sly and Satan will get
[50:18] into the narrowest of cracks if we'll
[50:20] open the door listen brother Bram says
[50:22] we've all got one thing we've got to
[50:23] keep covered and we keep it covered by
[50:26] prayer and humility amen we never none
[50:29] of us should think none of us should
[50:31] think Satan can't get me because I'm too
[50:33] spiritual I'm too good of a believer I'm
[50:35] too close to God I've got the Holy
[50:36] Spirit Satan can't get at me Satan never
[50:39] takes a lunch break Satan is there 247
[50:43] he's got demons there he's got
[50:45] influences he's got all sorts of things
[50:47] pressuring us to try and get us to open
[50:50] up a little window a little door a
[50:52] little crack into our lives so that he
[50:54] can get in and Paul was looking here and
[50:57] he's he's looking at the galatian church
[50:58] and he's not warning them cuz it's not a
[51:00] problem he's warning them because he
[51:02] sees what's going on and he was seeing
[51:04] that things were creeping in that they
[51:06] hadn't that they had been delivered from
[51:08] before and remember we've heard that
[51:10] song sin will take you further than you
[51:11] ever want to go and he's saying look you
[51:14] think that you've come out of it and you
[51:16] think you can handle it and now you're
[51:17] going back into the very things that God
[51:19] Drew you out of in the first place Paul
[51:22] was saying check up and see if you're
[51:23] living where Christ has set you or if
[51:26] you moved back into something else
[51:27] listen brother Braham says we live below
[51:29] our Privileges and so many times we live
[51:31] below our privileges by choice by the
[51:35] decisions that we make day to day Paul
[51:37] said this stand fast that phrase means
[51:40] to
[51:41] persevere stay with it don't back off
[51:45] don't give ground don't fall back hold
[51:48] your position in the Liberty therefore
[51:51] in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made
[51:53] us free and be not he does not say be
[51:55] not entangled
[51:57] he says be not entangled
[51:59] again this is something that you had in
[52:02] your life before he says don't go back
[52:04] into those things be not entangled again
[52:06] with the Yoke of bondage Paul's saying
[52:08] you got a battle not to fall back into
[52:10] those habits back into those things that
[52:12] you used to do now there's context
[52:14] that's required here because Paul's
[52:16] talking about multiple yolks of bondage
[52:18] he was talking about how false Ministry
[52:20] came in and was trying to put the
[52:22] Gentiles under the Mosaic law again and
[52:25] no believer at that time had to be under
[52:27] the Mosaic law Christ had fulfilled the
[52:29] law now they're under a New Covenant of
[52:31] Grace but you had these Jewish teachers
[52:33] that were coming in and trying to PE
[52:35] bring people back to the law in some
[52:37] portion so that they could have a
[52:39] measure of control and he says don't let
[52:41] them put you under a yoke of bondage but
[52:44] they've never been under the law so this
[52:46] would have been a new yoke so he's
[52:47] saying don't be caught up in that but
[52:49] also Beware of the things that I've
[52:51] pulled you out of already amen I'm not
[52:54] here this morning to preach about the
[52:55] ways we've been taught and saying we've
[52:57] come out of it let's not go back to it I
[52:59] believe we've been taught right I
[53:01] believe we're a testimony that we've
[53:03] been taught right in this church we have
[53:04] three generations of Believers here
[53:06] Faithfully serving the lord because
[53:08] we've been taught right but let me say
[53:11] this in all of that teaching right we've
[53:13] still had to come out of
[53:15] things Amen in all of that teaching
[53:18] right we've still had to come out of
[53:19] things because we come into this with
[53:21] ideas and opinions and preferences and
[53:24] the way things are done and then we also
[53:26] velop Traditions as we go through life
[53:28] as we attend church as we go through
[53:30] things we develop these things and we
[53:32] can turn them into a bondage of sorts
[53:35] and we can try and bind people to those
[53:37] things so what I want to say rather this
[53:39] morning what I'm led to say is make sure
[53:41] that what you have is of God and not of
[53:44] yourself because if it is of yourself
[53:46] it's a bondage to you and if you start
[53:48] to apply it to others it's a bondage to
[53:51] them and nobody wins and everybody loses
[53:53] in those situations you know what I
[53:55] remember when I moved to Dallas Texas
[53:58] and and I heard something said over a
[54:00] Pulpit and I repeated it and thank God
[54:03] for brother Aon mcir he says who told
[54:05] you that and I said it doesn't matter
[54:07] it's the word of God he says can you
[54:09] show me
[54:10] that and I said yes I can and then I
[54:13] realized I couldn't because what
[54:15] somebody had told me something and I had
[54:17] taken their word for it because they
[54:19] were a minister rather than checking it
[54:22] with the word of God
[54:24] myself and all of a sudden I'm repeating
[54:26] a
[54:28] lie why because I trusted
[54:32] somebody there's a reason why you have
[54:35] to read your Bible every single day
[54:39] because youve got to have discernment
[54:40] for what's coming over this Pulpit or
[54:43] whatever Pulpit you're listening to or
[54:45] whatever Minister whatever person you're
[54:47] talking to you have to establish the
[54:49] principles of the word for yourself God
[54:53] uses a five-fold Ministry of course we
[54:55] know that for the per perfecting of the
[54:56] Saints but I only get you an hour an
[54:58] hour and a half twice a week what are
[55:01] you going to do the rest of the week
[55:02] you're going to have discernment because
[55:04] otherwise what happens is people will
[55:06] place you in a position of scriptural
[55:08] bondage and guess what it's not
[55:10] scripture it's their scripture it's not
[55:12] the word it's their word it's not God's
[55:14] thoughts it's his it's their thoughts
[55:16] and you can get bound up in these things
[55:18] amen I'm not saying we never grow or
[55:21] mature in our understanding of course we
[55:22] do but God will reveal things as he
[55:25] feels led to in our lives lives but we
[55:27] can't just sit here and take everything
[55:29] we hear from every believer as scripture
[55:31] or as Truth by no means amen I was
[55:34] talking with brother Vel and sister
[55:36] Becky at our house the other day and I
[55:38] said if you can settle the principles of
[55:40] scripture and the way that God works
[55:43] you'll never be led astray there are
[55:45] basic principles that never change in
[55:48] the word and what happens is people will
[55:50] come in and they'll preach the what they
[55:52] call the deeper things of God or the
[55:54] mysteries of God or they'll preach a new
[55:56] Doctrine and if you're established in
[55:58] the principles of the word you'll be
[55:59] able to say Amen or you'll be able to
[56:02] stay quiet because you'll know that
[56:05] doesn't quite line up with the
[56:06] unchanging word of God and the deeper
[56:09] people go usually the further off they
[56:12] get because they forget the principles
[56:14] because they're trying so hard to be
[56:17] different amen we've got to personally
[56:20] have
[56:21] discernment personally have discernment
[56:23] about the things that are being said
[56:25] around us amen because if you don't know
[56:27] the word of God somebody can come in and
[56:29] they can tell you you're not a Believer
[56:31] you're not a Christian you're not a
[56:33] child of God if you don't do this if you
[56:35] don't do this if you don't attend here
[56:37] if you don't believe this if you don't
[56:38] have this evidence if you don't have
[56:39] this effort absolutely we've got people
[56:43] remember I read that story not too long
[56:44] ago of that man that came to brother
[56:46] Bram he says brother brandom I'm just
[56:48] trying to get saved he says I've been to
[56:50] the methodists I've been to the
[56:52] Pentecostals I've been to Oral Roberts
[56:54] I've been to Billy graah I've done
[56:55] everything they've told me and I still
[56:57] don't have
[56:58] it why because they were putting him in
[57:02] unscriptural bondage by their what
[57:06] church
[57:07] ideas remember he shouted when they
[57:09] wanted them to shout he spoke in tongues
[57:11] when they wanted them to speak in
[57:12] tongues he said the sinner's prayer he
[57:14] did all of these things and yet he says
[57:16] I don't have it and brother Brandon
[57:18] pointed him back to when did your mind
[57:21] change towards our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:23] when did you love him and seek after him
[57:25] and he says it's when I read a track and
[57:27] then I got that awfulest feeling inside
[57:29] of me that my life needed to be changed
[57:31] brother Braham says you were saved then
[57:34] and he was trying to satisfy that with
[57:36] what other people were telling him
[57:38] rather than going to the word of God and
[57:39] seeing what it told him to do and how he
[57:41] would know he was saved they have bound
[57:43] him in a yoke of denominational bondage
[57:46] and don't think it can't happen in the
[57:48] message well people will tell you if you
[57:50] haven't done this and you haven't done
[57:52] that church if your life has been
[57:53] changed and you love the Lord Jesus with
[57:55] all your heart soul and mind then you
[57:58] have received him and if he takes you
[58:01] into his word and he continues to reveal
[58:03] it and you continue to live by guess
[58:05] what you've been born again because
[58:07] that's what being born again does is
[58:08] it's a renewing of you it's a changing
[58:11] of you into a new creation and as long
[58:13] as he's changing you that means he's
[58:15] working with you and that's how you know
[58:17] you passed from Death unto life I'm not
[58:20] here to put you in or put you out God
[58:23] help me if I ever tell you you're in or
[58:25] out that is is not my place my place is
[58:27] to point you to Christ and invite you to
[58:29] the Liberty that he offers I don't ever
[58:32] want to bind you to myself I don't ever
[58:35] want to bind you to any Ministry or any
[58:36] Doctrine I want to take you to the word
[58:38] and get you bound to him Paul called
[58:41] himself I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[58:43] that's the greatest thing that we could
[58:44] ever be amen bring you to your personal
[58:47] position in the body of Christ so I'm
[58:50] here this morning say let's live in
[58:51] Liberty let's not be under that yoke of
[58:54] bondage but it for the Galatians the law
[58:57] of Moses was not their bondage and if
[58:59] you look further down and we'll get
[59:01] there as we go through Galatians 5 this
[59:02] morning we'll read most of it their
[59:04] bondage was not the law of the Jews
[59:07] their bondage was the life that they had
[59:08] came out of their bondage potentially
[59:10] was the things that God had delivered
[59:12] them from and you'll see that what they
[59:14] had was pretty
[59:16] nasty so often we think what we have is
[59:19] not that bad but let me tell you when
[59:21] Satan takes it and he starts to grow it
[59:23] and those roots start to get in our life
[59:25] it can get pretty nasty
[59:27] it may not be filthy in the traditional
[59:29] sense but it can certainly bind our
[59:31] lives and you'll notice in our lives we
[59:33] never start with fruit wouldn't that be
[59:35] easy if we saw the fruit of everything
[59:36] up front we never start with fruit we
[59:39] always start with a seed we start with a
[59:41] choice we start with a decision we start
[59:43] with a footstep in a certain direction
[59:45] and then it's only afterwards that we
[59:47] see whether we were right or wrong and
[59:50] this is the thing as we're talking about
[59:52] entanglement this morning and Liberty
[59:54] and loopholes if we're bound by
[59:56] something you'll notice we aren't bound
[59:58] up front we're bound at the end that's
[1:00:02] the thing with entanglement is you never
[1:00:04] think it's going to be as bad as it is
[1:00:07] you think that it's either too small to
[1:00:09] be a bother or a hindrance to you or you
[1:00:11] think that you can control it that's
[1:00:13] what we'll see as it comes to
[1:00:15] entanglement it starts out in a way that
[1:00:17] thinks you think you can get away with
[1:00:19] it that you're strong enough Paul says
[1:00:21] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[1:00:24] bondage Paul's saying you know what this
[1:00:26] is you know what this does you know that
[1:00:29] you needed to be set free before and now
[1:00:31] you're going back to something that you
[1:00:33] know you need to be set free from he
[1:00:35] says it makes no sense you know what you
[1:00:37] needed to do Paul's saying you're on the
[1:00:40] road to bondage
[1:00:41] Again by your own
[1:00:46] choice that word entangled though it has
[1:00:49] so many meanings we're going to unpack
[1:00:50] the scripture this morning I I so
[1:00:52] enjoyed looking at this because it
[1:00:53] opened up some things in my life as well
[1:00:56] that word entangled is not just talking
[1:00:57] about bondage from Habits and these
[1:01:00] things but the root behind it it means
[1:01:03] to harber
[1:01:06] resentment to hold a grudge and it's
[1:01:09] speaking of unresolved issues in our
[1:01:12] life see he's not just talking about dos
[1:01:15] and don'ts hey let's face it most of us
[1:01:17] are pretty good with dos and don'ts how
[1:01:19] are how good are we at resentment issues
[1:01:22] how good are we at personal problems
[1:01:24] with people how how good are we at not
[1:01:27] getting bitter about things that didn't
[1:01:28] go our
[1:01:30] way Paul says don't things let get so
[1:01:33] far that you're so twisted up that
[1:01:36] you're captured in this
[1:01:37] situation did you know we can resent
[1:01:42] god brother viel do you mind me talking
[1:01:44] a little bit about your testimony is
[1:01:46] that okay this morning brother Vier was
[1:01:48] sharing with me he's a young man he's
[1:01:51] single he's got all this time he's got
[1:01:52] all this
[1:01:54] money he's got all this
[1:01:57] time and he was saying to me see brother
[1:01:59] Vel loves to
[1:02:02] learn and as he came to this
[1:02:05] message he had time on his
[1:02:08] hands and what he his preference was was
[1:02:12] to continue his
[1:02:14] education his preference was to continue
[1:02:16] to learn and grow do you know why
[1:02:19] because brother Vel had a
[1:02:21] plan and you know what God
[1:02:24] Said No
[1:02:27] and here's the thing what he needed to
[1:02:29] do was he needed to get into the word of
[1:02:31] God and so God spoke to him and he says
[1:02:36] study my word and serve my body that's
[1:02:40] what he was told to do now here's the
[1:02:42] thing brother Vel has a choice now he
[1:02:45] can resent God for taking away his
[1:02:48] opportunity or he can praise God for
[1:02:50] giving him an
[1:02:52] opportunity his Opportunity by vel's
[1:02:55] plan or God's Opportunity by God's plan
[1:02:59] we are talking sister Becky was sharing
[1:03:00] I was talking a bit about how I when I
[1:03:02] was in British Columbia and I was moving
[1:03:05] up the corporate ladder and the next
[1:03:06] step was president and these different
[1:03:08] things and I willingly walked away that
[1:03:11] to preach this
[1:03:12] gospel and that was happy for me I don't
[1:03:15] believe it was much of a choice because
[1:03:18] I was happier preaching the few times I
[1:03:20] was preaching than anything I was
[1:03:21] getting in the corporate world but there
[1:03:23] is a sacrifice certainly of a lifesty
[1:03:27] style but guess what I'm happier today
[1:03:31] doing what I'm doing than if I was the
[1:03:33] president of a $100 million
[1:03:35] Corporation but if I dwell on the
[1:03:39] changes if I dwell on the changes and
[1:03:42] Satan can twist that I can start to
[1:03:45] focus on the wrong thing that hasn't
[1:03:47] been a a worry for me by God's grace I'm
[1:03:50] very happy I'm very content but you've
[1:03:52] got to realize I spend at least 20 hours
[1:03:55] a week in study and prayer to preach
[1:03:57] these services on top of a full-time job
[1:04:01] on top of being a husband and on top of
[1:04:03] being a father there are days the few
[1:04:06] days we get of sunshine where people get
[1:04:09] to go outside and they get to hike and
[1:04:10] they get to fish and they get to sit on
[1:04:12] the deck and read a book they get to
[1:04:14] wash their cars they get to go play
[1:04:16] soccer or hockey or baseball whatever it
[1:04:18] might be and guess where I am I'm stuck
[1:04:22] in the basement
[1:04:24] studying you think that I don't want to
[1:04:26] go out there I would love to be out
[1:04:28] there but guess what there's something
[1:04:30] else that God has ordained for me to
[1:04:33] do and so I do it but if I'm not careful
[1:04:37] I can start to resent and I can start to
[1:04:40] get grumpy and I can start to get
[1:04:42] prickly because I don't get to do what
[1:04:44] everybody else is doing
[1:04:47] today I've got to keep my mindset focus
[1:04:50] on the effect of what I'm doing rather
[1:04:54] than the feeling of what I'm doing amen
[1:04:57] if I'm focused on how I'm feeling church
[1:04:59] I'm going to fail most of the time cuz
[1:05:02] Satan's real good at at working with my
[1:05:04] emotions with our emotions but if I can
[1:05:06] focus on the purpose and the promise
[1:05:08] then I'm going to come through just fine
[1:05:10] amen Paul's talking about a place where
[1:05:14] we can resent people
[1:05:16] again where we can resent situations
[1:05:20] again see we think we've gotten past it
[1:05:24] but Satan will come up and he'll remind
[1:05:26] me of that time that brother Carson
[1:05:28] didn't shake my hand after
[1:05:30] church and pretty soon I start to think
[1:05:32] that brother Carson's got a problem with
[1:05:34] me because Satan is working to get me to
[1:05:36] resent something that I long forgave
[1:05:38] brother Carson
[1:05:40] for chance are brother Carson didn't
[1:05:42] ever do that in the first place and it
[1:05:44] wasn't a slight but see Satan's here to
[1:05:47] try and bring things back to get our
[1:05:49] mind and our emotions Twisted so that we
[1:05:52] start to resent the Believers around us
[1:05:54] church if we move past the situation
[1:05:57] don't go dig it up again but here's the
[1:06:00] thing if we haven't buried it then don't
[1:06:02] pretend we buried it either let's deal
[1:06:04] with it let's get it out in the open
[1:06:07] let's go brother to brother I'll go to
[1:06:09] brother Carson after church and say
[1:06:10] brother Carson you didn't shake my hand
[1:06:12] after service I I'm feeling resentful
[1:06:14] towards you brother I want to shake your
[1:06:16] hand I want to hug your neck and tell
[1:06:18] you I love and appreciate you that's the
[1:06:20] only thing that's going to get us past
[1:06:22] it amen remember we spoke in a service
[1:06:24] not too long ago about one of the
[1:06:26] greatest weapons brother Bram said was
[1:06:27] our willingness to commit something to
[1:06:31] God our willingness to lay it
[1:06:35] down and let God take over to lay down
[1:06:39] our rights to lay down our our offenses
[1:06:41] to lay down our emotions and all those
[1:06:43] things amen but if we've truly committed
[1:06:46] it to God we can't say I've committed it
[1:06:48] to God and then be angry we can't say
[1:06:50] I've committed it to God and then have a
[1:06:52] grumpy attitude we can't say I've
[1:06:54] committed it to God and now I'm prickly
[1:06:57] we can't say I've committed it to God
[1:06:58] and we go around and talk about it that
[1:07:01] is not the way that this works that's
[1:07:03] being entangled again in something
[1:07:04] you've got the victory over and Satan's
[1:07:07] trying to work in our minds and work in
[1:07:08] our midst to do these things
[1:07:10] entanglement is a tricky
[1:07:13] business if you've ever tried to hunt in
[1:07:15] New
[1:07:16] Finland you know I just got back from
[1:07:18] hunting a few weeks ago you tried going
[1:07:19] through those Alders and they're grown
[1:07:21] over you think you're getting through
[1:07:22] and then something grabs you from this
[1:07:24] side and something grabs you from that
[1:07:26] side and pretty soon your gun's being
[1:07:27] pulled off your shoulder and your hat's
[1:07:29] off your head and you lost a glove and
[1:07:31] you don't know where or how it
[1:07:32] happened cuz it's what entanglement
[1:07:34] these things are just pulling at you and
[1:07:36] pulling at you we have our own attitudes
[1:07:39] we have our own issues we have our own
[1:07:41] interactions with others amen and then
[1:07:43] we have the entanglements of past habits
[1:07:46] and ways of doing things we have the
[1:07:47] entanglements of plans don't we brother
[1:07:50] Vel where we thought this was how it was
[1:07:53] going to go and this is what we wanted
[1:07:55] to do
[1:07:56] do and then what does God do he comes in
[1:07:58] he says no but we can fall back on those
[1:08:01] plans if the feeling of our leadership
[1:08:03] and our our walk with God starts to go
[1:08:06] away we can have the entaglement of
[1:08:09] opportunities we've turned
[1:08:12] down I have had opportunities come my
[1:08:15] way and I prayed about it and I said no
[1:08:17] and you know what they keep coming
[1:08:20] back and I know it's not of God because
[1:08:22] I know the impact and what it would do
[1:08:24] to my family would do to my church life
[1:08:26] or due to my Ministry and so I say no no
[1:08:28] no but why do they keep coming back
[1:08:30] because Satan wants to entangle me and
[1:08:33] he wants to entangle you listen if you
[1:08:36] say no prayerfully and it keeps coming
[1:08:37] back that doesn't mean it's God that
[1:08:40] means Satan's persistent is what it
[1:08:42] means if you've made your decision based
[1:08:44] on the word of God he'll never change it
[1:08:46] he'll never change it he can't change it
[1:08:48] amen Satan's trying to get us to think
[1:08:51] about it rather than pray about it and
[1:08:54] he's trying to get us to read reason it
[1:08:56] rather than would see what the word says
[1:08:59] and the more time he works on you the
[1:09:01] weaker we tend to get if we don't stay
[1:09:03] in the word of God and if we don't stay
[1:09:05] in Fellowship amen you know when we look
[1:09:08] at our life I believe every single one
[1:09:10] of us has a predestinated walk amen
[1:09:14] we're ordained the Paul says we are
[1:09:16] ordained unto good
[1:09:18] works and this is just me you can take
[1:09:21] it or leave it I believe that God has
[1:09:23] waypoints in our life that are hard
[1:09:25] points they're embedded they do not
[1:09:28] move for someone like me it would be
[1:09:31] that I have a hard point and that I had
[1:09:32] to meet and Mary
[1:09:34] Blanca I had to get baptized and receive
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost I had to become a
[1:09:40] minister so I could become a
[1:09:42] pastor those are hard points but between
[1:09:45] those points and again this is just me I
[1:09:48] believe there's a lot of
[1:09:50] variability I believe there's his
[1:09:52] perfect will and then I believe there's
[1:09:54] his permissive will and I believe the
[1:09:55] prophet taught that that we can do it
[1:09:57] his way or we can do it my way we can do
[1:10:00] it the easier way or we can do it the
[1:10:02] harder way and I'm just going to say the
[1:10:04] easier way becomes the harder way and
[1:10:06] the harder way becomes the easier way if
[1:10:08] we're looking at these things amen the
[1:10:10] path between those points is very much
[1:10:12] up to us we have choices remember what
[1:10:14] the the the the interpretation was given
[1:10:16] to brother bradam it says because you
[1:10:18] have
[1:10:19] chosen you've chosen the harder way and
[1:10:22] it is my way that means there was a
[1:10:25] other way and it was brother bram's way
[1:10:28] it was the fleshly way it was the easier
[1:10:30] way in that sense but he says because
[1:10:33] you've chosen my way the harder way a
[1:10:35] great portion of Heaven awaits you and
[1:10:38] this is a great Victory and love divine
[1:10:39] in these different things we have
[1:10:41] choices that we have to
[1:10:43] make and we've got to make sure they're
[1:10:45] clean they're not entangled brother
[1:10:47] Braham says it this way he says if
[1:10:48] you're a young woman dedicate your
[1:10:50] morals you're a young man dedicate your
[1:10:52] morals dedicate your mind dedicate your
[1:10:54] thinking dedicate your heart dedicate
[1:10:57] your soul dedicate all you are and let
[1:11:00] Christ work through that he says what a
[1:11:03] glorious thing you've got the rivers to
[1:11:05] cross you've got the bridges to go over
[1:11:07] you got the Brier patches you got the
[1:11:09] thickets you got the woods you got the
[1:11:11] Dark Places you got the high hills you
[1:11:13] got the high climbs he says what are you
[1:11:16] doing this life is not easy it's not all
[1:11:20] going to be fun in games he's saying if
[1:11:23] you get set yourself towards God the
[1:11:25] start you'll make it through he says
[1:11:28] someday you'll have to stand and look
[1:11:30] back and see where you come from and
[1:11:33] you're going to be judged by the course
[1:11:35] that you took he says put your all your
[1:11:39] mind and your thoughts on that North
[1:11:41] Star the center of God and don't move
[1:11:43] from it stay right with it it'll bring
[1:11:45] you straight like it did the Magi right
[1:11:48] straight to the
[1:11:53] Christ Church we choose
[1:11:55] chose whether it's going to be easy or
[1:11:59] whether it's going to be
[1:12:00] hard we can go God's way which is harder
[1:12:04] in the
[1:12:05] beginning but it's good at the end or we
[1:12:08] can go the way of the flesh which is
[1:12:10] Satan's way and it's easy at the
[1:12:12] beginning and it's hard at the end but
[1:12:15] one way or the other there's going to be
[1:12:16] hard
[1:12:17] days you want to go with the one that
[1:12:20] has a promise of benefit rather than a
[1:12:22] promise of death if we can put it that
[1:12:24] way Paul saying don't slip back don't
[1:12:27] dig up old situations don't dig up old
[1:12:30] habits don't dig up things you've gotten
[1:12:32] over don't dig up things that you've won
[1:12:34] the victory over keep going forward
[1:12:37] otherwise it's going to be bondage again
[1:12:39] and you're going to be back where you
[1:12:41] started in other words if you've been
[1:12:43] set free from something don't ever go
[1:12:45] back to
[1:12:46] it if the Holy Spirit has pulled you out
[1:12:50] if the word of God has called you out it
[1:12:53] will never draw you back in it would be
[1:12:55] contrary to
[1:12:56] itself that is not the way that God
[1:12:58] works amen the holy spirit will raise
[1:13:01] the standard of your life to match the
[1:13:03] word it will not put you back into the
[1:13:05] life that you used to have I've said
[1:13:08] this before you tell me why women that
[1:13:10] are professing Christians keep wearing
[1:13:12] less and less clothes and Tighter and
[1:13:13] Tighter clothes and they say I I'm
[1:13:16] allowed to do it well you might be
[1:13:19] allowed to do it but the holy spirit is
[1:13:20] not the one causing you to lower your
[1:13:23] standard you'll never see the Holy
[1:13:25] Spirit saying please go to that store
[1:13:27] and buy a shorter skirt than you've ever
[1:13:29] had buy a tighter skirt than you've ever
[1:13:31] had reveal more of your skin than you
[1:13:33] ever have that is not the working of the
[1:13:35] Holy Spirit it can't be God doesn't draw
[1:13:39] us out and then push us in again that's
[1:13:42] not the way it
[1:13:45] works I've shared this before with you
[1:13:48] there are certain apps that I don't use
[1:13:50] on my phone because God has shown me
[1:13:52] very clearly they're not good for my
[1:13:54] Ministry they're not good for for my
[1:13:55] family they're not good for my marriage
[1:13:56] they're not good for my mindset they're
[1:13:58] not good for my attitude I don't get
[1:14:00] involved with politics social media
[1:14:03] presence is minimal why because none of
[1:14:05] those things add to me they don't do a
[1:14:09] single good thing for
[1:14:11] me well maybe they do I can see where M
[1:14:15] I can see where there's uh camps going
[1:14:17] on and meetings going on and I can stay
[1:14:19] in in contact with some of the
[1:14:20] ministering Brethren and see what
[1:14:21] they're doing and some of these songs so
[1:14:23] maybe 1% of it is good and the rest of
[1:14:25] it is honestly a waste of time so I need
[1:14:28] to stay away from those things because
[1:14:30] they are time killers and they do
[1:14:32] nothing for me I don't have enough time
[1:14:34] as it is that's the last place I need to
[1:14:37] be so there are things that I don't have
[1:14:39] on my
[1:14:40] phone because God has shown me to stay
[1:14:43] away from those things and if God has
[1:14:45] has taken those things out of my life
[1:14:47] then who am I to add it back in because
[1:14:49] I think I can handle it guess what I
[1:14:52] can't handle
[1:14:53] it that's that's why he took it out
[1:14:56] that's why he took it
[1:14:58] out brother brah says it this way he
[1:15:00] says the salvation of Jesus Christ is
[1:15:01] not a hope so it's a noo you know when
[1:15:04] you are Christ the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:15:06] record with your spirit that you're Sons
[1:15:08] and Daughters of God old things have
[1:15:11] passed away and All Things become new
[1:15:14] that's the word that's the word all
[1:15:16] things have become new not a borderline
[1:15:18] Minister not a borderline Christian if
[1:15:21] the crowd's going this way you go with
[1:15:23] it that's not the way we ought to be he
[1:15:25] says if it goes that way you go with it
[1:15:26] no he says stay in the road stand in the
[1:15:30] Liberty where Christ has made you free
[1:15:32] he says be not entangled again in the
[1:15:34] Yoke of bondage or
[1:15:38] halfway God said it made him sick said I
[1:15:42] would you would be hot or cold for
[1:15:43] lukewarm he'd spit it from his mouth so
[1:15:46] God doesn't want a person that's just a
[1:15:48] professor without being a possessor of
[1:15:51] the blessings of God he says God grant
[1:15:54] the day hurries when Christians that
[1:15:56] profess to be Christians will be just
[1:15:58] what they profess to be God granted
[1:16:02] what's he saying entanglement is halfway
[1:16:05] living half in the world half out of the
[1:16:07] world dabbling in this coming to church
[1:16:10] dabbling in that coming to church you're
[1:16:12] set free and then now you're going back
[1:16:15] to it hey we've all got choices we
[1:16:18] absolutely have choices amen but it will
[1:16:20] be your choice to go back it will not be
[1:16:22] the leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[1:16:24] take us back when you've been delivered
[1:16:26] from something entanglement in it again
[1:16:28] is a personal choice it's a personal
[1:16:32] choice if God set you free and you knew
[1:16:34] you needed to be set free and you go
[1:16:36] back to it that is a personal choice you
[1:16:38] go back with your eyes wide open and
[1:16:40] it's on you then it's on you you were
[1:16:43] not fooled you walk back of your own
[1:16:45] free
[1:16:46] will Paul continues he says you did run
[1:16:49] well you were doing so well he says who
[1:16:53] did hinder you that you should not obey
[1:16:54] the truth Paul said you're seeing the
[1:16:57] results you're seeing the move of God
[1:16:59] you're seeing the works of the spirit in
[1:17:00] your life what
[1:17:02] happened what changed something changed
[1:17:06] remember I spoke of this not too long
[1:17:07] ago that that that if something has
[1:17:10] changed in our life it's usually because
[1:17:12] of a choice we've made if we're seeing a
[1:17:14] weakness if we're seeing a habit if
[1:17:16] we're seeing an
[1:17:18] attitude if we're seeing resentment or
[1:17:20] bitterness it's usually because we've
[1:17:22] elected to do something that we
[1:17:24] shouldn't have done it's a personal
[1:17:26] choice amen look at what Paul says he
[1:17:30] didn't say what did hinder you he said
[1:17:32] who remember there's only two sides
[1:17:36] there's Christ and there's everyone
[1:17:38] else so it wasn't Christ that hindered
[1:17:40] us so who must it
[1:17:43] be well it's got to be the influence of
[1:17:45] Satan Satan is the great influencer of
[1:17:47] this world we in Satan's kingdom we're
[1:17:50] not of it but we're in it and guess what
[1:17:52] this flesh is ATT tuned to to Satan's
[1:17:55] kingdom and this flesh is subject to the
[1:17:58] influence of Satan our souls are sealed
[1:18:00] by the Holy Spirit they're sealed to the
[1:18:02] day of our Redemption we cannot be lost
[1:18:04] but this body this flesh is absolutely
[1:18:07] attuned to listen to what Satan has
[1:18:09] coming our way and he's a master at
[1:18:11] putting things in front of us to entice
[1:18:13] us to entice our eyes to entice our mind
[1:18:17] to entice our bellies to entice our
[1:18:19] career to entice our intellectuality to
[1:18:21] entice our
[1:18:23] emotions to entice our need for
[1:18:25] influence recognition whatever it might
[1:18:28] be Satan's goal is to make us
[1:18:31] comfortable enough here that we're not
[1:18:33] trying to
[1:18:34] leave Satan's goal is to get us enjoying
[1:18:37] enough of life to keep the battle not so
[1:18:40] hard that we don't feel we need to get
[1:18:42] out of here that's his goal amen Paul
[1:18:46] would say this persuasion cometh not of
[1:18:48] him that calleth you in other words it
[1:18:50] ain't God that's doing this work he says
[1:18:53] a little leaven leaveneth the whole
[1:18:57] lump you know what Satan's goal is it's
[1:19:00] to have us as part-time
[1:19:03] Christians parttime
[1:19:06] Christians where we can come to church
[1:19:08] and we can raise our hands and we can
[1:19:09] say Amen to the word we can attend
[1:19:11] Faithfully we can write our TI check and
[1:19:13] we can say I'm a Christian a Christian
[1:19:16] is a
[1:19:17] 247 job it's not a job it's a reality
[1:19:23] amen it ought to be Who We Are but
[1:19:25] Satan's goal is to get us to the place
[1:19:28] where we are half in and half
[1:19:30] out where we give in sometimes and we
[1:19:33] hold the line sometimes but that's not
[1:19:35] the purpose of a
[1:19:37] soldier halfway soldiers die and halfway
[1:19:40] athletes never
[1:19:41] win our goal is not to be halfway our
[1:19:44] goal is to be hot or cold never
[1:19:48] lukewarm Paul says it perfectly here a
[1:19:51] little bit of Leaven leavens the whole
[1:19:53] lump of dough
[1:19:55] Paul talked a lot about Grace because he
[1:19:57] was fighting a legalistic
[1:19:59] attitude and remember the Jews were
[1:20:01] always trying to go back to that law or
[1:20:03] try and hold on to some portion of that
[1:20:05] law and it was all dos and don'ts and
[1:20:07] Paul tried to get them out of the dos
[1:20:08] and don'ts but yet Paul came in and said
[1:20:10] there's things you ought to do and
[1:20:12] there's ways you ought to live and
[1:20:14] there's habits you ought to have but
[1:20:16] what we can get into under grace as we
[1:20:18] get into this idea of well I'm a
[1:20:19] legalist so I can do anything you want
[1:20:21] you absolutely can brother brah says I
[1:20:24] drink and I smoke as much as I want to
[1:20:26] which is not at
[1:20:29] all so the question is who's doing the
[1:20:32] wanting is it you or is it the Holy
[1:20:34] Spirit we've got to make sure it's the
[1:20:36] Holy Spirit that's leading us you know I
[1:20:38] have a scripture that's saved in my
[1:20:40] phone I'm going to share in a moment
[1:20:41] brother Joe shared this with me because
[1:20:43] we use this as a tactic with scammers
[1:20:45] that text us and when they text us we
[1:20:47] text them back this scripture and we
[1:20:49] underline the word thieves in the
[1:20:50] scripture we hope to save a soul someday
[1:20:55] but I want you to see how Paul keeps
[1:20:58] this this idea of Liberty and legalism
[1:21:00] in balance of dos and don'ts he says
[1:21:03] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[1:21:05] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:21:07] deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:21:09] idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate
[1:21:11] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:21:13] nor thieves this is what we underline
[1:21:15] for scammers nor Covetous nor drunkards
[1:21:17] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[1:21:19] inherit the kingdom of
[1:21:21] God he says and such were some of you
[1:21:24] but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified
[1:21:27] but ye are justified in the name of the
[1:21:29] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[1:21:32] Paul's point is you used to be like this
[1:21:34] God took you out of it why in the world
[1:21:37] are you going back to it in any form or
[1:21:42] fashion sometimes it's not the Habit
[1:21:44] it's the people around the
[1:21:46] Habit we've got to watch who we hang out
[1:21:49] with we've got to watch how we spend our
[1:21:51] time they were in yeah I mean you look
[1:21:53] at that list Church
[1:21:56] fornicators so out of
[1:21:59] wedlock intimacy idolators adulterers so
[1:22:04] married and cheating effeminate
[1:22:06] homosexuals abusers of themselves of
[1:22:08] mankind thieves Covetous drunks
[1:22:11] revilers these were bad people according
[1:22:15] to the law these are the people that
[1:22:18] can't go to heaven but he says you used
[1:22:20] to be this but the spirit of God washed
[1:22:22] you and it Sanctified you and it
[1:22:23] Justified you it did all of these
[1:22:26] things but watch this transition now
[1:22:30] because there's a place where we can
[1:22:31] take Liberty and we can turn it into a
[1:22:34] loophole to do what we want to do to do
[1:22:36] what this flesh wants to do what this
[1:22:38] Fallen nature wants and fall back it
[1:22:40] doesn't change our Soul's condition our
[1:22:42] soul is sealed but this flesh can be
[1:22:44] caught up in these things and watch what
[1:22:47] can happen Paul says this all things are
[1:22:51] lawful unto me he says every is
[1:22:55] permissible everything is allowable for
[1:22:57] me he says but all things are not what
[1:23:02] expedient all in other words all words
[1:23:05] or or all things don't profit me and all
[1:23:08] things don't benefit me I can do
[1:23:11] whatever I want he says but not
[1:23:12] everything's going to help me out he
[1:23:15] says all things are lawful for me but I
[1:23:18] will not be brought under the power of
[1:23:22] any that word that phrase brought not
[1:23:24] under the power of any is actually a
[1:23:26] single word and it means mastered he
[1:23:30] says I will not be Mastered by
[1:23:34] anything in other words if I choose to
[1:23:37] do something then my choice must also
[1:23:40] allow me not to do it and so I am doing
[1:23:43] by choice and I am not doing by choice
[1:23:45] if I take up something and I can't lay
[1:23:48] it down I can't put it
[1:23:50] aside then guess what it has mastered me
[1:23:54] we can like it or we canot like it
[1:23:56] church this morning but if I can't lay
[1:23:58] it down then I have been Mastered by
[1:24:00] something other than the holy spirit in
[1:24:01] this
[1:24:04] flesh if I say I can give it up and yet
[1:24:07] I never put it
[1:24:09] down who's fooling who this guy this guy
[1:24:15] amen I'm back in bondage
[1:24:17] again the the the thing is when I looked
[1:24:19] up this word in the
[1:24:21] scripture all things are not expedient
[1:24:24] or sorry all things uh will not be
[1:24:26] brought under the power of any you know
[1:24:28] where it's used it's used to express the
[1:24:31] virtue of a woman's right to say
[1:24:34] no it's expressing the ability of a
[1:24:37] woman to reject a man's
[1:24:40] advances brother Brown listed three
[1:24:42] virtues of women one of them is the
[1:24:44] right to say no you get to choose who
[1:24:47] your partner is and here this is what
[1:24:49] Paul is saying you get to choose who
[1:24:51] your partner is you get to choose who's
[1:24:53] walking with day by day you get to
[1:24:55] choose the influences that are around
[1:24:57] you you get to choose the habits that
[1:24:58] are around you and he says when it's
[1:25:00] when you've been delivered from those
[1:25:02] things by God's grace don't ever go back
[1:25:04] to it leave it alone what God has clear
[1:25:06] you clearly shown you the answer is no
[1:25:09] to don't ever say yes to it's never
[1:25:11] going to be in his will Paul would set
[1:25:14] the standard here and he would say if
[1:25:17] you can control it and it does not
[1:25:19] affect your walk with God then it's
[1:25:22] between you and God
[1:25:25] but if it affects your walk with God
[1:25:27] your purpose in the kingdom of
[1:25:29] God then now it's not up to you it's not
[1:25:33] a personal choice that's him telling you
[1:25:36] no listen there are some things brother
[1:25:38] Paul can handle that I can't and there
[1:25:40] are some things I can handle that
[1:25:41] brother Paul
[1:25:42] can't there are personal leaderships
[1:25:46] based on strengths and weaknesses of
[1:25:48] this flesh has nothing to do with our
[1:25:50] souls it's purely a flesh matter purely
[1:25:53] a DNA
[1:25:54] matter amen and there are things that we
[1:25:58] ought not to have in our lives I've said
[1:26:00] before I like to use myself as an
[1:26:02] example I can't hang around car people a
[1:26:05] lot because I really enjoy cars and if I
[1:26:08] go to where they're racing them and
[1:26:09] where they're showing them and where
[1:26:10] they're modifying them and all of those
[1:26:12] things guess what I'll get caught up in
[1:26:13] it day to day I don't get caught up in
[1:26:15] it I don't think about cars all day long
[1:26:17] I don't have car magazines coming to the
[1:26:18] house I'm not reading up on them I still
[1:26:21] know a fair bit but it's not something I
[1:26:24] dwell on but if I focus on those things
[1:26:26] then guess what it gets the F the hooks
[1:26:28] into my flesh and pretty soon I'm
[1:26:30] looking on auto trader and Facebook
[1:26:32] Marketplace to see where I can get my
[1:26:33] next sports
[1:26:34] car it's not God leading me to do it
[1:26:36] that's John leading me to do it and it's
[1:26:39] a satanic influence in my life let me
[1:26:41] give you another example do I only read
[1:26:43] Christian
[1:26:44] books no I love historical fiction love
[1:26:48] it I've got book series on Julius Caesar
[1:26:51] The War of the Roses the Crusades uh
[1:26:54] gangas Conan all these things I love to
[1:26:56] read about it I so enjoy it and if it's
[1:26:59] clean guess what it's not a
[1:27:02] problem but the problem is if I'm
[1:27:05] reading novels instead of studying to
[1:27:07] preach guess what I'm under the master
[1:27:09] of the novel if I'm going home and
[1:27:12] reading my book rather than
[1:27:13] fellowshipping with the Saints I'm under
[1:27:15] the mastership of the
[1:27:19] novel if I'm reading the novel instead
[1:27:22] of reading my Bible in the morning for
[1:27:24] tions the novel has mastered brother
[1:27:27] John
[1:27:29] amen I've got three books on my
[1:27:31] nightstand right now and it'll take me
[1:27:32] six months to read them you know why
[1:27:34] because I have higher
[1:27:36] priorities and I might get 30 minutes at
[1:27:38] the end of the day to read something and
[1:27:41] that's about it why because it has no
[1:27:44] Mastery over
[1:27:46] me but I've got to be real careful
[1:27:48] because you can get sucked into it and
[1:27:49] pretty soon you're staying up till 12:30
[1:27:51] at night
[1:27:54] and you're tired the next day and you're
[1:27:55] grumpy and these different things
[1:27:57] Mastery Church there's a liberty in the
[1:28:00] Holy Ghost where he sets us free from
[1:28:03] those things but it's a day-by-day
[1:28:06] battle cuz Satan is always fighting he's
[1:28:10] always presenting he's always giving us
[1:28:12] an opportunity the desire of our soul
[1:28:15] has changed but this flesh is
[1:28:19] unconverted that means there's a battle
[1:28:21] between soul and
[1:28:22] body Paul PA will talk about it this way
[1:28:25] he says for Brethren ye have been called
[1:28:27] unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:28:30] occasion to the flesh that occasion
[1:28:32] means don't use it for an opportunity an
[1:28:34] entrance a starting point he's saying we
[1:28:36] have a choice don't use this for the
[1:28:39] flesh he says but by love serve one
[1:28:43] another if you go look at the original
[1:28:45] it doesn't say by love it says but by
[1:28:47] the Love This is aapo Love This Is The
[1:28:51] Love of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:55] this is not friendship this is Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost leadership love amen but by the
[1:29:01] love of the Holy Spirit serve one
[1:29:03] another so he's saying don't use Liberty
[1:29:05] for the flesh use Liberty to serve one
[1:29:08] another doesn't that take it into a
[1:29:10] whole different perspective Church
[1:29:12] doesn't that take the whole personal
[1:29:13] Liberty out of it he's saying if you've
[1:29:16] got freedom use it for the person next
[1:29:18] to you if you've got opportunity use it
[1:29:20] for the person next to you if you're
[1:29:22] allowed to do whatever you want want do
[1:29:24] it for the benefit of the brothers and
[1:29:26] sisters that are gathered around
[1:29:28] you Paul takes all the selfishness out
[1:29:31] of Liberty Paul takes all the personal
[1:29:33] rights out of Liberty and he says
[1:29:35] whatever Liberty you've got use it for
[1:29:38] somebody
[1:29:40] else we're talking about Liberty O
[1:29:44] lools Paul's saying you can make a
[1:29:47] personal choice here and you have a
[1:29:49] personal choice how you use your free
[1:29:51] time how you use your free money how you
[1:29:54] use your free
[1:29:56] energy how you use your mind how you use
[1:29:59] the skills God's given you and they're
[1:30:02] all an opportunity for you to either
[1:30:03] help yourself or help
[1:30:09] others so many professing Christians
[1:30:13] today we're trying to walk with God and
[1:30:16] keep ourselves safe we're trying to walk
[1:30:19] with God keep ourselves comfortable
[1:30:22] trying to walk with God stay pick our
[1:30:24] own entertainment and music trying to
[1:30:26] walk with God always feel
[1:30:29] secure try and walk with God and do
[1:30:32] things my
[1:30:34] way because that's what Satan's trying
[1:30:36] to get us to do hold on to some
[1:30:39] semblance of control and
[1:30:42] power that's not a walk with God church
[1:30:45] that's a ride in my car with Satan
[1:30:48] sitting shotgun and God coming up to my
[1:30:50] door from time to time when I ask him
[1:30:51] for something we want to have our cake
[1:30:53] in need it too we want to have enough of
[1:30:56] God's will in our life that we feel
[1:30:59] secure but enough control of our own
[1:31:03] pathway that we feel we have some
[1:31:08] input that's not the way of the believer
[1:31:11] never has been Jesus said take up your
[1:31:16] cross this is not a walk in the park
[1:31:19] it's not easy it's not always fun this
[1:31:23] flesh will not find it enjoyable amen
[1:31:26] hey let me put it bluntly for this walk
[1:31:29] Jonathan klette can't come out the other
[1:31:31] end he's got to die this guy has to die
[1:31:35] he has to die in this walk with God CU
[1:31:39] in the end the only thing that can come
[1:31:40] out is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:31:42] today and forever that's the only goal
[1:31:44] we ought to have is Let Jesus be seen
[1:31:47] let this one die amen listen I've got to
[1:31:49] start it with him but he's got to finish
[1:31:51] it and it's got to be all him and none
[1:31:53] of me by the end of it look what Jesus
[1:31:56] said he said If any man will come after
[1:31:58] me let him deny himself you've got
[1:32:01] Liberty you got a choice he says let him
[1:32:04] deny
[1:32:05] himself take up his cross
[1:32:10] uhoh
[1:32:12] no daily really daily take up his cross
[1:32:17] daily and follow me not lead me not tell
[1:32:22] me what to do follow
[1:32:25] me there's a choice and it's a daily
[1:32:28] Choice it's a daily walk not just
[1:32:31] Wednesday nights not just s Sunday
[1:32:34] mornings it's not a part-time
[1:32:36] Christianity it's an all day everyday
[1:32:38] Christianity he says for whosoever will
[1:32:41] save his life shall lose it but
[1:32:43] whosoever shall lose his life for my
[1:32:46] sake the same shall save it brother Bram
[1:32:48] says this he says you stay with the word
[1:32:50] and it makes it power Jesus Christ the
[1:32:52] same yesterday today and for forever
[1:32:54] Jesus said in St John 14:12 he that
[1:32:57] believeth in me the works that I do
[1:32:59] shall he do also and if he abide in me
[1:33:01] and my word in you you can ask what you
[1:33:03] will and it shall be done unto you he
[1:33:05] says what is it you've got to get with
[1:33:07] the word and get yourself killed out he
[1:33:10] says I'm persuaded that many of us
[1:33:12] friends have received the Holy Ghost but
[1:33:15] we just receive enough holy ghost in us
[1:33:17] to make us to a place where we don't
[1:33:19] want to lie we don't want to steal we
[1:33:22] don't want to do anything
[1:33:24] that's a starting place he says but God
[1:33:28] wants to fill every fiber of his church
[1:33:31] he wants to fill your thinking and he
[1:33:33] wants to fill your mind he wants to fill
[1:33:36] every bit of you just make you
[1:33:38] completely totally dead to yourself or
[1:33:42] to your thinking just so surrendered in
[1:33:44] God till his word just living right
[1:33:46] through you he says you don't know
[1:33:48] nothing else but God's word just stay
[1:33:51] right with his word it is life
[1:33:54] my words are life said Jesus we are not
[1:33:56] to rely upon human reasonings Proverbs
[1:33:59] the 3r chapter the 5ifth verse said lean
[1:34:01] not on the upon thine own understanding
[1:34:04] don't do it no matter what God's word
[1:34:06] seems like you say well it seems it's
[1:34:08] just as good this way that isn't what it
[1:34:11] is it's God's word take it the way he
[1:34:14] said it We Believe It Or we don't
[1:34:18] believe
[1:34:20] it he said God said so let's stay with
[1:34:22] it
[1:34:26] he's he's drawing a line
[1:34:28] church either we believe or we
[1:34:33] don't James said show me your faith by
[1:34:36] your Works show me what you believe by
[1:34:38] how you act if we say we believe it and
[1:34:41] we don't do it then do we really believe
[1:34:44] it we were fellowshipping the other day
[1:34:46] again with brother Vel sister Becky and
[1:34:48] he was talking you know how how a
[1:34:50] particular Indian religion over there
[1:34:52] they don't believe in Kill anything
[1:34:54] really they don't believe in in eating
[1:34:56] animals they don't believe in you can't
[1:34:57] kill a spider or a bug or anything and
[1:34:59] my wife said well what if you get
[1:35:00] termites in your
[1:35:01] house and he said well in that case we
[1:35:04] would have to kill the
[1:35:05] termites and of course me being me I
[1:35:07] said that seems pretty hypocritical to
[1:35:10] me he said well it's an existential
[1:35:13] problem it's them or
[1:35:16] us and so we choose us we don't enjoy it
[1:35:19] but we choose
[1:35:21] us and and the thing that came to me by
[1:35:24] God's grace is I stopped and I said do
[1:35:27] we ever do
[1:35:29] that see we're not here to point fingers
[1:35:33] we're here to point
[1:35:36] fingers and say do I suffer from this
[1:35:39] problem and so we started to talk about
[1:35:42] this and I said do we as as Christians
[1:35:44] do we stand on a principle of the word
[1:35:47] and then lay the principle down when
[1:35:49] things get too uncomfortable when things
[1:35:51] get too personal when they start to
[1:35:52] impact our life our finances our health
[1:35:55] our relationship our
[1:35:56] family and unfortunately the qu the
[1:35:59] answer we came up with our testimony was
[1:36:05] yes not you you
[1:36:08] say well for us the answer was yes and
[1:36:11] we started talking about it not always
[1:36:14] yes but occasionally yes we lay down the
[1:36:18] word for the sake of ourselves for our
[1:36:20] comfort for whatever it might be and the
[1:36:22] only way we do that church is if we stop
[1:36:25] believing in the full effect of the word
[1:36:28] that's the only reason we'd ever go
[1:36:29] against it is we don't feel the word is
[1:36:31] going to do what the word says we
[1:36:33] started talking about Daniel when he
[1:36:35] went to Babylon and when Daniel went to
[1:36:37] Babylon he did not go as a free man he
[1:36:39] went as a captive to the king's table he
[1:36:42] was part of the royal household in in
[1:36:44] Israel he was one of the the greatest
[1:36:46] young men he had Prestige he had
[1:36:47] education he'd been taught the word of
[1:36:49] God but now he's a slave in Babylon he
[1:36:52] has no expectation of being able to
[1:36:54] worship God the way to live the life
[1:36:56] that he was taught to live he had no
[1:36:58] expectation of them respecting his
[1:37:00] religion or them recognizing his God but
[1:37:03] yet it says in Daniel chapter 1 yet but
[1:37:06] Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:37:09] would not defile himself with the
[1:37:11] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[1:37:13] wine which he drank therefore he
[1:37:15] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[1:37:16] he might not defile himself in other
[1:37:18] words Daniel established one principle
[1:37:21] whatever I can do to stay with the word
[1:37:23] I'm going to stay with the
[1:37:25] word Daniel couldn't celebrate the
[1:37:29] feasts Daniel couldn't go to the temple
[1:37:32] but what Daniel could do is keep himself
[1:37:34] from what the King was offering so where
[1:37:37] he truly had control he purpose in his
[1:37:40] heart I'm going to maintain control I'm
[1:37:42] going to stay with the word of God
[1:37:44] church if we're looking for loopholes we
[1:37:45] can find them if you if you're in
[1:37:48] Daniel's position all the loopholes
[1:37:50] you're looking for to say there's no way
[1:37:52] I can serve God way I ought to Daniel
[1:37:55] could have went and the three Hebrew
[1:37:57] children with them could have went the
[1:37:58] way of all the thousands of others that
[1:38:00] came over cuz what did they take they
[1:38:02] took the
[1:38:02] loophole they said we don't have a
[1:38:07] choice we're captives we're slaves who
[1:38:10] are we to tell them what we're going to
[1:38:12] do we can come to a place where our
[1:38:14] finances are threatened where our
[1:38:16] retirement's threatened where our job is
[1:38:18] threatened our career is threatened
[1:38:19] where our grades are threatened where
[1:38:21] our health is threatened and we back
[1:38:23] down and we say far enough I've taken
[1:38:26] the word this far I'm not going any
[1:38:28] further and we back down and we let
[1:38:30] circumstances and situations push us
[1:38:32] back Daniel didn't allow that Daniel
[1:38:35] said I'm not
[1:38:37] moving I'm not
[1:38:39] moving but in in fellowshipping around
[1:38:42] this question we are talking about where
[1:38:43] do we tend to fold like a cheap lawn
[1:38:45] chair and it's almost always around
[1:38:49] finances work and family
[1:38:53] cuz family's
[1:38:54] personal and there's a natural
[1:38:56] connection there we all need
[1:38:59] money and the job is the way to get it
[1:39:02] and so that's where we tend to fall down
[1:39:04] we'll do whatever it takes to preserve
[1:39:06] our income because we need money to live
[1:39:10] we'll do whatever it takes to preserve
[1:39:11] health because we need to be healthy
[1:39:13] amen and we'll skip our family time
[1:39:15] we'll skip our church time we'll skip
[1:39:17] our devotions time we'll skip all sorts
[1:39:19] of things but we won't skip
[1:39:22] work why because I need my
[1:39:25] money brother Matt was talking to me
[1:39:27] before service he attributed this to
[1:39:28] brother Gerald saying it maybe he did I
[1:39:30] don't know I don't I wasn't here for it
[1:39:32] but he said don't push your Ox in the
[1:39:34] ditch on Saturday so you can get it out
[1:39:36] on
[1:39:37] Sunday see too many times we're willing
[1:39:40] to sacrifice our time with God but not
[1:39:42] our time for our family Saturday is my
[1:39:45] day off I'll do my work on
[1:39:50] Sunday I'm not trying to be extreme here
[1:39:53] we need money to survive but Jesus said
[1:39:56] seek ye
[1:39:58] first
[1:39:59] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:40:03] righteousness and all these things will
[1:40:05] be added to
[1:40:07] you you talk about the lies he say look
[1:40:10] if he if he takes care of the lies if he
[1:40:12] takes care of The
[1:40:14] Sparrows how much more are you his
[1:40:16] children but we've got to let the word
[1:40:19] stand for us rather than our will and
[1:40:22] our way in these different things we've
[1:40:24] got a word promise that's fighting for
[1:40:27] preeminence against our employer demands
[1:40:29] against our financial requirements
[1:40:31] against our family
[1:40:33] expectations and the only way we can get
[1:40:36] a word promise is if we stay with it if
[1:40:38] we stand therefore in the Liberty where
[1:40:41] Christ has set you free He Set You Free
[1:40:44] from trying to do it yourself so that
[1:40:46] you could stand on the word and let him
[1:40:48] do it for
[1:40:49] you so that you'd have a promise to
[1:40:51] stand on rather than your own skills
[1:40:53] your own reputation your own work ethic
[1:40:55] your own whatever it might
[1:40:58] be and now we can stand on a word that
[1:41:00] never fails cuz guess what I'll fail
[1:41:02] every time and you will to
[1:41:04] eventually you notice here Daniel never
[1:41:08] insisted what Daniel said is Lord I'm
[1:41:12] going to do what I can
[1:41:14] do and so Daniel went and in faith he
[1:41:18] asked it says he requested can I not eat
[1:41:22] the food
[1:41:23] can I hold myself apart I'm a Christian
[1:41:26] you see I can't do these sorts of things
[1:41:29] but here's what I can do will you give
[1:41:32] me some some
[1:41:34] favor see too many times we don't want
[1:41:37] to explain why and so we just bend
[1:41:41] over Daniel said I'm a Believer I can't
[1:41:45] eat this type of food here's the kind of
[1:41:47] food I can eat it's cheaper it's easier
[1:41:50] it's readily available if you'll give me
[1:41:52] this then see how it works out for
[1:41:55] you and after 10 days what did they find
[1:41:57] that he was healthier he was smarter he
[1:41:59] was brighter and so were the three
[1:42:00] Hebrew children and so they continue to
[1:42:02] let them live according to the dictates
[1:42:04] of their
[1:42:05] heart we've told the story many times
[1:42:07] brother codre digs talks tells it about
[1:42:09] that young man that was living in a town
[1:42:11] and he had a great job with a great
[1:42:13] employer good paying in a place where
[1:42:15] good paying jobs were hard to come by
[1:42:17] and they called him into the office and
[1:42:19] they and they said we're changing your
[1:42:21] shift from a day shift to a night shift
[1:42:24] you'll have to work evenings now 5 days
[1:42:26] a week and he said that's fine but I
[1:42:29] can't work on Wednesdays cuz I go to
[1:42:31] church on
[1:42:32] Wednesdays and they said we're sorry but
[1:42:34] it's all the nights or or we'd have to
[1:42:37] let you
[1:42:38] go now Church here's the thing they
[1:42:41] thought they had him over the
[1:42:43] barrel but he's a Son of God this world
[1:42:47] never has us over a
[1:42:49] barrel and he said then you can f me
[1:42:53] because I go to church on Wednesday
[1:42:55] nights but here's the thing Church he's
[1:42:58] a Son of God he's the best worker
[1:43:00] they've got they can't afford to lose
[1:43:03] him but Satan was trying to make him
[1:43:06] think you've got no choice and he said
[1:43:08] I've got a choice I'm a Child of God my
[1:43:11] God my father owns a cattle on a
[1:43:13] thousand hills what am I worried about
[1:43:15] he says you're going to have to fire me
[1:43:17] you know what they did they sheepishly
[1:43:18] came back to him and they said uh what
[1:43:20] time does your church start he says you
[1:43:22] know 7:00 but I need to be there 30
[1:43:24] minutes beforehand so 6:30 they said how
[1:43:26] long does it take uh it takes me about
[1:43:27] 30 minutes okay so they said you got to
[1:43:29] leave by 600 he said yes he said they
[1:43:32] said what time do you have to be back he
[1:43:33] says no no no no I'll I I don't know it
[1:43:36] changes constantly cuz they were trying
[1:43:39] to lock him down he says I'm not locking
[1:43:40] down I'm going to stay in church as long
[1:43:42] as church is open so what in the end
[1:43:44] what they did is they said listen when
[1:43:46] it's time for you to go to church you go
[1:43:49] to church don't clock out don't tell
[1:43:51] anybody just go to church and when
[1:43:54] church is done you come back and work
[1:43:55] again and in the end he got paid to go
[1:43:58] to church in perpetuity because he
[1:44:01] refused to bow down to the
[1:44:03] circumstance he knew he was a child of
[1:44:06] God and he stood on the word and he said
[1:44:09] though it hurt my family though it hurt
[1:44:10] my bank account though it caused me some
[1:44:13] pain I'm going to stand here because as
[1:44:15] a child of God I'd rather have him than
[1:44:17] anything you could offer
[1:44:19] me church that's the Liberty we're
[1:44:22] talking about out he could have taken
[1:44:24] the loophole I got a mortgage to pay I
[1:44:26] got insurance to pay I got a car to pay
[1:44:29] down but he said no I've got a Rapture
[1:44:32] to make I've got a body to support I've
[1:44:35] got a word that's been hand prepared for
[1:44:38] me every service I ain't missing
[1:44:41] it and he said I'm going to take God's
[1:44:44] way and in the end they had to come in
[1:44:46] line with the word because he stayed in
[1:44:49] the path that God had showed
[1:44:51] him that's the Liberty we have this
[1:44:53] morning church you cannot outgive God
[1:44:57] you can't out trust God you can't out
[1:44:59] bless God he has no unpaid debts no
[1:45:03] unpaid debts amen whether it's Daniel or
[1:45:06] this brother in this story there's one
[1:45:08] thing they knew they knew where power
[1:45:10] was remember what Jesus said he's
[1:45:13] standing before Pilate pilate says don't
[1:45:15] you know that I have power to kill you
[1:45:17] to crucify you or set you free and Jesus
[1:45:19] says oh no you only have power if it's
[1:45:22] given to you from from
[1:45:24] above he wasn't
[1:45:26] cowed why because he knew you can't
[1:45:29] touch me unless God allowed
[1:45:31] it it's no different for
[1:45:33] us listen God can bless you above what
[1:45:36] you can never ask or think if you'll
[1:45:37] stay with
[1:45:42] him brah says if we stayed close to God
[1:45:45] and loved him and just kept living for
[1:45:47] him and not trying to push things over
[1:45:49] not trying to make it happen not trying
[1:45:52] to force it he says just live for God
[1:45:55] and live a pure holy life and live and
[1:45:57] pray every day keep yourself refreshed
[1:46:01] in his presence God will take care of
[1:46:04] the rest of it he will adopt the people
[1:46:07] into his own beloved body the church and
[1:46:09] when the Rapture comes you'll be found
[1:46:11] without a blemish because you're living
[1:46:13] in the presence of the King Church I'm
[1:46:16] here to say this morning it's time we
[1:46:18] started recognizing the Liberty that
[1:46:20] Christ has given us that when we stay
[1:46:23] with the word when we stay in his
[1:46:25] presence when we give him the
[1:46:27] preeminence there's nothing he won't do
[1:46:29] for
[1:46:30] us
[1:46:32] amen our Liberty is resting completely
[1:46:35] in what he said not in what I've
[1:46:37] determined not in what I can do listen
[1:46:41] some of us have enough gifts to make
[1:46:44] things happen to a certain level but
[1:46:46] I'll tell you when I've stayed with God
[1:46:47] he's done he's given me favor Beyond
[1:46:49] favor he's given me opportunity Beyond
[1:46:51] opportunity and he's met my every need
[1:46:55] and isn't that really what we're here
[1:46:56] for I'm not here for my wants I'm here
[1:46:58] for my needs cuz that's what he promised
[1:47:00] every need supplied that's what we're
[1:47:02] trusting in I don't have to have a
[1:47:05] mansion I think by age I've got the
[1:47:07] oldest vehicles in the church but guess
[1:47:09] what they keep on
[1:47:10] ticking we're good with it we're not
[1:47:13] here for wants we're here to make a
[1:47:15] Rapture we're here to get out of this
[1:47:16] life
[1:47:17] amen not here to have a fun and
[1:47:19] enjoyable life as much as that is nice
[1:47:21] to have from time to time hey I enjoyed
[1:47:23] getting a week off of studying every
[1:47:25] single night almost that was a nice
[1:47:27] break for me but guess what funny thing
[1:47:30] is you only get so much of a break and
[1:47:31] then things start coming in and you got
[1:47:33] to go down you got to start writing it
[1:47:34] down anyways you can't get away from who
[1:47:35] you are you can't get away from who you
[1:47:37] are as a Believer you try and take a
[1:47:39] break and guess what God will still work
[1:47:41] on you God will work on you whether
[1:47:42] you're you're skiing whether you're
[1:47:44] snowmobiling or ice fishing or sitting
[1:47:46] down by your fire reading a book God's
[1:47:49] going to keep working with us one way
[1:47:50] amen but we can't get a testimony
[1:47:53] if we keep backing
[1:47:54] down at some point we've got to stand up
[1:47:58] stand therefore in the Liberty that he's
[1:48:00] given us by his word and say I'm not
[1:48:02] moving I'm not moving do what you want
[1:48:05] say what you want do your worst I'm
[1:48:09] going to stand here because I'm looking
[1:48:10] for the testimony of the word in my life
[1:48:12] you know what Satan does Satan's a
[1:48:15] magnifier he magnifies your flaws to
[1:48:18] yourself and he magnifies your flaws to
[1:48:21] me
[1:48:23] oh every one of us has
[1:48:25] flaws even our elders even even our
[1:48:28] venerable Pastor brother
[1:48:31] Gerald he has flaws from the oldest to
[1:48:34] the youngest we've got flaws Satan
[1:48:36] magnifies the situation and he says what
[1:48:40] if what's going to happen if you don't
[1:48:42] do what they want you to do what's going
[1:48:44] to happen if you don't work the way they
[1:48:45] want to work what's going to happen if
[1:48:46] you don't study the way they want you to
[1:48:47] study what's going to happen if you say
[1:48:49] the things they don't want you to say
[1:48:54] there's
[1:48:55] consequences but there's good
[1:48:57] consequences too because faith comes
[1:48:59] behind and faith says not what if
[1:49:03] when when God backs up his word when God
[1:49:07] does what he
[1:49:09] said and what does it do it points us to
[1:49:11] the grace of God it points us to the
[1:49:12] blood of Jesus Christ it points us to
[1:49:14] the power of the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:49:15] this word to a reality in our life and
[1:49:17] says how are you going to feel then when
[1:49:20] he does what he promised to do
[1:49:25] his promise was I'll never leave you or
[1:49:26] forsake you and if you'll confess me
[1:49:28] before men I'll confess you before my
[1:49:30] Father in
[1:49:32] Heaven says it this way we're getting
[1:49:34] close he says times may be hard God has
[1:49:37] not promised a flowery bed of ease
[1:49:40] but but's usually a bad thing this is a
[1:49:43] great thing he says but he has promised
[1:49:45] Grace sufficient for every trial that
[1:49:48] can hit you that's right yes indeed
[1:49:50] grace is sufficient not on a flowery bed
[1:49:52] of ease but he has promised Grace to
[1:49:54] overcome in every Temptation when a
[1:49:56] cross gets heavy Christ promised to be
[1:49:59] with you Church we've got a fully open
[1:50:01] word we in the end time of end times
[1:50:04] it's time we stop making excuses there
[1:50:07] is no reason to make an excuse for why
[1:50:09] we can't live by the word this morning
[1:50:11] time we stop giving our reasons it's
[1:50:12] time we start just saying Lord let your
[1:50:14] word do what it says it will do let me
[1:50:18] stay with it and let him sort out the
[1:50:21] details Paul says for all the laww
[1:50:24] remember he said use your Liberty for
[1:50:25] occasion to serve one another for all
[1:50:28] the law is fulfilled in one word even in
[1:50:30] this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:50:31] thyself so if we're going to be
[1:50:33] legalistic about one thing this is it
[1:50:36] love your brother and sister the way you
[1:50:37] love yourself treat your brother and
[1:50:39] sister the way you treat yourself give
[1:50:41] Grace to your brother and sister the way
[1:50:43] that you receive
[1:50:45] Grace give them the benefit of the doubt
[1:50:48] the way you hope that they're giving you
[1:50:50] amen
[1:50:53] he says but if ye bite and devour one
[1:50:56] another take heed that ye be not
[1:50:58] consumed one of another he's saying if
[1:51:00] you're going to use that Liberty for
[1:51:01] yourself watch out because it'll turn
[1:51:03] you against the people that are around
[1:51:04] you and you'll destroy the Fellowship of
[1:51:07] the Saints in your Liberty because
[1:51:10] you're looking for loopholes to think
[1:51:12] feel and act the way you want
[1:51:16] to he says this I say then walk in the
[1:51:19] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[1:51:21] of the flesh Paul's Paul's emphasizing
[1:51:23] one thing here if you're led by the
[1:51:26] spirit the flesh ain't G to like
[1:51:28] it I'm full of good news this morning
[1:51:30] aren't I get ready for the flesh not to
[1:51:33] like
[1:51:35] this it's
[1:51:37] impossible to be H having your fleshly
[1:51:40] desire satisfied and be led by the
[1:51:41] spirit he says for the flesh lusteth
[1:51:44] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:51:47] against the Flesh and these are contrary
[1:51:49] the one to the other so that you cannot
[1:51:51] do the things that you would remember
[1:51:52] what Paul said in Romans 7 he says when
[1:51:54] I would do good evil is present there's
[1:51:55] always this budding heads between what's
[1:51:57] in your soul and what's in your
[1:51:59] flesh and it's a constant battle he says
[1:52:02] but if ye be led of the spirit ye are
[1:52:05] not under the law he says now the works
[1:52:09] of the flesh are made manifest catch
[1:52:11] this now the flesh has works the spirit
[1:52:14] has
[1:52:15] fruit the flesh you can see what's going
[1:52:17] on the spirit you can't all you see is
[1:52:19] what it's done he says he says the works
[1:52:23] of the flesh are manifest which are
[1:52:25] these okay this is what he's talking
[1:52:27] about to Believers now professing
[1:52:31] Believers adultery fornication
[1:52:34] uncleanness lasciviousness and we all
[1:52:36] said we don't do that we're good
[1:52:39] everybody's good this morning right no
[1:52:41] adulterers
[1:52:42] here or the Kings these
[1:52:45] nodding we're good all right let's move
[1:52:48] on to the next one idolatry do we have
[1:52:49] any idolators here this morning
[1:52:53] oh I I think we
[1:52:55] might remember it's not bowing down to
[1:52:58] ba or mik or Kosh it's putting anything
[1:53:02] ahead of God's
[1:53:05] word but listen to this remember what
[1:53:07] Samuel said he says stubbornness is
[1:53:10] viewed the same as idolatry by God now
[1:53:14] do we have any stubborn people this
[1:53:17] morning hey I'm stubborn aren't I Blanca
[1:53:22] she not I'm stubborn guess what it has
[1:53:26] to
[1:53:28] die it has to
[1:53:30] die see we read these scriptures and we
[1:53:33] put it on everybody
[1:53:35] else I'm trying to put you in there with
[1:53:38] me not to make us bad to set us free if
[1:53:42] we can't see we're entangled how can we
[1:53:45] be set free my way or the highway line
[1:53:48] up behind me let's get set free this
[1:53:50] morning let's move on to witchcraft any
[1:53:53] witches or Wizards here this
[1:53:57] morning Samuel
[1:54:00] said
[1:54:02] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft in
[1:54:05] God's
[1:54:06] eyes what is rebellion refusing to
[1:54:09] follow the leadership of
[1:54:13] God I have a feeling we've all done
[1:54:16] that maybe not today maybe not yesterday
[1:54:21] but at some point
[1:54:22] we stop short or what do we do we do
[1:54:26] what he said
[1:54:27] plus or minus just a little bit and that
[1:54:30] was Saul's failing was he would only go
[1:54:32] so far with God's
[1:54:37] will hatred
[1:54:40] variance
[1:54:41] emulations wrath Strife seditions we
[1:54:45] would never do these things what about
[1:54:47] heresies any Heretics this morning
[1:54:53] Heretics are groups of people with
[1:54:56] similar opinions and
[1:55:00] ideas it's not about the word it's about
[1:55:03] what they
[1:55:04] think and you can have groups of people
[1:55:06] inside a church inside this message that
[1:55:09] have a way that they think and they
[1:55:11] preach it a certain way and they do it a
[1:55:13] certain way and if you don't believe it
[1:55:14] their way then you're out what are they
[1:55:17] Heretics because it's about them it's
[1:55:19] not about the word it's about their
[1:55:21] portion of the word word that they
[1:55:22] picked rather than the entire word
[1:55:26] Heretics
[1:55:28] envin my we would never have that in a
[1:55:31] church
[1:55:33] absolutely why does so- and so get to do
[1:55:35] this why does so and so have this why do
[1:55:36] they have a bigger house why do they
[1:55:38] have a nicer car why do they have a
[1:55:39] better job why they have a prettier
[1:55:42] wife why do they always get this why do
[1:55:45] I always get that
[1:55:49] envyings murders brother Braham says you
[1:55:52] can murder a man's
[1:55:53] character and never touch
[1:55:56] him drunkenness I pray to God we don't
[1:55:59] have drunkenness revelings and such like
[1:56:02] of the which I tell you before as I've
[1:56:04] also told you in time past that they
[1:56:06] which do such things shall not inherit
[1:56:08] the kingdom of God it's all works of the
[1:56:11] flesh it's under the influence of a who
[1:56:13] and that who is Satan amen Paul's making
[1:56:16] it clear you can't be led by the Holy
[1:56:18] Spirit and be doing these
[1:56:20] things but watch this he says but the
[1:56:22] fruit of the spirit remember the flesh
[1:56:25] is a doer the spirit is a
[1:56:27] producer the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:56:31] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:56:33] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:56:36] against such he says there is no law in
[1:56:38] other words you can't have too much of
[1:56:41] this you can't have too much
[1:56:44] love you can have too much filio love
[1:56:48] you can love your children too much
[1:56:50] where you don't correct them but this is
[1:56:52] not when it says love there it is not
[1:56:54] filio it is
[1:56:55] agapo that's Holy Spirit love which
[1:56:59] covers the whole gamut of these things
[1:57:01] amen you can have never too much of AG
[1:57:03] goppo love you can never be too patient
[1:57:06] you can never be too faithful you can
[1:57:08] never be too Meek you can never deal
[1:57:11] with somebody too
[1:57:13] much cuz God's longsuffering with us and
[1:57:16] if that's the way he is with us that's
[1:57:18] the way we need to be with each
[1:57:20] other what's Paul saying he's saying
[1:57:22] your Liberty is letting him produce
[1:57:24] himself in
[1:57:27] you letting God do what he said he was
[1:57:29] going to do it's a letting go and
[1:57:31] letting God have his way rather than a
[1:57:33] holding on and having my way that's what
[1:57:36] this
[1:57:37] produces he says and they that are in
[1:57:41] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:57:43] affections and lust crucifixion was
[1:57:46] considered the most agonizing death and
[1:57:48] guess what church we're in the same
[1:57:50] place this body
[1:57:52] has to die an agonizing slow
[1:57:56] death and with it my thoughts and my
[1:57:59] opinions and my preferences and my
[1:58:02] rights and my emotions and all those
[1:58:04] things and guess what it's every single
[1:58:07] day it happens crucifixion takes time to
[1:58:11] die and it ain't no fun but he says we
[1:58:14] do
[1:58:15] it we choose it we put ourselves here we
[1:58:20] crucify the affections and the us and he
[1:58:23] says if we live in the spirit let us
[1:58:25] also walk in the spirit he says if we're
[1:58:27] saying we are alive by the Holy Spirit
[1:58:30] if we're saying we have the new birth
[1:58:31] then our eyes ought to reflect the life
[1:58:33] that's in us because if it's these other
[1:58:35] things and not the fruit of the spirit
[1:58:37] then something else has entangled us and
[1:58:38] we've lost the picture
[1:58:41] somewhere as we start to close this
[1:58:44] morning I've been a little long I've got
[1:58:47] a one scripture and a set of quotes I
[1:58:49] want to share with you
[1:58:52] and so often we
[1:58:54] preach really with the expectation that
[1:58:56] nobody's
[1:58:58] here nobody's dealing with this nobody's
[1:59:00] suffering from this but what if we have
[1:59:02] been entangled what if we're sitting
[1:59:04] here this morning and we're tied up in
[1:59:05] our emotions we're tied up in bitterness
[1:59:08] we're tied up in a habit that we thought
[1:59:09] we kicked we're tied up in a
[1:59:11] relationship we're tied up in
[1:59:12] friendships we we're we're caught in
[1:59:15] something that we used to not be caught
[1:59:16] up in what happens then because Satan
[1:59:20] will magnify that and he'll try and turn
[1:59:23] it into a place where you think you're
[1:59:24] lost and you think you can't get out and
[1:59:27] you think you're not a child of God once
[1:59:29] Satan gets a Toe Hold or a foothold or a
[1:59:31] stronghold his purpose is to make you
[1:59:33] think you can never get him out once
[1:59:35] he's in but that ain't true but he'll
[1:59:38] try and make us think that amen but the
[1:59:40] holy spirit's here by the word of God to
[1:59:42] say no you can go free there's always a
[1:59:44] path made for you watch what David said
[1:59:48] David said where shall I go from your
[1:59:50] spirit and where shall I flee from thy
[1:59:52] presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou
[1:59:55] Art there if I make my bed in hell
[1:59:57] behold Thou Art there if I take the
[2:00:00] wings of the morning and dwell in the
[2:00:02] uttermost parts of the sea even there
[2:00:04] shall thy hand lead me and thy right
[2:00:06] hand shall hold me if I say surely the
[2:00:09] darkness shall cover me I'm never going
[2:00:11] to come out it's too dark it's too far
[2:00:15] I'm too deep into it he says even the
[2:00:18] night shall be light about me you know I
[2:00:22] love the fact David had a heart after
[2:00:25] God's Own Heart the desires of David
[2:00:27] were the same as the desires of God and
[2:00:30] yet David had his down times he had his
[2:00:32] failures he had his failings amen David
[2:00:35] himself had many times where he felt
[2:00:38] lost forsaken
[2:00:41] forgotten wondering why do the Heathen
[2:00:45] Prosper why are they having it so good
[2:00:47] Lord you look at their life and they're
[2:00:49] not doing what I'm
[2:00:50] doing David had moments of total and
[2:00:54] abject compromise and
[2:00:57] surrender David went to the Philistines
[2:01:00] David went to the country and the people
[2:01:03] that he had defeated himself what for
[2:01:06] Comfort he was tired of being chased by
[2:01:10] his own people and so he went to their
[2:01:13] enemy and he tried to get Comfort there
[2:01:15] and what did he reap he reaped a
[2:01:20] whirlwind he never got what he was
[2:01:22] looking
[2:01:23] for David's reality was that God was
[2:01:26] always with him but David's feeling was
[2:01:28] that God had forsaken him so many times
[2:01:30] and it got so things got so tight and he
[2:01:32] got so tightly wound and he couldn't
[2:01:35] release it and so he took matters into
[2:01:37] his own hands and rather than relying on
[2:01:39] the promise of God he relied on his own
[2:01:41] two feet and he took himself to a place
[2:01:43] of comfort and it did nothing for him
[2:01:46] and it took God's grace to get him out
[2:01:49] but God got him out not without some
[2:01:52] moments of angst and worry that's for
[2:01:54] sure as he comes back to his home and
[2:01:56] finds his wife and children and those of
[2:01:58] his men gone and they've got to chase
[2:02:00] after them and get them back but God
[2:02:01] gave him a promise I'll get them back
[2:02:02] for you but this was your doing David
[2:02:06] don't ever forget this don't walk away
[2:02:08] from my promise and my
[2:02:10] word I'm saving you but don't ever do it
[2:02:15] again but if you're caught up this
[2:02:18] morning listen it could be a big thing
[2:02:20] it can be a little thing Church
[2:02:22] you look at your own life this morning
[2:02:24] but don't let Satan tell you you can't
[2:02:27] come back don't let Satan tell you you
[2:02:29] can't win you can't be set free see we
[2:02:32] think God did it once and that's all
[2:02:33] he's obligated to do no God's obligated
[2:02:36] to his word and if you're a part of it
[2:02:37] he'll keep moving until you're out of it
[2:02:39] that's the promise of
[2:02:41] God maybe you're
[2:02:44] weary maybe you're wondering maybe
[2:02:46] you're frustrated listen to this this
[2:02:50] person asked brother Brown they say I
[2:02:51] have lived many years in sin until I
[2:02:54] found the
[2:02:55] Lord praise the Lord then they say I
[2:02:58] have sinned again and I'm not worthy to
[2:03:00] come before you in this holy place
[2:03:02] please tell me if I can be restored
[2:03:04] whole again this person has gotten reang
[2:03:08] they've been entangled again in a yoke
[2:03:10] of bondage they've gone back to where
[2:03:13] they were and Satan has bound them and
[2:03:16] they don't think they can be returned
[2:03:18] brother Ram says yes you have not sinned
[2:03:20] my friend so far in God but what you
[2:03:22] could be restored if you had sinned so
[2:03:25] far that you could not be restored you'd
[2:03:27] never want to be restored but as long as
[2:03:30] there is something dealing with your
[2:03:32] heart you're still in line of
[2:03:35] restoration and then he says these words
[2:03:37] he puts us all on the same Level Church
[2:03:40] guilty of the least is guilty of the
[2:03:42] whole I have sinned many times every day
[2:03:47] every one of us do things that we don't
[2:03:49] want to do that ought to keep us so so
[2:03:52] humble if the prophet of God can say it
[2:03:55] I ought to be able to say it as well
[2:03:57] every day we do we think we act on
[2:04:00] things that we ought not to he says
[2:04:03] there is a place where you can cross
[2:04:04] where you can't get back but when that
[2:04:06] is but when that is you're down there
[2:04:09] again in the same shape you were it goes
[2:04:11] to show that you only Fell From Grace he
[2:04:14] says backsliding is not lost I wanted
[2:04:17] somebody to tell me where backsliding is
[2:04:18] lost and prove it to the Bible he says a
[2:04:20] backslider is is not lost he's just out
[2:04:23] of
[2:04:25] Fellowship he says Israel backslid but
[2:04:28] they never lost their Covenant they lost
[2:04:30] their praises and joy David lost the joy
[2:04:33] of his salvation when he took bash Sheba
[2:04:35] uriah's wife but he never lost his
[2:04:37] salvation he never said restore to me my
[2:04:40] salvation he said restore to me the joy
[2:04:42] of my salvation he says oh there's so
[2:04:44] much of this legalism today the touch
[2:04:46] not taste not he says you don't do
[2:04:49] things legally he says you may think
[2:04:51] you're tied down brother sister that
[2:04:53] wrote this question you may think the
[2:04:55] devil has got you tied down there but
[2:04:58] he's lying there was one time a man came
[2:05:00] to Earth Jesus Christ the son of God and
[2:05:03] he untied you don't you believe it you
[2:05:07] don't have to stay down there no sir
[2:05:09] you're free he died in your place to
[2:05:11] take away your sins you just believe on
[2:05:14] him flop your wings and fly away with
[2:05:16] the rest of them don't stay in that pit
[2:05:18] of the
[2:05:18] devil it's still a choice there's still
[2:05:22] a liberty but we've got to walk in it a
[2:05:24] loophole might have taken us down but
[2:05:26] it's a choice of Liberty that'll take us
[2:05:28] back up again and then this person says
[2:05:31] I have fallen I am sinned I'm dead
[2:05:36] wrong church are all the words of
[2:05:39] somebody that doesn't know who they are
[2:05:42] that's the words of somebody that knows
[2:05:44] exactly who they
[2:05:45] are they said is there a chance for me
[2:05:49] to be whole again he says Absol
[2:05:51] absolutely the minute you desire it that
[2:05:54] shows that God dropped the lifeline down
[2:05:57] to pick you up just rise up on his
[2:05:59] Lifeline of faith and prayer and move
[2:06:01] right on up amen God bless you this
[2:06:04] morning let's stand if we would
[2:06:06] musicians can
[2:06:13] come this is down where we live it's not
[2:06:16] an easy service to
[2:06:19] preach but my point is not to drag us
[2:06:21] down
[2:06:22] down the point is to open our eyes help
[2:06:26] us to be honest with ourselves help us
[2:06:27] to be honest with where we are where our
[2:06:29] walk with God is to look at the things
[2:06:31] we're doing look at the things we're not
[2:06:33] doing and say Lord has something
[2:06:35] entangled me and am I using my Liberty
[2:06:38] to put myself right back into bondage
[2:06:40] again or am I living in the liberty of
[2:06:44] the Holy Ghost where we stay free and we
[2:06:48] live free in the presence of God
[2:06:50] Amen you got an issue this morning he
[2:06:53] can set you free but you've got to be
[2:06:55] able to say I've got an issue this
[2:06:57] person said I have fallen I am sinned
[2:07:01] and I'm dead
[2:07:03] wrong that's the honesty God's looking
[2:07:06] for Lord I made the wrong decision I've
[2:07:08] walked the wrong way I've let something
[2:07:10] back in I've gone back and I put the
[2:07:12] shackles on again and Lord now I need
[2:07:15] you to free me
[2:07:17] again that's what it takes this morning
[2:07:19] is to say I've been entangled in the Yol
[2:07:21] of bondage but I'm coming for the
[2:07:24] liberty of Christ this morning
[2:07:26] amen I'm here to warn you Satan is going
[2:07:30] around as a roaring lion trying to
[2:07:33] devour you young people guard your
[2:07:36] life if he set you free don't walk
[2:07:39] back and if he's kept you from it in the
[2:07:41] first place don't go try it out amen
[2:07:46] it'll bind you it's bound better and
[2:07:48] stronger people than
[2:07:49] you there are mature Christians walking
[2:07:52] around this Earth today Bound in things
[2:07:55] because they won't say I've fallen I've
[2:07:58] tripped up I'm tangled in things that I
[2:08:00] can't break out of and it's going to
[2:08:03] take a move of God it's going to take
[2:08:04] the spirit of God to set them free amen
