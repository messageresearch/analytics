really now I [Music] be all things are now I now I [Music] Hallelujah I all things are possible now I believe amen praise the name of the Lord Lord bless you turn with me to the Book of Proverbs Chapter 3 The Book of Proverbs chapter 3 amen the grace of God to help your servant amen as we get into the message as we get into the scriptures as we get into some thoughts of the Prophet concerning God's leadership in our Our Lives amen not being led by as I said the religious Spirits or the devil not being led by religious thoughts but being led by the by Jesus Christ amen not my will father thine be done in the Book of Proverbs chapter 3 and beginning to read at verse one amen my son forget not my law but many that have started in the word they have forgotten the word regardless of the age regardless of when God come on the scene with his word there was a time when man forgot amen so he said forget not my law or my word but he said let thine art keep my Commandments stay with the word amen for the length of days and long life and peace shall they head to thee amen that's the significance of staying with the word the significance of staying under God's leadership because it is amen the result thereof is length of days and long life and peace and they add to thee Amen Let not mercy and Truth forsake thee because you're ignoring it no the believer is not ignoring the truth the believer is not ignoring Mercy but morning noon and night we are conscious of the grace of God in the mercy and the truth of God so don't forsake his Mercy don't forget his Mercy or his Truth for nobody and for nothing amen but bind them about thy neck Amen to let it lead you to let it control you amen praise the name of the Lord that's why he said bind them above their neck so it's in control it's not you in control it's mercy and Truth praise the name of the Lord it is Mercy and truth that leads us and it says and write them upon the table of thine heart praise the Lord and so shalt thou find favor and good understanding thank God for the word this is not the wisdom of man but this is the wisdom of God Amen and it says in the sight of God and man Thou shalt find or Thou shalt yes find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man but again again go back to the other the other verses to find out how you're going to find favor and good understanding in the sight of God Amen you got to keep it in your mind keep it in your heart to constantly be mindful of what God has done and what God is doing and you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man verse five trust in the Lord with all thine heart not many are trusting God Amen they trust man they trust the thoughts of man the ideas of man but who is trusting God and who's trusting the word brother I pray Grace that we have the faith that God that pleases God so trust in the Lord with all thine art not just a little here and a little there but trust in the Lord with all thine heart Grace and lean not onto thine own understanding and we have too much of that mixture of faith and human understanding amen Faith it's God the human understanding is the devil remembering that God God's is in the heart and the only sense that God uses is Faith but the devil is using the flesh amen and his Watchtower is your mind reasoning amen so trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding be led by the spirit the spirit of God and not the devil in all thy ways in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path in all thy ways acknowledge Him and he'll Lead You Amen in Paths of right rightousness for his name's sake praise the name of the Lord so again in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil God bless his words you may be seated be not wise in thine own eyes but fear the lord and depart from evil because brother that's where the enemy deceived Eve is giving her not godly wisdom but ungodly wisdom he says you shall be as Gods knowing this because it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so they ended up with a wisdom but not the wisdom we needed and thank God for the Plan of Redemption that he's going to take it take us take it away from us amen by by the by the grace of God so God help us brother is our prayer that we're going to partake of the righteousness of God turn with me to Luke Chapter N St Luke's gospel chapter n and beginning to read at verse 57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee withs soever thou goest he said I'll follow your leadership amen and Jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have Nest but the son of man that's not where to lay his head amen he was challenging that brother's Faith to follow him and to follow his leadership because challenging because even maybe that brother's emphasis was on natural things and what what he would possess naturally maybe believing that God was going to bless him if I follow Jesus God was going to bless me more amen but you follow Jesus that maybe God's going to take it away from you amen that's that's that's the what what God does sometimes it is a challenge to our faith so that our faith is not in what we possess our naturally our faith is in what we possess spiritually our faith is not in the Natural Things of life but the spiritual things of life that our faith is not in the devil and what the devil can do and what the devil can give us but our faith is in what God has done and what God is is doing Amen brother the grace of God to have the faith of God Amen the grace of God to have faith in God and he said and Jesus said unto him foxes have holes the birds of the air have Nest but the son of manath not where to lay his head you want to follow somebody like that the idea of man today would that that person is stupid that person does doesn't have any any any any good ideas or any any wisdom if they had wisdom they they wouldn't be in that condition we think well if this brother is good or that sister is good they're going to be out there they're going to get themselves a good job they're going to they're going to have money they're going to have a nice home they're going to have nice clothing and so on but sometimes your brother if you're following God God takes it from from us because what is it it is a test of our faith amen so that we our faith is not in not in world possessions our faith is not in this world and the and what's in this world our faith is in in the world to come our faith is in glory our faith is in eternity our faith is in heaven our faith is in the new Heaven and the new Earth and that is more real to us than the than the one that we are living in now oh brother I pray that I pray that that is true that the new Heaven and the new Earth and Eternity is more real than time and that when what we are experiencing in time but unfortunately there are too many Bel so-called Believers that are living in time and they are living for time and what they are experiencing in time what they find in time what they can see in time but I tell you this brother we're trying to get rid of time and we're trying to get rid of R of the emphasis on what time is giving us what for us so to put more and more emphasis on what what eternity is and what what God in eternity has promised for us amen oh no wonder again uh let me repeat that scripture that straight is the gate now is the way that leadth into life and few there be that find it and it's eternal life so where our focus is not on on natural life our focus is not on this life our focus is on eternal life amen so straight is the gate to eternal life narrow is the way and few there be that find it and we understand and we remember the the dream that the that brother bram's Mother I think his mother had the dream and and in the dream was brother Brandon was standing at at at at the road leading to eternal life amen and and this sister came up and she had on these I heel shoes and the problem of God he said sister he said you can't walk that path he said with those shoes oh yes she said I can and she said that that'll be no problem why the Propet of God said she she didn't see it the way that God wanted her to see it amen and the father of God has has has reminded us of the message he said it's not striking you the way that it should amen amen why why because if it did it would give us the faith that that that God had in it the faith for the Resurrection the faith for healing the faith for salvation the faith to get out of this world and get into the world to come amen but and we got to do it God's way not our way we got to follow God's leadership and not the devil's leadership we got to follow God's leadership by faith and brother it is not the devil's leadership by intellectual reasoning amen but this this sister there with her high heels on and and she stood she stood at the beginning of this road into eternity and there were three steps leading up to the path and she and and it was about I guess maybe 2 or three feet wide right here and and she thought well well if she got way down there it would still be 2 or 3T wide and that she had no problem to go up to the three the three steps of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet of God said no sister you're not going to make it with those shoes on and she said get out of my way and he just he just stepped aside and let her and let her get on the path but he know he knew that she wasn't going to make it he told her he tried to warn her and brother and God is telling us with whether or not we can make it how we can make it or or if we get we get caught up with this we're not going to make it God knows brother and that's what the that's what the ministry is there for is the perfecting of the Saints the perfecting of the Revelation the perfecting of our wisdom and our understanding so it's not human wisdom human understanding it's Godly amen so that we're going to see it as God sees it amen and brother and not and see the thing is this that we're not going to look at the path and say well and we're we're going going to make decisions and we're going to decide this we're going to what is God's leadership and we got to come back to his word to find God's Will and God's leadership what does God want me to do and how does God want me to do it when does he want me to do it where does he want me to do it amen and I don't I don't have to have understanding of it I just have to have the Revelation that it's God Amen I don't Lord why this why that listen Faith believes God Amen not it's not it's not it comes to the understanding of this and why this and why that and why that no it's understanding what it is is it the will of God I'm he's not going to give us understanding of what's going to happen how it's going to happen all these things we just believe God God said with his stripes I am healed well how you do that Lord can you explain that to me well with his word well Lord no can you give me more scientific explanation no no if you got faith fath amen you just believe God and you go on Hallelujah there is too many trying to reason it out there's to many too many trying to figure it out even when it comes to the resurrection and the Rapture even when it comes to the to to to Salvation we want to figure out this and figure out that brother it is not by intellectual knowledge and human understanding it is it is by faith believe God Amen the same as as God required in the Garden of Eden God is requiring now and he said if you do this if you do that he said he said You shall surely die amen well Lord uh explain it to me no God didn't explain it and they didn't ask God to explain it they believed it under the devil came and be to inject his ideas into it and and to inject his thoughts into it amen in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen so brother and sister listen I pray God that none of us are in in this in part of this assembly here across the island I trust that no one are online I trust that nobody is what is going by sight faith not not Faith but sight and reasoning you know what what you what you understand naturally what you figure out I I'm going to do this I'm ain't going to do that amen and and you think it's God's will when it's the devil amen see God never explained it to to Adam and Eve he just told them and they believe God Amen so God is not explaining all that he has done and what he is doing concerning the resurrection Rapture but brother he has told us and and we believe it amen how God how is God going to do it that's God's business amen he he is God it's his power it's his anointing it's a it's the Holy Ghost in US amen now but but again explain it scientifically I don't need it to explain scientifically Amen in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period amen praise the name of the Lord father the Propet of God said he said he said the Bible and true science he said does agree together blend together that's the truth because science things that God took all of this time they they they don't believe the Bible because they they think in the Bible all God took six days to make the make to make the Heaven and the Earth no no Bible didn't say that the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that's right period it didn't say how long he took amen and it could have been it could have been a million years it could have been it could have been six million years we don't know but we know that something happened but then God came down and it took 6,000 years to do what one day with the Lord has a thousand years a thousand years in one day and God be to renew the Earth because it was in this condition in that condition he did this he did this he did this amen and then he created man and put him on the earth amen so true science and the and the true revelation of the word are are in agreement amen so brother we're not we're not looking for the the science of the devil that's what that's what the the devil came down to give it give to Eve Thou shalt not surely die amen and he began to explain this to her and that to her why it it was human knowledge human scientific amen and it was Satan's influence but by the grace of God brother as it was then so it is now when we're not looking with a scientific explanation we're going to believe God Amen as Adam and Eve believe God we believe God as Adam and Eve trusted God or Adam did and so we're going to trust God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen remember Enoch trusted God and believed God and he went on into the resurrection he went Resurrection but on into the Rapture he was changed absolutely and completely amen bless it be the name of the Lord and now we are the seven from the second Adam so brother and sister I trust that we have the faith that Enoch had amen I trust that we believe God as Enoch believ God I trust that we are walking with God as Enoch walked with God not walking with the world not walking with the foolishness of the world but we're walking with God Amen and if we walk with God Hallelujah and the faith of God it it'll bring us separation from the world and the things of the world you're not going to be caught up with the world or the things of the world but you're going to get more and more and more caught up with God more and more caught up with with with the promise of God and and oh brother what is it is getting back where we come fromen amen hallelujah if there anything that I want anything that I need is to get back into eternity is to get back into that new Heaven and new earth it is to get back with God and again and brother and sister all the saints of God in eternity by the grace of almighty God oh it's going to be a wonderful world and we think this world is wonderful oh brother and sister I pray God we're not going to be we're not going to be the ones that are left behind looking for a Rapture that we missed amen but again the people are are enjoying this world more and more they're getting more and more caught up with this world and they're getting more and more caught up with the foolishness of this world and they're putting more and more emphasis on what what is in this world and you know what what the enemy is there trying to make you believe oh this is this is good this is great this is wonderful amen and you know you can do this and still you know believe believe in God yeah but remember this the devil believes in God so believing in God doesn't make you just just believing in God doesn't make you a Christian no no it's believing God it's one thing to believe in God is another thing to believe God Amen so I pray the grace of God help us that we're going to believe God Amen that we're going to stay with the word of God Amen because where we come from we are going back by the grace of almighty God so brother let's father let's stay under his leadership not the leadership of man not the leadership of this world not the leadership of our minds not the leadership of our feelings but we're going to amen amen amen amen oh brother the vast majority and not not just the world over there but the vast majority of believers they they're they're believing in their senses they're believing in their in their intellect they're believing in their reasoning and their feelings but not their faith amen the the the word the word is to them it it is the letter and it is is mechanics but it is not Dynamics amen the word has got to be Dynamics in your life it if it is to lead you it has to be Dynamics power amen anointing in your life not mechanics just the letter of the word and there's too many going by the letter of the message but not the letter of the word amen because because they believe that oh this is this if it's God God is going to bless me if it's God God is going to do this God is going to do that yeah but what God does is going to be according to his word amen not going to be according to to the Natural Things of Life it'll be number one it's going to be spiritual God is going to focus on the spiritual not the natural amen remember it's the devil that focuses on the on the natural and the devil wants us to get caught up with the natural things but God wants to get caught up with the spiritual amen if we're cut up with the spiritual the spiritual is going to catch us up amen into eternity by the grace of God so who are we believing at this moment are we believing God or the devil are we believing in eternity or time are we focused on on time or eternity by the grace of almighty God I trust that it is eternity amen God El was brother to stay with God and to stay under the leadership of God amen amen praise the name of of the Lord the just just bear with me here because I I want to get scripture and I want to get some quotes in and this this was not not the not the message on leadership but it was a message to be certain of God and I thought well maybe Lord we ought to we ought to go and uh and play the tape because it's a tremendous message and he said right here he said now and and to those that that are going through their devotions this was yesterday's devotion Amen in our brother Tim dod's uh book on devotions and this is what he said now he said Brother David was reading out of the book of Kings he said of Elijah the great prophet and Israel was loved of God Amen brother sister we're reading out out of the New Testament and we're reading especially out out of the Book of Revelation amen and and as God loved Israel God loves the bride amen and he said and Elijah he was reading about Elijah and he said Israel was loved of God but he said when they got out of the will of God the enemy took them over amen and you get out of the will of God for your life the devil's going to take you over amen the devil's going to tell you what to do when to do where to do it and how to do it amen and you're going by sight you're going by feelings but you're not going by faith amen as I was saying about Eve in the garden and she went from Faith to sight she went from Faith to feelings she went from Faith to just intellectual reasoning the enemy be to get her to reason over this and to get her to get her from reasoning into her senses and this was you you read this the the devil's revealed to Eve that oh it was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and it was a thing that desired to make one wise and so on so he was he was he was moving on her senses amen God God had given her faith but she moved from her faith to her senses amen and there's people today brother there there are situations and circumstances that occur in your life amen and we move from Faith to to to our to our our senses that's the truth oh yeah and more and more are going by their senses but they're not going by faith one one time believers they live by faith they walk by faith they talk faith and and my Alec in his prayer there concerning the you know the morning and the evening and the night and whatever it was all Faith they they they didn't just think about God when they did a devotion they didn't just think about God when when when they when they said the grace they didn't just think about God you know when when they when they went to bed and said their prayers whatever they just couldn't get away from God they were baptized with the Holy Ghost they they they were one with God one with Christ amen and then and again it wasn't them that was living it was Christ Living in them and if it's Christ Living in you how can you get away from him I don't it doesn't make a difference what you are doing naturally you know or spiritually you know it's Christ you're going to do you're going to follow God's leadership you're going to follow the leadership of Christ in you the hope of glory amen by the grace of God Amen you're not going to go by all intellectual know knowledge and all of that no follow the lord follow his leadership he'll give you the wisdom like like again for the glory of God there are those that says Jo how do you know this how do you know that how do you know something else and all that well it's not me amen you're going to you're going to you're going to have the wisdom that that that that will amaze people amen you're going to have have the leadership that will Amaze others you'll know this you'll know that amen that's why they they'll go to you for counsel they'll go to that person for counsel because why because if they're if they got God in them it's not them it's Christ in them amen it's Christ is giving them the the the leadership oh yeah but again you got to recognize you got to recognize something amen and I said I said as in my life by the grace of God there are those that even even they're worldly people they would they would say listen if you want to know this go ask jalos and so on and and brother that that goes beyond that goes far beyond when it comes to the the the nature of my father or the nature of my mother who who also had well they did have a spiritual experience too amen they did thank God for that as I said I remember seeing my mother in their bedroom and and on her knees and her hands raised up and praying oh yeah I remember that and my father praying and so on and and and they all they always put the emphasis on God all we want the is on the Lord and so on so by the grace of God and and and if our conversations we eventually our conversations always got back to got got to the scriptures always got back to the Lord by the grace of God Amen brother sisters so that's that's the that's the the situation brother I pray God you got an experience with God so the brother I even in your job even in school no matter where it is it's Christ in you amen well and and like I said the the world will recognize it those who are who are working with you will recognize you're a Christian they'll know that that it's that is that it's not you oh that person's different he's a Christian she's a Christian oh yeah oh and and yet there there are those that that so-called Christians that that out there people work for they don't even don't even know that they if they if they go to church that's right let alone being a Christian or thinking as a Christian or acting as a Christian or talking as one but I tell you this if you got a relationship with God you're going to have the leadership of God you're going to have the wisdom of God you're going to have the faith of God Amen so again brother sister those out there the family friends and neighbors they when they're when they're in fellowship with you in contact with you in conversation with you they're in conversation with Jesus amen so it's because it's not you talking it's not you explaining this it's Jesus explaining well this is tremendous this is absolutely tremendous to believe it amen and again people will recognize that in you and again as as I said at one time I went to a school and and I I never got involved in this I never got involved in that I never got involved in that and yet when it when it come to the the the the the graduation and and I I was down there in the audience in the in in the in the school and and it was a religious school of course and then when they when they when they brought it to a conclusion all right they said we're going to ask Gerald to come up and pray me yeah it's like one time one of them said oh Jal you you you don't do anything but we want you to do this for us you don't get involved in this well we want you to do this amen I said okay I'll do it because they knew that I was walking a separated walk unto the Lord amen amen and that's why they the graduation there and and this one got a diploma that one got a diploma they said all right jald we're going to ask you to come up and and pray and for us to go amen I said okay and I went up and prayed not only that I knew that there was a the wife of a teacher there was sick seriously SI cancer and when I was praying for the dismissal of the of the graduation I prayed I said Lord I said I want to remember I said this sister I said in prayer I said the grace of God to her that with your stripes I said she was healed amen and then so then some years later that that we were we were delivering flyers and it so happened that uh at one point I had to deliver on that street some flyers and uh and and and and on that on that street was the was the this teacher and his wife and they knew me and they said we want to thank you for your prayers God answered your prayer amen oh I said praise the Lord I said that's wonderful I said give the glory to Jesus oh he said yes he said but we just want to thank you he said it was wonderful God did answer prayer and I I said praise the Lord amen hallelujah brother I pray God if we were living by faith then and walking by faith now how much more are we to be living by faith and walking by faith how much more are we to be led by faith as it is written in the word of God the sons that by grace through faith are you saved and that not of yourself it is the gift of God it is by grace through faith that we are led by the spirit of God Amen when it comes to Holy Ghost leadership amen it is by the by faith God reveals this and you walk in it God reveals that and you walking it you don't question it you don't reason it you just do it Amen brother again as as Noah there with his ark and he and he went out and built the ark and he didn't ask God for reasoning he just believed God why never rained never ever rained that would that was onard of in in in in that world and and yet God says Noah uh I I'm going to I'm going to destroy the Earth and I'm going to there's going to it's going to rain and it's going to flood the Earth and everything else I want you to build an AR you want me to do what build an AR oh okay and God gave him the instructions to what to do and how to do it amen he he didn't he didn't figure it out himself amen oh well we got to do this we got to do that God said do this do this and he said when you put it all together use this to to stick it together and so on oh my why praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother to oh as it was in the days of Noah he walked with God too praise the name of the Lord and I tell you if we're if if we're like Enoch we're walking with God Amen just and what do he mean he want with God that there was nothing that he did or spoke of without God's leadership in his life amen his SS were under God's control amen his Works were under God's control everything he did was for the glory of God he did the other things natural things but again he didn't do it he did it in the spirit walked in the spirit lived in the spirit by the grace of almighty God God God God God God Amen is Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and many consider it just fanaticism no it's not fanaticism it's eternal life it's the new bir you're born again by the grace of almighty God God God help us brother as he said right here he said David was was reading out of the book of Kings the Elijah the great prophet Israel was loved of God and the briest loved of God but he said when they got out of the will of God the enemy took them over when they when they when they got away from God's leadership I'll tell you this brother sister in the flesh we're in and in these bodies we're in we're the you're not you're not going to go out there independent no no of leadership no no because of of of of the nature of your body the nature of everything you're going to be under the leadership of God or the leadership of the devil amen God going by faith but the devil focusing on your senses ever since the fall now man be before the fall man never had these senses he was going by faith he he was led by faith amen he went and did what God wanted him to do and then in the evening they would go in and fellowship with God Amen they' have that personal relationship with God Amen but after the fall census took over now they had to they had to deal with their minds now they had to deal with their feelings amen after the fall but brother then God sends sends his word to get us to believe give us faith amen so that we're not going to be led by our senses we're going to be led by faith brother all the way down through God has been there with with with with a messenger to give them Faith amen so that they' be led by faith and not by sensus Amen brother sister as I said and he said God loves his church and if you get out of the will of God he said the enemy takes you over and he said God loves his church and he said when when we get out of the will of God the enemy takes the church over that's right and he did that's why we got the mess out there in the churches and that's why we got the mess e the wrong me message churches because why they're out of the will of God that's the truth and he said God loves his church but when we get out of the will of God the enemy takes the church over and he said I was passing down one of your streets here a few days ago and he said I saw a sign in a bar room and it said tables for ladies he said I don't need to be rude and I don't want to get to hurt anyone's feelings but he said ladies don't go into places like that and he said because there's no place for ladies he said fear God keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man fear God keep his command Commandments amen because why it's Faith this is the whole duty of man he said and he said be but he said you see he said King Ahab had said this is all right in Israel he was the leader of Israel but he was saying this was all right that was all right and Elijah the prophet was there uh preaching against it amen and they hated him amen they hated him because the greater majority in in Israel was following ahab's leadership not the prophet's leadership not God's leadership and the prophet but they're following ahab's leadership because ABAB was under the influence of his of his Queen Jezebel amen and she was she was an idolator oh yeah yeah she was she was of a false religion she wasn't a Jew but ABAB went out and he wanted her and he went out and he had or yeah went out and one this one and so on yeah and he said he said he said this is all right because his wife thought it was all right oh he says it right here don't don't mean to be rude or or whatever but he said I got to tell you the truth that's right he did say this is a woman's World sisters if there's anyone that need to beyond their guard and to get into the faith of God is the sisters that's right that's right one time the man reigned and ruled but now the sisters r Reign and Rule and and more and more women are getting involved in in the politics more and more women are getting involved in everything out there yeah well I tell you I pray God in the name of the Lord that our sisters are going to come under the faith of the revealed word amen but AB he said he thought he said because his wife thought it was all right and he he also accepted it amen and Israel accepted it and the vast majority was following it and getting into idolatry and he said they caused a moral Decay and then he said they thought because they were prosperous and he said no Wars no forth and so forth and he said that was the sign that God was with them that's what they thought but what it was they were compromising Jezebel influenced aab to compromise with this compromis with this nation and that nation and this Kingdom and that Kingdom amen allow this in Israel allow that in Israel the UN the influence of Jezebel no one and she hated Elijah yet the power of God said she didn't accept it but he said Elijah was her pastor he said but she wouldn't accept it until finally the prophecy came that the dogs would eat her flesh and it did Amen brother let's stay with the word amen stay with God stay with the the the faith that God has and God is revealing amen amen amen list oh brother sister in the name of the Lord that we're not going to go back as they did in Luther's day W day the Salvation Army day and the Pentecostal age that go back to just a form of godliness yeah but denying the power brother if you're denying the power now you're denying the power of the Resurrection denying the power of the Rapture that's why a lot of people are denying and that's why they're going to miss it they denied the power of justification in Luther's day Wesley's day and and in other ages and the Pentecost denied the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and denying the gifts that's why there's that's gone Amen brother of what it is the influence of another spirit it's the leadership of another Spirit they they got away from God's leadership to man to the to man's leadership and the man was under the influence of the devil Grace it's see now this is serious now you'll prefer maybe a preacher to get up here and make you laugh and and do this do oh yeah that's good we that's what God did we're saved we're this we're that we got to face reality we got to face the challenges of the devil amen so that God so that the devil is not going to deceive us into thinking we're all right when we're not oh yeah you better make sure you're right making your calling and election sure is to make sure you're under the right leadership amen and he says so he said oh he thought it was all right because his wife thought it was all right and he said they thought because they were prosperous and there was no Wars and so forth and he said that was a sign that God was is with them but he said Prosperity is not always understand Prosperity is not always the sign that God is with you many times that's deceiving oh well this worked out and that worked out so it must be the Lord no come back to the word see if you're still in line with the word make sure that there's no compromise but there's many doing it believing well I if I was at the will of God God wouldn't do this no the devil did it the devil did it they don't think go the devil will do this they don't think the devil can do this they think it's only God no devil can prosper you oh yeah he said the prosperity is not all not always the say that God is with you and he said many times that's deceiving why he said the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen but it's their by their fruits they are known amen are you getting more spiritual or more kind that's the difference God help us and so he said this nation was was really corrupted and God sent judgment upon Israel and all the preachers had bent under the heavy load because the members of the church had forced them to do things amen yeah the preachers in Israel the Levites they come under the influence of the people because the the the the force of the people so that what did what did the Levites do they just they just bowed down and said okay and they allowed this and allowed that allowed something else and there's many a message preacher that's allowing this allowing that and brother there there's preachers out there in the in in in in the Lutheran Church and so on that Luther started and they're allowing things Luther would never allow or Wesley would never allow for sure amen or the old fashioned salvations would never allow because I I've got I've got sermons by by the founders of the Salvation Army there back way back in in the late 1800s or early 1900s and and they saw worldliness creeping into the church there and they said sisters what you need to do is you need to start in your closet start your repentance in your closet amen yeah well that's that's what they were preaching because they and and they got to the finally came to the place and says you know what our problem is we need what they had on the day of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and then came came the Pentecostal Revival amen God was calling for it remember what the prophet said he said before God does anything he'll send the holy ghost ahead in the people he said to create a hunger and a thirst for amen for what he's going to do amen and brother what's he going to do he's the resurrection and Rapture so he's creating a hunger and a thirst in us for the resurrection and the Rapture amen many got a hunger and a thirst for the resurrection and Rapture not a religious thought not a Doctrine no no it's a hunger and a thirst it's a power it's an anointing that you're craving for the resurrection and the rapture Saints it's not just let being religious and going and oh wait waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting no God's waiting on you he already he already sent the anointing he already sent the power he already sent the Holy Ghost he already revealed the word the mystery of God to create in us the hunger and thirst for the Rapture for the resurrection I tell you it's finished it's finished beyond your CU it's getting worse you know the world's worse you know there's no more hope in the world it's not going to get any it's not going to get better when it comes to the world out there it's getting worse worse and worse and you're you're hearing this you're hearing that and it and it's getting worse I was just telling a couple of Brothers there last night concerning the the new Looney that they're bringing [Music] out yeah crazy what is it it's insanity The World Is Gone politicians are not like they used to be no no no one time politicians you know they were they were just they they had character they don't have character today no that's one thing they don't have is character all all due respect to them but they're influenced by a spirit of insanity not normal no more one time you remembered politicians you knew their name you recognized them and you respected them and so on but now you who's that who's who's who's who's the Prem new land uh who who's who's in charge of this who's in charge of that well we don't know why because you don't recognize the character there's no character it's it's the spirit of insanity one time they they just stood for stood for what we felt oh that's good yeah that's that's that's reasonable that's sensible not anymore the world is insane Grace listen brother it's influencing everybody and remember the father God said the bride would stay for a little while cuz God's going to bring out the real Faith that's in the bride it's getting serious father God said you the hours comeing he said when he said you won't be able to pray for the sick he said they'll shoot you I said brother Brown wouldn't be surprised if he were alive today CU he told us he you know he said I could tell you things he said that would shock you but he he saw things and he said I got things in my heart he said they'll be there when I go to my grave but he wouldn't tell us what it was I believe it what he saw in the future coming and you and I are witnessing it amen Grace because there's going to be so few most churches are going to go The Way of the World there'll still be churches but the greater the greatest influence is going to be the world Amen because the preachers are going to compromise and they are compromising just think there is churches out there they got atheist preaching and you mean tell me that's not in sanity atheist preaching yeah but what is it to them it's a job so to them all they got to do is read read this book and and and and they'll study it and and see what ideas they can come up with and and go out and and and preach it to the people but they're not going to preach for an hour or two hours or they that they'll preach for maybe 20 minutes 25 minutes I was shocked when somebody said oh they got atheists preaching in that church you think it ever come to the place where we have atheists preaching the message I did mention I think to brother Bob that some time ago that I was going through some quotes and uh from some older messages and I said what that the Propet of god mentioned something about God's going to let it go on and on and on he said tell what for the trial of our faith our belief in God oh and then I heard about this atheist preaching how many Believers believe in God if they don't believe God they don't believe in God I tell you is there ever hard and difficult time for preacher for preachers that are called of God it's this our because we're seeing we're seeing what the others are not seeing and I tell you the preachers that are called of God they're not going to be elevated they're going to be bu they're going like Elijah they're going to be put down yeah and like Elijah they went out and to the Wilderness why because they because there are so few Believers in Israel Elijah didn't think there was any there and and what did Elijah say to God when God called him Elijah said Lord he said let me die he said I'm worse worse than my fathers help Grace that's how bad it's going to get in for for the for the Gentiles oh no that was just Israel no no it's going to get the same way here in this world Listen the preachers they bent under the heavy load and there's many preachers bending under the heavy load today you pressure because this is what people want the bride wants Resurrection rapturing Faith but there's others just want preach this preach this encourage us you know with with this Revelation that Revelation make us feel good no no the more preaching of the word it's it's going to Humble you humble you humble you humble you you got to get down to look up amen humble yourself amen God help us this is not Luther's age this is not Wesley's age this is not the Pentecostal age this is the bright age this is the most serious hour amen he said the preachers have been under the heavy load because the members of the church had forced them to do these things because that's what the members of the church wanted he said I feel sorry for a preacher that's got no more God about him than to let his congregation dictate to him and get him off in a rut he said I believe that we need preachers that's men that's God-fearing godsent servants who he said who's not afraid to call wrong wrong and right right amen he said the gospel has been handled too much now with kid gloves and he said what we need is some oldfashioned preaching he said like Billy Sunday John the Baptist and he saids some of them oldfashioned Hellfire and brimstone messages again he said back to the people he said I know he said that's not popular but brother it'll bring the bride under the leadership of the Holy Ghost most definitely as it is written in the word It Is by grace through faith that we are saved amen not of ourselves it is the gift of God faith is God's leadership amen you're living by faith not by sight what God reveals is God's leadership you're doing what God's revealing to you you're going to do it God's way God's time and so on for the glory of God but for your salvation and for the change of our bodies and remember again that faith is God's leadership that it's not you it's God's gift to you to Lead You In Paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen the bride shares the name of the bridegroom amen turn with me to Psalms chapter 23 a very familiar scripture Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd amen if he's your Shepherd is your leader and he said I shall not want amen he's going to provide what you have need of you're going to give the glory to him and it says he make me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters the revealed word never leave out the word hallelujah he restoreth my soul God in control he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake Hallelujah so do we have God's leadership amen he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death and that's what we're walking through now yeah again I've had to highlight those things at funerals and and even when my brother sibling brother passed away and they asked me to get up and read a scripture so I read it this one and explained it oh never heard that before they thought I said he's not in the valley I said he they belied he's they they wanted to believe that he was he was in glory singing and playing his guitar because they were going to miss his singing there in that church well I said I said we are in the Valley of the shadow of death it's a shadow amen and Y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil God help us take away fear for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me praise the Lord Brother the only thing there only thing that we're we're into is the word praise the Lord if he is our Shepherd it's going to be the word the word the word the word it's going to be living living for him talking to him fellowshipping with him amen and it says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies amen yes that's true thou anointest my head with oil my cup runthe the Lord surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life praise the Lord that's wonderful goodness and mercy the grace of God shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever but we can believe the sixth verse but is dependent on the first five verses amen if the Lord is your Shepherd and the Lord makes you to lie down in Green Pastures the Lord is leading you bes inside the waters amen the Lord restores your soul and he leads in the paths of righteousness and even though you're walking through the through the valley of the shadow of death you you got no fear why because God's in control amen he's with you it says his rod and staff comfort you praise the Lord and he said he prepares a table hallelujah praise the Lord in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup is running over Allelujah and goodness and mercy is following me and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen because if you got the others you're bound to have this I trust that we dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen it is the house of the revealed word by the grace of almighty God and you're going to stay in it and you're not going to get out of it turn with me to Proverbs chapter 8 Proverbs chapter 8 and beginning to read at verse 13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil today they're compromising with evil right that's right why in the world would they put out that new Looney compromising with evil yeah I don't know if you receiv received it I received it they want me to sign a petition say no I don't agree with that new Looney that there bu had I signed it so grace of God brother take your stand so the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and their forward mouth do I hate CS is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding I have strength by me Kings reign and princes decree Justice by me princes Rule and Nobles even all the judges of the earth and it says I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me riches and honor are with me y dble riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold yay than fine gold and my Revenue then Choice silver it's not what you got in the bank here what do you have the bank in glory here it says thieves break through and steal but it says if you got it in heaven the thieves won't break through and steal amen let's make sure we got got it in in our account in heaven amen it says I lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and I will fill their Treasures the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old and that's why he had the testimony that he had it wasn't him him it was God in him amen the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old and I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or ever the Earth was oh let's ask you the question God asked job where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth well job came to the Revelation and confessed it that that he was he was in glory amen that he was with god with a Morning Star sing together and this that's the ministry and the sons of God shouted for Joy amen we're going back there amen there was no sin amen because they remember the prophecy of you're Minister here you'll be ministered there if you're if you're leading here you lead there amen see see God is bringing out your calling here and he's proving your calling here so when you get when you get there for you you'll fulfill what God's ordained for you to fulfilled you're going to live what God's ordained for you to live amen it's going to be it's going to be Eternal praise the Lord hallelujah like I said it's going to be real but just that there won't be no sin no thought of sin no unbelief no Darkness you know even when it comes we won't need the sun we won't need the moon amen because going why it's going to be the a light there's going to be a light that that cast no Shadow amen because God is light and in him dwells no Darkness at all praise the name of the Lord I just pray Grace Lord help us to believe it Lord believe that more than we believe this amen praise the Lord so I was set up from Everlasting and from the beginning orever the Earth was praise the name of God brother the path of God's leadership in your life is Faith follow God's leadership to Redemption by faith God's instructions and Leadership is repent be baptized in his name not his names you only got one name the Lord Jesus Christ and this this same we said Jesus this same Jesus has been made Lord and Christ amen amen praise the Lord I trust he's the Lord and the Christ of your your life that he's the leader of your life life and he's the anointing and power of your life what he wants you to do he's there to give you the power to do it that's wonderful Hallelujah he's there to give you the grace to do it amen praise the Lord oh I can't do this oh yes we can I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me praise the Lord amen so brother God's instructions and Leadership for Redemption is repent be baptized in his name and recognizing your faith the Lord gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost the guarantee of God's continued leadership in your life amen you repent you're baptized in his name because you believe in the resurrection and the Rapture you believe you you go down in the in in the water what is it you're being buried with him because as he went down but you also believe in the resurrection you come back up and that's what water baptism represents the death and resurrection of our Lord and that's why you're baptized in his name a that's right people don't realize that they just think oh it's just a religious thing we got to do you know we just got to oh I got to repent go to the altar repent I I'm going to get into those things sometime and explain what God's looking for in your repentance and have you repented and then you go get baptized say Lord I believe you're my savior now I also this is how you did it you were buried then you Rose again so I'm going to go down in the water I'm going to come back up again a lot of people don't realize that's what res that's what water baptism represents is a typo is is burial and resurrection that you die to yourself you come alive to God and you're and you you rise amen you rise from the spiritual of death to become a new creature in Christ Hallelujah most people don't realize that they don't know that yeah because like I said I was in 19 December I think 1965 that I was baptized in Elum Pentecostal Tabernacle and and I believe it was June 1965 66 I was re-baptized but in in Elum it was only father son Holy Ghost they didn't use his name but in in June I was re-baptized in Bishop FS River by Brother Bill aot and he said as and he and he said he said as the Lord commanded to baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost he said I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen I went down came up Amen brother brother aot baptized me brother brother Kar was there because he he had his car there he had his PA system there he was playing music and so on and brother Manuel was there and he was he was laying out the word amen but then God responded to your faith and he gives you the Holy Ghost amen what for so he will continue his leadership in your life amen is God continuing his leadership in your life a confirmation of your faith without faith it's impossible to please him impossible amen you can do everything else but if you don't have that genuine Faith so recognizing your faith after you repent and you're baptized God gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost it is the guarantee of God's continued leadership in your life it is not you that's living in that body it's Christ that liveth in you and God God's continued and constant leadership is in you it is written having the mind and Leadership of Christ in your life in Philippians chapter 2 turn with me and I'll have to finish here Philippians chapter 2 thank God for the revelation of the word brother other ages don't didn't see know what you and I know because they didn't need it but you and I need what God has revealed in this hour because God is required of us what he didn't require of them amen in Philippians chapter 2 and verse one if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of mind let each to esteem other better than themselves have that respect for your brothers and sisters Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others not just what you need what does my brother and sister need God help us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Oh being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God let this mind be in you who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men amen and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself so we humble ourselves and become obedient unto death we die to ourselves to come alive to Christ and if you're if you're dead to yourself and alive to Christ you got his leadership amen there's no no way that you could be dead to yourself and alive to him and not have his leadership amen but if you don't have his leadership you're not dead to yourself yet God help us and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen We Lay ourselves down amen that we be crucified to the world and the things of the world brother sister let's not do as I have showed you a picture before this we got to take up our cross and follow him but it's like the the drawings that somebody drove one time that they were they were walking with the cross on their shoulder yeah and there was some there they said oh it's too heavy oh and it stopped and went and and saw off a large portion of the Cross so it be lighter others was trying to wouldn't do it no we need this cross and so they kept on walking the other ones that haded cut off it was easier for them it was lighter but then all of a sudden they came to a place in their walk with God and it was going from one part of the cliff or the walkway to another because there was a big gap there in the Rock how are we going to get across here oh those that those that that kept the cross the way that God wanted it they took the cross and they lifted it up and they laid it down and it it went from one side to the other and they walked AC cross on the cross picked up the cross and kept on going but the ones that cut their cross off shortened their cross shortened their burden oh their cross was too short and they couldn't they couldn't go from one side to the other amen and there are those that can only go so far as a Christian and they stop they cut why because they com compromise that's right so brother don't shorten your cross if God makes it long bear it because you're going to need it praise the Lord so brother sister follow his leadership not the devil's leadership that was the devil's leadership in that brother's life to shorten his cross Satan knew that he was going to need it Satan saw it brother sister I pray Grace that our cross is long enough to take us from time to Eternity amen that our cross is long enough to take us from from Death to life amen brought from here to the resurrection into the Rapture into a glorified body amen hallelujah take up your cross and follow me by the grace of God God bless you L stand Amen
