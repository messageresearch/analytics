immanuel god with us heavenly father lord that you're a prince of peace you're a deliverer you're a healer lord you're a redeemer a sanctifier lord that you have given us lord and you are giving us what we have need of to meet the challenge for our day lord god lord we pray that you administer now through the word lord grace to the speaker lord and especially grace to the hearer we pray lord god lord have the preeminence lord we pray lord we invite you to take the service now in your name we ask you amen amen amen god bless you thank you musicians that'll be it man if you turn the scriptures to genesis chapter 31 genesis 31 amen certainly appreciate the song service this morning it was uh right on point as you'll see as we get into the into the service this morning so we praise the lord amen it's good to have the holy ghost leading and preparing the people's hearts amen and then god bless you genesis 31 and verse 1 says and he heard the words of laban's son saying jacob had taken away all that was our father's and of that which of the which was our fathers had he gotten all this glory and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee amen god bless his word you may be seated this morning amen we're taking a bit of a different direction this morning playing a little bit off of the last service and then we're going to be continuing on thy kingdom come and thy kingdom come is all about the reality amen it's all about the reality of the word the impact of the word how we act how we live the things that makes us do the things that keeps us from doing and all these different things and we'll continue on that side of it a little bit this morning but this service this morning i want to speak on a title of i will not let thee go amen and this is kind of a natural progression i think from our last service where we talked about that that priest that royal priesthood amen the ones that are there to to offer sacrifices and intercede on behalf of themselves and their families and the different ones that god puts on their heart and puts under their authority and under their sphere of influence amen but we want to take our text from the story of jacob this morning it's a very familiar scripture i know but i want to take a little bit of background before we dig too deep into this and i want to start with his name and his birth amen your name matters and your birth matters if you didn't know that we'll know it after we talked with jacob this morning amen we're born under a name and that name has an impact on our lives the prophet teaches it the word teaches us that that our name has an impact in our life it has a an impact on our nature and then we want to see the pattern here we want to see how jacob progresses and and how we can do the same thing so let's turn back to genesis 25 genesis 25 and uh this is speaking of of jacob's birth it says and the lord said to her this is rebecca his mother two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger now we know in the old days the oldest son was always there without exception the oldest son was always the heir it didn't matter if he was good bad and different ugly handsome didn't matter if he was smart if he was stupid didn't matter if he was spiritual and spiritual no matter what the eldest son was always going to be the heir and so god's kind of turning things on their heads from the beginning with rebecca here and he's saying listen you're not going to be having a normal family structure here you've got somebody that's you've got two nations coming out of you not one nation it's amazing he's saying there's going to be a division in the family from the births of these two boys he says and one of them is going to be stronger than the other and and the older one is going to serve the younger so he's setting a division there right from the very beginning the other thing he's showing is he's showing favor amen we don't like to think the world doesn't like to think that god shows favor but guess what god shows favor amen he shows favor to his children he shows favor to his seed he shows favor to those that are predestinated to what to become the sons of god and those above all else receive the favor of god and then it's not just blessings favor it's also as we talked about it's a it's the correction it's the discipline it's the working of god to draw them into a place where they can be what god has called them to be amen so we see here that god is showing favor to one and it's not the one that you would normally think god would show favor to amen it says in verse 24 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like in hairy garment and they called his name esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on his on esau's heel and his name was called jacob so we see even in their womb they were fighting even in their womb amen before they came out their contrary natures were showing and then it's not common for babies to fight in the womb amen but she spoke and even she knew even from the beginning that there was something going out there and what is it it's god's predestinated seed fighting with those that are not predestinated they're fighting for power they're fighting for position they're fighting for authority in there amen but it's a natural struggle there and that's not what we're called to do is it but we see that nature even coming out the predestinated nature of jacob have i love and esau have i hated guess what when those two are put together then it's like oil and water they don't mix and there's always going to be conflict in the carnal side of things amen you cannot get along oil and water and then they just won't mix even if you shake them together and they mix for a second there comes a point and then they've got to separate and the oil will flow to the top and the water will go to the bottom it's just the way it is amen but we see here his name was called jacob and the name jacob means supplanter now that doesn't mean anything to most of us these days so planter is not a common word it's not a common term but when you look at the word subplanter now it means one who grasps right so he grasped esau's heal when he was coming out trips up or deceives amen it says one who seizes one who's circumvents know what it means to circumvent take a shortcut right one who takes shortcuts or usurps that means take somebody else's position so jacob's name is one who seizes takes shortcuts takes someone else's position and trips up and deceives other people and this is the son of god this is a predestinated son of god and coming out of the womb this is what he is described as is one that is basically he sounds like he's a child of the devil quite frankly doesn't he if we're to look at him naturally if we look at the meaning of his name there's nothing here that would say this is a son of god but yet this is what god wanted him to be named from the very beginning amen and so brother branham calls jacob he says he was a shyster right jacob was a con man jacob was a man that was always looking for an edge he was always looking for an angle he was always looking to get ahead he was always looking to take something that while he thought it belonged to him wasn't necessarily his and certainly not the way that he thought that he was going to take it amen he was always looking to take something that didn't belong to him amen amen like i said he has a character now to match this name he has a character to match it his name was it basically meant shyster and that's all jacob did his entire life until he comes to a certain point jacob's a shyster all the way along he's always looking to manipulate things to change things to benefit him rather than looking for the big picture and what benefits others verse 27 says and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents jacob was a towny we'd say these days right he dwelt intense he was a mama's boy he stayed home he took things easy he wasn't out in the field he wasn't out hunting amen it's like matt and me okay right that's what it was a man of the field and a man of the chair in the desk right that's what we've got there now i'm speaking nothing spiritually in that in that comparison brother matt as we know but you have a you have a big division between their natures don't you where their inclinations their hobbies and guess what again most of us would say esau was probably the one that was maybe more spiritual out in nature you know out and doing these things and a provider and he was out there and he'd make things happen he was a big strong man a hairy man a man's man a man among men right but he wasn't a child of god was he jacob the mama's boy that stayed at home that was god's man and said and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison it does it's funny most of us would like our sons because of a good character they do things esau was like because he brought home food that isaac liked you know i'm not sure if that's what i'd like my dad to love me for is because of the food i brought home it says but rebecca loved jacob now i want you to catch there it says jacob was a plain man now that word doesn't mean that he was you know he wasn't flashy but that word plain means perfect complete sound wholesome morally innocent and having integrity so we have a man that is named shyster and yet the scripture says he was a plain man perfect complete sound wholesome morally innocent having integrity so what we have here is a man that's at odds with himself because internally we would say in his heart he wants the right things but when it comes to his actions he's doing it completely on his own he's he's acting by the way of the world but his heart is close to god right so we've got a man that's twisted up we got a man that's fighting with himself because his heart's right but he can't seem to wait on god for things he tries to put things into action himself amen and so he's always working against his own nature he's always fighting it amen does that sound familiar amen we can end up fighting against our nature amen what is it our heart wants to do right paul talks about he says when i would do those things which are good i find i don't do them and the things i don't want to do i want to do them amen we have that nature that is constantly fighting against us and so we've got a soul nature and we've got an outside nature and the problem is which one's going to win amen now jacob we know from these points from early on in his life it comes to the forefront which one is winning doesn't it right we see exactly what's happening with with with jacob because jacob wants the birthright now here's the thing god said the elder was going to serve the younger he didn't say jacob was going to get the birthright did he he didn't say how this was going to happen but jacob says i've got to get that birthright and so he works to bring esau to a place where he'll give it up now esau brings it on himself he comes home from hunting and he has no food he's had no luck and he comes in and jacob has a stew already prepared and he says i need some food and jacob says no no no no buddy you got to give me something for my stew i'm not going to share with you we might be blood but this is my stew right this is my stew jacob wasn't a good guy all right this is my stew and so esau says well what do you want he says give me your birthright and you know why esau gives it to him the scripture says esau despised his birthright he had no care or concern for having that he was satisfied to be the oldest the biggest the strongest the best hunter he had no what concern or care for that birth rate why because it had a spiritual attachment with it it wasn't just physical authority but whoever has the birthright the firstborn had the full care of the tribe of the family beneath them it was not just the physical taking care of them but it was the spiritual taking care of it as well and esau just wanted to be able to do his thing and so the scripture says he despised it it means it was meaningless to him it had no real worth so he traded his birthright which was the blessing and control of the entire family and tribe for a bowl of stew that's what it was worth to him it was worth less than a bowl of stew if we could put it that way man so what's the disconnect we see here we see jacob valuing the things of god but he's scheming to get them right he's not willing to sit and wait he's not willing to sit and let the word and the prophecy of god come to pass but he's trying now to get these things and he's trying to hold him to himself and get them his own way and here's the thing once he gets the birthright then what does he do after that he's not satisfied with just the birth right now now he goes and he deceives isaac to get the firstborn's blessing because regardless of whether you had the birthright there was a special blessing for the firstborn and then he goes and he deceives isaac he puts on remember he goes and he kills a goat and then he goes and he puts on the fur of that animal on his arms so that he feels like esau that's how hairy he was he felt like a goat right he puts it on him and then he goes into isaac and he deceives isaac and gets isaac to bless him right and have you noticed with jacob when he goes in he ties god into his lie because remember esau leaves and goes to hunt deer because these isaac says go get some deer cook the venison the way i like it and then come in and i'll give you the first born blessing isaac or esau runs out and all of a sudden we have what jacob comes in you know maybe an hour later and he's got this already and isaac says whoa that was quick he says yes god brought me the deer what he spiritualized what he was doing he was deceiving and he was tying god into his lie that's how low jacob was is he's tying god into the lie that he's doing to try and get the the firstborn's blessing amen amen we don't need to spiritualize our mistakes i was talking with a couple of brothers this week talking about our own lives and i said sometimes we've just got to realize we did something wrong right and what happens is we try and spiritualize it and all of a sudden you know what that leads to it leads to a religious spirit and then when we start sitting there and we start saying i made a poor mistake i made a bad decision that wasn't according to the word that wasn't according to the will of god and then we sit there and say well maybe that was god's will for me no no no let's not go there we'll let god work it out and then romans 8 28 still holds he'll work all things for our good but if it what it does is when we spiritualize it it keeps us from repenting because we're trying to say actually god was in it no no we don't do that we repent we say lord that was on me that was on me i made a mistake let's keep god out of it and go back to god make it right and then we can move on with it amen now we know what happened after this is esau get very angry because he gave away the birthright of his own free will but now he's had the the firstborn blessing stolen from him so he says and isaac's gonna die soon they know it he says as soon as soon as isaac's done as soon as the days of mourning are over i'm killing jacob and of course rebecca hears this and she says to jacob you gotta leave he's taken daughters from the the canaanites and what not his wives we don't want that i'm gonna send you back to my family take a wife from there and in the meantime esau won't kill you and then maybe you can come back when he's not as angry anymore so then we jump up to genesis 28 and says and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward heroin and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac and the lamb whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and shalt thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and i will bring thee again to this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven amen what would you do if this had happened to you can you imagine young brothers if you were setting out to find a wife and on the way you laid down and you had a tremendous dream a tremendous vision of the angels of god going up and down the ladder and god himself standing at the top of the ladder and then he comes down and he confirms the abrahamic coven covenant to you right this is now it's a god of remember it's the god of abraham isaac now it's the god of jacob he has bound himself he has committed himself to jacob on his way down he says look jacob i'll be with you everywhere you go but i'm going to bring you back to this lane because this is the land that you're really supposed to be in this is the land i've given you and then from there you're going to spread out and i'm going to bless you and you're going to go to the north south east and west we'd say praise the lord god's with me right and we'd have no concerns you would think about where we're going and what we're doing and how god's going to be moving in our life but watch what happens here because look this is god promising things to jacob the shyster all right jacob the deceiver jacob the man that's at odds with himself it's god's promise to a man that's still all twisted up mixing up the carnal nature and the spiritual nature that's inside of him amen and yet god comes down and he seals the covenant with him right there and he says i'm with you the same way i was with your forefathers amen i love that because what god has bound himself to us no matter what condition we're in no matter how fallen we are no matter how great we are no matter where we are it doesn't matter god has bound himself to us and he's bound us to be what a spotless perfect bride and so no matter what our condition is today no matter where we are no matter what we're doing no matter what we're not doing what he has bound himself to us and he says i'm going to return you to the place that you came out of amen i'm going to take you back to the land that i promised you and there's going to be a kingdom that develops out of that and i'm going to make sure that you make it and i'm committing myself to you even in your twisted shape amen even in your in trying to get things your own way even in pushing the way that you do even in the way that you're always striving and struggling it doesn't matter i'm going to make sure you come back and i'm going to bless you but you're going to have to come back to get the full blessing amen amen what he it's this covenant is not guaranteed by our actions it's not guaranteed by our perfect life it's not guaranteed by our perfect attitude our perfect motives or perfect objectives it's what based on what his choosing amen it's on his love it's on his thoughts before the foundation of the world and he put our names on the book of the lamb before we were ever born amen it's a wonderful thing it's no different than what jacob got here now watch jacob's response so this is god giving him the covenant and jacob responds like any shyster would he says and jacob vowed a vow saying if if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my father's house and peace then shall the lord be my god programmer's known if then statement if you do this then i'll do that this is the shyster this is now he's saying okay god that sounds great really appreciate that thank you thank you if you do it then i'll make you my god he's just had a tremendous dream he's had a tremendous vision he's had god speaking directly to him and he says god if you do it then i'll serve you but until then i'm going to kind of be in a holding pattern right what is the shyster he's manipulating he's saying you've got to prove it before i'll ever serve you amen it says and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be of god's house and of all that that thou shalt give me i will surely give a tent to thee. so he says in the meantime i'll give you a tithe but you're not my god until you bring me back and you give me the fullness of the commitment that you've made to me amen how would you handle this i believe if i had that i'd be shouting and dancing and hooping it up and praising my way all the hair and saying god's taking me out and god's bringing me in and i'm going to get a wife and i'm going to get a kid and then he's going to bring me back there and he's going to bless me and we're going to grow into a massive nation right that's not jacob jacob says oh i'll give you a tenth of whatever i have but we'll wait and see how this works oh god it's amazing we see it in the children of israel the supernatural experiences that they had and yet what happens they keep going back down to the base nature every single time except a couple right it takes something else to make this happen amen these these supernatural events and we want supernatural events we serve a supernatural god but the supernatural events like this are not what's going to hold us through our life amen there's got to be something that anchors us beyond that amen now we see jacob he comes to heron where his uncle laban is and he goes to work for him and jacob gets a taste of his own medicine doesn't he because he's the deceiver and then he meets the uncle that's an even greater deceiver and so jacob says hey laban says hey you're of my family you don't have to work for me for free what do you want jacob says i'd really like rachel for a wife so he says okay work seven years so he works seven years the scripture says it was as only a couple of days for jacob because his love for rachel was so great and then on the wedding night my only presumption is the scripture silent on it but my only presumption is jacob gets so drunk that when he goes into the bedroom then laban has swapped out rachel for leah her older sister and he goes in and consummates the marriage with a woman that he thought was rachel and then he wakes up in the morning he sees leah besides him he says whoa something happened here he goes goes to laban says what did you do you deceived me and lavin says well it's not our custom for the older to get married second she's got to get married first so i've given you leah he says wait a week we'll marry you to rachel and then you can work another seven years so jacob works 14 years to get a wife that he didn't want and didn't love and he gets the one he wants as well so he gets deceived right up front right god's got a way of making us pay for the things that we do doesn't he he gets a taste of his own medicine amen scripture says be not mocked you know whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap so reap after the spirit don't reap after the flesh amen because if you reach after the spirit you'll get life out of it amen but after that of course once those 14 years are up jacob's paid his dues he's paid for his wives 14 years of working 14 years of working for your wives brothers that's a long time then laban says well how are we going to do this now and he says well give me all of the cattle that have strakes on them so stripes or circles or blemishes basically anything that's not a solid color will be for me out of all the the sheep and the goats and the the cattle and everything and you keep the solid colored ones so laban looks around his his flock and he sees it's mostly solid color ones he says i'm in good shape and so jacob starts to work for that and then what happens is jacob is still the manipulator because it talks about the things that he did to the water to make them have the the the speckled cattle and sheep and whatnot so jacob's manipulating the system and so all of a sudden laban looks out and he's seen jacob getting more and more and more his currents getting bigger and bigger and labans are getting smaller not only that jacob made sure that the stronger ones were the ones that made it to produce his and the weaker ones that made it to produce produce laban's flocks so he's he's not only getting more than laban he's getting the real good ones as well right and this goes on and laban changes his wages 10 times because he keeps seeing jacob get richer and richer and richer and him get less and less and less right why because he's a manipulator he's just like jacob right he's a shyster as well it's probably where jacob got it was through the the family lines that way amen but no matter what he did jacob always found a way to increase and you know who was doing that god the scripture tells us that god said look i've seen what laban's done to you and i've made sure that you're still blessed jacob the shyster because he's chosen in favor of god is still blessed even in his manipulating that's an amazing thing when god makes a commitment he makes a commitment amen and when he does it by himself not based on your behavior it's an even greater commitment amen but you look at jacob's life and he has no peace and no rest in it there's constant conflict there's constant tension why because he's taking away things from laban by deceit and manipulation and then laban's saying well that's not fair and he's going back and forth and back and forth changing these things so you have all this internal family friction because you've got two shysters and two manipulators trying to get the better of each other amen so it comes to the point where jacob says what this ain't worth it this ain't worth it i'm going through all this stress and it's tearing apart the family and i'm always worried about what's going to happen and this and that the other thing he says i just want to get out of this i've had enough of it amen amen have you ever noticed when you're trying to get things that god has promised your own way you're always fighting why because you're usually fighting with other people doing the same thing right you're trying to get something that's not in god's time for you yet and so what you're doing is you're trying to do it by way of your strength by your skills by your cunning and what happens is it always leads to conflict because god's not in it now god can bless you but god's not in it and you're always going to have that stress and you're always going to have that struggle and that striving amen what does it mean conflict is imminent right if it isn't there it's going to be here in a short time because you run up against somebody with the same attitude amen and so eventually jacob got tired of it he says i need to get out of this and i can speak from my own life when you tell god i'm sick and tired of this i don't want to do it what happens god opens the door right god when you say god this ain't worth it then god says great now i got you where i need you now i can show you something that is worth it come and talk to me for a little while amen and that brings us to our opening scripture genesis 31 says and the lord said to jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee now he's saying go back and face certain death and i'll i'll be with you go back and face the music and i'll bless you this is no simple thing that he's saying to jacob go back because waiting back there is esau and esau still angry as we know and he's saying go back there and that's where i'm really going to bless you jacob you've had a taste of blessings but i'm going to take you back to the the real covenant now i'm going to take you back to the land of the covenant and that's where i'm really going to bless you but you got to face the music first amen like i said i i can say with confidence that when you start thinking about getting out of the racket god starts moving on your behalf amen when you start saying this isn't worth it god says great let's go someplace else let's give you a place where it's not a racket anymore where you can just trust and have confidence in the things that you're doing amen amen i spoke about this so i'm going to skip it amen but he's talking to to jacob here and this is where he says that you know i saw the things for for laban verse 12 says for i've seen all that laban doeth unto thee he says look i've seen that he's trying to cheat you he didn't say jacob i've seen you trying to cheat him that's the favor of god it's amazing what he'll do friends right he says i'm holding i'm holding laban accountable and i'm not letting him get away with it right but then verse 13 he reminds jacob he says i am the god of bethel i'm the god of that supernatural experience on your way out right i'm the one that met you i'm the one that gave you that dream that gave you that vision he says where thou anoints the pillar and where thou voweds devout unto me now arise get the out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred amen so god's reminding him hey i've met you on the way out i'm telling you to go back now's the time we're going to go all the way back we're going to fulfill the covenant amen i want to ask you is is god the god of your covenant amen if you're facing situations if you're facing difficulties if you're facing struggles is he still the god of your covenant or are we sitting here trying to fight our way through it on our own strength right are we sitting here trying to push it through with our own nature amen are we trying to do it with our own skills or are we sitting there and we've got to sit back and say god you're the god of the covenant and you're the one that's going to return me to the original land amen origin is destiny remember brother brown preached on that what we've got to go back to where we were originally and to do that we've got to leave all the te all the pushing and the striving and the straining and we've got to have rest amen that's the defining feature of a believer is rest i believe amen where we rest on the promises and we rest that god is on our side that he's pushing things aside that he's parting the sea that he's parting the river that he's making things as if they were nothing in front of us and he's bringing us back to the land of promise that he talked about amen so jacob starts back and he's going to face esau he knows there's a reckoning coming jacob knows he did wrong and he knows that esau is none too happy about it he's vowed to kill him and that vow is still it's still hanging over his head amen but the problem with jacob is that every step he takes back the weight of that decision and the the choices he made early on in his life are weighing on him because why now it's just not him that's in danger but he's got two wives he's got children he's got servants he's got flocks he's got wealth he's got everything to lose now he's got everything to lose when he came in all he had was a staff and when he's coming out now he's got everything and if esau is mad enough he'll kill him all and he'll take what he has right the decisions we make early on can sometimes have that effect don't they right when the innocent lives come along right now they get affected by our decisions right we got to think about that up front we say well i'm willing to take that well is everybody else that comes after you willing to take it because there is a price to pay amen now watch as jacob's heading on his way in genesis 32 1 it says and jacob went on his way so god's already met him in heron and now jacob is on his way and the angels of god met him and when jacob saw them he said this is god's host and he called the name of that place mahanayam even though i'd have been pretty settled i think right there i met angels going out i had god talk to me going out i've got god telling me to go back and then on the way back now i meet the host of army angels right this is god confirming all the way along jacob i'm with you right i've seen angels is what jacob's saying this is an amazing thing this is a place of god's host this is who's coming with me we think we'd be okay we'd walk with confidence right but remember jacob is still jacob right jacob's still got the nature of jacob and so when he pushes forward this doesn't mean anything to him he's still waiting on the if then if you do this then i'll serve you right and he's not convinced of these things yet amen god's talking to him god's confirming his promises god's giving him supernatural events in his life and yet jacob still isn't convinced he still isn't at rest and we see that because as they get closer and closer to esau watch what jacob says it says and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother and to the land of seer the land of the country of eden edom and he commanded them saying thus shall you speak unto my lord esau he's my lord esau now not my brother my lord essa he's getting real respectful as he gets closer thy servant jacob thy servant lord and servant that's what he's talking like now he's humbling real fast isn't he thy servant jacob sayeth thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now and i have oxen and asses flocks and men servants and women's servants and i have sent to tell my lord that i might find grace in thy sight now jacob's trying to appease the anger of esau right he's trying to weasel his way out he says look i've got lots of stuff here right we can make a deal esau you don't have to kill me we can make a deal it says and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him esau has no response if you notice but he's got 400 men and these are not foot washers and chefs and and people that set up parties amen this is not a family reunion he's coming for he's coming with 400 warriors and he's going to take out his revenge on jacob and his family amen it says and then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with them and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two bands and said if esau come to one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape so where's his faith now god's already said i'll be with you you've got an angel host traveling with you but what happens is he can't see the angel host anymore and now god's not talking to him and now he's dividing things up and saying hey at least somebody or something will survive whatever comes next right he's going to find one but if we split up he can't find us both so one of them will get to safety and the other one will have to pay the price right what's he doing he's still trying to salvage something right still trying to do it his own way isn't he god already promised he'd take care of him he already promised he'd take him back there and he'd bless him and he turned him into this huge nation and he's sitting there and he's trying to split things up he's trying to get it done his own way right but watch what happens next because jacob gets desperate and he starts praying and jacob said oh god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which said unto me return unto that country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee what he's saying here is look you've been with my ancestors he says and you're the one that told me to go back so god i'm doing this because you told me to i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant he's starting to get humble now isn't he he's starting to get a little bit desperate isn't he for with my staff i passed over this jordan he says i just came over with a staff and now i am become two bands i have so much stuff and so many people and servants that i can split them up into two bands that's how much i have right so in other words he's saying god you've blessed me you've made me wealthy you've given me so much since i first came into here then he says deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children. god already said i'm going to take care of you man what are you worried about and he's saying i'm scared i'm still scared you got the the angel host with you you've got god committing himself to you jacob what's your fear esau right he's not convinced yet is he he's desperate but he's not convinced and thou says i will surely do the good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude he's reminding god of the promise but he's still not convinced he's reminding god of the promise but he's still not convinced amen sometimes it happens with us right we're reminding god of the promise but we still have fear lurking inside right right the question is did he make the promise to you or not and if he did then why are we fearful brother ernie villanueva says fear is false evidence appearing real have you ever heard him say that false evidence appearing real and so jacob has not met esau yet esau has sent no message of peace to him you know the scripture doesn't actually tell us that esau was going to kill him amen have you ever noticed that he's coming with 400 people but we see afterwards that he offers them to jacob to protect him on his way in for all we know esau had forgiven jacob already and was just happy to have his brother back we don't know if jacob was going to kill him 100 we think it because jacob deserved it right yeah so jacob believes esau is going to kill him we actually don't know that right and esau's response maybe god moves on esau's heart and changes it we don't know but all we know is jacob is convinced that esau is going to kill him because he's coming with 400 men and he's sending no message of peace right that's right jacob's realizing one thing clock's running out right there's a showdown coming right he's going to have to face up to his decisions he's going to have to face up to what he said he's going to have to face up to what he did he's going to have to face up to his poor decisions and not only that his whole family is going to answer for it with him right but listen time to pay the piper but he's still jacob he's still jacob he's still the manipulator he's still the deceiver he's still the he's still the guy that's trying to negotiate right there's always a deal to be made with a shyster right we can always work something out right so for the sake of time we're going to skip the next few verses but he sends forward his animals and he sends them to esau take the animals right take the animals spare me take the animals take my wealth right he worked so hard and he manipulated so hard and god blessed him with those things and yet he's saying take it all just don't kill me right and he tells the guys go in bit by bit and send the goats in one herd and the sheep and the another and the cattle in this one and go one by one and as you come up to him say esau this is yours and the next one come up he saw this is yours he saw this as yours he says maybe this will hold him back right it says and this is what he said to the servants he said and say moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face per adventure he will accept of me right in other words he's trying to buy esa off with god's blessings that he manipulated right so went the present before him and himself lodged that night in the company and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women's servants and his eleven sons and passed over the four jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had amen i want to realize i want you to realize the significance of this jacob is completely alone now everything that he has every blessing of god that he's been given every bit of wealth every bit of family everything is separated from him and he's standing alone on the other side of the river now it's just him no servants to protect him it's just him and his wits that's all he's got left and this was known as a place of robbers and thieves right this is not a safe place to hang out alone he sent everything ahead of him and now he's just staying there alone and the scripture says in verse 24 and jacob was left alone and and wrestled a man and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day now i don't know how many of us have wrestled i remember the good old days at the first baptist academy sleep-a-thon where we wrestled with the men that were way older than us and i remember bob crane giving me a concussion because i was choking him out i didn't know that choking wasn't allowed in wrestling and i was choking him out nathan had worn him out and then he took me on and i was winning and i was choking him out and he he got up and he slammed my head seven times into the floor and gave me a concussion right that was about 10 minutes of wrestling and we were absolutely gassed and concussed right you don't last long with wrestling wrestling is full body workout everything is straining and grunting and shoving and pushing because you're looking for that little bit of advantage and it's constantly locked on you'll see them if you ever watch olympic wrestling what do they do they get in and they lock in and they're on arms and they're shifting this way and that and everything they're looking for an advantage and so with wrestling you don't get to sit back it's not like boxing you can kind of sit back and kind of watch the guy for a bit it's constant actions constant movement it's constant strain most people can't last 10 minutes it says jacob wrestled with a man until the breaking now remember we went from jacob talking to jacob praying he's beyond praying now folks he's wrestling he's wrestling right he's beyond desperation now he is fighting for something that he doesn't have right this is how far he's gone he's not just praying now he is in physical mortal combat if we could put it that way amen what is it he's not trying to beat this guy he's trying to keep this guy because he knows he realizes who he's fighting with he realizes at some point who is funny with and so he's not fighting to win he's fighting to hold him and keep him from going brother brahm said this he says jacob cried like never before desperately he called until he got a hold of god you've got to get a hold of god amen and when he did he wrestled not for 15 minutes he wrestled to keep him in his soul all night long and still he knew he didn't have the blessing he fought all night and he knew that he still didn't have the blessing sometimes we think because we struggle we have the blessing brother brown says he knew he didn't have the blessing even after struggling all night he says but he was able to hold on until the blessing come he wrestled desperately until the blessing come until god came on the scene amen jacob fought like a man possessed this is not a man fighting for his life this was a man fighting for the reality of god in his life amen he had all the blessings he had all the all the physical realities we could expect he had wealth he had family he had all of these different things all the things that they look for is a blessing from god back then amen but he was fighting for something that would change his situation now right now watch how god does it because what jacob already had the promise and he already had the blessing it was already given to him but he wasn't convinced of it and that makes all the difference doesn't it we have all of the all of the blessings in here but if you're not convinced of it then what happens you're going to be fighting all your life aren't you trying to do it your way instead of resting on what god has said amen but look what happens and this is verse 25 it says when he saw that he prevailed not against him so that's the angel of the lord didn't prevail against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with them so jacob comes into this battle as an able-bodied man he's strong he's fit he knows what he's doing he's got the strength he's got the endurance to hold on for this he's a he's a pretty uh a fit guy we would say man and listen in this one in this wrestling match god took every single bit of that away from him when he was done this wrestling match he had none of the able-bodied fitness that he had when he walked in amen god took every bit that allowed him to strive and strain and struggle in life he took every bit away of it when he touched him on his thigh and what he did was he knocked his hip out a joint you can't wrestle with your hip out of joint because it won't support you you're a one-legged man trying to wrestle a two-legged man guess what that doesn't work does it it's never gonna work amen why you can't beat god you can't beat them but you can prevail you can't beat them but you can prevail that means you can hold on long enough to get what you're looking for amen amen what happened after this jacob he starts and he's all struggling right come up brother kingsley he's struggling and he's striving right put your hands on me gently and he's got this come on he's like this right now watch when that hip goes out now brother i got nothing i got nothing right what is it he can't do anything so what's he doing come back brother kingsley and hold on so what's he doing now instead of trying to manipulate what's he doing now he's clinging isn't he because that's all he's got he's got one leg like this and he's holding on to that man and that man's trying to get away and jacob won't let him what is it he got to the place where he's not fighting now he's not trying to overpower what's he doing he's clinging on for dear life because that's all he's got left he's got no strength he's got no power he's got no strength he's got no moves he's got nothing left except to hold on that's all he's looking for is to hold on until he gets the blessing that he's looking for amen when he couldn't fight that's when he started clinging wasn't it amen that's all god ever wanted that's all god ever wanted was jacob trust me hold on to me get to the point where it's not you but it's me and then get to the point where you can't do it in the first place you realize it and let me do the work in you right cling that's all he's looking for friends is for us to cling oh man what is it cling to his word cling to his direction cling to the blood cling to the cross and then cling to the promise cling to the commitment cling to the covenant that he gave each and every one of us why otherwise he's got to do what he did to jacob he's got to touch your life he's going to touch your thighs so you can't walk so you have no moves left right so you've got nothing left and you're sitting there and all you're left with is sitting in a wheelchair saying god what do i do now because that's where jacob would have been if he was in the modern uh medicine wouldn't it he'd be in a wheelchair are you walking with crutches the rest of his life what is it he sets you up to fall so that all you're left to is clinging for him right that's all he's doing setting you up to say listen you got to trust me first before we move any further jacob you've got to come to a place where you'll trust me because you can't do anything right what is it he's not you're not going to let him get away until you get what he promised you what is it is it money it's not money is it because he's already got money it's not blessings what is it it's assurance right it's blessed assurance was what brother branham calls it where you can sit back and you can have what you can have rest you can have peace because you have a confirmation in your soul that you have a reality with god now it's not just words on a page it's just not a message that was given by a prophet in 1963 what is it you have a reality of that in your life amen we've got too many words around the message we can quote them all day long but how many have a reality of god how many have gotten to the point where god has knocked the pins out from under him and they've clung to him and realized that he is our portion he is our strength and then he is the one that's doing this now look this is the angel of the lord talking to him now he says and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me god's already blessed them what's he talking about god's already said everything he's going to do he's got the promise he's had multiple dreams he's had god come down and talk to him he said god guide him he's had everything but what is it he doesn't have a revelation of it he doesn't have a rest behind it he doesn't have a confirmation in himself that god's going to do it it's still just words to him and he says i won't let you go until you bless me what until you make this a reality brother brown said it this way he says after jacob have wrestled all night instead of trying to war away that man jacob held on to him he says i oh i wish we had about a half hour on that how that wrestling prince he was able to hold on until he got what he would after he held until it took all night but he stayed there he wanted to be absolutely convinced and when he stayed until god changed his walking he was convinced that's the trouble of it today we don't stay long enough till we get our walking convinced we don't walk like christians if we stay long enough with him he will make you walk different talk different live different act different sleep different be different i want to focus on sleep differently because what when is it that we stop and we start thinking about things when we lay our heads down isn't it and we lay in bed and the question is are we sitting there and wondering and worrying and trying to manipulate this and i don't mean manipulate bad i mean try and work things out in our head how are we going to get the money to do this how am i going to get here how am i going to do this how am i going to do that and we sit there and our minds just tumbling over and over and over again trying to make all the pieces aligned to where we have a perfect picture in our mind and everything works out but that's not our job that's not our job to work it out our job is to walk in faith and it's up to god to work it out that's why he says you will sleep different because of what's keeping you up at night is worrying concerned then you are lacking a revelation that god has already committed to what taking you all the way through whatever that need is whatever that need is it can be money it's okay to have needs for money and it's okay to go to god for money it can be your job it can be your career it can be your health it can be a spouse it can be your children it can be your church all of these things right we're living on this earth we've got carnal needs amen but there's got to come a spiritual satisfaction a spiritual rest a spiritual confirmation that will allow us to move through those things with faith that god is with us amen he says and the reason and the reason is we don't stay long enough we don't hold on jacob held on he said let me loose i've got to go he said i'm not going to leave you until i'm thoroughly convinced amen then when you take a promise of god and hold on to that don't let him loose just stay there until you see god come on the scene and then you're convinced another place he says and jacob rather in desperation he says i know i field you you're here with me but i'm not going to let you go somebody sees it's fine the first little sensation they get up and jump up and down run up the island say i got it i got it i got it he says uh-uh no oh jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different made him a different person because that he stayed until that happened and he was able the bible said he held until he prevailed how can a man prevail over god he says but you can do it you can do it a man can prevail over god it reminds me of when my boys want to wrestle and they prevail over me right what is it you let them work and work and work and then you give them an opportunity to take you down to score a goal whatever the case may be that you're doing with them right is you're looking to see will they put in the time and effort or will they just give up and say i've tried hard enough right brother baby's not saying we can beat god here he's saying you can prevail you can get god to give you what you need but it's on the basis of you staying there and showing that you're as committed to getting that result as he is and wanting to give it to you amen he's looking for somebody that will do what say i will not let you go i'm not going out of this place i'm not going out of my room i'm not going out of whatever i'm doing until you give me the answer that i'm looking for that i need an arrest and an assurance in my life amen amen you can prevail you can prevail the way he did jacob didn't that's by clinging and clinging and clinging and clinging until your hands are wrapped so tight in his clothes that they can't even be broken and then the scripture says they used to fight until their sword claimed to their hand you know what that meant it meant that their their fingers were so rigid around that sword that you couldn't pry it out for love nor money that's how hard they were holding to that sword because it was their life you lost the sword you lost your life right you had no way to defend you that's the way he's looking for somebody that'll grab onto him and cling until you can't take your hands away until he gives you what you're looking for and then you can pull away amen what is it we're not looking for an experience we're looking for a reality amen brother brahms talking about what something that changes your life your nature your mind your peace your rest your sleep this is something that has an effect amen it's not just something in your mind but it's something that actually steps into your actual body into your life and it makes a change that's what jacob was lacking there brother brown says this he says we could if we could just take a hold of god's agent god's agent then was elijah he says and god's agent today is the holy spirit hold on to it when you ever come in contact and you feel the holy spirit on you then hold on to it i'll not leave you stay with it like jacob did when he wrestled with the angel i'm going to hold on till you bless me and give me the things that i'm desiring he says wouldn't it be a wonderful revival break out and all up and down the coast here if the people that's right here tonight and those that are listening in on the air would take that attitude towards the holy spirit tonight i'm going to stay with you until i find out the things that i want to know amen you can't beat them but you can play you can cling to them amen you can be unshakable in your approach that's what he's saying he says you hold on until you get what you're looking for now the way life is today we can't go for days on end can we we can't stay in our prayer closet for days on end we've got too many things going on if you've got a family there's no way you can do it you've got responsibilities but you can say lord i'm coming to you in prayer lord i'm putting myself before you i'm keeping my life sanctified and i'm going and i'm spending my time with you until you show me what i'm looking for amen until you give me a reality of what i'm asking for amen listen to the angel's response this is the angel of the lord now and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be no more called jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed there's a real difference in that name isn't there we went from jacob the manipulator deceiver the guy that does shortcuts all these different things and now he says what your name is israel that means what a prince having power with god and men it means also fighter of god and one who contends with god and not contends against him but contends what to get what god has promised him amen but look jacob didn't just get a name change i sometimes will settle for something he didn't settle for just a name change right he settled for what a nature change because we see after this that jacob never struggles in this area again do we right he goes back and he faces esau and we'll talk about that in a little bit but jacob's nature has changed now where he comes out a different man than he walked in amen he comes out a man having power with god and men having gone in a manipulator and a deceiver listen if he could do that for him he can do it for all of us can't he amen he didn't even have the holy ghost he didn't even have the holy ghost what there's a better thing that came to us paul said right they all they never received the fullness of the promise but we received the fullness of the problem so the question is what is it that can hold us back what is it that says you can't be this or you can't be that or you can't do this or you can't do that if it's in the word then it's all given to us amen we have every redemptive promise that christ died for on calvary that belongs to us without question it is ours because we are his bride and he died for us amen so there's nothing that can hold us back brother braham says what the church needs to do is to do like jacob pray till you get a v-day and right he said jacob had a wrestling party he wrestled all night long with the lord but he said i'm just not going to let you go until i get this victory and then about daylight one morning he had a v-day he didn't walk the same anymore he says on this side he was a great big before the battle before the wrestling he was a great big strong okay everything's sounding good great big strong fearful church member looked great had all the skill in the world had all the strength in the world all the fitness in the world he says a great big strong fearful church member but on the other side he was a little limping pre prince a little limping prince with enough courage to fight the whole army what are we looking for most times you look and you say i want to be a great warrior great warrior s for god strong like the mouse right that fell into the vat of wine where's that devil that's not what jacob looked like when he finished when he was ready to fight when he was ready to take the promise this is what victory looked like okay that's what victory looks like with god right where's the victory in that he knows who he is he knows god's with him he knows the promises of reality in his life it doesn't look very good right doesn't look very impressive when jacob's coming at you but jacob's not afraid brother brown says what he's a limping prince with enough courage to fight the whole army victory looks like a limp a lot of times amen paul had it remember paul had a thorn in his flesh that never went away paul wasn't a great speaker prophet of the age and he was a bad speaker right victory looks really different than what we sometimes project it to be i think what is it has jacob's situation changed jacob's going in and he says lord change the situation and what happens on the other side of the wrestling match jacob changes situation hasn't changed at all but jacob's changed a whole lot hasn't he right what are we doing so often as we're saying lord change the situation and he's saying situations of me he says you need the change situation doesn't need to be changed you need to be changed what you need a greater revelation of the love of god and the life of god within you you need a greater peace a greater rest you need a greater strength you need to get this fear taken out of you right so i'm putting the situation there to draw what's in you so that you'll say well lord give me what i need then because i don't have enough to go through it i don't have the answer anymore i've reached my tipping point and if we go any further i'm going to fall off the cliff so lord i need you and we start to wrestle and cling don't we what until you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what he has said is true and it's for you right i believe this is true for brother ellie no problem i'll believe all day long brother you pick it i'll believe it for you when it comes to me what happens oh oh maybe right what is it we've got all sorts of faith for brother ellie right and then i've got none for brother jonathan why because i need a greater revelation i need a i don't need an experience with god i need a change right that's what i'm looking for and this is from glory to glory friends it never stops brother gerald has assured me many times he's still changing and growing so that means we're going to keep growing and changing until we get to the ending and we're looking for what an experience of our changing god not just an experience of the holy spirit guess what the rain falls on the just and the unjust right it falls on the weed and the weeds at the same time so we can say i've had all of these great experiences and i've had all these great dreams and i've got all these great gifts and god's used me for a million things and guess what scripture says at the end they'll have all of that and he'll say depart from me you that work iniquity i never knew you experiences are just that they help us along the way but they are not the way right they help us but they're not it right they're gifts if we can look at that way but they're not the giver and jacob's coming to the place where he says you're giving me the gifts now i need the giver right you give me the blessings of god but now i want the god of the blessings brother brown says this jacob stayed all night i'm sorry some of these are repetitive but he hits it from different angles and i wanted to drive it in jacob stayed all night one night wrestling that wrestling prince he wrestled all night he had been dodging esau here and there what have you been dodging he was scared to death of him and he heard esau was coming he put his wife across the brook went over the other side and knelt down you know god come down and got a hold of jacob and they wrestled all night so he wasn't completely convinced to start with but by the time god got through with him he was convinced yes he stayed and held on until he was convinced that it was god brother he wasn't scared of esau then crossed the river and he was weak and limping the worse that he could be in looked like the worse that he could be and look like looking on the outside he was the weakest he ever was he had been crippled and everything i'm going to face isa how with a limp and a new name but esau said to him will you let me send an army along to help you he said i don't even need the help why he was convinced that the god that he had a hold of could take care of him he says hallelujah if people would just do that you can be convinced that the god that takes a hold of you shakes your heart makes you a new creature in christ jesus let sickness death or anything else come along you're convinced that he can take good care of you so the question is what are you convinced of this morning and the situations we face in life and the struggles and the trials are you convinced that he has provided the answer amen not only for the situation but for you to go through the situation amen we're not meant to struggle and strive for these things stress is the greatest killer today why because people don't have anything to rest on we heard it all through the song services excellent service brother ralph right a rock somebody to cling to right they've got to have something that they can hold to to go through these things amen brother branham says you've got to stay till you're convinced he said don't stay till you feel something he said that about the holy ghost remember he said the holy ghost what happens people get down to pray the presence of the holy spirit drops down they say i got it i got i got it he says no no stay there till your change he didn't say stay till you feel something he said stay till you are something right you've got to be what you're believing for and god's got to do that you can't do it yourself and then stay until you're changed till your nature's been changed till your mind's been changed until your opinion's been changed and he is the one that's shining clearly through you amen amen you can't be just convinced up here like i said i'm convinced up here for brother ellie perfectly well right brother ellie you're you're fully blessed brother i'll believe anything you want me to believe for you it's an amazing place to be in is being having faith for somebody else but we've got to have it for ourselves amen i can't get brother ellie in the rapture right i can pray for him and have faith for him but that's not going to do it amen i've got to have something in me that's going to take me in the rapture amen we've got to believe it for ourselves and for those that are with us amen brother baby says this he says hey you want a spiritual name tonight amen are you a deceiver a manipulator are you weak paul was weak do you know paul was weak paul was weak right are you weak are you weak in an area that's an easy one isn't it are you weak in an area right he says hey you want a spiritual name tonight you want a different name for what you're struggling with just get a hold of the holy spirit and say lord i'm not going to leave this tabernacle till you bless me and things will look different when you leave you'll be just as determined as jacob was and you'll get a blessing amen and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place pineal for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved amen when a believer comes into the presence of god it's life-preserving right remember if somebody walked into the holiest of holies and they were not supposed to be there what happened instant death right but if you walked in because you were allowed to be there what was it it was life it was forgiveness it was an atonement it was grace it was mercy it was everything that you were looking for wasn't it why you're invited in there it says and he passed over penul and as he passed over penul the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh like i said that limp is what power with god looks like remember brother brown said humility is power with god right he got real humble didn't he he went from i've got everything to i have nothing and without you i'm going to lose the last thing i have which is my life that's the place that jacob got to amen and he walks out of this and he's convinced that what it's going to be real now brother bram says this notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here and type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of christ now he's talking about when abraham returned from the battle of the kings remember and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of christ and become a part of this being he says you get it jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose till he blessed him that's right he battled for life that's what we're looking for is life and more abundantly amen more and more and more of christ than me that's we're looking for in every aspect of our life but he's going to do what he's going to bring us to a time where it gets serious where there's going to be desperation where we see that the things are coming to a point and a decision has to be made and we can either die or we can move on right and we've got to give up before we can move on is really what's going to happen he says battle for life and after the battle is over then god gives you of himself he says that is his true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it then he says you shouldn't take it unless you wrestled it out and become a part of god amen i want to ask you have you seen the blessings of god in your life because it's a beautiful thing isn't it they're amazing when you have these supernatural experiences i've seen you know brother braham talks about that milky cloud i've seen that and then i've testified of having the holy spirit drop down in my car right there at holy ghost corner as we call it on cherry lane now right i've seen god heal i've seen god deliver i've seen god work miracles i've seen god give visions and dreams i've seen all of these things and they're amazing things but they're just blessings right it's not god it's just a what it's an outpouring of god right it's god's showing things it's god helping us along the way but it's not god himself it's just a reflection of those things amen and those things those experiences i'm talking about they're not what changed me into what i am today they have facilitated it they have made a path and they've made it easier but that is not what changes us like i said the rain falls on the just and the unjust you can sit in a holy ghost-filled service and say praise the lord and worship until your horse like we did this last weekend but if you don't have the god if you don't have the holy spirit that was falling in you rather than on you then what you're still lost right you've got to have something inside of you amen it's not the experience that changes me it's the god of the experience that i'm looking for every day amen why we can't cling to gifts we're talking about clinging we can't cling to gifts paul said they'll fail we can't clean the ministries they'll fail we can't clean the prophecy they'll fail right all of these things will fail you lift the man up he's going to fail every time you lift the ministry up it's going to fail right you lift a gift up you lift a blessing of god up and it'll always fail because it's not meant to be perfect in those things right because it's in imperfect vessels but what if we can cling to him now and hold on until he gives us what he's promised us mind you we're going for what he promised not what i promised we're going for what he promised so if we're holding to what he promised now then we've got something we can cling to because it's him we're going to amen now he may choose to bring it through a ministry he may choose to bring it through a brother he may choose to bring it through his sister whatever it may be but we're clinging until he gives us until we're satisfied that he'll do it amen brother brad says this he says god that's my prayer make me a christian lord if everything else fails make me a christian lord put something in me that's real knock at my heart lord tell me my short place and where i'm short at come in lord and open the doors of my own life open up my private life open my up my eyes open everything lord let me see you the love of god that shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost that's what i want he says that's what christ wants to do to this church not give you any more gifts you got too many of them now now this is 58 right he's still talking to pentecost in all in all likelihood but you'll see people chasing after the gifts all over again right brother bam says he's here right what are we looking for gifts for we've got the giver of the gifts now amen isaac's in the room with rebecca now right why are we talking to eliezer and the gifts no no let's move past it and let's spend our time with isaac himself he says what he wants to do is give you himself what is that he says love the love of god the abundant life in your heart that makes you love everybody and makes you love him till you can't rest that's i would love that i will say i'm not there yet right where i love everybody where my response is love regardless of what comes my way i'm looking for that i can't say that's in a full manifestation now in my life i believe i have the earnest of it i have the earnest of it i have no doubt of that but i'm looking for what a fullness now amen we're looking for god to do something greater than he's done so far to fill us more which means what us a little more too right let the carnal nature slide back a bit so that we can have more of this love that he's talking about and then i want to say this you can have every supernatural and spiritual experience that life has to offer and if you don't have the life itself it will do nothing for you amen we can sit here and we can have the holy spirit raining down we can have gifts moving we could have everything we could ever expect ever have dreams visions angels pill or fire you name it we can have it all in our midst but if we don't have him in our souls then it's not going to do us any good is it amen they're wonderful things and we praise god for them amen but i want to tell you don't settle for the blessings right because what's going to happen is you're going to get to the end and say the blessings aren't going to take me into heaven i was listening to a brother preach he was repeating the story brother branham had of that young sister and she was a christian a professing christian and there was another christian young lady and she always dressed real simple her hair was simple she had no makeup on she had simple clothes and this girl would make fun of her and say all these things about her and said you know what are you doing that for and you look horrible and you're only going to look more horrible and my pastor doesn't teach it and this and that the other thing and so that young lady went out and she got a uh an std right and she's dying on the hospital bed and they she was a sunday school teacher and what happened is they brought in the young children to see the angels take her away and what happened is she she she started what looking not in the mirror of herself but she started looking in the mirror of the word and she realized i have fallen and come short of the glory of god that she didn't have what that word was talking about and she said bring in that preacher that was telling me that i didn't need these things right and he came and said oh we'll give you a needle we'll calm you down she says no no no that's not going to help she said bring me that girl that i was making fun of all that time right and what happened she's in there and she's screaming and those little kids are looking at her their sunday school teacher right they think the angels are going to take her and she knows that she's going down not up right what is it the reality hits her and she gets desperate and realizes i don't have what i thought i had right it's too late at that point she's got nothing she's got nothing and she dies screaming why because she made fun of it right she was too happy to have the blessings without the giver of the blessings amen you gotta hope get a hold of god amen and you'll never be the same again brother brown says he there's this quote he says like a colored sister said one time in the meeting she said i want you all to know one thing said i'm not what i want to be right i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i ought to be but there's one thing sure i'm not what i used to be you want an evidence of the holy spirit it's that you're what nature has been changed right your desire is not for the things of the world jesus said if the man loved the things of the world then the love of god is not in it he says i'll tell you that's a good thing you know when you're passed from death into life when god takes a hold of you and hugs you kisses you makes you feel warm and welcome he says when god takes a hold of you and shakes you until your life changes and changes everything there is in you and makes you a new creature amen that's what we need is some lighted candles yes sir jacob didn't walk out of that wrestling match israel limped out amen and when he did he walked up to esau without fear right he was a changed man couldn't walk couldn't fight couldn't do anything but yet he was fearless in the face of what he thought was such a horrible situation and you know what he walks out and he's a prince having power with god and you know what happens when a prince having power with god walks into a situation what does he do he bows himself seven times to the situation why he's got nothing to prove he's convinced he's convinced god's with them he walks in with confidence not cockiness confidence and in that confidence what does it allow him to be humble and repentant he knew he did wrong he knew he did wrong to esau there was no covering it up now there's no pretending and he walked in and he bowed seven times as he drew closer and closer to esau and what happened was zisa received him and even offered him his men to help guard him on his way back that's why brother brown says and jacob says no no we've got to go slow otherwise the animals will they'll die out because we're pushing them too hard in these different things he says don't worry about it we'll be fine why is he saying that because god's with him and he's convinced of it now he's already seen the host of angels and that didn't convince him but when he spent a night with god and wrestled until he was changed now he knew that everything was going to be okay amen and what he knew the battle was won with esau that's why he could bow himself because he knew the battle was one wasn't him fighting it wasn't him that was going to change it it wasn't him that was going to make the deal what was it he humbled himself and let god take care of the situation we heard this the other day when brother gerald brother jail this is the quote that started me down this path he says through meekness through sweetness through the holy spirit that we conquer not some great mighty intellectual giant but he that can humble himself is the man who conquers the man who can be kicked around and still be a servant of christ that's the conqueror god help us amen we're going to close with one scripture hebrew six this is paul he says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation we we accept the finished work of calvary right we even get the holy ghost and paul's saying there's more beyond that right we have what we are persuaded better things of you things that come with being a christian things that come with being a son of god things that come with being a daughter of god amen and though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shown toward his name and that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister he says you're doing a lot of work and god is not the one that's uh he'll recognize it he recognizes it he says and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end keep pushing keep pressing is what he's saying don't rest on your laurels don't relax too much right keep pushing keep seeking god more and more in these different situations that we're in amen he says that ye be not slothful right don't be slack be focused be working be pressing be praying be pushing not to do it yourself but be pushing to do what get a hold of him that's where we want to be not slothful and followers of them that through faith and patience inherit the promises for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely i will bless them and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured patiently endured do you endure when things are easy do you endure when things are going great it's real hard to endure when you have a great meal in front of you and it's all prepared and there's money in the bank and a house over here that's not endurance that's enjoyment right he says patiently endure there's going to be trouble struggles there's going to be trials there's going to be tribulations there's going to be difficulties aren't there he says but what after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise that wasn't a perfect walk of abraham we've said it many times right when you go to hebrews it says everything he did right but if you go read the story he did a lot of stuff wrong and only one thing right in the end he had faith that was what abraham did he obeyed god and he did and he had faith but he did a ton of mistakes in there i mean that's a that's a that's a big comfort to me he says for men verily swear by the greater and an o for confirmation is to them an end of all strife so he says men do it and they they sign a contract or they say i'm going to do that and that's the end of it he says but god wearing god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed by an old what he says to those that have a promise from me he says what the immutability of his counsel god cannot change his mind god does not change his mind right it is perfect when he says it and when he commits to it then he's going to do it that's the immutability of his counsel there's no variance in it it doesn't change based on us and he never changes so we don't have to worry about that he confirmed it by note that by two immutable things so the two things are the immutability of his counsel and then that he swore by it swore by himself god doesn't change his counsel doesn't change that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil amen god bless you as we stand together amen he says what we have an anchor of the soul the question is to what are we anchored are we anchored to an experience or are we anchored to a reality if that experience doesn't bring a reality then it's something that's going to fail and then we want to take it all the way to reality amen what cling to god get to the point where you are convinced so brother brown keeps saying be convinced be convinced get a hold of god until you are convinced and you can move forward without fear right without shame without anything that's holding you back to be able to move forward with it and say what god you are my healer god you are my provider god you are my deliverer god you are my redeemer god you are my savior god you are my filler whatever it might be that we have need of what cling to him until he says i'll bless you all right i'm not letting you go until you bless me all right i'll bless you right out wait god right all he's looking for is a relationship all he's trying to do is get you close to him right all he wants is somebody that'll talk to him that'll rest on him that'll dwell with him somebody that'll put him first in those things and that's what happened is god stripped everything away from jacob before he got to the point that he would cling to him if we could only get there first to run quickly to him they meant to run quickly to him when the situation gets tough when we see things building up to say lord i see a lack i don't have everything i need so i'm coming to you and i'm clinging until i can get a revelation of it that settles my soul so that what i can sleep at night so i can rest during the day so that i can have a confidence that you're with me and you're working in the situation amen amen be like jacob then what we walk not with cockiness but with confidence that god is in our lives amen and that he's going to fulfill his word let's just pray heavenly father lord your challenge this morning is to ask us if we'll cling to you amen lord and once we're done clinging will we walk in faith to face the situations lord to face life lord the pace to to face the trials and tribulations that lay before us and lord we're asking for your grace and favor this morning lord you

prevailed he was no longer a slave to fear he was under fear which we all are many times that's what the devil uses you know to try and keep us away from claiming the promise that we have need of
