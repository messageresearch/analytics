[40:25] Lord or to meet the Lord it is to go to
[40:27] church so the Lord is gonna be there
[40:28] with you
[40:29] a man by the grace of God amen so we
[40:33] thank the Lord for His grace toward us
[40:35] and His blessings to us and over this
[40:36] past weekend with our brother George
[40:39] Smith and it's our brothers third trip
[40:43] to Newfoundland so and we trust by the
[40:46] grace of God that he'll be back again
[40:48] maybe to finish his series on the book
[40:50] of Acts and well I didn't want me to
[40:55] preach after he finished on Sunday so I
[40:59] won't get into it we'll see if our
[41:01] brother maybe will agree some time to
[41:03] come back maybe next year sometime and
[41:05] and to finish it if he did sixteen
[41:08] chapters in three services maybe you're
[41:12] doing doing the rest of the book of Acts
[41:14] a man that they in another three
[41:17] services so we'll be in prayer and leave
[41:19] it with the Lord amen and as I said we
[41:23] thank the Lord for that blessing for the
[41:26] Lord to send our birth sister from
[41:30] Tucson here that was in brother been
[41:33] meetings met brother Branham a man
[41:35] experienced the the gift one of the
[41:39] signs that the Lord gave him in his and
[41:41] a man and and also the discernment of
[41:44] the thoughts and intents of her heart
[41:46] a man who it's amazing when we thank the
[41:49] Lord that for her visit and for her
[41:50] testimony and also for our brother
[41:53] George coming and that was brother
[41:55] randoms son-in-law a man so he omit the
[41:58] Prophet personally and he dealt with the
[42:01] Prophet in a very personal way he had to
[42:04] of course being interested in brother
[42:07] Madam's daughter Rebecca and I remember
[42:11] the testimony that they gave one time
[42:12] that that our brother George went to
[42:15] brother branham's home
[42:16] he used the curve that somebody had
[42:19] given brother branham and I understand
[42:22] there brother BAM usually he would not
[42:24] drive that car around Jeffersonville why
[42:27] because it was a cat I was the Cadillac
[42:31] it was a Cadillac and and he said he
[42:35] felt no no I can't drive that around
[42:38] here he did use that a couple of times
[42:40] I'm highway driving from the from
[42:43] Jeffersonville majorly to another city
[42:45] somewhere but not in not in
[42:47] Jeffersonville because he felt it wasn't
[42:49] right for him to be driving such an
[42:52] expensive car that was expensive even
[42:54] back there but he let brother George use
[42:57] it one day when he and sister Rebekah
[43:00] drove around Jeffersonville a man and I
[43:03] and I heard the the tape or the the
[43:06] testimony that they were surprised when
[43:10] they came back to brother Graham's home
[43:13] in Jeffersonville man when they stopped
[43:14] the car
[43:15] they looked behind them there was
[43:17] another car behind them
[43:18] and oh they stopped for a moment there
[43:22] and looked at it and they and it was
[43:24] brother Branham he apparently he had
[43:27] followed them where they went around
[43:29] Jeffersonville and they didn't they
[43:32] didn't realize that until they stopped
[43:34] in front of the house and the person
[43:35] each a man and brother round came up and
[43:38] stopped behind them he was in his
[43:40] regular vehicle a man so the Lord the
[43:44] Prophet allowed our brother George to
[43:46] drive that Cadillac a man so he had to
[43:50] deal with the prophet of God in a very
[43:51] personal way for sure so we thank the
[43:54] Lord for sending our brother George to
[43:56] be with us and administer to us and now
[43:59] he didn't preach but he was teaching and
[44:02] basically that would be the calling then
[44:04] our brother as would be to teach and
[44:07] that's one of the fivefold ministry is
[44:10] teaching a man a teacher but is also a
[44:13] pastor is also the Evangelist and the
[44:16] apostle's and so on so we thank God for
[44:19] our brothers ministry to us and and it
[44:23] was a blessing I've got to say it was a
[44:26] real blessing
[44:27] and we were really encouraged with it
[44:29] and and we were lifted up with the
[44:33] revelation that our brother was bringing
[44:35] to concerning the book of Acts that's
[44:38] good thank the Lord
[44:39] so I trust that we will not forget what
[44:43] we heard will not forget what the Lord
[44:45] was teaching us not not just brother
[44:47] George but it was the Lord I believe it
[44:49] was God anointing the brother to give us
[44:52] the revelation concerning the book of
[44:54] Acts and it's good to know this that the
[44:56] book of Acts is still going on amen that
[45:01] what God started on the day of Pentecost
[45:03] is going right on now from the Alpha
[45:05] ministry to the Omega ministry praise
[45:08] the name of the Lord for a man is again
[45:11] and then I thought about this revelation
[45:13] I said yeah in the back there I said it
[45:16] went from the Jews to the Gentiles but
[45:19] now in the conclusion of the book of
[45:21] Acts it's going to go from the Gentiles
[45:23] back to the Jews a man that's exactly
[45:26] what that's going on right now we know
[45:29] that God's getting Israel ready a man to
[45:32] receive those two messengers in
[45:35] revelation 11 chapter 11 that speaks of
[45:39] the two messengers that God is going to
[45:41] send to Israel and it's either Moses and
[45:44] Elijah or it will be two men with their
[45:47] spirit with their anointing that that
[45:49] kind of a ministry like Moses said and I
[45:51] like Elijah had and so those Israel is
[45:55] really really honestly brother they're
[45:57] getting ready they're those that are
[45:59] spiritual they're getting ready to
[46:01] receive those messengers and they're
[46:03] going to call out the hundred and
[46:04] forty-four thousand a man out of Israel
[46:08] so if only 144,000 out of Israel you
[46:12] know and it's going to be less when it
[46:14] comes to the Gentiles a man 144,000 Jews
[46:17] that are going to be there but but again
[46:20] it's gonna be more Jews than that when
[46:22] it comes to being saved but they're
[46:24] they're there for a special purpose by
[46:26] the grace of God we don't have time to
[46:28] get into those things tonight but we
[46:31] thank God for the revelation of the book
[46:33] of Acts amen they're beginning of it and
[46:36] in the beginning of it you know and
[46:38] going by like Betty brought up
[46:40] concerning the ministry
[46:41] and and the disciples and the apostle's
[46:44] and our brother Paul
[46:46] you know Amen that God chose Paul as his
[46:51] servant praise the name of the Lord just
[46:53] think he killed Christians oh yeah he
[46:56] did and he persecuted the church but he
[46:59] was God's chosen vessel a man seen that
[47:03] that shows you got to keep your attitude
[47:05] right and keep your spirit right a man
[47:08] because just think there was some that
[47:10] never had a right attitude or a right
[47:11] spirit toward Paul and they hated him
[47:13] because because he persecuted the
[47:15] Christians but I guess it was a shock to
[47:20] many of them when they realized that he
[47:21] was God's chosen messenger for that
[47:24] first age a man for the Ephesian age but
[47:28] see that God's ways are not our ways and
[47:31] that God said that he said your thoughts
[47:34] are not my thoughts might your what my
[47:36] ways are not your ways for as high as
[47:38] the heavens are above the earth he says
[47:41] so are my ways and my thoughts above
[47:43] yours a man and they are and brother
[47:46] that proves them when we consider who
[47:48] God chose in the first church age a man
[47:51] and like I said he went from the Jews to
[47:54] the Gentiles and now it's going from the
[47:56] Gentiles back to the Jews a man it is
[47:59] absolutely the truth and the doors
[48:01] closing on the Gentiles but God is
[48:05] opening the door to the juice and
[48:07] brother we know that there's going to be
[48:09] a many many Gentiles during the Great
[48:12] Tribulation that are going to lay down
[48:14] their lives for the gospel many a number
[48:18] that no man could number but they're not
[48:19] bright the bride is not going to go
[48:22] through the Great Tribulation no know
[48:24] where God is going to test us and try us
[48:27] but brother we're going in a
[48:28] resurrection and the rapture by the
[48:30] grace of God so I trust we're looking
[48:33] for it pleased that we're not going to
[48:35] say Lord don't don't don't send the
[48:37] resurrection until maybe in another
[48:39] month don't send the resurrection to
[48:41] another year Lord because I got to do
[48:43] this and I want to do this and I want to
[48:44] do that know no matter what what's going
[48:47] on in your life you want the
[48:49] resurrection any moment a man in a
[48:52] moment in the twinkling of an eye Lord
[48:53] let the rest
[48:54] direction rapture take place we want to
[48:57] go home
[48:57] where do you work where would you rather
[48:59] be right now I don't care what what what
[49:02] kind of life you got and so some it
[49:04] might be all I'm enjoying this life well
[49:07] if you've got the baptism of the Holy
[49:08] Ghost you're not enjoying this life amen
[49:11] oh no no no you're taking your stand for
[49:14] the truth and he's got to give you the
[49:16] revelation of the rapture and you want
[49:18] to get out of here amen you got the
[49:20] revelation of eternity you want to get
[49:22] out of here by the grace of God you want
[49:25] to get out of time and go to eternity
[49:27] brother when we consider what's going on
[49:29] in this world
[49:30] what what reason would you want to stay
[49:33] oh I want to stay for this reason you
[49:35] leave that but the Lord but you but the
[49:38] prophet of God in this hour and they
[49:40] saying why did God do what he did in
[49:42] this age the probably God said he did it
[49:45] to create in the bride a call for the
[49:48] resurrection and the rapture amen God
[49:51] ever he said he said every time he said
[49:54] before God God's going to do this going
[49:56] to do that
[49:57] he said God since the Holy Ghost ahead
[49:59] and he said what for to create in the
[50:01] heart of the people hunger and a thirst
[50:03] he said for what he's going to do amen
[50:06] they got to be praying for what he's
[50:07] going to do Pentecost was praying for
[50:09] the Pentecostal revival a million they
[50:11] were amen now the bride is praying and
[50:14] calling for the rapture and brother any
[50:17] moment amen by the grace of God Lord is
[50:21] not my time he is yours
[50:23] and Lord that you've done this to create
[50:26] in us a call for the rapture and the
[50:28] resurrection that's why that's why the
[50:31] Provost said God is waiting on us and he
[50:35] said the dead in Christ are wienie on us
[50:37] for the resurrection grace of God be
[50:40] with us Brotherhood as we we will
[50:43] eventually get into the message that I
[50:45] want I said the Lord want me to go back
[50:47] to it again and there's a reason that
[50:50] the Lord want me to go back to the
[50:52] message on I have heard but now I see
[50:54] and we've been preaching on hearing and
[50:56] seen but seed doing it God's Way amen

[51:29] see he preached it in November the
[51:31] twenty seventh nineteen sixty-five the
[51:34] next day and I believe a muscleman

[52:55] intellectual a man and we're too many
[52:59] so-called believers and Christians they
[53:01] got intellectual revelation but not
[53:03] spiritual they understand a lot in their
[53:06] heads but they haven't got it in their
[53:08] hearts because in order for it to be in
[53:10] your life it's got to be in your heart

[1:01:32] amen god bless you we're going to go
[1:01:34] into the the message but just before we
[1:01:37] do it's brother George referred to this
[1:01:39] and it is the movie that he referred to
[1:01:43] saying concerning paul the apostle of
[1:01:45] christ and i was wondering what the
[1:01:49] significance was because i received it
[1:01:52] from believers international of course
[1:01:55] that's brother George's ministry in
[1:01:59] Tennessee and I received it when I may
[1:02:03] be ordered something from believers
[1:02:05] International and when I got it and
[1:02:07] received that this was included this dis
[1:02:09] filmed this video on Paul the Apostle
[1:02:12] Christ I'll check them and see exactly
[1:02:14] what it what is like and and see if it's
[1:02:19] reasonable to to show to the church what
[1:02:24] we'll see if we see and I check it amen
[1:02:26] so God's grace again it's a witness to
[1:02:29] the world brother when it comes to the
[1:02:32] witness to us it is the opening the
[1:02:34] seven seals was the witness to the bride
[1:02:36] a man but God is still witnessing to the
[1:02:39] world and God is using this one out
[1:02:41] there and that one out they're not
[1:02:43] bright the prophet said we're not going
[1:02:45] to we're not going to get everyone the
[1:02:47] message to everyone no no the message is
[1:02:49] only for the bride to give the bride
[1:02:51] rapturing faith it's calling out the
[1:02:53] bride giving a rapture faith to go in
[1:02:55] the rapture but the world is still being
[1:02:58] witnessed concerning Jesus Christ and
[1:03:01] what he has done and what he's and what
[1:03:03] he's doing for the world in general
[1:03:05] because it'll get get many ready to go
[1:03:07] into the Great Tribulation and because
[1:03:10] of the witness they're going to lay down
[1:03:11] their lives
[1:03:12] it is the foolish virgin the prophets
[1:03:15] are they are foolish virgins virgins yes
[1:03:17] but he's not the wise virgin of the
[1:03:19] revealed word that's taken sin to the
[1:03:21] resurrection rapture
[1:03:23] it is the foolish virgin that'll they'll
[1:03:24] go into a Great Tribulation but you know
[1:03:27] it'll strike them and they'll they'll
[1:03:29] lay down their lives a man and so
[1:03:32] they'll come forth by the grace of God
[1:03:35] and they'll be outside the city so again
[1:03:38] I'll check it and let you know about it
[1:03:41] to see if we can play it for the church
[1:03:43] again the message is lean not unto thine
[1:03:46] own understanding January 1965 and there
[1:03:51] is an extra copy right here if anybody
[1:03:53] wanted it Amen god bless yes we've
[1:03:57] seated and we're going to turn out to
[1:04:09] the book of Proverbs the first chapter
[1:04:11] and a second chapter or other and the
[1:04:15] first few verses of the Proverbs of two
[1:04:20] beginning with one proverbs two
[1:04:23] beginning with one the continuation of
[1:04:25] Solomon advising his son my son if thou
[1:04:31] will receive I'm sorry I have proverbs 3
[1:04:37] 1 I'm sorry I looked over here on on
[1:04:40] book and I see that it is proverbs 3
[1:04:45] instead of 1 5 - I'm sorry Bob verbs 3 1
[1:04:49] my son forget thought my law but let
[1:04:54] thine heart keep fire commence or length
[1:04:58] of days and long life and peace shall be
[1:05:01] shall be ed to these sets not mercy and
[1:05:07] truth for safety buying them about thy
[1:05:10] neck write them upon the tables of thine
[1:05:14] heart soul shall die find favor and good
[1:05:18] understanding in the sight of God and
[1:05:21] man trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:05:25] heart and lean not unto their own
[1:05:29] understanding in all thy ways
[1:05:32] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:05:36] paths oh I think that's the most
[1:05:38] beautiful scripture now I want to take
[1:05:41] for a text out of the v first lean not
[1:05:48] unto their own understanding
[1:05:51] now this is a
[1:05:54] a very strange text for the day that
[1:05:59] we're living in because the emphasis
[1:06:03] today is certainly laid upon education
[1:06:05] upon our own understanding of things the
[1:06:10] day of learning but we find out here
[1:06:16] that this strange statement like other
[1:06:19] scriptures it has its place and we trust
[1:06:23] that God will let us see where the place
[1:06:25] is
[1:06:25] today we send our children to the school
[1:06:30] to have understanding then HR there
[1:06:34] through the grammar schools we stand in
[1:06:36] the high school for a better
[1:06:38] understanding of knowledge then edger
[1:06:41] there through there some children are
[1:06:43] even fortunate enough to go to college
[1:06:46] and go through college to complete their
[1:06:49] education and their understanding of
[1:06:53] knowledge what they are acquired of by
[1:06:58] many times to get a job you have to have
[1:07:00] a at least a high school understanding
[1:07:03] or college education or so forth yep the
[1:07:08] wise Solomon told us that not to lean to
[1:07:12] it up to our own understanding learn not
[1:07:17] of these things because we wonder why
[1:07:21] that he would say such a thing is this
[1:07:23] or it's because it usually our modern
[1:07:28] understanding is usually the wisdom of
[1:07:32] man which is contrary to the Word of God
[1:07:35] I think that's what if Solomon was
[1:07:38] trying to advise his son was not to be
[1:07:41] illiterate but not to lean to their
[1:07:45] understanding and I think it would be a
[1:07:48] good excitation today if we said to our
[1:07:53] sons and to the sons of God that it's
[1:07:58] alright to have an education there's
[1:08:00] nothing against that but when that
[1:08:02] education is contrary to the Word of God
[1:08:07] then lean to the word and let your
[1:08:10] education go thank the cause the word
[1:08:14] and education will stand and will give
[1:08:18] you a good job probably a good standing
[1:08:20] amongst intellectual people but that's
[1:08:24] alright which will probably be a great
[1:08:26] help to you help you in your financial
[1:08:28] and your your livelihood make living
[1:08:31] maybe a little better for you but
[1:08:32] remember one thing my son you've got to
[1:08:36] die no matter how much education you got
[1:08:39] how much culture you're able to
[1:08:41] accumulate you've yet got to face death
[1:08:44] because it is written that man must die
[1:08:47] and after that the judgment
[1:08:50] yes and God when death is not so bad but
[1:08:53] coming to the judgment is the bad boy ha
[1:08:56] you can die but after that the judgment
[1:08:59] and God is not going to inquire of you
[1:09:03] how much schooling you got when you were
[1:09:06] here on earth how much knowledge you
[1:09:08] accumulate whether you've got your
[1:09:11] Bachelor of Art or whatever degree you
[1:09:13] might have it even as the minister it's
[1:09:15] not going to be required of you but it's
[1:09:18] going to be required of you what you did
[1:09:21] about the understanding of God's Word
[1:09:24] yes II Men that's where the requirement
[1:09:27] come because that's your education fine
[1:09:31] but the Word of God is left my word is
[1:09:36] life yes and to know it is life and he
[1:09:40] is that know him he is the word yes so
[1:09:44] you can only know him by the word for he
[1:09:46] is third that's the only way you'll know
[1:09:48] him is by his word somebody could come
[1:09:51] up say this is God or that's daughter
[1:09:52] this is Guara this is right and that's
[1:09:55] right but we come back to the word which
[1:09:56] is the truth and the word is just like
[1:10:00] the the North Star it's a true star no
[1:10:05] matter which way the worlds of floating
[1:10:07] that North Star is centered with the
[1:10:09] earth you set your compass to the North
[1:10:11] Star it's always in the center of the
[1:10:14] earth other stars float around with the
[1:10:16] world but the North Star stay stable now
[1:10:20] compass is the holy spirit and the your
[1:10:24] your typos would be the North Star so
[1:10:27] the Holy Spirit will always part towards
[1:10:30] the words the Holy Spirit will never
[1:10:32] lead you to anything else but the Word
[1:10:35] of God so how could a man except decreed
[1:10:39] what is contrary to the word and then
[1:10:42] still say he has the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost had taught you away from that it
[1:10:49] takes the Holy Spirit to point you to
[1:10:52] the word for he is the world he is the
[1:10:56] word it can only as the as the magnet
[1:11:00] Indiana compass is only set toward the
[1:11:03] North Pole that's the only way it can
[1:11:05] draw and when the Holy Spirit is the
[1:11:08] author and rider and the quicken ER of
[1:11:12] the word how can it point the person to
[1:11:14] anything else but the word so when a
[1:11:17] person says they have the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:20] accept something contrary to the word it
[1:11:23] shows that ain't the genuine Holy Ghost
[1:11:25] they got think it may be a ghost I
[1:11:28] wouldn't dispute that but it it is the
[1:11:31] Holy Ghost a pride
[1:11:33] now you know many times they take one
[1:11:37] another spirit and so that might part in
[1:11:40] a like a group Amman to a certain things
[1:11:42] but it won't it won't part to Christ but
[1:11:48] the Holy Spirit always ports to Christ
[1:11:50] and Christ is the word we see this so
[1:11:53] plainly in the Bible or I do maybe I be
[1:11:57] wrong but my thinking but I don't think
[1:12:01] so because that this lean not to your
[1:12:06] own understanding of thing if you lead
[1:12:10] to your own understanding then you're
[1:12:12] bound to get off of the right Road
[1:12:15] you can't leave to anyone else's
[1:12:18] understanding when it comes to life
[1:12:21] they're fine life you've got to lean to
[1:12:24] the word man that's life we see this
[1:12:28] from the beginning it's so plainly made
[1:12:32] known to us from the
[1:12:34] beginning at God gave his first family
[1:12:37] on earth his word to live by only his
[1:12:42] word was deliver that's not through
[1:12:45] eating the food and so forth but his
[1:12:46] word they were to live by eternally and
[1:12:50] as long as they kept that word they
[1:12:53] lived eternally well the first little
[1:12:57] fries of that work was misplaced the
[1:13:02] whole chain broke and the human race
[1:13:04] plunged into death he how we noticed Eve
[1:13:11] which was no doubt an intelligent person
[1:13:16] the first cut off of Adam who was the
[1:13:21] son of God and Eve certainly being in
[1:13:26] that pot or there had been no sin no
[1:13:31] place for sin he certainly must had a
[1:13:34] wonderful conception of what God was
[1:13:38] because ever afternoon she and her
[1:13:43] husband walk in the cool of the guard
[1:13:46] levy and talk face to face with God
[1:13:52] what a an on reasonable thing that a
[1:13:58] person who would won't face to face with
[1:14:01] God each day and that would turn to the
[1:14:05] reasoning of something that reason her
[1:14:07] away from the Word of God we still gotta
[1:14:12] tell you told me be reasoned away from
[1:14:16] the Word of God after setting in the
[1:14:19] presence of God seeing the Word of God
[1:14:23] preached the Word of God made manifest
[1:14:26] drunkards and sinners come to the altar
[1:14:29] and be converted and made new creatures
[1:14:32] in Christ
[1:14:34] people of ill-fame made
[1:14:37] ladies and gentlemen and then to turn
[1:14:41] from that blessed thing that led him to
[1:14:45] this life
[1:14:47] and then he preferred it off after some
[1:14:50] kind of a creed you become more popular
[1:14:53] or get into what they would call a
[1:14:56] better price to people while you're in
[1:14:59] the best class that there is tons of
[1:15:03] daughters of God I don't like that
[1:15:06] company better not wear with all the
[1:15:07] kings and Pope takes it everything else
[1:15:10] give me that whole bunch of people if
[1:15:12] they don't throw the right hand from the
[1:15:15] left as long as they know God and loving
[1:15:18] and serving that's the celebrity of
[1:15:20] heaven to me yes sir now but we find
[1:15:26] that Eve was easy persuaded by Satan
[1:15:30] from the Word of God and she lead on her
[1:15:34] own understanding because Satan had
[1:15:39] projected something to her which wasn't
[1:15:41] there her real understanding of God but
[1:15:44] she had something else told to her by
[1:15:46] the enemy Satan as she believed it down
[1:15:49] we find the results of this it plunged
[1:15:53] the whole human race to death because
[1:15:56] the first mother on the earth leaned to
[1:16:03] her own understandings contrary to the
[1:16:06] Word of God and plunge the whole human
[1:16:10] race today how can you believe that
[1:16:13] that's the word well a woman is always
[1:16:17] the church in the bible is type to woman
[1:16:20] and a church today can accept a bunch of
[1:16:24] dogmas are Creed's and puns the whole
[1:16:28] congregation in a separation from God
[1:16:33] those people who stop those things in
[1:16:37] the state of the Word of God are just
[1:16:40] like even it's been done over over till
[1:16:42] it's got this whole generation punched
[1:16:45] away from the Word of God and when the
[1:16:48] word is made manifest the word is
[1:16:50] revealed they won't accept it because
[1:16:53] they won't do it because they lean to
[1:16:56] their
[1:16:57] understanding this church is built here
[1:17:00] it's a beautiful place it's a great
[1:17:02] organization it's a member of a great
[1:17:04] body of people why should we blog that
[1:17:06] I'll trust in it just not in your own
[1:17:10] understanding but trust in the word of
[1:17:13] the Lord now now it ended finally in
[1:17:17] death to the whole race as I said Fame
[1:17:20] is now to the many people who rely upon
[1:17:23] their own understanding their dogmas and
[1:17:26] creeds and so forth blaming the word God
[1:17:30] is not altogether truth that some of it
[1:17:33] is inspired and some is not how can you
[1:17:36] have faith in a Bible if part of it is
[1:17:39] inspired and part of it's not if one if
[1:17:42] one quotation is wrong then the whole
[1:17:46] thing might be wrong it's all got to be
[1:17:49] right exactly right and some of these so
[1:17:54] called perverted Bible schools teaching
[1:17:57] man's knowledge of cumulation where they
[1:18:00] get together instead in a council of
[1:18:03] people and say now look if the days of
[1:18:06] miracles that ended in the days of the
[1:18:08] Apostles and many man under the bishop
[1:18:12] for the harm in which sit there and say
[1:18:14] well if I can just agree with him no
[1:18:17] doubt but I might be in line next for
[1:18:19] his position see then your leave to your
[1:18:21] own understanding instead of standing on
[1:18:23] your two feet for the word of God that's
[1:18:27] what causes these things some time ago
[1:18:29] someone has in a dispute on an income
[1:18:33] tax and they said to me said why your
[1:18:36] trustees are nothing but puppets are
[1:18:38] supposed I said I by a trustee on the
[1:18:40] board that had a different idea and
[1:18:43] wouldn't stand up and I'll turn about it
[1:18:46] would express his own views of him I
[1:18:48] throw him off the board
[1:18:49] yes sir thought was contrary to my
[1:18:51] belief I wanted to express what he
[1:18:53] thinks is right that's what I got him
[1:18:55] therefore see what he says about it but
[1:18:58] we have it notice Jesus said in Saint
[1:19:01] John 10 my sheep know my boy
[1:19:06] a voice of course is his word when he's
[1:19:09] speaking my sheep know my voice my voice
[1:19:13] has been proven to them to be true it's
[1:19:16] been vindicated that it is my voice now
[1:19:21] now notice they are not subject to
[1:19:24] follow in any other voice
[1:19:27] they won't my sheep know my voice and a
[1:19:32] stranger they will not follow in other
[1:19:35] words they will not understand a
[1:19:37] theological voice that's teaching
[1:19:39] contrary to the word the sheep don't
[1:19:42] understand that no more than the Eagle
[1:19:44] less I could understand the clucking of
[1:19:46] the hymn they don't understand the cause
[1:19:50] he wasn't eagle and that's the same
[1:19:52] thing with a genuine born-again child of
[1:19:56] God they understand only the things that
[1:19:59] are of God now somebody say when I look
[1:20:02] you can do this I think it's I believe
[1:20:04] that it isn't this the way I believe
[1:20:06] that the days of miracles just fast I
[1:20:08] don't believe that that's divine healing
[1:20:10] I don't believe this
[1:20:11] now a genuine born-again Christian
[1:20:13] that'll never stop it is you you don't
[1:20:16] understand it at all and how could a man
[1:20:19] that believes in God and can read the
[1:20:21] Bible and see that he's the same
[1:20:23] yesterday there forever will ever accept
[1:20:25] such a thing is that I don't understand
[1:20:27] it don't they do not lean to their own
[1:20:31] understanding just like a baby you take
[1:20:34] a little baby and let it be born and let
[1:20:38] him once lean upon his mother's bosom
[1:20:41] nurse from hers the warm milk leave his
[1:20:45] little head a born or bosom doe he's
[1:20:47] just a few hours old in a day or two
[1:20:50] from then take him away from his mother
[1:20:52] and give him over all the breast of a
[1:20:55] strange mother you kick that little of
[1:20:58] feet up yeah and yell it's not his
[1:21:00] mother
[1:21:01] think he is already had a something of
[1:21:05] body because he is a part of this mother
[1:21:10] yet Nature has provided him a way to
[1:21:12] know his own mama and if nature has
[1:21:16] provided a way for
[1:21:18] babies and would smother forwards born
[1:21:20] from how much more is he a son of God
[1:21:23] that's born of the Spirit he knows his
[1:21:27] mama he knows because he was born of the
[1:21:32] word and he understands the word put him
[1:21:36] in a strange place he certainly is out
[1:21:39] of out of place he'll get out of there
[1:21:41] as quick as he can because he has he
[1:21:44] doesn't leave somebody saying I wait
[1:21:46] dear this is your mama now it's not his
[1:21:48] mama because he has the way of knowing
[1:21:51] it he's part of this mother that's his
[1:21:54] mother no one else can ever take her
[1:21:56] please he knows his own mother
[1:21:58] notice how is how it is really so God
[1:22:03] has made everything after its kind the
[1:22:07] cattle add to their time any time in
[1:22:09] bringing around up down we bring the
[1:22:11] whole herd the cattle and the little
[1:22:14] cash I used to wonder how they would
[1:22:16] ever know they're all mama now they the
[1:22:19] coming down out of the mountains the
[1:22:22] cattle all mixed together a cow that is
[1:22:26] a with the cat maybe a little hungry cat
[1:22:29] night nurse a little from the other
[1:22:32] mother if he's real hungry but when we
[1:22:34] stop him out on the Prairie that mama
[1:22:37] starts today brother cows and calves she
[1:22:40] finds her own and their cap is running
[1:22:42] hard mother it knows that certain old
[1:22:44] wine her ball and she's bawling for that
[1:22:47] cap the other mothers are ball engine
[1:22:49] you can't even hear yourself ain't but
[1:22:52] that little calf will find that all of
[1:22:55] its mother they call just part of the
[1:22:58] matter Lord and a born-again Christian
[1:23:03] from heaven he is a part of this world
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:10] another mama
[1:23:11] he will not follow he's a part of the
[1:23:14] word he stays with the word if the
[1:23:17] trumpet give an uncertain sound who can
[1:23:19] prepare yourself for battle said Paul he
[1:23:21] knows the sound of the word notice help
[1:23:25] how this is the predestinated hand of
[1:23:29] God fallen them through
[1:23:32] he knows that he was ordained he was in
[1:23:36] the gospel truth he know that he was
[1:23:39] born by the Spirit of God he knows that
[1:23:41] the Spirit of God cannot deny the Word
[1:23:44] of God so therefore a stranger he will
[1:23:49] not follow notice how I was looking back
[1:23:53] your honor
[1:23:54] note that I had wrote down here a past
[1:23:57] fine but I just happened to see the
[1:24:00] scripture reading thought I'd refer back
[1:24:02] to it again notice how his own
[1:24:06] predestinated sheep followed him right
[1:24:09] in the days of the greatest theologians
[1:24:13] that we ever had they come right out
[1:24:16] because they knew him they knew what the
[1:24:19] word had promised for that day they know
[1:24:23] what the Messiah was to be like when he
[1:24:26] came and Simon Peter came three which
[1:24:29] was only Simon there and Andrew had
[1:24:33] tried to kill him about that this man is
[1:24:36] the Messiah whilst I'm in of course he
[1:24:38] was maybe a little hard-headed he
[1:24:41] wouldn't go but when he walked up into
[1:24:43] the presence of Jesus or Jesus said your
[1:24:48] name is Simon and you are the son of
[1:24:51] Jonas now we know that Jesus told his
[1:24:56] apostles that he knew him and he before
[1:24:59] the foundation of the world
[1:25:00] they were the attributes of his thoughts
[1:25:03] therefore being that seed lay in him and
[1:25:07] he knew that the word said and had been
[1:25:11] promised that the Messiah would be a
[1:25:13] prophet and when he seemed that he was
[1:25:16] true officially he knew then that he had
[1:25:19] stopped his nets because he's been gobos
[1:25:22] become a Fisher of man part now there
[1:25:26] stood others standing there who seen the
[1:25:28] same thing that acquainted a evil spirit
[1:25:32] that was the theologians because it
[1:25:35] wasn't in the taste of their theological
[1:25:38] teaching and they turned it down because
[1:25:41] they leaned
[1:25:43] their own understanding father doctor my
[1:25:47] Jesus Christ came in the fulfillment of
[1:25:50] the word of promise and they were to
[1:25:53] gone to see it they leaned upon what the
[1:25:57] priests tape and if all of the church
[1:26:00] said and still upon what God said about
[1:26:03] Jesus rebuked impart he said
[1:26:07] search the Scriptures for in them you
[1:26:10] cleave you have everlasting life and
[1:26:13] they are they that testify of me these
[1:26:17] scriptures out of s here to search they
[1:26:20] tell you who I am
[1:26:22] yes but they wouldn't lean to what the
[1:26:25] word said but they lean to what their
[1:26:28] understanding law they leave to their
[1:26:32] own understanding and the scripture
[1:26:34] tells us that they were failed the fail
[1:26:38] of their own theology has them blind
[1:26:43] you say brother Branham
[1:26:47] what are you getting at I'm just getting
[1:26:50] to this that thing is occurring again so
[1:26:54] man women and people will lead to a
[1:26:58] certain church that they have charged
[1:27:00] that belonged to no matter what the Word
[1:27:03] of God says about it they go right on
[1:27:05] with that CD to their own understanding
[1:27:07] and ignoring the Word of God as if it
[1:27:09] that's never even been written it's a
[1:27:14] sermon high speed of human life
[1:27:17] it's got the physical life but no
[1:27:20] spiritual life end up to be quickened
[1:27:22] the big it was over their face now I
[1:27:25] noticed they had their own thoughts of
[1:27:28] what God should be they had their own
[1:27:30] ideas of what the size should be but the
[1:27:34] word said what the massage should be now
[1:27:37] see they had their own understanding of
[1:27:40] what he would be no God for what the
[1:27:42] high priest said oh my priests under me
[1:27:46] now when the Messiah comes we've built a
[1:27:48] great temple year we'd all this is the
[1:27:51] Bible said he'll quickly come to his
[1:27:52] temple in all these things what he does
[1:27:54] the Messiah will come right up here
[1:27:56] and recognize himself with us and say I
[1:27:59] am the Messiah I have arrived I am that
[1:28:03] Messiah that you've been looking for
[1:28:05] well why did did come he come in such a
[1:28:09] different way from what they thought it
[1:28:10] would they didn't recognize it they
[1:28:14] didn't know who he was but he is oh it
[1:28:17] what if some hypocrite
[1:28:18] what a Walter Benson I am the Messiah
[1:28:21] I'm dr. so-and-so they would have
[1:28:24] accepted it but when you come to any man
[1:28:27] that was born with a darkened birth
[1:28:30] behind him no education of any school he
[1:28:34] ever went to to learn no seminary did he
[1:28:38] have no fellowship part but he was the
[1:28:44] interpretation of faith oh did I tell
[1:28:52] you who I am I do not the worst that was
[1:28:56] promised I do then believe me not and
[1:28:58] could we not apply that to this day when
[1:29:02] the Holy Ghost comes if they want to
[1:29:04] part of some other age when he comes
[1:29:07] into action and the demonstration of his
[1:29:10] power of eternal life the people or a
[1:29:14] corner a wild fanaticism wow they are
[1:29:17] leading to their own understanding and
[1:29:20] up to the word of the Lord you know
[1:29:24] that's right the identification that God
[1:29:27] own interpretation is the manifestation
[1:29:32] of the promise maybe I'll stick make a
[1:29:36] little plainer when God speaks the word
[1:29:38] he doesn't need any man or any form
[1:29:42] under no one else just say what that
[1:29:44] means
[1:29:45] when you say well you say God meant this
[1:29:48] God means just what he says
[1:29:51] now how does he interpret his own word
[1:29:54] by fulfilling him the Bible said a
[1:29:58] virgin shall conceive she did that don't
[1:30:01] need any interpretation God said let
[1:30:04] there be light and there was that don't
[1:30:06] need any interpretation God said also
[1:30:09] that in these rice days
[1:30:11] hit pour out his spirit upon all flesh I
[1:30:15] don't need any interpretation that only
[1:30:18] needs an exception somebody to accept
[1:30:21] what God is done it doesn't need an
[1:30:23] interpretation God interprets his own
[1:30:26] word God promised the things that we see
[1:30:29] day by day that he were doing in the
[1:30:31] last day people today like it was then
[1:30:34] they leaned upon their own understanding
[1:30:36] my pastor says that that's fanaticism
[1:30:38] but the Bible said it would happen yeah
[1:30:41] Zeus understand ego to lean upon the
[1:30:45] Bible promised in the last days that the
[1:30:47] lady of steer church age would get so
[1:30:49] rich and get salt in Sofia its
[1:30:54] sufficiency other own I am rich I have
[1:30:57] neither nothing I said as the Queen and
[1:31:00] she's rich and he said thou knowest it
[1:31:04] not that you are miserable that's the
[1:31:07] entire church age the church to the
[1:31:12] Church of radio see you are naked run
[1:31:17] poor miserable yeah don't know it
[1:31:21] setting inner riches ten thousand times
[1:31:24] ten thousands and thousands of members
[1:31:27] whittle for the world air hand almost
[1:31:30] butter you know all together they for
[1:31:33] the Catholic Church sort of Protestant
[1:31:34] together as you're going together they
[1:31:36] got the well to the world we are busted
[1:31:40] in this nation just about where's
[1:31:42] barring on tax that will be paid in
[1:31:44] forty years from now they tell me so
[1:31:46] they set a lifeline
[1:31:48] that's this we're standing out will be
[1:31:51] paid forty years from now my little
[1:31:53] grandson if Jesus carries the taxes that
[1:31:56] he'll pay when he's 40 years old we're
[1:31:57] spending on it now sending too far day
[1:32:01] than her own
[1:32:02] hymns and they starving today trying to
[1:32:06] buy fellowship you don't find fellowship
[1:32:09] you don't buy freedom no but that's what
[1:32:13] we're doing that's way we're set up
[1:32:15] that's the people to ever think they can
[1:32:17] get owned a tax tax tax and will not be
[1:32:21] on a war debt first for hundreds of
[1:32:24] years yet uh suppose as we've been
[1:32:26] thrown into by politicians and now we
[1:32:30] shouldn't be that way there's no reason
[1:32:32] for us to be that way but the churches
[1:32:34] themselves has become rich or near the
[1:32:38] well for the world says the Bible blazed
[1:32:40] in the Catholic Church that's why Russia
[1:32:42] run her out while Russia excommunicate
[1:32:46] asked was the very grassroots of
[1:32:47] communism that calls the church talk to
[1:32:50] be something it wasn't no more for the
[1:32:51] rest of the world woman's up there in
[1:32:54] Finland that little I was raised in the
[1:32:55] dead that's to them Russian soldiers at
[1:32:57] attention and they said we will receive
[1:33:00] a God that can raise up the dead we have
[1:33:03] made denominations and schools and and
[1:33:06] buildings and failed to do what Jesus
[1:33:09] told us do is preach the gospel we tried
[1:33:14] to educate the world
[1:33:15] he never said educate the world he that
[1:33:18] educators should be safe you've got to
[1:33:20] be born again that's the reason we have
[1:33:26] so miserably failed everywhere right see
[1:33:29] we got the well we got the thing now
[1:33:32] what will happen when this a church
[1:33:36] World Council of Churches goes together
[1:33:39] can't you see who's gonna do the levy
[1:33:42] thank you Methodists and Presbyterians
[1:33:45] understand that the rest of you even to
[1:33:48] Pentecostal church right you sit you're
[1:33:50] not on the end you'll either go ahead or
[1:33:53] you bust up the denomination you do or
[1:33:56] the other it's right before you got to
[1:33:58] do it it's a forcing the mark of the
[1:34:01] beast that's what it is that that is the
[1:34:04] nomination ISM absolutely I prove it by
[1:34:07] the Bible is the mark of the beast
[1:34:09] there's a she had prostitute
[1:34:13] daughters and we know that that is the
[1:34:15] truth organized religion it's contrary
[1:34:18] to the word and it's Antichrist in its
[1:34:20] principles not everything in there's
[1:34:23] Antichrist but in its principle
[1:34:25] principles its system is Antichrist
[1:34:28] because it's against the Word of God
[1:34:31] ever organized system is that way there
[1:34:35] are senior Lee into somebody else's own
[1:34:38] under their understanding instead of
[1:34:40] leading to God to understand what God
[1:34:43] said about it that's reason it's wrong
[1:34:46] boys go off to seminaries who has good
[1:34:48] education off to these Bible schools so
[1:34:50] clone and maybe they got it got call of
[1:34:53] God in their heart and they get out
[1:34:55] there and there is so in documented what
[1:34:58] one view if so it's those that at
[1:35:01] bishops or and so this one said it that
[1:35:03] one says the council man agrees this
[1:35:04] where it should be
[1:35:05] don't care what anybody says jesus said
[1:35:09] let every man's word bli and mind be the
[1:35:11] truth matter whose it is I be the truth
[1:35:17] now how do we know what's truth when the
[1:35:19] Bible that cares if something will
[1:35:21] happen if something's gonna take place
[1:35:23] and it happens that way now the Bible
[1:35:28] said in her bosom oh well for the world
[1:35:31] gold silver now if we're on the gold
[1:35:34] standard and where it broke now what's
[1:35:38] going to happen what's going to happen
[1:35:40] you know the rich people of this nation
[1:35:44] these big factories in whiskey man
[1:35:47] tobacco man and so forth like that is
[1:35:51] not going to stand to change the
[1:35:52] currency so the only thing would have to
[1:35:55] is buy and there's only one place we can
[1:35:58] bar it and when we do we start
[1:36:01] birthright opportunity
[1:36:04] then what are you gonna do your own by
[1:36:07] their that system there's nothing else
[1:36:10] you can do old people don't they are you
[1:36:13] may think I'm crazy but what my boys the
[1:36:16] solace of death these tapes will still
[1:36:18] be playing you'll recognize or whatever
[1:36:20] I'm the bag a bit more silly person to
[1:36:25] take the stand that I have to even
[1:36:27] against this stain yeah I would be a big
[1:36:31] just God I think esteverena five just if
[1:36:35] I had well what's wrong in my thinking
[1:36:39] it with my calling the thing would be
[1:36:42] against God but I've tough I stand
[1:36:45] because I see it here in the world
[1:36:47] it's God's Word they not see it being
[1:36:50] vindicated proven that it's the truth
[1:36:52] that's the interpretation that God gives
[1:36:57] off his word God's own interpretation of
[1:37:00] his word is how he indicates it makes it
[1:37:03] true why were these Pharisees blind what
[1:37:07] made them survive because they would not
[1:37:10] accept revelation or vindication of the
[1:37:16] work and that's reason to pay that the
[1:37:20] churches are blind is because they won't
[1:37:23] accept revelation that's been vindicated
[1:37:27] if the word sessile is revealed and then
[1:37:31] it's proven still they won't accept it
[1:37:34] that's the reason these Jews the Jews -
[1:37:37] this thing will not you cannot talk to
[1:37:40] him about Christ because the veil is
[1:37:43] still over their face blinded this and a
[1:37:47] church you can't talk to him about the
[1:37:49] Full Gospel in the power of God because
[1:37:51] a god of this firm has glide to them
[1:37:55] from the truth of God and they lean to
[1:37:58] their own understanding when women come
[1:38:01] into the church and follow off their
[1:38:04] hair the coarser pastures tells him all
[1:38:08] that surah that man's crazy but the
[1:38:10] Bible said she's done wrong when she
[1:38:13] doesn't
[1:38:14] refused to answer a prayer and some of
[1:38:16] them women make another disgrace to try
[1:38:19] to be a preacher then she's on the BB
[1:38:22] her father said she should not do that
[1:38:24] none of it but the church organization
[1:38:27] will receive it and are dangerous stand
[1:38:30] her out they're landing to their own
[1:38:31] understanding one word of God misplaced
[1:38:37] or misconstrued or not accepted breaks
[1:38:39] the whole chain mansion out there by
[1:38:43] bread alone but by every word that
[1:38:44] proceedeth out of the mouth of God why
[1:38:47] is it women you hear me preach against
[1:38:49] these things
[1:38:50] where is shorts and paints and and
[1:38:52] hairdos of this year bobbed hair and all
[1:38:55] that kind of stuff and then every year
[1:38:57] when I come back you're still set to the
[1:38:59] same condition if the cause you're
[1:39:01] leading to your own understanding and
[1:39:03] other
[1:39:07] the pastor's why don't you clean up your
[1:39:10] church because you're going to hear
[1:39:12] denominational credence to the word of
[1:39:14] the Lord
[1:39:16] let's lean not to your own understanding
[1:39:20] well lead not to your own understanding
[1:39:24] but upon the word of the Lord they were
[1:39:28] not accepted because they would not
[1:39:30] accept vindication Jesus come with a a
[1:39:34] gospel just exactly the way he said he
[1:39:36] would come even many times John was the
[1:39:40] longer confused when he was thrown into
[1:39:42] prison
[1:39:43] and he uh he got out there and he had
[1:39:46] preached that there was coming into
[1:39:47] Messiah Hussein was in his hand his
[1:39:50] early purchase Lord burned the chaff of
[1:39:52] that pushpa fire gather the wheat into
[1:39:54] the garner the Spirit of God bringing
[1:39:57] forth launching out of him like a like a
[1:39:59] fountain and then when he seen Jesus
[1:40:02] come on the scene the little meek lowly
[1:40:05] started to develop and pushed around
[1:40:06] around here for his life and over there
[1:40:09] while they did John couldn't understand
[1:40:11] it so he sent some of his disciples to
[1:40:14] find out from Jesus if he really wants
[1:40:17] to one water disarm to Jesus after that
[1:40:20] prophet standing on the water with the
[1:40:22] Word of God said I knew he because I've
[1:40:24] seen de done a holy spirit like a dove
[1:40:26] God just sitting for more than like a
[1:40:28] dove and going into you I heard a voice
[1:40:31] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[1:40:33] son and then John said who asked him if
[1:40:36] really he was the one or do we look for
[1:40:40] another now jesus never sent him a book
[1:40:43] on how to behave in prison huh what
[1:40:47] church he should have joined but he said
[1:40:49] stay around a little while and watch
[1:40:51] what happens
[1:40:53] and then go show John the things that
[1:40:57] you have seen and done because that is
[1:41:01] works that he did vindicated him to be
[1:41:04] the Messiah the Son of God blessed is he
[1:41:07] who is not offended in me so many have
[1:41:11] become offended so many people get
[1:41:13] offended so easy at the word of God it's
[1:41:16] contrary they want to lean to their own
[1:41:19] understanding they don't want to take
[1:41:21] the word of the law and they have to go
[1:41:23] just the way that that says they've been
[1:41:25] taught to go and they waited it there
[1:41:27] how their church leans upon it no matter
[1:41:30] if God promised he'd hidden rain i have
[1:41:32] rain in the morning in the church said
[1:41:33] that's nonsense they'd believe the
[1:41:35] church is to the god they cause what
[1:41:37] they're born of the church but a man is
[1:41:40] born of God his other seat of God and
[1:41:43] the seat of God is the word of God and
[1:41:45] he only lives by that that's his life
[1:41:48] now they leaned all to their own
[1:41:51] understanding but that is what to lean
[1:41:54] on God's Word they know better it was in
[1:41:57] the scripture
[1:41:58] they called it an evil spirit that man
[1:42:00] calls why their preset anybody that goes
[1:42:04] to hear this man preach they'll be put
[1:42:06] out of the synagogue when a man was
[1:42:09] healed that was fine once by Jesus even
[1:42:12] his parents so happy about the eating
[1:42:14] but there was afraid to confess that it
[1:42:16] was Jesus that did yeah I said he said
[1:42:19] is this your son said yes sir who made
[1:42:21] me well sir I don't know said he's the
[1:42:23] beige you asked him he thought for
[1:42:25] himself because he'd have been said that
[1:42:27] any man that leave to hear Christ
[1:42:30] understanding instead if their
[1:42:32] understanding would be put out of their
[1:42:34] church now isn't that just the same I
[1:42:36] asked you a fine blank question right
[1:42:39] it's a drew the same thing no matter
[1:42:41] what God does it has to be according
[1:42:44] their understanding not what God
[1:42:45] indicates to be the truth now and that
[1:42:49] man had the answer all he said who he
[1:42:52] was he said one called Jesus of Nazareth
[1:42:54] that he's a sinner we don't offer which
[1:42:57] he come instead now that's a strange
[1:42:59] thing
[1:43:00] here's folks be the leaders of this hour
[1:43:03] here's a man open my eyes they have the
[1:43:07] mint don't sense a whirl beginning yep
[1:43:09] you say you don't know from their own
[1:43:15] understanding instead of the word of the
[1:43:18] Lord because Isaiah said the blind would
[1:43:20] see believe would be heart deserts
[1:43:25] should break forth and joy but to see
[1:43:28] they lead to their own understanding not
[1:43:31] to the word their own system they have
[1:43:33] brought up now notice the churches of
[1:43:37] today do the same thing they have a farm
[1:43:40] of great super race of understanding in
[1:43:44] their denominational systems that they
[1:43:46] have such a super understanding they
[1:43:48] don't want nobody else to fool with it
[1:43:50] nobody to come in unless they belong to
[1:43:52] that group don't tell me
[1:43:55] Eileen in Tucson Arizona I come down
[1:43:58] there three years ago I met with the
[1:44:00] Council of Churches not that I never
[1:44:02] come to start a church I come to
[1:44:03] fellowship with you

[1:44:13] Indiana I said I come here because the
[1:44:16] Lord led me here a division I'm going to
[1:44:18] stay for a while now unless he leaves me
[1:44:20] away but I never come to start a church
[1:44:22] I've come to help here brother
[1:44:24] that's been three years ago I've never
[1:44:26] been invited to one place Wow the goal
[1:44:31] there was to get together right after
[1:44:32] that instead of any man had me in their
[1:44:34] bullpen they would X commute that
[1:44:36] preacher say walk to their own
[1:44:39] understanding cert me that's it is so
[1:44:46] called they formed their super
[1:44:48] understanding bless you put your name on
[1:44:50] their book you're saying you're lost
[1:44:52] I'm Minister told me that all you say
[1:44:54] that was a some quack it's a Pentecostal
[1:44:58] that born Arthur listen that even Dallas
[1:45:01] Texas he said he's gonna have to take a
[1:45:03] man off the book on sir why cause he
[1:45:05] fellowship with you answer well take it
[1:45:06] off he said what he's lost then after
[1:45:09] lost I said with these names
[1:45:11] I'll say you mean your district prosper
[1:45:13] you believe that so that's the truth I
[1:45:16] said get off the phone mister
[1:45:18] that is the grace of God that co1 spirit
[1:45:23] we are all baptized into one body in the
[1:45:27] coffers of that body I don't care what
[1:45:31] brands you got on you
[1:45:32] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:45:34] you are absolutely a Christian by birth
[1:45:37] that's the only way the only way you can
[1:45:39] be not the journey not the Creed's not
[1:45:41] exciting history or reciting this or any
[1:45:43] other thing or about education theology
[1:45:45] or Christian when you're born again and
[1:45:48] you cannot be born again less you've
[1:45:50] been elected to be born again but don't
[1:45:52] make it come to me except my father
[1:45:54] draws it in all that the father has
[1:45:56] given me will come hey I'll raise him up
[1:46:01] against the last a great so-called Bible
[1:46:04] schools we have this they lean upon
[1:46:06] their own alone worthy oh hey no matter
[1:46:11] what the word says they can so plainly
[1:46:13] explain it Oh to their own self make
[1:46:17] your own selves believe it and their own
[1:46:19] kind believe it that the days the
[1:46:21] miracles is fast there is no such thing
[1:46:23] as prophet prophet fossils there is no
[1:46:26] such thing as gifts of healing and so
[1:46:27] forth it all ended back in the Bible
[1:46:29] days they can make themselves believe
[1:46:31] that you know the Bible said you can
[1:46:34] believe Allah and be damned by hey
[1:46:38] that's exactly the truth they all no
[1:46:40] matter what the Word of God says they
[1:46:42] lead to their own understanding they
[1:46:44] they lean on it they believe it they
[1:46:46] think it's the truth you can keep
[1:46:48] believing a lie over and over and over
[1:46:49] to tell us the truth are you fine well
[1:46:53] how do we know what is truth or not God
[1:46:54] proves it's truth anymore
[1:46:56] and he have indicated he does his own
[1:46:58] interpretation of it how did you get
[1:47:03] through this they do it by their culture
[1:47:04] their education other understandings
[1:47:07] other the degree of doctors degree and
[1:47:11] so forth that they have come from some
[1:47:12] certain seminary and learn these things
[1:47:14] but look France listen throw her in the
[1:47:18] bag are we as
[1:47:20] to understand we're not asked to
[1:47:24] understand it we're asked to believe it
[1:47:27] believe it by walk by faith if you
[1:47:31] understand it sense that makes faith no
[1:47:35] you can't booth understand it but you
[1:47:39] believe it anyhow if I could understand
[1:47:42] God I wouldn't have to believe God
[1:47:43] I do not understand God no man
[1:47:46] understands God I cannot understand the
[1:47:49] Word of God except this I believe it
[1:47:54] I'm not asked to understand I don't been
[1:47:58] to know seminary all this great
[1:48:00] understanding of man's knowledge on that
[1:48:02] honest though that the Bible says that
[1:48:05] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday for
[1:48:07] every I'll look for him in that same
[1:48:08] category
[1:48:09] I'd already promised one even doing this
[1:48:12] they all look for him to do it and he
[1:48:13] doesn't God he'd promised grace I look
[1:48:17] for it and I received it he promised
[1:48:19] healing I believe me and I accepted it
[1:48:22] and I'll receive it now don't take too
[1:48:26] much of your time but I want to ask one
[1:48:29] thing if you bear with me a minute to
[1:48:31] consider some of those who did not leave
[1:48:34] on their own understanding some
[1:48:37] characters of the Bible just for a few
[1:48:40] that leave hop to their own
[1:48:42] understanding regards to what the
[1:48:44] understanding of their age was let's
[1:48:46] take for instance Noah Noah lived in a
[1:48:50] day of great scientific research the
[1:48:53] days of nor they probably built the
[1:48:56] pyramids but you cannot reproduce again
[1:48:58] now we have got nothing to do it with
[1:49:00] nothing to lift the boulders up there
[1:49:02] they could not today then days they had
[1:49:05] some kind of a chemical they can
[1:49:08] die it makes the clothes look natural
[1:49:10] till the day they had an embalming fluid
[1:49:12] as they can make a mummy we could not
[1:49:14] make one today if we had you we loved
[1:49:17] the arts that we have lost and they
[1:49:19] lived in a smart scientific age Jesus
[1:49:22] referred to that that same carbon age
[1:49:24] would return again before he come back
[1:49:26] for as it was in the days of Noah
[1:49:29] now you will believe that won't you you
[1:49:32] believe it Jesus said
[1:49:33] do you believe we have returns that age
[1:49:36] now that isn't a book of Luke the 17th
[1:49:39] chapter xxix first now in Luke 1730 and
[1:49:43] as it was in the days of lot when the
[1:49:49] angel of the Lord now is read the same
[1:49:51] Bible we are and when you go back and
[1:49:54] find out what kind of baby it was before
[1:49:56] Noah I was REME go back and find out
[1:49:59] what kind of a day it was before the
[1:50:02] world was destroyed in the days of life
[1:50:04] find out what it wasn't you see what
[1:50:06] Jesus is talking about in the days of
[1:50:08] Nohr they were eating drinking marrying
[1:50:10] and giving in marriage do it not until
[1:50:12] Noah entered into the ark the flood come
[1:50:13] take them all away in the days the box
[1:50:15] just before the world was a fire burn
[1:50:19] the Gentile world the sodomites
[1:50:21] there were homosexual perversions
[1:50:24] everything in the world great it was a
[1:50:26] modern Los Angeles not a modern only Los
[1:50:30] Angeles but in the United States yes
[1:50:32] states for the world yeah it sure was
[1:50:35] perversion man lost her natural source
[1:50:39] of life and their natural understandings
[1:50:41] of common sense become for birdie by an
[1:50:44] evil spirit to change the whole course
[1:50:47] of their natural life and they were
[1:50:49] possessed with demons spirits that eats
[1:50:52] a picture of the days of Noah I don't
[1:50:54] know what and in the days of lot I mean
[1:50:57] and days of Noah also eating drinking
[1:50:59] Mary
[1:51:00] given in marriage divorce courts filling
[1:51:02] and everything just like it was but
[1:51:04] remember before the world was destroyed
[1:51:07] Abraham was sent on the face of the
[1:51:09] earth and was given a promise of a son
[1:51:12] and abraham met god in many stages as a
[1:51:16] type of the church's met god
[1:51:18] but just before the destruction and the
[1:51:21] promised son returned or came rather the
[1:51:25] son of the promise came god came down
[1:51:29] and was mammoth human flesh in a mate
[1:51:34] dreaming and they come down to LA come
[1:51:39] first to abraham and they sit down and
[1:51:42] abraham had his name changed from Abram
[1:51:45] to Abraham
[1:51:47] Sara - Sara and these man the speaker
[1:51:51] ello him when he came down to speak to
[1:51:54] him What did he say he said work is your
[1:51:57] wife Sara said she's in the tent behind
[1:52:00] you
[1:52:00] that I and will visit you according to
[1:52:03] the time of life is she left in the tent
[1:52:06] behind him and he said why did sterile
[1:52:08] and see now he would Chuck's the life of
[1:52:13] Sarah right there for laughing at his
[1:52:15] word but he could not do it because Sara
[1:52:19] was a part of Abraham at today jesus
[1:52:23] said in Luke the 17th chapter in the
[1:52:26] 31st as it was in the days of love so
[1:52:29] shall it be at the end on when the Son
[1:52:32] of Man
[1:52:33] now remember Son of Man is a promise he
[1:52:38] killed a son of man Jesus man son of
[1:52:45] David son of God he called his death son
[1:52:48] of man short the beef word understand
[1:52:50] for he was that prophet that the Lord
[1:52:53] God would raise up now notice the Danny
[1:52:56] promise what the settlement would be
[1:52:59] feel himself again just before that time
[1:53:02] before the far it's time that Abraham
[1:53:07] saw before the promised son arrived and
[1:53:11] he turned back to a young man is she to
[1:53:13] a young woman before now notice the
[1:53:17] scripture specifically says that now we
[1:53:22] must look for that and then if we see
[1:53:25] the world in perversion and the things
[1:53:27] that's in it today carry it all the way
[1:53:29] it is then how can we say that's right
[1:53:32] and don't say this others Rock because
[1:53:35] somebody you're leaning on their
[1:53:38] understanding and not the understanding
[1:53:40] of the Prince of life who was that
[1:53:42] person that was there at the gate with
[1:53:44] them it's Sodom now we noticed we lead
[1:53:49] not to our own understanding know what
[1:53:51] did not lead to his understanding it was
[1:53:53] a great scientific age but he did lead
[1:53:55] to his understanding of his day but he
[1:53:58] leaned
[1:53:59] on the promise of God and moved by the
[1:54:03] power of God and prepared an ark in the
[1:54:06] staining of his house when it was
[1:54:07] absolutely contrary to common sense
[1:54:10] there was no water up there never had
[1:54:13] been but he knew if God said there would
[1:54:16] be there would be so he need not to his
[1:54:19] own understanding but by faith he moved
[1:54:22] by the word of God's promise the spirit
[1:54:25] moved him and he did it
[1:54:26] Abraham he did not leave to his
[1:54:29] understanding about human life it
[1:54:32] married his wife at about 17 years old
[1:54:35] here he was 75 years old and she was 65
[1:54:41] years old 10 years younger but Abraham
[1:54:44] did not lead to his understanding when
[1:54:47] God said that he had gave him a son by
[1:54:50] Sarah but he called anything any
[1:54:54] scientific proof that was contrary to
[1:54:57] God's Word any learning outside of God's
[1:55:00] Word as though it wasn't so and he give
[1:55:03] God praise strong giving him praise he
[1:55:06] did not even consider looking at his own
[1:55:08] body or the deadness of Sarah's body or
[1:55:11] or his body he did not consider anything
[1:55:15] but leaned upon the promise of God he
[1:55:19] leaned that up on his own understanding
[1:55:21] he leans out of bone reasons why say
[1:55:24] brother Brahim it's reason that God
[1:55:26] wouldn't Gila stick we've got so many
[1:55:27] fine doctors the Bible said we cast down
[1:55:30] reasoning we don't reason faith don't
[1:55:33] reason faith believe and accept notice
[1:55:37] but he believed instead of unbelieving
[1:55:39] and call the face which were not as
[1:55:41] though they were which is absolutely it
[1:55:44] against any reasoning but he didn't
[1:55:47] reason he just believed him there was no
[1:55:49] reasons could prove that that baby could
[1:55:51] be born that woman was about twenty
[1:55:54] years of past menopause and his body was
[1:55:57] as good as dead and when he was a
[1:55:59] hundred years old 25 years there he
[1:56:01] still was giving God praise against any
[1:56:05] kind of understanding but by faith II
[1:56:08] know that God would keep his word
[1:56:10] he leaned not to his own understanding
[1:56:13] what if Moses what a lead to his own
[1:56:16] understanding when God told him and he
[1:56:18] was done to take Pharaoh and the
[1:56:21] children of Israel out of Pharaohs hand
[1:56:24] what a fiddly to his own understanding
[1:56:27] when he's there by the pillar of fire
[1:56:28] when God said go down and I'll be with
[1:56:30] you
[1:56:31] what if it lead to his understanding
[1:56:32] when he brought him to the Red Sea and
[1:56:34] Daddy was at the water and yet God had
[1:56:38] promised him the promised land
[1:56:39] what if he'd lean to his own
[1:56:40] understanding how am I going to get
[1:56:42] across sir we have a time to build a
[1:56:43] bridge here's the army coming right
[1:56:46] behind you here's the mountains on
[1:56:48] either side here is the water in privacy
[1:56:52] the Red Sea outfit lead to his own
[1:56:55] understanding his own of his hands are
[1:56:57] unveiled at the feet of Pharaoh that
[1:56:58] Pharaoh forgive me I did wrong but he
[1:57:01] leaves not to his own understanding but
[1:57:03] he pray that God taught him to step
[1:57:06] forward and I see older which music is
[1:57:09] Oh reasoning but he leaned not to his
[1:57:13] own understanding what if Joshua when he
[1:57:16] went over there with the other ten
[1:57:18] denomination and walked over there and
[1:57:20] seems that Promised Land of God I'm
[1:57:23] going to come back but damn it said now
[1:57:25] wait a minute is true we look like
[1:57:27] grasshoppers they're Giants how can we
[1:57:29] ever take them we don't even have swords
[1:57:31] just what we picked up how're we ever
[1:57:33] going to take that land was totally
[1:57:35] impossible to outnumbers fifty man to
[1:57:37] one they're trained soldiers and we're
[1:57:39] nothing just a bunch of a sheep herders
[1:57:41] and mud dobbers out of Egypt hell we
[1:57:44] don't even have shields thanks how would
[1:57:46] we ever take it while understanding
[1:57:48] would sure prove that they could not do
[1:57:50] it any military man like he was Ramos's
[1:57:53] could not have lean on their own
[1:57:55] understanding but their understanding
[1:57:56] they lean not on but they know that God
[1:57:59] said I have given you that land go take
[1:58:03] it
[1:58:04] lean not to your own understanding if
[1:58:07] you lean on your own understanding day
[1:58:09] when you're sick maybe sitting in a
[1:58:11] wheelchair dying with cancer heart
[1:58:12] trouble
[1:58:13] the doctor says here go to bat if you
[1:58:15] lean to that understanding you'll die

[1:58:44] was in him how tight they were the hole
[1:58:46] that chariot races on top and even
[1:58:48] houses built on top of it but he didn't
[1:58:51] lead to his own understanding he
[1:58:52] believed what God said was the truth and
[1:58:55] obey his word and the walls fell down
[1:58:58] leaning on trees don't understand what

[2:05:27] Oh every one of the prophets what if
[2:05:30] they were to leave there our
[2:05:31] understanding in their age they don't
[2:05:33] ever walked up to that priest and high
[2:05:34] priest and called him
[2:05:36] planted walls and everything else they'd
[2:05:38] never prophesied contrary to that have
[2:05:40] been like some of them modern prophets
[2:05:42] would agreed ward by Coles and Biddy
[2:05:44] King's palaces
[2:05:45] well John would have tried to lead to
[2:05:47] his own understanding but he walked out
[2:05:49] up this hour what is it John don't you
[2:05:51] preach on marriage and divorce he walked
[2:05:52] right up to the parents cut Hey
[2:05:58] yeah well you know who that is that's
[2:06:00] the proper I don't care who it is
[2:06:02] he didn't lead some night you know you
[2:06:04] haven't got but you're down here on this
[2:06:06] first association won't receive you if
[2:06:08] you go to act like that
[2:06:09] you didn't care about any Association he
[2:06:11] didn't mean to his own understanding but
[2:06:13] to the understanding of God shirk that
[2:06:16] was one man who did lead to his own
[2:06:19] understanding and his name but Judas is
[2:06:21] cast
[2:06:22] oh ye I don't see how I could have done
[2:06:27] it he'd walked face to face with Christ
[2:06:30] just like he did in the beginning he had
[2:06:34] seen the vindication he had looked at
[2:06:36] God in the face like he did in the crew
[2:06:38] the easier he looked at Christ in the
[2:06:41] cool of the evening in the garden and
[2:06:43] Tudor said set in the cool of the
[2:06:46] evening and the Garden of Gethsemane and
[2:06:48] many places and it looked at the same
[2:06:51] Christ and heard him teach prove himself
[2:06:54] by the word vindicated to be the prophet
[2:06:57] that Moses a spoke of a be raised up and
[2:06:59] told him in Scripture who he was know
[2:07:01] all about it
[2:07:02] they'd seen approved by God that he was
[2:07:04] and how to it is because he never had it
[2:07:14] down here in the first place he was the
[2:07:16] German passing he was the son of
[2:07:19] perdition poured out a perdition return
[2:07:22] back to perdition
[2:07:23] now we noticed but he went out and maybe
[2:07:27] he might have had an idea of his
[2:07:28] understanding he might have thought that
[2:07:30] Jesus he had so much respect for him now
[2:07:32] you know I'm I studying for thirty
[2:07:34] pieces of silver and if I do I'll have
[2:07:36] some moody not gonna do something with
[2:07:39] that and he's able to deliver himself
[2:07:41] see he didn't know in the scripture that
[2:07:43] he raised up to take that same place and
[2:07:46] these are there's a people today realize
[2:07:48] what condition if they're in its
[2:07:50] ordained for this lady or see a church
[2:07:52] to be in this condition but in Christ on
[2:07:55] the outside he's not trying to get back
[2:07:58] in no cooperation in the world
[2:08:01] vindicating his word in the day now like
[2:08:04] he did an errand eight and it walked
[2:08:06] right away from it leaning to the
[2:08:08] understanding that's all there is to it
[2:08:10] or maybe let's say this to them and he
[2:08:13] thought maybe if he did sell Christ for
[2:08:16] thirty pieces of silver well and he
[2:08:18] would have a fellowship with some of the
[2:08:21] great denominations of that day the
[2:08:23] Pharisees the Sadducees he's saying I'll
[2:08:26] wait he can take care of yourself I've
[2:08:28] seen great battles huh I know that that
[2:08:31] he can take care of himself so I might
[2:08:32] make some money
[2:08:34] kind of a little retirement as it was
[2:08:36] and then again I might have a great
[2:08:39] standing with these churches today if I
[2:08:43] would betray to it see but he leaned to
[2:08:46] his own understanding instead of the
[2:08:48] understanding is that was the vindicated
[2:08:50] Word of God and he did to Jesus just
[2:08:54] what the scripture said he would do and
[2:08:56] today the church world has turned Christ
[2:09:00] out in this last days just exactly like
[2:09:03] the book of Revelation said they would
[2:09:05] do it it's the spirit of Judas again and
[2:09:09] form a church having a form of godliness
[2:09:11] but denying the word shine now oh ma
[2:09:18] what did it result in death just like it
[2:09:23] did to eat it does to all others who
[2:09:25] tries to pervert the Word of God and
[2:09:29] leave to their own understanding even
[2:09:32] now they sell not for thirty pieces of
[2:09:34] silver but maybe become all some great
[2:09:37] officer some seminary experience
[2:09:40] wouldn't need more thirty pieces of
[2:09:41] silver but they sell it in they'll tell
[2:09:44] their understanding of God out for such
[2:09:47] a thing is that God differ from the
[2:09:49] great learning st. Paul we had all the
[2:09:51] knowledge he could brag about but he
[2:09:55] said I've turned the whole thing on my
[2:09:57] reasons down
[2:09:58] I'm gonna kill her for one day on the
[2:10:01] road that's all and he said I'll never
[2:10:04] come dear with excellency of speech
[2:10:05] because if I did you trust in the wisdom
[2:10:08] of man but I come to you in the power
[2:10:12] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost beam
[2:10:15] upon the Word of God he said of an angel
[2:10:20] from heaven come preached any other
[2:10:22] thing let he be accursed relations 1:8
[2:10:25] that's right yeah no sir he never the
[2:10:28] little woman at the well she was immoral
[2:10:30] but she know that the churches that
[2:10:32] excommunicated her and but she never
[2:10:35] leaned up on her own understanding once
[2:10:38] she met this one at the well who told
[2:10:40] her all the sins that she had done she
[2:10:42] run into the city now it wasn't right
[2:10:44] for a woman to do that you're going say
[2:10:46] you think or she's a prostitute but when
[2:10:48] she had met Jesus
[2:10:49] she never leaned to the understanding of
[2:10:51] the people that day she come said she
[2:10:52] come see a man who told me the things
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:57] she ever leaned upon her understanding
[2:11:00] no the Virgin Mary when the angel
[2:11:04] Gabriel met her and told her that she is
[2:11:08] going to have a baby without knowing a
[2:11:10] man never been she never leaned up on
[2:11:17] her own understanding that a woman could
[2:11:18] not have a baby but out having a husband
[2:11:22] she didn't lean up on that but she said
[2:11:25] be all the hands feet of the Lord be it
[2:11:28] unto me according to your word she
[2:11:31] didn't say a hammock or good family good
[2:11:33] how's this all gonna take place the
[2:11:35] angel said the Holy Ghost shall
[2:11:37] overshadow thee and that holy thing will
[2:11:39] be born to be she'll be called the Son
[2:11:41] of God she said Behold the handmaid of
[2:11:43] the Lord she didn't take her reasonings
[2:11:45] that it couldn't be done she just said
[2:11:47] Behold the handmaid of the Lord that's
[2:11:49] right
[2:11:49] notice the the woman that had the bread
[2:11:53] issue the doctor told her said there's
[2:11:55] the hope she spent over living with the
[2:11:58] physicians and none of them could help
[2:12:00] her and she didn't lean upon death when
[2:12:04] Jesus she walked through the crowd as
[2:12:06] she said I'd leave if I can touch that
[2:12:07] man's garments I'll be made well she
[2:12:11] now wait the doctor said you can't get
[2:12:13] well she'd had this blood issue for
[2:12:15] years and years
[2:12:16] she got weaker all-time and worse the
[2:12:18] doctors to give her up that's all the
[2:12:20] understanding they had but she said by
[2:12:22] faith there's no scripture tell her to
[2:12:25] do that but she said if I could touch
[2:12:27] the border off his gun he'll be made
[2:12:31] well and she slipped around and touched
[2:12:33] him she walked back sit down
[2:12:36] Jesus turn around said who touched me
[2:12:39] look down till he found her he told her
[2:12:41] of her blood issue and she felt at that
[2:12:44] moment in her own body she could prove
[2:12:46] it then but she felt in her own body
[2:12:48] that her blood issue stopped
[2:12:50] she never reasoned if the doctor had
[2:12:53] turned her down how could anything else
[2:12:55] help her she never went to reason but
[2:12:57] she went to faith
[2:12:58] now the Bible said that he's the high
[2:13:02] priest today that can be touched by the
[2:13:04] feeling of our infirmities yes see my
[2:13:06] right don't go Theresa say all that he
[2:13:09] said today he's that he is right now a
[2:13:11] high priest that can be touched by the
[2:13:14] feeling of our infirmities the same
[2:13:16] yesterday today and forever what do you
[2:13:19] think when I was out there as a Baptist
[2:13:21] preacher and that angel the Lord met the
[2:13:24] other and commissioned me to go do this
[2:13:26] that I'm doing wha my pastor said you've
[2:13:30] gone crazy
[2:13:31] well you had a nightmare here I said you
[2:13:33] better take my fellowship card right now

[2:13:39] Grammar School Education preached around
[2:13:42] the world how can you ever pray for
[2:13:46] kings and potentates and you can't even
[2:13:49] use your grammar ID I wasn't trusting in
[2:13:53] my grammar I was entrusted in ability I
[2:13:55] had I was commissioned if I had to
[2:14:02] listen to reasons that probably in
[2:14:04] thousands of people died years ago but I
[2:14:06] carried a message exactly like he said
[2:14:09] around and around the world and I'm
[2:14:11] going against by the grace of God
[2:14:13] reasons but our Commission hallelujah

[2:14:28] understanding and after the sign went
[2:14:31] forth and the boys farther the church's
[2:14:34] begin to turn me down and close your
[2:14:35] doors upon doctrine that's any of them
[2:14:37] garrison to stand before me to get right
[2:14:39] or wrong ah challenge any of them not to

[2:17:27] amen praise the Lord thank God for the
[2:17:32] word and the encouragement I trust we'll
[2:17:37] take the counsel not to lean upon our
[2:17:40] understanding amen
[2:17:43] by the grace of God to take what God
[2:17:46] reveals believe it it's not for us to
[2:17:49] figure it out it's for us to believe it
[2:17:52] again Jesus wasn't asking Mary if she
[2:17:56] understood it he said I am he said
[2:17:58] Lazarus were right will rise again in
[2:18:01] the resurrection she oh yes she said I
[2:18:03] believe you'll rise in the future
[2:18:04] resurrection he said I am the
[2:18:07] resurrection and he said believers thou
[2:18:10] this he that liveth and believeth in me
[2:18:13] shall never die
[2:18:14] and though he were dead yet shall he
[2:18:16] live amen so believe us that's what
[2:18:19] God's asking us to do is believe his
[2:18:21] word whether was in the Garden of Eden
[2:18:24] believe what God said amen
[2:18:27] don't question it don't try to figure it
[2:18:29] out amen but the devil got there and he
[2:18:31] tried to get Eve to reason and me he
[2:18:34] said yeah she said he said yeah if God
[2:18:37] said yes she said but he said I he said
[2:18:40] yeah it got said but brother you don't
[2:18:43] put no buts in it a man you leave it the
[2:18:46] way God said it
[2:18:47] so she allowed the devil to put a butt
[2:18:49] in it and that's what the devil is still
[2:18:51] doing and he's been doing it right on
[2:18:52] down through the ages every time God
[2:18:54] came and gave His Word through a prophet
[2:18:56] or through whoever it was brother the
[2:18:58] word the revealed Word of God the enemy
[2:19:01] has come and said yeah God has said but
[2:19:03] a man remember the devil is there to
[2:19:06] preach the word the devil is there to
[2:19:07] preach the message but you know add a
[2:19:11] word here or you know take away a word
[2:19:13] there brother stay with the word don't
[2:19:16] take the devil's buts a man again that's
[2:19:20] what the goats do the goats but this and
[2:19:24] but that no no the Sheep just believes
[2:19:27] the word the sheep are gonna let God
[2:19:30] feed them a man it's like a knowing that
[2:19:34] she recognized their Shepherd I remember
[2:19:37] when we were in Israel with our brother
[2:19:40] George Smith
[2:19:41] and that's it back in 2008 and we were
[2:19:44] in the hotel in Jerusalem and I remember
[2:19:47] at one point there we look we're looking
[2:19:49] at a window and way over somewhere on a
[2:19:53] field there were some shepherds and
[2:19:55] sheep yeah amazing that God would God
[2:20:00] would do this to quicken to us to
[2:20:03] Revelation that we had already heard
[2:20:05] that we had all they believed concerning
[2:20:08] the sheep and the shepherds and the the
[2:20:12] Shepherd's began to move move around and
[2:20:14] this one moved there that will move
[2:20:16] there then are we we didn't know what
[2:20:18] was going on well then all of a sudden
[2:20:20] the Sheep began to move and it looked
[2:20:23] like they didn't like it was confusing
[2:20:25] because the Sheep was going this way
[2:20:27] this way this way
[2:20:28] undefined after a while we noticed that
[2:20:31] there was it was all oh these sheep were
[2:20:35] going that way these sheep are going
[2:20:36] that way these sheep are going that way
[2:20:38] why because they heard the voice of
[2:20:40] their Shepherd they recognized the voice
[2:20:42] of their shepherd and this one called
[2:20:45] him and not always she went to him just
[2:20:48] his own that the sheep that recognized
[2:20:51] his voice just a sheep that knew his
[2:20:54] name
[2:20:54] and so on so they went there and others
[2:20:57] went over here and others went to the
[2:20:59] other Shepherd and so on so brother God
[2:21:02] a man his sheep recognized his voice and
[2:21:07] they follow God's voice run all the way
[2:21:10] down through the all the way down
[2:21:11] through the Church ages the Sheep have
[2:21:13] followed God's voice where there's in
[2:21:16] Luther's age in Wesley's age the
[2:21:17] Pentecostal age where there was the old
[2:21:20] fashioned Salvation Army but it was it
[2:21:22] was God calling it was God speaking and
[2:21:25] the Sheep recognized it and went and
[2:21:27] went went in the direction of that voice
[2:21:29] by the grace of God and in this hour and
[2:21:32] in this age that's why we are where we
[2:21:35] are because why as the Sheep of God we
[2:21:37] recognized the voice of God speaking the
[2:21:40] Word of God a man sure
[2:21:43] we got one Luther ed+ what Wesley had we
[2:21:46] got what Wesley had plus what the
[2:21:49] Pentecostal said we got where the
[2:21:51] Pentecostals ANT+ what God has revealed
[2:21:55] for the bride a man he gave them the
[2:21:58] faith for that and he gave us to faith
[2:22:01] for it but now he's given us the faith
[2:22:03] for justification sanctification the
[2:22:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[2:22:07] the Spirit and now he's given us the
[2:22:09] faith for the resurrection and the
[2:22:10] rapture hey man
[2:22:12] because now that's what God is looking
[2:22:14] for that's what God requires of us now
[2:22:16] hey man
[2:22:18] God's not just looking for all you
[2:22:20] believe justification sure that's
[2:22:23] absolute a man Lord we believe it we
[2:22:26] know that you justified us we know you
[2:22:27] sanctified us we know Lord did you give
[2:22:30] baptizes with the Holy Ghost in the new
[2:22:33] birth and and the gifts of the Spirit
[2:22:34] are there dude because I know I know a
[2:22:37] certain brother one time lift the
[2:22:39] impression that God did away with the
[2:22:41] gifts of the Holy Spirit No if he did
[2:22:45] away with the gifts of the Spirit he did
[2:22:46] away with the spirit the Holy Spirit
[2:22:49] because with the Holy Ghost comes the
[2:22:51] gifts of the Spirit amen there they're
[2:22:54] saying with justification were justified
[2:22:56] sanctification revelation were justified
[2:22:59] in Christ and so on oh my brother's
[2:23:01] sister the prophet of God they came and
[2:23:04] he didn't do away with it he said always
[2:23:05] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[2:23:07] gifts are right there is it but they're
[2:23:09] just on the Shelf he said if we need
[2:23:10] them if we need them God will use them
[2:23:13] we will leave that with the Lord but
[2:23:16] there's there's there are those that
[2:23:17] believe that God did away with it all
[2:23:18] brother if God did away with the gifts
[2:23:20] he did away with justification if he did
[2:23:23] away with justification of
[2:23:24] sanctification and so on no brother
[2:23:27] God added to it amen we believe that
[2:23:30] plus plus plus plus a man though he go
[2:23:34] on and we're believing for the
[2:23:35] resurrection and the rapture a man old
[2:23:38] brother the prophecy this the prophets
[2:23:40] did that the prophets did all these
[2:23:42] signs and wonders but brother when they
[2:23:44] died they we know where they went into
[2:23:46] another dimension but their bodies were
[2:23:48] put down and threw into a grave
[2:23:50] somewhere and they never come back never
[2:23:53] come back but Jesus laid down his life
[2:23:55] and picked it up again amen he was the
[2:23:59] god prophet he man why because he came
[2:24:03] to fulfill the scriptures a man
[2:24:05] concerning the Messiah to God be the
[2:24:08] glory
[2:24:08] we'll see Elijah and all the other
[2:24:12] prophets and Moses they weren't ordained
[2:24:14] to do that
[2:24:15] they weren't the God prophets no no no
[2:24:18] Jesus was the God prophet he was God in
[2:24:21] flesh a man the and it was the fullness
[2:24:24] of the Godhead bodily the prophets were
[2:24:27] just God by measure in that prophet God
[2:24:30] that measure in that prophet but but in
[2:24:33] Jesus it was God himself - in the
[2:24:36] beginning was the word the Word was with
[2:24:38] God the Word was God and the Word was
[2:24:40] made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:24:44] amen praise the name of the Lord
[2:24:47] where's the prophets were just the word
[2:24:49] by measure but Christ was the fullness
[2:24:51] of the Godhead bodily
[2:24:53] he was the word for word 100% word in
[2:24:56] flesh he meant he said I am the
[2:24:59] resurrection and the life
[2:25:01] a man praise the name of the Lord so
[2:25:05] brother believers how this that Christ
[2:25:07] is in his bride now what for to bring
[2:25:11] forth the resurrection and the rapture
[2:25:12] the dead in Christ are waiting on us
[2:25:16] amen
[2:25:18] brother sister we are waiting on Jesus
[2:25:21] the dead the Old Testament Saints are
[2:25:24] waiting out Jesus he came and when he
[2:25:27] arose they rose they went into the city
[2:25:30] and appeared on to many a man to God be
[2:25:34] the glory brother what an hour were
[2:25:35] living what a tremendous hour that we're
[2:25:38] living god help us to believe please
[2:25:41] don't doubt it just saying I'm waiting
[2:25:44] on God God's gonna do this God's gonna
[2:25:46] do that well brother sister if Luther
[2:25:49] kept waiting and he and he refused to
[2:25:51] revelation brother he would never come
[2:25:53] to justification but he got as I said he
[2:25:57] did it he did everything he did this he
[2:25:59] did this he did that he went he did all
[2:26:02] kinds of things that he was taught that
[2:26:04] you had to do as the Catholic back then
[2:26:06] till finally but he still didn't feel
[2:26:09] justified he said Lord I'm looking for
[2:26:12] justification and I do this I do good
[2:26:16] works and I still not justified and to
[2:26:19] finally went in
[2:26:20] and he opened a Bible and he read it
[2:26:24] that the just shall live by faith
[2:26:26] and that Jesus was was one that
[2:26:29] justified us oh and as I said he took
[2:26:35] the no doubt the thing there and the
[2:26:38] feather and maybe ink and he wrote wrote
[2:26:41] in the on the Bible alone justified by
[2:26:46] faith alone amen and he in it from that
[2:26:51] moment on he was a different man
[2:26:54] he lived different act different amen he
[2:26:57] preached different Amen why because he
[2:27:00] felt oh now I know I'm justified
[2:27:02] Jesus has justified me praise the Lord
[2:27:06] Jesus sanctified us Jesus has baptizes
[2:27:10] with the Holy Ghost giving us access to
[2:27:12] his gifts amen and now Jesus is giving
[2:27:17] us the revelation and the faith of the
[2:27:19] resurrection and the rapture god help us
[2:27:26] amen brother god help us
[2:27:33] jesus said search the Scriptures for in
[2:27:36] them you think you have eternal life and
[2:27:38] they are they which testify of me
[2:27:40] brother you wanna know what the
[2:27:43] resurrection of rapture it's in the word
[2:27:46] amen and what God has done in this hour
[2:27:49] in this age is to give the bride
[2:27:52] resurrection of rapturing faith the
[2:27:55] finish of the mystery of God the opening
[2:27:57] of the seven seals the prophet of God
[2:28:04] may mentioned about trying to educate
[2:28:08] the world
[2:28:13] and I remote a family doctor that I had
[2:28:19] many years ago I would say that he would
[2:28:26] be gone on now but I was in to see that
[2:28:32] doctor and he was checking some things
[2:28:36] out in me as a doctor your family doctor
[2:28:40] might do and I did I do remember that I
[2:28:43] had a trach here in my pocket and he was
[2:28:47] talking to me and about different things
[2:28:51] that eventually became spiritual and he
[2:28:56] said Jarrell you mean to tell me that he
[2:29:03] said that person you're talking about
[2:29:07] that can't read the Bible that he would
[2:29:11] know more about the Bible he would nor
[2:29:14] more about God and God's plan then he
[2:29:17] said somebody that's been several years
[2:29:19] in a Bible College studying the Bible he
[2:29:25] said you mean to tell me that other
[2:29:26] first person would know more about the
[2:29:28] Bible than that person I said yes I said
[2:29:31] because the one that can't read but he
[2:29:33] can hear it when it's read to him I said
[2:29:36] he got the Holy Ghost in his heart and
[2:29:38] the Holy Ghost is quickening the word
[2:29:40] that making it alive to him real to him
[2:29:43] whereas the old fellow's going by
[2:29:45] education I said and he's gone by the
[2:29:47] letter of the word but he's not getting
[2:29:49] the risperdal of it in his heart oh oh I
[2:29:56] said I oh that's what you mean yes I
[2:29:59] said that's what I mean I was referring
[2:30:01] to a great uncle of mine from years ago
[2:30:05] brother lane and he believed the message
[2:30:12] he believed what God has done he
[2:30:15] believed what God was going to do and so
[2:30:17] on and but he couldn't read no no he had
[2:30:23] a Bible and so on but he couldn't read
[2:30:24] it you never had that education
[2:30:27] now his wife could read it and he
[2:30:30] believed it a man and he had the
[2:30:32] understanding that educated people never
[2:30:35] had when it come to the Bible why
[2:30:38] because he had the Holy Ghost Christ in
[2:30:41] him was revealing it read the word oh
[2:30:44] yes he believed it and he understood it
[2:30:47] a man and so when we finished our
[2:30:51] conversation the doctor reached in and
[2:30:55] took them took the track he looked at it
[2:30:57] and he laid it on his desk and he kept
[2:31:01] it a man so I pray God rest his soul
[2:31:07] amen
[2:31:09] because he was believing what I was
[2:31:11] telling her understanding what I was
[2:31:13] telling him by the grace of God amen do
[2:31:18] a couple of things I had highlighted
[2:31:20] here but I want I won't go any further
[2:31:24] into it amen amen
[2:31:29] because of the time so the Lord bless
[2:31:31] you and God help us don't lean to your
[2:31:33] own understanding
[2:31:35] brother depend on the Holy Spirit in you
[2:31:37] to reveal what God has done and what God
[2:31:40] is doing to reveal to you what God has
[2:31:43] said right here in the word believe it
[2:31:46] God never asked us to figure it out he
[2:31:48] asked us to believe it he never asked
[2:31:51] Martha do you understand it
[2:31:53] he asked her do you believe it because
[2:31:55] he said I am the resurrection and the
[2:31:57] life
[2:31:58] amen so do we believe it if if she said
[2:32:04] ah yes Lord I believe if she believed
[2:32:06] that then do we believe it now amen
[2:32:08] because she lived she lived to meet
[2:32:13] Jesus who came back from the dead a man
[2:32:18] and brother sister
[2:32:19] we have lived to see the Ministry of
[2:32:22] that same Jesus revealed in and through
[2:32:26] a prophetic ministry hey man I'll tell
[2:32:29] you this it wasn't william branham no no
[2:32:32] brother BAM said I can't do this when he
[2:32:37] had when he when he got up with those
[2:32:38] doors that sign in his hand
[2:32:40] and he was discerning the thoughts and
[2:32:42] intents of a person's art past present
[2:32:44] and future he said that's not me
[2:32:47] he's I can't do that he said I got to
[2:32:50] get at him out of the way now so Jesus
[2:32:52] can come and do it
[2:32:53] amen and that's who was doing it anyway
[2:32:57] it was it wasn't I wasn't it like like
[2:33:00] like many thought that William Branham
[2:33:02] at a gift of discernment it wasn't a
[2:33:05] gift a gift of discernment can discern
[2:33:08] your thoughts present tense my brother
[2:33:11] the gift the anointing that was on the
[2:33:14] prophet of God for this hour went back
[2:33:16] into a person's past not just a present
[2:33:20] tense but and then went into a person's
[2:33:22] future oh yeah
[2:33:24] and he someone asked him one time about
[2:33:28] a certain thing that he did he said
[2:33:30] brother man what did you do this when
[2:33:32] when you had this prayer line and you
[2:33:35] would say you tell us to tell a certain
[2:33:36] person oh this is your name you're from
[2:33:40] here this is what happened to you and
[2:33:42] he's a brother BAM sometimes you would
[2:33:45] say oh they'll say it the Lord knew
[2:33:47] you're healed
[2:33:48] call your way and rejoice and praise the
[2:33:51] Lord and others father bound you would
[2:33:53] say you would tell him all these things
[2:33:55] and then you would instead of saying
[2:33:57] they were healed you will say go your
[2:33:59] way and just trust the Lord yes he said
[2:34:03] there's a wife why didn't you tell him
[2:34:05] whether or not they were healed be cases
[2:34:07] I saw them in a coffin and he said they
[2:34:12] were going to die so he said I never
[2:34:14] told him that I just tell him to go on
[2:34:16] trust the Lord amen so he knew the past
[2:34:20] the present and the future and that
[2:34:23] wasn't really Branham that was Jesus
[2:34:26] Christ came in the flesh of his bright
[2:34:30] and they and the prophet of God said he
[2:34:32] said the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[2:34:34] is now in the bright for the
[2:34:38] resurrection and for the rapture amen
[2:34:42] grace of God to us is my prayer
[2:34:47] brother that's the scripture says bear
[2:34:50] with me we will finish with this

[2:35:43] of the Archangel and with the Trump of

[2:35:55] and remain shall be caught up together
[2:35:58] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
