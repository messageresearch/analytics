[43:20] grant us Grace now we ask in Jesus
[43:22] Christ's name amen and amen God bless
[43:26] you this morning turn if you would to 1
[43:28] Corinthians chapter
[43:29] 15 amen it's good to be in the house of
[43:31] the
[43:33] Lord amen good to have brother Bob and
[43:36] sister Brenda back with us from their

[43:50] it's not always we can make it amen God
[43:53] is good amen amen God is good 1
[43:57] Corinthians 15 verse 57 Paul says but
[44:01] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[44:04] victory through our Lord Jesus
[44:07] Christ if you if you have a skull field
[44:09] Bible it as it switches to verse 58 it
[44:12] says it's the ultimate Victory here it
[44:15] says a motive to service he says
[44:18] therefore my beloved Brethren be ye
[44:20] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[44:23] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[44:26] know that your labor is not in vain in
[44:28] the Lord amen God bless you you can have
[44:30] your seats this morning and we're
[44:32] continuing our series on manifesting
[44:34] time and I want to take a third service
[44:35] on this title of stepping up and we
[44:38] spoke last service and we really focused
[44:39] on the sisters how that God had placed
[44:42] them in their roles and he'd
[44:43] specifically built them and fashioned
[44:45] them and put them together in a way that
[44:46] was best for their family for their
[44:48] husband and for their children and we
[44:50] saw great power in that we saw that with
[44:51] Hannah we saw it with Tabitha and these
[44:54] different ones and you know even as you
[44:55] could hear my prayer this morning I
[44:57] don't ever want us to miss the
[44:58] Simplicity of that humble Victorious
[45:01] Christian walk amen it is so often is we
[45:04] talked about this last service how we've
[45:06] got to let God be God and let you be you
[45:08] and trust that as he's made you he's
[45:10] working in you with the way that we are
[45:12] amen and we're not trying to raise
[45:14] ourselves up to be something amen but
[45:16] the great trial is the great test is not
[45:18] to let sat us beat us down from what we
[45:20] are either but to stay right in the
[45:22] middle of the road and and to stay right
[45:24] where God places Us in that thing that
[45:25] he's called us to to be faithful to that
[45:28] amen it's not to to to be here to to
[45:30] make money or to make a name for
[45:32] ourselves but it's to be in his timing
[45:33] in his season in his will and in his
[45:35] purpose and if we can wake up every
[45:37] morning and do that then we're going to
[45:39] find ourselves living a life that's
[45:40] overcoming amen amen that perfect walk
[45:43] of the Believers to walk as he's in the
[45:45] in the light amen where he shows us what
[45:47] he wants us to do that's where we want
[45:48] to be and I I just want to open with
[45:50] this little short quote here that
[45:52] brother brandham says he says men who
[45:54] walk with God don't care where they're
[45:56] going as long as they're following the
[45:59] holy spirit amen I was sharing with a a
[46:02] couple Brothers this week and I got a
[46:03] notice in my LinkedIn page of my old
[46:06] boss back in BC and and when I was in BC
[46:09] many of you know I was in a job and and
[46:11] uh I was very persecuted there and it
[46:14] came to the point where I couldn't stay
[46:15] anymore and so I left and I just wanted
[46:17] to take time off to kind of recover and
[46:19] see what the Lord would have me to do
[46:20] and I never got that brother Jonah Emy
[46:23] called me up he said I want to go elk
[46:25] hunting come preach for me while I'm
[46:26] gone and so I went to do that and I
[46:28] wanted to go hunting just get outside
[46:30] get away from it all and in the end I
[46:32] didn't get that I got a day and a half
[46:33] of hunting and then I got this job offer
[46:35] to go work for a company and and and the
[46:38] president had had picked me to take his
[46:40] place he knew that things were going to
[46:42] be changing in the in the near future
[46:44] and so this week he got his big
[46:45] promotion and he was made the CEO of now
[46:48] this multinational corporation and so
[46:50] this would have been the week if God had
[46:52] continued to bless me that I would have
[46:53] been the president of aund million
[46:55] Corporation in Canada
[46:59] the ep the the epitome of what a person
[47:01] would generally want in their career and
[47:04] you know what I'd have been
[47:06] miserable you know I was talking with
[47:08] brother Joe about it and he was talking
[47:10] about a sacrifice I said I don't look at
[47:11] it as a sacrifice not at all what's the
[47:14] sacrifice the sacrifice is just to stay
[47:16] in God's will amen and so you can have
[47:19] it all and you'll never be content and
[47:22] you can have less and be more content
[47:24] with that less than you ever would have
[47:25] had the other way and so I look at that
[47:28] and I just say praise the Lord for where
[47:30] he's brought me that I am content with
[47:32] what I have that I am content with where
[47:34] I am that I'm content in the ministry of
[47:36] his service above all else and that's
[47:39] where contentment is found is finding
[47:41] yourself in God's will anden I learned
[47:43] it back a long long time ago that when
[47:46] it comes to careers when it comes to
[47:47] business when it comes to making money
[47:49] so often it can be at the whims of men
[47:52] and women and these different things and
[47:54] and you can come in and out of favor and
[47:55] you can have lots of money you can have
[47:57] little money you can have a big house
[47:58] you can have a you can have to rent you
[48:00] can have great cars you can have poor
[48:02] cars it can be all sorts of things but
[48:04] there is nothing greater than to find
[48:06] that you're following the Holy Spirit
[48:08] and when you find that place everything
[48:09] else just Fades away and there's great
[48:12] contentment Paul talked about he says
[48:13] I've learned he says I've had a lot and
[48:15] I've had a little but wherever I am he
[48:17] says I've learned to be content with
[48:18] where where what I have and I just want
[48:21] to thank God for that this morning that
[48:23] when I saw that announcement there
[48:24] wasn't a single lick of regret not at
[48:28] all not at all not not one little bit I
[48:32] said I and I talked to a CO a colleague
[48:34] about it he's over in BC and he manages
[48:36] his client and he sent me the news I
[48:38] said yes I saw that I said but I'm glad
[48:39] I am where I am doing what I'm doing
[48:41] amen and I believe that's the grace of
[48:43] God that we can find where we are and
[48:45] say I'm happy to be where I am why
[48:47] because I know I'm following the Holy
[48:50] Spirit Church if we're discontent where
[48:52] we're at there's a problem amen because
[48:54] either we're led by the Holy Spirit or
[48:56] we're not and if he leads us then we
[48:59] need to be be able to find that
[49:00] contentment we in whatever we're doing
[49:02] and and whatever position he's placed us
[49:05] we've got to find this now not just in a
[49:07] in a general sense but a day byday sense
[49:09] to say the holy spirit is leading me
[49:11] today amen that what I'm doing today
[49:14] where I am and and what I'm going
[49:15] through is all of his purpose and plan I
[49:19] I've talked about this before and I know
[49:20] I keep repeating it but I I'm trying to
[49:22] get us to a point where we'll say today
[49:25] I'm LED
[49:27] not just big picture but to stay say in
[49:29] everything that I go through today I
[49:31] want to be led by the Holy Spirit to
[49:33] recognize that whatever we Face whatever
[49:35] situation it is whatever person it is
[49:37] whatever conversation it has we have
[49:40] it's not just life it is God leading us
[49:43] and guiding us into situations and into
[49:45] people's lives and these different
[49:46] things and I've talked about it how how
[49:49] in the mornings when brother Dwayne fair
[49:50] was here I took a real correction from
[49:52] that Pulpit where he said don't pick up
[49:54] your phone first thing in the morning
[49:55] don't go look at the news don't go look
[49:57] at sports give that time to God first
[49:59] thing and that's what I've done since
[50:01] then faithfully and what do I do I pray
[50:03] over my life I pray over my day I pray
[50:05] over my wife my family whatever it may
[50:08] be and I said Lord let us witness of you
[50:10] today and whatever it is let us be a
[50:12] testimony for you today and you know
[50:15] what happens church is when you pray for
[50:17] something you get an expectation for
[50:19] that something because it sets you up
[50:21] now to step into whatever God would
[50:23] bring your way and now when things come
[50:25] your way whether they're good or whether
[50:27] they're bad you can say God's in it and
[50:29] you can approach it with a different
[50:30] thing it's put me in expectation to be
[50:33] used and it's exciting to know that God
[50:35] is going to use you in a day that you're
[50:37] not just walking through that you're not
[50:38] just going to go to work from 8:30 to
[50:40] 4:30 and then come home and and rest for
[50:43] a while and go to sleep and live for the
[50:45] weekend that's Satan's kingdom that's
[50:46] Satan's mindset is to put in the work
[50:48] and then try and relax so that you can
[50:50] get to the weekend and just have a good
[50:51] time off no everything that we do is
[50:54] ordered of the Lord amen we're pre
[50:56] preaching on stepping up this morning
[50:58] and I want to preach this morning from a
[51:00] from an attitude of of
[51:02] faithfulness amen we've talked about
[51:04] coming into a higher understanding and a
[51:06] an awareness of how our lives are
[51:07] ordered by the Lord amen but as we
[51:09] talked about our sisters last we last
[51:12] last service it's it's sometimes hard to
[51:14] wake up and think that cleaning the
[51:15] house and making the meals and watching
[51:17] over your children is your adopted
[51:20] position and why is that it's because we
[51:23] forget that we're about the Lord's
[51:24] business amen that he is trying to do
[51:27] something through Us in those little
[51:29] things day by day and if we can see that
[51:31] then we can see the influence we have
[51:33] and we can see the power and the
[51:35] authority that God has put behind us in
[51:37] that role to produce his word and to
[51:39] produce his will so as I said I want to
[51:42] talk about stepping up in terms of
[51:44] faithfulness this morning in the
[51:45] day-to-day Simplicity of our lives and
[51:47] recognizing how God moves and how he
[51:49] sets things up anden as I said these
[51:52] these things that happen are not
[51:53] happenstance it's not just just uh Co
[51:56] incidence but amen the the the order the
[51:59] the the things that happen in our life
[52:01] were ordered of the Lord and Paul David
[52:03] would say this in the Psalms he says the
[52:05] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[52:08] Lord and He Delights in his way and I've
[52:10] got the Amplified there and you can see
[52:12] that that that phrase order by the Lord
[52:14] means that they are established they're
[52:17] directed they're prepared and they're
[52:19] settled and when we put it all together
[52:21] we see that everything that we face as
[52:23] long as we are in the will of God is
[52:25] ordained of God and in other words it is
[52:27] there for a purpose it is there for a
[52:30] purpose amen and it says there that God
[52:33] Delights in our path God Delights in
[52:37] what comes our way so when we're on the
[52:39] Mountaintop experience it pleases God
[52:42] but when we're in the valley experience
[52:44] it pleases God equally as well so
[52:46] whether it's a great time whether it's a
[52:48] struggle time whether it's a victory
[52:49] time whether it's a battle
[52:51] time through it all God is pleased why
[52:54] because he can see the beginning to to
[52:56] the end he knows what it's bringing us
[52:58] to and so he's sitting there and he's
[53:00] saying she's going through it but watch
[53:03] what comes afterwards she's going to
[53:04] stick with it she's going to make it
[53:06] through and look at the victory that's
[53:08] coming out amen so often we want to be
[53:10] on that Mountaintop we want to be in
[53:12] that place where we're praising and
[53:14] we're worshiping but you've got to
[53:16] understand that praise and worship is a
[53:18] life lived in his word it is not the
[53:21] words we say after the victory it's the
[53:23] life we live in the battle that matters
[53:25] the most amen
[53:28] whether we're working whether we're
[53:29] resting whether we're playing whatever
[53:31] it might be if we're in the will of God
[53:34] then that's what pleases him is because
[53:36] he sees what it's bringing us to life's
[53:39] not a continuous
[53:40] Victory anybody that's a Believer knows
[53:43] that life is more of a continuous battle
[53:45] with brief moments of Victory before you
[53:47] go on to the next battle amen this is
[53:49] not a life of ease it is not a a life of
[53:52] pleasure but it is a life to stay with
[53:54] the word of God no matter what the
[53:56] situation
[53:57] is
[53:58] amen what is the great revelation we
[54:01] need that if we're in a battle and we're
[54:03] in his will then he has brought us to
[54:05] the battle to defeat whatever lies in
[54:07] front of us and we're built to take that
[54:09] battle we're built to take the victory
[54:11] in that battle brother Bram says this he
[54:13] says and I find out here in the seventh
[54:15] Church age we find out we've missed
[54:17] something when a prophet says we've
[54:19] missed something that means we've got to
[54:21] make sure that we're not missing it
[54:22] today he says there's something wrong we
[54:25] find we got into a desert and all the
[54:28] fruits is dried up we don't have no more
[54:30] love peace Joy long-suffering Fellowship
[54:34] that we ought to have like they had at
[54:35] the beginning he says the fruits have
[54:37] all dried up in the
[54:39] deserts he says seven days he's talking
[54:41] about the church ages really means seven
[54:43] Church ages going without finding the
[54:45] real living God we've run off on little
[54:48] isms God gave Luther justification he
[54:50] run off with it he gave Wesley
[54:52] sanctification he run off with it
[54:54] Pentecostals speak in tongue people
[54:56] speak tongues and they all run off with
[54:57] it he says God wants to call us together
[55:00] in a Unity of power to bring back the
[55:03] fullness of the Holy Ghost into the
[55:05] church again with all the spiritual
[55:07] gifts in operation in every local body
[55:10] he's saying it's supposed to be there he
[55:12] says yes seven days without God LED them
[55:15] into a desert it's the same thing now
[55:17] his fruits dried up I imagine as they
[55:20] moved out over the hill from the green
[55:21] valleys and things they begin to see the
[55:24] place is kind of drying off he says you
[55:27] know everybody wants a Hilltop
[55:29] experience but they never want to take
[55:32] the valley well that's human nature we
[55:35] want the good times we want the good
[55:36] feelings we want the good emotions we
[55:38] want the the the Plenty rather than the
[55:42] lack that's what we
[55:44] want but if you see somebody that has
[55:47] had everything all the time you know
[55:49] what they are they of all men most
[55:52] miserable he says every night if you're
[55:55] not shouting dancing jumping up and down
[55:58] speaking in tongues running around over
[56:00] the floor something another you didn't
[56:02] have any kind of a
[56:04] meeting we can get into this mindset
[56:06] that special meetings mean that we're
[56:08] shouting and jumping
[56:10] around how
[56:13] carnal I'll say it again how
[56:16] carnal he says well you know it's all
[56:18] right to be up on the Mountaintop that's
[56:20] good but let me tell you your fruits
[56:22] will freeze up there at night and when
[56:24] the cold spell comes you'll lose all
[56:26] your fruit that's what happened now
[56:29] what's he saying he's saying you need
[56:31] real valleys before you can have real
[56:33] mountaintops what he's saying is what
[56:35] you call Mountaintop experiences
[56:37] probably aren't Mountaintop experiences
[56:40] they're just what the rain
[56:42] falling that's not a Mountaintop
[56:46] experience a Mountaintop experience is
[56:50] Victory it's not emotion it's not
[56:52] sensation it's not a good time we love
[56:54] the good times I'm not saying let's not
[56:56] have good times but he's saying that is
[56:58] not where the victory is that's not the
[57:00] Mountaintop
[57:02] experience and he says what we find out
[57:05] that it's not because when the cold time
[57:07] comes we've got nothing left if we
[57:09] really had a victory we'd have something
[57:11] left after those Mountaintop experiences
[57:13] he says we put too much on mountaintop
[57:16] experiences of dancing and shaking and
[57:18] jumping around instead of all night
[57:21] prayer meetings down in the valley of
[57:23] decision what he's saying is you need to
[57:25] have some Val experiences at home before
[57:27] you get some Mountaintop experiences at
[57:29] church amen this is an all day thing
[57:32] this is an all week thing this is not
[57:33] just come to church and have an
[57:35] experience in the holy spirit because
[57:38] that's all it might be it's just an
[57:40] experience he says where you have to
[57:43] come down there and meet God and really
[57:46] pour out your life until something takes
[57:49] place we grew fruits up there but the
[57:51] fruit kills it that's right and every
[57:53] time there comes a little cool spell
[57:56] you've got nothing to rest
[57:58] upon he says when the emotion dies down
[58:02] then the shouts all gone the noises
[58:05] cease then where are you at what does it
[58:07] look like he says the Temptation comes
[58:09] along and then you can't take it what we
[58:13] need is to get down to that grinding
[58:15] place down there in the valley and dig
[58:17] out he says that's exactly right it's
[58:19] where the church needs to be tonight
[58:23] listen where did Israel have the
[58:24] greatest peace
[58:26] it wasn't in
[58:27] Egypt cuz there their task Masters
[58:30] worked them so hard they had no peace
[58:32] and it wasn't in Canaan because in
[58:33] Canaan it was constant fighting wasn't
[58:35] it do you know where they had the
[58:37] greatest peace in the desert you know
[58:41] why cuz nobody wants the desert there
[58:44] was nothing good in the
[58:47] desert you'll find that if you seek
[58:49] natural peace it's always a place of
[58:51] compromise there's no promise there cuz
[58:53] there's no there's no enemies there cuz
[58:54] there's no promise there there's nothing
[58:56] worth having there you want to have a
[58:58] life where nobody's bugging you you got
[58:59] to go someplace nobody wants to
[59:01] be that's right brother Bram says this
[59:05] he says stay in good standing with God
[59:08] let the rest of them go if they want to
[59:10] follow let them follow if they don't let
[59:12] them stay where they're at you're bound
[59:14] for the promised land like God said to
[59:16] Joshua he says it's a very type of them
[59:18] new ones coming out he said you've been
[59:20] on this mountain for 40 years wandering
[59:23] around what did they do out there them
[59:25] 40 years he says did God curse them no
[59:29] he blessed them in what he took care of
[59:32] their
[59:33] needs that's all church if we ever get
[59:36] to the place where it's just about our
[59:37] needs being met we've missed
[59:39] it we've missed it as was reading where
[59:42] Paul said you know when they were out
[59:43] and and and he says we we were scared we
[59:46] were in fear for our very
[59:49] lives things get tough for the Believers
[59:52] at
[59:53] times he says did God curse them out
[59:55] there he says no he blessed them oh they
[59:57] married wives and grow good crops and
[59:59] rais babies oh they had a wonderful time
[1:00:02] God was with them but it still wasn't
[1:00:05] the promise we can sit there and we can
[1:00:08] say I have all that I need I'm good but
[1:00:11] do you have the promise of this age do
[1:00:13] you have a resurrection and a Rapture
[1:00:15] coming up inside of you is there a
[1:00:16] Fountain of Life producing the word in
[1:00:18] your life are you just sitting here
[1:00:20] saying I have what I need that's what
[1:00:22] he's getting at it's a spirit of
[1:00:24] compromise it's a spirit that's willing
[1:00:26] to be to settle for far less than what
[1:00:27] God has told us what we what we own our
[1:00:30] inheritance inside of us we ought to be
[1:00:32] after peace Romans says that you know
[1:00:35] live peaceably with all men as much as
[1:00:37] lies within you as much as you can seek
[1:00:39] after peace but the thing is is that
[1:00:41] we're in a world where there's two
[1:00:42] kingdoms and we're with one of those
[1:00:44] kingdoms and guess what the other
[1:00:45] Kingdom doesn't want us to live doesn't
[1:00:47] want us to thrive it doesn't want us to
[1:00:49] prosper in the word and Satan's only
[1:00:51] goal is to destroy us which means we're
[1:00:53] not going to have peace while we're here
[1:00:55] well we get three and a half years of
[1:00:57] Peace when we go to the marriage supper
[1:00:58] of the lamb and then it's War for a
[1:01:00] while and then it's more peace and then
[1:01:02] it's the end then it's another war and
[1:01:04] then it's all
[1:01:05] done we're not going to get peace
[1:01:08] here Jesus said in John 10 the thief
[1:01:10] cometh not but for to steal to kill and
[1:01:14] destroy this is Satan's Satan's purpose
[1:01:16] but Jesus says I am come that they might
[1:01:18] have life and that they might have it
[1:01:20] more abundantly so our peace is in
[1:01:23] Christ Our peace is in the Holy Spirit
[1:01:25] it is not in the the fact that we're not
[1:01:26] battling that we're not fighting that
[1:01:28] things are going our way no our peace is
[1:01:30] in that he has called us he has chosen
[1:01:32] us and we are walking Our Lives
[1:01:34] according to his will amen we're in a
[1:01:37] place of spiritual Victory which means
[1:01:39] we're also in a place of spiritual
[1:01:40] battle every single day why because
[1:01:43] Satan's goal is to steal kill and
[1:01:45] destroy and God's goal is that we would
[1:01:47] have life in that more abundantly
[1:01:49] there's a disconnect between those two
[1:01:51] they're at completely opposite purposes
[1:01:53] and so Satan's trying to steal what
[1:01:55] belongs to us
[1:01:56] us he'll steal your joy he'll steal your
[1:01:59] peace he'll try and steal the fruits of
[1:02:01] the spirit he'll try and steal your
[1:02:02] family he'll steal your
[1:02:04] children whatever it might be and
[1:02:06] failing that he'll try and kill you take
[1:02:09] the life of God out of you praise the
[1:02:11] Lord he can't that in the end something
[1:02:14] keeps holding me that The Anchor Holds
[1:02:16] as we've sung so many times but then
[1:02:18] after that what's he looking to do is
[1:02:20] destroy the effect of the word in your
[1:02:21] life destroy the work that God's been
[1:02:24] using you for all of this time Satan's
[1:02:27] trying to hold back everything that
[1:02:29] belongs to the child of God and we've
[1:02:31] got to take it we've got to hold on to
[1:02:33] it and we read it in our opening
[1:02:35] scripture where Paul said but thanks be
[1:02:37] to God which giveth us the victory
[1:02:39] through our Lord Jesus Christ I want to
[1:02:42] talk about what that Victory does in our
[1:02:43] daily lives because Paul doesn't just
[1:02:45] leave this as some ethereal spiritual
[1:02:48] thing this is not just a spiritual
[1:02:50] Victory this is not just something we're
[1:02:52] going to have in the resurrection and
[1:02:53] the Rapture but this is something that
[1:02:55] comes down to to our very day-to-day
[1:02:56] lives as we'll see amen Paul says this
[1:02:59] is what victory looks like in 58 in
[1:03:02] verse 58 he's saying this is what this
[1:03:04] Victory ought to do in each and every
[1:03:06] one of our Lives it's not just a future
[1:03:08] Victory it's a right now Victory amen
[1:03:11] I'm interested in Victory right
[1:03:13] now there is a last victory that's over
[1:03:15] death hell in the grave and that's what
[1:03:16] he's talking about before this but
[1:03:18] there's a victory in the love divine
[1:03:20] that happens in our life day by day amen
[1:03:23] and he says in verse 58 therefore he
[1:03:25] says because of this Victory through
[1:03:27] Christ he says my beloved Brethren be ye
[1:03:30] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:03:34] the work of the Lord why for as much as
[1:03:37] you know that your labor is not in vain
[1:03:39] in the Lord he's saying you need to be
[1:03:41] this way this Victory ought to do
[1:03:43] something for you it ought to hold you
[1:03:45] steadfast in the calling where with God
[1:03:47] has placed you why because you know it's
[1:03:50] going to have an effect it's going to
[1:03:52] have impact there's a purpose behind all
[1:03:54] of these things and so what's Satan
[1:03:56] trying to do get us distracted from that
[1:03:59] daily steadfast immovable always
[1:04:01] abounding he's trying to get us to turn
[1:04:03] our derer off to understand what's
[1:04:05] happening in our day-to-day lives right
[1:04:08] Paul says always abounding because
[1:04:10] Satan's trying to get us to be Duty
[1:04:12] bound rather than
[1:04:13] spirit-led come on that's that's
[1:04:22] that I'm
[1:04:24] German I can go long time on
[1:04:28] duty but what happens is when you run on
[1:04:30] duty is eventually you just get worn out
[1:04:32] and you can't take it anymore and you're
[1:04:34] tired and you don't you know you ought
[1:04:36] to be more satisfied than you are but
[1:04:38] you're not why because you've lost the
[1:04:40] vision your discernment has been turned
[1:04:43] off it's gone offline and you don't
[1:04:45] realize that your day today is not
[1:04:48] Duty it is will it is God's will it is
[1:04:51] God's life for
[1:04:53] you amen
[1:04:55] Duty driven rather than
[1:04:58] spirit-led day by
[1:05:02] day Spirit Le Moment by moment to
[1:05:06] recognize that there is something going
[1:05:07] on all the time and God's trying to
[1:05:10] bring us to a place where we'll
[1:05:12] recognize these things what happens is
[1:05:14] we lose the idea of our
[1:05:16] purpose of what God's trying to do and
[1:05:19] we drop back into duty rather than than
[1:05:21] being
[1:05:23] spirit-led and what do we do we get
[1:05:26] tired we get worn we get brittle we get
[1:05:32] fractured we've got to see where where
[1:05:34] we are because God has placed us
[1:05:37] there this is the effect of the victory
[1:05:39] that Paul says in verse 58 he says be ye
[1:05:44] steadfast unmovable always abounding
[1:05:47] that word steadfast means firm and
[1:05:50] settled now unmovable is an interesting
[1:05:53] one because we think that means it
[1:05:54] cannot be moved but when you go to the
[1:05:56] original word it means firmly
[1:06:00] persistent remember like that woman that
[1:06:02] was going to the unjust
[1:06:04] judge and she kept knocking and she kept
[1:06:08] bothering him until she got her need met
[1:06:12] that's what unmovable means I won't let
[1:06:16] go I'll take you at your word I'll take
[1:06:19] you at your word I'll remind you of your
[1:06:21] word I'll remind you of your word I'm
[1:06:23] not moving from the promises and the
[1:06:25] word of God I'm not going to do it
[1:06:27] that's what he means here unmovable
[1:06:29] unable to be moved from your place and
[1:06:31] your position in Christ then he says
[1:06:34] always abounding I love this it's it
[1:06:36] means exceeding increasing overflowing
[1:06:39] so rich that there is an abundance so
[1:06:42] this victory that Paul's talking about
[1:06:43] in our lives ought to make us all of
[1:06:46] those three things you know what that
[1:06:47] means Church it means give it all you've
[1:06:49] got don't hold back don't just give it a
[1:06:51] halfway effort I was reading a quote
[1:06:53] there brother bam said a halfway chrisan
[1:06:55] is the most miserable Christian listen
[1:06:58] Church a halfway mother's the most
[1:06:59] miserable mother a halfway father's the
[1:07:01] most miserable father a halfway
[1:07:03] employees the most miserable employee
[1:07:05] because they're not getting anywhere
[1:07:07] there's nothing good coming out of what
[1:07:09] they're doing but if we give it our all
[1:07:12] that's when we start to see the results
[1:07:14] because why we're doing it with purpose
[1:07:17] we're doing it with purpose we've got a
[1:07:18] revelation amen we're not living for the
[1:07:21] weekend as we are talking about but
[1:07:22] we're living every moment what under the
[1:07:25] revelation that we're doing these things
[1:07:26] for purpose it's not about energy it's
[1:07:30] about faithfulness it's about saying
[1:07:32] Lord keep me true to your work it's that
[1:07:36] steady Christian Life that
[1:07:38] consistency amen but that consistency
[1:07:41] needs to be fed our Revelation has to be
[1:07:44] be be fed we have to be reminded Peter
[1:07:47] would say stir up your P pure Minds by
[1:07:49] way of remembrance that's why we read
[1:07:51] our Bibles in the morning that's why we
[1:07:53] pray to the Lord that's why we spend
[1:07:55] time listening to worshipful music it's
[1:07:57] to remind us of our purpose to remind us
[1:07:59] of who we are on a regular
[1:08:02] basis you know we can get caught up in
[1:08:04] the Simplicity of our lives but Moses
[1:08:06] when he came to that great meeting in
[1:08:08] the with with the the the the burning
[1:08:10] bush you know what he brought with him
[1:08:13] he brought with him a Shepherd staff he
[1:08:15] brought the tools of his day-to-day work
[1:08:17] with him and what did God say he says
[1:08:20] what do you have in your hand Moses says
[1:08:21] how am I going to do this Lord how am I
[1:08:23] going to bring these children out and
[1:08:25] God says what's that in your hand
[1:08:27] Moses God how am I going to bring people
[1:08:29] to you God how am I going to be a
[1:08:31] witness for you what's that in your hand
[1:08:33] son what's that in your hand daughter
[1:08:35] and he used Moses what
[1:08:39] training his career to go and deliver
[1:08:42] Israel he put Power into that staff it
[1:08:46] was a symbol of God's Authority and
[1:08:48] power and when Moses would raise that
[1:08:50] staff when he would point it things
[1:08:52] would happen and things would change and
[1:08:53] we even know it would transform into a a
[1:08:55] snake and then it would come back into a
[1:08:57] rod again God would use those little
[1:09:00] things day by
[1:09:02] day to what produce the Supernatural and
[1:09:06] we can sit here and we can say I'm
[1:09:08] nothing I'm
[1:09:09] little I'm just a mom at home I'm just a
[1:09:12] kid at school I'm just a young sister at
[1:09:14] work how is he going to use God saying
[1:09:16] what do you have in your hand what have
[1:09:18] I given you where have I placed you let
[1:09:20] me use whatever it is you have and
[1:09:22] you'll see the Supernatural start to
[1:09:24] work the nobodies are the ones God's
[1:09:26] coming to use anyways Jesus would say
[1:09:29] this in Luke he says and he lifted up
[1:09:31] his eyes on his disciples and said
[1:09:32] blessed be ye poor for yours is the
[1:09:35] kingdom of God poor there does not
[1:09:37] mean lacking in in money your wealth
[1:09:41] that word poor means devoid of spiritual
[1:09:46] arrogance
[1:09:49] nobody's people that say what am I in
[1:09:52] the kingdom of God am I anything that
[1:09:54] matters
[1:09:56] it means those who regard themselves as
[1:09:58] spiritually insignificant it doesn't
[1:10:00] mean they are insignificant it means
[1:10:02] they consider themselves to be
[1:10:04] insignificant that's the ones that Jesus
[1:10:06] said listen the kingdom of God is for
[1:10:08] you that's who the Holy Ghost is for
[1:10:10] that's who the working of God is for as
[1:10:12] the ones that think they're nobody's cuz
[1:10:14] that's the only ones he can use and the
[1:10:16] ones that thought they were somebody he
[1:10:17] had to beat them down and break them
[1:10:20] apart we've got to start out as
[1:10:23] nobody's but this message came in this
[1:10:26] in this time and in this season and in
[1:10:28] this age to take us out from nobody's to
[1:10:30] say you are actually somebody though
[1:10:32] you're a child of God you're a Son of
[1:10:33] God you're a daughter of God you are in
[1:10:35] his thoughts before the foundation of
[1:10:37] the world and there's only a few that
[1:10:39] are that way so rise up as we saw as we
[1:10:42] sang this morning Rise Up On Wings of
[1:10:44] Faith recognize who you are you're an
[1:10:46] eagle in a chicken yard and start living
[1:10:48] and start producing what is in you to be
[1:10:51] amen it's the common people that heard
[1:10:54] Christ gladly
[1:10:57] but what does this word do it opens our
[1:10:59] eyes of understanding to recognize who
[1:11:01] we are to recognize what's going on
[1:11:03] around us and it's Christ revealing
[1:11:05] himself to us that's what the new birth
[1:11:07] is is Christ revealing himself to us
[1:11:09] that we're a part of him that we have a
[1:11:11] place in him that we have a purpose in
[1:11:13] him
[1:11:15] amen that means we're a manifestation of
[1:11:17] the word the same as Christ was and
[1:11:19] that's a heady thought to somebody that
[1:11:21] thinks there are
[1:11:22] nobody that I'm a part of God that
[1:11:24] Christ is revealed through me that we're
[1:11:27] not just here to use up our share of
[1:11:29] oxygen that's allotted to each person in
[1:11:31] this earth and then we go off and that's
[1:11:32] it it's said and done no but there's
[1:11:34] this day byday thing and I think it's
[1:11:36] one of the greatest things missing from
[1:11:37] us is that we're looking for God only in
[1:11:40] the big
[1:11:41] things and we're not seeing him in the
[1:11:43] day-to-day little things we've talked
[1:11:45] about that mountain being removed Pebble
[1:11:47] by Pebble Pebble but can we see God
[1:11:50] moving in our lives Pebble by Pebble you
[1:11:53] got to we have to realize and I know
[1:11:54] this is when they when they preach the
[1:11:56] the Rapture so often it was preached as
[1:11:59] an instantaneous thing because that's
[1:12:02] the finish of the Rapture but as we've
[1:12:04] grown in the ministry and in this
[1:12:06] message we've realized that the Rapture
[1:12:07] is an ongoing process that brings us to
[1:12:10] an instantaneous moment there are things
[1:12:12] that are happening every single day that
[1:12:14] are bringing us to that certain end and
[1:12:17] if we can see the little things that are
[1:12:19] happening it gives us face for the big
[1:12:21] thing that we're looking for at the end
[1:12:22] because the big things are just a bunch
[1:12:24] of little things that are built
[1:12:25] that's it that's it as I've said before
[1:12:28] if we're waiting for this big bang to
[1:12:29] happen at the end we probably going to
[1:12:31] miss it because God is moving all the
[1:12:33] way through to build us up line upon
[1:12:35] line word upon word here a little there
[1:12:37] a little just building up that bride
[1:12:38] into his Perfection
[1:12:40] amen Small Things always lead us to the
[1:12:42] big things brother bam says this in
[1:12:44] adore and adore he says and God does it
[1:12:46] that way he's very unusual unusual times
[1:12:49] unusual ways and sometimes little things
[1:12:52] he says we fail to find God many times
[1:12:55] because it's we think too
[1:13:01] small now we look at that as an external
[1:13:03] thing it's too
[1:13:06] small but we're talking about us this
[1:13:08] morning about us that think we're too
[1:13:11] small he says well you say all I ever
[1:13:13] done was haral out these old clouds he's
[1:13:15] talking about a farmer he says I'd take
[1:13:17] out early in the evening I didn't know
[1:13:19] how to make my kids a living I looked at
[1:13:20] the poor fellas with no shoes on I've
[1:13:22] sat and cried I've got an old buggy and
[1:13:24] me and ma went to
[1:13:26] church brother saying I barely have
[1:13:28] provided for my family and I'm just
[1:13:30] doing what I know how to do he says
[1:13:33] don't you worry brother you just keep
[1:13:35] loving him he's got a purpose for you
[1:13:39] you just stay right where you are and
[1:13:41] just go right on see you might never
[1:13:44] preach a sermon but you might be the
[1:13:46] great-grandfather of one that'll do it
[1:13:48] did you know that God credited Levi to
[1:13:51] pay ties when he was in the loins of
[1:13:52] Abraham when melkisedek met him in other
[1:13:55] words Abraham's work Abraham's Faith was
[1:13:59] to produce something that would benefit
[1:14:01] Levi in the future and he never knew it
[1:14:05] he never knew it as we said last service
[1:14:07] we talked about that mountain that's
[1:14:08] moved Pebble by Pebble and if we're
[1:14:11] waiting to see the mountain move our
[1:14:12] faith will usually fail if we're to be
[1:14:16] honest amen been there done that got the
[1:14:19] T-shirt but if we can see the little
[1:14:21] Pebbles moving what does it do it
[1:14:23] sustains our faith it sustains our faith
[1:14:26] and so what we've got to be doing is
[1:14:27] saying Lord where are you moving Lord
[1:14:29] help me to see it brother bman has said
[1:14:31] this many times people can see what God
[1:14:33] did and people can look forward for what
[1:14:34] God's doing and they miss what he's
[1:14:35] doing right now we're talking about
[1:14:38] seeing what he's doing right now in the
[1:14:39] little things that we do day by
[1:14:43] day when it comes to our adoption our
[1:14:45] position in Christ all these things if
[1:14:47] we're waiting for the big things it's
[1:14:49] because we're missing out on the little
[1:14:50] things we'll see that adoption comes by
[1:14:52] a series of small things we see it in
[1:14:55] David's life where God started with him
[1:14:56] he comes out and he's anointed by the
[1:14:58] prophet the spirit of God drops on him
[1:15:00] he's got a king anointing and where does
[1:15:01] he go he's maybe 14 years old 13 years
[1:15:03] old he goes right back out to the sheep
[1:15:06] and what does David do he stays faithful
[1:15:08] as a Shepherd that's
[1:15:11] all what an anointing was on him and he
[1:15:15] goes right back and he proves his
[1:15:16] faithfulness in the shepherd
[1:15:18] business kills a bear kills a lion and
[1:15:23] then God says okay David you proven
[1:15:25] faithful net let's step it up a bit and
[1:15:26] he takes him over and he meets
[1:15:28] Goliath David's got a king anointing
[1:15:30] what's a king anointing Victory always
[1:15:33] Victory he sees Goliath he says how come
[1:15:36] this guy's still
[1:15:37] standing and the spirit of God is on him
[1:15:39] and he goes out and he kills Goliath and
[1:15:42] then what happens is he becomes a
[1:15:43] captain in the Army and he's faithful in
[1:15:45] all of those little things and so that
[1:15:47] by the time he gets to the big seat he's
[1:15:49] faithful in it because he's been proven
[1:15:51] in the little things now he's been
[1:15:53] proven to take the big things
[1:15:58] Jesus said this he that is faithful in
[1:16:00] that which is least is faithful also in
[1:16:03] much and he that is unjust in the least
[1:16:06] is unjust also in the much whatever
[1:16:08] you're doing with the little things is
[1:16:09] what you'll do with the big things I
[1:16:10] have a funny story to tell on myself
[1:16:13] when I was in Texas I had this great
[1:16:15] idea that I wanted to patent and then
[1:16:17] see if I could develop it but I was
[1:16:19] worried because it was going to make me
[1:16:21] a multi-millionaire
[1:16:25] okay but I was worried because it was
[1:16:27] going to make me a multi-millionaire and
[1:16:29] you know what my worry was that it would
[1:16:31] change
[1:16:32] me and so I went and I talked with my
[1:16:35] pastor Brother David mcgi and my wife
[1:16:37] was there and and I told him about this
[1:16:38] idea and I said but Brother David I said
[1:16:40] I I don't know if I should do this I
[1:16:42] said I'm worried that that kind of money
[1:16:43] would change me and you know what he did
[1:16:45] he burst out laughing he said John he
[1:16:49] says the way you are with money now is
[1:16:51] the way you'll be with money if you get
[1:16:53] a lot more the way you are now is the
[1:16:55] way you're going to be and we see it in
[1:16:57] our lives you see it with people that
[1:16:59] don't have much but they've got the
[1:17:00] latest phone they've got the latest
[1:17:01] sneakers and they've got the latest
[1:17:03] gadgets and they've got nothing else and
[1:17:05] you give them a bunch of money and
[1:17:06] they'll just waste it on more toys and
[1:17:08] you got people that don't have much but
[1:17:09] what they do they use very Faithfully
[1:17:11] they're very conservative and you give
[1:17:12] them a bunch of money and they'll do the
[1:17:13] same thing Jesus said listen whatever
[1:17:16] you're doing in the small things that's
[1:17:17] what you're going to do in the big
[1:17:18] things and you can pretend all day long
[1:17:21] that you would change when the big time
[1:17:22] comes up but it's not why because the
[1:17:25] little things are proving your nature
[1:17:26] they're proving your character they're
[1:17:28] proving what's inside of you and so if
[1:17:30] you're not going to be faithful in the
[1:17:31] little things then the big things aren't
[1:17:32] going to come your
[1:17:34] way we're talking about stepping up
[1:17:36] we're talking about faithfulness this
[1:17:38] morning and we've got to have that same
[1:17:39] vision that Christ has that same
[1:17:41] understanding that I'm here to do the
[1:17:42] will of my father and in everything I do
[1:17:44] I I was reading a quote where brother
[1:17:45] bam says that a a real Christian they
[1:17:47] will do the the right thing whether
[1:17:50] anybody's watching or
[1:17:52] not that's a test of character
[1:17:55] see just just simple human Pride will
[1:17:57] tell make us do the right thing when
[1:17:58] other people are watching but what holds
[1:18:00] us when nobody's watching that's got to
[1:18:02] be the Holy Ghost that's got to be
[1:18:03] something inside of us he says this he
[1:18:06] says I said as I said about Arnold van
[1:18:08] winkl that was the one that R ran and
[1:18:10] and threw himself on the spears to save
[1:18:12] Switzerland he says do all you can with
[1:18:15] what you have so just be faithful in the
[1:18:18] office that's given you you know what
[1:18:20] faithful means it's two words faithful
[1:18:23] full of faith no
[1:18:25] doubt no doubt believing that where you
[1:18:29] are has purpose has meaning has impact
[1:18:31] has
[1:18:33] value that it's for a reason and with
[1:18:36] that come rights with that comes
[1:18:37] god-given position with it comes
[1:18:39] Authority don't doubt where you're at
[1:18:42] but trust and be faithful in those
[1:18:43] little things I want to walk us through
[1:18:46] some some things this morning and I want
[1:18:47] to start with two seemingly unrelated
[1:18:49] ideas almost Polar Opposites to see how
[1:18:51] it fits into faithfulness now brother
[1:18:53] brandom I want to start with quote
[1:18:55] before we go to the scriptures he says
[1:18:56] now Moses being called for this purpose
[1:18:59] but he was a man God trained him 80
[1:19:02] years before he was ever able to use him
[1:19:05] 40 years in the palace 40 years in the
[1:19:07] wilderness he says God can train a man
[1:19:10] take him a hundred years for 30 minutes
[1:19:13] of work God knows how to train so it's a
[1:19:17] the way we can read this is that it's a
[1:19:18] bunch of work for just one moment of
[1:19:21] time where God has ordained them to do
[1:19:23] something so they spend all this time
[1:19:25] and it all comes down to that 30-minute
[1:19:27] window now that might seem
[1:19:30] excessive that might seem excessive that
[1:19:32] we're working for a 100 years to do 30
[1:19:34] minutes of work but how does that look
[1:19:36] in real life see it's not like we're
[1:19:39] just going to be walking through life
[1:19:40] and then boom something's going to
[1:19:41] happen and we do it it's that faithful
[1:19:44] day byday humble Victorious Christian
[1:19:47] walk that leads up to that 30 minutes
[1:19:49] because what happens is we can sit here
[1:19:51] and dream up all these kinds of ways
[1:19:53] that God's going to use us but the fact
[1:19:55] is most of us it's just going to be
[1:19:56] simple humble
[1:19:58] ways when you read the Bible you don't
[1:20:01] have 50,000 people doing Mighty works
[1:20:04] you know what you have you have 50,000
[1:20:06] people living simple humble Victorian
[1:20:09] Victorious Christian lives not Victorian
[1:20:11] lives right and then you have certain
[1:20:14] ones that the spirit of God will drop
[1:20:15] down and use in a very special
[1:20:20] way we see in the
[1:20:22] scriptures people in there
[1:20:25] and they just have one mention One
[1:20:27] Moment One event but what we don't see
[1:20:31] is everything before it and everything
[1:20:33] after
[1:20:34] it and that's what we want to talk about
[1:20:36] amen they might not have even known that
[1:20:39] what they did was going to have the
[1:20:40] effected head Abraham certain didn't
[1:20:42] certainly didn't know he was paying
[1:20:44] Levi's tithes did
[1:20:46] he we can s a seed and not even realize
[1:20:50] we've done it and we don't realize so
[1:20:53] many times that we've even passed that
[1:20:54] that that point in our lives we can look
[1:20:57] in the scriptures we want to talk about
[1:20:58] somebody that's that's just got a moment
[1:21:00] where they've got to stand up and we
[1:21:01] look at non the Syrian captain and he
[1:21:03] had leprosy and he was doomed to a life
[1:21:05] of Separation back then if you were a
[1:21:07] leper you couldn't be around Society you
[1:21:09] couldn't be around people and it was a
[1:21:11] life where you would slowly just lose
[1:21:12] your fingers and your toes and these
[1:21:14] things and it would slowly creep into
[1:21:15] the rest of your body and then you'd die
[1:21:17] in agonizing death and that's what he
[1:21:19] had in front of him but we see God had
[1:21:21] prepared somebody for
[1:21:22] non we're talking about stepping up
[1:21:26] faithfulness wherever you are he says
[1:21:28] now non captain of the host of the king
[1:21:30] of Syria was a great man with his master
[1:21:32] and honorable because by him the Lord
[1:21:34] had given Deliverance unto Syria oh non
[1:21:37] was a tool in the hands of God he was
[1:21:40] also a mighty man in Valor but he was a
[1:21:42] leper and the syrians had gone out by
[1:21:44] companies and had brought away a captive
[1:21:46] out of the land of Israel a little maid
[1:21:48] and she waited on non's wife and she
[1:21:51] said unto her mistress would God my Lord
[1:21:54] were with the prophet that is in Samaria
[1:21:56] for he will recover him of his leprosy
[1:21:59] so we've got a little believing girl
[1:22:00] raised right around Christian Home
[1:22:02] raised in a believing home and she had
[1:22:04] faith in the promises of God she was
[1:22:07] raised
[1:22:09] right you know sometimes we look at our
[1:22:11] kids that have gone
[1:22:13] out and we say what's gone wrong you
[1:22:16] know sometimes they're a witness even in
[1:22:17] their fallen condition because they
[1:22:20] won't go certain places they won't do
[1:22:22] certain things there's still something
[1:22:24] in them that holds them scripture says
[1:22:26] train up a child in the way he should go
[1:22:28] and when he is old he'll not turn away
[1:22:30] from it and there's things that are
[1:22:33] locked in when we teach and Tra raise
[1:22:35] our kids in the admonition and fear of
[1:22:37] the Lord that'll hold them even in times
[1:22:38] when they don't even think about it it's
[1:22:40] just built into them in these things but
[1:22:42] this this young woman this young girl we
[1:22:44] look at her life and we'd say how unfair
[1:22:47] how unfair that she's taken away from
[1:22:49] family she can't go to church she can't
[1:22:51] worship the way the rest of them she
[1:22:52] can't even give a sacrifice she can't be
[1:22:54] under the blood everything that she
[1:22:57] would be crying out for she can't have
[1:22:58] it and yet she's here in the household
[1:23:00] of her master and she's sitting there
[1:23:02] and she's got to make a decision do I
[1:23:04] testify or do I not do I say this is
[1:23:07] God's judgment on him for for taking a
[1:23:10] child of God and putting them under
[1:23:14] servitude this is a man that owns me as
[1:23:16] a slave why would I do anything good for
[1:23:20] him but we see something in her and
[1:23:23] whatever it was she
[1:23:25] says I just
[1:23:27] wish that he could be where the Prophet
[1:23:30] is cuz if he was with the Prophet The
[1:23:32] Prophet would heal him and she gives his
[1:23:35] testimony she could sit there and in her
[1:23:37] bitterness decide no I'm not going to
[1:23:39] say a thing or she could say there's a
[1:23:41] need and I know how the need can be
[1:23:44] met we can lead a horse to water we
[1:23:46] can't make it drink she couldn't Force
[1:23:48] non to go but she could tell him there's
[1:23:49] a remedy there's a remedy there's an
[1:23:52] answer to what you're dealing with how
[1:23:54] many times do we sit
[1:23:57] quiet because we're worried about the
[1:23:59] response we're going to
[1:24:00] get because you know what they'll label
[1:24:03] us Fanatics Holy Rollers right-wing nuts
[1:24:08] these days everything Christian is
[1:24:09] associated with the extreme
[1:24:13] right my wife was sharing something
[1:24:16] about how you know she was with a a
[1:24:18] Homeschool Group and they said a certain
[1:24:20] thing and she was just going to let it
[1:24:21] go and then but she said you know what
[1:24:23] I'm not going to let it go and she said
[1:24:24] I am not that I am not this and I am not
[1:24:27] this and by the way I'm not this either
[1:24:29] because what they're doing is when they
[1:24:30] hear Christian or where when they see
[1:24:32] Holiness they automatically assume
[1:24:33] you're a certain way and they put you
[1:24:35] into a box with a bunch of other people
[1:24:36] and she said no I'm not going to be that
[1:24:38] way I'm not that way I'm not one of them
[1:24:40] I'm different I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:24:42] daughter of God we've got to be able to
[1:24:44] stand up and be branded but let's be
[1:24:46] branded by the word not by what they
[1:24:48] think about us amen what was the end
[1:24:51] result of this this little girl speaks
[1:24:54] up non finally decides that he's going
[1:24:56] to do it he goes there he goes through
[1:24:57] his little trial he finally goes and
[1:24:59] dips in the Jordan seven times he didn't
[1:25:01] just get healed church he gave his life
[1:25:03] to serve Jehovah after that he said I'm
[1:25:06] going to go back and I won't sacrifice
[1:25:07] to any more Gods he says I'm going to be
[1:25:09] forced to go into temple with my master
[1:25:13] he says and I'm going to be forced to
[1:25:15] Bow he says but I won't pray to that God
[1:25:17] he gave his heart to the Lord because
[1:25:19] that little girl in her little position
[1:25:22] testified of a living God
[1:25:25] we read that quote where brother Bram
[1:25:26] says God can train a person for 30
[1:25:27] minutes of
[1:25:29] work but like I said we don't see what
[1:25:31] leads up to that 30 minutes of work and
[1:25:34] how God is working and building us up to
[1:25:36] that and we say that it's just a
[1:25:38] moment but there's a lot of little
[1:25:40] moments leading up to the big moment
[1:25:42] amen it's a life's work to get to that
[1:25:44] you know what sometimes we don't even
[1:25:46] realize we've done our 30 minutes of
[1:25:49] work we don't realize the seeds we
[1:25:51] planted we don't realize the impact
[1:25:53] we've had until
[1:25:54] much further down the road and we've
[1:25:56] been in that ordained adopted position
[1:25:59] and we've literally done the work that
[1:26:00] God has required us to do and we don't
[1:26:02] even know it yet because what we're
[1:26:04] waiting for the
[1:26:05] results but as soon as you did the
[1:26:07] action the results were guaranteed
[1:26:09] because you were doing the work of God
[1:26:11] that's why we never stop working we
[1:26:12] never stop believing we never know when
[1:26:15] we' finished our work we never know
[1:26:17] often when we're actually doing the work
[1:26:20] that's why we need to be Spirit L is to
[1:26:22] trust that everything we're going
[1:26:23] through is Led of god listen to this
[1:26:25] Ecclesiastes 11 says cast your bread
[1:26:27] upon the waters for you will find it
[1:26:30] after many days what is bread represent
[1:26:33] in the Scripture it represents the word
[1:26:34] of God what's he saying he's saying take
[1:26:36] God at his word and put it into action
[1:26:39] put it on your lips put it on your mouth
[1:26:41] talk it live it put it out there don't
[1:26:45] hold it to yourself but put it out there
[1:26:47] amen and what after many days you'll see
[1:26:50] the results not the day you give it is
[1:26:53] the day you get the results
[1:26:54] there's people that I've been witnessing
[1:26:56] to now for over a year year and a half
[1:26:58] there's people I've witnessed to for
[1:26:59] decades now and they keep coming back
[1:27:03] from time to time and I don't know if
[1:27:04] they're going to come in or not so what
[1:27:06] do I do stay faithful keep witnessing
[1:27:09] keep encouraging keep pointing them to
[1:27:11] the word that's what we do day in and
[1:27:13] day out and day in and day out keeping
[1:27:16] that word in my mouth keeping it in my
[1:27:18] mind so that I'm ready to give an answer
[1:27:20] so that I'm ready to be used in these
[1:27:22] things why cuz there's Souls out out
[1:27:24] there that are trusting that are waiting
[1:27:26] that are needing us to be in our
[1:27:27] position as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:30] brother Braham says this he says until
[1:27:31] the
[1:27:32] burden gets on the Christian church for
[1:27:35] lost souls we're fighting the air you
[1:27:37] know what fighting the air is Shadow
[1:27:39] Boxing where you're
[1:27:42] practicing practicing is good but it
[1:27:44] doesn't achieve anything in the end you
[1:27:46] got to get in the ring you got to put it
[1:27:48] to use you got to start fighting it
[1:27:50] looks good but you've got no opponent
[1:27:51] you've got no purpose in it your
[1:27:53] training he says we got to get past the
[1:27:54] training we've got to get to actually
[1:27:56] doing he says I believe in gifts and
[1:27:58] signs and wonders why certainly that
[1:28:00] goes with the body but let's not put
[1:28:02] that ahead of love and lost souls let's
[1:28:05] get a burden on our hearts he says
[1:28:07] nothing but lost souls it's the only
[1:28:09] thing that's got any value in
[1:28:10] it it's the only thing we get to take
[1:28:13] over is our
[1:28:14] soul amen money passes away homes Decay
[1:28:18] and go away everything in the Earth
[1:28:20] moves away the only value lasting value
[1:28:23] I'd rather have one soul in glory that I
[1:28:25] want to Christ to know and see that that
[1:28:28] light of God circles around that Soul
[1:28:30] through all eternity my name to be
[1:28:32] associated with that then to have every
[1:28:34] penny of money in the whole earth
[1:28:35] because I'd have to lose it all he says
[1:28:37] but what you send up there is eternal
[1:28:40] that's the reason we're trying that's
[1:28:41] the reason we live the lives we live
[1:28:43] that's the reason we say the things we
[1:28:44] say that's the reason we don't say the
[1:28:46] things we don't
[1:28:47] say Amen we keep still as much as we
[1:28:50] talk many times and we've got to be led
[1:28:51] in those things amen we've got it and
[1:28:54] we've got to let other people have it as
[1:28:55] well that's the reason why we're here
[1:28:57] Church mothers that's why you mother
[1:28:59] fathers that's why you father employees
[1:29:01] that's why you work bosses that's why
[1:29:03] you manage is to find Souls is to be a
[1:29:06] witness and a testimony we're here to
[1:29:08] gather souls to
[1:29:10] Christ amen for some it will only be our
[1:29:15] children and I'm not saying only as if
[1:29:17] that's somehow a a low thing or a poor
[1:29:19] thing that is our lot in life is to take
[1:29:22] our children to Christ and for mothers
[1:29:24] that may very well be the ones that you
[1:29:26] bring in but fathers we interact with
[1:29:29] people on a greater basis and I believe
[1:29:31] we're not just here to bring our kids to
[1:29:33] the Lord I believe we're here to bring
[1:29:34] people around us to the Lord as well
[1:29:36] everywhere we go we're supposed to be
[1:29:38] testifying of a living Christ not a dead
[1:29:41] work not a dead denomination not just
[1:29:43] forms and Creeds but what it's Christ
[1:29:45] that's living inside of me what is it
[1:29:48] it's that steadfast unmovable always
[1:29:50] abounding life that Paul talked about
[1:29:52] that's Victory that's Victory on a daily
[1:29:55] basis amen it's not that we won't have
[1:29:57] great signs and wonders but it's
[1:29:59] sometimes we miss the great sign and
[1:30:01] wonder of a people that can live above
[1:30:02] this
[1:30:04] world that people that can have the same
[1:30:06] mind that don't get caught up in the
[1:30:08] politics and the the new societal norms
[1:30:10] and man's ideas and these different
[1:30:12] things you know I've been going through
[1:30:15] the church age book with with brother
[1:30:16] Kingsley and as we read in there we see
[1:30:18] that the great unification of Satan's
[1:30:20] power was politics and religion you know
[1:30:22] what that tells me when we bring
[1:30:23] politics in here we've lost it has no
[1:30:26] place I can talk about current events
[1:30:30] but I am not here to endorse any party
[1:30:32] any person any system because every
[1:30:35] single one of them every single one of
[1:30:37] them is under Satan's
[1:30:39] control rightwing left wing Center
[1:30:42] doesn't matter they're all under Satan's
[1:30:44] control and yet we have preachers
[1:30:46] that'll come up and and endorse one or
[1:30:48] the other they haven't read their
[1:30:49] Bibles they've gotten caught up in their
[1:30:51] own flesh
[1:30:55] it may be our gracious
[1:30:56] attitude it may be our willingness
[1:30:59] to sacrifice oursel for somebody else
[1:31:02] that brings them to Christ it's not
[1:31:03] always the words we say there's people
[1:31:05] watching us all the time that we have no
[1:31:07] no clue
[1:31:08] about brother says this way many times
[1:31:12] we think just because anything is small
[1:31:14] that it's not noticeable but Jesus said
[1:31:16] that even a sparrow who was two of them
[1:31:18] sold for the fourth of a penny not one
[1:31:20] of those little birds could fall to the
[1:31:22] ground without God knowing it God
[1:31:24] notices little things now let's take
[1:31:27] ourselves here he says now many times
[1:31:29] you say I can't do very much about at
[1:31:32] the conditions today we look around it
[1:31:34] is a messed up world it is messed up
[1:31:37] Church there's no coming back there's no
[1:31:41] saving it it has to be destroyed and a
[1:31:45] new one brought down and we can look at
[1:31:47] this and we can say what in the world
[1:31:49] can I do about this it's just little old
[1:31:51] me and I don't care if we're the
[1:31:53] greatest preacher in the world or we're
[1:31:55] just a a little little kid sitting on
[1:31:57] the bench
[1:31:58] today what he says I can't do very much
[1:32:01] about it the conditions today he says
[1:32:03] but just a little kind word to
[1:32:06] someone an
[1:32:08] invitation a little testimony a little
[1:32:11] kind smile or a greeting to a passor by
[1:32:14] might mean more than you think it does
[1:32:17] it's
[1:32:17] little my wife and I when we celebrated
[1:32:20] our anniversary a week or two ago we
[1:32:22] went to a restaurant to get a quick
[1:32:23] treat
[1:32:24] and and the the clerk there at the at
[1:32:26] the front was very harried she was just
[1:32:29] there were so many people there they
[1:32:31] weren't keeping up and so we had to
[1:32:32] stand around for about 10 minutes and
[1:32:34] she was just back and forth back and
[1:32:35] forth she knew that we were waiting
[1:32:37] there was people behind us as well and
[1:32:39] so when time finally came for for us to
[1:32:41] order she came there and she was braced
[1:32:44] for what we were going to
[1:32:46] say and you know what I did I said how
[1:32:50] are you doing and I just gave her a
[1:32:52] small smile and as soon as that happened
[1:32:55] she completely changed and my wife
[1:32:57] commented after she said did you notice
[1:32:59] how she changed when you spoke to her
[1:33:00] like
[1:33:01] that why cuz I had a right perhaps
[1:33:05] certainly Leo DEA would say I had a
[1:33:07] right to be mad we're here and we're
[1:33:09] waiting 10 minutes for somebody to take
[1:33:10] our
[1:33:12] order but I'm not there to claim my
[1:33:15] rights I'm there to be a witness even in
[1:33:19] something as simple as ordering at a
[1:33:21] Dairy Queen
[1:33:25] she figured I had a right to be
[1:33:27] frustrated and perhaps I did but who
[1:33:30] cares who cares it's certainly not worth
[1:33:32] taking it out on a poor little
[1:33:35] lady that's just trying to make a living
[1:33:40] amen we don't see so often how those
[1:33:44] little things can build up to where
[1:33:47] somebody can trust us to open up about
[1:33:50] something I've shared what's happened at
[1:33:52] work and and getting these emails and
[1:33:54] getting people reach out to me and what
[1:33:56] is it it's just a little bit by little
[1:33:58] bit it's a little word here little
[1:33:59] testimony there little encouragement
[1:34:01] there a little right attitude there and
[1:34:04] what happens is people start to put
[1:34:05] together that there's something
[1:34:07] different and you'll never mention the
[1:34:09] scriptures perhaps but just that simple
[1:34:12] consistency of being something that has
[1:34:14] Christ someone that has Christ living
[1:34:15] through them it draws people to you that
[1:34:18] have
[1:34:19] needs arrogant people don't need Christ
[1:34:22] they're not looking for him but people
[1:34:23] with needs are drawn to Believers I
[1:34:25] found real Believers brother BR says
[1:34:28] this he says and many there will be many
[1:34:30] there that we didn't even think would be
[1:34:32] there he says for you know at that that
[1:34:35] that time that I believe that the bread
[1:34:36] that we've cast upon the human Troubled
[1:34:38] Waters will return to us on that day I
[1:34:41] didn't say that when we were speaking
[1:34:42] but in in the scripture Waters is always
[1:34:44] people cast the word upon the
[1:34:48] people and so often we want to make it
[1:34:50] about the word that we say and forget
[1:34:53] that the word that we live is just as
[1:34:55] important he says when we see the
[1:34:57] effects of Our Testimony on people that
[1:35:00] we didn't understand their action
[1:35:02] towards it will probably be there things
[1:35:05] that we did that we didn't realize
[1:35:07] that's what brought people to Christ
[1:35:10] that opened the door that brought them
[1:35:11] to a place where they could accept what
[1:35:13] we believe now there's people that hear
[1:35:15] what we believe and they walk away
[1:35:17] because it's too different they like the
[1:35:19] results but they can't they can't go the
[1:35:21] way that we've gone but there's people
[1:35:23] that see the results and they say I want
[1:35:24] the results no matter what and they'll
[1:35:26] go with what we believe he says we
[1:35:29] didn't understand their actions toward
[1:35:30] it we'll probably be there what a day
[1:35:32] that will be he says then also the seeds
[1:35:34] that we SED not even thinking that what
[1:35:37] they would do but here they are that's
[1:35:41] why I said you may have done your 30
[1:35:42] minutes of work and not known it because
[1:35:45] you solded a seed that was going to
[1:35:46] bring eternal
[1:35:47] life he says they brought forth precious
[1:35:50] fruits and will see them on that day he
[1:35:53] says the way Wayward loved ones and
[1:35:57] relatives there are people I see on a
[1:35:59] regular basis and whether you go to the
[1:36:00] Post Office you go to the gym you go to
[1:36:02] the hardware store you go to the grocery
[1:36:04] store and I don't know their name but I
[1:36:05] know their face and you might have just
[1:36:08] those little interactions with them on a
[1:36:10] daily basis but as you do and as you
[1:36:12] smile and as you make yourself open to
[1:36:14] that person you'll find that
[1:36:16] conversations happen whether it's in the
[1:36:18] locker room whether it's just standing
[1:36:20] in line whatever it might be and
[1:36:22] conversations happen and what are what
[1:36:24] we need to say is Lord is there an
[1:36:26] opportunity here Lord help build these
[1:36:29] little interactions into an opportunity
[1:36:32] I say Lord help me be ready when the
[1:36:33] moment comes because what happens so
[1:36:35] often is we're so busy trying to
[1:36:37] separate from the world that we can't
[1:36:39] actually give the word to that person
[1:36:41] we're trying to stay so separate that we
[1:36:43] can't be a witness and we say well I'll
[1:36:45] let my life do it Church there has to
[1:36:46] come a time where we're our words are
[1:36:48] going to have to come out of our mouth
[1:36:49] and we're going to have to interact with
[1:36:50] an unbeliever rather than walk away from
[1:36:52] it I can't do it we've got to be able to
[1:36:56] do it we need to be able to do it I had
[1:36:59] another incident at work the other day
[1:37:00] and we were talking about something and
[1:37:02] I made a a witty joke that was pushing
[1:37:06] against this agenda that's out there
[1:37:08] these days and and there is nothing
[1:37:10] wrong with the joke in itself but it
[1:37:13] could be
[1:37:14] misconstrued by a certain
[1:37:17] group one of whom is my
[1:37:19] boss and I have that trouble sometimes
[1:37:21] my my mouth runs ahead of my discernment
[1:37:24] and as soon as I said it I was
[1:37:26] checked I was checked cuz everybody
[1:37:30] laughed she even
[1:37:32] laughed I think I wasn't facing her but
[1:37:36] I was checked and so I had a meeting W
[1:37:39] with my boss and I said I need to
[1:37:42] apologize for something I said I said
[1:37:45] such and such when when we were in the
[1:37:47] the meeting the other day and my boss
[1:37:48] said oh I don't even remember that but
[1:37:53] here's the Church she didn't know what
[1:37:54] to do with the
[1:37:56] apology because it didn't make anything
[1:37:58] she did hear it because when I said it
[1:38:00] she said I heard that but she'd
[1:38:02] forgotten it it was no big deal to her
[1:38:04] but here's now somebody apologizing to
[1:38:06] her for something that's no big deal to
[1:38:08] her why because it's on my conscience
[1:38:11] and so I made that right with her and I
[1:38:13] said I'll try not to to do that again
[1:38:16] because sometimes what we're looking at
[1:38:17] is is is we're trying to live that
[1:38:19] perfect life to be a witness and
[1:38:21] sometimes it's in the mistakes that we
[1:38:22] make that the Great witness
[1:38:24] comes amen when we can humble ourselves
[1:38:28] when we can apologize when we can put
[1:38:30] ourselves below the other person when we
[1:38:32] can even give up our rights at times for
[1:38:34] the sake of somebody else's
[1:38:38] benefit you know I remember brother Mark
[1:38:40] talking about this I hope you don't mind
[1:38:42] brother Mark he doesn't know what I'm
[1:38:43] going to say so he can't say yes or no
[1:38:45] but when he was when he was looking at
[1:38:47] at potentially leaving um uh newel or
[1:38:50] you know Bell align these things and
[1:38:52] they're looking to move him out or
[1:38:53] changed somebody's position and it was
[1:38:55] between he and another person and he
[1:38:57] said let her have it I've got what I
[1:39:00] need I can make it I can get another job
[1:39:02] if I have to she needs it more and so he
[1:39:04] said you can you can let her take this
[1:39:07] position and I'll step
[1:39:09] aside that's a greater testimony to many
[1:39:12] people than if you could quote them uh
[1:39:15] the entire
[1:39:16] scriptures because they see something
[1:39:18] there that no sane person would do which
[1:39:21] is give up gameful employment at a good
[1:39:29] company sometimes it's the fact that
[1:39:31] we'll make something right that wouldn't
[1:39:33] even twinge their
[1:39:35] conscience and they're like that's
[1:39:37] nothing why are you apologizing for that
[1:39:39] but it lets them know there's a higher
[1:39:41] plane there's a different life than the
[1:39:43] one that they're living especially if
[1:39:45] they're professing Christians especially
[1:39:47] if they're professing
[1:39:48] Christians but it's how we humble
[1:39:50] ourselves how we can do restitution or
[1:39:52] apology sometimes that is the greater
[1:39:54] witness than everything else we've done
[1:39:56] to that
[1:39:57] point why you know what that shows
[1:39:59] Church it shows we've overcome ourselves
[1:40:02] that's the victory that most people
[1:40:03] don't have is they haven't overcome
[1:40:05] themselves and when a Believer can
[1:40:07] humble themselves when they can put
[1:40:08] somebody else ahead of them that shows
[1:40:09] we've overcome ourselves there's no fear
[1:40:12] in our lives there's no worry about the
[1:40:14] outcome of these things but says this he
[1:40:16] says make the little housewife so sweet
[1:40:18] and humble that she'll be able to lead
[1:40:20] others to you
[1:40:24] simple
[1:40:25] life he says the gift that you give her
[1:40:29] that feminine little lady may she be so
[1:40:31] ladylike till the neighbors will see her
[1:40:33] and want to be like her church we need
[1:40:35] feminine women these days do we ever
[1:40:38] need real women real ladies real ladies
[1:40:42] that can be Christlike in their nature
[1:40:45] and not this forceful arrogant pushy
[1:40:50] bold amen God bless you sisters
[1:40:53] God bless you for the way that you can
[1:40:55] you know we've got the ones that are in
[1:40:57] the workforce the way that you can stay
[1:40:59] in your
[1:41:01] position and represent Christ to that
[1:41:03] entire
[1:41:05] workplace he says make the man the shop
[1:41:08] worker whoever he is Lord make him a
[1:41:10] humble life like Christ that others
[1:41:12] might
[1:41:14] see we'd rather walk in with great signs
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:18] wonders he says make him a humble life
[1:41:21] that others might see we don't know
[1:41:22] where those people people are standing
[1:41:24] out there father and we never want to
[1:41:25] leave the grandle highway he says we
[1:41:27] don't leave the word ever for anyone he
[1:41:30] says but we'll lean backwards we'll lean
[1:41:32] forward we'll reach out way out anywhere
[1:41:34] to get a soul he says put that within
[1:41:37] our reach Lord we pray and give us the
[1:41:40] life that would cause people to want to
[1:41:42] live like that as we consecrate
[1:41:44] ourselves to you tonight what's he
[1:41:46] saying we all have our place we all have
[1:41:48] a thing of uh to do in our lives and
[1:41:51] some of us are better talkers some of us
[1:41:52] are better listeners some of us are more
[1:41:54] empathetic and some of us are problem
[1:41:56] solvers we've all got something to bring
[1:41:58] to people and we approach people in
[1:42:00] situations differently but one thing
[1:42:02] that has to be constant is the Life of
[1:42:05] Christ amen we can approach and we can
[1:42:07] be different people but the Life of
[1:42:08] Christ is what matters in all of these
[1:42:10] things I don't care if you're a big
[1:42:12] talker or not a talker at all as long as
[1:42:14] I see the Life of Christ in you and
[1:42:16] guess what the world looks at it the
[1:42:17] same way everybody's talking everybody's
[1:42:20] got a podcast everybody's got a YouTube
[1:42:22] channel everybody's on Tik Tok
[1:42:24] everybody's on Instagram everybody's
[1:42:26] talking but how many are
[1:42:28] living it's amazing how often it seems
[1:42:30] like those that are professing to have
[1:42:32] something to offer to us usually fail in
[1:42:34] that exact
[1:42:36] area you know sometimes my wife will
[1:42:38] come to me and she'll say oh so and so
[1:42:39] is getting a divorce and it's this
[1:42:41] family on YouTube that had presented
[1:42:43] themselves as
[1:42:45] Perfection and what is it they got so
[1:42:47] caught up in Perfection that they lost
[1:42:48] the life they lost the purpose they lost
[1:42:51] the vision and people end up becoming
[1:42:52] self they get focused on something
[1:42:54] that's not family and the whole thing
[1:42:56] falls
[1:42:57] apart the world's wanting to see Christ
[1:43:00] not just here Amen brother B would make
[1:43:04] this statement and it brings us to the
[1:43:05] last portion of our message this morning
[1:43:07] he says but this is my Ministry to
[1:43:10] declare him that he's here and we know
[1:43:13] that he would constantly repeat Hebrews
[1:43:15] 13:8 and he would always remind us that
[1:43:18] God doesn't change and so when people
[1:43:19] say I literally share this with my wife
[1:43:21] I heard a a preacher from this this very
[1:43:23] month say God no longer sends Gifts of
[1:43:27] healing flat
[1:43:30] out and apparently he doesn't read Mark
[1:43:32] 16 he says that was only for that day
[1:43:36] God doesn't do it now God uses medicine
[1:43:38] and science he says and yes our prayers
[1:43:41] matter but God uses science to heal now
[1:43:44] what a shame what a
[1:43:47] shame you know what happened there is
[1:43:50] people pointed him to Mark 16 but you
[1:43:52] know what nobody said I've been
[1:43:55] healed that's the life we're talking
[1:43:58] about that's the life is that we've not
[1:44:00] just got a
[1:44:01] word but we've got a word amen we've got
[1:44:05] a body word we've got a Living Word
[1:44:06] we've got a spirit and a life inside of
[1:44:08] us that produces this word so that when
[1:44:10] somebody says oh you believe in Divine
[1:44:12] Healing yes I do
[1:44:14] because because I've got it because my
[1:44:17] wife has it because my daughter has it
[1:44:18] because my sons have it because people
[1:44:20] in my church have it where no doctor
[1:44:22] ever touch them yes God can use science
[1:44:25] yes God can use doctors yes God can use
[1:44:27] medicine but I've seen him where the
[1:44:29] almighty power of the Holy Spirit swept
[1:44:31] over somebody and they were completely
[1:44:32] healed completely
[1:44:35] healed so you can't tell me God doesn't
[1:44:37] heal but what a shame with that man that
[1:44:39] because he doesn't have it he says it
[1:44:41] doesn't exist the word says it and where
[1:44:44] where the word says it ought to be and
[1:44:45] we don't have it we need to say Lord I
[1:44:47] don't have it but I want it cuz your
[1:44:48] word says it's there it's there for me
[1:44:50] to have amen he says it's my Ministry to
[1:44:54] declare him what that he's here but
[1:44:57] where is the reality of Christ found it
[1:45:00] is not up in the
[1:45:02] atmosphere and I've talked about this so
[1:45:04] many times but Hebrews 13:7 is what
[1:45:07] produces Hebrews 138 the validation of
[1:45:10] Hebrews 138 is in Hebrews 13:7 I want to
[1:45:13] read it in the Amplified this morning it
[1:45:16] says remember your leaders and superiors
[1:45:18] in Authority for it was they who brought
[1:45:21] you the word of God he saying men of God
[1:45:23] came to you he says but observe
[1:45:27] attentively and consider their manner of
[1:45:29] living which means the outcome of their
[1:45:32] Wells spent lives you want to know if
[1:45:34] you should sit under a Ministry look at
[1:45:36] their past look at their
[1:45:38] present see what God has done in their
[1:45:41] life because if you don't see Christ
[1:45:43] there then what's coming over that
[1:45:44] Pulpit won't be Christ it'll be a man
[1:45:47] every single time look at their family
[1:45:50] look at their personal life see if
[1:45:51] Christ is reflected in all of it
[1:45:53] he says observe and consider their
[1:45:55] manner of living look at the outcome of
[1:45:57] their Wells spent lives and imitate
[1:45:59] their
[1:46:00] faith their conviction that God exists
[1:46:03] and is the Creator and ruler of all
[1:46:04] things and their leaning of the entire
[1:46:07] human personality on God in absolute
[1:46:11] trust and confidence in his power wisdom
[1:46:15] and
[1:46:16] goodness and what does that look like it
[1:46:18] looks like Hebrews 138 it's Jesus Christ
[1:46:21] the same yesterday today and
[1:46:24] forever that's what we're looking for is
[1:46:26] Christ revealed in us remember the
[1:46:28] revealing of God the mystery of God is
[1:46:30] in three phases or in three ways
[1:46:33] remember it was God the Father above us
[1:46:35] that's the Old Testament Jehovah and
[1:46:37] what was it it was God in the pillar of
[1:46:39] fire and the thing about that God was
[1:46:41] that he we could not go to him he could
[1:46:44] only come to
[1:46:45] us you'll see in the scriptures that the
[1:46:47] pillar of fire was always above the
[1:46:49] children of Israel and then in select
[1:46:51] times that Pillar of Fire that pillar of
[1:46:53] cloud would drop down in their midst to
[1:46:55] do something but then it would pull back
[1:46:57] up that was the first revealing of God
[1:47:00] in the father but now it comes down into
[1:47:02] Christ and now we've got a God that not
[1:47:04] only can come to us but we can go to him
[1:47:06] and we can touch him and we can feel him
[1:47:07] in these things what was it God poured
[1:47:09] everything he was into Christ and that
[1:47:12] was God revealed to us but remember
[1:47:14] there's a third phase there's a third
[1:47:16] revealing of that mystery and it's
[1:47:18] Christ in you and it's Christ in me
[1:47:19] because all that God was he poured into
[1:47:21] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[1:47:22] into the church when he poured it out on
[1:47:24] the day of Pentecost when that Pillar of
[1:47:26] Fire was separated out amongst the
[1:47:27] Believers and it kept separating and it
[1:47:29] kept filling all the way through what
[1:47:32] was it it's Christ revealed in each and
[1:47:33] every one of us amen we're down to where
[1:47:36] we live and that's the hardest thing for
[1:47:38] us to recognize that's the hardest thing
[1:47:39] for us to to to acknowledge is that it's
[1:47:42] Christ in me
[1:47:43] now in portion but no less Christ in
[1:47:48] me Paul would say this in Colossians he
[1:47:51] says to whom God would make no what is
[1:47:53] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:47:56] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:47:59] you Christ in you that's the mystery
[1:48:02] being revealed he says it's the hope of
[1:48:05] glory the mystery of God is now being
[1:48:08] revealed in a bride and it's in just
[1:48:10] little people little
[1:48:12] nobodies and the thing is will anybody
[1:48:14] recognize it they will by the lives that
[1:48:17] you live in the love for one
[1:48:19] another then Peter comes right behind us
[1:48:22] and he says but sanctify the Lord God in
[1:48:24] your hearts and be ready
[1:48:28] always every day be ready to go to to to
[1:48:31] what to answer to give an answer to
[1:48:34] every man that askthe a reason of the
[1:48:37] hope that is in you with meekness and
[1:48:40] fear if I were to break that down he
[1:48:42] says that asketh you a reason of Christ
[1:48:44] in you because the hope is Christ
[1:48:48] remember the scripture we read last
[1:48:49] before that was Christ in you the hope
[1:48:51] of glory so what they're saying is
[1:48:52] what's The Hope in you what is it that
[1:48:54] makes you the way you are why do you
[1:48:55] have a different attitude why do you
[1:48:56] differ a different life why do you speak
[1:48:58] things differently why do you hold back
[1:49:00] when we press forward and you say it's
[1:49:02] Christ in me it's Christ revealed in me
[1:49:05] it's a Living Hope amen we've got to be
[1:49:07] ready to answer Peter says be ready
[1:49:09] always be ready to give an answer for
[1:49:12] why you are the way you
[1:49:13] are if he says we've got to be ready
[1:49:15] it's because somebody's going to
[1:49:18] ask amen the question's going to come
[1:49:22] why do you do do that why don't you do
[1:49:24] that you're always going to church why
[1:49:27] do you dress like that your hair would
[1:49:29] look so much better when it's
[1:49:32] cut you don't wear
[1:49:35] makeup how come I never see you wearing
[1:49:38] shorts I notice you don't
[1:49:41] drink be ready to give an answer we
[1:49:44] ought to know why we live the lives we
[1:49:46] do and it ought not to be that I'm just
[1:49:49] a
[1:49:51] Christian if we're Christlike we got to
[1:49:53] have a word basis for what we're doing
[1:49:55] and what we're not doing as
[1:49:57] well we've got to be ready to step up
[1:50:00] and give an
[1:50:01] answer brother BR says that every jot
[1:50:04] every little jot everything he says You
[1:50:06] must be faithful in it's always the
[1:50:08] little fox that spoils the vine it's not
[1:50:10] the big things you do see our human
[1:50:12] nature is to focus on the big things
[1:50:13] we're doing he says it's the little
[1:50:16] things you leave
[1:50:17] undone remember a chain is only its
[1:50:20] strongest at its weakest link he says
[1:50:22] blessed are they that do all the
[1:50:23] Commandments of God that they might have
[1:50:24] a right to enter in do all that God
[1:50:28] said what does that do when we can live
[1:50:31] a life by the word it produces Christ
[1:50:34] and it brings him to those that are in
[1:50:35] need of him it's not something we're
[1:50:37] supposed to be holding back it's not
[1:50:39] something we're supposed to be hiding
[1:50:40] it's not something we're supposed to be
[1:50:42] Sheltering it's something we're supposed
[1:50:43] to be openly showing on our day-to-day
[1:50:45] lives
[1:50:46] amen sometimes it's the work is with the
[1:50:48] people in the church because we're part
[1:50:50] of a body but some sometimes it's with
[1:50:53] people outside of it because we're part
[1:50:54] of a kingdom amen we've got to see that
[1:50:57] it can't all be with Believers we've got
[1:51:00] to be able to interact with those that
[1:51:01] are outside of the Kingdom that need to
[1:51:02] come in we've got to be spirit-led
[1:51:06] amen your
[1:51:08] faithfulness May mean Deliverance for
[1:51:10] somebody tomorrow it might mean
[1:51:12] salvation it might mean sanity it might
[1:51:14] mean support it might mean help in a way
[1:51:17] that they can't get from anybody else it
[1:51:18] might be
[1:51:20] encouragement we don't know the effect
[1:51:23] we have so many times and we don't know
[1:51:26] what answer we're going to have to
[1:51:28] give but we ought to have an answer for
[1:51:31] why we live and where we're living at
[1:51:32] and why we want to do it I want to share
[1:51:34] this little story just as we start to
[1:51:36] close to what's possible with little
[1:51:38] people because simple Christians are all
[1:51:40] God needs you'll see in the scriptures
[1:51:43] it's not many mighty not many wise not
[1:51:46] many rich not many great it's just
[1:51:49] simple humble Believers that he's
[1:51:51] looking for we don't have to be Big
[1:51:53] Shots by no means do we have to do that
[1:51:56] but he's looking for sincere Believers
[1:51:58] he's looking for sincere Believers and
[1:51:59] these are the last two quotes before we
[1:52:01] close this
[1:52:02] morning he says brother chce one of our
[1:52:04] Brethren here Satan after him just
[1:52:06] recently he hit a culvert oh it just cut
[1:52:08] him up completely I don't see how he
[1:52:10] ever got out of it alive and so he was
[1:52:13] laying out there in the
[1:52:14] hospital church when somebody's laying
[1:52:17] in the hospital who do we
[1:52:19] call
[1:52:20] Ministry call the pastor call that that
[1:52:24] that that that man that's got a gift of
[1:52:25] faith call that man that's got a gift of
[1:52:26] laying on of hands of
[1:52:28] healing listen to this story he says and
[1:52:31] there was a little brother come in from
[1:52:33] New Albany named megf and this is what
[1:52:36] he said brother chce I'm not worthy to
[1:52:39] come pray for you he says but the Lord
[1:52:41] just put it on my heart so I couldn't
[1:52:44] help it he says and just come out and
[1:52:46] knelt down and said a little prayer and
[1:52:48] went out he says God healed brother chce
[1:52:52] right there
[1:52:55] see little
[1:52:58] things Little
[1:52:59] nudges Spirit Le people you can't fake
[1:53:04] it you can't pretend it it'll fall flat
[1:53:07] but if you're led by the spirit of God
[1:53:09] then something's going to happen it
[1:53:11] doesn't always happen immediately but
[1:53:13] it'll happen because what are you doing
[1:53:15] you're casting your word you're casting
[1:53:17] the bread upon the Water of the people
[1:53:19] he says see it's the gift of healing in
[1:53:22] a
[1:53:24] man no he says it's the gift of healing
[1:53:27] in the body of Christ you see one member
[1:53:29] to another don't think because you're
[1:53:32] just a lay member you're just as much a
[1:53:34] member as anybody else he says that's
[1:53:36] just as much my finger as this arm is my
[1:53:38] armor this ear is my ear see it's just a
[1:53:41] member of the body if one member suffers
[1:53:44] all members suffers with it he says it's
[1:53:47] a Unity how a blessed Unity God bless
[1:53:51] you let's Stand Together
[1:53:53] these days it just seems like I'm always
[1:53:57] looking for something to happen and I
[1:54:00] believe that's God working I believe
[1:54:02] that's God working in a pastor's heart I
[1:54:04] believe that's God giving me a pastor's
[1:54:06] heart but I don't just believe it's for
[1:54:08] me I I've shared the story how Selena
[1:54:10] one time she was at an appointment and
[1:54:12] she came home and she says I don't know
[1:54:14] what happened we just talked about the
[1:54:15] Lord for an hour and a half and I said I
[1:54:17] had prayed specifically for you this is
[1:54:18] not about me praying but I said I had
[1:54:20] prayed specifically that you would be a
[1:54:22] witness
[1:54:23] today this
[1:54:24] morning not that it would have to happen
[1:54:26] today but that it would make her witness
[1:54:28] because she's been so so good with with
[1:54:30] with dealing with the people that are
[1:54:31] working these different things and so I
[1:54:33] say Lord I believe there's a reason for
[1:54:34] it help her to be a witness and so each
[1:54:37] of us we come into these situations and
[1:54:39] we we're around people and we are
[1:54:41] different we are different and they see
[1:54:44] it and the question is can we be
[1:54:47] faithful and step up and share what is
[1:54:49] that makes us different not that every
[1:54:52] time we go out we want to tell somebody
[1:54:53] what's going on but to build up those
[1:54:55] relationships to build up those moments
[1:54:57] to a place where they've got the courage
[1:54:58] maybe to ask or where we've got the
[1:55:00] courage to tell but it starts with that
[1:55:03] morning by morning day by day saying
[1:55:06] Lord keep me in your will help me to
[1:55:09] open my mouth when I need to open it and
[1:55:11] help me to keep it quiet when it needs
[1:55:12] to be quiet and just simply say Lord
[1:55:15] would you use me Lord Make Me A Witness
[1:55:17] make me a testimony Lord help me to show
[1:55:20] your love you may never walk out outside
[1:55:22] of your house but your children are
[1:55:23] watching you every day your children are
[1:55:25] watching you every day how you spend
[1:55:27] your time what matters to you what
[1:55:29] doesn't matter to you these different
[1:55:30] things it's all these little things
[1:55:32] building up by faithfulness to help
[1:55:35] somebody else come to Christ amen why am
[1:55:38] I an expectation because I'm seeing God
[1:55:41] work I'm seeing God move I'm seeing God
[1:55:44] change situations I'm seeing God save to
[1:55:47] to to bring people to him and these
[1:55:48] different things and everyone out there
[1:55:50] we don't know which one it is
[1:55:52] we interact with so many people we don't
[1:55:54] know who's going to be in or out we may
[1:55:57] be it but we'll never stop working until
[1:56:00] we're gone because we don't know when
[1:56:01] the last one's going to come in brother
[1:56:04] Braham says the thing that's lacking he
[1:56:05] says is a desire for
[1:56:08] Souls God put Souls on our hearts we
[1:56:11] sing that song Lord lay some soul upon
[1:56:13] my heart and love that Soul through me
[1:56:16] and let me nobly do my part to win that
[1:56:19] soul for
[1:56:20] thee I pray God will help us to have a
[1:56:23] burden for Souls anden that in that
[1:56:25] faithful daytoday simple humble
[1:56:28] Victorious Christian Life we would say
[1:56:30] Lord keep me faithful blon and I were we
[1:56:32] walked into Costco the other day and she
[1:56:34] saw a sister that was dressed you know
[1:56:36] very very Holiness and so she went up to
[1:56:38] her and she she greeted her and she said
[1:56:41] you know it's lovely to see a woman
[1:56:43] dressed right and the lady said I know
[1:56:45] you we've watched some of your
[1:56:49] services don't know the lady from
[1:56:51] anybody but she knows us
[1:56:53] sister Betty was sharing with me of
[1:56:55] somebody that I've never even heard of
[1:56:57] that listens to us on a regular
[1:56:59] basis not a Bel not a message believer
[1:57:02] people are watching people are looking
[1:57:05] people are listening and we have no clue
[1:57:08] no clue how often the impact that we
[1:57:11] have and God will give us Grace in the
[1:57:13] eyes of the people and what happens too
[1:57:15] many times as we think that's just God
[1:57:16] giving me Grace he's giving you Grace so
[1:57:18] you can be a witness he's giving you
[1:57:20] Grace so you can be a testimony he's
[1:57:22] giving you Grace so you can have an
[1:57:23] impact that has Eternal value rather
[1:57:25] than just natural value amen God help us
[1:57:29] God help me is my prayer Lord Make Me A
[1:57:31] Witness day by day that I could be
[1:57:33] faithful that I could step up to the
[1:57:34] challenge that I'm ready to give an
[1:57:36] answer for the hope that lies within me
[1:57:38] amen let's bow our
[1:57:40] heads Heavenly
