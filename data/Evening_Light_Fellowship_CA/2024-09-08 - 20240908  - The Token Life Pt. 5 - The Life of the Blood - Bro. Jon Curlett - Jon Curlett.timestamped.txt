[21:49] know amen praise the
[21:52] Lord praise the Lord the the song just
[21:56] reminds me of a of a testimony I just
[21:58] heard this week from uh Adam called us
[22:02] you know from this church up there they
[22:04] were uh at a wedding in in Canmore uh
[22:09] which is over by B and on the way back
[22:13] there was a couple from brother Jerry's
[22:16] church that uh they had they were
[22:19] driving an old van and Adam said was
[22:21] just it was an old clunker so I guess
[22:23] they were just nursing it along and as
[22:27] they were in an area on the the highway
[22:29] where um where there was no uh Services
[22:33] really close like service stations and
[22:35] stuff they were kind of in a in a bleak
[22:37] area and um he said they they ended up
[22:42] with a fuel
[22:43] leak and uh a few leak on top of an
[22:47] exhaust leak is probably not a good
[22:50] combination and so there was smoke and a
[22:53] bit of fire started to come out of the
[22:55] vehicle so they got out and they had a
[22:57] fire extinguisher and they put out the
[22:59] fire so when they did while all that was
[23:01] happening traffic was just passing by
[23:03] nobody stopped they were all just
[23:05] passing by you know looking at the nice
[23:08] fire I guess and not not bothering but
[23:11] anyway um they were out wondering what
[23:13] to do they said now we got to call a tow
[23:15] truck and uh find a garage and probably
[23:19] have to stay in a hotel
[23:21] overnight and uh while they were
[23:25] figuring out what to do with the cars
[23:27] passing by one car
[23:29] stopped and uh man got out of the carent
[23:32] and came over and asked you know what do
[23:33] you need what can I do to help and he
[23:37] said uh he said well I I'm looking for
[23:39] one part he say not a big part one part
[23:42] would would stop my fuel leak and will
[23:45] get me on the
[23:46] road and uh he said
[23:50] U well my my daughter I said I got my
[23:53] four-year-old daughter in the car and he
[23:55] she said to him while they were driving
[23:58] towards towards the vehicle that was
[24:01] stopped he she said Daddy you got to
[24:03] stop and help those
[24:05] people and uh he that's that's why he
[24:09] stopped he felt he should stop when she
[24:11] said that so when the brother told the
[24:15] man what part he needed he needed he
[24:19] said oh I got that part in a cup in my
[24:21] car he went got it gave it to him and
[24:23] they went and and it just you know find
[24:26] this water in the desert you know this
[24:28] is this is the God we serve he looks
[24:31] after his own you know and it's just
[24:34] time and time again I I see testimonies
[24:36] of it and evidence of that not only in
[24:38] my own life but in the life of many
[24:40] others so uh you know I can only say God
[24:43] be praised you know you know
[24:47] so uh just thought get a blessing of it
[24:50] the brother's not part of our church but
[24:52] he's part of the body that same body and
[24:54] if somebody else is blessed then we're

[43:10] 1 verse 18 says for as much as you know
[43:13] that ye are not redeemed with
[43:14] corruptible things if we were redeemed
[43:17] with corruptible things our Redemption
[43:18] would be corruptible that was the
[43:21] problem he says as silver and gold from
[43:24] your vain conversation received by
[43:26] tradition from your fathers he says
[43:28] you're you're not redeemed from the
[43:29] religious Traditions you're not redeemed
[43:31] from the the the rights and the and the
[43:33] rituals of of religious Works they're
[43:35] not the answer he says you're not done
[43:37] that by natural or corruptible things he
[43:39] says but you are redeemed what with the
[43:42] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[43:45] without blemish and without spot amen
[43:48] God bless you you can have your seats
[43:49] this morning we're continuing our series
[43:51] on the holy ghost that we call the
[43:53] tolken life and last service we very
[43:55] much preached on the token portion and
[43:58] and we'll get to that in a moment and
[43:59] now we're coming to the life and so
[44:01] we're going to put together the token
[44:02] and we're going to put together the life
[44:04] to come up with the token life amen the
[44:06] the the title of the series and I think
[44:08] most of us that are older that have been
[44:10] well versed in the scriptures and and
[44:12] this end time message we know what I'm
[44:14] talking about but this is to build us up
[44:15] to a foundation because this series on
[44:17] the Holy Ghost is is is why do we need
[44:20] it and then what is it and then what
[44:21] does it do for us amen and so often what
[44:24] we do is we focus on get the Holy Ghost
[44:25] get the Holy Ghost but if you don't why
[44:27] you don't need it you don't know what
[44:28] it's going to do cuz it's got to take us
[44:30] from something and into something amen
[44:32] and so we've got to understand these
[44:33] things so you know the way I preach the
[44:35] way I minister is always to build us
[44:37] from the bottom up amen we want to jump
[44:39] to to third pull we want to jump to
[44:41] seventh seal but guess what you got to
[44:43] go through all the others before you get
[44:44] to those places we have to grow in
[44:46] Christ and so especially for our young
[44:48] people in particular but who knows who
[44:50] needs it this morning that we need to be
[44:51] built from the ground up it's a it's a
[44:53] progressive work it's a progressive
[44:55] revelation we can't just jump to to the
[44:57] end God always works for us through his
[44:58] word and it's all given for our
[45:00] admonition and our correction and our
[45:02] guidance and Leadership and these
[45:03] different things and so last service we
[45:05] spoke about the blood of the natural
[45:07] lamb a perfect lamb but natural
[45:09] nonetheless that was the token that
[45:10] spared the lives of the Israelites and
[45:12] it said and the blood shall be to you
[45:14] for a token upon the houses where you
[45:17] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[45:19] over you and the plague shall not be
[45:22] shall not be upon you to destroy you
[45:24] when I smite the land of Egypt and we
[45:26] spoke last service how the lamb could be
[45:28] sacrificed the lamb could be uh roasted
[45:30] they could eat it they could dress right
[45:32] they could do everything right but
[45:33] unless the token was applied they were
[45:35] going to die that night the firstborn
[45:37] was going to die of their house the
[45:39] firstborn was going to die of their
[45:40] animals because God was only looking for
[45:42] one thing and that was the token on
[45:44] their home amen so that's we know that
[45:47] the original token nonetheless it it did
[45:51] its job but it did not do the job that
[45:53] it needed to do because they walked out
[45:55] the next morning in Liberty but they
[45:57] were the same people that went in
[45:58] through that door and under that blood
[46:00] the night before it never changed the
[46:02] people when they left Egypt and they
[46:04] were free and they got all the blessings
[46:05] and all the good stuff that that went
[46:07] with them that blood it protected them
[46:09] it saved them it set them free but it
[46:11] did not change their nature it did not
[46:13] change their desires it did not change
[46:15] their thoughts nothing about them was
[46:17] changed that morning except maybe their
[46:19] emotions and so it was not the perfect
[46:21] token amen it didn't take away their
[46:23] temper it didn't take away their lust it
[46:24] didn't take away their family issues it
[46:26] didn't fix their their marriages but it
[46:28] let them go free from what they were
[46:29] under that that for for the 430 years
[46:32] previous amen it did the job that God
[46:34] needed to do it covered their sin but it
[46:37] did not address the root issue amen it
[46:39] was pointing to a time where the token
[46:43] the real token would come and it would
[46:44] fix the issue I mean that's what the
[46:46] token's supposed to do it's supposed to
[46:47] fix the underlying problem it's not
[46:49] supposed to cover it amen so it was
[46:51] pointing to the true thing and so it was
[46:53] only a type and Shadow and like
[46:55] everything from that time was only
[46:57] pointing to the real thing the true
[46:58] thing the the full thing that was going
[47:00] to be coming in the future and we saw
[47:03] that God had prepared a lamb to cover
[47:05] the sins of Adam and Eve in the garden
[47:06] and then Abel sacrificed the lamb and
[47:08] different people did it up to the time
[47:10] of Moses but when the when the the
[47:12] Passover comes when the time of going
[47:14] out comes that's when he says from here
[47:16] on now you got to sacrifice a lamb and
[47:19] every year you've got to come here and
[47:20] You' got to make an atonement for your
[47:22] sins an atonement means a covering he
[47:24] said every year your sins have to be
[47:26] covered otherwise I have to judge you
[47:29] and yet we look around this church and
[47:30] when's the last time we sacrificed the
[47:32] lamb when's the last time we went and we
[47:34] took the blood and put it over the
[47:36] doorpost of our house when's the last
[47:37] time we had bitter herbs and unleavened
[47:41] bread and and a roasted lamb in our
[47:42] house we don't do these things anymore
[47:44] why because the real token has come amen
[47:48] but there had to come a changing of
[47:49] these things and so we need to see why
[47:52] God chose the token as the blood in the
[47:55] first place cuz God didn't randomly pick
[47:56] an element God does all things perfectly
[47:59] he does it with purpose and we read how
[48:01] last service so the blood represented
[48:03] that the life had gone out from
[48:04] something it meant that the price had
[48:06] been paid it meant that there had been a
[48:07] death for a death it was a
[48:09] transformation where one person was
[48:11] supposed to die but the innocent took
[48:13] their death and then they were supposed
[48:14] to take the life of that animal that was
[48:17] innocent amen but God chose the blood he
[48:19] could have chosen the heart why didn't
[48:21] he choose the heart you can't live
[48:22] without a heart you can't live without
[48:25] your lungs you can't live without your
[48:26] brain you can't live without your liver
[48:28] he could have chosen all sorts of things
[48:30] but he chose the blood for a very
[48:32] particular reason and he explains it in
[48:34] Leviticus where he says whatsoever man
[48:37] there be of the House of Israel or of
[48:38] the strangers that sojourn among you
[48:40] that eateth any manner of blood I will
[48:43] even set my face against that soul that
[48:45] eateth blood and will cut him off from
[48:48] among his people for the life of the
[48:50] flesh is in the blood and I have given
[48:54] it to you upon the altar to make an
[48:57] atonement for your souls for it is the
[48:59] blood that maketh an atonement for the
[49:02] soul so that word atonement we said
[49:04] means a covering so it hid the issue it
[49:07] covered the issue but it did not fix the
[49:10] problem he says the the the the life of
[49:13] that blood is what's covering your life
[49:16] the life for the life the blood covers
[49:18] up the sins and so it's not just
[49:20] necessary for life it's it's not that
[49:22] just that blood's necessary for life
[49:24] it's that it carries life itself with in
[49:26] it and we see within the body that the
[49:29] blood is the life of the body we have
[49:31] all sorts of things we have a a system
[49:33] we have organs we have all these things
[49:35] working together but it's the blood that
[49:37] carries the oxygen and the nutrients to
[49:40] what is needed and then it's also what
[49:42] carries away much of what is not it
[49:44] brings in the oxygen takes out the
[49:45] carbon dioxide to the lungs and these
[49:47] different things it's the transportation
[49:49] method for life within a body and
[49:51] nothing else in the body has that
[49:53] capability the brain controls the body
[49:56] the heart pumps the blood the lungs add
[49:58] and remove oxygen and and carbon dioxide
[50:00] and these things our lungs make it
[50:02] happen but the blood is the key to it
[50:04] all take the blood out and the body
[50:05] doesn't work it's dead why the life is
[50:08] in the blood you can be brain dead and
[50:10] still be
[50:11] alive but without the blood everything
[50:14] just goes apart
[50:18] amen so we see here why it's the blood
[50:21] and he says therefore I said unto the
[50:23] children of Israel no soul of you shall
[50:25] eat blood neither shall any stranger
[50:27] that sojourneth among you eat blood now
[50:30] it's an odd thing to say because if
[50:32] there's Life In The Blood you naturally
[50:34] think well maybe I ought to eat blood
[50:35] maybe ought to drink blood and we see in
[50:37] the old times that they thought that
[50:38] they thought that if they would drink
[50:40] the blood of an animal they kill an
[50:42] animal that was ferocious or fast or
[50:44] very strong and they would take it not
[50:46] the Israelites of course but the pagans
[50:48] would do it those that didn't know God
[50:49] and they would take that blood and they
[50:50] would drink it because what they believe
[50:53] was that the attributes of what they had
[50:55] killed would come into them if they
[50:57] drank its blood and God says you can't
[50:59] be like the pagans because it doesn't
[51:01] work in fact if you drink blood at at
[51:03] best it'll make you uncomfortable at
[51:05] worst it can kill you so you're not
[51:08] supposed to do it but they they believe
[51:10] that if you could take it into you if
[51:11] you could drink the blood of what it was
[51:13] that you killed then you could get what
[51:15] that animal or what that person even had
[51:17] some of them would even drink human
[51:19] blood because if they killed a great
[51:21] warrior they wanted his strength they
[51:22] wanted his ferocity they wanted his
[51:24] speed whatever it might be and so they
[51:26] drank it God says you can't be that way
[51:28] because it won't work it can't work the
[51:31] life is in the blood but it doesn't
[51:32] transfer to you the way that way and so
[51:34] God says don't do it if you do it I'll
[51:36] cut you off I'll cut you off from them
[51:39] but here's the thing the greater truth
[51:41] is that what they thought it would do
[51:43] was exactly what God was going to
[51:46] do because he says you can't take the
[51:48] blood because nothing good will come out
[51:50] of it but there's coming a day where
[51:52] you'll take my blood and it'll do
[51:54] exactly what you're thinking that this
[51:55] Blood you're taking today will do for
[51:57] you it was pointing to the real thing
[51:58] and he says you can't have the real
[52:00] thing until the real thing comes amen so
[52:03] the intention of the blood sacrifice was
[52:05] to do exactly what they thought the
[52:07] blood was supposed to do which was
[52:08] transfer the life put the nature back in
[52:11] the person that was under that sacrifice
[52:13] but that's not what it was going to do
[52:15] the pagans believed it but it would
[52:17] never work that way but see God didn't
[52:19] want to just cover sin God wanted to
[52:21] eradicate it God wanted to erase it God
[52:23] didn't just want to take it away God
[52:24] wanted to take care of the very root of
[52:27] that problem because the blood was just
[52:29] covering the sin but it was a debt that
[52:31] was building and building and building
[52:33] and so the mound was getting bigger and
[52:34] bigger if you've ever been stuck in
[52:36] credit
[52:37] cards you ever look at your balance and
[52:39] they're you're paying
[52:41] 19.99% and every month you look and even
[52:44] if you don't do anything wrong the debt
[52:46] is building because there's interest
[52:48] building up on it and it's the same with
[52:50] Humanity they were building and building
[52:51] and building and all it was happening
[52:53] was the blood was covering and the blood
[52:55] was covering but the mound was get
[52:56] getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[52:58] until there was no way that we could
[52:59] ever pay there was no way we could pay
[53:00] it in the first place but there was
[53:02] definitely no way we could pay it after
[53:04] that so the purpose of that lamb that
[53:07] was sacrificed was to take my sins my
[53:10] mistakes my fault on himself and it
[53:12] would become sinful in my place that
[53:15] perfect lamb that sinless spotless lamb
[53:17] would become imperfect and its
[53:19] Perfection was supposed to come to me
[53:22] and yet time and time again they go
[53:24] through the Passover they'd sacrifice
[53:26] the lamb and then they would come out
[53:28] and they would be exactly the same
[53:29] person that they went in why it was only
[53:31] a symbol it was only a type it was only
[53:33] a shadow of what was supposed to happen
[53:36] why because animal life and human life
[53:38] are
[53:39] incompatible I can't take Lamb's blood
[53:41] and put it in me a lamb does not live
[53:44] the way that I live a lamb is perfect
[53:46] and innocent because it doesn't know
[53:48] evil it has no soul it has no
[53:50] understanding of right and wrong it is
[53:52] perfect because it has no understanding
[53:54] of sin it doesn't make any choices in
[53:56] the first place it doesn't have a
[53:57] conscience it can only react in the
[53:59] moment based on its instincts and it's
[54:01] never wrong a lamb is never wrong
[54:02] because it doesn't have to make a choice
[54:05] amen so therefore its life can't come
[54:08] into me because it's living in a
[54:09] completely different sphere of reality
[54:11] it has no soul it has no choice it has
[54:14] no understanding so God says don't drink
[54:16] the blood don't touch the blood don't
[54:17] ever take it into you because there's
[54:19] going to come a time where the perfect
[54:20] work will come God was requiring a
[54:23] perfect blood from a lamb that was
[54:25] compatible with my life and your life to
[54:29] do a finished work amen now I know this
[54:31] is basic this morning and I'm sure that
[54:33] we understand this but again we're
[54:34] building to what the Holy Ghost does to
[54:37] what it means to be a born again
[54:38] believer and we have to understand why
[54:40] we need it so we can understand what
[54:42] it's going to do when we get it because
[54:43] otherwise what happens is we come into
[54:45] church and we have a religious
[54:46] experience and we think I've got the
[54:48] Holy Ghost no no no no no you just have
[54:50] your conscience eased many
[54:53] times but your desires are still the
[54:55] same your nature is still the same your
[54:57] life is still the same so you can't have
[55:00] been under the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:01] because that's not the way it works
[55:02] that's the way the blood of the natural
[55:04] lamb works but the perfect lamb does a
[55:06] different thing cuz blood alone won't do
[55:08] the work blood alone won't do the work
[55:11] the blood covers but it does not change
[55:13] right what you you you have to get
[55:15] what's in the blood to change you to
[55:17] take care of the root problem that's why
[55:19] we're talking about the life of the
[55:21] blood this morning you know to a to a
[55:23] Believer the effect of the payment of
[55:25] sin and the covering of sin is no
[55:27] different you don't know any difference
[55:29] whether it's paid or whether it's
[55:30] covered the fact is you're still you so
[55:33] whether it's paid or whether it's just
[55:35] covered up you still walk along the same
[55:37] person you always were and so all it
[55:39] does is it keeps the Judgment of God off
[55:41] you but it's not doing anything for you
[55:42] personally except holding back his wrath
[55:44] in our life amen we're not looking to
[55:46] just sit here and be the same people I
[55:48] hope this morning amen I want to
[55:49] overcoming power amen I want something
[55:52] that changes my nature I want something
[55:54] that changes my my life something that
[55:56] changes the way I think something that
[55:57] changes the way I react something that
[55:59] changes my marriage something that
[56:01] changes how I spend my time every day I
[56:04] want something that takes me from what I
[56:06] was into what I'm supposed to be amen he
[56:10] continues here and he says and I won't
[56:12] read the whole thing for the sake of
[56:14] time this morning but at the end he says
[56:16] for the life of All Flesh is in the
[56:17] blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall
[56:20] be cut off that word cut off there the
[56:22] imagery the word there literally means
[56:23] the cutting off of a limb in other words
[56:26] you'll be separated from the body you'll
[56:28] be taken away from the body of Believers
[56:30] and in those days if they did it they
[56:32] would take them outside the camp and
[56:33] they would kill them and they had no
[56:35] part in the people and they had no part
[56:37] of God and they were eternally separated
[56:39] from God because they drank the blood
[56:40] that they weren't supposed
[56:42] to that's
[56:44] severe God didn't mess around in those
[56:46] days it was the law it was not Grace and
[56:49] so when you transgress then you paid a
[56:50] harsh price but now we come forward to
[56:53] the book of Hebrews and Paul is talking
[56:55] in the Old Testament about everything
[56:57] that happened under the law and
[56:58] everything that happened under the blood
[56:59] of lambs and bulls and goats and these
[57:02] things and he says now when these things
[57:04] were thus ordained in other words when
[57:05] God brought these into into our lives he
[57:08] says the priest went always into the
[57:11] first Tabernacle accomplishing the
[57:13] service of God but into the second went
[57:16] the high priest alone once every year
[57:19] not without blood so always with blood
[57:23] the high priest came in once a year with
[57:25] blood which he offered for himself so
[57:28] remember he went in first with blood of
[57:30] the lamb and it was there and it was put
[57:32] upon The Mercy Seat the the the shakina
[57:35] glory the holy of holies was there God
[57:37] was in there and that man walked in with
[57:39] blood in front of him and if he did not
[57:41] die it meant that God had covered his
[57:44] accepted the blood of the lamb in his
[57:45] hands or or the the bulls and goats
[57:47] whatever it was and and he accepted that
[57:49] man and then that man went out and he
[57:51] got more blood and he came in and he
[57:52] said now this is for the people and then
[57:55] God would accept that their their sins
[57:57] would be covered for the entire year
[57:59] amen but to walk in without blood was to
[58:01] die if that man walked in it didn't
[58:03] matter how clean he was how well he
[58:05] washed behind his ears that morning how
[58:07] right his clothes were how much of a
[58:09] priest he was how much of a right he had
[58:11] to be there he had to go in with blood
[58:14] he always had to go in with blood it
[58:16] says but into the second went the high
[58:19] priest okay we cover that the Holy Ghost
[58:21] this signifying that the way into the
[58:24] holiest of all was not yet made manifest
[58:26] while as the first Tabernacle was yet
[58:28] standing so in other words they couldn't
[58:30] really come into the presence of God the
[58:32] way that he intended or desired it was
[58:34] only a shadow it was only pointing to
[58:37] something that wasn't yet in existence
[58:39] and in the Amplified it says by this the
[58:41] Holy Spirit points out that the way into
[58:44] the true holy of holies is not yet
[58:46] thrown open as long as the former or the
[58:49] outer portion of the Tabernacle remains
[58:52] a recognized institution Still Standing
[58:53] so he says as long as there's sacrifice
[58:55] as as long as there's a priesthood as
[58:57] long as there's a high priest as long as
[58:59] there's a holy of holies that's veiled
[59:01] God has not moved on to the second stage
[59:03] of what he really wants us to do as long
[59:05] as that's still standing God ain't going
[59:06] to move into anything else there has to
[59:08] be a Breaking of it there has to be a
[59:09] destroying of it there has to be a
[59:11] tearing of it so as long as the rights
[59:13] and rituals of animal sacrificed and
[59:16] Temple worship were there the intended
[59:18] means of getting into the presence of
[59:19] God was not there the perfect way of
[59:21] getting into the presence of God was not
[59:23] there it was only there a little bit
[59:25] amen everyone had to be under the blood
[59:27] to possibly get into his presence and
[59:31] then out of all the posses one man per
[59:34] year got to go into his presence and
[59:36] that was
[59:37] it so you're you're a part of the family
[59:40] of God and only one person gets to go
[59:42] into the literal presence of God once a
[59:44] year God didn't want that we see in the
[59:46] Garden of Eden he came down the cool of
[59:48] e of the evening and he walked with Adam
[59:50] and Eve day by day God was looking for
[59:52] constant relationship and yet under the
[59:54] blood of of of natural perfect animals
[59:57] only one person could come in once per
[59:59] year and that was it God's trying to
[1:00:01] redeem us back to something more than
[1:00:03] once a year let me say it this way
[1:00:05] church if we're only seeing him once a
[1:00:07] year if we're only seeing him once a
[1:00:09] week if we're only seeing him twice a
[1:00:11] week when we go to church there's a
[1:00:13] problem with our Redemption because he's
[1:00:15] Made A Way Beyond that amen Way Beyond
[1:00:19] that it says which was a figure for the
[1:00:22] time then present in which they were
[1:00:24] offered both gifts and sacrific says but
[1:00:27] watch this he says that could not make
[1:00:30] him that did the service perfect as
[1:00:34] pertaining to the conscience so in other
[1:00:36] words even the priests as holy and as
[1:00:39] consecrated and as Sanctified as they
[1:00:41] were when they came into this the blood
[1:00:43] that they brought in the sacrifices they
[1:00:45] made could not make them
[1:00:48] perfect it couldn't ease their
[1:00:51] conscience they knew what they did they
[1:00:53] knew what they were they knew the way
[1:00:55] they thought and they went in and they
[1:00:57] knew when they went out they were no
[1:00:58] different than they went in and that
[1:01:01] word perfect we hear that word perfect
[1:01:03] and we always think
[1:01:05] spotless but it doesn't that word
[1:01:07] perfect means finishing a course or race
[1:01:11] to reach the end in other words going
[1:01:13] into the presence of God once a year
[1:01:15] with the blood of a natural animal could
[1:01:17] never finish the work that God intended
[1:01:19] in their
[1:01:21] life we think getting into his presence
[1:01:23] we got to get into his presence more
[1:01:25] than once a day more than once a week
[1:01:27] Church we've got to get into his
[1:01:28] presence regularly he's the Tree of Life
[1:01:30] Christ is the tree of life amen we've
[1:01:32] got to be feasting on him every single
[1:01:34] day so in other words all the forms all
[1:01:36] the rituals all the signing your name on
[1:01:38] a book all the church attendance could
[1:01:41] never make us
[1:01:43] perfect
[1:01:45] amen it said and it which stood only or
[1:01:48] it consisted only of meats and drinks
[1:01:50] and diverse different Washings and
[1:01:52] carnal fleshly or human ordinances
[1:01:55] imposed on them until the time of restor
[1:01:59] of reformations so in other words it was
[1:02:01] dos and don'ts and you had no other
[1:02:03] choice but to do it otherwise you
[1:02:05] died it was legal it was the law it was
[1:02:09] a must it wasn't optional but you see
[1:02:12] there it says until the time of
[1:02:14] reformation and that word Reformation
[1:02:16] there in the original it means to
[1:02:18] restore to its natural and normal
[1:02:21] condition something which in some way
[1:02:24] protrudes or has got got out of line
[1:02:27] comparable to a broken limb that needs
[1:02:29] to be set in place so in other words the
[1:02:31] laws and the rituals and the religion
[1:02:33] and the church attendance was just a
[1:02:36] Band-Aid on a broken
[1:02:38] arm the arm was still broken but it
[1:02:42] wasn't causing them to die it was
[1:02:44] keeping death at Bay but it was not
[1:02:47] fixing the broken arm and yet it's
[1:02:50] amazing that under these sacrifice
[1:02:52] Christ comes and they all think they're
[1:02:54] perfect the churchgoers think they're
[1:02:57] perfect the ministry thinks they're
[1:02:59] perfect the Mi the the priesthood thinks
[1:03:01] they're perfect they studied all the
[1:03:02] books of Moses and they were so assured
[1:03:05] in what they were doing that they were
[1:03:06] tithing even their mint and cumin they
[1:03:09] take a piece of mint I don't even know
[1:03:10] what a piece of mint looks like this big
[1:03:12] and they cut off a tenth of it and they
[1:03:13] bring it into the
[1:03:14] temple that's how exacting they were and
[1:03:17] then when Christ comes he's the word
[1:03:19] made flesh he's the perfect lamb come
[1:03:21] for them and they sing they don't need
[1:03:23] him to fix them they need him to affirm
[1:03:25] them
[1:03:26] that's the response they had tell me I'm
[1:03:28] doing good tell me I'm doing good and he
[1:03:30] says no you're not that's not going to
[1:03:33] get you there he said not only that but
[1:03:35] you neglect the weightier matters of the
[1:03:37] law you got no mercy you got no Grace
[1:03:40] you have no no feeling for the needs of
[1:03:41] the people it's just you you you you
[1:03:47] you so many times we can come into
[1:03:50] church expecting a pat on the
[1:03:52] back this is a house of correction
[1:03:55] correct doesn't mean to spank you or
[1:03:58] beat you it means to show you the way of
[1:04:01] truth and you choose or you turn it down
[1:04:04] and it's up to you that's what
[1:04:05] correction means and then if you're a
[1:04:07] child of God he'll get into discipline
[1:04:08] later which is he'll give you a he'll
[1:04:10] give you a supernatural spanking if we
[1:04:12] have need of these things amen but Paul
[1:04:14] was pointing back to these things and he
[1:04:16] says they were only there to hold you
[1:04:18] they were just holding back the wrath of
[1:04:19] God they were holding back the Judgment
[1:04:21] of God they were giving you something to
[1:04:23] do until he would do what you could
[1:04:24] never do
[1:04:27] amen what he was trying to fix the
[1:04:29] problems and so all the acts of the
[1:04:32] Jewish faith were just Band-Aids they're
[1:04:34] holding people until Christ could come
[1:04:36] and do what really needed to be done now
[1:04:38] listen to this quote it says and the
[1:04:39] life laying in this blood cell The
[1:04:41] Sinner being guilty of sin the most
[1:04:43] innocent that he could offer would be
[1:04:45] the life of this lamb now the reason
[1:04:47] that it typed the coming of the real
[1:04:49] Lamb of God and could not take away sin
[1:04:51] It could only cover sin because the life
[1:04:54] that was in the blood after it was
[1:04:56] broken could not return upon the
[1:04:59] worshipper he says because the
[1:05:01] worshipper was a human with a soul and
[1:05:03] the life that went from the animal was
[1:05:05] merely the life of a beast and the life
[1:05:08] of a beast could not coincide with the
[1:05:10] life of a man so therefore the
[1:05:12] worshipper went out with the same
[1:05:13] conscience the same desire to sin as he
[1:05:17] did coming in can you imagine the
[1:05:22] frustration there were days I I believe
[1:05:25] when Saul dedicated the temple I think
[1:05:27] they did something like 20,000 animals
[1:05:29] over that
[1:05:31] dedication and yet after that was all
[1:05:33] said and done every single worshipper
[1:05:36] walked out the same way they came
[1:05:38] in all that life all that blood all that
[1:05:43] sacrifice all that innocence and it did
[1:05:44] nothing except cover the Judgment cover
[1:05:47] the sins to keep the Judgment of God
[1:05:49] away from
[1:05:50] them but now I want us to to move
[1:05:53] forward this morning because we know
[1:05:55] that Jesus comes along and he's the
[1:05:56] perfect Lamb of God and we'll show that
[1:05:58] shortly but I want you to see what Jesus
[1:06:00] tells the people to do because we he's
[1:06:02] been we we've been told already in
[1:06:04] Leviticus you definitely don't drink the
[1:06:05] blood but I want you to see what happens
[1:06:08] now when Jesus comes and this is near
[1:06:09] the end of Jesus
[1:06:11] ministry okay and what he's doing is
[1:06:13] he's bringing them into what he really
[1:06:15] wanted for them what he really came to
[1:06:17] do because before this it's signs and
[1:06:20] wonders and healings and all these
[1:06:21] things but now he's coming to fixing
[1:06:24] them
[1:06:25] he'd heal them one day and guess what
[1:06:27] the next week they'd get sick he'd
[1:06:29] deliver them one day and they could go
[1:06:31] out the next week and get another demon
[1:06:32] in them why because they weren't living
[1:06:35] under a
[1:06:36] fix it was just a covering and Jesus is
[1:06:39] talking with them and he says verily
[1:06:41] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[1:06:43] on me has everlasting life and the
[1:06:45] nominal Christian world will say see
[1:06:47] that's how you get salvation believe on
[1:06:49] Christ but watch how he continues he
[1:06:52] saysi am that bread of life and they've
[1:06:56] been talking about the Mana in the
[1:06:57] wilderness and he's talking about the
[1:06:58] Mana which is the Heavenly bread but
[1:07:01] even the Heavenly bread wasn't enough
[1:07:02] Church they ate Angels food for 40 years
[1:07:05] in the desert and only two of them made
[1:07:07] it into the Canaan land the Passover
[1:07:10] required unleavened bread and Jesus is
[1:07:11] saying I'm that unleavened bread I'm
[1:07:13] that pure word he says your fathers did
[1:07:15] eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead
[1:07:18] what's Jesus trying to do he's saying
[1:07:19] your religious experience is not eternal
[1:07:22] life your dos and your don'ts are not
[1:07:24] eternal life your family heritage and
[1:07:27] their Christianity is not eternal life
[1:07:29] he's trying to get them out of their
[1:07:31] comfort zone so they can come to a place
[1:07:33] where they can receive what they really
[1:07:34] need he's trying to break the feathers
[1:07:36] of their own religious
[1:07:38] nature he says this is the bread which
[1:07:41] cometh down from heaven that a man may
[1:07:43] eat thereof and not die he says I am the
[1:07:47] living bread which came down from heaven
[1:07:49] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:07:51] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:07:54] give is my flesh
[1:07:55] which I will give for the life of the
[1:07:58] world so Jesus is describing himself as
[1:08:00] the bread of life and he's saying you
[1:08:02] have to eat me to receive life and he's
[1:08:06] drawing parallels to the Mana that came
[1:08:08] down from heaven in the desert he's
[1:08:09] drawing parallels to the Passover me as
[1:08:11] well but watch what happens when he says
[1:08:13] this because it's all been good till now
[1:08:16] it says and the Jews there therefore
[1:08:18] strove among themselves saying how can
[1:08:20] this man give his flesh to
[1:08:21] eat then Jesus said unto them see what
[1:08:25] he said was already hard enough he says
[1:08:27] verily verily I say unto you except ye
[1:08:29] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:08:32] drink his blood ye have no life in you
[1:08:36] so he's already said you got to eat my
[1:08:37] flesh now he says drink my blood can you
[1:08:40] imagine their faces when he said this
[1:08:42] one they're not allowed to drink blood
[1:08:43] of an animal now he's saying drink the
[1:08:45] blood out of a human they they look at
[1:08:47] this as a pagan ritual and he's saying
[1:08:50] unless you do this what you have no life
[1:08:56] the life is in the blood and he says
[1:08:57] unless you drink my blood you don't have
[1:08:59] any life he's saying the law is about to
[1:09:02] be fulfilled and when that's done
[1:09:04] there's going to come something greater
[1:09:06] than the law and it's going to come
[1:09:08] through me and you better be ready for
[1:09:09] it what's he talking about he's talking
[1:09:11] about the life of the blood he's not
[1:09:14] just talking about his blood but he's
[1:09:15] talking about the life of the blood it
[1:09:16] couldn't come from a natural lamb but
[1:09:18] now he's the perfect Lamb of God and
[1:09:20] he's saying this is the only blood you
[1:09:22] can ever drink because it's the only one
[1:09:24] compatible with who and what you
[1:09:26] are this is the only blood that'll make
[1:09:29] a difference this is the only life
[1:09:30] that'll make a difference You' got to
[1:09:32] part partake of me because I am the life
[1:09:34] that you
[1:09:36] need what kind of Life verse 54 says who
[1:09:39] so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:09:42] have eternal life and I will raise him
[1:09:45] up at the last day for my flesh is meat
[1:09:47] indeed and my blood is drink indeed that
[1:09:49] word indeed means it's real it's the
[1:09:52] real deal it's the true thing it's real
[1:09:54] food it's real drink it'll do real work
[1:09:56] it'll do what nothing else would do
[1:09:58] before it's a complete working food if
[1:10:00] you'll take every part of
[1:10:02] me and then he doubles down
[1:10:05] again I guarantee this was a shocking
[1:10:09] sermon he says he that eateth my flesh
[1:10:13] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[1:10:15] I in him what's he saying this is a
[1:10:18] restoration of
[1:10:19] relationship you could only come in once
[1:10:21] a year one person a year you do this and
[1:10:23] anybody can come to God
[1:10:26] he's opening way he says as the living
[1:10:28] father has sent me and I live by the
[1:10:30] father so he that eateth me even he
[1:10:33] shall live by me this is that bread
[1:10:35] which came down from heaven not as your
[1:10:37] fathers did eat mana and are dead but he
[1:10:40] that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:10:43] forever and then he never explained
[1:10:46] it see normally when Jesus said
[1:10:48] something like this he'd at least go to
[1:10:50] his disciples on the side and he'd say
[1:10:52] here's what I meant but here he doesn't
[1:10:54] explain any of it he just leaves it out
[1:10:57] there he just floats it out there he
[1:10:58] didn't say you know this is a tough one
[1:11:00] just trust me I I'll tell you later
[1:11:02] don't don't say anything don't walk away
[1:11:04] I'll tell you guys later what this means
[1:11:06] he doesn't do anything he just puts it
[1:11:07] out there and then he shuts
[1:11:10] up and at the same time he says this is
[1:11:13] the only way to eternal life so he makes
[1:11:17] it another absolute he makes it another
[1:11:19] requirement it used to be the law of
[1:11:21] blood of the blood of lambs and bulls
[1:11:23] and goats now he says no you got to eat
[1:11:24] my flesh and drink my blood otherwise
[1:11:26] you have no eternal life you have no
[1:11:28] access to eternal life except this and
[1:11:30] he doesn't explain
[1:11:31] it they were banking on their religious
[1:11:33] Works they were banking on their family
[1:11:35] heritage they were banking on being a
[1:11:37] priest but here's the thing did Jesus
[1:11:39] ever make them eat his flesh and drink
[1:11:41] his
[1:11:42] blood no of course not he was hiding his
[1:11:46] purpose yet speaking the truth in symbol
[1:11:49] form but he never explained it much of
[1:11:52] the script scripture is in symbol form
[1:11:54] and people want to interpret literally
[1:11:56] every single time and it leads them down
[1:11:57] past that are nowhere good why because
[1:12:00] they don't stick around long enough to
[1:12:01] get the revelation of what God's really
[1:12:03] talking about now I know there are
[1:12:05] people listening to me this morning that
[1:12:07] aren't in this service that aren't
[1:12:08] attending and I want to even speak to
[1:12:10] them this morning don't throw out what
[1:12:12] you hear just because you haven't heard
[1:12:14] it
[1:12:15] before amen don't throw out what you
[1:12:17] hear because the mainstream preachers
[1:12:19] and churches aren't preaching it you
[1:12:21] know what mainstream is mainstream is
[1:12:24] kabad
[1:12:26] the glory of the Lord has departed
[1:12:28] because mainstream is no longer gospel
[1:12:30] it was never gospel the gospel Jesus
[1:12:33] said narrow is the way and few there be
[1:12:35] that find it mainstream is never the way
[1:12:37] to Calvary mainstream is never the way
[1:12:39] to eternal life mainstream is not the
[1:12:41] way to a resurrection and a Rapture amen
[1:12:44] God is not in it he'll never be in it
[1:12:46] why because mainstream lets you be
[1:12:48] comfortable with where you're at it does
[1:12:51] not require you to go all the way with
[1:12:53] God it does not require you to go all
[1:12:55] way with the word of God listen there
[1:12:57] are people that have left things and
[1:12:59] then they'll come in and they'll listen
[1:13:00] and they'll go away because it doesn't
[1:13:02] match what they heard but yet they left
[1:13:04] what they heard before because it wasn't
[1:13:06] satisfying them then to come to
[1:13:07] something different and say well it
[1:13:08] doesn't match what I've heard therefore
[1:13:09] it can't be right no stay there a while
[1:13:13] if you don't understand something lay it
[1:13:14] on the shelf and just say Lord I'm not
[1:13:17] sure I like what I'm seeing but I don't
[1:13:20] understand the words and just lay it
[1:13:21] there listen I don't everything that I
[1:13:23] understand today I did not understand
[1:13:25] stand 5 and 10 years ago I grow in
[1:13:27] Revelation I grow in in my understanding
[1:13:30] of the word and the ways of God and so
[1:13:32] we've got to be able to put something on
[1:13:34] the shelf and just say Lord I'm going to
[1:13:35] leave it with you and let you show it to
[1:13:37] me by your word through your holy spirit
[1:13:41] amen the the the pure word is never
[1:13:44] popular it is never common it is rarely
[1:13:48] found and it's very few people that go
[1:13:51] all the way with it amen and it's a
[1:13:53] people that want to be right with God
[1:13:55] rather than just be right
[1:14:00] amen what was Jesus meaning when he said
[1:14:03] you must drink my
[1:14:05] blood why do you drink blood to get the
[1:14:07] life from it that's what they always
[1:14:08] thought he didn't mean drink my blood
[1:14:10] but he said you got to get the life of
[1:14:12] my blood that's what he was talking
[1:14:13] about there's a life that's coming out
[1:14:15] of that blood and when that happens when
[1:14:17] I sacrifice my life for your sins that
[1:14:19] blood will actually do what the blood of
[1:14:21] bulls and goats and Lambs never could
[1:14:23] and it can come into you and it can
[1:14:24] change you from the inside out it'll
[1:14:26] change you back into what you were
[1:14:28] supposed to be in the original condition
[1:14:30] amen but he never explained it he just
[1:14:33] said it and then he let it sit there
[1:14:35] what was he doing church he was testing
[1:14:37] their revelation of who he was that's it
[1:14:40] they'd seen the Loaves and Fishes get
[1:14:42] multiplied they'd seen the sick healed
[1:14:43] they'd seen the demons cast out they'd
[1:14:45] seen him walk on water they'd seen him
[1:14:47] do all sorts of Mighty Miracles and then
[1:14:49] he says something they don't understand
[1:14:51] and he's saying do you really believe
[1:14:52] who I am
[1:14:57] time and time again Jesus before would
[1:14:59] say something mysterious and explain it
[1:15:01] but now he's coming to the opening of
[1:15:03] the word he's coming to the
[1:15:05] gospel and he's saying will you turn
[1:15:07] this
[1:15:08] corner will you turn this corner and
[1:15:11] catch what
[1:15:13] happens we're skipping a couple verses
[1:15:15] because they're they're all talking
[1:15:16] amongst themselves how's he going to do
[1:15:17] this what is this it says when Jesus
[1:15:20] knew in himself that his disciples
[1:15:22] murmured of it he said unto them does
[1:15:24] this offend you Church notice now he's
[1:15:27] not addressing the
[1:15:28] priesthood now he's talking to people
[1:15:31] right in his church his disciples his
[1:15:34] congregation CU remember there's the 70
[1:15:37] and then there's the 12 he had
[1:15:40] 82 so now what does he do Church does he
[1:15:43] say now guys no what does he do he
[1:15:46] elevates it again he says what and if
[1:15:49] you shall see the son of man descend up
[1:15:50] where he was before now he's talking
[1:15:52] about his Ascension his resurrection and
[1:15:54] his Ascension he's the son of Mary and
[1:15:57] Joseph they might think and now he's
[1:15:59] talking as if he's some angel or some
[1:16:01] God going up and down he says if you
[1:16:03] think that's a tough one well what about
[1:16:04] if you see me going up and down into
[1:16:06] heaven and then he says these words it
[1:16:08] is the spirit that quickeneth it's the
[1:16:11] spirit that makes us live he says the
[1:16:13] flesh profits nothing in other words the
[1:16:15] flesh can't do a single thing right in
[1:16:17] God's eyes or compared to God's ways of
[1:16:20] doing things he says the words that I
[1:16:22] speak unto you they are SP spirit and
[1:16:25] they are life why they were resting on
[1:16:27] the books of Moses and he says search
[1:16:29] the scriptures you think you've got
[1:16:30] salvation in them he says it's right
[1:16:33] here your salvation is now in flesh the
[1:16:35] words have come off the page they come
[1:16:37] into a flesh body and that's standing in
[1:16:38] front of you search them and see if they
[1:16:40] don't tell you exactly who I am and they
[1:16:42] did and they did and it says from that
[1:16:45] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:16:48] walked no more with him the 70 turned
[1:16:51] around remember Church the 70 he had
[1:16:54] given them power over demons over
[1:16:56] sickness power to heal or to raise the
[1:16:59] dead that's the ministry of the 70 that
[1:17:03] walked
[1:17:04] away signs and wonders is not proof of
[1:17:07] him in your life it's proof of his
[1:17:11] benefits it's not proof of
[1:17:13] him and we'll see even of the 12 there's
[1:17:16] one that's still
[1:17:17] left but remember they rejected what did
[1:17:20] they reject not the power not the
[1:17:23] authority they rejected the
[1:17:25] word amen they rejected the word in
[1:17:28] flesh which meant that they rejected the
[1:17:30] word in spirit when it would come later
[1:17:31] and in truth and they fulfill what Paul
[1:17:33] would talk about in Hebrews 6 where he
[1:17:35] said they tasted of the good word of God
[1:17:36] and the powers of the world to come but
[1:17:38] never went all the way and so they
[1:17:40] cannot come back somebody has to fulfill
[1:17:43] it and it's people that will go 90% of
[1:17:45] the way and then pull back why because
[1:17:49] they didn't stick around long enough for
[1:17:50] God to reveal it to
[1:17:52] them he says then said Jesus son to the
[1:17:55] 12 will ye also go away and then Simon
[1:17:58] Peter Simon Peter answered him and said
[1:18:00] Lord no we understand everything you
[1:18:02] said we're good we're going to stay with
[1:18:05] you no Peter didn't have a clue what he
[1:18:08] was talking about not the not the not
[1:18:11] the foggiest idea as we would say
[1:18:14] here Peter had no idea what he was
[1:18:16] talking about and yet he said Lord to
[1:18:18] whom shall we go thou Hast the words of
[1:18:23] eternal life
[1:18:25] he believed it without
[1:18:28] understanding he says and we believe and
[1:18:30] are sure that thou art that Christ the
[1:18:33] son of the Living God Church there is
[1:18:36] nothing can replace personal revelation
[1:18:37] in your life I can stand up here and I
[1:18:39] can preach till I'm bleue in the face
[1:18:41] and and and and give you the foundation
[1:18:43] of the truth of the word of the
[1:18:44] doctrines I can move mountains I could
[1:18:46] heal the sick raise the dead it would
[1:18:48] not matter if you don't have a personal
[1:18:49] revelation that you have met Christ and
[1:18:51] he's living in your life by the Holy
[1:18:53] Spirit that's the only thing that will
[1:18:55] because we're going to come up against
[1:18:56] things where we don't understand we
[1:18:58] don't understand why it's taking so long
[1:19:00] do we brother Grant we don't we don't
[1:19:03] understand why it's taking so long we
[1:19:04] don't understand why we go through
[1:19:06] things we do we don't understand why
[1:19:07] some people aren't in we don't
[1:19:09] understand why some people aren't out we
[1:19:11] don't understand how God works we don't
[1:19:14] understand why he's silent at times but
[1:19:15] there's got to be an anchor inside of us
[1:19:18] that says yet I believe that thou art
[1:19:20] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:19:21] you're living in me
[1:19:23] today that's the only thing that's going
[1:19:25] to hold us not emotion not some power
[1:19:30] it's got to be the life within us a
[1:19:32] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:34] personally that 70 walked away that day
[1:19:37] they cast out demons theyd healed the
[1:19:38] sick they raised the Dead the scripture
[1:19:40] testifies of it and yet they walked away
[1:19:42] from the Living Word in flesh because
[1:19:44] they did not
[1:19:47] understand and they never got to a place
[1:19:49] where they would ever be
[1:19:51] changed he says and he's doing it the
[1:19:53] same thing today speaking of Christ when
[1:19:56] he sends forth a meeting like that
[1:19:57] revivals and starts a meeting in the
[1:19:59] earth and starts moving with along with
[1:20:01] these great signs and wonders and then
[1:20:03] you see come back that same old school
[1:20:05] of teaching there's something wrong
[1:20:07] there somewhere he says there's
[1:20:08] something new coming forth when Jesus
[1:20:11] came out after he's a fine Rabbi he
[1:20:13] could go to any pulpit and preach when
[1:20:15] he was Healing The Sick when oh they
[1:20:17] like to have him over there see when
[1:20:20] he's doing the works they love
[1:20:22] him everyone wants the Loaves and fish
[1:20:24] everyone wants their to be healed their
[1:20:26] loved ones to be healed but then he says
[1:20:28] now what happens when he brings the word
[1:20:31] he says but one day he sat down and said
[1:20:33] I and my father are one brother he
[1:20:36] wasn't so popular after that when he
[1:20:38] said except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:20:40] my blood you have no life in you but he
[1:20:42] that eats my flesh and drinks my blood
[1:20:44] has everlasting life and I'll raise him
[1:20:46] up at the last day then he wasn't so
[1:20:48] popular from them they said this man's a
[1:20:50] vampire this man is a beel that's the
[1:20:52] way he done them things he could tell
[1:20:54] for forun he looked through their minds
[1:20:55] and perceived their thoughts he's a
[1:20:57] fortune
[1:21:00] teller the word made flesh and they're
[1:21:02] calling him
[1:21:04] satanic he says but what it was he was
[1:21:07] the word of God made manifest for that
[1:21:09] hour and he was Duty bound he said I do
[1:21:12] always that which is pleasing to my
[1:21:14] father he says God help us to do the
[1:21:16] same thing do that which is pleasing the
[1:21:19] father Church what causes people to Fall
[1:21:21] Away not the anointing not not the power
[1:21:25] not the demonstration not the gifts it's
[1:21:28] always the word it's always the truth
[1:21:33] and the closer it comes to who and what
[1:21:35] we are the more people back away from
[1:21:42] it why because Christ is the word the
[1:21:46] rest is just the
[1:21:47] benefits we go to a job and we get all
[1:21:49] the benefits the the signs and wonders
[1:21:52] the tongues the healings the Deliverance
[1:21:54] that's all just the benefits package but
[1:21:56] it's Christ the word that we have to
[1:21:58] receive and that's the most important
[1:21:59] thing in
[1:22:00] this we see now how after after this
[1:22:03] that Christ comes to Jerusalem and he
[1:22:05] went to the temple three days before the
[1:22:06] Passover you remember and he goes in and
[1:22:08] the first day he goes in and this and
[1:22:10] the the Sadducees are there or the
[1:22:12] Pharisees are there and they question
[1:22:13] him and he answers them perfectly then
[1:22:15] he comes back the next day and they ask
[1:22:17] him again and by the third day there's
[1:22:18] only a lawyer left that's willing to ask
[1:22:20] him a question because they can find no
[1:22:21] fault in him and he answers him
[1:22:23] perfectly and then he is what he goes
[1:22:25] through the the the Passover and these
[1:22:27] different things and then he comes up
[1:22:29] before Herod and before Pilate and they
[1:22:31] can find no fault in him and so he's
[1:22:33] claimed he he he's verified as the
[1:22:35] perfect lamb but we know that on the
[1:22:37] evening of that third day in Jerusalem
[1:22:39] he goes into the Passover room with his
[1:22:41] disciples and now he finally starts to
[1:22:43] explain what he was talking about about
[1:22:45] eating his flesh and drinking his blood
[1:22:47] and he clarifies hey I wasn't telling
[1:22:49] you you guys are going to literally eat
[1:22:50] or drink my body he starts to show them
[1:22:53] what he's talking about and he's still
[1:22:55] talking in types but he's opening up the
[1:22:57] word to them and it says and as they
[1:22:59] were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed
[1:23:01] it and break it and gave it to the
[1:23:02] disciples and says take eat this is my
[1:23:05] body and you can imagine the big sigh of
[1:23:07] relief that they said well I guess we're
[1:23:08] not going to have to eat his
[1:23:12] body Jesus is explaining the Passover
[1:23:15] feast and he's saying what you've been
[1:23:17] doing for 2400 years is now being
[1:23:21] fulfilled what it was pointing to the
[1:23:24] pipes and Shadows of the Passover are
[1:23:26] now being fulfilled in me and in my life
[1:23:28] and in my body and it's all he says it's
[1:23:29] all pointing to me the feast is just
[1:23:31] pointing to me it was always bringing us
[1:23:33] to this day and now you're going to get
[1:23:35] the Fulfillment of what that meant what
[1:23:37] is his body church it's the bread of
[1:23:40] life it's the word of God it's the
[1:23:42] unadulterated word it's the unleavened
[1:23:44] bread it's pure amen as we studied last
[1:23:46] service you can't mix anything with it
[1:23:49] John 1:1 says this and in the beginning
[1:23:51] was the word the word was with God and
[1:23:53] the word was was God that's a perfect
[1:23:55] explanation of the godhead right there
[1:23:57] but it says in verse 16 and the Word was
[1:23:59] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:24:01] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[1:24:04] only begotten of the father full of
[1:24:06] grace and truth so Jesus comes down now
[1:24:10] and it's the word made flesh it's the
[1:24:11] living bread and he says you got to feed
[1:24:13] on the word of God and the word of God
[1:24:15] is not just the Books of Moses it's not
[1:24:17] just letters and words on a page but
[1:24:19] it's a person it's a living thing it has
[1:24:23] power it has Grace it has truth it has
[1:24:26] Authority amen remember what Paul said
[1:24:28] later he would say the letter kth but
[1:24:30] the spirit giveth life and we see Christ
[1:24:32] comes and he's the Living Word with the
[1:24:34] spirit of God inside of him and those
[1:24:36] men those priests are standing there
[1:24:38] with the letter of the word and what did
[1:24:39] it do it killed them because they clung
[1:24:42] to their Works rather than to the
[1:24:44] changing work of
[1:24:46] Calvary what happens why does the word
[1:24:49] why does the letter kill that way
[1:24:51] because it tells you what you ought to
[1:24:53] be what you ought to do and you believe
[1:24:56] it and yet you can't live it cuz it
[1:24:59] takes the spirit to live it amen knowing
[1:25:02] the truth doesn't make you
[1:25:04] right you've got to be the truth to be
[1:25:08] right amen it takes the Life of Christ
[1:25:10] the Holy Spirit to make that happen so
[1:25:13] he said okay you got to eat my my body
[1:25:15] and it's this bread then he says he took
[1:25:16] the cup and gave thanks and gave it to
[1:25:18] him saying drink ye all of it all of it
[1:25:21] he says for this is my blood of the New
[1:25:23] Testament which is shed for many of the
[1:25:25] remissions of sins so they know okay we
[1:25:26] don't have to drink his blood now now we
[1:25:28] just have to drink the communion wine
[1:25:30] now wine we know always represents one
[1:25:33] thing stimulation of Revelation and the
[1:25:36] greatest Revelation you can have is that
[1:25:38] you're a son or a daughter of God and
[1:25:40] your sins are not only forgiven they are
[1:25:42] erased under the blood of Christ that's
[1:25:45] the first great revelation we have you
[1:25:47] ask me why I'm happy well I'll just tell
[1:25:49] you why because my sins are gone that's
[1:25:51] the first revelation we all get but it's
[1:25:53] not the only Revelation that's only the
[1:25:55] start of our walk it's not the end of
[1:25:57] our walk amen child of God born of God
[1:26:01] going back to God and we grow in Grace
[1:26:03] and Faith before him but what makes the
[1:26:05] word live Church a personal
[1:26:08] revelation amen a personal revelation
[1:26:10] that it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:26:12] glory it's the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:26:13] spirit is the stimulating agent for the
[1:26:16] word without the Holy Spirit we're just
[1:26:18] message
[1:26:20] Idols that's the only way I can say it
[1:26:22] we're just message Idols we're a for but
[1:26:24] we're not the it we're not the living
[1:26:26] word amen the holy spirit's the
[1:26:28] quickening power the it literally means
[1:26:30] the living power and it makes us live it
[1:26:33] by Revelation in our lives amen Paul had
[1:26:35] the letter of the word and he was
[1:26:37] Antichrist for 30 or 40 years
[1:26:40] persecuting the true church but as soon
[1:26:42] as he got the spirit the quickening
[1:26:43] power he turned 180 degrees in his life
[1:26:48] why cuz now the word had come alive and
[1:26:50] it was a personal revelation to him he
[1:26:52] thought he had Revelation but what he
[1:26:53] had was a satanic interpretation that
[1:26:55] was killing
[1:26:56] him Jesus is saying drink my blood and
[1:26:59] typ and he's saying you need the life of
[1:27:01] the word in order to make this
[1:27:04] work can't just take the letter you got
[1:27:06] to have the life with it who is the word
[1:27:08] Christ what do we need the same life
[1:27:10] that Christ had he was the Living Word
[1:27:12] we're supposed to become the Living Word
[1:27:14] Church consider this animal life is
[1:27:17] compatible with animal life a lamb can
[1:27:19] transfuse to another lamb human life is
[1:27:22] compatible to human life a human can
[1:27:24] transfuse to another
[1:27:26] human catch this God's life is only
[1:27:30] compatible with God's life amen the life
[1:27:34] of the word made flesh is only
[1:27:35] compatible with the word made
[1:27:37] flesh when Christ came if he was just a
[1:27:39] man then all we got was human
[1:27:43] life but if he was God in flesh then we
[1:27:47] got the life of God in flesh and the
[1:27:49] life of God in flesh is compatible with
[1:27:52] only one thing God inesh
[1:27:55] flesh amen when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:27:58] Church it is the seal it is the key it
[1:28:02] is the authority it is everything you
[1:28:04] have need of to take you from this world
[1:28:07] into the next
[1:28:12] amen saying that will choke a lot of
[1:28:14] people
[1:28:15] today but the life of the word made
[1:28:17] flesh is only compatible with the word
[1:28:20] made flesh today came to do the exact
[1:28:22] same thing to produce the same thing
[1:28:24] what's God doing when he gives you the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost he's confirming who you are
[1:28:29] we look in John 1 a little further down
[1:28:31] says but as many as received him to them
[1:28:33] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:28:36] even to them that believe on his name
[1:28:38] now that sounds like people accept or
[1:28:39] reject Christ and then based on that
[1:28:41] decision then God gives them power which
[1:28:43] is the Holy Spirit to become sons of God
[1:28:46] but that is 100% wrong absolutely wrong
[1:28:49] we have to let scripture interpret
[1:28:50] scripture amen so then we come to Paul
[1:28:52] in Galatians 4:6 he says because ye are
[1:28:56] Sons because ye are Sons God has sent
[1:28:58] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:29:00] hearts crying Abba Father see we look at
[1:29:02] John 1:12 it says to them gave he power
[1:29:05] what he didn't give them power to
[1:29:06] receive it he gave them power to receive
[1:29:09] the word and the word leads them to the
[1:29:10] Holy Spirit you can't receive God unless
[1:29:12] you are a child of God in the first
[1:29:14] place it's the only thing compatible
[1:29:15] with God is his own flesh and blood amen
[1:29:18] it's his own nature his own DNA and so
[1:29:20] then he says because ye are Sons because
[1:29:23] ye are Sons not because you chose not
[1:29:25] because you made a decision not because
[1:29:27] you think you made a move towards God
[1:29:29] but rather because you already are a
[1:29:31] child of God regardless of what your
[1:29:33] condition is this morning because you
[1:29:35] are a child of God he sends his holy
[1:29:36] spirit your way and it Woos you and it
[1:29:38] pulls you and it convicts you and it
[1:29:41] brings you into his presence until you
[1:29:42] start to say I am a child of God Lord
[1:29:45] I'm coming back to you make me more like
[1:29:47] you taking communion does not give you
[1:29:50] eternal
[1:29:52] life but but if you look at what Jesus
[1:29:55] said there you could say communion gives
[1:29:56] you eternal
[1:29:58] life the Catholics make a big deal of it
[1:30:01] they turn it into a magical event where
[1:30:03] the priest literally changes the bread
[1:30:05] into the body of Christ and the wine
[1:30:07] into the blood of Christ and I'm reading
[1:30:09] from their website okay says in the
[1:30:11] celebration of the Eucharist that's what
[1:30:12] they call the communion so in the
[1:30:14] celebration of the communion bread and
[1:30:16] wine become the body and blood of Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ through the power of the Holy
[1:30:20] Spirit and the instrumentality of the
[1:30:23] priests
[1:30:26] as soon as we touch it Church it ain't
[1:30:29] God it either is God or it isn't God but
[1:30:33] it doesn't take me to turn it into
[1:30:35] God but if this is true then the
[1:30:38] communion will be all we need to do
[1:30:40] because you'll be eating his flesh and
[1:30:42] drinking his blood and Jesus said that's
[1:30:43] all you need to do you do that you have
[1:30:45] eternal
[1:30:46] life but you go have communion communion
[1:30:48] is a part of our Christian Walk we're
[1:30:50] going to have it in October we don't
[1:30:51] have to have communion every day Paul
[1:30:53] said as often often as you do it he
[1:30:56] didn't say do it every day didn't say do
[1:30:58] it every service but as often as you do
[1:30:59] it do it in remembrance of me it's
[1:31:01] supposed to be pointing to a work you've
[1:31:02] already accepted in your life something
[1:31:04] he's already done inside of you amen
[1:31:06] Judas drank the wine and ate the bread
[1:31:09] right there with Jesus if there was a
[1:31:11] Holy Communion that was the Holy
[1:31:12] Communion with Christ himself there and
[1:31:14] yet what did he do he walked out and he
[1:31:16] betrayed him and he was revealed as the
[1:31:17] son of predition communion doesn't save
[1:31:20] you brother Bram said communion is a
[1:31:22] Battleground
[1:31:26] amen as to where your life is
[1:31:30] amen but rather communion is a
[1:31:32] remembrance a symbol of what has
[1:31:33] happened in their lives because they
[1:31:35] still had to come to the day of
[1:31:37] Pentecost and when Peter came down those
[1:31:39] stairs from the upper room he didn't
[1:31:40] come down and say everybody take
[1:31:42] communion did he he said repent be
[1:31:44] baptized for remission of sins and you
[1:31:46] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:31:47] Spirit that's the way to get eternal
[1:31:49] life
[1:31:50] amen now we know the crucifixion story
[1:31:53] we know the death of Christ and that
[1:31:54] death reflected what we were worthy of
[1:31:57] it was not a nice death it was not an
[1:31:59] easy death it wasn't you know a you're
[1:32:02] just getting your head chopped off it
[1:32:03] wasn't anything like that it was a long
[1:32:05] dragged out painful death to sit there
[1:32:08] and think about everything you'd done
[1:32:10] wrong we've talked about this many times
[1:32:12] about how he who knew no sin became our
[1:32:14] sin he never had a sinful thought he
[1:32:17] never had a sinful desire he never had
[1:32:19] committed sin and the weight of the
[1:32:20] entire world's sin came on him in a
[1:32:22] moment and he had a body built to
[1:32:25] support it until he would give up his
[1:32:27] life but he's sitting there and all the
[1:32:29] smut and the filth and everything that
[1:32:32] we have ever done Church from the
[1:32:34] smallest to the
[1:32:35] biggest coursing through his mind he
[1:32:39] literally became our sin cuz remember
[1:32:43] when Christ comes it's not just a symbol
[1:32:45] now it's literal it's literal life and
[1:32:49] it's literal sin he embodied our sin our
[1:32:52] sin literally became became
[1:32:55] him his whole makeup was
[1:33:00] sin and he dies up there but I want to
[1:33:03] look at the very end because we're
[1:33:05] talking about the life of the blood and
[1:33:06] we see at the end that Jesus does not
[1:33:08] lose his life he gives up his life
[1:33:12] everything he did was voluntary CU
[1:33:14] remember the Lamb of the Old Testament
[1:33:15] could not choose to give its life it
[1:33:18] couldn't choose and if it knew what it
[1:33:21] was choosing then it wouldn't do it but
[1:33:22] Christ came and he said not my will but
[1:33:25] thine be done and he voluntarily gave
[1:33:26] himself to the beatings to the whippings
[1:33:28] to the the the the slapping and the
[1:33:31] spitting and the making fun of and the
[1:33:33] nakedness and then the receiving of all
[1:33:35] of our sin on him took it all
[1:33:37] voluntarily and then he comes up and he
[1:33:40] goes to Calvary and he gives his own
[1:33:42] life and he was perfect he was perfect
[1:33:45] in life we said he he went through all
[1:33:47] of the judgments he went through all of
[1:33:48] the the the checks by the priesthood and
[1:33:50] the government and everyone and he was
[1:33:52] the perfect lamb and then he comes up to
[1:33:55] Calvary and he gives a perfect life and
[1:33:58] that's where we started the service it
[1:34:00] said for as much as ye know that ye were
[1:34:02] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[1:34:04] silver and gold from your vain
[1:34:06] conversation received by tradition from
[1:34:08] your fathers but with the precious blood
[1:34:10] of Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[1:34:13] and without spot you know we tend to
[1:34:16] look at
[1:34:17] redeemed sometimes too much on the what
[1:34:19] we get side but what he's trying to do
[1:34:23] on the Redemption rtion is get us back
[1:34:24] to what we are that's the first work of
[1:34:27] redemption is to restore us back to Eden
[1:34:30] is to restore our natur to destroy our
[1:34:32] or to to restore our character to
[1:34:35] restore the way we think to restore the
[1:34:36] way we react to bring us back into Sons
[1:34:39] and Daughters of God and then from there
[1:34:41] add in all the blessings and the
[1:34:42] benefits of our inheritance amen it
[1:34:44] means we're restored back not just we
[1:34:47] get our stuff back but we get ourselves
[1:34:49] back first and foremost that's the work
[1:34:50] of the life of the blood amen but there
[1:34:53] needed to be blood that was shed on
[1:34:55] Calvary because remember when they went
[1:34:56] and they sacrificed the lamb what they
[1:34:58] do is they would slit the throat and
[1:35:00] then the way of doing it they had very
[1:35:01] sharp knives and they have a way of
[1:35:02] slaying the throat so that there's no
[1:35:04] pain but all that happens is that lamb
[1:35:06] knows it's dying and all the blood pours
[1:35:09] out and they need that blood for the
[1:35:10] sacrifice and to go on to The Sinner and
[1:35:12] these different things and so Jesus is
[1:35:14] on that cross and his blood is dripping
[1:35:16] out but it's not being poured out and so
[1:35:19] we see what happens and it seems
[1:35:21] unnecessary when we look at the at the
[1:35:23] seene that was there but yet it had to
[1:35:25] happen because the word of God had to be
[1:35:27] fulfilled and the law had to be
[1:35:28] fulfilled perfectly and it says when
[1:35:30] Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
[1:35:32] he said it is finished and he bowed his
[1:35:34] head and gave up the ghost he gave up
[1:35:37] his life he released it voluntarily was
[1:35:39] not taken from him remember what brother
[1:35:41] BR would say he took that Stinger of
[1:35:43] death and he pulled it in he gave his
[1:35:46] life
[1:35:47] willingly but then when they're coming
[1:35:49] around they come to Jesus and saw that
[1:35:51] he was dead already they didn't break
[1:35:52] his legs but one of the soldiers with a
[1:35:54] spear pierced his side and forth with
[1:35:57] came there out blood and water because
[1:36:01] remember when the lamb was slain the
[1:36:04] blood had to pour out and what did he do
[1:36:06] there
[1:36:07] church blood and water and he's already
[1:36:10] given his Spirit he poured out the three
[1:36:12] elements that were necessary for us to
[1:36:13] be changed back into into our original
[1:36:16] condition blood for forgiveness of sins
[1:36:18] water for baptism and the washing of
[1:36:20] Water by the word and then H the Holy
[1:36:22] Spirit which is the life of God inside
[1:36:24] of you you have to be all three you have
[1:36:27] to have all three to be born again you
[1:36:30] can have the the the blood be justified
[1:36:32] you're not born again Sanctified by the
[1:36:34] washing of Water by the word you're not
[1:36:36] born again it takes the life because you
[1:36:38] have to be born life has to come forth
[1:36:40] you got to die and then come out a new
[1:36:42] creation amen and as soon as Christ dies
[1:36:45] what happens there's an earthquake and
[1:36:48] then the veil is torn from top to bottom
[1:36:50] on the holy of holies remember Paul was
[1:36:52] saying that they would come in and every
[1:36:54] year they come in that one time one
[1:36:56] person had access to God and as soon as
[1:36:58] Christ dies what happens the veil is
[1:37:00] torn completely what's he saying there's
[1:37:03] a way made access is wide open there is
[1:37:07] no reason there's no excuse today to say
[1:37:09] why you can't come into the presence of
[1:37:10] God but what was he also showing church
[1:37:13] he was showing God ain't in there
[1:37:15] anymore Christ died that veil was torn
[1:37:19] the shikina glory the personal presence
[1:37:21] of God left and you know what happened
[1:37:23] in there
[1:37:24] everything started to Die the Mana
[1:37:27] started to rot see the Mana it was
[1:37:30] original Mana from Moses time and it in
[1:37:33] the presence of God it never went bad
[1:37:35] they had Aaron's Rod there that
[1:37:36] blossomed and produced almonds that was
[1:37:38] always there they could always taste and
[1:37:40] see that God was alive and well and the
[1:37:43] next day when the priesthood went into
[1:37:45] that room it was rotten they knew that
[1:37:48] the glory of the Lord had departed and
[1:37:50] you know what they did Church they sewed
[1:37:52] up that torn curtain and they went on
[1:37:55] pretending that God was with
[1:37:59] them what was it God was saying I'm not
[1:38:01] dwelling in a holy of holies anymore I'm
[1:38:03] changing my Tabernacles I'm changing my
[1:38:06] dwelling place and it's not where only
[1:38:08] one person can get to me and you have to
[1:38:10] be a minister and you have to be this
[1:38:11] and you have to be that he was saying no
[1:38:12] I'm coming down into a new set of
[1:38:14] Tabernacles now not just one but I'm
[1:38:16] going to be in all of
[1:38:18] them Hebrews 10 says this and every
[1:38:21] priest standeth daily ministering and
[1:38:24] offering offering oftentimes the same
[1:38:26] sacrifices which can never take away
[1:38:28] sins talk about a fruitless Endeavor
[1:38:31] holding back but could never take it
[1:38:34] away but this man speaking of Christ
[1:38:37] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:38:39] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:38:42] of God from henceforth expecting till
[1:38:45] his enemies be made his foot still foot
[1:38:47] stol for by one offering what was that
[1:38:51] offering Church blood
[1:38:54] water and spirit
[1:38:56] amen one offering he had perfected
[1:39:00] remember it could not perfect nor could
[1:39:02] it erase the conscience he says by one
[1:39:04] offering he has perfected forever he has
[1:39:07] completed he has finished forever them
[1:39:10] that are Sanctified past tense as soon
[1:39:13] as that was done we stepped into a
[1:39:15] perfect work we stepped into a finished
[1:39:16] work we stepped into a complete work in
[1:39:18] God's
[1:39:20] eyes that's what the token was pointing
[1:39:24] to was a blood that would do this that
[1:39:27] would Perfect The Sinner forever that
[1:39:30] would finish the work that the blood of
[1:39:31] bulls and goats and Lambs could never
[1:39:33] do ab brah says this perfected for how
[1:39:36] long
[1:39:37] forever then what is the Holy Ghost
[1:39:40] friend we've allowed it to too many
[1:39:41] things you Lutheran oh my you think
[1:39:43] because you live the Lu you join the
[1:39:45] Lutheran Church the just shall live by
[1:39:47] faith Luther says we got it but they
[1:39:49] found out they didn't you methodists
[1:39:50] when you got Sanctified and shouted and
[1:39:52] clapped your hands and run up and down
[1:39:53] the aisle you thought you had it but
[1:39:55] come to find out you didn't the
[1:39:57] Pentecostals when they could speak in
[1:39:59] tongues or dance in the spirit they
[1:40:00] thought they had it but they found out
[1:40:03] they
[1:40:04] didn't Judas went to all of those levels
[1:40:07] not speaking in tongues perhaps but all
[1:40:09] the signs and
[1:40:11] wonders he says all those things are all
[1:40:14] right but that isn't it it's the person
[1:40:17] the Holy Spirit himself the resurrected
[1:40:19] Christ and when you lay your hands by
[1:40:22] faith upon God's accepted and provided
[1:40:24] sacrifice which was absolutely perfect
[1:40:27] there's the body of Christ and out of
[1:40:29] Adam's side came a rib that made his
[1:40:31] bride and out of the side of Christ came
[1:40:33] the blood the water spirit for his bride
[1:40:39] Hallelujah he says and how do we get
[1:40:40] into that
[1:40:42] body by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:40:45] into one body Romans 81 there is
[1:40:48] therefore now see remember under the
[1:40:50] blood of bulls and goats it could never
[1:40:52] fix their conscience now watch what he
[1:40:53] says Romans 81 there is therefore now no
[1:40:56] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:40:57] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:41:00] after the spirit they're like Abraham
[1:41:03] they call those things which were not as
[1:41:05] though they were because they are dead
[1:41:07] to the things of the world and alive
[1:41:10] again in Christ by the baptism of the
[1:41:12] Holy Ghost amen you want to know how you
[1:41:15] got the if you got the holy ghost look
[1:41:17] right there they are dead to the things
[1:41:19] of the world and they are alive again in
[1:41:20] Christ we'll talk about that in the
[1:41:22] coming days one last quote before we
[1:41:24] close he says but the worshipper when
[1:41:26] the worshipper once purged once purged
[1:41:29] Church by the blood of Christ has no
[1:41:32] more conscience of sin because the life
[1:41:37] that came out of the blood of the Lord
[1:41:39] Jesus Christ is none other than his own
[1:41:42] life that returns to the believer and
[1:41:45] brings the believer into fellowship with
[1:41:48] himself amen let's stand musicians would
[1:41:52] come
[1:41:54] amen I can testify to that it used to be
[1:41:57] when I did something it would hang over
[1:41:59] me and it would bother me forever and
[1:42:00] forever and ever I still make mistakes I
[1:42:03] don't know if you guys are still making
[1:42:04] mistakes I'm still making mistakes and
[1:42:06] you know what when I make mistakes I
[1:42:07] don't like it I don't feel good about it
[1:42:10] but I'll tell you I can take it to him
[1:42:12] and say Lord I'm
[1:42:14] sorry I didn't mean to do it I didn't
[1:42:16] plan to do it but I did it and I say
[1:42:19] Lord will you forgive me and what do I
[1:42:22] do I claim The Blood Brother Bob took my
[1:42:25] song at the end of service there I claim
[1:42:27] the blood and you know what church I can
[1:42:29] walk out without a thought in the world
[1:42:32] of what has happened that's the freedom
[1:42:35] there's no condemnation there's
[1:42:36] conviction but conviction brings me to
[1:42:38] repentance which brings me to put it
[1:42:40] under the blood of Christ and then I can
[1:42:42] walk away and my conscience is
[1:42:43] completely clean not seared see some
[1:42:46] people there's a sear they can do
[1:42:47] anything and walk away that's not what
[1:42:49] we're talking about but our conscience
[1:42:50] is clean we have no more conscience of
[1:42:53] sin we're not thinking about it we're
[1:42:54] not beating ourselves up about it we're
[1:42:56] not Catholics telling God that he's got
[1:42:58] to do something bad to make us pay for
[1:42:59] it amen we can put it under the blood of
[1:43:02] Jesus Christ and walk away and say I'm
[1:43:04] free I'm completely free I never did it
[1:43:08] in the first place amen that's what his
[1:43:11] work will do what do we need church we
[1:43:13] don't just need the blood we need the
[1:43:15] life of the blood amen the blood covers
[1:43:17] the the the the blood pays the dead off
[1:43:21] amen it doesn't just separate us from
[1:43:22] our sins Church it says they are not
[1:43:25] even there brother remember what he said
[1:43:27] it says it's like a drop of ink and a
[1:43:29] bucket of bleach you put it in there it
[1:43:31] doesn't exist anymore it completely
[1:43:33] dissolves it your sins are gone amen
[1:43:36] that's what happens under the blood of
[1:43:37] Christ it takes away the condemnation it
[1:43:40] sets us free from our past see we tend
[1:43:43] to look 10 years back what about
[1:43:45] yesterday what about this week it can
[1:43:48] set us free from all of those things
[1:43:49] amen if we can only confess it to him
[1:43:53] but that blood of Christ with it it
[1:43:54] released the life of the blood for the
[1:43:57] first time in history we could receive
[1:44:00] the life of the blood back on us to live
[1:44:02] a new way to talk a new
[1:44:04] way to have a marriage in a new way to
[1:44:07] Worship in a new way to understand the
[1:44:10] word in a new way yo Jesus first sermon
[1:44:14] he said the anointing is upon me I'm
[1:44:16] anointed he said to heal the
[1:44:18] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:44:20] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:44:22] the blind and to set at Liberty them
[1:44:24] that are
[1:44:25] bruised we tend to look at those as
[1:44:27] things that are come against us but I'll
[1:44:30] tell you the greatest Deliverance I need
[1:44:31] is from myself remember brother Aaron
[1:44:33] talked about that he says we got two
[1:44:34] great enemies Satan and ourselves and
[1:44:37] the first thing he comes us do is to set
[1:44:38] us free from ourselves amen we die out
[1:44:40] and then he deals with what Satan's
[1:44:42] trying to do in our lives and it takes
[1:44:44] the life of the blood to do it the Holy
[1:44:46] Spirit which is the Life of Christ amen
[1:44:49] amen God bless you I trust it's been a
[1:44:52] blessing I trust that you'll be blessed
[1:44:53] in the services coming up I wish I could
[1:44:56] be here I hate to miss when ministers
[1:44:57] are coming in but it's a necessary uh
[1:45:00] situation I guess so God bless you each
[1:45:03] one amen pray for us as we travel today
[1:45:06] it's been a long couple of weeks I've
[1:45:08] got a lot I've got conferences for four
[1:45:10] days this week I've got a lot of
[1:45:12] speaking to do there and then I'm still
[1:45:13] preparing to minister so it's still a
[1:45:15] lot of lot Weighing on me so I I trust
[1:45:17] that God will be with me but I crave
[1:45:19] your prayers amen for that let's bow our
[1:45:22] heads
[1:45:23] Heavenly

[1:45:47] life that's in you is in us and it has
[1:45:48] to do the same Works Lord it brings us
[1:45:51] subject to your word it makes us yearn
[1:45:53] for your word Lord it makes us feed on
[1:45:55] your word for that's what the Holy
[1:45:56] Spirit does Lord I pray that as we move
[1:45:59] forward in this series Lord as we start
