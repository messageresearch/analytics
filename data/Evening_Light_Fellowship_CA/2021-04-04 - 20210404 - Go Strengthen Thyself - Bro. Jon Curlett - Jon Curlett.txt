professionals out in the world it's nothing can compare because we're singing with revelation we're singing with a with a true purpose of heart and uh that's to me that's the difference and i to me the whole world stands still [Music] with the power of god in the voice and the revelation that comes forth is just wonderful sister maureen played it earlier let's sing it i will proclaim 12 25 amen

sacrifice this morning although we're here to sacrifice lord to commemorate that the receipt has been given amen lord that when you rose lord it was proof that the price was paid lord that the sacrifice was perfect lord in that we stand justified in your presence under the shed blood and lord we want to rejoice in that this morning [Music] not just this morning lord but every morning lord because your mercies are new every day heavenly father lord what grace lord what mercy lord what commitment you had to your purpose and plan and lord our desire this morning is to be equally committed lord that we would reflect the glory of the risen lamb in our lives lord that it would not just be men and women lord but it would be god made flesh lord that people would see a risen savior in us today heavenly father lord as you lay down your life for us may we lay down our life for you lord may your holy spirit just have free reign this morning again lord strengthen us for battle encourage us along the way lord may you draw souls to you lord and may we just be an expectation for the moving of your spirit lord however you would move lord in the sovereignty of your will lord we give this service to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen if you'll take your scriptures this morning turn to first kings chapter 20 amen thank you musicians that'll be it amen certainly enjoy the specials i always enjoy hearing my daughter sing but sister kim i really enjoyed that thank you for singing that this morning amen i know it's a sacrifice especially for the the new mothers and whatnot and uh certainly appreciate the addition to the service amen it's wonderful to see the gifts being used and then the sacrifices made and the worship and the atmosphere that it creates amen i really enjoy that tape on on on wednesday night really jumped out of me that part about the receipt and i never heard that before where he said it was proof that the price had been paid the sacrifice accepted and because of that we stand justified this morning amen and justified doesn't mean it's as if you never did it brother brahm says you never did it in the first place amen what a place to stand you never did it satan has nothing he can bring against you you never did it in the first place amen the price is fully paid it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness and if he can't remember it then satan is a liar amen if it doesn't exist in god's world it doesn't exist amen so when satan brings it against us he's he's reading from a pack of lies that he's put together amen against the brethren against the the bride of christ amen first kings chapter 20 and we're going to start reading verse 13 if you would keep your bibles open this morning we'll see how the how the screen works if brother matt thinks he might have a way to to get this going but if not you'll need your bibles close by man first kings chapter 20 and verse 13 we're going to read a story this morning that says and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou and then he numbered the young men of the princes of the province and they were 232 and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand and they went out at noon but ben hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him and the young men of the provinces of the princes of the provinces went out first and ben hayden sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria and he said whether they come out for peace take them alive or whether they be out for war be come out for war take them alive so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city in the army which followed them and they slew everyone his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and ben ben had the king of syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria shall come up against thee amen may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats this morning amen for this morning we want to take a title of go strengthen thyself amen and uh this is one of the most interesting battle stories in the scripture because we've got some interesting players here with some interesting conditions in their life and it's it's a beautiful picture to see the grace of god in in something like this and and how he just works and moves and people amen certainly had a tremendous service on sunday and i want to thank the lord for that that's always the sovereign move of god when he moves on people's hearts when he has a message prepared but not only a message prepared but of people ready to receive and act on it amen and god's always mindful of the needs of his children amen those things don't happen because we're sitting at home doing nothing but he looks on us he sees our needs he sees our hearts he sees what's going on in our lives he sees the weaknesses that are there he sees the strengths that need to be brought to the forefront he knows what you're thinking about he knows what you're feeling and then he comes in and he brings his word to deliver you amen he brings his word to strengthen you to encourage you amen amen but i want to share something with you and that's that when you come and respond to the word that's a that's a foresight that's an insight into what god has been thinking about you amen when there's something that comes out it doesn't just show that you're thinking about god but it shows that he's thinking about you amen that he's got a purpose and a plan and he's got a desire for you and it's a good thing for you and then he's got an expected end for you and when you come and you step forward it just gives you a glimpse into the mind of god and what he's thinking about you for that particular time amen we know the scripture says no man comes to god except the father draw him first and even as a child of god god is constantly drawing us and pulling us to his word pulling us to himself and when we respond like that it gives him an opportunity to open up more and more and more of our lives amen it starts to bring us closer and closer to him and he can have a greater and greater effect in our lives amen amen we're believers amen and at the core of a believer the nature of a believer is to believe and it's not just to believe anything but it's to believe the word of god amen and as the holy spirit ignites your heart as it quickens these things then as believers we want to step forward we want to step into the promises of god we want to step into the channel of god we want to step into the moving of god and say lord here i am what would you have your servant to do amen sometimes it's surrender sometimes it's repentance sometimes it's just to stand for somebody else whatever the case may be but we're saying lord we're gonna stand and step into your word and whatever your purpose is for me we're going to do that amen amen but the the thing about great services like that is that the question is always what next amen services like that don't happen every day right and it's not meant to happen every day amen there are cycles in life and there's certain situations it's like in life it's kind of like if you lived your your entire marriage the way you were when you first met and fell in love with your spouse if you lived your entire life with your heart rate amped up all the time and not being able to think straight and doing silly things like we do when we're we're twitter painted then you go through life and you'll be useless amen but there are moments of passion there are there are moments there where you just are so connected with your spouse and it's a great thing and you take that and you build on it don't you and you use that to take your your relationship to the next level and it gives you grace then when things aren't so good and she doesn't make the meal quite the way you want it and he doesn't pick up his clothes and put him in the clothes hamper and these different things right those things they help keep you going and that they kind of give you just little landmarks little little pushes to keep you going in the in the relationship amen the other thing is it's really easy to be brave in a crowd of people when the the lord is moving the presence of the holy spirit is here remember when you're at home and it's just you and the four walls it's a way different situation isn't it when it's just you and your thoughts it's just you and whatever it is that's been bothering you that comes back around and starts knocking on the door that's a whole different animal than when we're in a service and everybody's on you know they're at your back and the preacher's praying and the people are singing and the atmosphere is so heavy but when you go home now it's it's going to be different and that doesn't matter if you have the holy spirit or not it's just you and whatever you are facing whatever you're talking about whatever you're claiming whatever you're looking for the expectation the healing deliverance whatever it might be it's just you and that now right amen and we've got to be able to move in and be able to step past the great service step past the moving of the holy spirit in the service and look for the lord to move in our lives individually amen amen so let's walk down this road of growth strengthen thyself and this story is all about two kings and it's about ben haydad the king of syria and he is an idolater but he's a tool of god that's one thing the syrians and brother paul and i were talking about this he was talking mostly about how god used the syrians no that's a good thing you know it's a good thing he was talking about how syria was a hand it was a tool in the hand of god on a regular basis to chide israel and to correct them and to show them that they were out of the will and plan of god amen so you have a king here that has no right to the land but god's using him for something and then you have ahab and ahab is one of the worst kings because not only is he a a backslidden believer or maybe even a rank unbeliever but he's brought it into the kingdom through marriage and he's allowed his wife to wrap him around her little finger and bring idolatry into the nation to the point where there's only seven thousand believers left in the entire nation and then he's ruling through idolatry rather than through a a one true god amen and so you've got these two kings now coming to battle and what happened with this is ben hayda comes up to samaria and he he he surrounds the city and he says everything you have is mine your gold your silver your wives and your children and ahab says okay then hey that says okay not only that but tomorrow my servants get to walk through your city and they get to go in anybody's house and whatever they see that they like they get to take it so adding insult to injury and the funny thing is this is when ahab says no you know give up your gold your silver your wife and your children yeah you can have that but take whatever else you have in your house he says no no no that's too much i mean what what a condition this man is in that he maybe he's got something hidden there that he really doesn't want to lose he's willing to lose his family he's willing to lose his wealth but he's got these little hidden things that he just doesn't want to let go he'll let the things that matter most go but he's got these little tiny things here maybe he's got this beautiful art that he's really attached to you know willing to let your wife and children go but you can't have my art this is a condition that he's in now amen and then ahab says sorry you can't do it you're gonna have to come take it you know bring it on and he's got no army to fight he's got no way of getting out of this but he says we're gonna fight to the last man because i'm not willing to let you take absolutely everything from me so let's start again in verse 13. we're going to walk through this and and really set a picture here and try and put ourselves into this this morning so first kings 20 verse 13. so this is where this is this is kind of the preface to what we're going to read in verse 13. so ahab said all right we're going to fight for what we have now because you went that far now you can't take anything but he's a backslidden king with no army really and so verse 13 says and behold there came a prophet unto ahab the king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord. now there's a couple things i want you to catch here ahab is a king but he's not a godly king he doesn't worship jehovah he's married to an idolater amen elijah has already killed off all the prophets of baal this is after the mount carmel showdown so this is not like ahab before he became a bad king this is ahab firmly in the grasp of idolatry firmly wrapped around the finger of his wife there's there's no coming back for ahab like he's committed to his path if you look in the scriptures amen he's a bad king he's a weak king he's he's willing to send his family out to save his own wealth okay not a good guy amen but yet god comes looking to bring salvation why because they're the children of israel they're the children of promise and he's coming to this backslidden king and he says look i'm going to do something for you but it's not for you it's to prove that i'm the lord it's to prove that god is still alive in your midst and even though you don't believe it i'm going to do this just for you you backslidden king right because he's got 7 000 believers that are going to be affected by this as well he's not protecting ahab he's protecting the believers that are serving the one true god amen but he comes to that backslidden king and says look i'm going to do something to prove i'm still god regardless of what you've done ahabs or or elijah showed you that i'm a real god that the gods you're serving are not real but i'm going to come down and i'm going to save you but it's going to be for somebody else amen and it is about god amen it's not about ahab so if god's coming down to a backslidden idolatrous king what about his children amen if you if you're standing here and you say well i've done this and i've done that and i'm not here and i'm not there if god's going to come to ahab he doesn't have any problem coming to his children if he'll come to the backsliding idolater he'll come to the backslidden children amen he'll come to the ones that aren't quite where they ought to be the ones that aren't quite as mature as they need to be the ones that aren't quite serving him the way they're supposed to amen if he's gracious to the backslidden one that isn't his child he's going to be gracious to the one that is his child no matter their condition amen verse 14 says and ahab said by whom so he says lord you're going to deliver them into our hand but whose hand and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces and then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou so in other words who'll bring the victory who's going to win the battle and he says it's the bodyguards of the princes of samaria so the princes of samaria each have their own retinue of guards and they're the ones that are going to lead the battle so they're the ones that are going to be the spear tip of god's victories he's going to send out these young warriors these young bodyguards and they're going to be the tip of the army and then he says who's going to command the army though and he says ahab you're going to because you're the king the king commands the army but the victory's going to come through the young men that are leading this army they're not under your command they go out and then you bring the army after amen verse 15 says then he numbered the young man of the princes of the provinces so the bodyguards and there were 232 and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being 7 000 232 men are going to put the enemy on the run gideon had 300. right 232 young men on their own stick them out in front and then whatever happens the army's supposed to follow after them with ahab amen and then they've got 7 000 men and they're facing an army that is massive absolutely massive we know it's over well over a hundred thousand 127 000 is what they're facing here and they've got 7 000 plus 232 7 232 men against 121 thousand they got to kill 300 each that's right right that's tough odds even with a even with machine guns that's tough odds right 300 to 1. 16. i love this and they went out at noon the young men don't sit back and say hey hey we promised to protect you we did not promise to give our lives stupidly against an army of 127 000 men it says they went out at noon but the beautiful thing is ben hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him so this is a done deal for ben haydad as soon as the army comes out of the city he knows we've got them they've got no walls to knock down now it's just going to be one on one 7 232 versus 127 000. it's not even going to be a challenge so they're sitting there having a party and israel comes out for battle and the young men of the princes of the province went out first and ben had sent out and they told him saying these men are come out of samaria so they said hey there's something happening here verse 18 and he said whether they come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive so what he's saying is surround them give them a chance to lay down their weapons and then we'll bring them in we'll have a talk and see what this is all about you know are they being foolish or they come out to to maybe offer a surrender maybe talk about conditions for surrender he says bring him in don't kill him we want to talk to him just surround him and take them into me verse 19. so these young men of the princes of the province came out of the city in the army which followed them and they slew everyone his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and ben hayden the king of syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen so they go to surround them and every one of those bodyguards picks the guy nearest to him and kills them and then they start moving in and they start mowing everybody down and the whole army of israel comes in and one thing they say about armies is once they start moving in whatever direction they're moving you can't stop it right so once they start to retreat then the whole army starts to retreat regardless of whether they've been beaten or not the movement is away and so these young men drive them back and then everybody starts running and israel has a heyday and they just start putting them all on the running man verse 21 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew of the syrians with a great slaughter seven thousand two hundred thirty two against 127 000 they beat him amen beat him with a great slaughter amen that's right okay i want you to mention here it says he smelt the horses and chariots but israel doesn't have horses and chariots right they're up against a vastly they're vastly outnumbered by a superior force they don't have a hope here they don't have the kind of weapons they don't have the technology they don't have the training they have none of this all they have is people that are doing what god said to do and then they go out and they wreck a clearly superior force amen i want to stop there and say we are fighting a clearly superior force amen when we look at ourselves and we compare it against the army that's that's coming against us we don't have what it takes to defeat this force amen when we go up with it with our experience with our intellect with our thoughts with our ideas with our own strength with our own discipline we cannot defeat satan that way amen for one we're not fighting in the flesh so we're never and and all of our strength is in the flesh so that's never going to happen but regardless we're fighting satan with tools of his own making and he's always going to defeat us because he's got the numbers he's got the experience he's got the age to beat us amen if we're using his weapons he's going to beat us every single time brother braham said this in the conflict between god and satan he says satan is more than a match for us we know that we know that satan is way more than a match for any human being and i guarantee you as believers at some point in your life you've tried to do something on your own and you failed miserably just as i have time and time again until you say lord the battle is not mine the battle is yours i'm going to let you do this work i'm going to let you bring me through this and all of a sudden we've got victory where there is no more victory we know that satan is way more than a match for any human being don't you never try and do it with your wisdom or outsmart him you just can't do it our natural condition is what born and sin shaped and iniquity come to the world's speaking lives we're dead in our own trespasses and we can't defeat satan in that condition you've got to be changed you've got to have a new birth you've got to have a new life within you that gives you a new set of weapons to defeat satan because the ones you're born with are the ones that we fell by in the first place amen we won't even slow satan down you can't even slow satan down on your own and if you think that's not true go look in the world because that's what they're fighting if anything they're fighting with satan's own tools and it doesn't slow him down at all he's the master of them amen amen we need new weapons we need a new identity we need a new way of fighting and if we can get those then all of a sudden we can defeat satan amen amen romans 8 35 says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long and we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter amen now they're in an age where they're dying physically they're giving their lives for the gospel but here we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter if we go in on our own strength satan's going to he's going to wipe us out but verse 37 says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in jesus christ our lord so we are conquerors through christ in christ alone amen we are not in ourselves conquerors but we are conquerors through christ amen and we're celebrating that victory this morning when he rose from the dead and he held the keys to death hell and the grave that made us victors over everything that satan came against us with amen brother i was listening to ron spencer last night and he was talking about how you know satan had a demon watching over the body of jesus he this is a story i mean it's not not necessarily true but you know he's dramatizing and satan's saying to satan the body's still there yes sir still here hasn't moved next day body's still there yes sir hasn't moved and then he says on that resurrection morning all of a sudden jesus starts walking out and the saints are walking with him and satan's on his phone texting as he's still there and the demon says he's gone hallelujah he's gone and satan's saying we've got a problem down here because the rest of them are leaving with them amen and that's the victory we're celebrating this morning is that he didn't just rise but he brought everyone with them that had put their life and their trust in him amen and so when we talk about victory we're in christ we rose with him as we die with him we rose with him and that put every everything under our feet amen everything that satan brings is under our feet because we're in christ not because we're in ourselves amen i want to continue that quote i just said where he said that satan we are that satan is way more than a match for any human being that's a horrible thing to say brother jonathan listen to this he says jesus knew this so he sent to the church so that satan would not outstart them outsmart them a place to be fortified so he sent them the holy ghost and the church does not claim to be smart they claim to believe amen they claim to believe because the holy spirit in them quickens the word for their day and all of a sudden they are doing the greater works brother branham i was listening to that day at calvary he says the greater works is to impart eternal life to others i don't give you the holy ghost i give you the way to get the holy ghost amen repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and you shall receive the baptism of the holy ghost whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose back and forth up and down whichever way you want it you want a bond you want to lose all power is given to you to do it amen impart eternal life to those you come in in contact with amen so our fortification brother branham says is the holy spirit and our weapon is faith to believe amen we're not stomping around we don't go around yelling war cries and taunting satan right that is not our places to go around our place is to stand our ground and when he comes in we beat him so badly that he doesn't ever want to come back again that he's in the hospital recovering they got to keep sending new demons because they get beat up so badly every time they come at us it would be a beautiful thing that satan would be the one that is frustrated on a daily basis amen and the bride of christ will frustrate satan on a daily basis amen amen we stand our ground we've talked a lot about walking in the last little while but now we're talking about a message that tells you to stand your ground when you've walked to where you're supposed to be stay there and don't let anybody in amen stand your ground don't back up amen says in every man or woman that has an experience with god has met the same pillar of fire upon the sacred grounds of your heart there's no theology theologian no devil no nothing paul said nothing present nothing future death sickness or sorrow can separate us from that love of god that's in christ jesus he says it's a tie post you know something happened no matter how much science raises up and says this that or the other you are tied you've got to have a place where you anchor your experience with god i love the story of sister barnes that brother gerald tells you know where he says what happened satan finally hit ground zero right where she was sealed and when he hits that it's like brother bran said what a live wire and he gets 20 000 volts through his body because he finally hits where that life is he's worked through all the emotions and the ideas and the thoughts and he's hit the holy spirit that sealed her soul and all of a sudden the jolt hits him and he starts stepping back and that's your boo devil moment amen when he hits the thai post that's when he makes the mistake amen he says you and god become one he's in you you are in him at that day you'll know i'm in the father the father me i and you and you and me you are tied to him he says paul had a christ-centered life it was a different life than once he had he once had an educational conception we know a lot about the message we know a lot about christ we know a lot about the word for our day he says but now he's got a christ-centered life an absolute is it it's the new birthday amen the the thai post the anchor that we have is our new birth which is when we receive the holy spirit amen our new birth is not when we say lord i accept it's lord when i receive that is our new birth because if you still have the old life in you how can you have a new birth you have to have a new life and that is the life of god which is the holy spirit amen and that way when satan comes and beats on you no matter how far he pushes eventually he's going to hit that that what do they call it the the bedrock right when you build a foundation there's bedrock and when you hit bedrock you don't go any deeper that's the firm foundation and when he hits that holy spirit when he hits that sealed soul he can't go any further and he stopped dead in his tracks and all of a sudden you start pushing back amen ephesians 6 12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that's quite an order that's quite an army that's placed against us he says wherefore take under you the whole armor of god that ye may be with able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so you're not going to stand if you don't take what he's given you but after you've taken what he's given you then stand after you've done everything you can stand don't move stand don't fall back don't turn your back stand stand stand right don't walk back your belief don't walk back from your promise don't walk back from your confession stand on what he's given you and take everything he's given you to armor yourself fortify yourself in the holy spirit do not negotiate do not second best do not second guess do not have a conversation about it stand your ground resist him and he will flee from you amen satan always wants to have a talk satan's a talker and you see it from the very first time in eden satan wants to have a conversation and it's usually about the word but it's a twisted word because he did the same thing with jesus amen he wanted to have a conversation about the word didn't he satan always comes in he wants to have a little chat about what just happened about what you're confessing about what you're believing right about the service that just happened and it always starts with hey that was pretty good wasn't it but but but are you sure right he's not coming in to build you up in the faith he's coming in to chip away at it bit by bit amen how do we know who's talking to us sometimes god does challenge us doesn't he but you got to judge it by the word and that's how you're going to know if it's satan that's talking or if it's god that's talking to you amen if it's the holy spirit or if you've got a demon that's trying to push in on you as you compare it to the word and say is he saying exactly what the word says in the balance of the word because he can quote the scripture but if it's out of balance and it's not put from genesis to revelation then satan's got a tool he can use against you if you're not ready for it amen amen brother brown said god has always respected any man who will stand first firm on his promise oh it looked like a dark time when shadrach meshach and abednego with their hands tied behind them and as it was the king said you know throne said now boys if you want to make a little compromising here and would like to change your decision we'll give you a chance but you know that doesn't belong a compromise in the heart of a believer who solemnly set on thus saith the lord amen oft times the greatest challenge is not when you when you come up and you you confess or you're prayed for you're claiming your healing it's after right it's after that the real battle is a lot of times it's just getting the courage to come up maybe or to speak it out loud right but after that is when the battle is is will you hold your ground that you've taken will you stand where he's placed you and having done all put on what he's given you stand there amen amen amen and the problem is is when you're asking for or believing in something that you can't see because now you've got to go 100 percent by faith amen you can't feel what's happening in you you can't feel a change in your character you can't feel a change in your body necessarily but satan's going to come in and say well then it didn't happen you can't see it you can't feel it so nothing happened right and so what does he what's brother brand saying he say he'll give you an opportunity to change your mind walk back your experience walk back what just happened walk back your confession or maybe just take it back to say well i was looking for victory but i'll take a fall every once in a couple months i'll be okay with that because that's better than i was yesterday or last month or last year but that's compromise amen we're talking about total victory now we're not talking about just one victory but we're talking about a victory that takes us all the way through where satan is completely harmless where satan has no access to our lives amen a compromise doesn't exist in the heart of a believer brother branham said they won't step back they won't repent they won't take back their confession they won't take back their their profession and they will not negotiate to lesser the pain or the extent of the battle amen they will not back away israel wins a great victory here verse 22. okay so they're all celebrating yeah yeah we won we won the prophet came to the king of israel verse 22 and said to him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee great victory guess what he's coming again great victory he's coming again and again and again and again the amplified says the prophet came to the king of israel and said to him go fortify yourself and become strong and give attention to what you must do for at the first of next year the king of return of syria will return against you he says become strong he wasn't strong oft times when we're claiming victory we are not strong and it's god's grace it's god's sovereignty it's god's power that gives us the victory but he says become strong you need to step up here you've got to bring something to the next battle it's not going to be purely me next time you're going to have to do a work here you're going to have to obey the prophet here and strengthen yourself and watch because at the turn of the year he's going to come at you again amen amen you won the battle but the war isn't finished they just won a battle against the heavily favored enemy with more people more technology more weapons horses and chariots all these things and he says they're coming at you again get ready for it amen but god doesn't say don't worry next time i'll do the exact same thing god won this victory 7232 against 127 000 that was god's victory nobody would think otherwise but he doesn't say i'll do the same thing again now just sit back relax get fat and happy was he saying go prepare yourself go strengthen yourself don't sit back sharpen the swords get the armor ready get your shields ready add people to the army have scouts out looking for the enemy so that when he comes next time you aren't surprised but you're fully prepared for it amen after the victory is the time to prepare for the next battle that's the time to get your wounds healed up that's the time to get your fitness up that's the time to build yourself up in the face so that when he comes again you're ready for him the mountaintop is not where we get our growth nothing grows on the mountaintop it's snow and ice and wind right and little tiny liking you know what lycan are they're just little fuzz on rocks okay you're not getting anything that grows at the top of the mountain it's a wonderful experience you get a great view you get to enjoy the effort you just put in and then you got to go down and into the valley and climb another one amen because satan not off times he attacks but he doesn't always attack exactly what you're asking for a lot of times his attack is to distract you in another area so that he can get you running around there and then the chance is to come in and take what you originally had right because if satan can't beat you in one spot he's going to go after another spot and try and attack you there right he's going to shift his attack constantly and try and keep you off balance try and take victory away from one place when you've won it in another man he's going to try and take land that he hasn't had before to replace the land that you just took back from him amen amen if you're ready for the second attack it'll help you hold what you got the first time amen and god's giving israel a part to play here like i said he doesn't say i've got you covered next time they come in i'm going to do a miracle-working battle and once again you'll be victorious he gives them a natural part to play and guess what the thing is we are god's natural part to play in this battle amen right he works in men and women he works in the bride of christ he doesn't just sit up there and do all this thing in the heavens and speak things into existence no he he uses warriors he uses a bride group amen to beat satan on this earth so with us we have to do the same thing we have to strengthen ourselves after victory we have to build ourselves up in the faith we have to be ready for the next attack and sometimes the next attack is the next day isn't it brother chad sometimes it's the next week and sometimes you get a moment because satan's really got to build up a big one to get you but he's going to come again and you've got to be ready for it amen verse 23 the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we 7 232 against 127 000 because they're gods or gods of the hills but let us fight them again in the plane and surely we shall be stronger than they what is it satan doesn't defeat you in the hill so he takes it out to the plains right satan can't take away your victory over the healing of your body so what does he do he attacks your marriage he attacks situations in your job he attacks the leadership he says look god is a god of healing but he's not a god of relationships in marriage god is a provider but god's not a leader he's saying your god only works in certain areas you only have victory in certain parts of your life god's only good for limited things for you and we're going to take you on in a place where god has no strength in your life that's what he's saying he's saying your god is limited verse 24 and they said and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms they said the other problem was our leadership was horrible last time you guys were all drinking yourselves drunk when there was a battle to be fought they said kick the kings out build an army just like okay it's the next verse so take the kings out put captains in their place put men of war in their place not drunks put men that know how to fight give us the leadership we need and then we're going to beat them amen verse 25 says and number the army like the army thou has lost horsefull horse chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plane and surely we will be stronger than they and he hearkened under their voice and did so they said build the exact same army horse for horse chariot for chariot man for men another 127 000 of them it's a big army to rebuild but take it to the plane and we'll beat them in a new area they don't have protection out there their god doesn't work out here so we'll definitely get them this time amen verse 26 and it came to pass at the return of the year that ben hayden had numbered the syrians and went up to aphec to fight against israel the prophet was right they're going to come again verse 27 and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country i like that it says all of them were present they were all ready they had all heeded the word of the prophet the king had heeded the word of the prophet and all of the israelites were ready they were trained they had their weapons ready they had their armor ready and they were ready to go out for battle they answered the call amen they obeyed the word of the lord that came through the prophet amen that's where i want to be amen when he says prepare for battle i want to be prepared for battle and then when the battle comes regardless of what it looks like i want to step out and say all right i did my part i'm standing here lord use me amen but that wasn't enough for everything that they had done they're still staying in front the scripture says they were like two little flocks of kids they're like a little group of baby goats not even adult goats baby goats in front of this army amen so if anything it's worse than before baby goats fighting an army amen having done all to prepare themselves currently speaking there's still no match for the army that lays in front of them but the backslidden king had obeyed the lord and prepared the army and he'd done his portion amen that's all we have to do do our portion obey him obey him prepare yourself prepare for battle amen and then we look to him and say now the battle is yours lord we've done our part we're here for you to use use us as best you can amen amen verse 28 and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord israel didn't go out on the word of the prophet they went out because they had to fight and then the prophet then the man of the of god comes in and he says all right this one god has your back yet again because they have challenged me they haven't challenged you they've challenged me they have said god has no power here i'm going to show them that i have power anywhere they want to meet me and the victory again will be mine not yours but they stepped out without a promise they stepped out because they had obeyed the word of the lord and then the promise comes and says i'll give you the victory amen it's another emotion it's another time where they had to step out in faith put themselves in the array for battle and then god comes on the scene amen verse 29 and they pitched over against one another seven days and so it was in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians a hundred thousand footmen in that day hundred thousand men on the plains i guess he was god of the plains after all amen but the rest fled to apec into the city and there a wall fell upon 27 000 of the men that were left and ben had fled and came into the city into an inner chamber have you ever noticed with believers they get lucky a wall falls on 27 000 men that doesn't just happen amen when things are going on in your life and all of a sudden a way is made where there was no way this isn't luck this is the provision of god to fulfill his word in your life right that's when walls fall on 27 000 of your enemies he didn't leave that all to israel god knocked a wall over and killed 27 i don't know how that happens i don't know how that happens but 27 000 men he finished the rest of them off and the only king only one that's left is the king he says he runs into the city and hides in an inner chamber it's the only one left is the king amen they wiped out a hundred thousand men god took care of the other twenty seven thousand men amen they obeyed god they stepped on the battlefield then god appeared on the battlefield and they wiped another army out 254 000 people died in ben hayden's army in a year that's a lot of losses to take it's just him left now it's just him left amen what brought them the victory obedience to god to strengthen themselves prepare for war amen and as long as we are here we have to prepare for war and then satan doesn't give up satan doesn't stop satan doesn't take a beating and then say that's enough i'm never going back there again he repairs he rebuilds and he comes back and he attacks again amen all they had to do was show up and start swinging their swords god took care of the rest we sing that song you know about david it says he flung the rock god did the rest that's all he's looking for you to do use your weapon amen use the word of the lord step out in faith step in behind the shield of faith and start swinging and you'll kill a hundred thousand demons and then they'll flee before you and then god will crush the restroom psalms 18 46 says the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord upon the heat among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name david recognized david had many great victories and he gave all of it back to god and said this is the working of the lord in my life he always showed up he always showed up and then he trusted the lord to bring the victory amen amen but you've got to be ready like i said the sword has to be sharp how are you going to use the word if you never read it right how are you going to have faith if you never build it up right right faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word we've gone through this amen how are you going to get fit if you're not testing right if you're not pushing yourself and you don't push yourself to go out and fight a demon what are you doing you're giving yourself endurance in the lord right to get yourself into the harness to put your shoulder to the wheel to press on the things that are still in your life amen you keep fit by practicing against what's available and then when that when when soldiers are practicing they've got the posts you know we use guns now so what do they do today they go out on the shooting range and they practice shooting don't they they do live fire exercises where they use real ammunition they have fake targets that they try and blow up but in those days you had you're fighting with swords and bows and arrows so what they do they go out there and they hack at posts in the in the ground to build up their strength for the sword and then they'd use fake swords or dulled swords against each other to build themselves up right they used whatever was around them they may not be fighting satan but they'll work on whatever they have and they chop down those trees with those swords just building them up amen and god has little things around us we we deal with things in our marriages and our children even within the church and you've got little situations and those are just there to build up your strength for the big battle amen if we're using big strength against each other we've got a problem right you weren't you didn't battle with another soldier to hurt them you battled to train you were there for their their benefit you weren't there to try and knock them down you were there to help build up their muscles and they were going to build up your muscles right you kind of provided a battering ram for each other you know somebody just hit on but it was with training swords you never were trying to hurt each other but you were encouraging each other you know do this do that i see a weakness here i see a weakness there you weren't battling each other you were building each other up you were helping train each other amen the crazy thing that happens here so ben hayden is the only one left we won't read it but he asks for mercy and ahab gives it to him ben haddad has come against them twice threatened to wipe them out he finally has him at his mercy and he says i'll let you go i'll let you go you've been tormenting israel for all these years and i'll let you go verse 42 just jump down there it says and he said unto him so the prophet comes to ahab he says thus saith the lord because thou has let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria prophet said that man was appointed to destruction at your hand and you didn't do it i gave him into your hand i put your enemy in your power to kill him and you didn't do it you have mercy on him he actually calls him my brother that's how backsliding ahab was when he came to a place to actually have victory he said i'd rather have the brotherhood of an idolater as well than to take his life the prophet said here he says they're appointed for destruction it's the same thing for us there are things that are appointed for destruction in your life and he says when it's in your hand do not stop do not hold back do not let it go do not compromise do not back out you put it you put it down until it can't get up amen when god puts victory in your hands you don't show mercy and i'm not talking about people i'm talking about demons i'm talking about issues i'm not talking about killing people i'm talking about killing what they're bringing to the table amen what they're bringing against you we don't attack people we look for what's behind them the influence that's upon behind them amen satan's the accuser and the oppressor of the children of god he's not going to stop his only chance he has no chance but his only chance is to stop us and so it doesn't matter how badly we beat on him or any minion or demon that he throws at us he's going to come back the next day and the next day and the next day like i said brother braham said he said say good things one thing about satan he's a good enemy he keeps coming and coming and coming why they're wired to do it they are wired to attack us that's the only hope they have of not being cast into health and destroyed is if they can hold us back so he said you cannot play around with this this is not a time for mercy kill it do not compromise do not hold on to it do not say you can hang around occasionally put it out of your life completely amen look at this when david went up to goliath goliath was dead he knocked him down with the stone goliath was dead what did david do cut the head off and held it up right that's what we're looking to do you don't just leave it there cut the head off make sure that it is done and it'll never step up again amen there is total victory there's absolutely total victory for the believer satan's going to throw things at you and he'll never stop doing that your victory is not that satan will never throw things at you it's that he will never have influence in your life that he can't get you running to his tune as opposed to the purpose and plan of god amen turn to second kings 13 if you wouldn't we'll look at another example i want to drive in this idea that you never back down you never hold back you never take it easy you never compromise second kings 13 verse 14 it says now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness wherever he died so he's he's dying here and joash the king of israel came down unto him josh was a good king and wept over his face and said oh my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof now remember we just read where it said that israel didn't have the horses and chariots i love what he says here he says elisha was the horseman and chariots of israel he was the voice of god that kept them going and being and doing what they needed to do and be and where they had to be amen elisha the voice of god in their midst is what kept israel and he says you are the strength of israel you are the one that that allowed us to have these victories amen when god was speaking through and elijah said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window eastward and he opened it and elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians and aphid till thou hast consumed them now we just read where they came to aphec to fight do you remember that so first they came up to samaria then the second thing is they they came to aphec to fight and that's where they were defeated totally except for ben haydad was left alone right so this is people that are coming to fight in the place that god gave them their last great victory over syria he says there's an arrow of deliverance he says the lord has given you victory and then you'll have victory over them and this arrow is a representation of that the arrows are a representation of victory verse 18 he says take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed so what's he saying he's saying take victory in your hand and strike with it use it use that victory to drive that devil into the ocean where he can't come back him and put him down for good this is your way to defeat the syrians so strike with your victory and the king strikes the ground but he only strikes it three times he only struck three times right he doesn't guarantee victory with three because he knows they're going to keep coming back and back again the prophet's mad he says you should have kept going you should have struck until you knew that there was no way that they were going to be able to replenish their armies and come after you you should have kept going the man of god was wrath and said to him thou should have smitten five or six times then thou would have smitten syria till thou had consumed it resinal you'll only smite them three times but thrice says you're only going to get three victories over them and it's not going to be enough you should have kept hitting you should have kept throwing the arrows into the ground until you knew that that would be enough to destroy them amen what's he saying fight until there's no one left to fight right don't settle for we've brought them down to a thousand warriors left we've got more than them so that's enough he's saying no he should have went until you had utterly consumed them until you destroyed them completely amen you left a wounded enemy what's the most dangerous enemy in the in the animal kingdom the most dangerous is the wounded because they'll turn on you in a second they'll be laying there and you walk up to them you think they're dead and all of a sudden you're in there you're in their stomach you know because why they're just conserving their strength they draw you close and then they'll consume you themselves amen so you say how do i do that brother jonathan how do i destroy how do i destroy something in my life completely like i said you're never going to stop them from coming against you it's always going to come against you but one thing is is once you've defeated satan in an area and he tries again and he can't get in he tries again he can't get in he's going to switch tactics right because you'll see as you mature in christ that there's certain things you don't ever have to fight again you have thoroughly defeated them but what has happened is that as he's come up you've defeated him time and time again now you say how do i defeat him the first way you defeat him is you don't give him any attention in the first place right whatever you have been praying for whatever you have claimed whatever you have confessed whatever you're professing you don't acknowledge satan when he comes and tries to challenge it you don't have the conversation you don't open the door right you don't let him in the house you don't let him you know call you on your cell phone you don't acknowledge him and when you ignore him he can't do anything about it amen but the bible says this the faith that took away unbelief will resurrect it again amen when you take your stand for jesus christ stay there and die by it what god says is the truth and don't you fear satan hasn't got anything to do about it don't argue with them don't fuss with him just ignore him and walk away if you fuss with him he will keep you fussing night and day amen so let me stop there because i want you to catch that first line it says the faith that took away unbelief will resurrect it again why you have faith you're a believer you have faith and you can bring back what you have thrown out when you disbelieve because disbelief is a different kind of faith right it's a different kind of faith and it's a faith that allows things back into your life people that think bad things when i say bad things think unfortunate things and all this is going to happen and that's going to happen guess what it usually does because that's where their faith is and that's where their confession is so he says whatever it is that you used the faith that you used make sure you keep using it to keep the victory and don't allow it to slide over and start disbelieving because when it switches from faith to disbelief then all of a sudden it's going to start having a way to come back into you amen amen he says see well you'll say well you're not healed you'll say well now look satan i want to tell you something remember satan wants to have a conversation he says don't say it just say get away i don't want to hear nothing about you and walk on and say thank you lord go on see don't pay any attention to it he says remember when the unclean per spirit is gone out of a person it walks in dry places and returns back again with seven other spirits worse than it was and if it can it'll enter in and take over and the condition will be much worse but if the good man of the house isn't there which is your faith to keep it away he says don't fight at it it'll fight you back just refuse just ignore it that's all just go on just say it's over and that settles it for good amen don't dwell on the negative that's what he's saying because that's absolutely satan right the holy spirit is not negative to the word of god amen it is not negative to your confession brother braham is talking about mark 3 27 where he says no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house and then we've heard in the last few services how the holy spirit will do what raise up a standard amen you're not the strong man or the strong woman in your life okay so if you think that binding the strong man or the strong woman in your life is binding you then you've already lost the battle brother brown says it is faith that is the strong man and that faith can only be through the power of the holy spirit in your life upon the revealed word of god for your life amen amen but through christ through the holy spirit we can do all things because what he strengthens us right and we're resting in the finished work of calvary we're resting in our justification we're resting in the stripes that he took at calvary we're resting in the shed blood amen amen you give preeminence to the faith-building habits to the faith-building people so that no doubt can enter in amen matthew 12 43 says when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none so he says satan's put out sometimes brother brown said sometimes he doesn't he doesn't put out he just leaves he's go he goes looking seeing if there's maybe somebody he can use more effectively and then he comes back and sometimes he's kicked out and he tries to come back right so he says he walks around for a while verse 44 says then he say thou returned unto my house from once i came out and when he's come he findeth that empty swept and garnish so that demon that influence whatever it is it comes back and says hey i haven't found anybody so maybe i'll go try that that guy or that girl that i was with before see if i can influence them again see if i can get into their life he says and when he comes back he finds their life what empty swept and garnished so there's nothing there but it's super clean and it says garnish that means it's got little decorations in it just little things to make it look beautiful welcoming but there's nobody there it's waiting for something but there's nothing in it amen brother brahm says this he says now what just happened an evangelist comes through they preach repentance and you clean up from your sin and then when you're cleaned up the devil goes away from you you take your things back that you stole you go confess your wrongs to your wife or your husband you really clean up and then the thing of it is you're just clean and make a really good target for the devil i want to read that again he says and the thing of it is you're just clean and make a really good target for the devil place for him to come back because it's empty it's clean but it's empty i guess demons like clean things gives them lots of room to play around amen why what is it after a special meeting after a youth convention after special services what is it everybody's feeling all cleaned out right all fresh in the holy spirit and life is good and god is moving brian what do we do we go home we get rid of those things i remember after youth camps a lot of times back when cds were still a thing they'd have a cd burning fire at every youth camp where everybody brought the music they knew they shouldn't have been listening to and what they do they burn it right they cleaned out the their lives right they swept out everything they got out the dust and the cobwebs and the filth right lebron says that makes you a perfect target for the devil if that's all you do amen why because that's only a starting place you need to be sanctified you need to have a clean life but that's not enough brother branham he talks about it because it says the scripture says empty he says empty is idleness that's what's the matter with converts today as soon as you get converted you start idling around because why you have this wonderful feeling of cleanliness for the first time in your life because you've been baptized you've repented you've gotten all this weight off your shoulders like christian you know in the in pilgrim's progress he walks up to calvary and what happens is the great burden falls off of his back and all of a sudden he realizes what it's like to only feel his weight and not the weight of all of his sins right you're clean you're running around woo praise the lord praise the lord i'm saved i'm saved and all it is is you're clean you've lost the burden but that's not all there is he said you ought to be over there on your knees seeking god for the baptism of the holy ghost to be filled up you're empty but he says you've got to be filled up then you've got a wall his blessed presence with you and when the enemy comes in like the line in the den that night with daniel the light of god shines out and he gets away from you if the good man of the house hasn't got it garrisoned he says certainly what you've got to fill in what you've cleaned out you can't just take out the world and leave it empty otherwise that just makes a place for them to come back in again they've got a bunch of room to fill up and not only that because you cleaned it out they've got room for even more amen right yeah verse 45 says then go with he the demon and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation worse you say brother jonathan you go to a camp you have a great service you go to special meetings you go to men's meetings and you can come back and in six months you're worse than when you went that's what it says if you don't have the holy spirit that's all it is is you're getting into a vicious cycle of clean dirty clean dirty clean dirty and the thing is you get dirtier the longer that cycle goes on until you break the cycle and say lord i need the holy spirit to fill up what's what's empty inside of me now amen he says god made you a place that could be emptied now you can't just polish the old life up because that's what you're doing is you're cleaning everything out and you're polishing it up you're making it look good but that's not the new life that's not the new birth that's just cleaning your life up that's just sanctification he says you can't give the old life a facelift i was right old wife you can't give the old life a facelift she's got to die in a new life be born in her she doesn't need some manicure or what it is you need or what it is you put on your lips that you women do you know to make them look better she doesn't need a hair curling she don't need the lip stuff the church needs a birth and a filling of the holy ghost amen the church needs a birth and a filling of the holy ghost you can attend church until you're blue in the face and if you don't walk out with the holy spirit doesn't matter how much he's present here if you don't walk out with them you're defeated already amen amen we don't come to church to get to to to experience the holy ghost he's got to be with us day in and day out and like i said when you leave a service and you you've accepted something from god he's got to be there with you when you go home and it's just you and the four walls amen you've got to have something that's filled the empty place in your life and it's constantly filling and refilling and expanding and pushing out and pushing out amen amen we don't come to church to find god he has to be an experience that we have every minute every hour every day every week every month what is it 365 days a year every year that is the experience of the holy ghost and the true believer amen and it's got to be there whether anybody's looking whether mom and dad are looking over your shoulder whether your spouse is looking over your shoulder whether the pastor's there whatever it is you've got to have him there regardless of what he what anybody's doing i saw at the baptist church yesterday at the school it said character is what you do when nobody's looking amen amen the holy ghost will give you character to live the life regardless of anybody looking over your shoulder you know and then when you got the holy ghost now you've got the garnishment see the thing is they're making it pretty for something but they don't have that thing in there get the thing in there and then you can suit the garnishing to the taste of whatever's in there amen remember brother brown said you know you've got a uh he talked about smoking man's filter and and these different things he said you've got a holy man's taste and it's what the holy spirit pulling things through the filter of the word so now you start to garnish your life you start to add in these little things to enhance what the holy spirit's effect in your life things that would please god in your life right not just taking out but now you've got to add according to his taste according to his preference according to his will and according to what he likes amen because why you've got to be able to handle the rigors the rigors of a christian walk without somebody next to you backing you up every time amen i love david because of that he didn't look for backup he ran towards the enemy he says i can take care of this myself right god's with me i'll take care of it and it's the same thing for believers we're here to help each other but sometimes like sister barnes you don't have somebody there you can't call the pastor your spouse isn't there and you're going to have to deal with satan one-on-one and you've got to be able to say the holy spirit is in me and that gives me full and complete authority and power to boot him out of my life every single time amen let's turn to first samuel 30 as we start to close one more example first samuel 30 and we'll read it verse one for samuel 30 verse 1 says and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten zig leg and burned it with fire so this is where david had lived in the in the land of philistia right he had his own city given to him his men and their wives and children and whatnot and they had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so the amalekites come in they take everything they don't kill anything they're not there to kill they're there to take away so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep there's going to be things in life where you're going to be sad you're going to be sorrowful genuinely sorrowful right there's no there's no guarantee of an easy walk for the believer and david's two wives were taking captives ahem the jezreelitis and abigail the wife of nabel the carmelite amen this is about the worst scenario you could think of as a leader okay you're in a land where you're not supposed to be he's in philistia he's not supposed to be friends with the philistines so he's in the place he's out of the will of god here he's not supposed to be here he comes back and he and everything he owns is burned or stolen away so he's lost his family he's lost his children and so have his men and he has nothing left to come back to everything's taken away and everybody's weeping everybody's crying everybody's mad this is not a good day in david's life amen but i want you to catch the thing as we start to read through this is that david knows he's still the anointed king amen even out of the will of god he's still the anointed king and so david isn't sitting here and saying oh no oh no oh no what are we going to do david has a place to go to amen and even in this backslidden condition and that's what it is he was backslidden he was out of the land of israel right god took care of him in israel he came to the philistines because he wanted a break from the battles he wanted a break from saul chasing him down all the time he wanted to get away from having to look over his shoulder every day and wonder where's the trap set today where's the trap set today where's the trap set today and he got away from knowing that god was his strength he didn't he didn't want to trust god anymore he wanted to just get out from under the battle and sometimes that's it isn't it sometimes what you're doing is you'll give in a little bit to satan on something just to keep them from pushing you harder right sometimes you'll look at something you'll watch something you'll see something you'll do something because that's what he's asking you to do but you know that if you do it then he'll give you a break that's a scary place to be but you may not realize it now go home and think about it and say when is the last time i've done something i really shouldn't have and why did i really do it and what you'll find is you'll say i wanted a break i wanted a break and what it is is satan has been fighting you and fighting you and you give in and say i don't want to fight anymore so i'll do a little bit of what he wants me to do and he'll let me go for a little bit but the thing is that's just one step and then the next day he'll do the next and now you get a trend and you get a pattern all of a sudden you've got an addiction you've got a habit you've got wrong friends you're going into the wrong situations and all the same pro all of a sudden satan has a foothold in your life right because why you're trying to get a break from the battle and that's what david was doing here amen verse six says and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and first daughters david has 400 men that follow him around and they'll do anything for him remember they fought all the way to bethlehem to get him a a drink of water okay that's how much they love david they left their families or you know they they were not left their families because obviously they had them but they left everything they had follow him they were outcasts with david they loved david and they respected him and they believed he was going to be the king but at this point they turn on him and they're ready to kill him that's how mad they are right it says but david encouraged himself and the lord is god the amplified says david encouraged and strengthened himself and the lord is god why like i said david even his backs and conditions knows he's still the anointed choice of god for the kingdom and he knows that if he goes to god god will still direct him god will still give him leadership and god will still allow him to see what he has to do in this situation and god will make a way now there's no guarantee that david gets his family back there's no there's no guarantee that the rest of his men get their men back their families back but david encourages himself because he says god has never left me in a in a condition that i can't get out of it not get out of it himself but that god has made a way that god has put a door in a wall where there is no door right that god is called away solved just as he's about to capture him these different things david has never been pinned down to where he can't get away and so david encourages himself because he has a personal experience with a god that delivers amen that god that leads a god that provides all of these things david has a personal experience and so he's encouraging himself and he's remembering okay this is what he did and he's not just going back to the line and the bear and goliath he's going back to what's happened so recently with saul in these different situations right even to where he didn't have to fight i mean god literally just saved him from having to fight against israel he went up with the philistines and the philistines said to the king they said don't let david he used to be their champion what are you doing putting them in our army we'll be fighting and then he'll turn on us and then we'll lose the battle so god had saved israel for or david from fighting against israel just three days ago and so david encourages himself and he says god's still with me i just need to find him amen he doesn't turn to himself but he knows where the answer lies because we see it in verse seven it says and david said to abiathar the priest the himalayan son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abyatha brought it to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all amen pursue them david not only that but you won't lose a single one i'm going to give you victory over them even in your backslidden condition i'm going to give you victory and then we're going to bring you out because saul will be dead and i'm going to restore you into the kingdom amen david's position as an anointed son of god gave him access to god every time it doesn't matter where you're at we claim the blood but we don't claim the blood to say okay lord i did this and i'm claiming the blood now now i need this no no there's a repentance that comes with that amen but you don't have to sit there and beat yourself up over it right and so david says lord i'm looking for an answer and god says here's your answer pursue and without fail you will recover all what a place to be amen every single one of them is going to come back you're going to get back everything you lost and then we're going to bring you into the kingdom and you'll be king over there amen well you say hold nothing back push hard pursue them don't let the victory slide away it looks bad looks real bad they ran them down they ran so hard to get after them that david couldn't take the whole group with them some of them fell behind did you know that they pursued so hard that they caught up they made up three days in in a very short period of time why they knew that they had the victory and yet some of them still fell by the wayside and they had to keep going on and david actually took him without having all of his men with them he had to amen like i've said before we want our lives to be a personal hell for satan amen we want satan to be asking who was driving the truck that just ran me over because i had them down i had them pinned i had them in a position where they couldn't move and all of a sudden the match is over and their hands raised in victory and i'm laying there wondering what hit me why because it's not based on how it looks it's not based on numbers it's not based on strength it's based on who you are amen amen and on the basis of the promise of god for you he's going to give you that victory amen but he's saying prepare for battle go strengthen thyself joshua 1 9 as the musicians come says have i not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest when you're walking in the land that he has given you he says be of good courage be strong don't be afraid don't be dismayed for the lord god is with thee wither whatsoever thou gost amen let's just stand together this morning if we would what next brother jonathan go strengthen myself amen dwell on the good things of god get the holy ghost if you need the holy ghost and then build a fortification around that and then build a fortification about the infilling of god in your life and let it start pushing out everything that he's that satan's brought against you amen let's just bow our heads together if we would lord jesus lord we're celebrating full victory this lord not just of a grave lord but what that brought to each and every one of us heavenly father lord for we are lord we receive that victory lord we're beneficiaries of that great victory that morning and lord you put every power of satan under our feet lord the weakest christian still has him under their feet lord it is not big eyes and little use it is not just greatness or great that lord your prophet said that demons tremble when the weakest christian gets down on their knees lord when they when they come to you based on their position or based on what you said about them based on what you made them based on what you called them to be heavenly father and lord this morning we want to strengthen ourselves or for the days and weeks that are coming lord we know that satan will try and come back but lord we pray that your word would just raise up a standard that your holy spirit would just spring up lord that we would be quickly aware of what's happening amen lord that we would know when satan's trying to press in however subtly he might do it lord and that we would push him out quickly lord that we would build up ourselves in the faith that we would confess that our profession lord will be matching your word lord your word says that they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and lord we're claiming that blood for every short lord every area of our lives where we fall short every sin lord every bit of unbelief when we're saying lord help us lord we want to believe help our unbelief heavenly father strengthen us for battle lord lord we rest under that shed blood we thank you that you are risen this morning lord that you're living in a people that you called by your name lord and that you promised to bring lord to an expected end lord bless us now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask you amen
