[37:55] turn if you would to John chapter 1
[37:58] John chapter 1 greet each one it's
[37:59] beautiful day supposed to be sunny and
[38:01] warm and looking at the forecast for
[38:04] next week we've got a little bit of of
[38:06] rain perhaps Monday Tuesday and then
[38:08] clear sunshine and warmth for Camp so we
[38:11] thank the Lord for that I uh reached out
[38:13] to brother Aaron Oglesby uh earlier this
[38:16] week and he's preparing and he's excited
[38:18] for Camp so keep him in prayer but I did
[38:21] want to say that brother Paul and Sister
[38:23] Kim are the ones that are managing the
[38:24] camp and they have my full support
[38:26] they've discussed the camp with me the
[38:28] plans the preparations the way of doing
[38:30] things and they have my full approval so
[38:33] they're acting with my full Authority so
[38:36] what I'm asking is if they ask you to do
[38:38] something please do it don't say I think
[38:41] it should be done this way or that way
[38:42] or better way there is no room for
[38:45] opinions at Camp we've already decided
[38:47] so unless it's scripturally off the word
[38:49] we're just going to do it the way that
[38:50] they decide to do it and if you feel it
[38:52] could be done better by all means you
[38:53] can come chat with me after the camp but
[38:56] please don't approach them on changes or
[38:58] anything like that it's set in stone
[39:00] we're doing it the way we're doing it
[39:01] and if they want to make changes they
[39:02] can but it won't be us that makes those
[39:04] changes they got enough on their plates
[39:07] and they don't need us horning in and
[39:08] giving our opinions um like I said
[39:10] unless it's a word matter leave it alone
[39:12] come talk to me after Camp when it's all
[39:14] said and done okay amen I don't mean to
[39:16] be Stern but I want to protect brother
[39:18] Paul and Sister Kim from this they put
[39:20] in a lot of effort and uh they don't
[39:23] need any hassle from from any of us
[39:25] frankly amen so Let's uh let's keep
[39:28] remembering that in prayer let's keep
[39:29] the services in prayer I think we're
[39:31] going to have about 70 people is that
[39:32] right brother Paul 65 people coming so
[39:35] obviously there's a lot of people coming
[39:37] that don't regularly attend our services
[39:39] so we trust God to move in their lives
[39:42] amen and in our own as well it's for our
[39:43] benefit but we've got people from the
[39:45] community coming people we've been
[39:47] witnessing to people that have wanted to
[39:48] attend church for a while and so we just
[39:50] want the Holy Spirit to have free reign
[39:52] and so let's come and yes let's have a
[39:54] good time during the day but we're there
[39:55] to grow spiritually amen so let's keep
[39:58] that in mind and also I don't know if
[40:00] they mentioned no service on Wednesday
[40:01] of course since we'll have three this
[40:03] weekend so just keep that in prayer as
[40:06] well as we move into the weekend amen
[40:08] God bless you let's uh let's read in
[40:10] John chapter 1 and we're in a teaching
[40:12] service this morning and I know not
[40:13] everybody loves teaching but I find if
[40:15] we don't set a foundation for the the
[40:17] word then we don't know what we're
[40:18] praising God about we don't know what
[40:19] we're reacting to so this is very much a
[40:22] teaching service this morning in John
[40:24] 1:1 it says he came unto his own and his
[40:27] own received him not but as many as
[40:30] received him to them gave he power to
[40:31] become the sons of God even to them that
[40:34] believe on his name he says which were
[40:36] born not of blood so not born of human
[40:39] reproductive cells nor by the will of
[40:41] the flesh nor by the desires of the
[40:43] flesh nor by the will of man nor nor by
[40:46] the decision of a man he says but of God
[40:49] so he says our birth that we have right
[40:51] now is not of God that's it's by the
[40:53] will of man but God uses us uses that to
[40:56] bring us to to the real birth to the New
[40:58] Birth by the Holy Spirit and that's the
[41:00] basis of the series now because John is
[41:02] drawing a distinction between our
[41:03] natural birth and our Godly birth and he
[41:06] says they are not one and the same thing
[41:08] it's not even of God in and of itself
[41:09] it's not his intended way amen God bless
[41:12] you you can have your seats this
[41:13] morning and we're back to the to the
[41:15] series that we barely started a couple
[41:17] of weeks ago and we're going to continue
[41:20] on this this series on the holy ghost
[41:22] that I've I've titled the token life and
[41:24] I want to take a second service on how
[41:26] the mighty have fallen and we we spoke
[41:28] in that first service and if you weren't
[41:30] there and you didn't hear it then I
[41:31] highly recommend you go back and listen
[41:33] to it again because if you don't you're
[41:35] not going to understand why we're saying
[41:36] the things we are this morning it's the
[41:38] foundation for this and we're going to
[41:40] be building up as we go through this but
[41:42] we spoke in the first series about or
[41:44] the first service about why we have to
[41:46] have a new birth what's the true baptism
[41:47] of the Holy Spirit uh which is the the
[41:50] new birth or the New Birth is the holy
[41:52] spirit which seals our soul to Eternity
[41:54] it's the down payment of our body change
[41:56] amen but the question question we were
[41:58] asking is why do we need a new birth in
[41:59] the first place what's wrong with our
[42:01] birth right now what's wrong with our
[42:03] natural birth and why is it called a new
[42:04] birth why isn't it called a new page why
[42:06] isn't it called a new chapter but yet
[42:08] Jesus comes along and he says to
[42:10] Nicodemus he says except a man be born
[42:12] again he said you have to be born again
[42:15] you need a new birth and it can't be the
[42:17] same as your first birth he says unless
[42:19] that happens he says you cannot even see
[42:21] the kingdom of God and you even look at
[42:23] his disciples and they could not see the
[42:25] kingdom of God until Pentecost
[42:27] they had to have a new birth they
[42:29] thought they understood it they thought
[42:30] they were a part of it and they were but
[42:32] their eyes did not come open until they
[42:34] got the Holy Spirit and the Word was
[42:36] Quicken to them and he said even of
[42:37] Peter now Peter who was a preacher who
[42:40] had signs and wonders yet after the day
[42:42] of Pentecost the prophet of God would
[42:43] say now he was a a what an inspired
[42:46] teacher his eyes were opened he
[42:47] understood who he was and where he was
[42:49] and of course we read where David had
[42:51] said that he was brought into existence
[42:53] and iniquity and that his mother sinned
[42:55] in conceiving him and yet we know that
[42:56] David Avid was born of a of a woman that
[42:59] was married to the father he was born in
[43:01] wedlock and they were God-fearing people
[43:03] and then we read where it said that
[43:04] we've all sinned and come short of the
[43:06] glory of God and that's a birth issue
[43:08] it's a birth issue it's not a
[43:10] personality issue we are not sinful by
[43:12] choice at Birth we are sinful by our
[43:15] birth itself amen we're in a fallen
[43:17] condition but yet so many people can't
[43:19] explain today why we're actually in a
[43:20] fallen condition we can say well Eve
[43:22] sinned or we can say Adam sinned but we
[43:24] can't say why am I sinful why does their
[43:26] sin translate to me why is it that I'm
[43:29] falling because they fell why does she
[43:31] get to make a choice why did Eve get to
[43:33] make a choice and then Adam behind her
[43:34] get to make a choice and I've got to
[43:35] abide by their choice they can't people
[43:38] most can't Mo mostly can't tell us why
[43:40] this is amen and so the question is why
[43:42] are we in a fall condition why is it
[43:44] that humanity is doomed by our births by
[43:46] our bodies and remember we looked at the
[43:49] tree of life which we saw was Christ and
[43:51] we talked about the tree of knowledge of
[43:52] Good and Evil and we spent some time
[43:55] perhaps making someone comfortable about
[43:56] that term eating the tree of knowledge
[43:58] of Good and Evil and we saw that that
[44:00] was a a a description for the physical
[44:02] act of intimacy between a man and a
[44:04] woman between a male and a female
[44:06] perhaps I should say and we saw that
[44:08] after they had done that act they lost
[44:10] access to Christ and you know I I I
[44:12] noticed this in my study yesterday that
[44:14] it's no coincidence that in the
[44:16] scriptures the intimacy between a man
[44:18] and his wife is called knowing his wife
[44:21] it's the tree of knowledge of Good and
[44:24] Evil and it says a man knows his wife it
[44:27] literally is the act of the tree of
[44:29] knowledge of Good and Evil that's where
[44:30] it comes from so we know that and I'm
[44:33] just doing a quick review this morning
[44:35] we know that the pathway to Christ was
[44:36] removed and so what that meant is they
[44:38] did not have the choice to go and spend
[44:41] time with God he could come to them but
[44:44] they were not guaranteed to be able to
[44:46] go to him amen they could pray they
[44:48] could ask he could descend down to their
[44:50] level by his Sovereign will and choice
[44:52] but now they weren't at the same play
[44:54] they weren't on the Level Playing Field
[44:55] they couldn't just say God I I want to
[44:57] talk to you God I want to spend time
[44:58] with you and automatically have that
[45:00] access amen they went from being amateur
[45:02] Gods amen remember Adam was called the
[45:04] Son of God and they went from being
[45:06] amateur Gods now to being Fallen
[45:08] children without the ability to
[45:10] fellowship with God whenever they wanted
[45:12] so by now we ought to know what the
[45:13] original sin was what the Act was for
[45:15] sure but I and I'll try and be delicate
[45:18] for the sake of the the young years
[45:19] amongst us but as we said last time the
[45:22] result of the eating of the fruit ought
[45:24] to tell us what the eating of the fruit
[45:26] was amen if it was eating an apple or an
[45:28] orange or a mango then it ought to be
[45:30] the same thing that we see today if we
[45:32] eat a fruit or anything that that would
[45:33] be along those lines amen but we know it
[45:36] wasn't like that and so I want to jump
[45:37] forward to the New Testament and we read
[45:39] this scripture last time where Paul
[45:41] gives us some insight here and then
[45:42] we'll go back to Genesis to confirm our
[45:44] suspicions on these things so Paul said
[45:46] to this he said would to God that you
[45:48] would bear with me a little in my Folly
[45:50] and indeed bear with me for I am jealous
[45:52] over you with Godly jealousy for I have
[45:55] espoused you to one husband he says I've
[45:57] engaged you to marry one person he says
[46:00] that I may present you as a chased
[46:03] virgin to Christ now notice he says
[46:05] Chase virgin that's a woman that is
[46:07] Untouched by another man except the one
[46:10] that who will eventually be her husband
[46:12] amen she cannot be touched by any other
[46:15] man by his and we would say it today by
[46:17] man's ideas by men's religion by men's
[46:19] denomination by Logic or reason or any
[46:21] of these things he says but I fear lest
[46:24] by any means as the serpent begot wild
[46:27] Eve through his subtlety so your mind
[46:30] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[46:33] that is in Christ now we know that root
[46:35] word for beguile is
[46:36] seduce so he says as the serpent seduced
[46:40] Eve through his subtlety through his
[46:42] craftiness through his shrewdness
[46:44] through his arguments through his logic
[46:46] he says I'm worried that as he did that
[46:48] to Eve so he would do the exact same
[46:51] thing to you today in your minds he did
[46:54] not say he' do the exact same thing he
[46:56] did to Eve to you but he says that he
[46:58] would do to your minds what he did to
[47:00] Eve because we see with Eve he
[47:01] absolutely seduced her mind but he did
[47:04] not stop with her mind and it's the same
[47:06] thing he's trying to do today he's
[47:07] trying to seduce our mind so that he can
[47:10] have control over the body and use it
[47:12] for his purposes and his desires rather
[47:14] than those of the will of God and the
[47:16] word of God Amen and so if we go back to
[47:19] Genesis 3 now we're looking at the
[47:20] serpent and it says now the serpent was
[47:23] more subtle than any beast of the field
[47:26] which the Lord God had made and he said
[47:28] to the woman yay ha God said ye shall
[47:30] not eat of every tree of the garden now
[47:33] now if we just look at the scripture
[47:34] this morning you'll notice that that it
[47:36] says the serpent was more subtle than
[47:38] any other beast of the field so the
[47:40] serpent was not a reptile today he's a
[47:43] reptile he's coldblooded and and he
[47:45] looks completely different but but back
[47:48] then this was a completely different
[47:49] creature and he was the most cunning
[47:51] that word subtle means cunning it means
[47:53] shrewd he could talk he could reason he
[47:56] he had logic he could interact with
[47:59] Humanity he wasn't human but he was the
[48:02] closest thing to a human he was a mammal
[48:05] and and he wasn't the way he was today
[48:07] but I want to just stop right here real
[48:09] quick because what was Eve's
[48:12] problem what got Eve into trouble here
[48:15] she started talking to something that
[48:16] was under her
[48:18] Dominion none of us would go have a talk
[48:20] with a with a dog or with a parrot even
[48:23] something that can speak back to us and
[48:25] have a conversation with a prare it and
[48:27] give it any any power in our life and
[48:30] yet Eve sits and she's talking to
[48:32] something that is to have no power over
[48:34] her but she gives it an opportunity and
[48:37] she listens to it and now she gets under
[48:39] the influence of the serpent but I've
[48:41] mentioned this before but it just for
[48:43] the sake of completeness this morning
[48:44] let's look at Adam because we can't let
[48:46] Adam off the hook here and if we read in
[48:48] Genesis 2 it foreshadows the husband's
[48:50] role and it's reflective of Adam's
[48:52] failure it says Adam said now Eve the
[48:55] woman is brought to he says this is now
[48:57] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[49:00] she shall be called woman he did not say
[49:02] she' be called Eve he says she shall be
[49:04] called woman because she was taken out
[49:06] of man woman literally means out of man
[49:09] she's not called Eve Eve is the name she
[49:11] gets after she falls but after but at
[49:13] this point she is called woman and her
[49:16] name is Adam she shares the same name as
[49:19] her husband because they are one she is
[49:22] Mrs Adam he's Mr Adam we are he is
[49:25] Christ we are Mrs Jesus Jesus Christ we
[49:27] take on his name I am Christian I have
[49:29] no name of my own I take on his amen but
[49:32] she's bone of his bone flesh of his
[49:34] flesh she has no identity but her source
[49:37] which is Adam her origin is Adam and so
[49:40] when God's calling in the garden
[49:41] remember he only calls one name Adam but
[49:43] they both respond they both come to his
[49:46] call their name is Adam and that's a
[49:48] beautiful Revelation to us because we
[49:50] have the same situation with us we don't
[49:52] have any other name except Jesus Christ
[49:54] it says let everything that you do be
[49:56] done in the name of Jesus Christ amen my
[49:58] wife does everything in my name she
[50:00] doesn't do it in the name of Blanc and
[50:01] neis she does it in the name of klet she
[50:04] is Mrs Jonathan klette and I'm
[50:06] responsible for everything she does
[50:07] because she has my name she's a part of
[50:10] me amen we are him he is us that's the
[50:13] Revelation that's the revealing of the
[50:14] mystery of Christ back to perfect unity
[50:16] in this
[50:17] age but watch in verse 24 he says
[50:20] therefore this is a foreshadowing it's
[50:21] pointing past the events that are about
[50:23] to happen it says therefore shall a man
[50:25] leave his mother and his father and
[50:27] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[50:29] shall be one flesh now Adam and and the
[50:32] woman are not husband and wife as we are
[50:34] today amen they are helps they are
[50:37] companions but there's no marriage yet
[50:39] in the way that we would understand it
[50:40] we're in a fallen marriage today
[50:43] compared to what they had in the
[50:44] beginning remember what Jesus said from
[50:46] the beginning it was not so what you
[50:48] have today is not what it was meant to
[50:49] be it's a fallen thing but notice what
[50:52] he's telling he's telling all of the
[50:54] husbands he's saying man cleave to your
[50:57] wife now that word cleave has two word
[50:59] two meanings and they're completely
[51:01] opposite but the one that's meant here
[51:02] is hold closely stay close to your wife
[51:05] why because if you let her get out on
[51:07] her own she's going to get into trouble
[51:10] I'm sorry sisters but that's what the
[51:11] scripture is saying here amen he didn't
[51:14] know he had to do that he didn't know
[51:16] that there was somebody trying to mess
[51:18] with Eve he doesn't know there was
[51:19] somebody there that didn't believe the
[51:20] word and so he just let her do her own
[51:23] thing and what's he trying to tell us
[51:24] he's trying to say men stay close to
[51:27] your wives don't let them go do whatever
[51:29] they want you need to pay attention to
[51:31] where they're going and what they're
[51:32] doing with their time what their
[51:33] relationships are like because if you
[51:36] see something you don't like you need to
[51:37] find out what's causing that and get to
[51:39] the root of it before it causes problems
[51:42] amen us men are supposed to be watching
[51:45] our wives we're supposed to be helping
[51:46] them we're supposed to be caring for
[51:48] them and then in verse 25 it says they
[51:50] were both naked the man and his wife and
[51:52] they were not ashamed nakedness had no
[51:54] meaning to them physical intimacy was
[51:56] not a part of the relationship they were
[51:58] perfectly pure at this point but
[52:00] remember it says the servant was subtle
[52:02] he was crafty and shrewd and so he had
[52:04] the sharp mind he could speak he could
[52:06] Converse and he was in every way like a
[52:09] person like a human except he had no
[52:12] soul a beast has no soul and that's what
[52:15] the serpent was he was an animal he was
[52:17] nearly the same as a human he was
[52:19] upright as we were he walked he talked
[52:22] he looked like us and we see that
[52:24] because when we see God curse him we see
[52:26] that God changes him from what he was
[52:28] then to what he is now amen and it took
[52:31] away his ability to interact with
[52:32] humanity and in Genesis 3 it says the
[52:35] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[52:37] thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed
[52:39] above all cattle and above every beast
[52:41] of the field upon thy belly shalt thou
[52:44] go and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[52:46] of thy life then he says I'll put enity
[52:49] between thee and the woman and between
[52:50] thy seed and her seat and it shall
[52:52] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[52:55] his H heel so his original form was not
[52:58] on his belly writhing around on the dust
[53:00] and the dirt as we see today but that's
[53:03] a curse that God put on him and it
[53:04] changed him from being upright to being
[53:07] now on the ground amen God says I'll put
[53:09] enmity between you and the woman between
[53:11] your seat and her seat he says I'm going
[53:13] to put hostility I'm going to put a
[53:14] barrier there I'm going to make
[53:16] something that causes conflict between
[53:19] you
[53:20] two and he says and and not only that
[53:22] but I'm going to make it impossible for
[53:24] you to do what you do here now and he
[53:26] changes him from his original condition
[53:28] and abilities so if you want to know
[53:30] where the missing link is science is
[53:32] looking for the missing link between
[53:34] humanity and all of the beasts and it's
[53:36] sitting right here in the scriptures and
[53:38] they'll never find it because God
[53:40] changed the serpent in the moment like
[53:42] that and completely turned him into
[53:43] something else so they'll never find it
[53:46] but it's there except it doesn't have a
[53:49] soul but it's a beast it's the link
[53:51] between humanity and the rest of
[53:52] creation it's a creature that's
[53:54] practically human it can interact with
[53:56] with Humanity it can blame with Humanity
[53:58] it's a beast human if we want to put it
[54:00] that way and that's going to be critical
[54:02] as we go through this series on the Holy
[54:03] Ghost because we'll see today that the
[54:05] Beast nature is what we find most
[54:07] prevalent in this world a beast because
[54:09] a beast is a man without God that's what
[54:12] it is and that's what we'll see as we go
[54:14] through this scripture that's why
[54:15] Humanity keeps getting worse and worse
[54:16] and worse is because the Beast nature is
[54:18] being brought out and the god Nature has
[54:20] been completely eradicated at this point
[54:23] so we go back to Eve's conversation this
[54:25] this morning he takes her down a path of
[54:27] controversy because he says are you
[54:29] allowed to do whatever you want to do
[54:31] now Eve is a good believer she has to
[54:32] answer truthfully and she says the woman
[54:34] said to the serpent we may eat of the
[54:36] fruit of the Trees of the garden but of
[54:38] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[54:40] midst of the garden God has said ye
[54:41] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[54:43] touch it and we touched on this last
[54:45] time where she said you're not we're not
[54:47] just not allowed to eat it we're not
[54:49] even allowed to touch it why because
[54:51] with touch comes an awareness and with
[54:53] awareness comes emotions and feelings
[54:55] and with those things comes the act that
[54:57] will follow all of this it has a
[54:59] reaction if you're a healthy human she
[55:01] says and we can't do this lest ye die
[55:04] remember what death is death is
[55:06] separation from God when you get away
[55:08] from God then you die you lose eternal
[55:10] life amen so death is separation from
[55:13] God and Christ fulfills the the the
[55:15] definition of life because he says if
[55:18] you he that believeth in me shall never
[55:20] die and if Eve had believed the word she
[55:23] would never have died she'd have stayed
[55:25] behind it and she' have had eternal life
[55:27] so his word is tied to eternal life and
[55:29] he is tied to eternal life so death is
[55:31] not the fact that we go away death is
[55:33] when we're separated from the source of
[55:35] life which is Christ himself then verse
[55:38] four says the serpent said to the woman
[55:40] ye shall not surely die now this was not
[55:43] the first conversation church because if
[55:45] you tell somebody what you believe and
[55:46] they say that's not true you're going to
[55:48] walk away usually but he's brought her
[55:51] to the point where she will listen to
[55:52] him where she'll consider what he says
[55:55] who knows what Fellowship they've had to
[55:56] this point but Eve here she she missed
[56:01] on her discernment what should she have
[56:03] done we've talked about this before
[56:05] remember what happened to Joseph when
[56:07] when Piper's wife came to him and she
[56:08] tried to seduce him he used his feet for
[56:11] discernment he got out of the situation
[56:14] he didn't sit there and talk he didn't
[56:16] tell her why he couldn't he just walked
[56:18] away he didn't walk away he ran away he
[56:21] struggled to get away from her his Focus
[56:23] was on getting away not in staying there
[56:25] and convince her
[56:26] saving her soul no he tried to get away
[56:29] and he did get away and that's what Eve
[56:31] should have done here today use her feet
[56:34] for discernment get out of the situation
[56:36] she should have went and told Adam what
[56:38] he said Adam would have dealt with the
[56:40] serpent and then they would have never
[56:42] had any more issues but remember the
[56:45] serpent had beguiled her he had seduced
[56:47] her that was a a process over time and
[56:51] all we see now is the consequences of
[56:53] this is that when he cont contradicts
[56:55] the word completely he says something
[56:57] that is completely opposite to what God
[57:00] has said she
[57:02] listens you say how do we get there it's
[57:04] a process of time Church you listen to a
[57:07] little bit different than what you
[57:08] believe what the word says and over time
[57:10] you can go 180 degrees and raise your
[57:13] hand and say I believe that's the word
[57:14] of God and you are wrong wrong wrong
[57:17] sincerely but
[57:19] wrong he says you shall not surely die
[57:22] for God knows that in the day that you
[57:24] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[57:26] opened and you shall be as Gods knowing
[57:28] good and evil now he is not wrong here
[57:31] they're going to know it but they're not
[57:32] going to understand it
[57:35] beforehand he's not giving her the full
[57:37] picture he's not telling her a lie he's
[57:39] telling her a lie in that they shall not
[57:41] surely die they would die but the effect
[57:43] he says you're going to be just like God
[57:45] you're going to know what good and evil
[57:46] are all
[57:48] about it usually sounds pretty good
[57:50] doesn't it when Satan comes our way
[57:52] young people it sounds pretty good but
[57:55] he never tells you the effect or the end
[57:57] result he never tells you the fruit of
[57:59] if you do what he tells you to do
[58:03] listen people don't start doing cocaine
[58:06] just on a
[58:07] whim but something convinces them to do
[58:10] it and they try it and it awaken
[58:12] something in them and now they can't get
[58:14] away from it people will tell them about
[58:16] the the the the joys of drugs of alcohol
[58:19] or sensual uh Pleasures these different
[58:22] things people will tell you about the
[58:23] pleasures of stuff the whole world is
[58:26] trying to get us centered on getting
[58:28] things rather than being something and
[58:30] they won't tell you the effect of it the
[58:32] burnout and the pain and the suffering
[58:34] the effect on your marriage and the
[58:36] people around you and these different
[58:37] things the stresses that come with it
[58:39] but once you do it you get hooked on it
[58:42] and all of a sudden it has fruit it has
[58:44] a harvest that you never understood up
[58:47] front you sure got the pleasure but you
[58:49] get something on the end and they never
[58:51] tell you about
[58:53] that and so the woman saw that the tree
[58:55] was good for food her interest was
[58:57] quickened she she her curiosity was Peak
[58:59] she saw the potential and she saw that
[59:02] it was pleasant to the eyes in other
[59:03] words it was desirable and then it says
[59:05] that it was a tree to be desired and
[59:07] that means pleasurable so she saw that
[59:10] it was desirable and then she s felt
[59:12] that it was pleasurable and she took of
[59:15] the fruit thereof and did eat so she
[59:17] partook of the fruit without her husband
[59:20] there it says and gave also unto her
[59:23] husband with her and he did eat so she
[59:25] part took of it with her husband second
[59:27] she partook of it once without her
[59:29] husband and once with her husband so we
[59:32] know what eating the fruit is we covered
[59:33] that last service it's physical int
[59:35] intimacy between a male and a female and
[59:37] Eve partakes of the fruit without her
[59:40] husband present church so who is she
[59:43] partaking of the fruit with there's only
[59:46] one other creature there and that's the
[59:48] serpent and he's upright he's like a man
[59:50] he is as a man he is in every way a man
[59:53] except he has no soul so her intimacy
[59:56] was with the serpent who seduced her
[59:59] that's what Paul was telling us it went
[1:00:01] from the mind to the body and that's
[1:00:04] what happens when you see people fall
[1:00:05] away from the word is he gets their mind
[1:00:07] and the body follows you know we had
[1:00:09] that believe the sign thing roll through
[1:00:11] and and those people are still living in
[1:00:13] that area and and one of the the wives
[1:00:16] of of one of the ministers was in the
[1:00:17] church getting wine for communion if I
[1:00:20] remember correctly and the man in front
[1:00:22] of her was the man that had tried to
[1:00:24] blow up this message and he had his arm
[1:00:26] full of alcohol and he knew she was
[1:00:28] behind him but he refused to acknowledge
[1:00:30] her and so she tapped him on the
[1:00:31] shoulder and she said hello brother so
[1:00:33] and so and he turned around and you know
[1:00:35] what he tried to do explain why he was
[1:00:36] holding an arm full of
[1:00:38] alcohol why his mind had been seduced
[1:00:40] and now his body was following and now
[1:00:42] he's trying to justify and he says oh
[1:00:44] it's for our
[1:00:46] guests I don't bring alcohol into my
[1:00:49] house for my guests why is he doing it
[1:00:52] because his body has followed where his
[1:00:53] mind was seduced what a shame what a
[1:00:56] shame the mind when it's lost here then
[1:00:58] everything else follows behind it
[1:01:02] amen so we look at that Serpent and we
[1:01:05] think well he's you know we look at a
[1:01:06] serpent today and we look at them and
[1:01:09] they're beautiful so many of them are
[1:01:10] beautiful and that was what he was was
[1:01:12] he was beautiful he was manly he was
[1:01:14] masculine he was muscular and even
[1:01:17] compared to a Son of God he would
[1:01:19] perhaps have been more beautiful even
[1:01:21] than Adam or more handsome than Adam was
[1:01:23] because you look at the beasts you look
[1:01:24] at beasts beasts are muscled up aren't
[1:01:26] they they they're more than a man you
[1:01:29] look at a at cattle or horses and
[1:01:32] they're just muscles on muscles you look
[1:01:33] at at the great cats and these different
[1:01:35] things it's just muscles and and they're
[1:01:37] lithe and they're Sleek he would have
[1:01:39] probably been a better-looking man than
[1:01:42] Adam was and he seduced Eve by his
[1:01:46] Beauty after he seduced her with his
[1:01:50] talk so then seeing that this was an
[1:01:52] enjoyable experience because remember
[1:01:55] she saw that it was pleasurable that it
[1:01:57] was desirable now After experiencing
[1:02:00] that with the serpent she goes to Adam
[1:02:02] and tells him about it and Adam knowing
[1:02:05] that she has been sentenced to death by
[1:02:08] her actions agrees to do the same thing
[1:02:11] with
[1:02:12] her Adam had a choice he could let her
[1:02:15] go and die or he could join himself to
[1:02:20] her and thereby go with her and keep her
[1:02:24] potentially from that sentence of death
[1:02:26] he did it out of love she did it out of
[1:02:29] subtlety she was deceived now if you
[1:02:31] want proof of that we go to 1 Timothy 2
[1:02:34] and and Paul says this to Timothy let
[1:02:35] the women learn in silence and all
[1:02:38] subjection and everybody says not on
[1:02:40] your
[1:02:42] life hey that's where we're at in this
[1:02:44] world today isn't it not on your life it
[1:02:47] says but I suffer he says I don't allow
[1:02:51] and Paul's speaking by the Holy Spirit
[1:02:53] now this is not Paul's word this is the
[1:02:54] Holy Spirit
[1:02:56] but I suffer not I don't allow a woman
[1:02:59] to teach nor to usurp authority over the
[1:03:01] man but to be in silence for Adam was
[1:03:04] first formed then Eve so here's reason
[1:03:06] number one sisters why you can't take
[1:03:08] Spiritual Authority over a man is that
[1:03:11] Adam was created first in the image of
[1:03:14] God that's the perfect
[1:03:17] image okay but that's not the real
[1:03:20] reason that's one of the
[1:03:22] reasons and we'll see why he says but
[1:03:24] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:03:27] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:03:30] so the second reason why women cannot be
[1:03:32] in leadership over men is because Adam
[1:03:35] wasn't tricked but Eve was tricked she
[1:03:38] was seduced she was beguiled but Adam
[1:03:40] went in with eyes wide open because he
[1:03:43] could not bear to be parted with her
[1:03:46] church the nature hasn't changed today
[1:03:48] what was there then is there today and
[1:03:51] so while as men are not perfect by any
[1:03:54] means what any man want to stand this
[1:03:56] morning and say I'm perfect and I have
[1:03:58] perfect
[1:03:59] leadership if you do we're going to call
[1:04:01] you to the Altar and pray for you right
[1:04:02] now because we are not perfect we are
[1:04:05] not in a position of leadership because
[1:04:07] we are perfect we are in a position of
[1:04:09] leadership because we are ordained and
[1:04:12] that is it and we have to grow into that
[1:04:15] the same as everybody else so God help
[1:04:18] us to be humble Brothers amen sometimes
[1:04:21] we need a rebuke and sometimes our wife
[1:04:24] will give it to us look at
[1:04:26] at Moses and his
[1:04:28] wife he's G running to Egypt with with
[1:04:31] the authority of God and he hasn't even
[1:04:34] circumcised his children according to
[1:04:35] the word and his wife says Thou bloody
[1:04:37] husband you've made me do
[1:04:40] this sisters sometimes we have to have a
[1:04:42] hard talk with our husbands but it needs
[1:04:44] to be with
[1:04:46] respect needs to be with respect
[1:04:49] Brothers help us to receive it in
[1:04:52] humility
[1:04:54] amen if God can use a donkey he can
[1:04:57] absolutely use my wife amen God helped
[1:05:00] me not to get to the place where he's
[1:05:02] got to use a donkey because I won't
[1:05:04] listen to my wife from time to time but
[1:05:07] remember what what first Peter says it
[1:05:08] says the woman's a weaker
[1:05:10] vessel because she came out of it she
[1:05:13] came out of the man she wasn't the full
[1:05:15] image she was a part of that image and
[1:05:17] and so as husbands and as as men our
[1:05:19] duty is to honor and help and support
[1:05:23] and encourage and lead the women in
[1:05:26] their lives spiritually now there's a
[1:05:29] natural leadership that comes with that
[1:05:31] certainly the man is the head of the
[1:05:32] household in these things but I want us
[1:05:34] to look at this because it says e the
[1:05:36] woman being deceived was in the
[1:05:37] transgression because we tend to think
[1:05:39] of this the other way we would say
[1:05:41] somebody's not guilty if they don't know
[1:05:44] that what they're doing is wrong and but
[1:05:46] then Adam did it and he went in with
[1:05:48] eyes wide open and you're saying he's
[1:05:49] not in the transgression but the woman
[1:05:51] who was tricked is in the transgression
[1:05:53] Adam knew he was doing wrong the woman
[1:05:55] thought she was doing right and you're
[1:05:56] saying she's wrong and he's right even
[1:05:58] though they both did the same thing but
[1:06:00] we have to look at sin the way God does
[1:06:02] because we look at sin as the attributes
[1:06:03] of sin but that is not what sin is to
[1:06:06] God sin to God is what disbelieving the
[1:06:09] word of God and what Eve did is she
[1:06:12] disbelieved the word and she accepted a
[1:06:15] lie and then she acted on it and she had
[1:06:18] to disbelieve that's what sin is and
[1:06:21] then what come after that is the
[1:06:22] attributes or the actions of her
[1:06:24] unbelief Adam did not disbelieve Adam
[1:06:28] accepted the consequences of his actions
[1:06:31] knowing what he was doing Adam had no
[1:06:34] disbelief he acted in love to preserve
[1:06:38] his
[1:06:39] wife he never disbelieved but Eve
[1:06:41] disbelieved that's why she's in the
[1:06:43] transgression that's why she sinned amen
[1:06:46] so to you to to disbelieve the word you
[1:06:48] have to accept the LIE of Satan and
[1:06:50] that's what she did and that leads to
[1:06:52] death and destruction it feels good at
[1:06:54] the beginning but it's fatal in the End
[1:06:56] Amen So Adam went in eyes wide open he
[1:06:59] was not deceived he was not unfaithful
[1:07:02] to God he didn't believe he didn't
[1:07:03] disbelieve the word of God he wasn't
[1:07:05] fooled he chose to go with her and he
[1:07:07] was a type of Christ why because he's in
[1:07:10] the image of God the attributes of God
[1:07:12] are in him and it's that nature to save
[1:07:14] to preserve to help to support to love
[1:07:17] in the same way that Christ would amen
[1:07:19] he's acting in the image of God by the
[1:07:21] attributes of God that are in him he's
[1:07:23] the son of God that's what the scripture
[1:07:24] says when you look at the geneal ologies
[1:07:26] So Adam didn't sin but he did he went
[1:07:28] into that position of of of that action
[1:07:31] with his eyes wide open and he just
[1:07:34] accepted the consequences knowing full
[1:07:35] well what it would mean now this is the
[1:07:38] only quote we're going to read this
[1:07:39] whole service he says now Adam was not
[1:07:41] deceived Adam knew just exactly what he
[1:07:43] was doing but Eve was deceived and Adam
[1:07:46] did not go out because he had
[1:07:47] transgressed he had not he wasn't
[1:07:49] deceived he didn't go out being because
[1:07:51] being deceived he went out because he
[1:07:53] loved his wife so well he went with her
[1:07:56] he says it's a very beautiful type of
[1:07:58] Jesus Christ knowing no sin but went to
[1:08:01] hell and took our place to redeem his
[1:08:04] wife the church that's just so you know
[1:08:06] that's not brother John that's the
[1:08:08] prophet of God Amen and we'll dig into
[1:08:10] this as we go in because this is what
[1:08:11] the Holy Ghost is given for it's a
[1:08:13] redeeming power it's a redeeming spirit
[1:08:15] it's Christ coming back to us again
[1:08:18] let's finish in second timoth 1 Timothy
[1:08:20] rather and it says notwithstanding she
[1:08:22] the woman shall be saved and
[1:08:24] childbearing if they continue in faith
[1:08:28] and charity and Holiness with
[1:08:31] sobriety so in other words Paul is
[1:08:34] saying childbearing now is a Salvation
[1:08:37] to the
[1:08:39] women it's ironic because childbearing
[1:08:42] is the act is the produ is the the fruit
[1:08:44] of the act that got them into it and now
[1:08:47] he says if you'll raise them in the fear
[1:08:49] and admonition of the Lord if you'll
[1:08:51] stay in the faith if you'll raise them
[1:08:52] in a Godly fashion with sobriety it'll
[1:08:55] save save you from
[1:08:57] yourself it'll keep you in a place where
[1:09:00] Satan won't have the access like serpent
[1:09:02] like the serpent did that's why we we
[1:09:05] generally recommend to our sisters don't
[1:09:07] go out into the workforce if you can at
[1:09:09] all help it or work in certain types of
[1:09:12] it so that you're protected from these
[1:09:14] sorts of things happening to you and
[1:09:16] brothers we always have to keep an eye
[1:09:18] on it we always have to keep an eye on
[1:09:20] it to see if there's a change because if
[1:09:22] there's a change then we've got to
[1:09:24] address it before it gets out of hand
[1:09:27] remember what the prophet said he said a
[1:09:28] woman can be fooled a thousand times
[1:09:31] quicker than a man and the thing is
[1:09:34] she'll believe she's a th%
[1:09:37] right and that's scriptural I'm not
[1:09:40] doing to put the sisters down I'm saying
[1:09:41] make yourself aware brothers that ought
[1:09:44] to make us that much more careful about
[1:09:47] what we bring into the home about what
[1:09:49] we do with our time about what we
[1:09:52] say about how we live our lives because
[1:09:54] the lives are going to
[1:09:57] magnify everything that we do and
[1:10:01] they'll reflect exactly what's been
[1:10:02] around I've said this before if you
[1:10:04] don't like the way your house is the if
[1:10:06] you don't like the way your wife is
[1:10:07] change you cuz she's a reflection of me
[1:10:10] if I don't like my wife guess what the
[1:10:12] problem is this guy right here CU she is
[1:10:15] magnifying what's going on in my life
[1:10:17] every single time God help us
[1:10:20] amen so now if we look at this eve has
[1:10:23] been intimate with two males she's been
[1:10:25] with the serpent she's been with Adam
[1:10:27] and now I know some Bible readers are
[1:10:28] going to say what about Genesis 4:1
[1:10:30] where she says I've had a I've got a man
[1:10:32] from God but we'll address it as we go
[1:10:34] through but I want us to look at the
[1:10:35] effect of eating the fruit just as
[1:10:37] confirmation of what the eating the
[1:10:39] fruit was if it was eating fruit like we
[1:10:41] do today then it ought to have the same
[1:10:42] experience you eat a fruit today all you
[1:10:44] do is have a bowel
[1:10:45] movement maybe an upset tummy she got an
[1:10:48] upset tummy church that's for sure but
[1:10:50] it wasn't because of what she ate in
[1:10:52] that sense amen we still have access to
[1:10:54] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:10:56] the access to Christ was what was taken
[1:10:58] away then it's back now but we've always
[1:11:00] had access to the tree of knowledge of
[1:11:02] Good and Evil so that means we've been
[1:11:03] eating the fruit all along and didn't
[1:11:04] know it perhaps so if we go to Genesis 3
[1:11:07] we read the scripture we just did when
[1:11:09] the woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:11:11] food that it was pleasant to the eyes a
[1:11:12] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[1:11:15] took of the fruit thereof and did eat
[1:11:17] and gave also to her husband with her
[1:11:19] and he did eat now watch the effect
[1:11:21] here's Here's the the harvest here's
[1:11:23] what the action does for them says the
[1:11:26] eyes of them both were opened remember
[1:11:27] what the serpent said he says your eyes
[1:11:29] will be opened here they are they're
[1:11:30] opened and they knew that they were
[1:11:33] naked and they solded fig leaves
[1:11:35] together and made themselves
[1:11:38] aprons why do they know they're naked
[1:11:41] and why are they making
[1:11:42] aprons because when we do a crime we
[1:11:45] always try and hide the evidence of our
[1:11:48] crime don't
[1:11:49] we we become hyper
[1:11:52] aware of any evidence that would give us
[1:11:57] away we try and hide it think of it
[1:12:01] maybe none of you did this but certainly
[1:12:03] there were times where I snuck food when
[1:12:06] I was clearly told don't eat something
[1:12:10] and you know what I made made sure of
[1:12:11] every time after I snuck a cookie or
[1:12:14] piece of chocolate cake or something was
[1:12:15] that I put it back exactly the way it
[1:12:17] was and that I made sure my face was
[1:12:20] clean and my hands were clean so that
[1:12:23] Mama couldn't say did you eat a cookie
[1:12:26] did you eat a piece of cake but you know
[1:12:28] what it is as a young
[1:12:30] kid we don't know what the evidence
[1:12:33] looks
[1:12:34] like and so the parents come up and they
[1:12:36] say did you eat that chocolate cake and
[1:12:38] we say
[1:12:39] no and the parents are saying go look in
[1:12:43] the
[1:12:43] mirror and what do you see you see the
[1:12:46] evidence of your crime before you so
[1:12:49] what do we do we wash our face if we're
[1:12:50] smart we wash our face we wash our hands
[1:12:53] we get rid of all of the evidence
[1:12:55] that could give away the status of our
[1:12:57] crime amen we're trying to hide the
[1:12:59] proof of our Disobedience and so Adam
[1:13:01] and Eve eat the fruit together and the
[1:13:03] effect of that of that is that they
[1:13:05] realize they're
[1:13:07] naked as brother R said if it was an
[1:13:09] apple we need to pass around the apples
[1:13:11] because people are naked now and they're
[1:13:12] reving in it rather than ashamed of it
[1:13:15] but there's shame here why are they
[1:13:16] shamed of their nakedness because their
[1:13:18] nakedness is attached to their sin to
[1:13:21] their crime it didn't just make them
[1:13:23] realize they were naked it it made them
[1:13:24] Ed embarrassed it made them ashamed it
[1:13:26] it made them self-conscious whereas
[1:13:28] before they were they didn't even know
[1:13:29] they were naked and there was no
[1:13:30] embarrassment there they've lost their
[1:13:32] innocence with it and now they've lost
[1:13:34] the Purity with it and they make
[1:13:36] themselves a covering to hide the proof
[1:13:40] to hide the thing that was involved in
[1:13:41] the crime so what do they do they cover
[1:13:45] up themselves and their
[1:13:48] nakedness because that's where the
[1:13:50] trouble
[1:13:51] was why don't they make a mouth covering
[1:13:54] if they ate fruit shouldn't the face be
[1:13:56] covered shouldn't the lips be covered
[1:13:57] shouldn't the head be covered but no
[1:13:58] they make themselves aprons to cover
[1:14:01] their nakedness remember the effect must
[1:14:03] reflect the action the shame must
[1:14:06] reflect the crime and so what we see
[1:14:08] here is that they have a shame of the
[1:14:10] areas that were involved in the crime if
[1:14:12] I eat a cookie I'm not going to put a
[1:14:14] shirt on to cover it up but that's what
[1:14:17] your that's what people would say they
[1:14:18] ate a they ate a fruit and then they put
[1:14:20] a shirt on what does a shirt have to do
[1:14:22] with eating a fruit it doesn't do
[1:14:24] anything for you you it doesn't hide
[1:14:26] anything but their eating had something
[1:14:28] to do with their nakedness and it
[1:14:29] brought awareness that they were naked
[1:14:31] now watch the sequence that follows
[1:14:33] because you look at the questions and
[1:14:35] you look at the answers and it shows
[1:14:36] exactly what happened the scripture is
[1:14:38] perfect and if we can only read it the
[1:14:40] way it is it says and when they heard
[1:14:43] the voice of the Lord God Walking In The
[1:14:44] Garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[1:14:47] and his wife hid themselves from the
[1:14:48] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:14:50] Trees of the garden and the Lord God
[1:14:52] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[1:14:54] art thou and he said I heard thy voice
[1:14:56] in the garden and I was afraid why
[1:14:59] because I was naked and I hid
[1:15:02] myself now for those that are listening
[1:15:04] online and I know there are this morning
[1:15:06] maybe some that have never heard this
[1:15:07] before the scriptures and and whatnot
[1:15:09] will be attached to the YouTube channel
[1:15:11] so if you just go into the the
[1:15:12] description there they're added at the
[1:15:14] end of the services or within a day so
[1:15:16] you can see all these scriptures if you
[1:15:17] want to look at them but he says Adam
[1:15:20] says I hid because I was
[1:15:22] naked and now watch the question that
[1:15:25] God answers comes back to him with and
[1:15:27] he says who told you you were
[1:15:30] naked and then he immediately says did
[1:15:33] you do what I told you not to do he says
[1:15:36] have you eaten of the tree whereof I
[1:15:37] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:15:39] eat God links their their knowledge of
[1:15:41] their nakedness with the actions of the
[1:15:43] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:15:45] immediately and this is not God being
[1:15:46] all knowing this is God knowing what
[1:15:49] happens when you do what he tells you
[1:15:50] not to do God knew that if they ever did
[1:15:53] it they would know about nakedness it
[1:15:55] would take away their purity it would it
[1:15:56] would take away their
[1:15:58] innocence and the man
[1:16:01] said the woman that thou gavest to be
[1:16:04] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[1:16:06] did eat have you ever noticed here that
[1:16:08] Adam kind of subtly puts this on
[1:16:10] God the woman that you gave
[1:16:14] me she made me do
[1:16:19] it what a sad State of Affairs now that
[1:16:21] the Son of God has come to where he is
[1:16:23] implying that God made made a mistake
[1:16:26] that God didn't give him the perfect
[1:16:30] wife God doesn't address it God said to
[1:16:32] the woman what is this that thou Hast
[1:16:34] done and the woman said the serpent
[1:16:36] begal me and I did eat it they're just
[1:16:37] passing the
[1:16:38] buck and the Lord God said to the
[1:16:40] serpent because thou Hast done this does
[1:16:43] he say serpent did you do it he knows
[1:16:46] everything that's
[1:16:48] happened and we know everything he knows
[1:16:51] everything that's happened because he's
[1:16:53] already made a sacrifice so that he can
[1:16:54] eat even have this conversation in the
[1:16:56] first
[1:16:57] place he says to the serpent because
[1:17:00] thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed
[1:17:01] above all cattle and above every beast
[1:17:03] of the field now this is a reversal of
[1:17:05] Fortunes for the serpent because he's
[1:17:06] the Apex Beast he's the highest of the
[1:17:09] high he's the greatest of all the Beast
[1:17:11] and he says now you're cursed from that
[1:17:15] position you're the greatest and now
[1:17:17] you're going to be made the lowest and
[1:17:18] upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[1:17:20] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
[1:17:22] now watch he says I will put enmity
[1:17:24] between thee and the woman I'll put
[1:17:25] hostility between you and her and
[1:17:28] between thy seed and her seed the little
[1:17:30] translation of seed there is Offspring
[1:17:33] so I'll put hostility between your
[1:17:35] Offspring and her
[1:17:38] Offspring he says and it her Offspring
[1:17:42] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:17:44] bruise his heel now there's obviously a
[1:17:46] spiritual element here and a physical
[1:17:48] one in terms of seeds and we'll see it
[1:17:49] as we go God says there'll be hostility
[1:17:51] and hatred between your Offspring and
[1:17:53] her Offspring they can't get along they
[1:17:55] won't get along they're completely
[1:17:57] different and it's a difference that
[1:17:59] cannot be
[1:18:00] mended and then he says unto the woman
[1:18:03] so he's already now cursed the the the
[1:18:06] the serpent now he comes to the woman
[1:18:07] and he said I will greatly multiply thy
[1:18:10] sorrow and thy conception well what does
[1:18:12] that mean he explains it he says in
[1:18:14] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[1:18:18] children not
[1:18:20] child if there's one act it ought to be
[1:18:22] child but he says now it's going to be
[1:18:24] multiplied you're going to bring forth
[1:18:26] children multiple plural and thy desire
[1:18:28] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:18:31] rule over thee Church what did God
[1:18:32] cursing the woman he cursed what caused
[1:18:36] her to fall he cursed the crime area he
[1:18:39] crued her he cursed her he didn't curse
[1:18:41] her
[1:18:43] mouth he cursed her reproductive system
[1:18:46] he cursed her womb he cursed her
[1:18:47] conception he cursed her
[1:18:50] desire he did not curse her hand in her
[1:18:53] mouth if she ate a fruit then he would
[1:18:55] have cursed those things but he didn't
[1:18:56] curse it he cursed what committed the
[1:18:58] sin and he says I'll greatly multiply
[1:19:01] your sorrow and conception in other
[1:19:03] words it'll be painful to bear and
[1:19:04] produce children pregnancy and birth
[1:19:06] will be a difficult process but then he
[1:19:08] says now to make matters worse I'm going
[1:19:11] to put a desire that's built into your
[1:19:13] body for this act on a regular basis and
[1:19:17] your desire will now be towards your
[1:19:19] husband you didn't have it before but
[1:19:21] now you've awakened it and every month
[1:19:22] you're going to have a desire for your
[1:19:24] husband husband whether you want it or
[1:19:25] not it's built into a woman now if she's
[1:19:28] healthy it's pleasurable he says but I'm
[1:19:31] going to take your pleasure and I'm
[1:19:32] going to turn it into pain every time or
[1:19:35] possibility of pain every time what
[1:19:37] there's a possibility of you getting
[1:19:38] pregnant on a regular basis if you
[1:19:40] engage in pleasure it's a constant
[1:19:42] reminder of the effect of sin that with
[1:19:44] it it eventually turns to pain so now
[1:19:46] she's got a monthly time where she can
[1:19:48] conceive it's built into her the beasts
[1:19:50] don't have this beasts don't have this
[1:19:53] beasts have like a six-month cycle from
[1:19:54] the spring to the fall where they can
[1:19:56] get pregnant and then it shuts off
[1:19:57] through the winter but a woman can
[1:19:58] conceive at any time all the way through
[1:20:00] the year it doesn't change with the with
[1:20:02] the seasons and these different things
[1:20:04] why cuz sin awakened it and God says now
[1:20:06] that you've awakened it you're going to
[1:20:07] deal with it and it's with you all the
[1:20:09] way you're never going to get away from
[1:20:10] it it'll have control over you your
[1:20:12] hormones will have control over you you
[1:20:14] might hate your husband one day and the
[1:20:16] next day you'll just you'll just want to
[1:20:17] be with them it'll have total control
[1:20:20] over you and he says you'll need an
[1:20:21] outlet for that but you're not just
[1:20:24] going to be able to do that with anyone
[1:20:25] he says it's got to be with your husband
[1:20:27] now and God puts a box around it he says
[1:20:30] it's out of my will it's not the way I
[1:20:31] meant for it to be but because it's
[1:20:33] there now there's only going to be one
[1:20:35] person you can do that with and that's
[1:20:36] your husband we see what Paul said in
[1:20:38] Hebrews 13 He says the marriage marriage
[1:20:40] is Honorable in all and the bed
[1:20:42] undefiled God allowed this God made it
[1:20:45] honorable God put a box around physical
[1:20:47] intimacy and he says it's only for
[1:20:49] marriage he says but wh mongers and
[1:20:52] adulterers God will judge you do it
[1:20:53] outside of it you're under under the
[1:20:55] risk of the Wrath of the Judgment of God
[1:20:57] but notice there he says he says not
[1:20:59] only will your desire be to him but he
[1:21:02] says he shall rule over thee we have a
[1:21:06] problem today with women trying to take
[1:21:09] control where God told them not
[1:21:12] to
[1:21:15] why because she's trying to get out of
[1:21:17] her place That's what Satan does is he
[1:21:19] tries to get us out of our place men we
[1:21:22] are not where we are because we are
[1:21:23] better we are are there because God said
[1:21:25] that we are the ones to do it so women
[1:21:28] cannot take
[1:21:29] authority but it can be granted to them
[1:21:32] but here's the thing a man cannot Grant
[1:21:34] a woman Authority where the scripture
[1:21:37] says only he can do it church I can't
[1:21:40] give authority to my wife just because
[1:21:41] she's better at it than I am if the
[1:21:43] scripture says it's mine to do that
[1:21:45] means I've got to grow I've got to
[1:21:47] mature I've got to I've got to increase
[1:21:49] in my relationship I've got to let the
[1:21:51] attributes of God grow inside of me to
[1:21:53] make me capable of doing that I can't
[1:21:55] just abdicate it to her because she
[1:21:56] naturally has it some women are very
[1:21:59] good
[1:22:00] leaders I work with some I've met plenty
[1:22:03] that are wonderful leaders but you're
[1:22:05] not a leader because you're good at it
[1:22:07] you're a leader because God ordained you
[1:22:08] to it and that's why we separate it
[1:22:11] that's why we separate it and inevitably
[1:22:13] what we have found is that they get LED
[1:22:17] astray by the very thing that Eve did
[1:22:19] and that's usually the shortcoming if
[1:22:20] you're dealing with somebody like that
[1:22:23] amen
[1:22:24] men lead women are in a support role in
[1:22:27] terms of spiritual matters and the
[1:22:28] household but notice here she was
[1:22:30] co-equal with Adam in this original role
[1:22:35] she was co-equal she was a part of him
[1:22:37] there was no difference between them I
[1:22:38] think that's the point is today we're
[1:22:40] looking for equality but there's this
[1:22:41] vast separation and they're trying to
[1:22:43] create these separations but they were
[1:22:45] one and the same they were co-equal
[1:22:47] there was no difference between Adam and
[1:22:49] the woman they were just one they were
[1:22:50] one body they they were from the same
[1:22:52] thing but after she s God says sorry
[1:22:55] he's in charge now and you'll answer to
[1:22:57] him and he's never changed it back and
[1:22:59] it only comes back under that when we go
[1:23:02] into eternity because we're restored
[1:23:04] back to our Eden Condition it's a type
[1:23:06] of us in the Christ and Christ he leads
[1:23:09] we follow I don't tell Christ what to do
[1:23:12] he tells me what to do and I do it and
[1:23:14] you look in the Scriptures it says
[1:23:16] husbands love your wives how as Christ
[1:23:19] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:23:21] that he might present it to himself as a
[1:23:23] glorious bride without spot a wrinkle
[1:23:25] we're doing it for their benefit not for
[1:23:28] ours it's a sacrificial role Christ
[1:23:31] types the husband we type the bride of
[1:23:33] Christ the wife so he curses the woman
[1:23:35] and he curses what she did she curses
[1:23:39] the area that was the problem that that
[1:23:41] committed the sin and then he comes to
[1:23:42] Adam he says unto Adam he said because
[1:23:45] thou hearkened under the voice of thy
[1:23:46] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:23:48] I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not
[1:23:50] eat of it cursed is the ground for thy
[1:23:52] sake in sorrow shalt thou eat eat of it
[1:23:54] all the days of thy life Thorns also and
[1:23:57] thistles shall it bring forth to thee
[1:23:59] and thou shalt eat of the herb of the
[1:24:00] field in the sweat of thy face shalt
[1:24:02] thou eat bread till thou return under
[1:24:04] the ground for out of it was thou taken
[1:24:06] for dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou
[1:24:08] shalt return so what is God cursing Adam
[1:24:11] his
[1:24:12] Dominion amen he doesn't have power over
[1:24:14] it now he was an amateur God he had
[1:24:16] power of the spoken word he was a Son of
[1:24:18] God but now he has to do it by sheer
[1:24:21] physical effort and he's got to sweat
[1:24:23] and he's got a labor he's got a toil and
[1:24:25] he will always battle his environment to
[1:24:27] survive in it God won't provide for him
[1:24:30] as he did before now the man has to
[1:24:32] provide for himself and it'll cause his
[1:24:34] body to slowly fail and die and
[1:24:36] eventually turn back to
[1:24:38] dust now watch in verse 20 and Adam
[1:24:41] called his wife's name Eve she had no
[1:24:44] name now she's got a name in her Fallen
[1:24:46] condition she gets a name why because
[1:24:49] she was the mother of all living it
[1:24:52] never says anywhere in the scripture
[1:24:54] that Adam was the father of all living
[1:24:56] but it says Eve was the mother of all
[1:24:58] living amen if you look at your
[1:24:59] genealogies Adam is listed as the father
[1:25:02] only for Abel and Seth Cain is not found
[1:25:05] in any genealogy in the
[1:25:08] scriptures well he's got a genealogy and
[1:25:10] we'll get to it and we'll see who his
[1:25:13] father was but Cain is never listed and
[1:25:15] we can't go back and say well well
[1:25:16] nobody wanted to have Cain in their
[1:25:18] family tree so they left them out you go
[1:25:20] through they list you whether you're in
[1:25:21] your you're good or bad they put you in
[1:25:23] the family tree they were were so
[1:25:25] precise with their genealogies the Jews
[1:25:27] and the and the children of God they
[1:25:28] could trace themselves all the way back
[1:25:30] to the
[1:25:31] beginning and yet Cain is not there why
[1:25:34] because he ain't a part of the genealogy
[1:25:36] there's something else that's different
[1:25:37] about him so God comes out now sorry it
[1:25:40] says he called his name wife's name Eve
[1:25:42] because she was the mother of all living
[1:25:44] and then he says unto Adam also and to
[1:25:46] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[1:25:48] skins and clothed them now I want to
[1:25:50] touch on that last verse a little bit
[1:25:52] because we see that God replaced their
[1:25:54] covering with his covering they were
[1:25:57] looking to cover up their nakedness they
[1:25:59] were looking to cover up the effects of
[1:26:01] their sin but it was not acceptable to
[1:26:03] God and for them to even come into His
[1:26:06] presence God had prepared a covering to
[1:26:08] hold back judgment in that moment and
[1:26:11] what was it it was the skins of an
[1:26:13] animal now the scripture doesn't tell us
[1:26:14] what it was but we know or we believe if
[1:26:17] we look into the future that that would
[1:26:19] have been a lamb that was the sacrifice
[1:26:21] it was the Lamb of God there was a lamb
[1:26:23] slain before the found foundation of the
[1:26:24] world it was always a lamb so you can't
[1:26:27] make a coat of skin without killing some
[1:26:29] animal amen and so God comes down and
[1:26:32] God doesn't now pull out a sewing
[1:26:33] machine he doesn't have the latest
[1:26:34] singer there and sit down and make a
[1:26:37] beautiful coat out of sheep skin and
[1:26:39] wool God kills an animal and he takes
[1:26:43] the bloody skin and he wraps them in
[1:26:47] it why because they've got to see
[1:26:51] sacrifice is not clean
[1:26:54] death is not clean right they had to
[1:26:57] realize what death meant right then and
[1:26:58] there and they look and with horror they
[1:27:01] would see that came from little fluffy
[1:27:05] lamb that used to love walking around
[1:27:08] with us and and fluffy the lamb is dead
[1:27:12] for me and they had to see the effect of
[1:27:15] their sin right then and there cuz
[1:27:18] remember there had to be a death there
[1:27:20] had to be a death and God said I'll take
[1:27:21] an innocent substitute for now and so
[1:27:24] what did he do he came down and it was a
[1:27:26] type of Christ the perfect sacrifice
[1:27:27] that would take their place later God's
[1:27:29] word had to be fulfilled death had to
[1:27:31] happen and so they there was a death
[1:27:33] that happened that day but remember they
[1:27:35] that day if we look in the scriptures a
[1:27:37] day is as a thousand years with God and
[1:27:39] so that day they started to die and they
[1:27:42] all died within a thousand years nobody
[1:27:44] lived past A Thousand Years Methuselah I
[1:27:46] think was 969 years nobody lived a day
[1:27:49] in God's eyes after that they were
[1:27:52] separated from him they they lost access
[1:27:54] to eternal life and that's why the
[1:27:55] Millennium so important is because it
[1:27:57] proves we're back in our in our original
[1:27:59] condition that we live a thousand years
[1:28:01] that we live a day again but it not just
[1:28:04] because they had to see what death meant
[1:28:06] but it had to be
[1:28:07] blood the covering we look at we think
[1:28:10] it was it was it was the skin the
[1:28:13] covering was not the skin the blood was
[1:28:15] the cover or sorry the the the the
[1:28:17] covering was not the skin itself the
[1:28:19] covering that mattered was the blood the
[1:28:22] blood was proof that a life had been
[1:28:23] lost but the blood covered the evidence
[1:28:27] of Eve's sin now the adults that are
[1:28:30] among us we we know that there's blood
[1:28:33] there's always blood when a woman loses
[1:28:35] her
[1:28:36] virginity and so when Eve's walking back
[1:28:39] she has blood on her
[1:28:42] body and the only thing that will hide
[1:28:45] blood is
[1:28:47] blood and so what happens is now she's
[1:28:50] coated in a bloody skin and Adam's
[1:28:52] coated in a bloody skin and what does it
[1:28:54] do the blood of the innocent sacrifice
[1:28:57] mingles with the blood of the proof of
[1:28:59] their sin and it covers it it does not
[1:29:03] erase it it covers it it's an imperfect
[1:29:06] covering but it covers it nonetheless
[1:29:08] and so nobody could look at Eve and say
[1:29:10] Eve there's the proof because
[1:29:11] everything's Blended in together now
[1:29:13] she's soaked in blood blood is falling
[1:29:16] down that's why it had to be
[1:29:19] blood to prove that a life was lost and
[1:29:22] to cover the proof of her sin in the
[1:29:24] first place to effectively cover it the
[1:29:26] leaves weren't covering the proof they
[1:29:28] were just helping them feel better and
[1:29:31] that's what the world's trying to do
[1:29:32] today isn't it it's trying to make you
[1:29:34] feel better in your sins rather than
[1:29:36] getting you under the blood of Christ
[1:29:38] and actually doing something about
[1:29:40] it so now what happens the effect of
[1:29:44] God's provided way is that it hides the
[1:29:46] proof of their sin it mingles with it it
[1:29:49] absorbs it the fruit of their actions is
[1:29:51] that they're aware of their nakedness
[1:29:53] and sexuality and the consequences is
[1:29:55] that they now lose access to the
[1:29:57] presence of God and they can't come to
[1:29:59] God anytime they want they could call
[1:30:01] they could request they could pray they
[1:30:03] could get desperate but it would be up
[1:30:04] to God to respond to those things now as
[1:30:07] we start to close let's look at the
[1:30:09] effect of all this let's look what it at
[1:30:11] What It produced because as we said
[1:30:12] before I it's not just going to produce
[1:30:15] an awareness but it produces an
[1:30:16] offspring God said there's going to be
[1:30:17] an offspring comes out of this it's
[1:30:19] going to be children there's always a
[1:30:21] harvest from our actions there's always
[1:30:23] an end result that comes out of it it's
[1:30:24] not just sin but there's a harvest
[1:30:26] remember what the scripture says uh be
[1:30:28] not deceived God's not mocked whatever a
[1:30:30] man SWS he'll also reap there's always a
[1:30:32] harvest that comes out of our choices so
[1:30:35] we look back again in Genesis 3 he says
[1:30:37] I'll put enmity enmity hostility between
[1:30:40] thee and the woman and between your seed
[1:30:42] and her seed between your Offspring and
[1:30:45] her Offspring will bruise thy head and
[1:30:47] thou shalt bruise his heal and then he
[1:30:49] said to the woman I'll greatly multiply
[1:30:51] thy sorrow and thy conception I want to
[1:30:53] put that together I will greatly
[1:30:54] multiply thy conception in sorrow Thou
[1:30:57] shalt bring forth children multiple and
[1:30:59] thy desire shall be to thy husband and
[1:31:01] he shall rule over thee so we know that
[1:31:03] there's a spiritual element here it's a
[1:31:05] prophecy of Christ bruising Satan at
[1:31:07] Calvary crushing him when he died and he
[1:31:10] rose again and yet we know that Satan
[1:31:12] bruised Christ in his flesh and that
[1:31:14] there was a death that occurred but it
[1:31:15] wasn't fatal it was temporary and Christ
[1:31:18] rose again but when we look at what
[1:31:20] happened to Satan it's a fatal bruising
[1:31:22] it's a crushing of him because there at
[1:31:24] the cross when he rose again Christ
[1:31:26] conquered death hell and the grave and
[1:31:28] that's all the power that that Satan has
[1:31:30] over us amen but we notice here that
[1:31:32] there's got to be a physical element as
[1:31:34] well because he says the woman's
[1:31:35] Offspring and the Serpent's Offspring
[1:31:38] let me put it this way the woman's seed
[1:31:40] and the Serpent's Seed they would be at
[1:31:42] enmity they would be at war they'd be in
[1:31:44] Conflict they'd be in opposition and one
[1:31:46] of them will be of The Serpent and one
[1:31:48] of them will be the woman and God says
[1:31:50] I'm going to multiply your conception
[1:31:52] you're going to have more than one baby
[1:31:53] here
[1:31:54] so the serpent needs to have an
[1:31:55] offspring he needs to have a seed and
[1:31:57] the woman needs to have an offspring or
[1:31:58] a seed now put these things together and
[1:32:01] watch what happens and we read this
[1:32:02] before it says Adam knew his and Adam
[1:32:05] knew remember what we said the tree of
[1:32:06] knowledge knowing this is the act of
[1:32:09] knowledge Adam knew his wife single
[1:32:11] event single act and she conceived and
[1:32:14] bore Cain this is Genesis 4:1 now so
[1:32:17] this is everything's done they're out of
[1:32:19] the Garden of Eden it says Adam knew his
[1:32:21] wife and then she conceived and bear
[1:32:24] Cain and said I have gotten a man from
[1:32:27] the Lord but remember the scripture says
[1:32:28] she ate the fruit without her husband
[1:32:31] there and then she ate the fruit with
[1:32:32] her husband there so she ate the fruit
[1:32:34] with the serpent then she came to her
[1:32:36] husband and ate the fruit here is the
[1:32:38] record of Adam eating the fruit made
[1:32:39] very clear with his husband and then it
[1:32:42] says and she again bear his brother Abel
[1:32:45] and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain
[1:32:47] was a tiller of the ground Abel was a
[1:32:48] Shepherd but but Cain was a farmer but
[1:32:52] we look at at that second verse it says
[1:32:54] she again Bears brother Abel it doesn't
[1:32:56] say that Adam knew his
[1:32:58] wife it just says that she produced Abel
[1:33:01] Now watch how this goes let's go to
[1:33:02] verse one first it says Eve says I have
[1:33:05] gotten a man from the Lord and almost
[1:33:06] everyone in denomination says see that
[1:33:09] was a child from Adam but let me say
[1:33:12] this first thing just CU I say it don't
[1:33:15] mean it's right she's fooled already I
[1:33:18] don't trust what comes out of his mouth
[1:33:20] if you'll give me that Grace this
[1:33:21] morning but just cuz she says it doesn't
[1:33:24] mean she's right now she's right in a
[1:33:26] way life only comes from God so this can
[1:33:30] happen by his
[1:33:32] permission you look in the scriptures
[1:33:34] remember the scripture says God closed
[1:33:36] up the womb of this one God closed up
[1:33:37] the look at Hannah Hannah is a faithful
[1:33:40] believer and God closes up her womb for
[1:33:43] purpose and it's to get her to a place
[1:33:46] where she'll say the right thing and do
[1:33:48] the right thing and then God opens it up
[1:33:49] Samuel's born she gives him back to God
[1:33:52] and then she goes and she has a bunch
[1:33:53] more children why God opens and closes
[1:33:56] God chooses God allows who has children
[1:33:58] who doesn't there are people that will
[1:33:59] do this act for their entire life and
[1:34:01] never have a baby and you say why God
[1:34:04] allows it or God doesn't allow it it's
[1:34:06] up to God Amen God would refuse to allow
[1:34:09] it or whatever so life is of god
[1:34:11] remember Satan cannot produce life he
[1:34:14] can corrupt he can destroy he can twist
[1:34:16] but he cannot produce life he is not a
[1:34:18] Creator he's a destroyer amen so life is
[1:34:22] of God but that doesn't mean the child
[1:34:24] is Godly that doesn't mean the child is
[1:34:26] good every child is born by God's
[1:34:28] permission and allowance not necessarily
[1:34:30] by his will but by his permission
[1:34:32] remember we read that first scripture in
[1:34:33] John where it says that we are not born
[1:34:36] of the will of man or by the blood but
[1:34:39] we are born of the will of God so
[1:34:42] everything that happens naturally he
[1:34:44] allows it but that is not the birth he's
[1:34:46] looking
[1:34:46] for so Eve saying this doesn't make it
[1:34:49] true in the sense that that that Cain
[1:34:51] was a child of or from God in fact we'll
[1:34:54] see what Jesus says Jesus flat
[1:34:56] contradicts and corrects Eve on this if
[1:34:57] we want to put it that way but this one
[1:34:59] doesn't add up if you go back to the
[1:35:01] original Hebrew language so here's
[1:35:02] here's where we dig into the scriptures
[1:35:05] a little bit now I hope I don't bore you
[1:35:06] I'll I'll take two minutes to do this
[1:35:09] because in the in in in Hebrews in the
[1:35:11] Hebrew in the original Hebrew you've got
[1:35:13] to look at the verb tenses here because
[1:35:15] it says Adam knew his wife and she
[1:35:17] conceived the two verbs are new and
[1:35:19] conceived and in Hebrews so we have a we
[1:35:22] have three we have past present and
[1:35:24] future so we could say Adam knew Adam
[1:35:27] was knowing and Adam will know but in
[1:35:29] the scripture or in Hebrew you only have
[1:35:32] he Adam knew and that's a a perfect
[1:35:35] tense or an imperfect so a perfect tense
[1:35:37] means it's a completed act and an
[1:35:39] imperfect t means it's an ongoing act so
[1:35:42] it says here that Adam knew Eve his wife
[1:35:44] and she conceived we read that in
[1:35:46] English and we read that as one and the
[1:35:48] same act but when you go into the Hebrew
[1:35:50] here then then it says that where it
[1:35:53] says Adam had known his wife it says
[1:35:56] it's in the perfect tense meaning it's a
[1:35:58] completed act but when it says she
[1:35:59] conceived Cain it's in the imperfect so
[1:36:03] it means that one is a finished act and
[1:36:05] one is an ongoing act so if you were to
[1:36:07] put that into English it would say that
[1:36:09] Adam had known his wife past tense and
[1:36:13] she was conceiving and bearing a son
[1:36:18] ongoing so he knew his wife he had
[1:36:20] physical intimacy with his wife that's
[1:36:22] one act but
[1:36:24] the the the the conception of Cain is an
[1:36:26] ongoing process that is outside of what
[1:36:29] Adam did with his
[1:36:30] wife so now and to show you why this
[1:36:34] matters if we go and look down into the
[1:36:36] next couple of verses so the first one
[1:36:38] is Genesis 4:1 Adam knew his wife and
[1:36:40] she conceived and be Cain and those are
[1:36:42] different events the verb tenses are
[1:36:44] completely different one is a completed
[1:36:45] act one is something that's going on
[1:36:47] because remember a child is forming in
[1:36:50] her okay it's forming it's not done it's
[1:36:53] forming
[1:36:54] right when a woman's impregnated there's
[1:36:55] a thing that goes on and it's got to
[1:36:57] embed itself in the wall in these
[1:36:58] different things so so Cain is being
[1:37:00] formed but that is not Adam's act with
[1:37:03] his wife so if we look at the next
[1:37:06] couple of scriptures now that say the
[1:37:08] exact same thing it says and Cain knew
[1:37:10] his wife and she conceived and bear
[1:37:12] Enoch the tenses of those verbs are
[1:37:14] exactly the same thing the the the
[1:37:16] relationship with his wife and the
[1:37:18] conception of Enoch are one and the same
[1:37:20] event and then we go and and Adam does
[1:37:23] the same thing with his wife again and
[1:37:25] it says and Adam knew his wife and she
[1:37:27] bear a son and called his name Seth for
[1:37:29] God she said ha appointed me another
[1:37:31] seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew Cain
[1:37:34] is not listed as a seed of God Seth is
[1:37:37] another seed from God to replace Abel
[1:37:39] who was a seed of God Cain isn't her
[1:37:41] seed he's a serpent seed but in this act
[1:37:44] again Adam knew his wife and she bear a
[1:37:46] son she conceived it's one and the same
[1:37:49] act in the same tenses it's tied
[1:37:51] together but yet in Genesis 4 one it is
[1:37:54] two separate tenses why is that in
[1:37:56] English it looks exactly the same in
[1:37:58] Hebrew it is completely different why
[1:38:00] because the acts in 17 and 25 are not
[1:38:03] the same as the acts in in Genesis
[1:38:06] 1 I thank brother Jason dears for this
[1:38:09] he's the one that gave me this when I
[1:38:10] reached out to him a while ago so he did
[1:38:12] all the heavy lifting on this I'm just
[1:38:14] using his work this morning but if you
[1:38:16] go back to the original scripture it
[1:38:18] shows that what happened in Genesis 1 is
[1:38:21] not the way that Cain did it and it's
[1:38:23] not the same thing that Adam did later
[1:38:24] to produce Seth it's completely
[1:38:26] different it's a separation of
[1:38:29] events so it looks like knowing and
[1:38:31] conceiving are the same thing but it's
[1:38:33] not the exact same thing here so then
[1:38:35] Eve has another child Abel she doesn't
[1:38:37] say he's from the
[1:38:38] Lord doesn't say Adam knew her well we'd
[1:38:42] say today well D John she had a
[1:38:44] twin she had a relationship with Adam
[1:38:47] and It produced twins but look at the
[1:38:49] nature of those two boys and you see
[1:38:52] something Abel's a shepherd and can's a
[1:38:54] farmer that doesn't make them different
[1:38:56] in of itself nothing wrong or right
[1:38:58] about that but if we look at their
[1:38:59] Natures how they act towards God we see
[1:39:02] something that is completely different
[1:39:04] so it says in the process of time it
[1:39:06] came to pass that Cain brought the fruit
[1:39:08] of the ground an offering to the Lord
[1:39:10] Cain bought everything he had done he
[1:39:11] brought fruits and vegetables maybe
[1:39:13] flowers beautiful things this is a
[1:39:15] gorgeous
[1:39:16] offering it would have been
[1:39:18] amazing absolutely beautiful he brought
[1:39:21] the best of the best that he had it says
[1:39:24] and Abel he also brought of the
[1:39:25] firstlings of his flock and the fat
[1:39:28] thereof you can't get the fat unless you
[1:39:29] kill amen so Abel comes and he takes a
[1:39:32] lamb and he kills it and he spreads it
[1:39:35] before God on the altar it says and the
[1:39:37] Lord have respect unto Abel and his
[1:39:39] offering so that was the best that he
[1:39:41] had but he did not leave it whole but he
[1:39:43] took his life he took the life of the
[1:39:45] lamb and he put it there and the
[1:39:46] scripture says God had respect unto it
[1:39:49] now what does that mean it means that
[1:39:50] God consumed it with fire like he did on
[1:39:52] Mount carel
[1:39:53] with Elijah God showed it was acceptable
[1:39:56] by consuming it it was a supernatural
[1:39:59] act that happened there so let's jump to
[1:40:01] the New Testament quickly because we see
[1:40:03] an explanation for this we see Cain does
[1:40:05] one thing and we see Abel does another
[1:40:07] and we say why did they do different
[1:40:08] things well Hebrews 11 says by faith
[1:40:12] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:40:14] sacrifice than Cain didn't say Cain's
[1:40:16] wasn't good he said it was more
[1:40:18] excellent God requires it in a certain
[1:40:20] way he says by faith he did it and by
[1:40:22] which he obtained witnessed that he was
[1:40:24] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:40:26] and by it he being dead yet speaketh now
[1:40:29] we know faith is a revelation of God
[1:40:31] faith is given to us from God when he
[1:40:33] shows something when God shows us
[1:40:35] something and it's really from him he
[1:40:36] gives us Faith behind it to act on it
[1:40:39] that's how you know you have a real
[1:40:40] Revelation is it'll cause you to act on
[1:40:42] it it'll cause you to stand on it it'll
[1:40:43] cause you to rest on it so Abel has a
[1:40:46] divine revelation of why he needed a
[1:40:48] sacrifice and why the sacrifice needed
[1:40:51] to be blood now here's the thing Abel's
[1:40:54] uh Revelation does not cause him to be
[1:40:57] under
[1:40:58] conviction it causes him to be
[1:41:01] acceptable he's a Son of
[1:41:04] God but it brings conviction to
[1:41:07] Cain and it highlights who Cain is in
[1:41:11] comparison to
[1:41:12] Abel now don't don't don't get me wrong
[1:41:15] Abel is not perfect but he's a Son of
[1:41:17] God and we'll see this we're not going
[1:41:19] to get into this service we see a line
[1:41:20] that is called the sons of God and we'll
[1:41:22] see a line that is called the sons of
[1:41:23] man and the sons of God have a purity in
[1:41:26] their line and the sons of God have can
[1:41:27] in their line what's the
[1:41:29] difference who the daddy
[1:41:32] is but but but Abel does this by divine
[1:41:35] revelation but watch Cain because if
[1:41:37] Cain is just the son of Adam and and Eve
[1:41:39] the way that Abel is then he doesn't
[1:41:41] need to be perfect but his response
[1:41:43] ought to be the right way God doesn't
[1:41:46] require us to be perfect up front but
[1:41:48] when he shows us something he expects us
[1:41:49] to abide by it and we see this isn't the
[1:41:51] case at all with Cain because it says
[1:41:53] but unto Cain and his offering he had
[1:41:54] not respect God didn't accept it God
[1:41:57] said it was excellent but God didn't
[1:41:59] accept it and Cain was very wroth he was
[1:42:01] very angry and his countenance fell his
[1:42:03] face got angry so Cain doesn't
[1:42:05] acknowledge it at all and Cain got mad
[1:42:06] and I don't blame Cain for that Cain
[1:42:09] gave God the best that he had and God
[1:42:11] said I don't want it church that ought
[1:42:14] to tell us something there's a way to
[1:42:16] approach God and it's his way not my way
[1:42:19] I can give him my best and that's not
[1:42:21] what he's looking for he's asking to
[1:42:23] come his provided Way by Revelation by
[1:42:27] faith the you can preach on some of
[1:42:30] these things for for for a month or or
[1:42:32] or a year and not get to the bottom of
[1:42:34] it I'm just doing broad strokes this
[1:42:35] morning for this for the sake of
[1:42:37] time and God said to Cain Cain why are
[1:42:40] you angry why are you wroth and why is
[1:42:42] your countenance Fallen Cain what's
[1:42:43] wrong with you he says if thou doest
[1:42:46] well shalt thou not be accepted in other
[1:42:49] words he's saying Cain if you sacrifice
[1:42:51] the way Abel will I'll accept and
[1:42:53] acknowledge you and your sacrifice as
[1:42:56] well he says and if thou doest not well
[1:43:00] sin lith at the door God saying to Cain
[1:43:03] I don't hold it against you that you
[1:43:05] didn't do it right the first time but
[1:43:08] now that you see the way to approach me
[1:43:10] you've got a choice and you can obey it
[1:43:13] or you cannot obey it and he says and if
[1:43:15] you don't do it sin lies at the door in
[1:43:18] other word unbelief is cropping up it's
[1:43:20] coming up out of your life and you're
[1:43:22] going to fite that he says not only that
[1:43:24] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[1:43:26] shalt rule over him in other words sin
[1:43:28] will be chasing you constantly and
[1:43:30] you're going to be battling sin the rest
[1:43:32] of your life because you won't accept
[1:43:34] what I'm telling you to do right
[1:43:36] here he didn't say Cain I've turned you
[1:43:38] down because you're wrong he says Cain
[1:43:40] I'll turn you down if you don't do what
[1:43:42] you know to do is
[1:43:44] right God does God leaves us without
[1:43:46] excuse church he shows us what he wants
[1:43:49] and then he says will you do it or will
[1:43:50] you not and this is the deciding factor
[1:43:54] of who is and is not a child of God not
[1:43:56] signs and wonders not speaking in
[1:43:58] tongues not Church attendance it's will
[1:44:00] you do what God shows you by his word
[1:44:03] when he shows you he doesn't hold you
[1:44:05] responsible if he never shows you but as
[1:44:07] soon as he shows you now you're
[1:44:08] responsible for what he's given
[1:44:11] you you know what Cain says I am what I
[1:44:14] am I'll do what I want take it or leave
[1:44:18] it and you're telling me that's a the
[1:44:20] child of a son and daughter of God
[1:44:24] can't be look at verse eight it proves
[1:44:26] it and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[1:44:28] and it came to pass when they were in
[1:44:30] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[1:44:32] his brother and slew him killed him they
[1:44:35] were fellowshipping then he killed him
[1:44:38] two completely different Natures
[1:44:40] supposedly from the same
[1:44:41] parents how does that work now you might
[1:44:44] look at Jacob and Esau and say well
[1:44:46] brother John we can see that all through
[1:44:47] the scriptures but they are not in the
[1:44:48] condition of Jacob and Esau this is
[1:44:50] before the mixing of the bloodlines
[1:44:53] if they are both of Adam and Eve the way
[1:44:56] Abel definitely is then they ought to
[1:44:58] have the same Natures but they
[1:45:00] don't they should be identical in that
[1:45:03] sense but they're not so we see what two
[1:45:05] Offspring at emnity two offspring that
[1:45:08] are in hostility with each other it's
[1:45:09] one-sided Abel's not persecuting Cain
[1:45:12] but Cain's persecuting Abel why because
[1:45:14] God said that's how it was going to be
[1:45:16] there's going to be two seeds there's
[1:45:17] going to be two offsprings there's going
[1:45:18] to be two Bloodlines and there'll be a
[1:45:20] battle between the two and in the end
[1:45:21] Cain murders able the evil one murders
[1:45:24] the righteous
[1:45:25] one so how can they be from the same
[1:45:28] parents if they're if they're two
[1:45:30] completely different Natures Adam and
[1:45:32] Abel have the same nature but Cain does
[1:45:34] not what's wrong with Cain why is he why
[1:45:36] is he different and not in a good way
[1:45:38] Cain is angry Cain's murderous Cain
[1:45:41] feels God is unfair and
[1:45:43] unjust we don't see any of these things
[1:45:45] from from from Abel but Cain you notice
[1:45:48] was religious he was Pious he was
[1:45:51] interested in being right before God and
[1:45:53] yet as soon as the opportunity is given
[1:45:55] and the opportunity contradicts himself
[1:45:58] and what he believes what does he do he
[1:46:00] says I'm not
[1:46:02] interested and he rejects God he wanted
[1:46:04] to meet with God on his terms not
[1:46:07] God's what was he he was
[1:46:09] religious that's all just religious
[1:46:12] religion won't save us church we got to
[1:46:14] come his chosen way if we jump to the
[1:46:16] New Testament John 8 now Jesus is
[1:46:18] talking to the religious leaders now
[1:46:21] religious cuz what we're going to see
[1:46:23] here is two Spirits
[1:46:25] interwoven remember within the framework
[1:46:28] of the church and this is the origin of
[1:46:30] it not worldly
[1:46:33] religious religious so Jesus is talking
[1:46:36] now to the to the priests he says I know
[1:46:39] that ye are Abraham's seed he's
[1:46:41] Naturally Speaking they were the
[1:46:42] children of Abraham by their bloodlines
[1:46:43] he says but you seek to kill me because
[1:46:45] my word had no place in you just like
[1:46:47] Cain I speak that which I have seen with
[1:46:50] my father and ye do that which ye have
[1:46:53] seen with your father he says I'm doing
[1:46:57] I'm doing what my father shows me and
[1:46:58] you are as well Jesus is saying your
[1:47:00] father ain't my father we come from a
[1:47:03] different bloodline we come from a
[1:47:04] different family and they answered and
[1:47:06] said unto him Abraham is Our Father and
[1:47:09] Jesus said unto him if you were
[1:47:10] Abraham's SE children ye would do the
[1:47:12] works of Abraham but now you seek to
[1:47:15] kill me a man that had told you the
[1:47:17] truth what did Abel do to Cain he showed
[1:47:20] him the truth by his works by his
[1:47:21] Sacrifice by his acceptance he said
[1:47:24] which I have heard of God Abel got this
[1:47:26] from God it's a revelation Jesus is
[1:47:28] saying just like Cain and Abel you're
[1:47:30] seeking to kill me because I tell you
[1:47:32] what you don't want to hear because it
[1:47:33] identifies who you
[1:47:36] are he says this did not Abraham Abraham
[1:47:39] didn't do that he said somebody else do
[1:47:41] it then he says ye do the Deeds of your
[1:47:44] father and they said to him we be not
[1:47:46] born of
[1:47:47] fornication they said we weren't born
[1:47:49] out of
[1:47:51] wedlock he just said your father's not
[1:47:53] like my father and they said we're not
[1:47:55] born of fornication what does that have
[1:47:56] to do with
[1:47:57] anything absolutely nothing the rest of
[1:47:59] the world would say absolutely
[1:48:03] nothing but Jesus said you're of a
[1:48:05] different father than I they're saying
[1:48:07] hey don't put that on us because they
[1:48:09] know exactly what he's talking about why
[1:48:12] because the father of murder is Cain and
[1:48:15] Cain is born of
[1:48:17] fornication they knew exactly what he
[1:48:19] was talking about and Jesus said unto
[1:48:20] them if God were your father you would
[1:48:22] love me for I proceeded forth and came
[1:48:24] from God neither came I of myself but he
[1:48:27] sent me anden if Cain was as Abel was
[1:48:29] he'd have loved and obeyed God's word
[1:48:31] because they'd have the same nature
[1:48:32] their father and Jesus is showing now
[1:48:34] these two Natures these two spirits that
[1:48:35] work in the church one is of God and one
[1:48:37] is not but yet they can both look
[1:48:39] religious they can both look Pious they
[1:48:41] can both look Christian but they're not
[1:48:44] both go to church both say they believe
[1:48:46] the message but only one has the true
[1:48:49] evidence and that's that they'll let it
[1:48:50] live in them
[1:48:53] he says why do you not understand my
[1:48:54] speech why don't you understand my words
[1:48:56] he says even because you cannot hear it
[1:48:58] you can't understand it ye are of your
[1:49:01] father who the
[1:49:03] devil he says and the lusts of your
[1:49:06] father you will do catch us now their
[1:49:08] father's the devil and he's a lustful
[1:49:10] person who is the original lustful
[1:49:12] person it's the serpent Satan indwelt
[1:49:15] the serpent he says he was a murderer
[1:49:17] from the beginning who's the original
[1:49:20] murderer Cain Cain was a murderer he was
[1:49:23] the first one and he Abode not in the
[1:49:25] truth in other words he knew the truth
[1:49:27] but he couldn't live in the truth he
[1:49:29] couldn't live by the
[1:49:31] truth he says why because there is no
[1:49:34] truth in him what could why couldn't
[1:49:36] Cain accept it an Abel could because
[1:49:38] there was no truth in him he wasn't of
[1:49:40] God the way that Eve said he was he
[1:49:43] wasn't born of the Son of God Adam he
[1:49:45] says when he speaketh a lie he speaketh
[1:49:47] of his own for he's a liar and he's the
[1:49:49] father of it who's the original liar
[1:49:51] it's the serpent it's Satan and the
[1:49:53] serpent he told a lie and Cain is just
[1:49:56] like him Cain is a liar CU remember God
[1:49:58] comes down to Cain after he kills Abel
[1:49:59] he says where's your brother he says I
[1:50:00] don't know I'm not I don't I don't watch
[1:50:02] after my brother he's a liar he's a
[1:50:05] liar and then he comes he says because I
[1:50:08] tell you the truth you believe me not
[1:50:10] and which of you convinces me of sin and
[1:50:12] if I say the truth why do you not
[1:50:13] believe me he that is of God heareth
[1:50:16] God's words ye therefore hear them not
[1:50:18] because ye are not of God here's the
[1:50:20] test of a child of God will you accept
[1:50:22] the full word of God not just the stuff
[1:50:25] you want not just the stuff you like
[1:50:26] you'll accept the stuff that cut you to
[1:50:28] your
[1:50:32] core that's it's got to be that way
[1:50:34] church it's got to be that way if we're
[1:50:36] going to be accepted we've got to accept
[1:50:37] his provided way and that's to be
[1:50:39] wrapped completely in his Robes of
[1:50:41] righteousness in his word to do
[1:50:43] righteousness is to do the will of God
[1:50:46] Amen so we look at Cain and Abel we see
[1:50:48] two Natures Abel's faithful true to
[1:50:50] God's word obedient and gentle and Cain
[1:50:52] is a liar a murderer he's angry he's
[1:50:54] unable to accept God's word thinks that
[1:50:56] God's unfair why two different fathers
[1:51:00] one was born of a lustful liar the
[1:51:02] serpent under the influence of Satan and
[1:51:04] the other was born of the Son of God
[1:51:05] Adam now what is this what is this you
[1:51:08] say brother John you're you're talking
[1:51:09] in riddles now so you're saying two
[1:51:11] fathers one
[1:51:13] mother how does that
[1:51:15] happen well it's called
[1:51:18] heteropaternal superation
[1:51:24] okay write that one down okay and this
[1:51:27] is when a woman conceives from two
[1:51:30] different males within a short period of
[1:51:32] time it's two separate eggs it is not an
[1:51:34] egg that divides it's two separate eggs
[1:51:36] brought to life by two partners to
[1:51:38] produce children that are completely
[1:51:40] different and it happens within a short
[1:51:41] period of time within 5 days okay this
[1:51:45] is medically proven the first case was
[1:51:47] reported by Dr John Archer he's the
[1:51:49] first doctor to receive a medic medical
[1:51:51] degree in the United States in 1810 and
[1:51:54] according to him there was a white woman
[1:51:55] that had two partners and she didn't
[1:51:57] tell anyone and when they were born one
[1:51:59] was black and one was
[1:52:04] white Eve had two that were born one was
[1:52:06] black and one was white now I'm not
[1:52:07] talking the color of their skin I'm
[1:52:09] talking about the condition of their
[1:52:10] soul one was a child of God one was not
[1:52:14] but I looked this up because I wanted to
[1:52:15] see you know how often this happens and
[1:52:17] it is very rare but the last one I found
[1:52:20] was a lady Nam named Mia Washington and
[1:52:22] Dallas Texas and she had an affair while
[1:52:24] she was
[1:52:26] married and she had two boys on May 8th
[1:52:29] 2009 and they looked nothing alike so
[1:52:30] they did a DNA test and they found that
[1:52:31] one was by her husband and then she
[1:52:33] finally had to admit that she'd had an
[1:52:34] affair with another man they were twins
[1:52:37] by birth but they not were not twins by
[1:52:40] the same fathers two completely
[1:52:42] different fathers and two children
[1:52:44] coming out of the same mother so the
[1:52:46] mother's DNA is in both but it's the
[1:52:48] father's DNA that's different between
[1:52:49] two of them let's take it back to what
[1:52:51] Jesus said as we wrap up this
[1:52:53] morning we're not too
[1:52:56] bad amen I'll take God's word over I'll
[1:52:58] take Jesus word over Eevees if that's
[1:53:01] okay with you this morning he says
[1:53:03] whoever is born of God does not commit
[1:53:06] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:53:09] cannot sin because he's born of God I am
[1:53:11] not going to unpack that scripture
[1:53:12] that's a series in itself we'll do it
[1:53:14] later by God's grace but he says he says
[1:53:18] he does not commit sin he does not
[1:53:20] disbelieve
[1:53:23] he's not saying you don't do bad things
[1:53:25] he's saying no matter what Hallelujah
[1:53:28] you keep coming back to the word of God
[1:53:32] even when this flesh is screaming it's
[1:53:34] wrong it's wrong I can't do it I can't
[1:53:36] do it we come up to that word and we say
[1:53:39] Lord according to your word be it unto
[1:53:41] me and we humble ourselves to it and we
[1:53:43] confess it and we repent and we press on
[1:53:47] that's what he means here he does not
[1:53:48] see say you are sinless in that you do
[1:53:50] not have the attributes of sin he saying
[1:53:52] you cannot disbelieve because there's
[1:53:54] something in you to disbelieve will be
[1:53:56] du to deny exactly who and what you are
[1:53:59] that's what it means okay we can dig
[1:54:01] into that a lot later maybe but he says
[1:54:04] in this the children of God are manifest
[1:54:05] he says in other words this is how you
[1:54:07] know who's a child of God and the
[1:54:09] children of the devil okay here's the
[1:54:11] litmus test whosoever doeth not
[1:54:15] righteousness is not of God what is
[1:54:18] righteousness to do the will of God
[1:54:19] which is the word of God that's simple
[1:54:22] that's simple okay there's no other
[1:54:23] definition to do righteousness is to do
[1:54:25] the will of God he says so the so
[1:54:28] whoever doeth not righteousness whoever
[1:54:30] doesn't do the will of God who doesn't
[1:54:31] obey the word of God neither he that
[1:54:34] loveth not his
[1:54:37] brother who's the who this is like the
[1:54:40] the definition of
[1:54:42] Cain right he wouldn't do the will of
[1:54:45] God when God showed him clearly what
[1:54:47] should be done and then he didn't love
[1:54:49] his brother he killed his brother he
[1:54:50] hated his brother
[1:54:53] he says for this is the message that she
[1:54:55] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:54:57] love one another and now he brings it
[1:54:59] down and he clenches it not as Cain who
[1:55:01] was of God Eve said he was of God Jesus
[1:55:06] said the word says not as Cain who was
[1:55:09] of that Wicked
[1:55:12] one and slew his brother and wherefore
[1:55:16] slew he him why did he do it he says
[1:55:18] because his own Works were evil and his
[1:55:21] brothers righteous
[1:55:22] Jesus says Cain and Abel are proof of
[1:55:24] what I'm telling you Abel did what was
[1:55:27] right because he was born of God Cain
[1:55:29] did what was wrong because he was born
[1:55:31] of the wicked one are you telling me
[1:55:34] Adam was the Wicked
[1:55:35] one scripture never calls him that
[1:55:38] scripture calls him the Son of God Cain
[1:55:40] was born of somebody else and this is
[1:55:42] not a spiritual birth this is a natural
[1:55:44] birth there was nothing in him to
[1:55:47] respond to that word there was nothing
[1:55:49] to do it amen
[1:55:52] Eve said Cain was from the Lord Jesus
[1:55:54] said he was of that Wicked one Jesus
[1:55:57] tells us exactly what is meant in that
[1:55:58] scripture and what is right to it so
[1:56:00] what's the original sin Church
[1:56:03] fornication intimacy between a man and a
[1:56:06] woman that were not man and wife she was
[1:56:07] intimate even was intimate with the
[1:56:09] servant serpent before she was ever with
[1:56:11] Adam and what's the proof children of
[1:56:13] two different Natures one with the
[1:56:15] nature of God one with a nature contrary
[1:56:17] to the word of God but there's more to
[1:56:19] it and we'll get into that in the next
[1:56:20] service Lord willing we'll see there's
[1:56:21] two separate Bloodlines we'll see
[1:56:23] there's two spirits that are now
[1:56:24] interwoven through the
[1:56:26] church it's all in our
[1:56:28] Bible I use no quotes to prove this this
[1:56:31] is all
[1:56:32] scripture Jesus taught it Paul taught it
[1:56:36] the Sadducees and Pharisees knew it
[1:56:38] Moses taught it from the beginning it
[1:56:40] was
[1:56:41] there and it gives us an understanding
[1:56:43] now as to why we're Fallen but now they
[1:56:46] were all children of God and now you got
[1:56:48] Cain's line you say well I'm a Child of
[1:56:50] God but not by your physicality you're
[1:56:53] not that's been lost so long ago and
[1:56:55] we'll get into that Lord willing in the
[1:56:57] next service amen God bless you you can
[1:56:58] stand this
[1:57:03] morning you hope to only have to do that
[1:57:05] maybe once every 20
[1:57:08] years but I trust you understand for the
[1:57:11] sake of our young people to understand
[1:57:12] this because you're going to be talking
[1:57:14] with people at some point and they're
[1:57:16] not going to be able to tell you what
[1:57:17] this what really happened here and you
[1:57:19] need to you need to be able to tell them
[1:57:21] or point them to something like this and
[1:57:23] say this is what we believe by the
[1:57:24] scriptures and we'll go into it and as
