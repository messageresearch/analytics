[47:09] amen
[47:11] so Lord bless and to bring you greetings
[47:14] from our brother car in New Brunswick he
[47:17] called last evening and looking forward
[47:21] to fellowship really on the phone called
[47:24] me from his church because they have
[47:26] they have services on Saturday usually a
[47:28] prayer service I believe on Saturday
[47:30] night and they have services Wednesday
[47:33] and and again on Sunday so so he sends
[47:38] his greetings to the Saints here and he
[47:41] also informed me that there is a couple
[47:44] another couple from British Columbia
[47:47] that will be traveling to Newfoundland
[47:50] and to st. John's and I understand that
[47:53] they are not Canadians they are the man
[47:57] I think is from Australia so right now
[48:01] they're just travelling across Canada I
[48:02] believe I guest visiting different
[48:04] churches they were not able I don't
[48:06] think to to get to other cars of 70 or
[48:09] service but he did meet the brother
[48:11] somewhere and he told him that he was on
[48:13] his way to Newfoundland but I think
[48:16] right now they might be in in alle facts
[48:18] Nova Scotia so I am not familiar with
[48:22] their name but but someone had told him
[48:26] about us and the church here so he said
[48:29] he was planning on visiting with the
[48:31] Saints here in st. John's but eventually
[48:34] I think you're later on this summer or
[48:37] this year they're planning on moving
[48:39] back to Australia so we pray the grace
[48:42] of God to be with that couple whoever
[48:44] they are and wherever they are at this
[48:46] time a man and again let's be in prayer
[48:50] for our brother car and also pray for
[48:51] sister car
[48:52] I understand according to what he
[48:54] explained that sister car a few days ago
[48:58] had accidentally fallen and she had
[49:02] tripped in something and fallen down and
[49:04] hurt her and and she's having much pain
[49:08] in in one of her hands so we pray the
[49:12] grace of God
[49:13] whither and the doctors apparently
[49:15] couldn't do anything with it or about it
[49:17] and so on so we pray grace to be with
[49:21] our sister cart this time and encourage
[49:23] her and also we thank the Lord for the
[49:29] visit of our brother Rumpke and brother
[49:32] and sister wonky and oh brother Matthew
[49:36] got two and sister amber got to meet the
[49:38] met brother Bob's I believe that was
[49:40] good
[49:41] and I think brother Mark was talking to
[49:43] him amen
[49:44] so what we took them out for a lunch
[49:46] yesterday or not yesterday Friday and it
[49:51] was very spiritual and we talked mainly
[49:54] about the Lord and the things of the
[49:56] Lord and at one and two finally when
[49:59] we're getting close to the end we all
[50:01] joined hands around the table in the
[50:03] restaurant and and he prayed so we thank
[50:07] the Lord for that and we pray god bless
[50:09] brother rocky and we really appreciated
[50:13] the the spiritual part of our
[50:16] conversation talking about the Lord and
[50:18] the things of the Lord and of course the
[50:21] things that we believe he wanted to know
[50:24] who we were
[50:24] where headquarters was when our
[50:28] headquarters is in glory amen most
[50:31] churches got headquarters somewhere in a
[50:33] city on down the earth but I said no we
[50:35] don't have any quarters not it not it
[50:37] not around here and every Church I said
[50:40] is independent by the grace of God so I
[50:44] did say there was a there was a group by
[50:48] city in Indiana and I said they usually
[50:50] do the printing and and published the
[50:54] messages and so on for the for the
[50:57] believers to read or to hear and so but
[51:01] again it was good and we kept the right
[51:04] spirit one toward another so I pray god
[51:07] bless our brother romkey and again
[51:09] sister romkey and she had thanked me for
[51:14] prayer and it was something that
[51:15] happened many many years ago because
[51:19] there was 1995 when the the Adventist
[51:23] school are yes and the other two church
[51:25] run
[51:26] schools when they closed and because the
[51:29] government stopped supporting the
[51:31] teachers and because the government was
[51:33] paying the teachers in the Salvation
[51:36] Army in the Adventists in the Pentecost
[51:38] and he and another in Catholic schools
[51:40] but then the salvage then the government
[51:43] stopped doing that and a lot of the
[51:46] so-called
[51:47] church schools closed so and it was 1995
[51:53] may even back then when she had
[51:55] mentioned that I had prayed for her and
[51:57] that the Lord had responded practically
[52:01] immediately and she was healed and she
[52:04] was given that all she said I thank you
[52:07] for that I said well I said thank the
[52:09] Lord I said to God be the glory
[52:11] so that's good I do remember that the
[52:15] last graduation ceremony they had in the
[52:17] event of skadam II they did call on me
[52:20] to close in prayer and I do remember
[52:23] praying for a sister who was sick at the
[52:26] time and so I said the Lord might have
[52:31] been her
[52:31] maybe another sister but the Lord did
[52:34] answer prayer and he will that sister
[52:36] thank the Lord
[52:38] so to God be the glory we discussed some
[52:41] other issues but again thank God for the
[52:44] grace of God keeping the right spirit
[52:46] and a right attitude respecting one
[52:48] another and of course he brought he
[52:50] brought off of those students that he
[52:54] taught and he knew the parents Bob and
[52:58] Brendan Marcum pouring and they were
[53:01] bringing them up and so on then he
[53:03] mentioned the students and I think about
[53:06] maybe brother Matthew and I know if they
[53:09] were top of mr. rocky or not you okay
[53:12] there were others our daughter Sharon
[53:15] was taught by mr. Anki amen
[53:17] so we really appreciate we appreciated
[53:20] the did Venice school we did yeah when
[53:24] we moved in here in 1960 and from
[53:29] Paradise to st. John's in 62 my parents
[53:32] put us in church Ron schools they put
[53:36] some of my family in The Salvation Army
[53:38] booth Memorial High School
[53:40] and then they put some more of us into
[53:43] the seventh-day Adventist Academy a man
[53:45] and it was good and brother you don't
[53:47] find schools like that today not by any
[53:50] means because during the break or during
[53:53] the lunch hours they would play gospel
[53:56] music over the PA system now you're not
[53:58] like not even allowed to read the Bible
[54:00] in a school that's right so we thank God
[54:03] for the influence that they had on our
[54:06] young people amen and they respect us
[54:10] thank the Lord and also I believe that
[54:14] maybe you are familiar with mrs. Pierce
[54:16] II she was a principal I think of the
[54:19] elementary school when they built the
[54:21] elementary and understand that she's
[54:23] having physical problems as well and her
[54:26] husband I think is in right now it's in
[54:28] the Millers in in the L Science Center
[54:30] so and because he's had problems also
[54:33] with his with his back so and then
[54:35] infection so we pray the grace of God to
[54:39] mr. mrs. Pierce E and they've been good
[54:42] to us to a man if they met us out there
[54:44] anywhere sauce they come right to us
[54:46] they they they they appreciated the
[54:49] fellowship amen
[54:50] so thank God we were we were witness to
[54:53] them and so the grace of God be with
[54:56] them any man so also there be more of
[55:02] these books out there healing thoughts
[55:05] by the they were printed by believers
[55:09] International and they're put together I
[55:11] guess my sister Rebecca some years ago
[55:13] and brother George Smith so and also a
[55:18] brother called me and he asked for the
[55:22] article on the cremation and so I'll put
[55:25] more of the books out there on cremation
[55:27] is it Christian now of course we know
[55:30] that it is not Christian a man but it's
[55:33] getting to the place where her brother
[55:36] approached me from another denomination
[55:38] out there and he said always said what
[55:41] do you think of cremation
[55:43] he said because even our clergy is
[55:45] getting cremated and so on well I gave
[55:49] him the thoughts on it and he agreed
[55:51] he's I agree he said they shouldn't be
[55:53] doing that
[55:53] because cremation is not Christian and
[55:57] of course I've been approached as well
[55:59] all due respect by a believer who stated
[56:02] that that's what he was going to be he
[56:03] was going to be cremated a message
[56:05] believer I know message believers have
[56:07] been cremated and I said no it's not
[56:10] Christian is not and I said the Prophet
[56:12] said concerning cremation their prophet
[56:15] said that that the righteous are going
[56:17] to walk it on the Astra's of the wicked
[56:19] he said because God is going to cremate
[56:22] the wicked amen so brother sister
[56:27] barbarously would go back to dust not to
[56:29] ashes a man dusted us by the grace of
[56:32] God amen so god help us to stay with the
[56:36] truth and stay in line
[56:37] amen by the grace of God so listen this
[56:40] not get caught up with the world or the
[56:43] things of the world not the way the
[56:44] world is doing things just the way God
[56:46] wants us to do it
[56:47] amen and I want to emphasize some of
[56:49] these sauce this morning from a message
[56:51] that the Prophet preached in 1965 and is
[56:54] entitled I have heard but now I see a
[56:57] man so it's hearing it and seeing it by
[57:00] the grace of God and by the power of the
[57:02] Holy Ghost you seen it as God sees that
[57:05] hearing it as God would want us to hear
[57:07] it by the grace of God so there's a
[57:10] reason that our brother preached this in
[57:11] November 1965 just shortly before the
[57:15] accident and it was in Shreveport our
[57:18] brother Jack Norris assembly that he had
[57:20] preached six sermons one right after the
[57:23] other one day after another six services
[57:26] right during the evenings and I believe
[57:28] it was during this time that he had
[57:30] preached one of the sermons and after he
[57:33] preached the sermon there are some
[57:35] people called that it herded on the edge
[57:38] of telephone woke up and it was people
[57:41] called and told brother Jack Moore they
[57:43] said listen don't get William Branham to
[57:46] preach anymore there don't let him
[57:48] preach the morning and so on but brother
[57:51] brother Jack Moore went looking for
[57:53] brother Branham and couldn't find him he
[57:55] went to this hotel that hotel couldn't
[57:57] find willing Rena and so he just went on
[58:00] back and brother bound he showed up at
[58:02] the service and preached again a man
[58:04] because the Lord didn't want brother
[58:06] Jack Moore to stop
[58:07] the Prophet he knew my brother Jack more
[58:10] anyone to stop the message so god help
[58:13] us mother that says I have heard but now
[58:16] I see this hear it the way God wants us
[58:19] to hear let's see it the way that God
[58:21] wants us to see it a man by the grace of
[58:24] God this stand again and sing only
[58:26] believe all things are possible only
[58:28] believe amen so again be in prayer for
[58:33] the brothers sister romkey they they're
[58:36] leaving to go back to Alberta on Tuesday
[58:39] and this might be their last trip here
[58:42] and I assume this is why they made
[58:44] contact with our brother mark sister
[58:45] Maureen and our brother Bob and sister
[58:48] Brenda he did say that he may not be
[58:51] back again so he just wants to greet
[58:54] greet those that he knew and and those
[58:57] that know him amen
[58:59] so God's grace and when we were even
[59:03] fellowshiping with him fighting that I
[59:05] did show them the pictures of the church
[59:06] and the brothers and sisters in the
[59:08] church and some of some of you of course
[59:11] he recognized and he knew amen
[59:14] so I certainly thank God for his spirit
[59:16] and his attitude amen so this saying
[59:19] only believe all things are possible
[59:21] Oh

[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:21] a man praise the Lord
[1:07:27] god bless turn with me to st. Mark's
[1:07:29] Gospel chapter 4 st. Mark's Gospel
[1:07:32] chapter for the grace of God be with us
[1:07:41] in the going forth of his word a man
[1:07:44] it's been a battle spiritually trying to
[1:07:50] determine what God would have me to
[1:07:52] minister on and it's been up and down
[1:07:56] and in and out of course being busy with
[1:07:58] others as well and other others
[1:08:00] situations other circumstances so I've
[1:08:04] been in prayer and I said Lord I said
[1:08:05] please I said give me direction and
[1:08:07] leadership and I was thinking about
[1:08:09] maybe our brother LaFontaine and
[1:08:11] ministry on some of the things that he
[1:08:13] was talking about and our brother being
[1:08:15] nor odd but the Lord had me to lay it
[1:08:19] aside and to get to come to this message
[1:08:22] right here I have heard but not I now I
[1:08:23] see a man maybe we can also apply that
[1:08:27] to our brother for the fontains messages
[1:08:30] and all sort of other Ben Norris
[1:08:32] messages and the other message that
[1:08:34] we've heard so far this year so we pray
[1:08:37] the grace of God that we will hear as
[1:08:39] God wants us to hear it and we're going
[1:08:41] to see it as God wants us to see it
[1:08:43] a man and the Prophet is highlighting it
[1:08:46] how we're going to hear it how are we
[1:08:48] going to see it what are we going to
[1:08:50] hear and what are we going to see and we
[1:08:53] would surely we've got to make sure that
[1:08:55] we're right in this hour we're in the
[1:08:58] Bible says it's going to be so if it's
[1:09:00] so close it would to see the very elect
[1:09:02] a man there's going to be that there's
[1:09:05] going to be the truth the absolute truth
[1:09:07] and there's going to be a another truth
[1:09:09] that is so close that it's there it's
[1:09:12] just one thing wrong with it maybe
[1:09:14] they've added something or took away
[1:09:15] something a man but there's many a
[1:09:18] believer being deceived a man because
[1:09:21] they think it's the message they think
[1:09:23] it's what the Prophet said they think is
[1:09:26] what God has said or what I heard this
[1:09:28] and I see this but let's make sure that
[1:09:30] we're going to see as God wants us to
[1:09:32] see and not as what the devil wants us
[1:09:34] to see
[1:09:35] a man sir I understand that where we we
[1:09:38] but we got a battle on our hands a man
[1:09:40] now that it's not just fighting with our
[1:09:42] flesh and ourselves
[1:09:43] it's the anointing that comes in our
[1:09:46] flesh a man because we are born in sin
[1:09:49] is Satan working on our minds is Satan
[1:09:52] working in a you know in our in our
[1:09:53] physical means and so on and the poverty
[1:09:56] lights those things right here and we'll
[1:09:58] get to it and show you that one one of
[1:10:01] the characters that in the scripture
[1:10:03] that the part of God I lights in the
[1:10:05] message I have heard but now I see a man
[1:10:08] and he said he takes his tax from that
[1:10:11] from the book about that brother a man
[1:10:14] and not only that that book was is the
[1:10:16] oldest book in the Bible and that's not
[1:10:18] Genesis no no no this book was not
[1:10:21] before Genesis a man because this
[1:10:24] brother was in existence before before
[1:10:26] Moses and so on but God ordained that he
[1:10:30] would have a part in in the word God
[1:10:32] ordained that is his testimony would be
[1:10:35] in the word and the power of God goes
[1:10:37] back to that brothers testimony and he
[1:10:39] takes the text there and he highlights
[1:10:41] it and he said now we want to see what
[1:10:43] our God looked at this brother how God
[1:10:46] looked at this man any man so I was God
[1:10:48] looking at you and that was God looking
[1:10:50] at me a man and what does God see when
[1:10:53] he looks at you when it's God see when
[1:10:54] he looks at me brother and the Prophet
[1:10:56] our light so this is what God saw when
[1:10:58] he looked at this man and this is what
[1:11:00] God heard when he went when he when he
[1:11:02] paid attention to this man this is the
[1:11:04] response that God got when God did this
[1:11:07] to this man and God allowed this happen
[1:11:09] to this man and so on and he how I guess
[1:11:12] you maybe you know some of you only know
[1:11:13] who it is it's joke a man and brother
[1:11:17] it's amazing that God let the devil do
[1:11:19] this to JoVE let the devil do that to
[1:11:20] joke but God had a reason because God
[1:11:23] wanted wanted wanted to bring out job's
[1:11:25] confession jobs faith and job's belief
[1:11:28] what joel had heard and what he saw a
[1:11:31] man and brother joke joke makes that
[1:11:33] confession of what he had heard and what
[1:11:35] he said what he saw a man and it pleased
[1:11:38] the lord so so what god what we have
[1:11:41] heard and what we see does it please God
[1:11:43] but we got to hear it God who the way
[1:11:46] that God wants us to hear it
[1:11:48] we got to see it the way that God wants
[1:11:49] us to see it a man and it so that it
[1:11:52] pleases God and this is this is what the
[1:11:55] Prophet is a lady because again he knew
[1:11:57] he was coming to the end of his ministry
[1:11:59] he knew that he was coming to the end of
[1:12:01] his physical life because he mentions it
[1:12:04] again that he may not be here for this
[1:12:07] he may not be here for that but he said
[1:12:08] you will some of you will a man so and
[1:12:12] indeed we are and we are seeing the
[1:12:14] things that he's warning about because
[1:12:16] people are not hearing it the way they
[1:12:18] should hear it and they're not seeing it
[1:12:20] the way they should see it a man no no
[1:12:22] no no no there there there they got into
[1:12:25] the dynamics but not in the mechanics
[1:12:27] rather but again not the dynamics and
[1:12:29] again he highlights that in the end the
[1:12:32] message on I have earned and now I see a
[1:12:34] man what is that some people are hearing
[1:12:36] that the mechanics but they're not
[1:12:38] seeing the dynamics they're not seeing
[1:12:41] it as God is revealing it then I've seen
[1:12:43] it as God is doing this and as God is
[1:12:45] doing that that I've seen when God is
[1:12:47] trying to reveal to them a man so I pray
[1:12:50] grace in the name of the Lord that we're
[1:12:52] going to see as God wants us to see and
[1:12:54] we're going to hear it as God wants us
[1:12:56] to hear it now I'm by the letter but by
[1:12:58] the dynamics of the revealed word and in
[1:13:01] st. Mark's Gospel and in verse 13 and he
[1:13:09] said unto them know ye not this parable
[1:13:12] and out of then will he know all
[1:13:14] parables and the sower soweth the word a
[1:13:19] man and these are they by the wayside
[1:13:24] where the word is sown but when they
[1:13:27] have heard Satan cometh immediately and
[1:13:32] taketh away the word that was sown in
[1:13:34] their hearts so we have to be on our
[1:13:37] guard we have to make our calling and
[1:13:40] election sure a man they were born of
[1:13:44] God we're not under the influence of the
[1:13:46] devil but under the influence of Jesus
[1:13:49] and it says after he said these are they
[1:13:51] that by the way sight where the word is
[1:13:54] sown but when they have earned it says
[1:13:57] Satan cometh immediately
[1:13:59] a man so Satan is here he's here to
[1:14:04] cause us to doubt the word that is going
[1:14:07] forth he's here to cause us to question
[1:14:09] the word that is going forth he's here
[1:14:11] to get us to hand to it or to take away
[1:14:13] from it so the grace of God be with us
[1:14:15] brother there leave it the way that it
[1:14:17] is that the Papa said now he said don't
[1:14:20] make it any bigger than what it is
[1:14:21] don't make it any smaller than what it
[1:14:23] is he said leave it the way that it is a
[1:14:25] man because it is God in and God
[1:14:28] revealed in simplicity a man so he said
[1:14:32] these are they likewise which are sown
[1:14:35] on stony ground who when they have heard
[1:14:38] the word I have heard but do you see a
[1:14:43] man who when they have heard the word
[1:14:46] immediately receive it with gladness a
[1:14:50] man and have no root in themselves and
[1:14:55] so endure but for taught for a time
[1:14:59] afterward when affliction or persecution
[1:15:01] arises for the words sake immediately
[1:15:04] they are offended a man so they have
[1:15:09] heard the word but they're not really
[1:15:11] going to respond to it the way that the
[1:15:13] believer responds the way that God wants
[1:15:15] us to respond a man to the word and
[1:15:18] these are they which are sown among
[1:15:20] thorns such as hear the word a man you
[1:15:25] can hear it you can say you see it but
[1:15:28] if you've got to see it the way God
[1:15:29] wants you to see it you've got to hear
[1:15:32] the way that God wants you to hear a man
[1:15:34] and it says and the cares of this world
[1:15:38] and the deceitfulness of riches and the
[1:15:44] lusts of other things entering in choke
[1:15:47] the word so what in your life and what
[1:15:51] is in my life that is choking the
[1:15:53] revelation of the word that God has
[1:15:55] given us a man preventing us from scene
[1:15:58] of the way that we shouldn't see it a
[1:16:00] man preventing us from recognizing it
[1:16:04] the way that we should recognize it Amen
[1:16:06] why because we're allowing the cares of
[1:16:09] this world and the deceitfulness of
[1:16:11] riches and the lusts of others
[1:16:13] things Adrian they're loaded to choke
[1:16:16] the revelation of the word a man or we
[1:16:19] believe Garson a prophet we believe God
[1:16:21] opened up the seven seals we believe a
[1:16:24] God called us out of denominations and
[1:16:27] we're out we're in the message we're
[1:16:28] going into the resurrection rapture
[1:16:30] there's more to it than that a man God
[1:16:33] wants to manifest himself in you God
[1:16:36] wants to reveal himself in you and
[1:16:37] through you amen
[1:16:39] the same yesterday today and forever is
[1:16:42] more than just the mechanics of the word
[1:16:44] God wants to make the word flesh in you
[1:16:47] a man not knowledge in yuba flesh in you
[1:16:50] a man not in your head but in your heart
[1:16:54] so that is not a let us not allow the
[1:16:57] cares of this world or the deceitfulness
[1:16:59] of riches or the lusts for other things
[1:17:02] in the world entering in earth and choke
[1:17:05] the message a man and he becometh
[1:17:08] unfruitful and many a believer as allow
[1:17:11] these things to happen in their lives
[1:17:13] and they still profess to be believers
[1:17:15] but they are not and these are they
[1:17:21] which are sown on good ground such as
[1:17:24] again hear the word then one of the
[1:17:28] prophets that i have heard now I see a
[1:17:30] man but again you guys you got to hear
[1:17:34] it
[1:17:34] the way of a seat of God you're going to
[1:17:38] hear what God wants you to hear how God
[1:17:41] wants you to hear and you're going to
[1:17:42] see what God wants you to see there's
[1:17:45] many a man and a woman out there today
[1:17:47] and the message so called and brother
[1:17:49] they're not hearing what God wants them
[1:17:51] to hear and they're not seeing where God
[1:17:53] wants them to see amen because the devil
[1:17:55] is interpreting it and causing them to
[1:17:58] believe this and believe that this is
[1:17:59] what it means is what it means brother
[1:18:01] God is gonna make it flesh in you a man
[1:18:05] and there in little it will declare
[1:18:06] itself in the life that you live
[1:18:09] it'll declare itself in what God does
[1:18:11] for us and what God is doing for us amen
[1:18:14] and he said again and he said it
[1:18:18] becometh unfruitful
[1:18:20] cerissa is amazing is the message
[1:18:23] fruitful in your life amen
[1:18:26] are you there is it in control of your
[1:18:27] life isn't in control of what you do how
[1:18:30] you do it when you do it where you do it
[1:18:31] a man so is it the message in control
[1:18:35] are you Ewing you controlling the
[1:18:36] message
[1:18:37] oh I control this doctrine I control
[1:18:40] this I control that no it's got to be in
[1:18:42] you controlling you a man and these are
[1:18:46] they which are sown on good ground and
[1:18:48] such as hear the word of God and receive
[1:18:51] it and bring forth fruit you got to
[1:18:56] bring forth the fruit of the revealed
[1:18:58] Word a man is not just to say I believe
[1:19:03] this and I believe that I got a
[1:19:04] knowledge of this and I got a knowledge
[1:19:06] of this I got understanding of this
[1:19:07] understanding of that no no it's gotta
[1:19:09] be the word in place there's going to be
[1:19:10] you the Word made flesh a man if you're
[1:19:13] if you're a part of the invisible union
[1:19:15] of Christ and by the prophet of God also
[1:19:17] preached this message in in brother Jack
[1:19:20] Morris Church in Shreveport in
[1:19:22] concerning the invisible Union so
[1:19:25] brothers sister I pray grace that we're
[1:19:27] bringing for the fruits of those that
[1:19:30] are in the invisible union with the
[1:19:31] heavenly bridegroom amen praise the name
[1:19:35] of the Lord that you are the bride he's
[1:19:37] the right room you're going to go and
[1:19:39] you're going to hear the word as the
[1:19:40] bride will hear you're going to see it
[1:19:42] as a great season and you're going to
[1:19:44] live it as the bride leaves it amen
[1:19:47] you talk about separation it is an
[1:19:49] absolute total separation onto the Lord
[1:19:51] as to the total separation under the
[1:19:54] break room that's the total separation
[1:19:56] onto the revelation of the resurrection
[1:19:58] and the rapture we're caught up with
[1:20:00] this we're not caught up with anything
[1:20:02] else a man and then they're going to
[1:20:05] wonder about us and all what's wrong
[1:20:07] with you what's wrong with you you don't
[1:20:08] have nothing to do with this one or this
[1:20:10] one or this one or that one are there so
[1:20:11] they're no longer cut off with him up
[1:20:13] with a with a revelation in another
[1:20:15] world a man in another realm in the
[1:20:18] world to come
[1:20:19] a man god help us that were going to be
[1:20:22] as Christians we're going to be
[1:20:25] christ-like and that's what a Christian
[1:20:27] is this crates like a man bringing for
[1:20:30] the fruit of Christ in us and he said
[1:20:33] but he said now he said some dirty fall
[1:20:35] and some sixty and some hundred
[1:20:39] well brother down through the ages there
[1:20:41] was some thirtyfold
[1:20:42] and some sixty my God's looking for a
[1:20:45] hundred percent in the right for the
[1:20:49] rest a man as it was in the prophets in
[1:20:51] the Old Testament it was made manifest a
[1:20:54] hundred percent in Christ
[1:20:55] a man may manifest said portions down
[1:20:59] through the church ages but now it is
[1:21:01] absolutely made flesh in the bright mrs.
[1:21:04] Jesus Christ a million that's a
[1:21:06] tremendous revelation what that's Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ yeah but you're a missus Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ what a position to be in
[1:21:14] god help us amen that we're going to
[1:21:17] hear the way we should hear it and we're
[1:21:18] gonna see it the way we should see it
[1:21:20] and know who we are
[1:21:21] amen by the grace of God so in praying
[1:21:25] God that we're on numbered with those
[1:21:28] that receive it and hear it and see it a
[1:21:31] hundred full amen god bless you may be
[1:21:34] seated
[1:21:38] so the grace of God if we go further
[1:21:41] into these thoughts concerning I have
[1:21:44] heard but now I see hearing is one thing
[1:21:47] but seeing is another amen there are
[1:21:50] those that hear this and hear that but
[1:21:52] they don't see it there are those that
[1:21:53] are there to hear this and hear that and
[1:21:55] they know this they know that but they
[1:21:56] don't understand it a man even even in
[1:21:59] the natural and as it is in the natural
[1:22:01] Saudis and the spiritual so hearing is
[1:22:04] one thing but seeing is another there
[1:22:06] are those that have heard the message
[1:22:08] those that are hearing the message but
[1:22:10] they're not seeing the message because
[1:22:12] if they're going to see it it's going to
[1:22:14] reflect itself in them and through them
[1:22:16] a man it's good it's going to God is
[1:22:18] going to make it flesh in that brother
[1:22:20] in that sister in that son and daughter
[1:22:22] a man if not it's not God is not just
[1:22:25] calling us to say well now I want you to
[1:22:27] hear the message and I want you to go
[1:22:29] ahead and be a witness for the message
[1:22:30] and we're good and we'll tell tell
[1:22:32] somebody this will tell somebody that no
[1:22:34] no yeah what do what God the way that
[1:22:36] God wants you to reveal it to it to
[1:22:39] others it's or the life that you live
[1:22:40] it's through your spirit and your
[1:22:42] attitude your motives your objectives a
[1:22:45] man they're going to see that in you a
[1:22:48] man there's many a believer out there
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:51] that's instant in season had a season as
[1:22:53] it were but not for the right thing but
[1:22:55] for the wrong there is an in season at a
[1:22:57] season to tell somebody this to tell
[1:23:00] them this to tell them that and to
[1:23:01] condemn this and to condemn that no no
[1:23:03] don't do that as opposed they as God
[1:23:06] correct you the Prophet concerning the
[1:23:08] Rickey's and rec hadiths and he said
[1:23:09] don't call him Ricky's don't comprehend
[1:23:11] us and don't look at him with this
[1:23:13] attitude in that spirit he's because
[1:23:16] some of them he said are my children
[1:23:17] amen
[1:23:19] but see they are self righteous and then
[1:23:21] they feel that they're they're better
[1:23:23] than them they feel that they know more
[1:23:24] than them yeah yeah well they don't know
[1:23:27] it as they ought to know it if they're
[1:23:28] going to condemn that person amen no no
[1:23:31] because if you're gonna know it as you
[1:23:33] ought to know it brother it's going to
[1:23:34] take effect in your life any man is
[1:23:37] going to you're the one that's Korea is
[1:23:38] going to line up with it it's going to
[1:23:40] have control of you it's not you
[1:23:42] controlling them it's neither you
[1:23:44] controlling that and you controlling
[1:23:45] something else it's against the word
[1:23:47] controlling you
[1:23:48] amen and it's Jesus in you by the grace
[1:23:52] of Almighty God amen brother sister this
[1:23:55] is what Jesus wanted when he was in the
[1:23:57] flesh 2,000 years ago
[1:23:59] Alleluia he wanted them to submit to him
[1:24:02] and submit to his leadership to hit to
[1:24:03] the revelation of the word a man they
[1:24:06] they they wanted them to hear it the way
[1:24:08] that they they needed to hear anyone to
[1:24:10] see it the way they needed to see it but
[1:24:12] all they were seeing with signs and
[1:24:14] wonders they might but they were not
[1:24:16] seeing the revealed word as the God
[1:24:19] wanted them to see it they were not
[1:24:21] seeing that God was making his word
[1:24:23] flesh in Jesus Christ
[1:24:26] a man oh they they they had the
[1:24:28] revelation like us today brother the Old
[1:24:31] Testament Saints they are not old the
[1:24:34] Old Testament they had a revelation of
[1:24:36] Messiah Messiah God's going to do this
[1:24:38] God's going to do that
[1:24:40] amen and when God did it they didn't
[1:24:42] hear it the right way and they didn't
[1:24:43] see it the right way
[1:24:44] amen but they they they recognize signs
[1:24:48] and wonders well you know a man the same
[1:24:51] thing they said about went around they
[1:24:52] said about Jesus well you know I what
[1:24:54] kind of man do this and do this and and
[1:24:56] then preach the way he's preaching we're
[1:24:59] going to have those signs and then teach
[1:25:01] what he is teaching amen oh they wanted
[1:25:04] to sign
[1:25:05] the one of the they wanted healing they
[1:25:07] wanted the miracles but they didn't want
[1:25:09] the word amen
[1:25:10] why because to hear it the way they
[1:25:12] needed to hear it and to see the way
[1:25:14] they needed God wanted them to see it
[1:25:17] was going to change their lives it was
[1:25:19] going to change their attitude it was
[1:25:21] going to change their spirit a man and
[1:25:23] brother their their emphasis wouldn't be
[1:25:25] put on this wouldn't be on that no no no
[1:25:27] and that was going to be on Christ now
[1:25:29] there's going to be on Redemption now
[1:25:31] it's going to be a million on the
[1:25:32] finished work of Calvary praise the name
[1:25:34] of the Lord
[1:25:35] but brother they they were under the law
[1:25:37] so much and they had their the mechanics
[1:25:40] of the law but not that they're really
[1:25:41] the dynamics of it they didn't have the
[1:25:43] spiritual revelation of what God was
[1:25:46] revealing in the Old Testament they just
[1:25:48] as you said the the mechanics the the
[1:25:51] natural oh I heard this I heard this but
[1:25:54] they didn't see what God wanted to see
[1:25:55] in it a man Cain never saw what it what
[1:25:59] Abel saw all my brothers sister Cain saw
[1:26:03] this they came to when I went out he did
[1:26:05] this and did that they and he did it for
[1:26:07] the Lord a man but it didn't please God
[1:26:11] a man it wasn't the more excellent
[1:26:13] sacrifice but evil aid the more
[1:26:16] excellent sacrifice a million because he
[1:26:19] heard of the way that God wanted him to
[1:26:20] hear and he saw the way that God wanted
[1:26:23] them to see it any any win any
[1:26:24] manifested it a man and he put his life
[1:26:27] I right brother on on that on that
[1:26:30] revelation he was willing to is willing
[1:26:33] to sacrifice his life for that
[1:26:34] revelation because could because when he
[1:26:36] did what he did and God Hannah and our
[1:26:39] brother some years ago the room
[1:26:42] highlighting the scriptures and he said
[1:26:44] brother he said we know it's not right
[1:26:46] there in the Bible but he said I believe
[1:26:48] this is what happened and he said he
[1:26:50] said when he come in it when Abel offer
[1:26:52] his sacrifice he said God came down in
[1:26:55] fire and consumed it amen just like he
[1:26:58] did when Moses went up on the Mount and
[1:27:00] he had those others there you know and
[1:27:02] they were offering this sacrifice the
[1:27:04] sacrifice the false gods to false gods
[1:27:06] and he proposes would I be with their
[1:27:10] sacrifice and they built an altar and he
[1:27:12] surrounded it by water a man
[1:27:15] and the sacrifice was will mine it was
[1:27:18] water everywhere a man but he knew God
[1:27:21] was going to answer by fire praise the
[1:27:23] Lord hallelujah brother God does that
[1:27:27] sometimes too so that the challenging
[1:27:29] our faith you know you make it well
[1:27:31] naturally to us in our natural sight and
[1:27:33] our feelings well no no no God can't do
[1:27:36] that because of these God wouldn't do
[1:27:38] can't do that because of the old man oh
[1:27:40] my brother you got too much water you
[1:27:42] think God's going to answer by fire and
[1:27:44] he said with all the water you got on
[1:27:47] the sacrifice all the water you got
[1:27:49] around the altar and Moses knew God was
[1:27:51] going to answer a million Moses just
[1:27:54] stood there and waited to their to the
[1:27:56] others that offer their sacrifices to
[1:27:58] their false gods and he said always say
[1:28:01] and then there was no response and what
[1:28:03] did he say always say they says your God
[1:28:05] must be asleep he won't be taking a nap
[1:28:09] and he just highlighted that he was
[1:28:12] making light of their God and and of
[1:28:14] what they believed because there was
[1:28:15] false
[1:28:16] amen so he waited and they when the our
[1:28:19] come and the time came for him a man he
[1:28:22] called on the Lord and the fire came
[1:28:24] down and brother the fire consumed the
[1:28:27] water the fire consumed the sacrifice
[1:28:29] and the fire was all around and over the
[1:28:31] altar a man see it's hearing it the way
[1:28:35] that God wants to stare is seen of the
[1:28:37] way that God wants us to see it and God
[1:28:39] is going to do it the way that he wants
[1:28:41] to do it amen
[1:28:42] it's hearing this word and this message
[1:28:44] the way that God wants us to hear it has
[1:28:46] seen us seeing the message the way God
[1:28:48] wants us to see it and brother God is
[1:28:51] going to make it flashing you the way
[1:28:52] that he wants to do it he's gonna he's
[1:28:54] going to manifest it in you and through
[1:28:56] you a man the way that he is prophesied
[1:28:59] a man this has got to be according to
[1:29:01] the word a man not not like they did in
[1:29:04] previous ages not under Cain did what he
[1:29:07] did but let's let's see what Abel did
[1:29:09] and Cain killed Abel a man because Abel
[1:29:14] did it according to a God wanting to do
[1:29:16] it Ava thought the way that God wanted
[1:29:18] the same but Cain would not accept it
[1:29:20] and brothers the same thing today it has
[1:29:23] been in every age God has revealed it
[1:29:25] this way God has done it this way amen
[1:29:27] but they but the enemy is there or to
[1:29:29] say this to say that and to get people
[1:29:33] to turn away from the truth to get the
[1:29:35] people to turn away - and not to not to
[1:29:37] hear it the way that God wants them to
[1:29:39] hear it not to see the way that God
[1:29:41] wants them to see it a man so I pray God
[1:29:44] in the name of the Lord now pay
[1:29:46] attention to that word hearing and
[1:29:48] seeing a man because we're coming to a
[1:29:51] revelation about we're going to hear and
[1:29:54] how we're going to see by the grace of
[1:29:56] God the way that God wants us to hear
[1:29:58] and the way that God wants us to see it
[1:30:01] a mad and again there's going to be very
[1:30:04] very few when it comes to the time of
[1:30:07] the resurrection the time of the rapture
[1:30:08] there's going to be very few that hear
[1:30:11] it the way that God wants them to hear
[1:30:13] it and there's very very shoe that are
[1:30:16] seen it the way that God wants them to
[1:30:18] see it a man
[1:30:20] well they recognize the the the prophet
[1:30:22] they recognize Jesus they recognize the
[1:30:24] whole you know as surely a man you got
[1:30:27] to have gotta be with God and gotta
[1:30:29] gotta be from the Lord to do what he's
[1:30:30] doing ain't man brother sister what what
[1:30:33] about what he was saying whatever the
[1:30:36] message he was preaching there right
[1:30:39] there to believe this we believe these
[1:30:40] signs and wonders but they're not there
[1:30:42] to believe the word amen oh they'll
[1:30:46] believe the mechanics of it and they'll
[1:30:48] believe this portion this portion but
[1:30:50] they're not going to believe all of it
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] do not let go let God have his way in
[1:30:55] their everyday living everyday living
[1:30:58] every minute every second of the day
[1:31:01] oh Lord oh I'll do this and I'll do that
[1:31:03] Cain was willing to do this came with
[1:31:05] willing to do that for Berta but for a
[1:31:07] believers everyday living any needed
[1:31:10] that you need a fellowship with God he
[1:31:12] won a fellowship with God not just not
[1:31:14] just for that day that he offered the
[1:31:16] sacrifice amen
[1:31:18] but he won he won the revelation that
[1:31:19] God was going to accept it and God was
[1:31:21] going to be there
[1:31:22] amen even even after the sacrifice a man
[1:31:26] goggles could be with evil hey Manny God
[1:31:29] was going to direct him God was gonna
[1:31:30] lead him God was going to go him and
[1:31:31] brother and God did a man and it was for
[1:31:35] a witness to you and me a man
[1:31:38] and he gave what happened there outside
[1:31:40] the garden
[1:31:41] as a witness for you and me because
[1:31:43] they're their abode they both believe in
[1:31:44] God can't believe than God Cain talked
[1:31:47] with God a man he will believe in God
[1:31:49] able to talk with God a man and yet Cain
[1:31:53] was serpent seed he was absolute
[1:31:56] servants II and Abel was the seat of God
[1:31:59] and came with the seat of the serpent
[1:32:01] and yet they they they're both but
[1:32:03] worshiping God
[1:32:04] but again they're there one was under
[1:32:06] the right influence the other was under
[1:32:08] the wrong influence we got to make sure
[1:32:10] we're under the right influence not the
[1:32:12] wrong influence under they word of the
[1:32:14] anointing of the right spirit and not
[1:32:16] the wrong spirit amen
[1:32:17] because there's the Spirit of God the
[1:32:19] spirit of the devil but there's that
[1:32:21] spirit anointing on Cain and there is a
[1:32:24] spirit of 90 on yon table this is
[1:32:27] absolutely amazing
[1:32:29] amen bye brother and again many are
[1:32:32] deceived today by their by their false
[1:32:35] anointing that was on Cain is are many
[1:32:39] many today not just hardened
[1:32:40] denominations brother but it's it's
[1:32:42] denomination nondenominational
[1:32:44] interdenominational and even a message
[1:32:47] to churches amen
[1:32:48] there are those that are under the same
[1:32:50] spirit that Cain was under under the
[1:32:52] same anointing that came was under amen
[1:32:55] remember when the prophet of God
[1:32:56] preached the message on the indictment
[1:32:58] he just didn't indict the the
[1:33:00] denomination struck the second
[1:33:02] crucifixion of Christ he indicted a
[1:33:04] non-denominational Zana denominations a
[1:33:07] million and brother he would indict
[1:33:09] message believers for crucifying the the
[1:33:12] Word of God a man because they were
[1:33:15] doing that back in back in name when
[1:33:17] before God took the Prophet off the
[1:33:19] scene he knew what was going on
[1:33:21] amen like I explained in the message how
[1:33:24] can I overcome and he preached it in its
[1:33:27] own tabernacle why because there was
[1:33:30] many professing believers there that
[1:33:32] were not overcomers and he said you
[1:33:35] still want to live like those out there
[1:33:37] in denominations he says you want to
[1:33:40] believe this and believe that but live
[1:33:41] like them and he said no he said you got
[1:33:46] you got you knew they needed to be born
[1:33:47] to gain he knew they need to become
[1:33:49] overcomers
[1:33:51] amen brother Nigel's overcoming the
[1:33:54] letter
[1:33:54] the word but the diner now we're coming
[1:33:56] to dynamics rather but the mechanics a
[1:33:59] man she got overcome the mechanics to
[1:34:01] get to the dynamics brother their name
[1:34:04] but but Cain he didn't want to overcome
[1:34:06] the the mechanics but he wasn't
[1:34:10] interested in the dynamics God said if
[1:34:12] you do right what you will also be
[1:34:14] accepted but he wasn't interested he
[1:34:16] felt that he was right a man he was
[1:34:19] persuaded himself everything is I did
[1:34:21] this I did that look at look at his
[1:34:23] altar and all that he offered on his
[1:34:25] altar compared to what Abel offered on
[1:34:28] is a man
[1:34:30] oh my Cain had a big altar and he
[1:34:32] offered all of this all of this all
[1:34:34] those things that was growing in the
[1:34:35] field and here's Abel out there he got
[1:34:38] he got one altar and he brings him one
[1:34:40] lamb and kills it they do you don't just
[1:34:44] put the living lamb on it he puts a dead
[1:34:46] lamb on it there's not a living Laham
[1:34:49] it's a dead lamb and it's a lamb that
[1:34:51] it's full of blood amen
[1:34:53] and I think Abel is going to identify
[1:34:55] with that lamb and he's going to he's
[1:34:57] going to get blood on himself a man so
[1:35:00] brother/sister see you got to enter into
[1:35:02] that oneness with your sacrifice it
[1:35:05] covered Abel saying a man but God
[1:35:08] respect respected Abel and God honored
[1:35:10] Abel and accepted the sacrifice
[1:35:13] amen and God come down and consumed the
[1:35:16] sacrifice with fire but brother Cain
[1:35:18] didn't one that no no because he fell to
[1:35:21] this he did that so so God said to God
[1:35:24] should accept that no no no but that
[1:35:27] wasn't going to cover see him not by any
[1:35:30] means nor there was no blood in it as it
[1:35:32] was enable sacrifice a man but a brother
[1:35:36] how they live yeah brother Abel had a
[1:35:38] revelation something maybe they then
[1:35:41] Adam and Eve and explained outside the
[1:35:43] garden with it we're not we're no we
[1:35:45] don't have the record of it in the in
[1:35:46] Genesis all that happened when God came
[1:35:49] down and put them out of the garden but
[1:35:52] Abel got the revelation Abel heard what
[1:35:56] God wanted him to hear and Abel heard of
[1:35:59] the way guy wanted to hear and Abel saw
[1:36:01] it the way that God wanted him to see it
[1:36:03] hey babe
[1:36:05] boy that's why that's
[1:36:07] he brought that sacrifice cane didn't
[1:36:10] hear the way God wanted it here and cane
[1:36:12] didn't see it the way God wanted to see
[1:36:14] it because look at the sacrifice that he
[1:36:16] brought a oh he was pleasing to man he
[1:36:18] was pleasing to the church or to a human
[1:36:20] being it looked good it looked good but
[1:36:22] again it was just a brain a man he was
[1:36:26] going by his natural sight but not its
[1:36:28] virtual sight a man became but he was
[1:36:31] going by his spiritual sight to see it
[1:36:34] the way that God wanted to see it a
[1:36:36] million and a Harrod the way God wanted
[1:36:38] him to hear a man and and what he did
[1:36:41] proved it what he did it proved he heard
[1:36:44] it right what he did proved that he saw
[1:36:47] it right
[1:36:48] amen and God respected and God honored
[1:36:51] it and God responded to it with the fire
[1:36:54] of the Holy Ghost amen but you became
[1:36:57] was was absolutely upset because God
[1:37:00] never responded to him not in the way
[1:37:03] they responded to Cain now God came down
[1:37:06] and talked to him just saying hold I
[1:37:09] talk with God yes so did the devil I
[1:37:11] talk with God so he came a million and
[1:37:15] his believers feel that I had done this
[1:37:17] and I did this and I did that's right
[1:37:19] but again but again Saudi King are you
[1:37:21] going to do what you able did a man are
[1:37:25] we going to walk with God as Enoch
[1:37:27] walked a man brother you talk about
[1:37:29] hearing the word it Wade the way that
[1:37:31] God wanted him to hear it and seen it
[1:37:33] the way that God wanted him to see it
[1:37:35] brother
[1:37:36] Enoch saw it Heena heard it because the
[1:37:41] Bible says he had the faith that plays
[1:37:43] God a Marian and he was not because God
[1:37:45] took you anybody
[1:37:47] God took him into into it you do right
[1:37:51] bring glory amen so he's there waiting
[1:37:55] on us by the grace of Almighty God old
[1:37:58] brothers sister
[1:37:59] I have heard but now I see Cain heard
[1:38:03] but didn't see anybody the way that God
[1:38:07] wanted to see it okay
[1:38:08] they evil heard it and got and Abel saw
[1:38:11] what God wanted see a man and his
[1:38:13] worship reflected what he saw amen
[1:38:18] does your worship
[1:38:20] not just there in this building you
[1:38:23] worship God 24 hours a day a man you're
[1:38:26] constantly constantly in fellowship with
[1:38:28] God constantly 24 hours a day amen
[1:38:31] he never leaves you he never forsakes
[1:38:34] you he's there but they that yeah when
[1:38:39] we when we stumble and fall yoke
[1:38:40] Invictus yeah oh yeah he said he said we
[1:38:46] haven't where he said if we sin we ever
[1:38:48] we have a sacrifice we have the we have
[1:38:50] a mercy seat amen and it's Christ he's
[1:38:54] there
[1:38:55] amen the probably God said when we see
[1:38:57] him he said well it's Christ in the
[1:38:59] theophany form and he'll pull away and
[1:39:01] convict us then when we repent it comes
[1:39:04] very close to us again amen praise the
[1:39:08] name of the Lord the probably God oh
[1:39:10] yeah he preached it and even when he was
[1:39:13] preaching did the he felt the presence
[1:39:15] of obviously often Eeyore of Christ me
[1:39:18] get close to him sometimes he walk away
[1:39:19] from a man and and it was at the profit
[1:39:23] or somebody else that would was
[1:39:24] preaching and and everyone said well
[1:39:26] they turn around go back and shake
[1:39:28] brother Rams hand and they preached more
[1:39:31] come back and shake his hand why because
[1:39:33] the the anointing was pulling away and
[1:39:35] he wanted more of the anointing amen
[1:39:38] so Christ would come closer to him by
[1:39:40] the grace of God so brother it's airing
[1:39:43] there the way God wants us to hear it
[1:39:44] and seeing the way God wants to sash it
[1:39:46] and brother it'll produce the light that

[1:40:22] how does God want me see it
[1:40:26] amen well he brings that out in in the
[1:40:29] message here he brings that out in the
[1:40:31] scripture that he uses and
[1:40:34] what I read it was in the book of Job a
[1:40:37] man so he said he's hearing it this way
[1:40:41] is seen it this way a man so he said as

[1:40:51] God was purging him hey man there are
[1:40:56] those thing old God was punishing Joel

[1:40:59] this and Craig job for that amen and he

[1:41:27] devil is there in your mind
[1:41:28] amen brother listen okay is the same
[1:41:31] thing that K that Cain was dealing with
[1:41:32] it was it was the devil influencing his
[1:41:35] thoughts his words his deeds a man but
[1:41:38] look at another influencing enable
[1:41:41] influenced his thoughts his words his
[1:41:43] deeds
[1:41:44] God accepted him but he had to make the
[1:41:48] end of more just think the Bible says he
[1:41:52] had the more excellent sacrifice but
[1:41:55] Cain's was excellent well see how close
[1:42:01] it is it would deceive the very elect in
[1:42:05] this day this our brother has it started
[1:42:07] so it's going to finish
[1:42:09] amen there are two spirits back there in

[1:43:52] of glory praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:43:56] brother Aaron is one thing seen is
[1:44:00] another Amen hear it the way God wants
[1:44:05] you to hear as it was more excellent in
[1:44:08] cable and it was very very very very
[1:44:12] very excellent more excellent any knock
[1:44:16] hey man because he God took him home
[1:44:20] praise the Lord
[1:44:22] what the life that he lived he says he
[1:44:24] walked with God and was not because God
[1:44:28] took you praise the Lord but he
[1:44:33] prophesied after his going there was
[1:44:36] going to come destruction another man
[1:44:40] walked with God aybe Adam and Noah
[1:44:42] rather he walked with God and he heard
[1:44:46] the way God wanted him to hear it and he
[1:44:47] saw it the way God wanted him to see it
[1:44:50] and his life reflected it
[1:44:55] why he was building a boat on dry land
[1:45:01] it's amazing
[1:45:03] will you get this to it Noah well the
[1:45:08] Lord told me to do this the Lord told me
[1:45:10] to do this guy came spoke say Adam I
[1:45:13] know I want you to do this I want you to
[1:45:15] do that because I'm gonna do this and
[1:45:17] brother like I said as I was then sold
[1:45:21] is now and did God just destroy did God
[1:45:27] say just to say no on his family yes and
[1:45:30] yet there were sons of God that were
[1:45:34] destroyed in the flood because right the
[1:45:38] sons of God never heard it the way they
[1:45:41] should have heard it never seen it the
[1:45:42] way they should have seen it ain't man
[1:45:44] no no and they were controlled by their
[1:45:46] flesh and they went out and that's where
[1:45:50] I brought in just recently concerning
[1:45:51] where bla bla God said they took of
[1:45:53] themselves wives and all which they
[1:45:54] chose the prophesied India in the
[1:45:56] original strands scriptures he said it
[1:46:00] said that they took unto themselves
[1:46:01] women he said common-law relationships
[1:46:05] this is st. you gotta take your stand
[1:46:08] against those relationships not against
[1:46:11] a person
[1:46:12] no no but you cannot you know it go
[1:46:18] along with common all relationships
[1:46:21] no no God Goddard judge you for that oh
[1:46:27] yeah the Bible says you know II that
[1:46:30] looking at the woman so on and the lost
[1:46:33] after commits adultery with her in the
[1:46:35] eyes of God so brother you're looking
[1:46:37] after looking at after and going along
[1:46:40] with and encouraging you know common-law
[1:46:42] relationships God's gonna require that
[1:46:45] of you you know no you got seeing him
[1:46:50] it's hearing it the way you should seen
[1:46:52] it the way you should amen and you'll go
[1:46:55] and reflect it the way you should but
[1:46:58] there's too much compromise you talk
[1:47:01] about compromise today and it's just
[1:47:03] because their family or their friends or
[1:47:04] whatever doesn't make no difference I've
[1:47:07] been born again
[1:47:09] I got a different family a million and
[1:47:14] my heart goes out to my new family now
[1:47:18] why because that relationship is eternal
[1:47:22] the other one is just natural as the
[1:47:25] prophet of God said even met about his
[1:47:26] own family he said after his after
[1:47:28] sister after his mother passed away and
[1:47:32] always said he said we're not going to
[1:47:35] see each other now he said like we used
[1:47:36] to he said we all come back home he said
[1:47:39] see mom and he said we see each other
[1:47:41] but now he said we're not we're not
[1:47:43] going to come to see see one another and
[1:47:45] he didn't and there was only one I think
[1:47:49] brother bounce brothers that was a
[1:47:52] believer we refer to his doc Branham now
[1:47:56] and another one he went out to this cult
[1:48:00] he joined that cult and that's where I
[1:48:03] asked where he asked where he was buried
[1:48:05] yeah they went to that to the particular
[1:48:09] Church see so the brother Brown put the
[1:48:12] emphasis on the spiritual family not the
[1:48:14] natural oh yeah
[1:48:17] the but he was caught up with the
[1:48:19] spiritual family and even to the point
[1:48:21] where even sister Rebecca she
[1:48:23] acknowledged that in in in some of her
[1:48:25] writings and she says cuz and maybe even
[1:48:27] brother Billy Paul she's all we were we
[1:48:29] were we were jealous because God was so
[1:48:31] caught up with this one on this one and
[1:48:33] this one but not his natural family
[1:48:38] brother you got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:48:42] caught up with a spiritual family most
[1:48:46] definitely oh you got to do this oh my
[1:48:50] cupboard the devil deceiving people when
[1:48:53] it comes to the natural things of life
[1:48:55] be careful
[1:48:57] beyond your guard amen
[1:49:01] well let's let's see how God ordered it
[1:49:05] in the scriptures God do this God God
[1:49:07] did this God wanted us to do this God
[1:49:09] want us to do that amen brother
[1:49:13] if you're hearing it the way you are
[1:49:14] here you're gonna see it the way you see
[1:49:16] we should see it you're gonna reflect it
[1:49:18] and live it the way you should you're
[1:49:20] going to take your stand a man you're
[1:49:23] going to keep your attitude right you're
[1:49:24] not gonna hold nothing against them but
[1:49:27] you're gonna take your stand says now
[1:49:28] listen if they if they question it you
[1:49:31] tell them and say well you should get
[1:49:33] married
[1:49:35] tell you should get back don't do this
[1:49:38] don't do that's not right yeah cuz we
[1:49:42] had that problem
[1:49:44] now and we took our stain and the
[1:49:47] believers we took our stand against that
[1:49:50] and the believers took their stand again
[1:49:52] against us oh let's say somebody said oh
[1:49:59] brother
[1:50:00] you know we don't agree with what you're
[1:50:02] what you're doing what you did
[1:50:04] I swear that makes no difference to me I
[1:50:06] says long as God agrees amen
[1:50:09] and knowing that sometimes calls waiting
[1:50:11] for you to take your stand and then got
[1:50:13] a movie in in that son in that daughter
[1:50:17] in that in that brother in that sister
[1:50:19] whoever is some family member you got to
[1:50:21] move in that person but he's waiting for
[1:50:22] you take your stand and just think your
[1:50:26] compromise might hinder the moving of
[1:50:28] the Spirit of God in their lives amen
[1:50:32] brother
[1:50:34] that's the truth god help us we're born
[1:50:38] again amen by the grace of God so
[1:50:44] hearing is one thing but scene is
[1:50:46] another brother I hear the message I see
[1:50:51] the message and if I hear the way I
[1:50:53] should see the way that I said then it's
[1:50:55] going to reflect itself in these kind of
[1:50:57] God's gonna make it flesh in me and in
[1:50:59] you whoa probably God said your life
[1:51:06] will testify in the judgment against
[1:51:10] those that didn't believe it's your life
[1:51:13] oh they didn't witness to me and the
[1:51:16] probably God did say he or showed under
[1:51:18] on the sky there this person and a
[1:51:22] believer that came by and reflected the
[1:51:25] life of Christ to them and they ignored
[1:51:29] it
[1:51:30] now sometimes you don't have to say
[1:51:32] anything is what you live it's not what
[1:51:36] you say it's what you do so they
[1:51:40] recognize you as having a compromising
[1:51:42] spirit or a Christian spirit that takes
[1:51:46] your stand for the truth but you're
[1:51:49] stupid you've got a right attitude oh
[1:51:50] yeah we've taken our stand even among
[1:51:54] other family members are there and then
[1:51:56] in such situations change they respected
[1:51:59] us they never held anything against us
[1:52:01] they knew it was our faith and they
[1:52:05] respected us I said well Lord thank you
[1:52:11] you're dealing with them Thank You
[1:52:14] Lauren so if I compromise maybe the Lord
[1:52:16] would not have the opportunity to deal
[1:52:17] with them that's the truth so brother
[1:52:21] that's here at the way that God wants us
[1:52:23] to hear and then see it the way God
[1:52:25] wants us to see it amen and it'll
[1:52:30] reflect in us oh yes there's a sacrifice
[1:52:35] there's persecution yeah
[1:52:40] the Bible says when it comes to the
[1:52:42] Christian life my minister on that
[1:52:45] sometime what what does God say it's
[1:52:47] going to Christian life it's going to be
[1:52:50] persecutions they says you're going to
[1:52:54] endure this because it's part of the
[1:52:56] Christian life you're going to endure a
[1:53:00] rejection you can be put down criticized
[1:53:05] yeah and all but I I don't want to
[1:53:09] endure that so what they'll do what they
[1:53:10] compromise on the word do I still think
[1:53:13] they're Christians were compromising on
[1:53:15] the word yeah no no take you're staying
[1:53:21] rather
[1:53:26] and they say it again hearing is one
[1:53:28] thing scene is another especially in
[1:53:31] this age we're in the false anointing is
[1:53:33] so close to the true noting that it
[1:53:36] would deceive the very elect if possible
[1:53:39] it is absolutely necessary to make your
[1:53:43] calling and your election sure and to
[1:53:46] make sure you hear and see the message
[1:53:48] the way God wants you to hear it and the
[1:53:50] way God want you to see it a man turn
[1:53:54] with me to 2nd Peter chapter 1 2nd Peter
[1:54:07] chapter 1 and verse 1 Lord that we're
[1:54:18] going to read the way we should read
[1:54:21] we're going to hear it the way we should
[1:54:23] hear it and see it the way we should see
[1:54:24] it here in the Bible amen
[1:54:27] that God apply it to your life amen and
[1:54:32] he said in verse 1 Simon Peter a servant
[1:54:35] and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them
[1:54:37] that have obtained like precious faith
[1:54:40] with us through the righteousness of God
[1:54:44] and our Savior Jesus Christ amen
[1:54:48] grace is the righteousness of God and it
[1:54:52] says Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[1:54:55] you through the knowledge of God and of
[1:55:00] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[1:55:06] power has given unto us all things and
[1:55:11] it's all things that pertain unto life
[1:55:14] and godliness through the knowledge of
[1:55:19] him that has called us to glory and
[1:55:21] virtue Curitiba thumbed Anita not called
[1:55:27] just to believe in the mechanics of the
[1:55:30] word but the dynamics Amen
[1:55:33] we have been called unto glory and
[1:55:36] virtue
[1:55:40] it's amazing anything oh it's like I
[1:55:45] said when I was at that altar praying
[1:55:46] and that person next to me praised it
[1:55:49] all Lord thank you for delivering us out
[1:55:51] of denominations now we don't have to be
[1:55:54] subject to any man well they weren't
[1:55:59] right they never heard the way they
[1:56:01] should never seen it the way they should
[1:56:03] because God was gonna bring him out of
[1:56:05] the nomination they come subject to 5
[1:56:06] min 5 ministries and you man oh yeah the
[1:56:11] minister God has set them in the church
[1:56:13] for the perfecting of the saints amen
[1:56:18] don't think well I don't have to do this
[1:56:20] I don't have to thank God knows what you
[1:56:21] need God God does it this way
[1:56:24] amen brother we got to hear it the way
[1:56:27] God wants us to or see it the way that
[1:56:29] God wants us to say it a man revealing
[1:56:32] the will of God and the plan of God the
[1:56:34] pattern of God this is why the worlds in
[1:56:37] the message said because they don't
[1:56:39] recognize God's plan it doesn't
[1:56:41] recognize God's purpose and it doesn't
[1:56:44] recognize God's pattern that's the truth
[1:56:47] that's why there's such a confusion of
[1:56:50] their because they don't see that that
[1:56:52] there is a plan here and there's a
[1:56:54] pattern here and there there's a purpose
[1:56:55] no they just think this is God did this
[1:56:58] and the devil to this God did this devil
[1:57:00] to that and we got to do this no let's
[1:57:03] get into the pattern let's get into the
[1:57:06] pan plan and it's getting to the purpose

[2:01:45] oh they're professing to be Christians
[2:01:49] they're professing to be this and
[2:01:50] persistent that but they're instead of

[2:02:22] nature you're reflecting the attitude
[2:02:25] you're reflecting the spirit you're
[2:02:26] reflecting look at King what he was
[2:02:29] reflecting and look unable what he
[2:02:30] reflected and he laid down his life for

[2:02:41] corruption that is in the world through
[2:02:44] lust oh my brother Todd Buddhist
[2:02:47] partaking of the divine nature the life

[2:03:00] have no mistakes oh yes but you'll be
[2:03:02] convicted
[2:03:03] there's many not convicted but if you're
[2:03:07] a seed of God brother you're going
[2:03:09] you're going to recognize your mistakes
[2:03:11] you're going to be convicted of your
[2:03:12] mistakes convicted of this convicted of
[2:03:14] that oh yeah yeah and you know what
[2:03:17] conviction does if your seed of God it
[2:03:19] probably brings repentance forgive me
[2:03:22] Lord amen you point you to Calvary I've
[2:03:28] give you the promises I've given you the
[2:03:31] power a man I give you the virtue the
[2:03:37] virtue of Christ who someone look at
[2:03:42] this one say that was oh that's a
[2:03:44] perfect son and son or daughter there Oh
[2:03:46] what they're not perfect oh yes there
[2:03:49] you look at them through the eyes of God
[2:03:52] see them as God sees them oh yeah so I
[2:03:57] said don't don't condemn this one
[2:03:59] condemn that one brother BAM said the
[2:04:01] angel the angel told brother round don't
[2:04:03] condemn this one that one
[2:04:04] condemn the sin but don't condemn the
[2:04:06] person yeah it's just like I sometimes
[2:04:11] that brother takes grace takes grace to
[2:04:15] do that
[2:04:16] because even when I was out there while
[2:04:20] ago and I saw this woman door and she
[2:04:28] was I guess maybe 70s or close to 70
[2:04:32] years old for short-haul woman and here
[2:04:36] she is in a pair of shorts tight shorts
[2:04:41] and tight sweater and you look at her
[2:04:48] legs well they were agent oh yes they
[2:04:56] were turning purple you know the they
[2:05:00] were they had these spots on them and
[2:05:01] these spots on them I said Lord I said
[2:05:04] help me to keep my attitude right and my
[2:05:07] spirit right I said I said because that
[2:05:12] that is the insanity for for a woman
[2:05:17] that old who want to expose her body
[2:05:19] like that you know and you could see the
[2:05:23] agent part of the of the of the legs
[2:05:26] getting big and fat and so I'm pushing
[2:05:29] out here and pushing out there and I was
[2:05:30] oh my lord I said lord I spiced an order
[2:05:33] to convict her I said I don't I don't
[2:05:36] know but I said she needs conviction so
[2:05:39] I said so she's gonna she's gonna dress
[2:05:41] right you know I said that's not normal
[2:05:44] for a person or her age because if she
[2:05:47] was a just a young woman and she had a
[2:05:49] nice body and all that then she'd be
[2:05:52] there too old to show off her body but I
[2:05:54] said for a woman that old I said that
[2:05:57] don't make sense and the slacks were so
[2:05:59] tight and not only that of course even
[2:06:01] the young now today of course when it
[2:06:03] comes to the girls nothing one time they
[2:06:06] wore slacks but it wasn't taped it was
[2:06:11] just like the bad pants that a man would
[2:06:13] wear or something but there wasn't tight
[2:06:16] but now it's tight everything is so
[2:06:19] tight yeah perfect gonna cuff too tight
[2:06:23] that they were perverted
[2:06:25] yeah that's the enemy brother that's
[2:06:27] insane insanity one time they would
[2:06:29] never wear it like that they wear slacks
[2:06:31] will do would were tight like that but
[2:06:34] now it's gone and when I saw that dead
[2:06:35] lady on I pray God convict her lashes
[2:06:39] that don't make sense I said for your
[2:06:41] your grandmother or your
[2:06:42] great-grandmother to be out there like
[2:06:44] that you know and there's just very few
[2:06:48] mothers that would even go out like it
[2:06:50] you know but they're not now but one
[2:06:52] time it was a man because again it was
[2:06:56] rare that I even seen my mother in
[2:06:58] slacks I once or twice you know even
[2:07:04] went berry picking she never wore slacks
[2:07:06] eyes it isn't amazing you know today
[2:07:11] it's it's everywhere but you notice that
[2:07:14] it's mostly women that's going to the
[2:07:18] extremes when it comes to the clothing
[2:07:22] they wear not the men yeah so I pray the
[2:07:25] grace of God to that woman and I pray
[2:07:27] God convict her oh my god they just
[2:07:29] didn't like they just didn't look good
[2:07:32] you know because like I said to my
[2:07:35] father
[2:07:35] I wrote my father if my father saw that
[2:07:38] he was what would he say he would say
[2:07:41] well she belongs into Waterford yeah and
[2:07:45] and he's right well the whole world he
[2:07:48] belongs in the Waterford most of the
[2:07:51] world ain't not all of them but most of
[2:07:52] them
[2:07:53] well we pray grace of God to them Lord
[2:07:55] it was grace to us His grace to them
[2:07:58] amen
[2:07:59] good they're good there goes auspi for
[2:08:02] the grace of God amen praise the name of
[2:08:06] the Lord so brother
[2:08:08] we need his virtue amen and he said
[2:08:14] besides this verse fine giving all
[2:08:16] diligence add to your faith virtue now
[2:08:20] watch these things we'll be closing
[2:08:21] shortly like I just started it says now
[2:08:27] you should add to your faith virtue a
[2:08:30] man and a virtue knowledge but it's got
[2:08:36] to be the correct and vital knowledge of

[2:11:27] were they were fighting the devil in
[2:11:29] every age they were fighting the devil
[2:11:31] andhe finally in the last age looking

[2:12:53] grace of God they make you that ye shall
[2:12:56] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[2:12:59] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ not

[2:16:18] verse 1 then job answered the Lord and
[2:16:23] said I know that thou canst do
[2:16:27] everything and that no thought can be
[2:16:31] with olan from thee who is he that I did
[2:16:37] counsel without knowledge therefore
[2:16:40] every other that I understood not and
[2:16:42] things too wonderful for me which I knew
[2:16:46] not we're guilty of that we got to get
[2:16:55] in the spirit
[2:16:56] get in the Holy Spirit amen so we're
[2:17:01] going to stalk let's talk in the spirit
[2:17:04] not intellectually spiritually he said
[2:17:10] here I beseech thee and I will speak I
[2:17:13] will demand of thee and declare thou
[2:17:15] unto me notice I have heard of thee by
[2:17:21] the hearing of the ear not ears warning
[2:17:25] here I have heard of thee by the hearing
[2:17:30] of the year but now mine eye not mine
[2:17:34] eyes mine I see at thee amen
[2:17:41] just the text the Prophet brings out so
[2:17:47] brother
[2:17:48] I have heard not by these years but hear
[2:17:52] of the soul one ear now I see not with
[2:17:57] these eyes or the understanding of the
[2:18:00] mind but the revelation in the heart
[2:18:04] amen
[2:18:07] so he said
[2:18:09] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[2:18:11] the year but now mine I see thee praise
[2:18:16] the Lord it is singular not plural
[2:18:19] wherefore I bore myself and repent in
[2:18:24] dust and ashes amen
[2:18:32] reading the text in 1965 the Prophet
[2:18:37] said let's take a little of job's life
[2:18:43] he said job was a prophet he was a man
[2:18:47] that lived back before the word the
[2:18:49] Bible was written and it's been taught
[2:18:53] that Joel was one of the oldest books of
[2:18:56] the Bible because it was written before
[2:18:59] Genesis was written and he said job this
[2:19:05] great warrior and prophet no doubt that
[2:19:11] he had been brought up and had served
[2:19:13] the Lord all of his life and had lived
[2:19:17] such a gallant life to the people all
[2:19:19] had respects for him just think that
[2:19:24] somebody before Genesis had this
[2:19:26] revelation of God yeah before Abraham
[2:19:33] before Moses before Noah
[2:19:37] they had this revelation of God Joe
[2:19:44] said buddy come to a place where he
[2:19:47] calls it here being tempted of the Lord
[2:19:49] but I'd like to use the word being
[2:19:52] tested by the Lord and truly every Sun
[2:19:56] that cometh to God must first be tested
[2:19:59] tried and child trained and then he said
[2:20:05] if the testing gets hard and we think
[2:20:09] it's too heard and won't listen
[2:20:11] take heed he said we become as
[2:20:14] illegitimate child not a child of God
[2:20:19] because there is nothing can move a real
[2:20:22] born-again child of God away from his
[2:20:24] parent he says see he's part of him you
[2:20:33] heard it ministered recently concerning
[2:20:36] all babies go to heaven no they don't
[2:20:42] good remember when they sent the soul
[2:20:45] out to destroy the Amalekites someone
[2:20:48] said to brother Ram you mean this remedy
[2:20:50] gonna destroy the babies yes he said
[2:20:53] they did they killed the babies why he
[2:20:57] said because they were growing
[2:20:58] Amalekites and it was in their heart
[2:21:01] against Israel he's again the part of
[2:21:06] God said he said serpent seed can give
[2:21:10] serpent seed parents can give birth to a
[2:21:13] seed of God and he said Christian
[2:21:16] parents seed of God parents can give
[2:21:20] birth to a serpent seed and that's true
[2:21:23] as a couple that we met and they told us
[2:21:27] about their family they're not serving
[2:21:29] the Lord that mom and daddys but there's
[2:21:32] maybe a certain son or a certain
[2:21:34] daughter's not and not interested in
[2:21:36] them why his servants eat so he said God
[2:21:41] knows the heart we looked and we see a
[2:21:43] baby God looks and sees he's a
[2:21:47] full-grown child
[2:21:50] brother Brennan went beyond the curtain
[2:21:52] of time after he had lost his wife and
[2:21:56] his daughter amen and he saw Sarah and
[2:22:04] she said he said who are you
[2:22:07] she's you don't know me she said I'm
[2:22:09] Sarah Kevin he buried her she was just a
[2:22:12] baby
[2:22:14] just a baby he witnessed her death and
[2:22:17] he buried her with sister Branham he's
[2:22:21] first wife and so on and she said oh I'm
[2:22:24] Sarah she says you know there's no
[2:22:26] babies here she said and he knew that
[2:22:30] and like I said there was a magazine
[2:22:32] from an evangelist that sister Byrne
[2:22:34] said their magazine and I don't know
[2:22:38] where it is now but that evangelist was
[2:22:41] testifying about beyond the curtain of
[2:22:43] time and they were certain person was
[2:22:46] saying or beyond the curtain of time the
[2:22:47] children are raised you know and they go
[2:22:50] from this to this to this to this and he
[2:22:53] said I don't agree with that he said
[2:22:54] I'll be honest he said I believe boys
[2:22:57] and Branham more than I believe what she
[2:22:58] was saying
[2:22:59] he said William Betty and he give the
[2:23:01] testimony of Willie Browns experience
[2:23:03] beyond the curtain of time he said I
[2:23:05] believe that now he wasn't believing in
[2:23:08] the message but he respected brother
[2:23:10] Brown yeah and brother Brown when he got
[2:23:13] beyond the curtain of time there were
[2:23:14] Sarah hey man we will be on the curtain
[2:23:18] of time we're surprised that Jenna and
[2:23:21] sisters and sister Justine
[2:23:23] my hard to believe that they're that
[2:23:27] they're this big now yeah well beyond
[2:23:30] the curtain of time there might be a
[2:23:31] little bit bigger might be a little bit
[2:23:34] taller and the others were we do they're
[2:23:36] full grown but you're gonna be around 20
[2:23:39] years old yeah by the grace of God a man
[2:23:44] that if you were if you were to accept
[2:23:47] from here beyond the curtain of time you
[2:23:49] see yours you see yourself you know as
[2:23:52] adults but I only run 20 years old if
[2:23:58] brother Bob spent beyond the curtain of
[2:23:59] time I guess he'd have his hair back
[2:24:03] and it wouldn't be white or gray amen
[2:24:07] no no yeah and he wouldn't have no
[2:24:08] wrinkles so so well amar Singh so we'd
[2:24:13] be all all freeze the Lord would be all
[2:24:15] young he meant for we'll step from time
[2:24:19] to Eternity by the grace of God
[2:24:21] wonderful and explaining to our brother
[2:24:25] romkey concerning death we're talking
[2:24:29] about that and so on I said well I said
[2:24:34] when you when you get over there I see
[2:24:36] you're going to go into another body
[2:24:38] the oppening body I said the Bible
[2:24:39] refers to and I should you as you can
[2:24:42] see one another talk to one another but
[2:24:44] you can't touch one another
[2:24:46] you can't touch one another I said but I
[2:24:49] said but I said you're you can really
[2:24:53] you really talk and I said you can do
[2:24:55] you want you can't eat unless you're not
[2:24:58] in a glorified body yet you're in a
[2:24:59] theophany body the Bible refers to that
[2:25:02] and I give examples in the scripture and
[2:25:04] so on and let him know amen
[2:25:07] so even her brother Ravi and sister Rafi
[2:25:11] coming back young you know because they
[2:25:14] because the certain church feels that
[2:25:16] when you die you're dead you don't know
[2:25:21] nothing you're not gone anywhere
[2:25:23] you're just aired an Indian degree no no
[2:25:27] no no no that's not it
[2:25:30] so I've brought up many a scripture and
[2:25:32] so on so I said you go from can go up
[2:25:35] from time to eternity actually if this
[2:25:37] body be destroyed we have one already
[2:25:39] waiting eternal in the heavens
[2:25:40] amen so as that's the scripture that's
[2:25:43] thus saith the Lord amen
[2:25:46] but again this does a lot of churches
[2:25:48] believe that you're all the data sore
[2:25:50] out during the cemetery's know if
[2:25:53] they're righteous they're not they're in
[2:25:54] the cemetery thank God that he gave us a
[2:25:58] problem I we believe sister coffee is
[2:26:00] not there yeah as when we were at sister
[2:26:04] coffees wake and brother guy was there
[2:26:06] and
[2:26:08] he looked he said mother he said that's
[2:26:11] not sister copy he says she's not there
[2:26:15] in the box no he says she's in glory and
[2:26:21] he says she's got it she's got a young
[2:26:23] body now he says thank the Lord he said
[2:26:26] she's with the Prophet now she says
[2:26:29] she's with those of this dissertation
[2:26:31] now or the bride aids amen
[2:26:34] she's fellowshiping with them praise the
[2:26:36] name of the Lord
[2:26:37] trusting and believing that that's where
[2:26:40] sister done pretties there fellow should
[2:26:43] be with it with the Saints a man from
[2:26:46] this age they're waiting on you and me
[2:26:49] amen
[2:26:50] because when we get ready to go donors
[2:26:53] step into glorified bodies amen and
[2:26:57] we'll go in 35 bodies thank God please I
[2:27:01] pray grace that God makes these things
[2:27:03] more real to us than the natural things
[2:27:06] of life because the be honest the world
[2:27:09] were living in is gone people people
[2:27:13] know that the world's come to an end
[2:27:14] they do well it's like that scientists
[2:27:17] that just died did a while ago I don't
[2:27:19] know when maybe a year ago and he said
[2:27:21] he told what he's told all the other
[2:27:23] scientists he said get Mars ready to
[2:27:25] live on he said because the earth is
[2:27:26] coming to an end
[2:27:28] he says he's vanishing away he knew that
[2:27:33] and he felt that and there's there's
[2:27:35] many other scientists believe the same
[2:27:36] thing has come to an end
[2:27:38] and there's a tremendous climate change
[2:27:40] going on we know that you know well the
[2:27:44] prophet of God said nature will take a
[2:27:46] tumble and it and it is taking a tumble
[2:27:50] but I pray grace we're not going to take
[2:27:53] it for granted
[2:27:53] I pray grace we're going to take it
[2:27:55] serious and look pop a mint for our
[2:27:59] change
[2:28:03] he says there's nothing more real than a
[2:28:06] born-again child of God away from his
[2:28:08] parent see he's part of him you can no
[2:28:11] more deny it you deny yourself you've
[2:28:16] had the experience you've been trained
[2:28:17] and tested and now he said this man he
[2:28:21] said been a prophet he had access he
[2:28:23] said to God's grace thank God that's
[2:28:27] true Christ we have access to grace but
[2:28:31] it's a joke
[2:28:31] didn't have a Bible to read and he said
[2:28:36] but he had access to God by revelation
[2:28:38] and by vision why he said even everybody
[2:28:42] respected him even to his wisdom had
[2:28:45] become so great and his inspiration from
[2:28:48] God had vindicated him to be God's
[2:28:50] servant so plainly until people come
[2:28:53] from everywhere to hear him and then he
[2:28:56] says Satan began to accuse that man and
[2:28:58] that's the way he does every inspired
[2:29:01] servant of God Satan is always there to
[2:29:04] accuse him of everything that he does
[2:29:06] that's not right and now we find out his
[2:29:09] life and trials amen
[2:29:11] and is great faith and even Jesus when
[2:29:15] he came on the earth he referred to the
[2:29:17] patience of Job and he said have you not
[2:29:21] rid of the patience of Job and faith
[2:29:23] waits with patience for the promised
[2:29:26] word to be fulfilled amen
[2:29:28] and were waiting with patience for the
[2:29:31] fulfillment of the resurrection and
[2:29:33] rapture and notices it air that job
[2:29:36] after he went through his trials he had
[2:29:39] a lovely family and they were taken from
[2:29:41] him he had a good elf and it was taken
[2:29:44] from him everything that he owned in his
[2:29:46] life was taken and he had a ash heap
[2:29:50] with a piece of crock scraping his boils
[2:29:53] and even to his own wife spoke against
[2:29:56] him why not curse God and die and he
[2:30:00] said those because like a foolish woman
[2:30:02] and he said the Lord gave and the Lord
[2:30:06] takes away blessed be the name of the
[2:30:09] Lord amen now he says Satan had come up
[2:30:13] before God and he could come before God
[2:30:16] and accuse the Cris
[2:30:17] accused believers all the time he said I
[2:30:21] want you to notice that the confidence
[2:30:24] that God had in a believer God said not
[2:30:29] said to Satan he says you can't do it
[2:30:33] job is a just man job is just a fight he
[2:30:38] is a good man and there's not one like
[2:30:40] him in the whole earth all what a man
[2:30:43] that God Himself would say to his enemy
[2:30:46] my servant is so perfect there's not
[2:30:49] another man on earth like him oh if we
[2:30:52] could only be that kind of a man that
[2:30:55] God could bestow that confidence upon us
[2:30:58] that know that we're not twisted from
[2:31:02] his word or is being anyway stay exactly
[2:31:06] and he said he can put his trust in us
[2:31:12] amen he could trust job oh yeah he
[2:31:17] wasn't correcting job he was purging him
[2:31:23] to purge out cleanse him perfect
[2:31:27] bring him to a more greater and greater
[2:31:28] perfection but job still held right on
[2:31:32] there was no turning back no matter what
[2:31:36] happens we don't turn back no matter
[2:31:40] what happens we're not going to accuse
[2:31:42] God no no God you shouldn't have done
[2:31:46] this you shouldn't have done that God
[2:31:48] does what he you know feels is necessary
[2:31:50] for you
[2:31:51] for me in your life in our lives why
[2:31:55] this Lord why that what is the reason
[2:31:57] for it amen job was respected people
[2:32:06] come from everywhere to get jobs counsel
[2:32:09] and advice grace to his brother
[2:32:17] he said you see when a man or a person
[2:32:20] has once really come into contact with
[2:32:22] God with that genuine revealed faith
[2:32:25] that God is there is nothing no time
[2:32:27] nowhere can ever separate that man from
[2:32:30] is God no he says Satan thought he could
[2:32:38] twist him around a little bit
[2:32:40] cuff him up make him do this but you see
[2:32:43] Joel with his perfect revelation of God
[2:32:45] and who God was and how God loved him
[2:32:48] and he waited no matter what the
[2:32:51] circumstances was he waited for his
[2:32:53] faith to be confirmed because he had a
[2:32:56] grip on God a revelation amen and when
[2:33:01] you can get that type of revelation that
[2:33:03] you are justified when you are exactly
[2:33:05] justified in asking the thing that
[2:33:08] you're asking and believe that he's a
[2:33:10] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[2:33:12] Him there's nothing ever separate you
[2:33:15] from that faith that anchored to you
[2:33:18] first it has to be revealed to you I
[2:33:21] have heard Lord job said now I see a man
[2:33:26] I have heard by the airing of my ear but
[2:33:30] now mine I not mine eyes mine I see at
[2:33:34] thee job was in contact with God job was
[2:33:42] in fellowship with God he didn't know
[2:33:44] why the Lord permitted this and why the
[2:33:46] Lord permitted that but he he went along
[2:33:50] with God and brother it's a lesson to us
[2:33:54] to go along with God let's not tell god
[2:33:58] what to do let God tell us what to do
[2:34:02] amen by the grace of God he said see
[2:34:11] I'll finish with this quote here we
[2:34:17] don't use the gift of God for commercial
[2:34:19] no no no he could tell me where it was
[2:34:23] at but I don't have any need of it I
[2:34:25] wouldn't even have faith enough to ask
[2:34:27] him if I had a need of
[2:34:29] I believe if I'd asked him he tell me
[2:34:32] but first see your motives and
[2:34:34] objectives as to be right you have to
[2:34:38] have reasons for this and God don't go
[2:34:40] and give you those things just because
[2:34:42] you ask you ask in faith unless there's
[2:34:45] a real objective to be in the will of
[2:34:48] God and if you want to be well what do
[2:34:51] you want to be well for if you want to
[2:34:54] be healed what's the reason you want to
[2:34:56] be healed
[2:34:58] what are you telling God what do you
[2:35:01] want to do with your life when you get
[2:35:03] ield you've got to have a motive a right
[2:35:06] motive and a right objective and they
[2:35:08] have to be right according to the will
[2:35:10] of God and theirs when the faith is
[2:35:12] revealed to you and God by his Sovereign
[2:35:15] Grace places that faith India amen
[2:35:22] remember he said no selfish work will
[2:35:27] work it won't work your motives and
[2:35:30] objectives are to be exactly perfectly
[2:35:33] right then you have faith there if our
[2:35:36] hearts condemn us not then have we
[2:35:39] confidence toward God and we've got to
[2:35:43] have confidence I want this to to the
[2:35:46] honor and the glory of God
[2:35:48] then faith a channel to move into if it
[2:35:52] doesn't then you've got mental
[2:35:53] intellectual faith and not genuine faith
[2:35:55] from God the intellectual faith will get
[2:35:58] you nowhere
[2:35:59] might get you emotional but it won't get
[2:36:02] you the healing that you're looking for
[2:36:04] amen brother
[2:36:06] we got to have a right attitude right
[2:36:07] spirit we got to hear it here the right
[2:36:10] and we got to see it right we got to
[2:36:13] hear it in our souls see it in our souls
[2:36:16] amen by the grace of Almighty God a man
[2:36:19] and heard our motive and objective is
[2:36:22] for the glory of God amen I have heard
[2:36:26] but now I see and it's for the glory of
[2:36:30] God that I do what I do say what I say
[2:36:35] amen go where I go sons and daughters of
[2:36:38] God are led by the Spirit of God
[2:36:41] a man why sure that we're going to see
[2:36:44] as God wants us to see and hear it as
[2:36:47] God wants us to hear it amen
[2:36:50] and don't let the devil interfere with
[2:36:52] your your hearing and your Z don't let
[2:36:56] the devil put his ideas and his thoughts
[2:36:58] in there amen
[2:36:59] no no that God be in control by the
[2:37:03] grace of God amen
[2:37:05] god bless you list and praise the Lord
[2:37:21] this thing hold the fort oh my comrades

[2:38:02] to hear what God wants us to hear and
[2:38:04] see what God wants us to see amen not
[2:38:08] what man wants us to see what God wants
[2:38:10] to see amen
[2:38:11] and it's got to be according to the
[2:38:13] scriptures but you know it's gonna be
[2:38:16] God in simplicity because people are
[2:38:19] making it bigger than what it is
[2:38:23] but leave it the way that is as I said
[2:38:26] resurrection is resurrection
[2:38:30] we know what a resurrection is Jesus was
[2:38:33] the example of it so we know what
[2:38:35] resurrection is don't try to make it any
[2:38:37] bigger than what it is we know what
[2:38:39] rapture is so don't make it any bigger
[2:38:41] than what it is just just believe it and
