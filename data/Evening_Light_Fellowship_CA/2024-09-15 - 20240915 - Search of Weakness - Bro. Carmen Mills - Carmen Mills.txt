you know everyone that's gathered out this morning to this service and what their needs are and Lord we've come here we just want to be yielded to you that you might speak through through US Lord in some way to help in ourselves we can do nothing Lord we have no ability no no great thing to offer but Lord you have everything to offer us Lord we pray that you would minister to our hearts today Lord touch those that might be afflicted if there be any Among Us that way Lord whatever the needs may be may you minister to us we pray as we commit this part of the service to you for your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen man it's good to be here with you once again certainly enjoyed our time together last time and and and we just trust the Lord will bless us again this morning we want to turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 take a little different maybe a little different thought this morning certainly not un shouldn't be unfamiliar but I I trust that will will allow us to to get it out the way that it has come to us Hebrews 11 I want to begin to read from verse 32 very familiar passage of scripture and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of Jeff David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned and they were saw aund were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skin and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith rece receive not the promise God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect may be seated these are this is a you know some of the Heroes of Faith we read about in Hebrews 11 and when we when we look at these characters and think about what they experienced and what they went through it's when we look at our own lives and we look at the troubles that we face and sometimes how successful we have or maybe how we have failed and we try to compare ourselves with these with these characters of scripture sometimes it's hard to do that it's hard to imagine that our testimony would would would come anywhere near the testimony of these and yet it says here the very last verse we read that they without us that they without us wouldn't be perfect but yet when we look at ourselves it's very hard for us to see ourselves and to compare ourselves sometimes with these ones that accomplish such great things but we don't read you know about their life at home and the things that they go through some of them we we get some insight but some of these we don't really we don't see it and so we think that maybe they were just on the top of the world all the time they were conquering every day but but they were just human like us too and they went through things and they they had their ups and their downs they had their good days and their and their bad days and it wasn't always easy and we see that not every not every victory was miraculous we we read in the first part about the great things that took place you know Daniel and the lion stand the three Hebrew children we know all those great Miracles but then we see the other side of people whose Faith was tested in a different way and their faith you know ended up being that they had to give their life they had to be tortured and their testimony is just as powerful as the one with the victory I think about brother Daryl Ward he's a good friend of mine and you know he's got that great testimony of his daughter being healed and it's a miraculous thing but I know another Minister friend that had a a son who was killed in an accident and didn't have that testimony but but his testimony is different that in the in spite of that trial he stands with great faith and still to this day loves the Lord and is a great inspiration and so they both have amazing amazing testimony very different outcome in terms of what what it was like you know in this life and so we're all called to go through things we all have a different walk and we wonder why sometimes that we're called to go a certain way but God has a purpose my thought this morning is it might seem counterintuitive because we we read so much about what God can do with us and and all of that's true and the power of God but but I want to take a thought this morning and it I would title it in search of weakness search of weakness that's again it might seem like an odd thing but I trust as we get along we're not suggesting you know that God is designed you know for us to just go through life powerless but I want to show you we we when if you read that scripture if you noticed in the middle of of that passage we just read it said out of weakness were made strong these ones that succeeded and conquered and did all of these things they did it with weakness they were weak it's not it's and that's where we have to come to I want to start my message off with a quote from Humble thyself brother brandom said you know people want power and they don't really know what power is he said the Way Up Is Down always the Way Up Is Down always well that says a lot to me that says that if we aspire to to have the power of God manifested and we know brother brandom taught us that we are God's hands and we are God's mouthpiece we are his eyes and ears and so we we think about that way but sometimes we think that we have to build ourselves to some condition where God can work with us but brother Bram said the way I'm starting this I have more that brother Bram says here but he said the way up is down always always so it's never about building ourselves up it's always about being humble he said if you want Power see how humble that you can get and I can tell you just even in my own little Ministry that the times that God has accomplished the most with me is when I have felt the most insufficient when you sometimes get to where you feel like oh the Lord's really given me something and you if you ever get caught in that and once in a while you I can get caught in that and and then you find that it just doesn't have the same effect but when you can go and be humble about it and feel like I don't know how this is going to go if it's going to work and then you see God step in and do something pretty miraculous it's all about being humble brother brand said if you want Power see how humble you can get get away from your worldly thinking humble yourself before God and then he said you've got more power then he said the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise CU we hear those and I I don't have anything against that I really appreciate those Ministries too but there's sometimes that's all it is my father used to say you know when you you pray for someone sometimes people get really excited and that's good if that helps stir their faith but the devil doesn't really care how loud you holler he's not afraid of you he's afraid of the god that you serve otherwise you end up like the sons of ska you challenge the enemy and you find you don't have the goods to back it up then you're not going to conquer but if we can be humble and just recognize it's God in us brother brandham said you do you do better than the the the one that runs all over the building makes a lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ and humble yourself before him he said that's real power you know it's not about our ability or some super human faith brother Brown taught it and Jesus taught it too how that it is just simple if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you could say to this mountain be moved so it's not about that that aspect of it God can do a lot with just a little brother bradam says and and a number of the quotes that I'll I'll mention this morning comes from a message brother brandham preached called perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said try to make our weaknesses an excuse and you know this is nothing I'm saying today should be new to us but sometimes we can get caught in different trains of thought and we just kind of ignore some of these other things he said we try to make our weaknesses excuses we want to tell how big we are and how great we are and he said you know he said I believe that's why God gave me this text is to get that out of our minds because a lot of people when God does start blessing them they start to to rely more on on that and somehow they think like the scripture says you know that as if that was something that that they were putting into it when it was God all the time and they're starting to lean on their own ability he said the thing it's the little things we do brother randam said we come to church the reason we come to church is to find out where our faults are it doesn't mean that we want to stay in a weakened condition and of course we're all we're all born in sin to start with with failures and flaws that go with us and until we're converted but but understand this that when you're converted you know I I just read a quote I think it was just last week when you're converted you walk up here to the altar if you're a sinner today and you walked up here and you give your life to the Lord and let's say you got a maybe a suit on and you're you're dressed a certain way and you got a certain eye color and hair color and all of that you know when you walk up the door after God has saved you you don't look any different brother bam said your friends will meet you in the street and say you don't look any different than you did before it's because that's not where the change takes place change takes place on the inside now if you're if you come in and you're a man and you're dressed like a hippie and sloppy and all of that there's going to be a a change that people will see on the outside but it's a change that you that you do you go get cleaned up you go get your haircut and things like that you do that but the change that God does happens on the inside and then when we're changed you know we're still stuck with this flesh which is our biggest enemy me and it still has Hang-Ups and flaws and weaknesses in it that carry through the most that we are able to do with this flesh is to put it under subjection but it's it's still corruptible there's nothing Eternal about these this flesh it's corruptible it's going to Decay one day it's going to die but we have a body the Bible says waiting us it's Incorruptible but we still have to deal with this flesh and that and and those weaknesses that are there God allows them to be there for very vious reasons and and and and we we don't like them we wish they weren't there but but I believe in many ways God allows that to keep us humble to keep us to a place where we realize that we need that we need him so we come to church brother bradam said to find out where our faults are now when it comes to sin and things like that we certainly we don't want to tolerate that we want to overcome that we want God to to change that but there are things in our lives that we just continually have to deal with but he said we come to find out about our faults and things that we might better ourselves by that's why we come to church he said if we come for any other reason he said we're not going to get much out of coming to church he said we must come to find our weak find our bad places see how little we are to put our trust in somebody that's strong because there's always going to be things I don't care how far along you come in serving the lord there's always going to be things you're fighting with and you're dealing with in your life your personal life but also just around you there are things that are going to happen that you have to deal with decisions you have to make it's constantly there and that's where we have to rely on God he said the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses are the things that God uses to tackle the job with remember Moses you know he complained he couldn't speak well and different ones had different reasons in the Bible why they didn't think they could do things and sometimes we feel the same way you know why would you choose me to do this I don't feel like I can do it and of course we you know some of you folks here might be in in management I I've been a manager for a number of years and and and have hired people at different times and when we're in you know a lot of things do parallel well with how the way God thinks but this is a little different when we hire somebody when you hire somebody you know you're looking for the best qualified most of the time very rarely are you looking for someone less qualified but God's very different than that he prefers to call the people who are not really qualified because God prefers to qualify the cult he's not looking for you to come and say well I I'm I'm this like the Pharisee you know i' I've done all these things so I'm I'm in a good position to do more for God no he calls you in a condition where you can't do anything and then he gives you what you need he trains you however he wants to train you brother brandom said the the excuses that's what God uses to tackle the job with and in fact brother mam says this he said he waits for us he waits for us to get into that condition so he can use us waits for us to get into that condition where where we feel like we can't do the job so it's as I said it's counterintuitive to the way we think in the natural we want people that are confident and that are not afraid you know I have had people that afraid to make decisions you know on on the job you need people but God's not looking for that he's looking for the ones that don't know how to make a step forward because he wants them to trust in him to lead them to God guide them and direct them that way so it's a little different than the way that we think he said he chooses us because we're in that condition and he said we find out the people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is God's Heroes they're the ones that God chooses and they'll conquer he said up in the front line he said the people who feel themselves unworthy it's not that they are unworthy but they feel that way they have something in them but it's something that God put there and it's the humbleness that they have in their heart that allows them to succeed some of the greatest ministers I know you know when you talk to them outside of their Ministry you would never imagine they would have that kind of anointing when they're behind the pulpit and that's how I am more convinced that they are men of God I've also heard ministers that seem anointed you talk to them after and they have a terrible Spirit an arrogant Spirit I'm thinking you're not going to get very far with your ministry if you have that you've got to be humble brother Bram said remember this and he's speaking about preachers and but but every one of us he said there's one thing and this always struck with me he said there's one thing that we have got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life and we're all here to fulfill something every person in this building has been called to fulfill something in God's plan you have a purpose purp you're not just here to occupy the Pew and just to sit here but you have something that God desires to he has a desire to express some attribute of himself in your life you might not be a minister maybe you're not an not a deacon or or whatever it is but you have something every person has something that God wants to express through your life but brother bam said we have to master something if we're going to fulfill God's desire in our life we have to master something and he said that thing we have to master Master is the thought of human ability the thought of human ability he said if we ever get to a spot that we think we can do it with our own intelligence our own abilities he said we have got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside so God can use this it seems odd you know it seems odd well I have this ability why shouldn't I be using it but but we it's not the necessarily the ability notice brother Brad said it was the thought the thought that we have that of course God places things within us those that can play an instrument you know there's something within them and they probably sense that but as long as you have a thought that you can do something you're not going to succeed as far as God is concerned you've got to master the thought of human ability he said if we can do that he said we must make a complete surrender in fact he says this he said we cannot use one ability we cannot use one AB ility we've got to make a complete surrender and come to God surrender our soul our body our spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me now it doesn't mean that if you have something that God's placed within you that you feel well that's an ability that I'm just going to not use that no but you have to get rid of the idea that it's yours you got to get rid of the idea that it's your ability it's not your ability if you have anything that you can do it's because the grace of God has has put it in your life but as long as you think it's you and I have this and that's the problem and brother Brown mentions that I think I have a quote here about that he says you know sometimes we want to put something into it and so we we have a gift for something and we're going to try this or we're going to try that we got to forget about that and let God lead us and let God use us he said we can't use one one one ability we've got to surrender it he said everything that you are has to be surrendered to God he goes on he says he said that he said it's hard because we always want to put our part in right God blesses us and then we think oh maybe if I do this and maybe if I do that instead of saying God what would you have me do we we think we we get a little bit of progress in our in what we're doing and then we want to put something in we're always wanting to brother bradam said put our part in but he said no ability I don't care whose it is will ever be usable in the sight of God it's the approach brother Brown said God has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do he said as long as we feel we're doing pretty good that's the struggle because as soon as God does give you something and you start to feel that he said as long as we're feel we're doing pretty good job out of it he said we'll never be used of God well that's that's tough because we all are human and we like to feel that what we're doing is appreciated and so it's a constant battle brother said about ministers you know one of the three things they have to watch is popularity to to to that idea that oh I'm doing a pretty good job and so constantly as ministers we have to we have to put that down and recognize and and of course for a lot of us I know for me there's enough things that there's enough weaknesses in this whole flesh of M that it's not hard for me to realize it's only the grace of God if if I Minister and and God does something it's just the grace of God but for some people it's a lot of work you know they have a hard time to to be humble but for me it's not not been so much of an issue you know those I know my weaknesses and most of us can look in the mirror and see the flaws and if we're if we just constantly remind ourselves it's only the grace of God if he If He blesses what we do then we can keep ourselves in that place where God can use us brother Bram talked he was it was at the time he preached this message he said there was a great Gathering of of protestant and Catholic people about 100 50,000 something like that and he said they were praying some prayers or saying some prayers and they were all gathered together and they would have probably whatever it was at the time and he didn't say why they were gathered and praying but he said they you know they Pro they probably thought they were doing something great but brother brandham said they might as just well have not gathered he said it's not worth nothing in the sight of God you imagine those 150,000 people probably thought they were doing something pretty amazing gathering together and saying some prayers whatever it happened to be that it was but he said they me not even gathered it wasn't worth anything in the sight of God so even our Gatherings and there are churches that are people are meeting together all over the world today you know we have message churches but there's many non-denominational and other groups setting together I wonder how many of those Gatherings are serving basically no purpose as far as the kingdom of God is concerned how many people are gathering together today fulfilling what they feel is satisfying to God when it's kind of like Cain's offering he has no respect to it there's a lot of people that go to church you know every Sunday and and do these things that and I've met those people during Co I come to find out some of the people I worked with you know that they talked about oh I can't go to church and man I didn't know that they even went to church you would never know it because they didn't seem to me like they were Christian people but but they had this routine and they I guess to them they thought it meant something but you know there's going to be a lot of disappointed people one day when they realize that that's just not quite enough we we need to come to church certainly we do we need to gather together it's the right thing the Bible says assemble yourselves even more so as we see the day approaching but that's but it takes more than that takes more than that he said we've got to get away from that that that human ability and surrender our souls and our lives and brother Brown takes that not just to the the the spiritual leaders but brother Brown said even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic he said whoever we are we've got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing know that we are nothing and then he said let God start from there and he'll start moving and working he said that's includes every one of us all of us now some of us as I said don't have that much trouble with that we many are struggling just with living in life and we go through so many trials and tests so some of us maybe don't have that issue we may may maybe we have that the problem on the other side where we feel so inadequate that we don't even try to do anything for God and that's a problem too I want to go to the Book of Judges for a moment and look at at a situation there and a man by the name of Gideon you're familiar with his story but you know the Israel had sinned and we know that God dealt with Israel pretty much exclusively as a nation and so when they sinned usually they were all punished if one man you know it's kind of like the New Testament one man suffers everything and one member suffers they all suffer and that's kind of what happened and the midianites were oppressing them there and judges 6 but then they they begin to cry out to the Lord after a certain point and God begins to respond to them and sends the angel of the Lord along and it happens and we'll pick it up around around the uh let's pick it up at the 12th verse the angel of the Lord positions himself so he's where the man Gideon is threshing by the wine press in fact verse 11 it says Gideon is threshing Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites so if we if we take this scene and we jump at this point in time if you were looking at this and if you were trying to assess how do you think Gideon felt about himself do you think VI Gideon felt like a mighty conqueror do you think Gideon felt like a man that that had had everything within his control we see him here hiding his work from the midianites you know how many of us sometimes get into situations where we feel oppressed by the enemy we don't feel Victorious we feel like we're just doing well to get by and all of a sudden this Angel of the Lord is there in verse 12 and he speaks to Gideon and makes this statement if you can just think about how Gideon was thinking and how he was feeling and here is the Angel of the Lord making a statement in verse 12 and says to him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor now how do you think Gideon if and I I can identify I've been in situations when I felt like Gideon where the enemy just kind of throwing everything at me and and I see it looks like his victory I don't see a lot of God's victories going on and and all of a sudden if I was in that situation and here comes the angel of the Lord saying the Lord is with thee the AL Mighty Man of Valor and Valor there you know another way to say that is it's essentially someone with Fearless courage well Gideon certainly did not feel that way but it says something without reading any further that God sees things in us that we do don't see ourselves he sees potential in us that we don't often see ourselves and he wanted to bring that out so he come there I believe God sent that angel of the Lord there to give give Gideon some courage to stand up against this enemy and of course Gideon's response is as we would expect in verse 13 oh my Lord if the Lord be with us then why is all this befallen us and I think me saying this to you and even to me if I was to say that to you that you are children of Valor that you are men and women of Valor you might be in a situation today where you would have a hard time to believe that but that's exactly the situation Gideon was in you know there was there wasn't a lot of Victory there was a lot of a lot of trouble he was in and yet that didn't change the tress of the statement that was made to him that he was a mighty man of Valor he just didn't know it he he hadn't couldn't quite grasp that that could be true and I say it's the same of us and you hear men you know preachers come and I'm taking the weakness route this way because of the what God has inspired me to say but others will come by and talk about what God can do you know if he can get one man in his power and you hear all of that but you say how can that be me same way it could be for Gideon God sees within you something that he wants to pull out of you and that is a faith and that is an action that he wants to do in your life to accomplish something for him you could have loved ones out there could be many different things but God can work through you the same as he was going to work through Gideon here now the victory wasn't there yet all the Gideon saw was this enemy surrounding them and it was a great enemy more than a match for Gideon and that's probably what he was looking at and he's thinking well you know how could this possibly be be that we could overcome this enemy you know why if God is with us why is all of this befallen us and where's all the Miracles it says our fathers told us of well the angel of the Lord begins to encourage him and he encourages him in different ways we won't read all this this passage right now but if you read it you'll see where he does that and finally Gideon is convinced he tells him and he goes and he gathers a bunch of men together thousands of them and then God says if you read through the next couple of chapters you know he says well that's too many and you would think Gideon's just doing what he feels is right because it's a huge host that he's going to come up against and God says well that's too many he said if we do it this way the children of Israel going to think that they accomplished it of Their Own Strength so what was he trying to do he he he actually caused Gideon to go through a couple of steps to reduce the Army down to 300 to put it into a condition where it would have seemed impossible why because God wanted to show that it wasn't their ability it was going to be in weakness it was going to be in something that would seem impossible that God wanted to express himself it's easy to believe God when when everything is going well it's easy to believe God when we feel that we have control that's why people were you know raising children and different things they feel well I've got control and they don't they don't really exercise their faith because they they have control but it's like the range breaking you know when you're riding the horse you know you I have faith when I'm holding on to the rains well you don't need faith when you're holding on to the rains if you can drive if you know what you're doing you don't need Faith but when the rains break or when the brakes fail in the car and you're going down a hill you know and you can't get stopped that's what you need faith and so it's that way in life too when we when we've reached situations where there's absolutely nothing that we can do to fix it we like to fix things you know we like to solve problems when they come we what can I do but sometimes there's nothing we can do but trust in God and so God puts us in situations where we have to trust him he'll do that in our lives and and that's where and that's that's the trial of our faith that's why we are put through these things but we have more within us we just don't realize how much potential is there sometimes in spite of our weakness God is able to do great things and God wants us in that condition to where we can trust him and so he if we won't come to it on our own he'll certainly bring situations along where we have no opport no other option but to trust God brother Bram said history proves that God always chooses nobody's to become as somebody's he always chooses nobodies now there's a couple of there's an exception we're going to talk about here but most of the time God has choosing the weak the nobodies to become as somebodies he says the thing of it is having nothing that you can depend on in your own self or anything that you can do just a complete total surrender of your weaknesses unto God that's what God wants us to do say here I am having nothing having no ability that you can trust in that's not that's not comfortable for us we we don't want to be in that situation we want to be built up to a place where we feel that we can do something but God's not interested in that God is wants us to be in this condition where we feel inadequate and then he empowers us to do what he wants us to do but even when he does that we we we must always recognize that it's God and abling us to do it it's not it's not that we're good it's not that we are great it's not that we've got some great inherent ability in ourselves it's just God working within us so he uses noodies to become as somebody takes those that have been the world brother Brown said has rejected the modern age is rejected that's the kind he picks to use consider he said the apostles like Peter the fisherman I was preaching in a foreign country a few years ago and the pastor is the only Pastor I know of who actually has a a doctor of divinity degree you know and and never thought when I was ministering this it was what was on my heart this thought he has great emphasis on education and he come to me after and he was he appreciated the message but he mentioned you know about what I'm saying about Peter he said you know Peter was an educated man I thought well that's not what brother brandom said and that's not what the scripture would suggest either and he explained himself and I kind of took what he said but brother Brown said Peter the fisherman not enough education to write his own name and another place brother Brown said he wouldn't recognize his name if it was if if somebody wrote it and he was looking at it he wouldn't have recognized it so so I you know I that I'm I'm fine to believe it just that way that it was like that John ignorant and unlearned those men brother BR said he bypassed the Nobles and the education that doesn't mean God doesn't use education it's more of a problem it's like the rich man you know it's easier to go rich man to go through an eye of an needle I think sometimes for the educated it's it's easier to be ignorant than it is because education certainly is designed especially nowadays to take you away from God and so you have to be very careful with it he said that he said it was these unlearned John the unlearn he bypassed the Nobles educated priests celebrities of them days and the scholars and the church members and he said he's got those people who thought they were somebody and pick the people who were nobody and use them but here's the thing to get to the what I might call the exception to the rule brother Brown said a somebody can become one of his people and Paul's a good example of that we want to talk about him in a few moments but he said if somebody can become one of his people and God can use them if they're ready to forget that there is somebody so that's the that's the part that we have to remember so those with education and we're we're living in a world where almost everyone's educated now when I grew up people would drop out of school and get a job and they'd work their whole life and in some form trades wherever it was without needing much education now you need University College to do just basic things and so we're we're being forced into that so we have a lot more of that going on well it doesn't mean you can't serve God but you've got to put all of that aside and and and not think that that is going to contribute in some way that that's what you're going to use well I'm educated so now I can do this for God no he said you have to forget that you're somebody forget whatever it is that you've accomplished in your life in in your secular life and your education he said if you're ready to forget that you're a somebody become a nobody God can use you and make a somebody out of you but he said you for you've got to forget you're so important he said some people as soon as they become Christians become arrogant and indifferent and so on he said they're going backwards instead of forwards he said thee more you can get out of yourself the more room you've got for the Holy Spirit to come in so we want to take the example of Paul because Paul was one we'll talk about Moses too we know Moses was educated and God took it out of him but with Paul he didn't take his education out of him Paul was very scholarly but notice Paul's approach so he's a good example for those of us who might feel well I I had I you know I'm smart and Whatever It Is Well Paul's a good example of how to approach serving God with that uh handicap I would like to say those of us think it's a strength but I think it's a handicap sometimes 1 Corinthians chapter 2 beginning at the first verse Paul says this he said he said I Brethren when I come to you came not with Excellency of speech now Paul used his education at times he was a great orator he was able to speak he was brought before Kings and he would speak but when it come to the word of God and when it come to speaking to the people he said I didn't come to you with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified notice verse three and I don't believe what Paul's about to say here in verse three was an act I believe he was sincere he said I was with you in weakness in weakness in fear and in much trembling now Paul was probably more educated than almost anyone that he spoke to but yet he his approach he had got somehow in his life he had he was able to come down to a place he was humble enough to feel weak to actually be fearful and to be in much trembling recognizing no doubt how significant it was being in the role that he was called to as the first messenger maybe not fully understanding he was but we know he was and yet understanding that responsibility to speak the truth it's it's it's a fearful responsibility anyone who's called to be a minister you know you you getting up and just saying things you you've got to be sure it's so easy to take a scripture to take a quote and go off somewhere here and be saying something that's not right and so he he he always approached his speaking in weakness and in fear and in much trembling verse four and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom and he had that he could have used that he could have leaned on that ability that he had but he put that aside he said I didn't come with that but in demonstration of the spirit and of power and why did he do it that way so that our faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God Paul Paul was humble enough that he didn't want to draw people to and that's a tremendous thing because there's something about human beings that want people to like them want people to be drawn to them but Paul deliberately spoke in a way that would not draw attention to himself that would not draw people to him but to draw them to God that's a tremendous gift to have that considering how how how educated Paul was how he could have spoken a way that would have caused people to be impressed with him instead of being impressed with what he was saying about God so he had this gift of being able to Humble himself genuinely humble himself to be able to speak to them in such a way that they saw God when they looked at Paul they didn't see Paul the great Paul they saw god brother Bram said realize that you've got to become nothing back to this again not a know- it all not a great somebody but a nobody so we've got to always and here's the thing brother Brown said you've got to become dust you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing and notice this and don't never rise above it most of us reach that point at some point in our lives maybe multiple times but then when things get going well you know that's what happened to many characters in the Bible when they got blessed Hezekiah different ones that God blessed and all of a sudden they begin to think more of themselves but brother Bram said you need to get to a place that you know you're nothing and don't ever rise above it no matter how long you're here no matter how much God blesses you don't ever feel like you're somebody great don't ever feel like you're something everything that God does through you that blesses the people do it in a way that's why Jesus said don't let the left hand know what the right hand is doing don't be looking for attention don't be looking for for appreciation from men and that's hard to do because we're human beings we have that desire for to be appreciated but if if we're really children of God we want God to get the glory because it's him that enables us to do what we do well Paul you know Paul was aware and became aware certainly of how easily it could have been remember Paul was taken and God showed him things that he didn't show anybody else in his day and so he had great revelation of the scripture the Bible says and I want to go to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 you're familiar with this and begin to read Around the seventh verse Paul recognized the the risk of what could happen to him that that popularity side one of those risks that the prophet spoke of he makes a statement here in verse 7 2 Corinthians 12: 7 he says unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelation and so he he had a concern that with all of this knowledge that somehow it could cause him to think more of himself than he should lest I should be exalted above measure there was given to me you know we we think about the blessings of God but this that Paul was given was also from God and it was one of the greatest things that God could have gave him and was a thorn in the flesh it was a gift sometimes we think about suffering and pain and sickness as a as something from the devil and of course the devil causes that but sometimes God allows certain things that aren't very nice and Paul recognized this particular thing as a as a gift he said it was given to me a thorn in the flesh and what was The Thorn In the Flesh scripture says it was the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure so he knew he recognized it now he recognized it at this point that he's writing about it but when it first came upon him we know that he wanted it to be he wanted it to to to go away because he says in verse 8 for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and it wasn't until Jesus responds and tells him well in verse 9 he said my grace is sufficient my grace is enough my grace is enough for you and then he tells him why the thorn is there my strength because the thorn made Paul weak The Thorn In the Flesh which we're going to talk about in a moment kept Paul in a weakened condition and so he said Jesus said to him he spoke to him he said my strength is made perfect in weakness and it could have said your weakness because that's really what he was talking about my strength is made perfect in weakness all of a sudden Paul's eyes are open now he understands why he has this Thorn In the Flesh that's a tremendous thing and most of us would not welcome something like that Paul needed it and you and I need to some extent we're going to read a few things about what Paul experienced but and we may never experience it like that but but in our own way in God's way he has in our lives things that he allows to keep us humble for the same reasons you know that that that we might find ourselves thinking more more of ourselves and so God works through us but then he keeps us humble at the same time in whatever manner is needed and in the case of Paul it was this Thorn In the Flesh my grace is sufficient my strength is made perfect in weakness after he got that revelation of all the things that he got the revelation of understanding that this Thorn In the Flesh was a gift from God to keep him in the condition that God desired so that he could continue to do the work of God he makes this conclusion more most gladly therefore hard thing to come to but it's something we need to he said most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities we like to Glory when God does some good things for us but Paul recognized his infirmities was for him one of the best gifts that God could have gave him he said I will rather glory in my infirmities why because then the power of God might rest upon me Paul knew that if I if he did didn't have that to Humble him he would get exalted and then God would have to cast him aside there's a quote brother Brandon mentions since I don't have the reference right now but brother bam said there's many a good Minister because of popularity and women and money those things that get to Ministry he said there's many a good Minister that God has had to lay on the Shelf because of of failing in one of those things and so as gifted as Paul was if he had have been allowed to P that roote and get exalted above measure God would have had to lay him on the Shelf too but God desired to express himself and so was it was one of the best gifts that God could have given Paul was this Thorn In the Flesh to keep him humble why so that God could continue to work through Paul to accomplish his purpose Paul's Thorn In the Flesh now there people different people think different things brother Bram said it was no more a disease than anything else he said if it wasn't healing he got well notice what the scripture says and we read it the Bible says it was the messenger of Satan to Buffet me that's what it says some people thought it was his blindness and different things but the scripture says it was the messenger of Satan to Buffet me and what does the word Buffet mean brother bam says it means blow after blow so he didn't have just a continuous problem maybe for you or me it might be just something we deal with all the time but with Paul he would get a blow after blow brother brandham said he would heal him and he would get well he would heal him again then he would get sick he would heal him he got sick blow after blow but it wasn't just sickness there were many things that Paul went through he said the messenger of Satan not an infirmity as he meant as people he said try to interpret well just as Paul had these things we have them too and in fact the prophet says and we wonder sometimes well I'm a Christian I'm doing my best why am I experiencing these things it's because you are because you are a son or a daughter of God that you do experience these kinds of Trials brother Brandon makes a statement and these are not popular quotes I you know I I know I noticed that the people are not jumping in their seats and hollering amen over this but it's the truth anyways this quote won't won't excite you either but it's still true brother bradam said Satan will punch at you constantly constantly punching you until you're finished here on Earth constantly you know brother car's 94 years old it be 95 in February and he just lost his wife two years ago and he will tell you that that was the greatest trial he's ever gone through and here he served the Lord for 50 some years more than some people have been alive preaching the gospel and here he goes through what he says is probably his greatest trial he ever experienced just a couple years ago so we're never going to be free of this until we get to the other side so don't ever get to the place where we feel like well it's just going to be good after this no if you're a daughter or son of God Satan's going to punch at you you just need to be aware of it and then so then we need to get like Paul and that's not an easy thing to do to where we can glory in our infirmities and in our troubles and in our trials or as Peter says the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold it's not intuitive to think that way but but it's scripture it's the truth it is the way God works we should not be so alarmed that we have trouble now sometimes people have trouble because of things they do but as Christians you're going to you're going to have trouble because that's part of the testing and the trying and Satan is allowed to punch at us as long as we're here on this Earth he said until you're finished on Earth just remember that brother Bram said and I know this isn't a popular thing but he said you'll never have a time but when there's a punching going on all the time so so if we're looking for that we' need to change our thinking you're going to get you're going to get wore out thinking I just need to endure this because it's going to there's going to be a relapse no he's going to do that because that's his job and God's allowing it to keep us humble to build our faith to test us many reasons but he allows it doesn't mean that God's not with you doesn't mean that you're not going to overcome you will overcome just understand that it's there and if anything it's a sign it's really a sign that you're on the right road to know that Satan is coming at you the way he does because you look out in the world and that's why people do and they see people going and living their sinful lives and they seem like they're happy a lot of them out there are happy they are they go through things but they don't seem to go through things we go through why because their punishment is deferred their punishment's coming but as a bride we have to stand before Christ spotless and so God is is preparing us now we're going through all these things now but one day it'll be over for the sinner they have a reckoning day coming you don't if you're a CH son and daughter of God you don't have a reckoning day coming you're going to stand before God an overcomer well you got to have something to overcome brother bam said if you're going to be an overcomer 2 Corinthians chapter 11 I want to read about Paul just to show you the things that Paul went through we think oh we go through a lot well well let's look at what Paul went through a little bit and I think maybe it'll put some things in per perspectives Paul recognizes his ministry verse 23 2 Corinthians 11 and 23 read a few verses he said are they Ministers of Christ he said I speak as a fool so Paul you know he he's he's kind of boasting but yet he's recognizing it's just the grace of God he said I I am more and labors more abundant in Stripes so here here he's he's bragging but look what he's bragging about in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths of now most of us in our whole lifetime won't experience any of these things of the Jews five times received I 40 Stripes save one now Paul is not I want you to know because when we get to the end of this you'll see it Paul's not complaining here he's just letting people know what he's experiencing verse 25 Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night in the day I have been in the deep in journeyings often in Perils of waters in Perils of robbers perils by my own countrymen in perils by the Heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea and perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and in nakedness besides so besides he said those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches I'm TI it makes me tired just think just reading about what Paul experienced thinking about all of those things and a lot of the inspirational writings of Paul he didn't write them in the comfort of his easy chair at home he was in prison and he wrote things that we get great inspiration out of him here he's in a compromis he he doesn't have his freedom and here he's writing things to exhort the people that's what he did that was his gift that's what God was using him for verse 29 who is weak and I'm not weak who is offended and I burn not so Paul didn't just deal with those things from without he dealt with it just like we do from within the bickerings and things that happen in families and in churches and all that it's everywhere and he's dealing with that too verse 30 notice this now if I must needs Glory comes back to what we read before I will glory of the things which concern M infirmities you know I haven't heard too many people brag about that I haven't heard too many people look at that as a positive thing most of us when we're boasting thing we're boting about God healed and and we should we we need to thank the Lord for the things he does for us don't ever stop doing that but not too many people give glory for being in trouble and being in distress or being in a sickness or being and and and we know that some of these things for us are just things that we're experiencing and God's going to deliver and and sometimes it's just for that but if God does allow us to go through a long trial you know it's often it's often a burdensome thing but with Paul he said if I'm going to glory in anything he said I'm going to glory in my infirmities not an easy thing to do Paul with that great Revelation brother BR said the only reason he was given The Thorn In the Flesh was to keep him down so that he wouldn't get big and exalted God kept him down and small but really Paul wasn't small but he was he got that's the way he was in his in his own mind it kept Paul humble in the condition so that he could use him brother Bram said so he could use him in different parts of the country doe for him what he wanted to because he had the revelation of Jesus Christ who he was so he had a great ministry a great calling but God had to give him that in order for him to be able to give that to the people of his day and for us to then benefit from it as well he had to keep Paul humble with this Thorn In the Flesh now we don't have maybe that gift but all of us have something as as I said that God wants to do with us and so whatever it is you know the more God blesses us you you can expect that God is also going to temper that with things that are designed to keep us in a humble condition brother Bram says it too for about his own Ministry he said I I have a thorn in the flesh an angel of Satan who follows and tries to buffet or beset but he's been defeated he said in every case by the Holy Spirit but AB brah dealt with a lot of things with all the sicknesses and things that were healed under his ministry he dealt himself with sicknesses and infirmities he would get an injury and you know he'd go pray for somebody and here he's dealing with something himself that would linger and linger and linger in his own life when he had his accident you all know that Billy Paul said why don't you just speak the word you know but the gift that brother bradam had wasn't for him it was for us others same as yours and mine is too to our Ministries and whatever it is that God has called us and everyone has some kind of a Ministry you know whatever it is it's it's not for you you're going to get benefited from others you know I have a Ministry and I trust that it's a help to people but when I need help I don't I can't lean on that I look for God to use someone else I look for somebody else and and God does God steps in and it could be a minister it could just be a lay person could be anything that that God uses I I can't rely on myself to help myself but yet sometimes we do have to encourage ourselves like David did but still our gifts are for are for others we're in this flesh you know and it's it's here it's a sticker brother Bram called it he called it the greatest enemy he called him he said the greatest enemy I have is William brandom he said he's the one that gets in the way and you know sometimes we like to blame our lack of success on or or or our spiritual walk maybe on somebody else that we feel has done something to hurt us but but we're Our Own Worst Enemy the one that we look at in the mirror every morning they're the one brother Brown said he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place where he thinks he can do something and when he does he shov shoves God out of the picture speaking about himself he said when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to the place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandom knows nothing about and he said that's when God can use you he can use you and any of us he said when we can get out of the way but he said as long as we got ourselves in the way then we can't now Paul here in the same passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians 12 you know Jesus told him my grace is sufficient and he said I take pleasure in in in in in verse 10 he said therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and in reproaches and and in NE necessities and in persecutions and in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong so every time when Paul got into this condition and I have seen it as I said my own Ministry there have been times when I've been so distressed and so upset and maybe nervous before ministering that I almost wasn't sure I was going to be able to function and it and and without fail it was in those times when and something unique happen something special would happen that you could never have anticipated you think well you're the worst prepared you could possibly be you're not even fit to go out you don't feel you know confident and all those things and that's when God does the most it's when you feel the least and so so I as I recognize that I I constantly try every time when whatever I'm trying to do for the Lord to to try to get myself to where I'm not putting anything of myself into it but Lord if you don't do something something nothing's going to get done if you don't help me nothing's going to get done my strength God said to Paul brother Brown said my strength is made perfect is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker the more that you can yield to me the better I can use you the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination and that didn't mean that Paul forsook it his education we know God that he still used it for for purposes but he never relied on it it wasn't what he depended on he depended on God the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to me the more I can use you because you become weak I'll make my own purpose strong and so God can make strength out of weakness like we read in Hebrews 11 out of weakness they were made strong out of weakness and humility God chooses people to build his kingdom out of he said if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church he said we'll stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings know it nothings is what he called them he said isn't it strange that God likened us to sheep sheep who are helpless you know the the other animals they have defenses some have are predators and they do things and others have defenses but sheep don't really have any defense whatsoever and God likened us to that why because the Sheep depends on the shepherd we depend on our shepherd He said we get to that place brother Bram said that's the way God wants us to realize we're totally insufficient then he said God takes that person and begins to mold himself into the person and make his hands do what God would have hands to do make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his is their gods see brother Brandon when he would get there in those discernments he would be so in tune with God that the Holy Spirit would come and speak through him and that he when it was done he didn't even know what he said I mean that that would be amazing that we could get to such a place that God could just use us and we don't even realize what we're doing you know the the Holy Spirit a life of the holy ghost in a person that causes them to live a certain way brother Brown said it's an automatic life lived you just do the right thing that there's something in your nature and you just do that we are God's hands we're God's lips he said he begins to build a character God speaking of God begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and to make his own self if you go back to the the beginnings with cainan and Abel and when God slew Abel we were left with Seth and Cain's line those two lines brother Bram said God side to contrast the two he said God side was weak and humble that's how God used them that's God's opportunity it's God's way of getting to us is when we are weak the case with us he said is not that we are too weak but that we are too strong he said it's not that the issue isn't that we're too weak it's that we're too strong he said we're too strong-headed too strong in our head we know too much and sometimes it's our reasoning and so we may we may recognize we're weak but then we reason out somehow that that God can do something with us and so in that way our our head gets in the way our thinking gets in the way and so brother brandom said it's not that we're too weak it's that we're too we're too strong we know too much and he said God wants to get that out of us he said we're too strong to yield to him we we want to do something we want to control it and it's when we lose that control that somehow we lose Faith too but that's when we need faith and and sometimes we need Faith even if we might think we have something we can do because sometimes God wants us to just take our hands off things because a lot of times we cause more problems by putting our hands on things that God needs to do when it comes to loved ones and and you know I know that's a big thing for a lot of people myself included too but you know the Bible says no man can come to me except my father draw him and so we have a part to play as parents and as family members and as as loved ones and as friends to seow seeds but beyond that that's all our role is we cannot save anyone and not of ourselves it's something that God has to do we have to apply the token we have to put it there and then trust that God in his own time not our time our time you know would be now you know we don't want to see anybody out there not serving the lord you know especially our loved ones you know it's it's discouraging and all of that but but God has a path for everyone to walk and we might think it should be the same path we walked but it isn't always God chooses to allow people to go different roads and sometimes times those roads cause scars and all that we know that but that doesn't change God can save uh people in any condition no matter if they go astray whatever they do God can bring them back I want to speak about Dwight Moody for a few moments I'm not I haven't even been watching my time but you can ring the bell or put the sign up you know the time's up Dwight Moody I want to talk about him for a moment we know that he was a minister that had great influence thousands maybe millions of people that that come to the Lord through his his ministry but his upbringing was very was very simple and very humble he was born into a bankrupt family of nine children his father loved to drink and he died when Dwight Moody was only four years old so he was raised basically by by his mom he made a statement one time he said the world has yet to see so this was a determination he had and I don't think it was an arrogant statement he made but it turned out to be I believe quite true for him but he said the world has yet to see what God can do with a man fully consecrated to him and he said by God's help I aim to be that man and of course he was he was a shoe cobbler brother brandham said he was weak this is Brother bram's description of him he said he was an example of weakness it says that his grammar was was terrible he didn't have education and a man come up and criticized his grammar he said your grammar is the poorest I ever heard and of course you know this I'm I'm sure you've all heard this the statement he made he said I'm winning Souls with my ignorance what are you doing with your education and brother Bram said I thought that was a good answer and it's true he was weak in education weak in speech he whined through his nose he had a nasal condition why would he have that you know for some people that would be distraction You' think why would God allow that but he but it was something for people to criticize he was a little short fellow physically was a wreck he had nothing but weakness continually but God used him to shake the world in his day they brought a reporter one time to the meeting and and they and they set through the meeting and they said you know I don't know what would attract anyone to to come and here you know Dwight Moody you know he it's the poorest preacher and all talked about all the things that was that was bad told him said he was ugly and all of these things and he said I don't see anything in Dwight Moody that would attract the attention of anybody well when Dwight Moody heard that I mean he felt really good about it he said because they don't he said they don't come to see me they come to see God and so if we can get to that place in our life that when we're doing something for God it's so inconspicuous that that people see God and not see you they see God and not see me my my greatest accomplishment today would be that that God would speak and I've seen it happen in in services and I've gone and people you know would come and say that God had spoken very personally very direct to them and so for me it's great because I have no way to know and so I know that that's not me it's not that it's not that I like I know that this person has this issue so I'm going to hit that thing I go to places I don't know what their issues are but some of them go come and say you know you you walked right down through my life and so so that that makes me feel that God spoke to them not me because I know that I have no way to know those things and that's the way God wants to use you to to speak to people not from some great Insight that you have that you go there feel well I've got something I can say to them well if you do that you're not going to accomplish anything you've got to go in humbleness sometimes people go astray or you got somebody in the church that needs you know and the Bible says that they were Are Spiritual go to those that are weak and we need to do that but we also need to be very humble about that approach and how we do that because we can just cause more trouble if we go about it thinking well I I can help them I can say this I can say that or I can do this you're not going to accomplish any anything like that now Moses we we'll talk about Moses for a moment I'm getting down to the end here now Moses you know we know that that God took all of his ability and education out of him so different than Paul he sent him out into the Wilderness and he put him out there and he he's a Shepherd for 40 years and got married and you know he he gone had to get that all of that confidence that that he had and all of that ability all those things things he had learned down there and I it's a good example for us to show that that God can give you what you need you may not feel you have it Moses got to a place where he didn't feel adequate to go down well that was God that got him to that place see brother Bram said if you if you're like to say well brother I can preach he see he said he can't use you as long as you can preach see if you say well I can preach he said he can't use you as long as you can preach I can do this I can do that he said 'y you can't do nothing' he said you cannot depend on your natural abilities and he said there's one thing I admire about Moses he he had sense enough to know when he was licked is the way brother Bram described it he had sense enough to know and here's it's interesting I'm going to throw this out and this is a kind of an interesting thing and we we think well why would God do this God took him out in the backside of the the the desert brother brandham said and he used this expression to learn him some human weaknesses to learn him some human weaknesses because you know he didn't have any when he went out there he was pretty confident in his abilities he took him out there to learn him some human weaknesses well what did he use to do that is the interesting part because we think well God would have went out and talk to him in the wilderness no no wasn't that at all it was his wife so Moses the Bible says Moses was a man Meek above all men on the Earth but Moses also had a temper odd seems like a almost a paradox to that someone could be meek and yet have a temper at the same time but Moses had a temper and you know in a marriage it's good sometimes to to have that those two sides to to have a Harmony there but in this situation God chose to give him a wife who had a temper as well and this is what brother brandham said and it was for this purpose that we're talking about about he said God must have had a time with him back there Moses had a temper and God gave him a wife by the name of zapara and she had one two he said I imagined things wasn't so pleasing On The Backs side of the desert for a while when both of their tempers got out of control at the same time now here's Moses one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament we think well how could that be God but it was God or God ordained that wife for Moses and that conflict that naturally would have toen Place taken place was by Design he said I I imagine things weren't so pleasing when they got their tempers out of control at the same time he said I suppose his intellectual conception of how psychology ought to control a person because he probably had his ideas about that brother BR said it didn't do much good he said when they got down on their Road Zapora he said still had the temper she cut the foreskin off and threw it before Moses you're a bloody husband to me he said I guess there was a little things that God had to teach him back there that he was human that he was a human all of his wisdom and his powers and all that God could not use any of those things that he had learned down there in Egypt and then brother man makes a statement did God feel sorry for Moses and his weaknesses no God wasn't sorry for him he never took pity on him no he wasn't sorry for him he he he put him in in that he put him in that c circumstance God said 40 years out here I've had you and Zapora fussing and carrying around in this Wilderness whether you could find out there's human weakness or not and you're out in the desert with a bunch of sheep and a high-tempered wife he said that fixed him up Moses in an awful shape yeah you won't hear Too Many preachers use this quote but it's but I'm telling you that's what brother Brown said he said now I can use you when you realize you're nothing Moses needed that he he wasn't in the place now God could have chose somebody else but no Moses was the one that God had predestinated he said I can use you when you realize you're nothing he said give us and God he said God give us some more of that kind now he's now the statement he's about to make isn't talking about high tempered he said give us more of that kind give us more weaklings he said that's what we need some weaklings so that's his call he's in search of of weaklings of weakness n and we all can identify with it but can we identify that God might in spite of our weakness want to use us when we're in those conditions where we don't feel adequate because that's really what it's all about instead of saying Lord I I can't do anything for you because I've got this and that now sin is a different story we're not talking just about Sin uh you know if you've got something in your life you need delivered then you need delivered and but as far as weakness and the human weakness where sometimes we say and do things out of term that that we're always going to deal with some of those things but it's that condition that we can get into where we have to totally depend upon God can we get there because that's how God is going to do something with us he says this he said today we know we need a Revival we know we need a stirring among the people and we all look for that we desire that we know we're at the end we know it's dark and and we know there's not going to be a sweeping worldwide Revival we're past that but I believe that there can be and preachers preach it I I believe that too that God can stir us and give us a Revival Among Us he can give a give us a Revival in our local church but he said this he said it'll not take a doctor of divinity here's what brother Bram said it would take to bring that he said it'll take a weakling that'll take the word of God in the power and resurrection of Christ well how can they do that they can do that by not putting any of themselves in it but let God work through them in their weakness brother BR said we needed David on trained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy or something some little guy with stoop shoulders not much to look at come down walking down the road with the power of God weakness so that's what God has always used is people who are willing to submit to that I know we don't emphasize it but I want to close with just a couple of quotes here brother Brown said it's the Simplicity of the Gospel that staggers the people he said they they'll they make it a great intellectual something or another but he said it's the simpleness god takes the very tool of humility and weakness and simplicity to work his works with sometimes we make it so complicated and so mysterious that that it just can't be grasped that's not what this message come to do this message come to take the mystery out of things not put more mystery into it it's the simpleness brother Bram said God takes the very tool of humility and weakness and simplicity to work his works with think about John the Baptist coming out of the Wilderness at 30 years old he said I brother BR said I can imagine a Blackbeard hanging about his face and fuzzy big old piece of sheep skin wrapped around him stood in mud up to his knees and said I am the one that spoke of was spoke of by the prophet Isaiah imagine what he looked like to the people and so we have it in our mind how God would work and who God would use and what God would do but God can work in the simplest things and in the simplest ways God's strategy the prophet said strategy we think about strategy that's a big thing big word God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them at Pentecost what did he do he said he took them 10 days to get emptied up see they were standing there with their vessels turned up and God filled them and then they shook the world poured himself into them he said that's what we need today is empty vessels that God can fill God can use them but if they're already filled up with other things God can't do anything he can't pour anything into them he needs empty vessels that he can fill and we know that we're living in an hour like no other where the enemy is you know the demons have been loosed on this world and they're just everywhere we're dealing with things that we never had to deal with that brother brandham in his day didn't have to deal with to the extent that we see them now brother brandham warned about that too you know he said we have you know we have we dealt with this and now our children have 10 times he talked about that you know the the the the demons and the problems they're faced what will it be for their children when we're in that generation now brother Brandon saw it getting worse and worse and worse he said talk about the lid off the kettle demons going around powers of the devil under the name of Christianity because it's not just the ones out there that are so obvious it's under the Realms of Christianity so all of these movements now even with the things that are developing with the transgender movement all that you know they're not just out there anti some of them are Antichrist certainly but some of them are trying to legitimize what they do some of them are trying to suggest somehow that God supports what they're doing and so those those are spiritual devils out there powers of the devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men he said who is able who is strong enough who's wise enough who's powerful enough to tame this Legion now this is a very real threat this is a very real uh thing that we have to deal with these demons that are out there oppressing and and possessing people and trying to influence us he said who's strong enough powerful enough to tame this Legion he said ' who caname that devil he said you you'll do it you'll do it when you empty up and become weak you'll do it when you'll empty up and become weak and pour out all of yourself let the Holy Ghost come in and flood every part of you saturate every lid of your body empty vessels what he needs a little minority that will receive God's power and blessings in his message he said that's what we need get weak so you can get strong he said it'll conquer every devil it will put the learned to shame it'll bring men and women who God has called those empty vessels those weak vessels that are willing to submit themselves to God get empty he says as I'm closing get empty friends get weak deny your own ability put yourself pour yourselves on God's altar as a sacrifice let the angel come with a fire and fill the vessel with the power of almighty God then he'll make you strong and he'll give you Grace to stand the last quote brother Ram said when you can become nothing in your own sight you're becoming something in God's sight then you can become nothing in your own sight always be conscious the prophet said of your littleness and then God can do something with you different thought different approach to speaking not not the way maybe you you would have expected to hear it but but I I want to get you know the all of us have things we're facing all of us have Devils that are tormenting we have loved ones we desire to see saved we have people that are sick we desire to see healed but we serve the same God that the prophets sered we serve the same God of the Bible and sometimes we wonder how is this all going to work well any one of us God can use to accomplish anything but it does come down to that approach I think sometimes we emphasize so much about about being a assertive and exercising power and all of those kind and and I believe in all of those things too but there's this element of weakness this element of humbleness that must go with it not not uh fear not fear in the sense that we're afraid of the devil because the Bible says we can do all things through Christ which strengthens us we we don't need to have fear but we need to approach it with God at the Forefront not with saying well I can do this I I'm inspired I'm going to go do this I'm going to go do that no just let God work through you say Lord there's a need what can I do how can I be yielded to you that you can work through me to accomplish something for you because he can and he will he wants to work through us but sometimes we are trying to dictate how that's going to be we're trying to take over we're trying to take God's role over well it's not up to us God we want to be his hands well that means we've got to yield our hands as long as I've got control of my hands how is God going to have control of them as long as I'm the one doing the speaking with my with my mind how is God going to speak through me I've got to yield I've got to get to the place almost like Moses where I don't even know what I should say and then God can come in and take this vessel over because I've lost control I've let that control go to God that's what he's looking for these weak vessels that are willing to submit themselves to the Lord amen maybe we could stand they can come to the instruments you know that song I think it's number 91 in your book if you know the Lord you need nobody else maybe we can sing that one this morning there's God is not limited by no means in what he can accomplish in this time it's not we know we're in the darkest age darkest part of the age but God has not changed what he can do and what he can do through you if you'll yield yourself to him I believe he can do anything he can do Miracles he can heal he can save he can deliver but it's going to take a submissive heart to to the Lord that he can just use us the way he would want to use us let's just sing this song together if you know the Lord L you need nobody else to see you through the darkest night you may walk alone you only need the Lord to see you on
