[39:33] another thought this evening on the
[39:35] spirit of Truth and we're going to spend
[39:37] a couple services on this because
[39:39] there's a lot to it amen but I want to
[39:41] kind of lead talk about what led us up
[39:43] to John chapter 14 and Beyond this
[39:45] morning or this evening just as we dwell
[39:47] on this thought of of the spirit of
[39:49] Truth and if we look in John 12 and I
[39:52] I'll just summarize it for us this
[39:53] evening for the sake of time but in John
[39:55] 12 we see Mary of Bethany that's the
[39:57] sister of Lazarus the man who was raised
[39:59] from the dead remember Jesus went up to
[40:01] the where he was buried and it was 4
[40:03] days the body had already started to
[40:05] decompose and he went and he stood in
[40:07] front and he said Lazarus come forth and
[40:09] Lazarus walked out from the grave his
[40:11] body had already been into corruption
[40:13] and yet when he spoke those words
[40:15] everything went back to the way it was
[40:16] and he walked out completely healed from
[40:19] Death if we could put it that way amen
[40:21] but he Mary comes in and Jesus is
[40:23] sitting there and he's eating and
[40:25] nobody's washed his feet and they put
[40:27] them aside in these different things and
[40:29] she comes in and remember she pours the
[40:31] spikenard from that that alabaster box
[40:34] and it was a it was a fragrance that was
[40:36] very very expensive and we know that it
[40:38] was symbolic CU it was uh uh It Was
[40:41] preparing him for his burial amen and
[40:43] Mary was literally stepping into the
[40:45] scripture when she did that and it was
[40:47] it was uh related to that Prophecy of
[40:50] the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God
[40:52] and yet there was somebody there that
[40:53] said she shouldn't have done that she
[40:55] should have taken that and she should
[40:57] have taken the money she spent and she
[40:59] could have should have given it to the
[41:00] poor and we know who that was and it was
[41:02] Judas who was the the one that would
[41:04] betray Jesus and the scripture said he
[41:06] said that not because he wanted the
[41:09] money for the poor it says he said that
[41:11] because he was a
[41:12] thief see he put a religious spin on his
[41:16] response he tried to elevate him above
[41:19] what she was and what she was doing but
[41:21] Mary was supernaturally led to do what
[41:23] she did there amen she wasn't LED of her
[41:26] own Des desire or her own need for
[41:28] recognition or anything but she went
[41:30] there and she poured it over his feet
[41:32] and then she washed his feet with it and
[41:34] then she wiped it with her own hair from
[41:37] behind she didn't even want him to see
[41:40] her but she went behind him and wiped
[41:42] his feet with with her hair amen she
[41:45] didn't want anything for herself and yet
[41:47] Judas tried to put down the sacrifice
[41:49] that she had made because he wanted what
[41:50] she had given for himself let me tell
[41:53] you when you do something for God it's
[41:55] between you and God it's between between
[41:57] you and God and so often what we find is
[41:59] people like Judas that'll put down what
[42:00] you're doing for God because they want
[42:02] it for something else of their own of
[42:04] their own desires and they all way of
[42:05] doing it but whatever you take up and
[42:08] give to God that's between you and him
[42:10] whatever you lay down for him that's
[42:11] between you and him whatever it might be
[42:13] whatever Ministry you might have
[42:15] whatever gift you might give of yourself
[42:17] whatever it might be that's between you
[42:19] and God and as long as it's not off the
[42:21] word it's not of my business it's none
[42:23] of your business if you're not the one
[42:24] doing it amen it's between awesome
[42:26] between God and you notice with Mary I
[42:29] looked it up they said that this would
[42:30] have cost her about a Year's
[42:33] wages typical person in Canada today
[42:35] makes about $65,000 a year can you
[42:38] imagine spending
[42:40] $65,000 to anoint the Master's feet now
[42:44] you can see why Judas made have had
[42:46] might have had something to talk about
[42:48] 65,000 and you poured
[42:51] $65,000 over the Master's feet you know
[42:54] people will look at what we have and
[42:56] what we do with it I've dealt with
[42:59] people and some people approach it with
[43:00] Thanksgiving and some people approach it
[43:02] with incredulity in incred incredulous
[43:06] they're
[43:08] incredulous I speak good
[43:12] words some people have talked to me and
[43:14] they said John you could do so much more
[43:16] in the world you could be in business
[43:18] you could be in management you could be
[43:20] running a company you could be doing so
[43:22] much more and they don't understand why
[43:23] you give it up I've got co-workers that
[43:25] say you shouldn't have been you
[43:26] shouldn't have come and done what you're
[43:27] doing now you should have stayed where
[43:29] you were you make so much more money you
[43:31] go so much further and then you know
[43:33] what I had a I had somebody come to me
[43:35] and said thank you somebody I work with
[43:38] a client in fact and they said thank you
[43:41] because I know what you could be doing
[43:44] and you chose to do what you're doing to
[43:45] help other
[43:47] people see you can look at it two
[43:49] different ways but my sacrifice I needed
[43:53] a job this is My Sacrifice this is my
[43:57] Ministry this is what matters more to me
[43:58] what I do in my my my professional life
[44:00] if we want to put that way it matters
[44:02] nothing to me at this point literally
[44:03] matters nothing to me I just needed a
[44:05] job but I understand also that I could
[44:07] have done it differently perhaps if the
[44:09] Lord would have opened the door amen but
[44:11] we look at those things and people can
[44:13] say you have so much intelligence you
[44:16] have great looks you have great Charisma
[44:17] you have a I'm not talking about me I'm
[44:19] talking clearly I'm not talking about me
[44:22] I have good
[44:23] words I can't even say incred
[44:26] incredulous
[44:27] incredulity there we go incredulity I
[44:30] can't even say that but people can look
[44:32] at you and whether you have a a gift or
[44:35] a skill or or your athletic or whatever
[44:37] it might be they can say you can go so
[44:39] far with that and yet so many times what
[44:42] do we do we lay it down because it's a
[44:44] sacrifice to our Lord and savior amen or
[44:47] if we do pick it up it's because he
[44:49] picks us up and he'll use it and he'll
[44:52] use it for something of his own good
[44:54] amen but people like Judas will stand on
[44:56] the side L and say you go too far you
[44:59] cannot go too far for somebody who gave
[45:00] his life for you that laid down
[45:02] everything he had he came from the
[45:04] portals of Glory laid down everything
[45:06] and took our place so we could take his
[45:08] place amen there's nothing that we could
[45:10] do that would be too much but you
[45:11] continue on in John 12 and Jesus is
[45:13] talking with the disciples and and a
[45:15] voice comes out of heaven and it
[45:17] identifies him and says I'm going to
[45:19] glorify you and some heard it as Thunder
[45:22] some heard it as a voice and Jesus says
[45:24] that voice wasn't for me it was for you
[45:26] well what happened here was for you and
[45:28] then he tells him he's going to die soon
[45:30] and then he says these words and we're
[45:31] speaking tonight on the spirit of Truth
[45:33] he says then Jesus said unto them yet a
[45:36] little while is the light with you walk
[45:39] while ye have the light lest Darkness
[45:41] come upon you for he that walketh in
[45:44] darkness knoweth not whether he
[45:46] goes while ye have light believe in the
[45:50] light that ye may be the children of
[45:52] light these things spake Jesus and
[45:54] departed and did hide himself from them
[45:56] the last word he said to the crowd was
[45:58] stay with the light but I want you to
[46:01] jump back previously in in John chapter
[46:03] 8 because Jesus had identified the light
[46:06] he said walk while you have the light
[46:08] and in John 8 he said then spake Jesus
[46:10] again unto them saying I am the light of
[46:12] the world he that followeth me shall not
[46:15] walk in darkness but shall have the
[46:17] light of light Jesus is saying stay with
[46:20] me whatever you do stay with me whether
[46:23] you understand it whether you don't
[46:25] understand it whether you can see what
[46:26] what's coming whether you you're worried
[46:28] about what's coming it doesn't matter
[46:30] he's saying stay with me no matter what
[46:33] I do no matter what I say stay with me
[46:35] cuz I'm the only light you're going to
[46:36] get I'm the only light you're going to
[46:38] have amen and he's saying if you stay
[46:40] with me and listen to me and receive
[46:42] what I say and receive who I am you'll
[46:44] become children of light you'll have the
[46:46] light of life in you as
[46:47] well why because if they'll stay with
[46:50] him the light will go from him to
[46:52] them see so many people want Christ but
[46:56] they want the person
[46:57] outside of them but he's saying no no no
[46:59] you've got to have The Light Within you
[47:01] you've got to become children of light
[47:02] amen it won't be something that just
[47:04] they can go up and talk to in the here
[47:06] and then it goes away but it'll be
[47:08] something that'll be with them all the
[47:09] time he's trying to make a transition
[47:12] here you know he's talking about the the
[47:14] children of light he said walk while
[47:16] while you have the light believe in the
[47:17] light that you may be the children of
[47:19] light what makes you a children Child of
[47:21] Light well what makes me a child of
[47:23] Lanny and Sandy klet it's because I have
[47:27] a portion of Lanny inside of me and I
[47:29] have a portion of Sandy inside of me
[47:30] that's what makes me the child of Lanny
[47:32] and Sandy klette if you're a child of
[47:34] Life what does that mean you are it
[47:36] means you have Light Within you it's the
[47:37] only way you can be a Child of Light is
[47:39] if there is light within you and that's
[47:41] what he's saying is this has to make a
[47:42] transition from being with you to being
[47:44] in you and we talked about this in the
[47:46] past few services but I want to take us
[47:49] back even further in the Book of John to
[47:51] John chapter 1 because we'll see that
[47:54] this light didn't just start at
[47:55] Pentecost too many times we're looking
[47:57] at what happened on the day of Pentecost
[47:59] in that upper room but when we look at
[48:01] the light and we look at the life that
[48:02] dwells in Us by the holy spirit this is
[48:05] something that was way before Pentecost
[48:07] because if you can't see past Pentecost
[48:09] then there's a problem because you can't
[48:11] come to Pentecost unless you were with
[48:13] them before Pentecost ever happened and
[48:15] in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was
[48:18] the word the word was with God and the
[48:21] Word was God and we we preached on this
[48:23] in many services previously he says the
[48:25] same was in the beginning with With God
[48:28] all things were made by him and without
[48:30] him was not anything made that was made
[48:32] now catch this it's speaking of him the
[48:35] word the person it says in him was life
[48:39] and the life was the light of men amen
[48:43] so what is the life it's the word but
[48:47] it's not just the word but it's the
[48:48] Living Word and we see it says that it's
[48:51] the light of men it's the life of men
[48:52] it's all the Living Word it's not just
[48:55] theology it's not just doct it's not
[48:57] just church attendance it's not just
[48:59] water baptism it's not books and tapes
[49:01] but it's the living word amen that makes
[49:03] you live in light that's the only way
[49:06] it's going to work you can be around a
[49:07] lot of light but as soon as you walk
[49:09] away you don't have anything it's got to
[49:10] be something inside of you amen it is a
[49:14] Doctrine it is a theology that's all a
[49:15] part of it going to church and these
[49:17] things but what makes it life is that
[49:19] it's alive it's not the words that it
[49:22] says it's the life behind the words amen
[49:24] the word has a life inside itself and
[49:26] John 1 takes us back to the beginning
[49:29] and says everything that's got Life
[49:30] Today Is Alive because of the word the
[49:33] word is our source of light amen it's
[49:35] life and light it's supposed to produce
[49:38] life amen we know that the word of God
[49:40] is the plans of God it's the thoughts of
[49:42] God it's the very attributes and family
[49:44] of God and it's not a thing that's the
[49:47] problem is people look at it and say
[49:49] this is the word that's not what John 1
[49:52] says it doesn't say the word is a thing
[49:53] it says the word is a himy it's a person
[49:57] it's a life amen it's the person of the
[49:59] word of God it's the light and the life
[50:01] of that word remember what Jesus would
[50:03] say later in John 6 he said it's the
[50:06] spirit that quickeneth he says the flesh
[50:09] profits nothing it's the it's the spirit
[50:11] that makes something alive he said the
[50:13] words that I speak unto you they are two
[50:16] things they are spirit and they are life
[50:19] so in other words it's not just theology
[50:21] it's not just Doctrine it's not just
[50:23] knowledge it's not just understanding
[50:25] that this word brings but he says it's
[50:27] spirit and it's life it's something that
[50:30] brings life to you it's something that
[50:33] makes you live it takes you out of death
[50:36] and it brings you into life amen Jesus
[50:39] had just preached his his famous service
[50:42] where he said that I am the bread of
[50:44] life and then he said those crazy words
[50:48] that he said if unless you eat my flesh
[50:51] and drink my blood you can't have
[50:53] everlasting life and he never explained
[50:55] it
[50:57] now we know what he meant because he
[50:58] said this is it's my body and what is
[51:00] his body it's the word he says You' got
[51:02] to take all of the word you can't take
[51:04] just a part of it but you got to take
[51:05] all of it amen but if he had preached
[51:08] that my words are spirit and life after
[51:10] he had fed the 5,000 and multiplied the
[51:12] bread and the fishes he'd have got a
[51:14] standing ovation when he said my words
[51:16] are spirit and life they' have said
[51:17] Hallelujah yes we see it we see it but
[51:19] that's not what he was talking about
[51:22] that's not what he was talking about but
[51:24] he just preached something that went
[51:26] completely over their heads and he says
[51:28] what I'm preaching to you is spirit and
[51:30] it's life why was he saying this church
[51:34] cuz he was drawing a dividing line
[51:36] between why they were there because
[51:38] there was an awful lot of people that
[51:39] were sitting under the preaching of the
[51:41] word for what it would give them rather
[51:43] than how it would change them everyone
[51:46] wanted to be around for the signs and
[51:47] the Wonders the multiplying of the bread
[51:49] and the fish the the healing of people
[51:52] the casting out of demons and all these
[51:54] Supernatural signs and wonders but how
[51:56] many people were there for the word of
[51:58] God that was a dividing line and after
[52:01] he preaches these and he says these
[52:03] words that I'm speaking to you right
[52:04] here that none of you understand he says
[52:06] there spirit in their life and what
[52:08] happened the scripture says from that
[52:10] day on many walked not with them they
[52:12] left him because they didn't understand
[52:14] they hadn't caught the revelation of who
[52:16] it was who it was that was standing
[52:18] there and when the miracle stopped they
[52:20] left when he stopped giving them food
[52:22] the M then they left when he stopped
[52:24] healing they left but there was people
[52:26] that stuck around that stuck around even
[52:29] though you notice that it's not the
[52:31] signs and wonders that catches the True
[52:35] Believer it's the
[52:37] word you'll notice some of the greatest
[52:40] miracles in scripture happen to people
[52:42] purely by the word of God when that
[52:44] woman came to the well that day outside
[52:47] of Samaria he didn't do a single sign or
[52:51] wonder with her the way that he did with
[52:53] everyone else what caught her was the
[52:55] word cuz she identified what he was
[52:58] doing by the word of God not some great
[53:01] casting out of demons not producing
[53:03] something out of thin air not
[53:04] multiplying anything but he spoke to her
[53:07] in a way that she caught and she says
[53:09] when Messiah comes he'll tell us what
[53:11] you're telling us what was it his words
[53:14] that caught her it's amazing that you
[53:17] can listen to the word tonight and it
[53:20] does something for you and somebody else
[53:22] can sit here and it does absolutely
[53:23] nothing for them the exact same word and
[53:26] it's alive for some and it's dead for
[53:28] others why cuz some people are children
[53:31] of light and some people are children of
[53:33] darkness and guess what you might be a
[53:35] Child of Light and not even realize it
[53:37] right now and you could also be God
[53:39] forbid a child of darkness and not not
[53:41] realize it right now amen but there's
[53:45] only one way to tell and it's what the
[53:46] word does to you that'll tell you who
[53:49] you are
[53:50] amen if you're a child of Darkness the
[53:52] word of God doesn't do anything for you
[53:54] there's nothing in there to respond to
[53:56] it it there's nothing in there that says
[53:58] that's for me but if you're a Child of
[54:01] Light then there's something about the
[54:02] word when it's anointed to your heart
[54:04] that you say that's me even though I
[54:05] don't understand it all I'm not too sure
[54:08] about all of that but there's something
[54:09] in it that's drawing me to it amen some
[54:12] people all you need to do is preach it a
[54:13] certain way and what are they drawn to
[54:16] they're not drawn to the word they're
[54:17] drawn to the style of the word they're
[54:19] drawn to the spin they're drawn to the
[54:20] the activity that's up here the shouting
[54:22] and the whatever it might be but if
[54:25] you're a child of God you love the word
[54:27] no matter what you know we've had some
[54:28] pretty different ministers come through
[54:30] here haven't we we've had some that were
[54:32] just so calm and quiet and we've got
[54:35] some the building can barely contain and
[54:36] guess what we love them all why because
[54:38] the word's coming forth and it's
[54:40] anointed by the holy spirit
[54:42] amen we love the word no matter what why
[54:44] cuz that's what's taken us through
[54:46] that's what's taken us through am me the
[54:47] word's home to us isn't it isn't the
[54:50] word home to us I remember I mean I was
[54:51] under conviction under brother J's
[54:53] preaching from the age of 10 years old
[54:55] and I never gave my heart to the Lord
[54:56] until I was 17 but yet there was
[54:59] something about it that Drew me to it
[55:01] even when I didn't want
[55:02] it even when I didn't want it I wanted
[55:05] to go out as I've said before I wanted
[55:07] to become a doctor and buy a Porsche
[55:09] have a nice house and have wonderful
[55:12] things that's what I wanted but there
[55:14] was something there that kept pulling me
[55:16] why cuz I was a child of God and a child
[55:20] of God is drawn to the word no matter
[55:22] what sometimes it gets pushed down deep
[55:24] sometimes it gets dimmed some times the
[55:27] the volume might get turned down but
[55:29] there's always something that kept
[55:30] calling me back to it and I praise the
[55:32] Lord for that that's why I'm here
[55:33] tonight is because there was something
[55:35] inside of me to respond to the word Amen
[55:38] brother BR would say this he says a Son
[55:40] of God can go a long time before he
[55:42] recognizes that he's a son in fact a lot
[55:45] of true Christians are like the story of
[55:47] that baby eagle that was hatched out
[55:49] from under a hand he says you know that
[55:51] the eagle is a type of the True Believer
[55:54] but a farmer took an egg from an eagle's
[55:55] nest and placed it under a hen in due
[55:58] time all the eggs under the hen hatched
[56:00] out the baby chicks got along fine with
[56:02] the mother hen but that little Eagle
[56:04] could not figure out the clucking and
[56:06] scratching for food in the manure pile
[56:09] he says he managed to make a living but
[56:11] he was pretty confused about it all can
[56:14] you imagine an eagle walking around in a
[56:16] barnyard trying to live trying to grow
[56:19] trying to
[56:20] mature he says but one day from way up
[56:22] in the air that mother Eagle that had
[56:25] laid the eggs spy that little Eagle on
[56:27] the ground and she swooped down with
[56:29] tremendous speed and screamed at the top
[56:31] of her voice for him to fly up and meet
[56:34] her it says he had never heard an eagled
[56:37] cry he had never heard the word before
[56:40] but when he heard that first scream
[56:42] something in him stirred and he longed
[56:45] to launch out towards it it says but he
[56:49] was afraid to
[56:51] try that's what held me back was I was
[56:53] scared I wouldn't like being a Christian
[56:56] miserable being a non-Christian and not
[56:58] knowing if I was going to like being a
[57:01] Christian he says again that mother
[57:03] screamed for him to arise in the wind
[57:05] and follow her he screamed back that he
[57:08] was afraid and once more she called out
[57:10] screaming that he Tred beating his wings
[57:13] he hurled himself into the air answering
[57:16] the Cry of his mother he soared off into
[57:19] the blue
[57:20] skies he says you see he always was an
[57:24] eagle now catch this he acted like a
[57:27] chicken for a little while but he could
[57:30] not be satisfied amen you I was talking
[57:33] to some some some believing friends of
[57:36] mine back in Alberta one time and you
[57:38] know they were young men and they had
[57:40] many of them they had they had left the
[57:42] church and they had they had stopped
[57:44] believing and there were like four or
[57:46] five of them and they were gathered in a
[57:48] bar drinking alcohol and one of them
[57:51] looked around and he says you know what
[57:53] we are he says we're a bunch of idiots
[57:56] and losers because none of us likes what
[57:59] we're doing we know better and we're
[58:01] sitting here trying to pretend that we
[58:02] belong here and you know what he did he
[58:04] went back and he gave his heart to the
[58:06] Lord and he's serving him today why he
[58:08] was acting like an
[58:10] unbeliever and saying I don't like this
[58:14] and you guys don't either why don't we
[58:16] just fess up and realize we're children
[58:19] of God and go back to serving God and
[58:21] guess what eventually every single one
[58:23] of them
[58:24] did praise the Lord
[58:26] lord well we can act like it sometimes
[58:30] this flesh may get the better of us but
[58:32] it won't satisfy us until we're back in
[58:35] our position where we're supposed to be
[58:38] he says but when he heard the Cry Of The
[58:40] Great Eagle he came to his own place and
[58:43] once a true Son of God hears the Cry of
[58:46] the spirit how by the word he too will
[58:49] realize who he is and run to the great
[58:52] prophet eagle and be with him forever
[58:55] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[58:57] Jesus what is it that's happening when
[59:00] you hear the word you're hearing from
[59:02] eternity you're hearing from your origin
[59:05] you're hearing from your Source you're
[59:06] hearing from your life and there's
[59:09] nothing that can make you respond that
[59:11] way except the word of God listen we can
[59:14] have a good time at a hockey game we can
[59:16] have a good time running around in race
[59:19] cars we can have a good time playing
[59:21] baseball or whatever it might be but for
[59:23] the believer there's nothing like the
[59:25] presence of God coming through his word
[59:28] amen I can't tell you I've had some
[59:30] wonderful times in my hobbies but boy
[59:32] I'll tell you when you're in the
[59:34] presence of God Nothing Compares Nothing
[59:36] Compares and you would never ever ever
[59:40] want to leave that I remember sitting in
[59:44] a service one time and the presence of
[59:46] God had dropped down so supernaturally I
[59:50] couldn't stand and I was just sitting
[59:51] there and it was just like wave after
[59:54] wave and just it was so warm it was so
[59:58] powerful it was so humbling but it was
[1:00:02] so perfect and it only lasted for about
[1:00:05] 3 or 4 minutes and I felt that starting
[1:00:07] to leave and I said don't go don't go
[1:00:11] don't leave me like
[1:00:14] this and he came back down and he stayed
[1:00:16] another L little bit and then it moved
[1:00:19] on it's the most beautiful thing you can
[1:00:22] have is when you recognize the presence
[1:00:24] of God in your midst
[1:00:28] Hallelujah that's available to every
[1:00:31] believer this evening that you can know
[1:00:34] that he's with you that you can know
[1:00:36] that he's in you that you can know that
[1:00:38] he cares about
[1:00:41] you that he could come down and let you
[1:00:44] know I'm right here
[1:00:50] tonight sometimes we get pulled away
[1:00:52] don't
[1:00:53] we sometimes we get pulled away
[1:00:56] sometimes this flesh pulls us away
[1:00:58] sometimes our needs sometimes
[1:01:00] circumstances sometimes pressure and we
[1:01:03] get down a a path or a road in life and
[1:01:06] all of a sudden we realize we're driving
[1:01:08] blind anyone ever had their lights go
[1:01:10] out in their car at night sometimes you
[1:01:13] you you you you flick the switch by
[1:01:15] mistake somehow and all of a sudden
[1:01:18] you're driving in darkness it's one of
[1:01:20] the scariest things and sometimes we're
[1:01:23] doing that through life and we're just
[1:01:24] barreling through and then we we realize
[1:01:26] oh my goodness I don't know what's
[1:01:27] coming up what does a Believer do they
[1:01:31] go to the word cuz that'll turn the
[1:01:33] lights on it'll let you see where you
[1:01:36] are it may mean you're okay like I've
[1:01:39] said before when God points me in a
[1:01:41] direction I go until he tells me
[1:01:44] otherwise but the word tells me if I'm
[1:01:47] still headed in the right direction it
[1:01:49] puts a light in front of me and then we
[1:01:51] know the scripture in Psalms by heart
[1:01:52] I'm sure it says Thy word is a lamp unto
[1:01:55] my feet
[1:01:56] and a light unto my path that means if I
[1:01:59] compare what's around me with the word
[1:02:01] then I ought to know whether I'm with
[1:02:02] the word or not amen I got to know I'm
[1:02:04] with the will of God Amen and if it
[1:02:06] lines up with the word then we can move
[1:02:08] forward in confidence you know I've
[1:02:10] noticed this in my own life sometimes
[1:02:12] God blesses us with something and it's
[1:02:14] genuinely from him and then what does
[1:02:16] Satan try to do church he tries to come
[1:02:18] in on the coattails of that blessing and
[1:02:20] get you to turn it into an
[1:02:22] idol you brothers that own businesses
[1:02:25] know what I'm talking about where God
[1:02:27] you can take that and God has provided
[1:02:28] for you and God has given you what you
[1:02:30] have need of and all of a sudden you're
[1:02:32] turning it into something that he never
[1:02:33] intended it to
[1:02:36] be many of us have had good
[1:02:39] careers and you can you can get attached
[1:02:42] to that career rather than the will of
[1:02:44] God and it can take you places you don't
[1:02:46] need to go
[1:02:48] amen but we need that word to keep us in
[1:02:51] Balance day by day and it keeps us
[1:02:54] focused and it puts a light in front of
[1:02:55] us us and it keeps us from going too far
[1:02:57] and realizing we're completely off the
[1:02:59] path amen because the minute we lose the
[1:03:01] word we lose our leadership we lose our
[1:03:03] light we lose our guide and then we lose
[1:03:06] our confidence amen that's why we listen
[1:03:09] to the word of God constantly we read it
[1:03:12] we listen to it we come to church we
[1:03:15] play tapes we listen to other whatever
[1:03:17] that might be why because the only way I
[1:03:19] can see clear is by the word of God I
[1:03:21] can talk all day long about I have how I
[1:03:23] have the Holy Spirit to lead and guide
[1:03:25] me but he does it through this he always
[1:03:27] points me back to this amen that's the
[1:03:30] way that he works amen and it's amazing
[1:03:32] how we can look today talking with some
[1:03:34] people about this recently how we can
[1:03:36] look at everything that's going on in
[1:03:38] the world today and we can find it in
[1:03:40] the word of God we can look at politics
[1:03:42] we can look at it exactly in the word
[1:03:44] for this day and see where it is we can
[1:03:46] look at the financial systems we can
[1:03:48] look at the economy we can look at
[1:03:50] Society we can look at what they value
[1:03:52] what they're promoting what they're
[1:03:53] turning down and we can take it we can
[1:03:56] go exactly back to the word of God and
[1:03:57] say that's what it says it was going to
[1:03:59] be like at this time it's there it shows
[1:04:02] us a light it shows us exactly where we
[1:04:05] at and I found the thing is that if I
[1:04:07] spend time with the word I wonder less
[1:04:09] and less about my
[1:04:11] days the more time you're in the word of
[1:04:14] God the more you hear it the more you
[1:04:15] read it the more you're in it all of a
[1:04:17] sudden other things start to go away
[1:04:20] what is it doing it's bringing light to
[1:04:21] the situation it's burning away the fog
[1:04:24] yo you listen to a really smart person
[1:04:26] for a while they can get your theology
[1:04:28] pretty twisted up but if you are in the
[1:04:30] word on a regular basis then it'll cut
[1:04:32] through all of that and it'll show you
[1:04:34] the truth of the situation it'll show
[1:04:36] you the truth of the matter amen and
[1:04:37] you'll find that your discernment is
[1:04:39] sharpened your understanding sharpened
[1:04:41] your motives and objectives are
[1:04:42] clarified you start to walk more cleanly
[1:04:45] why because that word is changing you
[1:04:47] when you're feeding on it when you're
[1:04:49] listening to it when you're putting time
[1:04:50] into it it's changing you from what you
[1:04:52] were into what you ought to be on a
[1:04:54] daily basis it's growing and maturing us
[1:04:57] the word is not just
[1:05:00] information it's not just facts amen but
[1:05:03] it's life it's got a life behind it amen
[1:05:06] it's light Jesus said stick with me and
[1:05:08] you'll be children of light why cuz he
[1:05:11] was the word made flesh and he wanted
[1:05:12] more to be the word made flesh and it
[1:05:14] was going to take the light of the holy
[1:05:16] spirit amen and if they heard that word
[1:05:18] if they received the word if they
[1:05:19] believed it and acted on it it was going
[1:05:21] to bring them to a day of Pentecost
[1:05:22] where that life would come inside of
[1:05:24] them pet Peter knew it
[1:05:26] Peter didn't know everything but he knew
[1:05:29] that that was one to stick with remember
[1:05:31] after that sermon he preached on on You
[1:05:33] Must Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and
[1:05:35] it sounded like he was talking about
[1:05:36] being a a vampire or or or uh somebody
[1:05:41] that that that eats humans a
[1:05:43] cannibal Peter knew that it that
[1:05:45] couldn't be what he was talking about
[1:05:47] but he still didn't understand it but
[1:05:48] yet at the end of that sermon everybody
[1:05:50] else is walking away and Jesus looks at
[1:05:53] him and he says what are you going to do
[1:05:55] what did Peter say he says Lord to whom
[1:05:57] shall we go nobody else has anything for
[1:06:00] me he says Thou Hast the words of
[1:06:03] eternal life Jesus said if you do what I
[1:06:06] say you'll have eternal life he says
[1:06:07] you've told us it's good for eternal
[1:06:09] life I'm going to stick with
[1:06:10] you so we see here that that that that
[1:06:13] life and that light go in hand that says
[1:06:15] in the beginning was the word it says
[1:06:17] that word was
[1:06:18] light and that light life and that life
[1:06:21] was the light of men so the life and the
[1:06:24] light are going together you can't have
[1:06:26] full life without light it t it takes
[1:06:28] light to make a seed grow as the light
[1:06:30] varies as the seasons change you'll see
[1:06:32] that life goes up and down we're coming
[1:06:35] unfortunately into winter and what's
[1:06:36] happening the life is going out as the
[1:06:38] light shortens throughout the days life
[1:06:40] goes out and it goes back into the
[1:06:42] ground for so many things but then as
[1:06:44] the light starts to come back then what
[1:06:46] happens light comes with the light
[1:06:49] amen but Jesus was drawing a line of
[1:06:52] Distinction here between those that
[1:06:53] thought they were children of light and
[1:06:56] those that were actually children of
[1:06:58] light and in John 12 Jesus he finishes
[1:07:02] up with the triumphal entry into
[1:07:03] Jerusalem and then he's having
[1:07:05] conversations with people and he goes
[1:07:07] into the upper room with all 12 of his
[1:07:09] disciples and they're eating the
[1:07:11] Passover and he's washing the disciples
[1:07:13] feet every single one of them got their
[1:07:15] feet washed even Judas even Judas got
[1:07:18] his feet washed the man that would
[1:07:19] betrayed Jesus got his feet washed you
[1:07:22] know what that tells me it tells me you
[1:07:24] can come right up to it and not be a
[1:07:27] child of God Judas had a sanctification
[1:07:29] experience if we could put it that way
[1:07:32] but that didn't mean everything amen A
[1:07:35] Life That's cleaned up that's not the
[1:07:37] new birth that shows God's working but
[1:07:40] that's not necessarily the New Birth the
[1:07:42] new birth is when the person of God
[1:07:43] comes to live inside of you he's got to
[1:07:46] clean you up before he can come in you
[1:07:47] that's a sanctification work it means
[1:07:49] God's working in your life but the
[1:07:51] Finish is not sanctification it's to
[1:07:53] have the Holy Spirit living inside of us
[1:07:55] amen CU Judas ran all the way up to
[1:07:57] sanctification but after that washing of
[1:07:59] feet Jesus starts to talk to them and he
[1:08:01] says hey one of you is going to betray
[1:08:03] me and everyone's like well is it me is
[1:08:04] it me and Judas says is it I and Jesus
[1:08:07] says yes it's you and he lets Judas know
[1:08:10] that he knows what he's going to do and
[1:08:11] then as soon as Judas leaves then J
[1:08:14] Jesus really starts to open up after
[1:08:17] Judas leaves is when the word really
[1:08:18] starts to be opened up to them why cuz
[1:08:21] Judas couldn't hear it Judas was not a
[1:08:23] Child of Light he was a child of
[1:08:25] Darkness amen and then we come to our
[1:08:28] opening scripture in John 14 and Jesus
[1:08:31] is really opening up now he's letting
[1:08:32] them see what's coming he's showing them
[1:08:34] how the Redemption plan's going to work
[1:08:36] and he's talking about the transition of
[1:08:38] the dwelling place of God from A Man
[1:08:40] Called Jesus Christ into a multimember
[1:08:43] body of the Bride of Jesus Christ and he
[1:08:45] says in John 4:12 he says verily verily
[1:08:48] I say unto you he that believeth on me
[1:08:51] the works that I do shall he do also and
[1:08:54] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:08:57] because I go to my father now we said
[1:08:59] before greater doesn't mean that they're
[1:09:00] greater in magnitude it means they'll be
[1:09:02] greater in number CU Jesus was only
[1:09:05] doing things for three and a half years
[1:09:06] now through 2,000 years he's got
[1:09:08] hundreds and thousands of people working
[1:09:10] in his name and with his spirit and so
[1:09:12] it's they were going to do more than he
[1:09:14] was in terms of numers numbers but watch
[1:09:17] what he says here he says you're going
[1:09:18] to have a continuation of my
[1:09:20] Ministry that's how he starts out as he
[1:09:23] tells us what our heritage is he tells
[1:09:25] us what our inheritance is he tells us
[1:09:27] what our position is and it's to
[1:09:28] continue his
[1:09:30] work then he says now what what a thing
[1:09:33] to say verse 13 whatsoever you shall ask
[1:09:36] in my name that will I do that the
[1:09:40] father may be glorified in the Sun so
[1:09:42] this is speaking of authority in the
[1:09:43] name of Jesus Christ then he says if you
[1:09:46] shall ask anything in my name I will do
[1:09:50] it now we have to remember we have to
[1:09:52] take this through the whole filter of
[1:09:54] scripture because this is not
[1:09:57] Authority by personal will it's
[1:10:00] Authority by
[1:10:02] relationship amen it requires Unity for
[1:10:05] this to work because remember what John
[1:10:07] would say later I think in first or 2
[1:10:09] John he says if we ask anything
[1:10:10] according to his will he heareth us and
[1:10:13] we know that if he heareth us he's going
[1:10:15] to do it amen this is by unity with
[1:10:18] Christ that you can speak and receive
[1:10:21] this is not a a a k blanch as they would
[1:10:23] say to go out and just start speaking
[1:10:25] things that's false
[1:10:28] Doctrine cuz we never saw Christ himself
[1:10:30] doing that he said I only say what the
[1:10:32] father says and if you got the same
[1:10:34] Spirit then you'll have the same unity
[1:10:36] and you'll have the same
[1:10:38] surrender he says if you love me keep my
[1:10:41] Commandments how simple a test is
[1:10:44] that he didn't say keep most of them he
[1:10:47] said keep all of
[1:10:49] them and then he says I will pray the
[1:10:51] father and he shall give you another
[1:10:53] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:10:54] forever we're going to preach on the
[1:10:56] comforter in the later service but what
[1:10:58] is this comforter he says it's even the
[1:11:00] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:11:05] receive he says because it seeth him not
[1:11:08] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:11:10] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:11:13] we know what that is it's Christ that is
[1:11:14] in the form of the holy spirit amen and
[1:11:16] now he's saying here there's a
[1:11:18] distinction being drawn and the dis and
[1:11:20] the dividing line is the spirit of Truth
[1:11:23] he says the spirit of Truth is for you
[1:11:25] he says and the world cannot receive it
[1:11:28] the world cannot receive the holy spirit
[1:11:30] it's impossible for them to do it why he
[1:11:34] says because they can't see it they
[1:11:37] can't hear it they can't receive it
[1:11:39] there's nothing in them that recognizes
[1:11:41] what it is there's no resonance there's
[1:11:43] no attraction to the word when it comes
[1:11:45] their way but for the children of God
[1:11:48] they can receive him not only can they
[1:11:50] receive him they will receive him amen
[1:11:53] they're ordained to do it they see him
[1:11:55] they know him that's the literal
[1:11:56] identification of a true child of God is
[1:11:59] that they can receive the holy spirit
[1:12:01] amen why because there's something in
[1:12:04] them that they can hear it they can
[1:12:06] receive it they can believe it they can
[1:12:08] accept it they can apply it they can
[1:12:10] surrender to it they can hold to it and
[1:12:12] then what happens is the word is Made
[1:12:14] Alive in them by the Holy Spirit that's
[1:12:16] what happens nobody else can receive the
[1:12:18] holy spirit in their soul except a child
[1:12:20] of God it's impossible Jesus said they
[1:12:22] cannot do it why cuz they're not a part
[1:12:24] of it they never were a part of it
[1:12:26] therefore they cannot be a part of it
[1:12:28] amen they aren't in the word they
[1:12:29] weren't a part of the word and so they
[1:12:30] can't be anything as it comes to
[1:12:33] relationship to God that's why Judas
[1:12:35] couldn't stick around and hear this it
[1:12:37] wasn't for him he had no part of it
[1:12:39] because he was too busy doing what he
[1:12:40] wanted to do and that's the way the
[1:12:42] world is today is they're just trying to
[1:12:44] do what they want to do rather than what
[1:12:46] the world says what rather what the word
[1:12:48] says amen he even stuck it through the
[1:12:50] foot washing he stuck it through all the
[1:12:53] signs and wonders but when it came time
[1:12:55] for the spirit of Truth he couldn't
[1:12:56] handle that he couldn't handle that
[1:12:58] anymore and he left before Jesus even
[1:12:59] opened up about it why he wasn't a Child
[1:13:02] of Light scripture says that Judas was
[1:13:04] not just a child of Darkness it says he
[1:13:06] was the son of
[1:13:08] predition Amen he's one of many he's a
[1:13:11] son of predition that word predition
[1:13:12] means destruction damnation waste and
[1:13:16] ruin so Judas was the son of Destruction
[1:13:18] and
[1:13:20] Damnation talk about a
[1:13:22] Heritage what a horrible place to be in
[1:13:25] amen and yet there's people like him all
[1:13:28] around the world all around this world
[1:13:31] and so many of them are doing exactly
[1:13:33] what he did which is sitting in
[1:13:35] church sitting in church and what
[1:13:38] happens is they hang around the word and
[1:13:40] they hang around the word and then
[1:13:42] something happens that they don't like
[1:13:44] and they walk away and what do they do
[1:13:46] they go to a word of their own making
[1:13:48] rather than the full word cuz the spirit
[1:13:51] of truth will take you all the way to
[1:13:52] the full word of God Amen what was Judas
[1:13:55] weakness
[1:13:56] money Judas wanted the money and so in
[1:13:59] the end when the money was spent in a
[1:14:01] way that he didn't like and he was a
[1:14:03] thief and that caused him to pull away
[1:14:05] some people pull away when they lose
[1:14:07] influence some people pull away when the
[1:14:09] minister says something they don't like
[1:14:11] or he offends them some people pull away
[1:14:14] when they lose their position some
[1:14:17] people pull away because of the way the
[1:14:18] pastor preaches it can be all sorts of
[1:14:21] things sometimes they get hurt by the
[1:14:23] Believers in the congregation whatever
[1:14:25] it might be but one thing is is that
[1:14:27] they end up following their own ideas
[1:14:29] they have their own goals they have
[1:14:30] their own purposes and the thing that's
[1:14:32] common to every single one of them is
[1:14:34] they walk away from the word they don't
[1:14:37] think they do but that's exactly what
[1:14:39] happens amen the effect is always that
[1:14:41] they walk away from Christ the word I
[1:14:43] know many people that left the message
[1:14:44] 10 years ago personally friends to some
[1:14:47] of them related to others but to a
[1:14:50] person every single one of them today
[1:14:52] has walked away from the word of God you
[1:14:54] know you know what some said when they
[1:14:55] left we're going back to Christ that's
[1:14:59] what they said we're going back to Jesus
[1:15:01] see what they thought was that he was he
[1:15:04] was the person of their emotions and
[1:15:06] their feelings and their good intentions
[1:15:09] and he's not he's the person of the word
[1:15:11] and when you leave the word you leave
[1:15:12] Christ you can say I'm going to church
[1:15:15] you can say that I believe this and I
[1:15:16] love this and I love God and I no no no
[1:15:19] if you leave the word you've left Christ
[1:15:22] amen he identifies himself as Christ the
[1:15:25] word and every single one of them has
[1:15:27] gone down a path of unrighteousness
[1:15:29] today some of them religious
[1:15:31] unrighteousness but most of them have
[1:15:32] just Fallen away and gone back to
[1:15:34] exactly what the rest of the world is
[1:15:36] doing why scripture says it has to be
[1:15:39] that way there's a bride being called
[1:15:42] out but the scripture says that day
[1:15:44] can't come except there be a great
[1:15:45] Falling Away first and you can't fall
[1:15:48] away unless you had something you can't
[1:15:50] fall away unless you climb some level
[1:15:53] some maybe only went to justification
[1:15:55] some might have went to sanctification
[1:15:56] some may have gone all the way to the
[1:15:58] gifts but they fell away from it and
[1:16:01] when they fall away they can't repent
[1:16:02] and bring themselves back because the
[1:16:04] scripture says they can't do that either
[1:16:05] because they'd Rec crucify Christ all
[1:16:07] over again these are not atheists these
[1:16:10] are not unbelievers we're talking about
[1:16:12] we're talking about people that profess
[1:16:13] to be Christians and yet what happens is
[1:16:16] by and by the word offends them and they
[1:16:19] walk away that's a leene condition isn't
[1:16:23] it all it is is
[1:16:26] self-deception all it is is
[1:16:28] self-deception and so they're sitting
[1:16:29] there and if you go read it in
[1:16:31] Revelation 3 about the latest Seasons it
[1:16:33] says you think you're rich and increase
[1:16:35] with goods and have need of
[1:16:37] nothing it says but know not that you're
[1:16:40] miserable wretched poor blind and naked
[1:16:43] they're self deceived they have no idea
[1:16:45] of their condition that's the greatest
[1:16:47] deception this world has is
[1:16:49] self-deception because you can't fix it
[1:16:51] cuz you don't even know it that's what
[1:16:53] self-deception is is you don't know know
[1:16:55] you've been fooled and it takes the word
[1:16:57] of God by the Holy Spirit to open your
[1:16:59] eyes that's the only thing that can take
[1:17:01] us out of self-deception because that's
[1:17:03] the leot toing condition they've got to
[1:17:05] hear what the spirit says that's the
[1:17:07] only way to get out of it but the thing
[1:17:09] I love about the word of God is that it
[1:17:11] always identifies us clearly it always
[1:17:14] identifies us listen if you're a Child
[1:17:16] of Light it identifies you and if you're
[1:17:17] a child of Darkness it identifies you
[1:17:19] just as well and it's always by the word
[1:17:22] of God Amen I don't believe I'm a I'm a
[1:17:24] child of God today because I sit in
[1:17:26] church and Nod my head and say amen
[1:17:28] that's good that's a part of it but I
[1:17:30] believe I'm a Child of God because my
[1:17:32] life lines up with the word I know what
[1:17:34] I used to be I know what I am I know how
[1:17:37] I used to be led I know how I'm LED now
[1:17:40] I know how I used to think I know how I
[1:17:41] think to now why because the word is
[1:17:43] living inside of me it's the Holy Spirit
[1:17:46] you I remember a story it might have
[1:17:47] been Joseph brandom or Billy Paul maybe
[1:17:51] that gave a book to a man and that man
[1:17:54] came back to him he said said I hate
[1:17:55] that book he says that man called me a
[1:17:58] buzzard and whoever this person was
[1:18:00] looked at him said I love that man
[1:18:01] because he called me an eagle same
[1:18:05] message but identified two completely
[1:18:07] different people didn't it one was a
[1:18:09] buzzard and one was an eagle amen it's
[1:18:11] the same word but it's identifying two
[1:18:13] groups children of light and Children Of
[1:18:16] Darkness amen and they're identified by
[1:18:18] the word they're not identified by what
[1:18:19] they say they are the word identifies
[1:18:21] them amen it's not me I don't get to say
[1:18:24] I'm a Child of God the word says I am
[1:18:26] and that's going to have the final say
[1:18:28] Amen but we've been tested by the word
[1:18:30] we know that and I believe we've been
[1:18:31] found faithful children of God are
[1:18:33] tested and tried by the word and the
[1:18:35] question is always will you stay with
[1:18:37] the word of God that's the only test
[1:18:39] there is for a Believer stay with the
[1:18:40] word or go your own way that's the only
[1:18:43] test whether it's finances whether it's
[1:18:45] relationships whether it's jobs whether
[1:18:47] it's moving whether it's staying whether
[1:18:49] it's going whether it's Ministry
[1:18:51] whatever it might be your leadership is
[1:18:53] will you stay with the word of God God
[1:18:55] or do your own thing and it's usually
[1:18:58] through a religious way of
[1:18:59] self-deception that we go our own way we
[1:19:02] try and bend the word to us rather than
[1:19:04] fit ourselves to the word It's usually
[1:19:06] the way it works amen but regardless of
[1:19:08] those circumstances we stay with the
[1:19:10] word I believe we do that I believe I'm
[1:19:12] looking at people today that stay with
[1:19:14] the word no matter what I've seen the
[1:19:15] decisions you've made I've seen the
[1:19:18] things you've done with your job I've
[1:19:19] seen the things you've done with your
[1:19:20] families I've seen the things you've
[1:19:22] done with your finances and your
[1:19:23] relationships and moving and staying as
[1:19:26] the case may be I see the sacrifices
[1:19:29] that some of you have made and there's
[1:19:31] many more you've made that I don't know
[1:19:33] and what is it it's showing that there's
[1:19:35] something inside of you that there's an
[1:19:36] anchor there's an anchor in your soul
[1:19:38] and it's always going to be by the word
[1:19:40] of God Paul would say this about the
[1:19:42] children of God he says but ye Brethren
[1:19:44] are not in darkness that that day should
[1:19:47] overtake you as a thief he's talking
[1:19:48] about the end of it all he's talking
[1:19:50] about the day of Our Lord now you got to
[1:19:52] remember there's a day of Our Lord for
[1:19:54] us us and there's a day of the Lord for
[1:19:56] them cuz the day of the Lord for the
[1:19:58] believer is the resurrection and the
[1:19:59] Rapture but the day of the Lord cuz
[1:20:01] that's when we see him but they see him
[1:20:03] when he comes back in
[1:20:05] judgment but he says you're not in
[1:20:07] darkness that that day should overtake
[1:20:08] you as a thief ye are all the children
[1:20:11] of light and the children of the day we
[1:20:14] are not of the night nor of Darkness he
[1:20:17] says therefore let us not sleep as
[1:20:19] others do but let us watch and be
[1:20:23] sober why are others sleeping cuz they
[1:20:26] have no worries they have no concerns
[1:20:29] they don't think anything's
[1:20:31] coming but he says we don't do that he
[1:20:33] says we stay
[1:20:34] sober he says and we are
[1:20:37] watching for they that sleep sleep in
[1:20:40] the night and they that be drunken are
[1:20:43] drunken in the night but let us who are
[1:20:45] of the day be sober putting on the
[1:20:48] breastplate of faith and love forign
[1:20:50] helmet the hope of Salvation he's saying
[1:20:52] buckle up there's a battle come in
[1:20:55] here don't get LAX don't get lazy don't
[1:21:00] stay
[1:21:01] home put on the full armor of God and
[1:21:05] then he says for God has not appointed
[1:21:07] us to wrath but to obtain salvation by
[1:21:10] our Lord Jesus Christ so if you're not
[1:21:12] appointed for wrath if you're not
[1:21:14] appointed for judgment you must be
[1:21:15] appointed for something else praise the
[1:21:17] Lord and then if judgment isn't for you
[1:21:20] it means that you're appointed for the
[1:21:21] opposite which is what Grace favor
[1:21:24] appointed for grace and favor this
[1:21:26] evening we spoke about it last service
[1:21:28] about how we're supposed to come boldly
[1:21:30] to the
[1:21:32] throne what of grace and mercy that's
[1:21:35] our appointment is for Mercy amen we're
[1:21:38] appointed for acceptance we're appointed
[1:21:40] for healing we're appointed to be
[1:21:42] welcomed into the presence of God our
[1:21:44] Salvation is secure amen from the
[1:21:46] foundation of the world and we see that
[1:21:49] that's what the holy spirit will do is
[1:21:51] it confirms to you who you are by the
[1:21:53] word of God that's what Paul's saying
[1:21:55] here he's saying you're children of
[1:21:56] light because you come from light and
[1:21:59] you're going back to light remember the
[1:22:01] first thing that was created was that
[1:22:03] Pillar of Fire in Genesis 1 uh 2 and 3 I
[1:22:06] think where it says he created light and
[1:22:09] what happened is God stepped into it and
[1:22:11] it was the word that's why John said in
[1:22:13] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:22:15] with God the Word was God and the Word
[1:22:17] was made what light and that light
[1:22:20] became
[1:22:21] life and every bit of us were in there
[1:22:24] there in that light in the beginning
[1:22:26] it's a part of the original body amen
[1:22:28] and that's why you are children of light
[1:22:30] is because you come from light your
[1:22:32] father is light that's the only thing
[1:22:34] that can make you you're a part of the
[1:22:36] word because you always were in the word
[1:22:39] and that's why you're going back to the
[1:22:41] fullness of the word in Christ amen but
[1:22:43] watch the progression now as as we're
[1:22:45] back to the upper room and on the night
[1:22:48] of the Passover and Jesus is talking
[1:22:50] with the disciples here and remember now
[1:22:52] he's with the elect he's with the chosen
[1:22:55] this is a selected group of men now
[1:22:57] Judas has gone on to do what he's got to
[1:22:59] do and he's talking to these people he's
[1:23:02] talking to the 11 remaining disciples
[1:23:05] and he's saying nevertheless I tell you
[1:23:07] the truth it's expedient for you that I
[1:23:10] go away he's saying I've got to go it's
[1:23:13] better for you that I go than I
[1:23:16] stay you think what could be more
[1:23:18] important than the personal presence of
[1:23:20] God in his form there but he says you
[1:23:23] don't understand but let me tell you
[1:23:25] just believe this it's better for you
[1:23:27] that I
[1:23:29] go think about
[1:23:32] it how much tonight would we prefer to
[1:23:34] have the body of Jesus Christ here and
[1:23:37] he says no it's better that I go because
[1:23:39] there's something coming that'll help
[1:23:40] you more than my physical
[1:23:42] presence what was he trying to do he
[1:23:44] says you got to grow you got to mature
[1:23:45] you got to come into
[1:23:47] adoption and that can't happen unless I
[1:23:49] go because they'd lean on the arm of
[1:23:51] Flesh way too much they'd lean on the
[1:23:53] arm of Flesh and guess what the arm of
[1:23:56] Flesh wasn't doing them nearly the good
[1:23:57] that they thought it was CU every time
[1:23:59] he's around there what does Jesus keep
[1:24:01] having to say oh ye of little faith oh
[1:24:03] ye of little faith they have God
[1:24:05] incarnate in flesh and he keeps saying
[1:24:07] why are you so scared why are you so
[1:24:09] worried why aren't you doing what I told
[1:24:11] you to do time and time again the
[1:24:13] physical presence of God was not doing
[1:24:15] them any good that I you know what I
[1:24:17] mean it wasn't doing them as much good
[1:24:19] as what would happen on the day of
[1:24:20] Pentecost let me put it that
[1:24:22] way he says it's obedient for you that I
[1:24:25] go away for if I go not away the
[1:24:27] comforter will not come unto you but if
[1:24:29] I depart I'll send him unto
[1:24:32] you he says you need the Holy Spirit
[1:24:34] more than you need my physical presence
[1:24:36] he says and when he is come he will
[1:24:39] reprove that word means convict rebuke
[1:24:42] correct he will rebuke the world of sin
[1:24:46] and of righteousness and judgment now
[1:24:48] watch this is the comforter coming and
[1:24:50] he says the comforter is going to rebuke
[1:24:52] the world I what brother Aaron Oglesby
[1:24:55] spoke of when he was at Camp he said
[1:24:57] David loved correction remember what he
[1:25:00] said in Psalms he says thy rod and thy
[1:25:03] staff they comfort me a Shepherd has a
[1:25:05] rod and a staff he says and when I feel
[1:25:07] that Rod it comforts me cuz remember
[1:25:11] sometimes the rod is there to whack you
[1:25:14] to get you back to where you need to be
[1:25:17] sometimes it's there to rescue you and
[1:25:19] sometimes it's just there to let you
[1:25:21] know hey I'm with
[1:25:22] you he says that's my comfort but this
[1:25:25] is not the same Comfort to the world
[1:25:27] Amen he says I'm going to reprove them
[1:25:30] of sin because they believe not on me
[1:25:33] what is sin lying drinking stealing
[1:25:38] cheating sexual immorality that's not
[1:25:41] Sin Sin he says here is
[1:25:45] unbelief he says you're convicted of sin
[1:25:47] because you don't believe remember what
[1:25:49] the scripture says of Adam and Eve in
[1:25:51] the beginning it says that she was found
[1:25:53] in transgression she sinned because what
[1:25:55] she did was through
[1:25:57] unbelief Adam never disbelieved the word
[1:26:01] he chose to he chose to go against it
[1:26:04] for her sake but he never disbelieved he
[1:26:07] never disbelieved the scripture never
[1:26:09] accuses Adam of
[1:26:11] sinning but he broke the word of God and
[1:26:13] he had to pay the price Eve disbelieved
[1:26:15] and she sinned Adam did not disbelieve
[1:26:18] he went in with his eyes wide open
[1:26:20] knowing full well what he did
[1:26:24] he says I'll I'll rebuke them of
[1:26:26] righteousness because I go to the my
[1:26:27] father and you see me no more and of
[1:26:30] judgment because the prince of this
[1:26:32] world is judged now watch this shift now
[1:26:34] we're talking about the spirit of Truth
[1:26:36] and Jesus Takes the turn and we have a
[1:26:38] part in this we have a part in receiving
[1:26:40] it but we have a part in producing it
[1:26:42] because you see in verses 8 to 11 what
[1:26:44] the Holy Spirit Will in us will do it'll
[1:26:47] reprove the world for how they're living
[1:26:50] absolutely it will look when Peter comes
[1:26:53] down from the upper room on the day of
[1:26:55] Pentecost what does he do he reproves
[1:26:57] him he says you've killed the Prince of
[1:27:01] Glory you went and you killed him you
[1:27:04] sacrificed him he came for you he came
[1:27:07] to save you and you went and you killed
[1:27:09] him and he says there's a judgment for
[1:27:12] that there's a price to be paid but he
[1:27:15] came for you and what happens when the
[1:27:17] spirit of Truth is there and it reproves
[1:27:19] what does it do it catches the children
[1:27:22] of light they can take reproof because
[1:27:25] it says their hearts were
[1:27:27] pricked they heard the reproof and they
[1:27:30] said hey that's me I did that I was part
[1:27:32] of the crowd that did it what do I do
[1:27:34] and what did the word come forth with a
[1:27:38] remedy the word's not there to judge you
[1:27:41] the word is there to show you how to get
[1:27:43] out from under the Judgment but it let
[1:27:45] it has to let you know you're under
[1:27:46] judgment so it can take you out
[1:27:47] otherwise you're going to go bumbling
[1:27:48] through life thinking you're okay and
[1:27:51] you're going to get to the end and
[1:27:52] realize oh my goodness I wasn't okay the
[1:27:55] word comes to let you know you're not
[1:27:57] okay and shows you how to come to a
[1:27:58] place that's okay so they said to him
[1:28:00] what do I have to do how do I get rid of
[1:28:02] this guilt and he says
[1:28:04] repent for the remission of sins be
[1:28:07] baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:28:09] Christ and you'll receive the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost that's the only thing that's going
[1:28:13] to work not just repentance not just
[1:28:16] baptism but it's the Holy Spirit that'll
[1:28:17] change you it's the holy spirit that
[1:28:19] will take that away amen cuz the spirit
[1:28:22] of truth comes always with salvation
[1:28:24] first and if you turn it down it's going
[1:28:26] to be judgment but Jesus is focused now
[1:28:29] on what this is going to do for us he
[1:28:31] says this is what it does but now he's
[1:28:33] talking to us because remember those
[1:28:35] disciples already had a Ministry with
[1:28:37] signs and wonders they were preaching
[1:28:39] the gospel of repentance uh that Christ
[1:28:41] had given them they had faced
[1:28:42] persecution they've been proven and they
[1:28:44] had shared jesus' message all around the
[1:28:46] land and yet that wasn't enough that
[1:28:49] wasn't enough because watch what Jesus
[1:28:51] says I have yet many things to say unto
[1:28:53] you but you cannot bear them now there's
[1:28:56] a time and there's a season for
[1:28:58] everything and you'll see here Jesus
[1:29:00] says there are things that you can't see
[1:29:02] you can't hear you can't understand you
[1:29:04] can't receive until you have the Holy
[1:29:06] Ghost otherwise it'll break you it'll
[1:29:09] break you sometimes it's because it's
[1:29:11] hardship and sometimes because it's
[1:29:14] Authority and you don't have that
[1:29:15] character yet but whatever it is there's
[1:29:18] some things that we can't bear we can't
[1:29:20] carry we can't handle until we get the
[1:29:22] Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] he says now how be it when he the spirit
[1:29:26] of Truth is come he'll guide you into
[1:29:29] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[1:29:31] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:29:33] that shall he speak and he'll show you
[1:29:35] things to come Jesus knew things that he
[1:29:37] had held back from them amen because the
[1:29:40] Believers needed a new birth before they
[1:29:42] could receive
[1:29:43] it they had truth but he says you need
[1:29:47] to come into all
[1:29:49] Truth Listen Judas had
[1:29:52] truth but the truth did did not hold
[1:29:55] Judas why cuz he didn't have all of it
[1:29:58] he had most of it but he didn't have the
[1:30:00] most important part of it which was the
[1:30:02] life and the light of the truth not just
[1:30:04] the facts of The Truth Listen you think
[1:30:06] about it the truth hadn't held Peter
[1:30:08] either did
[1:30:09] it Peter backed down when persecution
[1:30:12] came when they kind of put him on the
[1:30:14] mark and said are you a follower of
[1:30:16] Jesus he denied him and he denied him
[1:30:19] and he denied him he had a lot of truth
[1:30:21] but the truth wasn't enough he needed
[1:30:24] the spirit of the truth to hold him that
[1:30:26] was the Difference Maker he knew plenty
[1:30:28] amen but he needed the Living Word
[1:30:29] inside of him the spirit of God inside
[1:30:31] of him not just the facts not just the
[1:30:34] doctrine not just the passion but he
[1:30:36] needed a reality a life inside of him
[1:30:38] amen being around truth won't hold you
[1:30:41] you got to become truth you got to be a
[1:30:43] part of Truth you got to receive it and
[1:30:45] let it be a living part inside of you
[1:30:47] Amen brother Brandon would say this he
[1:30:49] says when he not a thought he says he he
[1:30:54] is a personal pronoun when he the Holy
[1:30:56] Ghost has come the spirit of Truth he
[1:30:58] will reveal these things to you that I
[1:31:00] have said unto you and will show you
[1:31:03] things to come he says that's the great
[1:31:05] Shepherd that's the Shepherd that Jesus
[1:31:08] left he's saying I've said all sorts of
[1:31:10] things to you and you don't even
[1:31:11] understand it but when you get the Holy
[1:31:14] Ghost it'll be made clear what I was
[1:31:17] talking
[1:31:18] about Jesus had said before this that we
[1:31:21] read he says the works that I do shall
[1:31:22] you do also he said said if you ask
[1:31:24] anything in my name I'll do it and he
[1:31:26] said Greater Works than I do shall you
[1:31:28] do and all of those wonderful things
[1:31:30] were in the
[1:31:31] future every single one of those things
[1:31:34] and Jesus is saying the the spirit of
[1:31:36] Truth the holy spirit is going to come
[1:31:37] back and he will reveal these things to
[1:31:40] you what was he revealing on the day of
[1:31:43] Pentecost did the Holy Spirit reveal
[1:31:45] Doctrine no he revealed the reality of
[1:31:48] it he made it manifest he made it real
[1:31:51] that's what he's talking about amen yes
[1:31:53] there was Doctrine involved when the
[1:31:55] disciples walked out of the upper room
[1:31:57] but when they went to the gate beautiful
[1:31:59] and went around the city afterwards and
[1:32:01] and and working signs and wonders and
[1:32:02] going here and there what was the change
[1:32:05] the change was not the signs and wonders
[1:32:07] the change was they had leadership now
[1:32:09] they had Direction they had a guide they
[1:32:11] had something inside of them that gave
[1:32:13] them not only the faith to do it but the
[1:32:15] unction to do it in the first place they
[1:32:17] knew where to go what to do and how to
[1:32:18] do it and they they they Marvel at them
[1:32:22] because it said they saw that they were
[1:32:23] were unlearned men they were ignorant
[1:32:26] men they weren't going around converting
[1:32:28] people by great speeches and sermons but
[1:32:31] they said that they knew that they had
[1:32:32] been with
[1:32:34] Jesus why cuz he was they were doing the
[1:32:36] exact same things that Jesus was doing
[1:32:39] amen I preached on this before and this
[1:32:42] is just my personal thing to say if I
[1:32:44] could put it that way you can take it or
[1:32:46] leave it we look at that that phrase and
[1:32:48] it says that he'll show you things to
[1:32:50] come and we automatically jump to
[1:32:52] prophecy and we know know that we know
[1:32:55] that the the holy spirit is thus sayeth
[1:32:57] the Lord amen it it does speak in
[1:32:59] Prophecy amen but I believe that it's
[1:33:02] more than that because when we look at
[1:33:03] the Fulfillment of this on the day of
[1:33:05] Pentecost it wasn't just prophecy it was
[1:33:09] reality show you things to come what
[1:33:12] good is it if we're always talking about
[1:33:13] it but we never get it that's what the
[1:33:15] holy spirit is to do is to take it from
[1:33:18] words and into reality in our day-to-day
[1:33:20] lives he'll show you things to come so
[1:33:23] that the things that you speak of the
[1:33:24] things that you read the things that you
[1:33:26] hear become a reality in your life
[1:33:29] church we're in the final age the
[1:33:30] speaking is done the speaking is done
[1:33:33] there's no more prophecy coming for the
[1:33:35] Gentiles it's finished she's received
[1:33:37] her last message amen now is the time of
[1:33:41] fulfillment showing you things to come
[1:33:44] making them a reality inside of our
[1:33:46] Lives amen now is the time of showing
[1:33:49] it's the time of
[1:33:50] manifestation not the time of Prophecy
[1:33:53] prophecy he's been given now is the time
[1:33:55] where we live it where it produces
[1:33:57] itself inside of us he says I'm very
[1:34:00] thankful that the spirit of Truth was to
[1:34:02] be with us to the end and that Spirit of
[1:34:05] Truth is none other but the Lord Jesus
[1:34:08] himself in spiritual form for he said a
[1:34:11] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:34:13] more yet you shall see me for I'll be
[1:34:16] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:34:18] world he says and that means
[1:34:22] tonight that means tonight tonight and
[1:34:24] wherever we are we have the comforting
[1:34:26] words of knowing that Jesus will be with
[1:34:30] us how comforting would it be if he were
[1:34:33] to appear in the physical body here
[1:34:35] tonight we've got some needs we're going
[1:34:36] to pray for tonight how comforting would
[1:34:39] it be if Jesus Christ stepped Down In
[1:34:42] the Flesh
[1:34:44] here how would that change the
[1:34:46] atmosphere in this room if you knew that
[1:34:49] Jesus Christ was standing here brother
[1:34:51] Dale that he could come over there and
[1:34:53] he could touch you and lay his hands on
[1:34:55] you what would that do for you
[1:34:58] tonight it would change wouldn't
[1:35:02] it that every need that you have need of
[1:35:05] you could walk up to that person and he
[1:35:08] could answer he could deliver he could
[1:35:10] heal he could provide he could lead he
[1:35:13] could speak to the need he could discern
[1:35:15] the thoughts and intents of the
[1:35:16] heart how wonderful would that
[1:35:20] be and yet he says he's with us the same
[1:35:24] way
[1:35:25] tonight by faith you may not see him you
[1:35:29] may not feel him but he's here
[1:35:31] nonetheless cuz he said where two or
[1:35:33] three are gathered in my name there am I
[1:35:36] personal pronoun in the midst
[1:35:39] amen he's here in spirit form to carry
[1:35:42] us through and you don't have to reach
[1:35:44] out and touch him you can just touch him
[1:35:46] by faith amen he's here to lead us he's
[1:35:50] here to guide us he's here to take us
[1:35:52] all the way through
[1:35:54] as we start to close he says ' and now I
[1:35:55] come to thee he's still talking to the
[1:35:59] disciples he's talking to he's in prayer
[1:36:02] here actually he says now I come to thee
[1:36:03] and these things I speak in the world
[1:36:05] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:36:08] themselves I have given them what Thy
[1:36:12] word and the world hath hated them
[1:36:14] because they are not of the world even
[1:36:16] as I am not of the world I pray not that
[1:36:19] thou should us take them out of the
[1:36:20] world but that thou should us keep them
[1:36:23] from the evil
[1:36:24] what did Christ give them he gave them
[1:36:25] the word he gave them the word but he
[1:36:28] says my words are spirit and life so he
[1:36:31] gave them the word but he's got to give
[1:36:32] them the full
[1:36:33] word not just the letter it says they
[1:36:37] are not of the world even as I am not of
[1:36:39] the world sanctify them through thy
[1:36:42] truth Thy word is truth he says now
[1:36:47] catch this this is one of the most
[1:36:48] beautiful scriptures he says as thou
[1:36:51] Hast sent me into the world even so have
[1:36:54] I also sent them into the world how did
[1:36:58] God send that man Jesus Christ into the
[1:37:00] world he held him for 30
[1:37:03] years and then what did he do did he
[1:37:06] have a Ministry in those 30 years not as
[1:37:08] we know but he came down on the River
[1:37:11] Jordan and he placed his very own spirit
[1:37:14] inside of him and from there he sent him
[1:37:17] into his
[1:37:18] ministry he had the word all along now
[1:37:21] he had the person of the word inside of
[1:37:22] him and only then did he send him out
[1:37:27] and Jesus says As you have sent me I'm
[1:37:30] going to send them the same way no
[1:37:32] different I've given them my word they
[1:37:34] need the spirit they need the presence
[1:37:37] amen he was sending them as he was sent
[1:37:39] with Supernatural indwelling God inside
[1:37:42] of them a life a guide a light to direct
[1:37:44] their footsteps he says and for their
[1:37:47] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[1:37:50] might be Sanctified through the truth he
[1:37:52] says Thy word is true Tru he said that
[1:37:54] the spirit of Truth was coming and then
[1:37:55] he says Thy word is truth and so if we
[1:37:57] put that together we could say that the
[1:37:59] spirit of Truth is the spirit of the
[1:38:01] word amen the spirit of Truth the holy
[1:38:04] spirit will always confirm the word it
[1:38:06] will always point to the word it will
[1:38:08] always stay in line with the word of God
[1:38:10] because that is the only truth there is
[1:38:12] amen that is the anchor for our soul it
[1:38:15] is our absolute is our foundation why CU
[1:38:18] it's the word it's the Living Word it's
[1:38:20] the spirit of the word amen it's the
[1:38:22] life of the word of God and it will
[1:38:24] always take you into the word we can
[1:38:27] have Sensations we can have emotions we
[1:38:29] can have experiences those are all good
[1:38:31] and and well but it will always take you
[1:38:33] into the word that's how you know that
[1:38:35] it's God leading you amen he will always
[1:38:37] anchor Us in the word of
[1:38:39] God I'm going to read a five quotes and
[1:38:42] we'll
[1:38:43] close he says the word always comes to
[1:38:48] the true spirit
[1:38:50] filled that is the evidence of being
[1:38:52] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:54] that is what Jesus said would be the
[1:38:55] evidence he said I will pray the father
[1:38:57] he'll send you another comforter that he
[1:38:59] may abide with you forever even the
[1:39:02] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:39:04] receive he says now we know what truth
[1:39:06] is Thy word is truth John
[1:39:08] 17:17 again in John 8:43 says why do you
[1:39:12] not understand my speech even because ye
[1:39:15] cannot hear my word he says did you
[1:39:18] notice and we read this that the world
[1:39:20] cannot receive the Holy Ghost he says
[1:39:23] well in this verse I just read neither
[1:39:25] could they receive the word why because
[1:39:27] the spirit and the word are one and if
[1:39:30] you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets
[1:39:33] did the word would come to you you would
[1:39:36] receive it he says in John 14:26 it says
[1:39:39] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[1:39:41] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:39:43] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:39:46] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:39:48] have said unto you here again we find
[1:39:50] the word coming because of the spirit of
[1:39:52] God
[1:39:54] again in John 16:13 how be it when he
[1:39:57] the spirit of Truth word is come he will
[1:40:00] guide you into all truth he says Thy
[1:40:01] word is truth he shall not speak of
[1:40:03] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:40:06] what the word of God that shall he speak
[1:40:08] the word and he will show you things to
[1:40:10] come he says it's the spirit bringing
[1:40:13] the word of Prophecy I want you to know
[1:40:16] very carefully that Jesus did not say
[1:40:18] that the evidence of being baptized with
[1:40:19] the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:40:22] interpreting prop prophesying or
[1:40:24] shouting and dancing he said the
[1:40:26] evidence will be that you would be in
[1:40:28] the truth you would be in the word of
[1:40:30] God for your age he says the evidence
[1:40:33] has to do with receiving that word amen
[1:40:38] he says First Corinthians
[1:40:41] 14:37 37 says if any man think of
[1:40:44] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:40:47] him acknowledge that the things that I
[1:40:49] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:40:51] the Lord I was talking to brother Joe
[1:40:53] about this today at the gym I said it
[1:40:54] amazes me that the Catholic Church
[1:40:56] declares Peter to be the first pope and
[1:40:58] it's not Peter that had the scriptural
[1:41:00] Authority who had it Paul Paul says you
[1:41:03] have to acknowledge my message why
[1:41:06] because he says I didn't do this of
[1:41:07] myself I didn't come up with this he
[1:41:08] says it came out of from the Holy Ghost
[1:41:11] himself he says I can't even change it
[1:41:14] and he didn't change
[1:41:16] it the first head if you want to call it
[1:41:18] of the church on this Earth would have
[1:41:20] been Paul if we were going to pick one
[1:41:22] but he wasn't the head of the church he
[1:41:23] was was just a prophet amen he was a
[1:41:26] prophet used and led by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:28] to bring the Full Gospel to the Gentile
[1:41:30] church but in the end there was no Pope
[1:41:32] there it was just men being led by the
[1:41:36] spirit he says now see that the proof of
[1:41:39] the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge
[1:41:41] and follow what God's Prophet gave for
[1:41:43] his age as he set the church in order
[1:41:46] Paul had to say to those who claimed
[1:41:47] another Revelation in verse 36 what came
[1:41:50] the word of God out from you or came it
[1:41:53] unto you
[1:41:54] only see it only comes to
[1:41:57] me from somebody else I've received the
[1:42:00] word for my age the holy spirit's
[1:42:02] already spoken I've received it I'm a
[1:42:06] repeater Paul got it
[1:42:08] fresh and don't don't get me wrong I
[1:42:10] believe the Holy Spirit quickens the
[1:42:11] word to me it brings the word to me but
[1:42:13] it lines me up with what the Holy Spirit
[1:42:15] has already said in this age and in this
[1:42:17] message because that's their only one
[1:42:19] voice there only one voice I've got to
[1:42:21] line up with that other wise I'm saying
[1:42:23] the word came to
[1:42:25] me no no no came to a prophet and I've
[1:42:30] received it and that was the Holy Spirit
[1:42:32] speaking through that man he says
[1:42:35] this he says uh where am I at he says
[1:42:39] Paul had to say yes the evidence of a
[1:42:41] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:42:43] to produce the truth but to receive the
[1:42:46] truth the word and to believe and Obey
[1:42:49] it how simple is that how simple is that
[1:42:53] that's why we don't have to try and
[1:42:55] prove anything you accept the word the
[1:42:58] word does the work it's that
[1:43:00] simple that gives me such rest to just
[1:43:03] say Lord I believe it and I'm not just
[1:43:06] believing it in my mind and with my
[1:43:07] mouth but I'm applying it I'm letting it
[1:43:09] have its effect in my life and I can
[1:43:11] trust you for the results he says have
[1:43:13] you noticed in Revelation 22:17 the
[1:43:16] spirit and the bride say come and let
[1:43:19] him that heareth say come he says see
[1:43:21] the bride speaks the same word as does
[1:43:24] the spirit she's a word bride proving
[1:43:26] she has the spirit in every Church age
[1:43:29] we hear these words he that have an ear
[1:43:31] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:43:33] the churches the spirit gives the word
[1:43:36] if you have the spirit you will hear the
[1:43:38] word for your age as those true
[1:43:40] Christians took the word for their age
[1:43:43] he says did you get that last thought I
[1:43:45] repeat every Church age ends with the
[1:43:47] same admonition he that ha an ear let
[1:43:50] him the individual he what the spirit
[1:43:53] sayith to the churches he said the
[1:43:56] spirit gives the word he has the truth
[1:43:59] for each age last quote each age has had
[1:44:05] its own elect and the that elect group
[1:44:07] always heard the word and received it
[1:44:10] proving they had the seed in them John
[1:44:13] 8:47 says and he that is of God heareth
[1:44:16] God's words so simple ye therefore hear
[1:44:20] them not because ye are not of God you
[1:44:23] know what the spirit of truth will tell
[1:44:24] the
[1:44:25] truth and Jesus calls him out he says
[1:44:28] the reason you can't hear it is because
[1:44:30] you're not of it he says they refused
[1:44:33] the word Jesus and his words for their
[1:44:35] days but the true seed received the word
[1:44:37] because they were of God he says and all
[1:44:40] thy children shall be taught of God the
[1:44:42] Holy Spirit Isaiah 54:13 Jesus said the
[1:44:45] same thing in John 6:45 he says being
[1:44:48] one with the word proves whether you are
[1:44:50] of God and Spirit-filled there there is
[1:44:53] no other Criterion amen God bless you
[1:44:57] let's stand if we
[1:45:01] would
[1:45:03] amen we've got a lot further to go on
[1:45:05] this but being a Wednesday night I
[1:45:07] didn't want to press the People Too
