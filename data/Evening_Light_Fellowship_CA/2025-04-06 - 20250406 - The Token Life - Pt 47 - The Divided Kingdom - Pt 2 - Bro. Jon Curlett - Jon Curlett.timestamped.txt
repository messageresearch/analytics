[27:22] tonight. There's joy, joy, joy in my
[27:28] heart. For Jesus makes everything
[27:33] right. I gave you my old tattered
[27:39] garments. He gave me a robe of pure

[42:48] for your grace. Thank you for your
[42:50] promises, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for
[42:52] your word that is yay and amen this
[42:54] morning, Lord
[42:56] God. Lord, we just want to give you
[42:58] everything we are and everything we have
[43:00] this morning. Lord, may your word just
[43:02] have its way. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[43:05] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[43:08] you. Turn if you would again to Romans
[43:10] chapter 7 this morning. Romans chapter
[43:12] 7. It's good to be
[43:14] here. Amen. Welcome each one here. We
[43:16] want to remember the Snow family, of
[43:18] course.
[43:19] Sister Shirley Snow, that's brother
[43:21] Tom's wife, not brother Ron's wife,
[43:24] passed away. We know this weekend the
[43:25] funeral is on Tuesday. So, we want to
[43:28] remember them in prayer. I was talking
[43:30] to her daughter, Sister Marian, last
[43:32] night and she was relaying just very
[43:35] thankfully when they were here and in
[43:37] the hospital and it was on a boxing day
[43:40] and I'm getting a real bad echo here,
[43:41] brother Matt. I don't know if you can
[43:42] help with that, but um and how you know,
[43:45] brother Bob and sister Brenda went up
[43:47] and brother Mark and Sister Morin went
[43:49] up and she was just crying on the phone
[43:51] with me just in memory of that and how
[43:52] appreciative she was of these people
[43:54] that really didn't know them a whole lot
[43:57] and didn't spend a whole lot of time
[43:58] with them, but yet they came up to give
[44:00] them some fellowship and give them some
[44:02] company in the in the holiday season and
[44:04] whatnot while they're in the hospital.
[44:05] So definitely remember them as they go
[44:08] through that. Remember brother Grant,
[44:09] he's got a lot going on with school
[44:11] right now. He's got the heaviest
[44:12] workload he's had so far and it's very
[44:14] overwhelming and so we want to remember
[44:17] him in prayer as well day by day. Amen.
[44:19] Romans chapter 7, I want to finish where
[44:22] we finished last service and then go on
[44:24] to where we want to go today. Romans
[44:26] 7:23 says, "But I see another law in my
[44:28] members." This is Paul now the prophet
[44:30] to the age and man full of the Holy
[44:31] Ghost. I see another law in my members
[44:34] waring against the law of my mind and
[44:36] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[44:38] sin which is in my members. Oh wretched
[44:41] man that I am, who shall deliver me from
[44:44] the body of this death? But I thank God
[44:46] through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then
[44:49] with the mind I myself serve the law of
[44:51] God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[44:54] And let's continue on to Romans 8. Paul
[44:57] says, "There is therefore now no
[44:59] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[45:01] Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
[45:04] after the spirit. For the law of the
[45:07] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[45:09] me free from the law of sin and death.
[45:12] For what the law could not do and that
[45:15] it was weak through the flesh, God
[45:17] sending his own son in the likeness of
[45:19] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[45:22] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[45:25] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[45:27] walk not after the flesh but after the
[45:30] spirit. Amen. God bless you. You can
[45:32] have your seats this morning. And I want
[45:34] to take a second service on this thought
[45:36] that we started last service on the
[45:37] divided kingdom. And last service we
[45:40] preached mainly out of Romans 7 if you
[45:42] remember. And it's it's not one of those
[45:43] services where you come out feeling all
[45:45] wonderful about yourself because we are
[45:47] talking about the battle. And we are
[45:48] talking about the struggle that we deal
[45:50] with on a daily basis. And we talked
[45:52] about how our soul is the eternal
[45:54] portion within us. It's the part and
[45:56] attribute of God that's inside of us if
[45:58] we're a child of God. Amen. But when
[46:00] Adam s when Adam fell, that soul was
[46:02] still belonging to God. But this body
[46:04] fell into sin. And so we set up this
[46:06] battle where this body of sin was what
[46:08] housed this this soul, this eternal
[46:10] portion of God. And it set up that great
[46:13] battle that we face on a daily basis.
[46:15] Because in our soul, in our heart, when
[46:18] we come to Christ, that then it has its
[46:20] own desires that are changed into his
[46:22] desires. But this body of flesh, it
[46:24] still has all the desires that it's had
[46:26] since the very beginning. And that never
[46:28] changes, church. It never changes until
[46:30] that body is glorified. This body wants
[46:32] what it wants. And you cannot change it.
[46:34] It doesn't matter how much you do to it,
[46:37] how much you don't do to it, how much
[46:38] you starve it, how much you beat it up.
[46:40] It's still going to have desires. But
[46:41] what we can do is we can control the
[46:43] strength of those desires by how we feed
[46:45] it or how we stop feeding it as the case
[46:47] may be. And guess what? It wears on us.
[46:49] It tires us out. It frustrates us at
[46:52] times. It it makes us think maybe less
[46:54] of ourselves than we ought to. And
[46:56] remember what we said in in last
[46:57] service. And I want to read exactly uh
[47:00] the way we read it last service in this
[47:01] in this version that I put here for
[47:03] verse 24. Paul said, "I'm a miserable
[47:05] human
[47:08] being." Oh, I I love the way the spirit
[47:11] of God can talk through a man that's
[47:13] yielded. I'm a miserable human being.
[47:17] Paul said, "Who will deliver me from
[47:19] this dead
[47:20] corpse?" Anybody want to be delivered
[47:23] this morning? Has anybody felt miserable
[47:25] this week? I'm feeling miserable this
[47:27] week. I'm tired. I'm wore out. I'm a
[47:30] miserable human being because I'm
[47:32] dealing with this flesh. But then he
[47:34] comes right back around after saying
[47:36] that, saying, "I'm a miserable human
[47:37] being." And what does he say? He says,
[47:38] "Praise the
[47:39] Lord." He says, "I thank God through
[47:42] Jesus Christ our Lord." So then with the
[47:45] mind I myself serve the law of God, but
[47:48] with the flesh the law of
[47:50] sin. It's an odd thing to say after
[47:52] saying how miserable he is. He's saying,
[47:54] "Thank God." Church, when a prophet of
[47:57] God says, "Thank God," after saying
[47:59] something that ought to beat us up, we
[48:00] ought to know there's more to what he's
[48:02] talking about than what he's just told
[48:03] us. He spent all of verse all of chapter
[48:06] 7 telling us how miserable and how hard
[48:08] and how easily we fail and how easily we
[48:11] get broken down and how how far our good
[48:13] intentions take us, which is about this
[48:15] far. Telling us everything that's
[48:18] against us. And even the fact that as a
[48:20] prophet of God filled with the spirit of
[48:23] God, he's saying, "I can't do it and I'm
[48:25] miserable in doing it." There's these
[48:28] failures in my life. But yet, he says,
[48:30] "Thank God." Why? Because he has a
[48:32] battle in the first place. Because he's
[48:35] had a mind. He's had a soul. He's had a
[48:37] heart that's been changed so that there
[48:38] is a struggle. There is a battle for the
[48:41] things of God to do what God wants him
[48:43] to do. Amen. He's had something settled.
[48:46] There's been a stake driven down.
[48:48] There's been a standard raised in his
[48:50] life. Hallelujah. That says, "I am not
[48:53] my own. I'm not fight. I'm not doing
[48:56] what I used to do. Now there's a
[48:57] battle." And because there's a battle,
[48:59] it shows that there's a victory that has
[49:01] to be won. Something's got to win.
[49:03] Somebody's got to win this
[49:06] battle. Paul says, "I'm glad that I'm in
[49:08] a battle." But he's not glad because
[49:10] he's just in the battle, church. He's
[49:12] glad because the battle means there's
[49:14] victory coming. Hallelujah. There's
[49:16] something coming that's going to set him
[49:18] free from the struggle. There's
[49:20] something that's going to set him free
[49:22] from the dayto-day
[49:24] grind. That's where we're standing this
[49:27] morning. I'm here to tell you, you're in
[49:29] a battle. But I want to say when a
[49:31] prophet of God says, "I thank God I'm in
[49:32] a battle." It's because victory is on
[49:35] the way. It's because there's an end to
[49:37] this battle that's in our lives.
[49:40] Amen. This is not a battle that will
[49:44] end.
[49:46] This is a battle that's already over.
[49:49] You have to see from the eternal. That's
[49:51] why God sends prophets is to get us to
[49:54] see beyond the circumstances and the
[49:56] day-to-day situations and the hardships
[49:58] and the failures and the trials to get
[50:00] us to step back and see the way that God
[50:02] sees these things. And when we see it
[50:04] from God's side, the battle is already
[50:07] over. We are already sitting in heavenly
[50:09] places in Christ Jesus, it says. And you
[50:12] can't be there unless you're an
[50:13] overcomer. But the scripture says, "We
[50:15] are already there." Why? Because in the
[50:18] eternal eyes and sight of God, this is
[50:21] already over. You've already won. That
[50:24] famous song that the cathedrals used to
[50:26] sing, I've read the back of the book and
[50:27] we win. Not we win though. We've already
[50:30] won. That's why when God sends something
[50:33] by his word, it is eternal. It is
[50:36] settled. It is done. And so, we're
[50:37] resting on that this morning. That when
[50:39] God sends a battle our way, it's because
[50:41] there's a victory that's won. Not there
[50:44] will be one. There's a victory that's
[50:46] already been won. And all you have to do
[50:48] is walk through the script. That's all
[50:50] you have to do this morning. Amen. I
[50:52] want to show you what victory looks like
[50:54] this morning. I was so looking forward
[50:56] to preaching the service this morning.
[50:58] Amen. I want us to live in victory. I
[51:00] want us to see ourselves the way that
[51:02] God sees us this morning. I want us to
[51:04] remind ourselves of what God says about
[51:06] you and I this morning. Cuz if we can
[51:08] see it and take it and believe it, it'll
[51:10] be victory in our lives this morning.
[51:12] Amen. Do you want victory this morning?
[51:14] Let's read it. He says in Romans 8, he
[51:16] says there, he just said he's miserable,
[51:18] church. He's just said he struggles.
[51:21] He's just said, "I fail. I can't seem to
[51:24] win for losing." And then Paul comes
[51:26] right around. He says, "There is
[51:28] therefore now no condemnation to them
[51:32] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[51:34] after the flesh, but after the spirit."
[51:37] And I want to just preach my heart out
[51:38] this morning on this. Amen. If you'll
[51:40] stick with me this morning, let's see
[51:42] what the word means this morning. Amen.
[51:44] Because this is the victory. This is the
[51:46] benefit of the believer that's been
[51:48] filled with the Holy Spirit. Paul says,
[51:50] "There is therefore now no
[51:52] condemnation." What that means for you
[51:54] this morning, you have a clean slate.
[51:56] Now, we don't know what clean slate
[51:58] means anymore because all we have are
[51:59] computers. But in the old days, you had
[52:01] a piece of tablet. They had tablets back
[52:04] then made out of slate or stone. We've
[52:06] got a slate quarry up here outside of
[52:08] CBS if you
[52:09] notice. And on that slate, they would
[52:12] write out things with chalk. And when
[52:14] they had filled that slate off, then
[52:16] what would they do? They'd wipe it off
[52:17] and they'd start again. But see, what we
[52:19] see in those days was they would have a
[52:21] slate that recorded everything you did.
[52:24] And when you wiped it out, you couldn't
[52:26] say they were wrong or they were right.
[52:28] There was no no record there. Paul's
[52:30] saying there is no record. You have no
[52:32] marks against you. You have no sins
[52:34] against you. You have no faults against
[52:36] you. You have no flaws recorded against
[52:37] you. There is no record of wrongdoing if
[52:40] you're walking in according to the law
[52:42] of the spirit of life that we're going
[52:43] to talk about this morning. Amen. You
[52:45] have no sins recorded. You have no
[52:47] speeding tickets. You have no felonies.
[52:50] You have no misdemeanors. Amen. You are
[52:52] in perfect unity with God in this
[52:54] scripture. Amen. That word
[52:56] condemnations, he says there's therefore
[52:57] now no condemnation. It doesn't just
[53:00] mean your conscience isn't bothered
[53:02] anymore. We're way past conscience in
[53:04] the scripture, church. It means that you
[53:06] are beyond
[53:09] judgment. Hallelujah. And if you are
[53:12] beyond judgment, you are beyond
[53:16] punishment. Okay? You notice how in this
[53:19] world, we seem to have people that are
[53:20] above the
[53:22] law. We have a prime minister that can
[53:25] do just about anything he wants, break
[53:26] all sorts of ethical rules, and they'll
[53:28] still keep him in power. But you do one
[53:30] little thing, and they'll send you to
[53:31] jail.
[53:32] Some people are above the law. I'm here
[53:34] to tell you this morning, you're above
[53:36] the old law. Hallelujah.
[53:39] It's not that you're just beyond it.
[53:41] It's that it no longer applies to you.
[53:44] You're above the law this morning. Amen.
[53:46] You're outside the law that originally
[53:48] had power over you. Amen. What used to
[53:50] hold you in its grip now has loosed its
[53:53] shackles. It's changed. It's handcuffed
[53:54] from off your life. No wonder Paul would
[53:56] say, "Thank God." When he finished Roman
[53:59] 7, no wonder he was saying thank God
[54:01] because he knows Romans 8:1 is coming.
[54:03] He knows what awaits the believer that
[54:05] will keep pressing on. Amen. He says to
[54:08] them which are in Christ Jesus, what's
[54:11] it what's the way you get into this
[54:13] position of no condemnation, you got to
[54:15] get into Christ. That's the only place
[54:17] you can be. Amen. Doesn't say you have
[54:19] to be in a certain church. Doesn't say
[54:20] you have to sit under a certain pastor.
[54:22] Doesn't say you have to sign your name
[54:24] to a book. But it says you've got to be
[54:26] in Christ. And that's the only place of
[54:28] liberty for the Christian this morning.
[54:31] It is not in some church or
[54:32] denomination. Amen. No priest, no
[54:34] minister can set you free this morning.
[54:36] The only way you can do this is you got
[54:38] to get into Christ. That's the only way
[54:40] it can happen. Amen. How do you get into
[54:42] Christ? Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12,
[54:44] for as the body is one and had many
[54:46] members, and all the members of that one
[54:48] body being many are one body, so also is
[54:51] Christ. He says, the body of Christ is
[54:53] just like your body. It's got lots of
[54:54] different pieces and parts, but together
[54:56] they form one thing. They all work
[54:58] together. Then he says, "For by one
[55:01] spirit are we all, no
[55:05] exceptions. You cannot get into Christ
[55:07] any way except by the spirit of Christ."
[55:10] He says, "By one spirit are we all
[55:12] baptized into one body." We've all got
[55:15] to be born again. He says, "Whether we
[55:18] be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, we've
[55:20] all been made to drink into one spirit.
[55:22] For the body is not one member but many.
[55:25] So how do we get into Christ? Do we come
[55:27] to church? Do we sign our names on a
[55:29] book? Do we get baptized? Do we shake
[55:31] hands with the preacher, the pastor, the
[55:33] minister or the pope? No. Those are all
[55:36] good things. But that is not how you get
[55:39] into Christ. You get into Christ by the
[55:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Holy
[55:44] Spirit is the only witness that you have
[55:46] passed from death unto life. You can
[55:48] come to those pearly gates on that
[55:50] morning and say, "I signed my name to a
[55:52] book. I said amen." In church, I nodded
[55:54] when brother John was preaching. That
[55:56] won't get you in. You got to come with
[55:58] the token of the Holy Spirit that you
[55:59] pass from death unto life. It's the only
[56:01] thing that'll work. And how do you get
[56:03] the Holy Spirit? We preached it. Acts
[56:05] 2:38, "Repent and be baptized for the
[56:09] remission of sins in the name of Jesus
[56:11] Christ and you shall receive the Holy
[56:13] Spirit." Acts 2:38 has never stopped
[56:15] working. It still works today. I'm a
[56:18] witness of it. It still works today.
[56:20] Amen. Thank you, brother Mark that. It
[56:22] still works today. We have complicated
[56:25] the new birth. We have so complicated
[56:27] it. Simple, heartfelt repentance. Accept
[56:31] the work of Calvary. Be baptized the
[56:35] right way and go expecting the spirit of
[56:37] God to fill your life and change you.
[56:39] That's it. That's it. The rest will
[56:41] come. The spirit of truth will lead you
[56:43] into right. It'll take you away from
[56:45] wrong. But you've got to take it the way
[56:46] that he said it. Repent. Be baptized in
[56:49] the name of Jesus Christ. And he'll give
[56:50] you the spirit of God. That simple. That
[56:53] simple. Amen. And then from there, you
[56:55] accept the word of God as it comes to
[56:57] you. Listen, don't expect yourself to be
[56:59] this amazing Christian from day one.
[57:01] You've got to grow. You've got to
[57:02] mature. You've got to be tested. You got
[57:04] to be tried. And the word of God has to
[57:06] do a work in you by the spirit of God.
[57:09] You're not born an adult in Christ.
[57:10] You're babes in Christ, the scripture
[57:12] says. But from there, you'll grow into
[57:14] be somebody like brother Bob or brother
[57:16] Mark or their
[57:18] wives. But it takes
[57:20] time. But it starts with simple faith
[57:23] and obedience in the word of God. And
[57:25] that's it.
[57:26] Amen. He says, "And you do that." He
[57:29] says, "Then they who there are those who
[57:32] walk not after the flesh but after the
[57:35] spirit." What's the effect of the new
[57:36] birth? What's the effect of the baptism
[57:38] of the Holy Spirit? It makes you walk a
[57:40] different way.
[57:42] That word walk means to conduct oneself
[57:45] to live and it's a new way by the
[57:47] spirit. Remember before this no matter
[57:49] our good intentions we walked according
[57:51] to the dictates of this flesh. We are
[57:54] under a spirit of disobedience the Bible
[57:56] says and we've now come under the spirit
[57:58] of life the spirit of truth the spirit
[58:00] of light and that cannot be in you and
[58:02] something not change. Something has to
[58:04] change. Everything has to change because
[58:06] you're under new management. There's a
[58:08] new boss in the house and you've got to
[58:10] be listening to him now. Everything has
[58:12] to change. Amen. And so we see here that
[58:15] when the spirit of God comes in, you
[58:17] walk a different way. You live a
[58:18] different way. You talk a different way.
[58:20] You decide a different way. Your focus
[58:22] is different. The preeminence of things
[58:23] in your life is different because you're
[58:25] under the new management of the Holy
[58:27] Spirit. You've got somebody else in the
[58:29] control tower. Amen. And so you ought to
[58:31] do only one thing and that's walk
[58:33] according to God's will and God's word
[58:36] which is the same thing Paul said in
[58:38] acts he says for in him we live we move
[58:42] and we have our being as certain also of
[58:44] your po own poets have said for we also
[58:47] we are also his are his offspring. So
[58:50] before we were surrounded by guilt, we
[58:52] were surrounded by shame. We were
[58:54] surrounded by ungodly desires. But now
[58:56] in Christ, everything has changed. And
[58:59] everything in my life ought to be
[59:00] Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ. And
[59:03] sometimes we fail. Sometimes we fall. We
[59:05] get frustrated. We say things. We snap
[59:07] out. We fall. We fail. That's okay. But
[59:11] it's Christ that's trying to drive
[59:12] through us. And we're just in a process
[59:14] of bringing this flesh under subjection
[59:15] day by day.
[59:17] Start with an inward work rather than
[59:19] trying to reform. I was listening to
[59:22] brother Bram this morning. He says we've
[59:23] got a we've got a country that's trying
[59:25] to reform itself. He says and it will
[59:27] never work. You need an inward change.
[59:29] You need a new birth to make it work.
[59:31] Amen. What happens? He changes the
[59:34] desires. He changes the decisions. He
[59:36] changes the direction. He changes the
[59:38] way that we live. Amen. Remember this is
[59:40] the law of the spirit of life. Amen.
[59:43] It's not the law of life. It's the law
[59:45] of the spirit of life. Amen. Because
[59:48] that law only works if you have the Holy
[59:50] Spirit in your life. See, too many
[59:52] people today are trying to produce a
[59:55] life rather than get the spirit of the
[59:58] life. And so what they end up doing is
[1:00:00] they end up walking away from the true
[1:00:02] word of God because they're led by their
[1:00:04] own desires. And so we get things like
[1:00:05] the the prosperity gospel and these
[1:00:07] things where they say, "Well, I'm going
[1:00:09] to ask what I want. I'm going to pray to
[1:00:10] God and he's going to give it to me
[1:00:12] because I'm a child of his." No, we get
[1:00:14] the spirit to bring us into what life is
[1:00:16] really supposed to look like. And it
[1:00:18] changes our mind. It changes our desires
[1:00:20] so that it brings us into the mind of
[1:00:22] Christ so that we can ask what God would
[1:00:24] want us to ask. Amen. It settles us
[1:00:27] down and it brings us flesh subject to
[1:00:30] the word of God. Amen. We have to yield
[1:00:33] to that spirit. That's what it does.
[1:00:35] It'll bring a yielding to that. Amen.
[1:00:38] The Holy Spirit's here to give us that
[1:00:40] mind of Christ so that we ask according
[1:00:42] to his will. It's here to set our
[1:00:44] desires on higher things than just
[1:00:45] houses and cars and vacation and luxury
[1:00:48] and ease of life. Absolutely. Amen. And
[1:00:52] in other words, our part to play is
[1:00:53] surrender. It's always surrender. For
[1:00:55] the believer, it is surrendering to the
[1:00:57] spirit of God. You want to know how to
[1:00:59] get victory this morning? Surrender.
[1:01:01] Surrender to Christ, though. Not to the
[1:01:03] flesh. Not to this carnal mind.
[1:01:05] surrender to the power of God inside
[1:01:08] your life. And as we sing that song, let
[1:01:09] go and let God have his wonderful way.
[1:01:11] And watch what he can do in a surrender
[1:01:13] vessel this morning, day by day. Paul
[1:01:16] would continue in Romans 8, he says,
[1:01:18] "For the law of the spirit of life in
[1:01:21] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:01:24] law of sin and death. For what the law
[1:01:26] could not do and that it was weak
[1:01:28] through the flesh." Listen, our fleshly
[1:01:30] strengths are not enough to overcome.
[1:01:32] It's not enough to fulfill the law. It
[1:01:34] was insufficient to meet God's
[1:01:36] requirement. He says, "God sending his
[1:01:39] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:01:41] and for sin condemn sin in the flesh."
[1:01:44] The amplified says it this way, "For God
[1:01:46] has done what the law could not do, its
[1:01:49] power being weakened by the flesh, the
[1:01:52] entire nature of man without the Holy
[1:01:53] Spirit." He said, "Sending his own son
[1:01:56] in the guise of sinful flesh and as an
[1:01:58] offering for sin, God condemns him in
[1:02:01] sin in the flesh." He says that means he
[1:02:03] subdued. He overcame. He to bribe sin of
[1:02:06] its power over all who accept that
[1:02:09] sacrifice. Why? That the righteousness
[1:02:12] of the law might be fulfilled in us.
[1:02:14] Church, what is the righteousness of the
[1:02:16] law? To do what the law requires to do
[1:02:20] what God
[1:02:21] requires. Can we ever do it? But Paul
[1:02:25] says we've got to fulfill it in our
[1:02:27] flesh, in us.
[1:02:30] Remember this is the thing that is the
[1:02:32] key here. It's not what is the
[1:02:34] righteousness, it's who is the
[1:02:36] righteousness. Because who is the
[1:02:37] righteousness of the law? The one that
[1:02:39] fulfills it. It is who? Christ. So if we
[1:02:42] could say that so say so would say that
[1:02:44] Christ might be fulfilled in us. That's
[1:02:47] how you would read that scripture. The
[1:02:49] righteousness of the law is Christ
[1:02:50] himself. So that Christ might be
[1:02:52] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:02:55] flesh but after the spirit. So Christ is
[1:02:57] trying to do something in us. It will
[1:02:59] happen in the flesh, but it's by the
[1:03:01] spirit that resides inside of the flesh.
[1:03:04] So don't focus so much on the flesh.
[1:03:05] Focus a lot more on the spirit and see
[1:03:07] what it will do with the flesh once you
[1:03:09] start doing that. So Paul's contrasting
[1:03:11] these two laws here. The law of sin and
[1:03:12] death, which we had the old way, the old
[1:03:14] law under Moses. Amen. And then the new
[1:03:17] law, which is the law of the spirit of
[1:03:19] life in Christ Jesus. Now, we've covered
[1:03:21] that law of sin and death, which was the
[1:03:23] law of Moses where the people wanted a
[1:03:25] way to make themselves acceptable. And
[1:03:27] so God said, "Here you go. Oh, here's a
[1:03:29] bunch of dos and don'ts. And what did it
[1:03:31] produce, church? Nothing. It produced
[1:03:35] dead religion. It produced people that
[1:03:37] thought they were good that weren't
[1:03:38] actually that good. It produced
[1:03:41] Saul. Saul, the the the persecutor I'm
[1:03:44] talking about
[1:03:45] now, a man that was sincere and
[1:03:49] dedicated to God, yet with an antichrist
[1:03:51] spirit because he got caught up in his
[1:03:53] own righteousness. Amen. It was too much
[1:03:56] for anyone to do all the time. And so in
[1:03:58] the end, they had a law they could not
[1:03:59] keep. And therefore, that law judged
[1:04:01] them and condemned them. And every
[1:04:03] single one under that law had to die at
[1:04:05] some point. But Paul says, "Now we're
[1:04:07] under a new law. There's a new sheriff
[1:04:09] in town." Amen. It's the law of the
[1:04:12] spirit of life. So you have to
[1:04:13] understand a law, church. A law makes
[1:04:17] requirements. And a law enforces
[1:04:20] itself. So when you're under the law of
[1:04:22] sin and death, then what does it
[1:04:24] enforce? Sin and death. When you're
[1:04:26] under a law of the spirit of life, then
[1:04:28] what does it enforce?
[1:04:31] Life. We've traded sin and death for
[1:04:33] life, church. That's a pretty good
[1:04:35] law. But it's not just a law that's
[1:04:38] sitting out there. Amen. This is a law
[1:04:40] that is insistent on producing what it
[1:04:43] says. You're under a requirement now to
[1:04:46] produce life by the spirit. Amen. The
[1:04:49] law of God is not Moses' law of dos and
[1:04:52] don'ts. The law of the spirit of life is
[1:04:54] saying, "You sit down and let me do it
[1:04:56] through you. You relax. You take your
[1:04:59] rest in Christ and let me work through
[1:05:01] you to produce myself."
[1:05:04] Amen. It's not a law of dos and don'ts.
[1:05:07] It's a It's a law of let go and let God
[1:05:09] have his wonderful way. It's a work that
[1:05:12] he's already declared to be done. He's
[1:05:14] just asking you to surrender to it, to
[1:05:16] believe it, to have faith, to act on it,
[1:05:18] and let him do what he said he was going
[1:05:20] to do. The purpose of this law is to
[1:05:23] bring life, not
[1:05:26] death. I love that. That what God has
[1:05:30] done for us, what God has done for you
[1:05:32] and I this morning is insistent on life
[1:05:35] inside of our lives. That's why Paul
[1:05:37] would say there's no condemnation now
[1:05:39] cuz we're under a spirit of life, not a
[1:05:41] spirit of death. There's a law that's
[1:05:44] working here. Now, we're surrounded by a
[1:05:46] law of the spirit of life. And it's
[1:05:48] contrary to the law of death that's
[1:05:50] working in our flesh. But because it is
[1:05:52] the new law, it
[1:05:54] circumc it it it
[1:05:57] uh what's the word I'm looking
[1:06:01] for?
[1:06:03] Supersedes. Remember when we set
[1:06:06] laws, you can bring a new law that
[1:06:08] supersedes the old law. And guess what?
[1:06:11] When the new law supersedes the old law,
[1:06:14] the old law has no
[1:06:16] power. So you can sit here this morning.
[1:06:18] What Paul's trying to do is he's trying
[1:06:20] to get us out of looking at the flesh
[1:06:22] and to look to the law of the spirit of
[1:06:24] life that's in us and say that law is
[1:06:26] the one I'm under this morning because
[1:06:29] otherwise the Satan will beat us up with
[1:06:30] the law of sin and death all day long.
[1:06:33] Absolutely he will. But he's trying to
[1:06:35] get us to see there's a law that
[1:06:36] supersedes it. You remember in the the
[1:06:39] lion, the witch in the wardrobe when the
[1:06:42] when the white witch killed Alan the
[1:06:44] lion and then he he resurrected and she
[1:06:48] said he said she was going by the law
[1:06:51] but there was an older law. There was a
[1:06:53] more ancient law. There was a law that
[1:06:55] supersedes her law that she didn't know
[1:06:57] about. That's what we're under this
[1:06:59] morning. We're under the original law.
[1:07:02] We're under the great promise to
[1:07:03] Abraham, to the royal seed of Abraham
[1:07:05] this morning. Amen.
[1:07:09] You look around the world today and that
[1:07:11] law of death is very evident because
[1:07:14] that is the law of good
[1:07:17] intentions of desires that people think
[1:07:20] are good and what does it produce every
[1:07:22] time? Sin and death because it's not
[1:07:25] according to the will or purpose of God.
[1:07:27] All it produces is is destruction. Amen.
[1:07:29] But to this person that's outside of
[1:07:31] these things, this child of God that's
[1:07:33] been born again, they're outside of that
[1:07:35] law. They're under a new law of the
[1:07:37] spirit of life. Amen. They've they're
[1:07:39] now being shown their position in
[1:07:41] Christ. They're now being shown their
[1:07:42] position in the word. They're now seeing
[1:07:44] the complete work of God in front of
[1:07:46] them and they're saying, "I'm stepping
[1:07:47] into it and I'm growing in it and I'm
[1:07:49] taking part of it and it's becoming me
[1:07:51] and I'm becoming it." There's a process
[1:07:54] that's going on in this redemption.
[1:07:56] Remember what Paul would say in
[1:07:57] Corinthians? He says, "The sting of
[1:07:58] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[1:08:02] the law." In other words, the only thing
[1:08:04] that gives the law or gives sin power in
[1:08:07] our lives is a law that says don't do it
[1:08:10] or a law that says you must do it and
[1:08:12] you don't do it. So without the law,
[1:08:14] there is no sin. Okay? So to set us free
[1:08:18] from sin, we have to be set free from
[1:08:20] the law. If the law is put away, then
[1:08:22] there is no sin. Amen. If the law
[1:08:24] doesn't apply to us, then sin has no
[1:08:26] power over us. If I could put it that
[1:08:28] way. He says, "But thanks be to God
[1:08:30] which giveth us the victory through our
[1:08:32] Lord Jesus Christ." So Paul comes along
[1:08:34] in Romans 8 as we've been reading. He
[1:08:36] says, "You're not under that law
[1:08:37] anymore. You have this daily fight and
[1:08:39] this sinful flesh is always trying to
[1:08:41] get what it wants, but you're under an
[1:08:43] overcoming law of life by the Holy
[1:08:46] Spirit. And it's a law that will change
[1:08:48] your situation." Amen. That's what we're
[1:08:50] sitting on this morning. Amen. So if
[1:08:52] we're under a new law, what happens to
[1:08:54] the sin law? It loses its power. It has
[1:08:57] no strength. It has no authority over
[1:08:59] us. So we don't have to look to it. We
[1:09:01] don't have to listen to it. And if
[1:09:03] somebody comes to us quoting the law of
[1:09:05] sin and death, we can say, "Sorry,
[1:09:07] that's been superseded this morning.
[1:09:09] You've got no rights to me, Satan. You
[1:09:11] can't get me that way." If you want some
[1:09:14] proof, let's take it to the scriptures
[1:09:15] because it all ties in to the the new
[1:09:17] birth and the indwelling of presence of
[1:09:19] God in our life by the Holy Spirit. Paul
[1:09:21] would say in 2 Corinthians, and this is
[1:09:23] the amplified version, I love this. He
[1:09:24] says, "Now the Lord is the spirit, and
[1:09:26] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:09:29] is liberty." He says, "It's emancipation
[1:09:32] from bondage and freedom." So, in other
[1:09:34] words, the shackles, the handcuffs that
[1:09:36] we used to have are taken off and the
[1:09:38] prison doors are open. You've been set
[1:09:41] free. Amen. But that's not it, church.
[1:09:43] It's not enough to be set free this
[1:09:45] morning. Because if you're set free,
[1:09:47] what happens is you walk out of jail and
[1:09:49] like half of the ones that come out of
[1:09:50] jail, you'll turn around, you'll do
[1:09:52] exactly what you did before and you'll
[1:09:53] end up right back in the jail. That's
[1:09:56] not true
[1:09:57] freedom. That's not liberty. That's just
[1:10:00] taking you out temporarily. But he's
[1:10:03] trying to do a liberating work, a life
[1:10:06] work. He says, "And in all of us as with
[1:10:10] unveiled face, because we continue to
[1:10:13] behold in the word of God as in an
[1:10:16] image, in a mirror, the glory of the
[1:10:19] Lord, we are constantly being
[1:10:21] transfigured into his very own image in
[1:10:26] everinccreasing splendor and from one
[1:10:29] degree of glory to another. For this
[1:10:32] comes from the Lord who is the spirit."
[1:10:36] This is the only privilege of a child of
[1:10:40] God is that you can look in the word of
[1:10:43] God. Amen. We look at this word and we
[1:10:46] see it and we see the attributes and the
[1:10:47] nature of God and what do we do? We read
[1:10:49] it and we accept it and we believe it
[1:10:52] and we eat it and what does it do? It
[1:10:54] starts to do a work inside of us. Amen.
[1:10:56] Because Paul says we don't look at these
[1:10:58] words just as theology or as doctrine or
[1:11:01] as stories, but we look at them as life
[1:11:04] because we've got a spirit of life
[1:11:06] inside of us. And so it takes those
[1:11:08] letters off of the page and we're not
[1:11:10] looking it as somebody else, but we're
[1:11:12] looking at it as a mirror and we're
[1:11:14] saying, "Lord, let what I am be
[1:11:16] reflected in what I see. Let me become
[1:11:19] what I'm reading." And so as we look, as
[1:11:22] we read, as we accept that word, it's
[1:11:24] doing a work in our life day by day. And
[1:11:27] we start to become the very thing that
[1:11:28] we're reading
[1:11:30] about. Why? Because Jesus said, "My
[1:11:32] words are spirit and they are life. They
[1:11:34] are not meant to stay on the page. They
[1:11:36] are meant to live in sons and daughters
[1:11:38] of God in the age."
[1:11:41] Amen. That's a process we're going
[1:11:43] through even this morning. Even this
[1:11:46] morning as part of this redemption
[1:11:47] process, we're under that new
[1:11:49] management. Amen. And we can see I'm
[1:11:50] free from the past. Some of us have
[1:11:53] worse pasts than the others. Let me tell
[1:11:55] you this morning, it matters not what
[1:11:56] your past is. You're free in Christ.
[1:11:58] Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. I've got
[1:12:01] plenty of things, church, I can be
[1:12:02] ashamed of this morning if I cast my
[1:12:03] memory back. But I'm not interested in
[1:12:05] casting my memory back. I'm interested
[1:12:07] in casting my memory way back to when I
[1:12:09] was a son of God. When the sons of God
[1:12:11] shouted for joy, way before I could ever
[1:12:14] sin, way before I could ever make
[1:12:16] mistakes. And so I take that and I say,
[1:12:18] I've got a sure end. If I was a child of
[1:12:20] God, I am a child of God and I've got to
[1:12:22] be returned back to God where I started
[1:12:24] from the beginning. Don't let Satan take
[1:12:26] you back just a couple days or a couple
[1:12:28] weeks or a couple years. Say, Satan, if
[1:12:30] we're going to go down memory lane,
[1:12:31] let's go all the way back and you'll
[1:12:34] find he doesn't like to talk about the
[1:12:35] real
[1:12:36] memories because the word is stirring
[1:12:38] something up inside you that reminds you
[1:12:40] of who you've been all along and what's
[1:12:42] coming out. Amen.
[1:12:44] Paul says, "The very glory of God is
[1:12:48] being revealed in you and I this
[1:12:50] morning." Sister Justine, the glory of
[1:12:52] God is being revealed in you this
[1:12:54] morning. You say, "I don't feel it,
[1:12:56] Brother John." That's why it's not about
[1:12:58] our feelings. Praise the
[1:12:59] Lord. It's not about our feelings. It's
[1:13:02] not about our thoughts. It's about what
[1:13:05] he said. It's about what he did. It's
[1:13:08] about what he's doing. Amen. Praise the
[1:13:10] Lord. Here's your law now. The spirit of
[1:13:13] life. All of this revolves around
[1:13:15] receiving the word of God and then the
[1:13:18] Holy Spirit taking that. Jesus said, he
[1:13:20] said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:13:22] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:13:25] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:13:28] and shall not come into condemnation,
[1:13:30] but has passed from death into life."
[1:13:31] Paul said, "There's no condemnation to
[1:13:33] them which are in Christ." Jesus says,
[1:13:35] "How do you pass beyond condemnation?"
[1:13:37] He says, "You've got to hear my word,
[1:13:38] and you've got to believe the one that
[1:13:40] sent that is sent." That's it.
[1:13:44] Because if you believe the word, you'll
[1:13:45] do what the word says. Brother Graham
[1:13:47] said, "If you really believed it, you do
[1:13:49] it." See, we sit here this morning, we
[1:13:51] say we believe. I was in there just
[1:13:54] praying this morning. I said, "Lord, I
[1:13:56] believe you're a healer, but help my
[1:13:57] unbelief for my eye cuz I believe he's a
[1:14:00] healer, but I need faith to act on it. I
[1:14:02] need faith to receive it this morning."
[1:14:05] He says, "He that hears my hears my word
[1:14:08] and believes on him that sent me shall
[1:14:10] not come into condemnation but his path
[1:14:11] from death into Christ." Amen. What
[1:14:13] happened? They heard the word. They
[1:14:15] believed the word. They acted on the
[1:14:17] word. They had faith in the word. And
[1:14:20] then God fulfilled his work. His word in
[1:14:22] each and every one of their lives.
[1:14:24] That's our part to take it. Amen. And
[1:14:26] they're beyond condemnation this
[1:14:28] morning. We're beyond condemnation
[1:14:29] because we've received the word as it
[1:14:32] came to us.
[1:14:33] God doesn't just dump it all in our lap,
[1:14:35] church. He gives us bit by bit so we can
[1:14:38] walk step by step by step with
[1:14:41] him. They're born again by the word. The
[1:14:44] disciples were born again by the word.
[1:14:45] We're born again by the word because
[1:14:47] they acted on what they heard. And
[1:14:49] that's always the sign of a true child
[1:14:50] of God. They can receive the word when
[1:14:53] it comes to them. That's why we don't
[1:14:55] worry when people come into our church.
[1:14:57] When people leave our church, it doesn't
[1:14:59] bother us because we can't convince them
[1:15:02] in. We can't keep them in. And we
[1:15:04] certainly can't keep them out if they're
[1:15:05] a child of God. It's the working of the
[1:15:08] spirit of God. There's got to be
[1:15:10] something in them to receive it in the
[1:15:11] first place. Otherwise, we'll just turn
[1:15:13] them into religious people. We don't
[1:15:14] want that. Amen. But a child of God can
[1:15:18] receive the word of God when it comes to
[1:15:20] them. John said, "He came unto his own
[1:15:24] and his own received him not." See,
[1:15:26] that's by the natur the natural. That's
[1:15:28] the Jews he's talking about. He says,
[1:15:30] "But as many as received him, to them
[1:15:33] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[1:15:36] even to them that believe on his name."
[1:15:38] So, you've got to receive the word
[1:15:40] before you can have the power. But the
[1:15:43] power is in them to receive. And if
[1:15:45] you've got power to receive, then you'll
[1:15:47] get the spirit in you that'll do the
[1:15:49] finishing work. The power is in the
[1:15:52] receiving, church. If you can receive,
[1:15:55] remember what Jesus said to them. They
[1:15:56] said, "We thought Elijah was supposed to
[1:15:58] come." He says, "If you can receive it,
[1:16:00] this is he of which the scripture
[1:16:03] said, right? If you can receive the
[1:16:06] words I'm telling you, then you'll get
[1:16:08] the benefit of the words. The word is
[1:16:11] the power. The spirit's the power. We're
[1:16:12] just the receivers for it. But you've
[1:16:14] got to have a receiver built in. And
[1:16:16] only children of God have a receiver for
[1:16:18] the word." And that's the most glorious
[1:16:20] thing that we have. You talk about
[1:16:21] privilege, that is a privilege because I
[1:16:23] didn't I didn't add it in. I didn't pay
[1:16:26] for that extra feature. I have it by his
[1:16:28] grace and mercy, his unmmerited favor,
[1:16:30] his predestinated plan for my life.
[1:16:32] Amen. But it's only the seed of God
[1:16:35] inside of you that can receive that word
[1:16:36] of God. And it was before the foundation
[1:16:38] of the world. He says, "Which were
[1:16:40] born." So these ones that received him,
[1:16:42] he says, "Which were born not of blood,
[1:16:45] nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
[1:16:47] will of man, but of God." So if we could
[1:16:49] summarize it which were born of God. So
[1:16:51] it's not mommy and daddy's birth that
[1:16:53] that that we have to worry about. It's
[1:16:55] not whether I was born from a one night
[1:16:57] stand or from a sanctified marriage.
[1:16:59] Doesn't matter where I come from. What
[1:17:01] matters is where is my origin? In the
[1:17:03] very beginning he says and you are born
[1:17:06] by God. You are born of God. You come
[1:17:09] from God. Amen. That's the birth that
[1:17:11] takes you out of the law of sin and
[1:17:12] death and takes you into the law of the
[1:17:14] spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Now,
[1:17:16] let's look at our position now. Let's
[1:17:18] look at what this looks like under the
[1:17:19] new birth. Cuz here's how God sees you.
[1:17:22] And church, what he sees is what counts.
[1:17:24] What he sees is what counts. What God
[1:17:26] judges is what matters. This world's got
[1:17:29] a lot of judgment going on these days.
[1:17:31] It doesn't matter at all. What God says
[1:17:34] is is what is. That's the only thing
[1:17:36] that's going to count in the end. First
[1:17:38] John 5, he says, "We know that whosoever
[1:17:41] is born of God sinnth not." We're
[1:17:44] talking about the church's victory.
[1:17:45] We're talking about the spirit, the
[1:17:47] love, the law of the spirit of life. We
[1:17:50] know that whosoever is born of God
[1:17:53] sinnth
[1:17:55] not. That ought to give one
[1:17:59] hallelujah. I think you're trying to
[1:18:01] absorb it this
[1:18:04] morning. No sin. Paul said there's no
[1:18:08] condemnation. We've moved beyond
[1:18:10] condemnation. Why? Because there is no
[1:18:12] sin.
[1:18:13] Why would I be condemned about something
[1:18:15] I don't have? But Satan tries to put it
[1:18:17] back on you. You need to point him to
[1:18:20] this church. Underline this. Put a star.
[1:18:22] Put your bookmark in there. And when
[1:18:24] Satan comes to you this evening or
[1:18:26] tomorrow, say, "Satan, we're going to
[1:18:27] read 1 John 5:18 together." And I'll
[1:18:31] tell you this, church, he won't want to
[1:18:32] stick around and read it. We know that
[1:18:35] whosoever is born of God sinnth not. But
[1:18:38] he that is begotten of God keepeth
[1:18:41] himself and that wicked one touches him
[1:18:44] not. And the amplified says God keeps
[1:18:46] and protects you. God's in the house.
[1:18:49] God's in the house. Amen. And he's there
[1:18:51] to protect against all comers. He says,
[1:18:53] "And we know that we are of God. We are
[1:18:56] born of God and the whole world lith in
[1:18:58] wickedness." He we go back a couple
[1:19:00] chapters. He said, "He that committh sin
[1:19:02] is of the devil, for the devil sinnth
[1:19:04] from the beginning. For this purpose,
[1:19:06] the son of God was manifested that he
[1:19:09] might destroy the works of the devil.
[1:19:11] Now remember, this is the purpose of
[1:19:12] Christ is to destroy all that Satan has
[1:19:15] brought in. All the chaos, all the hurt,
[1:19:17] all the pain, death, suffering, sin, all
[1:19:19] of these things, he came to destroy the
[1:19:21] works of the devil. Amen. Now, the new
[1:19:23] birth addresses our soul condition, but
[1:19:26] we still got a body condition that has
[1:19:27] to be
[1:19:30] rectified. So, he ain't done yet,
[1:19:32] church. I got the Holy Ghost. Doesn't
[1:19:34] matter. He's still got something else
[1:19:35] he's got to do cuz he's got to destroy
[1:19:38] the works of the devil. And Satan still
[1:19:40] has lots of run through this thing here
[1:19:43] cuz it's subject to a different
[1:19:44] spirit. It latches on easily. It's got
[1:19:48] to be overcome by the spirit of God in
[1:19:49] our life. But until this body is
[1:19:51] changed, the battle's on. It's game on.
[1:19:54] And we got to fight all the way to the
[1:19:56] end. He says, "So whosoever commits sin
[1:19:58] is of the devil." But then he says in
[1:20:00] verse 9, "Whosoever is born of God does
[1:20:04] not commit sin."
[1:20:08] Period. Doesn't commit
[1:20:11] sin. Can you imagine if I told if we
[1:20:13] told our youngest children, "No matter
[1:20:15] what you do, it's not
[1:20:18] sin." That's the golden ticket. That's
[1:20:20] the get out of jail free card for
[1:20:23] eternity. You know what they'd be doing?
[1:20:26] Nothing good. I'll tell you that.
[1:20:28] This is not a license to
[1:20:30] sin. This is reflective of the changing
[1:20:33] of the nature of your
[1:20:35] soul. Okay? Whosoever is born of God
[1:20:39] does not commit sin.
[1:20:43] Period. He says, "For his seed remainth
[1:20:46] in him and he cannot sin because he is
[1:20:50] born of God." The Amplified says this,
[1:20:52] "No one born of God sins for God's
[1:20:55] nature abides in him." him that it says
[1:20:57] in parenthesis his principle of life.
[1:21:00] What abides in you? His principle of
[1:21:02] life. The divine seed remains
[1:21:06] permanently within him and he cannot sin
[1:21:09] because he is born of God. I want to
[1:21:12] stop and preach this church. Can I
[1:21:13] preach it this morning? I want you to
[1:21:15] understand what this looks like this
[1:21:16] morning. Amen. I'm enjoying myself this
[1:21:19] morning. If nobody enjoys this service,
[1:21:20] I'm enjoying it this morning. Praise the
[1:21:22] Lord. This is where we're living. This
[1:21:25] is where we are this morning. And he
[1:21:27] says, "Whoever is born of God does not
[1:21:29] commit sin because the seed of God
[1:21:32] remains in you." This is the true
[1:21:34] reflection of the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:36] Spirit in your life. Amen. The truth of
[1:21:40] this is that it positions you with him
[1:21:42] in sinless perfection. Okay? And that
[1:21:46] sets you free to serve God completely
[1:21:49] and wholeheartedly, not based on works,
[1:21:52] but based on rest.
[1:21:55] I'm not trying to get in, church. I'm
[1:21:57] already in. I'm not trying to make it.
[1:22:00] I'm already there. So why do I
[1:22:03] worry? Why do I
[1:22:06] fear? Why do I
[1:22:08] struggle? In my soul, there ought to be
[1:22:10] none of those things. It's eternal rest.
[1:22:12] Because we are already done on a soul
[1:22:15] condition. Amen. It's a finished work.
[1:22:17] You're
[1:22:18] spotless. You're without spot or
[1:22:20] wrinkle. The scripture says you're
[1:22:22] sinless. You're blameless. You're
[1:22:24] accepted in the beloved. All right. Now,
[1:22:28] this is not coming in the rapture and
[1:22:29] the resurrection, church. Right now,
[1:22:31] this is what God sees you as. Okay? It's
[1:22:33] a finished work. But let's take it into
[1:22:36] time because we're creatures of time.
[1:22:37] We're looking from the eternal view. But
[1:22:38] you say, "Brother John, but we're in
[1:22:40] time. Let's look at what it means in
[1:22:42] time." Okay? Let's take it to our daily
[1:22:43] lives. He says, "Israel used to take the
[1:22:45] red heer and sacrifice her upon the
[1:22:48] altar for the remission of sins. And for
[1:22:50] a year, the sins of the guilty one were
[1:22:52] covered. But that covering could not
[1:22:54] take away the desire for sin. It was not
[1:22:56] a perfect offering. It was a shadow
[1:22:58] until the real came along. So each year
[1:23:00] the man would sacrifice and each year
[1:23:03] come back because he still had the same
[1:23:05] desire to sin. The life of the animal
[1:23:08] atone for his sin. But being animal
[1:23:10] blood that was shed and animal life that
[1:23:12] was given, it could not come back again
[1:23:14] upon the man. If it had come back, it
[1:23:17] still would not have availed. He says,
[1:23:19] "But when Christ, the perfect
[1:23:21] substitute, was given and his blood was
[1:23:23] shed, then the life that was in Christ,
[1:23:26] came back upon the repentant sinner. And
[1:23:29] that life being the perfect life of
[1:23:31] Christ, sinless and righteous, then the
[1:23:34] guilty one could go free, for he had no
[1:23:38] desire to sin." The life of Jesus had
[1:23:41] come back upon him. He says, "That is
[1:23:42] what is meant in Romans 8:2. The law of
[1:23:45] the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has
[1:23:47] made me free from the law and sin and
[1:23:49] death. Praise the Lord, church. Isn't
[1:23:51] that what we've received as believers
[1:23:52] this morning? If you've received the
[1:23:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you say, "My
[1:23:56] desires have been changed. My soul has a
[1:23:59] new condition." Amen. True freedom is
[1:24:02] not just being forgiven of your sins,
[1:24:04] but it's taking away the desire to sin
[1:24:06] in the first place. Otherwise, we're
[1:24:09] prone to go right back into what we came
[1:24:11] out of
[1:24:11] again. Like brother Barry said, "Go back
[1:24:15] to your
[1:24:16] smoking." Like the brother I talked
[1:24:18] about, the nameless brother that went
[1:24:22] and threw his TV in the trash after
[1:24:24] special meetings and then a few weeks
[1:24:26] later went out and bought a bigger and
[1:24:28] better
[1:24:28] one.
[1:24:30] Right? That's not liberty. That's just
[1:24:33] conviction that turns into
[1:24:37] condemnation. But we're looking for
[1:24:39] liberty where there's a change of the
[1:24:40] desire. And that's true liberty where I
[1:24:43] don't want it anymore. Amen. But you
[1:24:45] have to see something here, okay? Cuz
[1:24:47] that's not the all all there is to it.
[1:24:49] Not by a long shot. That's a wonderful
[1:24:51] thing. And we praise the Lord for that.
[1:24:54] But remember, we're in a process of
[1:24:55] redemption. We're in a process of full
[1:24:59] restoration. Not partial. God doesn't do
[1:25:02] halfway work, church. It's either
[1:25:04] everything or it's nothing. And so, he's
[1:25:07] taking us back into full redemption.
[1:25:09] Amen. So, we're being restored back to
[1:25:11] our original condition as children of
[1:25:13] God. That's what this whole process is
[1:25:16] about. Amen. We're made alive by the
[1:25:17] spirit of God to take the word and make
[1:25:19] it live in our life. Amen. And so, it
[1:25:21] brings our mind into into subjection. It
[1:25:24] brings our flesh into subjection by the
[1:25:26] power of the Holy Spirit. And it
[1:25:27] produces that character. It produces
[1:25:29] that that integrity of Christ inside of
[1:25:31] us so that we walk as he walked, talked
[1:25:33] as he talked, act as he acted, turn our
[1:25:36] cheek as he turned our as he turned his
[1:25:37] cheek. And then it makes us live as he
[1:25:40] lives. We don't have to scream and shout
[1:25:42] and holler to get him in the
[1:25:44] church. It's okay to scream and shout
[1:25:46] and holler. We encourage it. But it's
[1:25:49] not the screaming and shouting and
[1:25:50] hollering that gets him here because
[1:25:52] he's already here when you came to
[1:25:54] church. If you've received the spirit of
[1:25:56] God, you don't have to pull him down.
[1:25:58] You don't have to raise him up. He is
[1:26:00] with you when you came into this service
[1:26:02] this evening, this morning. Amen. He's
[1:26:05] always here to do the work that he
[1:26:07] promised to
[1:26:09] do. We don't have to go in and fast for
[1:26:13] days to reach God. Fasting's
[1:26:18] okay. Scriptural even. But that's not
[1:26:21] what gets us into the presence of God,
[1:26:23] church. He's with us, even in us right
[1:26:27] now. Amen. He's the strong man of the
[1:26:30] house now. He's the protector, the
[1:26:33] provider, the healer, the deliverer, the
[1:26:35] decision maker. All of these things,
[1:26:37] he's already here. Amen. He's our all in
[1:26:39] all. And the challenge we have is to let
[1:26:41] him do his work day by day. Just let him
[1:26:44] do the work.
[1:26:47] Amen. In John 10, Jesus said, "The thief
[1:26:50] cometh not, but for to steal and to kill
[1:26:54] and to destroy." He said, "I am come
[1:26:57] that they might have life and they might
[1:27:00] have it more abundantly." That word life
[1:27:02] is not life as we think of it. That's
[1:27:04] Zoey. That's God's life. That's eternal
[1:27:06] life. Amen. We don't receive Christ to
[1:27:08] have a good life. Can I put it that way?
[1:27:11] Not to be rich or famous or comfortable
[1:27:13] or or luxurious or sensual or any of
[1:27:15] these things. That is not the life that
[1:27:17] he's talking about. That's a satanic
[1:27:19] life because it leads to death, leads to
[1:27:21] destruction, it leads to hurt and pain.
[1:27:23] Amen. We're not here to make lots of
[1:27:25] money or or have great careers. We're
[1:27:27] here to present a living God. We're here
[1:27:29] to present a living God day by day. But
[1:27:31] when God comes down now, he says that
[1:27:34] they might have life and they might have
[1:27:36] it more abundantly. And so we see what
[1:27:38] happens through this is that when God
[1:27:40] comes down into a house or a vessel or a
[1:27:43] body is that where he dwells receives
[1:27:47] his attributes. Okay, this is what we're
[1:27:50] talking about. Amen. Listen to what
[1:27:51] Peter says. He says, "You are, you are a
[1:27:54] chosen generation. You are a royal
[1:27:56] priesthood. You are a holy nation.
[1:27:59] You're a peculiar people. You are
[1:28:00] chosen. You didn't choose him. He chose
[1:28:03] you. You are royal. You are coming from
[1:28:05] a king's lineup, a king's lineage." He
[1:28:08] says, "You are a holy nation." That
[1:28:10] means you are fit to be in his
[1:28:13] presence. He says, "Be holy as I am
[1:28:15] holy." Then he says, "You're a holy
[1:28:17] nation." Then he says, "You're a
[1:28:18] peculiar people." Peculiar doesn't go so
[1:28:20] well these days cuz peculiar we tend to
[1:28:23] look at as weird, different, strange.
[1:28:26] That word peculiar means made and
[1:28:30] preserved, a treasured possession. In
[1:28:33] other words, you are specifically made
[1:28:35] by God and he keeps you. You ever have
[1:28:38] somebody that uh sometimes we do with
[1:28:40] our kids, they bring home something that
[1:28:42] they make, their first sculpture, their
[1:28:44] first painting, their first drawing, and
[1:28:46] what do we do? We take it and we we put
[1:28:48] it up on our our fridge or something or
[1:28:51] or maybe we take up, you know, uh
[1:28:53] pottery or something and we make this
[1:28:55] lopsided vase. But you know what? We
[1:28:57] keep it cuz it's a peculiar treasure to
[1:28:59] us. It's our first one. When God makes
[1:29:02] it peculiar, it's not weird. It's not
[1:29:04] strange. It's not off. It's not flawed.
[1:29:06] It's perfect. But it's perfect to him.
[1:29:10] It's of his making. It's his doing. And
[1:29:12] he gets it right the first time. Amen.
[1:29:15] And so and then he says that you should
[1:29:17] show forth your why are we this way? He
[1:29:19] says that you should show forth the
[1:29:21] praises of him whoath called you out of
[1:29:23] darkness into his marvelous light. So
[1:29:24] when we are identified with Christ we're
[1:29:27] identified with his nature, with his
[1:29:30] attributes. Amen. It's not me. It's not
[1:29:33] you. It's him. I'm in him. He's in me.
[1:29:36] It's it's his identity that I'm getting
[1:29:38] the benefit of here now. Amen. Paul
[1:29:41] said, "The seed of God stays in you no
[1:29:44] matter what." See, it doesn't leave when
[1:29:47] we do bad and come back when we do good.
[1:29:49] Doesn't leave when we make mistakes and
[1:29:51] then come back when we make it right.
[1:29:52] The seed of God remains. Amen. The seed
[1:29:55] of God remains inside of you. Now, catch
[1:29:58] that result because the scripture says
[1:29:59] because you are born of God, because the
[1:30:02] seed of God remains in you, you cannot
[1:30:04] sin. Why? Because God is dwelling in you
[1:30:07] and God cannot dwell in sin. God is
[1:30:09] outside of sin and so where God dwells
[1:30:12] itself must have to be sinless. God is
[1:30:15] holy so where God dwells must be holy.
[1:30:17] God is perfect so where God dwells must
[1:30:19] be perfect. So where the presence and
[1:30:21] dwelling place of God is it must by its
[1:30:24] nature be sinless, perfect and holy.
[1:30:27] That's the judgment of God of the
[1:30:29] situation. If he is there, then it must
[1:30:32] be as he is.
[1:30:35] If he's in you, then it must be because
[1:30:37] you are as he is in his estimation, in
[1:30:41] his judgment, in his eyes. Amen.
[1:30:43] Therefore, the very presence of the
[1:30:44] spirit of God living inside you declares
[1:30:47] you to be as he
[1:30:51] is. That's what Paul's saying. He's
[1:30:53] saying because the seed of God is in
[1:30:55] you, it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:30:57] says, the seed can only remain because
[1:31:00] there is no
[1:31:02] sin. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:06] He'll never leave me. He'll never
[1:31:08] forsake me. He'll be with me even to the
[1:31:11] end of the age. Why? Because the blood
[1:31:14] of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. He
[1:31:18] looks through the blood. And then we are
[1:31:20] what? Baptized into Christ by the
[1:31:22] spirit. And so what does he see now? He
[1:31:24] doesn't see Bob Coffee anymore. He sees
[1:31:26] Jesus Christ. He sees Jesus Christ. He
[1:31:29] sees Jesus Christ. He sees Jesus Christ.
[1:31:31] That's what I said. It's not me, it's
[1:31:32] him. Because I'm in Christ and Christ is
[1:31:34] in me. I'm surrounded. I'm enveloped in
[1:31:36] the spirit of Christ himself. And so he
[1:31:38] can't see anything else but Christ. I'm
[1:31:40] hidden in Christ. Paul would say hidden.
[1:31:44] I can't be seen. There are some
[1:31:45] impossibilities for God. Church. You say
[1:31:48] God can do anything. God can't see
[1:31:50] anything you do wrong because of the
[1:31:53] blood of Christ. And God can only see
[1:31:55] your perfection because you are in
[1:31:58] Christ. That's the way God sees it this
[1:32:00] morning. Amen.
[1:32:05] The spirit of God living inside of you
[1:32:07] declares your condition to be as
[1:32:11] God. That choke a
[1:32:14] mule. Where are we at this morning? I
[1:32:16] say we're living below our privileges.
[1:32:18] Church, God help us. God help us to to
[1:32:22] walk in the reality of how he sees us.
[1:32:25] not in pride but in humility for the
[1:32:29] grace of God that he would condescend to
[1:32:32] work in this little group and these
[1:32:35] little people and we are little people.
[1:32:40] Amen. Listen, the world might not
[1:32:42] realize it. I think sometimes we don't
[1:32:44] realize it and I don't believe we
[1:32:45] realize it fully,
[1:32:48] church, what it means to have the spirit
[1:32:50] of God, but we know it. We know it
[1:32:54] because it's not just a feeling because
[1:32:56] the feelings come and go. It's not just
[1:32:58] an anointing because anointings come and
[1:33:00] go. But it's the inddwelling permanent
[1:33:03] presence of God in the believer's life.
[1:33:06] That is the law of the spirit of life.
[1:33:09] It's the presence of God inside of us.
[1:33:11] Amen. It's almighty God residing in your
[1:33:14] soul. He says the seed of this life must
[1:33:16] be planted in the earth of this body
[1:33:18] that is a perishable seed. And the life
[1:33:20] of its a perverted life in the seed, it
[1:33:22] perishes with the seed. He says, "This
[1:33:23] body, if it doesn't have the life of God
[1:33:25] in it, it just
[1:33:27] dies." He says, "But he put eternal life
[1:33:30] into it and identified it as his own,
[1:33:32] that in the resurrection, he'd raise it
[1:33:34] up again and nothing will be lost." He
[1:33:36] says, "Do you see what I mean? There it
[1:33:38] is. We cannot perish." Now, the life
[1:33:40] lays over it. It's a token that lays
[1:33:42] over that little body that lays over
[1:33:44] that soul of that person. There's a
[1:33:46] token over there, the Holy Spirit, that
[1:33:49] it belongs to God. It's his. He says,
[1:33:52] "When I see the token, I'll pass over
[1:33:54] you." A positive token. The Holy Spirit
[1:33:56] is our token. Therefore, when you
[1:33:58] receive the Holy Ghost, you pass from
[1:34:00] death to life. That's all there is to
[1:34:02] it. Cuz life is in you. You can no more
[1:34:04] perish. The Bible said, "He that's born
[1:34:07] of God does not commit sin, for he
[1:34:09] cannot sin, for the seed of God remains
[1:34:11] in him." He says, "And how can he sin
[1:34:14] when the sinless God is in him?" He
[1:34:16] says, "When he's in a sinless God, how
[1:34:18] can he sin?" No matter what he's done,
[1:34:21] the blood's covered him. See, he's a new
[1:34:23] creature now. His desires and ambitions
[1:34:26] are of heaven because he's changed from
[1:34:28] a cockleber to a wheat. His desires
[1:34:30] aren't the same as they once were. And
[1:34:32] he displays it. You say, "Brother John,
[1:34:34] I don't feel that way this morning."
[1:34:36] Good. Cuz like I said, it's not about
[1:34:38] your feelings. Remember, God was housed
[1:34:40] behind badger skins in the Holy of
[1:34:43] Holies. Guess what? The badger skins
[1:34:45] felt like dead badger skins. The
[1:34:48] presence of God never changed the
[1:34:50] feeling of the badger
[1:34:52] skin. Don't look at the badger skin this
[1:34:55] morning. He's saying look to the God
[1:34:57] inside the badger skin. Cuz a badger
[1:35:00] skin is always going to feel like a
[1:35:01] badger skin until it's glorified. But in
[1:35:04] the meantime, look to the God that
[1:35:06] dwells within and say, "God, if you are
[1:35:08] here, I'm perfect in your sight and I
[1:35:10] want to walk according to that which
[1:35:11] you've declared about me." Amen.
[1:35:15] You have been judged by God. And by
[1:35:18] putting the spirit of himself inside of
[1:35:20] you, he declares you perfect this
[1:35:22] morning. Perfect. Sinless, spotless,
[1:35:26] without blame, without condemnation,
[1:35:28] without
[1:35:30] fault. Your slate's
[1:35:33] clean. To the contrary, you're found
[1:35:35] walking in light, led by the spirit
[1:35:38] according to the word. That's where you
[1:35:40] are this morning, whether you feel it or
[1:35:43] not.
[1:35:45] cuz we don't feel it a lot of times. But
[1:35:47] that's the badger skin. Don't look at
[1:35:49] the badger skin. Look what's behind the
[1:35:50] badger
[1:35:51] skin. We read the scripture last
[1:35:53] service. We're going to read it again in
[1:35:54] a future service. He says, "For by one
[1:35:57] offering he
[1:35:59] had he will
[1:36:02] perfect. He has finished work." He had
[1:36:06] perfected for how long? Until I mess up.
[1:36:10] Till I say something I shouldn't. Till I
[1:36:12] don't say something I should have
[1:36:14] said. Till I make a wrong
[1:36:17] decision. Till I fail. Till I fall. Till
[1:36:20] I lie. Till I
[1:36:23] disappoint. Till I act on frustration.
[1:36:25] No. He hath perfected
[1:36:29] forever them that are sanctified.
[1:36:31] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[1:36:33] to us. After that he had said before. So
[1:36:36] what is the Holy Spirit a witness of?
[1:36:38] That you are perfected forever. that
[1:36:41] this is the covenant that I will make
[1:36:42] with them after those days, sayeth the
[1:36:44] Lord. I will put my laws into their
[1:36:46] hearts, and in their minds will I write
[1:36:48] them, and their sins and iniquities will
[1:36:50] I remember no more. There is therefore
[1:36:52] now no
[1:36:53] condemnation. He can't remember it. You
[1:36:56] need to forget about it. Let it go. He
[1:37:00] says, "Now where remission of these is,
[1:37:01] there's no more offering for sin." He
[1:37:03] says, "Where the sin is taken away,
[1:37:04] where the sin is completely erased, you
[1:37:06] don't have to keep going back. You don't
[1:37:09] have to keep coming to the altar,
[1:37:10] whether it's here, whether it's the
[1:37:12] altar of your heart, whether it's at
[1:37:13] your bedside at night. You don't have to
[1:37:14] keep coming to him for forgiveness for
[1:37:16] something you've already repented of.
[1:37:18] It's done. It's passed away. It's gone.
[1:37:21] He says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[1:37:22] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:37:24] the blood of Jesus by a new and living
[1:37:28] way." This is the law of the spirit of
[1:37:30] life in Christ Jesus. By a new and
[1:37:32] living way, which he hath consecrated
[1:37:33] for us through the veil, that is to say
[1:37:36] say his flesh. He says, "Once, for by
[1:37:39] one sacrifice has he perfected forever
[1:37:41] those that are sanctified in Christ
[1:37:42] Jesus. Once for all. No more coming
[1:37:44] back. No more going this. No more doing
[1:37:46] that." He says, "Oh, you'll backslide.
[1:37:48] Do things that's
[1:37:50] wrong." Badger skin.
[1:37:53] See, he says, "Just repent and come on."
[1:37:57] He says, "See, but one time Christ
[1:37:59] sanctifies a
[1:38:01] human
[1:38:03] body." No, no, no. sanctifies a human
[1:38:07] soul. He says by filling him with the
[1:38:10] Holy Spirit, it's perfected forever.
[1:38:13] What? The soul. We've got to look at
[1:38:16] what God's looking at, church. Look at
[1:38:19] what God's looking at. He says, "There
[1:38:21] you are. No more desire to go out. For
[1:38:23] the worshipper once purged, had no more
[1:38:25] conscience or desire of sin. Never." He
[1:38:27] says, "It's settled forever. For he has
[1:38:29] perfected by one sacrifice forever those
[1:38:32] that are in Christ Jesus." The world
[1:38:34] becomes dead. You don't care for it
[1:38:36] anymore. Your affections are on things
[1:38:38] above. So it's a reflection now. This
[1:38:40] perfection is of your soul condition,
[1:38:44] not this body condition. Amen. Because
[1:38:46] the soul is the dwelling place of God.
[1:38:48] It happens to be wrapped up in this
[1:38:51] flesh. But this flesh can pass away and
[1:38:53] the spirit of God will still be in your
[1:38:55] soul. He's not looking at the body.
[1:38:58] Amen. He's looking at the soul. And the
[1:38:59] spirit of God, the Holy Spirit is in
[1:39:01] you, unchanging, constant, no matter
[1:39:05] what. You can lose the feeling of it.
[1:39:07] You can lose the emotion of it. You can
[1:39:10] lose the sensation of it, but you cannot
[1:39:12] lose
[1:39:13] it. Remember what David said, "Restore
[1:39:15] to me the joy of my salvation." He
[1:39:16] didn't lose his salvation. He had lost
[1:39:18] that feeling of being saved. Listen, I
[1:39:22] want to feel like I'm saved, but my rest
[1:39:23] is not in my feeling. My rest is in the
[1:39:26] finished work of Calvary. Amen. We've
[1:39:28] still got to deal with the desires of
[1:39:30] this flesh as we spoke last service. But
[1:39:31] on the inside, God's dwelling and he's
[1:39:33] saying, "It's already done. I'm already
[1:39:36] here. You're perfected forever. You're
[1:39:38] ready to go. If you were to die today,
[1:39:41] you'd be there. You'll be into what?
[1:39:46] Eternity in a special body waiting to
[1:39:50] come back in the resurrection, pick this
[1:39:51] one up, glorify it, and move on.
[1:39:54] All that's left, church, is this little
[1:39:56] walk through time we call life to prove
[1:39:58] out what God's been doing all along.
[1:40:01] That's our life. That's our day-to-day
[1:40:03] walk. Amen. It starts in your soul, but
[1:40:05] that's not the end of the working of
[1:40:07] God. As we talked about last service,
[1:40:08] not by a long shot. The soul's the
[1:40:10] eternal part. That's what God's coming
[1:40:11] for. But you cannot have an eternal life
[1:40:14] of God inside of you and it not have an
[1:40:16] effect on this life today. Cuz Jesus
[1:40:18] said, "I came that they might have life
[1:40:19] and that more abundantly." It's got to
[1:40:21] bleed out. It's got to produce something
[1:40:23] in this flesh. Amen. It's the power of
[1:40:25] the Holy Spirit producing life through
[1:40:27] this even fleshly body. That's what he's
[1:40:30] trying to do. Bringing this body into
[1:40:32] subjection. Bringing this mind into
[1:40:34] subjection so that Christ could be
[1:40:36] revealed all over again. Why? Cuz God
[1:40:39] never does a halfway work. He's here to
[1:40:42] do the full
[1:40:43] redeeming. Amen.
[1:40:47] It's that full
[1:40:48] adoption, which is our body being
[1:40:51] redeemed and put into a condition that
[1:40:52] matches our soul condition. That's what
[1:40:54] we're looking for. But God doesn't start
[1:40:57] and then stop because he loses interest
[1:40:59] or because the clay fails as clay is
[1:41:02] prone to do. No, he keeps working until
[1:41:05] it's exactly the way he intended. How
[1:41:08] does he do it? By the word. By the word.
[1:41:12] Paul said this in Philippians. He says,
[1:41:13] "Being confident of this very thing,
[1:41:15] that he which had begun a good work in
[1:41:18] you will perform it until the day of
[1:41:20] Jesus Christ." What's that day, church?
[1:41:22] It's when he comes back for his bride.
[1:41:24] And he's not coming for a halfway
[1:41:26] finished scandalized bride. He's coming
[1:41:29] for a mature bride that has received the
[1:41:31] word and has wrapped herself in him.
[1:41:33] That's what he's coming back for. He's
[1:41:36] not coming back for a half-finish bride.
[1:41:38] He's coming back for a completed,
[1:41:40] finished work. Amen.
[1:41:43] She's perfect. When he comes back, he
[1:41:46] says, "But the law of the spirit of God
[1:41:48] is to force Satan to give up that which
[1:41:51] he has unrightfully, deceitfully taken
[1:41:54] from
[1:41:55] God." He says, "Sounds souls of men he
[1:41:58] took from God, souls of women, children.
[1:42:01] Sickness of the body he placed upon
[1:42:03] people where God made them in his image
[1:42:05] to be like him. And the church, he said,
[1:42:07] is given the rightful legal rights by
[1:42:10] the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and
[1:42:12] enforce this upon him. That's the full
[1:42:15] redemption story and process. Amen. The
[1:42:17] soul has already been redeemed, but it's
[1:42:20] looking forward. It's groaning for the
[1:42:21] day of full redemption when this body
[1:42:23] now becomes subject to the law of the
[1:42:25] spirit of life the way the soul has. Cuz
[1:42:28] that's when death will be swallowed up
[1:42:29] in victory, Paul says. Amen. But there's
[1:42:33] this great battle that's going on now.
[1:42:35] It's a battle between the spirit of God
[1:42:37] from our soul taking back that which is
[1:42:39] still in the flesh. This flesh is full
[1:42:42] of disobedience. I don't know if you've
[1:42:44] noticed lately. It is very
[1:42:47] disobedient. Doesn't listen. Doesn't
[1:42:49] like to
[1:42:51] listen. Maybe it's just
[1:42:53] mine. But it's not fun to be
[1:42:56] in. He says he's here to take back
[1:43:01] everything. Everything.
[1:43:04] See, don't look at the circumstance.
[1:43:07] Look at what's on the title deed. That's
[1:43:09] where we want to look. What belonged to
[1:43:12] him in the beginning, church. And I'll
[1:43:14] tell you this, for the believer, it's
[1:43:16] body, its soul, and its spirit. It's all
[1:43:20] of him. And so, he's coming back to
[1:43:22] redeem the whole package. Amen. And
[1:43:24] Satan's been trying to hold on to these
[1:43:25] things for 6,000 years. And guess what?
[1:43:29] We're in the final age where God says,
[1:43:31] "I'm taking it all back.
[1:43:34] What is it? It's the second
[1:43:37] exodus. It's the second exodus.
[1:43:40] Everywhere that the soul of your foot
[1:43:41] shall tread belongs to you. And so we
[1:43:45] walk through the word. And we walk
[1:43:47] through the word. And we say, "Hey,
[1:43:49] that's me. That's mine." This is our
[1:43:51] title deed this morning, church.
[1:43:53] Whatever he says here, every redemptive
[1:43:54] blessing belongs to the church,
[1:43:57] including your position in Christ. The
[1:43:59] privilege of being a son and daughter of
[1:44:00] God. Amen. We're in a body that wants to
[1:44:02] be selfish, that wants to feel good,
[1:44:04] wants things that are sensual and
[1:44:06] pleasurable. Absolutely it
[1:44:09] does. We're want We're in a body that
[1:44:11] wants to ease
[1:44:13] up. Isn't that the nature of Leodysia?
[1:44:16] The final church age is to what? Ease
[1:44:19] up. Lose our
[1:44:22] fervor. Lose our fervor.
[1:44:25] Compromise. Be religious.
[1:44:29] Just get us to the place where we can
[1:44:31] check the box off that we've satisfied
[1:44:32] God this week. That ain't the Christian
[1:44:35] walk, church. Remember what we read? In
[1:44:37] him we live and move and have our being.
[1:44:41] It's all Christ. Amen. It's not
[1:44:44] lukewarm. It's not compromised. There's
[1:44:47] a spirit of God inside of us that's
[1:44:49] saying, "Take it
[1:44:50] back." Not me rising up. Church, if this
[1:44:52] was about hype, this eye would be it
[1:44:54] would be healed today. It's not about
[1:44:56] hype. It's not about working it up or
[1:44:57] taking it down. It's about saying,
[1:45:00] "Lord, what do you want done? What's
[1:45:03] your time? What's your season? What's my
[1:45:05] part in it?" And then, "Lord, have your
[1:45:08] way. Have your way." And just resting
[1:45:10] and trusting.
[1:45:12] Amen. We read the scriptures and it
[1:45:15] ought to raise a standard in our
[1:45:17] life. I'm not talking just about
[1:45:19] clothing standards or but to raise up
[1:45:21] the standard to have faith and believe
[1:45:24] to say, "Lord, I'm identifying with your
[1:45:25] word. Lord, I'm looking into your word
[1:45:27] as a mirror." this morning because I
[1:45:30] need to be what it says right
[1:45:32] there. I need to be an overcomer. I need
[1:45:35] to be
[1:45:36] healed. I need to have grace. I need to
[1:45:39] have patience. I need to turn the other
[1:45:41] cheek today, Lord. Lord, I need an
[1:45:44] attitude adjustment and your word shows
[1:45:46] me what I'm supposed to be like. Lord,
[1:45:48] let me mirror what I'm reading this
[1:45:49] morning, what I'm hearing this morning
[1:45:51] in our life. Amen. It's got to be an
[1:45:53] uncction of the Holy Spirit that takes
[1:45:55] that and says, "This is for you.
[1:45:57] And let me tell you, church, if you're a
[1:45:59] child of God, there's nothing in there
[1:46:00] that's not meant for you when it comes
[1:46:02] to the promises of God. We'll close on
[1:46:05] these two quotes this
[1:46:07] morning. He says, "And if Satan has
[1:46:09] robbed you of the
[1:46:11] privilege of being a son or a daughter
[1:46:13] of God, we have a right this morning by
[1:46:15] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of
[1:46:18] God." He didn't say if he's deprived you
[1:46:20] of being a son of God or a daughter of
[1:46:22] God. He says the privilege. We have a
[1:46:25] lot of talk about privilege. these days,
[1:46:27] don't we, church? We're privileged this
[1:46:31] morning. Not because we're white or
[1:46:33] black or East
[1:46:38] Indian. We're privileged because we're
[1:46:40] sons and daughters of
[1:46:41] God. But we're not here to just walk in
[1:46:44] because we're a child of God. We're here
[1:46:46] to walk in fully redeemed. The full
[1:46:49] benefit of what he did at Calvary.
[1:46:52] That's what we're here for. He says,
[1:46:54] "Bring them back. If he's afflicted you
[1:46:56] and made you sick, we have a right
[1:46:58] before God to enforce the laws of God.
[1:47:00] By his stripes, we are healed. Amen.
[1:47:02] Bring him back. Turn him loose. You're
[1:47:03] taking him out yonder of death. And we
[1:47:06] claim him. Bring him back. Now, he says,
[1:47:08] "That's the enforcement. Restore it back
[1:47:11] to its natural condition." Again, a man
[1:47:14] is sick, a baby sick, a woman sick. See,
[1:47:16] they're out of their natural condition.
[1:47:17] I was listening to Brother Brandham
[1:47:18] yesterday morning and he said, "No, yes,
[1:47:20] it was yesterday morning." And he said,
[1:47:22] uh, I think he said Becky or or one of
[1:47:24] the the kids, he said she was up all
[1:47:27] through night with a fever. Okay, this
[1:47:29] is a prophet of God telling the story.
[1:47:30] You'd say just go lay your hands on her.
[1:47:32] He says she was up all night screaming
[1:47:34] and screaming, keeping us up. But he
[1:47:38] says, then I went in this morning cuz it
[1:47:40] was a Sunday morning. He said, "And we
[1:47:42] need to go to church." He says, "And so
[1:47:44] I went in." He says, "I laid hands on
[1:47:46] her." He said, "Satan, you can't have
[1:47:47] her this morning. We're taking her
[1:47:48] back." He says, "And she got up right
[1:47:50] away." And he says, "She's sitting at
[1:47:51] the back of the church this morning just
[1:47:52] as good as good can be." Why? There's an
[1:47:56] enforcer. Not for a life of
[1:47:59] ease. A life to do what the word
[1:48:02] requires us to do. Amen. Not just to
[1:48:05] make it easy for us, not just to to make
[1:48:07] life, not just to simplify life for us,
[1:48:10] but to say, "Lord, I'm in obedience to
[1:48:13] your word, and we need you to step in
[1:48:16] and prove it." That's it. That's it.
[1:48:19] just in simple faith say Lord I'm taking
[1:48:22] you at your word and then he says the
[1:48:24] Holy Spirit came and it
[1:48:26] enforced and it healed her immediately.
[1:48:28] He says she popped right up and she's
[1:48:30] sitting there good as gold. He says then
[1:48:33] we have a right to enforce our claim.
[1:48:35] Now catch this. He says it's not our
[1:48:38] claim. It's our claim because God gave
[1:48:41] it to us. See we don't make up
[1:48:44] things. That's what prosperity gospel
[1:48:46] is.
[1:48:47] Whatever you ask, you'll receive. But
[1:48:50] then I think it was John would come by
[1:48:51] and say, "If we ask anything according
[1:48:53] to his will, he'll hear us and we'll
[1:48:56] receive it." See, the key is to catch
[1:48:58] the mind of God, not to just go in with
[1:49:00] the desire. But if you have the mind of
[1:49:02] God, your desires will be his desires
[1:49:04] and he'll get he's more than willing to
[1:49:05] give you what he wants because it's not
[1:49:07] your desire now, it's his living through
[1:49:09] you. He says it's our claim because God
[1:49:11] gave it to us. By his stripes, we were
[1:49:14] healed. He was wounded for our
[1:49:16] transgression and with his stripes we
[1:49:18] were healed. He said now we have a right
[1:49:20] to enforce that law and the lawgiver,
[1:49:23] the Holy Spirit himself is here, the
[1:49:25] agent of God to see that it's done that
[1:49:29] way. It's the law of the spirit of
[1:49:33] life. What is it to restore you back to
[1:49:36] your natural original
[1:49:40] condition? He says, "Amen." Now, the
[1:49:42] only way he can work is when you let him
[1:49:46] work. What's our job, church? Let go and
[1:49:48] let God have his way. Surrender. Find
[1:49:51] his will and walk in it in full
[1:49:53] confidence that he'll take us through.
[1:49:55] He says, "See, you've got to believe
[1:49:58] there's a law." Amen. God bless you.
[1:50:01] Let's stand if we
[1:50:02] would. Amen. We have a privilege as
[1:50:04] children of God. And that privilege is
[1:50:07] to take the word of God and see it do
[1:50:10] exactly what it says it would do. It's
[1:50:13] the only people in this world that will
[1:50:15] have that privilege to have God move on
[1:50:18] our behalf because we're a part of that
[1:50:22] word. We underestimate I think I
[1:50:25] underestimate maybe I'll say it that
[1:50:27] way what we have in these earthn
[1:50:30] vessels.
[1:50:32] When God comes and dwells, when God's in
[1:50:35] the
[1:50:37] house, church, he's there to perfect the
[1:50:40] whole
[1:50:41] thing. He's there to have dominion over
[1:50:44] the whole thing. He's there to work in
[1:50:46] the whole thing, flaws and all. He's
[1:50:50] here to redeem it fully
[1:50:52] back and restore back to his presence
[1:50:56] into perfect position as sons and
[1:50:57] daughters of God. Amen. The law of the
[1:51:01] spirit of life will bring you back into
[1:51:03] the presence of God and it'll keep you
[1:51:05] there for eternity. That's what we're
[1:51:07] restored back to this morning. Listen, I
[1:51:10] want healing for my eye this morning.
[1:51:12] But what I want more than that is I want
[1:51:13] to be in his presence day in and day out
[1:51:17] for eternity where there is total rest.
[1:51:20] See, I might have rest in my soul, but
[1:51:22] this body it has no rest. Can anybody
[1:51:25] turn their body off? Turn off the
[1:51:28] desires. Turn off the wants. Turn off
[1:51:30] the
[1:51:31] dreams. You can't help it. And there's
[1:51:34] no rest because there's always that
[1:51:35] struggle, that back and forth. But we're
[1:51:37] going to a time and a place of perfect
[1:51:39] rest. Amen. Where the body, the soul,
[1:51:41] and the spirit are completely back in
[1:51:43] unity with God. That's what I want this
[1:51:47] morning. Sometimes I think we get sick
[1:51:49] so that we can want to leave
[1:51:51] here. Sometimes I think we get hardship
[1:51:53] so that we can realize this really isn't
[1:51:55] my home. This isn't my place. This isn't
[1:51:58] my full purpose. I've got something
[1:52:00] beyond that's even greater than that.
[1:52:02] Amen. Let go. Let God have his way this
[1:52:05] morning.
[1:52:07] Trust. If you know you've got the spirit
[1:52:09] of God, if you know that you know that
[1:52:12] you
[1:52:13] know, what can't he and won't he do in
[1:52:16] our lives this morning? Amen. God bless
[1:52:19] you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:52:22] Father, Lord, how wonderful it is to be
[1:52:24] under a different law this morning.
[1:52:27] Lord, not a law of dos and don'ts, Lord,
[1:52:30] but a law of the spirit of Christ inside
[1:52:33] of us that makes us want what you want,
[1:52:35] that makes us do what you do, Lord, that
[1:52:38] changes our thoughts, that changes our
[1:52:40] attitudes, that changes our actions,
[1:52:42] that takes the very desires of this
[1:52:44] flesh and brings them subject to your
[1:52:45] spirit by your word, Lord God.
[1:52:49] Lord, we have many needs. We're in many
[1:52:52] battles this morning. Lord, you see our
[1:52:55] weak. You saw where we won. You saw
[1:52:58] where we lost. Lord, you see where we're
[1:53:03] struggling, Lord. But there's a spirit
[1:53:05] of the law of the law of the spirit,
[1:53:08] Lord, of life inside of us that's here
[1:53:10] to remedy every
[1:53:13] situation, Lord. And it comes not by
[1:53:15] looking at this flawed flesh, Lord, this
[1:53:17] badger skin that surrounds it, Lord. But
[1:53:20] it comes by looking at us through the
[1:53:21] word and the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:53:24] Lord, to see exactly what it is that you
[1:53:26] think about us. To see exactly what
[1:53:28] you're doing in our lives, Lord, to see
[1:53:30] the very desires, Lord, that you had
[1:53:32] before the world began to produce a
[1:53:34] bride, a family that is just like
[1:53:37] you. Lord, your spirit's here to destroy
[1:53:40] the works of the devil. Lord, it's got
[1:53:42] to start on the
[1:53:44] inside. Lord, we've got to receive you
[1:53:46] before we can ever get the working of
[1:53:48] you in our lives. Lord, if there's any
[1:53:50] here, Lord, there are I know that need
[1:53:53] your spirit this morning, Lord. I pray
[1:53:54] that they would reach out and ask, Lord,
[1:53:57] that they would come according to your
[1:53:58] word, Lord. That as they fulfilled it,
[1:54:01] Lord, you would fulfill your portion.
[1:54:03] Lord, that you would fill them with your
[1:54:05] spirit. Lord, help us not to live under
[1:54:08] our privileges this morning. Lord, let
[1:54:10] us live by faith with
[1:54:12] expectation, Lord. Just trusting that
[1:54:14] you do all things well, Lord. That
[1:54:17] you're with us, you're in us, Lord.
[1:54:18] You'll never leave us. You'll never
[1:54:20] forsake us, Lord. That this is a
[1:54:22] finished work, Lord, that's been brought
[1:54:24] down into time to play out. Lord, help
[1:54:27] us to see we're close to the finish
[1:54:29] line. Help us press towards the mark.
[1:54:32] Lord, give us strength, Lord. Grant us
[1:54:34] grace. Grace for each other, grace for
[1:54:36] ourselves as well. Heavenly Father,
[1:54:39] Lord, that we'd see, Lord, perfect
[1:54:41] forgiveness and redemption through your
[1:54:44] blood. Bless your people now this
[1:54:46] morning. We pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:54:49] we ask it.
[1:55:04] Amen. He's in the house.
[1:55:11] 11:37 Little was lying there. The people
[1:55:16] all were
[1:55:19] weeping. They just laughed at Jesus when
[1:55:23] he said she's only
[1:55:27] sleeping. And as he took her by the
[1:55:31] hand, well, she began to live again.
[1:55:36] Some began to praise the Lord and some
[1:55:41] began to
[1:55:43] say he's in the
[1:55:47] house. Oh, death has to
[1:55:51] flee. Now there is
[1:55:55] life where darkness used to
[1:55:59] be. Now there is hope.
[1:56:04] There's no more
[1:56:07] doubt. Praise his
[1:56:11] name. Praise his
[1:56:15] name. He's in the
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:21] house. And we were like that little girl
[1:56:26] dead in all our
[1:56:29] sins. till Jesus touched this heart of
[1:56:33] mine and gave me life
[1:56:37] again. Oh, I am just a house of
[1:56:41] plague. But ever since that blessed
[1:56:46] day, there's a light that shines in me
[1:56:50] for all the world to see.
[1:56:55] is in the
[1:56:57] house. Death has to
[1:57:01] flee. Now there is
[1:57:04] light where darkness used to be.
[1:57:10] Now there is
[1:57:13] hope. There's no more
[1:57:17] doubt. Praise his name.
[1:57:22] Praise his
[1:57:25] name. He's in the
[1:57:28] house. So death has to
[1:57:33] flee. Now there is
[1:57:36] life where darkness used to
[1:57:41] be. Now there is
[1:57:44] hope. There's no more
[1:57:48] doubt. Praise his
[1:57:52] name. Praise his
[1:57:56] name. He's in the
[1:58:02] house. And we were like that little girl
[1:58:07] dead in all our
[1:58:10] sins till Jesus touched this heart of
[1:58:14] mine and gave me life again.
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:19] I am just a house of clay.
[1:58:24] Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you, Lord. Praise
[1:58:27] your name. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:30] Hallelujah. Praise you, Lord.
[1:58:32] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Oh, he's in
[1:58:36] the house. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:40] Praise your name, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:42] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:58:45] Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:58:49] Praise your name. Hallelujah. Thank you
[1:58:52] Lord. Glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah.
[1:58:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[1:59:01] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:04] He's in the house. He's in the
[1:59:08] house. Oh death has to flee.
[1:59:13] Oh, now there is
[1:59:16] light where darkness used to
[1:59:20] be. Now there is
[1:59:24] hope. Oh, there's no more
[1:59:28] doubt. Praise his
[1:59:32] name. Praise his
[1:59:36] name. He's in the house.
[1:59:41] Death has to
[1:59:44] flee. Now there is
[1:59:47] life where darkness used to
[1:59:52] be. Now there is
[1:59:55] hope. There's no more
[1:59:59] doubt. Praise his
[2:00:03] name. Praise his name.
[2:00:08] He's in the house. So death has to
[2:00:15] flee. Now there is
[2:00:18] life. Where darkness used to
[2:00:23] be. Now there is
[2:00:27] hope. There's no more
[2:00:30] doubt. Praise his name.
[2:00:35] Praise his
[2:00:38] name. He's in the house. Oh, death has
[2:00:44] to
[2:00:46] flee. Now there is
[2:00:49] life. Where darkness used to
[2:00:53] be. Now there is
[2:00:57] hope. There's no more doubt.
[2:01:02] Praise his
[2:01:05] name. Praise his
[2:01:09] name. He's in the
[2:01:13] house. Hallelujah. I found it all.
[2:01:23] 1182. I found it
[2:01:27] all when I lost it.
[2:01:32] everything and gave my
[2:01:36] life to serve a
[2:01:39] risen king. I found the
[2:01:44] truth that I've been

[2:06:56] You deserve the
[2:07:02] gloryy and the
[2:07:08] honor. Oh Lord, we lift our
[2:07:13] hands to worship
[2:07:17] you as we praise your
[2:07:21] holy
[2:07:24] name. deserve the
[2:07:30] glory and the
[2:07:37] honor. Lord, we lift our
[2:07:42] hands to
[2:07:45] worship as we praise your
[2:07:50] holy name.
[2:07:52] For you are
[2:07:56] great. You do things
[2:08:00] because so
[2:08:04] great. There is no one else like
[2:08:13] you. Oh, there is no one else like you.
