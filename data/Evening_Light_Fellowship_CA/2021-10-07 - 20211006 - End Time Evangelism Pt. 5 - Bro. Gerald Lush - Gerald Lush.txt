of us and he's made us his choice since before the foundation of the world the elect of god let's sing turn your eyes upon jesus to course 2 37. turn your eyes upon [Music] in jesus wonderful face amen and the things of earth will grow strange [Music] in the light of his glory and grace eyes upon jesus look for in his wonderful [Music] in the light of his glory and say it again turn your eyes upon you [Music] and the things yes amen will grow strangely to him amen in the light of his glory and grace amen amen amen praise the lord again i trust him we've turned our eyes upon him amen is not this doctrine or that doctrine it's christ amen because he's the center of it all right by the grace of god it says again a certain brethren want this certain look for this ministry that ministry and i said brother i said the ministry we're looking for him and he's the one that's in us and we're in him and he's in us amen he said i'll pray the father you'll send you another comforter another comforter ah he said that oh yeah that proves the trinity he said just three persons he said god's gonna send another comforter and uh i said brother you'd better go on that another four or five verses he said i'll not leave you comfortless i'll come to you amen so i said who said that i said jesus said it amen so brother we just need the revelation we need the the love of god we need the the presence of our lord jesus christ in us with us and around us amen so god be with us brother and especially we need it in these last days considering all that's going on in the world and all that's going on around the world brother there's nothing normal anymore everything is insane insanity has taken over the world and that is it is that's right but the problem of god warned us that the world was going to go insane well you and i have witnessed it and we are witnessing it we are living in that kind of a world and again like i said if the old brothers and sisters were to come back my and consider all that's going on in the world all that's going on around the world they would where are we they were thinking oh we better get out of here amen this is a crazy place we've come back to amen they would oh yes most definitely because they look out and i trust by grace brother that that we see what they would see and oh yeah and they would consider it and understand it to be insane the way the people are acting the way they talk and you know whether it's religion whether it's politics no matter what it is it's not normal anymore no one time people they would think normal they would act normal they would talk normal but not anymore ain't no definitely not because there's another spirit upon them and as i've already ministered a number of times concerning the god of this evil age amen and it is the devil oh yeah the problem of god said that he's the god of this evil age brother i trust he's not your god he's not influencing you he's not controlling your thoughts no no not by any means but i trust by the grace of god that you do have the revelation so that you recognize the devil when he's moving you know what is god and you know what is the devil be on your guard because it's going to be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible so the grace of god that we're not going to be deceived by what the devil is going to do to challenge our faith and understand this too and brother it's not out there just outside the message he's right he's in the message as i said oh there's a lot of so-called believers or not in the message but i tell you this the devil's in it oh yeah but the message is not in him not by any means but he knows the word he knows the message he knows what god has done he knows what god is doing and he knows what god will do but he's there to challenge our faith he's there to get us to doubt amen in some regards to doubt they doubt doubt certain things that god has done and maybe to doubt what god's doing and definitely confuse you when it comes to what god will do oh brother i pray the grace of god that we're going to have that simple holy ghost faith that believes god amen that holy ghost faith that believes the word amen what god has done and what god doing amen and what he's doing is to get us ready for what he's going to do amen to move us on grace to have that faith brother if there's anything god did in this hour through the ministry of a prophet and the opening of the word is to give us the faith that pleases him not only please him yeah but it's for you and me it's the faith that we need oh yeah and again there's not all believers got that faith that they need amen oh yeah they got the faith of what god has done but they don't have the revelation what god's doing and oh yeah but he'll do this and he'll do that but he's already doing it and they're missing that oh yeah and again that's why the problem of god warned us to be on our toes he said because one of these days you'll wonder oh where's the rapture it already happened he said you didn't know it oh yeah so grace that brother getting into the word preaching the word ministering the word hearing the word amen we're getting more and more into the revelation of what god is doing amen oh what do we will do well well brother what he's doing leads into what he will do amen amen and then that gets that comes back to oh that's what he's doing yeah praise the lord we're believing by the grace of god amen that we're not going to miss what's in the future amen when we're moving into it we're walking into it amen brother tomorrow is the future within the next hour next second is the future amen but are we still in the will of god in the future amen within the next minute within the next hour is your thoughts motives and objectives all audrey's will is according to his will and his leadership in your life amen brother so that we can truly absolutely completely say is not me that lives is christ living in me is that true that the life you live today that the life you're living tonight is that the life you live after this service and tomorrow oh yeah you go out and it's christ in flesh again amen the word made flesh in you and in me amen and i'll tell you if it is you're going to reflect jesus you're we're going to reflect christ you're going to reflect what god yes what he's done but you're going to reflect what he's doing and that's and brother that's that's moving us into what he will do but he's given us the faith to recognize it as we keep marching on so grace to help us lord brother and i tell you we're being challenged and many believers being challenged brother so that the word is not faith the word might be knowledge but not faith and the proud of god understood that now i am warning the people over and over and over because he said you're in the message but he said the message is not in you oh yeah he knew that and brother sister i i know that even back then but over 60 years ago that when the prophet was preaching even in his own church they didn't all believe because as i said if they believed them to be a prophet if they believed that he had thus saved the lord why in the world would they leave the church his church and go to another one because he preached church order something wrong somewhere amen but brother they separated from jesus when he when he endeavored to set this in order that in order amen according to the word and according to what god was doing in that day 2 000 years ago amen jesus was there and and he would drop the hint as to what's going on and what will happen what's going on what will happen but the disciples they tried to stop it no no no no no we don't want that to happen even jesus going down to jerusalem and he said they were going to be going to be deceived or betrayed and he would be crucified and so on no no no they definitely didn't want that to happen no but they never had the revelation that they needed it yeah and he was the only one that could lay down his life pick it up again amen to redeem you and me and to give us the blessed hope take us back home amen by grace brother he was pointing it out pointed it out amen all through the prophets then he came the god prophet praise the lord then he moved on in the church through the baptism of the holy ghost amen not just in this one this one but he's in the bride he's in every member of the bride of the lord jesus christ amen keeping us what in the words with the word to what for to mature us to rapturing faith oh i believe god for this i believe god did this i believe god's doing this yeah but what what else is there in the scripture what else is there in the word that oh we're supposed to oh i believe this it's all past tense he did this he did that but what's he doing do you have you had the revelation of the present tense amen amen of what he is now doing grace brother that we're going to be under the ministry that's focusing on what god's doing amen thank god for what he did but focus on now what he's doing in you what he's doing in may amen what's he doing in the bride and brother is our lives evidence that what he's doing oh yes that's me he's doing it in me i know lord this is what you're doing so there's too many believers as i said they know what he did they know what he will do but they ignore that he's trying to he's trying to do it now in you and me amen surrender brother sister to him amen brother let's not live for ourselves or the foolishness of this world let's live for jesus amen and you're living for jesus you want you're going to live for what he wants to do and what he's doing and if there's anything that he's doing in this hour this late hour concerning all that's going on in the world brother there's a few and it's going to be very few because he said it's going to be so deceiving to deceive the very left if possible amazing amazing be on your guard stay with the word amen god in simplicity amen and let's recognize again the ministry that god wants to put us under whether it's the someone in the fightful ministry you know the prophetic ministry just make sure we're under the influence of our lord jesus christ amen to god be the glory and again i shared this with you a number of times quite a while ago but it's a it says it's a pastor's shirt search committee amen report amen and again it goes through the scriptures amen looking for the correct pastor looking for the correct ministry in the word of god but he said these oh these are the the ones that they thought about and they maybe they should be this one that one but then this is the excuse that a lot of people feel that this this brother has and that brother has this prophet god and so on yeah and this brother said oh what what if we chose noah as our pastor oh and he said no why not he said well could you consider noah this says he preached for 120 years and had no converts yeah they want they want you to preach in such ways to increase the sizing to church no no brother brother branham preached in such a way that his church didn't increase the numbers decreased oh yes definitely because you want you're laying in the word laying in the word amen not compromising well they said we'll take moses as our pastor no no he said no that we don't want a pastor like that for sure because he said moses stutters and he did well that's why god sent joshua with him because moses said lord i can't go and preach i can't do this he said i said i stutter i do this well he said i'll send joshua that's what joshua with him i believe he was and he said he oh he stutters and his former congregation says he loses his temper over trivial things yeah amen and then they said abraham oh he took off to egypt during the hard times and we heard that he got into trouble with the authorities and then he tried to lie his way out he told a lie concerning his wife he yeah he left them with their impression this impression they said oh yeah she's this she says no he said she's this amen it wasn't to a certain extent it was the truth but he was denying that she was also his way yeah so what about david he is an unacceptable moral character he might have been considered for the ministry of music and he not fallen now oh well let's choose solomon well he has a reputation for wisdom but he fails to practice what he preaches amen god help us amen well what if we choose elijah uh no they wouldn't have elijah as their pastor because he proved to be inconsistent and is known to fold under pressure oh yeah he put him under pressure and he humbled down well what about having oseah as our pastor well his family life is in a shambles he's divorced and remarried to a prostitute well somewhere he was following god's leadership amen but man looks at the natural god help us and again there is john and he said he says he is a baptist but he lacks tack and dresses like a and he said would not feel comfortable at a church at a church potluck supper john wasn't into those things he was just out in the wilderness in eating this and eating that amen nature but he wouldn't get into this and get into that no they didn't want him as pastor what about paul or peter they said well peter had a bad temper and he was urged to have even denied christ publicly oh yeah peter was with him and tried to stop jesus from doing this don't do this don't do this yeah brother let god do what he wants to do amen you need you need that kind of a ministry by the grace of god well paul we found him to lack tech and he is too harsh and his appearance is contemptible and he preaches far too long i must be related to paul amen we're brothers by the grace of god amen but they wouldn't have paul because of this no but timothy well he has potential but he's too much young for the position well what's god's choice and again there's jesus and it says he tends to offend church members with his preaching especially bible scholars and he is also too controversial and he even offended the search committee with his pointed questions yeah they didn't believe jesus god help us i mean say you wouldn't have jesus as your pastor they wouldn't have him as their pastor back 2000 years ago no grace of god well they said there's a final choice if you don't want the others would you choose this one and who's that judas judas oh yes they said judas he's very practical amen and he is very cooperative and he's good with money yeah brother good with money all god helped us in these last days amen and it says he cares for the poor and he dresses well yeah they thought he was a good pastor and it says we all agreed that he is just the man we are looking for to fulfill the vacancy of our senior pastor amen god help us that we're going to have holy ghost leadership amen not intellectual leadership amen not emotional leadership but spiritual leadership so the grace of god be with us brother sister lord bless you amen let's stand and turn to saint matthew's gospel chapter 16. god bless us amen i thought the building be full tonight considering all the cars in the driveway amen because the driveway is full so uh we pray the grace of god to those with us and we pray the grace of god to those online amen and i understand too that they're online it's not only through around newfoundland but it's in other parts of the world that we have email and add emails that where they have indicated that they are online with us amen even in africa so we pray the grace of god to bless the saints around the world and also to ask you to keep sister betty in prayer uh because of her situation and she is hopefully recovering little by little and she's hoping that it's not the cobit 19 issue but she she does experience what we refer to as flu-like symptoms and so on and uh and she's also experiencing whatever it is in her lungs and she is coughing it up so we pray the grace of god to be with her amen and also to be with our brother vicer in india and he's there now for a few days so but i understand he'll be there for at least 29 days so god bless brother visual and his testimony by the grace of god amen so in matthew chapter 16 and beginning to read at verse 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen what revelation do we have of christ today grace and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it it is the rock of the revelation of our lord jesus christ amen and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen so be take take care of your witness to the world of what you do what you allow what you don't allow amen let's make sure it's the word and we're giving the glory to jesus amen verse 20 then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ amazing amen brother again even with the revelation of the word for this hour the message for this hour brother let's keep it within the ranks of the right amen and you most certainly would only give witness as god would lead you amen let's not cast our pearls before swine amen so verse 21 from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day but then peter took him and began to rebuke him that's right and there are believers that take him and through the ministry and rebuking the ministry not realizing rebuking jesus be careful amen and it says he rebuked him saying be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan amazing amen for thou art an offense unto me for thou savrus not the things that be of god but those that be of men amen oh he was looking at things through natural eyes nature of human but not holy ghost nature and then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me amen let him deny himself so are we denying ourselves amen our personal interests and our personal nature amen let us deny what it's influencing us to do amen so we're under jesus nature if any man will come after me let him deny himself amen and take up his cross and follow me amen for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it amen god bless his word you may be seated so the lord willing i want to try to bring some of these thoughts to a conclusion concerning end time evangelism because the prophet of god ministered on it in 1962 a man 59 years ago and it was in the month of june and brother he felt bled of the lord to minister on the subject concerning end-time evangelism because there was a generation that never had the revelation truly of what god was doing amen what was god doing through the evangelists what was god doing through oral roberts what was god doing through billy graham and what was god doing through william branham amen there are many many many that were that identified with william branham back in those days and in those years and brother they look back even now and they are absolutely amazed when they consider the ministry of william branham the signs and the wonders and they even included it in the in an internet link concerning william branham and they were expressing the thoughts that concerning what he did was tremendous what he did was like the ministry of jesus that when jesus was here 2000 years ago and he went forth performing these signs amen and just think two thousand years later that he went forth in the ministry of a prophet doing the same thing amen ministering the same signs and wonders to the extent that many a religious person even in this day was acknowledging yes yes we can't deny but it's god but they said ow do we how do we reconcile the the the teachings of william branham with you well when it comes to the yo no the signs and the wonders with his teaching is that his teaching we know is absolutely the truth but it signs and wonders where rather it is god because god said he would do this he would do this he would do that but it says when it comes to william random's teaching how do we reconcile the teaching versus the signs amen but you and i recognize it as what god did the signs was there to get our attention amen because the proud of god in the cave he was said now this is you're going to have this sign you're going to have that sign and it says but he said get the people to believe amen and it wasn't just to believe the sign it was to believe the word amen by the grace of god because it was great all this was going to point to the word amen and we're here tonight because we believe the word we recognize the signs and wonders that god did in the ministry of william branham but praise the lord we didn't ignore what he was preaching we didn't ignore what he was teaching we didn't fail to recognize amen what the ministry in the word that it was according to what amen jesus pointed them to it alleluia to his ministry 2000 years ago amen but he also reminded them that there was that that that same ministry that was in john the baptist he said that ministry would also be in the last days amen now he said this this ministry you're talking about the ministry you're looking for 2000 years ago he said it's already come but i say under yay as god said he's going to do this and he's going to do that and amen he was referring to the latter days if returning to referring to the age which you and i are living amen and why because we will be looking for our lord jesus christ again we're looking for his presence looking for his anointing looking for his deliverance amen but jesus is highlighting that before that you recognize the presence of jesus you had to recognize the presence of the angel of god or the prophet of god amen through malachi 4 jesus referred to malachi 4 amen concerning that it would come in the last days he referred to malachi 4 saying that it was already happened in the day that he was made flesh amen surely he said he's done this and he's done that amen and yet he said i say unto you that he will do this and he will do that why another ministry amen in the in the revelation of the word in the restoration of the word the ministry of malachi 4 2000 years ago amen was pointing to the word made flesh then now the ministry of malachi 4 amen in this hour in this age is pointing to the revelation of the ministry today amen as i said he redeemed our souls now he's redeeming our bodies hey praise the lord jesus came down in flesh and redeemed us and he promised he was going to come back amen and he was going to receive us unto himself amen by the grace of god but he would also send a messenger amen prophesy again in malachi 4. because malachi 4 talks about amen turning to turning the the faith of the church in that one but it was all focusing on signs and wonders amen but we came to the revelation of the prophetic ministry of good and brethren amen oh yes we are focusing on the signs and the wonders of that prophetic ministry but amen god brought our attention to the revelation of the word amen and again there's many oh yeah that was good he was great he was a tremendous servant of god amen amen amen amen they went on with his signs and his waters but when they struck the word no they couldn't accept it this is amazing they couldn't accept what winter man was teaching this is amazing considering all the signs and the wonders which he did that he could discern by the grace of god he could deserve the thoughts and intents of the heart he knew this he knew that amen no hiding from him he did send his word with jesus but he denied jesus and crucified him amen savage was with christ in this hour they denied him and crucified him again it was as it were the second crucifixion of our lord amen so brother amen two brother bound three son the crucifixion yeah this hour they say amen denominationals religious people amen they they oh they recognize the signs and the wonders thank god for the signs and the weathers but they shouldn't come to the teaching no no they didn't believe that was god but it was god amen and brother again as the prophet said the signs and the wonders that the first poll the second pool of his ministry was only to get our attention amen get our attention and brother when he when he got the attention of the bride amen and those knowing they are to come for the opening of the seven seals revealing the mystery of god amen and it's a revelation of the end time by the grace of god hallelujah and brothers lay in this word lay in that word lay it in amen no they didn't want that god bless lord brother in his signs and wonders but lord not his teaching and major that's where they stood but as believers and again let me emphasize that i was part of the fellowship in gamble and i did attend the pentecostal church in here and i was baptized there but again we were non-denominational because god had set a problem and a prophet but a but an evangelist oh yes there was an evangelist and his wife from either nova scotia or new brunswick amen and they came to newfoundland in the early 1960s and oh they laid in the word laid in the word amen now yeah they had camp meetings i was i was one time i remember being in their tent meeting in gamble and it was at the very lower part of gamble amen and we and i can remember now that he had a tent set up there and i remember as a young boy that i was with other young young young brothers there and oh we never had room in the tent for us to sit because the tent was full and but they had the size of the tent pulled up amen and so with a number of other young people i was i was laying on the ground oh yeah laying down underground and looking into the tent and looking up to the platform amen this woman was going to sing that one was saying then they then they then they sang this for the congregation and this or the congregation and then this brother or sister got up and preached oh i remember that amen this is absolutely amazing i can take you right down to that place now and show you on the left side where there was some vacant vacant land there and they had this tent set up amen but that ministry for the most part that ministry even back then they weren't preaching william branham they weren't preaching what he called the message and you know of the prophet no no he did reference just once amen when he was preaching he did reference that that the the ministry of willing ran the signs and the wonders and he was saying this is absolutely amazing but he says we remember the the ministry of william branham and what god was doing through william branham the signs and the wonders deserting the thoughts and entrance of the heart he did this he did that oh they but again he didn't emphasize the teaching of william branham and again the exact year that was i don't know but it was sometime in 1960 amen and it was even before the the cottage meeting in gamble and the brothers of citrus and gamble even before they recognized william branham as the prophet oh yeah but we can we continued on non-denominational because why we're under that teaching under that influence of that ministry amen that god wasn't in denominations god wasn't controlling his word denominations amen that's manmade and they said not god made amen so he said that brother was preaching that sister was preaching and they said let us stay with the leadership of the holy ghost so there's not you living not me living he says the holy ghost living in us amen so brother sister for uh but again i'm not sure how many exact years it was not many from there on that eventually we came to hear the prophet of god amen and recognize the proud of god amen and we became believers amen amen and oh i still gathered together with the saints and gamble and what do we do what were we doing we were listening to the prophet's tapes oh yeah i was very young but they we went in and we had this song service and we worshiped praise the lord hallelujah amen and then when we come to the hearing of the word brother jewel would sit down and put on a tape of william branham and again it was one of those big tapes yeah and after after a few months i believe or maybe a year or two that the saints said no brother girl now we want you to do it we want we feel that god has got a call in your life and so we want you to minister to us so i was for a while refusing to do it but again eventually i did step in it says okay we'll see what the lord will do amen and that was the beginning of my ministry when it comes to the message of the hour amen so instead of playing tapes they said brother we want you to come minister now amen you can preach whatever the prophet prays but brother grace of god amen that we're not just listening to a tape amen praise the lord but we're hearing the word of god amen and that's where i started when it comes to ministering the message of the hour brother and that's been over 50 years ago amen but brother where are we now what are we believing now what are we taking our stand for now amen it was absolutely tremendous back then and we were experiencing that under that anointing experiencing that that that bright revival back there in man coming into the word and identifying with what god had done with what god was doing amen then what identifying that it was absolutely the end of all things amen that's right so that that finally the ministry was revealed the ministry was manifested in the last days amen what for to give us the faith that we need to get through amen god sent this evangelist that and that brother yes and i have to admit that it was a sister amen they both preached amen but under their ministry oh yeah we we we came to freedom from the control of man in the church the control of man in a denomination amen so and we were focusing mainly on on the pentecostal revival the pentecostal move but we got to the revelation of the right move amen that what god had done and what god was doing was sort of calling out of the bright amen brother this message is not for everyone up there the problem of god said jesus is going to be preached all over the world but he said they're not all they want all hear the message he said because this is only for the bride amen thank god you heard it thank god i heard it amen amen i've been having a confirmation in in us that we are a part of the bride of the lord jesus christ amen because he's not going out there well god bless them that's fine you know and i'm not going to condemn them they're not going to do this because brother it's god that that reveals it amen many are called and he god called them all but few were chosen he chose the bride amen but he saw that nature in in you he saw a nature in me saw nature in the bright oh yeah that's mine amen and and he could do this oh he knew that you believed the word he knew you would stay with the word amen so the grace of god is with us here amen after 50 years we're still staying with the word amen after 50 years we're still believing god after 50 years we're still looking for the resurrection and for the rapture because amen end time evangelism is putting our emphasis on the resurrection it is putting our emphasis on the rapture because this is what god wants to do and this is what god is doing amen as i said down through the years god did this god did that god did that amen and he put their emphasis on justification he put their emphasis on the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but brother then he came on the scene in the prophet to put our emphasis on the word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother pentecost oh yes the prophet ohio uh prophet highlighted it and because why pentecost he said thought he said that the pentecostal message he said would bring the rapture amen the pentecostal message would do this and this but no he said god had predestinated god had for ordained he said this prophecy concerning the calling out of the bright amen and he said the revelation of the mystery of god to give her resurrection and rapturing faith amen not a pentecostal faith not by any means no no no but brother it is a faith hallelujah of the revelation of the son of man and it's in the in the son of man is the revelation he said i am the resurrection and the rapture amen oh yeah that's when he like i said when he raised lazarus from the from the dead and martha didn't believe it didn't all that the resurrection is up the road rather than amen but she failed to comprehend the resurrection with withering flesh in jesus amen and brother that same attitude that same spirit amen is among a lot of people today amen they recognize this they recognize that but they don't recognize that god what is here in the revealing of the word to give us the faith for the resurrection and the faith for the rapture oh my brother sister and many of us are focusing on the resurrection how many of us are focusing on the rapture and many of us are looking for the resurrection rapture any moment now to get out of here but there's too many still focusing just on this mystery this mystery this doctrine this doctrine and so oh yeah god uh what are you believing this for well god god said the prophet to reveal this reveal that yes he did that's the truth but is he giving you the faith that he's looking for amen not to believe this doctrine that doctrine this doctrine that doctrine amen brother believe that plus and we're believing it the way we should i tell you this god is focusing on in your life and in mind morning new tonight he's focusing on the resurrection rapture amen because he said when this happens this happens this happens amen look up how many believers are looking up how many believers they feel like they're moving at a time and into eternity how many are really really concentrating on heaven not this whole earth just till too many brother that are focusing on the natural oh yeah they're living for the natural they're controlled by the natural not not being led by the spirit why if any man can come after me he said let him deny himself amen and to deny himself by the grace of god brother it it is to ignore self amen looking for the revelation that i had written down concerning to deny self amen brother is to ignore self amen and let oh yeah to deny self is to deny your personal interests yeah to deny that because that's what the devil is working on in our brains in our minds in our feelings amen he's trying to get us to focus more and more on our personal interests and our natural things of life amen but hallelujah but what god did oh my brother sister he did it for this reason to get our attention from the natural to the spiritual amen praise the name of the lord by the grace of god god help us that we're not focusing on natural things oh brother sister considering all that's gone on and all that's going on in this world we're living in a crazy world it is an insane world brother and you consider the covent 19 issue oh i'll tell you this it's not having the effect on even believers what it should have oh yeah this this why because our focus is on the natural things yes yeah on oh yeah focusing on personal things this and this all but how many how many really feel when it comes to they're they're hearing this about copenhagen 19. they're here and that about colvin 19. amen oh yeah oh yeah this is too bad oh lord i please bless this one bless that one watch over this one on that one oh brother we need to look up say lord we're coming home amen that's what god wants to hear i'm coming home amen because he's doing this and he's doing that amen he's fulfilling this fulfilling that amen well and he's what's he waiting for waiting for the hear of the bride lord we're coming home amen the dead in christ will rise first we which are a lot of remains shall be cut up together with them to meet the lord of the air amen as the prophet of god said that the dead in christ appeared to the living saints and if we'll have fellowship then we're going to step into that dimension into a glorified body go up to meet jesus amen oh brother how many of many of us really really ready well we we focus on oh my job and i got to do this and i got to do that and so on but how many are really really living for the resurrection and the rapture oh it's like someone wanted somebody has said one time went ah they said all you people you're always talking about this and talk about that the resurrection the rapture you're talking about the the the revival the end time but the bride and all that oh yeah but they feel oh well as christians we just want to talk about jesus and we just go on and jesus is going to help us and jesus is going to strengthen us and and so on yeah but jesus said i'll not leave you comfortless i will comfort you i'll come down and comfort you i'll be with you even in you and they show you i'll be i'll be in him and he said amen oh up amen this happened and and the disciples didn't want jesus to do this he wanted to be there but jesus knew what was what was coming to pass in that day and even he said no man doesn't send it up only he that came down and he said even the son of man who is in heaven amen do we recognize ourselves as being in heaven we are there in theory amen that's going to come to us and we'll go to that we're going to step into that body in a glorified condition amen by the grace of almighty god brother sister let's not focus just on doctrine amen theology let's focus on the resurrection of the rapture amen because the brother of god got to the place and we're nearing the end of his ministry and he said now he said always it's just it's the rapture he said i'm going to leave that with you and he and he said i'm moving on yeah the rapture god help us brother and god he didn't he didn't leave out this mystery or that mystery or another mystery the mystery of the of the revelation of the seven seals the mystery of god coming down amen and brother after he preached that and they opened the seven seals and so on he went on and he preached a couple of other messages and he said it's another revelation on the seals yeah so that we'd know and believe this oh yeah praise the lord hallelujah so that we're not going to we're not going to go in as the bride and believe in that and believe in that way they do it there no no god gave this the revelation of the mystery of the opening the seals and then he preached this and he preached that and he preached this this revelation amen he said that's another mystery another revelation of the mystery what for it'll to to conclude and seal our faith amen that we believe this amen you believe this you believe that amen you're not going to head to it not going to take from it you're going to stay with it the word amen by the grace of almighty god amen forgive me for getting this long but in the message on end time evangelism he said now he said we are thinking of evangelism at the end time and i'll tell you it's not focusing on getting converts in we're we're in a late hour now it's to get us out focus on the faith to get us out amen god did this god did that but now god is doing this god is working on the rest of the revelation of the mystery revealed amen what for to get us out of here he led the the methodists or the lutherans on to justification justification justification amen and they were focusing on it and angry and thirsting for it feeding on a man and then god offered another meal then god offered another meal amen then the pentecostal meal amen by the grace of god but now then after that he came in and offered the bride revelation praise the lord oh yes because we listen it's been oh my almost a hundred years since the pentecostal revival oh over a hundred years amen and and when it comes to the angel coming down in 1933 it's almost 100 years amen the calling of the prophet has been 60 i think it's 62 years since the problem was called 1948 yeah and i highlighted it and i do have it here somewhere concerning what happened in the world in 1948 since 1948 amen and brother is tremendous concerning all that god has done and what god is doing amen i'll try to get it later somewhere amen this is happened in 1948 that 1948 that oh my all that started in 1948 israel became a nation 1948 world council churches developed in 1948 and this and this amen politically this started in 1948 that started in 1948 amen the angel came to the prophet 1948 amen to god be the glory amen so brother and i did remind you too back then i said don't forget i said your prophet was born your pastor was born in 1948. yeah you were born that long ago i said yes definitely yeah and brother now where are we now after all those years 72 73 years ago amazing yeah but and after they opened the seals 1963 and the finish of the mystery of god amen and the finish of the of the prophet of malachi 4 1965 oh brother sister i said lord how much longer is it going to go i pray grace we're going to add the faith that we won't miss it amen pray grace that we have the faith of what god is doing in your life amen brother are you different from what you were when you started this message years ago 40 odd years ago for saint john's are you the same or are you more religious and less spiritual oh yeah father god said they're the religious but they're not spiritual i pray god we're spiritual and that your actions are spiritual your words are spiritual your motives and objections are spiritual amen what do you mean by spiritually it's all controlled by the word amen it's not again you living it's the word living in you amen well if the word's living in me the word has done this the word has done that what's the word to do now amen well god through the ministry of the word of the preacher of the word is to give us the faith that what god wants to do in you and in me amen whether it's my ministry brother jonathan's ministry god is ministering to give us that faith to get us to focus on that faith to get us to focus on what god's doing and what god will do god help us please i pray grace even to our young brothers and sisters in the name of jesus that you'll have a hunger and thirst to get out of here amen praise the lord that you will want to go and so and i know that that that maybe becomes more and more difficult i pray god give give them that faith because the young are not seen maybe or well if god is in them they will see it the way god wants them to see it but in the natural they're they're focusing on the natural things of life because they live with it they're out there working with it they're out there in their school and this and that all natural natural natural natural but if you're spiritual amen you're focusing on god you're focusing on if you're spiritual in this age you're focusing on the resurrection you're focusing on the rapture you're focusing on the coming of the lord jesus christ for his bride amen to receive us unto himself god help us amen lord while you're still still here while we're still here today we're still looking for you for the resurrection we're still looking for the rapture lord please don't let us get too caught up with the natural things that we lose revelation of the spiritual amen he said we are thinking of evangelism at the end time well do you really believe it's the end time well it's been many many many many years since the prophet has gone 62 something like that years since the prophet is gone god help us amen and he said and anyone that would read a newspaper he said the sky is black and darkening the clouds are coming up and know that we're fixing to have rain and he should feel it in the air and he said anyone can read a newspaper and see the conditions of the nation the nations and he said realize that something is fixing to happen oh brother it's happening can you consider all that's happened you know in the last 50 or 60 years i pray grace brother sister that it didn't it didn't harden our hearts or uh make us oh soul in such a way with our feelings that we oh that's just this that's just that why because we've had so many years seeing these things happen these things happen these things happen oh so now it doesn't bother people when this happens it doesn't like i felt that the coven 19 issue didn't strike the believers the way that it should uh god help us amen brought us god's allowing this and allowing that what for it's going to bring out those that have the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture faith to get out of here amen come on do you like this world do you like this what's going on in this world do you like the atmosphere you're living in you're dealing with dealing with this dealing with that well i don't i want to go by the grace of god amen unless he said when you see one with a chip on his shoulder and the other them arguing with all kinds of weapons and so forth to fight with and no agreements kicking off their shoes and beating discs and everything at their conferences you know something is fixing to happen and i don't know if you heard the news in the last even the last few days here in newfoundland all that's going on i tell you it's a testimony that the world's insane to me if they're insane in newfoundland they're saying all over the world definitely amen and it is concerning oh how many of a number of vehicles that had to be pulled out of their parking lots because why because there was young young people that went there and broke the glasses you know the side glasses the windshields and did this and did that oh yeah several of them here in st john's did that yeah and they had to go and and had them paul pulled away they couldn't drive them away had to pull them up brother it's finished be on your guard yeah oh this one i don't worry about this you better because it could come it could be on your doorstep be on your guard amen he said the christian he said knows that it's the coming of the lord there's an atmosphere and it depends on what you're looking at for the lord has strictly told us just what was going to happen at that time and we don't know the minute or the hour but we know that we are nearing something now amen and you know a sheep cannot find his way back wherever he come from is lost completely and that's the reason the lord likens us unto sheep and we're lost there's only one thing can bring us back the shepherd amen brother let's recognize our shepherd amen let him be in control amen to lead you and he said a lamb or a sheep doesn't smell its enemy and he said like the other like a deer or something like that and he could he could sense that death was near and there was a lion coming slipping up coming easy and he could smell the sheep so he was coming you see to get the lamb amen and the little fellows become nervous and you couldn't see the reason why but it was death was lurking so near that he was nervous well brother we're not nervous but we're encouraged in our faith why because we see that the well the resurrection the rapture the change is is so near right now i pray grace that we're that we're experiencing it oh yeah it's pulling on us it's pulling on you pulling on the alert to pull us out of time into eternity how many want to go i trust we're not not satisfied with this this dimension we're in oh yeah i believe you know let let us take certain one of us and let us put us into a you want to go to africa you want to go to north africa do you want to go to russia oh it's a different atmosphere there want to go to china different atmosphere there oh yeah when it comes to spiritual because i know that in those countries where there's a few believers here and there and what do they do they they go good into the wilderness to worship oh yeah some go into the wilderness and others oh yeah they get together a few in a house and like i said they'll set the table with a meal and and have it all there and then they'll go into the living room as they were wherever it is and they'll start to worship the lord and pray and sing amen and hear the word and but if there's any knocks come down the door or they'll run and sit down at the table amen pretending to eat natural food oh yeah i pray god grace brother thank god for the revelation that we have the freedom we have but brother i trust we're not going to be so free that we forget who we are where we come from why we're here and where we're going amen brother please let's be spiritual by the grace of god he said the world is such in a neurotic shape right now he said he'll drive you down the street 90 miles an hour and he's sit in a beer joint drink two hours before they go home yeah speak to someone oh my they blow up yeah well it's getting worse and worse now in the last few months they're in newfoundland i trust you're not ignoring the news oh my they're crazy yeah it is but you better look up it's not crazy it's insanity it's the devil's influence satan is the god of this world trust he's not the god of your life amen and well i thought what's the matter they said everybody just letting all pressure but the doctor the psychiatrists are doctoring the psychiatrists oh he said but there is a way out that's christ and he said the christians should not be in that condition and we should be happy waiting for the coming for it is close it was close back in 62 how close would he consider it now i trust by grace we're not going to miss it he said we know that redemption is nigh something is fixing to take place and the world doesn't see that they laugh at it because they did it did in other days but we know that it is coming near amen and the reason i chose today this subject he said for my last for a while for the tabernacle on end time evangelism and when we are doing mission work or foreign missions with the word of god we know we're always in the will of god why stay with the word of god you're in the will of god amen because he said jesus first commission to his church was go out and preach the gospel the last commission was to preach the gospel amen the first time to the jews only and he said the last commission is to all nations amen by the grace of god and brother he said he and them that had seen jesus after he was risen from the dead he said see they had a testimony that they seen the lord and others didn't believe it and he uprated them because of the hardness of their heart and they didn't believe these people who had seen this that he was not dead he's alive brother i pray grace they had that revelation that he was alive i pray grace we have that revelation that he's here with us tonight the resurrection and the rapture the rapture is not up there the rapture is here amen same thing today and he said when you see his work and he said now he said we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the lord amen and remember appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearing and he's already appeared in these last days and right here with us in the last few years now it's a sign of his coming this was 1962 amen he came down in 63 with the opening of the word praise the lord and remember he said it spoke both places appearing and coming amen and today we try to take the written word we have in letter form creed form and so forth to all the world and he said there's been missionaries gone everywhere but what we do find what we get there he said a native that can't read his name holding a track in his hand and he knows no more about it than he does which is right and left hand but when jesus said go and preach the gospel he never said teach the word he said preach the gospel and the gospel came not in word only but through the manifestation of the word for the only way that it could be done was to make his promise come to pass amen brother grace but now preaching the word now is to make the word flesh in us by the grace of god he said in this case god comes among the people proves that his word is made manifest and the only way you can do that is not by a tract but by the holy spirit working through you amen praise the lord what god has done what god is doing he's revealed it in you and through you your life your life is bearing witness why are you doing this why are you doing that why do you go to this church why do you go to that church and so on well because you want to get in want the lord to increase your faith amen in what he has done he said your life becomes his life yes he said it is god in you amen praise the lord brother all down through the prophets to prophets the prophets to finally does the god prophet jesus it has been all the way down through the messengers to messengers to messenger amen to finally it is christ the messenger not william branham no no see the problem of god said see that's your problem he said you don't see the other angel he said you see me he said oh yeah i said that he said that's your problem he said you recognize me but you don't see him he said he's right there behind me amen oh he is yes he is they saw william branham but he said what about behind me oh yeah go get that picture and see it hallelujah oh yeah he said i'm not there i'm not there he said he said i'm up there behind and he is the picture shows you that oh brother it ought to give us faith lord we're coming home lord we know it was you we know that it wasn't will and brown doing this willing down doing that lord we recognize you as the other angel that was there amen and brother what's revealed lord is giving us a faith oh we can go home now hallelujah it's the end now lord we're finished god help us amen he said your life becomes his life and he's in you and jesus said you must be born again in order to be born again is letting yourself go and die and the spirit of christ come into you and then you're no more yours it's christ in you amen and paul said i die daily yet i live not me but christ liveth in me amen is christ living in you in your home in your job among family friends and neighbors are you religious are you are you spiritual amen not reflecting religion but we're reflecting the holy ghost christ in us if i tell you i'm a christian and the spirit of christ is in me or in you then we do the works of christ because jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and then he said here these signs shall follow them that believe and now he said through the age there has been a time that these signs as not followed believer and he said there would come a time that could not be called day nor night but in the evening time it shall be light amen he said everything that's going on he said denotes is coming we are at the end time amen and the prophet said and he said it's exactly what it says it shall be light in the evening time and then the same sun that come up upon the eastern people and showed his works and his blessings it was prophesied that there would be a dismal day amen it would not be day or night that's a gloomy day amen but in the evening time the same great power of god would come upon the church amen and he said just like it did back there on the eastern in the western it would be the same and that's why i want to speak on evening time evangelism amen i'll finish with these quotes and he said each age has had its message and its messengers all through the times every age has packed its message with a messenger and god in every dispensation has sent for someone anointed with the holy spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time amen and he said god was the messenger at the beginning to tell adam and eve you shall eat this but you shall not do this that was the message and when man stepped across the message of the hour it brought death and chaos to the whole human race and now that's how much the message means amen that's right brother sister and remember that it wasn't just a complete blank denial of what god said that he believed it was taking what god said and whitewashing it over he said misconstruing it just a little bit or taking a little bit away from it leave it the way that god said it amen and concerning what god has done and what god is doing leave it the way that god is doing it amen right now let's recognize it let's believe it and leave it amen and thank god for it by grace amen and let's keep moving on remember end time evangelism is to get us to focus on what god's doing amen as i said before he brought us out amen from organized religion and that's why we're here but do we have the faith of end time evangelism to rapture us because that's what god's looking for in us now brother not just say well i believe this i believe that all right he said where's the faith where's the faith that it's ordained to give you amen through the ministry of the word whether it's brother journal ministering this word whether it's brother jonathan ministering the word brother is a god focusing on what he has done yes and what he is doing and what he will do amen because brother the word god in the word god through the word is endeavoring to do it endeavoring to bring it to pass endeavoring to make the word flesh endeavoring to make the prophecy fulfilled amen completely brother this prophecy is fulfilled that's fulfilled but brother concerning the prophecy of the resurrection and rapture he is working on that in you and me through the word god help us that we're going to get more and more and more focused on the resurrection more and more focus on the rapture end time evangelism for the bride is focusing on resurrection and rapture let's get out of here by the grace of god god bless us amen [Applause] be in prayer brother jonathan will be ministering the lord willing on sunday yeah sunday amen praise
