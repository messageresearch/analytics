made the effort to assemble once again together Lord as your word has asked us to do and Lord we believe that you're here among us this evening you said were the two and three Gathering my name that I would be in the midst of them and we believe that Lord and we just pray your blessing now upon this part of the service we pray for those that are here you you know their hearts you know their needs and you're able to meet any need there is nothing that you cannot do Lord and we just pray for each one that's here maybe if there' be any listening in also that might be in need this evening that you would just come on the scene Lord and speak and minister to them we pray we just commit these things to you now and ask your blessing upon the word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so happy to be here with you it's been a a long time since I've even been in New Finland and I haven't actually been in St John's but I was thinking it was 40 I think almost 43 years ago was the last time I was here in central newfinland I wasn't even married then so that's how long it's been so we have a unique opportunity though as the coming years as a minut sister is I don't know your needs and so you know I believe that the Lord can speak very personally you know I I often through my life gone through trials and tests and I different times I thought you know it' be really nice if brother Brandon was here and I could go maybe and have an interview and I could get the answer but you know the answer wasn't in brother Brandon it was the G that would would give him the answer it's the same as at the pool of Bethesda when when the people would gather around their waiting for the moving of the waters you know brother brandom said the the healing wasn't in the waters the healing was with the angel and so we really just need him in our midst and so this evening we we know the scripture in Matthew says that where're two and three gathered together in his name I will be in the midst Jesus said that he would be in the midst well there's there's at least two or three here at least two or three here that are gathered in his name so he must be here well if he is here then the answer to every problem is here the answer to every question is here and I believe in the power of of of the spoken word and I believe that God is able to discern with the word I've seen it happen many times and so tonight I don't know anything about what's going on and your situation but God does and so God can take a scripture and God can take a quote or anything that's said can speak right down into your life I would know wouldn't be me and it wasn't brother Brandon but people Associated it with him it was always God but God still discerns the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart still does that today Amen Let us while we're standing let's turn to the 1 Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 we're going to speak tonight to to the elect and I'm trusting and believing that that's all of you most of you all of you that's here tonight would be represented sometimes you know you you speak to the sinner sometimes you're trying to speak to everyone but tonight we're going to have a subject that's that the sinner cannot relate to but you can 1 Peter chapter 1 I want to read the firstly the first and second verse and then we'll skip to verse five through to n 1 Peter 1 and 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout Pontius galatia capid doia Asia and bethenia notice verse two elect according to the for knowledge of God so this address that's being made in chapter one it's being made to the elect not being made to the sinner or the hypocrite or make believer it's being made to the elect through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied drop down to verse 5 who are kept by the power of God through faith onto salvation who are kept you're not kept by your power you're kept by the power of God and if you've been serving the lord any length of time you know there are times when if it was your own strength you wouldn't make it but we're kept by the power of God that's a privilege that the elect have the sinner doesn't have that the others don't have that but we do who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to re be revealed at the last time in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations my thought is coming from SE verse 7 and I'm going to speak on the trial of your faith at the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the would be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love and whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls you may be seated this subject I've spoken many times and it might seem like a negative thing to speak about the trial of your faith and I'm not a negative preacher but the reality of of serving the lord if you serve the Lord as I said any length of time you'll you're very acquainted with trials you know what they are and you know personally what they are you just don't know about the brother and the sister's trial but if you've been serving the lord you know what trials are but even the world has trials too but but the prophet makes a state statement you know he said in in the world falling apart 1963 he said we want everything so that we can take it easy and retire and take life easy but brother Braham said life wasn't intended to be easy he said life is a struggle anything that's got life is struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get a system that takes all of that that away that takes it easy he said then we're wrong and we know that there's something wrong job said one time the man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble and so we know that it's like that brother Brandon makes a statement in another message in Revelation 5 in 1961 he said he said now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth and so I'm saying these things and they might not say sound like good things to say but remember uh as we go through this God is in control of everything he's in control of your life and so these things that are happening they're not just happening randomly Satan will constantly punch at you until your finished here on Earth remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time because you're in a battle you're in a battle he said did you ask to come to Christ to go to a picnic he said well you're going to be surprised because because it's a constant battle he said I've been on the field for 31 years I fought every inch of the way there is a day coming there is a rest coming and of course there's a rest now for the people of God as far as in the spirit but in this life it's struggle it's testing and it's trying in the in in in the book of Deuteronomy there's a scripture in fact maybe we'll we'll go to Deuteronomy 11 if they can bring it up Deuteronomy 11: 11 and 12 the land of Israel the that Israel was promised to go into that they would come and they would possess it says in Deuteronomy 11 and 11 that the land whether you go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and I've often reflected on that you know it's kind of like the walk through life we know there's a great land of promise but we have a promise that's given to us as well in this life an Earnest of our inheritance in the in the Holy Ghost that we can have and we can live in in spiritual High places but we know that our walk in this life is a walk through valleys and and and up mountains and it was kind of like what Israel was given here a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh the water of the rain of heaven but notice verse 12 it is a land which the Lord thy God carth for so when whether you're in the valley or you're on the Mountaintop God cares about it cares about your life cares about where you are in your life he cares about it and not only that the Bible says the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it he's he's always looking from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year so wherever you're at in your life whatever circumstance whatever you're dealing with he's he's watching you His Eye Is on the Sparrow as the song goes and I know he watches me amen so trials where first of all let's just talk in general about trials where do these things come from where do Trials come from well we'll talk first about the ones that are not really Trials of Faith but all of us as human beings go through life and we're thrown in in circumstances and the prophet said we're put in circumstances where we have to make decisions and we make choices through life brother B said you can't do anything in life without making a decision well the decisions we make sometimes aren't always good ones we don't always do the right thing we don't always choose the right thing and when that happens we sometimes bring trouble our way and so we can sometimes have trials and sometimes tests that come our way that are simply that we are reaping what we have sown and and all of us don't have to look very far for an example of that I'm sure in our own lives I can look at my own life I'm sure you can of things I I should never have done that I should never have made that decision I should have never have made that choice tce and the Bible says in Galatians 6 and8 that he that sth to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and so we will encounter those things it could be Financial it could be physical it could be different things just making bad choices and sometimes you get yourself in a mess but you know the Lord is able to bring us through those things when it happens the the point of it is though there's a scripture let's uh in 1 Peter chap 2 and verse 20 when we have those kind of Trials the ones where we've caused the trouble ourselves it's not something that we can say well well thank the Lord I'm I I'm I'm managing this okay I have a right attitude well there's no glory in it the scripture says if you're buffeted for your faults and take it patiently see because you're just reaping what you slded you you're getting what you deserve to get and but the thing about it is if you're a child of God there's something unique about the reaping and the so the sewing and the reaping brother brandham in in a message he preached God keeps his word in Jeffersonville 1957 makes a statement he he was speaking to his own church there and he said little church struggling for the kingdom of God he said don't ever falter in this day well you know that's that's something to say different to do you know don't falter in this day but he said if if you do quickly repent jump right back up he said if you stop your toe don't fall but if you fall get up and we all fail at times there's a scripture I believe it's in the Proverbs that says the righteous man falls seven times but gets up again see The Sinner he falls and gets into trouble and he just stays in a fallen condition but the righteous men it's not that they don't fall but they get up again but brother makes this point about it when we do these things that that we're bringing trouble along we've sinned we've done something wrong and we all get caught in those things the prophet said make make mistakes every day he said you're going to get a whipping for it just remember that see you'll reap what you swow out but he makes a statement and when I first read it very first time ever read I thought it's an odd thing brother bandam said but a very powerful statement too he said whatever you do take your whipping here take your whipping here and you think do I have any option do I have any choice well in a way you do be because the sinner you see his whipping is deferred for the most part the sinner has got a judgment awaiting in The Sinner is going to be punished so you see people out in the world who do evil and and it looks like they go through life and they're getting off with everything but their punishment is coming but see for the bride we have to stand before God spotless and so when we fall all we've got to take our whipping now if we don't take our whipping now brother BR said take your whipping here because he wants to present a spotless but it's not Penance as the Catholics teach it's not that it's not self-punishment it's up to God so our part in this when we fail is to repent brother Braham said to repent but he said once you do that you get back up and you keep on going you don't go along and run yourself down and be guilty and say well I wish I didn't did and and and act like well I can't ask God for anything because I just messed up no once you've asked forgiveness and you put that thing under the blood you know the blood is so powerful brother Bram taught that that blood when that sin goes under the blood he said it's absolutely gone and in fact brother brandom said it's even gone from his memory his problem is it's not gone from our memory because we remember what we did but God doesn't if we really put that sin under the blood it's brother Brown said it's absolutely gone it's absolutely gone not just covered up it's absolutely gone and and and washed out away completely but we reap what we sow and so we go through things sometimes but we should just take that and say Lord Brother brandham said say Lord I deserve it he lets the whip down you just say Lord I deserve it and just keep on going I mean we trust that we learn from our mistakes most of us but some of us do you know sometimes you trip over the same rock you tripped over yesterday you know but that but hopefully along the way we learn Le and we don't make those mistakes but if you're a child of God God is not going to let you get away with it you don't have to worry about did did somebody see me do that no God saw you and so if there's an issue he'll take care of it so that's those kind of Trials but we don't want to focus on those kind of Trials so much we know about them we know what they are just don't let yourself get condemned over it put it under the blood and keep going but put those aside now the elect of God and only the elect of God will also experience trials and tests of Faith Trials of faith and they're the only ones that get the privilege and you might say I'd rather not have that but if you want to be an elect of God that's just what goes along with the territory these trials of Faith but as we go through I hope you'll understand maybe why God does that and how God uses those things they're not done to punish us they're not done with ill intent everything God does is with care attention and with thought and with intent and the point of it is too it is not just Satan's idea it's not that well we're a child of God and Satan's out to get us so we have to expect that no it's not that Proverbs 17 and3 will give us the first clue Proverbs 17 and3 says the fining pot is for silver and the furnace is for gold but the Lord trith the heart the Lord trith the heart not he uses Satan's just a tool he's just a a tool in God's hands but it is the Lord that tries the hearts now the trying of your faith as I said I don't want this to be a negative thing but but God does that because he knows there's something in you that he wants to perfect there's something in a child of God but we're we're like that unrefined Diamond we're we're like that gold that's got impurities in it brother brandom talked in the message time tested memorials have gone he said years ago before they had the smelters they would take the gold and they would beat it they would beat it he said and it turn it and they would beat it and they turn it and they would beat it and he said they would beat it until the beater could see their reflection in the gold so the gold before it was beaten was not in a very good condition and that's the way you and I were as we come to Christ we know God does a work in our lives but we're still not really where we should be we start out as a babe in Christ and we need to grow we need to mature God needs to get us to a place place where he can really work with us and use us and he does that one of the ways he does that is through these tests and these trials so brother bam used the example of the beater beating the gold and he then says this he said that's the way that God does to his church he gives you trial after trial and test after test trial after trial so don't look at those things as punishments they're not they're not punishments they have a purpose test after test brother Bram said until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life and so if it takes those things we it's not that we go looking for trouble none of us wants that if we could avoid it we would never have a trial but the reality is God gives those trials to us because he's trying to bring something out of us something in our character we're not we're not here to serve God just to attend church we all have a purpose every one of us have a purpose in the kingdom of God we talk about being a member of God's body well you know my physical body has many members and they all have a purpose my fingers and toes and everything have a purpose and so you have a purpose and I have a purpose and God is trying to mold and make us trials and testings are one of the tools one of the things that God does to bring us to that place where he can use us he said he gives you trial after trial test after test so the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful and sober and meek and gentle humble ready submissive willing he said turn your head from the things of the world looking straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times he said you think it's strange because fiery trials which is the scripture and sickness and persecution he said it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you it's only done to get the dirt out of you test you get the dirt get the sludge out of you he said to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or he said men can see the reflection of Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory brother brandham said in another place and I don't have it here but you've all heard this brother Bram said that we are the only we our hands are the only hands that God has you've all heard that quote many times I'm sure we are the mouthpiece of God you know we are the only so so so God wants to and he also said brother said that God uses man to redeem man and so we see out there in the world we have loved ones you have a nice church here now I told the brother today now you need to fill fill the church up now we know it's we know we're at the end time and and we're get you know we're getting down to the end but you know there must still be somebody left there there must still be a seed somewhere because once all of those come in the prophet taught us once that last one comes in we're going to go home so maybe it's here it could be here in St John's that last we don't know where it is but who whose job is it to get that last one in it's yours it's mine and how do we do that by getting ourselves in the place the best way to witness is to be a light to be let your life the prophet said be your Pulpit out there in the world on your job or wherever you are and the people you associate with to live such a life that brother Bram said it would attract it causes an attraction how many people did Brother Bram talk about in different ones that were drawn to to to give their life to God because of a life they saw that was lived sincere life in testings and trials and they watch your life see how you respond when things are difficult then they see that's we know that's not that's not something that just ordinary people can do be on the job a circumstance come up and how people will fly off the handle and then they look at you and you see you don't do that you don't fly off the handle you're calm and you don't get upset that's because there's something different people look for that people in the world are looking for the reality of it but they just don't see it they see lots of professing Christians but then when the test comes they see something different my wife works as a nurse in the emergency room and there's been different times people have come in and she mentioned one time about you know there's people that have come in that have professed Christianity some that even ministers and things would come in and then you find out sometimes when they're suffering and in pain you see another side of their character things come out of their mouth that you would think well they're supposed to be a Christian and here's all the people seeing that all the nursing look at that and think here's somebody who's profess to be a Christian look what the attitude that they have and so when they look at that they think well is there any Christians anywhere but there are and so you and I that God wants to have people on this Earth that are going to be whether whether things are going easy or whether they're going hard you're the same you react the same you act the same you're still you still have a faith you still have a testimony for God that that the people can see so that's what God is trying to do with these testing you know the beating with the gold you know the beating does not diminish the gold you know he's beating it sounds like a rough thing to do it doesn't hurt the gold at all it's getting rid of the sludge it's getting rid of all the other stuff but it doesn't hurt the gold you think the trial hurts you but it doesn't trials my mom used to always say trials are to make us better not bitter she always said that your trials to make you better not bitter God is not giving us these things because he wants to cause us to fail there's nothing that God will bring your way that's designed for you to fail God wants you to succeed God wants you to to to grow stronger brother Brown said in Jehovah Gyra 1957 in Phoenix he said God loves how God loves to test his people every child that comes to God must be tested child trained no exceptions no exceptions he said everyone and then he used the this example he said maybe tonight you're sick just to have some child a little child training just a little testing he said don't be discouraged God is on the throne he knows all things if we're truly born of the spirit of God everything is working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised that he would he swore that he would he's got to keep his word in another message communion 1957 Jeffersonville he said when we get right with God and when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken its place in our heart now think about that he said when we get right when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken its place in our heart he said it's the most glorious thing to have testing not the way in our it doesn't make human sense to us to think that but brother B say it's the most glorious thing to have testing the Bible says that our testings and trials are more precious to us than silver or gold so he said we should be thankful I know that doesn't make sense it doesn't make human sense it doesn't make any sense from from a natural point of view but God doesn't think the way we do God doesn't work the way we do it is the honor I believe it was Charles burgeon might have said that the honor of Faith to be tried I want to go to Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 where it speaks about God and it's using the uh the analogy as a were of God is the father and how that he works with his children I want to pick it up at the 4th verse of Hebrews 12 again speaking about trials he said you have not resist he said you have not yet resisted onto blood striving against sin Hebrews 12:4 and then verse five ye have and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my my son despise not now the chastening of the Lord now the word chastening you know we think about chastening sometimes as as punishment but that's not really the intent here in this word this chastening uh the way it's used here in the scripture and if you look in the Greek it's it's a the chastening is a word that means it means that it's designed what God is doing as a father is designed for our Improvement so it's not it's not a punitive word it's it's a nurturing instructive term when it talks about chastisement we sometimes in our minds think about chastisement as punishment but that's not the intention of what it is here he said uh despise not now the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and it is with God's love so the this the chastisement doesn't come so much from God's hand the way we think of punishment but it comes from God's heart comes from God's heart it's God's love for us and really if a father you know the Bible says in the B was in Proverbs that he that spareth the rod we always use the it's not the scripture but people use if you spare the rod you spoil your son that's not what the Bible says Bible says if you spare the rod you hate your son he that spareth the rod hateth his son that's actually the Scripture it doesn't say spoiled it says hated why because chastisement as we raise our children if we love them we are not going to let them do things that are going to cause them to grow up and have a bad character and so as a good father as hard as it may be there's times we have to chastise our children but but we're supposed to do it with a lot we should never do it in Anger it's got to be something that's done with love and that's how God is he's our best example example of of a father he does it with love every child the L for whom the Lord loveth verse six he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth and so he said if you endure that chastening God will deal with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not and and and here's the thing you say I don't want to be chastised well the Bible says if ye be without chastisement verse 8 whereof all are partakers are ye bastards and not sons and so it goes on in that scripture in verse 9 speaking about the fathers of the flesh it said the fathers we have had the fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence but shall we not much more much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they if you notice verse 10 for they verely for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure and what that's really speaking about and all of us have been guilty as as as fathers many of us probably have been guilty as fathers that sometimes our our chastening has an element of of of our own feeling into it so we come home from work and you're tired and and you know and and and the little boy or girl has been bad and the mom comes along and you you don't feel like doing it because you're tired and so sometimes your chastening is it isn't it's subjective but with God it's not like that so we sometimes you know ER in that sense but the Bible says he does it for our profit his chastening to us is always about what's best for us it's all about what's best for us and so when we're in a trial and we're in a test like that understand that God is giving us that for some benefit to us it's for our profit that we might also be partakers of his Holiness so why while it's not an easy thing while it's not not an enjoyable thing to experience God is thinking about something good every time he brings it our way whatever that trial might be it's for some profit for some benefit to us and so as we said we're not going to escape those things brother brandham said and sometimes those tests seem hard brother brandham used the word cruel in in the message communion 1957 he said if God did not spare his own son from the cruel test he will not spare you and I from the cruel so sometimes it seems cruel sometimes it seems hard but it's still it's still for our purpose for our for our benefit for our profit I want to to look at some characters in the scripture and the first one I want to look at is is job I want to go to job chapter 1 we're all familiar with job's trial and this test and how but I want to I want to focus on how it come to be we said that it's it's not just Satan's idea these trials but the Lord tries the hearts well it was the same thing with job the record of job in Job chapter 1 and verse one is that there was a man from The Land of Oz whose name was job and the man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and issued evil that's what the scripture says you might say well that's just what somebody wrote well when you go further down and of course you read and we're won't won't go through all of that but we know job did sacrifice for his family he was very careful in the way that he lived and so job is living if you can just imagine job is going about his life living a righteous life doing the best that he can and and and completely oblivious to something that's about to take place in that other in one of those other dimensions that he wasn't didn't have access to and that is verse six we drop to verse six he said there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them now this this uh scene that we're reading about right here is something that job is not privy to he's not aware that this is going on job is just carrying on and conducting his life and doing his thing and so he's there and Satan comes among into this little meeting that's going on and verse 7 the Lord said un to Satan when thou comest thou and Satan answered the the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job and now this is God speaking hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect this is God now God is calling a man born in sin he's calling this man job who's no different than you and I just a man perfect and upright man one that fearth God and asseth Evil job's trial started with God prompting Satan there in that realm I'm saying have you ever thought basically have you ever thought about job have you ever thought about testing job have you ever thought about seeing if you can cause job this is just me paraphrasing he's not saying all those words there but he's he's setting up this scene he's making a way Satan would love to test job I'm sure he's always wanted to test job but remember Satan can't do anything that God doesn't allow he can't he can't do anything to you that God doesn't allow and so we we say well the devil is after me and this and that but but he can't do one thing that God doesn't allow But Not only was God going to allow him to be tested he was basically baiting Satan in here he was basically offering up job uh you know job's not aware of this at least at this point that we you know that's that's the way tests work you know you don't get the answers you don't know about those things you find out later you go to school do a test you know you're presented with the problem you don't have the answer you're supposed to provide the answer well job job doesn't know this is coming and God doesn't come down and tell him by the way job I'm going to set you up you're going to have a little test next week no job's not aware he just going along his day-to-day business meanwhile in heaven there's this conversation going on and I would like to submit to you that probably job's not the only one that God's had that conversation about you know and so you might be going along brother Bob's you know seemed pretty happy we had good Fellowship today but you know God and Satan there could be another conversation going on and you might be in the middle of that conversation and tomorrow your day might change have you considered my servant Bob coffee a perfect man upright man or one of you you don't know that and and we've all experienced that our day starts out good and all of a sudden something happens had no idea where did this come from where did this problem come from and you're doing the best you can I've been doing pretty good and all of a sudden you get hit with something in your life could be sickness it could be some other trial where did that come from Jo was in the same boat he didn't know this was coming and so God releases you know takes the Hedge away a little bit you you all know these scriptures and and he lets Satan try job first day one day you can read all the different things he did took his children all kinds of stuff just in a day he did all these things testing job but you see God knew what job would do he knew how job would respond before he responded when I look at that I'm thinking if that happened to me what would I do but see God knew what job would do and so one thing that we we have confidence in and well there's a couple scriptures we'll look at is that God knows you as well and so you look at that and say well if if that happened to me I don't know if I could do that but God is not going to test you the Bible says that too above what you're able to bear so he knows what level you're at but but you know in order for you to progress even in school you know you go to school and you learn things and you're taught this and you're taught that but you don't really to really know if you've absorbed what you've been taught you've got to be tested that's why they test you you you learn math or different things and and so they'll set you down and they'll throw a test at you and that test will really you might think you got it you might think yes I I know exactly I understand it and then you get the testerone at you and then you look at it and maybe you didn't understand it as well as you thought or maybe you did but God knows before the the test comes every test that God brings your way you're capable of passing because you've already got what you need but those tests are designed to build and same with school you build and you build and you build one on top of the other and that's the way God works and so he knows what level you're at he knows what kind of a test is going to be just the right test to allow you to make another step because everything that God brings your way every test he brings your way is to move you higher it's not to knock you down it's not to to set you backwards but it's to move you forwards and so he knows how to test but we need to be aware we we should not we should we should understand we should not be surprised as we as the scripture says you know the fiery Trials Come different things come we should not be surprised we should not be caught off guard we know that as Christians God's going to allow that because it's part of our walk it's part of our development that God wants to to bring in our in our in our life but you know when we go through those things one of the hard Parts about testing is you know when you're tested again I go back to school you know you're you're on your own in a test or at least it appears you're on your own certainly in in in the natural you're on your own well sometimes in these spiritual tasks that we go through it it seems like we're on our own and so I want to read a couple of scriptures in Isaiah 50 and because you know we call ourselves Children of the light the Bible says we are children of light and so the idea of being in darkness is is a is a concept that doesn't really make sense to us but there's a scripture in Isaiah 50 and10 that I want to read because it speaks about something that we might think is how could this be Isaiah 50:10 it says who is among you that feareth the Lord so understand who that that it's speaking about it's not talking about the sinner but who among you is he that feareth the Lord that fearth the Lord obeys the voice of his servant so now we we kind of understand who we're talking about who is that person that walketh in darkness and has no light and so you look at that and you say well how is that possible we're children of Light how could we walk in darkness but it's not talking about walking in false Doctrine or walking out there no it's talking about this kind of situation where we come across something in our life yes we're children of light but God sometimes brings allows things to come our way and we enter sometimes into a place where we don't know exactly what it's about and we can't see the way forward it's that situation the situation of trial when God brings the trial and all of a sudden we don't actually know maybe when it first comes upon us what is this about and how where do I go from here I feel like I'm in a dark place and God does that on purpose sometimes he puts us in these situations where for a moment we're looking and we we can't see the way for we can't even see we don't know what this is about we feel like we're in darkness and God hasn't warned us about it because it's a test he hasn't warned us he hasn't told us I don't know why this is coming I didn't anticipate this happening to me it's a test it's a trial you're walking in darkness and you have no light but here's what it says for you to do because this is not speaking to speaking of about you and me it says let him trust or her let him trust or her Trust In The Name Of The Lord that's because what is what is it talking about when it's talking about trust it's talking about faith in those trials because Faith you know Faith doesn't really serve much purpose if you don't have a problem if you're you know I I'm standing here tonight and I I don't I'm not sick I I feel pretty healthy so I don't need faith for healing because I'm not sick but but if I get sick and I want God to to heal me that's when my faith goes to work faith is the Bible says a substance of things that we hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen when we're in a trial and we don't know where to go you know God puts us in those places where where we have to reach out and we have to put trust we have to have faith and those those are things that we're not comfortable doing we want to we want to have control of everything and we want to to make the next step and know just what we're doing but sometimes God places Us in in situations where we don't know where to go and all of a sudden now we got to look up and we got to put trust or exercise our faith in God to say I don't know where to go from here but it says here let him trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his God that's the counsel here in Isaiah 50:10 that we do that and so it is that when we're in these trials and then as we put our trust in God you know somewhere along the way through this through your trial and through my trial God will begin to bring some light and begin to open a way and and let us know the direction that we need to go but you know he doesn't always give us the whole the whole light the whole pathway you know there's a scripture speaks about walking in the light as he is in the light and and you know if you're out it's dark now if you go outside and you were to go out away from all the natural lighting into the woods and down a trail somewhere and you had a flashlight with you you know you you you put that light on and and you that light allows you to see ahead so far depending on the depending how good a light you have you may see 10 ft maybe you see 20 ft but you know you don't see the whole pathway you only see so much so if you want to know where to go you got to walk in the light and you walk in that light you go 10 feet you go 20 feet and then you can see another 10 feet or 20 feet well it's kind of that way we serving the lord the Lord doesn't always lay out the whole pathway I can see where this is going a lot of times you don't know where it's going but you know The Next Step you have to make or the next couple of steps you have to make and you know what you're not going to see any more till you make those steps same as in the natural if I want to know what's at the end of the trail I've got to walk in that light and then as I go I see a little further oh there's a turn I got to turn up here I got to go there same way serving the lord we want to see the whole thing laid out to know exactly how it all comes together it doesn't work like that God leads us one step at a time one day at a time job in the middle of this trial that he was in Imagine job a man of God was righteous man made and prayed and all of these things in his darkest moments and like Isaiah 50:10 when we get sometimes into these deeper trials one of the things that's most difficult for us is that when we go to reach out to God in the middle of this deep trial we sometimes have trouble to find him we sometimes sometimes it's easy but sometimes we can be in a place like job job I want to go to job 23 job was in this this situation where he tried when he got to a certain point in his trial he tried to find God he wanted an audience with God and you know that's what we would do too but job found himself now that wasn't it didn't last forever no trial that God brings your way is going to last forever we need to understand that whatever comes your way if God brings you to it he's going to bring you also through it you've got to have faith in that but here's job understand that this can also happen I bring this here because it it happened to job it can happen to you can happen to me job 23 verse 8 through to 10 job's looking for God he says behold I go forward but he's not there so job is earnestly trying to find God because he knows that God has has the answers he said I go forward but he's not there and he said and I go backward but I cannot perceive him now job is aware that God is somewhere and he's trying to find him he said I go forward and I go backward but I cannot perceive him he said then he said on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him and then he acknowledges something that's it's almost sad to hear it but true as it was he said he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him so job is is is even acknowledging that you know God could be visible if he wanted to but he has chosen at this moment to hide himself I'm looking for him I want to see him I want to talk but he's chosen to hide himself where I can't see him brother brandom had those situations too where he sought for God and it's like God wasn't anywhere and different ones in the Bible you know go through those periods we all go through those times and we're we're in a trial and we want God to to step in and sometimes there's a period that goes by where we can't seem to find him but job had a great Revelation that we also need to have verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take he knows the way that I take and so you're in this pit you cannot see your hand in front of you you don't know where to go but God knows exactly where you are and he's allowed you to be there and he's not intending to keep you in the dark no but the Bible says job says he said he knows a way that I take and when he ha tried me I shall come forth as gold he knew this wasn't going to last and you could be in a trial or not but if you are and when you are because if you're a Christian you're going to go through them it's not going to last forever it's going there's going to be a win there's going to be a when it's over it's not always that way remember it's a land of hills and Valley so you could be in a valley right now but but you're not going to stay there but you also don't stay on the mountain top either you know we get up in the mountain top we don't want to leave but we have a journey and the journey to one mountain requires you to go through a valley sometimes to get to the next one we're on a journey but God will take us through every Mountain he'll bring us up every Mountain he'll bring us through every Valley it's the kind of God that we serve but you know when we're in those situations we don't always feel as strong a lot of you know we don't look at ourselves the way God does I think about Gideon in the Bible when they were you know impoverished with the Philistines I believe it was that were after them and and here comes a man of God to Gideon and and Gideon was himself a man of God the angel of the Lord I believe it is come in the form of a man to Gideon and he says you know uh he said the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor well you know what if if you ask Gideon if he thought he was a mighty man of Valor I would say he would say absolutely not CU he went on to say well if God be with us why is all of this befallen us so he didn't see that he didn't see himself in that condition you don't often when you're in trial especially see yourself as a Victorious Christian you feel like you're defeated maybe but God doesn't look at you the way you look at yourself he's looking at you through the word he's looking at he's seeing what what he's intending for you to be and he's and he's moving with each test and trial towards that state and that condition it's his desire to do that everything that he brings is for our profit and so these kinds of things these are the real Trials of faith that Peter is speaking about that we read in our opening scripture and so it isn't and it shouldn't be as it says also in Peter in 1 Peter 4: 12- 14 it said it says to think it not strange 1 Peter 4:12 think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but sometimes we do think it strange sometimes we think why am I going through this why did this happen and it happens to all of us and even people who served the Lord a long time you know brother car lost his wife not you know almost two years it's been almost two years it will be this may and you know all that he's gone through I look at that sometimes and I think he he's going to be 94 next month and and here at that age after he's gone through many things and God has delivered him and still he gets this trial he calls it his biggest thing he's ever gone through and you think well it doesn't seem fair you know when you look at it in your human self why would why wouldn't God just you know we have these things and we don't want but but but the Bible says think it not strange think it not strange God allows that why we don't know we don't understand you know the purpose of it but we have to be we have to trust that God well we do know God knows what he's doing but certainly that God has a good intention even in that and you know we can see I can see the difference you know I can see in the ministry and God is still continuing to use him we appreciate what God is doing but you know would I want to experience that what would I do and we all look at those things say why why but but the Bible says here think it not strange as though something strange thing happen to you but rejoice in fact it says to Rejoice well that's hard to do that's hard to do in the middle of the trial you can Rejoice after you're over and you get back on the mountain again but he's saying even when we're going through it that we should have that attitude to rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when the glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceeding Joy you know uh one of these days we will be past this and this life right now seems big and it's all we know but one of these days it will be over and sooner than later and I know brother Carr talked about his when he talked about his wife and being married 70 years they celebrated 70 years just a couple months before sister car passed and you know he said it just seemed like a few moments of time he said it wasn't long enough you know and so when when we get over there you know there's a song a sister in our church used to sing you know the toils of the road will seem nothing when we get to the end of the way when this is over and we get on the other side even if we have the memory of all that we went through when we see what's there Beyond I I spoke at home a little bit recently about about what brother Bram said about beyond the curtain of time and I began to to look into what brother Brown said about that and it's and it's so amazing to think you know those people that have gone on before us uh the the Believers that have gone on before you know they're not in any distress they're not fretting they're not worrying they know we are I thought of sister uh Bram the hope that was there when brother brandham was allowed to see her he was so he was trying to take his life you remember how upset he was and here's a man that saw the power of God in his early Ministry and when he lost his wife and his daughter it was it was a very very serious time for him and and and so hope speaks to him there and I thought it was interesting you know because we can't see into that Dimension unless the Lord would allow but it seems though sometimes they can see into ours because she she told uh brother Bram she said you you have to stop worrying well how did she know he was worrying how would she be aware of that if she's in that Dimension but she was aware of it he said you got to stop worrying about us we're all right here no worries here you know so that's that there's no concern you know those of us that we lose when we weep and we mourn it's it's not about them they're in a good place it's for us that are left behind but one of these days we'll be there too you know we just have to get through this life and and so these trials are all about that are all about positioning us and getting us to that place where where we'll be ready but also uh getting us to that level where God desires us to be looking at a few other characters and uh Abraham you know was another man of God that we when we when we preach any time a message about faith is preached we almost always mention Abraham Abraham and faith we kind of put the two together what why do we talk about Abraham when we talk about faith what made Abraham's Faith significant was the fact that it was tested you know if God had to come down to Abraham said when he was old and said you're going to have a child and then 9 months later the child was born we probably wouldn't talk a whole lot about Abraham's faith it God just did what he said he was going to do but but the thing with Abraham there were two great tests of his faith first one was years and years began to pass they kept getting older they kept getting older and here Abraham still stood and after 25 years here they are really old now you know and Abraham's still believing so his faith was tested that's why we talk about Abraham's faith because it was tested brother Brandon preached the message tested Faith produces goods tested faith not just Faith but tested Faith the other time that Abraham's Faith was tested when he was asked to sacrifice the very son that was promised to him he grows up to a certain point and God says you know uh the Bible says God tempted Abraham but the word tempt in that in the Hebrew really means test because God doesn't tempt the Bible says he doesn't doesn't tempt in that sense of it it was a test sends him up there and says you go slay your son make him a sacrifice well that doesn't even make sense Abraham didn't disagree he didn't contradict he didn't talk back he just went up fulfill ready to fulfill oh that that is that's you got to have faith to do that faith that somehow that God's going to do something and so he went up and did that and we see those those great tests of his faith that he passed those but those wouldn't have likely been easy for Abraham we don't know what went through his mind the Bible doesn't talk about about all of that but I'm sure it was not easy walking up that hill with his son knowing that he was going to have to inflict pain upon his son kill his son potentially and still not really sure how it was going to end but he did it anyways he did what God had told him to do he didn't know the outcome would be the way it was God didn't tell him you know he didn't give him the answer in advance he didn't know but God also knew as I said before God knows every time a trial comes he knows whether you're in a place to receive it or and a place to be able to deal with it and one of the scriptures that I always Drew strength from is in Psalms 103 Psalms 103 and 14 and we need to be mindful of this every time something comes our way as a Christian that God has this in mind for he knoweth our frame and rememberthe are dust so he knows our frame he knows how we're built and what we are able to to stand take take the natural example take a truck I have a half done truck you know that that's designed specifically engineered to to haul a certain load of course there's safety on it so you can go a little more but if you put too much of a load in that you're going to break it you're going to break something I had a trailer one time I was hauling out wood on and it was just a a homemade trailer and I loaded it up really good and I got partway out and the axle broke broke right in half well I had too much on it that frame wasn't meant for that kind of a load that much weight and so it's a but God knows our frame he knows your frame he knows mine he knows what you can handle so there as hard as it might seem when the trial comes we must look up and you know God knows that you were going to be able to handle that as hard as it was I preached this message one of the last times I preach it was in was in was in Maine actually a brother a pastor there had lost his son suddenly uh he just died died in his sleep and and he was so devastated that he he stopped preaching and two or three weeks after he passed he called me he said would you come and preach for me and when I went there I felt led to preach this message and and and I spoke to him there I said you know as hard as this is and I can't even imagine what that would be like but I said God brought this trial your way because he knew you were in a position to take it somewhere that's and he's back ministering and everything now but you know it could have that trial could have had the potential to destroy him you know if if if he if he let it it was it was hard and I can't even imagine it but I said God knew that that was going to happen and he knew that within you is the power to pass this task to overcome this and to get by this and he did get by it because God doesn't he knows our frame he knew his frame and he may not have felt like you might not feel like the trial that you go through sometime I don't know if I have have what it takes you do because God wouldn't give it to you if you didn't have what it took he knows where you're at he knows exactly where you're at so Faith you know we all need Faith the Bible says without it without faith it's impossible to please God so faith we must have absolutely but it's not that we have to have a lot you know the Bible says Jesus said if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you can say to this mountain be moved so it's not it's not a great amount of faith brother brandom said if you've got faith enough to walk across the floor you've got faith enough for anything that God has promised so it's not about that it's it's just simple faith is it's not so much that but I want to give you brother Bram giv a really good example I'm sorry about that never had that happen uh somebody trying to call me I didn't have my phone off he said if you got faith enough to walk across the floor you got faith enough for anything that God has promised simple Faith just simple Faith but here's what brother Brown used this example about it and and explained because you think well if if it's that simple why don't we get everything we ask for well brother Bram said speaking about the word he and we know that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word brother Bram said his word is a sword he speaks in Hebrews 4:12 and said the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword Discerning the thoughts that's in the heart brother brandom said the only thing that can handle this sword is a hand and he said the only thing that can handle God's word is Faith so he said if the word is a sword he said then Faith holds it Faith holds it and grips it and he said it's like he said when when people are dueling if the two men meet with these knives and they dueling he said he said that's you and the devil trying to get you to doubt so you're grabbing the word you you look in there and there's a promise you're going through something and you grab a hold of a scripture and a promise brother B said if you can put yourself in the scripture there and if God did something for for somebody and you've put yourself in there then he can do the same thing for you but you have to believe that he will do that you've got to have the faith that he will do that so he said you grab that word and you're he said it's like dueling and he said it's he said that's you and the devil trying to get you to doubt now here's the thing brother Bram said the sword that you got might be ever so good he said it's a million times better than his yours yours because you have the sharp two-edged sword he said it's a million times better than his he said I'm going to tell you his is not even a sword he said it's a stick but yours is a sword so he has a stick and you have a sword but brother Brown said this if the hand that holds the sword is is weak the stick can overcome it so here's Satan he doesn't even have what you've got but if you don't have faith brother Brandon said if the hand that holds a sword is weak the stick can overcome it but he said no matter how little this hand is if it holds the word of God with faith there's nothing going to do it it can put anything down so that's all you know so so sometimes we look at the promise and we we have a hard time perhaps to believe to really grab a hold of that and say that's for me but if we can get that that faith and get a hold of that promise with that strong hand of faith that you're going to say that's my promise that's mine that's for me and then the devil because what You' got is so much more powerful but if your faith is weak in what you're trying to accomplish you have a word here of promise that can defeat Satan in any circumstance there's something in there there somewhere for your circumstance if you can grab a hold of it but if your hand is weak the stick he said because that's all Satan has got it's just a stick he said the stick can overcome it but he said he's holding it and you're holding it and he's fighting and you know and and the devil's locking hands with you and he's saying you know it's wrong don't believe it and you're trying to believe it that's that's how that's how it works that's how Satan works but you know with faith it's this testing of the faith God starts you know the trying of the faith the faith builds you know you you you approach God and you believe for something and and then God answers and you do something and then and then as you see God working you know it builds faith is like a muscle it's like it it needs to be exercised and so as you exercise just the same in the natural as you exercise you build strength as you exercise your faith and believe in God and you see God do this it gives you more faith to believe that God can do something else but if but you've got to you know brother BR said we want to go in a Rapture and sometimes people don't have enough Faith to heal a cold it's kind of like that sometimes that we well well we're supposed to have rapturing faith as we talk about well we're being tested our faith is being tested and you know it's not all about it's also not all about getting what we asked of God you know I I'm I'm sick and I want to be healed and I pray and that's faith and a lot of times people look at faith that way it's it's about getting something but but I want to talk about another aspect of Faith here in a little bit I hope I'm not have no idea how long I've been but I'm going to go a little further with these tests that come our way there's always an element of choice I said a while ago the brother Bram said that when we're placed on this Earth we cannot go through life without being put in positions where we have to make choices it's it's intentional God puts it that way we'd like everything to be laid out as I said before but that's not the way it work works but God puts us in places where we have to make decisions and choices all the way through life and so that's getting us involved you know it's not all just God programming us a certain way no God puts us in here we're free moral agents and he gives us the opportunity to make choices and so there's always with every test that God brings our way there's this element of choice involved and how we respond to that Noah in his day you know was told it was going to rain he was given on option you know this is the answer build an ark and so on well Noah believed but Noah couldn't just believe the message he had a job to do he had an arc to build and it's it's not just a matter of believing God sent a prophet that's not going to be enough God is going to put us into periods and circumstances in life where we've got to we've got to do something we've got to exercise our faith we got to go out and work and there's something that we have to do so so Noah the prophet said Noah heard this word and he said before the there was one drop of water that fell from heaven Noah saw the rain coming so Noah had faith in what he had heard faith comes by hearing Noah heard about the Judgment he had never saw rain but he believed what God had said never saw a cloud never saw any of that but still he made preparations according to what God had said he did what needed to be done he saw the rain coming he couldn't just wait it was in in Noah's situation he couldn't just wait and see he he couldn't be well God said this I'll just wait and see what happens no that's not the way it is God gives us that and then it's like okay what are you going to do about it now throws you in a trial what are you going to do about it now you have a choice you can do nothing but then that that's going to impact the result Noah could not just do nothing he had to build an ark there was an ark that was the only answer in his day was for that Ark to be built if Noah didn't build it God wasn't going to build it it was his job to build the ark God gave him a word he gave him a he gave him the the the the the blueprints of what he had to do but he still had to go do it and so in our trials too there's something we have to do there's things that we have to do to move forward and then God will do his part and so he he built the ark did all of that people criticized him but it didn't stop him because he had faith in what he had heard God always keeps his word but you know sometimes he lingers brother Bram talked about in the days of Noah he said sometimes God lingers he said you know we read the promise in the scripture about how it says you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but brother Bram said you know he was praying one time he said you said that these signs shall follow them that believe but he said and you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but he said you never said when you never said when well sometimes in our mind we think that when we pray if we don't get an instant answer that means that God says no that he's not going to answer well that does that's not necessarily at all what it means he said you never said when the scripture says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's just a promise there there's no wi in there it's a promise well a lot of times it's put out there we exercise our faith and God lets it go because he's going to see how much Faith you got brother Brown said sometimes he lingers like he did in the days of Noah he did in the days of Moses he did Brother Bram said in all days he never told the Pentecostal people to go up to the city of Jerusalem and in 24 hours I'll give you the holy ghost He said T there until T there until you're ued so it's the same thing with with healing with anything else we have to stay and believe and put our faith out there until we receive what it is that we're asking of God for we just keep it out there whether it's one day two days or a month or however long it is if you're praying for your loved ones you know you might say it's been 10 years well I guess I guess God's not planning on doing anything so I'll just stop well you can't do that we have a sister in our church her mother who's now passed on uh she had uh raised this girl she was actually her granddaughter but she raised her and and uh and she went on aot to the world well she prayed for her for not just a year or two or a few months she prayed for her for something like 50 years and it was probably SE uh six 7 years ago now she gave her heart back to the Lord and we baptized her the church she's now faithful faithful serving the lord 50 50 years what if she stopped after 49 or 40 you know she prayed for 50 years and and but and she was for she was around to see it she passed away just a two three years ago uh but you know sometimes they're not even around for that you know go sometimes God will answer prayers even after but still you can't give up you can't say well it's been too long it must be God must not be going to do it don't don't ever give up on these things especially things like that praying for your loved ones that's a promise there you don't you you need to hang on to that and so just just keep going I I want to look at Daniel uh I want to look at Daniel for a moment in his time of testing Daniel chapter 6 you all know the situation there they put a statute out they were trying to trap Daniel and and they put a law out there that they couldn't pray to any other God and so on and I want to just jump to verse 10 just to show you how Daniel respond because sometimes in these trials Satan is trying to push you into a corner and get you to respond a different way well Daniel Daniel's religion just wasn't in when things were going well but he was prepared no matter what it was that he was going to stand and the Bible says in verse 10 Daniel 6:10 when Daniel knew when Daniel knew the writing was signed they made sure Daniel knew so it wasn't that Daniel just made a mistake oh I didn't realize there was this law you think about you know Daniel was just praying he could have went into his closet and shut the door prayed in secret you know there's a scripture about that praying in secret and the father would seeth and he could have did that for 30 days and he would had no trouble but see that wasn't Daniel's practice Daniel would kneel on his bed his windows being open he just that was the way Daniel Prayed he wasn't going to change his routine for what the devil was trying to do he could have changed it he could have done something different but he didn't he said when Daniel knew the writing of he went into his house the windows being open in his ch and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his his God as he did a four time didn't change his routine didn't didn't do something to make it easier for himself no that was the way that he served the Lord he wasn't going to change his routine just because of the pressure that the enemy was putting upon Him pressure that God allowed him to do we same thing we're going to I'm going to skip this one three Hebrew children same thing they were put under pressure but they stood but I do want to get a couple of other examples before I close and I want to pick I want to look at Jesus because we don't often think about Jesus being tested but brother Brown said he was and the scripture said he was and I want to go to Mark chapter 14 so if I can just just take a few more moments on this Mark chapter 14 beginning at verse 32 Jesus there come to a place it says which was named Gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit ye here while I shall pray and he took with him Peter and James and John and began to be so look at this these words here I mean there in the English it's kind of an odd use of of the word it said it began to be sore amazed so I looked the word up I said what do it mean to be amazed we don't we use that in a very different way but when I looked it up in the in the Greek it said that it meant terrified to alarm thoroughly well I look at that and you think well that was Jesus how is it possible that he could be terrified but remember he was he he was in all points tempted as we are he came in a body of Flesh you know he wasn't Superman if you shot you know if you if you stabbed him with a knife it wasn't going to bend and you know he had flesh just like you and me capable of feeling pain so if he if he was in all points tempted as we are then then we have to and it's hard for us to imagine that it would have to be reasonable to and we see it in the scripture that he could also experience fear in in his flesh we know that God has doesn't have no Fe fear and he said you know fear speaks about that but this word amazed in the scripture in the Hebrew sorry in the Greek means terrified to alarm thoroughly he was sore amazed and he began to be very heavy which means troubled or distressed or anguished or depressed so he experienced tremendous just like you and I if you can imagine getting ready knowing what's coming he knew what was coming and he also knew that he wasn't going to escape it yet remember we said there was a choice watch what he prays verse 34 sayith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful sorrowful unto death te ye here and watch and he went forward a little the Bible says he fell on the ground didn't say he kneeled down and said he fell on the ground he was under tremendous weight a tremendous pressure it wasn't an act what Jesus did for us was not an act he prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him watches notice this prayer in verse 36 and he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee notice this first part take away this cup from me and there's a pause there in the writing take away this cup for me what if he had a stopped there what if there was no end to that verse what if he what if he had to stopped there what would the father have done because remember the prophet said we were put into these situations of choice and so now he's asking his son is asking the father take this cup away from me and he stops there he just stops right there for a moment how how long doesn't doesn't say but there's a pause in there what if he had stopped there where would we be where would Our Hope be but he didn't stop there he said nevertheless but it's it's that choice that was presented nevertheless not what I will but what thou Wilt and brother B you say well I don't know if I see it that way let me read what brother Bram said in the message communion he said Jesus was here if there wasn't something that mattered in terms of Jesus response brother Bram wouldn't have spoke it this way he said Jesus was here confronting the greatest test test brother Bram said the greatest test that he ever had he was confronting the greatest test he ever had Gethsemane lay just before him once where that once and final all sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulders he said there there was no one in all of Heavens or Earth could ever stood it but him what that tells me is that there's not a person on Earth that when they got to that place wouldn't have turned around wouldn't have taken the easy Road brother Brown said he was the only one that could have Ood it to know he said that all of the sins this brother Bram he said to know that all of the sins the past sins the present sins and the future sins rested upon and brother Brown says this rested upon this decision he called it a decision it was his decision all of the sins all of us sitting here tonight that are here because we believe that the Lord has forgiven us our sins all of it hinged on this prayer on this moment on this trial what was he going to do his decision rested upon this decision and he said it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great messiahship when he said to God not my will thine be done he said that was the greatest Victory he ever won all of the Demons of Torment he said were around to tempt him and to try him they were all there you imagine the pressure that he was under and then at that moment he makes that choice not my will but thine be done we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't for that well in a much much lesser way we are also thrown into things like that where we have to make choices and things happen and things come that are pure by designed to make us fail but they're actually designed to make us stronger our Prophet went through brother Brandon went through similar test we talked about a few moments ago if you just allow me to go just a little bit further he said I remember that great and final test that I had of my Christian experience this is in the brother brand in the same message actually communion the Great and final test I had of my Christian experience it was Yonder in the hospital out there and that was when his wife had had passed and his baby was there she had not passed just yet and he was there and he said the testings and trials were on he said he said it wasn't just somebody saying Billy you're a ho Holy Roller he said that's not much testing and these other little Trials of criticism from the men that I work with he said that wasn't much testing but he said my great hour of testing come when doctor ad dare uh come by and he met him and he said your baby is dying there's not a chance for it to live it's got tubercular menitis and and brother brand said surely not doctor surely not and and and here's a mother laying there a corpse he said so he kneels down and he prays with the doors closed and I said oh god father here's my wife and the baby's mother laying Yonder and The Undertaker's morg and Billy Paul's on the bed he's sick and my baby's done dying surely you won't take her I love her and she resembles her mother I want to raise her won't you please oh God spare my baby's life well how many people had brother bread and prayed for probably not even that earnestly that God raised up how many people he would have prayed for that was maybe even worse than that and he and and he so he had all of that behind him so it wasn't a lack of the faith to see God's hand move but it was a different type of faith that was being tested now so he prays that prayer and you can imagine what why now so God we got all the scriptures you know that would be there to say well you know if you're if if a son asked the father of a fish you're not going to give him so you would think here's God looking down why wouldn't he just why wouldn't he just do that but here's what brother random experienced like job he said as you all know I've been subject to Visions he said it seemed like a black sheep began to unfold coming down as if God took my prayer and threw it right back in my face and you know you and I have gone through I've gone through trials you probably have too where you've cried out to God about something and it seems like your prayer is not going nowhere well brother Bram experienced that too doesn't mean it isn't going anywhere but that's what brother brandham felt at that moment and not only that he didn't heal the baby either after him so earnestly praying he said it's like he threw the prayer back in my face and he prayed he said I'll do anything he said what have I done even after that brother Brown kept intreating god' he said' what have I done have I done something if I transgress your laws and if it is let me know I'll repent I'll do anything don't take my baby and then he said I saw she was going anyhow and then you know the black sheet the darkness like job the tempter comes right after of course he comes in those moments when when it seems like you're the weakest the tempter come to me the one that was there he said there was the one time here's what brother Brown said there was the one time in all my life that I can call was The crucial moment my Gethsemane my Gethsemane he said I was barely holding on to the bed and the devil said there you are there's the reward for trying to serve him you mean that he'll take that young 22y old mother and lay her Yonder in the corpse and that precious baby your own flesh and blood and slam your prayer in your face and you mean to say that you'll serve him and you know it was not a simple thing brother brandham said I was standing between opinions here's the decision again I was standing between opinions it had to be decided you know what's interesting he was in that place like we talked about walking in darkness can't find God God wasn't there Whispering brother brand doesn't even say anything about God whispering in his ear he just heard the Devil then so he was in that low point where looking for God looking for something that would give him some understanding but he said it had to be decided he couldn't let it go and then he said I put my hand on her head and he said I I said the lord gave and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and when he did that brother Bram said I felt relief so God came in but it was a test God couldn't come in and give him relief until he passed that test he had to pass that he had to make that statement he had to go that far to make that statement and God probably wanted to he probably wanted to try to help him with it just like we do our children sometimes you know we see them struggling you know there's things that we can help them with but there's some things that they have to they have to make sometimes they have to make their own mistakes sometimes we have to let them do that it's the hardest thing to do we want to always protect them and do everything but sometimes the only way they're going to learn you know we you talk about the hot stove and the kid and you tell them don't touch don't touch well you know some kids are not going to learn till they touch themselves some are like that some if you tell them they'll listen to you other ones and we all know probably who they are we probably can think of people like that they have to touch the stove before they're going to learn well sometimes it God allows that for us too and so he let him go and and and and then of course he passed he passed this test and so it puts into that there puts the the scripture in Luke 18 and 18 into context there's a scripture in Luke 18 where and this is the end of a parable I don't want to talk about the parable but I just you you you're probably familiar with it but he he talked about at the end of this Parable he makes a statement he said I I tell that he will avenge them speedily so I'm kind of at the middle of something but just notice this part nevertheless when the son of man cometh Luke 188 shall he find faith on the Earth shall he find Faith now that faith is not the kind of faith that you know when you lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's Faith all right the kind of Faith he's looking for is people that are still believing because the Bible tells us in Timothy that in the latter days some shall depart from the faith Satan is trying to tear away the faith that you have faith in this message faith in the gospel in the book of Jude it talks about in the that we need to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's what that's what's at stake right now is is is our faith in this truth there's people out there talking the message talking The credibility of of the Prophet trying to discredit him and and so that if you can discredit the prophet then you just discredit the message and and there's pastors that have walked away and all of those different things that have taken place but God is going to have a people that are going to stand the test and they're going to keep the faith they're not going to lose they're going to contend and that word contend in Jude means to it's like wrestling you got to fight for it it's not going to be easy sometimes we're going to have to put an effort into it but God is going to have a people that are going to hold on to that Faith the Bible says he that endures until the end the same shall be saved there was a you all uh probably are I'm sure you're all familiar with this brother Brandon when he went to to Africa Africa to South Africa there was a book written of prophet visit South Africa by Julius stad club and his wife sister stads Club had a had a baby and they were good friends of brother Bram and the the baby lived for a while uh I don't know it was maybe a few months I can't I asked brother George one time not sure just how long she lived but uh the baby lived but then it died and they called brother brandom and said you know come come and pray and they they have her all ready to to hire you know to to get a plane to bring brother brandom over to pray for this baby well brother brandham you know they were friends but brother brandham was always conscious about these things to seek the will of God first and so brother Brandon went out and I remember reading this and I think I I don't know if I have yes I do have it here brother bandam went out imagine this now there are so many needs I we hear of needs all the time different ones sick and brother Daryl the other day I don't know if you know brother Daryl Ward but his sister has got cancer and he just sent me a message the other day she's she's uh uh they given up on her only given her three months to live well that's just one of many needs well here's one need brother brandom said I went out and I prayed all night and they weren't family they were just good friends he prayed all night for that one need I wonder the last time I prayed and you prayed all night for a need wonder if some have ever prayed all night for any need but you know we want God to do things but sometimes we're not willing to put the work and not willing to put the prayer in sometimes for these needs brother Brandon prayed all night and he said nothing happened he prayed all night and comes back in never got nothing he comes in and he's walking in the room he said and then the the light come over the door and told him he said don't put your hand on that don't rebuke that it's the hand of God now I won't get into that part of it but just the fact that it said don't rebuke it meant what did that mean brother brandham had some you know uh rapport with God in the sense that he might have been able to do something there but he he wanted God's will the Bible says you ask anything according to his will he hears us and you might think well it's a baby why wouldn't it be but God has a will so he calls sister stfb he said bury your baby it's the hand of the lord it's God's Will and sometimes that's hard I know we've had ones family the people that we know that have lost young children at times and tragic circumstances and it's like well why why would that happen you know and what does it mean how could that be but he said he he said it's it's the hand of the lord it's God's will something would happen to the baby down along the line leave it where God knows where it's at and so and so he he tells him that and then she comes by to visit some sometime after that a few months after they come over they're visiting brother brandham and here's the thing I want to talk as we're talking about the trial of your faith and as we try to wind down he said she comes over and asked brother brandham she said brother brandham was it was it my we weakness of Faith was it my weakness of Faith now the words that the baby wasn't it was just my faith not where it should be and brother Bram responded this way he said you have great faith you have great faith and here's here's how he describes it he said you have great faith you prayed for your baby you and your husband held on to it for God to raise the baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and you still love him he said that is real faith that's real Faith see he said anybody when the mountains are moving and things can have faith but he said Let It Go backwards one time and see how it works he said that's when you prove whether you have faith or not but see sometimes we think well it's if I pray and somebody's healed that means I got faith well that's that's that's one way of but sometimes it's the other way that God that's the kind of faith I think that when God is trying your faith it's more about that than it is about whether somebody receives healing or not he said that's when you prove you've got faith or not every son that cometh to God must be chasen and tried of God remember our trials Works patience and patience Works hope so he said we just hold on to God whether He blesses us or not we are right there to believe him anyway because he's promised it we've got to get to the place like Paul Paul said you know Paul Paul said in Acts 20 vers 23 and 24 he comes you know he he gets the right Revelation there on the road to Damascus and everything and he's changed and but he says in the scripture he said the Holy Ghost witnessed to me in every city that bonds and afflictions abide me so so Paul had a revelation that trouble was going to be coming his way but verse 24 he said but none of these things move me see Paul understood it and we must come to that place too we'll get over one trial we'll come through we'll have a little Mountaintop experience and then we know we have to keep going and probably down the road there'll be another but God takes us through I already see that I've seen so much in my life now I know that no matter how much we strive we always strive for things to be better but there's always going to be things coming and we can't live in fear and worry and and fretting about what's coming no we just deal with the day that we're in now let God work with us in this day but not be moved that's the thing that Paul was he was in such a condition you know I I I read one time where it said Paul lived in you know everybody and Paul lived in this certain one but they say everybody lives in one of two tents either content or discontent you know we live in one of two tents and Paul was like that way I've learned in whatever state I am in there with to be content is another scripture and so we have to be that way whether we're in trial whether Paul was in prison you know we we read all these letters of Paul and he's so he's writing such inspirational words sometimes he was in house rest sometimes he was he was he didn't have his freedom when he wrote those things and we look wow what inspiring words Paul's conditions weren't very good when he wrote some of those inspiring words and some of the greatest inspiration some of the greatest songs that we sing that we get inspiration from that give us Faith are written by people that have gone through tremendous trials It Is Well with My Soul For example Oro spafford and different ones like that great trials and great testings but here's the thing and I'm going to close I I really am in Deuteronomy chapter 33 there's a verse of scripture that I would want want to bring to encourage us as we go through this life and we do encounter and if you're in the middle of a trial now it's approach that you need to take is not to try to look way far ahead and say well what's going to happen and where are we going to go what's going to happen tomorrow or next week don't worry about tomorrow or next week Deuteronomy 33 and 25 says this thy shoes shall be iron and brass and sometimes that's the way it feels when we go through life but I want you to notice this last half of the verse as thy and as thy days so shall thy strength be I believe you know this a song the Lord give me the strength to do every day what I have to do and that's what this is talking about I believe that each day you get down on your knees you know as Charles Spurgeon once said he said before you behold the face of man each day you should behold the face of God and when you do that you want God to give you that strength but just just for today let tomorrow and the be the Bible speaks about that take no thought for tomorrow if you read that scripture it means don't worry don't take anxious thought and so we don't it's not that we don't think about we have to plan there's things in our life we have to do but we never worry we should never worry about tomorrow we should never worry about anything but about tomorrow but but let God give us the strength today so so you've got this long trial you're going through well what what do I need today what do I got to do today how do I need to respond and let God give you that and then tomorrow when tomorrow comes God will give you the strength for tomorrow because as your days so shall your strength be amen I think I'm going to just stop there or I will go for a while so we don't want to do that Amen Let Us stand as they come to the instruments I don't know as I said it's one of the benefits of coming like here like this not knowing I have no idea where things are and where people are at but I I know that God knows all of us he knows our cares he knows our troubles he knows what we have need of and whatever trial and whatever test we're going through you know if we could just learn to trust God and cast our cares upon Him He he's there to always look after us there's a song I I didn't see it in your song I don't know if you know it or not but there's the song the god of the mountain is still God in the valley you know that one yeah maybe we can sing that life is easy when you're on the mountain but you know the god that we serve he he's not only around when there's when things are going well he's around in trouble you might not see him but he's always there he might be just out of sight but he's always there he's always around to help you when you're in need amen let's just try that song Together life is easy when you're up the m and you've got peace of mine like you've never known but then things change and you're down in the valley don't lose fa for you're never alone or The God on the Mountain he's still God in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them R and the god of the good times he still God in thead the god of the is still in the talk of fa you're up on the mountain the talk comes so easy when life

down to earth right it's a like preaching amen because it's reality right praise the Lord I really believe that amen let's saying it's uh I think it's 12:19 no longer a slave to fear and that's uh that kind of strikes me when brother was preaching because we as we know we said it times times before that it is fear that the devil uses against us and he throws and God on allows him to use that obviously but by Grace we're no longer a slave to fear and that's what we can claim whenever the devil throws something at us we've got a promise we've got a God that's far greater than the fear amen
