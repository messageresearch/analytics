we're asking you to take control of this service lord we've done what we can lord but it pales in comparison to what you can do if you'll just take a hold of one of us lord but we're not just asking

encourage us lord correct us where we're off the path lord draw us closer lord into a relationship with you lord lord pull us away from the world we pray lord just speak to your lord your your waiting

them this evening lord god just be with them lord we thank you for your grace and touch lord praying that you continue with them this week lord just have your way now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen and amen thank you musicians that'll be it amen god bless you certainly good to be here again this evening if you turn in your scriptures to joshua chapter one again we'll be continuing with the the overcomers and so we'll be in joshua and ephesians for the next little while by god's grace amen i remember somebody else said the other day you know this is my intentions he said but i don't ever want to want to you know limit the holy spirit if he wants to move us off for a service or two or three then that's that's we'll see how that goes you know you don't you don't ever want to say this is what it's going to be but it's this is what it's going to be if the lord wills amen amen joshua chapter 1 and verse 1 says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the lamb which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to the law or according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prosper what wither so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have i not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest amen you can have your seats god bless the reading of his word thank you brother matt i'm not used to clicking my own slides now i just preach and matt keeps up with me but he's he's handed control back to me here so if i miss it for the mat you see what's there and chances probably needed amen amen what a wonderful scripture to start with amen i will not leave thee nor forsake thee amen i'm with you wherever you go amen we're going to continue on our series of the overcomers tonight and for a a for a title i want to go with elected for position predestined for possession amen elected for position predestined for possession i checked and i know i'd spoken on the choosing of god and predestination back in september of last year so i'm not going to dwell on what i've already covered fairly in depth in the last year or so so if you want to to go back and and take a look at it it would certainly be a good uh kind of primer for what we're going into tonight but i'm not going to cover that i want to go into more the effect of predestination the the effect of election and what that does to the believer amen so let's start in joshua one verse three again we're gonna start rolling through we we ended on verse four but i'm going to read the just a little bit to bring us up to speed and then we'll we'll start moving forward amen every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses amen footsteps his possession as brother branham said if you can walk on it it's yours and then if you can win the victory over it then it's yours and it can never be taken away from you again i found that people that get a victory they rarely lose the victory amen especially if the holy ghost victory if it's one thing to do it of your own strength but i'll tell you once you've beaten the devil once he doesn't have much of a chance to beat you at that same thing again and again because once you've beaten him amen by the holy spirit by your faith in the word of god then you know that he's a defeated enemy he's a bluff and he's just trying to throw something back at you every time but he can't stay amen amen from the wilderness in this lebanon even under the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast it meant a great inheritance we talked about last time he gives us he gives us this beautiful picture of what's waiting for them but he doesn't really talk about the giants too much does he you know he gets down a little later he says nobody is going to be able to stand before you but god doesn't go into great depth to describe with us how tough it's going to be and how big the challenges are going to be and how tall and thick the walls are and how mean that devil's going to look and how much experience he has and what great weapons he has he doesn't go into that he just says it doesn't matter whatever comes against you is going to have to fall to your before your feed amen so he's just telling you whatever is within what i tell you it belongs to you don't doesn't matter who's there it belongs to you and you just have to go ahead and take it amen amen there shall not be any man be able to stan to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor for safety and we spoke last time how joshua's a type of the holy spirit but we don't want to just get on this stuck on that type but we want to recognize that he's a human he's a man just like i am and so the encouragement that he needs and the instruction god gives for him is no different than what is available for us amen we don't want to take joshua and put him up on some big high pedestal he's just like you and i are and so god has to work with him and deal with him the way he does with us so when we see god giving him encouragement when we see god giving him instruction then we can take that to ourselves and say that's for me amen it's not just the holy ghost that's ju that is for me amen so he says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of the life thy life now we can look at this two ways okay the glasshaft empty guy says i'm going to be fighting the rest of my life because that's what he says he says there's battles coming and so the the guy that says the glass is half empty he's saying i'm going to be fighting all my life and maybe he says i don't want to have anything to do with this you're telling me i'm going to be fighting all my life and i don't want to do that i'd rather have a life of ease i'd rather stay on this side of jordan i'd rather stay where the land's already been won i don't want to go over and possess this amen but then we have the believer that looks at that and says i'm going to be victorious all of my life no matter what comes against me yes i'm going to be fighting all my life yes i'm going to have this sticky flesh yes i'm going to have this carnal nature that's that's stuck on me by genetics and by the fall of sin but no matter what i'm going to be victorious all my life because you said no one's going to be able to stand before me amen so we want to find ourselves on the side that says not i'm going to be battling but i'm going to be winning all the days of my life amen because he's told me that he will be with us amen you are more than a conqueror the scripture says look at it this way satan had almost 500 years on about 475 give or take to prepare for the children of israel he knew the promise the promise had been written the promise had been spoken the promise had been handed down from generation to generation of israel satan is not caught unawares when it comes to the invasion of canaan he knows they're coming back he knows where abraham's walked he knows that god has told him everywhere you walk is your possession now he knows that he's telling joshua this as well satan has prepared for 475 years to try and hold back the invasion of the israelites into canaan and guess what it doesn't do him any good because god takes on the biggest city the hardest city the one with the tallest thickest walls and he knocks it down supernaturally in their very first battle scene right everything that satan did for 500 years amounted to a hill of beans it didn't it didn't matter a lick when the israelites crossed over jordan because god was going before them and knocking down every barrier amen so for us we look at it it's been two thousand years since the promise was given to us right paul comes along whatever 30 40 50 years after jesus and he starts giving us all these things and it's 2 000 years later and satan's had 2 thousand years to develop his tactics amen to focus on the bride of christ to focus on the elected seed and yet we read the back of the book and it still says we win amen nothing's going to stop us nothing he sets against us is going to hold us back amen doesn't matter how corrupt he makes people's minds how much he gets entrenched in the government how much he gets entrenched in the education system how much he's twisted and spun the world around in his hands it's not going to stop the believer from taking her place in her position in christ amen amen the scripture says if you speak to this mountain and don't doubt it in your heart it has to move amen and so satan doesn't matter how big the mountain is it's got to move amen if you believe in your heart amen our pastors preaching on faith put it together with this and we've got a pretty powerful idea amen faith to speak it and believe it and then we watch it move amen he says as i was with moses so i will so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee now let's talk as if that was me there or you there okay as i was with moses so i will be with maureen coffey as i was with moses so i will be with selena corlett as i was with moses so i will be with brenda coffey or josh columbo or kim coffee right as i was with brother branham so i will be with thee is the way we want to read that amen as god was with the great one before you as god was with christ himself so i will be with you i will not leave fail thee nor forsake thee so there's nothing about me and that that takes place except that i receive it amen it is not the arm of flesh that i'm leaning on it's not by my strength or my discipline or my skills or my gifts but rather just that i am the receiver of this i am the inheritor of this and it is him that is doing the work in my life amen there is nothing here that i have to do except accept it believe it and act on it amen our portion of this promise is to hear it to receive it to accept it to believe it to trust and to know that god is with us and he will never fail us he will never leave us he will never forsake us and then we rest on that amen the position of the believer is rest we've said that many times before verse six he says be strong and of a good courage for under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give to them now there is a work for us in this scripture and then he says be strong and of a good courage so that's what we're required to do is be strong and of a good courage press forward take what he said and move forward amen don't be cowed by satan don't be looking at what satan's offering but be looking to what god has told us and be strong and of a good courage amen put your strength in what he said not in what you have or what you've done yourself amen courage doesn't mean be unafraid it doesn't mean that there's no fear courage means you press past the fear because there's something in you that desires what is on the other side of that then what is faith than what you're dealing with right now amen you'd rather have the victory and face the trial that you're facing whether it's something that just you know breaks you down whether it's a trial of your health a trial of your relationship a trial of your marriage trial of your job whatever it might be what you want on the other side is is worth more to you than the fear or the hurt or the possible pain or humiliation of where you're standing right now courage is when you recognize there's something better and you're willing to go for that no matter how much it costs you amen so we do what we press for we are strong and we have a good courage not because of how we feel right but because we know what's on the other side is better than how we're going to feel going through this amen i'm moving forward no matter what that's what this means courage i'm moving forward no matter what verse 7 says he told joshua before sorry not verse 7. this is a quote brother brown says he told joshua before he crossed over he said be thou very courageous for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest you say well if god told me like he did joshua i would have some courage too read the next line he says he has told every believer the same thing i'll be with you always even to the end of the world i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee courageous let's go take the promise then god gave us the promise he says let's be a real witness what's a real witness is when you have it a witness is not supposed to be given of somebody else's testimony of witnesses of your testimony it has to be firsthand amen we want to be found where the word is a testimony in us where we're not testifying to brother bob's healing but we're testifying of jonathan's healing amen we're not testifying of joshua's deliverance we're testifying of jonathan's deliverance or salinas deliverance or paul's deliverance whoever it may be the witness says he's saying let's be a real witness and have it in us not just look to joshua and say one day many many years ago god did this but today god did this yesterday god this for did this for me or did that for me and there's other things and guess what i'm looking for him to do this and that and the other thing in my life amen the true witness is when it's in you not when it's in somebody he says now when you say you've got faith by for divine healing and something strikes you and says move out that's the confirmation that god has received your faith for divine healing he says that's right when you've got courage to put your faith in action but when you say you got faith and are afraid to let it go your faith is dead see but when you got faith and willing to let it go go what go and do what god said to do then god's confirming it with the signs following and you'll see your healing that's true when you've got faith so how do you know when you've got courage when you put your faith into action amen when you take the word of god and you don't just put it in your mind but you put it on your lips and you say lord i'm confessing it i'm believing it and then as we said last service he's the high priest of our confession and he goes and he intercedes to bring the word forth into your life amen now joshua is told three times in this in this series of scriptures here to have strength and to have courage now when god says something three times that means it's a big deal because he doesn't do it very often in scripture where he just goes bang bang bang he says three things one over the other over again and over again amen so i want us to to see here that there's a requirement here for courage and strength you're going to have to be strong you're going to have to be strong in the lord you're going to have to be strong and looking to the promise not to the symptoms have to be strong and looking to the word rather than to what is going on amen you've got to be able to see beyond that and look to the mountain moving rather than the size of the mountain in front of you amen he says now he says be strong and courageous for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them amen so the first purpose for strength and courage is to place the people positionally is to put them to where sorry matt don't uh don't move forward there i've got that yeah um the first reason for it was so that he could place the people positionally now you say that doesn't sound very difficult but one to place them positionally he has to take the land first so he's got to be strong and courageous to take the land and then he has to be able to stand there and say this is your possession and this is where you're going you know this is where this tribe's going and this is where this tribe's going and i can guarantee you there are some people that maybe thought that isn't where i want to be right i look over there and i see that they have the beautiful mountains and i'm stuck on the sea not many people might say that but there are people that like the mountains over the ocean you know or maybe they're stuck in the plains of saskatchewan rather than the beautiful coasts of newfoundland right and they say no i want to be in newfoundland wherever it might be i guarantee you that people come up and say joshua buddy buddy old pal we're good right i really don't like where i'm at and joshua has to say listen god already told moses this is where you're supposed to go so you're going there and you can talk to me and you can cry and you can go and talk to people and try and politicize it to get yourself into a place that you want to be but guess what god has told you this is where you're going to be and if you don't go there you're not going to be blessed you're not going to be blessed if you don't go where god puts you because god will only bless you in the place that he has called you to be and if you go and you try start trying to be somebody else or do something else that god hasn't called you to you're gonna get yourself in a world of hurt why because you're making yourselves into a denomination you're going by men's leadership rather than gods amen then he says it again only be thou strong and very courageous not just strong and courageous but very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest amen so the second reason for that he has to be strong now and very courageous not just courageous but very courageous is that he has to stay with the word amen this one's even tougher than the first one because he's got to do it all according to the way god said because often times we'll go and we'll try and do something for the lord and we'll try and do it our way instead of god's way we'll try and do it on our timeline instead of god's timeline we'll try and do with our strength instead of god's strength and we get into problems and we see that joshua does this in the second battle because when he sends off to take ai he says i'm just going to send a small army no god doesn't tell joshua to send a small army joshua says we're going to send out a small army and they get defeated we know there was a problem in the camp amen with with aitkin and whatnot but the problem is joshua had to follow leadership on how this was going to go all the way through from start to finish and if he got outside of the leadership of the of the lord then he was going to have problems and like i said the only way he's going to get into trouble if he gets out of that and then we'll dig into it a little more when we get into ai a little a little later amen but when he's going into the trials and battles joshua has to have confidence that he's in the will of god amen it's the same thing for us when we're heading into things when things are falling down around you when the struggle hits when the trial hits you've got to be able to say i'm in the will of god and if you're not in the will of god bring yourself back to the will of god so that he can move on your behalf but when you're walking around in your own understanding in your own ways and your own ideas and your own preferences god can't move because you're out of his will so he's got to bring you back and sometimes his trial is to bring you into his will and then it goes away but other times it's to bring you into his will and then he allows you to overcome it because you've suddenly heated him and you brought yourself back into submission to the holy spirit amen now he says do all according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee we read earlier moses my servant is dead but that doesn't mean moses sir moses message is no longer valid moses my servant is dead does not mean the message of moses is now nolan void and has no effect any more than it does brother branham my servant is dead and brother branham's message is now nolan void amen what is the joshua commission it is to fulfill the word of moses the promise through moses amen and so it is for the bribe brother branham's gone but his message isn't null and void but rather now the ministry of the bride is to do what to fulfill the message that he has brought to obey it brother branham says if i can just get you to stand still and put it on you it'll prepare you for a rapture amen so our purpose is to fulfill what the message brought to us amen and it's no different for joshua is his purpose is to fulfill moses message it's to stand firm on the word and in doing so that will bring the fulfillment amen he says turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prosper wherever so ever though ghost you can't deviate you're not allowed to take a runner to the left or to the right on a whim he says you can't deviate you've got to stay with the word brother braham says this he says joshua node this commission was tremendous did you notice there when joshua started to cross jordan how joshua remembered his commission let not this book of the law my word depart out of your mouth in other words joshua i don't care what the tribe says what all the clergy says stay with this word for then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous no matter how many big things they do how many little things they do how many organizations they made stay with the word joshua oh my stay with the word this word this word shall not depart out of your mouth he says if the word says do a certain thing do it i don't care what the organization says do it anyhow that's the joshua that god is waiting for turn not one inch one iota stay right with the word the only way to prosper is to stay with the word of god the only way to overcome is to stay with the word of god and the only way to inherit is to stay with the word of god he says now remember this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth so he had god's word as i was with moses move right on out and as i was with moses so will i be with you i'll not fail you now listen to this you may fail me but i won't fail you but if you fail me my grace is sufficient i'll bear you right back up just keep moving on as long as you stay with the word i'll take care of you and again we see that in ai joshua failed right he failed that was the leadership and brother brahm talks about i won't go into it for the sake of time joshua messed up he messed up and it comes on the leadership it falls on the leadership to take the blame for that that wasn't aiken's fault that was joshua's fault because he didn't go and he didn't make sure everything was right amen but he says joshua if you fail i'll still bear you right back up and after that we see there are no more failures in joshua's life he learns his lesson and he goes forward and he defeats everyone including causing the sun and the moon to stand still so he can get a bit more time to finish the job one day amen god backs him up though you fail me yet i will give you grace and bear you back up amen so let me tell you this when a professing believer can look you in the eye and say i'm going to do something and it's against the word you ought to be able to say brother sister you can do it but god won't bless you and he won't support you in it and you can get a nice house you can get a nice car you can get a nice job you can get a nice place of living you can get comfort and ease of life but god will not be in it and until you come back to him it's not going to change amen you can't go off the word and be blessed in heavenly places you cannot do it amen and we've got to be able to stand firm on that because i'm finding it's more and more today that people are getting more and more bold in the fact that they do not stand 100 with the word of god right it's little things remember what he said in that quote before he says turn out one inch one iota and the thing is you get off a little bit here it doesn't make much of a difference coming over this but by the time i'm at the back door i'm six inches off of center amen and the thing is when i go seven years or ten years down the road i'm a mile off and i'm not even close to god and i don't know where i went off because it was so simple so so just a slight variation at the very beginning you've got to stay strict with the word of god he tells joshua stay strict and trust his grace when you get off that he's going to bring you back him and you'll be quick to come back and say whoa whoa we've got a problem because things aren't happening the way the word says it's supposed to happen in my life and the only way that goes on is if they're sin in the camp amen listen as josh as god continues ammunition is admonition to joshua here now in verse 8. he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe according to observe to do according to all that is written therein for then for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success amen there's a lot here let's break it down it says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth god starts with a speaking bride it's interesting to say here it says it shall not depart out of thy mouth he doesn't say it doesn't shall not depart out of thy mind shall not depart out of thy thoughts shall not depart out of our writings he says it shall not depart out of thy mouth you've got to speak what the word says and it's not enough to think it and agree with it in your head you have to speak it amen i've said many times over this pulpit that a confession requires you to speak a confession is not a there's no such thing as a thought confession there is a voice confession you have to speak it you have to put yourself on the record that this is what i'm saying and this is what i'm believing this is what i'm thinking but i'm going to speak it out loud amen and as we said last time he is the high priest of your confession not the high priest of your thoughts he's a high priest of your confession so you've got to speak he's saying to joshua you got to be a speaking leader you've got a one that says the word of god not just thinks the word of god brother brahm says this this is a prayer he says lord jesus in the way of humility and the way of humbleness i offer you this congregation that's on their feet i offer them to you because they have stood in response to the call they're seeking deeper things listen now they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action amen the word spoken becomes god in action he says they speak what it is god speaking why because them is the holy ghost and them is the holy ghost and he is a creator what you speak is creative amen he says when you speak the word it puts god into action amen so to take this land you've got to be a speaking bride not a thinking bride but a speaking bride a confessing bride of the promise of the word of god amen he says thy word is the truth and every man that'll read the bible and believe every word that bible says and follow its instructions and receive the same holy ghost that they received the same way they received it the same results they received it the same power they got when they received it he knows who his papa and mama was he knows he's washed in the blood of jesus christ born of the spirit filled with god's unction he knows where he's standing sure he's in canaan he knows where he come from that's the way it is with a real christian ask him have you received the holy ghost since you believed amen brother have you received the holy ghost since you believed amen sister right you've got to know that you have what is required to be in that land amen he continues he says but thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen we started with the speaking part but how do you get to the speaking part you've got to meditate on it day and night you've got to dwell on this you've got to put yourself into it amen you've got to put it in front of you you've got to soak into it amen you've got to let it have an effect and the effect is always that you will speak the word of god amen that where meditate means to dwell on and to speak it is not to just sit there and listen and think about it but it must end up with a speaking amen it can't just stay in your mind meditation these days so often is you know this thing and it's all in your head the scripture there i looked up the greek word and it is not just to think on but it is to think on to dwell on and then to speak amen so that your words are spoken fitly as the scripture says so that you're speaking according to what has soaked into you by the holy spirit through the word of god amen psalms 119 says wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way young men listen up young sisters listen up how are you going to clean your life up it says by taking heed there too according to thy word with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against see remember brother brahm said sin is what unbelief and then unbelief leads to an action that is against the word amen blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches in other words i have rejoiced as much in what god has done for me as i have for the good things that i have in life now some of us maybe don't have as much as others and that's an easier thing to do but he says i have rejoiced more in what god has given me then i've rejoiced for anything else that this world could offer me i will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways i will delight myself and thy statutes i will not forget thy word deal bountifully with thy servant that i may live and keep thy word open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law who wants the promised land show of hands how many of us do that show hands no this is what he's saying can we put ourselves there that's what he told joshua this is his instruction to joshua i know this is a psalm but this is the idea what drill it into yourself amen soak into it let it just be something that surrounds you that envelops you and then something so that when you speak what comes out is his precepts amen his principles his word his law his direction his unction amen you know what we get a lot of times enthusiasm we get enthusiasm in the word of god and we get ra rod and we get pumped up but you know what enthusiasm doesn't do well with struggle enthusiasm doesn't hold up to struggle because enthusiasm is a temporary high but it doesn't give you any strength it's good for a moment it's great it's great to shout and dance and yell and clap and all these things and praise the lord that has to be in the life of believer amen it says there in verse 14 i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies we ought to have a testimony but enthusiasm doesn't take you through it into a testimony amen you've got to have strength and you've got to have courage amen amen that's the danger there is that you're going to get pumped up rather than encouraged and strengthened in the lord amen amen but he tells joshua meditate on it and you don't get to pick and choose joshua that's where denominations fail that's where prosperity gospel fails is they pick the good stuff they pick the best parts the choice meets amen the most delicious food out of the scripture and they say that's mine and they go and they act on it in faith and guess what they get it a lot of the time but that's not the full thing and the thing is if you don't obey it fully then you don't get the full inheritance amen if you only do a partial submission to the word of god if you're only speaking a portion of the word of god then that's all you're going to get but you've got to take all of the words so that you can get all of the inheritance that's offered to you amen amen incomplete surrender to the word of god leads to an incomplete inheritance every single time he says for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good consent good success so if you do all those things if you meditate day and night in it he says then your way will be prosperous and then you'll have success not just success but he says good success what's the difference you can start a business and you can do a million dollars a year in revenue that's success you can start a business and you can do a billion dollars that's good success that's what they call a unicorn today is a billion dollar valuation for a business in god's eyes you know what good success is lasting success it's not a one-time deal it's not a here today and gone tomorrow but it's something that stays with you it's something that you have all the time it's peace it's rest it's joy it's love it's all of the fruit of the holy spirit day in and day out you've got it that's good success amen it's something that god gives and when god gives he doesn't take it away amen matthew 18 or matthew 6 33 says seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you meditate day and night in it and then what you've asked for is going to be added to you the things that you have need of even the desires of your heart scripture says he'll give them to you amen what do you want success or good success i'll take good success every time seek ye first the kingdom of god scripture says back to joshua 1 9 have i not commanded thee okay the first two times was a we're having a conversation now he says have i not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goes the third purpose for being strong enough of a courage good courage is by remembering and for to remember that god is with you everywhere that you go amen be strong enough of a good courage because god is with you amen it says be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord that god is with thee wither so ever thou goes it says don't be afraid and don't be dismayed you know what it means to be dispaid shattered this may mean shatter in that verse to be discouraged and to be broken amen and satan would like nothing better than to shatter us amen and how many times have we been through things and the worst thing is when it happens in a church situation isn't it or a family situation somebody you love and trust a pastor a minister maybe somebody that you that you really held in high regard and then what happens is there's a crack comes there's a break comes you see maybe the hinder parts are the the lesser things that are quite so good about them and what is it it shatters something within you because you had such a a high regard for that person amen or that that relationship or that situation whatever it might be discouragement is satan's probably one of his greatest weapons amen is that he gets you discouraged he gets you looking at the situation he gets you looking at your failures gets you looking at your problems and you start to say i can't do this but you never could do it in the first place amen you've got to look to the word that's why you've got to meditate on the water so that you don't look at yourself and you look to the promises of god amen we're believers and we believe in the impossible and whether god holds off for delays that doesn't hold us back amen we keep believing we keep having faith that he's going to do the work that he promised this is a tremendous quote a little more direct than i'm used to brother branham he says am i brother don't you be afraid to ask god for anything okay that's not so bad you must demand god or ask god for anything that he has promised demand brother branham you've got to demand god he says for if i am introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful and if i be a servant of god i must do the works of god now that's no different for him than it is for any one of us you don't have to be a minister to say this amen these signs shall follow them that believe right and if i do the work of god i must demand of god to bring these things to pass because he is demanding of me to produce the impossible i have to ask him i have to call upon him and stand there and say god you promised it so do you every person demanding is not an attitude of demanding in that lord you better do this it's lord you said it now i'm believing lord you said it i'm believing lord you said it i'm believing lord you said it i'm waiting on you lord i'm trusting on you lord i'm believing in you lord you said it and i'm just repeating it back to you amen brother braham says god loves to hear his word repeat it back to him and that's how you demand something of god if we can put it that way is that you repeat his word back to him and say lord you said this is mine and i'm claiming it today the end of that verse says for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever though go us amen we said before and this is a similar scripture where's joshua in this it's all about god god's with you joshua don't be afraid don't be dismayed don't be shattered don't be broken don't be discouraged because the lord is with you are you going to have great success joshua because you're a great general because you have great armies with great weapons no you're going to have it because the lord is with you you're the beneficiary joshua and this is god's working and all you have to do is stay with his word and he will do everything that he promised to do in this land amen amen let's turn to ephesians 1 if we will this morning this evening ephesians 1 verse 1 again paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ amen as we said last time this is a work of grace through and through blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now i want to stop here and just cover something that we touched on last time but i want to drop into it just a little bit more where we talked about all spiritual blessings amen because we want to remember that the spirit all spiritual blessings is not just the feel-goods amen or the effect of all spiritual blessings is not just the feel goods if i can put it that way if you remember this quote he said just heavenly places in christ jesus blessing us with what all of these good things divine healing for knowledge revelation visions powers tongues interpretations wisdom knowledge all the heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together setting together in heavenly places and the church said amen not one evil thought among us this is where the rubber meets the road amen we take on the mind of christ not one cigarette smoked not one bad habit full deliverance amen full deliverance is what he's talking about here that's a a wonderful thing until you realize that you need deliverance not one short dress amen obedience to the word is cleansing our beast nature so that we don't go looking for approval in those ways amen a sound mind replaces a tempting spirit inside of us or this not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another full unity and fellowship is what he's talking here putting aside our offense our offenses and our little preferences for what the sake of a greater unification as a member of the body of christ amen everybody speaking in love and harmony not just shouting and praising but speaking good things to each other always in love and with the intent to grow the other person amen everybody with one accord in one place remember all on the boat to china's brother mark says one purpose one goal and that is our only focus and everything of jonathan corlett i'll set aside to help us get to china a little easier amen that's what i'm looking for in my life set aside my preferences so that we get to china a little easier and then there's a little less friction on the boat there's a little more unity a little more helping and it's a little more pleasant journey amen it's going to be tough enough without us fighting amongst ourselves amen so what we want all the things that the first half of that talks about but are we willing to go through the cleansing that brings the second half amen but we submit ourselves in the way that says i'm going to put myself below and i'm going to serve my fellow brother and sister in christ so that we can get there just a little bit quicker just a little bit easier amen amen you can't do awands for the word of god there's no way it's going to happen they'll tear you apart amen so we're electing the best of a bad bunch amen so our election is according to the best that we think is there amen but god's election is according to the best that he thinks and if he's thought about you that makes you the best because god doesn't think of imperfection god thinks of perfection he requires perfection so when he elected you he elected you to a perfect walk in christ he elected you to walk under the shed blood of christ so that you could stand before him so that he could be reflected in you and so that the the things that we go through and the the ways we fail and our faults and whatnot are hidden from him and he can look at us and he can see himself exactly as he intended us to be from the very beginning amen amen this kind of election has no basis on what you look like what you're doing today what you're going to do tomorrow amen your righteousness or clean living these have nothing to do with your election amen he elected you before the foundation of the world in him and that is where your perfection lies amen it's his election that holds us it's his election that gives us the victory amen because he purposed in himself that we would be victorious that we would be spotless before him amen that we would be a perfect white white spotless not white you know racially bride gotta be careful you really have to be careful amen your mistakes and failures will never frustrate the plan of god is what i'm getting to because sometimes that's what we're looking as we're looking we're saying how is he going to rapture this amen and the thing is he's not looking at this that you're looking at he's looking at a perfect bride through the film through the lens of the shed blood of christ amen you can't start it and you can't stop it amen it's a finished work and we're just down in this body of time for him to bring it out into each and every one of us amen let me say it this way you can't make god love you more today than he did back then and you can't make him love you less today than he did back then amen god's love is not conditional amen it's unconditional and his love is elective and what he's saying is i love you no matter what that's what elective love is is i love you no matter what can you imagine if we had elective love for everyone in our family everyone in this church elective love meaning i love you because you are part of the body not because you're perfect amen that's the kind of love we spoke about in that service remember god's love god's love looks to the word and the person rather than everything that's surrounding the word in them amen amen verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen i want to just talk a little bit about election predestination here brother brown said election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny now where am i at now i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of god what is where does predestination look to destiny where he will take me to and where am i going amen that's got you there you are so it kind of looks like this so you're standing here because the election is is a present view of a past event and predestination is a present view of a future event if we could put it that way so you're standing here today and you can only stand there and say i was elected if you have the holy spirit because you have to be elected to the life of god amen and that only comes through the holy spirit so you're standing here and you say okay i've received the holy spirit that means i was a part of election and that looks back to god here by foreknowledge you were in the thoughts of god and he says jonathan collette is a son of god and so today i say i was elected but it points back to something god did back here right so he or she is a child of god when i look at it today i say i am a child of god amen the word is there here's the recognition and reality of that word but now i say if i'm elected if i am a son of god that means there's something coming for me as well right this points back to what was what brought me to this place but now predestination looks forward brother brahm says and says there's something coming for you and there's a destiny there and it says what today predestination says you are the bride of christ amen and when we go on the rapture it says i am the bride of christ we say it today but the proof is in the rapture amen and that's that moment where he's pointing to and he's saying the word now becomes recognition reality you stand today you look back and you thank god for it but you look forward and say there's still more for me to do there's still more that god has for my life amen does that make sense all right so then he starts talking about adoption i know we know we're well taught we should all know this but i'm going to just read the quotes quickly and we'll breeze through it amen we know what adoption is today it's when you take a child to yourself that isn't yours it didn't come from your body your you and your wife didn't have it you adopt a child that came from somebody else but adoption back in in old days was quite a bit different brother brahm says i believe that we're all baptized with the holy spirit and brought into the body and then we become sons and then after sons there's a placing of sons or the adoption of sons a son was born in israel and then after eight days he was circumcised and became an israelite and he was born to the father and then if that child was given a tutor galatians teaches us that after he was raised up to a certain age and he become very faithful to the father's work and everything he was a very fine boy and was eligible to fall air so just because you were born into the family didn't mean that you were going to inherit everything that that family had he says now the father didn't know what he would be when he was born he might be a gangster he might be slothful in the father's business he couldn't turn his kingdom and his things his work over to that boy but when the boy proved to be a right boy and the tutor which in our case is the holy spirit takes word to the father and gives a report of what we do then if we be found faithful for so long like the child was then he was taken out into the public square and a purple robe was put on him and there was a law of adoption and then that boy was adopted by the same father who gave him birth and he was brought into the family and then he wasn't only a son he was heir co-heir with the father of every possession that he had amen so adoption was the placing the child on a footing of authority within the family including the ability to inherit when the father died amen and brother braham says now your coheir with christ amen the scripture says that that we are coheirs with christ if what we've received the same spirit that was in him we've received the benefits of his his sacrifice at calvary and then he says the holy spirit's there and he's working with you and it goes to the father and says yes he acts like you he talks like you and then you're sealed and then it's a finished work and your soul is sealed all the way to the end amen we saw it with jesus you say that was the fullness of the godhead bodily yep but he still went through the process remember when he comes to john and he's about to be baptized and the spirit said to john whichever one you see the spirit descending on that is the messiah so the holy spirit comes down and says this is my beloved son but then we see a little while later when jesus goes up on the mountain after he's been tested and proven and whatnot then the great light comes down remember and it says this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him so he gives the idea that he a he's done what the father's asked he's pleased with him the report has been good and then he follows it up and he says hear ye him and from then on it's only jesus speaking we never hear that voice come out of heaven again why because all power has been given into his hands amen right now he's got to go through the cross in these different things he doesn't receive his kingdom until later but that was jesus adoption moment brother brahm says we're after that point now he speaks and whatever he speaks will happen he's got the full authority of heaven backing him up now before that he had to do whatever the father showed him in that sense but here he had the authority to step out if he needed to and do whatever he had to amen romans 8 how do you get adopted brother brown says this over and over again how do you get adopted how do you get brought into the family the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god okay and then he says and if children so you have to have the spirit the holy spirit bearing witness within you to be recognized as a child of god and then if we're children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we also may be glorified together now remember he told joshua be thou strong and courageous no man is going to be able to stand right there was the promise battles are coming he says here battles are coming you've got to suffer you've got to go through the battles amen why so that we can be glorified together suffering is a part of that adoption process amen struggles trials challenges are the proving portion that we are what he said we would be amen jumping back to ephesians 1 and 6 says to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved amen it's all when it's all the grace of god how can we claim any part of this to be ourselves amen how can we lift ourselves up and say i'm this or i'm that or i've got this or i've done that and then it's all god from start to finish in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace what is redemption it's the restoring back that which was lost or forfeited so what are we being redeemed back to our position as children of god brother brahm says amateur gods many messiahs even he said at different times amen our position as the children of god with fellowship eternal life and dominion on the earth amen how nothing i did says thereby what through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace verse 8 says wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence that abounded doesn't mean it's just dribbling out a little bit from the faucet amen that's the fire hose has been turned on and he is firing this at us amen if we lack something it's not because god's unwilling to give it or that god doesn't have it it's that we're not willing to take it amen because it says he's bounded towards it towards us with it there's lots of it there's abundance of it in what all wisdom and prudence amen if you need direction it's there you need wisdom you need discretion you need discernment this is what this is all talking about here it's all available to the children of god amen and these are the riches of his grace amen amen verse 9 says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen so the mystery of his will is something that he decided not we decided because it's his will not our will right what was the mystery of god to joshua it was the fulfilling of the promise but it included two things right the boundaries of the promised land that was one mystery and the second was who went where the positional placing of the israelites within that land amen so what's the mystery of his will today you'd think it'd be the same thing right it is in a sense that it's to be the fulfilling of the promise romans 8 we started reading this but i'm going to go back a little bit it says for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god there's our identification you want to know if you're a son or daughter of god how are you led do you have the spirit and do you obey the spirit for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear there's another identification are you fearful but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father amen as we read earlier be strong and courageous don't be afraid and don't be dismayed the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god what's it doing it's confirming that we act we speak and we think like christ did and if we are children this is what we just read then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together but i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god remember we're talking what is the mystery of god for today but brahm said this he says is that right waiting god's trying to place his church in position what for to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there's my spirit flowing three freely there it is that i can work here get another one over here and place him i can place him adoption placing manifesting take him out here put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth if he's just making up something it won't work no no that won't work we've had a lot of that but i mean manifestation of sons of god when god manifests himself and he sends him out manifestation does not lead to sitting around doing nothing preacher said recently joshua would only get into trouble if he was idle because the command was not idleness it was go and possess the land amen so when god manifests himself it's going to lead to action it's going to lead to a life lived it's going to lead to deliverance it's going to lead to healing it's going to lead to the the moving and the working of god in a person amen and then he goes and what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word remember we were talking about leadership last time and god uses the leadership of men through the holy spirit amen how do you know that they're leading you properly how do you know if it's the holy spirit they stay right with the word see that's how you know all man is by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no life in them says the bible see leave them away so brother i'm saying the mystery of the will of god today is the full manifestation of the sons of god revelation 10 7 very familiar scripture this is our scripture but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet the prophets amen why do we believe this message why do we believe this one why not oral roberts why not billy graham why not a slew of others that are out there we had signs and wonders and it was vindicated by signs and wonders and we looked at that as a vindication of it amen but what was it it was it's the only message out there it's the only it's the only thought it's the only idea that is pulling us to the finished work of god you won't find it anywhere else where somebody is pointing to a finished work of god in children of god on the earth right now and saying now is the time and here's the proof of it because that's what the message was was it was proof of a living god in a way that has never been shown since christ was here 2000 years ago is that we saw christ on display and the whole world marveled the whole world marveled and they couldn't believe what was happening in this man called william branham and what was it it was christ himself revealing through a son of man ministry that he is alive and well and he's coming back and he's come back for a purpose and that's to take a bride off of this earth nobody else is out there preaching it like that nobody not only preaching it but showing the proof of it that's what we saw was we saw the preaching of it and we saw the proof of it displayed time and time again in front of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people saw christ displayed through a man and what was it it was a man that was saying you're called to this exact same position not as a prophet not as a minister but you are called to the adoption of a son of god and this is what an adopted son of god looks like when he's finished amen that's what we are called to amen it's to tell us that we are called to the exact same position and placing that he was in amen this is talking about what a lived experience where you and christ are one that's why we believe this message it's not all the signs and wonders there's signs and wonders everywhere and you can find him because god is he's what he respects faith brother branham said right you're going to find signs and wonders everywhere but where will you see somebody that's pointing to the scripture and saying this is you this is you this is you this is you and then he makes it live right in front of you amen what is it it was the finishing work this message is the finishing work of god for the gentile dispensation amen that's why we preach out of a bible not out of a message book is because it's a restoring work it's not a new work right that's why brother brahm says you've got to have the same experience they had on the day of pentecost he didn't tell us we had some new experience some new ideas he said i preached what paul preached he pulled us back to the word he straightened out he untied all the knots that they had tied in it right tied up the loose ends that needed to be tied up and he brought us back to a restored word the fullness of the word because that's the only way we can get out of here is if we will accept the fullness of the word again amen let's talk about this amen he says what he said he was doing it according to his good pleasure amen in ephesians philippians 2 says wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure what he's saying there is it is god has put a desire in you to do his will and then he's put in you the ability to do his will right lots of people have a they look at it and say yeah okay that looks good but they don't have the life to do it amen people can look at it because you know if you've got even a semi spiritual mind you look at the word and you see the good things that are in there and you say yeah i'll do that for that but you've got to have a life to do it because remember what brother brahm said you've got a demand of god because he is requiring supernatural things out of you right not natural things supernatural things amen do all things without murmurings and disputings no grumbling when god asks you to do something ouch no grumblings no grumblings no grumblings anybody done any grumbling lately i saw a few honest hands go up a couple eyes that wouldn't meet mine it's tough isn't it yeah humbling of a vessel is not something we generally enjoy amen but he's going to build you back up into something that'll stand forever amen verse 15 says what do all of it without grumblings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world so as good pleasure as what that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world if we can see the crooked and perverse nation we ought to be able to see the lights in the world as well amen 2 thessalonians 1 says when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired and all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasures of his goodness and the work of faith with power that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god in the lord jesus christ you can't take on the name of somebody unless you're married to them and this is the bride of christ he says what do it with the work of faith with power the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power power him and that's the manifestation of the sons of god that's the full revealing of christ in his bride that's the victorious church amen even if we jump back to ephesians 1 verse 9 it says this so remember we're talking about what is the mystery of his will it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself what's the effect of the revealing of his of his of the mystery of his will that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so as he makes known unto us the mystery of his will what's the effect the gathering of the children of god to christ by a resurrection and a rapture so the mystery of his will has to come before that because the effect of the mystery of his will is the resurrection and the rapture so what comes before that manifestation of the sons of god it's amazing how brother brahm jumps to this stuff i mean i would never make that connection i just read it and it's just wow right that's what a prophetic message does for you is he makes those leaps and jumps but it said leaping a jump only until you start looking in the scripture and you just see it it's laid through all the way from start to finish and you're like that that's why i can trust him but it's also why we preach out of the bible as we ought to be able to go back and say that wasn't a leap at all it was only a leap because i don't have an angel sitting there telling me these things right i've got to go study to show myself for proof and guess what i guarantee you he did too brother brown was a great study of the word he didn't just get up there and speak words you know he was a he studied into it and he dug into it and these things would only be confirmed god would confirm it amen amen the mystery of his will isn't just a basic walk with god going to church going out doing missionary work and these things because that's always been there and that's not what's going to bring us to the dispensation of the fullness of times right that's a basic requirement for walking amen but the mystery of his will in this case is what bringing us to that last time it's in the last time that the full mystery is revealed amen the amplified says that that dispensation of the fullness of times is the climax of the ages that's the last church agent that's now right he says now is when the mystery of his will is going to be shown and it's going to be what in a church and a bride in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory are first trusted in christ when you start hearing people that are being praised look out there's a fall coming amen these men and these women we have to stay humble they have to stay humble because god will break them down he's got to him and he won't let anybody take the credit for this one this is his work amen and when you see that humility coming forward that's what you're looking for in these ones amen amen but he says what we're predestinated to what an inheritance by the purpose of god that's why we don't play the lottery we already won the lottery right what what more do you need right you you won from the foundation of the world and it's a guaranteed prize that's not going to fade away amen amen we are the lottery winners and probably be a great sermon sometime lottery winners in the message amen continuing in ephesians as we start to close here it says in whom also ye in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye believed after you believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory again this is for his glory not for ours wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him we're going to need that we need that amen the spirit of wisdom and revelation in what the knowledge of him amen that's what we're looking to grow in the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling hope's great but what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints amen not just a thought not just an idea not just a maybe so but a must be right a definite something that i have not just something i'm looking for and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ in when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places it says he's given us the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we can see and receive the riches of his inheritance but not only that but the exceeding greatness of his power that's the greater than great greater than great amen the greater than greatness of his power what the same thing that raised christ from the dead is the thing that's raising us up into heavenly places and giving us the position to inherit all things amen 21 says far above all principality this is where he's placed us now this is heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet which gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all again brother braham says that is the mystery of his will that's the manifestation of the sons of god his body the fullness of him that's what we're talking about amen look at our position in christ where he says everything is under his feet all principalities all powers all might all dominions and all names past present and future it says they're under his feet but then he says you are his body so it puts him under your feet but doesn't just say under your feet you know not like this i'm not going to stand on it that's not what he's talking about he says far above amen not even worthy to look down and say something's bumping my toe down there he says fire above it you can't even feel it it can't even see you it's so far below you remember when we spoke about jesus despising the shame you can despise every power every might every principality every dominion and every name that is not named jesus christ because it is far below our feet amen amen everything's conquered everything's taken care of all he's saying is go ahead and walk through it now i was going to end here but i want to read you something cause i've been listening to adoption and i was just listening to this before i came this evening and uh it struck me because we're talking now about possession we okay to go for another 10 minutes we're talking about possession okay brother branham finishes adoption number one and then he starts he says does anybody here need prayer no prayer cards no nothing he says does anybody need prayers anybody have a need i'm going to read to you what a couple of these people said okay he's not using discernment okay this is not some special i'm a prophet i have a great gift here okay he's having people come up tell him who they are what their need is and that's it okay he's not he's not operating under a prophetic gift here now because he's making a point he says your sister she says hampton sister hampton you're a believer aren't you i am
