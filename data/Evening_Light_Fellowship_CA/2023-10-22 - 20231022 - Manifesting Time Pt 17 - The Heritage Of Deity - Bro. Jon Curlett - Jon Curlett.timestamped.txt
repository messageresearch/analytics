[42:12] this morning that we stand here Lord not
[42:15] on our own merits but by the Lord
[42:17] unending Grace Lord that you chose us
[42:19] before the foundation of the world Lord
[42:22] would you just speak once again this
[42:23] morning we pray Lord minister to us Lord
[42:26] grant traveling mercies to those that
[42:28] are traveling Lord grant healing to
[42:30] those that are sick this morning we pray
[42:32] Lord Lord touch Our Lives now we ask in
[42:34] Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen and
[42:38] amen amen God bless you welcome each one
[42:40] here this morning in the name of our
[42:41] Lord Jesus Christen good to see brother
[42:44] Gus and and his wife here sister Columbo
[42:46] amen God bless
[42:48] you amen good to
[42:51] see each one that's that's here this
[42:53] morning certainly and talked with
[42:55] brother Joe and brother Matt this
[42:56] morning so brother Joe got his moose on
[42:59] Friday morning and brother Matt got his
[43:00] moose on Saturday morning and you know
[43:03] it's the Lord's timing is perfect and
[43:06] you know usually if you know brother
[43:08] Matt he gets his moose in the first hour
[43:09] of the first day and then the rest of us
[43:11] have to walk around wondering where the
[43:12] rest of them went and he didn't get his
[43:15] until yesterday morning and so they're
[43:17] all busy you know trying to get the
[43:18] Moose ready and packaged up and taken
[43:20] over to The Butchers and whatnot so they
[43:21] couldn't leave and then last night
[43:23] brother Mark got a call from from
[43:25] Central new land and a brother there his
[43:27] son-in-law wanted to be baptized and it
[43:30] needed to be done this week because he
[43:31] was leaving on the boats for 5 weeks so
[43:34] I believe God just held the Moose back
[43:36] until brother Matt and brother Joe could
[43:38] could be in a position in a time where
[43:40] they could go so at 8: this morning they
[43:42] met up met up with him and they baptized
[43:44] him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:46] this is Brother Jared he's a 24 year-old
[43:48] young man married to brother Derek but's
[43:50] uh daughter so they just had some
[43:52] fellowship with them in carmenville
[43:54] baptize them and then they're on their
[43:55] way in this morning so we certainly just
[43:57] see that uh you know we talk about
[44:00] patience patience is understanding that
[44:02] God has a will and a time and not being
[44:06] worried when it doesn't happen the way
[44:08] that we want
[44:10] to and to see that this who knows who
[44:14] knows what could happen to that young
[44:15] man in the next 5 weeks maybe it had to
[44:17] be
[44:18] now but in a time and in a season he had
[44:21] somebody there that was able to baptize
[44:23] that young man and maybe they were
[44:24] sitting there frustrated out don't know
[44:26] you know it gets down to the wire many
[44:28] times and it not didn't get down to the
[44:30] wire for their sake it got down to the
[44:31] wire so that God could do something for
[44:33] that young man's life amen so we say
[44:36] praise the lord we see you preach on it
[44:38] and then God does something like that
[44:39] and you just say God does all things
[44:41] well amen so we're thankful for that
[44:43] brother Ellie God bless you this morning
[44:44] I didn't see you when I walked out but
[44:46] it's good to see you amen this morning
[44:48] also uh brother Bob and sister Brenda
[44:50] will be traveling this week so we want
[44:52] to remember them I'm traveling as well
[44:54] so just keep each one of us in prayer I
[44:56] know Jeremiah is sick also this morning
[44:58] so just pray God's grace to him amen
[45:01] second Peter chapter 1 very familiar
[45:03] scripture force of course says whereby
[45:06] are given unto us exceeding great and
[45:08] precious promises that by these you
[45:10] might be partakers of the divine nature
[45:13] having escaped the corruption that is in
[45:15] the world through lust and beside this
[45:17] giving all diligence add to your faith
[45:19] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[45:21] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[45:24] patience and to patience godliness amen
[45:27] God bless you you can have your seats I
[45:29] guess brother Columbo is not here I just
[45:30] saw from the back when I walked in I
[45:32] assumed it was brother Columbo but I
[45:33] guess it's just Ellie and sister Alisa
[45:35] is that right okay very good God bless
[45:37] you both amen we're continuing our
[45:39] Series this morning on on manifesting
[45:41] time and I want to take a a subtitle
[45:44] this morning of the heritage of deity
[45:46] amen the heritage of De deity and we're
[45:48] going to be speaking on this attribute
[45:50] of godliness this morning and brother
[45:52] Brandon would take us in a number of
[45:54] different messages on this attribute of
[45:55] God godliness he take us into Matthew 5
[45:58] and he where where Jesus said this be ye
[46:00] therefore perfect even as your father
[46:03] which is in heaven is perfect and then
[46:06] he would say in the Statue of a perfect
[46:07] man he says fifthly now add godliness
[46:10] now what does godliness mean godliness
[46:13] means to be like God he says oh my after
[46:17] you get Faith and virtue and knowledge
[46:19] Temperance patience then be like God he
[46:22] says woo you say I can't do that he says
[46:24] oh yes you can now there's a mystery if
[46:27] ever there was one because we're
[46:29] speaking of the attributes of a
[46:30] Christian and this is before the Holy
[46:32] Ghost this is before the holy ghost that
[46:35] comes at the very end that's charity
[46:36] that's love and yet Peter's telling us
[46:39] we have to have godliness and Jesus is
[46:41] telling us you have to have godliness
[46:42] before you even have the Holy Ghost now
[46:45] that's a mystery if ever there was one
[46:47] but I want to start out by saying this
[46:48] your ultimate Perfection is never
[46:50] realized in this world in this time in
[46:53] this Fallen body we're we're born in sin
[46:55] we're sh shaped in iniquity and our our
[46:57] soul is saved our soul is sealed and our
[46:59] our mind is changed and our our heart is
[47:02] is replaced with another one but yet
[47:04] we're always in a body that's going to
[47:05] fight us and so we cannot come to
[47:07] perfection in this body physically
[47:10] speaking because this body will hold us
[47:12] back Amen on this Earth We're
[47:14] constrained by the physical body that
[47:16] we're living in and we still make
[47:18] mistakes and we're still fighting every
[47:19] day and some days we win and some days
[47:21] we lose and and we've got to be able to
[47:23] accept that that is not the perfection
[47:25] that would keep us out or put us in
[47:28] that's not what he's talking about here
[47:29] I mean full adoption Paul said isn't
[47:31] until the Redemption of our bodies full
[47:34] redemp adoption isn't until we actually
[47:36] get out of here because that's where we
[47:37] have nothing holding us back where we've
[47:39] been brought back to our original place
[47:41] as Sons and Daughters of God that's full
[47:44] adoption is when you're back to your
[47:45] eating condition but the scriptures
[47:47] would say that only god is perfect only
[47:49] God is Holy only God is righteousness
[47:51] and those are attributes we cannot hope
[47:53] to have in ourselves ESP especially
[47:56] without the Holy Ghost but yet the
[47:58] scripture is say telling us that we're
[48:00] supposed to be perfect now brother Brown
[48:02] would say this he says so who can say
[48:04] that this is Holy and that is Holy
[48:06] there's only one thing holy and that's
[48:08] Jesus Christ the son of the Living God
[48:10] who has been made perfect and then he
[48:13] says and our requirement is to be
[48:15] perfect he says there's only one and
[48:17] then he says but your requirement is to
[48:19] be perfect as well now how are we going
[48:21] to be it he says try it yourself I'd
[48:23] hate to try to get to heaven on the
[48:24] merits of I was born 5 minutes ago and
[48:26] I'm going out of the world right now
[48:28] basically saying you're born and you die
[48:30] and that made you perfect and so you
[48:31] could go to heaven he says I'd be lost
[48:34] if I never had an evil thought in my
[48:35] life if I never spoke a bad word in my
[48:37] life if I never looked at anything evil
[48:39] never thought anything evil or nothing
[48:42] I'm just as Rank and black as the smudy
[48:45] walls of hell he says I'm a sinner he
[48:48] says I could come through life and be
[48:50] locked up in a room like some of the
[48:51] carlite sisters or something never see
[48:53] the world stay in there pray all my life
[48:55] do good born a millionaire give to the
[48:58] poor everything I've got and I'm still a
[49:00] sinner and will go to hell I might join
[49:02] the Lutheran Church Baptist Pentecostal
[49:04] Presbyterian when I'm on the Cradle role
[49:07] and live faithful to that church until a
[49:09] 100 years and my life is taken and no
[49:11] man could Point their finger at me and
[49:12] say he's never ever had as much as a bad
[49:15] thought he says I'll go to hell just as
[49:17] sure as I'm
[49:18] standing that means we're doomed we're
[49:21] Fallen we're sinful no matter what we do
[49:24] our very existence speaks of sin and if
[49:27] you know what the original sin is then
[49:29] you understand that your very existence
[49:30] today not being by the spoken word of
[49:33] God sh says that you're
[49:36] sinful you you've gone against the way
[49:38] that God had meant things he says I'm a
[49:41] sinner that's correct I have nothing so
[49:44] don't try and bring anything I have
[49:47] nothing he says there's no way at all I
[49:49] can find any price to be paid God
[49:51] required death and if I give my own life
[49:54] if I give my life then how can I Repent
[49:56] he says the debt has got to be paid
[49:58] first and God was the only one who could
[50:00] lay his life down and take it up again
[50:02] so he could become sin lay his life down
[50:05] and pick it up and call it justice he
[50:07] says and the debt is paid that's where
[50:09] our rest is that's where our hope is is
[50:11] that the price has been paid and God has
[50:13] accepted it he says they say nobody can
[50:16] be perfect the Bible said none is there
[50:19] is none perfect he says there's your
[50:21] contradiction you cannot be perfect in
[50:24] yourself but then he clarifies he says
[50:27] if you're trusting in what you've done
[50:30] you're lost he says so be ye perfect
[50:34] even just as perfect as god is perfect
[50:36] so in ourselves we're hopeless to
[50:38] produce this attribute of godliness this
[50:40] Perfection that he's speaking of the
[50:42] attribute of godliness in its in its
[50:44] fullness takes a working of God it takes
[50:47] the holy spirit in our life and it's a
[50:49] process it's always a process all these
[50:51] things as we showed a few Services ago
[50:53] it starts small and it grows big your
[50:55] Faith starts small and then it grows big
[50:57] then on top of that your virtue small
[50:59] and it grows big and each one is growing
[51:01] as the other grows beneath it as the
[51:02] foundation grows everything else can
[51:04] grow with it and so there's a process to
[51:06] this and Paul would talk about this in
[51:09] Hebrews 6 he says therefore leaving the
[51:12] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[51:15] us go on unto Perfection so you did
[51:19] something and it was right but he says
[51:21] you've got to go on to Perfection he
[51:23] says not laying again the foundation of
[51:24] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[51:26] toward god of the doctr doctrine of
[51:30] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[51:32] of resurrection of the dead and of
[51:33] Eternal judgment what's he talking about
[51:35] it's right teaching it's obedience all
[51:37] those things they're foundational but
[51:39] they're not life they're right but
[51:42] they're not righteous they're good but
[51:44] they're not perfect but they are a part
[51:46] of the working of God he says but what
[51:49] is that Paul said it's all dead Works
[51:51] he's referring to the scripture he says
[51:53] it's something that you do
[51:56] it's right you're supposed to do it but
[51:57] it's still just dead works because the
[51:59] priest could do it he says now let's go
[52:02] on to Perfection oh my we're coming into
[52:04] the Tabernacle not the foundation the
[52:07] Tabernacle itself remember we're talking
[52:09] about the building up of the dwelling
[52:10] place of God he said that's the
[52:12] foundation the law the righteousness
[52:14] joining Church being baptized laying out
[52:16] of hands they're all orders of the
[52:18] church but now let's go into Perfection
[52:21] he says and there's only one place that
[52:23] is perfected and that's Jes Jesus we're
[52:26] talking about being a dwelling place for
[52:28] God and Paul said make sure you go all
[52:29] the way to the person of Christ amen
[52:33] what is that that's the Holy Ghost he
[52:35] says you this is all good and it's
[52:37] foundational but you've got to go to the
[52:38] person before you can ever come into
[52:40] Perfection but it's leading you into
[52:43] these things Romans 8:1 says this and
[52:45] brother this is where brother brandham
[52:47] starts to take us he says there's
[52:48] therefore now no condemnation to them
[52:51] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[52:54] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[52:56] then he repeats that line and then he
[52:58] says that the things that he says that
[53:00] who walk not after the flesh he says the
[53:02] things that they see walking by sight he
[53:06] says everything that you see with your
[53:08] eyes is Earthly but it's the things you
[53:10] see in your spirit through the word he
[53:13] says the word is God's looking glass
[53:16] that reflects what he is and what you
[53:19] are he says hallelujah oh my it tells
[53:22] you there is the only book in the world
[53:24] that tells you where you come from who
[53:27] you are and where you're going he says
[53:29] show me any page of literature anywhere
[53:31] with all the science or anything else
[53:33] every good book that's been written none
[53:35] of it can tell you that this is God's
[53:37] looking glass that shows you what he is
[53:40] and what you are now catch this last
[53:43] line he says then in between there is
[53:45] the bloodline that shows what you can
[53:49] be how if you make the
[53:53] choice he says there you are we're
[53:56] looking at this idea of godliness and
[53:57] brother B saying you've got a choice to
[53:59] make and you look at the word of God and
[54:01] you see what it says about you you see
[54:02] what it says about him he says and
[54:04] you've got to decide are you interested
[54:06] in being it or are you not interested in
[54:08] being it and that's a choice it's a
[54:10] conscious choice you may be a child of
[54:13] God but you get to choose when you start
[54:15] acting like one that's a conscious
[54:17] choice because remember you hear the
[54:18] word and you hear acts 238 and that's a
[54:21] that that's a physical hearing but then
[54:23] you got to make a conscious choice to
[54:26] repent you've got to make a choice for
[54:28] that then you've got to make a choice to
[54:30] get baptized and then you've got to make
[54:32] a choice to physically and emotionally
[54:35] and spiritually and mentally pursue the
[54:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost until you get
[54:39] it you've got to choose what you want
[54:41] you got to choose how far you're going
[54:43] to go and when you're going to go now if
[54:45] you're a child of God God's going to
[54:46] work with you and and he's going to you
[54:48] know he's going to guard you he's going
[54:49] to protect you he's going to put you in
[54:51] a place he if you're a child of God he's
[54:53] going to bring you to a place where
[54:54] you'll make the right choice but you'll
[54:56] still make the choice you still have
[54:59] free moral agency but he'll bring you to
[55:01] a place amen we're T we know that this
[55:04] whole series is leading to the thought
[55:05] of adoption and we're very much now in
[55:07] the season of making the choices that'll
[55:09] decide do we come into adoption or not
[55:12] because remember you can be a child of
[55:13] God and never come to
[55:15] adoption very clearly the scripture
[55:17] teaches that you look in first
[55:19] Corinthians 3 I think it is where it
[55:20] says that every man's work is going to
[55:21] be tried and there's going to be some
[55:23] come in and they don't have anything
[55:25] they have something but it doesn't
[55:26] withstand the fire of God and all
[55:28] they're left with is their soul so they
[55:29] don't lose their soul but they bring
[55:31] nothing with them they never came to
[55:32] adoption they wasted everything God gave
[55:34] them amen but this statue of the perfect
[55:37] man is before our adoption it's the time
[55:39] where we're under a tutor and we're
[55:40] being taught and we're making our our
[55:42] decisions and it's really our spiritual
[55:43] teenage years if I could put it that way
[55:45] the statue of a perfect man is where
[55:47] you're spiritually a teenager you know
[55:49] and as a child we make choices and and
[55:51] if we make enough of the right choices
[55:53] that's when we become an adult see the
[55:55] law says you're an adult at 18 or 21
[55:57] depending on where you live and you get
[55:59] to make choices there and nobody else
[56:01] can take it from you but you're not
[56:02] truly an adult until you make adult
[56:04] decisions and choices until you start
[56:07] choosing what an adult would choose
[56:08] you're not an adult you could be a
[56:09] 50-year-old child today if you don't
[56:12] make the right choices amen but we have
[56:14] a choice to make every day of our life
[56:16] and those choices are on us not on God
[56:19] we get to choose what we're going to do
[56:21] with every moment of our life brother R
[56:23] would say this speaking of Ed Adam and
[56:25] Eve he says now he had to let them get
[56:27] lost he had to let them sin he put them
[56:30] on free moral agency he could not make
[56:33] them sin and remain God and then punish
[56:34] them for something he made them do but
[56:36] when he put man on partnership with him
[56:39] then let man act as a free moral agency
[56:41] the same thing he's got you on today see
[56:44] you act any way you want to you're a
[56:46] free moral agent so therefore he if he
[56:49] put it the first like that he has to put
[56:51] the second like that he has to put
[56:53] everyone like that or he act acted wrong
[56:55] in the first place see but everybody is
[56:58] on the same basis so we're children of
[57:01] God but we still have to have a a make a
[57:03] choice and the choice is when we look in
[57:05] the word will we start acting like what
[57:06] the word says we are or will we continue
[57:09] in our own thoughts and preferences and
[57:10] the the carnality of this body that
[57:12] we're in like I said if God you're a
[57:14] child of God God's going to work with
[57:15] you every child of God he's going to be
[57:18] corrected he's going to be tested he's
[57:19] going to be tried but you're going to
[57:21] decide how quickly this moves across
[57:24] Absol absolutely cuz God I've said it
[57:26] before he'll take you around the
[57:27] mountain you keep making the wrong
[57:28] decision he'll take you around the
[57:30] mountain and around the mountain and
[57:31] around the mountain until you make the
[57:33] right decision and you go where you're
[57:34] supposed to go God's got all the time in
[57:36] the world he's got all the time in the
[57:38] world he's not worried if you're not
[57:40] going to make the right choice he's
[57:41] going to get you to the place where
[57:42] you'll make it of your own free will but
[57:46] the thing with God is he'll start
[57:47] tightening up the screws and he'll make
[57:49] it more and more desperate he'll make it
[57:51] more and more difficult he'll make it
[57:52] hurt more and more because he's trying
[57:54] to get you to make the decision on your
[57:56] own so that you can progress in your in
[57:58] your in your life with him amen but our
[58:00] choice to be a child of God is a choice
[58:02] that we make every day every day it's no
[58:05] different than our choice to be married
[58:06] our choice to love our spouse to love
[58:08] our children we decide that every day
[58:11] it's something we've got to do amen but
[58:13] we're speaking on the side of the
[58:14] heritage of deity and I want you to
[58:16] understand that if you're a child of God
[58:18] then you have the attributes of God
[58:20] built into you you have the DNA of a
[58:22] child of God spiritually speaking that's
[58:25] built into you and the statue of a
[58:27] perfect man is the Holy Spirit the tutor
[58:28] drawing those things out to prove what's
[58:31] inside of you so that he can now come
[58:33] down and start to fill you with these
[58:34] things but no child of God is born
[58:36] without purpose or intent not a single
[58:38] one and we'll see that as we get into
[58:40] Ephesians and these different places is
[58:43] that God attaches a role and a
[58:45] responsibility and a purpose to every
[58:47] single name that's on the Lamb's Book of
[58:49] Life we all have a purpose and some of
[58:51] us have bigger roles and some of us have
[58:53] smaller roles but if you take any
[58:54] anything in your body the smallest
[58:56] things are sometimes the most critical
[58:58] you look at the the capillaries the tiny
[59:00] little U blood vessels that go out to
[59:03] your extremities you take those out and
[59:06] your your body will start to to rot the
[59:09] tiniest thing single cells flow through
[59:12] there and if you take them away then you
[59:14] start to rot your fingertips and your
[59:16] toes and then it starts to creep its way
[59:17] in every single one of us is needed
[59:20] that's why it matters who's in the body
[59:22] and who's not cuz if you're not and we
[59:24] need then the body suffers the body
[59:27] suffers if we're not in our place amen
[59:29] but this term godliness brother Bram he
[59:31] says it means to be like God and it has
[59:33] many different aspects to it and I want
[59:35] to focus more on what he focused on in
[59:36] stature of a perfect man because the the
[59:39] the the term of godliness is really the
[59:42] attribute of being able to receive the
[59:44] word of God which is the will of God and
[59:47] act on it by
[59:49] Revelation be ye perfect as your
[59:52] father's perfect and then he said
[59:53] there's only one perfect and that's
[59:54] Christ so Christ's actions Christ's way
[59:57] that he lived his life is godliness
[59:59] personified in flesh if we could put it
[1:00:01] that way now remember if you come from
[1:00:03] God you'll hear God that's a simple
[1:00:06] thing Jesus said my sheep hear my voice
[1:00:08] and so you're built you're tuned to hear
[1:00:10] the voice of the word if you're a child
[1:00:12] of God now listen my kids know my voice
[1:00:16] and we can be in a crowd and they can
[1:00:18] hear me speaking amen we're in a place
[1:00:21] where there's many voices today in this
[1:00:22] world but if we're in a place and they
[1:00:24] hear me speaking they know that's
[1:00:28] dad and though there are many fathers
[1:00:30] speaking maybe there's only one that's
[1:00:33] their father and when they hear me they
[1:00:34] say that's my dad and they can follow my
[1:00:37] voice and they can come find me in a
[1:00:39] crowd they they talk about the Penguins
[1:00:41] you know and there's millions and
[1:00:43] hundreds of thousands of these things in
[1:00:44] one spot and as soon as the chick is
[1:00:47] Born the parents speak to that chick
[1:00:49] over and over and over again and they
[1:00:51] have a particular song a particular
[1:00:53] sound that they make and and the chick
[1:00:56] becomes tuned to the parents and they
[1:00:58] can find it and it can find them in a
[1:01:00] crowd of hundreds of thousands of
[1:01:01] penguins because what they're tuned to
[1:01:04] only one voice and it's the same thing
[1:01:05] for a child of God Amen is we're tuned
[1:01:08] to hear the voice of God we're tuned to
[1:01:10] hear the word of God and godliness is
[1:01:12] the ability to recognize who God is and
[1:01:15] what he does and what he's expecting
[1:01:17] from us that's what it means but how can
[1:01:19] you be Godly unless you know who God
[1:01:22] is how how can you know how God acts
[1:01:24] unless you you've seen how God acts how
[1:01:27] can you have godliness unless you're
[1:01:28] taught what it looks like how can you
[1:01:30] have godliness unless you're a part of
[1:01:32] God let me put it that way because you
[1:01:35] can't be Godly unless you got something
[1:01:37] of God in you that's impossible because
[1:01:39] we're not we're not black birds putting
[1:01:41] peacock feathers in us remember you have
[1:01:43] to be God to have Godly attributes
[1:01:45] that's the simple fact of the truth and
[1:01:46] brother Brandon would cover this in
[1:01:48] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:01:49] we'll touch on a little bit amen but
[1:01:51] this idea of godliness and being a part
[1:01:53] of God brings us all the way back to
[1:01:55] Eden because this was the great dilemma
[1:01:57] for Eve in the Garden of Eden was that
[1:01:59] she felt that she was being held back
[1:02:01] from being like God she felt that she
[1:02:04] wasn't the way that God was and this is
[1:02:06] what you know Adam was made in the image
[1:02:08] of God he was made in the likeness of
[1:02:10] God he was the son of God Amen he was
[1:02:12] perfect in his form and then God came
[1:02:15] down he said it's not good for him to
[1:02:16] dwell alone and so he took out of that
[1:02:18] man a portion of that man the exact same
[1:02:21] DNA the exact same Supernatural Heritage
[1:02:24] that Adam had and he formed a body
[1:02:27] around it and he built a woman that was
[1:02:28] no less Supernatural than Adam she was
[1:02:31] of the image of God but Adam was the
[1:02:33] masculine attributes now she was the
[1:02:35] feminine and she was a she was as much
[1:02:38] an expression of God as Adam was she was
[1:02:40] just a further revealing of God if we
[1:02:42] could put it that way that's what we're
[1:02:44] seeing today isn't it a further
[1:02:45] revealing of God in a bride body but if
[1:02:48] we go back we start to see that they
[1:02:50] were amateur Gods brother Bron would say
[1:02:52] that that Adam and Eve were amateur gods
[1:02:55] and that they have full dominion over
[1:02:57] the Earth they didn't have it over the
[1:02:59] rest of the universe they didn't have it
[1:03:01] for different planets or anywhere else
[1:03:02] but they were in a place where they were
[1:03:04] a God for that place and they had full
[1:03:06] control over the elements and the
[1:03:08] animals and the plant life and
[1:03:09] everything they had full dominion over
[1:03:11] where they were but we see that they
[1:03:13] lost it and if we can look at how they
[1:03:15] lost it we can see how we can get it
[1:03:16] back so if we go to Genesis 3 it says
[1:03:19] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:03:21] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:03:23] had made and he said unto the woman y ha
[1:03:25] God said ye shall not eat of every tree
[1:03:27] of the
[1:03:28] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:03:30] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:03:32] tree of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:03:34] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:03:35] garden God has said ye shall not eat of
[1:03:37] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[1:03:39] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:03:41] you shall not surely
[1:03:43] die that was his lie it says for God do
[1:03:47] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:03:49] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[1:03:51] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:03:53] now notice the Serpent's temptation to
[1:03:55] Eve was at God's holding
[1:03:58] back God's making himself a leak God's
[1:04:01] placing himself above you God doesn't
[1:04:03] want you to be exactly the way he is
[1:04:06] that was his temptation to Eve his
[1:04:08] temptation to Eve was you're going to be
[1:04:11] as God you know what he was 100% right
[1:04:15] because the fact is remember Eve was God
[1:04:18] on Earth with Adam and she went from
[1:04:21] being God to as God like God but not God
[1:04:26] he didn't lie that she would be as God
[1:04:29] but what happened was she failed to
[1:04:30] recognize her position and he's he then
[1:04:33] tempted her he fooled her into thinking
[1:04:35] that she could come up higher when
[1:04:37] really she was already where she needed
[1:04:38] to be and he was going to drag her down
[1:04:40] lower amen everything he said there was
[1:04:43] 100% correct but she missed that she was
[1:04:46] an amateur God that she was God on this
[1:04:48] Earth amen and that's what we'll find
[1:04:50] with Satan every single time he never
[1:04:52] tells us who we really are
[1:04:54] he'll try and make you think there's a
[1:04:56] higher plane he'll tell there's a deeper
[1:04:57] depth there's going to be something that
[1:04:59] he can offer you but he'll never tell
[1:05:00] you that you're a blood bot born again
[1:05:03] sinless son or daughter of God he'll
[1:05:05] never tell you that you're the bride of
[1:05:07] Christ that you're the revealing of the
[1:05:08] word for this age he'll never tell you
[1:05:10] that but he'll tell you I've got
[1:05:12] something better for you and God's
[1:05:14] holding
[1:05:15] back remember what it said about Adam it
[1:05:17] says it's going through the lineage he
[1:05:19] said he was the son of Enos which was
[1:05:21] the son of Seth which was the son of
[1:05:22] Adam which was the son of God
[1:05:25] Adam was the literal First Son of God on
[1:05:28] this Earth in a physical body he was the
[1:05:30] first one and he fell from that now
[1:05:33] remember this the the the this the
[1:05:36] serpent told Eve he says you're going to
[1:05:38] you're going to become as God he didn't
[1:05:40] tell her she was going to lose her
[1:05:42] position he didn't let her realize that
[1:05:44] amen but it didn't mean anything to her
[1:05:46] because she had forgotten her position
[1:05:48] in the first place she didn't perhaps
[1:05:49] even realize that this is what it means
[1:05:51] to be a God that this thing that's so
[1:05:53] normal to me this thing I have every day
[1:05:56] is actually being a God she didn't know
[1:05:57] what she had she didn't know who she was
[1:05:59] and so as soon as the serpent got her
[1:06:01] alone he could fool her but remember he
[1:06:03] didn't fool Adam Adam knew who he was he
[1:06:06] knew who God was he knew what the word
[1:06:08] was and he stuck to it and so he joined
[1:06:11] himself to her brother Ram says he
[1:06:12] quickly joined himself to her so that
[1:06:14] God wouldn't destroy them and he was
[1:06:17] trusting that God would work it all out
[1:06:19] later but the serpent separated Eve away
[1:06:21] and if if only temporarily she forgot
[1:06:23] who she was God will separate you from
[1:06:26] fellowship he'll separate you from the
[1:06:27] word he'll separate you from these
[1:06:29] things that help keep us aware of who we
[1:06:31] are and we'll get into how he does that
[1:06:33] amen but he says this brother Bram says
[1:06:36] when Eve went away from the word she
[1:06:38] went away from her mate he says and when
[1:06:41] the church goes away from the word to a
[1:06:42] denomination she rejects and commits
[1:06:45] fornications with the WIS world of man's
[1:06:47] Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's
[1:06:49] word the Bible said committing spiritual
[1:06:52] fornications and any word in the Bible
[1:06:55] That's rejected or of any self
[1:06:57] interpretation is put to it it's
[1:06:58] absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:07:00] adultery against the god that is your
[1:07:03] husband that's serious that's serious he
[1:07:07] says an adulterous never enters the
[1:07:09] kingdom of heaven we know that see now
[1:07:11] see that's what Eve did at the first
[1:07:13] place so Eve lost her godliness and she
[1:07:17] became as God
[1:07:18] instead she knew right and wrong she
[1:07:20] knew good and evil but she didn't have
[1:07:23] the authority didn't have the power she
[1:07:24] didn't have the position that she had
[1:07:26] before listen God dogs produce brother
[1:07:30] Braham said God dogs produce dogs cats
[1:07:32] produce cats Gods produce Gods God
[1:07:35] produces Gods we're meant to be Gods
[1:07:37] we're meant to be the very expression of
[1:07:39] God on this Earth amen the scripture
[1:07:41] says we're going to rule with him we're
[1:07:42] going to reign with him we're going to
[1:07:43] sit in his throne but it's in a future
[1:07:45] tense but we've got to go through this
[1:07:47] process of adoption this process of the
[1:07:49] Statue of a perfect man to be restored
[1:07:51] to that place and now Peter's coming
[1:07:53] back around he's saying you've got to
[1:07:54] come back to that godliness you've got
[1:07:57] to come back to what knowing who you are
[1:08:00] youve got to come back and know who he
[1:08:02] is and you got to recognize your place
[1:08:03] in it and when you do that then
[1:08:05] godliness starts to flow through you
[1:08:07] because to be like God you've got to
[1:08:09] recognize that you're a part of God
[1:08:11] Peter saying you got to recognize what's
[1:08:13] going on that this isn't just an emotion
[1:08:15] that this just isn't an experience but
[1:08:16] this is the literal life of God coming
[1:08:19] back into us to restore us back to Eden
[1:08:22] this is the working of God amen we've
[1:08:24] got to know where we're going we've got
[1:08:25] to know where our purpose is how by the
[1:08:28] word of God he gave us a word of God so
[1:08:31] that we know these things amen there's
[1:08:33] always a process the the whole
[1:08:34] development of a child of God is a
[1:08:36] process and God shows it through the
[1:08:38] scriptures now brother Romy would take
[1:08:40] us back to Ephesians 4 when he's
[1:08:42] preaching on statute of a perfect man
[1:08:43] and this thing of godliness and this is
[1:08:45] how he says we get to Godliness he says
[1:08:47] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:08:50] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[1:08:52] and teachers for what purpose for the
[1:08:56] perfecting of the Saints remember the
[1:08:58] scripture says Jesus said be ye
[1:08:59] therefore perfect this is how you get
[1:09:02] perfect in the sense that Christ meant
[1:09:03] it he says it's for the perfecting of
[1:09:05] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:09:07] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:09:11] until we all come all of us we don't get
[1:09:15] to look down at the person next to us we
[1:09:17] can't get out of here until they are
[1:09:19] ready to go so let's not look down but
[1:09:21] let's pull up let's work together let's
[1:09:23] have patience with each other let's
[1:09:25] support each other amen we've all got to
[1:09:28] get out of here we can't get out till
[1:09:30] every one of our children has the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost impossible they've got to have a
[1:09:35] new birth amen till every one of us is
[1:09:38] found in our position in place in the
[1:09:40] body of Christ but this is the tie in
[1:09:42] here in Ephesians 4 between second Peter
[1:09:45] 1 which is the attributes of the statute
[1:09:47] of a perfect man and Paul's tying it in
[1:09:49] he's saying you get there by the hearing
[1:09:50] of the word of God you'll find that's
[1:09:53] the the the Common Thread between all
[1:09:55] these things the word of God can't lie
[1:09:57] and the word of God says that God has
[1:09:59] Anointed God has appointed God has
[1:10:01] ordained a fivefold Ministry to perfect
[1:10:04] the body of Christ through the preaching
[1:10:06] of the Gospel that's what the word says
[1:10:09] amen and every single one of those
[1:10:11] Ministries is required to perfect us and
[1:10:13] I said this recently and I I'll say it
[1:10:15] again I have heard a minister say
[1:10:17] recently that we don't need evangelists
[1:10:19] anymore that we don't need prophets
[1:10:22] anymore that the word put it in there
[1:10:26] and I don't see where he took it out
[1:10:28] brother Brandon would say he says
[1:10:30] because people would say well it's only
[1:10:31] for the days of the Apostles the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost is only for that Divine Healing is
[1:10:34] only for that and all these different
[1:10:36] things and brother Ram said I can show
[1:10:37] you where he put it in you show me where
[1:10:39] he took it out so that means today we
[1:10:41] still need prophets Apostles evangelists
[1:10:44] teachers and pastors not a word
[1:10:47] Prophet but there is the position of
[1:10:50] prophets in the body God has men that
[1:10:53] have prophetic gifts inside the body
[1:10:55] absolutely so we don't throw those away
[1:10:58] but a word Prophet is completely
[1:11:00] different so we're not trying to preach
[1:11:02] something like that but every single one
[1:11:04] of these things is happening is supposed
[1:11:07] to be happening in the body of Christ
[1:11:08] because I don't know and those ministers
[1:11:10] don't even know what's going on in
[1:11:11] people's lives but God sends us a
[1:11:13] message for the people and that's why
[1:11:16] we're supposed to pray and that's why
[1:11:18] we're supposed to study until we felt
[1:11:20] laid led to go in a direction because
[1:11:22] God knows all things things I don't know
[1:11:24] what's going on in your life I know what
[1:11:26] you tell me and even then it can be
[1:11:28] tempered or Changed by your feeling on
[1:11:30] it or your thought on it or your
[1:11:31] perception but God knows what we truly
[1:11:33] need so he sends a Ministry to us to
[1:11:36] meet the need that's what's happening
[1:11:39] and sometimes it takes an evangelist to
[1:11:41] meet the need and the pastor can't do it
[1:11:43] sometimes it takes a teacher to meet the
[1:11:44] need we've got all these different needs
[1:11:47] in our bodies and God knows what we
[1:11:48] truly need and he'll send anointed man
[1:11:50] to feed us for those things godliness
[1:11:52] requires knowing who God is and that
[1:11:54] takes an evangelist and that takes a
[1:11:56] missionary to tell you who the true God
[1:11:58] is remember Paul was going through the
[1:12:00] Gentile Nations and he came to a place
[1:12:02] and they were worshiping the unknown God
[1:12:05] he said how about I tell you who God is
[1:12:07] that's their work is to tell them who
[1:12:09] Christ is and get him to a place of
[1:12:10] saving but then you've got to know who
[1:12:12] you are and that's usually the work of a
[1:12:14] pastor and a teacher and then sometimes
[1:12:17] we need to know the direct will of God
[1:12:19] for a situation and that's the work of a
[1:12:21] prophet cuz they can go and they can get
[1:12:23] a direct word from the Lord and they can
[1:12:25] come back and say thus sayeth the Lord
[1:12:28] You're supposed to do this or don't do
[1:12:30] that they can do it
[1:12:33] absolutely every single one of them is
[1:12:35] needed and every one of those roles is
[1:12:37] for the perfecting and edifying of the
[1:12:39] body not for themselves not to build up
[1:12:43] a Ministry not to build up a comfortable
[1:12:45] living but it's for the sake of the
[1:12:46] people Amen brother R would say this he
[1:12:49] says faith cometh by hearing then God
[1:12:52] has set in the church upon Apostles
[1:12:54] prophets evangelists teachers and
[1:12:55] pastors all for the Perfection of the
[1:12:57] Saints now watch what he's doing he says
[1:13:00] now if he can get a hold of your heart
[1:13:03] then he can work his works there are
[1:13:06] some things the pastor can't deal with
[1:13:08] in your
[1:13:09] life so he sends an evangelist he sends
[1:13:12] a teacher maybe he sends another Pastor
[1:13:14] in we've got to be okay with that but he
[1:13:18] knows how to what get a hold of your
[1:13:21] heart so that he can do his work
[1:13:24] he says but as long as you get yourself
[1:13:26] out of the way as long as you can relax
[1:13:28] yourself and let the Holy Spirit take
[1:13:30] over he said I'm the vine you are the
[1:13:32] branches and the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:13:34] but it energizes the branch to bear
[1:13:37] fruit and he says this is what the
[1:13:38] ministry of the word is doing is it's
[1:13:41] God speaking to you and it's energizing
[1:13:43] you if you can relax yourself get
[1:13:45] yourself out of the way then the word
[1:13:47] can come in and it can start to have an
[1:13:49] effect in your
[1:13:50] life what's the effect what's the effect
[1:13:53] of of anointed Ministry Paul continued
[1:13:55] in Ephesians 14 he says that we
[1:13:57] henceforth be no more
[1:14:00] children we grow up watch what he says
[1:14:04] we're not now CU this is what children
[1:14:06] are tossed to and fro up one day out the
[1:14:10] next down the next in one day out the
[1:14:13] next emotional one day and completely
[1:14:16] depleted the next up and down in and out
[1:14:18] there's no constancy to a child children
[1:14:21] have
[1:14:22] Tantrums
[1:14:23] right children love us one day and hate
[1:14:25] us the next or so they
[1:14:28] say right nobody wants to be working
[1:14:32] with children all the
[1:14:34] time when it comes to
[1:14:36] spiritual because you can't depend on
[1:14:39] them he says they're carried about by
[1:14:41] every wind of Doctrine one Minister
[1:14:43] rolls through and we follow that one
[1:14:45] then the next one roll through and we
[1:14:46] follow that one and then the next one
[1:14:47] the next one the next one he says by the
[1:14:49] Slate of men we easily
[1:14:51] manipulated he says and cunning
[1:14:53] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:14:56] deceive but watch what we are he says
[1:14:59] but speaking the truth in
[1:15:02] love we may grow up into him in all
[1:15:05] things which is the head even Christ
[1:15:09] that's what it looks like to be in
[1:15:12] godliness he says from what from whom
[1:15:15] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:15:17] compacted by that which every joint
[1:15:19] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:15:21] working in the measure of every part
[1:15:23] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:15:25] edifying of itself in love the most
[1:15:27] difficult scripture that you can ever
[1:15:28] read what does that mean in the amplifi
[1:15:31] says from him the whole body the whole
[1:15:33] church and all its various parts is
[1:15:35] joined and knitted firmly together by
[1:15:38] what every joint
[1:15:40] supplies that means that what happens is
[1:15:42] as you come into a body the body
[1:15:45] recognizes your need and your fit and
[1:15:48] that's what joins you in cuz you're not
[1:15:51] a child you're an adult you you have
[1:15:53] purpose you have meaning you have the
[1:15:56] strength and the maturity to step in and
[1:15:58] fulfill a
[1:15:59] role that's what draws us together is
[1:16:02] that we recognize how you fit into the
[1:16:04] body we all have a part to play he says
[1:16:08] when each part is working properly so we
[1:16:11] might recognize a gift but it's got to
[1:16:14] be in operation properly that's a
[1:16:16] continuous growing process God's always
[1:16:18] working on us he's always working on us
[1:16:21] it says and when each part is working
[1:16:23] properly it causes the body to grow and
[1:16:26] mature building itself up in unselfish
[1:16:31] love godliness you'll see unselfishness
[1:16:34] is a great deal to do with godliness the
[1:16:37] preaching of the word is meant to
[1:16:38] restore us back to our position in
[1:16:40] Christ and we preached on this many
[1:16:42] times how our names are written on the
[1:16:43] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:16:44] foundation of the world and God's entire
[1:16:47] purpose of giving us this word is to
[1:16:49] bring us back to what he said about us
[1:16:51] to our position in Christ to our place
[1:16:53] with God before it All Began amen it's
[1:16:55] to restore us to our even condition and
[1:16:57] he's got us to got to get us to
[1:16:58] recognize him so that we can recognize
[1:17:00] ourself in him and then the two of those
[1:17:02] things start us on a journey that brings
[1:17:04] us back to our Perfection and it's only
[1:17:06] through a perfect sacrifice that we can
[1:17:08] do that Amen brother Brown would say
[1:17:10] this in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:17:11] revealed he says what's his purpose now
[1:17:13] Express himself as a son see and now
[1:17:16] that in him might dwell the fullness of
[1:17:18] the godhead bodily all through the
[1:17:20] scriptures that's what God's purpose was
[1:17:22] then through this life of this son his
[1:17:25] cross the blood it says here of his
[1:17:26] cross that he might reconcile to himself
[1:17:28] a body a bride which is Eve the second
[1:17:31] Eve the same thing he did in Adam and
[1:17:33] Eve giving a type that they were Christ
[1:17:35] and the bride he says he is the second
[1:17:37] Adam the church is the second
[1:17:40] Eve so he has to he had to succeed where
[1:17:44] Adam failed willingly Adam fail
[1:17:47] willingly Christ had to succeed
[1:17:49] willingly and that was through surrender
[1:17:51] it was the same sacrifice but but
[1:17:53] because he was imperfection then his had
[1:17:54] the effect that it was supposed to have
[1:17:56] amen but we know this that not all who
[1:17:58] hear this gospel will respond we preach
[1:18:01] the gospel as if everyone's going to be
[1:18:03] saved but we know that not everyone is
[1:18:05] amen there are children of God and then
[1:18:06] there's everyone else and that's hard
[1:18:09] but it's true and I can say it because
[1:18:10] we don't have any visitors this morning
[1:18:12] but it's true that not everyone that
[1:18:13] hears it is a child of God Jesus said as
[1:18:17] much in John 8 he says Jesus said unto
[1:18:19] them if God were your father you would
[1:18:21] love me for I proceeded forth and come
[1:18:23] from God neither came I of myself but he
[1:18:25] sent me he says why do you not
[1:18:28] understand my speech even because you
[1:18:30] cannot hear my word that word here means
[1:18:33] hearken obey and consider he says you
[1:18:36] can't even consider my word it wasn't
[1:18:39] even in them to stop and think that he
[1:18:41] might be right because there was nothing
[1:18:43] in them to respond to it in the first
[1:18:45] place you would think that as a as as a
[1:18:47] group of ministers as a group of priests
[1:18:49] that they could at least sit back I mean
[1:18:51] they they love to debate the the Jews
[1:18:53] love to debate they they love to sit
[1:18:55] down and go through the word and yet the
[1:18:57] word in flesh stands in front of them
[1:18:58] and they wouldn't even stop to consider
[1:19:01] is he
[1:19:01] right they couldn't do it it wasn't in
[1:19:04] them to do it they rejected it without
[1:19:06] consideration he says ye are of your
[1:19:08] father the devil and the lust of your
[1:19:10] father you will do he was murderer from
[1:19:12] the beginning and Abode not in the truth
[1:19:14] because there's no truth in him when he
[1:19:16] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:19:18] for he's a liar and the father of it he
[1:19:20] said and because I tell you the truth
[1:19:22] you believe me not why because it's not
[1:19:24] in you the truth is not in you you can't
[1:19:26] respond to it he says which of you
[1:19:28] convinces me of sin and if I say the
[1:19:30] truth why do you not believe me he that
[1:19:32] is of God heareth God's words ye
[1:19:35] therefore hear them not because ye are
[1:19:37] not of God
[1:19:39] ouch what an
[1:19:42] indictment you can't hear my words
[1:19:45] because you are not of
[1:19:46] God Jesus would say in Luke 10:21 and
[1:19:49] brother Brandon would reference this he
[1:19:50] says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[1:19:53] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[1:19:54] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has
[1:19:56] hid these things from the wise and
[1:19:58] prudent wise and prudent in their own
[1:20:02] eyes they weren't truly wise and prudent
[1:20:04] but in their own eyes they were he says
[1:20:06] and you have revealed them unto babes
[1:20:09] even so father for so it seemed good in
[1:20:12] thy sight brother Brown would say this
[1:20:14] way he says so but God has purposed that
[1:20:16] and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent
[1:20:18] and wise and revealed it to the
[1:20:20] predestinated babes he says who were
[1:20:23] predestinated to receive it that's the
[1:20:25] reason watched out through the age
[1:20:27] whatever that light hit s some they turn
[1:20:30] it away and it flashed away they each
[1:20:32] one heard it but they rejected it and so
[1:20:35] it just went on to the next
[1:20:37] one he says great intellectuals and
[1:20:40] those great priests standing there there
[1:20:41] were rabbis from great teachers and
[1:20:43] Authority like Nicodemus and them the
[1:20:45] man Polished in scholarship and he
[1:20:48] couldn't even understand it the ministry
[1:20:51] of that day the priesthood of that day
[1:20:52] they couldn't listen to Jesus because
[1:20:54] they were not of the heritage of Jesus
[1:20:56] there was no deity in them there was no
[1:20:58] God in them amen they were they were
[1:20:59] those that heard Jesus and then there
[1:21:02] were those that heard him gladly they
[1:21:04] all heard but only a certain group heard
[1:21:06] him gladly why because they were of him
[1:21:09] amen they came from the same Source they
[1:21:10] were from the same family bloodline
[1:21:12] spiritually speaking they came from God
[1:21:14] and just like Christ they'll go back to
[1:21:15] God and now Christ is there preaching to
[1:21:17] them to help redeem them and bring them
[1:21:19] back to God and only some of them can
[1:21:21] hear it and some of them can receive
[1:21:23] it taking us over to Psalms 82 we're
[1:21:27] coming back to this s of godliness and
[1:21:29] tying this all together he said David
[1:21:32] said God stands in the congregation of
[1:21:34] the mighty he judgeth among the gods
[1:21:38] we'll see that the congregation of the
[1:21:39] mighty and the gods are the same group
[1:21:41] and it's the children of
[1:21:42] God he says how long will you judge
[1:21:45] unjustly and accept the persons of the
[1:21:47] wicked St he says defend the poor and
[1:21:50] fatherless do justice to The Afflicted
[1:21:52] and needy deliver the poor and needy rid
[1:21:54] them out of the hand of the wicked they
[1:21:56] know not neither will they understand
[1:21:59] they walk on in darkness all the
[1:22:01] foundations of the Earth are out of
[1:22:02] course who's they the poor and needy the
[1:22:05] fatherless The Afflicted those that are
[1:22:06] in darkness they they don't understand
[1:22:09] they're walking in darkness and he says
[1:22:10] the world's out of course the world is
[1:22:12] out of kilter the world is messed up the
[1:22:14] world is in chaos and he says but I have
[1:22:18] said ye are gods and all of you are the
[1:22:23] of the most
[1:22:24] high the whole earth scripture says it's
[1:22:26] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:22:28] sons of God now I'm jumping way ahead in
[1:22:31] this series but let me tell you they're
[1:22:33] not groaning for the manifestation we
[1:22:34] had before the Rapture because that
[1:22:36] doesn't change the earth everything that
[1:22:38] changes is only temporary look at
[1:22:40] brother brandham brother Bram steps into
[1:22:42] adoption remember and he's going across
[1:22:44] that field and there's a bull there and
[1:22:46] he comes up and he arouses the bull and
[1:22:49] he angers the bull because the bull owns
[1:22:51] the field
[1:22:53] and brother brandham an adopted son of
[1:22:55] God now he apologizes to the bull for
[1:22:59] waking him up for disrupting him but he
[1:23:01] says I'm on a mission for the Lord so he
[1:23:05] says you will have to go back and lay
[1:23:08] down cuz I've got something to do for
[1:23:10] the Lord he says in the bowl kind of
[1:23:12] shook his head a couple times and then
[1:23:13] he went and laid down and didn't even
[1:23:15] look at brother brandham as he continued
[1:23:16] on what did he do he restored that bull
[1:23:19] back to that Bull's eating condition but
[1:23:21] let me tell you the next time a person
[1:23:22] walked in that field that bull was right
[1:23:24] back to where he was before right
[1:23:27] temporarily there was a manifestation of
[1:23:29] a Son of God effect on that bull but it
[1:23:31] didn't stick it out that bull went back
[1:23:34] to being a mean killer but as in the
[1:23:37] presence of an adopted son of God it
[1:23:39] would have an effect but it wasn't a
[1:23:40] lasting effect the Earth's groaning for
[1:23:43] a lasting effect and that doesn't come
[1:23:45] until we're out of here and we come back
[1:23:46] and there's a millennial rain really it
[1:23:48] doesn't come back until the whole thing
[1:23:49] is is is completely burned with fire and
[1:23:51] then we rain with him eternally cuz
[1:23:53] that's when there's no more sin left
[1:23:55] remember Satan's Bound by by by chains
[1:23:58] of uh there's nobody left for him to
[1:24:01] change of circumstance I believe brother
[1:24:02] Braham said because there's nobody left
[1:24:04] for him to use in the Thousand-Year
[1:24:05] Reign amen and the the cattle lie down
[1:24:08] and the they they'll eat straw and the
[1:24:09] the Sheep will lie down with the the
[1:24:11] line and these different things but then
[1:24:13] it's all destroyed and it all comes back
[1:24:15] in a perfect way it's complete and total
[1:24:17] restoration amen but he says I've said
[1:24:19] you are gods and all of you are children
[1:24:22] of the most high the the scripture is
[1:24:25] surrounded as we see here where God is
[1:24:26] rebuking the children of God because
[1:24:28] they're not doing what he said to do he
[1:24:30] sent his word to them he said you need
[1:24:32] to step up there are people that need
[1:24:34] you there are situations that need you
[1:24:36] there's people that can't get anywhere
[1:24:38] unless you step into your position and
[1:24:40] if you finish out that scripture he says
[1:24:42] and you don't do it and so they're going
[1:24:43] to die just like men and so are you
[1:24:45] because you didn't step into the word of
[1:24:46] God the people need help and unless the
[1:24:48] children of God step into their position
[1:24:51] then they can't be helped
[1:24:53] then we come to Thessalonians 1
[1:24:55] Thessalonians 5:5 and it says this ye
[1:24:57] are all the children of light and the
[1:24:59] children of the day we are not of the
[1:25:01] night nor of Darkness amen we're
[1:25:03] supposed to be a beam of hope we're
[1:25:04] supposed to be a light a shining light
[1:25:07] that people can see Jesus said a light
[1:25:09] that's on a hill cannot be hid we don't
[1:25:12] put it under a bushel God doesn't hide
[1:25:14] who we are people ought to be able to
[1:25:16] see us amen and they ought to be able to
[1:25:18] see that we live by something different
[1:25:20] than they live and it's by the word of
[1:25:22] God amen they ought to see us as an
[1:25:23] example of obedience of humility of
[1:25:26] leadership and all these things they
[1:25:28] ought to see us as a place to go when
[1:25:29] they have questions and concerns you
[1:25:31] know what you'll find that often in the
[1:25:33] workplace they'll talk to everyone else
[1:25:35] about everything else but when it comes
[1:25:36] down to where things really matter in
[1:25:38] life you know where they usually come to
[1:25:40] the believer cuz you've got it together
[1:25:43] they see that you've got a marriage that
[1:25:44] works they see you've got good kids they
[1:25:46] see that you've got a way that seems to
[1:25:48] handle the pressures and the failures of
[1:25:49] life or keeps you out of them in some
[1:25:51] cases and so they go to us and they say
[1:25:53] how do you do it we're supposed to be
[1:25:55] obvious amen we're not supposed to be
[1:25:57] just hearers but we're supposed to be
[1:25:59] doers of what we hear amen the people in
[1:26:02] Psalms 82 they didn't do it and they
[1:26:04] failed to achieve what God had purposed
[1:26:05] for them and other people suffered
[1:26:07] because they didn't step into their role
[1:26:08] amen you can't be in darkness and help
[1:26:10] somebody that's in darkness you can't be
[1:26:12] in sin and help a sinner amen you got to
[1:26:14] be at a place where you can pull them
[1:26:15] out if you're not walking in light you
[1:26:17] can't help anybody that's in darkness
[1:26:19] James said this he says but be ye doers
[1:26:21] of the word and not hearers only but
[1:26:24] look how he he finishes it he says
[1:26:26] deceiving your own selves it's striking
[1:26:29] to me that when we don't act it the only
[1:26:31] one we're fooling isn't the only one I'm
[1:26:33] fooling is me because we don't fool
[1:26:35] anybody else around
[1:26:36] us we can be known as a great talker but
[1:26:40] if we're not a great doer then people
[1:26:42] will figure out pretty good that we're
[1:26:43] just a big bag of hot air remember we
[1:26:46] read in I think it was in the in the
[1:26:47] temperance service we did recently
[1:26:49] brother Bram said let someone cross you
[1:26:50] up one time and that'll show who you are
[1:26:54] let somebody do something that they
[1:26:55] really ought not to do let somebody hurt
[1:26:57] your feelings let somebody take credit
[1:26:58] for something you've done whatever it
[1:27:00] might be let somebody do something badly
[1:27:02] to you and then see what comes out
[1:27:03] they'll see real quick whether we're
[1:27:04] Christians or Not by how we respond to
[1:27:06] those
[1:27:07] things but we come to Jesus day and he
[1:27:10] takes us back to the scripture that's
[1:27:11] what I love about Jesus is he was the
[1:27:13] word and the word comes to the word and
[1:27:16] the word always refers to the word and
[1:27:18] he would take us back time and time
[1:27:19] again he lived by the word he fulfilled
[1:27:21] the word he died by the word he rose by
[1:27:22] the word all of his life was by the word
[1:27:25] and it was an example to us amen of how
[1:27:27] it ought to just flow through our lives
[1:27:29] Jesus said this in John 10 he says I and
[1:27:31] my father are
[1:27:33] one what a
[1:27:36] statement then the Jews took up stones
[1:27:38] again to Stone
[1:27:40] him they were always trying to Stone
[1:27:42] Jesus they picked him up again that
[1:27:44] means they picked him up earlier and
[1:27:46] they laid them down and now they picked
[1:27:48] them up again we're going to offend
[1:27:51] people by by our
[1:27:53] claim you claim you're a child of God
[1:27:56] people don't mind that you say I'm the
[1:27:58] word made flesh for today look
[1:28:01] out look out they won't accept it they
[1:28:04] won't accept
[1:28:06] it but you're supposed to be and you
[1:28:09] will be the word of God manifested for
[1:28:12] today he says the Jews took up stones
[1:28:15] again to Stone him you notice the only
[1:28:17] ones that want to Stone were religious
[1:28:20] people he says Jesus answer them many
[1:28:22] good works have I showed you from my
[1:28:24] father for which of these Works do you
[1:28:25] stole me I've done a bunch of good
[1:28:27] things what are these good things that
[1:28:29] I've done that's offended you and then
[1:28:31] the Jews answered him saying for good
[1:28:32] work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy
[1:28:35] and because thou that thou being a man
[1:28:38] maketh thyself God Jesus is saying I've
[1:28:40] done all these good things you're stolen
[1:28:42] me for this they said no no no it's that
[1:28:44] you make yourself God and you're in
[1:28:47] flesh I I don't I sometimes wonder what
[1:28:49] they thought Messiah was going to be if
[1:28:52] not God in flesh then what was
[1:28:54] it Moses was as close as you could get
[1:28:57] to God in flesh and Christ comes and he
[1:28:59] does way more than Moses ever did
[1:29:01] fulfills every aspect of the scripture
[1:29:04] and then they come and say sorry you're
[1:29:05] not allowed to be it you're not allowed
[1:29:07] to be the manifestation of the word for
[1:29:08] this day you're not allowed to be the
[1:29:10] Messiah why because it didn't line up
[1:29:12] with what they thought it was going to
[1:29:13] be why because it didn't what affirm
[1:29:16] them in their position and place
[1:29:18] jealousy is what caused them to do these
[1:29:19] things Envy amen and so they had to deny
[1:29:22] claim and that meant what he was saying
[1:29:23] was blasphemy instead of Prophecy being
[1:29:25] fulfilled but they didn't stop Prophecy
[1:29:28] from being fulfilled he was still the
[1:29:30] word made flesh amen they denied him
[1:29:32] being in flesh they denied the
[1:29:33] manifestation they denied the deity of
[1:29:36] God in
[1:29:37] flesh that's what they did they
[1:29:39] literally turned down God in flesh they
[1:29:41] couldn't accept it but jesus takes them
[1:29:43] right back to the scripture and he takes
[1:29:44] us to Psalm 82 which we just read and it
[1:29:46] says Jesus answered them and said is it
[1:29:48] not written in your law that I said ye
[1:29:50] are gods he says if he called them Gods
[1:29:54] now watch the
[1:29:55] definition if he called them Gods unto
[1:29:59] whom the word of God came and the
[1:30:02] scripture cannot be broken say ye of him
[1:30:04] whom the father has Sanctified and sent
[1:30:06] into the world thou Blasphemous because
[1:30:08] I said I am the Son of God Jesus said
[1:30:11] the definition of a God is that it is a
[1:30:14] person to whom the word
[1:30:16] comes Jesus putting it right back in
[1:30:18] their laps he's saying you're saying
[1:30:20] that flesh cannot be deity but yet your
[1:30:22] word says that flesh is deity and not
[1:30:25] just one but many not just one person
[1:30:28] but there's many of you are Gods when it
[1:30:30] comes to the truth of the matter amen
[1:30:32] what is it he says the defining
[1:30:34] characteristic of a child of God is that
[1:30:35] the word comes to you remember the word
[1:30:38] comes to many people but it's sent to an
[1:30:40] elect group behold I send you Elijah the
[1:30:44] prophet if you don't recognize him as
[1:30:46] Elijah the prophet he wasn't sent to you
[1:30:49] if you don't recognize your day and its
[1:30:50] message it wasn't sent for you but it's
[1:30:52] sent for a purpose but it's like the
[1:30:54] parable of the net Jesus said where the
[1:30:56] net goes out and it catches a bunch but
[1:30:58] they only take the ones that will sell
[1:31:00] they only take the ones that they want
[1:31:01] from market and it's the way the word of
[1:31:03] God goes It goes out and it catches some
[1:31:04] but only a few are really meant to be in
[1:31:06] there and that's the ones that come
[1:31:08] through the whole process this attribute
[1:31:10] of godliness is demonstrated in the
[1:31:12] ability to hear the word and act on it
[1:31:15] many people hear it many people hear it
[1:31:18] but the ability to act on the word of
[1:31:19] God by Revelation when you're a child of
[1:31:22] God and the word of God is preached it
[1:31:23] has an effect on your
[1:31:25] life not just on your mind it changes
[1:31:28] our thinking it definitely changes our
[1:31:30] thinking but it has to come from here
[1:31:32] into here and it has to be lived out in
[1:31:34] our lives amen it brings our thoughts
[1:31:36] into subjection it tells us to lay down
[1:31:38] our rights it tells us to lay down our
[1:31:40] emotions and to stay with what the word
[1:31:42] says cuz that's going to have the
[1:31:43] lasting effect that's what's going to
[1:31:45] bring us into our fullness as Sons and
[1:31:47] Daughters of God Amen God subject to his
[1:31:49] own word god bound himself to his word
[1:31:52] and how can we as his children do any
[1:31:53] less we're Bound by the word of God and
[1:31:56] this godliness attribute is the
[1:31:58] attribute that causes us to hear the
[1:31:59] word and act on the word by Revelation
[1:32:02] by the quickening of the word by the
[1:32:04] Holy Spirit that's what it takes in our
[1:32:06] lives amen not all who hear it but all
[1:32:09] who are sent it are the go are the
[1:32:11] children of the Gospel they're the
[1:32:13] children of God it's targeted for our
[1:32:14] ears and what he's saying here is if the
[1:32:16] word of God is brought to you then you
[1:32:18] are a child of God but if you don't
[1:32:21] recogn is the word then how can you be a
[1:32:23] child if you don't recognize of the
[1:32:25] voice of God how can you be of God cuz
[1:32:27] my sheep know my voice and another they
[1:32:29] will not follow they can't even hear it
[1:32:30] amen the word comes to the word that's
[1:32:32] the simple truth you're a part of God
[1:32:34] the word comes to you amen listen we
[1:32:36] don't always understand
[1:32:38] it I don't always understand it but
[1:32:42] something in me responds to it
[1:32:44] nonetheless I think that's the the most
[1:32:46] wonderful thing as a child of God is
[1:32:48] that you can respond to something
[1:32:50] without even necessarily fully
[1:32:52] understanding it there's you know David
[1:32:54] said the Deep calleth unto the Deep
[1:32:56] there's something in me that responds to
[1:32:58] what's coming over the pulpit there's
[1:33:00] something that I respond to when I read
[1:33:01] this word and even though I don't always
[1:33:03] get it all I say that's still me that's
[1:33:06] part of my Heritage that's what I
[1:33:08] believe and I might only have a part of
[1:33:10] it at times but yet it's something in me
[1:33:12] that holds on to it and says that's what
[1:33:13] I identify with that's me that's my
[1:33:15] Heritage that's my inheritance that's my
[1:33:18] DNA amen I didn't choose this he chose
[1:33:22] me and it's you know I am what I am by
[1:33:24] the grace of God but I respond to this
[1:33:28] amen it's our Supernatural DNA that's
[1:33:31] responding to this word and says that's
[1:33:33] me I didn't know it and now I do know it
[1:33:36] I know it in part but there's coming a
[1:33:38] day when I'll know it in fullness there
[1:33:39] won't be any Shadow there won't be any
[1:33:40] mirror in front of me and I'll
[1:33:42] understand what it's all
[1:33:44] about John one1 says this speaking of
[1:33:46] Christ he says he was in the world the
[1:33:49] world was made by him and the world knew
[1:33:50] him not he came unto his own Naturally
[1:33:53] Speaking he came to the children of
[1:33:55] Abraham naturally he came to the Natural
[1:33:57] bloodline it says and his own received
[1:33:59] him not but then it says but as many as
[1:34:02] received him this is a mixed group look
[1:34:04] around us we got a mixed group today we
[1:34:07] got people from all over Canada we got
[1:34:08] people from all over the world sitting
[1:34:10] in church today it's a mixed multitude
[1:34:13] why because we are talking about the
[1:34:15] Royal Seed of Abraham we're talking
[1:34:16] about the bloodline of Christ the
[1:34:18] supernatural spiritual race amen it says
[1:34:21] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:34:24] he power to become the sons of God even
[1:34:26] to them that believe on his name the
[1:34:28] power is in you to believe in the first
[1:34:30] place and then he fills you with power
[1:34:32] to become what was in there in the first
[1:34:34] place but you have to have something in
[1:34:36] there to even respond to it in order to
[1:34:39] become that thing you respond because
[1:34:42] you are you don't do not become because
[1:34:44] you respond but you respond because of
[1:34:46] what you are you're a son you're a
[1:34:47] daughter of God he says which were born
[1:34:51] not of blood nor of the will of the
[1:34:53] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[1:34:56] let me shorten that which were born of
[1:34:58] God that's how you were born that's how
[1:35:00] you come into this place that's how you
[1:35:02] come into this time that's how you come
[1:35:03] into this message that's how come you
[1:35:05] can receive what you hear and what you
[1:35:07] read is because you were born of God and
[1:35:09] that which is of god responds to God
[1:35:12] every single time like I said before
[1:35:14] David said deep calls unto the deep and
[1:35:16] you're deep and you're responding to
[1:35:18] your origin your Source of Life anden
[1:35:21] your father you hear that voice brother
[1:35:22] bam always uses the chicken in that was
[1:35:24] born in the eagle or the eagle that was
[1:35:26] born in the chicken pen and when he
[1:35:28] hears that eagle voice the first time he
[1:35:30] says that's me and though he can't Fly
[1:35:33] Like an Eagle yet though he doesn't know
[1:35:35] how an eagle eats yet he responds and he
[1:35:37] keeps working and working and working
[1:35:38] until he can fly out of that chicken pen
[1:35:40] and he starts to go up into the Heights
[1:35:41] and then he can really become the eagle
[1:35:43] that he was meant to be he always was an
[1:35:45] eagle but there's a day where he heard
[1:35:47] the voice amen but what brother Brown's
[1:35:49] saying with this this idea of godliness
[1:35:51] is is that we've got a choice of what to
[1:35:52] do with our sunship we've got a choice
[1:35:55] to do with being a daughter of God Amen
[1:35:56] I've got a choice in how I live my life
[1:35:59] I've got a choice on what I say what I
[1:36:00] look at what I watch How I spend my day
[1:36:03] who I spend it with all of these things
[1:36:05] are choices and like I said before like
[1:36:07] like like Paul would say in First
[1:36:09] Corinthians he said every man's work
[1:36:11] will be tried and it'll be Tried by
[1:36:13] fire I'm going to make it no matter what
[1:36:16] because I'm a Child of God I I cannot be
[1:36:19] lost Jesus said I'm thankful you've
[1:36:22] given me every one he says and I won't
[1:36:24] lose a single one okay I cannot be lost
[1:36:27] there's a that's a form of Eternal uh
[1:36:30] you know
[1:36:31] certainty but I can come with something
[1:36:34] or I can come alone and that's the
[1:36:36] choice we make as Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:39] God am I going to come alone or am I
[1:36:40] going to bring something we going to
[1:36:42] bring jewels in our Crown to lay at his
[1:36:44] feet are we going to bring
[1:36:48] souls are are we going to bring those
[1:36:50] that would have been lost at those would
[1:36:51] have been
[1:36:53] destroyed without us are we just going
[1:36:56] to walk in and say I'm so thankful for
[1:36:57] the grace of God here I am give me my
[1:37:00] eternal life
[1:37:01] no that's the choice we make every
[1:37:04] single day what are we going to do with
[1:37:05] this gift he's given us of what God
[1:37:07] inside of us of the nature of a son or
[1:37:10] daughter of
[1:37:12] God John 8 he said but he that sent me
[1:37:15] is with me the father ha had not left me
[1:37:18] alone for I do always those things that
[1:37:20] please
[1:37:21] him we look at jesus' life and we see
[1:37:24] the the the the big highs and we see the
[1:37:26] scriptures that says and they brought
[1:37:27] their their sick and their Halt and
[1:37:29] they're lame and they're blind and
[1:37:30] they're deaf and he healed them all and
[1:37:33] we think what a glorious time that must
[1:37:35] be and then we see the tiredness and The
[1:37:38] Agony and the abuse that Jesus went
[1:37:40] through people would use and abuse
[1:37:42] Jesus they come for the Loaves and the
[1:37:44] fishes they come for the signs and
[1:37:46] wonders they come for the this and that
[1:37:48] but when it really came down to it they
[1:37:49] used him they abused him and then and
[1:37:51] they killed him and Jesus said
[1:37:53] everything I do he said I do it because
[1:37:56] it pleases
[1:37:58] you so in the hard times in the worn out
[1:38:01] times in the painful times when he knew
[1:38:03] people were using him and yet he would
[1:38:05] do whatever the father told him to do
[1:38:08] that's what godliness looks like he says
[1:38:10] and as he spake these words many
[1:38:12] believed on him Christ literally died
[1:38:15] gave his life because that's what he was
[1:38:16] told to
[1:38:18] do that's what godliness looks like
[1:38:21] you'll do whatever he says then Jesus
[1:38:24] said to those Jews which believed on him
[1:38:27] if you continue in my word then are ye
[1:38:29] my disciples indeed I love that idea of
[1:38:32] continuing because what happens is we
[1:38:34] have an initial experience with God and
[1:38:36] we repent and we're baptized and there's
[1:38:38] that scouring out that happens that I
[1:38:40] hope most of us know and then there's
[1:38:42] something that works and now God takes
[1:38:43] us into a sanctification process and he
[1:38:46] starts to clean up our life and he
[1:38:47] starts to clean up our relationships and
[1:38:48] our intents and our desires and all
[1:38:50] these different things then there comes
[1:38:51] a point where he fills us with the Holy
[1:38:53] Spirit but he says you've got to
[1:38:54] continue no matter where you at you've
[1:38:56] got to continue don't rest on your
[1:38:58] laurels don't rest on your Revelation
[1:39:00] don't rest on your ministry don't rest
[1:39:02] on where you are but keep pressing
[1:39:04] toward the prize of the mark of the high
[1:39:05] calling in Christ Jesus because what
[1:39:07] happens if I could just get a little
[1:39:09] pastor this morning is we get
[1:39:11] comfortable in our
[1:39:13] maturity and we don't grow where we're
[1:39:17] immature so what does God do he changes
[1:39:20] our ministry
[1:39:21] he changes our relationships he changes
[1:39:24] our location he changes our job he
[1:39:27] changes our fellowship he changes our
[1:39:29] financial situation God moves us to a
[1:39:32] place where he can start to focus on our
[1:39:35] immaturity rather than resting on our
[1:39:38] maturity a Christian Life is
[1:39:40] uncomfortable because he's constantly
[1:39:42] growing and maturing his
[1:39:44] bride so what he's saying don't rest on
[1:39:47] your laurels remember they came to Jesus
[1:39:48] you know he gave them power over spirits
[1:39:51] and sicknesses and that and they came
[1:39:52] back rejoicing he said don't rejoice in
[1:39:54] that Rejoice that your names are in the
[1:39:55] Lamb's Book of Life why because Judas
[1:39:57] wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:39:59] yet he did all those things you can't
[1:40:01] rest on where you're at but you got to
[1:40:03] be thankful you got to be content for
[1:40:05] what he's given but you got to keep
[1:40:07] being willing to say Lord grow me change
[1:40:09] me mature me make me into the fullness
[1:40:11] of what you meant for me to be he says
[1:40:14] if you continue in my word then are you
[1:40:16] my disciples indeed I love how I can
[1:40:18] read a Bible you know I I I I cycle
[1:40:21] through the the four gospels in my
[1:40:22] devotions constantly I always read those
[1:40:24] over and over again and then I read a
[1:40:26] portion in the Old Testament and a
[1:40:27] portion further on in the New Testament
[1:40:29] but I love how you can sit there and you
[1:40:31] can read something you can underline it
[1:40:32] you can put a note in the margin and
[1:40:34] then you come read it three or four
[1:40:35] months later and you say how in the
[1:40:36] world did I not see that and it's
[1:40:38] something completely different why
[1:40:40] because we're continuing in the word we
[1:40:43] don't just say well I've read it I've
[1:40:44] underlined it I already know what that
[1:40:45] means so I must move on to the next one
[1:40:47] no it's constantly unfolding and it's
[1:40:49] unfolding so that it can unfold in your
[1:40:51] life not so it can just unfold in our
[1:40:53] minds in our heads or in our words
[1:40:55] amen he says ye shall know the truth and
[1:40:59] the truth shall make you free brother BR
[1:41:02] would would finish with this he only he
[1:41:04] only gave us five or six uh paragraphs
[1:41:07] on godliness in this message of stature
[1:41:08] of a perfect man he says perfect takes
[1:41:11] godliness but you know what godliness
[1:41:14] meant Godly always looking for one thing
[1:41:18] I always do that which pleases the
[1:41:21] father he says that's godliness why do
[1:41:23] we come to hear the word of the Lord why
[1:41:25] do we come to hear preaching in church
[1:41:26] why don't we just stay at home and and
[1:41:28] read our Bibles or listen to our
[1:41:30] messages or do these different things
[1:41:32] because brother Randon pointed us to
[1:41:34] Ephesians 4 he says God has placed God
[1:41:36] has ordained God has appointed God has
[1:41:38] anointed a variety of Ministries to help
[1:41:40] bring us to a place of perfection and
[1:41:42] it's literally the voice of God speaking
[1:41:43] I was listening to brother Bram speaking
[1:41:45] he says I'm the voice of God speaking he
[1:41:47] says now that offended some of you he
[1:41:49] says but you've got to recognize it's
[1:41:51] the voice of God speaking I'm not
[1:41:53] putting anything on myself by no means
[1:41:56] but I'm saying there's a place that God
[1:41:57] has ordained for each and every one of
[1:41:58] us to be fed the word of God Amen and
[1:42:02] when we come in there then we have what
[1:42:03] the effect of the washing of the water
[1:42:05] of the word and it cleans our life up
[1:42:07] and it puts us in our place amen this is
[1:42:09] a place where Perfection is put into the
[1:42:13] body that's what he's doing he's got a
[1:42:16] five-fold Ministry that is perfecting us
[1:42:18] that is edifying us that is unifying us
[1:42:20] it ought to be unifying us amen and
[1:42:23] they're anointed for your benefit not
[1:42:26] for theirs they're anointed for your
[1:42:28] edification not just for theirs amen
[1:42:30] they're a part of the body every
[1:42:31] minister is subject to the word of God
[1:42:33] and they get a benefit from the
[1:42:34] preaching of the word but it is for the
[1:42:36] entirety of the body that they're doing
[1:42:37] it amen God's chosen them as a means of
[1:42:40] bringing us to Perfection brother Ram
[1:42:42] says Perfection takes godliness
[1:42:45] Perfection is a reflection of godliness
[1:42:47] that's why we preach things that convict
[1:42:49] no Minister likes to preach on things
[1:42:51] that convict especially if we know it's
[1:42:52] in your
[1:42:54] life who wants that that's conflict but
[1:42:57] we do it why to get you to straighten up
[1:42:59] that's why we
[1:43:01] exhort to to get you to see what God is
[1:43:04] trying to do and what God wants us to do
[1:43:06] in our lives amen it's why we preach
[1:43:07] things that remind us of our position in
[1:43:09] Christ to elevate your thinking to
[1:43:12] elevate your desires to put you in a
[1:43:13] place where you start to think like God
[1:43:15] wants you to think that's why we do
[1:43:17] those things why we preach repentance to
[1:43:20] keep our lives clean to keep us from
[1:43:21] walking too far down a road that's going
[1:43:23] to take us to a place of pain or
[1:43:25] destruction or hurt or these different
[1:43:26] things amen it keeps us from following a
[1:43:29] path of our own choosing all of these
[1:43:31] things have to pre preached and it takes
[1:43:32] a different type of ministry to do
[1:43:33] certain ones of those amen but it keeps
[1:43:35] us moving into
[1:43:37] Perfection which is godliness amen let's
[1:43:41] stand together if we would the musicians
[1:43:42] can
[1:43:44] come you know I said that before Christ
[1:43:47] comes back he doesn't touch this this
[1:43:50] Earth
[1:43:51] we go to meet him in the clouds men the
[1:43:53] dead in Christ rise first and then we
[1:43:55] rise and we meet them in the air
[1:43:56] nobody's going to see Christ the only
[1:43:59] Christ they're going to see is in you
[1:44:00] and me the revealing of the word today
[1:44:02] if I could put it this way the only God
[1:44:04] they're going to see is in the last AG
[1:44:06] bride that's the only thing they're
[1:44:08] going to see is in you and I amen the
[1:44:10] world won't see him the only thing they
[1:44:11] can see is you and I and that's the only
[1:44:13] testimony they're going to get yes they
[1:44:15] can see signs and wonders they can see
[1:44:17] healings they can see these acts of God
[1:44:19] but dayto day walking down the Street
[1:44:21] Christ ain't doing it it's in you you're
[1:44:23] the only hope that they have Jesus said
[1:44:26] this in Matthew 5:14 he says ye are the
[1:44:28] light of the world you're the light of
[1:44:30] the world you're the light of the world
[1:44:32] each and every one of you is the light
[1:44:34] of the
[1:44:36] world how's your light looking these
[1:44:38] days can the world look at us and see do
[1:44:41] they know who we are amen do people know
[1:44:42] what you are if we got godl he says you
[1:44:45] can't you can't be hid people are going
[1:44:48] to know it they ought to know these
[1:44:50] things things as they look at us they
[1:44:52] ought to see the effect I mean we're in
[1:44:54] a Godless world I mean we're in a a
[1:44:57] world that's full of gods but not the
[1:44:58] true God if I could put it that way I
[1:45:00] mean you look at what people are
[1:45:01] worshiping they're worshiping music
[1:45:02] they're worship I mean it's insane it's
[1:45:05] insane when you stop and look at what
[1:45:07] the world is worshiping today music and
[1:45:10] movie stars and athletes and the things
[1:45:12] that go that people focus on and they're
[1:45:15] fanatical about it our our fitness our
[1:45:17] ambition our career uh whatever the
[1:45:21] world is is is absolutely led by so many
[1:45:24] things how do you know what's your God
[1:45:27] whatever you're serving whatever your
[1:45:29] purpose is for a day is your god and the
[1:45:32] world has so many different gods am me
[1:45:33] they have so many different things that
[1:45:34] they're worshiping but they ought to be
[1:45:36] able to see that we don't worship the
[1:45:37] things they worship that we don't live
[1:45:39] the way that they live they don't that
[1:45:41] we don't make decisions the way that we
[1:45:42] make decisions they ought to see the
[1:45:44] constancy of a gospel life in our lives
[1:45:47] amen that's what godliness looks like is
[1:45:49] we can catch the will of God by the word
[1:45:52] and we can go do it and we can be
[1:45:55] satisfied in it we can be happy in it we
[1:45:57] can be joy in it whether it feels good
[1:46:00] or whether it brings persecution and
[1:46:02] reproach we can be satisfied with what
[1:46:04] he's got for us amen first Peter says
[1:46:07] this ye are a chosen
[1:46:09] generation
[1:46:12] chosen not not happen stance you're
[1:46:15] chosen supernaturally chosen a royal
[1:46:19] priesthood I I I don't know if anybody's
[1:46:22] seen have you have you did you hear
[1:46:24] about the group of mountain bikers that
[1:46:25] ran into King Charles
[1:46:27] recently they were in the I think the
[1:46:29] Scottish Highland somewhere and they
[1:46:30] were mountain biking down a trail and
[1:46:33] they literally I mean they didn't
[1:46:34] literally run into him but they he was
[1:46:36] walking along the property and so they
[1:46:39] stopped to talk to him it was King
[1:46:41] Charles and you know what he was dressed
[1:46:44] with just a a cap on and kind of some
[1:46:46] some country clothes and whatnot and he
[1:46:48] had a stick in his hand but everything
[1:46:50] everything he did was
[1:46:51] kingly the way he talked the way he
[1:46:54] acted his approach his friendliness but
[1:46:56] yet his slight pullback as well he knew
[1:46:59] he was a king and he acted like a king
[1:47:01] no matter what he was wearing no matter
[1:47:03] the fact that they caught him out with
[1:47:04] mud on his boots in the middle of the
[1:47:05] country he acted like a king because he
[1:47:08] was a
[1:47:09] king his diction was perfect I loved
[1:47:12] listening to him talk because everything
[1:47:13] he said was absolutely perfect why he
[1:47:17] was a king he's been trained right he's
[1:47:18] been brought right brought up right
[1:47:21] scripture says we're Royal we've been
[1:47:23] brought upright we've been raised by a
[1:47:25] god we've been raised by a word that's
[1:47:27] perfect do our lives reflected he says a
[1:47:30] holy
[1:47:31] nation my wife was speaking to a woman
[1:47:33] recently and she said this woman has a a
[1:47:36] farm out in the country and my wife said
[1:47:37] you're living my dream and she looked at
[1:47:38] my wife she said you're living my dream
[1:47:40] she says you're modest she says I've
[1:47:43] always had a heart for modesty but I've
[1:47:45] never done it my wife you know she said
[1:47:47] to she said to I think someone yesterday
[1:47:49] she said it's not hard just put a skirt
[1:47:51] or dress
[1:47:52] on they're a holy
[1:47:55] nation we ought to live holy clean pure
[1:47:59] undefiled from the things of the world
[1:48:01] Amen he says you're a peculiar people
[1:48:04] now that one I think we all identify
[1:48:05] with real quickly don't we we're
[1:48:08] weird but be weird because you're holy
[1:48:11] not because you're weird remember I read
[1:48:13] that quote where brother Ram says don't
[1:48:14] be weird to be weird you know kind of
[1:48:17] putting it tightly he said don't be
[1:48:19] weird just to be weird don't be
[1:48:20] different for the sake of being
[1:48:21] different but be different because you
[1:48:23] live by the word of God you live
[1:48:24] according to the word of God he says
[1:48:27] what's the purpose that you should show
[1:48:28] forth the Praises of him that ha called
[1:48:31] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[1:48:33] Light one last scripture he says
[1:48:35] whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[1:48:42] all godl brings us to the place where we
[1:48:45] can say I did that and I can put Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ's name after what I just did said
[1:48:51] my reaction my action whatever it is I
[1:48:53] can put his name at the end not mine
[1:48:56] that's what we're talking
[1:48:57] about that I can say whatever I'm doing
[1:49:00] today whatever I'm doing now Jesus
[1:49:02] Christ is happy with it he says do all
[1:49:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[1:49:07] thanks to God and the father by him
[1:49:13] amen you say brother Jonathan I'm not
[1:49:16] there hey we're all
[1:49:18] growing I'm not saying because I've got
[1:49:20] it all either by no means amen but we're
[1:49:23] growing in maturity we ought to see a
[1:49:26] change day by day week by week month by
[1:49:28] month amen that God is calling us to a
[1:49:30] higher plane that God is calling us to a
[1:49:32] place where everything we do is by his
[1:49:36] Direction by his word by his inspiration
[1:49:39] that we can hold when he says hold and
[1:49:41] we can go when he says go and we're
[1:49:44] happy to do either one amen amen let's
[1:49:46] bow our heads each
[1:49:48] one Lord God
[1:49:52] Lord we sang at the beginning of this
[1:49:54] service Lord that when you are in the
[1:49:55] house Lord that's what makes the
[1:49:58] difference and Lord we're children of
[1:50:01] yours Lord you've given us the nature of
[1:50:04] a
[1:50:05] god of a holy God of a righteous God of
[1:50:09] a just God of a sacrificing God of a
[1:50:12] loving
[1:50:13] God lord I pray you help us to exhibit
[1:50:16] it Lord that day by day people would see
[1:50:19] us Lord Lord that in our words and in
[1:50:21] our actions Lord that we'd not be
[1:50:23] talkers only but that we'd be doers Lord
[1:50:25] of this word that we profess Lord this
[1:50:27] message that we've received Lord God
[1:50:30] lord may we be just living Lord fleshly
[1:50:32] tablets Lord that people could see your
[1:50:34] word written on day by day Lord may we
[1:50:38] seek your will seek the leadership of
[1:50:40] your Holy Spirit Lord God lord may we
[1:50:43] earnestly earnestly Lord wait on you to
[1:50:47] see what you would have us to do
[1:50:48] heavenly father but Lord help us to be
[1:50:50] quick to catch your voice Lord may we
[1:50:53] become just so as so so used to it Lord
[1:50:56] so associated with it Lord that we could
[1:50:59] block out anything that we hear Lord I
[1:51:01] pray your grace to us each one Lord let
[1:51:03] us catch your spirit Lord what is
[1:51:05] speaking to the church today Lord into
[1:51:07] our individual lives we ask in Jesus
[1:51:10] Christ's name we ask it
[1:51:13] amen you know many times when I'm in the
[1:51:15] gym I wear a head my headphones because
[1:51:17] they're always playing music that is
[1:51:19] unfit to listen listen to but you know
[1:51:21] what if I start to focus even through my
[1:51:24] headphones I can listen to that music I
[1:51:26] don't want to but sometimes as you move
[1:51:28] around you'll get right under a speaker
[1:51:30] and you'll say hey what was that I
[1:51:32] didn't notice that because I was far
[1:51:33] away and I didn't hear it but something
[1:51:35] brought me closer the equipment I was
[1:51:37] using and I start to hear something and
[1:51:40] you know what if I focus on it if it's a
[1:51:42] song maybe that I knew when I was still
[1:51:44] not serving the lord or whatnot I can
[1:51:46] focus on that and I can literally drown
[1:51:48] what's in my ear to catch what is
[1:51:51] outside but at the same time if I focus
[1:51:54] on what's in my ear it doesn't matter
[1:51:56] how loud they play it I can block it out
[1:51:57] to hear what what what's in my ear I
[1:52:01] choose what I focus on I choose the
[1:52:04] voice I choose the music that I'm
[1:52:06] listening to in every situation that's
[1:52:08] what we're talking about with godliness
