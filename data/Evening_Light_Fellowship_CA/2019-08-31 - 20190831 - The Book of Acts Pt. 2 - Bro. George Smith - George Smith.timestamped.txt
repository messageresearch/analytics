[46:42] the word certainly enjoyed it last night
[46:44] and had an anticipation waiting for the
[46:51] word tonight
[46:53] if the brothers said to me years ago and
[46:56] I did tell you that before and what no
[46:58] matter how he felt when he came to the
[47:00] door to church he always said it was a
[47:02] portion in here for me and I'm coming
[47:04] again

[48:42] [Music]
[48:56] amen
[48:57] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[49:00] order to thank you for your word we
[49:02] thank you for your spirit we thank you
[49:04] Lord for the desire to be in the house
[49:06] of the Lord and to learn more of your
[49:09] word as we struggle through dark
[49:12] Laodicea looking for the exit Lord we
[49:15] just pray that you would open your eyes
[49:17] to see the truth of the word or not just
[49:20] to memorize but to know you by the
[49:21] spirit and the leading and the truth
[49:25] Lord we thank you for this little song
[49:28] that is taken from Mary's words when the
[49:32] angel appeared to her Lord as the angel
[49:35] comes by now and opens the eyes of your
[49:37] people tonight may it be our prayer be
[49:41] it unto me according to thy word
[49:43] whatever you have for me for each one of
[49:46] your people here tonight
[49:47] may it be real may this be a turning
[49:50] point for each one open your word to us
[49:53] now and bless your people that are out
[49:55] there watching somewhere these words be
[49:58] a blessing to many we ask in Jesus name
[50:00] Amen you may be seated I was very happy
[50:08] to hear the beautiful music and you will
[50:13] find me a recording of that song won't
[50:14] you okay so we finished chapter 5 last
[50:19] night for those of you that were paying
[50:23] attention and we're going into chapter 6
[50:28] now see how far we can get and we have
[50:31] one more service and we will not get
[50:33] through 28 chapters but we will take it
[50:37] easy so that people can digest as we go
[50:39] along so chapter 6 of the book of Acts
[50:43] verse 1 and in those days when the
[50:46] number of the disciples was multiplied
[50:48] there arose a murmuring of the Grecians
[50:51] against the Hebrews because their widows
[50:54] were neglected in the daily ministration
[50:56] well they were just like us weren't they
[50:58] had a few church problems
[51:01] and so the disputes came up among the
[51:03] people about some of the widows not
[51:06] receiving proper attention there were
[51:09] the native-born Jews and then there was
[51:12] the Jews that emigrated from other
[51:13] countries such as Greece and the widows
[51:17] in particular dependent on assistance
[51:19] from the local church
[51:20] so the Apostles had to institute church
[51:23] order some practical ideas for current
[51:27] situations help was needed
[51:29] now these assistance to the ministry as
[51:32] we'll read here in verse 3 in a minute
[51:34] they had to have certain qualification
[51:36] it couldn't be the first three people
[51:37] couldn't be whoever paid the most tides
[51:39] it had to be people they said seven
[51:42] amongst you of honest report okay no
[51:45] flaws follow the Holy Ghost and wisdom
[51:49] whom we may appoint over this business
[51:51] because the Apostles didn't have time to
[51:54] be you know serving the tables oh I'm
[51:57] sorry sister you didn't get enough this
[51:58] month and all that stuff somebody had to
[52:00] take care of that and so their first
[52:05] assignment was Social Work something
[52:10] that was commonly left to the women to
[52:12] do that is serving the meals cleaning up
[52:16] the mess after the meals vacuumed in the
[52:18] church
[52:19] dusting their organ and all the things
[52:20] that have to be done they needed help to
[52:24] do these things and so some of these
[52:26] brothers graduated on to more actively
[52:30] you know Ministry of the word now you
[52:32] got to remember that this this group of
[52:35] Christians these weren't even called
[52:36] Christians yet these these believers
[52:38] this was growing very rapidly if you
[52:42] remember back in chapter 1 to verse 15
[52:43] there was 120 hiding in the upper room
[52:46] they didn't know how long then it was
[52:48] ten days Abraham said Sarah didn't
[52:51] notice 25 years they just waited until
[52:54] but God had it all planned out because
[52:57] he had these other all these other
[52:58] thousands of people gathered in
[52:59] Jerusalem at the same time and this had
[53:01] to overlap and coming at the same time
[53:03] you know so here's 120 right waiting up
[53:08] there in verse 8 of
[53:13] the chapter one he had told him to wait
[53:15] in Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost you
[53:18] know comes upon you you shall be
[53:20] witnesses unto me in Jerusalem out there
[53:22] in Judea over to Samaria to the
[53:24] uttermost part of the earth they they
[53:25] didn't have a globe at home to know what
[53:27] the earth looked like okay they hadn't
[53:29] been invented yet
[53:29] the global world might have been 300
[53:31] miles in every direction so when he says
[53:34] the other most part of the earth they
[53:36] had no idea what he was talking about
[53:37] but when we get to chapter 2 and verse 8
[53:40] here's all these people in Jerusalem and
[53:43] it says how hear we every man in our own
[53:47] tongue wherein we were born so these
[53:49] Jews had come from all these countries
[53:51] in the 16 listed there that might have
[53:53] been more and they're born over there so
[53:56] they knew Hebrew because of the church
[53:58] and because the Scriptures are in Hebrew
[54:00] but they were born in those countries
[54:01] and they spoke those other languages now
[54:04] for the first time they're in Jerusalem
[54:06] that their date their yearly pilgrimage
[54:08] and they're hearing these Hicks speak
[54:11] their language yeah
[54:13] verse 11 of chapter 2 rabe Eunice's so
[54:18] forth do we hear them speak in our
[54:19] tongues and wonderful works of God and
[54:22] they were all amazed and we're in doubt
[54:24] and saying to one another what meaneth
[54:26] this and so they notice that they were
[54:29] they had a Galilean accent that's like
[54:34] the people that come from
[54:35] you know BC or someplace they have a
[54:36] different accent you know immediately
[54:37] and so here they're speaking their
[54:40] language with that accent well so as we
[54:44] saw yesterday there was three thousand
[54:46] heard the gospel in their own language
[54:49] they were baptized and they took the
[54:54] gospel home with them so now verse 8 of
[54:57] chapter one is beginning to have some
[55:00] effect that here's the reality
[55:02] they're taking it out there it's not
[55:04] these 12 or 11 disciples that's going to
[55:06] be in charge of it all but God
[55:09] immediately has these other guys taking
[55:12] it home so starting to go to all these
[55:15] other countries all of a sudden well
[55:19] they they were empowered you know and so
[55:23] then in verse 47 of chapter 2 added the
[55:25] church daily such as should be saved
[55:27] there's predestination and in chapter 4
[55:30] verse 4 about 5000 men so there could
[55:33] have been up to 20,000 added that day so
[55:35] this thing's growing you know in chapter
[55:38] 6 verse 7 we read tonight and the Word
[55:40] of God increased and the number of the
[55:42] disciples multiplied now those of you
[55:45] that know anything about math you know 1
[55:46] plus 1 equals 2 but when it multiplies
[55:49] it could really go fast you know
[55:53] multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ok and a
[55:57] great company of the priests were
[55:58] obedient to the faith well yeah these
[56:01] priests you know a very few people could
[56:04] read back then the priests for some of
[56:06] them they could so they had read the
[56:07] scriptures and so they had it memorized
[56:10] they knew what the scripture said but
[56:11] here's is coming to Pastner in their
[56:13] lifetime
[56:14] Wow so they believed you know it's being
[56:16] manifested so verse 8 and Stephen full
[56:21] of faith and power did great wonders and
[56:23] miracles among the people okay so
[56:26] Stephen is one of the seven from verse
[56:28] five and a man of full of faith Holy
[56:33] Ghost power
[56:33] he had a great Ministry of wonders
[56:35] miracles amongst the people and he
[56:38] became the first Christian martyr okay
[56:40] so as we have been taught every revival
[56:43] produces twins right and most of the
[56:47] believers they love Stephen and they saw
[56:50] that he was used of God to minister the
[56:52] word in miracles and so forth but there
[56:56] were certain people we call them make
[56:57] believers today that they thought it was
[57:00] their mission to argue with the man of
[57:02] God uh-huh and when they couldn't out
[57:06] argue him that's right their verse 10
[57:08] when they were not able to resist the
[57:11] wisdom and the spirit about which he
[57:13] spake what they do they suborn that
[57:15] means they paid money they paid cash
[57:18] money to false witnesses and said now
[57:23] you tell me here's what you're going to
[57:24] say after we give you this money we have
[57:26] heard him speak blasphemous words
[57:27] against Moses and against God you know
[57:30] money always works doesn't him there it
[57:32] is
[57:32] right there right there in the Holy
[57:34] Bible put money under the table and I go
[57:36] say this well so based on these
[57:40] allegations that
[57:41] flying around the religious police come
[57:43] along they grabbed him brought him
[57:45] before the Religious Council and those
[57:48] guys also had false witnesses says right
[57:51] there and they were bringing confusing a
[57:53] lot of accusations and how do they do
[57:56] that by repeating miss quotations little
[57:59] pieces of the message but in the wrong
[58:01] order misplaced out of harmony so let's
[58:04] look at verse 13 they set up witnesses
[58:07] and he said this man ceases not to speak
[58:09] blasphemous words against the holy place
[58:11] and the law and we have heard him say
[58:15] that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
[58:18] destroy this place and shall change the
[58:20] customs which Moses delivered to us
[58:22] that's pretty serious the gods man was
[58:25] confident you know and all that said in
[58:28] the council look steadfastly on Stephen
[58:30] and his face was like the face of an
[58:33] angel
[58:35] well everybody should have been on their
[58:37] knees right there
[58:38] but they were full of religious hatred
[58:42] they knew their prophets words perfectly
[58:45] and you got to say it our way or you're
[58:46] not you're out of here you go into the
[58:47] hot place you know and they're just you
[58:51] know full of it so that's the end of
[58:54] chapter six fifteen verses so chapter 7
[58:57] verse 1 then said the high priest
[59:00] Stephen are these things so here's the
[59:03] microphone it's your turn well from
[59:06] there Stephen launches out into the deep
[59:08] waters it was God's Way of refocusing
[59:12] the people's attention away from
[59:14] Jerusalem see to the world at large
[59:17] it gives an eloquent history lesson from
[59:20] verse 2 all the way through verse 50
[59:22] which we're not going to read right now
[59:23] but he makes four major points verses 2
[59:27] through 8 is the founding of the Hebrew
[59:28] nation did not occur here in Jerusalem
[59:30] out there far away in Mesopotamia all
[59:34] about father Abraham then verse 9
[59:36] through 37 it's all about the patriarchs
[59:39] and Moses the liberation of God's people
[59:42] didn't occur here in Jerusalem far away
[59:45] Egypt the Red Sea all about the signing
[59:48] I 0.3 was 38 through 39 was all about
[59:53] the law was
[59:54] given here in Jerusalem out there in the
[59:57] desert and then 39 through 50 it was all
[1:00:00] about the idolatry that the Hebrews had
[1:00:05] out there in the desert and then the
[1:00:07] building of the temple where it says
[1:00:10] that God does not live in a temple on a
[1:00:12] physical building but then we go
[1:00:14] starting at 51
[1:00:16] can you look at your Bible while I read
[1:00:18] out of this other one here says oh you
[1:00:20] stubborn an insincere in heart and
[1:00:22] hearing you always resist the Holy
[1:00:25] Spirit as your father's did so do you
[1:00:27] which of the prophets have not your
[1:00:30] father's persecuted and murdered
[1:00:31] especially have they slained those who
[1:00:34] foretold the coming of the righteous one
[1:00:36] whom you betrayed and murdered well he
[1:00:39] just give him the microphone they're
[1:00:41] gonna let go you know you received the
[1:00:44] law by dispensation of angels and kept
[1:00:46] not it he kept it not when they heard
[1:00:49] these things they were enraged and
[1:00:51] gnashed her teeth and we're gonna get
[1:00:53] this guy they were mad you know really
[1:00:57] mad you see and so this this view of
[1:01:00] history by revelation brought to a real
[1:01:03] raging boil the growing conflict between
[1:01:06] the new religious movement and the city
[1:01:08] fathers see and we go on but he full of
[1:01:14] faith in and the full of faith and Holy
[1:01:16] Spirit looked up to heaven and saw the
[1:01:19] glory of God and Jesus standing at the
[1:01:21] right hand of God and he said behold I
[1:01:23] see the heavens open and the Son of man
[1:01:26] standing at the right hand of God
[1:01:28] then they crowd with a loud voice and
[1:01:31] stopped their ears with one Accord
[1:01:33] shouted threats against Stephen you know
[1:01:35] name-calling and all the stuff that goes
[1:01:37] on and they seized them and then took
[1:01:40] him outside the city and began to stone
[1:01:41] him and those who testified against him
[1:01:44] place their clothes under the care of a
[1:01:47] young man called Saul and they stone
[1:01:49] Stephen as he prayed saying our Lord
[1:01:53] Jesus except my spirit and as he knelt
[1:01:57] down he cried with a loud voice and said
[1:01:58] our Lord do not hold this sin against
[1:02:01] them when he had that said he passed
[1:02:04] away
[1:02:05] very very serious situation there and
[1:02:10] these weren't little rocks these four
[1:02:12] big sharp rocks they're throwing okay
[1:02:14] they had professional stone throwers now
[1:02:18] what Saul Saul right there never left
[1:02:22] his mind it was stamped in his mind and
[1:02:25] that's why I over there Jerusalem they
[1:02:27] got st. Stephen's Gate where they took
[1:02:28] him out they stoned him right there
[1:02:30] and that's where it happened now and we
[1:02:33] have the first mention here of Saul and
[1:02:35] he witnessed the death of Stephen he was
[1:02:39] probably too young to participate but he
[1:02:42] was a Pharisee in training and what he
[1:02:44] saw he never forgot it now he did
[1:02:48] probably didn't throw any rocks you know
[1:02:50] they were sharp rocks but he was one of
[1:02:52] the persecutors okay he was one of the
[1:02:55] many that hated the manifestation of
[1:02:58] God's Word in present tense they could
[1:03:03] repeat it perfectly they didn't have an
[1:03:04] iPad they didn't have nothing they read
[1:03:06] it and memorized it you know and then
[1:03:09] what and their their Hebrew Bible they
[1:03:11] have today is the same text that they
[1:03:13] had back then the same writing has come
[1:03:15] all the way down so they knew the word
[1:03:17] perfectly you know historical it's fine
[1:03:20] to quote it it's but what about the
[1:03:22] manifestation of the truth you know you
[1:03:25] have pets and you feed them special food
[1:03:26] so that the hair will be nice and all
[1:03:28] that there's gonna be a manifestation we
[1:03:31] are what we eat you know so here here
[1:03:34] they are memorizing the word they
[1:03:36] couldn't handle a manifestation and we
[1:03:39] hear it today say what he says oh you're
[1:03:41] on I got it I heard of things too in 50
[1:03:44] years so we're gonna stay balanced you
[1:03:47] see so now these Pharisees they were the
[1:03:51] religious elite of Judaism the people
[1:03:53] that did believe the resurrection
[1:03:55] supernatural but they were very
[1:03:57] self-righteous there's probably nobody
[1:03:59] like that in Newfoundland but down where
[1:04:01] I live there's a lot of self-righteous
[1:04:02] people you know and they were the only
[1:04:05] ones that were really right it's okay
[1:04:07] yeah you can quote what you want to it I
[1:04:09] know I'm right you know and revelation
[1:04:11] was the last thing on their mind
[1:04:13] everything had to be letter-perfect
[1:04:15] every word of Moses today we
[1:04:18] legalists with zero revelation the
[1:04:23] Sadducees were also important religious
[1:04:24] people they denied the supernatural
[1:04:26] denied angels especially the
[1:04:28] resurrection they were the religious
[1:04:30] rationalist of the time they reasoned to
[1:04:34] rationalize and so here's where the
[1:04:36] fourth persecution began chapter 8 and
[1:04:40] verse 1 see care and Saul was consenting
[1:04:45] unto his death at that time there was a
[1:04:48] great persecution against the church was
[1:04:50] in Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:04:52] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[1:04:54] and Samaria except the Apostles okay so
[1:04:59] with each persecution God's plan from
[1:05:03] chapter 1 and verse 8 was coming into
[1:05:05] sharper focus now this is about 31 ad
[1:05:07] here and everybody still huddled around
[1:05:11] Jerusalem but it took persecution to
[1:05:14] drive people out you know they would
[1:05:17] somewhere else to raise their family you
[1:05:18] know where it's not sort of so dangerous
[1:05:22] and so the gospel is leaving Jerusalem
[1:05:24] and it was all part of the larger
[1:05:27] picture that God already saw happening
[1:05:29] but persecution had to drive him out
[1:05:32] they didn't go there voluntarily
[1:05:33] you know so Pharisee saw he's one of the
[1:05:37] main troublemakers one of the
[1:05:39] instigators bringing persecution against
[1:05:42] the early church verse 3 as for Saul he
[1:05:45] made havoc of the church entering into
[1:05:47] every house and hailing men and women
[1:05:50] committed to them to prison that means
[1:05:51] he's not Haley means taking him prisoner
[1:05:54] and so his own confession is over here
[1:05:59] in Galatians chapter 1 he didn't hide
[1:06:03] anything Galatians 1 and verse 13 where
[1:06:08] he says here for you have heard of my
[1:06:11] conversation my lifestyle in time past
[1:06:14] in the Jews religion how that beyond
[1:06:17] measure I persecuted the Church of God
[1:06:19] and I wasted it and profited in the Jews
[1:06:22] religion above many my equals in my own
[1:06:25] nation being more exceedingly zealous of
[1:06:28] the traditions of our fathers so where
[1:06:31] it says here in verse
[1:06:32] of chapter 8 that he made havoc that
[1:06:34] means he brought trouble he brought
[1:06:36] confusion and guess what our God is not
[1:06:39] the author of confusion when you see
[1:06:42] something confusing coming up in our
[1:06:44] message today it's not of God
[1:06:46] just take a sharp right or left get away
[1:06:49] from it you see don't argue with them
[1:06:52] don't go on the internet think you're
[1:06:53] going to help those people
[1:06:54] they chose a path and it's one way
[1:06:57] they're not coming back forget it
[1:06:59] see after the death of Judas Iscariot
[1:07:01] the church leaders chose a brother by
[1:07:04] the name of Matthias and he's probably a
[1:07:07] good believer probably didn't ever do
[1:07:09] anything wrong but we never heard of him
[1:07:11] again
[1:07:11] that wasn't God's choice that was those
[1:07:13] guys they got together and chose him
[1:07:15] God's choosing on the other hand was a
[1:07:18] very short hook-nosed sarcastic
[1:07:22] short-tempered Jew yeah we've-- and his
[1:07:28] name was Saul and he's the one who's
[1:07:32] dragging these converts into court and
[1:07:34] jail and watching them be punished put
[1:07:36] to death now there's a movie that
[1:07:39] Hollywood found out last year paul the
[1:07:42] apostle of Jesus Christ it shows these
[1:07:44] very things it's very accurate very good
[1:07:47] and so these were people just like us
[1:07:50] they were just worshipping God in their
[1:07:52] home but if he came house to house and
[1:07:55] he saw a little cross or some little
[1:07:56] fish or some sign of of Christianity
[1:08:00] don't ask questions they didn't mind
[1:08:01] profiling ask questions you're going out
[1:08:04] of here you know so these things are
[1:08:08] still happening today and plus some
[1:08:10] places but later when he's converted God
[1:08:14] used him in a marvelous way even to be
[1:08:16] responsible for a large portion of the
[1:08:19] New Testament Scriptures much later when
[1:08:21] he's you know preaching the word openly
[1:08:23] but he was accused falsely he confessed
[1:08:27] to the authorities this I confess to you
[1:08:29] all that after the way which they call
[1:08:30] heresy that's the way I worship the God
[1:08:33] of my father's which was the god of
[1:08:35] their fathers too maybe believing all
[1:08:37] things which were written in the law and
[1:08:39] the prophets that could be our
[1:08:41] confession we you know what sets us
[1:08:44] apart from the Church of England in
[1:08:45] church
[1:08:45] whatever are down the road we believe
[1:08:47] all that's written in the law and the
[1:08:49] prophets we believe the whole scripture
[1:08:51] you know
[1:08:52] so we'll see more about Paul a little
[1:08:55] later
[1:08:55] now these early believers could have
[1:08:58] chosen the way of compromise they could
[1:09:00] have chosen an easier path a path or no
[1:09:02] resistance no criticism a path of
[1:09:05] compromise holding hands with the
[1:09:07] religious leaders that okay well we'll
[1:09:09] settle down here we'll do it your way
[1:09:12] you know trying to get along by
[1:09:14] fellowship but it that's not God's
[1:09:16] weight Martin Luther said Christ alone
[1:09:20] we don't need the beads we don't need
[1:09:22] all this nonsense
[1:09:23] we just need Christ alone you know so
[1:09:26] you know used to be that when you wanted
[1:09:29] to go somewhere you had a map book
[1:09:31] everybody over 45 remembers the map book
[1:09:34] right brother yeah but it's an
[1:09:36] alphabetical order you know so when you
[1:09:39] want to go somewhere you got to flip
[1:09:43] through the pages to make your way you
[1:09:45] know and but God's map is all on one
[1:09:47] page he's not flipping through the book
[1:09:49] you see from beginning the end he knows
[1:09:51] the whole thing he knows the details of
[1:09:53] every individual life all the little
[1:09:56] details what you're gonna wear tomorrow
[1:09:58] or we're gonna have four separate Ammar
[1:09:59] tonight Lord willing and all these
[1:10:01] details he already knows all this stuff
[1:10:03] you see and so you're only gonna be at
[1:10:07] peace when you get it all figured out
[1:10:09] no when you trust him yes Lord you you
[1:10:13] know you I give you full control you
[1:10:16] lead you be the guide I'll be still and
[1:10:20] I'll follow that's the only way you're
[1:10:22] gonna have peace so verse four therefore
[1:10:28] they were scattered abroad and went
[1:10:30] everywhere preaching the word now see in
[1:10:33] our way of understanding war they were
[1:10:34] all preachers no not necessarily no
[1:10:38] Francis of Assisi said nine hundred
[1:10:41] years ago preach always use words when
[1:10:45] necessary oh man we don't want to we
[1:10:48] want to let go you don't tell people no
[1:10:50] a lot of times it's better to just be
[1:10:51] still do it the Bible says be still I'm
[1:10:55] God don't need your opinions I'll take
[1:10:57] care of it you see so they went
[1:10:59] everywhere
[1:10:59] living their message you see so these
[1:11:03] first missionaries or they traveled far
[1:11:06] away oh yeah see in the in Matthew
[1:11:08] chapter 10 Jesus told them only go to
[1:11:11] the house of Israel don't worry about
[1:11:12] all this other people take care of them
[1:11:14] later only go to Israel so when they
[1:11:17] start moving away they located you know
[1:11:20] in Jewish communities for example
[1:11:22] Phoenicia which is Lebanon today that's
[1:11:25] 120 miles north of Jerusalem they sail
[1:11:27] all the way over to Cyprus that's 150
[1:11:29] miles they went up to Antioch which is
[1:11:32] part of Turkey today that's 300 miles
[1:11:34] and so they took off not all of them but
[1:11:38] you know they would they left and the
[1:11:41] apostles are still in Jerusalem so now
[1:11:43] in verse 5 we have the man named Philip
[1:11:46] and he went to a city in from area at
[1:11:48] Samaria which is about 50 miles north of
[1:11:52] Jerusalem now there was this Philip here
[1:11:56] is one of the helpers of chapter 6 and
[1:11:58] verse 5 along with Stephen the Apostle
[1:12:01] Philip that's in Matthew 10 that he's a
[1:12:03] different one and he's having a great
[1:12:05] revival up here in Samaria many people
[1:12:08] are healed there's great joy but there's
[1:12:11] the twins again you can always count on
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:14] in this meeting there was a man by the
[1:12:16] name of Simon the sorcerer that's like a
[1:12:18] magician he's been working from the dark
[1:12:20] side and he had some kind of reasonable
[1:12:23] success with his magic and so forth and
[1:12:27] he was very involved in the occult and
[1:12:29] the verse 9 of chapter 8 what do we have
[1:12:32] here Simon okay sorcery bewitched the
[1:12:38] people of Samaria giving out that he
[1:12:41] himself was some great one in other
[1:12:43] words false advertising I'm really
[1:12:45] important well so this man was obsessed
[1:12:49] with power and self-importance you know
[1:12:53] and the people were you know blown away
[1:12:56] oh this man is the great power of God
[1:12:58] and he had many followers no one seemed
[1:13:02] to criticize him they marveled and
[1:13:05] suppose though you know there's great
[1:13:06] importance but God was not in the
[1:13:08] picture you see and so when the people
[1:13:11] now heard
[1:13:13] gospel down here this tent meeting with
[1:13:14] with Philip in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] there were signs and wonders many
[1:13:19] believed and were baptized even Simon
[1:13:22] himself you know he looked like he was a
[1:13:24] believer in verse 16 here okay so he's
[1:13:30] he's a believer and so then they called
[1:13:32] for Peter and John to come down and pray
[1:13:34] for the people that might receive the
[1:13:35] Holy Ghost verse 16 for as yet he was
[1:13:38] fallen on none of them only they had
[1:13:39] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:13:43] Jesus they laid their hands on them and
[1:13:46] they received the Holy Ghost and when
[1:13:48] Simon saw that through the laying on
[1:13:50] hands of the Apostles the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:53] given he offered them money oh there we
[1:13:56] are again with the money yeah you know
[1:13:59] he he want to be part of this program
[1:14:01] and he he offered money so you know
[1:14:07] maybe I can buy this magic trick you
[1:14:08] know and in verse 19 they said give me
[1:14:14] this power
[1:14:14] whosoever I laid my hands they could
[1:14:16] have the Holy Ghost - in other words I
[1:14:18] can help you guys you know of course
[1:14:20] this ministry probably wouldn't be for
[1:14:22] free I'd be the problem and so he heard
[1:14:25] the truth he want to be a part of the
[1:14:27] move of God but just couldn't detach
[1:14:29] himself from old Simon see let the old
[1:14:32] Simon die and yield himself to Jesus
[1:14:35] Christ so God used an anointed preacher
[1:14:38] preaching the gospel to shake him to
[1:14:41] reality here in verse 20
[1:14:42] Peter said thy money perish with thee we
[1:14:46] don't need your cash he said because
[1:14:47] thou has thought that the gift of God
[1:14:50] could be purchased with money
[1:14:52] thou has neither part nor nor a lot in
[1:14:56] this matter for thy heart is not right
[1:14:58] in the sight of God repent of this your
[1:15:01] sin and pray that God perhaps will take
[1:15:05] away the thought of thy heart and
[1:15:06] forgive thee so he discerned this case
[1:15:09] very well and course he immediately
[1:15:12] asked for prayer in verse 24 and we
[1:15:14] don't hear any more about him
[1:15:15] so we trust we'll see him someday we
[1:15:18] don't know so right in the midst of this
[1:15:20] great revival in Samaria the ends of the
[1:15:24] Lord appears to Philip
[1:15:26] in verse 26 and he says arise and go
[1:15:29] towards the south unto the way that goes
[1:15:30] down from Jerusalem to Gaza which is
[1:15:33] desert okay so those names are in the
[1:15:35] news all the time and they're still
[1:15:37] there and this is about seventy miles
[1:15:39] away from where he's preaching go down
[1:15:41] there and it's all desert you know he
[1:15:46] didn't explain anything
[1:15:47] and that's choir what just get up and go
[1:15:50] so like brother Brent says God doesn't
[1:15:53] always tell his prophets everything no
[1:15:55] but he does arrange the details so in
[1:15:58] verse 27 we have a very important man
[1:16:00] he's he's a believer in the Hebrew
[1:16:03] religion he's a black man he's unmarried
[1:16:06] he's officer of the royal household
[1:16:09] actually he's the treasurer of the
[1:16:10] kingdom of Ethiopia so how that happened
[1:16:14] well because a long time ago when the
[1:16:16] queen of the south queen of sheba come
[1:16:18] up to visit solomon she became a
[1:16:21] believer and she took the hebrew
[1:16:23] religion back with her and here's
[1:16:25] results of it here this man had this
[1:16:27] important treasure of the kingdom had
[1:16:29] been up to Jerusalem to worship he's on
[1:16:31] his way back and today they're still
[1:16:33] hebrew believers in ethiopia and they
[1:16:38] found out about him a few years ago and
[1:16:39] they let him into israel you worship
[1:16:41] just like us you worship our God so now
[1:16:43] we have these black Ethiopian Hebrew
[1:16:47] believers in Jerusalem so anyway he's
[1:16:51] riding along and he's reading what would
[1:16:53] be a spoken word book he's reading a
[1:16:55] prophetic manuscript okay he's just
[1:16:57] going along in his chariot and all of a
[1:17:00] sudden here's Philip he's walking along
[1:17:02] beside the running along beside the
[1:17:04] chariot not questioning God said go so
[1:17:07] here he is and verse 29 he runs up
[1:17:09] alongside the chariot and he heard the
[1:17:11] man reading you know and he said hi how
[1:17:14] are you do you understand what you're
[1:17:16] reading
[1:17:18] we're paraphrasing a little bit verse 31
[1:17:21] how can i except some man should guide
[1:17:23] me and he started philip that he should
[1:17:26] come and sit with him hmm so evangelist
[1:17:29] philip is now riding along with this
[1:17:33] important government official nice chair
[1:17:35] you know all the other everything and
[1:17:37] the man is reading the prophetic
[1:17:39] manuscript
[1:17:39] as I have chapter 53 where it says here
[1:17:43] the place where he was reading he was
[1:17:45] led as a sheep to the slaughter and I
[1:17:47] don't like a lamb done before his
[1:17:48] Shearer's he opened not his mouth
[1:17:50] in his humiliation his judgment was
[1:17:52] taken away and who shall declare his
[1:17:54] generation for his life is taken from
[1:17:57] the earth and as a person that's new to
[1:18:00] these things he asked in 34 so the
[1:18:03] eunuch answered Philips I pray thee of
[1:18:06] whom is the prophet speaking himself or
[1:18:08] some other man
[1:18:09] so the Evangelist never missing an
[1:18:12] opportunity started right at that point
[1:18:14] and preached Jesus Christ to the man and
[1:18:18] obviously they got as far as water
[1:18:20] baptism because all of a sudden the man
[1:18:22] says open here in verse 37 in 36 here's
[1:18:29] water you know can I be baptized and
[1:18:31] Philip said if you believe with all your
[1:18:32] heart it's okay and he said I believe
[1:18:36] that Jesus Christ is the son of God and
[1:18:38] he commanded the chariot to stand still
[1:18:41] and they both went down into the water
[1:18:43] well Philip and the eunuch and he
[1:18:45] baptized him and when they were come up
[1:18:50] out of the water the Spirit of God
[1:18:52] caught away Philip and the eunuch saw
[1:18:54] him no more he just pooped disappeared
[1:18:56] and he went on as the way to Ethiopia
[1:18:59] rejoicing but Philip was found at Esso
[1:19:03] Taurus asoto sotas passing through he
[1:19:06] preached in all the cities till he came
[1:19:08] to Caesarea so this unnamed government
[1:19:12] official was the first African convert
[1:19:15] and the gospel was moving out of
[1:19:18] Jerusalem
[1:19:19] so this obedient evangelist experienced
[1:19:24] time travel he baptized the first
[1:19:28] African and he preached the three ethnic
[1:19:30] groups and one day straight their house
[1:19:34] did he get down there I had no chest had
[1:19:36] no fast cars
[1:19:37] boom almost said he's walking beside
[1:19:38] this chariot so he was led of the Spirit
[1:19:43] and God has taken care of the details
[1:19:45] okay we'll have questions and answers
[1:19:48] maybe tomorrow but it's all in your
[1:19:50] Bible
[1:19:52] moving on to chapter 9 verse 1 and 2 and
[1:19:56] saw yet breathing out threatenings and
[1:19:58] slaughter against the disciples of the
[1:20:01] Lord went unto the high priest and
[1:20:03] desired of him letters to Damascus to
[1:20:06] the synagogue's
[1:20:07] and if be found any of this way whether
[1:20:10] they were men or women didn't matter he
[1:20:12] might bring them bound back to Jerusalem
[1:20:14] so saul is a young fiery Pharisee
[1:20:19] legalist filled with hatred and murder
[1:20:22] against the disciples of our Lord
[1:20:24] why not because they're evil people but
[1:20:27] because we know exactly what the Prophet
[1:20:29] said and you guys are you know making
[1:20:32] this up we don't like the manifestation
[1:20:34] that we see in you people so we're gonna
[1:20:35] kill all of you and set this thing back
[1:20:37] the way it's supposed to be that's what
[1:20:39] the kind of their orders so he was out
[1:20:41] persecuting all the believers didn't
[1:20:43] matter who they were they were our
[1:20:44] brothers and sisters could have been
[1:20:45] children anybody that even looked like
[1:20:47] part of the way you know I'm the way the
[1:20:49] truth of life they took him away that
[1:20:53] was this that was his job and he was the
[1:20:54] best at what he was doing so he didn't
[1:20:58] wait for orders he begged for warrants
[1:21:00] you know anyone faintly associated the
[1:21:03] way will be brought back to headquarters
[1:21:05] and so the believers travelled far away
[1:21:08] seeking more peaceful surroundings this
[1:21:11] is possibly four years after the
[1:21:12] resurrection and God allowed this
[1:21:15] persecution of the believers in order
[1:21:17] they would scattered far and wide to
[1:21:18] bring more fulfillment to chapter 1
[1:21:20] verse 8 to the end of the earth somebody
[1:21:23] had to take it he didn't come here to
[1:21:25] parachute the boat showed up here one
[1:21:28] day that's why it's called Conception
[1:21:30] Bay that's a Catholic word concept' the
[1:21:32] holy conception of Jesus Christ and Mary
[1:21:34] you know it's all together so you may
[1:21:37] not understand how God it's going to do
[1:21:39] something it's not your job the visions
[1:21:41] were William branham's rages they're not
[1:21:43] yours
[1:21:43] however God wants to put it together
[1:21:45] that's his business you see and so just
[1:21:49] remember that the scripture says be
[1:21:52] still I'm God I got to figure it out
[1:21:55] don't need your opinions you know God
[1:21:57] only wants our obedience so young Saul
[1:22:01] was a very zealous government agent out
[1:22:04] looking for anyone that
[1:22:05] complying with what they knew was right
[1:22:08] you know
[1:22:09] no problem with human rights no problem
[1:22:11] with profiling if you even looked like
[1:22:14] your part of the way prison death but
[1:22:18] his journey was interrupted by divine
[1:22:20] intervention now you won't find all of
[1:22:23] this on one page but if you consider
[1:22:26] chapter 9 1 through 18 chapter 22 1
[1:22:30] through 21 and chapter 26 19 you'll find
[1:22:34] the following details so it's a very
[1:22:37] bright hot sunny day
[1:22:38] he's eagerly moving along towards
[1:22:40] Damascus about 130 miles to the
[1:22:42] northeast and about noon a very bright
[1:22:45] light appears now at noon it's pretty
[1:22:47] bright anyway so this much brighter
[1:22:49] light shows up shown all around him
[1:22:52] knocked them all off their horses and
[1:22:54] now they're very confused because this
[1:22:58] fearless commander this Pharisee in
[1:23:00] charge of the anti-christian campaign is
[1:23:02] now faced down in the dirt the uniforms
[1:23:05] all dirty and it looks like he's talking
[1:23:07] to himself we got a problem they all saw
[1:23:13] the light they all fell off their horses
[1:23:15] they all heard a sound but only saw
[1:23:18] heard the voice and he heard it in his
[1:23:21] language the Hebrew language Saul Saul
[1:23:25] why are you persecuting me now Paul I
[1:23:28] saw wasn't persecuting one person but he
[1:23:30] was persecuting all those that had the
[1:23:32] spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:23:34] so he's persecuting Jesus Christ Lord
[1:23:37] who are you you know and what's this
[1:23:40] brilliant light in his power where's all
[1:23:42] this coming from I'm Jesus of Nazareth
[1:23:46] the one that you have been persecuting
[1:23:48] and immediately he remembered the death
[1:23:51] of Stephen I never left his mind
[1:23:55] immediately he was disarmed he's
[1:23:57] helpless he's face down in the dust and
[1:24:00] he's even blind in the brilliance of the
[1:24:03] glory of God so he had to heal
[1:24:06] completely there was no way out
[1:24:07] there's no patching this up maybe whoa
[1:24:10] no finish so if you are one of God's
[1:24:12] elect or one of your children one of
[1:24:15] your whatever God will hunt you down
[1:24:18] he will find
[1:24:19] he does care it doesn't matter what's
[1:24:22] your goals what your plans are he will
[1:24:24] find you and bring you into the way and
[1:24:29] right here we could put in the short
[1:24:31] version of the story of mr. Chappel
[1:24:34] that's in jail he was raised where a
[1:24:38] very young age in the in the Pentecostal
[1:24:41] church but he saw where that he could
[1:24:43] sell this these these other items and
[1:24:47] make more money he became the most
[1:24:49] powerful man on the planet for selling
[1:24:51] drugs you know very important you
[1:24:54] probably know people that are hooked on
[1:24:56] these drugs they have to have him but he
[1:24:59] heard the gospel through the radio Oh
[1:25:03] heard that before
[1:25:05] see if there's in the literature so sent
[1:25:09] him a book Oh angel came to me he liked
[1:25:13] it
[1:25:13] hey we need more I got 10,000 people
[1:25:16] with guns they all need to hear this so
[1:25:19] we gave him a memory stick published it
[1:25:21] for his people and a few other things
[1:25:24] and so he's just waiting for baptism but
[1:25:27] he's a believer even during the trial he
[1:25:30] never said a word you'll notice he's
[1:25:33] just sat through grand all his all the
[1:25:35] people they brought up through normal no
[1:25:38] telling how much money they spent to get
[1:25:39] these guys to testify against him these
[1:25:42] were his associates yeah we saw this
[1:25:44] okay so he's guilty no problem he's fine
[1:25:47] he never said a word the President of
[1:25:49] Mexico said that's a different man
[1:25:52] that's not the same guy that did all
[1:25:54] this so he testified to his conversion
[1:25:57] so anyway God will find you if you're
[1:26:00] his elect just like Paul so so Saul
[1:26:06] because we haven't called him Paul yet
[1:26:08] remember that Saul he says what do you
[1:26:11] want me to do arise go to Damascus so he
[1:26:16] had a glorious conversion and he had a
[1:26:19] direct Commission get up I have a
[1:26:21] purpose for you I will be with you it
[1:26:23] all comes down to faith in me nothing
[1:26:28] you can add or subtract Jesus alone
[1:26:31] so God had a plan Saul was not
[1:26:34] disobedient he obeyed he'll be perfectly
[1:26:37] he stayed in tune and stayed true to the
[1:26:42] word he didn't compromise and so we get
[1:26:45] to verse 10 of chapter 9 I read here and
[1:26:49] there's a certain disciple of Damascus
[1:26:51] named Ananias there was a common name
[1:26:53] back then and to him said the Lord in a
[1:26:57] vision Ananias he said behold I'm here
[1:26:59] Lord and the Lord said unto him get up
[1:27:02] go to the street that called straight
[1:27:04] give him the address inquire the house
[1:27:07] of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus
[1:27:10] he's over there praying hmm so God was
[1:27:15] already working at both ends preparing
[1:27:18] everything so Ananias we think of the
[1:27:21] deceptive property owner from yesterday
[1:27:23] there was another one in chapter 23 a
[1:27:25] self-righteous high priest and so forth
[1:27:27] but this Ananias in verse 10 is a real
[1:27:30] believer and he was a follower of the
[1:27:34] way and he'd heard about Pharisee Saul
[1:27:37] you know he was a bit cautious yeah and
[1:27:42] the Lord says to him in the vision he
[1:27:45] has seen in a vision a man named Ananias
[1:27:47] now that's you coming in putting his
[1:27:49] hand on him that he might receive His
[1:27:51] sight so Ananias being very cautious he
[1:27:54] argues a little bit Lord I've heard many
[1:27:57] things about this man and how he's
[1:27:59] treated your Saints in Jerusalem and
[1:28:01] he's come here under authority of the
[1:28:03] high priest and so forth but the Lord
[1:28:05] said get up and go he's a chosen vessel
[1:28:08] unto me to bear my name not just the
[1:28:14] stories bear my name to the Gentiles
[1:28:17] King's children Israel I will show him
[1:28:20] how great things he must suffer for my
[1:28:22] name's sake that had be very difficult
[1:28:31] so he goes up finds the address there's
[1:28:34] a blind man praying he didn't say good
[1:28:36] morning didn't say anything just goes in
[1:28:38] price Horton verse 18 and immediately
[1:28:43] there fell off his eyes like scale
[1:28:45] he received his sight forthwith and
[1:28:48] arose up and was baptized and we
[1:28:51] received meet he was strengthened then
[1:28:54] was saw certain days with disciples
[1:28:56] which read Damascus so he had been
[1:28:59] without anything to eat for three days
[1:29:00] you'll read there also so we immediately
[1:29:02] he began to preach at Damascus and many
[1:29:05] people heard him and verse 21 but all
[1:29:09] that heard him were amazed and said
[1:29:11] isn't this to the one that destroyed
[1:29:14] that our brothers and sisters in
[1:29:15] Jerusalem and came here for that intent
[1:29:17] and he might bring them bound the chief
[1:29:20] priests so saw increased the more in
[1:29:26] strength and confounded the Jews which
[1:29:29] would dwell to Damascus proving that
[1:29:31] this is the very Christ he was totally
[1:29:34] convinced he was preaching to others and
[1:29:37] these people that are questioning these
[1:29:39] were his close associates a few days
[1:29:41] before you know and after many days of
[1:29:43] preaching verse 23 and after many days
[1:29:46] were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to
[1:29:49] kill him his buddies that he was working
[1:29:51] with now they're after him those people
[1:29:55] don't mess around you know they they how
[1:29:59] many pieces you know you out of here our
[1:30:02] friend over there Ruben you know he had
[1:30:04] he had a son and a daughter well the the
[1:30:09] daughter married a loser it happens you
[1:30:11] know so this guy would squander their
[1:30:13] money and Rubens always bailing him out
[1:30:16] well he's just you know had it with
[1:30:18] these people with this guy
[1:30:20] and he's telling his friends and so he's
[1:30:23] got a lot of friends at her Arabs and so
[1:30:25] the Arab said now look Ruben you don't
[1:30:27] have to stress over this you don't have
[1:30:29] to say a word just write a number here
[1:30:31] on the paper that's the number of pieces
[1:30:33] we will chop him in and nobody ever know
[1:30:35] about it it disappear and they can do it
[1:30:39] so these guys just you know solves in
[1:30:42] the way they we got a killer did they
[1:30:44] just think that way well this is the
[1:30:47] first attempt on his life here in verse
[1:30:49] 23 and this is about the third year of
[1:30:53] his preaching and then verse 24 but
[1:30:56] they're laying way it was known of Saul
[1:30:59] and they watched the gates day and night
[1:31:01] to kill him why is that because every
[1:31:03] city had a wall around it did it anyway
[1:31:05] airplanes if he gonna come in you got to
[1:31:07] come through this gate so they're
[1:31:08] watching the gates watching him to come
[1:31:10] out they're gonna grab him then the
[1:31:12] disciples took him by night I let him
[1:31:13] down over the wall in the basket well a
[1:31:16] great idea and he got away okay so now
[1:31:20] he's over Jerusalem and he tried to get
[1:31:22] with the disciples but they were all
[1:31:25] afraid of him verse 26 and believed not
[1:31:28] that he was a disciple well no kidding
[1:31:30] you know if these destroyed grandma and
[1:31:33] a whole bunch of other people it's gonna
[1:31:34] be very hard to trust this man I mean
[1:31:36] anybody can quote it but is it real and
[1:31:39] so they didn't know we're too sure about
[1:31:41] it you know verse 27 but Barnabas he's
[1:31:46] also known as the son of encouragement
[1:31:48] took him and brought him to this to the
[1:31:50] Apostles and declared unto them how he
[1:31:52] had seen the Lord in the way and told
[1:31:54] the whole story and he was with them
[1:31:57] coming and going out of Jerusalem and he
[1:32:00] spake boldly in the name of the Lord
[1:32:02] Jesus and they disputed against the
[1:32:03] Grecians and they went about to slay him
[1:32:06] it goes on and on you know they're
[1:32:09] trying to get him but there was second
[1:32:12] attempt on his life people have a hard
[1:32:14] time adapting to change they just can't
[1:32:17] handle it you know getting with God's
[1:32:20] program receiving the revelation of the
[1:32:21] word they want it the way they learned
[1:32:23] it in the Baptist Church no this is a
[1:32:24] different dispensation this this you
[1:32:27] know that God has a better program today
[1:32:28] so anybody can read and repeat we got we
[1:32:31] got all kinds of people carrying spoken
[1:32:33] word books well they got it just right
[1:32:34] down tight what he said but what about
[1:32:36] the manifestation you see you got to
[1:32:39] receive by revelation the word lives
[1:32:41] through you and that's much different so
[1:32:44] to change the scene Paul
[1:32:45] Saul goes away to his hometown Peter and
[1:32:48] the other disciples were a busy and here
[1:32:51] in chapter 13 chapter 9 verse 32 it tell
[1:32:57] us about the came to pass as Peter
[1:33:01] passed through all the quarters you know
[1:33:03] he's visiting different ones
[1:33:04] he came also to the Saints which were at
[1:33:06] Leda that's out where the airport is
[1:33:08] today and there he found a certain man
[1:33:11] named
[1:33:11] named Aeneas which had kept his bed
[1:33:14] eight years been on the bed never moved
[1:33:15] for eight years and he was at the policy
[1:33:17] very sick and Peter said at him Aeneas
[1:33:20] Jesus Christ makes you whole arise make
[1:33:23] a pre-bid he rose up immediately there's
[1:33:25] power in the name but it depends how you
[1:33:29] use it what atmosphere but it's real and
[1:33:31] all the dwell at Leda and Sauron saw him
[1:33:34] and turned to the Lord so with a group
[1:33:36] of believers because of this miracle hey
[1:33:38] this is the right way and so then while
[1:33:43] Peters in that needs away from Jerusalem
[1:33:45] he's he's you know quite a ways away it
[1:33:48] says there was a job a certain a of
[1:33:50] certain disciple named Tabitha which by
[1:33:52] interpretation is Dorcas so that's the
[1:33:54] same name Tabitha Dorcas same thing and
[1:33:57] she was full of good works you know she
[1:33:59] had made all kinds of quilts and all
[1:34:00] kinds of things and she was sick and she
[1:34:03] died and they had her laid out in the on
[1:34:05] the bed and so Leda was near Joppa and
[1:34:08] the disciples heard that Peter was over
[1:34:10] there so hey come over here we got a
[1:34:12] problem so verse thirty-nine Peter Rose
[1:34:14] went with them and when he was come they
[1:34:17] brought him to the upper chamber and
[1:34:19] here's all these people crying and
[1:34:21] showing the great deeds and things she
[1:34:22] didn't made and so forth Peter puts them
[1:34:25] all out they out of here so he kneels
[1:34:27] down prays and turning to the body
[1:34:31] Tabitha arise Children's her eyes when
[1:34:35] she saw Peter she sat up he gave her his
[1:34:37] hand lifted her up and when you called
[1:34:40] the Saints and the widows presented for
[1:34:42] alive and it was known throughout Joppa
[1:34:44] and many believed on the Lord and it
[1:34:47] came to pass that he tarried many days
[1:34:51] in Joppa with another man named Simon
[1:34:55] the Tanner and it's 7:30 we've got time
[1:34:59] for one more chapter can't leave you
[1:35:02] hanging so he's the Simon the Tanners
[1:35:05] house now forty miles up the road it's a
[1:35:10] place called Caesarea sesor real is a
[1:35:13] town of receive 80 thousand people at
[1:35:14] the time and the Roman general they had
[1:35:21] made him a nice house well there's a
[1:35:22] very nice nice seaside place
[1:35:25] and there's a Gentile man up there by
[1:35:27] the name of Cornelius he was in charge
[1:35:29] of what was called the Italian regiment
[1:35:31] as many as possibly six hundred soldiers
[1:35:34] and he had a vision about three o'clock
[1:35:36] in the afternoon and his name was called
[1:35:39] from the other dimension okay he said he
[1:35:41] looked at the angel so it was more than
[1:35:44] a vision
[1:35:45] there was a visitation and he was afraid
[1:35:47] and what is it Lord what is it verse 4
[1:35:50] of chapter 10 here let's see what it
[1:35:54] says what is it Lord and he said unto
[1:35:58] Him thy prayers and that alms are come
[1:36:00] up as a memorial before God and now you
[1:36:04] need to send two men send men to Joppa
[1:36:06] and call for one called Simon Peter is
[1:36:10] it Simon the Tanners house by the sea
[1:36:14] gives him the address and he shall tell
[1:36:18] thee what thou oughtest to do well isn't
[1:36:21] that interesting why didn't the angel
[1:36:23] himself tell him the story he's telling
[1:36:26] me your prayers are heard God loves you
[1:36:28] and there's a program for you but he's
[1:36:31] got to go soon for that man to come here
[1:36:32] to tell you brother Brennan says God
[1:36:36] could have chose the Sun or the wind or
[1:36:38] whatever the palm trees but he chose man
[1:36:41] to preach the gospel it's all through
[1:36:44] the New Testament it's on a little mini
[1:36:46] tapes we got to quote somewhere to that
[1:36:48] effect it's not a mystery it's Paul's
[1:36:51] gospel didn't call no tape recorder
[1:36:53] nothing else called men to preach the
[1:36:55] gospel and there's one of them right
[1:36:57] here so we got through that part so in
[1:37:01] verse 7 he sends three trusted men down
[1:37:03] to Joppa just as the angel told him that
[1:37:05] took off they traveled that very night
[1:37:07] arriving about noon the next day okay
[1:37:09] meanwhile Peter is resting taking a
[1:37:12] couple days off and he's they the the
[1:37:17] homes back then were flat
[1:37:18] I had flat roofs and he's up on the top
[1:37:21] of the roof maybe a little bit of breeze
[1:37:22] maybe a little tarp there for shade and
[1:37:25] in verse 10 you know he's getting hungry
[1:37:27] they're cooking lunch downstairs he's
[1:37:29] getting hungry and he goes into a vision
[1:37:32] into a supernatural experience okay now
[1:37:35] a seer is a prophet same thing they live
[1:37:37] in two dimensions
[1:37:39] William Brennan says I live in the other
[1:37:41] dimension more than half the time so he
[1:37:43] gave me you can be here preaching and
[1:37:45] he's seeing 300 people here well
[1:37:47] obviously it's not 300 people here but
[1:37:49] he's seeing angels and you know
[1:37:51] everything so when it comes to numbers
[1:37:53] leave him alone he knows what he's
[1:37:55] talking about this is more than what you
[1:37:57] can see you know and so it's very
[1:38:02] natural for them to see more than what
[1:38:04] you can see so in the scriptures I see
[1:38:11] here an 11 so he sees heaven open this
[1:38:15] is this experience he has and a sheet
[1:38:17] comes down tight at the four corners we
[1:38:19] can imagine and in this great sheet is
[1:38:22] all kinds of beasts all kinds of animals
[1:38:24] and the wild beasts creeping things all
[1:38:27] kinds of animals and so what happens he
[1:38:32] in the in the scriptures God gave the
[1:38:34] Jewish people certain dietary laws for
[1:38:37] good reasons he knows what he's talking
[1:38:38] about things that could eat things that
[1:38:40] should not eat and so God is showing
[1:38:42] here in symbols to the man that has the
[1:38:44] keys to the kingdom that it's time to
[1:38:46] turn the corner and the interpretation
[1:38:49] of this vision is the God the gospel is
[1:38:51] for everyone not just the Jewish people
[1:38:53] it's time to spread out a little bit and
[1:38:56] because they're whole everybody up to
[1:38:58] them was Jewish had all this history
[1:39:00] GRANDMONT everything well now it's time
[1:39:02] to turn the corner and so these laws
[1:39:05] were so ingrained and part of their
[1:39:06] their life that Peter begins to argue
[1:39:09] with the angel which is nothing new for
[1:39:12] Peter so the OI says rise Peter kill and
[1:39:16] eat oh no no no I've never eaten such
[1:39:20] the stuff is that oh no no not me and
[1:39:23] the boy said the second time what God
[1:39:26] hath cleansed don't you call common you
[1:39:29] know and so the voice you know the
[1:39:32] second time hey pay attention Peter it's
[1:39:34] not a debate and he comes up three times
[1:39:37] and then the vision disappears so in
[1:39:40] verse 17 while he's still arranging
[1:39:41] these new orders as mine Oh God said so
[1:39:43] on three visitors are downstairs and so
[1:39:48] he's getting this clear in his mind
[1:39:50] about the Jews and the Gentiles and the
[1:39:52] Spirit of God
[1:39:53] tells him hey there's three men
[1:39:54] downstairs looking for you get up go
[1:39:57] down there go with them I have sent them
[1:39:59] to look for you host the whole story is
[1:40:02] here I mean anywhere you want to open
[1:40:05] your Bible anywhere those two pages you
[1:40:08] can make fantastic movie anywhere same
[1:40:12] with spoken word book anywhere you want
[1:40:13] to open it you know that's great
[1:40:15] and so um he goes downstairs and I'm the
[1:40:20] one you're looking for how can I help
[1:40:21] you so they explained the whole thing
[1:40:23] about the vision that the Cornelius had
[1:40:25] and so forth and so he invites him in
[1:40:28] they spent the night the next day they
[1:40:30] started walking and the following day
[1:40:32] they arrived assess Surya now Cornelius
[1:40:34] had been waiting for them see all his
[1:40:36] news was this visitation send men to get
[1:40:39] this guy named Peter that's all he knows
[1:40:40] so he sends him now here they come back
[1:40:43] with Peter and the meantime he's calling
[1:40:47] all his relatives all his close friends
[1:40:48] man house pack outs or not and so excuse
[1:40:52] me man
[1:40:56] so when Peter comes through the door
[1:40:58] this fearless commander of six hundred
[1:41:00] soldiers goes to his knees to worship
[1:41:03] this is the this is the person the angel
[1:41:06] told me about this hey it's real it's
[1:41:08] come to pass you know genuine servants
[1:41:11] of God did not accept worship rule
[1:41:14] number one okay and so of any kind so
[1:41:18] here was the man of God this is the very
[1:41:20] one that they told me James will told me
[1:41:22] there's a spokesman for the Lord the man
[1:41:24] of the keys he had been used to God for
[1:41:26] many miracles even raising the dead just
[1:41:29] a couple days before you know and even
[1:41:32] though Peter had made many mistakes hey
[1:41:36] he had a mouth problem just like some of
[1:41:37] us we ocean said that huh he argued with
[1:41:41] to Jesus he argued with the angel but he
[1:41:43] was learning balance okay
[1:41:46] it was hard but he was learning and he
[1:41:48] was teaching others so he when he got
[1:41:51] inside the house you know got past the
[1:41:53] the hey kerela stand up me I'm a man
[1:41:56] like you so when he gets inside the
[1:41:58] house the first thing he said where's it
[1:42:02] at verse 28 here
[1:42:05] you all know that it's unlawful for a
[1:42:08] man like me being a Jew to keep company
[1:42:09] with you all from another nation but God
[1:42:12] has shown me that I should not call
[1:42:14] anything common or unclean aha
[1:42:17] so it was his vision he gave the
[1:42:20] interpretation so let's be sure remember
[1:42:23] that one we read brother Browns visions
[1:42:25] it's his vision it doesn't depend on us
[1:42:27] tricking it out you know and so it was
[1:42:29] illegal they shouldn't be there
[1:42:31] you know you don't you don't deal with
[1:42:33] those people and so that was the the the
[1:42:37] translation of it you know we have stick
[1:42:39] very strict segregation but God has
[1:42:42] showed me a better way so he was he was
[1:42:45] moving out of his comfort zone see he
[1:42:48] was taught a certain way but by divine
[1:42:50] permission he can visit with these
[1:42:51] people and so you see God gives the
[1:42:54] experience of the visions of the Prophet
[1:42:56] only the Prophet can bring the proper
[1:42:58] interpretation you see this large seed
[1:43:02] these animals what God asked us
[1:43:04] interpret it we didn't ever come up with
[1:43:06] this translation you know but that's
[1:43:08] what it was God has shown me and so
[1:43:13] we're simply that the the repeaters of
[1:43:16] the word we're not here to figure it out
[1:43:18] and this means there and I think it
[1:43:20] means that no just repeat and declare
[1:43:24] the manifestation of God's prophecy
[1:43:26] he'll take care of it God does not
[1:43:28] require our opinions our ideas but just
[1:43:32] be yielded you know flexible and
[1:43:35] available and that God will accomplish
[1:43:37] his plan now so once he cleared the air
[1:43:42] with that that you meeting with Gentiles
[1:43:45] verse 29 therefore I came unto you
[1:43:49] without gain saying no didn't as soon as
[1:43:51] I was sent for
[1:43:53] I asked therefore what intent have you
[1:43:56] for me you hold about what do you why'd
[1:43:59] y'all send for me see so verse 33 33
[1:44:03] they were totally ready for whatever God
[1:44:05] had there's no prejudice no preconceived
[1:44:09] ideas whatever God has we want it so
[1:44:12] when we're living our gospel today
[1:44:17] people want to see Christians
[1:44:19] they don't want they could care less
[1:44:21] about seventh seal also stuff just this
[1:44:23] when we'll see somebody that lives the
[1:44:25] word that was the success of brother
[1:44:27] brems ministry that he just lived the
[1:44:29] spirit of the Bible he didn't have you
[1:44:31] know prophet you know Neil no nonsense
[1:44:34] oh that what so it worked you know so
[1:44:38] here he is preaching to a humble home
[1:44:40] meeting Gentiles for the first time and
[1:44:44] in ten verses he gives them the whole
[1:44:46] Gospel message simple and to the point
[1:44:48] and let's look at verse forty for
[1:44:51] example here was that him God raised up
[1:44:55] the third day and showed him openly not
[1:44:58] to all people but unto witnesses chosen
[1:45:00] before of God even us who did eat and
[1:45:04] drink with him after he rose from the
[1:45:05] dead and he commanded us to preach unto
[1:45:09] the people and to testify that it is he
[1:45:13] which was ordained of God to be the
[1:45:15] judge of the quick and the dead not me
[1:45:18] not anybody else God is to judge we can
[1:45:22] just live our gospel God will judge okay
[1:45:25] and so it's very important today when
[1:45:30] there's satanic forces everywhere taking
[1:45:33] the deity out of the name of Jesus
[1:45:35] Christ all Jesus wasn't God well I think
[1:45:37] he was so I'll leave it alone brother
[1:45:39] Wren said he was and taking the DD out
[1:45:43] and placing it somewhere else
[1:45:45] may God keep us true keep us faithful
[1:45:49] verse 44 the preaching of the word a
[1:45:52] very short sermon was so powerful to
[1:45:55] these Gentile people first time they
[1:45:56] heard all this stuff that the Holy
[1:45:58] Spirit fell on them in the service
[1:46:00] manifested by speaking in different
[1:46:01] tongues magnify God even before they
[1:46:04] were baptized God can do anything if
[1:46:10] somebody believes and is killed well
[1:46:12] they're part of it nobody said they had
[1:46:14] to be baptized some some people never
[1:46:16] were baptized I know a whole lot of
[1:46:18] people that they believe they were
[1:46:19] killed immediately because they believe
[1:46:21] you see and so God can do any thing you
[1:46:25] see so verse 47 Peter says over here can
[1:46:31] any mad for any man forbid water
[1:46:33] these should not be baptized which has
[1:46:35] received the Holy Ghost as well as we
[1:46:36] did and he commanded them to be baptized
[1:46:39] in the name of the Lord and the and they
[1:46:41] prayed and they they prayed him to tarry
[1:46:44] certain days okay
[1:46:45] so God God is not bound to a certain
[1:46:52] program God can do anything let him be
[1:46:56] the judge you see so we've met Barnabas
[1:46:59] son of encouragement he gave generously
[1:47:02] chapter four then let in chapter nine he
[1:47:05] befriended sald a converted agitator we
[1:47:08] met Ananias and Sapphira and his wife
[1:47:10] make believers tried to lie to the Holy
[1:47:12] Spirit we met Deacon Stephen went from
[1:47:16] serving the widows to defending the
[1:47:18] faith before the authorities and was
[1:47:20] brutally killed for his testimony
[1:47:21] we met Philip the Evangelist experienced
[1:47:24] time travel and preached the three
[1:47:26] different ethnic groups in one day the
[1:47:28] African minister of finances who was the
[1:47:30] first Gentile believer in chapter 8 we
[1:47:33] met brother Ananias normal Syrian
[1:47:36] believer in Damascus was sent by God to
[1:47:37] preach for God's chosen but it was the
[1:47:41] church's worst enemy oh they had to be
[1:47:44] tough and then there's Cornelius the
[1:47:47] powerful army officer that loved God
[1:47:49] tried to worship God servant and became
[1:47:52] a real believer and saw the government
[1:47:54] agent in charge of anti-christian
[1:47:56] campaign of whom God said he's my man
[1:47:59] I've got plans for it so there's many
[1:48:02] more to come
