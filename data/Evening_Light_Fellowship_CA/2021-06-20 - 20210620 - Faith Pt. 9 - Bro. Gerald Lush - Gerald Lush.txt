are impossible now i believe amen praise the lord lord bless you turn with me to saint matthew's gospel chapter 15. amen and certainly to ask you to remember continue to remember our brother bradley mcdonald in prayer in fort mcmurray and i have been trying to get contact our brother martin warner for for a while and uh but the email i got is not just not working so i'm praying that brother martin because brother martin did live in in fort mcmurray and i remember that i was there and i ministered because he had cottage meetings and that's why i ministered there maybe a couple of times two or three times a man he was using the garage that was attached to his house as a church a man so it was a wonderful time of fellowship that we had and i thank the lord for that but of course our brother martin has moved out of there and i think most are all the believers as far as i know moved out of there but our brother bradley and that is brother ron and sister shirley snow's grandson and so he's contacted me since he went to fort mcmurray and he wanted to know if there's any church believe believer church there message church there amen and i know it's been a while since i met brother bradley and uh he was only maybe just a teenager when i did meeting that meet him in inter brother ron's and sister shirley's but he had a nice spirit and a nice attitude so i pray god continue to bless him in fort mcmurray amen but again i did hear from some believer and i'm not short of his brother martin but they did inform me that they do have a son there and i understand i guess again that he's a believer this his son is a believer so i was trying to get contact to find out who it is and so i can pass it on to brother bradley so god's grace to our brother bradley amen that god will meet the need and that he will experience god's leadership in his life amen i would say i assume maybe he might be just maybe in his early 20s his age so god's grace to him so keep in prayer that we'll we will locate our brother martin i think he uh he ministers for brother fury right i think so but i i didn't have brother fury's email address so i'll try to contact him through them by the grace of god amen so keep in prayer for these needs and also uh you see oh yeah to remind you and i wish you wish the old ones happy father's day amen amen and also and of course the young ones they're there anyhow and and the young ones are calling on them same thing they're dead and so on so so god god's grace to us and to our our brothers here who are fathers so god bless you and give you a a happy father's day fellowship with your family amen praise the lord so just keep keep one another in prayer for these issues and there was something else i was going to deal with we'd do with it later and that i was discussing it with a couple of brothers a week and so just be in prayer and i'll put it before the saints for the amen for the will of god amen okay matthew 15. oh yeah and also to express uh oh uh i trust when we get the glory that brother chad will be with us amen anybody anybody looking for us they don't know where we are yeah amen not not seeing us but they will hear somebody yeah they'll hear our brother chad amen so thank the lord so the lord bless us and amen and the lord bless our brother and oh yes and sister priscilla amen praise the lord there'll be a brother there to be a sister there screaming pray praising god ali yes praise the lord so lord bless us and we pray god continue with those brothers we still we don't want to lose that amen keep keep going amen and in matthew chapter 15 and verses beginning at verse 29 and it says and jesus departed from this and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them praise the lord wonderful hallelujah insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak yeah the maimed to behold the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel amen then jesus called his disciples onto him and said i have compassion on the multitude amen because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way god bless his word you may be seated amen amen and turn with me again to john chapter 8. jesus highlighted their faithfulness and jesus highlights our faithfulness to continue with him amen is not just to get in but it's to have that hunger and that thirst for watch what he what he's doing amen and that hunger and that thirst for what what you want him to do in your life praise the lord they were there for that hunger and thirst for what jesus could do they knew when it comes to salvation it was in jesus when it comes to healing it was in jesus name when it comes to doing this they needed jesus amen and again jesus called his disciples onto him and said i have compassion on the multitude because why because he said they continue with me amen he will have compassion on us if we continue with it amen if we stay with him if we're going to continue with the word if we're going to stay with the word amen in our hearts in our souls in our spirit not just in our heads and again let's pray the grace of god that again by grace as the prophet said to the those even in in branham tabernacle he said you're in the message but the message is not in you amen that's the truth so brother and sister there's many of many a so-called professing believer that's in the message but the message is not in them that's right amen because if the message was in them it would be reflected morning noon and night every day amen oh my grace praise the lord i i o lord i pray the grace of god that anointing in our hearts in our souls amen because i i remember back there some years ago when believers got together for worship oh yeah they were right into it amen worship not that they weren't into this and went into that but they're into the word amen they're into jesus by the grace of god and after after our service after we had a service oh my the saints would get together outside oh oh yeah they didn't get involved in the natural things of life that continued with what they started inside the church amen what was it oh they got together and they talked about the word talked about the lord talked about the resurrection talked with the rapture oh brother this is wonderful amen they were spiritual amen but there's too many that's just religious but not spiritual that's right amen and there there's a brother that's been that i've noticed us on the internet and he says sermons are there and and he's he's been preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching for many sermons already and maybe preaching the same thing today and asking the question concerning are you are you religious or do you have a relationship amen what are you working on what are you here for amen is because it's your religious or is it because of your relationship with jesus amen is your relationship with the word amen so i trust that we're all here because amen that we have a relationship with our lord jesus christ amen and brother if there's a relationship you want to maintain that relationship morning noon and night praise the lord it's just not on a sunday it's just not on a wednesday it says now i'm going to oh when i get up in the morning just ask the lord to bless me ask the lord to be with me no no you're gonna you're gonna continue in fellowship with him 24 hours a day amen that's the only way that you can say is the bible says it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me amen and if christ is living in you christ living in me we there's not not an hour that goes by but we think of him amen that we're going to talk to him that oh my yes through the day as i have said before i i even when i'm driving a vehicle and i'm going and going and going brother i don't forget the lord amen as i said i wonder how many of us approach those those uh traffic lights and have a spiritual understanding amen as i've said i've gone through a traffic light now see this and i see this oh lord is it is it yellow or is it or what is it red or is it is there no light at all amen so a spiritual what do we see what is the revelation to us when we go through that traffic light when we see this we see that and so on brother i tell you if you're if you're a christian amen you have you have that spiritual understanding you have that spiritual eyes thoughts amen amen not kindness we're spiritual but there's too many so-called believers they're just seeing the world it was spiritual we're carnalized natural eyes and so on they're not they're not seeing it so spiritualize not going out there and living spiritually amen they might live religiously but not spiritually amen so why if it's not you if not you that lives christ lives in you you're living a spiritual life amen no matter what's going on no matter what you experience you you want what you want to know what what jesus is doing lord what is this what do you want me to do did you do this lord did you permit this lord amen see again not you that lives is christ living in you amen and that you are living for him you're living with the word you are spiritual amen not religious you're spiritual amen and brother i tell you this family friends and neighbors will know that amen by the way you live by how you act by how you talk they'll know that oh yeah i got this this relative there but they're spiritual yeah because they're they're thinking spiritual they act spiritual they talk spiritual and they're giving they're always remembering jesus and to thank jesus thank you lord for this thank you for that amen be with me lord i need some wisdom here lord amen i don't care what you are doing amen you need jesus i'll tell you that no matter what your job is no matter what what your needs are amen no matter who your family is or whatever you need jesus to lead you guide you teacher amen amen you need jesus so that you're amen you're going to walk in the light as he is in the light you're going to amen you're going to reflect jesus walk in the spirit amen and his spirit is going to be in you by the grace of god amen and yes your family is going to recognize that you're spiritual not religious amen oh yeah i pray god that we're going forth with that witness we're going forward with that testimony amen we're not acting this way and acting that way oh they're religious they go to they go to church there they go to church there they believe this they believe that no no we're gonna we're gonna go forth and reflect jesus spiritually amen in thought in word and deed they're gonna know it amen that anointing is with you that anointing is in you that anointing is on you that anointing controls you amen exactly by the grace of god amen exactly as jesus said i have compassion on the multitude because why they continue amen they continue with me now three days he said with these ear amen oh yeah they didn't just wait for him wait for this wait for that oh we'll we'll see you when we when when you come down that out of the out of that place amen where you going to be next we'll we'll see you there no they stayed with him amen and and jesus blessed them jesus had compassion amen why because they continue continued with him by the grace of god amen they continue with me now three days well brother if you've got an experience with god you continue with them every day morning noon and night 24 hours a day you continue with jesus amen so you can truly say and god really knows it's the truth that it's not you that lives is christ living in you amen yes god help us amen so amen so that if we say that god the god can say amen amen so be it so i pray no matter where you are no matter what you're doing whether it's your work whether it's in your home that is christ in you amen christ is doing this christ is doing that as i said about the the time that sister byron said that visitor come through the door and when sister barnes opened the door and let them in they said oh i feel a spirit there she said you must have brought it back you must have brought us you should because i haven't felt it yeah i only feel the holy spirit and i don't know what what do you what that what that visitor felt amen and again but again god was blessing and honoring sister burns his faith amen why it was the lord that she it was in control amen she didn't have to wait for that visitor to come not by any maids she was still in in contact with him she worshipped them no matter what she was doing she give she'd give her attention to jesus she talked to jesus lord she said thank you you blessed me lord thank you you've encouraged me thank you lord you've done this you've done that amen so i pray brother that we're conscious that of of what's going on in our life amen oh this is good oh thank you thank you brother for that thank you this so-and-so thank you no thank god amen she would always thank the lord oh she appreciated the brothers she appreciated the sisters but she thank god for his influence in them praise the lord hallelujah and in john chapter 8 just to share with you some thoughts regarding what god is looking for in you and in me and god god wants in you and me and what is it is to continue with him that once you started you stay amen it's not just come in and go out come in and go out oh yeah we're going to come in and and while you're here oh yeah thank you lord and you're going to sing praise the lord thank you for the word then when you go out you leave it behind oh there's a lot there's a lot of believers leave it behind amen brother they come in to find god but they go out and leave him amen instead of going out and revealing him in in their flesh the sons and daughters of god are there to for god to reveal him in himself in them amen so are you living the life wherein jesus is revealing himself in you amen amen what you do how you do it you're spiritual what you do and how you do it as sons and daughters of god amen not the son and daughter of the of your earthly parents but the sons and daughters of your heavenly parent by the grace of god amen that that nature is gone it is put back amen there's a new nature come in to control it amen so that you're controlled by the nature of god oh i am yes if you're born again amen if you're born again god controls you his nature controls you because you're going to you're going to be controlled by the nature of your father amen and especially in your new birth by the grace of god if it's only religious no oh you're controlled by your religion to go to church this time that time or maybe to do this or do that amen but if you're controlled by christ he's in control morning noon and night of your life amen brother you are spiritual no matter who you're dealing with what you're as i've said even even when i worked in in in the among non-believers and yeah most were all all unbelievers but yet they would come and say well we're so we appreciate your spirit we we know that you're a christian amen why because they knew the way you act the way you talk the way you react amen they know your attitude then oh well he's a christian yeah by the grace of god amen will give god the glory so brother let's go listen we're going to be a christian you'll go out and live the life that jesus lived amen brother you're going to go out and have the attitude that jesus had amen you're going to have the actions and reactions that jesus had amen again like i said it's not me that lives not you that lives is christ living in you amen sure you're and in the eyes of the world you're spiritual now somebody's of course you'll be considered a fanatic but that's all right jesus was considered a fanatic amen because they wanted to put jesus down they wanted to do this they want to do that amen and jesus was looking for that same fanaticism in his disciples amen oh brother just think as i said when jesus was praying they were sleeping oh yeah you're thinking after after the ministry and after all they experienced and after all that they had heard jesus say and seen jesus do go to sleep goodness you wouldn't think you'd be able to sleep when you were around jesus you'd have to maybe just go somewhere else amen but he went looked for him he wanted he wanted them may oh oh you want them maybe to come and help him and pray with him no they were asleep amen they finally said sleep on take your rest amen oh yeah one day they'd wake up and they wouldn't go to sleep no more amen when the holy ghost comes in brother you're not going to sleep spiritually not by any means you're going to be more and more conscious of what god is doing so are you conscious of what god's doing right now are you conscious of what god is doing with you and in you with you amen come on listen let's be conscious amen that is not it's not you and brother jerome amen it's you and god god is dealing with you god is ministering to you god has given you his word god has given you his counsel amen so i pray in the name of jesus hallelujah that what comes forth for you that you're going to receive it you're going to recognize it amen thank you lord amen brother gerald didn't know that and brother joel didn't know this was going on that was going on but you knew it and thank you for for causing the brother to say it thank you lord hallelujah lord for getting my attention amen go for revealing that you know me amen praise the name of the lord it's like again brother sister i pray grace that you've had an experience with god experience with jesus so that's jesus in you jesus with you amen and you were with jesus and you you loved jesus again as i was thinking just recently about when i when i went to an altar to get to call on the lord for salvation and it was it was in a a salvation army citadel and and the place was blocked with all mine it was full and and i was sitting in a seat there and i was sitting and i was crying near the end of the service i cried and cried and cried amen calling on the lord and then i i felt uh somebody touched me on my shoulder amen and and i turned around oh there was a sister standing in a seat behind me and she said brother gerald i said yes sister she said you need to go to the altar please brother stand up and go and bow yourself before him amen and that's what i did amen went out to the altar and by myself before him and after a while amen there was someone there got me up and they said well oh what happened oh i said i just got saved amen i said the lord saved me amen the lord gave me your salvation oh i said praise the lord amen and they begin to sing and praise the lord too amen so brother but now what god's looking for now is that we continue in it amen there's a beginning well let's go on the end of eternity amen continue in your relationship with god continue in your relationship with jesus continue in your relationship with the bride of christ with believers amen sons and daughters of god amen continue and jesus said they have continued with me he said they they heard me they saw me and now i said i've come this time in three days he said they have stayed with me brother where are we are we in our relationship now amen continuing with him amen still looking for the resurrection still expecting the rapture amen it's not start and again just is too bad that the message has become to a lot of people it's just the doctrines are creeds well we believe this we believe that brother what we believe is the living word of god made flesh in us amen it's not just ideas and thoughts that we have in our heads not ideas and thoughts that we would have in our minds no it's a life it's eternal life amen that's why again let me say it again as well you can say not me lives jesus living in me he is yes he talks through me and always he's living out the word through me amen he he's a witness through me amen praise the name of the lord and again it's not just coming in says oh i believe the message i believe this i believe that this doctrine that doctrine and all it is is a creed amen oh yeah as i said when i when i was at an altar in a message church and oh and there was a lot of people up around the altar and again there was this person sitting there not sitting but kneeling next to me and they just prayed said lord thank you for the word thank you for the message now lord she said we know we don't have to come under any man and i said lord i said they need a revelation amen amen because the power of god said he said when when you come under god god brings you under a flightful ministry amen and someone said oh brother branham is there a ministry in the bride and does it right have a ministry and he said sure the bride's got a ministry and he said it's been going on for 2000 years and he quoted and and he said these have god set in the church and he said the faithful ministry amen so he says they are in the brain and yet there are so-called believers that don't believe in any ministry that's true amen there are so-called believers that don't think that they've got to be under any pastor any evangelist no no no they just feel they're they're set free but brother if they really had an experience with jesus they come under a ministry here amen as again that that brother said to brother branham he said brother branham he said i don't need any any preacher to tell me this and tell me that and so on he said why because i got the holy ghost and he's teaching me well the problem of god said brother if the holy ghost is teaching you he's using a man to do it that's right amen there's a man out there somewhere he said he in the body and he said he'll lead you to that man he'll bring that man all over you he said to teach you what he wants you to know amen so brother amen are we subject to the ministry these as god set in the church amen what for to strengthen the church to encourage the church to give the church the wisdom they need and the leadership they need by the grace of almighty god amen and the ministry of a pastor sure again another person said to brother branham oh i i'm an evangelist he said i i don't have to come under a pastor and the prophet of god went back into the word he said brother hear the word amen he said even the evangelist got to come on to a pastor amen by the grace of almighty god and all the others said to come under the leadership of a pastor that's right oh god help us i pray by grace amen that again oh well i got a pastoral ministry praise the lord but yet maybe the lord has got another pastoral ministry amen we'll see what god's going to do amen do god be oh lord god help us to be spiritual amen god happens to be spiritual and not just religious that's right amen there's too many believers that are just religious oh yeah i believe the message i believe this and it's just like a creed to them amen that's like the pentecostals brother and god's going they say well i believe god i believe this i believe that sure is what god did for them and what god has done for us but brother we still got to move on with god amen we still got to surrender to god and commander is the leadership of his ministries that he has set in the church by the grace of almighty god amen but brother we're getting to the place where there's more less there's less and less believers who are coming under ministries who are subject to ministries who are led by the ministry amen they're just going to do what they want amen amen no no but they got to do what god wants them to do and you see the thing of it is when you start you got to continue amen and you've got to continue in the word amen jesus jesus highlighted that those those believers there amen that congregation there amen why should because they have continued with me three days amen they stayed with him and he said no they had no food would you stay with him oh he said no no no i'm not going back home no i gotta get some food no no there was something more controlling them amen they're putting more and more emphasis on the spiritual not the physical amen oh yeah i tell you this there's a lot of things that god would like us to do but we're believers god wants this god once said but no there's so many believers that still put more attention on the natural things of life not the spiritual that's right amen so god elvis brother you listen if we're sons and daughters of god we're putting emphasis on the spiritual whatever god wants whatever when god wants i'll do it here he is no brother amen we're not going to try to get god to do it our way we're not trying to get god to do it our time it's his time amen it's his time and it's his way amen and what he wants to do amen because there's many many of many a so-called believer oh they'll hesitate this they'll hesitate that they don't want to get involved in that oh well uh i don't think i don't think my family would like that so so that they think oh i'll just believe it go on believe it and live it amen believe it and walk in it believe it and reflect it amen by the grace of almighty god amen brave your spirit is right your answer is right yes the power of god said that that god's going to have even friends he said of the bride he said on the earth as they're there they're there to encourage the bride they're there to help the bride they're there to stand for the bride amen they don't see this they don't see that oh no not like the bright seas but it says they they have a right spirit right attitude toward them amen why because the bride got a right spirit and right attitude toward them amen brother just and again and say well if you're going to be hard and preaching preach to the bride amen preach heart amen lay it in lay it in lay it in by the grace of god amen but you don't have to be hard to those out there no no no no no whether it wants if they came to recognize it all and to surrender all and the yield to jesus they they don't care how hard it is lord you do what you got to do dude amen to get me ready you do what you've got to do amen so it's to take control of my life so lord amen whatever you got to do do it so it's not me who lives it's you lord you're living in me praise the lord and again that's why sometimes a lot of believers they don't they don't like this ministry they don't like that ministry oh he's too hard and it's like uh and uh some of we know uh and uh not here now of course been it's been a number of years ago and well it was uh i think it was brother lanny and brother jonathan's son our son tyler johnson's father and uh he was somewhere in ontario i'm not shore or alberta or somewhere and he met a newfoundlander and it was a professing believer and and when our brother met him he said oh newfoundland oh he said okay and they asked him he said do you know he said brother gerald lush oh yes he said oh you don't like him no why ah he said he he he got no sense of humor at all he's just hard that's all and thank god for the witness that our brother lanny gave he said what you believe that yeah well he said it can't be the same journal loss that i know he said because he does have a sense of humor but that that believer went on and i don't know where they are today amen i don't think they're any any normal what i call normal message church amen so so brother amen we're following jesus following god not following man by the grace of god and we pray the grace of god to our brother lanny amen amen we've experienced him for many years amen the lord bless him in his elderly years amen amen so god god help us god be with us amen to be living witness living testimonies of our lord jesus christ we amen you're going forth yeah sons and daughters of god reflecting god amen and oh yeah sometimes there is a sense of humor and and the power of god said he said even jesus had a sense of humor yeah he said when he talked about pharaoh and when he talked about this one time with that and he said this and this and this he said maybe it didn't seem like a humor to us but he said humor to them they think that jesus would say that about pharaoh the thing jesus was not pharaoh with the leader leader in israel at the time the roman leader amen they said this and said this and oh yeah jesus said things the way he said it could be humorous you want me to do that lord yes do that amen so god help us have a right attitude right spirit and brother help us to continue continue continue in the word it's not that we start and we stop here and that's it i'm a believer no no if you're a believer god is constantly continually feeding you god is constantly continually maturing you amen and leading you on to do this to do that amen the things that i know now and the things that we believe now but we didn't know that so many years ago amen amen and i'm sure brother jonathan knows it amen in in ministering the word of god amen oh oh well they they do maybe they'd like for me to minister what i ministered so many years ago amen some would but again we're going to minister what god has revealed to us now we're maturing as sons and daughters of god you're growing up amen now or the bible tells us is that true that that oh if you're just a child you're just still young in you in your your experience oh no god can't use you amen you've got to become more and more true mature in the word more and more mature in what god has done good and what god is doing and what god will do oh yes most definitely that's what god's looking for in you what god's looking for today and god will be there because why he you can keep amen revealing what he's done and he'll reveal what he's doing amen and what you're what he's going to do and you believe it and you stay with him and you'll keep going amen continue continue amen and there's scripture after scripture it's a scripture amen where god is exhorting the believers to continue amen it's not we start keep on going by the grace of god amen many believers started but they didn't keep going amen and there's some all due respect to them that maybe god has to take off off the face of the earth amen but if you're the seed of god you start and you keep on going you're you're still in the spirit sons daughters of god led by the spirit of god controlled by the spirit of god amen why because they are continuing with him in him by the grace of god amen and in john chapter 8. and verse 28 then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall he know that i am e and that i do nothing of myself amen neither do we amen not me is him oh god have mercy lord i pray grace lord that you're you're you're as real to us as your word to them amen that jesus is just not a historical creature amen he's the present tense amen he's with us in us now and he said as my father has taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me and the father has not left me alone amen i do always those things that please him and as he spake these words oh my that's tremendous he said i do always those things that please him can you say that well if you're in christ he's there to give you that anointing that's right oh yeah to do only those things that always do those things that please them amen and he said i do always those things that please him that's the word amen you're there as a believer you're there as a christian you're there as a son and daughter of god amen and you're doing what god wants you to do amen as he spake these words many believed on him amen and then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue amen we'll continue in the natural things of life what if it's spiritual amen are we praying for god help us to continue in the spiritual amen then said the jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue this is remember jesus said it if he applied to them applies to us amen amen if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples in deed amen are we here because we're continuing in the word or continuing in religion there's some are here because they're continuing in the word they love the word and they love jesus amen and oh it's a personal relationship amen and jesus is revealing his word to them oh yeah they know it thank you jesus amen but yet there are those that are just religious amen oh i believe this i believe god's not a prophet i i believe he did this y'all thank you lord amen i believe he's doing this amen what if he's doing it do you really believe he's what he's doing if you believe what he's doing you know what he's going to do because that what you're doing is going to lead on to what he will do amen but you got to continue in what he did and continue in what he's doing will do by the grace of god you're going to continue in it you've got to stay with it you've got to be share amen by the grace of god yeah stay with the word and he said if you continue it then are you my disciples indeed if you continue but if you don't continue you're not his disciple amen and ye shall know the truth faith amen and the truth shall make you free hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen brother let's believe the let's believe the word amen oh yeah that's what that's what the math or luke john said well but remember it's the truth faith comes by hearing the word faith comes by hearing the word amen god help us so if you continue continue continue to continue with him in his word you shall know the truth and if you don't continue with him it'll be just the letter of the word but not the truth it's not you're not going to have the faith that it's ordained to give you faith comes by hearing hearing by the word amen but you're only going to catch the faith as you continue in it keep on going he reveals this he reveals that he's going to line you up there line you up here keep you in mind there there stay with the word son and daughter amen so brother be continuing remaining stay amen permanently enduring this is continuing this is what continuing is all about is staying with the word you're going to be permanent in the word bring you in the word you're going to endure amen and you're going to remain in it amen and abide in the word oh yeah that's this is what it means to continue and and if you're not doing this then you're not continuing in the word amen amen god help us grace john and again verse 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free for the only if you continue in the word amen you're sincere and god knows you're sincere amen you love the lord he loves you amen and you're continuing because you want to go on and on and on to perfection by the grace of god amen and the truth shall make you free why because you continue steadfastly enduring remaining abiding staying permanently in the word yeah it's just not in and out in and out and there's a lot of people coming in and out with this doctrine the internet with that doctrine and they go on no for for the bride it is eternal life yeah that's why the bride continues because you stop continuing then you lose eternal life amen amen turn with me again to colossians chapter 1. colossians chapter 1. and verse nine and he said for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you amen and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding amen that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god amen so are we walking worthy of the lord unto all pleasing amen are we being fruitful in every good work giving god the glory give the glory to jesus oh yeah oh lord thank you for saving me yeah but go forth and reflect that salvation amen that's jesus well shall you reflect salvation yeah it's jesus amen and it says verse 10 that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god amen we're maturing we're not increasing in the knowledge of william branham in the knowledge of god amen oh not this church that church this preacher that preacher it's god amen and he says strengthen with all might according to his glorious power and unto all patience and longsuffering oh with joyfulness i'm going to bring it to you in another message the life of the believer oh long suffering oh yeah tribulation oh this this this we're going to experience this we're going to experience that all the negative things but i'll tell you it might put us down physically but it lifts us up spiritually amen how many are going to going to go through it and experience it with joy yes help us lord amen that we have such a relationship with jesus amen so one with jesus that we can rejoice in what we're suffering for his sake boy because he's my lord he's my savior he loves me amen he does this for me he does this for me amen god help us to love him i am god this is amazing as lord i gotta show these scriptures to the church i said what you're requiring in us what you're looking for in continuing what it means to continue to stay with the word permanently and in your just and when you what are you experiencing you're enduring and doing you got to endure physically amen amen and it says giving thanks unto the father which has made us mean to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son amen it's done it's past tense amen amen so we got the past tense experience oh they don't see it this one don't see it but we see it amen what you're saying you're you're this you're that yeah i am not you're going to be no i am that's your faith amen because according to your faith i am that i will be amen and that's why we keep pressing on pressing on amen we got the revelation what i am amen through jesus oh thank you lord we're going on to the greater greater greater perfection amen so he said giving thanks unto the father which has made us mean to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption yes we have redemption true is blood amen even the forgiveness of sins hallelujah god help us to be spiritual god of us to be spiritually minded and to have the understanding of what god has done what god is doing and what god will do amen grace he said who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature wonderful and by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions principalities or powers all things were created by him praise the lord and created for him amen let's give the glory to jesus amen amen praise the lord hallelujah and it says and he is before all things and by him all things consist lord grace that we've got the revelation that all i need is jesus amen because everything lord that i need is in jesus name amen all the blessings the encouragement amen eternal life it's in jesus name amen praise the lord and it says e is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen amen hallelujah preeminence because without him we can do nothing amen so we recognize that we need him for yes for the lowest to the highest blessings of god amen give him preeminence please love him for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and have he made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind yes amen god help us brother he's in in in you're born again soul body and spirit amen amen bring everything under his control amen to take out everything that was contrary to him amen and it says in you that were sometimes eliminated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled praise the lord in the body of his flesh he's done it through death to present you holy unblameable and unreprovable in his sight praise the lord brother hallelujah our faith bringing us into that oneness with jesus and we are perfect amen amen amen as somebody was preaching just for not long ago reason i don't know who it was now and they were saying oh you go ask the lord forgive me for this and the lord says for what amen oh for this that i did he said i don't see it and i don't know it why because when you're when you originally go in and to a relationship with jesus he forgives it's gone in the sea of forgiveness we remember but he don't this is amazing this is miraculous amen absolutely miraculous did i remember this you'll remember that because jesus don't amen brother he's there to give us that faith amen by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen amen thank god for that gift thank you jesus the devil is there to condemn you the devil is there to put you down jesus is there to lift you up amen the devil is accusing you of this this and this and jesus said they've done nothing it's gone amen god give us that faith oh yeah we've got it we've got a white god all of us have their faith to really catch the revelation of what we that what we experience in jesus what jesus has done for us god help us amen and it says that you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now at the reconcile praise the lord hallelujah in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable praise the lord amen through christ what he did for you and me is to present you blame present you unblameable alan reprovable in his sight amen grace amen amen brother no man can lay a charge against god's elect god help us to believe faith redemption praise the lord i'm redeemed your ring oh my devil was there to accuse us there was there to point to the weakness of the flesh but jesus is there to point to our faith amen amen hallelujah thank god that jesus is there the devil says this jesus said wait a minute i delivered i cleaned you i washed it all away it's gone in the sea of forgetfulness don't you believe the devil amen it is jesus honoring our faith amen he said and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now at the reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present your holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight praise the lord you're perfect in the sight of god amen if you continue in the faith amen if you continue again in the faith the scripture and even old and old and new testament is highlighting continue continue continue it is by faith amen stay you started keep on going amen if you started and he's redeemed you and he's forgiven you you keep on going you're you're you're clean you're perfect i am oh yeah but you're not you're not going to be self-righteous you're going to say thank you jesus thank you jesus you did it amen thank you so if you continue in the faith amen but now notice oh i'm continuing to faith i believe this i believe that wait a minute grounded and settled if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard amen and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister praise the name of the lord hallelujah turn with me to colossians chapter 4. i've got a number of other scriptures but i'd love to narrow it down amen praise the lord well no trouble to understand why that the world is why we're so long the word is eternal amen brother we go back to eternity come all down through time go back to it because go to eternity again see we come we come from eternity and the devil trip tricked us in in in the garden of eden and so on about us subject to time but god came down with his promise hallelujah to deliver us to redeem us amen bring us back in contact with eternity again hallelujah hallelujah and in colossians 4 and verse 1 masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven continue in prayer yep continue in prayer amen and brother it's not necessary not just the prayer on your knees no indeed yes pray on your knees yes but pray when you walk pray when you're just sitting down pray when you're driving pray when you're doing this yeah there's not there's nothing but you consult the lord yeah oh yes again it's like i said no matter what job i was in out there in the world and so on i did this did this do that and i i never left the lord out of it amen i remember even even as just doing this in in a department store whatever and i oh i could see myself now by the grace of god moving over to there was a thing that i had their encounter that i would work on and i would lay my hands on it i said lord i need you i said please lord i pray your grace to be with me today and give me your wisdom and leadership oh yeah and then i've gone and when i even when i went to as it were management and i was manager of just so many departments there and told me there and i've gone and i've said lord i said i need you to to give me the wisdom i need to do this lord so help me lord oh yeah i never left you i never left god i didn't just go do it and oh yeah that's good thank you no no i did it for the lord amen and there was other issues and somebody wanted to know this one and i said well i said just one minute now so i would maybe go in inside somewhere there somewhere and and and pray lord give me your wisdom it's like i said too there one day there that i was part management and another one a little step higher than me in management and he uh he wanted me to go tell that customer a certain thing but i knew it was a lie and i said i i said if you want to tell the law you tell it i said not me i said i'm not going to do it. so he he had to go tell it i didn't do it but they didn't mind until finally just one day i was stood there supervising some of the areas there and that manager came out and he said excuse me he said i got a question he said do you preach i said yes sometimes we have cottage meetings i said and i and i speak there sometimes but not all the time i said oh i i thought you you were more like that you were like a preacher the way you're acting and talking sometimes okay i said that's me okay that's fine it didn't bother didn't harm him no no but he just wanted to confirm it yeah and that was an american and today as far as i know he's back in the united states yeah so again what is your what reflection are you giving in your job what reflection have you given in your job you know regarding that you're a christian do they know you're a christian did they oh i'll trust you because you're you're a christian yeah god help us and for the glory of god but they i don't know why it had to be again had to be the glory of god that why would people when when i was just a young boy and even younger than our jonathan jr and uh younger than that and the friends that i that i used to get around with and go around with in my hometown they were there and they were always getting to swear yeah they would come over and they'll try to get me to swear i said that's funny why do you want me to do that for no i said i'm not going to swear to me i i just that it just wasn't my nature you know and so on i said no i said you can go do it yourself but i'm not going to do it yeah and they do that and they do that and they try to do this and then another issue took place and i was maybe 9 or 10 years old and my mother's brother died and i can see it now and my my mother did she sat down and she was oh my she was so she was grieving and she was next to the stove that we had back then this many years ago and i remember she had some bills in her hand two dollar bills and one dollar bills back then and i remember she was so she got to a place there she just lifted the side of that stove and threw it into the stove and it burned the money and that she was so overtaken and overwhelmed by the grief of the passing of her of her brother i remember visiting him before with with an older brother bidding him before he died but we were in that house there and our house there's it's not there now it's gone and uh so my mother and father was oh my they said get your get your and they called me called me called me i said what do you want oh they said girl we got some flowers there for for your uncle we want you to write a note and put on the flowers i said me yes they said we we we believe you can do it okay i said i'll write i'll write it so i wrote i wrote a little note concerning death life death and heaven and so on and it was something that if i could remember it now i don't uh what it was it was it was the verse actually the verse of a of an old-fashioned hymn concerning death and resurrection oh he said wonderful that's that's the core that's exactly the way it should be thank you and so on so brother sister let god control you thought word indeed yeah amen give the glory to jesus you know and again i i've had to do that by grace how come you do this i come to i said well i can only leave it with the lord i said it's god he helps me you know and so on great i pray that you're giving that witness to the people you work for amen or to the people that work for you you give the glory to jesus amen and brother again in colossians 4 that i read masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven amen continue in prayer again oh my we're encouraged over and over again continue continue continue don't just start continue continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving amen with all praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak amen and walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time amen and let your speech be always with grace season with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man for the glory of god amen brother we're instructed over and over again to continue in the word to continue in the faith by the grace of god praise the lord there's a number of other scriptures here but i'll let i'll read the last two verses here last two scriptures in first timothy chapter four praise the lord first timothy chapter four we try to bring these thoughts to a conclusion but to leave you with this understanding if you start continue amen amen continue in the faith that you're going to grow more and more spiritual get more and more mature in the lord by the grace of god amen first timothy 4 he said in verse 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen that's the truth so god allows us to stay with the holy spirit and the doctrine of jesus amen in verse 14 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon those things and give thyself holy to them and thy profiting that thy profiting may appear to all amen you're going to be a wonderful witness take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them amen you've got to continue in it not just saying oh i believe it i believe it and that's it you go on no no continuing it worshiping praising god amen take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee amen see the importance of continuing in the word amen continuing to grow in the word continuing to mature in the word amen continuing to be a witness of the word and reflect the word praise the lord and i'll read one more scripture to continue in the goodness of god hebrews 13. and he said let brotherly love continue amen praise the lord and be not forgetful to entertain entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares amen and remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body so brother let brotherly love continue you don't just start off with it no and let it become cold no no let brotherly love continue by the grace of almighty god amen just bear with me you don't have to turn to it i'll just read this amen thank god but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you this is tremendous it's tremendous therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live amen by the grace of god for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen and if you're not led by the spirit you're not his child but if you're born of god you'll be led by the spirit of god amen for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father amen the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also for also glorified together brother thank god for the oneness that we have with jesus amen amen praise the lord and it says behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fail severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off amen god help us to stay with the goodness of jesus by the grace of god amen just one scripture if you want to turn with me to this one first john chapter 2. amen god bless us continue continue continuing the word not up and down in or out just stay with the word amen say with what god has done yes but let's stay with what god is doing and what god will do amen because those continuing the word are going to continue on to the faith of the rapture amen by the glory of god so in first john 2 and beginning to read at verse 20 but ye have an unction from the holy one and you know all things i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that deny it that jesus is the christ is antichrist that denieth the father and the son and whosoever denied the son the same as not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son he said as the father also amen therefore he said let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning and if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father amen and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life amen is continuing in the faith by the grace of god continuing in the word not the letter of the word but the spirit of the word amen that we be controlled by the holy ghost amen god bless his word and again there was still a couple other scriptures and there were some thoughts again in this book right here concerning the images of christ that our prophet preached in 1959 amen and brother it's a truth even today god help us amen the lord bless you amen let's sing praise the lord amen amen number 336 336 to god be the glory great things he hath done amen so loved ye the world that he gave us his son who yielded his life an
