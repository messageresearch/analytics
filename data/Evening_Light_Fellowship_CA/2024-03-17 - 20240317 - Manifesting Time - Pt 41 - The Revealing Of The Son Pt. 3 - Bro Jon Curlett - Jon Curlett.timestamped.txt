[34:08] 1 Psalm chapter 1 says blessed is the

[34:13] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[34:16] Sinners nor sth in the seed of the
[34:17] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[34:20] of the Lord and in his law do he
[34:22] meditate day and night and he shall be
[34:25] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[34:27] water that bring forth his fruit in his
[34:30] season his Leaf also shall not wither
[34:33] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[34:36] amen God bless you you can have your
[34:37] seats this morning and we're continuing
[34:39] in our series on manifesting time and
[34:41] I'm taking a third series or third uh
[34:45] service on this this title of the
[34:46] revealing of the son of man and I want
[34:48] to pick up right where we left off last
[34:50] service we're talking about adoption of
[34:52] course and we said adoption is the
[34:53] revealing of the attribute revealing of
[34:56] the purpose revealing of the word of God
[34:58] and it's being expressed in us and it's
[35:00] the it's the thought of God that he had
[35:01] for us before the foundation of the
[35:03] world coming into reality in its Earthly
[35:05] fullness and this happens we know
[35:07] adoption happens when God can trust us
[35:10] fully and I want to just get into just a
[35:13] a bit of a side note here before we
[35:15] start this service because we can look
[35:18] at adoption and so many things and we
[35:19] speak about power and we speak about
[35:21] Authority and all these things but
[35:23] adoption is about expressing Christ not
[35:25] me it's about expressing Christ not you
[35:28] it's about expressing the word so it is
[35:30] not power and adoption where we take our
[35:32] thoughts and our minds as we would say
[35:34] naturally or carnally but rather when we
[35:36] come to adoption our being is so
[35:38] surrendered to his that when we think it
[35:41] is not our thoughts it is his thoughts
[35:43] when we speak it is not his words it is
[35:45] our words our attitude is his attitude
[35:47] our reaction is his reaction it is a son
[35:50] or daughter of God that is completely a
[35:53] and fully uh surrendered to the holy
[35:56] spirit in their lives amen in other
[35:58] words an adopted son or daughter of God
[36:00] will reveal Christ it won't reveal them
[36:02] it'll reveal Christ now it's God working
[36:04] through us and in our little quirks and
[36:06] in our little personalities and these
[36:08] different things you can see that even
[36:09] in the disciples you had the fiery ones
[36:11] you had the calm ones you had the the
[36:13] the The Quiet Ones you had the
[36:15] introspective ones you had the ones that
[36:17] would go out and and just run right up
[36:19] to something you know Bulldog Faith like
[36:20] Peter had then you had John the quieter
[36:23] more introspective one but the holy
[36:24] spirit in each one of them projected
[36:26] Christ it revealed Christ in their time
[36:28] amen and we know that his children were
[36:31] an expression of the father each and
[36:33] every one of us and and my boys and my
[36:35] daughter even no matter how much they
[36:37] might not want to they have to express
[36:39] me because there's a part of me inside
[36:41] of them and it's built into them and and
[36:42] we're no different we all have the same
[36:44] father amen we all have the same DNA and
[36:47] what is it it's the word DNA it's Christ
[36:49] the word inside of us so we're word born
[36:51] that's what the new birth is is it we
[36:53] are word born by the Holy Spirit and
[36:55] therefore the word has to be what comes
[36:57] out of our life life now we can see this
[36:59] in the Old Testament as we talk about
[37:00] the revealing of the son and really it's
[37:02] the revealing of the father through the
[37:04] son or through the child and we can see
[37:06] this in the lives of the Believers in
[37:08] the Old Testament and we see there the
[37:10] types and shadows and that's all it is
[37:12] is types and shadows it's not perfect
[37:14] but it's a reflection of what's supposed
[37:15] to happen in the New Testament under the
[37:17] law nothing could be perfect but it
[37:19] could be a type and it could be a shadow
[37:21] and brother Brown would say this he's
[37:23] speaking of of Christ he says he
[37:25] expressed himself in Joseph born amongst
[37:28] denomination his Brethren they hated him
[37:31] without a cause because he was spiritual
[37:33] he saw visions and God was with them now
[37:36] Joseph was unproven Joseph had had not
[37:40] really done anything great in his life
[37:41] he had made no great decisions and yet
[37:44] God was with him why he was a child of
[37:46] God and it's that simple amen he could
[37:48] interpret dreams and his brothers hated
[37:50] him he was sold by his Brethren by
[37:52] almost 30 pieces of SE silver just
[37:54] exactly like he was sold by Judas a
[37:56] scariot one of his Brethren by 30 pieces
[37:59] of silver he was thrown into a ditch and
[38:01] supposed to be dead that he's thrown
[38:03] into that ditch and then he's taken up
[38:05] and from there he went to the right hand
[38:07] of pharaoh okay we're speaking of the
[38:09] revealing of Christ the revealing of the
[38:11] son he says in the dudgeon how he
[38:14] suffered there the Butler and the baker
[38:16] one of them lost and one was saved one
[38:19] of them lost the other one saved just as
[38:20] on the cross when he was in his prison
[38:23] house tacked to the cross for our sins
[38:25] and became a prisoner one Thief was lost
[38:28] and one was saved see it's just exactly
[38:30] then he Joseph would come to the right
[38:32] hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed
[38:34] that had the vision that he would sit at
[38:36] the king's feet and all authority in
[38:38] Egypt was given to him his vision had
[38:41] come to
[38:42] pass then he steps back he says he might
[38:45] have studied of it many times while he
[38:47] was in that prison down there his
[38:49] whiskers growing out and so forth but he
[38:51] studied it he said because someday his
[38:54] vision had to come to pass though it
[38:57] linger it's got to happen when God said
[39:00] so it's got to happen he says it's a
[39:02] Vindicated prophet and it has to come to
[39:05] pass because it's God's word today
[39:08] Joseph went through years and years of
[39:11] sitting under the vision without the
[39:13] Fulfillment but what he didn't realize
[39:16] was in the time that it was darkest the
[39:18] vision was still being fulfilled the
[39:21] situation was preparing him for the
[39:23] vision to be
[39:25] fulfilled but Joseph understood it
[39:28] Joseph understood it I'm asking you
[39:30] church this morning where is your vision
[39:32] what is the prophecy what is the word
[39:34] you're sitting under because we can sit
[39:36] here so many times and say nothing's
[39:38] happening nothing's moving the prophecy
[39:41] has gone forth the message of the the
[39:43] hour has come forth we've received our
[39:45] last sign Christ is here in the bride
[39:48] what's happening and we're stuck in this
[39:50] and we're stuck in that we're stuck in
[39:51] our sickness in our minds and our
[39:53] attitudes and our families whatever it
[39:55] might be but Joseph had the attitude
[39:58] through all of those things he
[39:59] understood God is with me God gave me
[40:02] the word God gave me the vision
[40:04] therefore it has to come to pass even
[40:06] when it doesn't look like anything's
[40:08] happening amen that's where we're
[40:10] sitting this morning is we're under a
[40:12] vision we're under an end time Vision
[40:14] we're under the Book of Revelation and
[40:16] we're under Revelations 10 we've moved
[40:19] from 107 into 108 where we take the book
[40:22] and we prophesy and things happen
[40:25] according to the word that God has
[40:26] already given that he's already declared
[40:28] to us this morning amen that's where
[40:30] we're sitting though it lingers notice
[40:32] it says though it lingers it's got to
[40:35] happen we can sit there and we can't
[40:37] focus on the lingering we've got to
[40:39] focus on the it's got to happen because
[40:41] it is the unchanging unfailing word of
[40:44] God this morning it doesn't fail his
[40:46] word cannot return unto him void and
[40:49] Joseph knew he had a real gift he had a
[40:51] real vision and he knew the vision had
[40:54] to come into fruition so whether he was
[40:56] in Piper's house a slave or whether he
[41:00] was in prison a
[41:02] slave the vision still had to come to
[41:04] pass where you at this
[41:07] morning whether you're in a prison house
[41:10] it feels like or whether you're on top
[41:11] of the mountain it matters not the
[41:13] vision has to come to pass the word has
[41:15] to come forth he says now we find Joseph
[41:18] then that no man could touch or come to
[41:20] Pharaoh without first seen Joseph no man
[41:22] can come to the father only by his son
[41:25] and when Joseph left the throne they
[41:26] sounded Trump
[41:27] every knee bow Joseph is coming forth
[41:30] Glory says someday every knee will bow
[41:32] and every tongue will confess when he
[41:34] leaves the Throne of his father see to
[41:36] come forth everybody will bear witness
[41:38] that he's the son of God he says it's
[41:40] too late then do it now amen I said last
[41:43] service there's Mercy now but there
[41:45] comes a time where the scripture says
[41:47] let's he let he that's holy be holy
[41:48] still and he that's filthy be filthy
[41:50] still there is no changing There's No
[41:52] Going Back you are what you are then he
[41:55] says now we notice through the types
[41:58] we could take even David going off his
[42:00] throne rejected by his own people going
[42:02] up the same Mountain the Mount of Olives
[42:04] as he's going over to his prison he was
[42:06] going to his prison house because he was
[42:08] rejected of his Brethren and of his own
[42:10] people he went up weeping he says that
[42:13] was the spirit of Christ in him to be
[42:16] rejected see we want the revealing of
[42:19] Christ in us but it's the full
[42:22] thing we have to suffer as he suffered
[42:25] amen if we're going to reign with him we
[42:27] got to suffer with him and the spirit of
[42:29] Christ in us will take us through that
[42:30] suffering the same as it'll take us
[42:31] through the
[42:33] victory he says as he looked up over
[42:35] Jerusalem and wept and said Jerusalem
[42:37] how of a rejected King 800 years later
[42:40] the son of David stood on Jerusalem up
[42:42] above there and rejected and wept over
[42:45] Jerusalem and said now your hour has
[42:48] come he says that's right now catch this
[42:52] this is in the message Christ is the
[42:53] mystery of God
[42:54] revealed he says all those SA typed him
[42:58] just in type but he says but yet the
[43:02] mystery was hid Now Catch This those men
[43:06] didn't know what they were
[43:10] doing he says they only knew that they
[43:12] were led by the spirit to do some now
[43:16] holding it back in the last days God he
[43:18] was holding it back in the last days for
[43:20] the great Revelation but expressing it
[43:22] expressing himself in Moses and David
[43:24] and Joseph and Elijah on down through we
[43:26] could take each one of those prophets
[43:28] and bring their lives out and show it it
[43:30] express Jesus Christ perfectly and
[43:33] exactly yet he says never giving his
[43:37] secret in full waiting to make it known
[43:40] when in the last day as he promised
[43:44] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[43:46] see before he could express it we in the
[43:49] time and in the season and the promise
[43:51] of full comprehension full realization
[43:54] amen full adoption full Redemption now
[43:57] we can look at those men and and we can
[43:59] say Amen cuz it's history and we can see
[44:01] the words written and we can see you
[44:03] know that we have hindsight is 2020 we
[44:06] can Monday Morning Quarterback it we can
[44:07] see what they did and we've seen what
[44:09] Christ did and we can see how all those
[44:11] prophecies lined up and they had the
[44:12] same attitude same cry in their hearts
[44:15] the same Victory and all of those
[44:16] elements were portrayed amen but let's
[44:19] not just leave it with the man and
[44:20] that's not just leave it with the
[44:22] ministers or the prophets because we can
[44:24] also see a bride of Christ traveling
[44:26] through those pages of the scriptures
[44:29] amen and we can see it starts with Eve
[44:32] and so often what happens is we put Eve
[44:34] out because of her failure but you have
[44:36] to realize that Eve was the mystery
[44:39] revealing of the fullness of God because
[44:42] remember what the scripture says in
[44:44] Genesis it says God created Man In His
[44:47] Image he says what he said in the image
[44:51] of God created he
[44:54] him there's the mystery but then he says
[44:58] male and female created he them that's
[45:02] the mystery revealed the mystery was
[45:04] inside of him Adam but then the mystery
[45:07] was pulled out and now you see two there
[45:09] not just one amen that's what was
[45:11] happening there and we see that it's
[45:13] Christ and a bride being revealed
[45:15] because Adam and his bride under the
[45:18] same name as we are the same name of
[45:20] Christ was the revealing of the fullness
[45:22] of God that was the image of God fully
[45:25] revealed was Adam and his bride under
[45:28] the same name amen but we see that now
[45:31] through scriptures we see Hannah we see
[45:33] Mary we see Ruth and and then we go and
[45:36] we see
[45:38] Rahab the The Prostitute yet no
[45:42] less the type of the bride of Christ
[45:44] showing it doesn't matter if you're
[45:45] raised in church or you're raised on the
[45:47] streets if you come in broken or you
[45:49] come in just just as clean as you could
[45:51] possibly come in it matters not there is
[45:54] a bride that is being prepared and we
[45:56] can see the shadows and the types all
[45:58] through scriptures amen we know what
[46:00] happened uh uh at Calvary was that
[46:04] Christ was smoked and out of his side
[46:06] came
[46:07] what water and
[46:10] blood it's the life in the spirit it's
[46:13] the life of the word that came out it
[46:14] was the bride being brought out of him
[46:17] and we see what happened on the day of
[46:18] Pentecost was what that God poured
[46:20] himself into that church to make her
[46:22] live remember he took a side he took a
[46:24] rib out of Adam and he made it live then
[46:27] what did he do take out of Christ he
[46:28] took something out of his side and he
[46:30] made it live on the day of Pentecost
[46:32] amen so today we've got a redeemed bride
[46:34] a spotless bride a bride without wrinkle
[46:36] and what is it we had Alpha in the day
[46:38] of Pentecost when he poured his Spirit
[46:40] out and now he's pouring his Spirit out
[46:42] again in the Omega age and it's the same
[46:44] Christ being revealed in the same kind
[46:46] of Bride and the same kind of woman amen
[46:48] what is it it's bone of his bone flesh
[46:50] of his flesh body of his body Spirit of
[46:53] his spirit it's word upon word it's the
[46:55] exact same thing there is no difference
[46:57] it the only difference is the portion
[46:59] that each and you and I have but we're
[47:00] made from the exact same thing look at
[47:03] what Paul said Paul's the greatest
[47:05] preacher aside from Christ he has the
[47:07] full revelation of the whole mystery you
[47:10] can look in Paul and he reveals the
[47:12] bride perfectly he reveals Christ
[47:13] perfectly listen he says this in his age
[47:16] this is the alpha Church remember Christ
[47:18] is Alpha and Omega here's the alpha he
[47:20] says do we begin to commend ourselves or
[47:23] need we as some others Epistles of
[47:24] recommendation to you or letters of com
[47:27] ation
[47:28] Commendation he says as Ministry do we
[47:30] need to come in and have some brother
[47:32] vouch for us he says you are our
[47:35] Epistles written in our hearts he says
[47:37] you're the letters you're the proof
[47:39] you're the Commendation he says and
[47:41] you're known and read of all men for as
[47:44] much he says as you are manifestly
[47:46] declared that means you are the visible
[47:49] the apparent declaration it is literally
[47:52] the revealing of the mystery it's the
[47:54] reality of the word that he preached he
[47:56] says you are manifestly declared to be
[47:59] the what Epistle of Paul no the Epistle
[48:03] of Christ he says you are the work you
[48:07] are the account you are the letter of
[48:09] Christ you are the
[48:11] literal embodiment of Christ it's you
[48:16] today he says he says Minister by us the
[48:21] preaching of the word you've got to sit
[48:22] under it because it produces an Epistle
[48:24] of Christ amen he says written not with
[48:27] ink but with what the spirit of the
[48:29] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[48:32] fleshy in fleshly natural bodies in
[48:35] tables of the heart now listen to what
[48:37] the prophet of God said he says then see
[48:40] God came down and the character of God
[48:42] was Christ he was the reflection he was
[48:45] God made visible in the beginning was
[48:47] God he says he wasn't even God then no
[48:50] God is an object of worship the only
[48:52] thing he was was the Eternal and in him
[48:54] were attributes and those attributes
[48:56] were thoughts and those thoughts were
[48:58] expressed to words and word was made
[49:01] manifest what is it he says it's all God
[49:06] becoming
[49:08] tangible he says and you are a part of
[49:12] God you're a tangible part of God you
[49:15] are the Epistles of Christ seen and read
[49:17] of all men he says and Jesus came to
[49:19] redeem those that were on the Lamb's
[49:21] Book of Life before the foundation of
[49:23] the world it was in God's thoughts and
[49:25] that's what he come to redeem
[49:27] he says then as soon as it strikes to
[49:29] them they see it because the life is in
[49:31] there but if the life isn't in there
[49:33] then what can they do they don't see it
[49:35] they'll never see it and the whole thing
[49:38] is Jesus said at that day he says if
[49:41] they see it and then brother Braham says
[49:43] now the whole thing is the whole purpose
[49:45] of this is at that day you'll know that
[49:47] I'm in the Father the father in me I in
[49:50] you and you in me he says the whole
[49:53] thing is God becoming material
[49:57] now we're speaking of adoption but watch
[49:59] what brother Bram does here this is 1964
[50:02] after the opening of the seals he's
[50:05] understanding there's a shift and there
[50:06] we'll see this as we go through adoption
[50:08] is there's there's this blending of the
[50:10] sunship and the daughter ship of adopted
[50:13] sons and daughters and the brideship
[50:15] because it's the same thing but it's in
[50:17] two different types and shadows and he
[50:19] doesn't say it's like adopted Sons he
[50:21] says it's like a husband and wife
[50:23] becoming one together God and His Church
[50:27] becoming one what is it it's God
[50:29] becoming the fullness of material
[50:32] expressed in flesh amen it's God
[50:35] expressed God revealing himself and it's
[50:37] in a love relationship that was the
[50:39] Perfect Image in the Garden of Eden
[50:42] that's what Christ is being revealed as
[50:44] that's the full revealing of God is
[50:46] Christ with his
[50:47] bride
[50:49] Amen brother Brown would say this he
[50:51] says you're a part of God I'm a part of
[50:55] God see but I'm not all of God and
[50:57] neither are you all of God see he says
[51:00] it's attributes of God upon us now as
[51:03] Sons adopted by Jesus Christ when before
[51:07] the foundation of the world they're
[51:08] written within you and it's the working
[51:10] of the holy spirit that draws this out
[51:12] of us amen that light of the word
[51:14] flashes across us the atmosphere of the
[51:16] Holy Spirit flashes across us and life
[51:18] is quickened inside of us and once it
[51:19] starts you can't kill it you cannot kill
[51:22] it it's an eternal seed of God Amen
[51:25] Christ came and he was the manif ested
[51:26] word he was the Living Word he was the
[51:28] real reality of the word and whether the
[51:30] the priesthood liked it or not he was
[51:32] the word and it doesn't matter whether
[51:35] we accept it to make it the word the
[51:37] word is the word and it stands alone and
[51:39] it proves itself amen but it was the
[51:41] thought of God that became flesh and the
[51:44] purpose of the word of God is to produce
[51:46] something that lives it is not a dead
[51:49] word it is a Living Word and its purpose
[51:52] is to produce living people amen this is
[51:55] what Jesus said he said it is the spirit
[51:57] that quickeneth the flesh profiteth
[52:00] nothing if the flesh profits nothing
[52:02] then why are we focused on it why do we
[52:04] rely on it why do we look to it why do
[52:07] we let it talk to us come on now it's
[52:10] the spirit that quickeneth he says the
[52:12] words that I speak unto you they are
[52:15] spirit and they are life now I want you
[52:18] to catch something here because Spirits
[52:21] need
[52:22] bodies in other words if his words are
[52:25] spirit and they are life they need a
[52:27] body to produce life amen they need a
[52:31] body remember they have no natural body
[52:33] of their own I'll touch on godhead just
[52:35] for a moment because the scripture says
[52:37] God is a spirit he says no man has seen
[52:40] the father God the Father the original
[52:43] the great spirit if we could call that
[52:45] but what happened then is he he he
[52:48] created a body and it was the pillar of
[52:50] fire and that is a visible body that can
[52:53] interact with with Humanity we can see
[52:56] it with our five senses if God would
[52:58] open our eyes he can do it visibly many
[53:00] people have seen the pillar of fire amen
[53:02] and what was it it was God creating a
[53:05] body for his Spirit to dwell in and what
[53:08] was it that was the son of God it was
[53:11] the theophany of God it was the body of
[53:13] God and God took his spirit and he put
[53:15] it in that body and that became the
[53:18] visible God that is God in a body and
[53:22] that is now what that is Christ what
[53:24] does Christ mean the anointed one
[53:27] Christ is the body of God it is the
[53:29] fullness of God poured into that body
[53:32] and it was God stepping into reality so
[53:34] that creation could be interactive with
[53:36] him it was God being able to come down
[53:38] and touch us so Christ is the visible
[53:41] God he's a created body for the spirit
[53:43] of God to dwell in amen God a Spirit
[53:46] dwelling in a body and he made that body
[53:49] God the body became God as soon as God
[53:52] dwelt in it that's the only God we will
[53:54] ever see is Christ it is is the visible
[53:57] God to us amen what was it God joined
[54:00] himself to that body he put his Spirit
[54:01] within it and he he declared them to be
[54:04] one in the same thing Jesus said I and
[54:06] my father are
[54:07] one he was the revealing of the spirit
[54:10] of God inside of him that was God look
[54:12] at what Paul said in Colossians he says
[54:14] giving thanks unto the Father which hath
[54:16] made us meat to be partakers of the
[54:18] inheritance of the Saints in light catch
[54:21] that in light it says who had delivered
[54:24] us from the power of darkness and
[54:26] translated us into the kingdom of his
[54:28] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[54:30] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[54:32] of sins he's speaking of Christ now he
[54:35] says who is the image of the invisible
[54:38] God the firstborn of every creature
[54:41] that's Genesis 1 amen and let's go there
[54:43] real quick because it says and God said
[54:46] let there be light and there was light
[54:48] and God saw the light that it was good
[54:50] and God divided the light from the
[54:53] darkness amen so what happened in
[54:56] Genesis 1:3 is God created a pillar of
[55:00] fire he did not create the sun moon and
[55:02] stars that doesn't happen till
[55:04] genesis4 this is light this is the image
[55:07] of God being created this is the body of
[55:10] God being created this is the Son of God
[55:12] being created a son is created there is
[55:14] no Eternal son amen it's a body created
[55:17] and what happens is God stepped into
[55:19] that and created everything through that
[55:21] body now that is the embodiment of God
[55:24] Amen so what happened happens we see
[55:26] then that God put a distinction between
[55:29] himself and everything else and
[55:32] scripture says God is light and there's
[55:34] no variableness neither shadow of
[55:36] turning in him there's no change in him
[55:38] right and God said I am God and nothing
[55:41] else is God I am the standard I am the
[55:43] light I am the truth all of these things
[55:45] amen darkness is the absence of God
[55:48] that's all it is and without God I don't
[55:51] care how good it sounds how good it
[55:52] looks how emotionally supportive it is
[55:55] it isn't God
[55:57] God is truth he is light
[55:59] Amen in 1 John 1: 15 it says then this
[56:02] is the message that we have heard and
[56:05] declare unto you that God is light and
[56:06] in him is no Darkness at all so this is
[56:09] literally God creating a body to step
[56:12] into and that body is what created
[56:14] everything else through that body he
[56:15] worked it's
[56:17] Christ we see that in verse 16 if we go
[56:19] back to Colossians it says for by him
[56:21] who Christ he says were all things
[56:24] created that are in heaven that are in
[56:25] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[56:28] be Thrones or dominions or
[56:29] principalities or Powers all things were
[56:32] created by Him and for him and he is
[56:35] before all things and by him all things
[56:40] consist what is it it's God behind the
[56:43] mask it's God hidden in a body amen it's
[56:46] the nature the attributes of God all
[56:49] expressed why he's word born remember
[56:52] that John says in the beginning was the
[56:53] word the word was with God
[56:56] and then the Word was God that shift is
[56:59] when he created the word came out and it
[57:01] created a being and he stepped into it
[57:03] the word didn't just going to be with
[57:05] God the word became God and he stepped
[57:07] in and he clothed himself in his word he
[57:10] clothed himself in his his attributes
[57:11] and he became the expression the reality
[57:13] the Fulfillment of his own word right
[57:16] there in Genesis
[57:17] 1:3 it says now he who Christ is the
[57:20] head of the church what is church called
[57:24] out ones what happened at C
[57:26] he called out a bride amen what happened
[57:30] is he pulled them out it was Christ and
[57:32] the bride as a type seen in Adam and his
[57:34] bride in the in the Garden of Eden he
[57:36] says who is the beginning the firstborn
[57:39] from the dead that in all things he
[57:41] might have the preeminence for it
[57:42] pleased the father that in him should
[57:45] all fullness dwell in other words
[57:47] there's none other that has the fullness
[57:48] of God in them this is it this is the
[57:50] revelation of God is Christ amen we
[57:53] don't worship that body or that man but
[57:55] we worship the god that says this is
[57:57] me God wraps himself in whatever form he
[58:01] wants and we worship whatever he reveals
[58:03] to be him amen it's the full expression
[58:05] of God we accept it and we worship it
[58:08] because that's what God told us to do he
[58:10] revealed himself to us that way look at
[58:12] the way Paul says it in 2 Corinthians he
[58:14] says to wit that God was in
[58:17] Christ God was in Christ he says
[58:20] reconciling the world unto himself not
[58:22] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[58:24] committed unto us what the word of
[58:27] reconciliation that literally means the
[58:29] word of atonement or restoration to
[58:31] favor what is it it's the gospel the
[58:33] good news that you can come back amen
[58:35] that we've got full access to the throne
[58:37] of God Amen so we see in the beginning
[58:39] God needed a body and he created it and
[58:42] he stepped into it and he had a Heavenly
[58:45] Body and then he comes down and he had
[58:46] an Earthly body and what was it it was
[58:48] to express himself fully so he does it
[58:52] in Adam and out of Adam he pulls a bride
[58:55] and they fall so what does God have to
[58:57] do he has to go and he has to get
[58:58] another body remember the scripture says
[59:01] a body hast thou created me and God
[59:03] steps into it he redeems his bride and
[59:06] pulls out of that side another body what
[59:09] is it it's a bride that's prepared for
[59:11] him and what happens is that is that on
[59:13] the day of Pentecost what happens is
[59:15] that Pillar of Fire right which is the
[59:18] the literally the body of God the life
[59:19] of God comes down and it distributes
[59:22] itself over that body and it makes it
[59:24] live and it is what it is the revealing
[59:27] the full revealing of Christ it's the
[59:29] full revealing of God all over again
[59:31] just as Adam and Eve were amen and that
[59:33] Holy Spirit today is going and trying to
[59:35] find the rest of that word body cuz when
[59:37] the last portion of that word body comes
[59:40] then we get to go there's nothing to
[59:41] hinder now we're all together we're all
[59:44] baptized into that one body we can be
[59:45] gathered to one in Christ as the
[59:47] scripture requires and we can go and
[59:49] then all that's left is Judgment for the
[59:51] Gentiles at least amen so when we're
[59:54] born again by the Holy Spirit it shows
[59:56] knows where we come from because the
[59:57] spirit of God is seeking out what the
[1:00:01] originals the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:03] that were in him amen now we know the
[1:00:05] new birth is when we receive the Holy
[1:00:07] Spirit into our souls it's not a church
[1:00:09] experience it's not an atmosphere it's
[1:00:10] not an emotion it's not shouting it's
[1:00:13] not screaming it's not speaking in
[1:00:14] tongues those are all fine but they
[1:00:16] don't mean you've got the Holy Ghost by
[1:00:18] no means amen the Holy Ghost is the
[1:00:20] literal life of God coming to the
[1:00:21] believer that was the tongues of Fire
[1:00:23] coming down on the day of Pentecost it
[1:00:25] was the literal life of God coming down
[1:00:27] and distributing itself into a bride
[1:00:30] amen into a body into adopted into Sons
[1:00:32] and Daughters of God rather it's a
[1:00:34] confirmation of who we
[1:00:35] are amen it's only for Sons and
[1:00:39] Daughters of
[1:00:40] God brother B would call the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] the token he says it's your token it's
[1:00:44] your proof that you're supposed to be
[1:00:46] going to heaven that you've got eternal
[1:00:48] life he said God's Everlasting Eternal
[1:00:51] Lo Eternal token it's eternal life by
[1:00:54] the Eternal God and anything that had a
[1:00:56] beginning has an end and everything had
[1:00:59] a beginning besides God and God is the
[1:01:01] only for form of eternal life there is
[1:01:04] and when God places his holy spirit in
[1:01:06] you which is
[1:01:08] God let let's not mince words the holy
[1:01:12] spirit is God in you he says and when
[1:01:15] God places himself within you you're as
[1:01:18] Eternal as God is why because you're a
[1:01:21] part of him because you become a son or
[1:01:23] daughter of God and you are displaying
[1:01:26] his word he says hallelujah I feel
[1:01:28] religious that's true God identifies it
[1:01:32] himself he says you've got eternal life
[1:01:35] and that is God in you now some preach
[1:01:38] that when you get the Holy Ghost you are
[1:01:40] immediately adopted that you're placed
[1:01:42] as an adopted son or an adopted daughter
[1:01:44] of God and I'm not saying that's
[1:01:46] possible because it is and we'll show it
[1:01:48] by the scriptures amen as we go through
[1:01:50] the next few service but what I am
[1:01:52] saying is that adoption always involves
[1:01:54] and the prophet would make this clear a
[1:01:56] process of training and testing and time
[1:02:01] always no exceptions you have to be
[1:02:04] proven amen if you've never been trained
[1:02:07] or tested you can't be adopted it's that
[1:02:09] simple the scriptures are very clear
[1:02:11] amen why because you haven't been proven
[1:02:13] yet now listen to what he says he says
[1:02:15] notice he's speaking when he come and
[1:02:17] the father was pleased with his son when
[1:02:20] that when that son became a certain age
[1:02:21] he took him out into a place in the
[1:02:23] street and there he adopted that same
[1:02:24] son that was born in to the family he
[1:02:27] set him up on a pinnacle a high place he
[1:02:29] had a ceremony he placed a certain fying
[1:02:31] robe upon the son and had a ceremony and
[1:02:33] adopted him into their family or
[1:02:35] otherwise he placed him in the family
[1:02:37] positionally what he was he says because
[1:02:41] he had been time tested okay it's
[1:02:44] inescapable adoption requires a timed
[1:02:48] process he says oh I wish I had the
[1:02:50] ability to grind that in the people's
[1:02:52] hearts in other words listen up God is
[1:02:55] looking for time tested Christians
[1:02:58] because every son that cometh to God
[1:03:00] must be Tri tried child trained and
[1:03:05] tested now he says this is the opposite
[1:03:07] of it and you who jump from Pillar To
[1:03:09] Post and this to that and in and out how
[1:03:12] can God ever adopt you into his family
[1:03:14] or positionally place you you if you
[1:03:17] haven't been proven to be able to even
[1:03:18] stand still how is God going to be able
[1:03:20] to use you he says he says now think of
[1:03:24] that for a moment how can you be possed
[1:03:25] ially placed when you will not stand
[1:03:28] still long enough for God to do it and
[1:03:31] me you've got to be able to sit there
[1:03:32] under the tutorage tutelage of the Holy
[1:03:35] Spirit to sit there and learn and
[1:03:37] surrender and humble yourself and when
[1:03:39] you can do that then God knows that you
[1:03:41] can be trusted and he can place you in a
[1:03:43] position of authority amen amen so God
[1:03:46] gives you the Holy Ghost with the
[1:03:48] intention of giving you at a place in
[1:03:50] adoption that is the purpose is to bring
[1:03:52] you into adoption but you have to
[1:03:54] surrender and if you don't fully
[1:03:56] surrender then God can't do anything
[1:03:58] with you you're you're sealed to the day
[1:04:00] of your Redemption you're going to
[1:04:02] heaven you're going in a Rapture but God
[1:04:04] can't do anything with you until you
[1:04:06] fully surrender those things amen now
[1:04:08] brother braham's quite clear he makes
[1:04:10] the distinction between the infilling of
[1:04:12] the Holy Spirit and the adoption of a
[1:04:14] child of God he doesn't say they can't
[1:04:16] happen at the same time but he says they
[1:04:18] are not the same thing that's a
[1:04:21] distinction that many miss it can happen
[1:04:24] at the same time but it doesn't mean
[1:04:26] they're the same thing listen to this he
[1:04:28] says now to place he says how are you he
[1:04:31] says you are first born into the kingdom
[1:04:33] by the Holy Ghost all right and he says
[1:04:35] and the next you are predestinated unto
[1:04:38] the what adoption what is that he says
[1:04:41] you are predestinated unto the placing
[1:04:44] he says now what is adoption he says the
[1:04:46] adoption is not your
[1:04:50] birth your adoption is your
[1:04:54] placing he says when you are born again
[1:04:56] John 1:17 I believe he says when we are
[1:04:58] born of the spirit of God we are sons of
[1:05:00] God but we are predestinated now here's
[1:05:02] what I'm trying to get you to for the
[1:05:05] sons of the last day this is ours this
[1:05:07] is our message church he says we were
[1:05:09] predestinated to unto adoption he says
[1:05:13] now this is what hurts Pentecostals a
[1:05:14] little they say I got born again praise
[1:05:17] the Lord I got the Holy Ghost he says
[1:05:19] fine you're a child of God that's right
[1:05:22] but yet that ain't what I'm talking
[1:05:24] about see you are predestinated unto
[1:05:27] adoption he says adoption it's placing a
[1:05:30] son to clench it out of the mouth of two
[1:05:33] or three Witnesses he says now when you
[1:05:34] receive the Holy Ghost that's one thing
[1:05:36] you're born he says but now for the
[1:05:38] ceremony of adoption two separate things
[1:05:43] amen the Holy Ghost is given to us what
[1:05:46] as a response to our faith in the word
[1:05:48] of God Amen where we obey the word we
[1:05:51] repent and be baptized what's our
[1:05:53] commandment very quickly acts 23 8 they
[1:05:56] said what do we do about this Peter he
[1:05:58] says repent and be baptized every one of
[1:06:02] you in the name of Jesus
[1:06:05] Christ well Jesus said in Matthew 28:19
[1:06:09] to baptize in the name of the father Son
[1:06:10] and Holy
[1:06:12] Ghost what does Peter do Peter has the
[1:06:15] keys to the kingdom Peter gives us the
[1:06:18] revelation of what Jesus
[1:06:20] meant Jesus said the name what is the
[1:06:24] name of the father what is is the name
[1:06:26] of the son well we know the name of the
[1:06:28] son is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:30] the pillar of fire which knocked Paul
[1:06:32] off of his horse amen and what did he
[1:06:35] say to Paul Paul said who are you he
[1:06:37] says I am Jesus so there's two are named
[1:06:39] Jesus so that means the third one must
[1:06:41] be Nam Jesus amen we baptize in the name
[1:06:45] of Jesus Christ and outside of that it
[1:06:47] is a false
[1:06:49] baptism because you're baptized into a
[1:06:51] denomination you're not baptized into
[1:06:53] the word you've got to obey the word
[1:06:55] otherwise you can't remember what
[1:06:57] happened is that those those ones that
[1:06:58] got baptized under John's Revelation
[1:07:00] under John's Ministry they were baptized
[1:07:02] for the remission of sins and they were
[1:07:04] good Christians they were good Believers
[1:07:06] and and and the apostles come up and
[1:07:08] they say have you received the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost they say we don't even know about
[1:07:11] the Holy Ghost we don't even know if
[1:07:12] there is such a thing they and the first
[1:07:14] thing they asked how are you
[1:07:17] baptized if you're lacking what's the
[1:07:20] problem because the promise is if you
[1:07:22] repent and be baptized you'll get the
[1:07:23] Holy Ghost so the the first thing they
[1:07:26] said how are you baptized they said we
[1:07:27] are baptized in John under John they
[1:07:29] said no no no no no you got to be
[1:07:31] baptized in jesus' name and as soon as
[1:07:34] they were baptized the right way the
[1:07:36] Holy Ghost fell upon them all they
[1:07:38] needed was to hear the word and respond
[1:07:40] to it amen we look so often at
[1:07:43] repentance as a mouth thing amen but
[1:07:45] repentance means to turn around it means
[1:07:47] to live a different life my sister
[1:07:48] shared something this morning and it was
[1:07:51] a minister from way back when but he
[1:07:52] said if your life hasn't changed since
[1:07:54] you gave your life to Christ since
[1:07:56] you've been saved then you have not been
[1:07:58] saved amen repentance is a confession of
[1:08:02] our life not just our mouth because
[1:08:05] remember what scripture says this people
[1:08:07] draw nigh to me with their mouth but
[1:08:08] their heart is far from me amen a heart
[1:08:11] Chang is what's needed amen and then we
[1:08:14] are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:15] for the remission of sins in proper
[1:08:17] baptism and then what God responds to
[1:08:20] our faith and gives us the Holy Ghost
[1:08:23] amen that's the way it works but that
[1:08:24] baptism is gift and its power and it's
[1:08:26] meant to bring us into the full
[1:08:28] subjection of the spirit of God why so
[1:08:31] we can manifest him amen and that means
[1:08:34] we've got to get everything emptied out
[1:08:35] that's why we don't throw away a message
[1:08:37] of justification you got to have that
[1:08:39] that's what repentance does he paid the
[1:08:41] price I stand Here redeemed blameless
[1:08:43] but then there's a sanctification to
[1:08:45] empty me out because what has to happen
[1:08:47] is I've got to be filled and I've got to
[1:08:48] be filled with the right thing otherwise
[1:08:50] what comes out won't be him so there's
[1:08:52] got to be that emptying out there's got
[1:08:54] to be that cleaning out of our desire
[1:08:55] desires and our our focus and the the
[1:08:57] things that matter in our lives amen
[1:09:00] because the first thing the Holy Ghost
[1:09:01] produces is a Godly life I'm going to
[1:09:04] say it again the first thing the Holy
[1:09:05] Ghost produces is a Godly life we don't
[1:09:08] run around seeking gifts we don't run
[1:09:10] around seeking positions and Authority
[1:09:11] but rather we seek him to have what full
[1:09:15] Authority in my life amen full Authority
[1:09:18] in my life amen we sit still and we let
[1:09:20] God do a thorough work and take that
[1:09:21] empty vessel and turn it into a vessel
[1:09:23] of Honor by putting him self in it
[1:09:26] that's what makes us a vessel of honor
[1:09:27] to him where we're filled with his
[1:09:29] goodness with his will with his desires
[1:09:31] and these things amen so the Holy Ghost
[1:09:33] doesn't just have an effect it's a life
[1:09:35] effect it's a lifechanging effect and
[1:09:37] it's a change and we've covered this
[1:09:39] before so I'm not going to belabor it
[1:09:41] but I want to read just a few quotes
[1:09:42] here he says but as many as received him
[1:09:45] gave he the power to become The
[1:09:46] Offspring of God he said I give unto
[1:09:48] them eternal life that eternal life
[1:09:50] comes from the Greek word of Zoey Zoey
[1:09:53] is that life and Zoey is the life of God
[1:09:55] and if the life of God living in you he
[1:09:58] says it produces a Godly life just as
[1:10:00] certain as I'm standing in this platform
[1:10:03] and a man that's got it can no more
[1:10:05] perish than God can perish because what
[1:10:07] God is in the
[1:10:09] man that's where we're standing this
[1:10:12] afternoon church he says when a man is
[1:10:14] Anointed with the Holy Ghost here's the
[1:10:17] purpose to be adopted into the family of
[1:10:20] God to be positionally placed by the
[1:10:22] father and set into a service out here
[1:10:25] in into his purpose of life or what God
[1:10:27] called him for his walk should be no
[1:10:32] must be cuz remember we are Kings and
[1:10:35] Priests he says his W his walk must be
[1:10:38] holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy
[1:10:43] holy what it has to produce a Godly life
[1:10:46] before he can ever take you out and use
[1:10:48] you he says and this word is God and
[1:10:51] that word lives and produces itself just
[1:10:55] exactly what God has ordained for this
[1:10:58] age you have it Church you have it he's
[1:11:01] given it to you by the power of the holy
[1:11:03] spirit inside of you to produce the word
[1:11:05] for this age he says you have it amen
[1:11:07] the Holy Ghost the holy spirit being
[1:11:11] displayed it's meant to be on display
[1:11:13] it's supposed to be that City on a Hill
[1:11:15] a candle a light that can't be hidden
[1:11:17] amen he says yes sir what is it it's the
[1:11:20] Holy Spirit the word has been quickened
[1:11:22] to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate
[1:11:24] this age that you have passed from Death
[1:11:28] unto life he says and now you are his
[1:11:32] what the holy spirit is vindicating your
[1:11:34] position it vindicates who your father
[1:11:36] is it in it vindicates your origin amen
[1:11:39] it's a confirmation that you are a child
[1:11:42] of God and when you get it inside of you
[1:11:44] you will act like a son and daughter of
[1:11:46] God why you will come subject to the
[1:11:50] word of God
[1:11:53] Amen if you haven't experienced with the
[1:11:55] Holy Ghost in church it'll go away cuz
[1:11:58] you'll leave the church you'll go out
[1:12:01] remember I remember when brother Michael
[1:12:02] from Toronto was
[1:12:04] here and I was talking about a church
[1:12:06] experience and the problem with a church
[1:12:08] experience is on a good day we'll take
[1:12:10] two steps up at church we've got an
[1:12:12] atmosphere we've got lots of people here
[1:12:14] the spirit of God is moving the word is
[1:12:15] being preached you know we've got a
[1:12:17] captive audience God can really do
[1:12:19] something but you go up two steps and
[1:12:20] then you go home you do nothing you're
[1:12:22] down one step then you go home and
[1:12:23] you're down another step and then you
[1:12:25] come in on a Wednesday well Wednesdays
[1:12:26] you only get one step not two cuz
[1:12:28] there's less people here kidding but
[1:12:31] then you go home and you don't do
[1:12:32] anything and you drop down again
[1:12:33] Thursday Friday Saturday then you come
[1:12:35] to Sunday and you finish your week and
[1:12:37] you're down one or two steps from where
[1:12:38] you started the week before based on a
[1:12:39] church experience it doesn't mean God's
[1:12:41] not doing something with you but you got
[1:12:43] to keep pressing the battle amen this
[1:12:45] isn't a church experience church is part
[1:12:47] of it amen we're supposed to not forsake
[1:12:49] the assembling of ourselves together in
[1:12:51] these different things but the infilling
[1:12:53] of the holy spirit is what we're looking
[1:12:54] for not just a church experience amen
[1:12:58] you get the Holy Ghost you never stop
[1:12:59] growing you never stop maturing and you
[1:13:02] never stop producing the word amen it
[1:13:05] has to come outside of you he says oh
[1:13:08] because he is we have the right to all
[1:13:10] that he has purchased for us every
[1:13:12] promise in the Bible is yours it belongs
[1:13:14] to you when this token is upon you and
[1:13:18] God has sealed you he says now we want
[1:13:20] to check ourselves for a moment let's
[1:13:22] check ourselves he says when God has
[1:13:24] given you the true baptism of the Holy
[1:13:26] Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is
[1:13:29] within you he says it's a new birth you
[1:13:31] are born a new of the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:33] because God has do that did this now
[1:13:36] catch this he says and you know you're
[1:13:38] no good in
[1:13:39] yourself that's the other thing the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost will do is it'll show you there's
[1:13:43] no good thing in this flesh amen he says
[1:13:45] and you accept what God has did then he
[1:13:48] seals you into his kingdom by the Holy
[1:13:50] Spirit now listen to this he says and
[1:13:52] everything that Jesus purchased and
[1:13:55] promised you in the Bible is yours he
[1:13:58] says it's your property
[1:14:00] why because it's paid
[1:14:03] for amen he says life is mine why he
[1:14:06] paid for it life is yours he paid for it
[1:14:08] healing is mine he paid for it healing
[1:14:10] is yours he paid for it Freedom's mine
[1:14:12] he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid
[1:14:14] for it he has paid the price everything
[1:14:17] he purchased belongs to the man that
[1:14:19] holds the token amen holding it in
[1:14:22] holding your confession in the word of
[1:14:24] God that Jesus Christ has died for you
[1:14:27] and when he does it he displays himself
[1:14:30] through you catch that see it's not all
[1:14:33] of this this idea of us going out and
[1:14:35] doing something but the first expression
[1:14:37] is in us and through us and he says it's
[1:14:39] healing that's Christ expressing that's
[1:14:41] God expressing himself in you it's
[1:14:43] Freedom it's liberty it's Deliverance
[1:14:45] it's provision all these things is God
[1:14:47] expressing himself through you and your
[1:14:49] life first and foremost amen whatever he
[1:14:52] does it's him showing himself through
[1:14:53] you he says amen yes when you recognize
[1:14:56] the token the life that it took for the
[1:14:58] blood to
[1:15:00] speak amen I had a friend of mine call
[1:15:03] me up on on Friday night and I was just
[1:15:05] sitting down to study and and he called
[1:15:08] me up and he says I'm at the airport
[1:15:11] flying home he works up in
[1:15:14] Labrador he says my flight is canceled
[1:15:16] do you want to meet up for some
[1:15:17] fellowship so I made my second and third
[1:15:19] trips back and forth to the airport that
[1:15:21] night and we brought him home with us
[1:15:22] and we we had some fellowship for 4
[1:15:24] hours but he told me something on the
[1:15:26] way back to the airport that that
[1:15:27] evening and he said this he says when I
[1:15:30] was a boy my mama would make cookies for
[1:15:32] me for us he's got siblings he says and
[1:15:37] she would take those cookies and she
[1:15:39] would place them on the counter in a jar
[1:15:45] within our
[1:15:47] reach he said and mama told us if you're
[1:15:50] hungry you can have a cookie you don't
[1:15:53] have to ask me you don't have to ask
[1:15:55] anyone they're my homemade cookies I've
[1:15:58] put them there I've made them for you
[1:16:01] you can have a cookie anytime you're
[1:16:04] hungry and you know what he said he said
[1:16:07] I never had to worry was I allowed a
[1:16:10] cookie why mama had told me the cookies
[1:16:13] belong to you you can have them no doubt
[1:16:16] they were sister moren's healthy
[1:16:19] recipe
[1:16:21] amen but he says we end have to ask if
[1:16:24] they were for us if they were being
[1:16:27] saved for somebody else we got company
[1:16:29] coming you can't eat those cookies he
[1:16:31] said if they were in that jar within our
[1:16:34] reach she put them there for us to eat
[1:16:36] Church what are we saying there's
[1:16:38] cookies in the jar today amen and what
[1:16:41] happens is before the foundation of the
[1:16:43] world he wrote your name on that cookie
[1:16:45] jar and you know what you have to watch
[1:16:48] out for that man that woman that satanic
[1:16:51] influence that says those cookies ain't
[1:16:53] for you
[1:16:56] you have to be able to point them and
[1:16:58] what do you do you hold that token
[1:16:59] before you and you say he gave me the
[1:17:01] Holy Ghost I'm his son I'm his daughter
[1:17:05] and he purchased for me
[1:17:08] personally every cookie in that cookie
[1:17:11] jar so I'm going to take the one that
[1:17:13] says healing and I'm going to eat it and
[1:17:16] you can't stop me and if they try and
[1:17:19] slap your hand down you slap their hand
[1:17:20] down if you need Deliverance you take
[1:17:23] the cookie that says Deliverance if you
[1:17:25] need wisdom take the cookie that says
[1:17:26] wisdom and you say he wrote it in his
[1:17:28] own blood on the side of the cookie jar
[1:17:30] that I could go free that I could be
[1:17:32] healed that I could be delivered that I
[1:17:34] could be provided for that I could
[1:17:36] believe and expect to receive the cookie
[1:17:38] that I'm wanting this morning
[1:17:41] amen oh what's the question we've got to
[1:17:44] settle
[1:17:45] Church the question we've got to settle
[1:17:47] is is my name on the cookie jar the
[1:17:50] cookies are there the tables are full of
[1:17:53] the promises of God
[1:17:55] the only thing you got to satisfy is do
[1:17:57] they belong to me and when you get the
[1:18:00] Holy Ghost it's supposed to settle that
[1:18:02] question it's supposed to settle the
[1:18:04] question is is this for me
[1:18:06] amen what is it you say I've got the
[1:18:09] Holy Ghost this whole body is meant to
[1:18:12] be in subjection to the Holy Ghost
[1:18:15] because remember what God is God is life
[1:18:18] God is Liberty God is wisdom God is
[1:18:21] peace Joy love and it is meant for this
[1:18:24] entire body to be brought in subjection
[1:18:26] to the holy spirit that he placed inside
[1:18:29] each and every one of us amen that's
[1:18:31] what the holy spirit is supposed to do
[1:18:32] satisfy us that our name is written into
[1:18:35] those promises in the book but watch the
[1:18:38] antidote now to this Holy Spirit watch
[1:18:40] the antidote because we see this in the
[1:18:41] in the Ephesian Church Age and what they
[1:18:44] did in the Ephesian Church age was they
[1:18:45] were so worried about protecting the
[1:18:47] gospel that they formalized
[1:18:50] it you'll see it today people are so
[1:18:54] worried that their church is going to
[1:18:56] get influenced by somebody else that
[1:18:58] they just block everybody out no no no
[1:19:01] the Holy Ghost can protect the church
[1:19:03] amen as Shepherds we've certainly got to
[1:19:05] be careful but we can't put up a fence
[1:19:08] because what happens when we put up a
[1:19:10] fence is it keeps the Holy Ghost Out
[1:19:12] amen what happened to the Ephesian
[1:19:14] Church age was they put the Holy Ghost
[1:19:15] out and Men took over and God had to
[1:19:18] leave cuz God can't work when men want
[1:19:21] to have
[1:19:22] control listen to this he says the Holy
[1:19:25] Spirit comes today in like manner to
[1:19:26] present God to
[1:19:28] man he says but man wants to go to
[1:19:32] church go to a church go sit under a
[1:19:36] Ministry go get their satisfying Portion
[1:19:39] by saying I went to church today I went
[1:19:41] to church this week I went to church
[1:19:42] twice this week maybe three times this
[1:19:44] week he says that's what man wants to do
[1:19:47] amen and the only thing satisfied with
[1:19:49] the church experience is what a
[1:19:51] religious spirit 100% And that's what
[1:19:54] leoda is full of and the only cure is
[1:19:58] repentance to recognize that my
[1:20:00] satisfaction is in going to church it's
[1:20:02] not in
[1:20:05] Christ he says it drowns his thinking he
[1:20:09] cannot fa fathom it and we must learn
[1:20:11] that God is not known by intellectual
[1:20:13] conception God is known by the New Birth
[1:20:15] by the Holy Ghost not by any other way
[1:20:18] Jesus the Bible is plainly quoted to us
[1:20:20] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:20:22] only by the Holy Ghost why because
[1:20:24] you're anointed with the same thing he
[1:20:26] had Christ means anointed how can you
[1:20:29] call him the anointed if you don't have
[1:20:31] the experience of being anointed
[1:20:32] yourself that's the proving of his
[1:20:34] anointing is your anointing because the
[1:20:36] same thing that's on him comes on you
[1:20:37] just in a lesser in a lesser amount he
[1:20:40] says but if you've never received the
[1:20:42] Holy Ghost you don't know that he is the
[1:20:43] Christ for that's the only way he
[1:20:45] reveals himself he says you're not
[1:20:48] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:20:49] Ghost the Bible said so and after Peter
[1:20:52] had been both saved been both sa both
[1:20:54] both been saved and Sanctified given
[1:20:56] power to cast out unclean spirits to
[1:20:57] preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him
[1:21:00] he was not converted until he received
[1:21:02] the Holy Ghost and then he said after
[1:21:04] you're converted then strengthen your
[1:21:06] brethren that was on the night of the
[1:21:08] Betrayal that he was not yet converted
[1:21:11] he says and no man is truly converted
[1:21:13] until he has been
[1:21:14] changed and died to
[1:21:18] himself some get changed but changed for
[1:21:21] the
[1:21:22] worse cuz what it does is they get a
[1:21:24] religious spirit rather than the Holy
[1:21:26] Spirit and they're what twofold more a
[1:21:29] child of Hell the scripture
[1:21:31] says he says and the H one you got to
[1:21:34] change you got to change the right way
[1:21:35] two die to himself and then three the
[1:21:37] Holy Spirit has control of that Spirit
[1:21:39] of that person rather they don't want to
[1:21:41] do it now listen to this he says now the
[1:21:44] holy spirit will not misbehave itself in
[1:21:45] one person and behave itself in another
[1:21:49] now we can take that and run and we go
[1:21:51] to
[1:21:52] standards and say well her skirt isn't
[1:21:55] as long as my skirt therefore she
[1:21:56] doesn't have the Holy Ghost and his
[1:21:58] music is not the same as my music
[1:21:59] therefore he doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:22:00] no no no we each have personal standards
[1:22:04] I preached it before and I'll preach it
[1:22:05] again sometimes what we call a holy
[1:22:07] ghost standard is just our personal
[1:22:10] preference sorry our standard is right
[1:22:14] here if you can point me to this if you
[1:22:17] want to argue with me if you want to say
[1:22:19] this is the best way to go the words I
[1:22:22] want to hear you say is it is written
[1:22:24] not I think it is written this is where
[1:22:27] we go to for our absolute in these
[1:22:28] things amen so the word is the standard
[1:22:31] and what he's saying here is the holy
[1:22:32] spirit will not bring one person subject
[1:22:34] to the word and one person
[1:22:36] not one person doesn't get to skate by
[1:22:38] and the other one does no we all act the
[1:22:41] same way when it comes to the word of
[1:22:43] God he says it'll make each person come
[1:22:46] into its character see because it's a
[1:22:48] spirit that leads you it brings and
[1:22:50] makes you subject to its nature you
[1:22:53] don't bring it subject to your nature it
[1:22:55] makes you subject to its nature now
[1:22:58] catch this he says and the Holy Spirit
[1:23:00] makes you live and love to do
[1:23:03] it praise the Lord even when you don't
[1:23:07] like it you love
[1:23:08] it you ever heard well actually I kind
[1:23:11] of think we do it the other way we say
[1:23:13] that we say man I love that person but I
[1:23:14] don't like him there are people that we
[1:23:17] don't get along with so great why
[1:23:20] personal preferences
[1:23:22] personalities approaches attit udes I
[1:23:26] remember there's there's a young man
[1:23:27] he's he's not so young he's my age now
[1:23:30] he's a preacher now he's a great
[1:23:31] preacher When We Were Young I could not
[1:23:33] get along with him not in this church
[1:23:35] he's someplace
[1:23:36] else I couldn't get along with him he
[1:23:39] just rubbed me the wrong way I never
[1:23:40] doubted for an exper for a second that
[1:23:42] he had the holy ghost that he had had a
[1:23:44] life-changing experience he had had a
[1:23:45] dramatic life-changing experience and
[1:23:47] God has called him to be a preacher and
[1:23:49] he's a phenomenal preacher but I don't
[1:23:51] get along with him very well but I can
[1:23:53] get along with him in the in the idea
[1:23:55] that he is a preacher that he's got a
[1:23:57] call that he's got a purpose and I'm not
[1:23:59] called to sit under his ministry and
[1:24:01] maybe I'm not called to walk alongside
[1:24:03] him and preach with him but I believe
[1:24:05] God's with the man and that God's in the
[1:24:06] manen let's not let our personal
[1:24:09] preferences of the way things go or the
[1:24:12] way things should be hold us back and
[1:24:13] say well they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:15] no no no that's not what we're talking
[1:24:17] about amen he says it makes you live and
[1:24:20] love to do it even in the hard times
[1:24:23] there's something about knowing when
[1:24:24] you're a child of God that he's leading
[1:24:26] you and he's guiding you and when you're
[1:24:27] on the path that he's LED you on you're
[1:24:29] okay with it he says oh how you love to
[1:24:31] give up the things of the world when the
[1:24:33] Holy Ghost comes in can we say amen he
[1:24:36] says how it cleanses you and washes you
[1:24:38] and puts a desire in you to follow him
[1:24:41] and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it
[1:24:44] amen he says just bathing
[1:24:48] yourself what is it's the washing of the
[1:24:51] water of the word it says he brings
[1:24:55] realities amen that's the kind of God I
[1:24:57] serve that's the kind of God I've seen
[1:24:59] in my life that's the god I want more of
[1:25:01] in my life is a god of realities amen he
[1:25:03] says now when God placed man here and in
[1:25:06] the days of the Lord Jesus he gave man a
[1:25:08] true road map to his power now I want to
[1:25:13] take us back to our first scripture as
[1:25:15] we start to close this morning and this
[1:25:17] may seem a bit of a mishmash this
[1:25:19] morning but I just felt to kind of cover
[1:25:21] this this way to kind of lift our eyes
[1:25:23] up a little bit this morning
[1:25:25] so we go to Psalm 1 it says blessed is
[1:25:26] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:25:29] of the ungodly nor standeth in the seat
[1:25:31] of the in the way of the Sinners nor
[1:25:32] walketh in the seat of the scornful if
[1:25:34] your life matches up with the way the
[1:25:36] world lives their life something's
[1:25:38] wrong because theirs is the way of
[1:25:39] Sinners amen we're a holy people we're a
[1:25:42] consecrated people we're a sanctified
[1:25:44] people if we can look and see them doing
[1:25:46] things we're doing we're
[1:25:48] wrong it's that simple cuz the word
[1:25:50] calls us out the word is separating but
[1:25:52] it says there that sth in the seat of
[1:25:54] the scornful that word scornful means
[1:25:56] boastful arrogant
[1:25:58] mocking in other words he says if you're
[1:26:00] a man that's a child of God you've come
[1:26:02] out from this you used to have a
[1:26:05] different attitude you used to have a
[1:26:07] different voice you used to have a
[1:26:08] different influence but you've come out
[1:26:10] of that and we come into what we've got
[1:26:13] a new attitude we've got a new Love and
[1:26:15] it says but his Delight is in the law of
[1:26:17] the Lord and in his law do he meditate
[1:26:21] day and night in other words he doesn't
[1:26:23] consider anything else
[1:26:25] his
[1:26:26] reference his guideline is purely by the
[1:26:29] word of
[1:26:31] God it's not 12 steps to become a child
[1:26:34] of God you know or how to influence
[1:26:37] people and make friends in these
[1:26:38] different things no it is the word of
[1:26:41] God that is our place of meditation and
[1:26:43] our Delight it says is there amen our
[1:26:45] filter our mindset our inspiration
[1:26:47] everything is being brought through the
[1:26:49] word of God and if you do that what's
[1:26:51] the effect it's verse three it says and
[1:26:53] he shall shall be like a tree planted
[1:26:57] placed positionally placed with
[1:27:00] intention and with intelligence with
[1:27:03] purpose by the rivers of water that
[1:27:06] bringeth forth fruit his fruit in his
[1:27:09] season his fruit you've got a fruit to
[1:27:12] produce I've got a fruit to produce
[1:27:13] you've got a season I've got a
[1:27:16] season but we've always got the water
[1:27:19] and it's always there and so that means
[1:27:21] if the heat comes we still produce fruit
[1:27:24] the cold comes we still produce fruit
[1:27:26] because this is flowing water this isn't
[1:27:28] standing water that would freeze this is
[1:27:30] flowing water it's always available to
[1:27:32] us
[1:27:33] amen it says and his Leaf also shall not
[1:27:36] wither but I love this last part it says
[1:27:38] whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:27:40] prosper We Don't Preach a Prosperity
[1:27:43] Gospel the way the world does what is
[1:27:45] the prosperity here what is the son
[1:27:48] doing what is the daughter doing what is
[1:27:49] the child of God doing that brings
[1:27:51] Prosperity meditating on his word and
[1:27:54] delighting in what they read day and
[1:27:57] night it is the only thing we take in
[1:27:59] amen what is prosperity then for us
[1:28:02] being planted by God it is being in the
[1:28:05] will of God that is our prosperity amen
[1:28:08] it's not physical it's not financial
[1:28:10] prosperity but rather it's the
[1:28:11] prosperity of knowing that he's with you
[1:28:13] all times my wife and I we were having a
[1:28:15] conversation with this brother that that
[1:28:17] we brought over on on Friday night and
[1:28:19] she was expressing you know we we came
[1:28:21] all the way over here to the east coast
[1:28:23] and we have no blood family here we have
[1:28:25] family here believe me we have family
[1:28:27] here but we don't have blood family my
[1:28:28] father's not here my mother's not here
[1:28:30] none of my siblings or or anything like
[1:28:32] that none of her family is here and
[1:28:33] we're further away than we've ever been
[1:28:37] and yet she was saying and yet we are So
[1:28:39] Satisfied here we are so content and
[1:28:43] things that even might bother other
[1:28:44] people here don't bother
[1:28:47] us whether it's the weather which is
[1:28:49] getting better and better due to climate
[1:28:52] change Bring It On
[1:28:54] warmer and
[1:28:56] warmer right things that would bother
[1:28:59] anybody else that didn't have a purpose
[1:29:02] in being here don't bother us why
[1:29:07] because we've been
[1:29:08] planted we've been placed and our rest
[1:29:12] is in his placing not in the situation
[1:29:16] not in the conditions our rest our
[1:29:18] satisfying portion is that he said
[1:29:21] go and that's it that is what the Son
[1:29:25] and Daughter of God can rest in is when
[1:29:27] he says I've put you here Church the
[1:29:29] situation is not our prison the prison
[1:29:33] is our attitude and mindset towards the
[1:29:36] situation that's what holds us back so
[1:29:38] often why our lack of Revelation that he
[1:29:41] has brought me here he has placed me
[1:29:43] here I'm walking with him if you are
[1:29:45] satisfied that you are walking with God
[1:29:47] today then whatever you're going through
[1:29:50] you ought to be able to say praise the
[1:29:51] Lord why because he works all things for
[1:29:54] my good I'm letting him lead I'm not
[1:29:57] bringing him subject to my will I'm
[1:29:59] following his will and therefore
[1:30:01] whatever is going on is bringing the
[1:30:03] vision to pass that he spoke about me
[1:30:05] before the foundation of the world began
[1:30:07] amen listen to this he
[1:30:12] says there we go Joseph saw his life as
[1:30:16] it begin to move he says the next thing
[1:30:18] you know they found he was thrown into a
[1:30:21] hole deceived by his brother supposing
[1:30:23] have been killed and thrown into a hole
[1:30:24] and was taken up again Joseph foresaw
[1:30:27] that he saw himself in the prison he saw
[1:30:29] himself in the dudgeon but catch this he
[1:30:32] saw God was with him whatever he did
[1:30:36] know he was a prince of
[1:30:40] prosperity the world prospered
[1:30:42] everywhere Joseph was there was
[1:30:44] prosperity for he was the prince of
[1:30:46] prosperity and him foreshadowing
[1:30:50] Christ we wouldn't look at Joseph's
[1:30:52] situation and say that's
[1:30:55] Prosperity but it was Prosperity because
[1:30:58] God was in it God was moving God had
[1:31:00] ordained Joseph's footsteps and Joseph
[1:31:03] completely out of control of his life is
[1:31:06] thrown into a well then taken up sold
[1:31:08] into slavery goes into Piper's house
[1:31:11] becomes his
[1:31:12] Steward increases Piper's wealth
[1:31:15] tremendously but is still a slave but is
[1:31:19] prospering in it he knows how to make
[1:31:21] things work God's training him then is
[1:31:24] falsely Accu Accused by a a lustful
[1:31:27] woman and now is completely demoted into
[1:31:31] prison he's going lower and lower and
[1:31:34] lower and he's the prince of prosperity
[1:31:38] why because God is in it and he goes
[1:31:40] into prison and pretty soon he has the
[1:31:42] full run of the prison and the prison
[1:31:44] system is running better than
[1:31:46] ever and what is it Prosperity follows
[1:31:49] behind him in whatever place he found
[1:31:51] himself Joseph prospered
[1:31:54] seems like he he he makes friends with
[1:31:56] the Butler and the baker he says when
[1:31:57] you go before Pharaoh remember me and
[1:32:00] they forget and he's forgotten and he's
[1:32:01] just laying in the dungeon laying in the
[1:32:04] prison but what's he doing whatsoever
[1:32:06] the hand fth to do do it with all your
[1:32:08] might do it as unto God and he did it as
[1:32:11] unto God and God blessed him and then
[1:32:14] what happened is a need
[1:32:16] arises and and that man remembers and he
[1:32:18] tells Pharaoh I know a man that can
[1:32:20] interpret your dream and in one instant
[1:32:23] Joseph goes from being a prisoner to
[1:32:26] second in command and holding the
[1:32:28] authority of the kingdom and none could
[1:32:31] go to Pharaoh except through
[1:32:34] him Prince of
[1:32:36] prosperity but we don't see it because
[1:32:38] we're looking at the situation rather
[1:32:40] than the god who's leading us through
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:42] situation he continues he says wherever
[1:32:45] Christ is there is
[1:32:47] prosperity not natural we're not talking
[1:32:50] natural we're talking prosperity in that
[1:32:52] what the word of God is coming to
[1:32:54] fulfillment in your life he says when
[1:32:55] Christ returns to the Earth all the
[1:32:57] curse of the earth will be taken away
[1:32:59] some of these days the old desert shall
[1:33:00] Blossom as a rose the rough places will
[1:33:02] be made smooth and shall be brought
[1:33:04] forth in the abundance for he is the
[1:33:07] prince of prosperity wherever he is he
[1:33:10] says hallelujah he's the prince of
[1:33:12] prosperity so our prosperity is found in
[1:33:15] what coming back to our position in
[1:33:16] Christ remember Redemption is is to
[1:33:19] bring back those that have lost their
[1:33:22] inheritance they squandered they got out
[1:33:24] of position they got out of place they
[1:33:26] they left their one true love and he
[1:33:27] redeems us back and our position in
[1:33:29] Christ is one of prosperity because
[1:33:32] scripture says he'll withhold no good
[1:33:33] thing from us no good thing no Godly
[1:33:36] thing no thing that comes from him amen
[1:33:39] so it's Redemption it's a restoration
[1:33:41] it's healing it's it's overcoming power
[1:33:43] it's all of these things but it's not a
[1:33:45] life without struggles Prosperity is not
[1:33:47] a life without struggles Prosperity is a
[1:33:49] life that you get the victory no matter
[1:33:50] what the struggle is amen that you can
[1:33:52] see the hand of God and all these things
[1:33:54] Prosperity is to know he's with
[1:33:56] me whether it's a cloudy day whether
[1:33:59] it's a rainy day whether it's a sunny
[1:34:00] day whether we're on the Mountaintop
[1:34:02] whether in the valley or whether we're
[1:34:03] just slugging it up the mountain side he
[1:34:05] is with me and that's all I need to know
[1:34:08] amen remember we read that quote where
[1:34:11] brother Brown said Joseph and David and
[1:34:12] those men didn't even know what they
[1:34:14] were doing that Christ was revealing
[1:34:17] himself through them I want to ask you
[1:34:18] this morning do you realize he's in you
[1:34:21] and he's revealing himself in your
[1:34:22] situations
[1:34:25] we ought to know we ought to be able to
[1:34:26] realize it because this is the time of
[1:34:28] understanding there's nothing held back
[1:34:29] from us the mystery is being revealed we
[1:34:32] ought to be able to say it's Christ in
[1:34:34] me being revealed in these life
[1:34:36] situations no matter how big it is no
[1:34:38] matter how bad it is amen are we blind
[1:34:41] to our portrayal of Christ or are we
[1:34:42] saying I see it I see it I didn't used
[1:34:45] to be able to do that but now I do it my
[1:34:47] old reaction was this but my new
[1:34:49] reaction was this praise God that I've
[1:34:51] got peace in the storm storm St haven't
[1:34:54] changed but the person in the storm has
[1:34:55] changed why because there's a man in the
[1:34:58] boat that can calm me even when the
[1:35:02] storm continues to
[1:35:04] rage first thing Jesus did was calm them
[1:35:06] and then he calmed the
[1:35:09] storm listen to this as we start to
[1:35:11] close Paul said let your conversation be
[1:35:15] without
[1:35:16] covetousness and be content with such
[1:35:18] things as you have for he ha said this
[1:35:24] is what we have church I will never

[1:35:36] health you got Health struggles he's
[1:35:38] with me no matter where you're at he
[1:35:41] says I will never leave you nor forsake

[1:35:47] helper not your helper my helper
[1:35:51] personal you got to put your name there
[1:35:53] he said says and I will not fear what
[1:35:55] man shall do unto

[1:36:02] meeting and to stay there until God
[1:36:05] sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:07] and brings the Holy Ghost down and
[1:36:09] places in the church Apostles prophets

[1:36:17] needs he says it won't compromise it'll
[1:36:22] stay with the word

[1:36:28] world yeah but are you flirting with the
[1:36:30] world Amen Satan likes to flirt that's
[1:36:34] how he got

[1:36:39] nothing to do with sin he says that'll
[1:36:41] turn its back on sin you know what that
[1:36:43] is church that's repentance to turn your
[1:36:46] back on sin is repentance he says that
[1:36:48] I'll walk in the Holiness and beauty of
[1:36:50] God living for God and then he says live
[1:36:52] or die what difference does it make as
[1:36:54] long as I'm for God what difference does
[1:36:57] it
[1:36:58] make he says you know when you get the

[1:37:39] proving he's a provider you know little
[1:37:41] testimony this morning Jonathan had been
[1:37:44] really struggling with his
[1:37:45] throat and it closed till almost it was
[1:37:48] like the size of a peanut his throat
[1:37:50] could barely drink or swallow or
[1:37:51] anything like that and so we tried to
[1:37:54] get into a doctor of course we don't
[1:37:55] have a family
[1:37:57] doctor I'm telling talking about
[1:37:59] knocking down obstacles okay we don't
[1:38:00] have a family
[1:38:02] doctor and we went in to the walk-in
[1:38:05] clinic on Mundy pond at like 10:45 in
[1:38:08] the morning okay you go into money Pond
[1:38:10] late it's full they've already booked

[1:38:17] about his throat she said we just had a
[1:38:20] cancellation I'll put you in

[1:38:36] needed to see a doctor we were in and
[1:38:38] out in less than 20
[1:38:41] minutes sometimes God heals and
[1:38:44] sometimes God says listen I can open any
[1:38:46] door see so often we want the
[1:38:49] supernatural God but God says I open all
[1:38:52] doors it all belongs to
[1:38:55] me who is greater than our God and
[1:38:58] something is simple and I told Jonathan
[1:39:00] I said that's the God we serve he can
[1:39:04] heal his throat like this or he can get
[1:39:06] us into a doctor to give him medication
[1:39:08] to heal it it's the same God he cares
[1:39:11] about the little things he cares about
[1:39:14] the path he cares about the purpose
[1:39:17] every single bit of it it's the hand of
[1:39:19] God moving in the Sons and Daughters of
[1:39:22] God his fing is in our lives

[1:39:27] recognize that as much as the hand of
[1:39:30] God as the great big things that we see
[1:39:32] in our life it would encourage us on our
[1:39:36] day-to-day walk that we can literally as
[1:39:39] children of God walk through and we see
