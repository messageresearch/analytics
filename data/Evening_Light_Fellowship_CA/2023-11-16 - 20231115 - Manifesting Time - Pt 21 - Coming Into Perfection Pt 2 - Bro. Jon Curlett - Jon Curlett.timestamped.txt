[32:46] pray Lord grant us a touch this evening
[32:48] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[32:52] amen God bless you let's turn if we
[32:54] would to 1 Corinthians 13 again 1
[32:57] Corinthians 13 amen welcome brother Matt
[33:01] up to the front seats here amen it's
[33:05] good to take a break and appreciate the
[33:08] hard work that he puts in as a deacon
[33:09] and soundboard and video system and all
[33:12] those things but it's good to see him
[33:13] take a break as well I've served many
[33:16] years 10 12 years as a deacon and doing
[33:18] all those things actually all the things
[33:20] that he's been doing and is done and and
[33:22] let me tell you you give up something to
[33:24] do that you lose part of the service
[33:26] because you're being careful and you're
[33:27] watchful for other things not related to
[33:30] the preaching and whatnot and you pay a
[33:31] price for that but I believe God has no
[33:33] unpaid debts amen and that he's met the
[33:36] need as well but we're thankful for what
[33:38] brother Matt's done but we do welcome
[33:39] his opportunity to sit in the service
[33:41] and not have to look around and watch
[33:43] around the same way he does when he's at
[33:44] the back there amen certainly appreciate
[33:47] the prayers for Blanca and the boys as
[33:49] they head to California for three weeks
[33:50] on Saturday and just praying God's
[33:52] traveling mercies to them and his
[33:54] keeping Grace to me uh Lord willing I'll
[33:56] head head out to to go moose hunting uh
[33:59] after service on Sunday the 26th or the
[34:01] 27th whichever one that is so I'll be
[34:03] gone for a week Lord willing but I'll be
[34:05] back the following Sunday and brother
[34:08] Paul will take the Wednesday Service as
[34:09] he usually does Amen so keep him in
[34:11] prayer as well amen we're going to
[34:14] continue in what we started last service
[34:16] in 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul says though
[34:18] I speak with the tongues of men and
[34:20] angels and have not charity I am become
[34:23] as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[34:25] you know he says I become
[34:28] he says something
[34:29] changed something made me like that he
[34:33] said I become like a noisy gong I wasn't
[34:35] always a noisy gong but something
[34:36] happened he says and it can't be charity
[34:38] that does those things though I have the
[34:40] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[34:42] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[34:44] have all Faith so that I could remove
[34:46] mountains and have not charity I am
[34:48] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[34:50] to feed the poor and though I give my
[34:52] body to be burned and have not charity
[34:55] it profiteth me nothing verse 8 says
[34:57] this charity never faileth but whether
[35:00] there be prophecies they shall fail
[35:02] whether there be tongues they shall
[35:04] cease whether there be knowledge it
[35:05] shall vanish away for we know in part
[35:08] and we prophesy in part but when that
[35:11] which is perfect is come then that which
[35:13] is in part shall be done away when I was
[35:16] a child I spake as a child I understood
[35:18] as a child I thought as a child but when
[35:21] I became a man I put away childish
[35:24] things amen God bless the reading of his
[35:26] word you can have your seats this
[35:27] evening and we're continuing on this
[35:29] thought of manifesting time and I'm
[35:30] taking a second service on this thought
[35:32] of coming into Perfection and we know
[35:35] that this idea of coming to per
[35:36] Perfection Paul says this is what
[35:38] happens after you've done through the
[35:40] doctrines and after you've done the
[35:42] first works and after your faith in in
[35:44] the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ and you
[35:46] know it's amazing that the focus we have
[35:48] on Doctrine in the message because
[35:51] really that's foundational and Paul's
[35:53] saying you got to get the foundation
[35:54] right and youve got to build a certain
[35:55] way but you can't stay just on that
[35:58] Foundation you can't just rest on the
[35:59] fact that you have a foundation but a
[36:01] foundation is meant for something to be
[36:03] built on and in the message we have the
[36:05] doctrine and we we've got to have the
[36:06] right Doctrine if you get the doctrine
[36:08] wrong then everything else is going to
[36:09] be wrong that's the structure it's the
[36:11] backbone it's the skeleton of the
[36:12] Christian walk and but the the simple
[36:14] fact is is that Doctrine is the most
[36:16] comfortable place to stay as a Christian
[36:19] right you can just say well this is what
[36:20] I believe and this is what it says and
[36:22] and this is what makes us different and
[36:23] in the in the message really so many
[36:25] thing the thing that makes us the the
[36:27] most different is our Doctrine when you
[36:28] go and you start talking about godhead
[36:30] and you start looking at original sin
[36:32] and even marriage and divorce and these
[36:34] different things uh predestination the
[36:36] way that we truly believe it it's not
[36:37] preached anywhere else generally
[36:39] speaking and you might hear a little bit
[36:40] of it here and a little bit there but in
[36:42] the full body that we have of Truth as
[36:44] we believe it you won't find that
[36:46] anywhere else and it's easy to sit there
[36:47] and say that's what makes us different
[36:50] and it is what makes us different but
[36:51] it's not our resting place it's not
[36:52] where we stop it's it's not the only
[36:54] thing that that we care about you know
[36:56] with with a little bit of study even our
[36:58] young people could confound many
[37:00] theologians today there's a a sister
[37:03] that I know from out west and she was
[37:04] doing a degree and it had nothing to do
[37:06] with religion but as one of her
[37:08] electives she had to do a religion class
[37:10] and so the professor had them write a
[37:12] paper on a certain Doctrine or a certain
[37:14] theological idea and so for her it was
[37:16] easy she just went to the message and
[37:18] she looked up what brother brandham said
[37:19] and she looked at the scriptures that he
[37:21] had pulled out of the scriptures and so
[37:23] she put it into her own words and she
[37:24] put it together and she handed it into
[37:26] him
[37:27] and he came to her later on and he said
[37:29] where did you get this he said you
[37:32] didn't come up with
[37:34] this why cuz he'd never seen the word
[37:37] put together that way he had never seen
[37:40] the the the Pieces come together in the
[37:42] way that she had put it together but he
[37:44] said you didn't come up with this why I
[37:46] believe he recognized Revelation when he
[37:48] saw it and she said I believe that God
[37:50] sent a prophet in this age and he was
[37:52] restoring us back to the full truth of
[37:54] the scriptures and this is what he
[37:56] taught us and this is what I believe but
[37:58] he was amazed it blew his mind the
[38:01] understanding that she had as a sister
[38:03] not as a minister not as a theologian
[38:06] but just a person that had been raised
[38:07] under the doctrines and truths of this
[38:09] message the full word being restored
[38:12] that this man that had taught it for a
[38:14] lifetime and studied it a lifetime she
[38:16] brought him something in a way that he
[38:17] had never seen it
[38:19] before but that's not the end of it
[38:21] that's not the end of it and Paul said
[38:23] you know we read in the scriptures where
[38:24] he says had leaving behind the doctrines
[38:27] and and of faith in Jesus Christ and of
[38:29] repentance of dead works and and these
[38:31] different things he says let us go on to
[38:33] Perfection from that place don't don't
[38:35] don't throw that away but you've got to
[38:37] move on from there you've got to come up
[38:39] from that place amen it's not enough
[38:41] Paul said to have this intellectual
[38:43] conception of of Doctrine or even the
[38:45] Mysteries we want the Mysteries we need
[38:47] a revelation of the Mysteries but it has
[38:49] to be a revealing not up here but a
[38:51] revealing that comes through us because
[38:53] that's what it's supposed to do it's
[38:55] supposed to change us it's supposed to
[38:57] do something inside of our lives and
[38:59] Paul said though I understand all
[39:01] Mysteries all Mysteries he's the prophet
[39:03] of the age if there's somebody that
[39:05] understand understood the Mysteries it
[39:07] was Paul and Paul said though I
[39:10] understand all Mysteries and have all
[39:11] Faith to move mountains without this
[39:14] Divine love without this charity he says
[39:16] I am
[39:17] nothing I am nothing there's no lower
[39:20] form than nothing you can't get lower
[39:23] than nothing you know what nothing is
[39:25] lower than nobody
[39:27] cuz nobody's at least a person there are
[39:29] no good person but at least they're a
[39:30] person but a nothing isn't even a rock
[39:32] or a piece of dirt or mud nothing means
[39:35] you don't exist there is nothing about
[39:37] you that would cause anybody to take
[39:39] notice of you you're are completely
[39:41] unworthy you're
[39:42] unnoticeable Paul says I'm nothing not
[39:45] just nobody but I'm nothing if I don't
[39:47] have that and that's what brother
[39:48] Brandon would get at when he get into
[39:49] the token in these things he says
[39:51] whatever you do make sure you get it
[39:54] because that's what's going to make you
[39:55] something that's what's going to make
[39:57] you something in the kingdom of God Amen
[40:00] brother Brandon would say this the in
[40:01] the message the working of the Holy
[40:03] Spirit CU he's trying to remind the
[40:06] people you the problem often isn't how
[40:08] you start it's how you get it's what you
[40:10] come into things change in our life and
[40:13] we start to think something of ourselves
[40:15] he says but long ago you remember when
[40:18] your heart used to be so tender and pure
[40:20] before God oh you didn't mind the
[40:23] troubles my it's all right just let it
[40:25] go on he says the first thing you know
[40:27] when you got that temper up and said
[40:29] I'll get back at him the dove took her
[40:31] flight the Holy Spirit cannot stand
[40:34] anything but
[40:36] gentleness God's gentleness and peace
[40:39] and loving no matter how much you know
[40:42] how much theology you know how you can
[40:44] stick your chest out and how well you
[40:46] can preach that doesn't mean nothing
[40:49] Paul confirmed it he's just repeating
[40:50] Paul's words here I am nothing Paul said
[40:54] he said if that quiet gentle quiet
[40:58] loving spirit of God doesn't rest on you
[41:01] it's all gone he says everything else is
[41:03] gone there's nothing there that's worthy
[41:04] to talk about you're nothing he says no
[41:06] matter how many gifts you can show no
[41:08] matter though Paul said though I can
[41:09] speak in tongues like men and angels I
[41:11] could have enough Faith to move
[41:12] mountains and Have Not That gentle Meek
[41:16] love I am nothing he says that's where
[41:20] your trouble lays remember last time we
[41:22] we talked about that that idea that we
[41:25] we're we're lips but no life we speak
[41:27] but we don't live it or or or we're
[41:29] words and no walk and there's nothing of
[41:31] true Eternal value unless you can come
[41:33] into this place which is the eternal
[41:35] life of God the Divine love of God
[41:37] otherwise you know what we are good
[41:39] citizens at best good citizens nothing
[41:41] wrong with a good citizen but good
[41:43] citizens aren't going into Rapture God's
[41:45] not calling out good citizens God's
[41:47] calling out a bride that's spotless
[41:49] that's perfect under the hearing and the
[41:51] application of the word of God in their
[41:54] life but Paul you know I don't want to
[41:56] focus so much on the idea that we're
[41:59] nothing but we're going to continue in
[42:00] that for a little bit but I want to
[42:02] start with what charity is first because
[42:05] we want to see how we compare to charity
[42:07] cuz Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 which
[42:09] we just read he says charity never
[42:13] faileth now now here's a here's
[42:16] something in life that we're never
[42:17] supposed to do and and if you're married
[42:19] you'll know this you are never supposed
[42:22] to make anything in absolute you're
[42:25] never supposed to say you never do this
[42:27] or you always do that because it's never
[42:31] true it's never true when we're talking
[42:34] about something somebody has as a habit
[42:36] they may often do it they may mostly do
[42:38] it they may regularly do it but they
[42:40] don't always do it or you say you never
[42:42] do this well no I do it occasionally but
[42:44] I don't do it as much as I don't do
[42:46] it and so what happens is we turn it
[42:49] into an absolute but Paul now this is
[42:51] the prophet speaking this is the holy
[42:53] spirit speaking through Paul says
[42:55] charity never fath that's an absolute
[42:58] and there's only one absolute you'll
[43:00] ever find and that's God God is the only
[43:03] absolute the word of God is the only
[43:04] thing and that word never fail it that
[43:06] word fails means never fails it never
[43:09] runs
[43:10] out it never becomes Obsolete and it
[43:14] never comes to an end that means you
[43:17] can't go around it you can't go above it
[43:18] you can't go under it you can't go
[43:20] through it it's everywhere and it
[43:21] surrounds and it's all powerful and it
[43:23] has it's the greatest thing that God
[43:25] could ever give us
[43:26] he says but whether there be prophecies
[43:28] they'll fail whether there be tongues
[43:29] they shall cease whether there be
[43:31] knowledge it shall vanish away and we
[43:33] spoke last service about how this
[43:35] expression of Charity has to come down
[43:37] into an Earthly expression and it's in
[43:39] how we treat people and how we respond
[43:41] or how we don't respond as the case may
[43:43] be but we know that humanly speaking
[43:45] eventually we hit the end of our rope
[43:48] there there just comes a point where we
[43:50] where we can't take it anymore we where
[43:53] stress gets to us where life gets to us
[43:55] where tiredness gets to us where the
[43:57] kids get to us the spouse gets to us the
[43:59] boss gets to us whatever it is and we
[44:01] hit the end of our rope and humanly
[44:04] speaking when we hit the end of the Rope
[44:05] bad things
[44:07] happen it that's the way it is but Paul
[44:10] says here there's something that we have
[44:13] available to us there's a remedy there's
[44:15] a resource that never fails that never
[44:18] fails and it's called charity it's a
[44:21] Divine love but otherwise without it
[44:23] what happens is eventually we get to the
[44:25] point where we say enough is enough and
[44:27] we we go to that person that's been
[44:28] throwing us under the bus we go back and
[44:30] we start saying the thing same things
[44:32] that the person's been saying about us
[44:33] we start giving as good as we've been
[44:35] getting and charity has no place in it
[44:38] but Paul says when you come into charity
[44:40] charity will take you on when you hit
[44:42] the end of the Rope charity will keep
[44:44] you acting the way you're supposed to
[44:46] act even if you don't want to there's no
[44:48] end to it you can't use up all of this
[44:50] charity Paul says when it's in you there
[44:52] is no end to it because he said charity
[44:54] is longsuffering it's kind it doesn't
[44:57] Envy it thinks good things about people
[44:58] doesn't get arrogant it loves the truth
[45:01] and it's able to Bear every burden
[45:03] that's put on it that's a phenomenal
[45:05] thing you know we we're looking for
[45:07] super materials today you know in
[45:09] engineering we've got carbon fiber Nano
[45:11] tubes and and we've got these these
[45:13] wonderful materials that we have now
[45:15] that can take massive amounts of
[45:16] straight straight uh of load and and
[45:19] they're extremely light and we can do
[45:22] amazing things with them but there's
[45:24] nothing we have that can take an infite
[45:26] load everything get has a breaking point
[45:29] but Paul says charity never breaks never
[45:32] runs out it never even
[45:35] weakens it just is and it stays there
[45:38] and it's unmoving and it's unbreakable
[45:40] and you can't change it we're we're a
[45:42] supernatural people we believe in a
[45:44] supernatural God and when it comes to
[45:46] this sort of thing it's a supernatural
[45:47] event in our life it's a supernatural
[45:49] experience because all of those other
[45:51] things were attributes they're built
[45:52] into us the the the seven things we
[45:54] talked about from faith all the way up
[45:56] to brotherly kindness as a child of God
[45:58] God's put them in your heart to do those
[46:00] things David had those things without
[46:02] the Holy Ghost you'll see it through the
[46:04] prophets you'll see it through the
[46:05] Believers throughout the Bible they had
[46:07] these things without having the Holy
[46:08] Ghost it's the nature of a Believer to
[46:10] have them but now we're coming into
[46:12] something that's beyond that and it's a
[46:14] resource that remedy I was talking about
[46:16] that's been made available to us and
[46:17] it's the one thing it's funny Paul says
[46:19] add to this charity and yet we can't add
[46:23] it we can't add it
[46:26] we can receive it but we can't get
[46:29] it we can take it but we can't earn it
[46:33] it's a gift that's freely given to us I
[46:36] can't do anything to make myself have
[46:38] this but I can go to the one that offers
[46:40] it and I can go through the process he
[46:43] requires that he'll give it to me amen
[46:45] if I'll come in in in the right way but
[46:48] we know that this is the greatest
[46:49] Supernatural thing in our life because
[46:51] it never fails he said there's there's
[46:54] gifts and there's tongues and prophecies
[46:55] and all these things people fail
[46:57] Ministries fail parents fail spouses
[47:00] fail Believers fail brother br's going
[47:03] to tell us how how how how much we can
[47:05] fail here when we read some quotes in a
[47:07] bit but he says charity never fails so
[47:11] that means it's not me I got to worry
[47:13] about what I got to worry about is do I
[47:15] have the charity that never fails I'll
[47:17] always fail eventually I'll always fail
[47:20] but if I've got charity and I can
[47:22] surrender to charity then as long as I'm
[47:24] surrendered to charity everything will
[47:26] work out I won't fail I can't fail amen
[47:29] everything man has come up with has
[47:31] failed everything that that that that we
[47:33] deal with in life has failed every every
[47:35] idea every technology has failed but yet
[47:38] Paul says charity never fails and I want
[47:40] you to catch this because he said what
[47:42] he's saying is without charity we're
[47:45] nothing we're nothing without the holy
[47:47] ghost in your life you are nothing when
[47:49] it comes to things of Eternal value amen
[47:52] we're we're a noisy gong we're
[47:54] Hypocrites we're failur we're incapable
[47:56] of getting out of Our Own Way much less
[47:58] helping somebody get out of their
[48:00] problems amen but I want you to catch
[48:02] this as much as we are nothing without
[48:04] charity with Charity we are still
[48:06] nothing that's the point is to stay
[48:09] nothing when you've got it because
[48:11] otherwise you'll fail because you're in
[48:13] the way of Charity the idea is to stay
[48:16] small when you get it to stay humble to
[48:18] make yourself nothing to get in a
[48:19] position where we truly believe that in
[48:21] this flesh dwells no good thing as the
[48:23] scripture says but if he's dwelling in
[48:25] it then that's all the goodness that
[48:26] we're looking for
[48:27] Amen brother B would say this speaking
[48:30] of Believers he says no matter whether
[48:32] they don't know their ABCs or not they
[48:35] can know Christ certainly never can get
[48:38] too
[48:39] low may God always keep that Spirit In
[48:42] Me sure I want that spirit in me I will
[48:45] not think I'm better than somebody else
[48:48] he says I could stick my chest out and
[48:50] say all the people stand when I come in
[48:52] or I have the greatest campaign of them
[48:54] all he could say those things thingss he
[48:57] could say that people stood when he came
[48:59] in the room he did have the greatest
[49:01] campaigns in the history of the world as
[49:03] far as we know it terms of size half a
[49:06] million people 30,000 come to the altars
[49:09] at one time signs and wonders like we've
[49:11] never seen since the times of
[49:15] Jesus he could say all these things he
[49:17] said who am I anyhow but the clay that
[49:20] God has made let me humble myself that
[49:23] his life will be reflected he said lets
[49:26] all Christians feel like that he says
[49:29] knowledge gets us nowhere we're not
[49:31] preaching Ignorance by any means we've
[49:33] got educated people in here we've got
[49:35] people that use the education and
[49:37] knowledge on a daily basis and uncommon
[49:39] knowledge they've had to go to school
[49:40] and get training they've had to get
[49:42] training on the jobs and we're not
[49:43] preaching about ignorance amen but when
[49:45] you tried knowledge you'll realize that
[49:47] eventually knowledge Runs Out Your
[49:49] Capacity for knowledge runs out and
[49:52] that's why you go to something greater
[49:53] than you is because you are the
[49:54] limitation there's more knowledge than I
[49:56] have capacity so I'm the limitation when
[50:00] it comes to knowledge and yet the
[50:02] knowledge if I could have it all would
[50:03] do me no good I would still come to the
[50:05] end of the of the road of knowledge it
[50:07] can only get me so far amen when it
[50:10] comes to the supernatural life of the
[50:11] believer knowledge is not our key
[50:13] knowledge is not the key faith is the
[50:15] key that opens the door knowledge
[50:17] doesn't open the door we need knowledge
[50:19] we've got to knows the these things I
[50:20] was reading in Acts the other morning
[50:22] where brother where brother Paul brother
[50:24] Paul yes exact ly Paul comes
[50:27] to the the this Altar and it says it was
[50:30] to the unknown
[50:31] God their knowledge ran out they knew
[50:34] there was something more than what they
[50:36] had but they didn't know his name or her
[50:38] name they didn't know who or what it was
[50:40] and Paul said let me introduce you to
[50:42] the unknown God the thing you've been
[50:44] missing the thing you know you need I'll
[50:47] I can tell you all about them and Paul
[50:48] LED them to a Christ and and and it was
[50:50] these and and he brought them to the
[50:52] Holy Spirit and these different things
[50:53] but knowledge is not our resting place
[50:55] but it's a part of the journey to get
[50:56] the Holy Ghost you've got to know who
[50:58] God Is by experience but you got to know
[51:00] him by his word and that means you've
[51:02] got to have knowledge it's a part of
[51:03] those seven attributes we talked about
[51:05] but we don't come before the Throne of
[51:07] God with our knowledge or our
[51:09] understanding we don't come to him with
[51:11] Lord I know there's no
[51:16] point brother brah said God loves to
[51:18] have his word repeated back to him so
[51:21] you don't come with your knowledge you
[51:22] come with his and you say Lord your word
[51:24] says and your word tells me this and
[51:27] your word tells me to do this and your
[51:29] word tells me to do that but you don't
[51:30] come in and sayl I know this or I know
[51:32] that no I know what your word says and
[51:35] that's where my faith rests but job was
[51:37] a perfect man according to God job was a
[51:39] perfect believer but job talked to God
[51:41] when things got tough and job got a
[51:43] little caught up in himself if you look
[51:45] in the scriptures why job thought he was
[51:47] something instead of nothing job got out
[51:50] of position God God had declared job to
[51:53] be the greatest believer on the planet
[51:55] job was so good that God bragged about
[51:57] him to Satan that that's how amazing
[52:00] job's Christian walk was if I could put
[52:02] it that way and yet what happened when
[52:05] things got tough job started looking at
[52:07] himself and thinking I'm too good for
[52:09] the problems that God has laid on my
[52:11] doorstep and job started thinking of
[52:13] himself to be great in comparison to God
[52:16] or even worthy of comparison to God and
[52:19] God didn't take it too well in job 40
[52:21] then this is what God said it said
[52:23] moreover the Lord answered job and said
[52:25] shall he that contendeth shall he that
[52:27] argues with the almighty instruct him he
[52:30] that reproveth God let him answer it so
[52:33] job job got dad got got dad job got God
[52:37] riled up and God said job are you
[52:40] serious you're going to argue with me
[52:43] and you're going to instruct me about
[52:46] what's going
[52:47] on are you
[52:51] serious and job answered the Lord and
[52:54] said behold I am
[52:58] vile sometimes
[53:00] church I think we really need to
[53:03] realize we're vile outside of the shed
[53:07] blood of Jesus Christ we are vile you
[53:10] know I was thinking on this just in
[53:12] preparation for this service
[53:14] and there is so much to shake our heads
[53:17] at in this
[53:19] world you look at people and you don't
[53:21] know whether to laugh cry or slap you
[53:25] just don't it is a mess out there and
[53:28] you know what it is easy to think that
[53:32] with our intelligence with our Common
[53:34] Sense we would never end up with th in
[53:37] the place that those people are thinking
[53:38] the things they do believing the things
[53:40] they do doing the things they do acting
[53:41] the way they act believing we think we
[53:44] would never get
[53:45] there but but for the grace of God we
[53:49] would be
[53:51] there because without the grace of God
[53:53] we wouldn't have had the parents we did
[53:56] we wouldn't have the family lineage we
[53:57] had we wouldn't have the genetics we did
[54:00] it is the grace of God in every aspect
[54:02] of our life that makes us able to to be
[54:05] what we are here
[54:07] today job said I am vile what shall I
[54:11] answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my
[54:14] mouth he said once I have I spoken but I
[54:17] will not answer yay twice he talked
[54:19] twice he said but I will proceed no
[54:23] further job was in a hole but he wasn't
[54:25] going to dig it any deeper he shuts up
[54:27] he says I'm just going to put my hand
[54:29] over my mouth and be quiet I'm vile now
[54:32] God talks to job for the next couple of
[54:34] chapters and job finally gets the big
[54:35] picture and realizes really what he is
[54:39] in job 42 it says then job answered the
[54:41] Lord and said I know that thou can do
[54:44] everything and that no thought can be
[54:46] withholden from thee who is he that
[54:49] hideth counsel without knowledge he says
[54:52] therefore have I uttered that I
[54:54] understood not he he said I said
[54:55] something I didn't understand truly he
[54:58] said and things too wonderful for me
[55:00] which I knew not God showed him things
[55:03] that he had no clue about hadn't even
[55:05] thought about and God said job tell me
[55:07] this and tell me this and tell me this
[55:10] and tell me this and job said I don't
[55:12] know I don't know I don't know I don't
[55:13] know I don't know in his heart because
[55:16] he had his hand over his mouth he
[55:17] couldn't
[55:18] answer he says here I beseech thee and I
[55:21] will speak I will demand of thee and
[55:24] declare unto me I have heard thee by the
[55:27] hearing of the ear he says but now mine
[55:30] ey seeth
[55:31] thee now mine ey seeth me he saw
[55:34] something he hadn't seen before he says
[55:37] wherefore I abhor myself and repent in
[55:41] dust and Ashes you reminded me of what
[55:44] it says in Revelation 3 when it's
[55:46] speaking to the Leo Dean Church age it
[55:47] says you're rich increased in goods and
[55:49] have need think you have need of nothing
[55:51] he says and you know not that your poor
[55:54] wretched miserable blind and naked and
[55:56] don't even know it job in the presence
[55:59] of God just hearing God give a little
[56:02] dissertation for a couple chapters
[56:04] realized I'm nothing I know nothing I
[56:07] have nothing I'm bringing nothing to the
[56:10] table here and I'm just going to shut up
[56:13] and listen for a
[56:14] while job didn't just repent because
[56:17] repentance is the key remember we've
[56:20] said it before brother Braham said the
[56:21] Zeal for this age is to repent to say I
[56:24] I am nothing compared to what I'm
[56:26] supposed to be I'm nothing compared to
[56:29] what God has for me and if I can stay in
[56:31] that place of understanding I'm nothing
[56:34] then he'll bring me into the riches of
[56:35] his goodness and Grace of the word but
[56:38] that word abore we think of that it's
[56:40] not a common word today but we think of
[56:42] it as as to to hate or
[56:44] dislike but it's deeper than that abhor
[56:47] means to
[56:49] refuse to reject to despise so so job
[56:52] said I refuse myself I reject myself I
[56:56] despise myself what's he rejecting his
[56:59] short-sighted knowledge his lack of
[57:01] understanding his idea that he knows
[57:04] something he's learned to reject himself
[57:07] so that God could do something greater
[57:09] in his life than has ever happened job's
[57:11] had a great life he's a tremendous
[57:13] believer he's been blessed he's done
[57:15] great charitable Works he's got a a
[57:17] fantastic relationship with God but as
[57:20] great as job is he is still His Own
[57:23] Worst Enemy he's still the one that gets
[57:26] in the
[57:27] way and he was thinking that he was
[57:29] something amen the only thing that holds
[57:32] us back in our lives that holds God back
[57:34] in our lives is us I'm My Own Worst
[57:37] Enemy especially when I get to thinking
[57:40] that I'm something that I know something
[57:42] that I have a some sort of depth or
[57:44] anything I may have more than I used to
[57:47] but in the big picture I'm still nothing
[57:49] and I know
[57:50] nothing brother R will put it this way
[57:53] he says but then the real real thing is
[57:55] this nothing in my arms I bring simply
[57:59] to thy cross I cling oh God naked come
[58:02] to thee for dress oh I most humbly come
[58:05] Christ confessing that I am nothing and
[58:08] there's nothing Within Me receive me oh
[58:10] God he's combining the the verses of
[58:13] that song and and some words of his own
[58:15] he says then God receives you now you
[58:17] might not even know your ABCs you might
[58:19] not know coffee from split peas you
[58:21] might not know right from left hand it
[58:23] don't make any difference what you don't
[58:25] know there's only thing there's one
[58:28] thing you must know that Jesus Christ
[58:31] took your place as a sinner and you take
[58:33] your place to stand in his righteousness
[58:36] Now watch how this looks confessing
[58:39] every day that you're
[58:42] wrong and love him with all your heart
[58:45] and your whole motives be set towards
[58:47] him he says you'll make
[58:50] Heaven before your feet Hit the Floor
[58:53] Lord I'm wrong and your word is Right
[58:55] Lord I love you help me to show it and
[58:58] Lord let my motive be to express you
[59:02] today he says if you do that you'll make
[59:04] Heaven he says that's all there is to it
[59:07] for the life that was in Christ has to
[59:09] be in you or your
[59:13] lost that's hard
[59:15] preaching but it's
[59:17] simple it's
[59:19] simple keep your eyes stayed on him keep
[59:22] your motives stayed on him
[59:26] motives he would say this in the message
[59:28] influence before we can get influence
[59:31] we've got to one recognize God that's a
[59:34] knowledge and that's an experience he
[59:37] says then we've got to be clean we've
[59:38] got to be Sanctified he says and then
[59:41] we've got to be humble and the only way
[59:43] you can be humble is you die to yourself
[59:45] and say I'm
[59:46] nothing he says we've got to get
[59:48] ourselves down and know and just keep
[59:50] imagining and knowing how little you are
[59:53] we tend to do the opposite as humans
[59:55] imagine how great we are he says get to
[59:58] imagining how little you are he says you
[1:00:00] are nothing I am nothing none of us is
[1:00:04] anything but he is all he is worthy of
[1:00:07] all praise oh Lamb of God what we need
[1:00:10] is to go back to the temple we need to
[1:00:12] go back to the altar of God and to make
[1:00:14] an altar in our own Hearts where that we
[1:00:17] can surrender ourselves and then see the
[1:00:20] Lord God of hosts come down in this last
[1:00:22] days and do what he did when he was here
[1:00:24] here first he says then you'll
[1:00:26] understand it and cry woe is
[1:00:31] me but see the problem with job is that
[1:00:33] job got into a rough place and he lost
[1:00:36] everything and job got
[1:00:39] indignant job was thinking I've been too
[1:00:42] good of a Believer for this to happen to
[1:00:45] me Jo thought his job thought his
[1:00:47] Perfection was about what he did and if
[1:00:50] you look in in the in the Book of Job if
[1:00:52] you go into chapter 31 it says that they
[1:00:55] the the the the the four that gathered
[1:00:57] around him shut up because they saw that
[1:00:59] job was righteous in his own eyes and if
[1:01:02] you read in Job 31 all he can say is I
[1:01:04] did this I I I I I he says when somebody
[1:01:08] was sick I I helped them out when they
[1:01:09] had needed food I gave it to them when
[1:01:11] there was poor I gave them money I
[1:01:13] shared everything I had I did everything
[1:01:14] I could there was nothing more you could
[1:01:16] have expected of my life I I I I
[1:01:20] I he got
[1:01:22] self-righteous what was it see remember
[1:01:24] job sacrificed every day and the
[1:01:27] scripture says he did it even for his
[1:01:29] children lest they made a mistake and
[1:01:32] didn't know about it but job forgot that
[1:01:34] he sacrificed for himself
[1:01:37] too if he was so perfect he wouldn't
[1:01:39] need the sacrifice but yet he sacrificed
[1:01:41] as well job forgot that his Perfection
[1:01:44] was through the grace of God not through
[1:01:46] his
[1:01:47] works it's not just what he did or what
[1:01:49] he didn't do but it's the fact that he
[1:01:51] was born in sin shaped in iniquity the
[1:01:53] same as the rest of us that he needed
[1:01:55] that sacrifice before him amen not job's
[1:01:58] actual performance was his Perfection
[1:02:00] but it was the grace of God and we know
[1:02:02] job got straightened out in the end and
[1:02:03] that was the grace of God it's the grace
[1:02:06] of God that keeps coming back to us you
[1:02:09] know if we were some great person if you
[1:02:11] know can you imagine you know brother
[1:02:13] Joe or brother Chad as as owners of a
[1:02:15] company or brother Mark as a senior
[1:02:17] manager or something and and you have
[1:02:19] some guy that just starts his first day
[1:02:21] and he comes up and starts trying to
[1:02:22] tell you how to do things and what
[1:02:24] you're doing wrong that's that's the the
[1:02:26] equivalent of job coming to
[1:02:28] God coming up and saying you shouldn't
[1:02:31] do this to me and you shouldn't do that
[1:02:32] and I've done this and I've done
[1:02:34] that God straightened him out most of us
[1:02:37] would just fire a person that did that
[1:02:39] to
[1:02:41] us God doesn't fire his
[1:02:44] children he brings them through the fire
[1:02:47] it brings them to a greater Revelation a
[1:02:48] greater understanding a greater place
[1:02:50] and job walked out of this with a
[1:02:52] revelation that he said My Redeemer
[1:02:53] Lives
[1:02:55] that was the greatest desire of job's
[1:02:56] heart and he came out of it but it took
[1:02:59] a conversation with god where job had to
[1:03:01] Humble himself and then God showed job
[1:03:03] the very thing that he'd been looking
[1:03:04] for through all of it but Paul had a
[1:03:06] better Revelation up front you know why
[1:03:08] cuz Paul got humbled immediately Paul
[1:03:10] had to get knocked off of his literal
[1:03:12] high horse and God knocked the took the
[1:03:15] sails out of his his wind out of the
[1:03:17] wind out of his sails knock the wind
[1:03:19] right out of him literally and he he
[1:03:21] lands and he realizes I'm nothing I I'm
[1:03:26] Antichrist Paul was a literal Antichrist
[1:03:28] for the first part of his life amen job
[1:03:31] had this Rich imagination of his own
[1:03:33] goodness but Paul said everything I have
[1:03:35] it's but dung it's poop it's nothing
[1:03:37] it's worthless I'm
[1:03:39] nothing and in that he would take us all
[1:03:42] the way over to Galatians 2 because Paul
[1:03:44] knew that his ability to be Godly was
[1:03:46] just as just as as good as his ability
[1:03:48] to fly he couldn't do it so Paul would
[1:03:51] tell us in Galatians he says I am
[1:03:53] crucified with Christ in other words
[1:03:56] Paul's saying I'm dead just as Christ is
[1:03:59] as Christ was I am dead I died with him
[1:04:02] and I'm still dead that's what he's
[1:04:05] saying I'm still dead but then he gives
[1:04:07] us this Paradox he says but nevertheless
[1:04:09] I
[1:04:10] live but there's a difference now in the
[1:04:13] life that he's living because he says
[1:04:15] yet not I but Christ liveth in
[1:04:18] me he says I'm still dead but there's a
[1:04:21] life in me and it's Christ that's living
[1:04:22] in me and that's why I can be the person
[1:04:25] I am today and do the things I do I was
[1:04:27] reading in the scriptures where it said
[1:04:28] God did special Wonders by Paul's hand
[1:04:32] God set him on a pedestal God did things
[1:04:34] through Paul that he didn't do through
[1:04:35] anybody else why because Paul realized
[1:04:38] I'm nothing he said the life I live he
[1:04:41] says uh which I now live in the
[1:04:44] flesh I now live in the flesh he used to
[1:04:47] live a life In the Flesh he's living
[1:04:49] another life but he's living a different
[1:04:51] life he's living by the same word but
[1:04:53] it's through the different lens why
[1:04:54] because he's got a holy ghost now he's
[1:04:56] got charity in his life and it's doing
[1:04:58] something different in him he applies
[1:05:00] the word he was blind but now we can
[1:05:03] see he said the life which I now live in
[1:05:06] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[1:05:08] of God who loved me and gave himself for
[1:05:11] me Paul's Paul's the one that's calling
[1:05:14] us to Perfection and he takes time to
[1:05:16] remind us that this is not going to be
[1:05:18] through your works this Perfection we
[1:05:20] have is not through our Deeds but it's
[1:05:23] through Christ himself it's through
[1:05:24] faith in Christ it's by the love of
[1:05:26] Christ it's the love of Christ in you
[1:05:28] it's the love of Christ for you it's the
[1:05:30] love of Christ that's doing the work in
[1:05:32] each and every one of us brother Adam
[1:05:34] puts this in that that same message of
[1:05:36] Hebrews he says perfected speaking of us
[1:05:39] absolutely spotless and blameless not
[1:05:42] one sin on us are you above Temptation
[1:05:45] he says
[1:05:49] never but I'm sinless spotless and
[1:05:53] blameless but not above
[1:05:55] Temptation do you sin every day yes
[1:06:00] sir but yet we are perfected because we
[1:06:04] are in him and God could no more judge
[1:06:07] us than nothing he couldn't be righteous
[1:06:09] he's already judged Us in him and when
[1:06:11] he judged Christ he judged me he judged
[1:06:14] you and he can't judge me again because
[1:06:16] he took my judgment if I've been
[1:06:20] redeemed he is the one that he's looking
[1:06:22] at remember Paul never said we never
[1:06:25] fail Paul said charity never fails
[1:06:28] Perfection isn't of us it's on the one
[1:06:30] that's inside of us amen we were judged
[1:06:32] in Christ when he died on Calvary and
[1:06:34] our Perfection is in a perfect sacrifice
[1:06:37] and God's looking now he looked at that
[1:06:40] that that lamb that died there that
[1:06:42] Bloody torn whipped shredded naked
[1:06:46] bleeding sinless man that of his own
[1:06:49] will and by his own love gave his love
[1:06:51] for you gave his life for you and I and
[1:06:53] he's looking at that that the reason he
[1:06:55] can see Perfection is because he's
[1:06:56] looking at that he doesn't even have to
[1:06:58] look at us he's looking at the
[1:07:01] Perfection of Christ amen and so if
[1:07:03] that's what he's looking at if we're
[1:07:04] going to go into Perfection it has to be
[1:07:06] a going into Christ Christ the person
[1:07:11] the word living out inside of each and
[1:07:13] every one of us amen that is perfection
[1:07:15] Christ is our Perfection that's our
[1:07:18] place of perfection that's our per of
[1:07:20] Person of expression uh of perfection
[1:07:22] and we're coming from God and we're
[1:07:24] going back to God and that's what he's
[1:07:25] looking at he's looking at our position
[1:07:28] in Christ he's looking at our place in
[1:07:30] Christ brother B says this he is that
[1:07:33] Fountain no other Fountain I know
[1:07:35] nothing but the blood of Jesus I'm a
[1:07:38] stinker he
[1:07:40] says the prophet of the age the seals
[1:07:43] have been opened it's a new book it's an
[1:07:46] open book and he says I'm a
[1:07:50] stinker I'm a
[1:07:52] renegade
[1:07:55] this is a an adopted son of
[1:07:58] God Prophet to the age seven Church age
[1:08:02] messenger the angel to the age and he
[1:08:04] says I'm a stinker and I'm a
[1:08:07] renegade unless we think anything of
[1:08:09] ourselves he says every one of us
[1:08:12] is if we stopped the service there what
[1:08:16] would we do he says but before God we
[1:08:20] are
[1:08:20] perfect he says be ye therefore perfect
[1:08:23] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:08:26] how can you be because a perfect one
[1:08:28] represents us there that Fountain is
[1:08:31] there every day fresh not something
[1:08:34] stagnated something but fresh every day
[1:08:37] that washes away all my sins he is that
[1:08:39] Fountain we're talking about coming into
[1:08:42] Perfection realize that we are nothing
[1:08:44] and saying that he is my sufficiency he
[1:08:47] is My All In All he is My Sacrifice he
[1:08:50] is my
[1:08:52] representation if every day we'd realize
[1:08:54] that we'd be so much closer I think keep
[1:08:58] it before us how's it going to happen
[1:09:00] how are we going to come into this
[1:09:02] Perfection how do you come in this
[1:09:04] Divine love this agape love this charity
[1:09:06] we're talking about brother Bram says
[1:09:10] this that's the way it is living for
[1:09:12] Christ you just love him with all your
[1:09:15] so heart soul and mind and go on that's
[1:09:19] all there's no evil can come out that's
[1:09:22] right cuz in here all things you're dead
[1:09:25] you are dead and your life is hidden God
[1:09:27] through Christ sealed in there by the
[1:09:29] Holy Spirit how's the devil going to get
[1:09:32] you when you get that charity he says
[1:09:35] just keep loving God and it cannot fail
[1:09:39] how can the devil get you you're
[1:09:42] sealed you're settled you're
[1:09:45] anchored we're on the boat to
[1:09:49] China he says you take a box car they'll
[1:09:52] start loading it and loading it on the
[1:09:54] track many of you people here know I
[1:09:56] know some of you that load cars they'll
[1:09:58] go around they'll call for so much here
[1:09:59] and so much there but before that car
[1:10:02] can be sealed the inspector has to come
[1:10:04] along he looks through and he sees that
[1:10:06] everything is in there is tight and
[1:10:08] everything is ready tight and ready he
[1:10:11] says it's going to its destination well
[1:10:13] if there's anything loose and he's
[1:10:15] afraid it'll break he'll say take her
[1:10:17] out fix her over again until you get it
[1:10:20] and when it's all together tightened and
[1:10:23] packed and set down that he'll slam the
[1:10:25] doors and seal it and no one can break
[1:10:28] that seal until it goes to its
[1:10:30] destination he says is that
[1:10:33] right he says that's the way it is where
[1:10:35] it says in Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the
[1:10:37] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:10:39] sealed into the day of your Redemption
[1:10:41] he says you got some loose rattles God
[1:10:43] will take it out of you and fix it up
[1:10:46] before you're sealed into the kingdom
[1:10:49] this is a shaking time this is a time
[1:10:52] where everything that can be shaken will
[1:10:53] be shaken amen we're when we're coming
[1:10:56] into the statue of a perfect man it's
[1:10:57] knocking out everything that's loose
[1:10:59] it's knocking out every bit of sand it's
[1:11:01] knocking every bit of humanity of all
[1:11:04] the Frailty that we have and it's
[1:11:05] putting in the attributes of God and
[1:11:07] it's strengthening and building us up in
[1:11:09] the stature of Christ and it's breaking
[1:11:11] us first and molding us and shaping us
[1:11:13] and then firming us up so that our life
[1:11:15] can be changed amen remember brother BR
[1:11:18] says he puts real material into the
[1:11:20] house that he builds it's tried and
[1:11:22] tested and it's been gone through the
[1:11:25] the quality assurance program and it's
[1:11:27] known what it is it's a known quantity
[1:11:29] that it's going to stand the test of
[1:11:31] time why don't we
[1:11:34] change why do we let the rattles stick
[1:11:37] around what is it he says you can't get
[1:11:40] in there with the
[1:11:42] rattles what is it that holds that
[1:11:45] back it comes from a refusal to hear or
[1:11:48] obey the full word of
[1:11:51] God Hebrews 12 Paul said see that you
[1:11:54] refuse not him that speaketh for if they
[1:11:57] escape not who refused him that spake on
[1:11:59] Earth how much more shall not we escape
[1:12:01] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[1:12:03] from Heaven whose voice then shook the
[1:12:05] Earth but now he ha promised saying yet
[1:12:08] once more I shake not the Earth only but
[1:12:10] also heaven and this word yet once more
[1:12:13] signifieth the removing of those things
[1:12:17] that are
[1:12:18] shaken this New Covenant this this this
[1:12:20] gospel is taking out those things that
[1:12:23] can be shaken he says as of things that
[1:12:26] are made things that are man-made things
[1:12:29] that are human that's all got to go he
[1:12:32] says that those things which cannot be
[1:12:34] shaken May
[1:12:36] remain God will shake anything that's
[1:12:38] not Eternal and move it on out so that
[1:12:41] all that's left is the stuff that'll
[1:12:43] stand the test of time you go to
[1:12:45] Revelation 3 and and and and John writes
[1:12:48] there that that it says hear what the
[1:12:50] spirit say to the
[1:12:52] churches
[1:12:54] that's what gets the rattles out because
[1:12:57] what happened is that the holy spirit's
[1:12:59] trying to say something but it's not
[1:13:00] coming by me or you it's coming by an
[1:13:02] Angel there's only one person ever got
[1:13:05] to hear what the Holy Spirit had to say
[1:13:07] for this age and that was the seventh
[1:13:09] Church age messenger and without that we
[1:13:12] know nothing we're in denomination but
[1:13:15] he comes and and the Seven Angel
[1:13:18] messenger comes and he shook up the
[1:13:19] denominations and he shook up the warm
[1:13:22] and fuzzy feeling that they had in that
[1:13:23] day because remember they were just
[1:13:25] putting their name on the books and
[1:13:27] signing this and they were baptizing
[1:13:29] this and sprinkling that and and getting
[1:13:31] their card of fellowship and thinking
[1:13:33] I'm going to make it and he said you
[1:13:34] can't do that you got to get the Holy
[1:13:36] Ghost you can't stop at gifts you got to
[1:13:39] get the person you got to get the giver
[1:13:41] of those gifts and what did he do he
[1:13:43] shook everything up and some people went
[1:13:46] and they said I can't take I can't be
[1:13:48] shaken and so they went and huddled in a
[1:13:49] corner with their other
[1:13:51] four but there were people that were
[1:13:53] called out and said that's me I know
[1:13:56] there's more and so they walked away
[1:13:58] from those things that can be shaken to
[1:14:00] come into something that could not be
[1:14:01] shaken and what was it it was the
[1:14:03] fullness of the word of God and he went
[1:14:05] in and he tore apart all of those
[1:14:06] doctrines and he tore down all of those
[1:14:08] denominational
[1:14:10] barriers he didn't care if you were
[1:14:12] black white yellow or red he didn't care
[1:14:15] about your education level he didn't
[1:14:16] care if you went to school he didn't
[1:14:17] care what your what Your the theological
[1:14:20] background was he didn't care what your
[1:14:21] family was he cared if you would hear
[1:14:24] the word and that's all he was looking
[1:14:26] for was somebody that would hear what
[1:14:27] the spirit was saying to the churches if
[1:14:30] you ever hear the word of God it'll
[1:14:32] shake your life it will shake your life
[1:14:35] to the very core it has to because there
[1:14:38] are things that can be shaken that have
[1:14:39] to be taken out without the shaking
[1:14:41] they'll remain
[1:14:43] amen what did the prophet messenger do
[1:14:46] he called a people to an overcoming
[1:14:48] position in Christ he preached Jesus
[1:14:51] Christ the same yesterday to today and
[1:14:53] forever he showed them their position in
[1:14:56] Christ and said you're not just called
[1:14:57] to it but you're prophesied to be in
[1:14:59] that place you're prophesied to be in a
[1:15:01] place of
[1:15:03] Victory and this word will come and
[1:15:05] it'll Shake us to the core it doesn't
[1:15:07] muck about it doesn't baby us it doesn't
[1:15:10] cudle us but it lays it in your lap it
[1:15:14] lays it in your lap and says this day
[1:15:17] that's what Moses did that's what Joshua
[1:15:19] did this day I give you the word
[1:15:23] choose choose you this day whom you will
[1:15:26] serve but as for me and my house we'll
[1:15:27] serve the Lord he laid it in their laps
[1:15:30] and Moses did it I've been reading
[1:15:32] Deuteronomy and my personal devotions
[1:15:34] and and and Moses I mean he wrote book
[1:15:36] after book of all this and then
[1:15:37] Deuteronomy he goes through and he does
[1:15:39] a CO's notes of everything they need to
[1:15:40] do he says you weren't here for the
[1:15:42] first bit you might have been too young
[1:15:43] you weren't around to see the original
[1:15:45] Miracles you wouldn't remember it he
[1:15:46] says so I'm going to lay it all out for
[1:15:48] you again and this is just days weeks
[1:15:50] before they go into the promised land he
[1:15:52] laid it it in their laps and he says
[1:15:54] here's what happens if you accept the
[1:15:56] word and here's what happens if you
[1:15:59] don't amen you know I was going through
[1:16:01] old me emails uh earlier this week and I
[1:16:04] had about 18,000 in my inbox going all
[1:16:06] the way back to 2004 and I realized I
[1:16:09] didn't really need them and as some of
[1:16:11] you know I'll use my phone as a
[1:16:12] dictation device and when inspiration
[1:16:14] strikes I'll just hit the the button on
[1:16:16] it and start recording and it
[1:16:17] transcribes it and I put it in an email
[1:16:19] and then I send it to myself cuz it'll H
[1:16:21] it can happen at work it can happen
[1:16:23] driving in the car can happen anywhere
[1:16:24] out for a walk and so I'd sent myself an
[1:16:27] email as I was going through these
[1:16:29] emails something caught my eye and I
[1:16:30] read it and it it just had this question
[1:16:32] here it said
[1:16:34] this why do people go to something at
[1:16:38] their level to get Deliverance or change
[1:16:42] or answers when what's at their level
[1:16:45] hasn't given them what they need
[1:16:47] already why do we go to something that's
[1:16:50] where we're at if where we're at isn't
[1:16:52] working if where we're at hasn't given
[1:16:54] us the answers we need remember what the
[1:16:56] a the the angel said to John he said
[1:16:58] come up hither he had to get up into the
[1:17:01] heavenlies he had to come up a little
[1:17:04] higher before he could understand things
[1:17:06] that were going on but in other words if
[1:17:09] if we look at this saying why do we
[1:17:11] think we can stay where we're at and get
[1:17:12] results we haven't yet
[1:17:14] gotten no I'm not talking about if
[1:17:16] you've been training and you can only
[1:17:17] lift 100 lb and and that means you'll
[1:17:19] never lift 120 if you fail today if you
[1:17:22] keep training that going to happen but
[1:17:24] if you hit a plateau that's what we're
[1:17:26] talking about is a plateau if you've
[1:17:28] been doing something if you've been uh
[1:17:29] walking a certain way if you've been
[1:17:31] training a certain way eating a certain
[1:17:32] way practicing learning and you can only
[1:17:34] come to here and then you stay there for
[1:17:37] a long time you've got to come up to a
[1:17:39] different level to move past that
[1:17:41] plateau and it's the hardest thing to do
[1:17:43] in weight training is you can work so
[1:17:45] hard but you get to a point where you
[1:17:46] can't progress and you've got to break
[1:17:48] the cycle and you got to do something
[1:17:51] different to get your muscles shocked
[1:17:53] out of their way but as a Believer we're
[1:17:56] not looking for shock but we're looking
[1:17:57] to come up
[1:17:58] higher you can come so far and you can
[1:18:01] get so much Victory and you can get so
[1:18:03] close to God but there comes a point
[1:18:05] where something's got to break
[1:18:06] something's got to
[1:18:08] change otherwise you're going to stay
[1:18:10] where you are you you know what the the
[1:18:12] old saying is right if you keep doing
[1:18:14] what you're doing you'll keep getting
[1:18:15] what you're
[1:18:16] getting and that's the way it is for us
[1:18:18] we never stand still brother brandham
[1:18:20] said he said we're either moving forward
[1:18:22] or backsliding and if you're not moving
[1:18:25] forward you're backsliding because the
[1:18:28] word of God keeps pushing us forward
[1:18:30] amen we've got to come up to a higher
[1:18:33] place and that's what Paul is saying
[1:18:34] with Charity you know when he said that
[1:18:36] he said I'll read it here he says for we
[1:18:39] know in part we prophesy in part he's
[1:18:41] saying we're not where we ought to be
[1:18:44] but there's a there is more to come and
[1:18:46] there's a way to get there amen we've
[1:18:48] got a taste we've got a portion we've
[1:18:49] got a spoonful we got a measure but
[1:18:52] Perfection is coming coming Perfection
[1:18:54] is available and it's through this
[1:18:56] Divine love he says but when that which
[1:18:59] is perfect is
[1:19:01] come you know he says when not
[1:19:04] if what a promise if it was if you'd
[1:19:08] Wonder but he says when that which is
[1:19:10] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:19:13] part shall be done away with that means
[1:19:15] there's a change between what we were
[1:19:16] and what we were doing and what we will
[1:19:18] be and what we will be doing and what we
[1:19:21] have something's got to happen in here
[1:19:24] something's got to happen that's
[1:19:25] different amen something's been done
[1:19:27] away
[1:19:28] with and something new has come and
[1:19:30] taking its place amen Paul's calling us
[1:19:34] to go into Perfection if if nothing's
[1:19:36] changing then what's happening is we're
[1:19:38] moving backwards we're stagnating and we
[1:19:41] can't be stagnant as Christians amen
[1:19:44] that means if there's more for us then
[1:19:45] there's a higher calling there's a
[1:19:47] higher place there's a higher sincerity
[1:19:49] there's a higher sanctification there's
[1:19:51] a higher humbling a lower humbling maybe
[1:19:53] we could put it that way a higher
[1:19:54] humbling takes you lower there's our
[1:19:56] Paradox for the day amen there's a
[1:19:58] greater love a greater Deliverance a
[1:19:59] greater
[1:20:00] Revelation there's a greater
[1:20:03] relationship to be had and it's going to
[1:20:05] come with me dying out to myself amen
[1:20:09] but look at this we're we're actually
[1:20:10] close to closing here this evening but
[1:20:12] look at this vision of the future that
[1:20:14] brother bradam gives
[1:20:15] us it's amazing because he does this in
[1:20:18] 1957 way before the seals are coming
[1:20:21] through and these different things
[1:20:24] but I want you to catch this Vision he
[1:20:26] says I believe it's coming to a time
[1:20:28] where Paul said where there's prophecies
[1:20:30] it shall fail where there's tongues they
[1:20:31] cease he says I believe it's coming to a
[1:20:34] time till when the saints will get
[1:20:36] together like this and just a love
[1:20:39] spirit will sweep over the audience and
[1:20:42] just every person in there all that's
[1:20:44] wrong will be taken out it'll be such a
[1:20:47] presence of the Holy
[1:20:49] Spirit he says I believe while we're to
[1:20:51] lay hands on them and pray for them now
[1:20:53] it's a contact maybe of a minister
[1:20:55] anointed and laying hands on just as a
[1:20:58] blessing to God but I believe it's
[1:21:00] coming to a time when God's church is
[1:21:02] going to be so called out so called out
[1:21:07] like that where the Saints will sit
[1:21:09] together and the Holy Spirit will just
[1:21:11] come in just woo just like it was on the
[1:21:14] day of Pentecost see and just heal the
[1:21:17] people raise up the people and great
[1:21:19] things he saysi beginning to see it
[1:21:21] happen he says ' but I believe the time
[1:21:24] is coming where it's going to be on a
[1:21:26] higher standard than that why he says
[1:21:30] after all these things is done away that
[1:21:32] which is Love Will endure forever see
[1:21:35] it's the love of God we'll just be
[1:21:38] standing preaching like this or talking
[1:21:40] and just the love will just settle over
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:43] building he says
[1:21:45] my he says you see this is the day of
[1:21:48] preaching this is the day when we got to
[1:21:50] move in and get Sinners and pull them
[1:21:52] out see what I'm I mean that's what the
[1:21:53] preaching of the word is for is to the
[1:21:55] Sinners and to bring them out but now we
[1:21:57] have to watch in there he says signs and
[1:21:59] wonders are done by the laying out of
[1:22:00] hands and so forth because it's
[1:22:02] preaching but I believe the time is
[1:22:04] coming when she's just about he says the
[1:22:06] church is about anchored away I read
[1:22:11] that and I ask the question does it
[1:22:14] matter whether you come to
[1:22:16] church you're not going to get that
[1:22:18] experience
[1:22:21] dreaming I know I'm preaching to the
[1:22:23] choir cuz you're
[1:22:25] here and we thank God that you know what
[1:22:28] when we're sick we can stream or if
[1:22:30] we're traveling we can do
[1:22:32] that but I like what brother Chad told
[1:22:34] me there a while back he said people
[1:22:36] something I'm I'm paraphrasing brother
[1:22:38] Chad people are choosing to stream
[1:22:40] services so much that they'll end up
[1:22:42] streaming the marriage supper of the
[1:22:46] Lamb you know I I listened to brother
[1:22:48] Donnie talk about this and he said you
[1:22:50] know that scripture where it says
[1:22:51] forsake not the assembling of your
[1:22:52] yourselves together all the more as you
[1:22:54] see that day approaching he says it
[1:22:56] means in
[1:22:57] person because you have to be there as a
[1:23:01] part of that body in the presence of the
[1:23:04] Lord in the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:06] that's preaching that's bringing that
[1:23:07] word to a people there's something about
[1:23:10] getting together that's essential to
[1:23:12] this amen but what is it people have
[1:23:16] sacrificed being in the atmosphere and
[1:23:18] the worship and the praise and putting
[1:23:19] their shoulder to the wheel and also
[1:23:21] getting the lumps rubbed off of them for
[1:23:23] convenience for a lifestyle or for the
[1:23:26] ability to control the message and the
[1:23:28] minister that they hear it's sad you
[1:23:31] can't be a part of that Vision I just
[1:23:33] read and sit in home and stream I'm not
[1:23:35] talking about people whose Church you
[1:23:37] know churches have fallen apart and
[1:23:39] they're stuck and they can't get
[1:23:40] anywhere we're not talking about that
[1:23:41] but people that choose to do it I say
[1:23:44] you can't be a part of this Vision
[1:23:46] that's hard but it's true you need to be
[1:23:49] there in person amen this is a house of
[1:23:51] perfection a house of correction rather
[1:23:53] but that correction takes us to
[1:23:55] Perfection cuz Ephesians 4 says that he
[1:23:57] gave a fivefold Ministry for what the
[1:24:00] perfecting of the Saints until they come
[1:24:03] in unity you're not in unity out on a
[1:24:05] computer somewhere you're in unity when
[1:24:07] you can look your brother or sister in
[1:24:09] the face you can shake their hand you
[1:24:11] can put up with them on the good days
[1:24:12] and you can put up with them on the bad
[1:24:14] days and you can love them when they're
[1:24:15] nice to you and you can love them when
[1:24:16] they're not so nice to you and you can
[1:24:18] help them when they don't deserve it and
[1:24:20] you can help them when they do deserve
[1:24:21] it and in a little bit of it they'll
[1:24:23] help you out too you might actually get
[1:24:26] something out of it amen but I'm glad to
[1:24:28] be here tonight I'm glad to be here
[1:24:31] gathered with Saints with Believers of
[1:24:32] like Precious faith that want to come in
[1:24:34] and hear the preaching of the word that
[1:24:36] want to get in the presence of God that
[1:24:37] want to worship God that want to thank
[1:24:39] God for what he's done and what he's
[1:24:40] doing anden there's something about
[1:24:42] gathering with the people of God that
[1:24:43] does a special thing I believe but I'm
[1:24:46] glad we can hear a word that calls us
[1:24:48] higher and not get offended cuz guess
[1:24:50] what to be called higher we have to real
[1:24:52] realize the
[1:24:53] need to understand that there's more we
[1:24:56] have to realize that we don't have at
[1:24:58] all that we have less than maybe we
[1:25:00] thought we did and that takes a humbling
[1:25:03] that takes a humility in our lives amen
[1:25:05] but it's a power that God gives through
[1:25:07] the preaching of the word that washes us
[1:25:09] and keeps us clean and unifies us and
[1:25:11] draws us together and knocks those
[1:25:13] little lumps off of us in the process
[1:25:16] amen how are we going to get
[1:25:19] there as we start to close brother Bram
[1:25:21] said this he said he speaking of Christ
[1:25:23] showed us how it's done what did he do
[1:25:25] how did he do it by the word that's how
[1:25:28] he did it for he was the word and Jesus
[1:25:31] said if you abide in me and my words in
[1:25:32] you you're back to word again the Word
[1:25:35] of Promise The Word of Promise This is
[1:25:39] an age of Promise it's an age of
[1:25:40] Prophecy it's an age of fulfillment he
[1:25:43] says what is the Word of Promise to
[1:25:45] every
[1:25:47] Christian greater is he that's in you
[1:25:50] than he that's in the the world we're
[1:25:53] talking about charity and he says
[1:25:55] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:25:57] that's in the world then how do I
[1:25:58] overcome he says it's not me but it's
[1:26:00] the word that's in me the word is God
[1:26:02] then I overcome the things of the world
[1:26:04] because it's the word in me if you abide
[1:26:06] in me my words in you then just ask what
[1:26:09] you will he says just keep pressing up
[1:26:11] you're coming to the top as sure as
[1:26:13] anything he's encouraging us then he
[1:26:15] says see you got to come to the
[1:26:18] top he's not he's not telling he's not
[1:26:20] trying to put pressure on us as the
[1:26:22] musicians come he's not trying to put
[1:26:24] pressure on us he's trying to say you're
[1:26:26] coming to the top you're going to come
[1:26:28] to the top you got to come to the top
[1:26:31] because the word says they'll overcome
[1:26:34] the word says they'll have Victory the
[1:26:36] word says there'll be a change in their
[1:26:37] life the world says the word says that
[1:26:39] it's going to be manifested in the
[1:26:41] Believers he's saying you got to come to
[1:26:43] the top God has already ordained it God
[1:26:45] has already spoken it God has already
[1:26:47] written it and he's given you an
[1:26:48] opportunity to read it and put your name
