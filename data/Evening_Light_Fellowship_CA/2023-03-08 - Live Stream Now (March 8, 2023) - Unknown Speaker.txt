praise the name of the Lord [Music] foreign [Music] amen amen praise the name of the Lord God bless you turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 8 as we go into the word amen amen Deuteronomy chapter 8. you're with me who try not to be too long amen hopefully maybe we'll just get out of time and into eternity that eternity have control amen not our natural feelings but brother I trust it's our faith in God and in Deuteronomy chapter 8 and beginning to read at verse 1 and he says all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall he observe to do that ye may live amen obey the word that you will live amen and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee amen God's been leading us for many many years and brother his desire is to Humble us more and more and more to the word and I believe rather than more and more we get the Revelation in our hearts the more humble we get amen because why we're getting more and more of the revelation of God he's revealing himself to you Amen in your heart in your soul and brother if there's anything it will do in your life it'll be it'll humble you amen it'll get us down to look up and to look up to him by the grace of God so again he said in verse 2 and thou shalt remember remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness amen so let's remember all the way that God has been leading us amen to Humble us so are we being humbled are we becoming more and more humble in our spirit in our attitude Amen in our actions in our reactions amen and he should enter prove thee and he said to know what was in thine heart amen brother if the prophet of God had been gone this long and there have been so many that we've been following the message for many years Brothers to prove what's in our heart always think that it the Rapture should have happened back there you know a number of years ago now we should not be here now but we should be in eternity but brother God is bringing hope what's in your heart amen brother oh yes all the way down Through the Ages God has had brought a message amen through a messenger took the messenger of the scene and the message and the and believing the people to and encouraging the people to go on with the message amen and to see if they would continue in their faith amen until he would come on the scene with another message amen then they would go and he would he would he would ordain that they would keep on going with that message amen all brother sister you consider what God did in Luther's day Wesley's day and even the Pentecostal age and he and he let them go on and on and on after he took the messengers off the scene amen what was it it was to bring over their faith to see it the unfortunately what they what what so many did was that they made a denomination out of it and brother that's not what he wanted them to do he wanted to continue in the in the Revival amen that he had started continuing the Methodist Revival continue on in the in the Lutheran Revival and then the Pentecostal Revival and other revivals amen that God started to to bring us to bring us to what to bring us to this revival the bride Revival Amen brother that was giving us Faith to believe God faith to trust God for this Faith to trust God for that because brother as time went on the knowledge and intellectual knowledge of man was getting greater and greater and greater and man was getting more and more faith in man and less faith in God Amen this is why God has allotted to go on and on and on through Lutheran Wesley the Pentecostals and other revivals that God has God has brought on the earth amen unto finally he would climax with a bright Revival amen brother sister but he had to bring out the faith that was in the elect he had to bring the faith that was that was in the bright praise the name of the Lord hallelujah that we will truly believe what he would do to give us resurrection and Rapture Faith amen we thank you we thank God for the faith of Luther and the faith of Wesley and the faith of the Pentecostals and man a number of others that God used amen praise the Lord Brother that's why it brings us on to the to the faith of the bright Revival amen for the faith praise the Lord they believed in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit but now God's asking us to believe in the resurrection and the Rapture amen praise the name of the Lord so do we truly truly believe in the resurrection do we truly believe in the Rapture are we expecting living morning noon and night expecting the resurrection Expecting The Rapture praise the name of the Lord so God help us to believe brother and sister amen that the dead in Christ are right there amen as a part of God's reason to do not ever I think not two feet from you at any given time amen they're right there and I tell you they're getting closer amen amen because that he is the problem God said he said the hours coming when the dead in Christ are going to appear to the living Saints amen praise the Lord and they're going to we're going to fellowship with them and then we're going to step into the dimension where they are amen and he said we'll be there for uh just we'll call it time and he did there for maybe 40 days or something like then then he said we're going to look up amen Amen brother oh praise the Lord we're going to look up and he said there's Jesus amen and brother is going to and we're going to be quickened into a resurrection and rapturing Faith we're going to be cracking and we're going to be caught up to meet him praise the Lord hallelujah we believe that he's here amen but the hours coming brother when he's going to change us more and more and more and we become more and more Sons and Daughters of God Amen and we can become more and more influenced by eternity and and more and more conscious of that dimension amen and we're going to get more and more conscious of that Dimension brother we're going to get more and more conscious of those that are in that Dimension amen they're going to come to us and we're going to come to appear to them the father of God said he said God is waiting on us and he said they are waiting on us the dead in Christ what are they waiting on in you they're waiting on the faith it's a faith that's going to bring them into time to appear to the living Saints amen it's a faith that's going to take us from time into eternity with them brother that's why the dead in Christ are waiting on us to come to that Faith so that we're going to live that Faith we're going to have that attitude amen amen we're going to have that Spirit we're going to have that anointing morning noon and night brother Hallelujah you're we're gonna we're gonna live that kind of life we're going to live a life that's not that's that's less and less conscious of this world and more and more conscious of Eternity National less conscious of what's going on in this world and we're going to get more and more conscious of what's going on in eternity well yes we're going to get more and more conscious of it and more and more influence with the resurrection and Rapture anointing oh we got to if we're going to experience it we got six move we got we got to become more and more conscious of what God is doing amen there's still too many they look oh God did this thank you Lord oh God you're going to do this thank you no God said what am I doing gotta be conscious of what he's doing amen so that oh we got the faith and we believe what he did we got the faith and we believe what he's going to do there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a Rapture but it's already here Amen brother listen he was bringing that Faith two thousand years ago when he came in the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ and brother that same Faith he wants us to have in the flesh of the Bride Mrs Jesus Christ amen because he challenged Martha and Mary amen concerning the Lazarus oh yes he said he'll rise again well yes they said he that you know they were looking two or three thousand years as far as they were concerned into the future at the time of the Resurrection oh yes he arrives then he said he said I am the resurrection amen father is not two thousand years up the road it's right there and then I am the resurrection he said and brother he wants us to have that Revelation now whether we're not going to oh we're waiting for the resurrection waiting for it he's here Resurrection is here the dead in Christ was raised in the ministry of Malachi 4. amen prophet of God highlighted the fact that that God did that for a reason to let us know that he's here the resurrection is here this is the hour of the Resurrection this is the hour of the Rapture by the grace of God God help us to believe Praise In The Name of Jesus Hallelujah brother God has called us through this word and God is bringing us into a Oneness with the word one is with the message amen praise the Lord and in getting to the place where we won't be able to forget it we won't be able to get away from it amen morning noon and night we'll be thinking about the resurrection we'll think about the Rapture we'll be thinking about Jesus oh my brother's sister praise God have mercy on us brother Are we more and more conscious of Jesus than they were in previous generations and previous ages amen well brother sister they were they as conscious of Jesus you know back in previous ages as we are we're supposed to be now not really because why because they had to keep moving on in in the in the world they were in they God wanted to believe this or believe what he did justification of sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost gift of the spirit but still they had to keep moving on Amen in the natural Realm and because God that God still require them to have the faith to go on and do this in the natural do that in the natural just trust the Lord amen but now he's taken the bride out of the natural into the spiritual at a time and into eternity to make us more and more and more conscious of Eternity the grace of God be with us brother sister amen so that we're looking for the resurrection looking for the amen the rapture oh I know things going on in the world and and we get we get the oh we get the news we see them this this nuisance here this news and see this news and maybe read this and read that oh yeah and we won't get one more conscious of it we feel this we feel that but brother are we sensitive to Eternity to the real Resurrection to Jesus is this world more real than Jesus amen is this world more real to us than the world to come to where we're going amen is this life more real to us than the resurrection father it's going to get to the place where Resurrection is getting going to get more real this life we're going to get caught up more and more and more with the resurrection and the revelation of the rapture we are with this the life we're living here oh yes most definitely you talk about being that they're going to call you for Fanatics and and then they'll think you're you're an idiot you know you're religious religiously you know insane and so on oh that's all right let's move on to consider Jesus the same thing yeah they considered even so-called Believers back there two thousand years ago they're insane because they believe this they're looking for this looking for that yeah because eternity was with them in flesh and now brother eternity is with us and Eternity is in US amen grace of God amen I don't know where he went let's read verse 3. and it says the humble be and suffered thee to Unger amen and fed thee with Manna which thou knew us not and neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee no make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does Man live God bless his words you may be seated sorry to keep you standing so long but as I said before I don't worry about that because I said if they're out there in sports figures and sports games they'll stand for hour two or three hours to witness this sport or witness that sport witness this going on that going on and then and then there are those that are complaining because if they got to stand for now half hour in a church Amen brother but that's in time we're in eternity praise the Lord and if we're more subject to Eternity than we are time we won't be too conscious of standing up and waiting not by any means God help us to believe amen amen to believe that we are the sons and daughters of God Amen we are not creatures of time but we are creatures of Eternity amen we cover the eternity and we're going back to Eternity amen God bless you turn with me to the Book of Proverbs chapter 16. Proverbs chapter 16. and beginning to read at verse 16. he says how much better is it to get wisdom than gold amen and the wisdom that we're seeking is the wisdom of God because man is seeking the natural wisdom so that he'll get more gold and he'll be able to do this and do that and again get a great greater and a better job and so on forget it amen it's not it's not your will it's the will of God Amen so how much better is it to get wisdom and it's not in the wisdom of man but the wisdom of God amen then gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver amen the highway of the upright is to depart from evil and he that keepeth his way preserveth is so amen stay with the word amen give the word preeminence in your heart give the word preeminence in your life amen you're not living for this world you're living for the world to come you're not living for yourself you're not living for living where your mom and your dad and your grandma and grandpa's amen you're not living all that personality he's my boss no no you're living for Jesus amen you're going to give him the preeminence by the grace of almighty God as I've said before that even when I when I was in in the we're working out there in in the world so to speak and part of the the stores and back there and uh part of management and people knew oh oh yes they knew that I was a Christian and they knew that I would pray for this and pray over that and so on oh yeah and then there was time when I I think one time there there was an issue came up and one of the managers came out talking to me and uh I said okay I'm gonna I gotta go in here and I said I'm gonna I'm gonna pray about it and ask the Lord about it amen it's not something that they would do but they knew that it wasn't unusual for me to do amen so brother sister are you where you work are you working as a Christian amen are you living as a Christian oh yes but I tell you this God requires it of you and I had to get older I I'll lose my job no there are times when you might lose a job but then there there are there are times when they'll respect you more because of your faith why because I've been I've experienced that when I was in the retail business and I was in part of part of the management there and and I sometimes I would be standing at a certain time and maybe my eyes were closed and they knew that I was meditating they knew I was praying and so on oh yeah and other managers have come and said excuse me Mr Lush I know that you're you're this and you're that and so on but I said I just want to remind you of this but they would let me go on meditating oh yes that's all right they said when you get the time amen so brother are you really living as a Christian where you where you work are you working as a Christian amen are you acting and reacting as a Christian amen do you talk as a Christian amen oh yes by the grace of God I thank God for that Grace in my life that Grace in my heart no matter where I was whether I was working for the military where I was working as as as a as a assistant cook or Chef as it were no matter what I was doing brother I did it as a Christian and they knew they knew I was a Christian amen and they would respect me and they would they would be careful of what they said in my presence they didn't want it they didn't they wouldn't swear or curse or anything like that oh excuse me excuse me didn't mean to do that sorry you know they would apologize so brother are you living that life in your job amen and that they know you're a Christian God help us my brother been not saying that you've got to be a fanatic and you got to be you know witnessing to this witnessing that no no you just got to go and act like a Christian and talk to you know just be normal and and be honest be sincere as a Christian you don't didn't have to talk religion honestly honestly God opened the way for you to do it then you would do it other than that you just wait on the Lord because there are those that I'll be honest there are those out there as professing Christians but they're fanatical oh yeah and they want to tell them this and tell them that about Christianity about Jesus about that you wait on the Lord let God let God open the way and brother God will give you the wisdom to speak amen so God help us whether that we're going to go out there and we're going to represent Jesus amen but brother let's let's do it with the right spirit and a right attitude amen not phoneticism but the right Spirit and the rate of let's be led by the spirit amen again in Proverbs 16 and verse 16 how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver amen God help us that we're going to give Jesus the preeminence no matter what we're we're doing if you oh yes even if you're eating if you you lose your job stay with Jesus because there are those that compromise to keep their jobs oh yes I've seen that I've experienced those things among others but by the grace of God I wouldn't compromise not by any means I just seek the wisdom of God and the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen and brother if you do it right you got a right attitude right Spirit they respect you oh yes those you work with they'll respect you but then there are those the fanaticals I call them and but they're not using the wisdom of God they're not using the right spirit and right attitude and they're just religious and they want to say this to say that say that you know they don't respect that you've got to have a right attitude and a right spirit amen so he said that verse 17 the highway of the upright is to depart from Evil and he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul amen Pride goeth Before Destruction and an Aussie spirit before a fall better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud God requires anything is humility and brothers you got the anointing God's anointing in your heart and your soul in your life you will be humble oh yeah they'll recognize that those that you work with will recognize that amen that oh yes he's a Christian and you know because they know he's humble amen he's he's not he's not thinking he's a big big this and big that and always humble by the grace of God amen you got a right spirit and a right attitude so begin in verse 19 better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud God have mercy on us amen just a couple of other scriptures Philippians chapter 2. the book of Philippians chapter 2. amen concerning humility humble yourself as a Christian humble yourself as a Believer if you got the rate of 19 you got the right spirit amen you will be humble amen you want you won't be ashamed of of what you believe you won't be afraid of what you believe you won't be afraid to be a witness and a testimony amen but you'll be led by the spirit amen led by the Holy Spirit and yet there's too many so-called Christians there's too many so-called even Believers brother they just don't have the wisdom of God Amen they're very religious but they're not spiritual amen abide I did that are you religious or are you spiritual spiritual you're led by the suspect the Holy Ghost Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God Amen but again there are those that are religious and that's it Satan's anointing if it's the devil you don't you don't want you to be spiritual but he'll make you religious oh yes Satan to make you religious brother if there's anything that the devil is is hiding in out there is religion oh yes but brother the Holy Ghost is love is hiding in in not in a sense ID but is revealed in this in the revelation of his word god oh yes God in and God revealed in so praise the Lord amen go forth as a Christian revealing Jesus Christ amen by the grace of God amen so it was Philippians 2 and Philippians 2 and verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant amen and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself amen and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross if Jesus give us the example of anything it was humility because he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross God help us to Humble ourselves Amen to the truth to the word that will stay with the truth we'll not be ashamed of it will not be afraid amen but we'll have that Holy Ghost boldness but with Holy Ghost leadership First Peter chapter 5. amen fourth as a witness you go forth as Sons and Daughters of God brother and if you are a son and daughter of God you'll have the humility of God oh yes not arrogance brother if there's anything I believe the prophet of God had was humility he didn't he didn't go around to witnessing this witnessing that and I and I being as old as I am I remember the experience and testimonies of this preacher this preacher that preacher and they were you know World International preachers and so on and like I said most of them are gone now but they never had the humility that the prophet had no no they they went and oh yes they had this kind of ministry that kind of ministry and they were puffing up their names they're puffing up their Ministries amen they were getting the glory oh yes brother so and so and this brother this brother this this evangelist this evangelist that evangelist amen oh yeah and the whole world knew knew all these evangelists but who was William Branham amen he was God hidden and revealed in simplicity amen the world was highlighting the other Avengers I won't mention their names well I could because most of them are gone on now oh yeah but but again back then they were oh yeah they wanted to they wanted to become famous to the world and their names were known around the world Amen and then not and none of them had the ministry like brother William Branham made none of them had had the discernment that would impranimate and could do what William random did no no but again they were they were highlighting their Ministries and again of course they were pressing on and get tried to get money as well but again William Branham didn't do that William Branham was in Simplicity he wasn't he wasn't there to show off his ministry he wasn't there to show off the gifts not by any means and neither did Jesus amen God help us brother because I tell you this even Jesus with his ministry we know that when he laid out the word the Bible says 70 of his disciples walked back and walk no more with him amen when brother Bradham began to get into the word the message of the revelations brother there's many that's that that's it they wouldn't have nothing to do with William Branham amen and and as we get more and more into the word there are believers even today that don't want anything to do with William Brown the message no I witnessed a lot that have come to the word and have moved away from the word over the last 40 years or 50 years yeah God help us to stay with the word God help us to stay with the message amen and when I say stay with it I don't mean that just the letter of it or or or the revelation of this doctrine that Doctrine but brother let's stay with what God's doing amen brother he's not God is Not does not wanting us to focus on Doctrine no no he wants us to focus on the resurrection and the rapture brother they're going to be there's going to be those that are left behind and they'll have a right Doctrine but they but they'll miss the resurrection and they'll miss the Rapture amen because they focused on the letter of the word not the spirit of the word amen and there are those that are focusing on the letter of the message but not the spirit of the message amen we could consider other messages that brother Benham had preached and they're focused on the title of it but what about the revelation of it oh the title of this message the title of that message brother you got to go beyond the title to the revelation just a couple of messages that I got here all right why Christ speak do you have the revelation or is it just just a thought oh the William Brown said this William said that and so on but brother do you have the faith that he was emphasizing amen or the message humble yourself amen fall there are those that would ignore these this message they'll maybe put more emphasis on what Christ speak or they'll put more emphasis on Christ The Mystery of God revealed then this then they'll ignore this humble you oh this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he'll and I like highlighted this I like that I like that and this Doctrine and that Doctrine or serpent seed and so on but what about this this message here humble yourself you can have you can have the doctrines but if you're not humble it won't do it all good for God to do what he wants to do in you with you through you you've got to be humble yourself God is bringing us to that through the message there's too many just caught up with the with the doctrines around the message but how many are caught up with the with the faith that God has given us in the resurrection and the rapture oh yes oh we have Christ The Mystery of God revealed thank God for that or this this Revelation this this message and that message and so on yes but you got that Faith but do you have resurrection and rapturing faith they're emphasis they're putting too much emphasis on just the letter of the word but not the spiritual revelation God help us amen let's focus on what God is doing not what he did what's he doing amen and brother if there's anything that God's doing right now oh my he's getting getting us more and more and more into a rapturing faith gideth more and more closer to Eternity and getting us less and less conscious of time more conscious of Eternity God help us how many Believers are more conscious of Eternity and less conscious of time there's too many still living for this world still living for the what what what the enemy is offering them in this world but how many are living for what God is offering in the world to come God help us brother because Martin Luther he was focusing on not this world but the world to come amen because Alleluia the justification that he preached was from time not time from time to Eternity amen sanctification eternity oh yeah the baptism of the Holy Ghost eternity it's God coming out of Eternity into time to change us and take us back to Eternity God help us let's brother let's not focus on the letter of the word the letter of the message because to do that we'll become more and more denominated like a denomination that's what they did down through the years what God did the spiritual revelation of his word they made it made a denomination out of it and brother there's many around the message are making denominations out of the different doctrines of the of the of the prophet God help us First Peter chapter 5. and verse 5. likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility amen humble yourself be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and giveth Grace unto the humble amen and any thought that I wanted to leave with you tonight brother is humility is to encourage you to humble yourself Lord and brother sister if the if the word is going to have any influence in your life it's humility if the word is going to do anything to you the message doing anything to you it'll humble you if you really got it in your heart not in your head but in your heart you it'll humble you amen he's putting us down to get us to look up amen by the grace of God so brother the prophet of God highlighted humility and in 1963 he preached the message humble thyself amen he said in the message humble thyself he said I won't ask anybody to go anywhere he said that I don't go first he said to find out whether it's right or not I wouldn't ask any person to make a step he said he said in God that I hadn't already made and know that it's the truth amen first it must be the word of the Lord and then I inspect and see if it's right and then if it's right then I can say come on up this way see it's making the way and he said now I think any Minister ought to do that and ought to go first go himself he is supposed to be a leader of people not speak something that he wouldn't put his hand on himself he said we would go there leaders of the people but you got to include yourself subject to the word amen so he said now he said I think maybe next Sunday morning that we would have a healing service but I think he said with the message this morning he said the way the Lord seemed to lead me to bring it out ought to ever encourage us a little to really believe amen he said we play around we say different things we talk about them but then he said when it comes to a showdown there's something different amen he said it's different when you're included in it yourself amen when it comes to the word include yourself don't condemn everybody else put yourself there people are taking the word taking the message amen and they're applied to this one apply it to that one that one this and that and so on and they condemn but what about yourself brother if there's anyone that you gotta play the word to First is you amen you've got to line up to the word amen you've got to humble yourself to the truth it's not it's not trying to impersonate others and try to get them to humble yourself humble yourself brother what they're trying to do is get them to Humble to themselves amen but let them humble themselves to Jesus amen praise the Lord so that they're going to reflect Jesus amen not reflect the preacher it's reflect Jesus amen and there's many today that are reflecting the preacher reflecting the pastor if you're like this one they're like that one but how many have reflecting Jesus God help us amen humble yourself to Jesus not it's not all mean yourself to the pastor not only yourself to the Evangelist or to this preacher that preacher no humble yourself to Jesus amen so he said Egypt did be different he said when you're included in it yourself and he said now he said That's mighty good for us just to say here he said amen when you include yourself amen we agree with you brother amen it's pretty it's mighty good for us to say I believe that's true but then put it into action he said you got to put it in action you've got to put an action in your life in your heart in your soul amen and let God have control praise the Lord he said as I brought that statement this morning he said the people was laid in the shadow of Peter and they never ever asked for prayer and he said I have witnessed into many homes and he said watching this pray before I go and just go in there with the anointing and don't even pray for the people and walk out and they are healed praise the Lord he wasn't looking for the give himself attention to give himself preeminence it was to give Jesus pre-evidence amen so that he would go in and the anointing was there and the people were healed I mean and he didn't pray for him he said but he just went out and when he went left and went out he said they were healed amen so it was they couldn't give the glory to William Branham or he prayed for me and I got healed no no he didn't pray it was the anointing of God that was with the prophet amen when he went in amen and the people there were believing and calling on the Lord and when the prophet turned around and went out they were healed he said God was giving the glory to Jesus not to William Brown amen sees it and don't even pray for the people and walk out and they are healed and he said I have seen it done so many times and he said you've got to have somewhere to place your faith and he said you've got to believe it and I believe that the hour is approaching and now he is Amen brother that's the faith God's looking for in you and me is not oh so and so prayed for me so and so did this and oh and oh yeah and I experienced this no no it's your faith it's not putting the giving giving this the glory to this one the glory to that one brother what about you and Jesus it's your faith do you believe oh we're depending on this one to pray for me I want this one well that's fine but it's got to be your faith amen the problem of God could go in and pray for somebody and they'd be healed but again he could leave and they get sick again he could come back on him but brother let's give the glory to Jesus let it be your faith Jesus Jesus questioned Martha and Mary again believe us thou this brother we've got to Humble ourselves to the revealed word we've got to Humble ourselves to what God is revealing what God is showing us Grace oh God help us to be sincere believers Grace amen brother he's not again you it's got to be Jesus in you let's give him preeminence oh well you go and live this way and you're going to go on yeah dress this way you're going to act this way no no yeah if you do but make sure you give him preeminence give the glory to Jesus why do this and I do that wait a minute you can only do it with his help amen the grace of God in you amen he said listen I think any Minister ought to do it he said ought to go first himself and he's supposed to be a leader of the people and not speak something that he wouldn't put his hand on himself he said we should go we should go there leaders of the people amen and what are you encouraging encouraging them to believe not believe you but to believe the word to believe Jesus and he said now I think he said maybe next Sunday morning if the Lord willing he said I'd like to have a healing service just dedicated only to healing and he said I think with the message this morning he said the Lord seemed to lead me to bring it to bring it out and he said he ought to kind of encourage us a little to really believe and he said we play around we say different things we talk about them but then when it comes to a showdown there's something that's something different amen God's going to bring you to The Showdown of your faith amen it's not oh well this this brother got got this gift and that brother got that gift and this brother laid hands on them and they were healed that one laid hands on they were healed listen brother they're giving they're giving the the preeminence to the preacher they're giving the preemness to the evangelists amen that's why there are certain evangelists that went forth with with signs and wonders in in the 20th century amen and the people give give the glory to the preacher but not to Jesus amen they give the glory to this evangelist and that evangelist oh brother I tell you oh yes to a time when they give the glory to Oral Roberts to give the glory to teal Osborne they're giving the glory to A.E Allen amen oh he prayed for me and and I was healed amen this will pray for them and they were healed no it was Jesus amen Jesus healed them amen but but what what happened was the evangelists and the preachers got got the pre got the preeminence they got the praise but not Jesus amen now he said it's different he said when you're including it in yourself and he says mighty good for us to say here amen is mighty good for us to say I believe that's true but he said then put it in action as I brought that statement this morning the people was laying in the shed yeah Lane in the shadow of Peter they never even asked for prayer and he said I went into many homes and he said watching this pray before I go and just go in there with the anointing and don't even pray for the people and walk out and they are healed see he said that's right I've seen it done so many times and you have got to have somewhere to place your faith you've got to believe it and I believe that the hour is approaching and now is You've Got to Believe amen oh brother if God is challenging anything it's our faith and brother back then the emphasis was on healing and signs and wonders but now it's on the resurrection and the rapture believeth thou this amen we're challenged like Mary and Martha concerning Lazarus you'll Rise Again believeth thou this amen oh yes you arise in the resurrection he said I am the resurrection Believers thou this they couldn't quite catch it amen grace of God brother do we believe now in the resurrection and the Rapture are we looking now for the resurrection and the Rapture are we hindering now more and more into the revelation of the resurrection and the Rapture what God not what God will do what God is doing God help us amen please in the name of Jesus let's focus on the rapture well today in grace are just there they're not by the way as I said there's so many focused on the cemeteries and they say oh there's so many people dead there they're not there I'm sorry they're not there no they're right here the dating Grace so many so many of us think they're still in the graveyard they're not that's the Bible says what was buried in the graveyard thus Thou Art not the thus shall thou return that goes back to the to the dust as it were but but that's fine during that during the resurrection they're going to come forth in a glorified body amen there's and the prophet of God said they're not two feet from yet any given time to date in Christ waiting on us to believe the resurrection and the rapture amen Lazarus didn't have to wait very long back then oh no Jesus came on the scene and his Lazarus come forth amen and he came forth are we going to call the dead in Christ to come forth from the dimension they're in they're waiting on us about sorry that there's not going to be many here living Saints for the rapture because it's even Jesus questioned when the son of man comes will he find faith on the Earth for the resurrection for the rapture do you have faith do you have faith do you believe God are you believing God on a daily basis are you believing God every hour because I tell you this brother in case we're living in the world getting to that place where we need Faith 24 7. we need faith not just when we're conscious even when we're unconscious even when we're asleep amen you go to sleep faith is in control you wake up Faith is in control amen through the day Faith is in control in your jobs faith is in control by the grace of God yes and you would most certainly need faith in this service tonight oh yeah if it's not Faith well not everybody but there's there's a few that wouldn't wouldn't even bother to come back if you never had the faith that please God Faith to believe the word Faith to believe that it's God speaking to you faith that is God encouraging you faith that is God giving you what you want and what you need amen what you need God's given you to give you the faith that please pleases God amen brother there's so many that they'll come under the ministry they'll that'll preach this and give them this Faith give them that Faith give them that Faith but how many are coming under the ministry to give them the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture because there's going to be so many left behind because the Bible is highlighted the fact that he said that there's going to be very few living Saints he said that'll go in the resurrection go in the rapture there won't be many left there he said on the Earth because more and more are getting just denominational around the message or they are I'm sorry but again I I should have maybe highlighted the quote and what the prophet of God was saying there's going to be so few living Saints on the earth at the time of the rapture and brother we're gathering together as Believers if our if our motive and objective is right we're Gathering Together on a Wednesday and a Sunday for the hearing of the word and The Fellowship of the Saints what for to to what for to build up our faith to strengthen our faith to encourage our faith in what in the not just the message of the hour or in this Doctrine and this Doctrine this doc no yes we thank God for that amen but what about the faith for the resurrection what about faith for the rapture what about faith to get out of time and into eternity God help us to be more conscious is the Resurrection The Rapture as I said there was a couple of times that I went to a in the into the mall and I was walking down the mall and then all of a sudden I I saw somebody I said who's that I said no it can't be them is it I thought it was a saint that I had known for years but had they had been gone for years I thought oh I better get up there closer and see see if it's there if it is it's the resurrection it it's the rapture oh yeah just a few times I've experienced that and I've seen people and thought and thought it was believers yeah that had gone on and one of these days we're going to see them they're going to appear to the living Saints amen and we're going to oh yeah but they're going to be younger they're going to be not going to be in the old bodies they went down in they're going to be in it yet they're going to be look young grace of God that will be in the spirit to recognize them amen God help us and I would encourage our younger generation here because I tell you it's going to be a greater and greater and greater challenge to their faith concerning what's going on in the world and concerning what the devil is doing to keep to keep their attention and to get us away from the word to focus mainly to all just religion no no there's too many religious people not not but are you spiritual don't be religious be spiritual amen utterly Satan Satan is there to make you religious but God is there to make you spiritual amen God help us he said listen he said this what I was speaking of this morning has brought us right to a climax and that's the reason that I'm going to take next Sunday and he said for a healing service and then this morning bringing it right up now to the last poll amen we are in the time of the third pull he said now it's my time for consecration to God and he said God's time to speak to me and he said I must just have a little change in my own life and he said I want to feel a little more closer to the people feeling more closer to our brothers and sisters in the word in the message if we got the Holy Ghost if we are the bride if we are predestinated under the resurrection unto the rapture the closer we get to the change we're going to feel closer to one another I asked God help us to have to have the right spirit and right attitude so that we can say oh that's my brother it is yes you're my brother you're my sister because we're moving away from the natural senses to the spiritual and spiritually naturally oh my natural brothers are out there my natural sister is out there different parts of the island maybe just different parts of the country but what about your spiritual brothers and sisters are they more close to you than your natural brothers and sisters a member of my family one time when we were visiting the hometown and we we would drive down through and we just dropped in to see certain family members and then we would go on to see our physical our spiritual brothers and sisters in the Lord and in visiting our natural family at one point there a member of the natural family absolutely rebuked me oh all you're interested in is so and so and they were my brothers and sisters in Christ and they said you won't do this you won't do that you just drop in to see us I said I drop you in to say hello and egregious God bless you and one other member of the family stood up to defend us and rebuke the other member and they said listen he's right that he's here to he's there to encourage us he's there he's there to bless us amen so that if other members said no don't don't take that attitude toward him that's not right and so on why because we are closer to our spiritual brothers and sisters than our natural that's the absolute truth brother the prophet of God himself highlighted to his own natural family is is physical Brothers when his when their mother died he said oh he said we're not going to see one another very much now he said we won't get together he said to see one another because they're because they used to get together but only to come visit their mother and when their mother died they said oh we won't get together now but brother Brown did highlight the fact that we get together with our spiritual brothers and sisters what's more important to you your natural family or your spiritual God challenge your faith God help us oh yes I am caught up and I've been cut up for years and years and years we've we have spiritual family oh these are my brothers these are my sisters yeah not the natural spiritual because when it comes to the Natural this too shall pass away but the spiritual is eternal Guardians I pray God challenge your faith are you putting your emphasis on your natural family or on your spiritual Amen brother if we come from eternity and we meet one another here in time why if you spend it that if we we spent eternity together if you spend eternity together oh my praise the Lord this is wonderful we're back at the fellowship again wonderful Hallelujah God help us to recognize ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God and that our yes our and let's consider our our spiritual birth not our natural look at the natural is passing away this too should pass away God help us we are under the third pole of the ministry of the prophet it is finished it is finished remember Genesis the Book of Genesis brings us from eternity into time The Book of Revelation and what God's doing in the last days is taking us back from time back to Eternity amen by the grace of God Grace that God will help us to be more and more and more conscious of Eternity more and more conscious of the spiritual Sons and Daughters of God and less of the natural Grace he said now it's my time for consecration to God 's time he said to speak to me he said I must just have a little change in my own life we need a change in our lives to give God preeminent he said I want to feel a little more closer to the people let's feel more closer to one another spiritual not your natural family your spiritual God help us and yet I know there's Believers that are still caught up with their natural family oh yeah oh I love my natural fat yeah but it's a natural love but with the spiritual family it's an eternal love amen is different absolutely different it is going to take preeminence over the natural what are you living for the natural or the spiritual are you living for time or eternity well where'd you come from where you come from that's where you're going amen we want to get back home praise the Lord oh I know as I've said before I violated air behind the pulpit that when you maybe you Journey somewhere to a different country or a different town after a while you want oh I want to get home I want to go home and you want to get back to your old town or your old country or whatever and you feel you feel better there whatever well we're getting more and more spiritual conscious of our spiritual being we come from eternity and we want to get back to Eternity oh yeah we're hungry and thirsty I tell you the greater and greater revelation of the word the message of the hour is going to create in us a greater hunger and thirst for eternity amen oh yes brother that's that's why there was a Pentecostal Revival a Methodist Revival a Lutheran Revival amen because the Holy Spirit came and it created in their heart a hunger and a thirst amen for what God was doing in their lives and now he's created a hunger and a thirst in us but we thank God for justification we thank for God for sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit but now he's creating in us a hunger and thirst for a glorified body a new Heaven and a new Earth amen previous generations oh Luther hunger than thirst for justification the Pentecostal is hunger and thirst for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen and other other revivals oh they were hungry and thirsty for this experience with God Amen but now we've been Justified we've been Sanctified we've been baptized with the Holy Ghost we have access to the gifts of the Spirit and God has blessed us with this with this with this now what's left is to go is to go home is to get back to Eternal let's let's go to heaven let's get out of here and let's get into the glory of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord that's why the prophet of God when he stepped into the pulpit now he said I got to get myself out of the way he said I can't do this I can't do that so he got himself out of the way and the anointing and God took over brother we got to get ourselves naturally out of the way and let the spiritual revelation of who you are take over amen oh yes for God to do what he wanted to do through William Branham he had William random had to step aside and let God control brother if we want to experience the resurrection rapture we got to get go beyond the Natural Body and let the spirit the Holy Spirit control so we're not living according to our natural senses we're living according to our spiritual revelation he said now to me like it's an insult I don't care to me but to the things that I've been saying it's the truth he says trying to help them to me it feels like if they walk away there's more nothing more than I can do and he said but I want to run the bank down the bank now and persuade them come on back see I've got to have the feeling because I know that there is somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and he said until the last fish is caught amen and brother Brown was looking for that last fish amen and he said many of you remember the vision of the of the last poll the third poll and he said rather you remember there was something happen just before that and I seen that light come and go down into that place and say it I'll meet you there now he said I'm looking for something to happen amen well this was July 63 and brother Brown was getting more and more into the third pole yeah more and more under control of the third pull by the grace of God I've ministered on that a number of times concerning the first poll the second now I said we're under the Third amen or the prophet was under the third May brings us under the Third Amen to go from time to Eternity amen God help us that we're going to focus not on because the power of God had these signs these signs and says get the people to believe amen but then came the third pull the opening of the word to give us Resurrection rapturing Faith amen the revelation of the coming of the Lord Hallelujah so brother do you feel like you're under the first pull the second pool but are you under the third pool are you believing do you have the faith of the third poll there's too many still focusing on the first or the second pole but brother leave that with the Lord you focus on the third pole it'll provide all you need by the grace of God listen again he said Remember the vision of the last pull the third pull he said you remember there was something happened just before that and I seen that light come go down into that place and and said I'll meet you there amen he said I'm looking for something to happen amen and brother Benham had already gotten into the third pole and as time went on he got more and more and more into the greater revelation of the third poll God had to let him know it was the only of the word to give us the faith for the Resurrection the faith for the Rapture amen by the grace of almighty God it is finished Grace he said listen he said there's the organization of the Methodist Church which is a fine bunch of people he said don't you never think they are not and listen he said there's a fine bunch of people I mean he's going to believe this there's a fine bunch of people he said in that Catholic Church got to keep your attitude right better keep your spirit right amen he said they are a fine bunch of people in the Presbyterian Church and he said all of these places it's men and women that are waiting to see that light flash over their path he said amen just keep flashing the light in humility amen be humble he's in sweetness he said let's all grow closer to God by humbling ourselves if God's requiring anything of us it's humility humble yourself don't boast don't be proud humble yourself amen he said let's go closer to God by humbling ourself amen don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength and remember this is the target where Satan has got every gun in Hell trained on and he got every gun in Hell trained on disassembly oh yes amen he was on he was under even Brenham Tabernacle and this is where he was ministering this this message in 1963 July yeah so Brothers not just at church now it's this one and there's a number of other churches around the world amen that every gun in hell is trained on those that are State taking their stand for the truth taking their stand for the faith of the Rapture the resurrection what God is doing amen if the enemy wants to do anything is to just is to just discard us from what God's doing amen god Elvis there's still too many around the mess he's caught up with what God has done in William Brown's Ministry but I'm and they're caught up with what they think is going God is going to do but they're missing what God is doing they're not God up do not caught up with the resurrection they're not being caught up with the revelation of the rapture and brother when when at the climax of The Rapture they won't be raptured they're going to be left behind amen remember there's going to be a generation after the resurrection after the Rapture there's going to be a generation they're going to see this and see that and they're going to say oh I thought there's to be a rapture where's the Rapture it already happened and they didn't know it I trust by grace that we are entering into the revelation of the Rapture now and through the ministry of the word God is trying to get us get our attention more and more and more on the resurrection and on the right look out look up God help us brother don't let don't leave the resurrection up there and just say oh the resurrection is going to happen the Rapture is going to happen this is going to take place that's going to take place no brother we got to get into it now and believe that God is now revealing it to us God is getting us into the resurrection God is getting us into the Rapture and he's trying to increase increase our faith that's right when our faith climb access the resurrection will climax the Rapture of climax and we're going to be caught out of time and into eternity yes God knows when he'll climax and God will keep working on you and you'll keep working on me with the word to keep what to delay in the word delay in the Revelation to keep us meditating on the resurrection to keep us meditating on the Rapture Amen brother if there's anything if God is going to do anything I'll tell you this the anointing and moving of the spirit is going to keep us conscious of what God is doing and what God will do don't ignore it and say Well when the Rapture goes on I'll go when this happens all my brother God is revealing to us and we'll reveal to us when that when it's going to happen don't ignore it amen as I said again he said don't forget this chat this Tabernacle will lose its strength and he said that this is the target where Satan has got every gun in Hell trained on it and he'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what the other one thinks and he said he is doing that he is up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another and say well listen did you know so and so don't you listen to it he said don't you listen to it at all he said that's the devil he said don't you believe it he said if there's anything that somebody has done wrong pray for them amen and don't pray in a selfish way and say I know it's my duty I've got to pray for that brother you take it to your heart and really down and pray for that sister and you talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you find them right back in the service again he said because all after all we are headed towards the setting of the Sun amen the Lord Jesus will be coming one of these days and you know I think it'll be so sudden so sweet until there be one hundredth of one percent of the whole world will never know when that Rapture takes place he said it'll just go go so quietly that nobody would know nothing about it God help us to be more and more spiritual more and more conscious of what God is doing not just what he did on thinking what he will do but what is God doing Lord I believe that you're you're in us now and you're you're making the the revelation of the Resurrection Rapture more and more real to us Lord help us please Jesus help me to look up I believe Lord we're on our way we're coming we're coming home amen he said listen if there's anybody anything that somebody has done wrong pray for them and don't pray in a selfish way amen but pray for them he said just keep praying keep digging amen he said remember he said listen the Rapture will take place the church will be taken home and then the tribulation will set in and oh my we don't want to be here during that time I don't want to be here in the tribulation and he said listen the lamb that had come forth with his book of redemption and the bride has been taken out and those who turned it down as they go through a tribulation period both Jew and Gentile what a time of tribulation amen but he said I don't want to be there in the tribulation and the bride don't want to be there amen so we're going to focus on the on the revelation of the Resurrection The revelation of the Rapture look up amen let's go amen we believe that we're living in that hour the hour is late amen don't ignore what's going on I pray in the name of Jesus considering what's going on I pray that you let the Holy Spirit keep you conscious of the resurrection and the rapture amen oh all this is going on that's going on yeah oh well the world's getting worse getting worse yeah but let God reveal to you boy he's allowing this and allowing that amen that God revealed to you even though the world is getting worse the Revelation is getting better amen and we are getting closer to Eternity by the grace of God he says Zoe he said listen he said I don't want no trouble hold your ticket in your hand because we're going over and he said the great time of redemption is at end he said just keep praying keep digging he said don't stop he said just like when Elijah told them he said dig ditches out there and he said when you get down and hear an old tin can and say I am too tired he said throw it out of the way and keep digging amen he's because he said we got to dig amen and he said if you expect the mid to expect to miss the tribulation he said you better start digging amen now he said for myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm going to start digging deeper than I have ever done amen because why he wanted to get out of the out of this whole world and into into eternity he didn't want to stay here for the tribulation do you want to stay for the tribulation so if not you're going to be focusing on the resurrection and the Rapture oh yeah the faith that you have will focus on Resurrection the faith that you got will be focusing on the rapture oh yeah amen brother over we got a faith to know what's going on in the world but don't focus on it don't don't just concentrate on it no no if you see this oh yes yes Lord that's the truth Lord that's that's what you promised as we just said in your word you prophesied it Lord yeah don't stop there oh Lord oh yeah yeah right Lord that's just say the Lord it is written that this is going to happen that's going to happen yeah but don't forget the Rapture is going to happen too and the resurrection is going to happen oh praise the Lord I'm going to focus on the resurrection Rapture don't Focus too much on what's going on up there brother I pray Grace that we're going to focus on what's going on up there and what's going on over there is just a sign of what he's doing amen what's going on over there is a sign that oh praise the lord lord if that's going out of there the resurrection is right here directions right here we're coming home Lord God help us to believe it he said you show me a church that's humble you show me a church he said that's real humble not arrogancy he said a church just a sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of God in it amen you're going to go to a messy Church you want to know if God is in that church see if you can experience the humility and the humbleness of that church does it have a humble spirit amen I'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of God he said that's right and the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us he said don't have to make a lot of noise just believe amen just believe Grace he said above all things it's our individual Souls that we are responsible before God and he says you going to heaven amen and he says you have got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts the man that humbles himself God raises up amen when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he is arrogant and he said that's the person that never gets anywhere but he said you take that person that humbles himself and walks sweetly amen he's the one that's going with the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah bear with me he said now surely he said though I understand all the mysteries of God and still though I could do it and have not charity I am nothing and we know that charity is divine love do you have Divine love for your brothers and sisters in Christ so the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it if you got the love of God you'll humble yourself now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little a bit about the gate to enter in and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you he said don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person keep your spirit right and your attitude right stay humble and stay sincere amen he said you'll be sweet and kind and he said remember God loves you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he is wrong just pray for them and love one another and above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another be humble he says usually when a church begins to get in numbers and he said get to it getting a little bigger or something like that he said then they'll get away from that real thing the real thing what is it is intellectual they got the knowledge of the word the knowledge of the message but not the spirit they got religion but not the Holy Ghost there's too many religious people but not spiritual God help us possess the devil oh yeah God gives the word and by the word the pure word you become spiritual amen Holy Spirit spiritual but the enemy gets in amen oh my brother sister the enemy is there but he's there he's there to make you religious but not spiritual amen again let's see where the quote was saved I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts you take that person that humbles himself and walks sweetly amen I pray God that we have that anointing to walk sweetly we read this quote again soon bring it to a conclusion he said above everything love God love one another and be humble with God and around one another be humble usually when a church begins to get in numbers and to get get to getting a little bigger or something like that and they get a they get away from the real thing amen now he said remember he said that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon he said Godly brotherly love for one another he said I can't even shake hands with one another he said and cried like babies to leave one another he said but they loved one another well amen now I said we're keeping time that the people will go will come by if you want to see a church that's really really humble a church that really loves God dropping up here up there at that Tabernacle and he said watch it look at the care they have for one another and the respect and when the gospel is being preached irreverent and how everything is just in order amen yes then they can look and see what time we are living you'll see the spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders and things will be taking place and if the thing is working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then it the time it stopped so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time that we are living he said do you believe that amen he said the Lord richly bless you if there's anything that God not necessarily requiring but anything that God's expecting in his seed is humility brother they humble themselves to the revelation of God they humble themselves to the revelation of what God has done yes and what God is doing and you humble yourself to the revelation of what God will do so brother through the ministry of the hour Malachi 4 and the message of the Prophet God has given us the revelation of what amen of what God has done what God is doing and what God will do amen God's not leaving it to you to figure it out he's leaving it to you to hear it and to believe it amen the messenger is as as spoke the word and the word has been revealed by the Holy Ghost in this day in this age in this hour what God has done what God is doing and what God will do amen is there is there a church somewhere else is there another church is there is there a denomination out there somewhere that's preaching what God has done what God is doing and what God will do most they are focusing on what God has done through history and they and they're putting the people to oh well God's going to do this God's going to do that but they're ignoring what God is doing amen that's why they're going to miss the resurrection and they're going to miss the rapture God help us to Humble ourselves to what God is doing amen Brothers again please it's not focusing on what he did thank God for what he did thank God for the revelation of what he did but brother what is God doing am I at am I identifying with what he is doing brother why cry let's speak the word amen because he has revealed the word speak the word he has revealed to us what he what he is do what he has done what he is doing and what he will do believe it amen well I'll tell you for those that are gathered in other churches there tonight they're not into the revelation of what God is doing because most churches out there tonight the thousands and thousands and thousands of churches around the world they're focusing on what God did amen maybe a hundred years ago two of three four five hundred years ago two thousand years ago God did this God did this God did that but what is God doing brother he sent the messenger of the hour to reveal to the bride what God is doing but I tell you for you to for you to believe it for you to catch it if there's anything you got to do and anything the bride got to do is to Humble herself you got to humble yourself to what God is doing you got to humble yourself to believe what God is revealing amen but most they're considering what God did a hundred years ago they're considering what God did in Luther God did him Wesley what God did in the in William Booth what God did maybe in the early Pentecostal Revival 100 year over a hundred years ago well yeah what God did in this group that group this revival that Revival yeah but what is God doing amen because God did that lasers in Luther we move on and plus you

to what he's doing now in the bride of Christ I'll tell you this because I tell you the lutherans are not not rejoicing in the Revival that Lutheran not by any means it's gone and same with Wesley the same with William Booth the old-fashioned Salvation Army and so on oh no that that spirit that Revival is not there no more and God moved on moved on and they came that Pentecostal Revival the restoration of the gifts the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen what would follow that well if the restoration of the gifts and the Baptist of the Holy Ghost the revelation of the word would follow that amen he gave us justification sanctification now the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the gifts of the Spirit amen which will bring us to the revelation of the word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith it is the end Amen brother God had a reason to preach to reveal justification God had a reason to reveal sanctification God had a reason to reveal the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit is to get and to get to get a generation to get it to get his sons and daughters more and more and more spiritual amen to believe God praise the Lord so we believe justification We Believe sanctification we believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen now we're bleeding for the resurrection and the rapture praise the Lord to God be the glory amen let's humble ourselves to the revelation of the word for the glory of God let's open ourselves to the truth amen if you humble yourself he's going to come down and lift you up with the revelation of the rapture the revelation of the Resurrection the revelation of a new Heaven and a new Earth brother we need we need to get into the revelation amen we need to let go and let God have his way we need to claim the promise of a new Heaven and a new Earth brother if there's anything that the world even the world recognizes it is the it is the crazy world that we're living in oh yeah there are so many
