first let's sing the chorus again and sister orion will come and i minister in song this morning sing a special song remember to pray for her she comes to sing and let's continue to praise the lord no matter what tomorrow brings i remember the reading about brother watson he who was the apostle to the chinese many years ago at the turn of the century like you know 1900s and he talked about being depressed and he was in prison and he was he was having a really rough time but one thing he said in his book against against the tide he said there was one day he was so depressed that he got out into the open and he just started praising god and he said he didn't feel like it at first but after a while that anointing struck and he kept praising it didn't matter what kind of situation he was in god looked after him and god was assuring him that he was with him and he just continued to praise the lord so it doesn't matter what tomorrow brings continue to praise the lord because it'll bring victory that's what i believe so let's sing it this morning this is tomorrow i will praise the lord i will praise the lord hallelujah no matter what tomorrow brings what it has amen amen like i was saying to brother bob i didn't plan on singing this this morning but i said at the piano and i started to play this and the more i played it the more i felt i should sing it so here i am again there

of jesus grace for those that are here and grace for those that are at home tonight are today lord amen but still ongoing and thirsting for the word of god still calling on the lord still depending on you lord because again without you we can do nothing and lord for us this is important hallelujah it is the assuming of the saints amen hallelujah for the word of god it is the assembling of the

things are possible now i be yes now now i believe now i believe all things are possible now i believe amen thank you lord god bless you amen turn with me to first john chapter 2 amen first john chapter 2 amen god be the glory this reminder here that uh this is something that brother david got produced and this and what is it it's this and it's down to this amen it is the hymn book that he took somewhere and he got somebody to redo it and this is what they did amen i think we would maybe need it to be done a little bit larger when it comes to the the lettering here but again if you've got good eyes you'll see it amen so we thank the lord for maybe he laid it on our brother brother david to to go somewhere and get just to check on and see if they could do it and so it it is everything even the index of all the hymns amen so god's grace and we'll see as the lord leads us and also to express thanks for sister maureen special amen praise the lord be thankful for his presence be thankful for all he's done amen to god be the glory and also i want to express thanks again to our brother jonathan corlett for the ministry of the word and uh blessed with the ministry of the word when he ministered to us concerning faith and so on well you know it's amazing we think faith is a feeling but faith got nothing to do with feelings or i sense this and sense this yeah faith god well faith comes by hearing airing by the word amen so it's as simple as receiving the word it is god in simplicity i believe amen and it's not again it's not emotion it's not none of that no it's just it's just rest he said faith is rest faith is peace i'm persuaded i know it i believe it thank you lord and you don't have to work it up just go on amen and god will honor your faith amen and god will bless you amen in response to your faith but it's so it's simple it's simple again oh i feel this i feel no it's your anything you feel is peace amen anything you feel is peace god in all circumstances all situations gives you peace and god is giving us in these circumstances right now what's going on around the world god has given us peace to god be the glory amen so that the world is getting caught up with it the world is getting upset with it and so on they're warning about this wondering of that but the bride is looking out oh lord we're getting closer we're on we're on our way home lord amen praise the name of the lord and as i've heard of the ministry a minute sometimes to point us to he said when we started out he said it's still there and he said that's the gate it's the gate is down there to enter in amen that's right so you keep your eye on the gate and because the angels are there any but the enemy is there to get us to go off here go off there go off here he's not not denying the word but adding to the word or he's taken away from the word but like i said it's like like the tree you know god plants it but what god's looking for is the is what the what the tree produces not what's not what's grafted in and i tell you the devil has grafted a lot in to the tree amen answers anything the devil has turned us off on amen god will bring us right back and go on straight again until it's an original branch original branch so you come to the fruit amen it's going to produce this this and this but it's all because look now god looking for the fruit but again it's like the brothers said and brother brown brought it out but the man that went somewhere to visit somebody and oh and he saw he saw a tree there and he saw this fruit dead fruit dead fruit what's that what kind of a tree is that and he looked up to where it brought out natural branches and he said that's that one right there this is what it's producing well how come it's growing this is growing this and growing that oh that was that was grafted in amen so it could be it can be identified with the original tree but it's not a man a right and it's experiencing the life of the tree but just go to show that what's on the inside is coming out in reality and it's not the fruit of that original tree amen but i tell you this god is endeavoring to us to get us to bring forth the fruit of the original tree that he planted amen not religion not this church or that church this denomination that denomination no it's the word of god and brother again it struck me as our brother jonathan was preaching he bringing up scriptures oh faith faith faith oh i said lord that's amazing i said yeah it's simple oh it's simple what is it always believe in what god reveals right it's believing what's in the word oh i accept the lord amen praise the lord and you go on you don't doubt it you're not going to listen to the devil to add to it or take from it you take it away god gives it and that's faith that's the faith that pleases god it is god in simplicity thank god for the prophet to come and and and reveal those things to us because people think oh well god is this god is that and and and god is this they're making it this yeah and sometimes if god is this they're making us even smaller you know but let's take the way the bible reveals it god hidden and god revealed in simplicity praise brother that's why he sent the prophet so we would recognize god not religion oh not this this idea that idea god so he said what is it he says keep going towards the door keep going towards that gate you can see it amen we're going to glory by the grace of god amen don't take your eye off the gate and if you lose it sometimes and you're praying you're sincere god will bring you back in amen to the original tree amen so the lord bless us amen and again god bless our brother jonathan amen god help us brother when it comes to faith it is the word of god hearing the word of god amen hearing it yeah oh i i heard it yeah yeah but you accept it yeah you said yeah amen lord that's your word thank you lord amen and is giving me more faith brothers god and simplicity amen you god reveals it you just go and do it amen but too many are adding this to it adding that to it emotion and so on so we pray the grace of god help us believe the word the power is in the word amen whatever god's going to do is in his word and you believe the word god well god's going to do it if you don't believe it god push you out and keep on going with those that believe amen it is it is such a simple thing and we pray the grace of god yes and i i don't know if i've done it yet but to bring greetings of course uh to the saints here he asked me to do it and that was brother george smith because a few days ago he called me and uh i don't know if he's in tennessee right now or in another country that he was planning at that time to go but he had to get a blood test to make sure it was negative yeah and uh and that he would be permitted to fly on on the airplanes but they needed that test result first so we pray grace to be with brother george amen he's pressing on in in in spite of all that's going on in the world all that's going on in the united states he's pressing on to do the will of god and he's been going around tennessee and so on so we pray grace to him as he feels led of the lord to go minister to some saints and not chores as central or south america or where it is right now but we pray god bless our brother and his ministry amen and he asked me to pass on greetings to the saints here i said brother we'll be praying for you amen and uh also our brother earl ellsworth just asked you to keep him in prayer because he will be arriving here again tomorrow and he will be staying with us and uh the lord willing i'll be taking him to see a doctor or two a couple of doctors at the health science center on tuesday morning i think his appointment is nine o'clock tuesday morning and that's why they have to come to back to the city on monday so the grace of god be with brother earl amen and as they travel and the grace of god be with them as they go to visit the doctor to god be the glory amen well i'm so glad you know we were discussing with somebody and i know we brought out what the prophet said that he said god heals through doctors and god heals through medicine amen he does and he did sell that doctor he said brother he said i believe there's a there's a place in heaven for you for what so those doctors who are who are doing it in the name of the lord oh yeah they're going by the wisdom of god and of course we we we've already been identified with it are dr mcondo and dr keller uh columbo they all love kays in africa amen so we pray god bless them amen praise the lord i don't know if our brother visually has gone into case no okay it's from india to god be the glory amen and again i've been in contact with another brother in india and he's been requesting prayer and will remember him as the name that he identifies with me is not exactly the indian name but it's samuel a brother samuel in india and he's been having some problems in the last few days a man so we pray the grace of god to give him wisdom in dealing with those issues and i have connected him with the voice of god representative in india and i've been in contact with that brother for a number of years and so we pray the grace of god to him because not all that long ago uh our brother's wife was taken to glory amen she's passed on by the grace of god so we we're we we've remembered that brother in prayer amen and he appreciated it so the god god's grace be with them as he he will help that brother that i was in contact with help him to give him the wisdom that he's looking for he wants to know what should i do in these circumstances what should i do how should i do it when should i do it because of the issues that he's dealing with so god bless brother samuel amen and the other needs as well so god be with us all amen in first john chapter 2 and again the lord willing i would like to be able to finish the thoughts concerning the message that the prophet preached in july 1965 and it is in entitled ashamed amen it's amazing that the prophet god would find in the scripture a rev a message on ashamed and again as i said it's it's amazing the number of times that the bible references being ashamed amen ashamed of god maybe being ashamed of the word may be ashamed of your testimony and so on so he brother the prophet felt amen because i believe that's what's going to change a lot of attitudes toward the message is that people are going to be ashamed of the message amen so and they're going to avoid this and avoid that to finally they just avoid the message really so the grace of god be with us amen that will not be ashamed amen but we're going to stay with the word regardless it is for the glory of god and for the salvation of our souls again first john chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 21. it says i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth amen who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ is antichrist that denieth the father and the son and whosoever deny it the son the same as not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son at the father also praised the name of the lord hallelujah what a relationship that we have with god verse 24 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard amen from the beginning and if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father praise the lord hallelujah and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life and these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you god help us but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you grace grace grace that we got the anointing in us the holy ghost in us amen and it says the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you ye shall abide in him amen and now little children you need no one to teach you the basics but god has got the ministry there to teach you to mature amen as the sons and daughters of god amen to highlight the things that maybe you're not seeing as you should see amen not acting as you should act or reacting amen so the prophet of god highlighted this when somebody endeavors to persuade the prophet that i don't need any teachers i don't need any pastor i don't need any ministry and so on he said the bible says this but the prophet says he said you've you've skipped one thing that what god is doing here he's doing it through the ministry amen so there is a ministry that god has got to bring you to this place amen by the grace of god and again when it comes to the the fightful ministry and there are those that come to the seals and they feel that they don't need any other ministry because the seals were revealed the prophet was here and all we have to do is listen to the prophet well as i've said and highlighted it some time ago they need to go back to the revelation of the seven seals and especially to the questions and answers on the seals because one of the questions that are asked the prophet is does the bride have a ministry amen and he said she sure does and he says been in her since the day of pentecost and right from the beginning and he said it is the five-full ministry and he highlighted it amen but yet there are so-called believers that feel the bride doesn't need the fightful ministry and that's why you find that there are certain ones that are are just listening to tapes where the proud of god said if they played that tape probably god said he see you young ministers is your ordained to take the bride on to resurrection and rapturing faith and so on unto the coming of the lord amen that we're looking for so brother you can't you can't deny it if you deny that then you're going to deny the rest of the seals so god help us that we're going to accept the mystery of god believe the mystery of god stay in line with the mystery of god amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah and again ver which was it verse 25 28 oh we'll start with 27 again but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you amen no when it comes to the basics because your god has brought you in by the again was through the ministry bring it to repentance amen and you lay down your life amen but by the holy ghost you pick it up again praise the lord amen you're a new creature now in christ amen but does the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie even as it has taught you ye shall abide in him amen and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed amen before him at his coming god bless his word you may be seated amen and turn with me again to first peter chapter 4 amen and the grace of god that you would keep sister betty in prayer she was really not feeling well yesterday or last night and most of the day she had it hard through that through that saturday night or friday night i should say amen so pray the grace of god that the lord will according to his will bring her into contact with the doctor that that's ordained to look after her amen and it's been quite a while so we pray grace that the the lord will improve it amen more quicker by the grace of god and sold it and also in first peter chapter 4 and reading verses 12 to 19. and the lord willing what i would do is to read the scriptures and again my not it's not a problem but down my ministry when it comes to dealing with these issues that i read the scripture and stay with the scripture read the scripture and stay with the scripture then we'll read another one and another one and another one and so by the time we're finished with the with the scriptures that we didn't have time to get into the message and give you the quotes concerning the message that i'm preaching on now and it's ashamed and brother brown was challenging the faith of the people he's challenging our faith he's challenging your faith he's challenging my faith are we ashamed of this or ashamed of that and i have noted down through the ages and down through the years rather that i've noticed that there's been many and brother and sister that have been ashamed of this part of the word shamed of that part of the word they're they're there to believe oh i believe god sent a prophet oh i believe god opened the seals and i believe god did this but brother what he the reason he did it was to give us the faith for the resurrection he gave us the faith for the rapture and he and again that's only for the bride that's that's not for all of there the prophet god's again said now he said we're not going to get this message to everybody no but if you're gonna get it to the bride amen because when it comes to the message the purpose of it and the reason why god has ordained it and predestinated it amen well that's not what god's looking for in those out there but it's what he's looking for in the bride amen so brother and again because he said the problem god highlighted it and i said we won't get to everyone with the message but he said that when it comes to the revelation of jesus and he said as our lord and savior he said that message is going to go to all the world amen northeast south and west is going to go everybody's going to get that witness but not the message because that message is only ordained for the bride and to give the bride resurrection and rapturing faith to give the bride the faith that she needs to get out of time and into eternity whereas the others again as the bible said many are called but few are chosen and as i've said the calls are not lost amen but again the caller not ordained and predestinated for the rapture not by any means so brother they're there by by the grace of god and they will be there and that's that again when it comes to this hour in this age that is the many that are going to lay down their lives in the great tribulation but the bride is going to go up and be united with their bridegroom amen as the problem of god said he said we're not going to a marriage we're going to a marriage supper amen because he's being united now with the bride and the bride's being united with him amen they praise the lord and when it's completed when it is absolutely finished according to the last one amen then brother the rapture is going to take place amen the resurrection of the bride that's gone on and the and the and the ch and the rapture of the bride that's still living by the grace of god so brother i pray grace god help us in the name of jesus to recognize it to acknowledge the hour that we're living amen to acknowledge what we believe god has done and to acknowledge what god is doing amen and there there's many out there they feel that god has done this and god is doing this and but that's why they're still out there but i'll tell you this that if they're not bright they're still going to be faithful to what god has revealed to them amen and they believe that they are the sons and daughters of god amen and they're going to live outside the city but the bride is going to live with him in the city praise the lord and the bride is going to sit with him in earth for any strong amen now all the others are not going to sit with him but each the bride and the bridegroom they're going to rule and reign over the earth and they're going to rule and reign over those that are outside the city so again as i said to keep your attitude right keep your spirit right to those that that are not message believers amen just encourage them to believe god just encourage them to just to keep by having faith in god and god will bless you god will do this for you god is still your healer god is still your savior amen and god is still your lord amen but again they're not bright so brother i thank god for that revelation amen we need it and brother i tell you this god ordained it thus so as to keep our spirit right and keep our attitude right amen toward everyone oh my and i know that they're believers when they come to this message oh yeah not all but most believers that i've experienced through the years they came to this message and they were looking down their noses at anybody oh they go to this church they go to that church they go to that church you know we were there too one time and brother that's that's the the level of the revelation that god is dealing with them amen but still he's looking for them to surrender to him amen and not to not to his revelation as a bride bridegroom no no but as as their lord and savior amen but we're here because we are believed that we are the bride of christ amen and he is our bridegroom amen and what god has done and what god is doing is for the bride what god has done what god is doing is to give us the faith that he's looking for in the bright praise the lord amen so god elvis said we're going to believe amen and the more we believe we're going to get into the word and the more we get into the word the greater and greater we're going to have the revelation that we are the bride of christ amen and that god is looking for the attributes of a bride amen not just christians that god is satisfied with out there there's one as a christian that's a christian when it comes to being christ-like amen in their nature christ like to the level that they they have the revelation amen so brother i'm not looking for them to have the revelation that we have and we're up here somewhere but i believe that they have a revelation of god as their lord and savior our lord jesus christ amen and they might be on this level or whatever but the strong is there to support the weak amen and the bible does teach that there are those there are those uh right down here amen then that according to them when it comes to the calling of god in their hearts and in their souls amen somehow they have this understanding this revelation of god and what he's done and what he's doing and others got this revelation but the bride has got the entire revelation the fullness of the goddess bodily in the bride amen the fullness of god amen the word in flesh in her flesh and the power of god delight led us when he said he said the fullness of the god at bodily is now in the bright it was in the break room but now he said it's in the right amen and brother i truly list for the fullness of the god of bodily in the break room amen he laid down his life and he picked it up again and he had power over the world the flesh the devil amen and it's the same thing with the bride amen in these last days because of what god has done and what god is doing amen that he praise the lord he's giving us the victory over the world and he's given us the victory over the flesh amen and victory over the devil amen praise the name of the lord oh well they the those out there oh lord look they're doing this they're doing that they're doing this yeah but they don't have no other revelation amen they'll live on base on based on the level of the revelation that god has given them amen and brother it's it's going to be very difficult and maybe i believe that the that the greatest number when it comes to even even this listen there's been millions and millions and millions that god have raised and and brought into his his presence down through the years amen but you know what in in among among them all there's been a bride amen and brother when it comes to the resurrection it doesn't mean that all those in luther's age wesley's age and other ages all all the those that didn't believe luther's message or they're lost they're gone they're going to hell brother come on let's have the revelation of god amen let's have the revelation the love of god amen god doesn't delight in in in these things the god doesn't delay in those souls that are going to hell even though they choose that amen it's not god's choice it's their choice amen god gave them a choice and and he knew what they were going to do amen with their spirit and their attitude amen but again brother let's keep our spirit right toward them our attitude right toward them amen because brother as he jesus loved us we want to love them as he reveals himself to us amen so we want to go out and reveal the same revelation to them amen lord well lord whatever it is if he's not if he's their bride they're going to come and follow us if you're not bride lord i pray your grace to keep them amen strengthen them sustain them amen lord just to keep pressing on and lord based on the revelation they got that they'll take a strong firm stand for you amen so brother that's what god's looking for in you and me on to the separation from from the world the flesh the devil amen so the grace of god be with us is my prayer amen that will not be ashamed of what god has done amen will not be ashamed of what god is doing amen that we've got to take our stand for this and to a lot of people they would be ashamed of this ashamed of that and so on no no no not the bride and to me a believer is not going to be ashamed of what god has revealed to them and they'll take their stand for what god's revealed whether it's on this level that level or another level amen and the bible does tell us and the providence isolated it that we are to be there to encourage the others amen not to condemn them to encourage them amen that's right thank god he didn't condemn us amen thank god that in the preaching of the word he brought us to redemption full redemption amen and not just as being the sons and daughters of god oh he's called us to a greater revelation that we are the bride of the lord jesus christ amen so we thank god hallelujah and pray by grace that we're not ashamed of being separated as the bride amen and others feel they don't want to do it don't want to do this don't want to do that amen but brother by the grace of god we want it because we know the end result is pride and bright group amen the end result is the marriage supper of the lamb and so glad the prophet as i highlighted it and as i said that sister copy did come to me and said brother that's the greatest wonderful most wonderful revelation or ministries that i've enjoyed he says good because i spent so many sermons on that on that those thoughts of being what of the bridegroom meeting the bride of the bridegroom and the bride being engaged amen and then being united and then going to the marriage supper of the lamb amen because as i said in 1962 oh he said we're engaged to the bridegroom and this and this and this he mentioned that in a certain message and then in 1964 he said we're not going to a marriage we're going to a marriage supper amen because we are united with emir amen after they owe me the seven seals is the revelation of god coming down to be united with his bride amen and we're united with him as the bridegroom amen but the world in general the religious world in general is not recognizing the coming of the bride oh it's the coming of jesus it's the coming of our lord the coming of our savior but they're not identifying him as a bridegroom amen because he's not their bridegroom and they are not his bride but they're going to be outside the city but the bride is in the city with the bridegroom thank god amen so don't lose that revelation amen keep your heart your mind your soul focused on that revelation of who you are amen and i believe that if you're bright you're not going to be ashamed of the bridegroom you're not going to be ashamed of the revelation of the bright group you're not going to be ashamed of what he's asking for in you and in me and what he's looking for in you and in me amen what what why why is the temptation there that maybe we might be ashamed is because of the total separation from unbelief amen that amen the influence of the word the influence of what god has done the influence of what he's doing is bringing us to a greater and a greater and a greater separation amen and for there are those that will be ashamed of it amen oh yeah i've witnessed that down for the years they're ashamed amen of this or i don't want i don't want to go that far with it i don't want to go you're going to go all the way god wants you to go and there are those that said they think oh i'll go this way i'll go this way yeah it's like one time a number of years ago there was a young man in central newfoundland and well i called him young because he might have been in his late 40s or early 50s and uh he was a believer and so one one day that he was out doing certain things in the wilderness there and it was it was near the the transcanada highway and one time this i i believe was even some believers drove by and they looked up on the hill there somewhere and there was this brother and and one point there they looked and he was just sitting down amen and he they waved to him and he waved to them but just shortly after that he died because he had a heart attack and he died amen and of course he was buried in life tabernacle in bishop falls and i had to i had to go in and take control of the of the funeral service and uh the song servers and the prayers and and and all the issues that when it comes to a funeral service and as i said the building was full and i would say maybe there might have been almost 300 people there and like i said we had to have chairs brought in so others could sit and they weren't all believers but and again in a sense they were believers but not message believers and because he had he was a member of the of that bishop falls council oh yeah he was a member for a number of years of that council and all and and the whole council town council was there oh yeah they came in and they were sitting here they were sitting there praise the name of the lord and to the ex to the place where i had to and i know a lot of believers maybe wouldn't when it wouldn't do this but i said uh well i said god bless us but i said i'm going to ask now all any ministering brethren that are here and i said you might be a salvation army officer you might be a pentecostal pastor or whatever i said if you're a ministering brother i want you to come and sit on the platform and i said so that we're going to give more room to those that are coming in the door there amen and you know what oh my there was this preacher there was this preacher this pastor this one this officer of salvation army oh there was a number that came up and we had two of these large seats there on the platform and they were sitting there but i noticed that there was a message believer there a pastor and he didn't come out and i said oh i said oh yeah brother i said i'm going to ask you i said to come up and so somebody else can take your seat no wouldn't come out and i said oh my i said okay god bless you amen so i left that with the lord amen but that's not the right attitude of a believer amen if you want to let somebody come in praise the lord let them be literally receive the witness amen of what we believe concerning funerals amen and concerning our brother that had gone on amen and brother to god be the glory after that funeral service and we were all going out to go to the cemetery a number of people from the council approached me because brother manuel preached the word and then they said oh they said excuse me pastor they said just want to tell you this is one of the most wonderful funerals that i've ever attended they said this is oh this is wonderful thank you thank you for what you said it was wonderful and they said it it it it's what we needed amen it's not what our brother needed he was going on amen but they felt it was what they needed amen to god be the glory praise the name of the lord so brother let's not be we're not ashamed of it amen i wasn't ashamed to do this it wasn't ashamed to do that but emmanuel wasn't ashamed to preach this and preach that amen but i tell you brother i guess more of these so-called unbelievers they believed it than the believers to god be the glory amen praise like i said it'll be a funeral service that that maybe if the others are still alive maybe a funeral service that they still remember and they'll always remember by the grace of god amen so let us go forth with that kind of a spirit and that kind of an attitude and that kind of a life amen and opinions that they'll respect it by the grace of god as i've said that in what i've done and where i work amen they've come to me says oh we know you're a christian amen oh yeah and you weren't ashamed to take your stand but they knew that you had a right spirit and right attitude and that's why we come and respect you amen we thank you we thank you we thank you amen so bro hallelujah so brother you go forth and live that kind of a life because you've got a right spirit and a right attitude amen you're not there to condemn them amen you're there to lift them up amen you're not there to condemn them you're going to be there to say oh lord i pray grace to that that that brother grace to that sister grace to this gentleman that gentlemen lord grace in these situations have mercy lord the prophet and again the prophet of god reminded us that as long as the bride is on the earth there is grace amen because the bride is a testimony of grace and the and the bride's testimony is grace amen because it's the grace of god that has called us it's the grace of god that is dealing with us asa hallelujah and making us one with the word and brother we're reaching out to them and again i'm so glad as i heard a certain ministering brother and i guess he's close to 80 years old now for sure and uh in still in western canada and as he i've heard preach a number of things and i agree with it you know i know most preachers and most believers today won't have nothing to do with it and or or to to to acknowledge it and to thank god for that that spirit or that that time that age but he did say and he said oh you know it's unfortunate that so-called met so many believers he's preaching even pastors preaching the word he said the message and he said he said they think god got you hanging over hell with a thread oh yeah i said they leave believers with an impression you're hanging over hell with a thread and the least mistake that you make gone you're gone he said that's not the gospel amen praise the lord because he oh well they take it out of context there where and i think it might be in john and it says the the the saints are not going to sin they won't sin but he did say he said if we sin if we sin praise the lord we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous amen because he's there because we're born in sin the nature we're living by is sin amen it's a sinful nature amen and he's there to intercede for us hallelujah praise the lord to bring us to that place where we're going beyond out of this old body and into a glorified body amen and there's going to be no sin there and i'll tell you i'm longing for that place amen through the new birth we're putting contact with that place and that place is in contact with us amen but still we got to deal with and fight the fight the good fight of faith amen overcoming the the flesh to give amen to get victory over this victory over that sometimes that's why he said if we sin amen because of that flesh he said we got an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous amen and he's there hallelujah to get forgiveness amen by the grace of god so brother again keep your attitude right keep your spirit right it's by grace through faith you're saved and brother that grace and that faith is there to them and he's as far as god will lead them amen and again it's like that that sister and she was a preacher that was caught questioning us some years ago because she was in the same senior's home that sister dunford was in a that sister shade he was in sister sadie dicks amen and they recognized sister shady's testimony that recognized her faith you know in her attitude and her spirit it was so right amen and she had discernment and uh so on and it's like one time she was visiting with another old lady there in her in her room and of course sister said he was in a private room and then all of a sudden something struck her and the lady said well what's wrong oh she said there's somebody in my room and they're they're taking my money oh yeah she said what oh yes she said the lord just revealed it to me amen she wasn't ashamed not by any man she wasn't ashamed of the gospel she wasn't ashamed of jesus amen she wasn't ashamed of us we're going there to be a witness amen not by any maids so she just got up and she walked out the door walked down the aisle and her room was right down the end there and she went in sure enough her handbag was there and it was open and the money was gone amen oh yeah i said that's what oh yeah she said that's what happened but she said i should have responded earlier amen and then she would have stopped but she gave god the glory amen praise the lord she wasn't ashamed amen knowing that but all the other residents and even the the management they knew she wasn't ashamed no she loved the lord and she didn't mind testifying amen and there's one sister there another sister there that died a few years later and and they come into her one day and they said oh excuse me we want to cut your hair no no no no she said not cutting my hair no more no why oh she said well she said aunt shade he told me she said that's not right according to the scriptures amen the the bible forbids a woman to cut her hair it's their covering amen from the lord a and they said oh you believe that yes she said i believe it she said i believe aunt sadie i believe that amen so she was a tremendous testimony amen amen what was her address wanted she wasn't ashamed amen she wasn't ashamed to take her stand for this for this for this amen to god be the glory amen and as i said oh praise the lord what a testimony amen because she wasn't ashamed to say this do this be this witness and that witness no because when that when that clergy there that was the head of that that home at the time and he was running the home and he called me aside he said oh he said pastor is everyone in this home was like aunt sadie and that's why everybody called her aunt sadie yeah and they said everybody in this room was like her this would be heaven what this would be heaven well what kind of testimony does she give amen but her testimony the life that she was living her attitude and her actions and reactions it was pointing to jesus amen it was plenty of glory pointing to god giving god the preeminence praise the name of the lord that was her attitude that was her spirit amen and what brought her to this message oh yeah it's hard to believe it that somebody would come to this message based on the revelation amen what was it the wedding all concerning marriage oh yeah marriage marriage and divorce and so on the prophet preached one of the last sermons that he preached amen and he said this is another revelation of the seven seals amen and then sadie well when she heard she wanted to know because we used to go from sister dunpher's house and we just walked a little ways from there up to the house that sister sadie was living in with her sister and her brother-in-law and they they were getting old then oh yeah and she was spiritual at pentecostal and she said and she said oh my one minute now i gotta put this in the mail and but before she put anything in the mail she would bow ahead and pray she wasn't ashamed amen brother that was down by them by the mailboxes and she go down there and hold the letter and bow her head and pray she she wasn't ashamed amen no matter who went by no matter who stopped she still prayed and then put the letters into the box amen and so eventually after that we went over and fellowship with her talk with her and and eventually all conversations ended up on the word we talked about the natural things of life but then the spiritual and finally and say she said oh excuse me when we were leaving there one night after fellowship she said excuse me she said i got a question she said what makes you act the way you act and what makes you do the what what you do and the way you live and so on because you noticed our sister dumford and sister betty and their hair was long always dressed in modest clothing and so on and i said well i said it's the scripture i say it's the word the bible says this the bible says that oh it struck her yeah and she was pentecostal amen and then finally she called sister dumper and she said oh my she said what is your belief in she told her about the prophet of god oh she said can i have a sermon by him and sister dumber give her give her a copy of the sermon marriage and divorce i said oh my oh my oh my oh my i said what a sermon to give a witness to anybody well exactly because of the challenge to faith amen a challenge to their faith exactly she could give them something else oh yeah i believe that you know that oh i believe that but imagine divorce that was a strong sermon oh my and yet the prophet said it's another revelation of the seven seals that he was amen well she she took the sermon she listened to the tape called sister dumber oh sister dumford amen she said that's the truth amen she said i believe it amen thank god she said for brother branham thank god for what he what he's what he told us amen she believed it she never questioned it and yet there are others oh my they were thrown away yeah but not sister sadie she wanted more amen and she came she said i believe the word amen and i baptize her in the name of the lord jesus christ amen to god be the glory we're not ashamed amen and the power of god is alien that brother that what god did all down through the ages he said there were those who were ashamed of it and those who weren't ashamed of it but god was looking for those who weren't ashamed amen your attitude was right your spirit the word the word was right amen amen that you weren't you weren't born of a church you were born of jesus you were born of god amen and you are more than willing to lay down your life as he lay down his by the grace of god amen he said yes he said it shows you are not sure of this or sure that if you're embarrassed he says so you would rather not discuss the subject and if you're going to be ashamed of it he said you wouldn't want to discuss it you will hold back but he said if you're a christian you're not ashamed of it amen you want the truth you're going to stay with the truth amen and yet there are certain issues and there are certain teachings that believers are ashamed they would make believers oh i'm ashamed of that i wouldn't i won't i won't let them this tell them this i won't tell them that amen just the same as maybe we wouldn't let them listen to marriage and divorce we certainly wouldn't give them that tape we would think we'll give them this and wait till they come in the message after a while they believe this believe this then we'll give them marriage and divorce but sister don't forgive him the first one because she thought it was such a tremendous truth amen and she knew that one of the greatest problems that the world was dealing with was marriage and divorce and this would answer the questions amen i'm sure that sister said he had praise the lord and of course she was a widow for many years amen but she gave the glory to jesus and you know what when she was just a young woman and she was married she was going to a pentecost church she heard of william branham oh yeah she said the preacher preached and and she said he was preaching this and preaching that and he said listen he says this is like the ministry said of william branham and he said look what god did did through william branham and he was talking about signs and wonders and miracles and so on and he said this was part of his ministry he said god gave him these three signs god gave him this god gave him that amen look what god did through william branham and said he heard it and she just said praise the lord amen and went on it was just william branham amen but it was many years later hallelujah that she got the revelation that he was god's prophet amen it was malachi 4 amen praise the lord it was revelation 10 amen god opening the word the mystery of god praise the lord amen but again you got you got your your revelation of it and you recognize the prophet amen you don't go beyond and highlight him too much no see but you believe what he said and you believe he was a prophet amen and i've talked to a catholic family and in fact two or three catholic families i've talked to and against i said i talked to anglicans and i told them this and only they said we believe it we believe it amen things that the prophet said things that the ministry said and he oh praise the lord that's god amen yeah even catholics amen as one of the catholics said to me she said brother she said you know she said we don't all believe she said what the priest is saying because she said we can read our bible now and see if we can read our own bible she said we know what god says amen and she said i just won't let you know i believe god amen and i believe the word i believe the bible amen praise the name of the lord yeah and again we had a neighbor one time that was the roman catholic and i was out mowing my backyard and and she came out on her deck and and she said oh oh she said oh one minute she said i got a question to ask you yeah and she was a catholic and she said i want to know this this this okay i said i said well i agree with you uh when it comes to that that was going to hell god's sending someone to hell who made the choice she won the who made the choice i said they made the choice not god amen god i said response is based on their choice amen oh she said thank you thank you thank you that's the truth amen i believe it god bless you amen so brother we're i'm not going to say that person god didn't cut that person and sent him down to hell i'm not saying that sister you know just she's gone on for some years now and i'm saying that she she woke up in hell amen i said that's between god and her god says what we don't see amen praise the name of the lord keep your attitude right your spirit right amen god in and revealing simplicity in you god hidden in revealing simplicity in the brightness amen and whoa we we want to make it big big god wants to make it simple amen oh we want to make it this this this like this this mystery this mystery this mystery yeah but if you go read it it's all in simplicity yeah it's all in simple in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth amen all in simplicity god did this god did that amen by the grace of god brother help us not to be ashamed of it lord not to be ashamed of the revelation not to be ashamed of the word not be ashamed of what you've done and what you're doing and we're not going to be ashamed of what you will do lord just give us the word that will give us the faith amen amen praise the lord see faith comes by airing the word and we sometimes we think faith is feelings and faith is this and faith faith is believing the word amen you believe the word believeth out of this amen as he said to martha i am the resurrection of life believeth thou this yes amen praise the lord no wonder lazarus came back amen to god be the glory amen so brother it's the same faith we believe it we're not worked up into it it's not emotion and and not not feeling and again it's just that we just believe it amen hey hallelujah well you believe that uh oh yeah uh we're waiting for eleven o'clock now we're gonna start the service online amen you didn't have to work yourself up to it just do it see it's so such a natural thing for you when it comes to the baptism of the holy ghost the things of god are natural now you just you just go and live it you just talk it you're there as a witness for it i wanna you're not gonna go too far with it but just be led by the spirit you know what does god want me to do when does he want me to do it how does he want me to do it amen but brother i'll tell you this no matter what he wants you to do how he wants you to do it and when and where he wants you to do it you're not ashamed you're there i'm instant in person yeah in the spirit whatever you want lord i'll do it whenever you want me to do it i'll do it amen you want me to witness through this one wait a second i'll do it amen as i said there was a time when i i was a certain place i was working there i see it now a number of times and there was this gentleman that came in and he was a soldier he came in and into the kitchen there and he was walking down the aisle and at the end of the where i was i was in behind all the areas where they would come and pick up their breakfast or whatever and i was doing some things there helping to get ready and when he came in he just went on by and he stopped and he said something and well i stopped and i went right down i said you shouldn't have said that i said you me you need to repent and ask god to forgive you don't you never say that again amen i said even if you don't agree with this this and this you don't see this this and this i said keep your attitude right i said keep your spirit right and it struck him oh sorry and he went on thank god amen well you're taking your stand because you're not ashamed amen you're not doing it show off you're doing it to it for the lord amen to god be the glory amen great things he has done amen and then then god's looking for is your motive your objective your attitude why are you doing this why are you doing that so i'm doing this and do that just to get attention and just to show off get her all that's him that's him that's her that's her no no if it's god in simplicity you're going to give the preeminence to him you're going to give the glory to god amen by the grace of god and again as i said we were sitting there one time and we're in that area and we're just having a snack and going to get this and get that in the kitchen there and we come out and sit down and around the tables there in the living room and discuss this and that amen i said well praise the lord brother again because they knew my faith and knew this and that even though they weren't this or they weren't spiritual all together but they knew oh yeah they respected began what i was believing and they were water is this all right is this all right to do uh gerald you know that's what they were calling me and as as christians does god want this or does god don't want that and so i had to explain to them what what the attitude should be of workers there and so on amen oh what a tremendous testimony they were pulling out of your servant oh yeah because again they knew brother jerome's faith amen and i was giving god the glory amen amen let's give god the glory in your testimony and you understand your taking by the grace of almighty god amen so that you're not ashamed to be a witness when it comes to family friends and neighbors amen whether it's at work at school as university you're not ashamed no amen you're going to be a witness it's not you that lives as christ that lives in you amen it's not you doing this doing that jesus in you amen so the grace of god be with us brother god requires your testimony at home you know god requires your testimony in the midst of family and friends and then sometimes it's not necessarily what you're saying it's what you're living and what you do and what you don't do and they know it and they respect it by the grace of god amen so god of us that we're not ashamed to be a witness to family friends or neighbors we're going to take our stand in the midst of family friends and neighbors and i thank god that for the witness that we've given and that family is not necessarily pulling away from us but they just put themselves under guard when they when when they're with us or where we are with them amen because they respect us and justice just again when myself and sister betty was visiting it was family and

god amen yes don't don't look at this one and that one and think oh they're down there good get down there with them amen praise the lord get down there with them amen they're up there well you just say what you earn and god will bring that one down to you amen god hidden god revealed in simplicity praise the lord amen so he said rejoice in as as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy amen praise the lord brother is not going oh everything's good everything's good i'm not going to do this not going to do that every wonderful and we're going to be with jesus yeah but if you're going to be with jesus he puts you down first then brings you up amen what for to bring out his nature in you to show you and to show the world that you're born again to show the world that you're reflecting jesus not reflecting you it's jesus it's an anointing in your heart and soul amen and if he be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye amen i don't know if all believers feel happy like that what he said yeah happy boy because all spiritual and you're in contact with eternity oh i come from eternity and going back to eternity praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus amen you paid the price amen it says if he be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god rested upon you on their part is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified amen praise the lord but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters amen no yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed amen it's a part of the christian testimony praise the lord praise god not of trying to you're doing this you're doing that trying to avoid amen avoid being suffering as a christian yeah god help us oh we won't take this statement we won't take it yes take that stand if that's what god wants to do god is going to do it in you and through you it's the witness to the world amen and you suffer as a christian did you really really take your stand for all circumstances all situations you'll suffer or they'll they'll take this stand against what you're doing then another stand and understand and the more serious you get the greater the they're going to persecute you amen and i'll tell you it's getting it's going to get so bad where jesus said he says he's going to come to the place where he said it's going to he said he'll be so close we'll deceive the very elect in the last days amen so i pray the grace of god help us lord that we're not going to compromise when it comes to what you you've given us to believe what you give us to testify out we're not going to compromise or be ashamed of it amen we're not going to be embarrassed because oh we're going to do this but look at their attitude well look at their response to jesus we'll take the same response amen so let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busy body in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed amen let him glorify god on this behalf amen and sometimes people might be ashamed or embarrassed because they're taking this stand taking that stand oh and they got this reaction and that reaction from maybe family friends neighbors oh well i think i won't do that if i'm among them and i know that they'll be offended what were they offended are you offended amen are they ashamed of you ashamed god help us we're going to stay with the word amen well jesus stayed he they i oh they could have been the disciples especially peter he could have influenced him to to to compromise oh yeah and jesus you know don't do this just say this say this say this no until till jesus said peter get behind me satan he knew it was satan's influence in peter's life yeah yeah they behind me for you don't savor the things that are of god amen oh no peter felt ashamed by the things that jesus said some of the things he said some of the things that jesus did he felt ashamed embarrassed and here he was trying to change jesus but jesus had to change peter amen because the things that he that jesus was doing peter did on the day of pentecost the stand that that jesus took peter was more than willing to take it when the holy ghost came i tell you the new birth you've got a new new thoughts new mind new spirit new soul new everything has changed yes so you're not living the old nature no more you're living the new nature amen you're not living as a as as a sinner born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen no you've been born again now now you're a new creature hallelujah and it changes you by the grace of god oh yeah you're absolutely changed because whereas before you had this nature this nature these thoughts and these attitudes and so on oh when you became a christian praise the lord everything changed your attitude's changed

nature of god the love of god oh yes praise the lord hallelujah so don't be ashamed well we're going to endure this we got to endure that do it's all right don't be ashamed oh you might feel bad out there in the in in the presence of of family friends and neighbors those worldly people and so on by somebody you won't be bad in his presence if you're taking your stance he loves you amen so he should be not ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf praise the lord amen if you're persecuted give god the glory if they look down on you give god the glory amen my brother if you've got to pay if you've got to sacrifice this sacrifice that give god the lord thank you jesus you're there to help me thank you jesus you're there to give me the strength i need thank you lord hallelujah why because as what jesus saw they see salvation redemption amen a new heaven and a new earth praise the lord i trust we feel like strangers here amen by the grace of god because our brother bishop here

newfoundland amen for me it will be central no no i'm going back where i come from praise the lord god is taking away the natural and giving preeminence to the spiritual amen where did this new creature come from from glory amen from heaven the new heaven and the new earth by the grace of god so he said let him glorify god on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god this is the judgment seat probably god said that's right he said we're judging the people he said by the going forth of the word your action your reaction to it your thoughts your motives your objectives amen you're you're being judged god help us amen for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and it is this is the judgment seat right here going forth of the word and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god amazing amen god's only not responsible more than he's holding them but they're responsible because he's revealed to you what he hasn't revealed to them amen and if the righteous scarcely be saved amazing scarcely the righteous scarcely be saved means that with it is with difficulty and hardship because you're fighting this whole flesh amen so if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear god help us brother he's putting us on our guard and he and he's not putting the others down but he's he's just okay i want to make it a make a show you show you the the the appearance you and the others you the ungodly and the sinner okay grace by the grace of god he said if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the sinner where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear god help us brother you talk about humble us by grace are we saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift amen it is the gift of god to his seed praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah it should keep us humble oh lord oh i know i got the faith i got this i got lord it's you gives it to me thank you for what you've done and what you're doing lord it's not me i'm not i'm not doing it you're working with the salvation in me amen lord you put it in me now you're working it out amen give god the glory and their their believers that give you just glory by themselves oh i'm this and i'm good and i'm this and where there's none good how many times if i said that's people they are you know oh i'm good oh there's none good but one what yeah i said that's the word that's scripture amen and our goodness is in jesus name our goodness is in in the word amen so if the righteous scarcely be saved amen and we want to consider that we're the righteous and our righteousness is not in ourselves in jesus name praise the lord he came back do what he did to make to make us righteous amen so that what open the door say again it's like i don't know what it was that there was some years ago i mentioned it about going to heaven and someone had the dream or a vision of something going to heaven and all the angel was there outside the gate and uh the gate was closed and he come they come up they always said what's your faith oh i'm i'm what i call it i'm this and i'm that and oh i'll come soon what are they yes yep i'm i'm i'm pergamos ty terra tardis and so on and and uh in philadelphia what are you well i believe this oh you believe that yeah oh well very good i'm glad you believed it so you just stand aside that's still not still on what your faith is in well my faith isn't what god did through them oh yeah but there's there's a faith that god's looking for to open that gate and so they went over and stopped talking to somebody else another one come off oh what do you believe oh uh i believe in i'm sanctified yeah and so on i believe in that okay that you expect that to get you into heaven yes yes yeah no he said you better go over there with the mormon with the with the luther's group and talk to them and uh so then the pentecostal came up they said oh what is what is your password to open the gate oh he said uh i believe in the baptism of the holy ghost i believe in the gifts of the spirit all you do and that's your salvation yes your redemption yes yes yeah praise the lord oh he said very good he said but that's not what we're looking for he said go over there there's something that the lutherans and the methodists and the pentecostals and all the others would have in common that would open the gate and they finally came up this young boy and he the angel said to him he said excuse me son he said what is your password and he said oh my password is i trust in the blood of our lord jesus christ he redeemed me amen through calvary well and the angel didn't ever say anything the gate opened amen and he went in yeah why oh he might have been a methodist he might have been a baptist he might have been a pentecostal he might have been some other church amen but his faith wasn't in the these this doctrine that doctrine his faith was in jesus amen jesus the finished work of calvary and the gate automatically opened the angel didn't have to do it amen and he went on into glory amen so brother amen the same with us oh well uh i i believe this oh i believe the seals are open i believe this and i believe that oh yeah well that's good glad good but what's your faith in that'll open the gate there the revelation of of justification won't open the gate the revelation of sanctification won't open the gate the the baptism and the gifts of the spirit that revelation you can declare it all you want not going to open the gate where's your faith amen in jesus that brought you to those revelations amen and oh well i believe god sent a prophet i believe the seals are open oh that won't open the gate and the thing of it is who revealed it who did it willem brown no no no no sorry that won't open the gate jesus did it amen praise the lord and with his stripes i'm healed and he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities and the chastisement of my peace was upon him it's all jesus amen not william branham not martin luther not john wesley not william booth not this one that one amen now it's jesus again as the prophet said you know what your problem is he said you can't see the other angel he said i am not the son of man he said i am a son of man he said but i'm revealing the son of man jesus and that's the one he wanted them to see with jesus not william brennan and that's why god had to take him off the sea amen because they were focusing more and more and more on william branham they wanted him they wanted all the signs and wonders you did oh no he says that me it's jesus he said i can't do this no he and he told him that over and over again i can't do it he said i'm just waiting on him he said he'll do it grace of god amen and uh you know it's amazing that your faith in jesus can bring that look at what john look what uh jack coe did yeah and you know what i saw i was just looking at a film a couple days ago and jack cole i said oh jack cole and he was talking there and and the and the brothers behind him oh i said that's the same place it's the same pulpit i said that brother branham was preaching in and the same people are behind him and this time it was jacob and it was in washington and it was because they went they they turned their camera at one point there and toward the balcony and they were standing all stood up and there was one person that was stood up william branham yeah that film was on on the internet there and it was william branham and i think brother jack cohen did make a reference when he was preaching there he made a reference to william branham and so on and what brother brahma said and what brother ram had done and so on and so he started prayer line brother jack cole this is amazing absolutely amazing the power the anointing the faith that was being manifested he's just there and praying for and and well i guess the devil was afraid of him for sure why because he really rebuked the devil he really kicked the devil out he really you know forced the devil and he just always satan come out in the name of jesus you're gone yeah and he lays on that person and claimed the victory and they're gone healed the next one comes up and he all your scream at that old devil gone they're healed yeah amen but again he was evangelist amen but brother brown was a prophet my brother brown just talked quietly and you know he didn't have the ball like brother jack cole amen just talk quietly said all right satan in the name of jesus move out of this child in the name of jesus move away from this woman we're pleading the blood of jesus get away satan and of course satan was gone they were healed praise the lord amen well it's online jack called yeah and you when you see it you'll see exactly the same thing that was there when brother bannon was preaching praise the lord and brother brown did highlight it he got it william branham well brown did highlight him a couple of times amen jack cole and how you said you you look up and you when he sees the one in the balcony and he's one of them is william watching jack coe amen oh god help us my brother that was good jackal was good but he was gone when he was only 38 39 years old lord took him off the scene amen amen because god was moving william brown i mean amen and some of those ministries that god took would it would have taken the distract the people from william branham from other preachers to that brother amen but like the problem of god said there was three ministering brethren and it was jack not jacob with oral roberts billy graham and william branham and he said this was oral robert's testimony this was billy graham's testimony and he said this was the testimony of the prophet amen by the grace of god god helped us to believe that it was him it was jesus in control amen i got a finished oh my and again verse 18 he said if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear god help us amen wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator hallelujah new creatures in christ praise the lord amen and i thought for sure i go up and read the scriptures and finish the quotes well that's different that's my thoughts not his thoughts god help us let me finish with these thoughts here in the message ashamed and he said you should see those people that word is sinking in where sometimes we don't know it and a brother had just testified to brother branham concerning all the offerings that he had taken from the people for brother branham he said brother brown this is what the people give us to give you and it was a lot of offerings brother brown was shocked and he said see those people that word is sinking in where sometimes we don't know it and he said when he said no matter how much the world is against it is your denominations are against it and god is proving it to be the truth and he said when the great hour finally strikes he says things will happen maybe that we didn't think about and that's the truth i tell you what god did in the ministry of william brown things were happening that they didn't think about they didn't know god was going to do this god was going to do that they weren't aware of the opening of the seven seals and god finishing the mystery of god no they just thought god was going to go on and on and on with an oral roberts ministry of billy graham ministry a.a allen ministry t.l osborne ministry signs and wonders signs and wonders signs and wonders yes but god had ordained the ministry of a prophet amen to reveal the word that would give us rapturing faith amen not faith just for more signs and wonders but faith to get out of here faith to go home to be with the lord amen that's the truth because i remember back there 55 years ago that that this ministry was there that ministry was there we were all listening to a allen listening to t.l osborne listening to oral roberts and occasionally like i said we missed we would listen to our brother billy graham and as i said that's that's what we listen to every every sunday when we're having our supper my my father would go over and turn the radio on and listen to billy graham amen so brother but then then there was a oral roberts and there was a a allen there was still also osborne we were getting their magazines and we're seeing what god was doing in their ministry signs and wonders amen but then the prophet came on the scene amen oh yeah and here was sister branham that had a she had a record that was the old-fashioned records back then and somebody had loaned her a record they said oh sister burns you're going to love this this is brother william branham's testimony now they weren't recognizing a prophet but they're recognizing a man that was used of god to do this to do that and they gave sister burns the record of brother brown's life story and sister byron listened to it and she loved what she was hearing she was praising god amen and then later on not not very long after that that she had heard that record amen she was she was receiving magazines from like teal osborne a.a allen and other magazines i'm not sure it was what one it was but there was one that she received and she was shocked when she opened it and saw it on the cover in memory of william branham and the dates of his birth the date of his death sister brennan was shocked and it struck her and she cried oh yeah she was sitting in her home and she cried oh my lord what have you done you have taken him off the scene and lord the ministry that he had always struck her and she i think she went back and to listen to the record again amen and it that was in in april or may or march or april when the no you it was not december 65 and yes this was in 1966 she got the magazine and they honored reverend william branham gone to be with the lord and from there on apparently they started to get more and more into search william brown's testimony william brown's witness and so on amen until finally someone sent them more information of william branham the prophet you know and that's what brought us into the message amen oh yes what happened was she met somebody that her brother barnes met certain person and i know who that person was and there was a person that had a store not far from brother burns and brother barnes went up that went into the store to buy some groceries and food and things and the gentleman that was behind the counter serving and he owned it all and he said oh he said you you people are like uh are like the believers in central newfoundland so what where he said bishop falls he said they believe what you believe they're like that they're not denominational and so on oh so that's what that's what sold the seed for brother burns to eventually get in contact with him and brother as i said i was in gamble for the first cottage meeting that those those brethren held brother brother cater was there with the films and of course he rented the the the theater that was in dark cope gamble he rented the theater and i remember being in the theater and watching the films of brother branham then we went on with brother emanuel after that and we had a cottage meeting in sister golding's house a man and uh of course the brother burns was there sister burns was there and i was there and the first sermon i heard was serpent seed yeah the original scene and so on what was going on they said what you heard that one first yeah i said it struck me and i said amen i believe it and i was just just a teenager i said i believe that i said i'll say it the lord amen that's good so from there on we started to grow and mature in the word amen to bring me to this place amen and now many of them most of all of them are gone so i pray the grace of god to take us on to the rapture amen brother it's been 55 years god help us amen but i pray yeah god took the prophet brother we now we want him to take us into the resurrection into the rapture by the grace of god amen yes why lord are we still here i think brother jonathan must mention 55 years and why are we still here now amen trust by grace said that all the seed of god the bride of christ is in the word brothers not just calling christians no no that's out there god got them out there doing that as the problem god said let me say it again he said now he said we won't get this message to to all out there to the world no no but but it's only for the bride amen so as as all the bride been gathered in as all the bride been called amen and it's to get our attention to the resurrection and rapture to give us the faith that pleases god now not faith to go to another church not faith just to do this just to do that no faith for to get out of here how many want to get out of here god help us i tell you because of the worldly conditions and everything there are fewer and fewer who really want to get out i believe if you want to get out you're going to put more emphasis on it you want to get out you're going to start praying more talking to the lord about it lord where's the resurrection even concerning what's going on out here now around the world i tell you the brightest is focusing not on that the bride's focusing on the resurrection lord the hours come please take us home lord we want to go home we want to go home how many really want to get out of here amen not because of what's going on there but because what's going on in our souls amen so he said how can a man who is filled with the holy spirit the holy ghost how can a man full of the power of god the love of god in his heart talk to a man a few minutes and not mention something about that love that is in your heart amen of your true relationship with jesus amen he said must be that he said this is must be that evil day that jesus was speaking of and he said people are ashamed of the word amen and of the spirit of god that acts within them but when the truth is made plain to the people god himself is revealing himself through the word amen so he said in the last days the spirit will be so close it would deceive the elect if possible amen but he said when it comes to a genuine alter to unadulterated word of god confirmed by god it seems to even embarrass the other group amen listen he said there is an embarrassment about it well ashamed those that are ashamed they feel embarrassed having to take their stand for this or for this or for that they feel that's not necessary god's not in this god's not in there oh yes he is amen remember he said in the beginning god did this and god did that and then at the end he said concerning the revelation of god he said don't add to it don't take from it amen and that's why again john prayed the grace of god to us because there's people still wanting to add to their relationship with god they want to take away their from their relationship with god oh lord i don't believe you want to support the emphasis on this they're on that nor shall we we'll just lay that aside no god wants you to keep it amen don't add to it don't take from it amen i tell you hallelujah if there's anything that brighter that the message is creating today it's the call in the bride this remember the bible says the spirit and the bride say come amen praise the name of the lord so i pray i pray that we're under the anointing of the spirit we're the bride amen come for all things are ready by the grace of god amen i'll just say do another quote and he said you listen to it not whether my wife as a christian good christian or my husband is a good christian but he said i am am i right with god that's it are you right with god yeah is your attitude toward god right your attitude toward jesus right amen do you really really truly have a personal relationship with jesus not an intellectual knowledge of jesus an intellectual revelation of jesus but a spiritual experience with jesus amen remember we need a spiritual experience so that he's in us to take us out amen we've got to have an experience with jesus of the resurrection and the rapture i've been born again yeah i'm a new creature in christ in my soul but lord where's my body where's the new body amen amen that's what we're believing for a new body jesus laid down is and picked it up again amen we couldn't do that amen but we can lay down in our faith believing that jesus is going to raise it again in a new in a glorified body boy because jesus picked up his body come back to share the life of that body with us amen praise the lord because we're going to receive a new body like onto his glorious body amen and she said i have i met jesus not because i shouted not because i spoke in tongues but because i met him as a person then he said you will never be ashamed of that there is something that's so perfect and pure and true and remember you you might meet a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit would do this or the other follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god he said you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling and you would shout and scream and then he said when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny the word so they got an experience with god but they can have it in their flesh yeah in their spirit but not in their soul god help us we preached on that the three kinds of believers amen god help us make sure you're a believer and you're a believer out of your soul by the grace of god amen again you might meet a spirit that will tell you you are saved give you a glorious feeling and you will shout and scream and then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word if he's in your soul he won't deny it
