[41:48] not today so much but you'll say I never
[41:51] realized that and if I had the Holy
[41:52] Ghost then how come I've never done that
[41:54] or never realized that well it's because
[41:56] you have the Holy Ghost that you can
[41:57] receive it now amen when we were when we
[41:59] when we received the Holy Ghost when we
[42:01] got a new birth we did not just receive
[42:03] a download of all of the knowledge and
[42:05] information and revelation of what the
[42:07] word has for us we have to grow we have
[42:09] to mature in Christ and so that means
[42:11] that we can we can live with things in
[42:13] our life we can do things and and until
[42:15] God gives us a revelation then there's
[42:18] nothing that we're held accountable to
[42:19] it's just there and and and it can be
[42:21] there but then God comes along and by
[42:23] the preaching of the word by the reading
[42:24] of the word by the conviction of the
[42:26] Holy Ghost however comes we realize hey
[42:28] that ought not to be in my life or I
[42:29] ought to be doing this or I ought not to
[42:31] do that or I ought to pull away from
[42:32] this or change that in my life and it's
[42:34] just God working with us Bit by Bit by
[42:36] Bit amen so so don't if you hear
[42:38] something you say well how can I have
[42:40] the Holy Ghost and think that or or do
[42:41] this or that don't don't pull away from
[42:44] your Christian experience because you're
[42:45] not perfect that that's not what the
[42:47] Holy Ghost was given for the the Holy
[42:49] Ghost was not given for Perfection the
[42:51] Holy Ghost was to bring us to maturity
[42:53] amen it's the blood of Christ that makes
[42:55] us perfect that's what I'm trusting in
[42:56] is not my perfection it's in his amen
[42:59] but rather if you hear something you say
[43:01] I I I I I ought to be doing that then
[43:03] say Lord I'm holding you to your word
[43:05] you've given me your spirit you've given
[43:07] me the baptism of your spirit in my soul
[43:09] now make it live the word that I've
[43:11] heard today or that I've heard in the
[43:12] week or whatever it might be amen
[43:15] because we're going towards a
[43:16] resurrection and a Rapture now I don't
[43:18] know about you but I don't know if I'm
[43:19] Rapture Ready yet I believe when I'm
[43:22] Rapture Ready then we'll go in a Rapture
[43:23] I believe when you're ready we'll go in
[43:24] a Rapture but until we're there that
[43:26] means I've got a to grow in I've got to
[43:28] grow in faith I've got to grow in
[43:29] maturity I've got to grow in Revelation
[43:31] of what God has for me in this life and
[43:33] so all I say is God keep me out of the
[43:35] way God help me keep growing day by day
[43:37] in my walk and let me not stand in the
[43:39] way of what you're trying to do inside
[43:41] of my life now we spoke last service on
[43:44] the old mostly from the Old Testament we
[43:45] talked about the Holy Ghost being the
[43:47] the true circumcision and it's the
[43:49] circumcision of your heart that that
[43:51] makes a separation from the world and
[43:53] the things of the world and the love of
[43:54] the world and it's God's way of taking
[43:56] us out of what Satan has created his
[43:59] Eden that he has here and drawing us
[44:01] back to the original Eden where we had
[44:03] full relationship with God and we had
[44:04] full Authority and Dominion by his word
[44:07] but today I want to take a bit of a
[44:09] different route here and talk about what
[44:11] the Holy Ghost is and what it means to
[44:12] us in a bigger way a and move us beyond
[44:15] the types and shadows and now bring us
[44:17] into the reality of what the word
[44:19] preaches and what the gospel preaches
[44:20] today and I've got a Title Here of the
[44:22] new birth and and and we have this
[44:24] phrase the new birth or being born again
[44:27] and I think it's one of the most
[44:28] misunderstood things in Christianity
[44:30] today because we have this idea that
[44:32] we're born again if we say the sinner's
[44:34] prayer or we come up and we go to the
[44:36] altar or even we get our we get baptized
[44:38] or we get sprinkled or we sign our name
[44:40] to a church book and none of those
[44:42] things mean you are born again and yet
[44:44] you have people that are preaching that
[44:45] all over this world that you're born
[44:47] again as soon as you say a sinner's
[44:49] prayer or something like this those
[44:50] things are all good some of them are
[44:52] even necessary but no one of them means
[44:55] that you are born again we'll see what
[44:57] it means to be born again amen and Jesus
[44:59] is the first person that ever used this
[45:01] term born again and we read it in our in
[45:04] our opening scripture this morning and
[45:05] he makes it very clear that being born
[45:07] again is beyond repentance and it's
[45:09] beyond baptism amen it's not just those
[45:12] things remember John the Baptist came
[45:14] with a message of repentance and baptism
[45:17] and that wasn't enough to make people
[45:18] born again when they when Jesus came
[45:21] there were not a bunch of people that
[45:22] were born again under John's Ministry
[45:23] and yet he preached repentance and
[45:25] baptism so that can't be it it's got to
[45:27] be beyond that amen amen we ought to
[45:29] know that so John knew the limitations
[45:31] of his own Ministry amen and he was just
[45:34] preparing the way for the full
[45:35] experience of the New Birth by the New
[45:38] Covenant under the Grace Covenant and
[45:39] his was a voice he said crying prepare
[45:42] ye the way of the Lord in other words he
[45:44] says my Ministry is to get you ready for
[45:46] the real Ministry to get you ready for
[45:48] this thing you've been praying for this
[45:50] thing you've been expecting what the
[45:52] word is said was going to happen I'm
[45:54] just preparing the way for the fullness
[45:56] of the word to come to you and it says
[45:58] in Matthew 3 speaking of John it says in
[46:01] those days Came John the Baptist
[46:02] preaching in the wilderness of Judea and
[46:05] saying repent ye for the Kingdom of
[46:08] Heaven is at hand he did not say it's
[46:10] here he says it's coming I'm just
[46:12] preparing you for what's coming he says
[46:15] for this is he that was spoken by the
[46:17] prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one
[46:19] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[46:22] way of the Lord make his path straight
[46:24] so the in the Book of Matthew it says
[46:26] that John is fulfilling Isaiah where
[46:28] he's a preparation for the Messiah
[46:30] coming but when we drop down to verse 11
[46:33] this is John speaking now he says I
[46:35] indeed baptize you with water unto
[46:38] repentance now we're going to go to acts
[46:40] 238 in a little bit and there Peter says
[46:42] repent and be baptized that's what
[46:45] John's doing repent and be baptized he
[46:47] says but he that cometh after me is
[46:49] mightier than I whose shoes I'm not
[46:52] worthy to Bear he says I can't even put
[46:53] his shoes on That's How Much Greater he
[46:55] is than I am he says he shall baptize
[46:58] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so
[47:02] catch that now the baptism of Jesus
[47:05] Christ is not of water it's of Holy
[47:07] Ghost it's of fire it's of spirit water
[47:09] baptism is required but that's not the
[47:11] real baptism we're looking for that
[47:13] won't do the job it'll it's a
[47:15] representation of a work but it won't do
[47:16] the work in and of itself amen so John's
[47:19] message was repentance it was a turning
[47:21] away from those things that are wrong in
[47:23] God's eyes and that was followed by
[47:25] water baptism but even the water baptism
[47:27] of John was not full or proper and we
[47:30] see when that it wasn't enough on its
[47:32] own because in Acts 19 remember Paul
[47:34] comes to these true believers they were
[47:36] True Believers and he says have you
[47:38] received the Holy Ghost since you
[47:40] believed and they said no we haven't we
[47:41] don't even know about it he says well
[47:43] how were you
[47:45] baptized in other words it matters how
[47:48] you're
[47:49] baptized and they said well we were
[47:51] baptized unto John's Ministry and he
[47:54] says no no no you haven't gone far
[47:56] enough that that was great you
[47:57] recognized John but John pointed to
[48:00] somebody else and you had to continue
[48:02] from John's Ministry into the ministry
[48:04] of Christ he says you need to be
[48:06] re-baptized unto Christ's Ministry in
[48:09] Christ's name in order to receive the
[48:11] full ministry of Jesus Christ and so as
[48:14] soon as they did that as soon as they
[48:15] were baptized in jesus' name then Paul
[48:18] laid hands on them and they received the
[48:19] Holy Ghost there was nothing wrong with
[48:21] them they just needed to follow the
[48:24] prescription and so that's what they did
[48:26] because they were real believers they
[48:28] followed what the word said they grew in
[48:30] their
[48:31] Revelation that's what we're supposed to
[48:33] do when we're talking with people you're
[48:35] talking with people that maybe don't
[48:37] have the Revelation you do don't tear
[48:38] away what they have build on the truth
[48:40] that they have ignore what's wrong but
[48:42] build on what they have if they all they
[48:46] have is that I've accepted Jesus Christ
[48:47] as my savior say well there's more than
[48:50] that have you receed the Holy Ghost
[48:51] since you accepted him as your savior
[48:53] but don't tear him down don't say you're
[48:54] not a Christian you're not a Believer
[48:56] they just maybe don't know what they
[48:57] need to do and the minute you tell them
[48:59] by God's grace hopefully they'll do it
[49:02] but we come to Jesus now and John is
[49:04] pointing to him and then when he comes
[49:05] he identifies him and from the very
[49:07] get-go Jesus is recognized as something
[49:10] special even by those that hated him his
[49:13] ministry was was full of signs and
[49:15] wonders his Doctrine was astonishing
[49:18] remember what the scripture says he
[49:19] didn't speak like the the priesthood of
[49:21] the day but he spoke with
[49:23] authority it's a sad State of Affairs
[49:25] isn't it
[49:27] nobody has Authority today everyone has
[49:30] multiple answers for one
[49:32] question they don't have truth if you've
[49:34] got three answers for the same question
[49:36] it might be this it might be that it
[49:37] could be this it could be that no we
[49:38] ought to have a truth that we're resting
[49:40] on and Jesus spoke with authority he
[49:42] never had to Waffle he never had to go
[49:44] back and forth he wasn't bowed by the
[49:46] the the the social norms of the day or
[49:48] by the injustices all he brought was the
[49:51] word and it was it was conis it cut
[49:54] through everything and it came right
[49:55] down to the truth of the word word of
[49:57] God but we see here in our opening
[49:59] scripture that Nicodemus comes to him
[50:00] and Nicodemus is a teacher he he's a is
[50:03] a part of the ministry and he he he
[50:05] comes to Jesus secretly by night he
[50:07] doesn't want to be identified with Jesus
[50:10] but he he he's he's curious about who he
[50:12] is and what he is it says there was a
[50:14] man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a
[50:16] ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus
[50:18] by night and said unto him Rabbi we
[50:21] know we know that thou art a teacher
[50:24] come from God for no man can do the
[50:26] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[50:28] with them he says there's nobody's done
[50:31] what you've done and so we know God's
[50:33] got to be with
[50:34] you but watch how Jesus comes back Jesus
[50:37] doesn't say you're absolutely right
[50:39] Nicodemus boy you've got a real
[50:42] Revelation Jesus answered and said unto
[50:44] him verily verily I say unto thee except
[50:47] a man be born again he cannot see the
[50:51] kingdom of God now that word that
[50:53] Nicodemus uses there no and the word
[50:56] that Jesus uses see are the exact same
[50:58] word and it means to be aware to behold
[51:02] to consider to perceive in reality and
[51:05] it's a new testament only word it's only
[51:07] used in the New Testament it's not that
[51:09] it didn't exist previously but it's that
[51:11] the word is a new testament word and it
[51:13] reflects the true understanding of who
[51:16] and what God is and that's what he's
[51:18] pointing at now Nicodemus uses it first
[51:21] and he says we know we're aware that
[51:22] you're a teacher come from God and Jesus
[51:25] comes right back at him and he says
[51:26] Nicodemus you don't have a
[51:28] clue we would think Nicodemus has an
[51:31] idea of what's going on Jesus comes back
[51:32] and says Nicodemus you can't even
[51:34] understand you can't perceive you can't
[51:36] see you're not even aware of what's
[51:38] going on because the only way to truly
[51:41] know and see who I am is to be born
[51:44] again all Nicodemus has is an inkling
[51:48] and it's not settled on anything because
[51:49] he's just wondering he's wondering he
[51:51] says we know you're from God but but who
[51:53] are you why do you how how can you do
[51:55] these things why aren't you you know why
[51:56] aren't you with us why are you outside
[51:58] of us and all he can't place him in the
[52:00] scripture he can't place the way he's
[52:01] living he can't place the way he's
[52:03] preaching but he's he's intrigued by it
[52:05] because there's something there that he
[52:06] doesn't have amen but remember he's a
[52:09] minister he's dedicated to the word of
[52:11] God and yet Jesus comes to him and says
[52:13] it is impossible for you to understand
[52:16] what's happening right now except you be
[52:19] born
[52:20] again and so Nicodemus comes back and he
[52:23] says how can a man be born again when
[52:25] he's old can he enter the second time
[52:27] into his mother's womb and be born
[52:29] Nicodemus doesn't even know what being
[52:30] born again
[52:31] is he says can I go back into my mother
[52:35] that's impossible I can't be born again
[52:37] and Jesus answered verily verily I say
[52:40] unto thee except a man be born of what
[52:43] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[52:47] into the kingdom of God so you have to
[52:49] be born of water you have to be born of
[52:51] spirit two elements not just one not
[52:53] just the other both of them have to come
[52:55] together and we see what those things
[52:57] are he says that which is born of the
[52:59] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[53:01] the spirit is spirit so catch that you
[53:03] can't have a spiritual Birth by natural
[53:06] means in other words you can't be
[53:08] spiritually born based on who your mama
[53:10] is who your daddy is who your minister
[53:13] is who your pastor is what church you're
[53:14] going to what your DNA is that has
[53:17] nothing to do with it you can't be
[53:19] spiritual based on your natural birth
[53:22] now that's of great comfort to some of
[53:24] us because some of us come from horrible
[53:25] families
[53:27] and guess what some of us come from
[53:29] spiritual families and we can rest on
[53:31] where we come from and say that means
[53:33] I'm automatically a child of God you're
[53:35] not a child of God proven until you're
[53:37] born of the water and of the spirit amen
[53:40] that's what makes you a child of God the
[53:42] spiritual birth is a new birth it's
[53:43] being born again and it has nothing to
[53:45] do with this nature that you have
[53:47] naturally with who your family is your
[53:48] ministry whatever it might be and he
[53:51] says Marvel not that I said unto thee
[53:52] you must be born again he says this
[53:55] beautiful thing he says the the wind
[53:56] bloweth where it listeth and thou
[53:58] hearest the sound thereof but can not
[54:01] tell whence it cometh and whether it go
[54:03] he says so is everyone that is born of
[54:08] the
[54:09] spirit now listen to this quote he says
[54:11] how can you tell people things of the
[54:13] spirit that's not born of the spirit you
[54:16] have to be born of the spirit to
[54:18] understand the things of the spirit
[54:20] Jesus said the wind bloweth where it
[54:21] listeth thou cannot tell which way it
[54:23] comes or where it goes see so is
[54:25] everyone born of the spirit they can't
[54:28] tell you a man that's born of the spirit
[54:30] doesn't take any thought he lets God do
[54:33] the thinking church when you're born
[54:35] again you can't go around and tell
[54:37] everybody what it means to be born again
[54:39] you can't tell them how it happened you
[54:41] can't tell them how you know you can't
[54:43] explain how it works amen it doesn't
[54:46] make sense to them it will never make
[54:47] sense to them and if we're honest Church
[54:49] many times we don't understand it fully
[54:52] ourselves we don't we don't we we we
[54:55] will go and do things we'll go and say
[54:57] things sometimes we won't say things
[55:00] we'll go here we'll go there and we
[55:02] don't know why we're doing it all we
[55:04] know is we feel led to do it or God help
[55:07] us we feel not to do it and that's the
[55:10] moving of the spirit in our life and you
[55:12] go tell somebody I'm not going there
[55:15] today why not I just can't
[55:18] go I'm not going on the road
[55:21] today I'm not going to that meeting I'm
[55:24] not taking that job I can't be with you
[55:27] here why not I just can't do it and you
[55:30] can't even explain it yourself there's
[55:32] something in you that's holding you back
[55:35] there's something checking you or
[55:37] sometimes praise God there's something
[55:38] that is forcing the words out of your
[55:41] mouth because it's the Holy Ghost inside
[55:44] of you that's saying
[55:45] Speak you must speak you must be a
[55:48] witness for me you cannot be silent you
[55:51] have to testify right brother Grant
[55:53] there are times where you have to speak
[55:55] no matter how uncomfortable it makes you
[55:58] or how uncomfortable it makes others
[56:01] we've got to be able to say I'm doing it
[56:02] and I don't even like it sometimes but
[56:04] there's something inside of me calling
[56:06] out saying you better do it and you have
[56:09] no rest until you do these things try
[56:11] and explain that to somebody where
[56:13] they're led by their feelings where
[56:15] they're led by their Comforts where
[56:16] they're led by what people think about
[56:18] them you can't do it amen Jesus said
[56:20] that's the way people that are led by
[56:22] the spirit that are born again by the
[56:24] spirit are they're the wind blowing here
[56:26] and there and all you know is that
[56:28] there's something going on but you can't
[56:29] explain it that's the way the people of
[56:31] God are we have to be so careful with
[56:34] these things though because we're in an
[56:36] age of feelings and emotions and the
[56:38] world says if you feel it it must be
[56:41] right isn't that the way it is today and
[56:43] look at the insanity it has produced in
[56:46] this world the world has gone completely
[56:48] at same but remember the leadership of
[56:51] the Holy Spirit the unction of the holy
[56:53] spirit will never ever ever ever Lead
[56:57] You contrary to the word of God ever it
[56:59] is impossible and we'll see why as we
[57:01] get into this service anymore I touched
[57:03] on this briefly when I spoke in Edmonton
[57:05] how we have come to the place
[57:07] unfortunately where we are LED going by
[57:09] the feeling of the
[57:11] unction rather than the foundation of
[57:14] the unction amen where we go by the
[57:17] feeling of what we feel led to do rather
[57:20] than the certainty of the word of God
[57:23] now I'll use myself as an example I
[57:25] study and I pray and I dwell before God
[57:28] when it comes to studying for services
[57:30] to preach and these different things and
[57:31] I have had many thoughts that seemed
[57:34] very good to me on the onset and I
[57:35] thought wow that is
[57:38] amazing and then what did I do I go and
[57:41] I do not write a sermon I do not bring
[57:43] out these things without going back to
[57:45] the word of
[57:47] God that's the only that's the only y
[57:50] thumb and that's the only absolute I
[57:51] have is this Bible right here and I've
[57:54] got to be able to start on the first
[57:56] page and take it all the way to the last
[57:58] page and there have been some thoughts
[58:00] that I pulled through sometimes all the
[58:03] way to Revelation and then it falls
[58:07] apart amen anybody that's studied or
[58:09] preached knows this and what did I do
[58:12] when I came to that point where it
[58:14] disagreed with the word of God church
[58:16] cuz I've got to have I make a decision
[58:18] do I get lifted up in Pride and say it's
[58:22] inspiration I'm going to force it
[58:24] through or I'm going to find a loophole
[58:27] or I'm not going to bring that one
[58:29] scripture that undo the total
[58:32] inspiration or do I throw it away
[58:35] because you cannot force inspiration
[58:38] through the word of God it has to fit
[58:41] easily so what do I do church when I hit
[58:43] that point where it doesn't fit the word
[58:46] I have to do one thing throw it
[58:48] away throw it away you have no other
[58:51] choice you have no other choice amen the
[58:54] word of God is what is inspire ired and
[58:56] my inspiration has to be subject to the
[59:00] word of God at all times at all times
[59:03] amen my inspiration has to come
[59:05] according to the word of God remember
[59:06] what Paul said in Corinthians he said he
[59:08] says Marvel not he says Satan himself is
[59:11] transformed into an angel of Light in
[59:13] other words satanic inspiration can
[59:16] appear to be
[59:18] truth satanic inspiration let me blow
[59:21] your mind is 99%
[59:23] truth it just is incomplete
[59:26] or it misconstrues just a little bit and
[59:29] all Satan's trying to do is get you off
[59:30] the Mark just by one degree because when
[59:33] you go down the road that one degree
[59:34] turns into not just an inch off the
[59:36] center of the Target now you're a foot
[59:38] now you're a meter now you go far enough
[59:40] and you are so far off the target you
[59:41] say where did I go wrong you went wrong
[59:43] at the 1% where Satan lied to you and
[59:44] you believed it I have to check my
[59:46] inspiration through the word of God and
[59:48] you do as well amen two people are many
[59:50] people are choosing to pray and not come
[59:53] back to this it doesn't work that way
[59:56] you have to check your inspiration
[59:58] through this amen and the problem is is
[1:00:00] that this cuts through the
[1:00:04] fog when it says it here you have no
[1:00:06] excuse now you got to take it or leave
[1:00:08] it and you got to make a decision but if
[1:00:10] you just pray and say I feel I feel I
[1:00:12] feel then what are you left with your
[1:00:13] feelings and guess what the heart is
[1:00:15] deceptive above all things that's not it
[1:00:17] amen we can't rely on our heart to make
[1:00:20] the right decision my suggestion to you
[1:00:22] always start with prayer because what
[1:00:25] are you doing you're in God into your
[1:00:27] situation and you're saying God I want
[1:00:29] what you want not what I want so Lord
[1:00:32] will you show me what you would have me
[1:00:34] to do and then what do you do you go
[1:00:36] back to the word and you say Lord show
[1:00:38] me by your word so I have an absolute
[1:00:40] Foundation to rest on that is that is
[1:00:43] unchanging that's what we're supposed to
[1:00:45] do amen but in the end whether we've got
[1:00:47] a scripture or not we cannot explain
[1:00:50] ourselves to an
[1:00:51] unbeliever you can't even explain
[1:00:53] yourself to a nominal Christian because
[1:00:55] it make sense to them it will not make
[1:00:57] sense to them uh I'll leave it
[1:01:01] alone we can't explain our way of living
[1:01:04] we can't explain our way of Separation
[1:01:06] we can't explain the way we run our
[1:01:08] finances we can't explain our commitment
[1:01:10] to the body of Christ to somebody that
[1:01:11] doesn't have the Holy Ghost it makes no
[1:01:13] sense to them
[1:01:16] amen take this
[1:01:19] example try and explain to somebody how
[1:01:21] you know when you love
[1:01:24] someone isn't that the Great great test
[1:01:26] for our young people Mom Dad I really
[1:01:30] like him I really like her but how do I
[1:01:33] know when I'm really in
[1:01:36] love go ahead explain it brother
[1:01:39] Bob you know what he'd say go ask your
[1:01:44] mom and you know what she will spend a
[1:01:46] half hour explaining it and in the end
[1:01:48] they will be no closer to the truth
[1:01:49] because you can't explain love you can't
[1:01:52] explain the contradictions of love how
[1:01:54] it will make you do things that are even
[1:01:56] bad for yourself for the sake of that
[1:01:59] person it'll make you sacrifi I remember
[1:02:03] Blanca and I when we courted she was in
[1:02:05] California I was in New Finland 4 and a
[1:02:07] half hours time difference she didn't
[1:02:09] get home till 11:00 p.m. my time and I
[1:02:11] can't tell you how many times I stayed
[1:02:12] on the phone till 3 4 5 6:00 in the
[1:02:14] morning talking to
[1:02:16] her that ain't good for your health
[1:02:19] church it's not good for your sleep it's
[1:02:22] not good for it's not a good habit to
[1:02:24] get into and yet I would will L
[1:02:26] sacrifice my sleep for her I would spend
[1:02:31] money I didn't have to make her happy I
[1:02:34] would do things I didn't necessarily
[1:02:35] want to do because she wanted to do it
[1:02:38] because I loved
[1:02:40] her but then it moved beyond that to now
[1:02:43] living together and there's a greater
[1:02:46] sacrifice that comes with that and
[1:02:47] that's really when you find out was it
[1:02:49] in love or was it love but it's going to
[1:02:51] start with all sorts of things and when
[1:02:53] you see them and you get those fluttery
[1:02:55] feelings in your stomach and God your
[1:02:56] heart starts to
[1:02:58] go
[1:03:00] right all these things build up but no
[1:03:03] one of them is love and guess what
[1:03:05] there's many people went through
[1:03:07] everything I've just talked about and it
[1:03:08] ended up just being
[1:03:11] affection infection sometimes
[1:03:14] infatuation or
[1:03:16] lust why you can't explain it and so
[1:03:18] what do we come back with you'll know
[1:03:20] when you
[1:03:22] know and you'll know when you know
[1:03:24] usually much further down the Road when
[1:03:26] it's been tested and tried and proven as
[1:03:29] being love rather than in love because
[1:03:32] when you love you'll be
[1:03:34] loving rather than just in love but go
[1:03:36] and explain to somebody this is how you
[1:03:38] know that this is the one you can't do
[1:03:40] it it's got to be a revelation by
[1:03:43] experience proven by time that's the
[1:03:45] only thing that's the only thing we have
[1:03:47] amen so try to explain something like
[1:03:50] the Holy Ghost which is the epitome of
[1:03:51] love it is the greatest love and explain
[1:03:54] how to one person it's a hug and the
[1:03:56] next one it's a spanking the exact same
[1:03:59] love you can't explain it you can't
[1:04:02] explain it and yet that's what it is
[1:04:04] they've got to experience amen so don't
[1:04:06] try and tell people this is why I do
[1:04:08] what I do say I do what I do because
[1:04:10] I've met Jesus Christ and he's been made
[1:04:12] personal to me and that's all you're
[1:04:14] left with and say you've got to
[1:04:15] experience him the same way I've
[1:04:17] experienced him to know what I'm talking
[1:04:18] about and hopefully your life is enough
[1:04:20] of a draw to those people that they'll
[1:04:22] say I'm willing to do it I'm willing to
[1:04:24] do it
[1:04:26] Jesus Nicodemus answers Jesus he said
[1:04:29] unto him how can these things be how can
[1:04:32] what things
[1:04:33] be he said the blowing of the spirit the
[1:04:35] new birth and these different things and
[1:04:37] Jesus answered and said unto him art
[1:04:38] thou a master of Israel and knowest not
[1:04:40] these things in other words saying Jesus
[1:04:42] saying you're the best of the best you
[1:04:43] study the scriptures you know you know
[1:04:45] all of the Old Testament you know all of
[1:04:47] the Books of Moses you know all the
[1:04:49] books of the prophets and you don't know
[1:04:50] you need a new
[1:04:52] birth have you not read Ezekiel 37 which
[1:04:55] we read last service he says I'll give
[1:04:57] you a new heart and I'll give you a new
[1:04:58] spirit and then I'll place my spirit
[1:04:59] within you that's what I'm talking about
[1:05:01] Nicodemus he says how do you not know
[1:05:03] this why is Nicodemus so ignorant Church
[1:05:06] why were the priesthoods so ignorant
[1:05:09] because they didn't think they needed a
[1:05:10] new
[1:05:11] birth they were looking for messiah to
[1:05:13] come and affirm them where they
[1:05:16] were and say you're it you've got it
[1:05:19] you're great you've done exactly what I
[1:05:20] said enter into the joys of
[1:05:23] Heaven and the law was just there to as
[1:05:27] a placeholder until God could set them
[1:05:29] free from the law till he could fulfill
[1:05:31] it and set them free and bring them into
[1:05:33] Grace amen but these men were convinced
[1:05:35] of their own righteousness of their good
[1:05:37] standing of their piety uh of their
[1:05:39] righteousness before God their
[1:05:41] revelation of the word and they didn't
[1:05:43] think they needed to
[1:05:45] change that's why they weren't looking
[1:05:47] for it amen the greatest detriment to
[1:05:49] the New Birth that I know of is to think
[1:05:51] that you don't need to change
[1:05:56] and and there's two influences that I
[1:05:58] can think of that would bring something
[1:06:00] like that there amen the first is a
[1:06:02] religious
[1:06:04] spirit sometimes the people that need
[1:06:06] the New Birth the greatest are those
[1:06:07] that are sitting in
[1:06:08] church amen because they've got enough
[1:06:10] knowledge of the word of God a and of
[1:06:13] the word of God you live a clean life
[1:06:15] you try and do right and you figure
[1:06:17] that's more than enough to satisfy God
[1:06:19] and so you say God will God will come
[1:06:21] and affirm me God will confirm me rather
[1:06:24] than I need to be changed to be pleasing
[1:06:26] to God you're resting in what you know
[1:06:29] and and in what you
[1:06:31] have rather than the blood of Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ and the filling of the
[1:06:36] spirit but the second group you'll find
[1:06:39] is it's people that say God made me as I
[1:06:41] am therefore why do I have to change and
[1:06:44] this is what you find preeminently
[1:06:45] outside of Christianity is they say God
[1:06:48] made me this way why do I need to change
[1:06:50] but there's a fallacy in their thinking
[1:06:52] because we are not born in the image of
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] we are born in the sinful image of
[1:07:00] man see after Eden nobody was born in
[1:07:02] the image of God sin brought them to a
[1:07:04] fall and so we are not brought into this
[1:07:07] world in the image of God we're brought
[1:07:09] in under the curse of sin so what we
[1:07:12] have in this flesh is not of God's
[1:07:14] choosing now don't think God doesn't
[1:07:16] have a hand in it because he does he
[1:07:18] says in Jeremiah I that he formed Us in
[1:07:20] the belly of our mother life comes from
[1:07:22] him but we are not born as children of
[1:07:25] God or meant to be born we're not born
[1:07:26] in the image of God we're born in the
[1:07:29] image of our parents by their choice and
[1:07:31] by their will amen so you need to be
[1:07:35] changed but here's the thing whether
[1:07:37] you're born good or whether you're born
[1:07:40] bad we all need to be changed and
[1:07:42] whether you're born into a Christian
[1:07:44] family or whether you're born into an
[1:07:45] atheist family whether you're born into
[1:07:47] a Muslim family a Hindu family whatever
[1:07:49] it is you still need to be born again
[1:07:52] amen what you're born into does not
[1:07:53] change it because it's all sin and it
[1:07:56] cannot come before God Amen and yet
[1:07:59] Nicodemus I have to give him credit
[1:08:01] because for all that he has and for all
[1:08:03] that he is and for all of his position
[1:08:06] and all of his influence he knows one
[1:08:07] thing Jesus has something he doesn't
[1:08:10] have Jesus has something he doesn't have
[1:08:13] and so what he's coming he's saying what
[1:08:15] he's really saying is how do I get what
[1:08:17] you get how did you get where you are
[1:08:19] cuz I want to be where you are I've had
[1:08:21] it
[1:08:22] all I've got it all as far as it could
[1:08:25] take me and yet you are so far above me
[1:08:28] and Beyond me how do you get it where's
[1:08:30] this coming from
[1:08:32] amen Jesus Works were full fully Beyond
[1:08:35] theirs that they they couldn't touch him
[1:08:37] signs wonders Ministry The Authority by
[1:08:40] which he spake God backed him up time
[1:08:41] and time again and they could do nothing
[1:08:43] because remember what were their Works
[1:08:45] about their Works were all about
[1:08:48] self-righteousness they're trying to
[1:08:50] make themselves good because they obeyed
[1:08:52] the law remember what Jesus said you you
[1:08:54] know you you obey every little bit of
[1:08:56] the law even to the tithing of your mint
[1:08:58] and your cumin you'd have a little piece
[1:09:00] of mint and you take off a tenth of it
[1:09:01] and you bring it to the to the temple as
[1:09:04] a tithe so perfect and so exact and then
[1:09:07] he says you neglect the M weightier
[1:09:09] matters of the law Justice and all these
[1:09:12] different things their Acts were
[1:09:14] self-righteous and what were Jesus Works
[1:09:17] Jesus Works were service Jesus Works to
[1:09:19] set other people free Jesus Works were
[1:09:22] to fulfill all righteousness there's
[1:09:25] what self-righteousness his to was to
[1:09:26] fulfill righteousness what's
[1:09:28] righteousness to do the work of God his
[1:09:31] work was to do what God wanted theirs
[1:09:33] was to do it to promote themselves to
[1:09:35] lift themselves up and so you get to the
[1:09:36] place like the Pharisee that said I'm so
[1:09:38] glad Lord that I am not like this poor
[1:09:41] Publican down
[1:09:47] here we get there
[1:09:53] sometimes but let's not it as something
[1:09:56] that we can't
[1:09:57] overcome Nicodemus wasn't left in the
[1:09:59] Lurch Jesus said Nicodemus you're so
[1:10:01] self-righteous I can't help you no he
[1:10:03] said Nicodemus just be born again and
[1:10:04] it'll do what it's supposed to do amen
[1:10:07] Nicodemus had enough humility to come to
[1:10:09] Jesus and ask about it and that's a
[1:10:11] great starting point is if we can humble
[1:10:13] ourselves and say God I see I need more
[1:10:16] you may have a lot this morning but you
[1:10:19] always need more until we're out of here
[1:10:21] we need more and more and more and more
[1:10:24] and if we we can humble ourselves and
[1:10:26] say God I don't have it all imagine what
[1:10:28] God would do for us this
[1:10:30] morning and I don't believe anybody in
[1:10:33] here would ever say I have it
[1:10:35] all but by our actions we say I have it
[1:10:39] all or I have more than
[1:10:42] you that's the way it happens amen when
[1:10:45] we can't be corrected by somebody else
[1:10:48] when we can't be fed by somebody else
[1:10:50] when we can't be edified by somebody
[1:10:52] else that's when our actions are saying
[1:10:53] I have it all
[1:10:57] amen you know what God does then church
[1:11:01] God just goes over here and he says all
[1:11:02] right then you got it all go ahead do
[1:11:06] your thing that's what he does church
[1:11:08] I'm speaking by experience this morning
[1:11:10] I'm not preaching at you I oh I'm
[1:11:12] preaching by experience this morning God
[1:11:13] sits back and you know what we do is we
[1:11:15] sit over here and we get a critical
[1:11:17] spirit again I'm preaching by experience
[1:11:20] this morning we get a critical spirit
[1:11:22] and what happens eventually is we start
[1:11:24] we finally come to our ourselves and we
[1:11:25] say where did I get
[1:11:28] this where's my sarcasm coming from
[1:11:30] where's my my cynicism coming from why
[1:11:33] am I so negative towards everything
[1:11:35] around me and you know what it is
[1:11:38] self-righteousness has brought us to a
[1:11:40] place where it's just me that's going in
[1:11:43] it's just me can preach it's just me can
[1:11:46] edify it's just me can sing it's just me
[1:11:47] can worship it's just me me me me me we
[1:11:49] become the me
[1:11:50] monster and we get up into a seat of the
[1:11:54] scornful
[1:11:56] I'm preaching by experience amen
[1:11:58] absolutely 100% by experience this
[1:12:00] morning amen the worst thing we can do
[1:12:04] is compare ourselves to somebody else in
[1:12:07] the body of Christ because what we do is
[1:12:09] we use it to boost us up so that we
[1:12:12] don't have to change and we do it to put
[1:12:14] them down to make it feel like we don't
[1:12:16] have to grow and it's not of Christ ever
[1:12:21] amen church I've been corrected and
[1:12:23] edified by children
[1:12:26] yes even my own
[1:12:28] children amen when Sister Mary Beth or
[1:12:33] brother Jensen can raise their hands in
[1:12:36] worship that's
[1:12:37] edifying
[1:12:40] amen I've been corrected and edified by
[1:12:44] God forbid my
[1:12:46] wife
[1:12:48] yeah yeah I've been corrected and
[1:12:50] edified by other
[1:12:51] ministers I've been corrected and
[1:12:54] edified by people that aren't
[1:13:01] Christians so who am I
[1:13:04] then I'm
[1:13:06] nobody I'm nobody I'm nobody I certainly
[1:13:09] don't have it all
[1:13:11] amen but the minute I think that brother
[1:13:14] that sister is not as gifted as I am
[1:13:15] they're not called to as high in
[1:13:17] Ministry they're not as far along in
[1:13:18] their walk look at what they're doing in
[1:13:19] their life they can't help me they can't
[1:13:21] edify they can't even correct me that's
[1:13:23] when I become righteous in my own eyes
[1:13:25] and you know what the Holy Ghost has to
[1:13:26] go sit in the corner cuz I'm all about
[1:13:28] me again can't get anywhere with God
[1:13:31] like that amen a prideful heart will
[1:13:33] never do
[1:13:35] this Jesus said to Nicodemus Nicodemus
[1:13:38] says how's this going to happen he says
[1:13:39] verily verily I say unto thee we speak
[1:13:42] that we do know and testify that we have
[1:13:44] seen and ye receive not our witness
[1:13:46] Jesus says I'm telling you what I know I
[1:13:48] know this by personal experience I'm
[1:13:50] telling you because I've seen it I'm
[1:13:51] telling you because I've experienced it
[1:13:53] he says and if you can't receive
[1:13:55] that he says if I've told you Earthly
[1:13:58] things and you believe not how shall you
[1:13:59] believe if I tell you Heavenly things
[1:14:02] Jesus says my gospel's
[1:14:03] reality I'm not talking about things I
[1:14:06] don't know about I'm talking about
[1:14:07] things I do know about and if you can't
[1:14:09] accept it down here how are you going to
[1:14:11] accept what I've got waiting for you up
[1:14:12] there there's got to be something
[1:14:14] happens in the land of the living the
[1:14:16] the scripture says talks about the
[1:14:18] blessings of God in the land of living
[1:14:20] the working of God the reality of God in
[1:14:21] the land of the living before we ever
[1:14:23] get up there into the land of eternal
[1:14:24] life there's a reality that the gospel
[1:14:27] that that has to happen here amen Jesus
[1:14:29] is saying if you can't accept my Earthly
[1:14:30] Ministry how are you going to get to
[1:14:31] your Earth your heavenly inheritance
[1:14:33] it's going to happen here before it
[1:14:35] happens over
[1:14:36] there you know I think it's a great
[1:14:38] failing we have even within this message
[1:14:40] is we have a great amount of knowledge
[1:14:42] and because we know it we think we have
[1:14:45] it we know so much we know so much the
[1:14:49] book is open the book is open the seals
[1:14:52] are opened it's a brand new book and and
[1:14:55] we can sit there and we can understand
[1:14:57] things that people wonder about we have
[1:14:59] authority in the word and we think
[1:15:01] because we know it we have the reality
[1:15:04] of it and that's not necessarily true it
[1:15:05] may be true but it's not necessarily
[1:15:07] true because knowledge won't do it if we
[1:15:09] don't have faith to put it into action
[1:15:11] knowledge won't do it if we don't have
[1:15:13] wisdom to apply it amen knowledge won't
[1:15:16] change US unless we've got the spirit of
[1:15:18] God to Quicken it inside of us because
[1:15:20] otherwise we're just going to know the
[1:15:22] word rather than become the word and
[1:15:24] it's just a mental thing rather than a
[1:15:26] living thing amen we can rest on The
[1:15:28] Laurels of our understanding and God's
[1:15:30] sitting there saying if you'd only
[1:15:31] compare your life to your understanding
[1:15:33] you'd see there's so much more available
[1:15:36] amen you ever run into somebody that can
[1:15:39] talk about the word all day
[1:15:42] long and yet they have no overcoming
[1:15:44] power in their life what is it they're
[1:15:47] caught up in the knowledge of the word
[1:15:49] without the reality of the word
[1:15:50] quickened by the
[1:15:52] spirit nothing wrong with having that
[1:15:55] but you got to move on from it amen the
[1:15:58] purpose of a mystery is to be revealed
[1:16:01] here not
[1:16:03] here we're the mystery revealing of
[1:16:06] Christ in this age it's not about
[1:16:08] talking about it it's about being it he
[1:16:10] doesn't want us to to just to to to just
[1:16:13] teach the word or or preach the word
[1:16:14] over a Pulpit he wants us to live it
[1:16:16] that's what preaching is is to speak and
[1:16:18] live what you're talking about
[1:16:21] amen so Jesus says you got to be born
[1:16:23] again Nicodemus so the question is what
[1:16:25] does it mean what is the new birth how
[1:16:26] are we born again is it a prayer we say
[1:16:30] is it an altar call is it attending a
[1:16:32] particular church is it a particular
[1:16:34] Ministry is it signing your name to a
[1:16:35] book is it a certain baptism is it a
[1:16:38] certain robe you have to wear is it a
[1:16:41] certain sign is it speaking in tongues
[1:16:42] what is it what's the new
[1:16:45] birth well Peter tells us how we get it
[1:16:49] he says for as much as you know that you
[1:16:51] were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:16:53] things as silver and gold from your vain
[1:16:56] conversation received by tradition from
[1:16:58] your fathers he's talking to the Jews
[1:17:01] now Peter was a messenger to the
[1:17:04] Jews they have the full word as they
[1:17:07] know it and he says it was vain
[1:17:10] tradition your conversation he says the
[1:17:12] life you have is vain tradition it will
[1:17:15] not do the job you got to move on from
[1:17:18] it he says but with the precious we were
[1:17:21] bought with the precious blood of Christ
[1:17:23] as of a land without blemish and spot
[1:17:26] amen the blood is our Redemption it pays
[1:17:29] the price and it gives us an opportunity
[1:17:31] to stand in the presence of God to
[1:17:33] return to our original position to
[1:17:35] return to our original inheritance he
[1:17:37] says who verily was for ordained before
[1:17:39] the foundation of the world but was
[1:17:41] manifest in these last times for
[1:17:45] you who by him do believe in God that
[1:17:48] raised him up from the dead and gave him
[1:17:50] glory that your Faith and Hope might be
[1:17:52] in God he says seeing ye have purified
[1:17:54] ified your souls in obeying the truth
[1:17:57] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:17:59] of the Brethren see that you love one
[1:18:01] another with a pure heart fervently
[1:18:03] Jesus said by this shall all men know
[1:18:05] your my disciples by your love one for
[1:18:08] another but catch this now Peter tells
[1:18:11] us how we're born
[1:18:13] again being born again not of
[1:18:16] corruptible seed what's corruptible seed
[1:18:19] Mom and Dad genetic traits family
[1:18:23] heritage
[1:18:26] that's not going to save you because
[1:18:28] remember what what Paul said of himself
[1:18:30] he says when he was Saul he says I was
[1:18:32] of the stock of benjin I was a Pharisee
[1:18:34] among I was of the of the sect of the
[1:18:35] Pharisees I was the best of the best and
[1:18:38] what did that lead him to
[1:18:40] Antichrist he persecuted the true church
[1:18:43] he says so we're not born again of
[1:18:44] corruptible seed of the natural seed
[1:18:46] from Mom and Dad he says but we are born
[1:18:48] of
[1:18:49] Incorruptible by the word of God he says
[1:18:53] which liveth and ab it forever The
[1:18:55] Incorruptible seed is the seed Gene of
[1:18:58] God that he's placed inside your heart
[1:19:00] by predestination by
[1:19:02] election and it's the word that brings
[1:19:04] it to life he says for All Flesh is as
[1:19:06] grass and the glory of man is the flower
[1:19:08] of grass the grass withers and the
[1:19:11] flower thereof fth away in other words
[1:19:12] he says this corruptible thing you have
[1:19:14] this natural thing you have as good as
[1:19:16] it might look at times it's going to
[1:19:18] fail and it's going to fall and it's
[1:19:20] going to die he says but the word of the
[1:19:22] Lord lasts how long it endureth forever
[1:19:26] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:19:29] is preached unto you so what is it that
[1:19:31] brings about the New Birth
[1:19:33] Church it's the word of God Amen it
[1:19:36] starts with the word of God it's the
[1:19:38] thoughts of God as as David said in the
[1:19:40] Psalms it's the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:19:43] there's something in you that responds
[1:19:45] to God and you cannot respond to God
[1:19:48] unless there's something in you to
[1:19:49] respond to amen Jesus said no man can
[1:19:52] come to me except the father draws him
[1:19:54] first there's something placed inside of
[1:19:56] us and what is it it's the word of God
[1:19:59] that's meant for
[1:20:00] you it's the thoughts of God about you
[1:20:03] it's the things that God thought about
[1:20:04] you before the world began and what
[1:20:06] happens is as the word comes your way
[1:20:09] you catch a hold of it and it it brings
[1:20:11] a light to you and something comes alive
[1:20:13] and you say hey that's me and you may
[1:20:16] have had no
[1:20:17] clue that that was you ever
[1:20:21] before like we said last service and may
[1:20:23] be reading a newspaper
[1:20:26] ad am man it might be uh the preaching
[1:20:29] of the word it might be you know uh my
[1:20:32] my
[1:20:34] father-in-law he was crossing the border
[1:20:36] from Mexico to the United States
[1:20:38] illegally and found a tracked a message
[1:20:42] tracked and that changed his life
[1:20:45] forever what is it it's the word of God
[1:20:47] coming your way amen and what happens is
[1:20:51] the holy spirit now comes behind that
[1:20:53] and when you receive it it quickens it
[1:20:55] and it brings it to life and now there's
[1:20:57] a new life that Springs up and that's a
[1:20:59] new birth because it's a spiritual birth
[1:21:01] it's not a natural birth you can't be
[1:21:04] born again outside of the word of God
[1:21:06] because it takes the word to let you
[1:21:08] know who you are you're just recognizing
[1:21:12] yourself it's like that story of of the
[1:21:14] farmer that took the chicken egg and put
[1:21:16] it under a Chicken and the Egg and the
[1:21:18] mother hand hatched it and he's out in
[1:21:20] the chicken yard and he's trying to live
[1:21:23] like a chicken and guess what when they
[1:21:25] are thriving an eagle is not thriving
[1:21:28] living on chicken food it's meant to eat
[1:21:30] fresh meat it's not meant to pick at
[1:21:33] worms and Grasshoppers and eat grain and
[1:21:35] these things it's meant to have the
[1:21:37] fresh kill of the word and so the eagle
[1:21:39] is there and yes it's growing a little
[1:21:41] bit but it's not maturing the way it's
[1:21:43] supposed to and then one day what
[1:21:44] happens Mama eagle flies over and she
[1:21:47] screams at Eagle scream and that eagle
[1:21:49] says that sounds like me I don't cluck
[1:21:52] like a chicken I scream like whatever
[1:21:54] that is what is it and it looks up and
[1:21:56] it sees this thing and all the chickens
[1:21:57] are running for their life because
[1:21:59] that's death to them but it's life to
[1:22:02] that eagle and he says is that you mama
[1:22:04] and she says that's me he says how do I
[1:22:06] get up there she says just start
[1:22:07] flapping your wings and he responds it's
[1:22:11] a deep calling to the Deep he knows now
[1:22:13] who he is and he may jump up on that
[1:22:15] chicken coop and flap his wings and he
[1:22:17] goes and he die bombs and he crashes but
[1:22:20] he knows because he can see her that
[1:22:22] there's a day where he's going to fly
[1:22:24] and what does he do he's using his
[1:22:26] strength to start to fly and he's
[1:22:28] getting better and better and then one
[1:22:29] day he just takes off and he Soares into
[1:22:30] the skies and he can't live on chicken
[1:22:32] food
[1:22:33] anymore amen there's something inside
[1:22:35] him that responded it's so simple Church
[1:22:38] you can't explain to somebody how you're
[1:22:40] born again all you can say is this is
[1:22:41] what happened to
[1:22:43] me you can go to church a long time but
[1:22:45] that's not the new
[1:22:47] birth you can sit under signs and
[1:22:49] wonders but that's not the new birth you
[1:22:51] can sit under the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost but that is not the new
[1:22:57] birth it takes the pure word to come and
[1:23:02] Quicken you so that you can live as
[1:23:04] Christ lived amen it takes the ordained
[1:23:06] word for your age and your season to
[1:23:09] cause you to come to spiritual life and
[1:23:11] then you have a spiritual birth and now
[1:23:14] you recognize I am a child of God Amen
[1:23:17] that's the Trap that Pentecost has laid
[1:23:19] for people is that they're relying on
[1:23:20] the new birth based on an experience or
[1:23:22] based on a gift of speaking into tongues
[1:23:24] rather than a life that's changed listen
[1:23:27] how easy is it to speak in
[1:23:32] Tong Paul said do all speak in
[1:23:35] tongues do all have healing are all
[1:23:38] ministers he said no they're not and yet
[1:23:41] they use it as an Evidence the easiest
[1:23:43] thing in the world would be to come into
[1:23:44] church and speak in tongues speak in
[1:23:47] tongues some are doing the real thing
[1:23:49] some are faking it but that just means
[1:23:52] I've got to come to church once a week
[1:23:54] and really all I have to do is speak in
[1:23:55] tongues once and I've got the new birth
[1:23:57] are you kidding
[1:23:59] me that's not what Christ
[1:24:03] did no it's a life changed it's a word
[1:24:07] accepted and living out of you that's
[1:24:09] the proof that you got the Holy Ghost
[1:24:10] easiest thing in the world is to come
[1:24:11] into church and speak in tongues once
[1:24:14] amen but Satan can mimic every
[1:24:18] gift that is in the church he can mimic
[1:24:21] it and so you can't rely on something
[1:24:24] can be mimicked you can't rely on
[1:24:26] something that the scripture says is
[1:24:28] without repentance gifts and callings
[1:24:30] are without repentance that is not where
[1:24:31] our hope is God wants people that can
[1:24:34] live the word when they're outside of
[1:24:35] church not just do something inside of
[1:24:37] church anyone can do it inside a church
[1:24:40] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:24:42] unjust when the spirit of God is in the
[1:24:43] building then anything can happen to
[1:24:46] anyone Saul prophesied in the days of
[1:24:49] David but he wasn't a prophet was he
[1:24:52] when he got in the atmosphere he did
[1:24:54] that and then what did he do he went out
[1:24:55] and he tried to kill
[1:24:58] David that's an anointing on you not an
[1:25:00] anointing in
[1:25:01] you that's a presence around you rather
[1:25:03] than the indwelling presence of Jesus
[1:25:05] Christ
[1:25:07] amen God wants people that will live by
[1:25:09] the spirit to bring the word to life
[1:25:11] every day not just come to church and do
[1:25:13] something and then walk out the door and
[1:25:14] nothing's changed amen we'll get into
[1:25:16] the evidence of the Holy Spirit later as
[1:25:18] we get into this series amen but I'm
[1:25:20] trying to set the standard early that
[1:25:22] the evidence is known by your life
[1:25:25] by the acceptance of the word in a way
[1:25:27] that makes it live not by gifts it's not
[1:25:30] about gifts being shown it's about a
[1:25:31] life being lived that's always what it
[1:25:33] is Jesus said by your fruits you shall
[1:25:35] know them not by your GI their gifts you
[1:25:36] shall know them Jesus never mentioned
[1:25:38] that by your fruits amen the only thing
[1:25:42] Satan can't reproduce is the word of God
[1:25:43] living in a human being because
[1:25:46] eventually what happens is the fruits
[1:25:47] will come through because he's not the
[1:25:49] author of Life he's the author of death
[1:25:51] and so it's going to die but it's the
[1:25:54] word that abides forever and ever and it
[1:25:56] say scripture says that he'll you'll be
[1:25:58] like a tree that's planted by the water
[1:25:59] and you'll bring forth fruit in her
[1:26:01] season in his season and it just stays
[1:26:04] and it's always there and it never
[1:26:06] changes but with Satan it always dies
[1:26:08] away and you see that we've known people
[1:26:10] that have served the Lord for 20 30 40
[1:26:12] years in some cases and then they fall
[1:26:13] away why because Satan cannot produce
[1:26:16] the word of God in a human body it falls
[1:26:19] away eventually the fruit comes
[1:26:21] out but he can mimic and copy every gift
[1:26:24] he can produce a counterfeit for
[1:26:25] everything that's in the church
[1:26:27] absolutely 100% scripture says he's
[1:26:30] sitting in the temple being worshiped as
[1:26:33] God that's how close he is into religion
[1:26:35] he's in the middle of it he says your
[1:26:38] birth has to be changed in other words
[1:26:40] your natural birth you've been deceived
[1:26:42] you might have spoken in tongues you
[1:26:43] might have jumped up and down you might
[1:26:45] have shouted you might have done all of
[1:26:46] this that the other you might have been
[1:26:48] a loyal members so was Nicodemus see but
[1:26:50] he lacked the birth and when you deny
[1:26:53] the word try to place it somewhere else
[1:26:55] and do something to it and Scatter it
[1:26:56] away like that he says Jesus said these
[1:26:59] signs shall follow them that believe go
[1:27:01] you into all the world and preach the
[1:27:03] gospel to Every Creature he says as long
[1:27:06] as the gospel is being preached these
[1:27:07] signs shall follow tell me the place
[1:27:10] where he ever took it away from the
[1:27:12] church show me the scripture where he
[1:27:14] ever ever where he said he ever said
[1:27:16] just for so long he said unto all the
[1:27:18] world and to Every Creature he says yes
[1:27:21] you'd have to receive the kind of life
[1:27:23] he had
[1:27:24] in order to live his life he says but
[1:27:28] catch this and when you see his life
[1:27:32] then you will know his word amen there's
[1:27:36] your proof right there he says that's
[1:27:38] right when he the personal pronoun not a
[1:27:42] thought not an imagination not a
[1:27:44] sensation but when he the Holy Ghost has
[1:27:46] come he will take these things I've told
[1:27:48] you reveal them to you and will show you
[1:27:51] things that are to come he says that's
[1:27:53] the birth that's the Vindication that it
[1:27:56] is word when a man says he's got the
[1:27:59] Holy Ghost and denies the word of God
[1:28:01] and places it somewhere else how can the
[1:28:03] Holy Ghost deny his own word you can't
[1:28:05] do it you can't do it they have this
[1:28:07] doctrine of of the Apostles being the
[1:28:10] only ones that had the Holy Ghost in
[1:28:11] power and
[1:28:14] authority and yet you see all sorts of
[1:28:17] men going out around and doing things
[1:28:18] that weren't Apostles Steven was not an
[1:28:22] apostle signs and one ERS followed
[1:28:25] him right the Holy Ghost is power amen
[1:28:30] that's what we're looking for is the
[1:28:31] power to make us live a life and signs
[1:28:33] and wonders follow behind those sorts of
[1:28:35] things but you cannot say I have the
[1:28:36] Holy Ghost and I'm denying the word
[1:28:39] doesn't work because it's Denine itself
[1:28:40] we'll see this as we go on the
[1:28:42] scriptures Paul said where is the wise
[1:28:45] where is the Scribe where is the
[1:28:47] disputer of this world all these people
[1:28:50] that are trying to disprove trying to
[1:28:53] diminish
[1:28:55] and they're not just in the world
[1:28:56] they're in the Christian church as well
[1:28:58] sometimes the greatest DET detriment we
[1:29:00] have are the people inside of the
[1:29:02] Christian world it's because they're
[1:29:03] taking the power out of the
[1:29:05] word so that all you do is you just sit
[1:29:08] there like a lump and you never
[1:29:10] change you're back into legalism you're
[1:29:12] just doing with the Pharisees trying to
[1:29:13] live a good life that's not what Christ
[1:29:15] came to do he came to set us free
[1:29:18] amen he says for after that in the
[1:29:20] wisdom of God by the world the wisdom
[1:29:22] knew not God
[1:29:25] it pleased God by the foolishness of
[1:29:27] preaching to save them that believe what
[1:29:30] I'm doing here today is
[1:29:33] foolishness it is it's foolishness how
[1:29:37] in the world or why in the world would
[1:29:38] God
[1:29:39] use an imperfect
[1:29:42] man to do a perfect work because you
[1:29:45] look in Ephesians we're supposed to do a
[1:29:47] work that unifies and perfects the body
[1:29:49] and it's by the foolishness of preaching
[1:29:51] that a five-fold Ministry brings the
[1:29:52] bride to perfection
[1:29:55] he says it's foolishness to save them
[1:29:57] that believe the world will look at this
[1:29:59] and say foolish and then what do they do
[1:30:02] they'll listen to Media they'll listen
[1:30:04] to their favorite influencer they'll
[1:30:05] listen to their favorite sports caster
[1:30:07] more Faithfully than we
[1:30:09] do and yet we're foolish and they're
[1:30:12] not makes no
[1:30:14] sense they're drawn to what they like
[1:30:17] we're drawn to what we like
[1:30:20] amen he says for the Jews require a sign
[1:30:22] and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we
[1:30:25] preach Christ crucified under the Jews a
[1:30:28] stumbling block and under the Greeks
[1:30:29] foolishness in other words the preaching
[1:30:31] of the gospel of Christ it stumbles the
[1:30:34] vast majority of the group it's
[1:30:36] foolishness to one and it stumbles the
[1:30:37] other Jews couldn't get past it and the
[1:30:39] Greek said this isn't
[1:30:41] wisdom this isn't intelligent enough we
[1:30:45] know more than this gospel you brought
[1:30:47] but he says but unto them which are
[1:30:52] called he says but Jews and Greeks
[1:30:55] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[1:30:57] of God he says the foolish the the
[1:30:58] foolishness of preaching is what it's
[1:31:01] the power of God and the wisdom of God
[1:31:03] so the Jews and the Greeks rejected it
[1:31:05] but Greek SE means the Gentiles that's
[1:31:07] us but inside of each of those groups
[1:31:10] there's what there's a little elect
[1:31:12] group that will hear it and they'll
[1:31:15] receive it and it'll do exactly what
[1:31:17] it's supposed to do what's the
[1:31:19] difference one has the seed of God
[1:31:20] inside of them and the rest don't that's
[1:31:23] the unfortunate truth amen that's the
[1:31:25] only difference it's not a choice I make
[1:31:26] it's not a choice you make it's a choice
[1:31:28] God made before the foundation of the
[1:31:29] world that my name was written in the
[1:31:31] Lamb's Book of Life and that's why I can
[1:31:33] receive the word amen and so what
[1:31:35] happens is the word comes to the word
[1:31:37] the word comes to produce what it sent
[1:31:38] out and it was a seed of God that he put
[1:31:41] cast out into the world and now he's
[1:31:42] coming to bring it back to him he's not
[1:31:44] coming for me he's not coming for this
[1:31:47] he's coming for the word inside of me
[1:31:48] amen and that's a soul issue not a flesh
[1:31:51] issue that's why this flesh has to be
[1:31:52] changed it has to beor
[1:31:54] glorified he says because the
[1:31:56] foolishness of God is wiser than men and
[1:31:59] the weakness of God is stronger than men
[1:32:01] church we live our lives by the word and
[1:32:03] we consider it the wisdom of God and yet
[1:32:05] the world is out there you know I I saw
[1:32:07] this hilarious article so um we had
[1:32:11] helicopter
[1:32:12] parenting remember where you were all
[1:32:14] over your kids and you were into
[1:32:15] everything and and then you had the the
[1:32:17] one where you kind of stand off and each
[1:32:20] was the wisdom of their
[1:32:22] day and now there's saying that was all
[1:32:24] wrong now we need a
[1:32:27] balance whoa can you imagine we need a
[1:32:30] balance we need to be close but not too
[1:32:32] close we need to stay away but not too
[1:32:34] far away it's the wisdom of man and you
[1:32:37] know what we were doing all along Church
[1:32:38] by the word staying in balance and you
[1:32:41] know what it
[1:32:42] produces good citizens what they've been
[1:32:45] trying to do all along by a simple
[1:32:47] reading of the scriptures we produce and
[1:32:50] that has nothing to do with the Holy
[1:32:51] Ghost that's just basic principle of how
[1:32:54] to raise your children right and it
[1:32:56] produces good citizens and the world is
[1:32:57] out there saying how do we do this and
[1:32:59] we've got psychologists and
[1:33:00] psychiatrists and Educators and all
[1:33:01] these things saying well how about we
[1:33:03] try this and how about we try this and
[1:33:04] let's do away with this and let's add in
[1:33:06] this and we definitely won't do this
[1:33:07] anymore and they're doing the same thing
[1:33:09] with their health aren't they this
[1:33:10] food's no good that food's no good don't
[1:33:12] do this don't do that and you know what
[1:33:14] they've realized now you can do anything
[1:33:16] you want it's genetics that'll determine
[1:33:17] whether you're healthy or not most
[1:33:19] times you don't get cancer because of
[1:33:22] what you eat you get cancer because of
[1:33:23] your genetics they say now they could be
[1:33:25] wrong who knows they keep getting it
[1:33:27] wrong but remember you couldn't have fat
[1:33:29] now they're saying no you got to eat fat
[1:33:31] oh you can't have eggs now you got to
[1:33:32] eat eggs can't eat milk now you
[1:33:33] definitely have to have milk don't ever
[1:33:36] eat wheat no you better have wheat it's
[1:33:37] got an essential no they have no clue
[1:33:39] Church what it's the wisdom of men is
[1:33:43] foolishness it has no Foundation they're
[1:33:45] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:33:46] the truth that's not just a spiritual
[1:33:48] thing it's a natural thing as
[1:33:51] well but it interesting as I was
[1:33:54] studying this and I I heard someone
[1:33:56] mention I was trying to remember who was
[1:33:57] who was it might have been a preacher
[1:33:58] that I was listening to or or something
[1:34:00] they they they they read this
[1:34:02] quote and I thought it was a good thing
[1:34:04] to bring to us because we're talking
[1:34:05] about the new birth and the leading of
[1:34:07] the Holy Spirit and and the foolishness
[1:34:09] of preaching now and brother bram's here
[1:34:12] and he he's talking about his first
[1:34:14] service now remember he's an ordained
[1:34:16] Prophet he's a seven Church AE
[1:34:18] messenger he's the angel of Revelation
[1:34:21] 10:7 and I want you to hear
[1:34:24] the report of his first
[1:34:26] service he says I remember the first
[1:34:28] sermon I preached I got up there and
[1:34:30] thought I did really well and all of the
[1:34:32] old ladies sat around and they cried a
[1:34:34] little bit you know and said oh what a
[1:34:36] wonderful boy the old Pastor Dr Davis
[1:34:39] was an old lawyer I went down and he
[1:34:41] said I want to see you down at the house
[1:34:42] I said all right I walked in next day
[1:34:45] you know all swelled out I said how did
[1:34:46] I do Dr Davis he said the rotness I ever
[1:34:50] heard
[1:34:54] deflated him like a Bo
[1:34:56] balloon I said what he said the worst I
[1:34:59] ever heard oh I said Brother Davis
[1:35:03] everybody was
[1:35:06] crying can I add
[1:35:09] something what if he said everyone was
[1:35:12] shouting everyone was dancing everyone
[1:35:15] was hollering nobody would stay seated
[1:35:17] everyone was clapping I could barely
[1:35:19] preach because of the response of the
[1:35:21] people we'd say there's Revival in the
[1:35:23] church
[1:35:24] I'm not saying that's not Revival church
[1:35:26] I'm saying that's not the
[1:35:30] proof amen everybody was crying he said
[1:35:34] yes they cry at funerals they cry at
[1:35:36] births everything else he says what it
[1:35:39] is Billy you never quoted one bit of
[1:35:42] God's
[1:35:43] word prophet of
[1:35:45] God he says you talked about some mother
[1:35:48] that had dung gone on or something like
[1:35:50] this and got everybody to cry said
[1:35:52] you're not born again of things and
[1:35:55] Sensations upon things and sensations of
[1:35:58] this Earth you're born by the
[1:36:01] word he says oh you cut he cut the wind
[1:36:04] right out of me and I'm glad he did see
[1:36:07] not jumping up and down hollering that
[1:36:09] isn't it it's not wrong church if we
[1:36:11] don't have some life in us there's
[1:36:13] something wrong come on let's preach it
[1:36:15] in Balance here I'm not going to throw
[1:36:16] it all out I'd love a jump and holler in
[1:36:19] church but we got to be who we are I
[1:36:22] like what brother Aon ogles be said he
[1:36:23] says you better have something behind
[1:36:25] the hooping and hollering and jumping
[1:36:26] and running around know why you're doing
[1:36:28] it but let's never suppress it let's
[1:36:31] never suppress it he says it's not that
[1:36:35] it's the word that makes alive the words
[1:36:39] quickened he says it's not experiences
[1:36:42] it's the
[1:36:43] word experiences follow the
[1:36:46] word but you've got to receive it Jesus
[1:36:50] spent three and a half years with his
[1:36:52] disciples
[1:36:53] preparing them for the new birth they
[1:36:55] got trained and they got tested and they
[1:36:57] failed and they let them down and they
[1:36:58] did all sorts of things but God was in
[1:37:00] it and God was doing a beautiful work
[1:37:02] with them and when it all came down to
[1:37:04] The Showdown what was The Showdown
[1:37:06] church was The Showdown signs and
[1:37:11] wonders what was it before Christ is
[1:37:14] crucified what was it that held Peter
[1:37:16] and the disciples was it the signs and
[1:37:19] wonders was it the walking on the water
[1:37:21] was it raising the dead was it it
[1:37:23] Healing The Sick was it putting the
[1:37:25] storm out of
[1:37:29] existence that wasn't it remember what
[1:37:32] Jesus said we preached on this recently
[1:37:33] he said unless you eat or he says if you
[1:37:36] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[1:37:38] eternal life and that sounds horrible to
[1:37:40] us without Revelation it sounds horrible
[1:37:42] it sounds anti-rip even and he never
[1:37:45] explained it and then at the Last Supper
[1:37:46] he comes and he explains it a bit and he
[1:37:48] says he says I am the bread of life and
[1:37:50] he says when you eat my flesh and drink
[1:37:52] my blood then you have it he says but
[1:37:55] what was Jesus he was the
[1:37:58] word John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[1:38:00] word the word was and the Word was with
[1:38:02] God the Word was God and the Word was
[1:38:04] made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus was
[1:38:06] the word what was he saying you got to
[1:38:08] eat the word you got to drink the word
[1:38:10] you've got to take the word you've got
[1:38:11] to take all of it not just a bit of it
[1:38:14] you've got to take the whole thing not
[1:38:16] just the part that looks good tastes
[1:38:17] good feels good you got to take all of
[1:38:19] this word and that will produce the word
[1:38:22] inside of you that's what you got to do
[1:38:24] amen he was saying consume the word and
[1:38:26] when you consume the word it'll become
[1:38:28] the word inside of you but at that point
[1:38:31] in time Jesus had preached a tough
[1:38:32] service and it was unexplained and it
[1:38:35] really threw his disciples for a loop
[1:38:37] now remember they had cast out Devils
[1:38:39] they' healed the sick they'd raised the
[1:38:40] dead not just the 12 but the 70 plus the
[1:38:44] 12 there's 82 of them there that have
[1:38:46] done all these signs and wonders but
[1:38:49] Church did you ever notice something the
[1:38:51] 12 disciples were called by
[1:38:54] name he chose
[1:38:57] them but the other 70 he did not choose
[1:39:00] they felt to call they came of their own
[1:39:04] accord not of his he didn't call them by
[1:39:07] name the 12 he called by name 11
[1:39:10] predestinated to life one because he
[1:39:12] needed a traitor and he picked that
[1:39:15] traitor amen but the 70 they were not
[1:39:19] chosen they felt something they felt the
[1:39:21] pull of the Gospel but there was
[1:39:23] something lacking inside of them and we
[1:39:24] see where the Showdown happens and it is
[1:39:26] not over signs and
[1:39:27] wonders it's not over good feelings it's
[1:39:30] not over Revival experiences watch the
[1:39:32] separating line now Church watch the
[1:39:34] difference between a religious
[1:39:35] experience and those that are coming to
[1:39:37] a new birth so Jesus preaches that that
[1:39:40] that famous sermon unless you eat my
[1:39:42] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:39:43] part of me these things it says now many
[1:39:46] therefore of his disciples when they
[1:39:47] heard this said this is a hard saying
[1:39:49] who can hear it who can understand it
[1:39:51] who can receive this' and when Jesus
[1:39:54] knew in himself that his disciples
[1:39:55] murmured at it he said unto them does
[1:39:57] this offend
[1:39:58] you there's a reproach that comes with
[1:40:01] believing this
[1:40:02] message he says what and if ye shall see
[1:40:06] the son of man Ascend where he was
[1:40:09] before he says it is the spirit that
[1:40:13] quickens now watch this carefully church
[1:40:15] this is where so many miss it because
[1:40:17] they say the spirit's moving the holy
[1:40:19] spirit's acting we've got it but that's
[1:40:21] not how Jesus preaches what the spirit
[1:40:23] is
[1:40:24] he says the spirit quickens in other
[1:40:26] words the spirit brings to life it gives
[1:40:29] life and it keeps it alive it keeps it
[1:40:33] alive because remember the parable of
[1:40:35] the S there's some things that died they
[1:40:37] started to life but they died why
[1:40:40] because there wasn't a ground prepared
[1:40:42] but when the spirit brings something
[1:40:43] truly to life it is alive forever
[1:40:45] because the word abides forever it's an
[1:40:47] eternal spirit of God Amen so he says
[1:40:51] it's the spirit that quickeneth he says
[1:40:53] the the flesh profiteth nothing so we
[1:40:57] can't brag on it it adds nothing to this
[1:41:00] it brings nothing to life all this flesh
[1:41:03] has in it is death Paul said in this
[1:41:05] flesh dwells no good thing so let's not
[1:41:07] talk about it let's not brag on it I got
[1:41:09] what you don't have no no no that's the
[1:41:11] flesh it has nothing to do with this he
[1:41:14] says the words remember he says it's
[1:41:17] it's the spirit that quickens he says
[1:41:19] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:41:22] Spirit
[1:41:24] and they are life it's the words that I
[1:41:27] speak there spirit and life I thought it
[1:41:29] was the Holy Spirit that quickens I
[1:41:30] thought it was the spirit of God that
[1:41:31] quickens it is and it does how by the
[1:41:34] word because what is the word the spirit
[1:41:37] of God brings the word and when the
[1:41:39] spirit of and when the word is accepted
[1:41:41] the spirit of God brings it to a reality
[1:41:43] in your body in your life in your mind
[1:41:45] in your soul and it produces itself all
[1:41:48] over again and it's a total working of
[1:41:49] the holy spirit amen the spirit of God
[1:41:53] thought it the spirit of God spoke it
[1:41:55] the spirit of God wrote it and then God
[1:41:58] dwells in the word the spirit of God
[1:41:59] dwells in the word and so that's what
[1:42:01] makes it a living word is that the
[1:42:03] spirit of God is in it amen it's laying
[1:42:06] there waiting for somebody to take it
[1:42:08] waiting for somebody to receive it in
[1:42:09] faith and as soon as they do it comes to
[1:42:12] life and it becomes a reality in our
[1:42:14] lives by the holy spirit amen it's like
[1:42:17] Jesus said in the in the parable of the
[1:42:19] of the seeds in the sewer there's a
[1:42:21] fertile ground that will receive it
[1:42:23] there's a lot of books we can read but
[1:42:25] this is the greatest book you can read
[1:42:26] because it's the only one that has life
[1:42:28] inside of it there's a lot of things you
[1:42:30] can read self-help and this and that for
[1:42:33] dummies but this is the only one that
[1:42:36] has potential life in it amen many are
[1:42:40] called few are chosen but it's the
[1:42:42] chosen that read this and it brings them
[1:42:44] to life amen they don't just respond to
[1:42:47] it see lots of people will surr will
[1:42:49] respond to it they'll come to the altar
[1:42:51] they'll they'll have a a tearful moment
[1:42:53] something but how many will surrender to
[1:42:55] it let it have the the full preeminence
[1:42:58] in their life and let it live through
[1:42:59] them and and produce the word of God by
[1:43:02] the power of the Holy
[1:43:04] Ghost so he says the the flesh profits
[1:43:06] nothing but the words I speak unto you
[1:43:08] their Spirit their life remember our
[1:43:10] Birth has to be by the word because the
[1:43:12] words are spirit and life he says but
[1:43:14] there are some of you that believe not
[1:43:17] in other words there are make Believers
[1:43:19] with signs and
[1:43:20] wonders that aren't real believers
[1:43:24] they thought they were they thought they
[1:43:26] were they're not make Believers because
[1:43:28] they're they're insincere they're make
[1:43:30] Believers in total
[1:43:33] sincerity they didn't realize it signs
[1:43:36] and wonders following they raised the
[1:43:38] dead they healed the sick they cast out
[1:43:39] demons they preached the Gospel of Jesus
[1:43:42] Christ and yet they are make
[1:43:44] Believers he says there are some of you
[1:43:46] that believe not for Jesus knew from the
[1:43:49] beginning who they were that believe not
[1:43:51] and who should betray him and yet he
[1:43:53] gave them
[1:43:54] power go tell me how that works
[1:43:57] Church why because there's got to be a
[1:43:59] different separating line than the
[1:44:01] moving of the spirit and the signs and
[1:44:03] wonders and the gifts and it's always
[1:44:06] the word it's always the
[1:44:09] word he said therefore I said unto you
[1:44:11] that no man can come unto me except it
[1:44:14] were given unto him of the father that's
[1:44:16] the election and predestination of God
[1:44:18] and from that time many of his disciples
[1:44:21] went back what did they do Church they
[1:44:24] backslid what's
[1:44:26] backsliding oh I I went and I watched
[1:44:28] something I shouldn't I listened to
[1:44:29] music I drank I smoked no they went back
[1:44:32] to the old
[1:44:33] word that's
[1:44:35] it he says and walk no more with him
[1:44:39] then Jesus said unto the TW will you
[1:44:41] also go away then Simon Peter Peter
[1:44:44] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[1:44:47] thou Hast the great signs and wonders of
[1:44:49] eternal
[1:44:50] life no thou pass the words of eternal
[1:44:56] life he says and we believe and are sure
[1:44:59] that thou art that Christ the son of the
[1:45:00] Living God what was Peter holding on to
[1:45:02] church was he holding on to his walking
[1:45:04] on water experience of the the storm
[1:45:06] being being spoken out of existence was
[1:45:09] he he dwelling on the the raising of the
[1:45:11] Widow's son of the multiplication of the
[1:45:14] food for the 4,000 and the 5,000 no
[1:45:17] Peter was resting on the word his Anchor
[1:45:21] Point in Jesus was that he spoke the
[1:45:23] words of life and then the signs
[1:45:26] followed those things
[1:45:28] amen he was convinced by what he said
[1:45:31] first and by what he did
[1:45:33] second that's his Anchor Point amen the
[1:45:36] new birth is not just the hearing of the
[1:45:38] word it's the receiving of the word into
[1:45:41] a heart of faith and you obey it by
[1:45:43] faith and the spirit of God quickens it
[1:45:45] and makes it alive in you that's what
[1:45:46] the new birth is the new birth is when
[1:45:48] the word of God Is Made Alive In You by
[1:45:50] the Holy Ghost and you produce the same
[1:45:52] life that Christ did that's what the new
[1:45:54] birth is because I live you shall live
[1:45:57] also the things I do I live I Do by the
[1:45:59] spirit of Christ that's in me it's the
[1:46:01] same life it's the same spirit it's got
[1:46:02] to produce the same thing what do you do
[1:46:04] when you have the new birth you become a
[1:46:06] Christian Christlike that's what
[1:46:08] Christian means Christlike that's what
[1:46:10] the new birth is is you become like
[1:46:12] Christ not in his fullness because it's
[1:46:14] a multi-member body but you become a
[1:46:17] portion and you become the portion that
[1:46:18] he wants to reveal in you of himself and
[1:46:21] we have to be satisfied with that
[1:46:23] amen and you're changed from what you
[1:46:25] used to be into what you always were
[1:46:29] what you were meant to
[1:46:31] be Church what brought about the the the
[1:46:33] the new birth on the day of
[1:46:36] Pentecost how did they receive the Holy
[1:46:38] Ghost obedience obedience to the word
[1:46:41] what did Jesus say he says go and T
[1:46:43] until you be endued with power from on
[1:46:45] high and so what did they do they went
[1:46:47] and they waited They Carried and They
[1:46:48] Carried and They Carried and they waited
[1:46:50] for 10 days until God came down and
[1:46:52] filled them with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:46:54] they didn't move they didn't preach they
[1:46:55] didn't testify they didn't do anything
[1:46:57] they stayed there and they waited until
[1:46:59] God did what he promised and then as
[1:47:01] soon as he did what did they do Church
[1:47:03] they started Living the Life of Christ
[1:47:05] and they came down and they started
[1:47:06] preaching brother Brown would say that
[1:47:08] Peter comes down he's different now he's
[1:47:10] an inspired teacher he's got an
[1:47:12] anointing on him and they started
[1:47:13] showing these things and they started
[1:47:15] producing The Life of Christ and what is
[1:47:16] the first thing they did signs and
[1:47:18] wonders no they preached the word the
[1:47:22] first thing Peter did was he preached
[1:47:24] the word of God why because you cannot
[1:47:26] be born again outside of the word of God
[1:47:30] that's what it
[1:47:31] takes Peter comes down he starts
[1:47:33] preaching in maybe 5 or 10 minutes and
[1:47:36] look what it says happened in Acts 2 it
[1:47:38] says now when they heard this when they
[1:47:40] heard inspired
[1:47:42] preaching says they heard this they were
[1:47:44] pricked in their heart and they said
[1:47:45] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:47:47] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:47:49] do tell us how to save ourselves tell us
[1:47:51] how to make this right tell us how to
[1:47:52] receive eternal life then Peter said
[1:47:55] unto them very simple
[1:47:58] repent repent doesn't just mean to say
[1:48:01] I'm sorry repent means you are going
[1:48:04] this
[1:48:05] way and you turn around and you go this
[1:48:07] way so it's not a repentance is not just
[1:48:09] a thing of the mouth it's a thing of the
[1:48:11] life you turn away in obedience to the
[1:48:13] word from what you ought not to be doing
[1:48:15] according to God's word and you start
[1:48:17] doing what he said to do that's true
[1:48:19] repentance then when you've done that he
[1:48:21] says be baptized every one of
[1:48:24] you
[1:48:26] oh in the name of the father Son and
[1:48:28] Holy
[1:48:30] Ghost no no no no Peter's got the keys
[1:48:32] to the kingdom what is the name of the
[1:48:34] father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[1:48:36] what is the revelation of Father Son and
[1:48:38] Holy Ghost Jesus
[1:48:41] Christ so you got to be baptized right
[1:48:43] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:48:48] receive the Holy
[1:48:50] Ghost it's that simple
[1:48:53] you don't have to shout you don't have
[1:48:54] to dance you don't have to fall on your
[1:48:56] face you don't have to sign your name
[1:48:58] you don't have to wear a certain
[1:48:59] robe repent be baptized in the name of
[1:49:03] Jesus Christ and you'll receive the Holy
[1:49:07] Ghost who is it for for the promise is
[1:49:10] unto those that are sitting under
[1:49:12] Peter's ministry here today
[1:49:15] alone that's what some people are
[1:49:17] preaching
[1:49:18] Church sad but true Peter says the
[1:49:20] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:49:24] here's the thing he's preaching to
[1:49:26] people that are from all over the world
[1:49:28] devout
[1:49:30] Jews to your children and to all that
[1:49:34] are a far off even as many as the Lord
[1:49:37] Our God shall call don't let anybody
[1:49:39] ever tell you this experience was only
[1:49:41] for the apostolic age it is for everyone
[1:49:44] today God put it in tell me where he
[1:49:46] took it
[1:49:47] out amen he's never changed his program
[1:49:50] that's the beauty of God is he doesn't
[1:49:52] change his program there's no
[1:49:54] variableness no shadow of turning once
[1:49:55] he do it does it once he's got to do it
[1:49:57] the same way over and over again
[1:50:00] otherwise what certainty do we have what
[1:50:02] what hope do we have in a foundation
[1:50:03] that's constantly
[1:50:04] shifting when he does it he has to do it
[1:50:07] all the way now Peter doesn't stop there
[1:50:10] it says and with many other
[1:50:13] words that word there is logos with many
[1:50:17] more Divine thoughts did he testify and
[1:50:20] exhort saying save yourself from this un
[1:50:23] generation it says then they that gladly
[1:50:26] received
[1:50:27] what his word they that gladly received
[1:50:31] the
[1:50:31] logos his Divine message this wasn't
[1:50:34] spir this wasn't Peter preaching church
[1:50:36] this is the holy spirit
[1:50:39] preaching a man is speaking but it's the
[1:50:41] Holy Spirit speaking through that man
[1:50:43] and what is it it's Jesus Christ all
[1:50:45] over again continuing his ministry The
[1:50:47] Works that I do you shall do
[1:50:49] also he says and as many as that and
[1:50:51] they that gladly received his word were
[1:50:54] baptized and the same day there were
[1:50:56] added unto them about
[1:50:58] 3,000
[1:51:00] Souls what a
[1:51:03] sermon what a sermon 3,000 people but
[1:51:06] you'll see the way God does it he starts
[1:51:08] with
[1:51:09] 3,000 then he goes to a different place
[1:51:11] and it's a few less and comes down and
[1:51:13] pretty soon they're just
[1:51:15] gleaning they do this big start to get
[1:51:17] the gospel out and then what happens is
[1:51:19] it's just one here one there one there
[1:51:22] one there we don't worry about a big
[1:51:24] church we don't worry about lots of
[1:51:26] people I've said it before Paul's Church
[1:51:28] in Ephesus had 12 he writes to the
[1:51:30] Corinthians and there's 12 there small
[1:51:33] churches small
[1:51:34] people amen that's not what we're
[1:51:37] looking for but watch what Peter says
[1:51:38] here he says repent be baptized and
[1:51:40] you'll receive the Holy Ghost he's
[1:51:42] talking water because look at the
[1:51:43] natural birth he's saying to get the
[1:51:45] spiritual birth you need repent water
[1:51:48] baptism and the spirit but a natural
[1:51:50] birth takes water blood and then spirit
[1:51:54] amen when a when a mother's pregnant and
[1:51:56] she's about to give birth what happens
[1:51:58] first is first comes the water when her
[1:52:00] water breaks then there comes the blood
[1:52:01] and then after that comes the baby and
[1:52:03] the spirit enters into the baby
[1:52:04] producing human life and now when Christ
[1:52:07] is on the cross then what comes out of
[1:52:08] his body they pierce his side and out
[1:52:10] comes water blood and spirit all over
[1:52:12] again and it's the same thing that's
[1:52:13] required for our spiritual birth amen
[1:52:15] there's water there's a washing of the
[1:52:17] word there's the blood there's the
[1:52:19] sanctification of the blood of Christ
[1:52:21] and then there's the spirit which is the
[1:52:22] the holy spirit's The Life of Christ
[1:52:24] that comes into you and produces a
[1:52:26] living word you can have water and and
[1:52:29] you can have blood and never get to the
[1:52:31] New Birth you can be justified you can
[1:52:33] be Sanctified but it takes the spirit to
[1:52:36] make you live
[1:52:37] again can you imagine a mom that the
[1:52:40] water breaks and the blood comes out but
[1:52:41] if the baby never comes out there's no
[1:52:43] birth there's a baby but it's not born
[1:52:46] it has to come out to be born again it
[1:52:48] takes the spirit to make the the the
[1:52:50] Life of Christ in you amen we can have a
[1:52:52] beautiful personal life we can have a
[1:52:53] beautiful Christian Life we can not do
[1:52:55] different things we can come to church
[1:52:57] we can pay our ties we can do all these
[1:52:58] things that is not the new birth that's
[1:53:00] what people with the new birth do but
[1:53:02] that is not the new birth
[1:53:05] amen if God isn't in us we haven't been
[1:53:07] born again we'll touch on that in the
[1:53:10] next service but the new birth is a
[1:53:12] total conversion it's a total change
[1:53:15] it's the whole effect of the word of God
[1:53:16] and it takes that which is old and it
[1:53:18] puts it to death and it starts with
[1:53:20] something that's completely new born by
[1:53:22] the word of
[1:53:23] God Paul said this as we're almost done
[1:53:25] he says therefore If any man be in
[1:53:28] Christ he is a new creature a new
[1:53:31] creation notice he says if there's a
[1:53:34] question there if you haven't been
[1:53:36] changed you can't be in
[1:53:39] Christ no matter how good we feel no
[1:53:42] matter how good our parents are no
[1:53:43] matter how much we believe this
[1:53:45] message no matter how often we come to
[1:53:48] church that's not it how well we're
[1:53:51] taught I had tremendous teachers I had
[1:53:55] brother Mark in Sunday school I had
[1:53:56] brother Gerald that taught I found when
[1:53:57] I went out and traveled around I was
[1:54:00] well
[1:54:01] taught there were people struggling over
[1:54:03] things that I consider to be so silly
[1:54:05] because I was well taught didn't give me
[1:54:07] the new birth though and as soon as I
[1:54:09] received Christ everything I thought I
[1:54:12] knew had to be reformed through the
[1:54:14] filter of the word of God by the Holy
[1:54:16] Ghost and I understood things
[1:54:17] differently I saw people differently I
[1:54:20] saw situations differently I saw min
[1:54:23] differently why because I've been born
[1:54:25] again as much as I Knew by knowledge
[1:54:29] when I got the Holy Ghost to completely
[1:54:30] changed the way I looked at
[1:54:32] things he says old things are passed
[1:54:35] away behold all things are become new we
[1:54:39] have to be in Christ to be a new
[1:54:40] creature a new creation we have to be in
[1:54:43] Christ because remember it's him in
[1:54:44] control it can't be you in control it
[1:54:46] can't be me in control as Pastor it's
[1:54:48] not about me in control in this church
[1:54:50] God forbid we ever get to that place
[1:54:51] Church God forbid we get to that place
[1:54:54] it has to be the Holy Ghost there and
[1:54:56] I've got to be surrendered to him and
[1:54:57] you've got to be surrendered to him
[1:54:59] otherwise we're just going to start our
[1:55:00] own little denomination here amen and
[1:55:02] it'll fail we'll go into apostasy amen
[1:55:05] why because I'm dead and it's Christ
[1:55:07] that lives in me it's got to be him in
[1:55:09] control it's got to be him that's giving
[1:55:10] the orders and all we're doing is
[1:55:11] carrying them out where his hands his
[1:55:13] feet where his mouth these different
[1:55:14] things Paul says it this way he says for
[1:55:17] in him we live and move and have our
[1:55:20] being in other words there's nothing
[1:55:22] outside of
[1:55:23] us there's nothing in us that isn't
[1:55:25] controlled by him it's all wrapped in
[1:55:28] him it's all tied up in him we live we
[1:55:30] move you say I'm just going to the store
[1:55:33] you're in Christ I'm just driving to
[1:55:35] work you're in Christ I'm just having a
[1:55:37] conversation you're in Christ I'm just
[1:55:39] shutting my mouth you're in Christ I'm
[1:55:41] just going to church you're in Christ
[1:55:43] everything we do we're doing it through
[1:55:45] him amen he says we live and move and
[1:55:47] have our being as certain also of your
[1:55:49] own poets have said for we also are his
[1:55:52] off Spring we are his children how do we
[1:55:54] get in church how do we get into the
[1:55:56] body of Christ Paul says you got to be
[1:55:57] in them how do we get
[1:55:59] in come to a message
[1:56:02] church that's what a lot of people are
[1:56:05] saying the word will take you into
[1:56:09] Christ but sitting in the church won't
[1:56:11] do it you got to receive what's being
[1:56:13] preached over that Pulpit because that's
[1:56:15] the spirit of God to you it's not a man
[1:56:18] it's not an idea it's not a
[1:56:20] theology Paul says this for for by one
[1:56:23] Spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:56:27] body your Doctrine won't get you into
[1:56:29] Christ listen you can get into Christ
[1:56:32] and then he'll correct your Doctrine
[1:56:34] there's a lot of people have the correct
[1:56:35] Doctrine they don't have
[1:56:36] Christ that's just knowledge that's just
[1:56:40] knowledge amen but you got to have the
[1:56:42] spirit because otherwise the letter
[1:56:44] kills amen for by one Spirit we are all
[1:56:48] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:56:50] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:56:52] free and have all been made to drink
[1:56:54] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:56:56] member but many all of us come the same
[1:57:00] way we're all a part of that body
[1:57:02] there's no big eyes and little 's we're
[1:57:05] all little 's he's the big eye he's the
[1:57:08] big cheese and then he's the head of the
[1:57:10] body last quote as we close he says we
[1:57:13] all know that any kind of a birth is a
[1:57:17] mess when a baby's born if it's on the
[1:57:19] floor if it's on a Shu pile or in a pink
[1:57:21] decorated hospital room it's a mess he
[1:57:25] says but it brings life that's what the
[1:57:27] new birth is it's a mess but it brings
[1:57:31] Life Church you can't have death without
[1:57:33] a mess you go walk in the forest
[1:57:35] sometime and you see things that are
[1:57:36] dying there's a mess you see an animal
[1:57:38] that dies it's a mess you see a human
[1:57:40] body that's been decomposing for a while
[1:57:41] it's a mess cuz a new birth means
[1:57:44] there's a death and there's a life and
[1:57:47] the dying part's messy and the birthing
[1:57:49] part's messy amen he says it isn't a
[1:57:53] style or a put on or a declaration of
[1:57:56] Creeds it's the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:58] Ghost he says and that's the secret of
[1:58:01] the real believing Church Born Again
[1:58:05] amen God bless you let's stand if we
[1:58:07] would we're going to dig into what that
[1:58:09] looks like we're going to dig into what
[1:58:10] that mess looks like am me I remember
[1:58:13] when I gave my heart to the Lord it was
[1:58:14] a mess it was a mess boy and there's
[1:58:17] always things that come out of it and
[1:58:19] there's repercussions and rtion and
[1:58:21] there's Ripp that go through your life
[1:58:23] and it makes a mess of things but it's
[1:58:25] just God doing a separating work so he
[1:58:26] can raise you up clean up your life so
[1:58:28] he can live in you amen amen God bless
[1:58:31] you let's bow our heads each one

[2:03:49] happens the word comes into
[2:03:52] reality amen and there's something that
[2:03:54] anchors you and there's something that
[2:03:55] holds you because you know his word can
[2:03:57] never fail that's what I'm resting on
[2:03:59] I'm not resting on some sermon I preach
[2:04:01] I'm not resting on some idea I have I'm
[2:04:03] resting on a word that is proven itself
[2:04:05] time and time again in my life amen
[2:04:09] that's what I'm looking for day by day
[2:04:11] and when I speak that word when I put it
[2:04:12] on my lips when I keep it in my mind
[2:04:15] when I keep it in my life then I start
[2:04:16] to live by that word in a greater and
[2:04:18] greater way amen that's what God's
[2:04:20] looking for is a people that will take
[2:04:22] that word and testify of it amen the the
[2:04:26] scripture says that the testimony of
[2:04:27] Jesus Christ is a spirit of Prophecy
[2:04:30] amen The Life of Christ will produce the
[2:04:32] prophecy of the word in your life and
[2:04:34] that's where your dwell in day in and
[2:04:36] day out is he said he said to him that
[2:04:38] overcometh I'm going to overcome to him
[2:04:41] that overcometh I'm going to overcome to
[2:04:42] her that overcometh I'm going to
[2:04:44] overcome amen and it builds us up day by
[2:04:46] day and it keeps our mind in the right
[2:04:48] atmosphere and in the right frame so
[2:04:50] that we can accept it when it comes our
[2:04:52] way and we're not pushing it away and
[2:04:53] we're not pulled to one side or the
[2:04:55] other but it keeps us focused on the
[2:04:57] things of God keeps us focused on
[2:04:59] getting to the end goal
