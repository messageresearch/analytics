[42:02] and maybe maybe spring is here amen God
[42:08] bless you certainly enjoyed the song
[42:09] service this morning brother Josh it was
[42:11] wonderful amen the song service doesn't
[42:13] have to line up with the with what's
[42:16] preached it did this morning but it
[42:17] doesn't have to but it's to prepare your
[42:19] heart for the hearing of the word amen
[42:21] it's to open up the people put them in a
[42:23] state of worship and to invite the
[42:24] presence of God here amen but I
[42:26] certainly appreciate appreciate it when
[42:27] it lines up with what we'll speak on in
[42:29] the service amen God bless you each
[42:32] one Psalms
[42:34] 84 and 11 says this for the Lord God is
[42:38] a son and shield the Lord will give
[42:41] Grace and Glory no good thing will he
[42:44] withhold from them that walk uprightly
[42:46] let's read the 12th verse as well oh
[42:48] lord of hosts blessed is the man that
[42:51] trusteth in thee amen God bless you you
[42:54] can have your seats this morning and
[42:56] we're continuing our usual series and
[42:57] our our title we've had on Authority by
[43:00] position and we're going to take a big
[43:01] leap forward this morning we're going to
[43:03] go to the story of Esther and I want to
[43:05] look at the approach that we take and
[43:07] the attitude that we have when it comes
[43:09] to our relationship with God and we're
[43:11] talking about adoption we're talking
[43:12] about being placed into a position of
[43:14] authority but we have to see that our
[43:16] Authority always comes through him amen
[43:18] we do not stand alone in our Authority
[43:20] it's not something that we just get to
[43:22] choose and do in these different things
[43:24] but for the sake of time we're not going
[43:25] to read all the scriptures we are are
[43:27] going to start in Esther chapter 1 and
[43:28] you can turn there if you want to and
[43:30] keep your Bibles and Esther we be
[43:32] reading a lot of scriptures this morning
[43:34] but I don't want to go through
[43:35] everything but I I want you to see how
[43:37] Esther starts because we know that
[43:38] Esther becomes the queen of the land but
[43:41] I want you to see how she starts because
[43:43] how we start usually determines how we
[43:44] finish up amen if we start on the right
[43:47] uh line if we start in the right
[43:48] direction if we start the right way then
[43:50] it all works out but if we start just a
[43:51] little bit off then what happens is
[43:53] we're left picking up the pieces and we
[43:55] wonder what went wrong and so we'll see
[43:57] with Esther that she comes in and and
[44:00] the way she starts is the perfect way
[44:02] and it's a type of the Bride that we're
[44:03] looking at this morning so Esther 1 and
[44:06] verse 10 says this on the seventh day
[44:08] when the heart of the King was merry
[44:10] with wine he commanded these seven men
[44:12] the seven chamberlains that served in
[44:14] the presence of H hasar the king to
[44:17] bring vashy the queen before the king
[44:19] with the Crown Royal to show the people
[44:22] and the princes her beauty for she was
[44:24] fair to look on the king is wanting to
[44:26] show her off she's the most beautiful
[44:29] woman in the land according to him and
[44:31] so he wants to show her off but watch
[44:34] her response now verse 12 it says but
[44:35] the queen vashi refused to come at the
[44:38] king's commandment by his chamberlains
[44:41] therefore was the king very RW and his
[44:43] anger burned in him now carnally we
[44:45] can't blame vashi what what woman in her
[44:48] right mind will want to go prance around
[44:51] a room and show off her beauty to a
[44:52] bunch of
[44:53] drunks you know carnally speaking we can
[44:56] identify with
[44:57] vashi but vashi forgot her position
[45:01] right or wrong she forgot her position
[45:04] and so if we jump down to verse
[45:06] 15 then then then what happens is is the
[45:09] king says what can we do now she has
[45:11] disobeyed me she's made me a fool in
[45:13] front of the people so what am I allowed
[45:16] to do he says what shall we do Under the
[45:17] queen vashi according to law he says
[45:21] because she had not performed the
[45:23] Commandment of the king a haar by the
[45:26] Chamberlain noticing the king is asking
[45:28] what do I have a right to do he's saying
[45:32] what in my law allows me to do something
[45:35] about this he's not wanting to just make
[45:37] up something but he's saying according
[45:39] to the laws that everyone has to live by
[45:41] what options do I have with this amen
[45:44] he's asking as wise men what are the
[45:46] decrees of the Kingdom what is it that
[45:48] I'm allowed to do according to what I
[45:50] make the rest of you do amen and we see
[45:52] there's a type of Christ here no type in
[45:54] the scripture is perfect but we see
[45:56] there's a type of Christ here because
[45:57] he's saying what does the word allow me
[45:59] to do to an Unfaithful
[46:02] wife and then they said in verse 19 if
[46:04] it please the king Let There Go a royal
[46:07] commandment from him and let it be
[46:08] written among the laws of the Persians
[46:10] and the mees that it be not altered that
[46:13] vashi come no more be before King ah
[46:16] hasar but let the King give her Royal
[46:18] Estate unto another that is better than
[46:20] she so what they're saying is you can
[46:22] have a decree of divorcement it's
[46:25] allowed by the law for you to put her
[46:27] away and she can't come before you
[46:28] anymore she's Dishonored you she's
[46:30] disobeyed you she's made a fool of you
[46:32] she has not come under your Authority
[46:34] and the law says you can divorce her and
[46:38] we know that the followup is that the
[46:39] king does and he divorces vashy he puts
[46:41] her away and he moves on with life but
[46:43] of course being a king and being a man
[46:45] he gets lonely and eventually he says
[46:47] this isn't it's not good for a man to
[46:49] dwell alone I don't like being alone and
[46:51] so he says what can we do about this
[46:52] situation okay the law says I can
[46:55] divorce her but what does the law say I
[46:56] can do now and so it says in Esther 2
[46:59] and 1 it says now after these thingss
[47:01] that the wrath of king of haaris was
[47:02] appeased he remembered Vash and what she
[47:05] had done and what was decreed against
[47:06] her then said the king's servants and
[47:08] ministered unto him let there be fair
[47:11] young virgins sought for the king and
[47:13] let the king appoint officers and all
[47:15] the provinces of his kingdom that they
[47:16] may gather together all the fair young
[47:18] virgins unto shushan the palace to the
[47:21] house of the women unto the custody of
[47:23] heg the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the
[47:25] women and let their things for
[47:28] purification be given in be given unto
[47:30] them so he said listen we'll find you
[47:32] another wife and we're going to go
[47:34] throughout the land and we're going to
[47:35] find the fairest of the fair and let
[47:38] them come in but notice what it says
[47:40] here let their things for purification
[47:42] be given them you couldn't just come in
[47:44] the presence of the king the way you
[47:45] were you were not acceptable the way you
[47:47] are you had to go through a process of
[47:50] purification and it was his process it
[47:53] was his process that would make you
[47:55] acceptable in the king's presence it
[47:58] says and let the maiden which pleases
[48:00] the king be Queen instead of vashi and
[48:02] the thing pleas the king and he did so
[48:05] now in shusa and the palace there was a
[48:07] certain Jew whose name was Mori the son
[48:08] of jir the son of shim the son of Kish a
[48:11] benjamite who had been carried away from
[48:13] Jerusalem with the Captivity which had
[48:15] been carried away with jonia king of
[48:17] Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[48:19] Babylon had carried away and he brought
[48:22] up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's
[48:25] daughter for she had neither father nor
[48:27] mother and the maid was fair and
[48:29] beautiful whom morai when her father and
[48:31] mother were dead took for his own
[48:33] daughter so they came out in the
[48:34] Captivity and she's not even his
[48:36] daughter she's a distant relative to
[48:38] him says so it came to pass when the
[48:41] king's commandment and his decree Was
[48:42] Heard and when many maidens were
[48:44] gathered together unto shusa and the
[48:46] palace to the custody of heg that dester
[48:48] was brought also into the King's house
[48:50] to the custody of hegi Keeper of the
[48:52] women now catch this every single of
[48:56] pretty lady
[48:57] in the Kingdom has been brought in but
[48:59] it says here that the maiden pleased him
[49:02] and she obtained one thing kindness she
[49:06] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[49:08] gave her things for purification and
[49:10] such things as belong to her and seven
[49:13] maidens which were meat to be given her
[49:15] out of the King's house and he preferred
[49:17] her and her Maids unto the best place of
[49:20] the House of the women so notice the
[49:23] character of Esther here yes she's a
[49:25] pretty face but there's something
[49:26] something about Esther that gives her
[49:28] grace in the eyes of those that she
[49:29] meets up with there's a character
[49:31] element here that he has not seen among
[49:34] any of the other beautiful women and
[49:36] what does it do it brings her to a place
[49:38] of
[49:39] kindness she gets something that maybe
[49:41] the others don't get and he puts her to
[49:43] the front of the queue he says I'll get
[49:46] you purified first you're the one that I
[49:48] think the king's going to want and so he
[49:50] prefers her above all the
[49:52] others it says Now esther had not showed
[49:55] her people nor her kindred for Mori had
[49:57] charged her that she should not show it
[49:59] so she hasn't told anyone she's a Jew
[50:01] she's just another pretty face says now
[50:04] in verse 12 now when every maid's term
[50:06] was come to go into king of haar after
[50:08] that she had been 12 months according to
[50:10] the manner of the women for so were the
[50:12] days of their purifications accomplished
[50:14] to it six months with oil of myrrh and
[50:17] six months with sweet odors and with
[50:19] other things for the purifying of the
[50:20] women so there's a type here of
[50:22] sanctification of the believer but
[50:24] remember you see here there's two times
[50:26] there's a time to take everything out
[50:29] and then there's a time to put things
[50:31] back in and what he takes out he has to
[50:33] replace with something good so what they
[50:35] do is they put them in this mix and what
[50:37] it would do is it would draw out all the
[50:39] impurities from their skin so it would
[50:41] take care of the acne it would take care
[50:43] of the blemishes and the rashes and
[50:45] these different things and it would take
[50:47] out all the things that were impure but
[50:50] then what happens after that is they get
[50:51] put into perfume and that perfume would
[50:54] soak into that woman because the thing
[50:57] is this amen she's got to be acceptable
[51:00] in the eyes of the king now not to get
[51:02] too carnal but he doesn't want a hairy
[51:04] stinky sweaty woman that's not what he
[51:07] wants he wants a woman that is perfect
[51:10] and so the purification process is to
[51:13] perfect the person that's going through
[51:15] it to bring them into the presence of
[51:17] the king amen it wasn't enough to be
[51:20] clean she had to embody cleanliness she
[51:23] had to embody pureness she had to embody
[51:26] holy
[51:27] she had to be it and so she didn't just
[51:30] smell like perfume when she came in she
[51:33] was perfume she didn't have to wear
[51:36] perfume she had been so saturated in
[51:39] this that she naturally smelled
[51:42] wonderful that's what would bring you
[51:44] into the presence of the king what she
[51:46] had to be the real deal she couldn't
[51:48] just put something on she couldn't just
[51:50] prop things up and make herself look
[51:52] good but she had to literally be pure
[51:55] and beautiful
[51:57] you know what scripture says in second
[51:59] Corinthians 5:21 it says we are made the
[52:02] righteousness of God we don't just put
[52:05] this on yes it calls us we say we have
[52:07] the white robe of righteousness but we
[52:09] are literally the embodiment of his
[52:12] righteousness we're the EMB embodiment
[52:14] of the purity of the Holiness of Christ
[52:17] that's what she's going through and
[52:18] that's what brings her into the presence
[52:19] of the
[52:20] king it says then then thus came every
[52:23] Maiden unto the king and whatsoever she
[52:26] desired was given to her to go out of
[52:27] her out of the house of the woman under
[52:30] the King's house and in the evening she
[52:32] went and on the tomorrow she returned
[52:33] unto the second house of the women to
[52:35] the custody of shash Gaz the king's
[52:37] Chamberlain which kept the concubines
[52:39] she came in unto the king no more except
[52:42] the king delighted in her and that she
[52:44] were called by
[52:47] name he didn't just have to remember the
[52:49] event he had to remember who you
[52:51] were cuz otherwise it was just a
[52:53] nameless set of faces a nameless set of
[52:55] bodies that the King was going through
[52:57] they'd all get one night with the King
[52:59] and they have one night to make an
[53:00] impression and then either he fell in
[53:02] love with you or he didn't fall in love
[53:03] with you and then they would be sent to
[53:05] the second house but catch this it says
[53:08] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[53:10] of of abah the uncle of morai who had
[53:13] taken her for his daughter was come to
[53:15] go into the king she required nothing
[53:18] but what heate the king's Chamberlain
[53:20] The Keeper of the women appointed and
[53:22] Esther obtained favor in the sight of
[53:25] all that them that looked on her
[53:26] remember when Esther first came in she
[53:28] obtained kindness but now she says it's
[53:31] my time to go into the house of the king
[53:33] it's my time for one night with the king
[53:35] and you know what she doesn't do she
[53:37] doesn't say well I want blue cuz blue
[53:39] makes my eyes pop and I want gold clips
[53:41] and I want a little mini Tiara to make
[53:43] him think that I'm already a queen no
[53:45] she says what does the queen what does
[53:47] the king love what does he like to look
[53:50] at what kind of clothes does he
[53:52] appreciate what are his inclinations
[53:55] what is it that will make me have favor
[53:57] in the king's eyes and as soon as she
[53:59] does that she gains favor in everybody's
[54:02] eyes cuz Hester's going in differently
[54:05] than anyone else she's not going in with
[54:07] an idea of how she's going to seduce
[54:08] this King she's saying what makes the
[54:11] king tick what does he like all go in
[54:14] the way he likes I may not like the way
[54:17] it is but as long as he likes it that's
[54:19] what matters that's what matters amen it
[54:23] says so Esther was taken under king of
[54:25] hasar into his house in the 10th mon
[54:27] month which is the month tth in the
[54:29] seventh year of his Reign and the King
[54:31] loved Esther above all the women and she
[54:34] obtained two things grace and favor
[54:38] grace and favor remember this for later
[54:40] she obtained grace and favor in a site
[54:42] more than all the virgins so that he set
[54:45] the Royal Crown upon her head and made
[54:47] her Queen instead of ashy now the
[54:49] prophet of God says this he says like
[54:51] Esther when Esther was to be chosen to
[54:54] stand before the king she didn't Adorn
[54:56] her herself with all the things but she
[54:58] adorned herself with a sweet Meek Spirit
[55:03] he says that's what the bride is
[55:05] adorning herself with with all the
[55:08] fruits of the spirit's following in
[55:10] other words it's not just an act it's
[55:11] not just a put on now I don't want to
[55:13] get too carnal this morning but you'll
[55:15] find today with women everything is
[55:17] fake everything is fake they've got so
[55:20] much makeup on you don't know what they
[55:21] actually look like they got everything
[55:24] pushed and prodded and pulled and
[55:25] supported and all these things you don't
[55:27] know what their body actually looks like
[55:30] their hair is half of it is fake the
[55:32] color is wrong they've got things
[55:33] Blended in there is nothing real about
[55:36] most of the women today they're trying
[55:38] to hide who they are brother R I'm
[55:40] saying when we're talking about the
[55:41] bride of Christ she comes in with one
[55:43] thing and that's a Meek humble a Meek
[55:46] sweet Spirit there's no put on with that
[55:50] and then the rest is what it is amen he
[55:54] says what does she have she is
[55:56] assembling together in The Fellowship of
[55:58] the word and what does that look like he
[56:00] says it's
[56:01] Amen uh fellowshipping setting together
[56:04] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[56:06] tonight one Accord one place one Spirit
[56:10] one mind one hope one God one purpose
[56:13] seven things what is it it's getting in
[56:16] line with God's word and plan she's
[56:17] dressed to please everything is about
[56:21] his plan his purpose amen see there you
[56:25] are every time the Bible says anything
[56:27] we say Amen punctuating every word with
[56:30] amen he says let them Adorn themselves
[56:33] with that kind of a spirit not only the
[56:36] women but the men too Adorn themselves
[56:38] with that kind of a spirit he says then
[56:40] you're becoming ready for the bride
[56:43] sweet reverent and then he says Esther
[56:46] made her heart clean she's walking in
[56:49] completely different from those women we
[56:51] see no indication from Esther that she
[56:54] wants to become the queen we don't see
[56:56] her playing any political games we don't
[56:58] see any one-upmanship we don't see her
[57:00] stabbing other women in the back to get
[57:02] them out of her way we don't see her
[57:04] scheming she's merely acting according
[57:07] to her nature which is I'm going to do
[57:10] what pleases the king and if he likes me
[57:12] he likes me and if he doesn't he doesn't
[57:15] but I'm going in according to what he
[57:17] wants her objective was not selfish her
[57:20] objective was to please the
[57:22] king brother Braham says this Esther
[57:25] purged her heart before God walked up
[57:27] with a Meek and humble Spirit he says
[57:30] it's the church that's going to be the
[57:32] bride of Christ now remember Esther
[57:35] refused the worldly adornment remember
[57:37] the scripture says the bride has made
[57:39] herself ready and what is she wearing
[57:41] she's wearing the robe that he gave
[57:45] her she's wearing what the white robe
[57:47] which is the righteousness of saints
[57:49] which is the righteousness of God she's
[57:51] going in with his Merit and his favor
[57:54] not with her own
[57:56] amen she's wearing the Garment he
[57:58] provided not the one she thinks looks
[58:01] best she took the spirit in her heart to
[58:04] go before the king it's a sweet kind
[58:07] reverent Spirit reverent Spirit to the
[58:09] word of God she's Washed by the Water of
[58:11] the word and the word in you it's
[58:14] washing the church needs a washing a
[58:16] Full Gospel washing that's right not
[58:18] just a part washing but a Full Gospel
[58:21] washing cleaned up and made new
[58:23] creatures in Christ Jesus he says Jesus
[58:25] brought is not a dirty bride he wouldn't
[58:28] have his bride dirty amen what is the
[58:31] reason why we would be dirty because we
[58:33] choose what we wear we choose how we
[58:35] look we choose how we act that's what
[58:38] makes us unacceptable we've got to go in
[58:40] his provided way and we're seeing the
[58:42] right approach here with Esther and it's
[58:43] approach that she maintains even after
[58:45] she is Queen and she always comes in
[58:48] with the right attitude and the attitude
[58:49] is what would please the king amen sure
[58:53] she has issues sure she has needs even
[58:55] as a Queen she's got issues even as the
[58:58] bride of Christ we have issues amen
[59:00] we've got needs we've got concerns we've
[59:02] got life and death situations sometimes
[59:05] but no matter what is on Esther's heart
[59:07] she always comes in to give the king
[59:09] worship and to make him feel good she's
[59:12] always putting him ahead of her and what
[59:15] brings Esther into Authority is the
[59:17] right approach and the right attitude
[59:19] that is a thing that takes her into the
[59:20] presence of the king and keeps her in
[59:22] the presence of King is her attitude and
[59:24] her approach now now we know the rest of
[59:26] this story and again I'm not going to
[59:28] read a ton of those scriptures this
[59:30] morning but we know that the king had an
[59:31] adviser named uh hmon and he's a a
[59:34] wicked man he's a schemy man he's all
[59:36] about himself and he's power hungry and
[59:38] we see that he he gets the king to make
[59:40] him the prince of princes anden that's
[59:43] we see a type here of Lucifer who's
[59:45] always you know he was the head of the
[59:46] Angels but he fell because he talked he
[59:49] he focused on himself and he says I will
[59:51] rise up and I will and I will and I will
[59:54] and hmon we see he fools the king and
[59:57] he's declared worthy of honor and when
[59:58] he's walking or riding through the
[1:00:00] streets everyone is supposed to bow down
[1:00:02] before him and that's the law of the
[1:00:04] king is that they're supposed to give
[1:00:06] Mori or or they're supposed to give hmon
[1:00:08] this this honor but we see that morai
[1:00:11] refuses to bow down and so hmon gets mad
[1:00:14] and he goes to the king and he says
[1:00:16] there's a certain
[1:00:18] people we're seeing today there's
[1:00:20] certain people amen you're labeled a
[1:00:23] certain way and they believe this and
[1:00:25] they believe that and they don't do this
[1:00:26] and they don't do that and they're not
[1:00:27] good for society and they're holding
[1:00:29] back the uni you know the unity of the
[1:00:31] churches and that there's always
[1:00:33] somebody that calls us certain people
[1:00:35] and he goes to the king and he spins a
[1:00:37] lie and what does he do he says King
[1:00:39] there's a bunch of law
[1:00:41] Breakers in the country he says and I'll
[1:00:45] pay you 10,000 gold pieces if you'll let
[1:00:48] me take care of them just give me your
[1:00:50] give me your word give me your Authority
[1:00:51] and I'll go take care of them now here's
[1:00:53] the thing according to the law hmon had
[1:00:56] a right to say that according to the law
[1:00:58] Satan has a right to accuse us amen we
[1:01:01] did wrong by the law Mori had broken the
[1:01:04] law he had refused to Bow before hmon
[1:01:07] that was the law but notice now that
[1:01:09] what Hon's trying to do is destroy an
[1:01:11] entire People based on the actions of
[1:01:13] one person can you see the type and he's
[1:01:16] coming in he's saying they've broken the
[1:01:18] law and therefore they have to be
[1:01:20] destroyed and the King rubber stamps it
[1:01:22] and he says sure go ahead and do it but
[1:01:24] I want you to see something that Paul
[1:01:26] talks about and we're only going to read
[1:01:27] the first half of this verse we'll read
[1:01:29] the second half later he says moreover
[1:01:31] the law entered that the offense might
[1:01:35] abound and man we see that that what
[1:01:37] Hon's doing is he's taking one issue and
[1:01:40] he's magnifying it over the entire
[1:01:41] people and what's he trying to do he's
[1:01:43] trying to bring us into Des disrepute
[1:01:45] before the king he's the accuser of the
[1:01:48] Brethren he's standing Before the Throne
[1:01:50] and he's saying look at what they did
[1:01:51] look at what they did look at what they
[1:01:53] did and by the law he's right
[1:01:56] that's why he has a right to stand there
[1:01:58] church that's why we still need a
[1:02:00] mediator
[1:02:01] today amen that's why we still need a
[1:02:04] mediator today but here's the thing the
[1:02:07] king doesn't know that Esther is a Jew
[1:02:10] he doesn't know that she's now put under
[1:02:12] the law because you know the law says
[1:02:14] Jews it doesn't just say a certain
[1:02:16] people it's going to Define who it is
[1:02:19] amen and so the king's trusting Hon's
[1:02:21] judgment and and he has no issue with
[1:02:23] what's going to happen and of course
[1:02:24] Mori and the rest of the Jews they're
[1:02:26] horrified their heartbroken they know
[1:02:28] that there's a day and there's a time
[1:02:29] where they're going to have to pay and
[1:02:31] that they're going to die and they're
[1:02:33] going to give their lives and the thing
[1:02:34] is this the law is the law and when you
[1:02:36] look in those times when the king gave a
[1:02:39] law he couldn't just come and strike it
[1:02:42] out the law was held by the king himself
[1:02:45] and he could not just do away with it
[1:02:49] the word is the word you can't do away
[1:02:52] with it you can't sidestep it and say
[1:02:54] I'm the bride it doesn't apply apply to
[1:02:56] me in and of itself the law applies to
[1:02:59] you the king could not take back his own
[1:03:00] law we saw the same thing with Daniel
[1:03:02] remember they said oh King nobody's
[1:03:04] allowed to pray to anybody but they have
[1:03:06] to pray to you and whoever doesn't do
[1:03:08] that whoever prays to another God they
[1:03:10] got to get thrown to the Lions and so
[1:03:11] the King was bound by his own law and he
[1:03:13] threw Daniel into the lion's den but we
[1:03:15] see there that there's another law
[1:03:17] Hallelujah there's another law but he's
[1:03:19] bound to this law amen but we see that
[1:03:23] their only hope is that they can go to
[1:03:24] Esther and est's access to the king will
[1:03:27] save them let me stop and say this
[1:03:30] church we're not where we are just for
[1:03:32] ourselves there's an entire nation
[1:03:35] there's an entire group of people that
[1:03:37] is trusting that Esther can get into the
[1:03:39] king's presence we're here to save
[1:03:41] others we're here to intercede for
[1:03:43] others we talked about this when we
[1:03:44] talked about priests and Kings remember
[1:03:46] when we're looking at adoption adoption
[1:03:47] is not about me adoption is about you it
[1:03:50] is not about selfishness it's about
[1:03:52] service and Esther has been put into a
[1:03:55] position to serve her people amen they
[1:03:59] may be co-workers it might be family may
[1:04:01] be lost Ones maybe loved ones whatever
[1:04:03] it is and they're outside of the blood
[1:04:05] of Christ they don't have access to him
[1:04:07] the way that we do but we can go and we
[1:04:08] can intercede on their behalf that's
[1:04:11] what we're here for in an adopted State
[1:04:14] amen Christ did it this was the
[1:04:16] embodiment of adoption was Christ
[1:04:18] walking on this Earth and everything he
[1:04:20] did was for our sake never did Christ do
[1:04:23] anything for his sake even when he clean
[1:04:25] his life he kept it clean he says I
[1:04:27] sanctify myself for their sakes the
[1:04:29] things that I don't do I do it for their
[1:04:31] sake because under him anything was
[1:04:33] lawful he could do anything he wanted he
[1:04:35] could have got married he could have had
[1:04:37] children he could have had all of these
[1:04:38] things could have went and just sat and
[1:04:41] become a carpenter lived an easy life
[1:04:42] but he says what I'm doing the way I'm
[1:04:44] living my life is for their sake not for
[1:04:46] myself amen that's what we're looking at
[1:04:49] amen and as long as that blood's on The
[1:04:51] Mercy Seat and it is as long as there's
[1:04:53] a mediator than were to stand in that
[1:04:55] place and where to go and intercede for
[1:04:57] others amen we're there they're the only
[1:04:59] ones that can do it watch what brother
[1:05:01] Bram says though he says he he's talking
[1:05:03] about coming before God he says now my
[1:05:05] motives right so therefore he said say
[1:05:08] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:05:10] doubt and it's the will of God for me to
[1:05:12] do it or he'd have never sent me he says
[1:05:14] there you are you get everything working
[1:05:16] right and your motive and objective
[1:05:18] right you can say to anything and as
[1:05:21] long as it's the will of God it'll do it
[1:05:24] he says but I want to say to be some big
[1:05:26] stuff shirt to make me a great program
[1:05:29] somewhere put me on some telecast
[1:05:31] Universal or something now that's wrong
[1:05:34] amen adoption is not about me he says
[1:05:36] it's about something else it's about
[1:05:39] being in the will of God he says and
[1:05:41] Jesus lacked one thing he says you know
[1:05:44] what it was Showmanship he wasn't a
[1:05:48] showman wasn't trying to put on a big
[1:05:50] Affair wasn't trying to draw attention
[1:05:52] to himself wasn't a me monster
[1:05:56] that's Lucifer Lucifer is i i i i and me
[1:06:00] me me me me but what does he say no I'll
[1:06:02] go and I'll seek the will of
[1:06:04] God and when he tells me what he wants
[1:06:07] me to do then I'll go do it and then
[1:06:08] it's going to happen because he told me
[1:06:10] what to do but we think that looking at
[1:06:12] Esther and I know we know the story but
[1:06:14] I I want to dramatize this a little bit
[1:06:16] because you'd think that Esther would
[1:06:17] think nothing of a request to go talk to
[1:06:19] the king if somebody came to you know
[1:06:22] maybe they had an issue and only the
[1:06:24] pastor could solve it you know and
[1:06:25] they'd maybe say to my wife could you
[1:06:27] talk to Brother John about this my wife
[1:06:30] doesn't have to get psyched up to come
[1:06:32] talk to me about it she's my wife she
[1:06:35] can come into my presence
[1:06:37] anytime we don't treat it like that you
[1:06:39] know come into my presence no I'm her
[1:06:42] husband she can come talk to me anytime
[1:06:45] anywhere and no matter what I'm doing
[1:06:48] she's going to take the pre the
[1:06:49] Precedence she's my wife she's my first
[1:06:51] love amen but we see here that there's a
[1:06:54] problem with this plan and in Esther
[1:06:57] 4:10 it says this again Esther spoke
[1:06:59] unto hatch so there's this back and
[1:07:00] forth between Mori and Esther through
[1:07:02] this man hatch and gave him commandment
[1:07:04] to Mori and said all the king's servants
[1:07:07] and the people of the king's provinces
[1:07:08] do know that whosoever whether man or
[1:07:11] woman shall come unto the king into the
[1:07:13] inner Court who is not called there is
[1:07:17] one law of his to put him to death
[1:07:20] except such to whom the king shall hold
[1:07:22] out the golden scepter that he may live
[1:07:25] she says but I have not been called to
[1:07:27] come in unto the king these 30 days so
[1:07:30] there's a law that's block blocking the
[1:07:32] approach of the presence of the
[1:07:35] king at one time even the elect Church
[1:07:38] could not approach God he cast them out
[1:07:40] of his
[1:07:42] presence but there is a way made we know
[1:07:44] that but when you choose to approach him
[1:07:47] he has a law and he can say death or he
[1:07:50] can say life and it's completely on him
[1:07:53] it's completely on him amen we see so
[1:07:55] many types and shadows in the Book of
[1:07:57] Esther and we'd be 20 or 30 Services if
[1:07:59] we were preaching on it but I want to
[1:08:01] say one thing there was a law holding us
[1:08:03] back from the
[1:08:04] presence when we were kicked out of Eden
[1:08:06] we could not go into his presence and he
[1:08:09] had to choose to come down and when he
[1:08:12] came down that was his Sovereign Grace
[1:08:14] but we could not put ourselves into his
[1:08:15] presence he had to come down to us he
[1:08:17] had to lower himself to our place amen
[1:08:20] but what did he do he extended his Royal
[1:08:22] pardon by his Sovereign will and said
[1:08:24] I'll let you in
[1:08:26] I'll come to you it says now then Mori
[1:08:29] commanded to answer eser and says think
[1:08:31] not with thyself that thou shalt Escape
[1:08:33] in the King's house more than all of the
[1:08:35] Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy
[1:08:37] peace at this time then there shall
[1:08:39] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[1:08:41] Jews from another place but thou and thy
[1:08:43] father's house shall be destroyed he
[1:08:45] says and who knoweth whether Thou Art
[1:08:47] come to the kingdom for such a time as
[1:08:50] this Mori says listen Esther the law is
[1:08:52] the law and whether you die today or
[1:08:54] tomorrow the next day you're going to
[1:08:56] die under this law because you're a Jew
[1:08:58] and as soon as they find out he's got to
[1:09:00] kill you but he says now you're going to
[1:09:02] die and when you die your whole family
[1:09:04] dies with you you're the last of of of
[1:09:06] your family he says but us we're going
[1:09:08] to get
[1:09:09] delivered he says we're the we're the
[1:09:11] we're the children of Abraham we're
[1:09:13] going to get delivered but you'll die
[1:09:14] because you didn't work on our
[1:09:17] behalf You' got something to do but
[1:09:19] catch what he says he says but maybe you
[1:09:23] ought to consider that you've gone
[1:09:25] through everything you've gone through
[1:09:26] for this
[1:09:28] moment I want to step back a bit this
[1:09:30] morning because when we look at Esther
[1:09:32] when we think about what she's gone
[1:09:34] through what a trial it's been she goes
[1:09:36] and she's taken by Nebuchadnezzar out of
[1:09:39] her home her parents are killed so she
[1:09:43] has early childhood trauma she's now put
[1:09:46] into a foster home with relatives
[1:09:48] distant relatives she's taken away from
[1:09:50] church she's taken away from Believers
[1:09:52] she's in a foreign land and then she's
[1:09:54] living there that seems to be okay but
[1:09:57] then she's removed even from that and
[1:09:59] she's placed a bunch among amongst a
[1:10:01] bunch of worldly women everyone's trying
[1:10:04] to become Queen everyone's political
[1:10:06] everyone's trying to get ahead and she's
[1:10:08] just some little simple believer and all
[1:10:10] she wants to do is go home and she's put
[1:10:14] in this place amen and she doesn't even
[1:10:16] want to be there in the first place she
[1:10:18] doesn't want to be in Babylon now she's
[1:10:19] in the King's house now she's going to
[1:10:21] be forced into intimacy with a man she
[1:10:24] doesn't know and love she's put through
[1:10:26] a year six months of painful process to
[1:10:29] clean her out and then she's put through
[1:10:32] six months to make her
[1:10:33] beautiful and while she might like the
[1:10:36] effect of what they've done because
[1:10:37] she's prettier than ever she's still
[1:10:40] living way outside of her comfort zone
[1:10:43] there's nothing enjoyable about this
[1:10:45] life that she's living in and of
[1:10:48] itself and then she's brought into a
[1:10:50] king and he can do with her whatever she
[1:10:53] he wants and she can't say no
[1:10:57] now he falls in love with her and I
[1:10:59] believe Esther falls in love with him
[1:11:01] because we see her character continue to
[1:11:03] come through this because no matter
[1:11:04] where she is she holds fast to how she's
[1:11:06] been raised she doesn't become worldly
[1:11:09] she doesn't become backstabbing and
[1:11:11] conniving she doesn't become
[1:11:13] manipulative she stays Meek and humble
[1:11:15] and quiet the whole way through nothing
[1:11:18] changes her but it hasn't been fun she's
[1:11:20] isolated she's alone she has nothing
[1:11:23] except the occasional message that Mori
[1:11:25] s her that's the only out uh you know
[1:11:28] contact she has with the outside world
[1:11:30] and so she's living in the midst of a a
[1:11:32] total worldly situation much like Daniel
[1:11:35] and the three Hebrew children and he's
[1:11:37] saying you've gone through this for
[1:11:42] this sometimes we're sitting there and
[1:11:44] I've been through things in my life and
[1:11:46] and seasons of life and I find they are
[1:11:48] seasons church if you're struggling this
[1:11:51] morning if it seems like nothing is
[1:11:53] happening like nothing is going to take
[1:11:55] place place that you've prayed and
[1:11:56] you've prayed and nothing's happening
[1:11:58] let me tell you it's only for a season
[1:12:00] it's only for a time but God has a
[1:12:03] purpose and I've been in seasons of life
[1:12:04] where I was sick where I was injured
[1:12:07] where I struggled for spiritual food in
[1:12:08] due season where I felt alone where I
[1:12:11] felt people didn't like me where I
[1:12:13] needed personal deliverance and no
[1:12:14] matter how much I prayed it seemed like
[1:12:16] nothing was happening and yet in it all
[1:12:19] God never left me God was always there
[1:12:22] through it all amen and what I found is
[1:12:24] in the end that he works all things for
[1:12:26] our good amen and so what he was he was
[1:12:29] doing there was he was bringing me to a
[1:12:31] place where he could use me more where
[1:12:34] he could clean me more purification is
[1:12:37] never easy Church some things are Dee
[1:12:39] rooted some things are genetic some
[1:12:41] things are familiar some things are
[1:12:44] church and God has to break that out
[1:12:47] because he wants a pure bride and
[1:12:49] sometimes he's got to lay us flat on our
[1:12:51] back physically financially emotionally
[1:12:55] maritally whatever it might be and he's
[1:12:57] got to take us and break us down and get
[1:12:59] all those things out so that he can
[1:13:00] build us into the beautiful holy bride
[1:13:02] that he's trying to get us to
[1:13:04] be I don't care where you're at this
[1:13:06] morning you can say nobody knows what
[1:13:07] I'm going through nobody's been through
[1:13:09] it church every single person that's a
[1:13:11] child of God is going through something
[1:13:13] at some given time why because we're all
[1:13:15] growing we're all maturing in Christ and
[1:13:17] that means there's a constant work
[1:13:19] that's going on in our life to draw out
[1:13:21] those things so don't look around and
[1:13:23] for Pete's sake don't look at me and say
[1:13:25] brother John doesn't have any issues I
[1:13:26] got issues every day I've got issues
[1:13:29] I've got attitude issues I've got time
[1:13:32] management issues I've got relational
[1:13:34] issues of course we do every single one
[1:13:36] of us deals with things cuz we're
[1:13:38] growing in Christ but anything I've gone
[1:13:41] through I've learned it's always for
[1:13:43] purpose God's got something at the end
[1:13:45] of it and sometimes the only thing is
[1:13:47] that I can tell somebody else I've been
[1:13:49] where you've been and he brought me
[1:13:50] through it he delivered me from that he
[1:13:52] can heal you from that he can give you
[1:13:54] what you're asking asking for sometimes
[1:13:57] people just need to know there's an
[1:13:58] answer at the end of that tunnel that
[1:14:00] the darkness will give way to light at
[1:14:01] some point sometimes we just need to be
[1:14:04] there to encourage the next one that's
[1:14:05] coming down the exact same path to say
[1:14:07] he's more than able amen he's got us in
[1:14:09] the palm of his hands amen he puts us
[1:14:12] through those things to help the ones
[1:14:13] that are coming behind us to support the
[1:14:15] ones that are around us
[1:14:17] amen and it's to give us Grace for those
[1:14:21] that are where we used to be oh my
[1:14:24] church some sometimes we get so caught
[1:14:26] up in our religious nature and we forget
[1:14:28] there goes I I used to be there or
[1:14:31] sometimes it's there go I but for the
[1:14:33] grace of God and that attitude's got to
[1:14:36] be kept in check and we get dried out
[1:14:38] when we get dried out we get religious
[1:14:41] that's the way it works listen to what
[1:14:42] the prophet of God says he's talking
[1:14:44] about remember he has that experience in
[1:14:45] the diner where there's uh uh you know
[1:14:48] there's there's a cop that's playing the
[1:14:49] slot machines and slot machines are
[1:14:51] illegal in the state so he definitely
[1:14:52] shouldn't be doing it and he's got that
[1:14:54] the cop is got his hands all over this
[1:14:57] woman and there's an old woman that's
[1:14:58] dressed like a prostitute and he says
[1:15:00] Lord why don't you just wipe it off the
[1:15:03] Earth and then he takes him back and he
[1:15:06] sits him down he shows him a vision and
[1:15:07] he shows him what he did and brother
[1:15:10] Brown would say this after all
[1:15:12] this he says it's your attitude towards
[1:15:15] things don't condemn others if they do
[1:15:18] wrong be good to them anyhow just look
[1:15:21] over those things well they ought to
[1:15:23] know better brother John doesn't matter
[1:15:26] you look over those things he says
[1:15:29] because God's had to look over a whole
[1:15:30] lot for you and I he says that's right
[1:15:33] God help us to have that attitude always
[1:15:36] in our hearts he says you pray for me
[1:15:38] that I'll never look upon people like
[1:15:40] that no more no matter what they're
[1:15:42] doing that'll always look up on them
[1:15:44] that they're creatures of God and that
[1:15:46] God sent his son to take their place
[1:15:50] that's the attitude we need to have day
[1:15:51] by day no matter how much that person
[1:15:53] ought to know better say Lord forgive
[1:15:56] them and help them to grow and help them
[1:15:58] to mature and help me to be there to do
[1:16:00] anything I can to help them along the
[1:16:02] way sometimes what we do is we separate
[1:16:05] we need to be there to support Amen to
[1:16:07] look past those things that what's
[1:16:09] that's what maturity looks like is it
[1:16:10] looks past those things as parents we
[1:16:13] look past the shortcomings of our
[1:16:14] children that we can help them grow amen
[1:16:16] that we can teach them that we can bring
[1:16:18] them along the right path of life so
[1:16:20] Esther sees mori's wisdom and she says
[1:16:23] yes this is what it's all been about out
[1:16:25] but watch what she says here she says
[1:16:27] then Esther B them return morai this
[1:16:29] answer go and gather together all the
[1:16:32] Jews that are present in shushan and
[1:16:34] fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink
[1:16:37] three days night or day I also and my
[1:16:39] maidens will Fast likewise and so will I
[1:16:42] go in unto the King which is not
[1:16:44] according to the law and if I perish I
[1:16:49] perish remember what I said even the
[1:16:51] elect couldn't approach God at one time
[1:16:54] God had to come to them but God made a
[1:16:57] provided way Hallelujah God made a
[1:17:00] bridge over the law that could bring us
[1:17:03] into his presence and it's a way of his
[1:17:04] choosing and if you come his way by his
[1:17:07] choosing that's where your Assurance is
[1:17:10] come his provided way says in Esther 51
[1:17:13] it says now came to pass on the third
[1:17:15] day that Esther put on her royal apparel
[1:17:18] and stood in the inner Court of the
[1:17:20] King's house over against the King's
[1:17:21] house and the King sat upon his Royal
[1:17:23] throne in the Royal House house over
[1:17:25] against the Gate of the house I want you
[1:17:27] to see something here lots of women
[1:17:30] could dress up to go before the king but
[1:17:33] only one could dress like a
[1:17:35] queen only one had the king's dress only
[1:17:39] one had the queen King's apparel only
[1:17:41] one had the crown that the king had
[1:17:42] given her everyone could act like a
[1:17:44] queen but there's only one that is the
[1:17:46] queen there's only one bride there's a
[1:17:48] bunch of denominations that are saying
[1:17:50] this is what I think he likes but
[1:17:51] there's only one bride that's got the
[1:17:54] wedding Gard garment on and the wedding
[1:17:56] garment is always his word it's always
[1:17:59] his word she's dressed in his word it's
[1:18:01] his righteousness amen she's the only
[1:18:03] one that that could say my clothes came
[1:18:06] from the king that's the only one that's
[1:18:09] the only one that could say it she's the
[1:18:11] only one that could have the crown given
[1:18:13] to her by the
[1:18:15] king she's the only one that has those
[1:18:17] things everyone might try and please the
[1:18:19] king but she's the only one that's been
[1:18:21] chosen by the king to please him
[1:18:27] amen there's only one
[1:18:29] bride and then there's a lot of
[1:18:31] Pretenders but she's dressed in his word
[1:18:35] and she's got his spirit in her heart
[1:18:36] and that's what makes her pleasing in
[1:18:38] his sight amen why because he's made us
[1:18:41] acceptable I didn't make myself
[1:18:43] acceptable this morning it's not me it's
[1:18:46] his doing it's his making it's his
[1:18:48] spirit it's his clothing it's his Meek
[1:18:50] and Gentle Spirit that's on me that
[1:18:51] makes me acceptable this morning brother
[1:18:54] says this he says the hour has come his
[1:18:56] bride has made herself ready she laid
[1:19:00] aside all of these things now he says
[1:19:03] remember Esther was
[1:19:06] chosen remember the law said only who
[1:19:09] the king chooses Esther was chosen and
[1:19:13] the others were rejected and only those
[1:19:15] that's born again that's got the spirit
[1:19:17] of God will be the chosen that day that
[1:19:19] the Crown of Glory will be set upon her
[1:19:21] head and the others will be rejected
[1:19:25] that's going to be a sad day you missed
[1:19:28] it and you didn't even know what
[1:19:29] happened knocking on the door finally
[1:19:33] find out the truth but you've missed
[1:19:35] your day of visitation that's a horrible
[1:19:38] day Esther comes in and now she's
[1:19:41] dressed in his robe she's got his crown
[1:19:44] on her head she's purified she's his
[1:19:48] chosen bride and watch what happens as
[1:19:50] she comes in now and it was so when the
[1:19:53] king saw Esther the queen standing in
[1:19:55] the court that she obtained favor in his
[1:19:58] sight and the King held out to Esther
[1:20:00] the golden scepter that was in his hand
[1:20:02] and so Esther Drew near and touched the
[1:20:05] top of the scepter Church we're talking
[1:20:07] about Authority by position Esther has a
[1:20:10] position what she forgot was the
[1:20:12] authority that came with it and as soon
[1:20:15] as she comes into as soon as he sees her
[1:20:19] he says to the front of the queue come
[1:20:21] up right now come up my love come up my
[1:20:24] bride come up my queen you can come up
[1:20:26] and talk to me anytime and he extends
[1:20:29] his scepter of grace and mercy you don't
[1:20:33] die when you come into my presence
[1:20:35] you're invited into my presence how I
[1:20:38] missed you being in my
[1:20:40] presence she's all psyched up she's all
[1:20:43] worked up she's had to get all prayed up
[1:20:45] to come into the presence of the king
[1:20:46] and the king is so overjoy to see her
[1:20:49] that he extends a scepter and brings her
[1:20:50] up
[1:20:52] immediately her life was never in danger
[1:20:55] why because she had been chosen by him
[1:20:58] she did not choose him he chose
[1:21:00] her he chose her what was she worried
[1:21:04] about the law of the king said you've
[1:21:06] got to be called and Esther forgot
[1:21:08] you've been called not only have you
[1:21:10] been called you've been chosen you've
[1:21:12] been chosen you've been dressed you've
[1:21:14] been placed you share his bed with him
[1:21:18] you are his wife you are his Queen she
[1:21:20] completely forgot she got so caught up
[1:21:23] on the Old Testament
[1:21:25] that she forgot there was a new
[1:21:26] testament that brought a different path
[1:21:28] why she's in relationship now she's not
[1:21:31] under the law she's in relationship she
[1:21:33] has something that nobody else can claim
[1:21:35] I am the queen I am the wife of the
[1:21:38] king she's sitting there she's saying
[1:21:41] what if he turns me down what if he
[1:21:43] doesn't accept a scepter what if he
[1:21:46] doesn't show me mercy and Grace what if
[1:21:48] he does church that's so often what
[1:21:50] Satan's doing is he's pointing us to the
[1:21:52] law you did this and you did that and
[1:21:54] you you got a pimple here and you got a
[1:21:56] blemish there no you're already accepted
[1:21:58] what if he says yes what if he's already
[1:22:02] said yes what if he's already chosen
[1:22:05] what if you're already accepted and
[1:22:07] nothing you do can take that away so
[1:22:09] often we're waiting to make ourselves
[1:22:11] ready and he's saying I've already made
[1:22:13] you acceptable in the Beloved come into
[1:22:15] my
[1:22:16] presence so often we're wanting to make
[1:22:18] everything right before we come in no
[1:22:20] make it right in his presence come in
[1:22:23] Just the Way You Are
[1:22:25] why he's said you're my chosen bride
[1:22:29] I've accepted you
[1:22:33] amen he loves it when his bride comes to
[1:22:36] him and says Lord I need
[1:22:39] you I need you I want you I have to have
[1:22:43] you there's something that only you can
[1:22:46] do somebody was telling me about the
[1:22:50] that story of the man that came to the
[1:22:51] king and he asked him for a little thing
[1:22:52] and the King said no and then the next
[1:22:54] one came and I'm making up numbers here
[1:22:55] you know maybe one came and said I need
[1:22:57] $1,000 will you give it the king said no
[1:22:59] and then the next one came and said can
[1:23:00] I have $10 million and the King said yes
[1:23:02] and they said why would you give him 10
[1:23:04] million and not the other one the
[1:23:05] Thousand he said because the guy that
[1:23:06] asked 10 million asked me something
[1:23:08] worthy of a
[1:23:09] king sometimes that's all God's wanting
[1:23:11] you to do is recognize what he can do
[1:23:13] for
[1:23:15] you he's not some prime
[1:23:18] minister he's not some present he is
[1:23:20] almighty God and sometimes he just needs
[1:23:24] you to recognize he can do way more than
[1:23:27] you could ever ask or think so ask and
[1:23:31] think of what he can do for
[1:23:35] you Paul said it this way in Romans 8 he
[1:23:37] says we know that all things work
[1:23:39] together for good to them that love God
[1:23:41] to them who are the called the law said
[1:23:44] you had to be the called Church you're
[1:23:45] the called you can impress you can come
[1:23:48] into His presence at any time because
[1:23:51] you're the called according to his
[1:23:53] purpose for whom he did Forno he also
[1:23:56] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:23:58] image of his son that he might be the
[1:24:00] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:24:02] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:24:04] called and whom he called them he also
[1:24:06] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:24:08] also glorified he just keeps doing and
[1:24:10] doing and doing and moving you forward
[1:24:13] and forward and forward and closer and
[1:24:14] closer and closer and it's a finished
[1:24:17] work it's already done it's already done
[1:24:20] in his eyes looking from eternity we are
[1:24:22] perfect we are acceptable in the Beloved
[1:24:25] he says what then What then shall we say
[1:24:27] to these things if God before us who can
[1:24:30] be against us church this is not a
[1:24:32] moment by moment thing this is all the
[1:24:35] time it's already done God is for us
[1:24:37] because he's placed us as a part of his
[1:24:39] word and therefore we don't have to
[1:24:41] worry we don't have to wonder we don't
[1:24:43] have to psych ourselves
[1:24:45] up because that just leads to fear but
[1:24:49] if we can just say he's already accepted
[1:24:51] me and I know he's accepted me because
[1:24:53] of everything he's done in my life so
[1:24:55] far and he's going to finish what he
[1:24:57] started our rest is in the finished work
[1:25:01] not in the ongoing work he starts it and
[1:25:04] that means he's going to finish it but
[1:25:05] it's finished from eternity amen watch
[1:25:08] this
[1:25:10] nature there's a way to approach God and
[1:25:12] we see that Esther shows us that way she
[1:25:15] has authority to enter but she comes in
[1:25:18] meekness yielded to the will of the
[1:25:21] king she has authority to enter but
[1:25:24] she's seeking his will amen we're not
[1:25:28] demanding we're not a a petulant
[1:25:33] housewife we're yielded respectful
[1:25:38] appreciative we think to have authority
[1:25:40] we got to be all just ordering people
[1:25:42] around and do this and do that no to
[1:25:43] have authority we need to find his will
[1:25:46] and then the will of the king is behind
[1:25:48] us and that's our Authority the will of
[1:25:50] the king is what's going to get things
[1:25:51] done in Esther's life not cuz Esther has
[1:25:54] Authority but because the king is behind
[1:25:56] Esther and she stepped into his will and
[1:25:58] his
[1:25:59] way he says what did I say they were in
[1:26:02] the beginning actors he says quit acting
[1:26:05] religion get an old-fashioned experience
[1:26:08] of regeneration and be born again my
[1:26:10] Lord he says he longs to see you he's
[1:26:14] waiting for you he says but he takes the
[1:26:17] little place in the corner and he never
[1:26:19] rebukes you for it he loves
[1:26:22] you he says you go to church once or
[1:26:24] twice a month and you think you've done
[1:26:26] your duty he says oh if you only loved
[1:26:28] him you'd go every night and every day
[1:26:30] somewhere and talk with him if you loved
[1:26:32] him he says but the trouble of it is you
[1:26:34] just act Church act religious he says
[1:26:37] what a Pity it's too bad that we still
[1:26:40] have
[1:26:41] it church if this is the only time we
[1:26:43] spend with
[1:26:45] God something's wrong something is
[1:26:48] seriously wrong you're acting we're
[1:26:52] acting amen
[1:26:54] if this is the only place where the
[1:26:56] Bible is read if this is the only place
[1:26:58] where we sing and worship if this is the
[1:27:00] only place where there's the hearing of
[1:27:02] the word or the reading of the word we
[1:27:03] are
[1:27:05] acting he loves to spend time with you
[1:27:08] brother Braham says he'll sit over there
[1:27:10] in a little corner and wait for you to
[1:27:12] come to
[1:27:12] him he says God you know he says God's a
[1:27:15] gentleman he won't Force his way in
[1:27:19] he'll sit there and he'll wait and he
[1:27:20] won't rebuke you for it but when you
[1:27:22] come into His presence then he'll love
[1:27:23] you for it but the thing is once you get
[1:27:25] a taste of the presence of God Church
[1:27:27] you never want to go back to anything
[1:27:29] else you know why we love special
[1:27:32] meetings is because we get the feeling
[1:27:34] of his presence so many times but that
[1:27:36] doesn't have to happen only in special
[1:27:38] meetings by no means I'm a witness of it
[1:27:42] not to lift myself up but I'm seeing
[1:27:44] nodding heads here because we know what
[1:27:46] it's like to get in the presence of God
[1:27:48] and there everything just melts
[1:27:51] away the worry the fear
[1:27:55] self-
[1:27:57] condemnation sorrow
[1:28:00] disappointment
[1:28:02] depression all of those things they just
[1:28:04] melt away just one touch from
[1:28:07] him they sing that song Sweet Hour of
[1:28:12] Prayer sometimes I think we need to get
[1:28:14] an Hour of
[1:28:15] Prayer when's the last time we prayed
[1:28:17] for an hour where we laid everything
[1:28:20] aside and said Lord I just want to talk
[1:28:22] to you for an hour and and let him talk
[1:28:25] back and wash away those things that
[1:28:27] have been holding us
[1:28:31] back we need to stop acting religious
[1:28:35] church I'm not condemning you I'm not
[1:28:37] saying you're doing it I'm saying let's
[1:28:38] not be found in that place
[1:28:41] amen watch this nature of the king his
[1:28:43] Queen has come before him his chosen
[1:28:44] bride and she's risked her life in her
[1:28:48] mind and the king is like what are you
[1:28:51] worried about come up here come up here
[1:28:54] what would you have of
[1:28:56] me we've talked about Esther's nature
[1:28:59] let's see the nature of the of the
[1:29:01] bridegroom now he says then said the
[1:29:03] king unto her What wilt thou Queen
[1:29:05] Esther and what is thy request it shall
[1:29:08] even be given thee to the half of the
[1:29:11] Kingdom church if that's what a natural
[1:29:13] King will say what does the spiritual
[1:29:15] King say what does the king of kings and
[1:29:17] Lord of lords say he says I'll give you
[1:29:19] half of everything I have if you want
[1:29:22] you want it just ask and it's yours
[1:29:25] if that's the nature of a haist what
[1:29:27] about Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ who gave his life for
[1:29:31] us what would he hold
[1:29:34] back what would he hold
[1:29:38] back it says and Esther
[1:29:40] answered if it seemed good unto the king
[1:29:43] let the king and hmon come this day unto
[1:29:45] the banquet that I have prepared for him
[1:29:48] Esther saved she's alive she's found
[1:29:50] grace and favor and what does she do
[1:29:52] does she fall Weeping at his feet and
[1:29:54] and say you don't know what I've been
[1:29:55] through there's bad people after me I've
[1:29:58] been sick with this for 7
[1:30:00] years no she says you've had a long
[1:30:06] day I want to wash your
[1:30:08] feet I want to take you away from the
[1:30:11] demands of your life I want to be an
[1:30:13] oasis for you I want to worship you I
[1:30:16] want to give you a good
[1:30:18] time just come with
[1:30:20] me and I'll I'll just make it everything
[1:30:24] just wash away let me do something for
[1:30:26] you King let me do something for
[1:30:31] you have you ever noticed in the Lord's
[1:30:33] Prayer it starts with acknowledgement of
[1:30:35] who he is and then it goes into worship
[1:30:39] and it goes into
[1:30:41] thankfulness and then it comes to our
[1:30:44] needs sometimes we're so rushed to get
[1:30:46] to our needs that we stop and forget
[1:30:48] he's God he's worthy of our worship he's
[1:30:51] worthy of Our Praise scripture says I
[1:30:53] will enter his gates with Thanksgiving
[1:30:55] in my heart and I will enter his courts
[1:30:58] with praise that's what Esther's doing
[1:31:00] here let me do something for you let me
[1:31:02] lift you up let me do something that
[1:31:04] benefits you the weight of the state is
[1:31:06] on your shoulders the weight of the
[1:31:07] kingdom is on your shoulders let me wash
[1:31:09] that away I've got a wonderful meal I've
[1:31:12] got a cool place for us to just sit and
[1:31:14] talk for a
[1:31:17] while but BR says it this way he says
[1:31:19] here's a woman that touched His Garment
[1:31:21] she was healed with a blood issue a
[1:31:22] soldier spit in his face face and put a
[1:31:24] crown of thorns on his head and felt no
[1:31:26] virtue he says it's your approach the
[1:31:29] attitude is what it takes we are and
[1:31:32] believe that we are in the presence of
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that
[1:31:36] brings the
[1:31:38] results it's your attitude that brings
[1:31:40] the results the mechanics are here and
[1:31:42] so is the Dynamics he says if you can
[1:31:45] just get started God will do the rest
[1:31:50] how do you get it started church right
[1:31:52] attitude right approach Lord I believe
[1:31:56] you're God lord I believe you've got the
[1:31:58] power Lord I believe you've got the will
[1:32:00] Lord I believe your word and I'm here to
[1:32:02] stand on your word and simple faith will
[1:32:05] start that thing rolling but you've got
[1:32:07] to come with the right attitude so often
[1:32:10] what we
[1:32:11] come my sister the one that's not
[1:32:13] serving the lord she said you know when
[1:32:16] I get to heaven God's got to answer to
[1:32:18] some things for some things to me you
[1:32:21] know what you'll never get to heaven
[1:32:23] with that attitude
[1:32:25] sometimes we're saying Lord you've done
[1:32:27] this to me and you've done this and you
[1:32:28] won't do this and you won't do that you
[1:32:30] know what you don't get anywhere with
[1:32:31] God like
[1:32:33] that be still and know that I'm God my
[1:32:36] ways are higher than your ways my
[1:32:38] thoughts are not like your
[1:32:39] thoughts my ways are not your ways you
[1:32:42] can't come in
[1:32:43] complaining you've got to come in and
[1:32:45] say you are God and I know you've got
[1:32:48] all things in your hand and you got a
[1:32:49] plan and a purpose but you also have a
[1:32:52] word promise and I'm here to claim the
[1:32:54] word promise but help my attitude in the
[1:32:57] meantime help my attitude in the
[1:33:00] meantime we know the story Esther
[1:33:02] prepares a banquet specifically to
[1:33:04] please the king and at the end he asked
[1:33:05] her he says well what do you want nobody
[1:33:08] does this for me unless they want
[1:33:09] something so what do you want she says
[1:33:11] come again tomorrow and we'll do this
[1:33:12] whole thing over again then the next day
[1:33:15] he says to her what do you want and
[1:33:18] here's what she says he says the king
[1:33:20] said to Esther on the second day the
[1:33:21] banquet of wine what is I put ition
[1:33:24] Queen Esther and it shall be granted
[1:33:26] thee and what do I request and it shall
[1:33:28] be performed even to the half of the
[1:33:29] Kingdom he doesn't back away he says
[1:33:31] I'll give you whatever you want all the
[1:33:33] way to the half of the Kingdom we come
[1:33:35] back to our opening scripture in Psalms
[1:33:37] it says for the Lord God is a son and a
[1:33:40] shield newfinland we know all about the
[1:33:42] sun and the shield we need a shield from
[1:33:45] the daily weather and all we want is the
[1:33:47] Sun to get us away from the daily
[1:33:48] weather he says I'm both he says the
[1:33:52] Lord will give Grace and
[1:33:54] Glory no good thing will he withhold
[1:33:58] from them that walk uprightly
[1:34:01] nothing no good thing will he withhold
[1:34:05] what's a good thing something that's in
[1:34:07] his will for your
[1:34:09] good amen says and Esther the queen
[1:34:12] answered and said if I have found favor
[1:34:14] in thy sight oh Queen oh King and if it
[1:34:17] pleased the king let my life be given me
[1:34:19] at my petition and my people at my
[1:34:21] request for we are sold I and my people
[1:34:24] to be destroyed to be slain and to
[1:34:26] perish but if we have been sold for
[1:34:28] bombman and bombom I had held my tongue
[1:34:30] though the enemy could not countervail
[1:34:32] the king's damage I had no clue what
[1:34:34] that was talking about so I had to go to
[1:34:35] the Amplified and what that means there
[1:34:38] it says but if we had been sold for Bond
[1:34:40] men and bond women I would have held my
[1:34:42] tongue for our Affliction is not to be
[1:34:44] compared with the damage that this will
[1:34:47] do to the king so even in all of this
[1:34:49] Esther is saying King your law is going
[1:34:52] to hurt you not just me and I'm worried
[1:34:56] she says if we were just going to be
[1:34:57] sold into slavery I'd have been fine
[1:34:59] with that but we're going to be killed
[1:35:02] and this is going to be the second wife
[1:35:03] that you're going to lose and it's going
[1:35:04] to hurt your reputation she says so I'm
[1:35:07] here to keep your reputation
[1:35:10] intact it's not all about Esther Esther
[1:35:13] says King you've been through a lot you
[1:35:15] don't want to lose another
[1:35:17] wife so I if they were just going to put
[1:35:20] me away that' be fine she says but I'm
[1:35:22] going to lose my life
[1:35:24] and it'll be according to your law it'll
[1:35:26] be your fault and we don't want that you
[1:35:29] don't want that it says then the king of
[1:35:31] haaris answered and said unto Esther the
[1:35:33] queen who is he and where is he that
[1:35:35] does pres presume in his heart to do so
[1:35:39] and Esther said the adversarii and enemy
[1:35:41] is this wicked hmon then hmon was afraid
[1:35:44] before the king and the queen you know
[1:35:45] hmon had everything going right he had
[1:35:48] the king's seal he had the king's law on
[1:35:49] his side he had honor and favor he was
[1:35:52] the prince of princes and then he goes
[1:35:54] and tells his wife I'm invited to a
[1:35:55] banquet for the queen and everything's
[1:35:57] great except for this guy
[1:35:59] morai and she says 'w just build a big
[1:36:01] Gallows 50 cubits High that's about 65t
[1:36:06] uh sorry 75 ft tall that's a big a big
[1:36:09] Gallows she says and then hang Mori on
[1:36:11] that when the day
[1:36:13] comes and so he does that and the
[1:36:15] scripture says his heart was merry I
[1:36:16] think or something like that he's all
[1:36:18] happy but the very night so between
[1:36:20] these two Banquets what happens is the
[1:36:22] king he's something triggers his memory
[1:36:24] and he says didn't somebody help me with
[1:36:26] an assassination a while ago who was it
[1:36:28] that did that and he couldn't remember
[1:36:30] come to find out it was
[1:36:31] morai and so he calls in hmon and he
[1:36:34] says who's around that can tell me what
[1:36:35] to do with this man they say well Hon's
[1:36:37] outside he says brings hmon in he says
[1:36:39] heon what do I do to a man that has
[1:36:40] pleased the king so wonderfully and hmon
[1:36:42] thinks it's all about him he says well
[1:36:44] dress him in your robes and put this on
[1:36:46] him and do that and let him ride the
[1:36:47] king's horse and let him walk through
[1:36:48] the streets and have one of your princes
[1:36:50] you know lead him along and and treat
[1:36:52] him like the king
[1:36:54] so Hon's like thinking he's at the peak
[1:36:57] and things can only get better and the
[1:36:58] King says wonderful go do that to
[1:37:01] Mori and Hon's life just starts to
[1:37:04] unravel
[1:37:06] church so long we're facing things and
[1:37:10] we're dealing with things and it seems
[1:37:12] like it's getting bigger and bigger and
[1:37:15] bigger and nothing can stop it Satan's
[1:37:18] got so much momentum he's got such Dee
[1:37:21] rooted things in our lives and we think
[1:37:22] it's just getting worse and worse and
[1:37:25] worse and in one night in 24 hours hymon
[1:37:29] went to from second in the Kingdom to
[1:37:32] dead in his own
[1:37:35] trap like that when God moves church he
[1:37:39] moves and Nothing Stops God and Hon's
[1:37:44] whole world starts to unravel and so he
[1:37:45] starts his day off by Leading Mori
[1:37:47] through the streets and bringing honor
[1:37:49] and glory to the man that refused to Bow
[1:37:51] the knee to him so then he's like well
[1:37:54] at least I can go to the Queen's banquet
[1:37:56] and then there he finds out that he has
[1:37:59] threatened the Queen's life scripture
[1:38:01] says he he literally jumps on he jumps
[1:38:03] on her to try and plead he's so he's
[1:38:06] just trying to grab onto her to to plead
[1:38:08] for Mercy plead for his life and the
[1:38:10] King walks in with him while he's got
[1:38:11] his hands on the
[1:38:12] queen church God does not take things
[1:38:16] lightly when Satan messes with your life
[1:38:20] he'll allow certain things for a while
[1:38:22] but in the end
[1:38:24] you don't want to be on God's bad side
[1:38:26] and he says take him out what do we do
[1:38:29] they say oh he built these Gallows for
[1:38:30] Mori Mori now now you're going after the
[1:38:33] guy that saved my life and you want my
[1:38:35] queen as well he says just hang him
[1:38:36] there and he hung him right there and
[1:38:39] that was it in one moment Church
[1:38:43] everything gone
[1:38:47] done and we're sitting there saying
[1:38:48] where is God where is God where's my
[1:38:52] authority where's the power get into his
[1:38:56] presence see what he's got to say about
[1:38:58] it and he'll take care of the
[1:39:01] rest but notice now Hon's gone he's the
[1:39:05] henchman he's he's the the ring leader
[1:39:07] of this whole thing but the law is still
[1:39:09] the
[1:39:10] law the law says the Jews can be killed
[1:39:14] the law says that people can go after
[1:39:16] them and take their things and take
[1:39:17] their lives in all of these different
[1:39:19] things the Jews are still under the law
[1:39:21] of death and so Esther comes back and it
[1:39:23] says and Esther spake yet before the the
[1:39:25] king so she comes a day or two later and
[1:39:27] fell down at his feet and besought him
[1:39:29] with tears to put away the Mischief of
[1:39:31] hon the agagite and his device that he
[1:39:33] had devised against the Jews so she
[1:39:36] comes into the king's presence yet again
[1:39:39] it says then the king held out the
[1:39:41] golden scepter towards Esther what does
[1:39:44] the scripture say his mercies are new
[1:39:47] every morning she didn't use up his good
[1:39:50] will she didn't use up all of his love
[1:39:52] and favor and Grace he does the exact
[1:39:54] same thing again amen he says so Esther
[1:39:57] Rose and stood before the king and said
[1:39:59] if it pleased the king and if I have
[1:40:02] found favor in his sight and the things
[1:40:04] seem right before The King and I be
[1:40:06] pleasing in his eyes she says if you
[1:40:08] want it and if you like me and if you
[1:40:11] find me pleasing and if it's in your
[1:40:13] heart to do it she doesn't say this is
[1:40:16] what I want she says if it's your will
[1:40:19] that's what she's saying if it's your
[1:40:20] will she says Let It Be written to
[1:40:22] reverse the letters devised by hmon the
[1:40:24] son of hamadaa the agagite which he
[1:40:27] wrote to destroy the Jews which are in
[1:40:28] all the king's
[1:40:30] Province I want you to catch something
[1:40:33] here because we're all about not we the
[1:40:36] Royal we the thought of adoption is
[1:40:38] we're just going to go around and we're
[1:40:39] going to speak this and speak that and
[1:40:41] speak that but you see this whole
[1:40:42] process and its attitude its approach
[1:40:46] it's the will of God it's knowing the
[1:40:48] time knowing the season knowing the
[1:40:51] purpose right motive right objective
[1:40:53] there's so many things baked into this
[1:40:55] and we want to say that people go down
[1:40:57] the water come out and all of a sudden
[1:40:58] they're going around having adoptive
[1:40:59] power doesn't make any sense doesn't
[1:41:02] make any
[1:41:03] sense Esther is in this for what the
[1:41:07] king thinks best even if it costs her
[1:41:10] something even if it costs her something
[1:41:13] Church Brothers I can guarantee you
[1:41:15] you're going to have to pay a price for
[1:41:16] serving Christ sisters you have to pay a
[1:41:19] price for serving Christ and sometimes
[1:41:21] we've just got to say that goes with the
[1:41:24] role that's it his will is greater than
[1:41:27] my will his vision is more than my
[1:41:29] vision his thoughts are higher than my
[1:41:32] thoughts we don't go in and use this
[1:41:35] just because brother Bram says this he
[1:41:38] says see we don't use the gift of God
[1:41:40] for commercial
[1:41:41] gain we look at all these Ministries and
[1:41:44] what are they trying to do grow big
[1:41:45] churches get more money get bigger
[1:41:48] programs get more influence and it
[1:41:50] usually comes down to money the scpt
[1:41:53] scripture says the love of money is the
[1:41:54] root of all evil we don't use what God
[1:41:57] gives us for commercial gain if I'm
[1:41:59] behind this Pulpit to make money I need
[1:42:02] to be
[1:42:03] out if this church never paid me a
[1:42:06] salary I should still be
[1:42:08] here because I'm not in it for the
[1:42:10] money he says we don't use the gift of
[1:42:13] God for commercial gain no no he says he
[1:42:15] could tell me where I was at but I don't
[1:42:16] have any need of it he's talking about
[1:42:18] oil in Kentucky and he says there's oil
[1:42:20] in those Hills and they said well
[1:42:21] brother brandom tell us where it is and
[1:42:23] then we'll go and we'll start an oil
[1:42:25] company and we'll give you royalties off
[1:42:27] of that place and we can do we can fund
[1:42:29] your campaigns and you won't ever have
[1:42:30] to worry about it he says no we don't do
[1:42:32] this for commercial gain I'm not here to
[1:42:35] make money just because he says see he
[1:42:38] says I wouldn't even have faith enough
[1:42:40] to ask him see if I had a need of it I
[1:42:43] believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me but
[1:42:45] first you see your motives and
[1:42:47] objectives have to be right you have to
[1:42:49] have reasons for this God doesn't give
[1:42:52] you those things just because you ask
[1:42:56] he's not a doting grandfather remember
[1:42:57] how many times would the prophet of God
[1:42:59] say that he's not a doting grandfather
[1:43:01] kids love to go to Grandma and grandpas
[1:43:03] n and Pops don't they because they get a
[1:43:05] lot more than they get at their mother
[1:43:08] and father's house God isn't that way he
[1:43:12] says God doesn't give you those things
[1:43:14] just because you ask and you cannot ask
[1:43:16] in faith unless there's a real objective
[1:43:18] to that to be in the will of God
[1:43:23] now that narrows it down quite a bit
[1:43:24] doesn't it John would say we know that
[1:43:27] we ask him anything he'll give it to us
[1:43:29] if we ask it in his
[1:43:31] will Prophet says see if you want to be
[1:43:34] well what do you want to be well
[1:43:37] for he says if you want to be healed
[1:43:39] what's the reason you want to be healed
[1:43:41] what are you telling God what do you
[1:43:42] want to do with your life when you get
[1:43:44] healed see you've got to have a motive
[1:43:47] and objective and they have to be right
[1:43:49] according to the will of God he says and
[1:43:51] that's when the faith is revealed to you
[1:43:54] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[1:43:56] that faith in there then it's
[1:44:01] over watch Esther
[1:44:04] now she's saying How Can I Endure to see
[1:44:07] the evil that shall come upon my people
[1:44:09] or How Can I Endure to see the
[1:44:10] destruction of my Kindred she says I
[1:44:12] can't endure it this will be too much
[1:44:15] but she has said if it's in your will
[1:44:17] then make it go away Jesus said the same
[1:44:20] thing let this cup pass
[1:44:23] but nevertheless not my will but thine
[1:44:25] be done we see the exact same nature in
[1:44:27] the bride here I don't want to go
[1:44:29] through this but if that's what you want
[1:44:31] I'll go through it I don't think I can
[1:44:33] do it but I'll go through it it says
[1:44:36] then the king of hasar said unto Esther
[1:44:38] the queen and Mori the Jew behold I have
[1:44:41] given Esther the house of hmon and him
[1:44:43] have they hanged upon the Gallows
[1:44:45] because he laid his hand upon the Jews
[1:44:47] we're speaking about Authority by
[1:44:48] position now here's your Authority write
[1:44:52] ye also for the Jews as it liketh you
[1:44:57] that means write whatever you
[1:45:00] want speak whatever you want I've given
[1:45:04] you authority to correct the
[1:45:06] situation speak and go
[1:45:11] forward he says write ye also for the
[1:45:14] Jews as it liketh you in the king's name
[1:45:18] and seal it with the king's ring what
[1:45:20] does the scripture say let all that we
[1:45:22] do be done in in the name of Jesus
[1:45:26] Christ that's not a a catch all
[1:45:30] phrase you know there's that song that
[1:45:31] says I speak Jesus you better make sure
[1:45:34] Jesus wants to be in that situation in
[1:45:35] the way that you're talking about
[1:45:37] because it's not this willy-nilly
[1:45:39] thing where we just go around and start
[1:45:41] rubber stamping things in the name of
[1:45:42] Jesus in the name of Jesus we need to go
[1:45:44] into the presence of Jesus to find out
[1:45:47] if it's in his name or not but he says
[1:45:48] you've come in and I'm telling you that
[1:45:51] what you want to do is in my will so now
[1:45:53] he says go and do it in my name go and
[1:45:56] do it in my name with the king's Ring he
[1:45:59] says for the writing which is written in
[1:46:01] the king's name and sealed with the
[1:46:03] king's Ring May no man reverse I was
[1:46:05] listening to be certain of God and he
[1:46:07] says that God he he says when you have
[1:46:09] met his requirement you have met his
[1:46:12] obligation when you have cleaned
[1:46:14] yourself up everything that Esther did
[1:46:16] he says then he says God obligates
[1:46:19] himself to his word
[1:46:23] to his word you've met his requirement
[1:46:25] now he meets his requirement amen and
[1:46:29] what is it his word is a benefit to us
[1:46:34] always and so Mori wrote in the king of
[1:46:36] haar's name and sealed it with the
[1:46:39] king's ring and sent Letters by posts on
[1:46:40] Horseback Riders on mules camels and the
[1:46:42] young dromedaries he says wherein the
[1:46:45] king granted the Jews which were in
[1:46:47] every city to gather themselves together
[1:46:49] and to stand for their life to destroy
[1:46:52] and to slay and to cause to
[1:46:54] perish you know what that's three ways
[1:46:57] of saying your
[1:46:59] toast destroy slay and cause to perish
[1:47:02] to me they all mean the same thing
[1:47:04] obviously they don't to God three
[1:47:05] different things all the power of the
[1:47:08] people and province that would assault
[1:47:09] them both little ones and women and to
[1:47:12] take the spoil of them for prey this is
[1:47:14] not just defense now church this is
[1:47:17] offense because the law is there that's
[1:47:19] saying you can kill the Jews now he
[1:47:21] gives a law to the Jews saying you can
[1:47:22] can kill anybody that would want to come
[1:47:24] against
[1:47:26] you no weapon that is formed against
[1:47:30] thee shall prosper every place that the
[1:47:34] soul of your foot shall tread belongs to
[1:47:38] you one of you shall chase a thousand
[1:47:42] the Jews are outnumbered the Jews are
[1:47:44] outnumbered but he gives them a law that
[1:47:47] says you don't have to take it you can
[1:47:50] choose to stay under the law and die or
[1:47:52] you can step into my grace and
[1:47:55] favor and you can destroy the works of
[1:47:57] the devil your
[1:48:02] choice jump down to verse 16 Church what
[1:48:05] happens when we get Grace the Jews had
[1:48:08] light and gladness and joy and
[1:48:13] honor says and in every Province and in
[1:48:15] every city withersoever the king's
[1:48:17] commandment and his decree came the Jews
[1:48:19] had joy and gladness a feast and a good
[1:48:22] day and many of the people of the land
[1:48:24] became Jews for the fear of the Jews
[1:48:27] fell upon them they got converts to this
[1:48:31] when they saw the grace and favor of the
[1:48:34] king what did he say to the disciples go
[1:48:36] you onto all the world and preach the
[1:48:38] gospel in my name you cast out devils
[1:48:41] and lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:48:42] recover do all these things what are
[1:48:44] they doing they're showing the grace and
[1:48:46] favor of the god the king that's behind
[1:48:48] them
[1:48:49] amen hmon thought he'd use the law
[1:48:51] against God's chosen people people God
[1:48:53] said I'm going to fulfill the law and
[1:48:55] I'm going to give them a Grace law that
[1:48:57] allows them to overcome everything that
[1:48:59] you place in front of them but I want
[1:49:02] you to finish this verse this morning as
[1:49:04] we start to
[1:49:06] close we saw that scripture and we we
[1:49:09] attributed it to hmon it says moreover
[1:49:12] the law entered that the offense might
[1:49:14] abound he says but where sin abounded
[1:49:17] Grace did much more abound I've got lots
[1:49:22] of problems brother John I've got
[1:49:23] situations I got issues in my life yeah
[1:49:25] there's Grace though that's bigger than
[1:49:28] that we sing that song greater than all
[1:49:30] my sin is the blood that still
[1:49:34] cleanses is the blood that still sets me
[1:49:36] free to do what worship him to come into
[1:49:38] His presence there's an abounding Grace
[1:49:41] that's offered this morning and your
[1:49:43] Authority is to come in and say I'm here
[1:49:44] for Grace brother B would say have you
[1:49:47] met Grace have you met Grace this
[1:49:50] morning or as hyon as the law sitting
[1:49:52] they're saying you're not
[1:49:54] worthy You Can't Raise Your Hands In
[1:49:56] Worship You can't come up for prayer you
[1:49:59] can't claim the promise because the law
[1:50:00] says you're not worthy or do you say
[1:50:03] he's extended that scepter of
[1:50:06] unmerited unwarranted you don't deserve
[1:50:09] it favor and said come in anyways and
[1:50:13] take what is freely given to you amen
[1:50:16] we're under the authority of Grace now
[1:50:18] church and our position brings us into a
[1:50:21] place to expect that it will
[1:50:25] abound abound above which we could ask
[1:50:28] above what we could think do you ever
[1:50:30] notice the second time that Esther comes
[1:50:31] in she doesn't have to psych herself up
[1:50:33] she doesn't have to fast for three days
[1:50:35] she doesn't have to lay everything aside
[1:50:37] she just knows now I'm chosen I'm
[1:50:40] accepted I'm the Beloved and she walks
[1:50:43] in in humility and bows at his feet and
[1:50:46] she gets an immediate audience and I
[1:50:49] don't believe Esther ever had a problem
[1:50:50] going into the king's presence again
[1:50:53] sometimes you got to get past that first
[1:50:54] little
[1:50:56] barrier amen when I gave my heart to the
[1:51:00] Lord I felt unworthy and since then I
[1:51:03] have felt unworthy so many times cuz I
[1:51:07] fail myself much less him but yet his
[1:51:12] mercies are new every single morning and
[1:51:15] I am bidden I am
[1:51:17] invited I am compelled remember Church
[1:51:21] we're not the you know the you got the
[1:51:23] the parable of the of the wedding supper
[1:51:25] where were in the highways and the
[1:51:27] byways we were in the hedges and the
[1:51:28] ditches he is literally dragging us into
[1:51:31] his
[1:51:32] presence why are we fighting we've got
[1:51:35] authority to go in by his
[1:51:39] invitation enter ye into the joy of your
[1:51:44] lord Esther learned that law didn't
[1:51:47] apply to her she was in a Grace
[1:51:49] relationship now and she could come in
[1:51:51] any time with any
[1:51:53] need and he'd have an answer for her
[1:51:56] might not be the answer she wanted but
[1:51:58] he'd have an answer for her every single
[1:52:00] time and it would be for her benefit
[1:52:03] let's stand as we read one last
[1:52:07] scripture James 4:6 says this but he
[1:52:12] giveth see grace we we think grace is
[1:52:15] enough because Grace isn't warranted
[1:52:17] Grace is not deserved but he says he
[1:52:19] gives more grace and more grace and more
[1:52:23] grace and more Grace it's tied to Mercy
[1:52:25] we don't deserve it but we can have at
[1:52:27] any time it says wherefore he saith God
[1:52:30] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[1:52:32] unto the humble submit yourselves
[1:52:35] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[1:52:37] will flee from you draw nigh to God and
[1:52:41] He will draw nigh to
[1:52:44] you he says cleanse your hands ye
[1:52:47] Sinners purify your hearts ye
