hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves and one be at one place and one another but right in the heat of the day the sheep will all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shades one for the other they're having fellowship and wouldn't it be good if all god's sheep when the heat was all would stand together [Applause] and the trials are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere if all of god's little sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shade of each other the comfort to lean upon each other now someone says is that necessary brother branham it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing the heat song you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them talk it over and personal confidence and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good god-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in or it's good to do that come let us reason together saith the scriptures or come let us stand together okay the children are going to be playing i've got peace like a river on the boom whackers oh [Music]

now we're into our regular service so let's uh let's sing he's ever interceding this morning and i'm going to ask by the mark just to open in prayer and i want to continue to remember of course remember brother john as he brings the word this morning and [Music] also remember the saints of course around the island around the world today those in ukraine especially we just continue to pray for them i remember also sister amber and family also brother everett back in hospital again so we just remember him he did have a fall as well and so i guess to get some things to work out there so we want to remember about a revert this morning and and the family i remember those that are traveling sister and selena corsister justine and all the other saints that are going back from the meetings which will be over sometime this morning and they'll be traveling so god bless them and deliver them safely remember also sister darlene as well and brother ellie welcome brother kingsley good to see you again amen and sister cordella also like just take a minute i have a last week we prayed for brother and edmonton brother lowell beaton uh i've told you about that him and i were in constant contact and he called me last night and he was pretty emotional if you recall he had cancer up here in the cheekbone as i was talking about he's got a hole came into that into that bone and it was cancer it's cancerous and he had gone to the doctor the doctor said look there's only one way we can deal with this and he said that is through surgery and he had gone through a similar surgery in the past he said i'm not doing that again and so he told the doctor forget it i'm not doing it and [Music] he so he said okay what he said i'll see if i can work up some radiation maybe that will help and he said okay well let me know and that's where it ended and that's where we prayed and i know there were a lot of other believers praying for him so he he called me uh he called me last night and he said remember we were talking about this last week i said yeah i said i've been praying for you and i said i brought it to the church and the church has been praying for you and he said yeah when he said god has answered prayer and so his story is this that he was on the way home a couple of nights ago and he's he said they had uh he was he was coming home from work he stopped at a restaurant to pick up some food for him and his wife and while he was in the lineup waiting he felt something funny in his mouth and he wiped his hand over his mouth like that and it was all blood and he got afraid he said what's what's this all about so he got out of the lineup and he went into the washroom and he he wiped his mouth again and it was all blood and uh he then he felt something really strange in his mouth and uh he he tugged on it he said it was just like flesh and he he ended up spitting it into the into this into the sink and he said it was a four inch long piece of flesh by an inch and a half wide he figured and he said he kept bleeding he flushed that down the toilet he kept believing he went up and got in his car went over to another part of the parking lot now in the meantime one other one other step there that i just remembered is that he told me last week he said the doctor said the pain would would increase and he said your pain would be constant and it was and he said we got a prayer service tonight that during the week and he said uh he wanted to go to the prayer service or should he go to the hospital so he went over to another part of the parking lot where there was no people around and he took a glass a bottle of water and he just started swishing it around and he said the bleeding stopped and he said what he noticed was that the pain was gone and he said he said it's gone he said i feel 100 better so he went he said do i go to the hospital or do i go to church for the prayer meeting guess what he went to church for the prayer meeting and so i said well you know that's an absolute miracle because the doctor said we can't do anything for you unless you take surgery so he had cut that off right he said i'm not doing it so so then he sends me a quote he said i came across this quote and i i thought it was really appropriate um [Music] and this applies to everyone it doesn't apply only to cancer in my opinion it's this applies to everything that we that we we go through we suffer through here's the quote it comes out of awakening jesus it was a 1963 message he said let us remember that he created our bodies he said won't our bodies obey his command he said spit out that cancer he said to them he said to the body and away it goes he said you just take that word and plant it here and he said see what happens he said our bodies have to obey his command and that's something perfect confirmation and i thought you know wow we could spit out our arthritis we could spit out our headaches and our back back problems i think because with god in us our body has to obey that command right it has to go that's what happened on calvary right that's why jesus went to the cross that's why he took those stripes on his back brother john made that pretty clear the other night and that's that's what this is about the victory is ours we just got to remember that right brother branham said in the same message he said he said we have the authority to talk to the devil depart get away from me right leave us alone right i thought it was just a real blessing and i i will hold on to that by the grace of god amen let's sing it he's ever interceding [Music] and he's ever interceding [Music] to the father for his children yes he's never interested [Music] to the father for his own hallelujah through him amen [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] to the father for his own hallelujah through him you can reach the father so bring him on [Music] [Music] so come only hallelujah thank you jesus amen thank you lord hallelujah heavenly father we're thankful again lord that we can intercede with you lord and then come more boldly in the throne lord where was forbidden one time now lord we're commanded to go into your

[Music] lord you're rising from the grave heavenly father lord and it's lord your prophet said it wasn't enough that you laid your life down but you had to pick it up again and lord we're so thankful that we serve a risen savior this morning lord and not a risen savior just to the pages of the bible that we read or ministry of a prophet in this age or but we're thankful that he's alive and well inside of us and lord we want to lift you up this morning lord we want to thank you and praise you lord that you didn't just go down but you picked up again your life heavenly father and lord you promised that you do the very same thing in ours lord jesus lord we pray that you would just move in our services morning lord that our ears would be quick to hear not what i say lord but lord may the holy spirit use this this broken vessel heavenly father lord that the people would be encouraged corrected lord that they be drawn closer to you this morning heavenly father lord that there will be deliverance that there will be healing that there will be grace that there will be love peace rest joy lord that you will be made full in our lives we pray this morning lord god lift up fallen hands lord forgive us where we fall short lord and i fall very short lord i pray you forgive me lord use me now lord may you bless your people that are under the hearing of this word this morning we pray lord both here and online remember brother ellie as well lord as he's away ministering lord may you make him a blessing to the people there we ask and pray lord jesus lord we pray your grace now for this service and each one in jesus christ's name we ask and pray amen amen god bless you if you'll turn in the scriptures to john chapter 14 i'm in john chapter 14. certainly good to be in the house of the lord this morning and a bit of a different service and we're starting late but it's all just relax amen we've got nowhere to go nowhere to be there's no schedule we're not legalists amen we're just going to preach the word this morning so just pull on the gift and then get behind the preaching of the word and we trust that god will move in the service amen amen amen i was up late last night i got not feeling so well this morning got quite a headache going on we stayed up late watching the camp services in louisiana and and whatnot and it's a wonderful time and we're so thankful for god amen moving down there the way that he did but we don't want to leave it in louisiana camp amen the same god that's theirs the same god that's here i don't have to be ron spencer or donny reagan amen you don't have to be a youth all we're looking for is believers that will hear the holy spirit speaking and act on it amen that's what we're here for this morning john 14 and verse 16 says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me and because i live ye shall live also amen may god bless his word this morning you may be seated i want to take a resurrection title this morning of because i live you shall live also amen and then setting up this scene here in the scriptures we want to remember when this was said and this is jesus and he's sitting up in the upper room and they've they've gone through the passover meal and he's already washed their feet and he's already told judas go and do what you're going to do and then he had to clear the room of unbelief is what he had to do he had to get that man out so jesus could share some truth of what's coming down the road not only for him but he's also sharing the promises of the believer with the believers amen and if we go back to john 14 and start at verse 12 we see that wonderful promise so hold your scriptures there if you would in john 14 because jesus is what we call in the vision right now amen he's he he's tapped himself into the word he knows the events that have to happen and he knows that he's got to prepare his disciples for what's coming and so he's giving them the gospel now before it's ever made manifest before they ever know the reality of it yet he's giving them the good news and that's that i'm not going to leave you comfortless i will come to you amen and they have no idea what that means i i marvel so often that that the disciples could have what we would call plain speech given to them and yet they had no understanding of what it meant and it reminded me of what brother marcus said you know that that it takes the the manifestation of the god for you to understand what the word of god actually meant amen he brings it to pass and then he says this is that what i was talking about amen so this is the good news that jesus is sharing with them and in john 14 verse 12 it says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go into my father and we read the quote yes on friday night and the prophet of god is quick to tell us that doesn't mean we're going to do more amazing works than jesus christ but he says because i'm going because my ministry is only three and a half years you're going to do more you're going to do more by number you're there's there's there's dozen of you and then there's going to be hundreds and thousands and we look even at the ministry of brother branham you know over 30 odd years no doubt that he had more miracles than jesus did we look at some of these these uh these campaigns he went through and they bring out you know wheelchairs and crutches by the truckloads and just truckloads of people that were healed just walking through these these prayer lines and the things that they did so jesus ministry was cut short but he says my ministry is not going to stop when i leave amen but it's going to be evident in the lives of the believers because you're going to do the same works that i do even here amen but the key to this is founding in what believing on christ amen it is not found just on believing in a prophet because he's a representation of christ he's bringing the word of christ but you have to make sure that you're moving into a life with christ not just receiving the word of malachi 4. because eliezer introduced rebecca to isaac amen that's who we were supposed to fall in love with so we've got to move past that message and let it come into us so that we can have a relationship with the one that sent the message in the first place amen because the message was to call a bride to jesus christ amen it wasn't just cause her to stand up and take notice but it was to bring her to her bridegroom this morning amen amen believing in brother branham won't work we don't pray to him and then believing in a prophet is not enough you've got to believe that he was a word prophet and you got to see yourself in the time that you're in so that when he says awake awake the bridegroom's coming you wake up and you get yourself ready and guess what makes you ready the voice of the angel in your age that's what's going to get you to get ready the right way amen but you've got to grow in grace with christ not with a prophet amen and that's where we see so many today especially you know in jeffersonville and that is they're growing into a relationship with a prophet and they're tied to a prophet and christ is nowhere in it because they're too busy looking at the voice rather than the one that was behind the voice amen amen but if you truly believe in jesus christ then jesus himself says the works of christ must come through in your life it's not optional but it must come through in your life and in verse 13 he says and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son so a notice of future tense it's coming but it's not here yet is what he's saying amen be ready look for it be an expectation and so we want to be an expectation if we recognize what's coming our way man if you recognize that this is the time for something to be fulfilled be an expectation for that to be fulfilled amen don't put your head in the sand don't don't dull your ears but rather be ready and waiting and expecting for god to move in your situation and in your life in the way that he said it but i love how jesus says what that the father may be glorified when you ask things in his name the glory is supposed to go to god it's not supposed to go to me it's not supposed to go to you but the father is supposed to be glorified so it's our prayer to raise ourself up there's our prayer to raise christ up and keep us down where we belong humble at the feet of calvary amen he says if you love or if you ask anything in my name i will do it he's pointing to the future he's telling them this is coming there's coming a day where you're asking my name and i'll do anything you ask me amen it's an amazing promise and it's not just to them it's but to everyone that believes and receives the comforter that he promised he says if you love me keep my commandments and remember jesus said it all hinged on two commandments love the lord thy god with all thy heart soul and mind that's where we start is that we place him in the highest place amen that he is our worship he is our praise he receives the glory out of our lives but he says the second one is that you love your neighbor as yourself and let me tell you if you'll put god first and you love your man and the and the woman next to you the same way that you love yourself you'll come true every time because selfishness cannot exist when you love god first and you love everybody else equally to yourself it will take education out it will take self-preservation out it will take selfishness out and it'll move you into a channel where god can use you amen what is it when you'll come out every time because when you love god and you love your neighbor as yourself it kills selfishness dead in his track every time it kills carnality amen you can't do all those things if you're loving god and loving the other person as much as yourselves amen it's impossible you can't even be drawn away by your own lusts when you love the person next to you when you love your neighbor when you love your brother and sister as much as yourself because what you're doing is you're saying that's lust is for you right you can't be drawn of lust when you're looking out for the believers that are around you amen and you're giving first place to god verse 16 says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth we've got a lot of truth floating around in the world don't we the spirit of truth is not the woke movement is it but the spirit of truth catch this is not the anti-walk movement either right because everybody's there and they're trying to say we're right you're wrong we're right you're wrong they're trying to prove each other wrong and that has nothing to do with anything amen that's just a movement and an anti-movement but the spirit of truth is something else him and the spirit of truth is a life right it is not words it is a life and we're sitting there and how many words are going out through our lips sometimes and it has nothing to do with the spirit of truth amen because a spirit is alive it is living it is not just the words that come out of your mouth amen even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive if the word is receiving your message it is not from the spirit of truth it cannot be the spirit of truth because the world cannot receive it because they don't have the spirit that you have within you and if your spirit is linking up with their spirit it is a spirit from hell i will say it straight if your spirit is joining with their spirit two of you have the wrong spirit because the world cannot receive the spirit of truth amen because it seeth him not neither doesn't know him amen but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and until he dwells with you you don't know him you know him by intellect you know him by church experience you know him by emotion but you do not know him until you see him in your life and you say this is that amen that this is what he was talking about and it is not just in my head and i don't move from side to side from day to day but this is that which he spoke and i'm anchored to eternity amen hallelujah amen the spirit of truth will dwell within you it is not just in your mouth but it is in your everyday life amen amen the spirit of truth was right there with him it was veiled in jesus christ showing the life that they were supposed to be living amen he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you that's a personal pronoun you can't fit this through the trinity because he said the father's going to be with you the father's going to buy with you forever then he says then the spirit of truth is going to come which is the holy spirit and then he says i'll be with you you've got the father holy spirit and jesus christ all saying they're going to be there how do you fit three into that it's all one in the same person isn't it you can't fit the trinity through that he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you and yet a little while and the world sees me no more why because the corporal body's gonna go but you see me that is ever present you see me now you will see me tomorrow and you will see me all the way until you leave this earth because i live you shall live also not there today he's pointed the future he says you might think you're alive you've had power over demons you've had miracles following your ministries maybe you've converted people but he says you're not even alive yet but you're going to be alive at some point amen and it's because i live that you're going to live as well amen and jesus we have this beautiful finish he says because i live you shall live also and they had no clue what he was talking about i'm sure their ears perked up that's amazing what is that going to look like what is that going to mean why don't we have it right now we've spent all this time with them we've taken the persecution we've been associated with them we've had signs and wonders following what more could he give us but we see what happened as as christ was going through all of the tribulations before he went to the crucifixion and they ran away scared didn't they they ran away they denied him so the life couldn't be there because it cannot deny itself he can't deny us we can't deny him amen oh sometimes i wonder if we aren't the same way it's so often black and white and yet we don't know what's going on amen amen god interprets his word by bringing it to peace and we have the knowledge today we have all the knowledge we'll ever need amen but what we're looking for is a word that can come to pass to us by what the spirit of truth living inside of us amen like peter on the day of pentecost he'd step out and he'd say this is that which was written in joel they didn't know what that meant in joel nobody had a fulfillment of that in joel and then peter comes out and he says this thing that you think is us being drunk he says this is that what you were talking about paul said what the thing that is called heresy is the thing that is the truth right this is that amen but paul would do things that nobody else could do why because he had found the truth and even though they recognized it as heresy he said this is the truth and it has an effect on my life that i never had while i was under the truth reading the scrolls i was a pharisee among pharisees but until he got the spirit of truth inside of him he was dead in his sins amen amen amen the prophet of god says something about this scripture that just brought it to life to me brother brahm says this he says all of his teaching all of his works all of his miracles died with them if he didn't raise from the dead because what that was to pay a price but the thing is after the price is paid that doesn't give us the ability to live the life that just means the price is paid but we can't move forward from there you're stuck in limbo your price is paid he doesn't see any sin but you can't overcome amen he says what but if he's risen from the dead friends you people will see someday that the very chief cornerstone has been rejected by the builders that's right jesus has risen from the dead and if he's here tonight he can do just the same he works through people do you want him to work through you he says now he can't unless you believe a minister said to me said brother branham i don't care what would take place i wouldn't believe it i said it's not for unbelievers it's for believers amen what did paul say he said if after the first or second admonition they don't take it reject he says don't waste your time move on to the next one because maybe the next one will he says they didn't believe jesus and they surely won't believe a servant can you imagine jesus is walking through nain and they've got a funeral procession and he walks up and he raises a man from the dead he goes to lazarus and raises him from the dead though he's been dead for three four days raises him up out of the tomb and yet they still could not believe that that was god in flesh they couldn't believe it was the true messiah so brother rahm says if they won't believe that then how are they ever going to believe you unless the spirit of god is in them to be quickened in the first place he says see these signs shall follow them that believe not unbelievers believers what did jesus say these signs shall follow them that believe the test for the ages will you believe what is brought to you and then will you act on it not just say it in your head but belief did what did james say show me your faith by your works if your faith doesn't bring any works with it it's dead right so you've got to act on what you believe so the thing is we are not to say amen only but we are to be amen amen because when you say amen you're saying so be it in me so you're not just saying now amen brother john amen brother jail amen brother mark amen brother ron amen brother donny but you're saying be in me what he's saying is what you're saying when you raise your hands and say amen right you're saying let it be in me not just in my brother not just in my sister but amen is for me amen let me live out the word let me live by the word let me live through the word let me reflect the word talk is cheap anybody can sit here and say amen anybody can sit under the hearing of the word of god and say that sounds good amen but i've learned a long time ago that those that talk a lot rarely walk the walk because what remember what james talked about the tongue he says a man that can't bridle it his religion is vain right when all you can do is talk you can't hear and so often today silences they say silence is golden and you know what it takes to be quiet to recognize that somebody else has something more worthy to say than you do and then when you meet god you'll realize that you bring nothing to the table when it comes to words amen you bring nothing to the table in terms of wisdom in terms of bringing people to a reality amen when you walk the walk it has a way of humbling you it has to humble you amen brother braham said humility is power with god and how are you going to move on into the power of god if you lack humility amen i've had to learn that so many times the hard way and i'm still learning today man but if there's anything the word does to a believer is it humbles you amen that's the first thing he's got to do because you've got to humble yourself and repent how can you repent if you don't think you're wrong right that's the first humbling is repentance because i've lived the wrong way thinking or wanting to do that way amen what is it the greater the influence and control of the word in your life the more you realize how truly insignificant you are compared to him in your flesh in your flesh right does anyone anyone go up to god and give him advice anybody done that recently no sometimes we do when we tell them how to answer our prayers but we don't go up and say god you know and in this situation i feel you should really do this how arrogant will we consider ourselves if we did that but yet we talk all the time and many times what we're doing is we're keeping him from speaking and flowing through our life amen you realize that very quickly as a believer you can't do what you need to do in this life and so you need to be quiet and let him do the talking in it amen but jesus promised that he would rise again and in that resurrection the true church would live by the very same life that he lived his life by and the life that he continues to live his life by amen but the life of christ had to cross over to us and this is where we get into where brother mark was trampling all over the sermon amen as brother mark pointed out the blood of an animal couldn't pay the price because the blood of an animal doesn't carry the life of a human that's why it was no good it could cover for a year but it could not pay the price and more importantly that life could not transfer to us that was the purpose of death was that life could come to the one that received the price paid amen but when christ died he was human just like us and so the the blood the the life of the blood could cross over in john 19 33 it says but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came out there blood and water so there's only in debt that life can be transferred when it comes to sin if the sacrifice doesn't die then there's no transference of life there can't be right one has to die that another can't live but this wasn't a blood covering only now amen this was a price paid forever because the lamb that was killed the bulls that were killed the turtle doves and these different things they were just taking our place temporarily but when a light for like sacrifice is made then the price is paid forever if it's a worthy sacrifice and we know of course that christ was a worthy sacrifice and so it would erase the debt forever erase the debt forever past present and future when he died he erased all sin that was it the price was paid and all that's left for us to do is to accept it amen the record doesn't even exist that's how that's how complete this was was the record didn't doesn't even exist when they covered it with the blood of a land for 4 000 years all they did was they kicked the sim bucket down the road and the bucket kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger it never resolved it it just kept moving it down the road amen amen so you say as we said last service god can do anything god can't remember your sins that are under the blood of christ amen he can't remember them because they don't even exist that's how complete the blood of christ works amen so when you talk to him and say i did it again lord i'm sorry he says did what again well i did such and such he says you've never done that before yeah i did i did it last week no no you didn't what are you talking about he can't remember it the god that knows all things can't remember your sin when it's under the blood so don't remind him about it put it under the blood and move on don't remind him of your brother or sister's sins either because they're supposed to be under the blood as well amen if we can put it that way amen can you imagine though the frustration of satan because satan under the blood of bulls and goats he can go before christ he can go before god and he can what accuse the brethren because there's only a covering there god knows there's sin under there but he can't do anything about it but satan can remind him and god can't check him from that god can just say the price has been paid there there's a covering for it so i'm not going to do anything and satan can keep saying well he did this and she did that and god says they did but the blood covers it so i'm not going to do anything about it but when christ died now satan comes up and he says brother john did such and such and and christ and god says no he didn't yes he did i saw him with my own eyes no he didn't do it what do you talk about i have video of it no he didn't do it check your video he looks at the video there's nothing on it why because the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin it doesn't just cover it wipes it away and we stand spotless in christ righteousness amen satan is getting so frustrated because he keeps trying to remind god of our sins and there's nothing there he has no proof and if there's no proof then there can be no penalty amen why when god looks at us all he sees is the righteousness of christ we are sinless perfect right now in the eyes of god amen we go to what brother mark was talking about on the new birth and nicodemus in john 3 3 says jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god now we know the new birth requires two things water and spirit to be the new deal you can't just have one and you can't just have the other and you can't get one without the other either if i could put it that way you can't get the spirit unless you go through water baptism amen there's a process for going through these things amen remember we're preaching on because i live you shall live also amen and that means the source of life that we're living by has to be the same as his right as brother brahm said if he isn't alive we wouldn't be alive either as believers we couldn't live as believers right we'd be flawed humans we'd stay as flat humans but now we've got a life that allows us to overcome things that they could never overcome before but says when jesus died at calvary what elements came from his body water blood spirit is that right now any minister any believer knows that that's what constitutes the new birth is that right that constitutes a new birth saint john first john 5 7 there are three that bear record of water blood and spirit and when they pierced aside water and blood came forth came out and he said into thy hands i commit my spirit he put it for safe keeping in the hands of the father those elements went from his body and it takes those same elements to bring you to his body that constitutes the new birth now we just read where john 3 says that he's got to be born of water and spirit but then brother brown says but there's got to be blood as well scripture doesn't say blood but what part does blood have in the new birth the new the the blood makes a way where there was no way right and then it covers everything that you do right but it makes a way where there was no way it's the open door that we needed was that blood that made access now to a place where we could what receive repent and receive the very life of christ amen the blood pays the price the blood is the redemptive token amen when you remember in goshen what did he say when i see the blood i will pass over you that was the redemptive token that was what took your place amen you were already judged in christ at calvary and now you stand perfect unblemished with his righteousness as your covering that's it so don't beat yourself up about what you do amen you have a besetting sin you've got something that keeps messing you up then you go to god and you say god burn that out of me as we talked about last summer burn it out with your love let me fall so in love with you brother ron spencer that's what he he tells people he says they want to get closer to god he says fall in love with jesus amen let the love of god overcome any other loves that you have in your body that's when you put him first in your life is when you love him above all else and though this flesh might love many things that are completely unholy yet the spirit that's inside you wills you pass it says but i love him more amen and so i will not do those things amen but the life is in the blood that's what the blood has to do with it is the life that you're going to receive through his spirit comes through the blood so without the blood you have no holy spirit you have no life amen i can lose a lot of things i can lose limbs i can lose organs if i lose blood i can't live amen i can get things amputated off me i can have surgery to remove things that most would consider essential and they can keep me alive but if i lose my blood i'm dead amen the life is in the blood and that's what they did at calvary is they pierced his side so that the blood could drain out and that was representing the life that would go out and be available to the believers amen and the old testament when a man sinned he put his head on the sacrifice as they killed it he put his hand on the head of the bull as they slit the throat and drained the blood out and that was identifying with his sacrifice i'm sure that was a somber moment i i don't know anybody that really loves to see things killed but when you walk up and you have a perfect animal there that's never done anything wrong to hurt you and you lay your hands on as they cut the throat and the blood comes out that had to be a sobering moment and i'll bet you for a couple weeks after that they were really good christians you know if i can put it that way but then what happened they fell back into their old way of life didn't they because there was no life coming from that blood it was guilt that kept them pure for a while guilt is not the way god keeps us pure brothers and sisters guilt is the way satan tries to mess us up amen but god gives us always a place of remedy for these things but when christ died something else happened brother braham says a man put his hand on the head of jesus christ and confess his son feeling the pains and agony of calgary we don't get to feel it we can only imagine it in our head but he says when you put your hands on his head as he's dying what sin what he had to pay to redeem a man from sin and the holy spirit out of the blood of jesus christ comes cleansing that man he goes out a new creature and it's once for all he goes out a different person he goes out with all the sin problems settled forever for by one sacrifice says the scripture here he has perfected forever them that are sanctified and he said the holy ghost bears record of the same so david and joseph and moses and and joshua they never got to experience the new birth what they got to experience was an anointing upon them to do a job but they did not experience the new birth like you and i have it amen they were anointed but they never changed how powerful was that anointing to make them live the lives that they did and they don't even have what we have access to today which is the holy spirit on the innermost being what's our excuse if they can do that with a simple anointing on them what are we to be able to do with an anointing in us of the eternal god amen what's holding us back it certainly isn't what's inside of us amen something else has to give amen they were anointed with purpose and they surrendered to it and that's all god's asking us to do it's the same thing surrender to the anointing that is within you amen amen but the price was paid there but now what the price is paid like i said you stand in limbo if there's no new life you stand there a sinner forgive him but you're still going to keep going on with the same desires and the same wills and the same issues in your carnality that you have before amen we have to be born of water and spirit bubram says now you see his secret what too to restore fallen eve as she was a prefigure of the church and now notice as god opened up the side of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminist to feminist to put it in eve he took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing taking out of the side of christ the blood in the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see he's back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now so you can picture satan sitting there gleefully and remember satan had the keys to death in hell right and so he sees jesus on the cross and satan's just sitting there saying it's just about time just about time i'm going to get him now he's beating me all the way but he can't beat death because he's saying nobody's ever beaten death once it touched them we had enoch go we had elijah go but death never touched him but he says he's staying there and i'm going to touch him with death and he's saying i'm going to finally win i can finally beat this guy and you know what jesus is doing he's saying come in a little closer come on come on you can do it you can do it and what's he doing he's setting a trap he's saying sting me once just do it just do it oh make it make yourself think you're gonna win sting me sting me come on do it that's what's in his head sting me give it to me give it to me give it to me because he knows as we read on friday if he sticks it in there he's never getting that stinger back again amen satan is walking into a trap amen amen what is it satan's satan couldn't have stopped himself even if he knew what was going to happen because satan's anointing is to steal kill and destroy and so if he sees an opportunity to steal kill and destroy he's going to do it regardless of whether or not if he stopped to think he'd say that might not be the best idea amen look what it did to job he steal stole killed and destroyed job's life and what did it do gave job a resurrection and then he had more than he ever had before after that amen game of revelation that surpassed anything that job could could hold on to in this world amen amen he's claimed a life there but he couldn't hold it and the keys went right out of his belt and into those of christ amen and that's why we have resurrection life today is because he he drew satan in he said come on sting me and then satan couldn't sting anybody else anymore but listen to this he says when the blood cell was broke in jesus christ god was released god was released that's what happened there he said see he was god that blood wasn't jewish that blood wasn't gentile that was a creative blood cell god himself and now through that blood making a propitiation for our sins he cleanses a believer takes all of his sins away from him as if he never had sin god puts them in the sea of forgetfulness and the same god that was upon jesus christ continues in the believer doing the same works that he did here for it's the same spirit amen amen you've got to come by water and spirit acts 2 peter says this now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said to peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost be baptized that's water right you've got to be born of water and of spirit amen you've got to be the first thing in the birth is always water amen the water breaks inside the mother and then you know something's going to happen from there until the water breaks it's not coming you can you can be two weeks past your due date but until that water breaks nothing's going to happen amen so what you've got to be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ peter tells us not titles and in the name but what leads you to the water in the first place why don't you go sign your name on a church roster why don't you just raise your hand and say the prayer sinner's prayer why do you go to the water because the word tells you to amen and that's the first water that ever touches you is the washing of water of the word amen the word tells you to go to the water the word tells you to do what you're supposed to do the word quickens you to walk the way that will bring you into newness of life and then the first act of the word of the god is to get you to where god can do something with you so he's got to wash you clean amen he's got to get you dying out and the first dine out is to yourself before you go down and baptism amen the old man has to die and the first work of the word is to get you dead so christ can live in you now the thing is you go down to that water and it's figurative when you come up did does jonathan curlette change in and of himself does his flesh change no this flesh comes up just wet but the inner man has been changed and it doesn't matter if i feel it or don't feel it it's changed because i've obeyed the word amen and he's cleansed me from that but after that what is it god does a progressive work of killing jonathan corlett all the way until we go into a rapture amen or resurrection as as it might be amen in ephesians 5 he says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so it's not just a washing of water in baptism but it is a continual washing of the believer by the word with what purpose that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish because what the spirit has to come into something that's clean for service if it's full of filth then the spirit can't work there amen but that washing of water by the word is a sanctification process that makes you fit for service and this is happening constantly and as i said on friday sanctification doesn't always mean getting out bad things that's initial that's what starts in the beginning you get rid of the books and you get rid of the alcohol and the and the smoking and the drugs and you know living you know common law whatever that might be and that's making you fit for service but then what happens is you still have things in that cup and what he's doing is he's shaving out more of that so he can put more of him in and that's what sanctification is oftentimes is it's cutting out bits of you that neither good nor bad if i could put it that way not that there maybe is such a thing but you know it might be hobbies it might be things we focus on and whatnot and he says that's got to go because i need more of you i need more of you and so that means something in you's got to go jonathan curlett right and that's all he's doing is he's cutting out more of the things in my life that have nothing that are that are for his good amen water and spirit amen how many people are sitting in church today and they've got the water part down and they think they're going to heaven that's not it that's the start of it amen what you must be born again you've got to have the spirit you've got to have the token life amen you've got to have the proof that god has recognized your repentance amen that you actually have repented if you've if you've gone and you've gotten baptized and you've repented and you don't have the holy ghost then the only thing that's holding it back is you're asking for it if it's a true repentance the only thing that's waiting is is for god to say he's serious enough or she's serious enough and she wants it and now they're going to get it that's all there is it's always if your repentance is true amen but the word never stops washing ephesians 5 26 this is a constant washing amen i think every believer in here could raise their head and say i'm still being washed by the water of the word that's why we come to church isn't it that's why we listen to services it's why we read our bibles it's why we pray is so that the word can come in and wash us and give us a new mind and give us a new perspective and quicken the faith quicken the very life of god that's inside of us amen what is it it keeps you clean so that when you go down to pray you're not sitting there wondering does he hear because you know what you've been washed by the water there's no barrier between you and him now the blood's supposed to do that but brother brown says when you get into something you're not supposed to get into when you sin when you disbelieve he says that holy spirit pulls away from you right it's the presence you don't lose the life inside of you but that presence of the holy spirit pulls away because he can't be where sin is right and then you repent say lord help me not to do it again and now he can come back in if your life's clean there's no reason to expect him not to hear you amen what does it do it keeps the word of god fresh in our mind engraved in our hearts and that's what should be coming out of our mouth then throughout the week first john 5 says who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god simple question simple answer but why do you believe in jesus christ as the son of god because he's working in you the same way he was in christ right it's not just this mental intellectual thing that i believe in christ and therefore i'm an overcomer no you overcome because you believe in him in the works that he does you do also that's why you're overcoming is because the life of christ is inside of you this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one in earth that's me right this is earth right this is dust this is dirt and then so in me those three the water the spirit and the blood are supposed to agree what in these earthen vessels this mystery that's hidden this treasure that's hidden in these earthen vessels is to bear witness of christ in you and i and it's all supposed to say the same thing so you can have something in your life that is different from the word and it be the spirit of god that's anointing it because they have to bear witness of the same thing brother brahm says they say the same thing they act the same way they do the same way so if you've got a witness in your life that isn't in line with the holy spirit or the word then something's wrong there's a witness that isn't being given properly amen they have to do the same thing to take you wide to a common goal they're taking you to the same place and they can't be saying two different things do contrary things amen brother brahman says this he says the token for the believer today is the holy ghost not a blood a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of god this is the token that god requires of the church today god must see the token he must see it in every one of us amen amen it's interesting when you when you see you know special meetings are going on and and everyone's shouting and dancing and raising their hands it's like brother braham said that's the rain falling on the just and the unjust right when you're in the presence of god most people can actually feel something as in they know something's different and it can cause a supernatural effect on you it'll cause you to do things you didn't do but he didn't say the token on you in other words coming to church and having great services is not the token he's looking for but he's looking for a token life in you amen so that when the meeting's over when the service is over you don't act any different out there than you did in here amen amen amen therefore as the evening shadows are appearing and the wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly nations and upon the ungodly believers upon the professors without a profession catch that people that are saying they've got it but they don't have a possession sorry professors without a possession i've got it i've got it i'm identified with it i go to church and this that and the other thing he says and they don't have a possession upon these things is the wrath can be poured out amen under the original law all god looked at was the blood that's all he was looking at him in it like we said in goshen if you have proof of that sacrifice if it was over the door then that's what he was going to look at right but it wouldn't pay the price but it would push the payment of the price down so that you didn't have to pay it that year brother probably in the message the token he says and i've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see where it was standing before i said these things so he's preaching the token and then 1963 and it's such a burden on him and he's telling the people don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it but he says before i ever brought this to you he says i've tried to unfold myself and live in it as in to see is this the right is this the way it's supposed to be what is it doing in my life and then i'll bring to you what it's doing right he's making proof of it in his own life in his own ministry before he comes to you and says you've got to have the same thing right god's working on his prophet in his life before he can speak it he's got to live it and then he's preaching something that is absolutely essential to the believer he says i've made proof of this myself he says now we are living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike and god is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the holy ghost it's the only way and the only sign that god will ever pass because it is the literal life of jesus christ returned back into the believer this is not a representation this is not a similarity this isn't a clone this is the exact same life that was in christ jesus is now living in the believer when they receive the holy ghost the only difference between you and he is that he had it in the fullness we have it in measure he had a sinless body we have a sinful body amen so what do we do we say my body's sinful my body is carnal my body drives me nuts i'm constantly fighting my body what's up with this i thought i was a believer i thought i had the holy ghost and why am i fighting day in and day out day in and day out romans 8 says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god so if you're dwelling in the flesh if you're focused on the flesh if you're giving yourselves into the lust of the flesh the desires of the flesh the things that make you feel good rather than the things that make you grow in god you cannot please god and you'll feel a separation and the problem often is is that we keep doing those things trying to close the separation and you're in your flesh amen that's harsh words and maybe that would support us when we say i'm in this flesh and it seems like i'm never winning i'm always fighting in romans 7 just before this paul said o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death this is the prophet of god anointed angel for the age he's got the holy ghost in a way that most people will never experience and he's saying who will deliver me from this body of flesh so there's a battle to be fought for each and every one of us because we're in the body of this death amen paul knew what it was to be a flawed human i'm so glad he brought us the book of romans so that we can see that there is a battle and it is okay to realize that you're not everything that you ought to be amen but i'm so glad he takes us into romans 8 and he says there is a remedy for being wretched there is a remedy for being dead there is a remedy for the battle that you're fighting and it is not to stay in it amen but he takes us into a place where what we can have a new birth and we're now not focused on this body while we're bringing it under a subjection because we are not a modified creature amen we are not a modified creature i didn't go into the water as jonathan corlett and come up as a similar jonathan curlette but jonathan corlett died there and christ is reigning supreme in my heart and he's bringing this body into subjection amen we are not an upgraded member of our old self i'm not jonathan corlett 2.0 jonathan curlett has to die he has to die in the water and come up so that christ can live and in romans 8 then paul says what there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so there's a spirit effect that's supposed to be happening in our lives and it's going to supersede the walk of the flesh he says for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free past tense continuous and forever it started at calvary and it goes on forever the spirit of the life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death what's the spirit what's the law of the spirit of life what does that look like in a believer let's read this paul said then with my mind and i have the mind of christ you see he said with my mind i serve god but with the flesh the law of sin what is it this is the law of the flesh my flesh says tonight you're too tired your throat is too sore you've been out in the wind today you shall not go up to church tonight this is in questions and answers so he knows he's going to go up he's going to be facing all these questions he's going to be have to be quick on his feet you know these different things and he says my body's telling me you don't need to go to church tonight to do your duty as a prophet to the age that's the law of the flesh you might as well just call them up and tell brother neville to send the questions down and tell him to answer them but you see i promised to do that see he says now my mind on the inside the holy spirit said you keep your promise but the flesh said you're too tired see now the flesh will say now there's no need you pretty little thing you're the prettiest little thing in school now don't you pay any attention to that holy rolling mother of yours or that fanatic father see you're the best looking girl in school you're the best looking boy the best built you're the most popular there is in the city you see you yield your members to that and where do you come out at the little end of the horn every time see paul said my flesh wants always to yield to that there's always a battle there is always a battle that's why we're called overcomers is because we battle amen your flesh does too see but the law of the spirit of god in the heart overcomes the flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do hallelujah look then catch this if that will if it will do that for a sinner then won't that work for sickness too the law of the spirit of god in the heart that knows that by his stripes we were healed they stand with their power and make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil there you are phew he says that's it see what is it there's a progressive effect on the believer the faith that comes from the indwelling holy spirit what does it do it gets you to the water it gets you to repent then you get filled and then what does it do it takes you now from faith to believe for salvation to faith to push out what disease oppression whatever's in there he says the same spirit that gets you to that point just keeps moving on just keep pushing things out that aren't supposed to be in that body because what we're in a restoration redemption process amen what is healing healing is the earnest of the resurrection amen without healing we don't have the resurrection why do you think brother branham focused so much on healing because it was what was pointing us to the greatest healing we're ever going to get which is a new body amen he says now the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of life works in your heart so your spirit your spirit in your heart will make your body obey what it says do that's exactly right that's what paul said how wonderful is that the law of the spirit of life in your heart will make your body obey what it says do so the question is what spirit is working in you it's a simple question if you look at the effect that'll tell you what spirit's working amen so if the spirit is saying move then it's going to move if the spirit is saying hey nice to have you here it's going to stay here amen if we've got a spirit of fellowship with a demon then what's going to happen that demon's going to have influence in our life isn't it but if we have a spirit of life we have a spirit of healing what's it going to do it's going to push that out you getting in with a with a spirit of depression what's going to happen you're going to get get depressed you get close to the spirit of deliverance and that's going to move isn't it you get into a spirit of worship and it's not going to matter if it's brother mark brother bob myself up here leading songs it's not going to matter who's playing and how well they're playing you're going to worship no matter what amen why because the spirit of worship is not is in you it's not in them as in it is not dependent on them it's in you and it's a wellspring coming up within you and nothing's going to stop and it's no different than the spirit of healing as it rises up it's going to push out whatever was holding it back amen all it's doing all that's doing all that disease is doing is it's building up the pressure of the holy spirit in your life before boom it can't sustain it anymore amen some things hold on a little harder than others amen the good thing is is that all of the good things we're looking for are in one spirit but you're gonna fight many spirits of the bad things amen but you only need one spirit to defeat them and that is the spirit the law of the spirit of life in you which is the spirit of life in christ jesus amen we can have the holy ghost and still have a demon influence in our life absolutely because what the holy spirit is in our soul it's sealed to the day of redemption but in your spirit realm you're open to any influence that's out there and all you're looking for is he says he's just saying that's what's in your heart the spirit in your heart work in your body in your mind in these different things to push those out but you can absolutely be under a demonic influence and have the spirit in your holy spirit in your life romans 8 says but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he's none of his yeah i believe the message brother john so the devil does too that's why he's fighting it amen but that's only a starting place at best because you've got to become the message not just believe the message amen the bible says without the holy spirit you're not a child of god now does that mean if i don't have it today i'm not a child of god no child of god you're known by predestination the seed is in there but until that seed is quickened by the holy spirit you don't know if you're actually a child of god but that's the proof in you is the holy spirit but if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we look at that scripture we keep pointing to a resurrection and a rapture paul has just talked about a completely different thing going on what is it you've got to you don't have to wait for a theophany to be quickened you're being quickened in this right now today day in and day out that's been quick into what let you know who you are to let you know that the spirit of god is in you to do the works that he did also amen you got to be quick in here before you can be quickened into a theophany and that's what we're here to go through amen we're not waiting to be put into the theophany bodies to be quickened amen but we're in a battle in this body but we've been made alive the minute that you died and christ came in you've been made alive and nothing can ever take that away brethren says you can't kill eternal life right eternal life doesn't end once you got it you have it forever amen so the question is what needs to be made alive in you today what needs to be made alive what holds us back what's going on in our lives that isn't alive joy peace all these things this is all readily available to the holy ghost filled believer because it's the fruit of the spirit amen that's all available to us so if you lack it it's not because you don't have the holy spirit it's because you've got something blocking it up or maybe because you don't have the holy spirit i can't say you do or you don't it's not my thing but potential is not the problem event brother brahma as we said last time brown says when you get the holy ghost he says you have power in you potential in you to create a world and go live on it but he says the thing that stops you is the law of god which says that's not the purpose of the holy spirit but the the the potential is there to do it power power's not the problem because all power belongs to him authority is not the problem because he says he's given all authority to the church through christ our head right so that's not the problem the seals are open the names on the lam's book of life are being read right do we lack an opening of the word no so what's holding us back there's two things holding us back maybe three or four faith but faith comes by revelation and revelation comes from god so you don't get that by yourself so that's not your problem that's god's problem right revelation to give you faith to do what god wants you to do amen god has a purpose and a plan he has a timing for everything so that's up to him he controls the throttle on the engine how fast or how slow we're going to go amen but we're walking the road and it's god that gives and god that takes and god that puts the brakes on and then god that speeds us up but what holds us back we've got the doctrine we've got the full truth we've got a revelation of the plan of god there's nothing that's hidden to us in terms of the scriptures being revealed as far as i can tell brother bob said the only thing that's left is the rapture and the resurrection that tells me that everything's open right revelation 10 7 is done right the mystery of god is supposed to be finished so that's just now mysteries and earth and vessels that's waiting to be fully revealed because the words have all been revealed to us amen i believe there's only one thing left for us to do and this is where we have a play this is where we have a part galatians 2 20 says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in my head in my mind no he says the life i live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen we need to be crucified that's the only thing holding us back is a crucified life amen we surrender our will when we go down in baptism but when we come up now we've got to open up all the doors of our of our house don't we amen we don't just need to die out for a moment right so often that's what we do is we'll we'll sit under the preach of the word we'll go to special meetings we'll we'll have a certain thing in and and we'll we'll only open up one door right but we've got 73 others that need to be opened as well and god's just waiting for us to surrender and open up those doors as we go bit by bit amen it's not just in church that we have to surrender it's in our day-to-day devotions it's in our day-to-day prayer life as we start to make decisions and different things we surrender and say lord what would your will be not mine amen what we need to die out so completely that god has a path to work within our lives that has never been done since the book of acts that's what we're looking for brother branham's gift remember was to get himself out of the way so what am i looking for get jonathan curlette out of the way amen i've said it before i hear people talking about power and authority i see very people very few people talking about a dead people first you've got to die out before you can ever be in power and authority amen and then i'm looking for people that walk the talk not just talk the talk i'm looking for people that can say like paul it's not i that live it's christ that lives within me jonathan colette is crucified jonathan corletta is dead and the only thing that's left is jesus christ because jonathan curlette has realized there's nothing in him that's worth taking out of this world right i've got to come to the place where i think so little of what's in this flesh that i won't even entertain the thought much less act on it amen that's the sacrifice that we're looking for that's the crucifixion my mom shared this with with a bunch of us in the family and it fit in perfectly as i was closing out the service and he said brother bram says what kind of a people would it be this morning in this tabernacle this morning if this tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of god while you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't even have no motive or input of your own but just to be led by the spirit and they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human element goes out and the spirit of god fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church and its power of the resurrection of the lord jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving it's not just speak the word it's get yourself out so that the words that you speak are in his will and in his time amen you see what i mean then your thoughts will become words what when you've emptied yourself of all of yours then your thoughts will become words words that can be acted on and words will become material that's when the church is in its power i believe it's on the road amen this is in 1954. if it was on the road in 54 and we're in 2022 where is it it's got to be here i believe it's on the road that when the church will be so wrapped in christ the holy spirit and mankind sow away from their cells that they don't see themselves they don't have no desire but to serve god what are we wrapped up in what is it that consumes our time our free moments where do you spend your energy is it pointing to christ he says their thoughts move on that's my prayer my thoughts move on amen amen they refuse the things of the world amen can we say that we're refusing the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit and so fulfill the law of christ then the love of christ in the human heart moving in the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the holy spirit bringing to pass the thoughts of their mind what a place empty yourself of your thoughts and then he says it'll be your thoughts that bring it why because it is the mind of christ in you that's thinking the thoughts for you to speak act on expect and manifest he says our thoughts run different our carnal thoughts a lot of times we walk up and say how do you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart a lot of times we say i'm this and that i'll do that and you don't mean it in your heart see i don't mean it in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that christ is first christ is first christ is all then your entire makeup is of the spirit of the lord jesus christ he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts will be pure your heart that's why i say silence is golden because so often we're speaking so much and we're talking so much and we have so much to share and the question is is it the lord speaking remember what we talked about where brother brown says the bride will have the word and shall know what to do with it shall have thus say it the lord or she'll keep silent amen especially with social media these days everybody's got something to say i'm noticing and listening to messages lately how brother brown would often go and he just sit away quietly get away from everything he didn't go out and try and preach to everybody he just went and he got aside until god would come and tell what he was supposed to do and then he'd come out and do it and then he wouldn't get himself caught in the affairs of life he had to get quiet so he could get what leadership direction peace rest all these different things and then he moved from there he wouldn't go try and find it with other people he'd go to a place of quietness and find a theory man men and james paul said or in james james said religious a religious man bridleth not his tongue and his religion is vain amen but the jail talks about this quote many times and i looked it up the other day because i wanted to see the full quote brother joe he quotes one thing and i want to see the whole quote i mean i wanted to see the context i wanted to see what the prophet of god was talking about and it's in the message what was the holy ghost given for and he says now but now when we need it the spirit of god raises a standard do you have a need do you have a need this morning it says the holy spirit raises a standard what is that standard he says what is it he is pouring in his spirit what is it when the spirit raises the standard it's more of the spirit right to what meet the challenge that you're facing and then those who are resting out yonder in the grave are under the altar of god as the scripture says are crying how long lord how long how much longer god is waiting on me and you but he says the church is waiting on me and you what is he waiting for adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ become so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture so they're waiting for us but what are they waiting for adoption time when god can pour his spirit into us for the full manifestation of the sons and daughters of god amen amen they're waiting on full adoption that's the final element of the rapture before we go is that there's that quick short work where we know it they know it we have that fellowship with the saints and then off we go amen but the son doesn't choose his adoption day they're waiting on us but the son doesn't choose his adoption day the son doesn't say all right let's go on the rapture this morning right what does the sun do he is submitted to the tutor and then the tutor goes back and says he's ready so when they're waiting on you and i are they waiting on brother bob to catch faith for the rapture no because brother bob can't give himself faith for the rapture that can only come from god so that's not up to brother bob to have faith for the rapture what does brother bob have to have faith for to surrender to the word and trust that that's going to bring him to the rapture amen so the only thing that's looking there in the believer's life for them to do is surrender keep your life clean you know what friends you have you know what you're feeding on you know where you're spending your time you know where you're spending your energy that's all the stuff that we can control that's the only thing we can do to bring the rapture closer is feed on the right things be around the right people and do what the word of god tells us to do and be led by the spirit that's all we can do everything else after that is up to god because like i said you're not getting off this planet in a rapture because you decide to do it what you're doing is you're making a decision every day for the rapture right every decision you make is yay for the rapture or yay for staying here a while longer what by what you allow into your life it's like an engine that makes a thousand horsepower right but what controls that engine is what a gas pedal that's linked to a throttle and a fuel system and guess what you can be capable of a thousand horsepower but until the driver pushes that gas pedal to the floor you can't make a thousand horsepower you're capable of it but it's up to the driver to tell you and it's the same thing with god god's up there and what's he doing he's throttling everything he's balanced it out he knows what's got to happen when it's got to happen and when we need to move then he gives us a shot of the gas but guess what sometimes he lets off and says whoa something's not sounding right in that engine let's tune it up a bit right let's do a flushing of the fuel system oh it sounds like there's some carbon on the valves we need to get that cleared out otherwise we'll blow up if we try and use a thousand horsepower right now amen what's he doing he's making sure that that engine is perfect before he puts the full power into it amen but mark was talking about the world being shaken and guess what it is being shaken amen but it's not just the world that's been shaken because what that engine's got to get clean that bride's got to get ready for the fullness of the power of god inside of her amen and that's got to shake off a lot of clingers right a lot of things that are just hanging onto us that we've let go on for way too long and then we've got to let go and let god have his way brother braham says this and we're closing he says why you're baptized in the word that's right by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is christ is that right yes sir by one spirit all baptized into the body of god then you're baptized into god you're fortified with god his word is your fortress and he's a mighty tower the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe he's my fortress my buckler my shield my shoes my hat my coat my heart my all in all god all in all god wrapped up in him dead to the world rolls with him in resurrection not i live anymore but christ that lives in us can you say he's my all in all or do we run to the arm of flesh so quickly when things get tough because when he's our all in all we have rest amen when we truly give him everything then we have rest in what he's going to do he says now as soon as we got big enough that we could get off the corner and get off the little mission somewhere we're trying to build churches that's bigger than the next fellow we want to outshine the methodists the presbyterians the baptists he says that's not your purpose that's not why you are what you are god already had that he didn't raise you up for that he raised you as an example that he might place his power in you to show forth his glory amen god bless you let's stand if you would this this morning he raised you as an example that he might place his power in you to show forth his glory guess what we're not here to prove ourselves we're not here to prove anything it's not up to us to do the proving it's up to god to do the proving in us amen we're not here to develop a great reputation we're not here to be known for gifts and all of these different things but we're here that he could do what show forth his glory in us amen amen my desire for this year has been less of me amen less of jonathan corlett less of my thoughts less of my words and more quietness and more looking to him to do the things in our lives that we need to amen not just as a minister as a father as a husband as a member of the community whatever it might be that i would be a greater witness for him and the only way i can be a greater witness is is if there's less of me amen i've got to surrender i've got to die i've got to crucify everything that's inside of me day in and day out as we said take my hands off the steering wheel and then take my hands off the steering wheel and say lord you're the one that's in control and even when it feels out of control you're still in control amen amen we need to be more sincere you know we need to be more honest with ourselves like i said not in condemnation when we look at the word and we see we don't match up but we say lord we're looking to you to draw us to a higher plane and then we sing that song a higher plane than i have found lord plant my feet on higher ground you can't get there if you don't think you're if you already think you're on that plane you've got to recognize where you're at amen and then say lord bring me to a higher level i want to grow i want to grow not just up but out amen not in the natural body remember in the spiritual body to where that fullness can be inside of me amen amen lord take it all out and replace it with you as my prayer let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord we bow our heads humbly again this afternoon lord nothing good in us we're bringing but absolutely nothing we could do except to yield ourselves to you so that you could turn us into something beautiful something of worth lord something that would actually have a real impact on people's lives heavenly father lord
