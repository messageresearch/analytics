[23:37] Heavenly Father, as we bow in your
[23:39] presence tonight and we sing that song,
[23:41] Lord, and we think of the world and the
[23:44] condition that it's in, Lord, it just
[23:45] creates a greater longing, Lord, to be
[23:47] in that bullet land with you. Father, we
[23:50] pray, Lord, that you'd help us never
[23:52] lose sight of the fact, Lord, that
[23:54] you've called us, Lord, to to go through
[23:57] this world for our trials, our testing,
[23:59] and that, but by grace, Lord, we know
[24:02] that through the prophet's message,
[24:04] Father, that we have representation
[24:07] before the throne of God. And Lord, very
[24:10] soon, Lord, we'll be in your presence,
[24:12] Father, to be with you forever. So, we
[24:15] pray, Father, that you would just be
[24:16] with us tonight, Lord. Father, may your
[24:19] presence, Lord, be here. You be the most
[24:21] welcome guest, Lord, in this building
[24:22] tonight. Father, that you would reach
[24:24] down, Lord, and touch each and every
[24:26] one, Father. For there are many needs,
[24:28] Lord, upon the hearts of your people,
[24:29] both the spoken ones and the unspoken
[24:31] ones, Lord. And we just pray that you
[24:33] would draw near to each and every one of
[24:35] us, Father. Lift us up, Lord, because,
[24:38] Father, the enemy is around about, Lord,
[24:41] just trying to destroy us, Father,
[24:43] trying to create confusion, Lord, and
[24:45] keep our minds off you. But Father, we
[24:47] pray that you'd help us, Lord, to focus
[24:50] upon your word, Father, to have our
[24:52] thoughts always on you, Lord. Father,
[24:54] knowing, Lord, that there's a heaven to
[24:56] gain and there's a hell to shine. So be
[24:58] with us, Lord, we pray. Forgive us of
[25:00] our sins and mistakes, Lord. We just
[25:02] pray, Father, that you'll bless Brother
[25:04] John as we lift him up, Father, and
[25:06] Lord, he'd be able to put himself aside
[25:08] tonight, Lord, and allow you, Father, to
[25:10] speak to us, Lord, through him. So,
[25:13] Father, help them we pray, Lord. And
[25:15] Father, increase our faith, Lord,
[25:16] through the revelation of your word
[25:18] tonight. May the spirit of the living
[25:20] God, Lord, just move upon each one,
[25:22] Father. And Lord, our thoughts, Lord,
[25:24] and the things, Lord, that so easily
[25:25] beset us will be just pushed aside,
[25:27] Lord, that you might have the
[25:29] preeminence, Lord, that you'd touch the
[25:31] musicians, Lord, and the song leader,
[25:33] Father. May each one, Father, just be
[25:35] able to do their part to create the
[25:38] atmosphere, Lord, where you'd be pleased
[25:40] to dwell in. And father, not only them
[25:42] but us in the congregation, Lord, help
[25:44] us, Father, to call upon you, Lord.
[25:47] Father, just to come in, Lord, and
[25:49] Father, by grace reveal your word to us,
[25:51] we pray. So bless us, Lord, as we commit
[25:53] to service into your hands in Jesus
[25:55] Christ's name. Amen.

[42:01] the summer weather is hitting us and
[42:03] just being able to enjoy it. I was in
[42:04] the house most of the day.
[42:05] unfortunately, but went out to grill
[42:08] some chicken and was just enjoying the
[42:09] warmth. And if the wind's out of the
[42:11] south, I'm okay with it usually, you
[42:13] know, and it was a it was a beautiful
[42:14] day. So, I'm thankful for that. And it's
[42:16] good to see the seasons change in our
[42:18] favor. For sure. Romans 8:14, very
[42:21] familiar scripture. We've read it so
[42:22] many times in this series, I think, but
[42:24] I want to read it one more time. He
[42:26] says, "For as many as are led by the
[42:29] spirit of God, they are the sons of
[42:32] God." Amen. God bless you. You can have
[42:33] your seats. And we're continuing our
[42:35] series on the token life, the life of a
[42:37] believer that's filled with the spirit.
[42:39] And we're taking yet another uh day,
[42:41] another service on absolute power. And I
[42:43] hope we're starting to see what absolute
[42:45] power looks like. Amen. I love the
[42:47] clarity of scripture when we can take
[42:48] all of it. It gives us the big picture.
[42:50] It gives us the full thing. But rather
[42:52] than cherrypicking what sounds good, I
[42:55] find that too often what happens is we
[42:56] cherrypick and we we pick the thing that
[42:58] we like that's going to work well in our
[43:00] situation and we say, "That's for me."
[43:02] But we've got to take the whole word and
[43:04] and otherwise it just loses its power if
[43:06] we take and pick and choose because what
[43:08] happens is we take one scripture, we
[43:10] take one quote and we interpret it a
[43:11] certain way and then we take and we
[43:13] apply it in our life and we don't get
[43:15] the results we think we should. And so
[43:17] then our faith starts to to waver and we
[43:19] say, "Well, I guess that's it."
[43:24] Phone's down there. All good.
[43:28] Amen.
[43:29] We get to a place and we apply it and we
[43:32] say, "Well, that's it. This should take
[43:33] care of it." And then what happens is we
[43:35] don't get the results we're looking for.
[43:36] And then what happens? Our waist, our
[43:38] faith starts to waver and we say, "Well,
[43:39] I guess I maybe don't have what I
[43:41] thought or I guess that wasn't the
[43:42] Lord's leading." Or maybe you go to the
[43:44] extreme and say, "Well, I guess I'm not
[43:45] even a believer because other people
[43:46] seem to get results and when I do it, it
[43:48] doesn't seem like I get the results."
[43:50] Amen. But the thing is that we
[43:52] interpreted the scripture rather than
[43:54] taking the full word and letting it
[43:57] interpret itself. Because we find that
[43:58] the scripture interprets itself. It
[44:00] reinforces itself. The the the Bible is
[44:02] not one verse. It's many verses. It's 66
[44:05] books, thousands and thousands of
[44:07] verses. And what do they do? They
[44:08] reinforce each other. They set a
[44:10] pattern. They set the way of God's
[44:12] thinking. They show the way that God
[44:14] works. And they interpret themselves.
[44:15] The word of God interprets itself. If
[44:17] you'll read all of it, it'll give you
[44:18] the balance in every scripture. If you
[44:20] read all of it, I say we need to know
[44:22] our Bibles probably more than we know it
[44:24] sometimes. Amen. But what happens is we
[44:26] take it and if we read one scripture and
[44:29] we're looking for a certain thing, we'll
[44:30] take that one scripture and we'll bend
[44:31] it to our will. We'll bend it to our
[44:33] desires. We'll bend it to our way of
[44:35] thinking. We'll bend it to what's going
[44:36] to work best for this flesh or whatever
[44:38] the situation is. And we forget that God
[44:41] interprets his word by bringing it to
[44:42] pass, not just by how we take it. Amen.
[44:45] We've got to give God's opportunity. And
[44:46] I want to just take an example in that
[44:48] this morning or this evening because
[44:50] we're going to go into what it means to
[44:52] to to take the word and use it and and
[44:54] and fulfill it in these different
[44:55] things. And I want to settle us on a on
[44:58] a foundation because I don't want us to
[45:00] get, you know, we we fail at times. I
[45:02] don't know if you know this, but we fail
[45:03] at times. We fail. I'm getting a couple
[45:06] nods. I appreciate that. I'm not the
[45:07] only failure here, but we fail at times.
[45:09] And I find we fail because we we we step
[45:12] out. We step out. And it's not that
[45:15] we're stepping out without faith, but
[45:17] we're stepping out without a revelation
[45:19] of what God really wants in a situation.
[45:21] And it leads us down a path of of
[45:23] failure too many times. Now, I'm going
[45:24] to take a scripture and a quote, and
[45:27] this is a very familiar scripture. Jesus
[45:29] said, answered and said unto them,
[45:30] verily I say unto you, if you have faith
[45:33] and doubt not, you shall not only do
[45:35] this which is done to the fig tree, but
[45:37] also remember he said to the fig tree,
[45:39] cursed it and said, let no man eat your
[45:40] fruit anymore. They came back the in the
[45:42] next day or two or three and it was
[45:44] already dried up dead. He says, "But
[45:46] also if you shall say to this mountain,
[45:49] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[45:51] the sea, it shall be done." And the
[45:54] church said, "Amen." Is that the word of
[45:56] God? That's the word of God. Do we
[45:58] believe it this evening? I believe it.
[46:01] Me and Brother Bob believe it. He raised
[46:03] his hand. God bless you, Brother Bob.
[46:04] That's it. We believe it. Now, listen to
[46:06] what Brother Brandham says. He says,
[46:07] "Now Jesus said, whatsoever things you
[46:10] desire when you pray and believe, you
[46:12] receive them, and it shall be given unto
[46:14] you." Is that right? Verily, verily, I
[46:17] say unto you, if you say to the mountain
[46:18] in your heart, be plucked up, cast away,
[46:20] or removed, and doubted not. He says,
[46:22] "But now watch, but believing that those
[46:24] things that you say shall come to pass,
[46:26] you'll have it." See, whatsoever he
[46:28] saith, see, whatsoever you confess, can
[46:32] we say amen? Do we believe it? Is that
[46:35] the word to us in this age? It is, isn't
[46:38] it? But we all just said amen. But
[46:44] what does that scripture really mean?
[46:47] Is anything that's been said here wrong?
[46:50] It's not. I I'll clue you in. It's not.
[46:53] It's the word of God. Nothing I've said
[46:55] here is wrong. Amen. But we can take
[46:57] that scripture and say, "See, that's the
[46:59] spoken word. I'm going to have that one
[47:01] day." And what will we do? will walk
[47:03] around trying to produce the spoken word
[47:07] because that's the bride authority,
[47:08] isn't it? Spoken word. We believe that.
[47:11] I believe that. I don't know if you
[47:12] believe that. I believe it. The prophet
[47:13] clearly taught it. Amen. But what
[47:16] happens now is that this is going to
[47:18] happen. And it has happened. I'll tell
[47:20] you that it has happened in our lives.
[47:22] It has happened in some of our lives. We
[47:24] have a testimony of speaking and things
[47:25] happen. But I'll tell you, if all you
[47:27] read was that quote and that scripture,
[47:29] then it will not happen the way you
[47:31] think it will happen. Absolutely not. It
[47:33] won't. Amen. Because what was said there
[47:35] is not the full picture. It's not the
[47:37] full picture of what the scripture said
[47:39] and it's not the full picture of what
[47:40] the prophet said about that scripture
[47:42] when he came to turn our hearts back to
[47:44] the original faith. It's not wrong, but
[47:46] it's not complete.
[47:48] Catch the difference. You can have
[47:50] something that is right, but if it's
[47:51] incomplete, it's not the full truth. And
[47:54] so, you miss out on it. Amen. Remember,
[47:56] the Bible is a body of work. It's not
[47:58] just one scripture here and one
[47:59] scripture there. Remember how they did
[48:01] it in Moses' day and Jesus reinforces.
[48:04] It says, "One witness shall not rise up
[48:05] against the man for any iniquity or for
[48:08] any sin or in any sin that he sinnth. At
[48:10] the mouth of two witnesses or at the
[48:12] mouth of three witness witnesses shall
[48:14] the matter be establishes established."
[48:17] So the word of God is meant to layer on
[48:19] itself. It's meant to provide a complete
[48:22] picture in its whole rather than in an
[48:24] isolated incident. The prophet of God
[48:26] taught us, he says, "If it can't go
[48:28] through from Genesis to Revelation,
[48:30] leave it alone. Go back and restart."
[48:33] I've I've said this before over the
[48:34] pulpit. I actually discussed this at
[48:36] brother Bob and Sister Joe's house with
[48:38] brother Steven. And he was talking about
[48:40] this and he said, "Brother John," he
[48:41] says, "you'll know this." He says, "As a
[48:43] minister," he says, "We'll get to
[48:44] studying and we'll get this wonderful
[48:46] thought and we'll carry it and we'll
[48:49] carry it and we're studying and it's
[48:50] coming down and we're just rejoicing
[48:52] it." He says, "And then we hit a
[48:54] scripture that turns it on its head."
[48:57] He says, "And what do we have to do? We
[49:00] can either press forward in our thought
[49:02] or we can say the word of God is right.
[49:04] I was not anointed by the right thing."
[49:08] Doesn't mean we were wrong. See,
[49:09] sometimes God will test us and he'll let
[49:12] us go a certain way and then when we
[49:13] come up against the word, see if we'll
[49:15] insist on the blessing of our thought or
[49:17] if we'll turn it aside. You can be
[49:20] carried away, church, by your own
[49:21] enthusiasm, your own zeal many, many
[49:23] times. So, we got to take the full
[49:26] picture and if it won't go from Genesis
[49:28] to Revelation, we've got to set it
[49:30] aside. We have to set it aside
[49:32] completely.
[49:33] Amen.
[49:35] So, we read that one scripture where
[49:36] Jesus said, "If you believe something,
[49:38] if you have faith in what you're saying,
[49:40] it'll happen and you'll receive it." So,
[49:42] if that scripture literally means it the
[49:44] way it says it, that you could say
[49:45] something that you want, believe it in
[49:47] your heart, and you would get it, then
[49:49] we'd all be millionaires.
[49:51] Because I think most of us would desire
[49:52] to be a millionaire, generally in and of
[49:54] ourselves. I'd rather have lots of money
[49:56] than little money myself. That's the
[49:58] nature. That's the flesh. Amen. We'd
[50:01] rather have all those things. Amen. If
[50:02] the scripture meant what I just said,
[50:04] then the prosperity gospel would be
[50:06] true. Because if you could have anything
[50:08] you asked, then you would get everything
[50:10] that you wanted. But I don't know if you
[50:12] know this, but the prosperity gospel
[50:14] isn't true because it's all about
[50:16] lifestyle. It's all about ease. It's all
[50:18] about luxury. It's all about self. It's
[50:21] all about image. It's about all of those
[50:22] things. And I don't know if you know
[50:24] this either, but the gospel of Jesus
[50:25] Christ is not about self. It's not about
[50:28] ease. It's not about pleasure.
[50:31] It's about the opposite. In fact, it's
[50:33] about the dying out of this flesh. So
[50:35] the the the prosperity gospel can't be
[50:38] true. Therefore, the interpretation of
[50:39] that scripture can't be true either. It
[50:41] is not just a you get anything you want
[50:44] if you say it and believe it. That's the
[50:46] manifestation doctrine that they're
[50:47] preaching under prosperity gospels. And
[50:49] it is completely antichrist. Completely
[50:52] antichrist. Okay?
[50:55] But we have to preach the full word to
[50:58] get the balance so we know how to apply
[51:00] the word. Now, I'm not going to take all
[51:02] the scriptures that apply to what we
[51:03] just read, but I'm going to take one
[51:05] that gives us the clarity we need, and
[51:07] it's in First John. And he says, "And
[51:09] this is the confidence that we have in
[51:10] him. If we ask anything," okay, we're
[51:13] right where Jesus said. But watch this
[51:16] now. He says, "If we ask anything
[51:18] according to
[51:20] his will,
[51:22] he heareth us." Now, that word heareth
[51:25] is a special word. It means he will give
[51:27] us an audience. He will allow us into
[51:30] his presence to express our request.
[51:35] So in other words, remember in the old
[51:36] days in the when you were coming into
[51:38] the presence of a king, they would have
[51:40] a chamberlain there or somebody to talk
[51:42] to you first and they would take your
[51:45] request to the king and if the king
[51:48] wanted to give you that or hear more
[51:50] then he would say allow them in. In
[51:52] other words, the way to get into the
[51:54] presence of God and have your prayer
[51:56] heard is to come in according to his
[51:58] will, not your own. Okay? The key here
[52:03] is not ask what you will. The key is ask
[52:07] according to his will. That's the key.
[52:11] He says, "And and if we know that he
[52:13] hear us," in other words, if we know
[52:14] that he's grant if he grants us to come
[52:17] into his presence, he says, "Then
[52:19] whatsoever we ask, we know that we have
[52:22] the petitions that we desired of him."
[52:25] Now, the picture starts to become more
[52:26] clear. This is why the prosperity gospel
[52:29] doesn't work because in the prosperity
[52:31] gospel, it's all about me. But when we
[52:33] come into the true gospel, it's all
[52:35] about him. It's all about the word. It's
[52:37] all about the purpose and plan of God.
[52:39] And so when we come into his presence
[52:41] and we're seeking his will, that's when
[52:43] we get an audience. That's the key to
[52:46] this whole thing. Amen.
[52:48] So let me say it this way. We need to
[52:51] know God's will. That's the key to
[52:55] absolute power is to find God's will and
[52:57] make finding his will the greatest
[53:00] preeminence in your life. Whether it's
[53:02] for a career, whether it's for spouse,
[53:04] whether it's how you spend your money,
[53:06] whether it's where you live, whether
[53:07] it's the church you attend, the minister
[53:09] you support,
[53:10] what you do with your business, where
[53:12] you go with your business,
[53:15] how you spend your time,
[53:18] all of these things are supposed to come
[53:19] subject to the will of God. Amen. And
[53:22] his word is his will, the prophet of God
[53:25] told us. And so, we can I've said this
[53:28] before, but it does bear repeating. So
[53:30] many times people are saying, "I'm going
[53:32] to pray about it rather than going to
[53:34] their Bible and reading about it."
[53:35] Because what happens, church, is when we
[53:37] read it here, it is an absolute.
[53:40] I don't get to duck it because it's
[53:42] here. But if I cannot read it here and
[53:45] go and pray, then I can find just about
[53:48] any will I want by prayer. Because I can
[53:51] go and seek my will and find permissive
[53:53] will or find demonic will, but because
[53:56] my heart is set on it, I can't find
[53:58] God's will.
[54:01] But if we would go to the word and we
[54:03] see it as an absolute, it takes away all
[54:05] excuses and we know for a fact what his
[54:08] will is and then we don't have to pray
[54:09] about it because he's clearly told us. I
[54:12] believe that 99% of what we're praying
[54:14] about could be answered by his word if
[54:15] we'd spend more time there. Absolutely
[54:18] true. I find unfailingly that if I will
[54:20] give him time to answer by his word, he
[54:22] will. And then I don't have to wonder.
[54:25] Then I've got something sure to stand
[54:27] out on. I can step out on that because
[54:29] his word is there. Amen.
[54:33] You know, I've had people tell me, I
[54:36] feel led to do such and such, and it's
[54:39] 100% contrary to the word of God, and I
[54:40] know it. And to my shame, many times,
[54:43] I've just let it go. But a brother
[54:46] shared a quote today,
[54:48] and it was speaking of divine love. And
[54:50] brother Brandham says that divine love
[54:53] won't let you be quiet when you see your
[54:55] brother or your sister step out of line.
[54:57] He says it'll ball him out.
[55:01] Don't start with me, please.
[55:06] I had a brother come and correct me a
[55:07] couple weeks ago
[55:09] for the second time on the same thing.
[55:12] You know what that took, church? That
[55:14] took love and that took courage
[55:18] because you never know what you're going
[55:19] to get. especially when you go to a
[55:21] minister
[55:22] cuz sometimes we get up on our high
[55:24] horses and you never know if we're going
[55:25] to step up on it. But he came and he
[55:28] corrected me and he said afterwards he
[55:30] said I was nervous about what you were
[55:31] going to do. And I said listen I can't
[55:34] give it if I can't take it. If I'm in
[55:37] the house of correction I'm sitting
[55:38] under the correction of my own message
[55:40] and I can't preach something to you that
[55:42] I'm not willing to accept for myself.
[55:45] But Paul said what? Provoke one another
[55:48] to what?
[55:50] good works and love.
[55:54] And you can't provoke someone to good
[55:55] works unless you tell them in love what
[55:58] they're supposed to be doing if they're
[55:59] stepping out. Now, don't go ball
[56:01] somebody out. We don't need to ball
[56:03] somebody out. Burban was talking more
[56:04] about his own ministry and coming over
[56:06] the pulpit. And you know, they said,
[56:07] "You're always balling the people out."
[56:09] But his point was he was trying to get
[56:11] them back to the word, trying to get
[56:13] them to a sure foundation, trying to get
[56:15] them to a place where they'll get the
[56:16] results they really want rather than the
[56:18] permissive will of God, which never
[56:20] works out. It's not meant to. But we've
[56:23] got to have love for one another enough
[56:25] that we can tell each other, "Hey, I
[56:28] don't think you're quite right there. I
[56:30] don't think you've quite caught the
[56:31] picture of the word. I don't think
[56:33] you've caught the full balance of the
[56:34] word." We've got to be able to do that.
[56:38] But let me bring you a second quote now
[56:40] and this will set the whole thing in
[56:41] balance. Remember we're speaking on the
[56:43] token life. And look at the title of
[56:45] this of this message. It was what was
[56:47] the Holy Ghost given for him? And
[56:48] brother Bram says this. He says if you
[56:50] abide in me and my words in you ask what
[56:53] you will because you're asking his word
[56:56] and his word is life. He says speak it.
[56:59] If God said it and you're sure he said
[57:03] it, the Holy Ghost spares record that
[57:05] the word is right. in. And there you
[57:07] are, brother. Speak it. There it is. Say
[57:09] to this mountain, be moved. Don't doubt
[57:11] in your heart, but believe that what you
[57:12] said will come to pass. He says, "It's
[57:14] not you that speaketh, but the father
[57:16] that dwelleth in you." He does the
[57:19] talking. It's not you talking to that
[57:21] mountain. It's the father in that's in
[57:24] you speaking to that m mountain. He says
[57:26] it has to move. All heavens and earth
[57:29] will pass away. He said, "But my word
[57:31] shall not pass away." Certainly, it
[57:33] cannot pass away. What's the full
[57:36] balance of this thought of asking
[57:38] anything and receiving it? The balance
[57:40] is that it's the Holy Spirit inside of
[57:42] you that's making the request. It's not
[57:44] you that's making the request. Now,
[57:46] we'll cover this in in in future
[57:48] services about the idea of petitions.
[57:50] Listen, we can go to God and ask for
[57:52] something. And then we've got to say
[57:54] he's going to say one of two one of
[57:56] three things. Yes, no, or wait. And
[57:59] that's petitions. But when we're looking
[58:01] to actually move to do something, that's
[58:03] where we have to find will, not just
[58:05] permission. We want to go where he wants
[58:07] us to go. We want to do what he wants us
[58:09] to do when he wants us to do it. And the
[58:11] way that he wants us to do these things.
[58:13] Amen. So, brother's point here, when you
[58:15] speak this way, when you come into the
[58:17] fullness of the scripture, he says it
[58:19] won't be you speaking. It'll be the God
[58:21] inside of you that's speaking because
[58:22] your desires and your wills will have
[58:24] long disappeared. And now it's Christ
[58:26] himself speaking through you. Amen. So,
[58:29] it's not a a a free card of get anything
[58:31] you want as a promise, but it's
[58:33] surrender your will to his and that's
[58:35] when you'll get everything you want
[58:37] because your will is lost in his. Now,
[58:40] amen.
[58:44] We take on this continued thought of
[58:45] absolute power because we spoke last
[58:47] service about the disciples and they
[58:49] dece they received the Holy Spirit. But
[58:51] remember church, the 120 was not just
[58:53] the disciples. The disciples were 11.
[58:56] There's 109 other people up there that
[58:57] got the Holy Ghost, too. And some of
[59:00] them came out. Amen. But remember, it
[59:02] wasn't so much that they got power. It
[59:04] was that the power got them. That there
[59:06] was a dying out. There's a surrender
[59:07] that happened out there. And that's when
[59:09] we started to see the works of Jesus
[59:11] Christ really revealed in their lives.
[59:13] Remember what Jesus said in John? He
[59:15] said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[59:17] he that believeth on me, the works that
[59:19] I do shall he do also, and greater works
[59:22] than these shall he do, because I go
[59:23] unto my father. And whatsoever you shall
[59:26] ask in my name, that will I do, that the
[59:28] Father may be glorified in the Son. And
[59:31] if you shall ask anything in my name, I
[59:34] will do it. Again, that sounds like an
[59:36] open-ended promise, but there's more to
[59:38] that than just saying, "God, give me a
[59:39] million dollars." And then walking away
[59:41] and believing you're going to get it.
[59:44] Amen. It's bound by the phrase,
[59:47] "What? The works that I do shall you do
[59:50] also." So, you're going to ask the way
[59:53] he asked. You're going to do the way he
[59:56] did. And when you do that, that's when
[59:58] whatever you ask in his name, you're
[59:59] going to get. It's bound by the pattern
[1:00:02] of Jesus life, not bound by what we
[1:00:05] think it should do or how it should
[1:00:06] work. Amen. The asking is tied to the
[1:00:08] works of Christ, not to the works or the
[1:00:10] lust of the flesh.
[1:00:13] Amen. So, the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] coming was to continue the works of
[1:00:18] Jesus Christ. In Romans 8, coming back
[1:00:20] there, it says, "For whom he did forno,
[1:00:22] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:00:25] to the image of his son, that he who
[1:00:27] Christ might be the firstborn among many
[1:00:31] brethren." In other words, Christ was
[1:00:33] the first of a line of people that were
[1:00:35] going to be just like him. That'll choke
[1:00:38] a mule, church, but that's where we're
[1:00:39] at tonight is that there is a lineup of
[1:00:42] Jesus Christ following behind Jesus
[1:00:44] Christ. There's many coming behind him
[1:00:46] that are going to be in his shape, in
[1:00:48] his form, in his image, with his works,
[1:00:50] with his power, with his authority
[1:00:52] because they're what? Under the exact
[1:00:54] same anointing and spirit.
[1:00:58] There's more than one Jesus Christ
[1:00:59] walking around this world, this world
[1:01:01] today because there's a body bride of
[1:01:03] Jesus Christ that's walking around. And
[1:01:05] the beautiful thing is is you're not all
[1:01:07] of it and I'm not all of it. But it
[1:01:08] takes all of us to produce that perfect
[1:01:10] image. But it's the same spirit working
[1:01:12] inside in each and every one of us. And
[1:01:14] what's our purpose? It says Jesus to
[1:01:17] reflect the father.
[1:01:20] To reflect the God that is above us.
[1:01:22] It's to show a living God here on earth
[1:01:24] to be his hands, his feet, his mouth,
[1:01:27] to be his effort down here. Amen. And
[1:01:30] that means we're built, we're designed,
[1:01:32] we're predestinated to do it, church,
[1:01:36] that that don't let that put pressure on
[1:01:37] you. Let that put confidence in you this
[1:01:39] evening that you have been predestinated
[1:01:42] to be Jesus Christ to this dying world.
[1:01:45] Why? He promised that he's got a people
[1:01:47] prepared to reflect him through his word
[1:01:49] and his spirit today. That's who you
[1:01:52] are. That's a wonderful thing. Listen,
[1:01:55] my my initials naturally are JC, but
[1:01:58] I've got eternal initials that reflect
[1:02:00] JC as well. And so do you. VS turns into
[1:02:04] JC by the Holy Ghost. Christ in you, the
[1:02:07] hope of glory. The mystery that's been
[1:02:09] hidden through all this time. Amen.
[1:02:13] Another expression of God. That's what
[1:02:15] you and I are.
[1:02:17] It's wonderful, church.
[1:02:19] I think sometimes we need to stop and
[1:02:21] dwell on what it means to be a son and a
[1:02:23] daughter of God. To wake up every
[1:02:25] morning and say, "Satan,
[1:02:28] I'm a child of God." And start going and
[1:02:31] thanking God, saying, "Lord, I thank you
[1:02:32] for your call. I thank you for your
[1:02:34] predestination. I thank you for your
[1:02:36] sanctification. I thank you for your
[1:02:38] justification. I thank you for the power
[1:02:40] of the Holy Ghost to put my feet on the
[1:02:42] floor and overcome today and sit down at
[1:02:45] the end of the day, lay my head on my
[1:02:46] pillow and say, "It's been good to be a
[1:02:48] son or a daughter of God." Sometimes we
[1:02:50] need to remind ourselves who we are. We
[1:02:52] walk a little differently. We talk a
[1:02:54] little differently. Our attitude will be
[1:02:56] different. Why? Because it's Christ in
[1:02:58] us, the hope of glory revealing himself
[1:03:00] day by day. We shake ourselves. We need
[1:03:03] to realize the day and the hour that
[1:03:05] we're living in.
[1:03:07] That is Christ trying to reveal himself
[1:03:09] to us. We're not just walking through
[1:03:11] life, but we're walking through a drama
[1:03:13] of the word.
[1:03:15] And it's him being revealed day by day
[1:03:17] in every situation if we can only let
[1:03:19] him do it. If we can only let him do it.
[1:03:22] What were the works of Christ?
[1:03:26] Jesus said, "Then answered Jesus, and
[1:03:28] said unto them, verily, verily, I say
[1:03:29] unto you. The Son can do nothing of
[1:03:31] himself, but what he seeth the Father
[1:03:33] do. For what things soever he does,
[1:03:35] those also the Son doeth also." Verse 30
[1:03:38] says, "I can of my own self do nothing.
[1:03:41] The perfect man said, I can't do
[1:03:43] anything without him." He says, "As I
[1:03:46] hear, I judge, and my judgment is just
[1:03:49] because I seek not my own will, but the
[1:03:51] will of the Father which sent me." In
[1:03:53] John 6, he would say, "For I came down
[1:03:55] from heaven, not to do mine own will,
[1:03:57] but the will of him that sent me." When
[1:04:00] Jesus came down in the flesh, what did
[1:04:02] he do? He healed. He cleansed. He
[1:04:06] delivered. He rebuked. He corrected. He
[1:04:10] adjusted. He called. He cast out. He
[1:04:14] taught. He preached. He raised the dead.
[1:04:18] He spoke damnation. even
[1:04:21] he did all those things. And what
[1:04:24] whatever was in your heart, church,
[1:04:26] that's whether it was good or whether it
[1:04:28] was bad. Cuz if your heart was in line
[1:04:30] with the word of God, then whatever he
[1:04:31] did, it was good, even if it hurt. But
[1:04:34] if there was a different seed, if there
[1:04:35] was a different spirit inside of you, it
[1:04:37] was bad. It was wrong. It was evil. It
[1:04:39] was of Satan. But Jesus said, "Listen,
[1:04:42] when I judge, I judge because of what I
[1:04:44] hear." Brother Ara said he had an open
[1:04:46] vision ministry. He could see what was
[1:04:49] going to happen before it happened. He
[1:04:50] knew what he was supposed to do because
[1:04:52] he had the father speaking into his into
[1:04:54] his mind perfectly. The spirit of God
[1:04:56] dwelt in him without measure
[1:04:59] completely enrapturing him.
[1:05:02] He said, "I don't do anything of my own
[1:05:05] will and I can't do anything. I am so
[1:05:08] lost in the will of the father. I can't
[1:05:11] do anything else."
[1:05:14] And he says, "So it doesn't matter what
[1:05:15] you think about what I do. I know it's
[1:05:18] just because he told me to do it and I
[1:05:21] am in perfect obedience with him. I and
[1:05:23] my father are one. You can't separate
[1:05:25] us. So if you judge me, you're judging
[1:05:27] God. And who can judge God?
[1:05:31] Do you know you're staying in the same
[1:05:32] place when you move in the spirit? No
[1:05:34] one can judge you because it's God
[1:05:37] working through you.
[1:05:42] Whatever Jesus did on earth, it was to
[1:05:43] fulfill the will of Almighty God.
[1:05:46] church, that was a perfect man, subject
[1:05:48] to a perfect God, and it produced
[1:05:51] perfection.
[1:05:54] It's easy to be perfect if you never do
[1:05:56] anything.
[1:05:58] That's usually the critics, isn't it?
[1:06:01] Those that sit around and do nothing.
[1:06:03] But to be perfect while doing, that's
[1:06:05] true perfection. And Christ went and he
[1:06:08] did, and he did, and he did, and he did.
[1:06:11] And everything he did was perfect
[1:06:12] because he was subject to the will of
[1:06:15] God. Amen. God's will is his word. The
[1:06:16] prophet taught us that. And so Jesus did
[1:06:19] everything the word said he would do. I
[1:06:20] was just reading devotions the other day
[1:06:22] and it said, "And Jesus went to such and
[1:06:23] such a place because it was written
[1:06:25] somewhere somewhere else in the Bible
[1:06:27] that he would do it." So he went where
[1:06:29] the Bible said he was going to go, where
[1:06:30] the word said. He did what the word said
[1:06:32] he would do. He spoke what the word said
[1:06:34] he would speak. He was anointed the way
[1:06:36] the word said he was anointed. And the
[1:06:37] works that he did were the works that
[1:06:38] the word said he was going to do. It was
[1:06:40] the word becoming flesh. Why? Because he
[1:06:42] was subject to the spirit of God.
[1:06:47] So he says, "Listen,
[1:06:50] I'm going to go away soon.
[1:06:52] I'm going to leave." He says, "It's time
[1:06:54] for you to pick up the mantle."
[1:06:57] Tells his disciples, "The works that I
[1:06:59] do, you shall do also. It's time for you
[1:07:01] to be Christ." He says, "But you got to
[1:07:04] wait and go get power first." You got to
[1:07:07] go get power. What was he telling them
[1:07:09] to do, church?
[1:07:11] See, the denominational world will say
[1:07:13] that he they were he was telling them to
[1:07:14] go do signs and wonders. No, he was
[1:07:17] saying keep doing what I've been doing,
[1:07:18] which is what? Fulfilling the will of
[1:07:20] God. Fulfilling the word of God. That's
[1:07:24] what it is. So, if the word says signs
[1:07:26] and wonders, then you do signs and
[1:07:27] wonders. If the word says preach the
[1:07:29] word, then you preach the word. If the
[1:07:30] word says be quiet, you're quiet. It's
[1:07:33] whatever the spirit of God would lead
[1:07:35] you to do. Amen. The purpose of the Holy
[1:07:37] Spirit is to have us express the will of
[1:07:39] God day by day in our lives. That's what
[1:07:42] we're living by. That's what we're
[1:07:43] supposed to be doing. We come to
[1:07:45] Pentecost and Jesus said you had to
[1:07:46] receive power. And on the day of
[1:07:48] Pentecost, as we preached, it wasn't so
[1:07:50] much that they got power, but that power
[1:07:52] got them. Amen. And we saw that absolute
[1:07:54] power means becoming subject to the
[1:07:56] absolute. That's what power really
[1:07:58] means. Amen. To become alive, they had
[1:08:00] to die out. To come into power, amen,
[1:08:03] they had to surrender.
[1:08:05] And to become great, they had to become
[1:08:07] nothing. There had to be a total dying
[1:08:09] out up there in that upper room.
[1:08:11] Remember what Jesus said. He said,
[1:08:12] "Whoever of you wants to be greatest,
[1:08:14] let him be the minister. Let him be the
[1:08:15] servant of all." Humility is power of
[1:08:17] God. The way up is down. Amen. A dying
[1:08:20] out to self is what brings God into
[1:08:22] control. That's always the way it's
[1:08:24] been, and it's the way it will only
[1:08:25] work. Brother Ram says this. He says,
[1:08:27] "The Holy Ghost is power for service."
[1:08:31] If I could, if you would allow me to say
[1:08:33] it, I would say that it's the Holy Ghost
[1:08:34] makes you ready for service. It puts you
[1:08:38] into service because otherwise you'll
[1:08:41] just do what you want to do and it will
[1:08:44] never come out to anything that's that
[1:08:45] that's of any measure for the kingdom of
[1:08:47] God. He says you'll receive power. Acts
[1:08:50] 18, after this the Holy Ghost has come
[1:08:51] upon you. See, and they had already
[1:08:53] believed to eternal life and so forth,
[1:08:55] but they had to have the Holy Ghost for
[1:08:57] power. You shall be witnesses unto me
[1:08:59] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:09:01] because the Holy Ghost is a witness of
[1:09:03] the resurrection showing that you have
[1:09:05] become an adult in Christ. What is the
[1:09:09] nature of a child church?
[1:09:11] Selfish.
[1:09:13] Selfish.
[1:09:16] If you go to your children, they are
[1:09:18] rarely focused on what do mommy and
[1:09:20] daddy want and they're very focused on
[1:09:23] what do I want. That's the nature of a
[1:09:25] child. But when you come into adulthood,
[1:09:28] now you're stepping into looking out for
[1:09:29] the needs of others, not just yourself.
[1:09:33] You're being put into service,
[1:09:35] like it or lump it, that's when you know
[1:09:37] somebody's an adult is when they're in
[1:09:39] service now, not just sitting around
[1:09:40] doing everything for themselves and
[1:09:41] looking out for what's in it for me.
[1:09:44] Brother Bam continues, "And the trumpet
[1:09:45] gives an uncertain sound." He says, "The
[1:09:47] Holy Spirit is an experience of being
[1:09:49] filled and endued with power for
[1:09:52] service." Remember what that word endued
[1:09:53] means? It means clothed, wrapped up,
[1:09:56] covered in a garment. And it's the
[1:09:58] garment of the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:00] Amen. You know, when Peter comes down
[1:10:03] from the upper room, I just had a giggle
[1:10:06] at this when I was studying, if I'm
[1:10:07] honest, because remember, Peter's under
[1:10:09] a promise. And Peter, if you remember,
[1:10:12] is under a promise that you will have
[1:10:14] the keys to the kingdom.
[1:10:18] But he's got to wait for power before he
[1:10:20] can use the keys. But I would imagine,
[1:10:23] and this is just me, that Peter had a
[1:10:25] lot of dreams about what it was going to
[1:10:27] be like when he finally got to use those
[1:10:28] keys to the kingdom.
[1:10:31] Don't we have it as a message bride?
[1:10:33] Boy, I can't wait till I have spoken
[1:10:35] word authority. Look out now.
[1:10:39] Look out now. And what will we do? I've
[1:10:41] said this before. If I had spoken word
[1:10:43] authority today, there would be no bad
[1:10:44] drivers.
[1:10:46] which will mean that in one moment we
[1:10:48] would all disappear including myself,
[1:10:51] right? Because we all have our moments.
[1:10:54] But what would we do? See, when we're
[1:10:56] immature, when we're focused on self,
[1:10:58] absolute power, it corrupts absolutely.
[1:11:01] And so all we would do is we would just
[1:11:03] destroy everyone around us and then we
[1:11:04] destroy ourselves in our own misery.
[1:11:08] But Peter's got the keys to the kingdom.
[1:11:09] And maybe he sat there and he was sing,
[1:11:11] you know, he'd dream at night and just
[1:11:13] sit there and wonder in his moments and
[1:11:14] say, you know, boy, it's going to be
[1:11:16] nice. They're really going to see what I
[1:11:19] can do when those keys are really given
[1:11:21] into my hands.
[1:11:23] But church, he comes down on the day of
[1:11:26] Pentecost and what does he do? Remember,
[1:11:30] Brother Bram says now he's an inspired
[1:11:31] preacher. He preaches and 3,000 souls
[1:11:34] come to Christ.
[1:11:39] Did Peter go down and say, "Hey,
[1:11:41] everybody, look at me.
[1:11:43] Look at these keys." Everybody shut up.
[1:11:45] I'm going to do some lock unlocking
[1:11:47] here. Okay, the keyholder is here.
[1:11:51] Church, Peter didn't even know he was
[1:11:54] using the keys when he used them. You
[1:11:57] say, "I got these gifts. I'm looking
[1:11:58] forward to this." Church, I'm telling
[1:12:00] you, when it works the way it's supposed
[1:12:01] to work, you won't even realize that
[1:12:03] what you're doing. Brother Brandham,
[1:12:05] when he's under that anointing, remember
[1:12:07] what he'd say? He says, "Is what he said
[1:12:09] right?" He didn't even know what he was
[1:12:12] speaking. Church, under perfect
[1:12:14] subjection to the spirit of God, Peter
[1:12:17] comes down and he's unlocking eternity.
[1:12:21] He's unlocking the Holy Ghost for those
[1:12:23] people. And what does he do? He preaches
[1:12:25] Acts 2:38.
[1:12:29] That's the key to the kingdom, church.
[1:12:30] Acts 2:38. Repent and be baptized in the
[1:12:34] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:12:35] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:12:37] of the Holy Ghost. That is the key. That
[1:12:39] was the key and that will forever be the
[1:12:41] key until time runs out. Acts 2:38 works
[1:12:44] the same today as it did back then. Why?
[1:12:46] Because it was the key to the kingdom.
[1:12:49] And Peter didn't even know he was
[1:12:50] handling the keys at that time. Then
[1:12:52] what does he do?
[1:12:55] Big Mr. keyh holder walking around with
[1:12:57] the keys to the kingdom dangling on his
[1:12:59] side. He's up on the top of the roof.
[1:13:03] And he's praying and he's getting a
[1:13:05] little hungry.
[1:13:07] You know, maybe I'll dangle my heavenly
[1:13:08] keys and get someone to bring me a
[1:13:10] sandwich. No, he's praying and the Holy
[1:13:12] Spirit says, "There's some men coming.
[1:13:13] Go with them and whatever they ask you
[1:13:15] to do, do." And so Peter goes to the
[1:13:18] Gentiles
[1:13:20] against his own will and preference, but
[1:13:23] in obedience to the spirit. And he comes
[1:13:26] into the house of Cornelius. says,
[1:13:28] "Okay, I didn't really want to be here,
[1:13:30] but I'm here because the spirit told me
[1:13:31] to. Now, what do you want?" Peter
[1:13:33] doesn't even know what they want,
[1:13:35] church, but he's there. Why? Because
[1:13:38] he's subject to absolute power.
[1:13:41] And they say, "Listen, God told us that
[1:13:43] whatever you're preaching is what we
[1:13:44] need." And Peter said, "All right. Well,
[1:13:46] here's what I'm here's what I've been
[1:13:47] preaching." And while he yet spake, the
[1:13:49] scripture says the Holy Spirit fell on
[1:13:51] him. Peter's using the keys again, and
[1:13:54] he doesn't know it. He doesn't know it
[1:13:56] in his own self, in his will. He would
[1:13:58] not even want the Holy Ghost to go on
[1:14:00] the Gentiles. And yet, it's working.
[1:14:02] Why? Because it's not Peter anymore.
[1:14:04] It's the spirit of God working through
[1:14:05] Peter.
[1:14:07] Absolute power needs us out of the way
[1:14:09] completely. That's the only way it's
[1:14:11] going to work. Absolute power requires
[1:14:14] an absolute to handle it. And that means
[1:14:16] it won't work through you and I managing
[1:14:18] it at ourselves. When Peter's preaching
[1:14:20] to Cornelius, he didn't come in. He
[1:14:21] didn't lay his hands on them suddenly.
[1:14:23] He didn't breathe on them. He didn't
[1:14:25] even say receive you the Holy Ghost. He
[1:14:27] just preached the word and the spirit of
[1:14:29] God quickened it. That's it,
[1:14:33] church. I don't have to do anything
[1:14:36] except give you the word and then it's
[1:14:38] up to God to quicken it. That's all my
[1:14:41] requirement is. I can't give you the
[1:14:43] Holy Ghost. I can't give you overcoming
[1:14:45] power. I can't even give you good advice
[1:14:47] unless he comes on the line.
[1:14:50] It takes him to do the work. Amen. Peter
[1:14:53] had no clue what he was doing. He just
[1:14:55] preached the word and the word did the
[1:14:56] work.
[1:14:58] Church, this isn't about me or you
[1:14:59] handling power. It's about power
[1:15:01] handling us. It's about letting go and
[1:15:03] letting God have his way inside of our
[1:15:05] lives. Amen. It's him that leads. It's
[1:15:07] not me that leads. It's him that guides.
[1:15:09] It's not me. It's not you. It's him that
[1:15:11] does the work. It's not you or I. That's
[1:15:13] what absolute power looks like. Amen.
[1:15:15] That's the privilege we have is that
[1:15:17] it's Christ in me, the hope of glory,
[1:15:18] doing this day by day. I can do all
[1:15:20] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:15:22] me. It's not me, it's him. Brother Bam
[1:15:25] says this beautiful thing. He says,
[1:15:27] "What is it?" It's God, the Holy Spirit
[1:15:30] dwelling among human flesh in these
[1:15:33] sanctified vessels that the son of God's
[1:15:35] blood cleansed by faith.
[1:15:38] He says, "And God dwelling in these
[1:15:41] vessels."
[1:15:43] He's pointing at a bride body performing
[1:15:45] and carrying on the works of Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ making him the same yesterday,
[1:15:50] today, and forever. He says, "If we are
[1:15:53] baptized by the Holy Ghost and into the
[1:15:55] body, then we become the body of
[1:15:59] Christ."
[1:16:00] That's where we're standing today.
[1:16:02] That's what this end time message has
[1:16:03] revealed is that Christ has come down to
[1:16:05] inhabit a bride body and the head is
[1:16:08] joining with the body and then we'll be
[1:16:09] caught away into perfect unity. Amen.
[1:16:12] We've heard it preached so many times.
[1:16:14] I've preached it. We've all preached it.
[1:16:15] I guess the ministry. We've heard about
[1:16:18] power, spoken word power. We've talked
[1:16:20] about authority. We've talked about
[1:16:21] adoption. We've talked about gifts and
[1:16:23] all these things. But the thing to all
[1:16:25] of it, church, is simply yielding
[1:16:27] obedience.
[1:16:28] That's it. Yielded obedience.
[1:16:32] It's not about working it. It's not
[1:16:34] about making it happen. It's about
[1:16:37] stepping out of the way and letting God
[1:16:39] do his thing.
[1:16:41] finding his way and walking in it.
[1:16:44] That's the simplicity of it. Peter
[1:16:46] didn't walk down to the house of
[1:16:47] Cornelius dangling the keys and say,
[1:16:49] "All right, here we go. I'm going to do
[1:16:50] some unlocking today." No, he just
[1:16:52] walked down in obedience to the leading
[1:16:54] of the Holy Spirit. And then what
[1:16:56] happened was what God wanted to happen.
[1:16:58] He didn't go in with intent. He didn't
[1:17:01] draw up a plan. and say, "Okay, guys,
[1:17:03] here's what we're going to do, and this
[1:17:05] will No, he just followed the leading of
[1:17:08] the Holy Spirit, and that took care of
[1:17:10] the whole thing." Simple. So simple. But
[1:17:15] what is it, church? He had to have the
[1:17:17] spirit in them in the first place. And
[1:17:19] that's where we miss it so many times.
[1:17:21] That's where people are missing is they
[1:17:22] don't have the spirit of God inside
[1:17:24] them. They have a church experience.
[1:17:26] They have a I believe the message
[1:17:27] experience. They have a camp experience,
[1:17:29] but they don't have the inddwelling
[1:17:30] power in there to lead and guide us day
[1:17:32] by day. That's our problem. That's our
[1:17:35] problem. I'm not saying that's our
[1:17:37] problem. I'm saying that's the problem
[1:17:39] is we don't have the spirit of God
[1:17:40] inside of us.
[1:17:42] Peter's out of his own will, out of his
[1:17:46] own ideas, out of his own preferences,
[1:17:47] but he's walking by the spirit, and
[1:17:49] that's what produced the results.
[1:17:51] Abraham says, "It makes you do things
[1:17:52] you ordinarily wouldn't do." It made
[1:17:55] Paul do things he ordinarily wouldn't
[1:17:56] do. It made Moses do things ordinarily
[1:17:58] he wouldn't do. It makes every man and
[1:18:00] woman do things they wouldn't do
[1:18:02] ordinarily. It's something you are
[1:18:04] centered to, it's your stabilizer. Amen.
[1:18:07] Church, this wasn't some big show or
[1:18:09] event. You would think that if I if I
[1:18:12] was to ask you, okay, if we're going to
[1:18:14] go and we're going to loose the Holy
[1:18:16] Spirit in the Gentiles,
[1:18:18] give me your plan. What would we say?
[1:18:20] Well, the first thing we need to do is
[1:18:21] we need to market and advertise and we
[1:18:24] need to rent a big tent or a massive uh
[1:18:26] church or even better, let's get a full
[1:18:28] stadium.
[1:18:30] And then we've got to have the best
[1:18:31] worship team go ahead and then we're
[1:18:33] going to have the other 10 apostles go
[1:18:36] before Peter into those areas and do all
[1:18:39] these signs and wonders to hype it up.
[1:18:42] And then when that's done, then Peter
[1:18:44] will come behind and he'll preach the
[1:18:45] gospel and they'll receive the Holy
[1:18:47] Ghost.
[1:18:48] Isn't that how the world would do it?
[1:18:50] Isn't that how denominations would do
[1:18:51] it? Isn't that how we would probably do
[1:18:53] it if you told us to design a plan to
[1:18:55] bring the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles? We
[1:18:58] build a campaign.
[1:19:00] And how did God do it, church? He says,
[1:19:03] "Go to a house of a faithful man and
[1:19:04] preach the gospel." And from there,
[1:19:07] church, the Holy Ghost spread throughout
[1:19:08] the region.
[1:19:10] That simple. It's so simple. We want to
[1:19:14] make such a big thing of it. Amen. And
[1:19:16] once Peter does that, and once he goes
[1:19:18] to the Samaritans, his job is basically
[1:19:20] done as the keyholder. There's no more
[1:19:23] to unlock. The the the hybrids, the
[1:19:25] Samaritans are done. The Gentiles, the
[1:19:27] rank unbelievers are done. And the Jews,
[1:19:29] the promised children are done. The Holy
[1:19:31] Ghost been loosed to the entire world.
[1:19:32] That's all Peter had to do. Church, that
[1:19:35] was his role as the keyholder.
[1:19:39] Done. And he was dead within a few
[1:19:41] years.
[1:19:45] Peter never used those keys for himself.
[1:19:47] Peter never went around with a plan for
[1:19:49] how am I going to use this power and
[1:19:50] authority that God's given me. God just
[1:19:52] did it to him because he yielded himself
[1:19:54] to the spirit of God. That's the way
[1:19:56] that it worked. Amen.
[1:20:00] That key never changed. Works today. And
[1:20:04] it's the only thing that'll work. Amen.
[1:20:06] Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:20:08] Christ, and receive the baptism of the
[1:20:10] Holy Spirit. That's the new birth. But
[1:20:11] how do we get the new birth? See church,
[1:20:13] this is an issue we have is we say,
[1:20:15] "Receive the word." But you got to
[1:20:16] receive the life of the word.
[1:20:19] Saying, "I believe this message." Saying
[1:20:21] that I believe that God sent a prophet.
[1:20:23] Saying that I know my time and a season
[1:20:25] is not enough. You've got to have the
[1:20:26] life that'll take you out of here.
[1:20:29] Not just an intellectual conception, not
[1:20:31] just a revelation of doctrine and
[1:20:32] theology, but it's going to take the
[1:20:34] reality of a living God inside of us to
[1:20:36] get us out of here. Man, that'll bring
[1:20:38] us out. That's why we tell people to
[1:20:41] come to church.
[1:20:43] Not because we want them to have a
[1:20:44] church experience, but because that's
[1:20:46] where the anointed word is preached. If
[1:20:48] you have a God-filled minister there,
[1:20:50] that's where the anointed word is
[1:20:52] preached. And the word will do the work.
[1:20:54] And it'll either drive them away or
[1:20:56] it'll pull them in. It's not up to the
[1:20:59] man behind the pulpit to do that. The
[1:21:00] word will do it by itself. We don't have
[1:21:02] to preach hard, you know, give them the
[1:21:05] word test. We don't have to do that. We
[1:21:07] preach as we're led. Amen. We've got
[1:21:10] visitors that are coming on a regular
[1:21:12] basis. I've preached some hard things,
[1:21:13] not intending to,
[1:21:15] but that's okay. But I don't go in with
[1:21:18] the intent of pushing them out by making
[1:21:19] them make a hard decision up front.
[1:21:22] You look at brother Vichel, I hope it's
[1:21:24] okay to say this. Brother Vichel didn't
[1:21:26] receive everything in the first week.
[1:21:29] No, took days, weeks, years in some
[1:21:32] cases. But th God's got to do the work.
[1:21:35] Otherwise, all we'll do is we'll produce
[1:21:37] twofold more a child of hell by legalism
[1:21:40] and it will never work. Conformity will
[1:21:43] not work. It's got to be conformity by
[1:21:45] the spirit. Not by social pressure, not
[1:21:48] by religious pressure on these different
[1:21:49] things.
[1:21:51] Peter's anointed for his commission. And
[1:21:53] what does he do, church? He stays in his
[1:21:56] lane. He stays in his lane. Peter only
[1:21:59] goes to the Gentiles, as far as I can
[1:22:01] remember in scripture, the one time for
[1:22:02] Cornelius to unlock it. And then after
[1:22:04] that the apostles go and what does he
[1:22:06] do? He hangs around with the Jews the
[1:22:08] rest of his time. That was his home
[1:22:10] crowd. That was where he was meant to
[1:22:11] be. Others go off and around and do
[1:22:13] these different things.
[1:22:18] Peter was under perfect authority.
[1:22:21] Peter was under a perfect anointing
[1:22:23] because he was doing exactly what that
[1:22:25] anointing led him to do and that was
[1:22:27] stick with his commission.
[1:22:30] Stay in your lane. Stay in your lane.
[1:22:32] I've said many times, it's amazing how
[1:22:34] much people that aren't preachers will
[1:22:36] tell us preachers how it works. Doesn't
[1:22:40] work that way. It doesn't work the way I
[1:22:42] thought it worked.
[1:22:45] We got to stay in our lane. Let the
[1:22:48] ministry be the ministry. Let the lady
[1:22:50] be the lady. Let the officers of the
[1:22:52] church be the officers of the church.
[1:22:55] And let God use those men as they need
[1:22:57] to.
[1:22:58] You sisters in your roles and the things
[1:23:00] that you do, stay in your lane. Let God
[1:23:03] anoint you in your commission and watch
[1:23:05] what he'll do. You'll see way better
[1:23:07] results if you can stay in your lane.
[1:23:08] That's for sure.
[1:23:11] Peter now is under authority. He's not
[1:23:14] using it. And we're going to cover that
[1:23:15] in a bit of in in a moment with Paul.
[1:23:17] But that's the thing is we can come into
[1:23:19] this place where we have authority and
[1:23:21] we can abuse it. Remember Elisha had
[1:23:23] authority. And what did he do? He got
[1:23:25] heated and he called judgment out on
[1:23:27] those children and the bears came out.
[1:23:30] He had authority,
[1:23:32] but he didn't have character in that
[1:23:34] moment to overcome it and he used it the
[1:23:36] wrong way. We've got to be so careful.
[1:23:38] Very familiar quote, but I felt worth
[1:23:40] reading tonight. He says, "Some people
[1:23:42] get the wrong impression of what the
[1:23:43] anointing is. When was the greatest
[1:23:46] anointing ever given to anyone, and what
[1:23:48] did they do when they had the
[1:23:49] anointing?" He said, "The greatest
[1:23:51] anointing that was ever given to anyone
[1:23:52] was Jesus Christ." We have the spirit by
[1:23:55] measure. He had it without measure. And
[1:23:58] one day he entered into the temple and
[1:23:59] picked up the scroll and read and said,
[1:24:01] "The spirit of God is upon me, for he
[1:24:04] has anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:24:05] year, to bind up the broken hearts, to
[1:24:08] heal the sick, and give sight to the
[1:24:10] blind." He says, "And now we would think
[1:24:12] if such an anointing was on him, had
[1:24:15] been prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:24:17] would come. And here he was with that
[1:24:19] type of an anointing, the full blessing
[1:24:21] and the anointing of the Lord upon him.
[1:24:23] and we will want to run all over the
[1:24:24] building, scream and holler. But the
[1:24:27] Bible said he laid down the scroll and
[1:24:29] sat down and precious words proceeded
[1:24:32] from his mouth. He said that's what he
[1:24:34] did under the anointing. The anointing
[1:24:36] is not emotion. He said the anointing is
[1:24:39] one thing, supreme power in control.
[1:24:45] What does that mean, brother John? It
[1:24:47] means knowing exactly
[1:24:50] exactly what and how. Church, this is
[1:24:54] the big change we see in Peter because
[1:24:56] Peter went from trying to do to just
[1:24:59] doing it.
[1:25:01] That's what supreme authority under
[1:25:04] supreme power under control would do is
[1:25:06] you don't try and do it, you just do it.
[1:25:09] Remember what they said to brother
[1:25:10] Brandham? They said, "Brother Brandham,
[1:25:11] are you ever scared? Are you ever
[1:25:12] fearful when you're up there facing the
[1:25:14] things you're facing?" And he says,
[1:25:16] "No." Oh, as long as he sent me there, I
[1:25:18] have no fear.
[1:25:21] Why? Because he's under the authority of
[1:25:23] the Holy Spirit. It's not him that went
[1:25:25] there. It's the Holy Spirit that told
[1:25:27] him to go there. And anything that came
[1:25:29] against him, he knew had to what? Bow
[1:25:32] before the word. It had to because he
[1:25:35] was sent in the name of the Lord to
[1:25:37] bring a message of healing and
[1:25:38] deliverance to the bride of Jesus
[1:25:39] Christ. He said, "So I don't fear. I
[1:25:42] don't fear at all because it's not me.
[1:25:46] It's the Holy Spirit that's leading me
[1:25:47] in these things.
[1:25:50] Peter wasn't trying to make a name or be
[1:25:52] somebody or develop a big ministry. He
[1:25:55] was literally just fulfilling his
[1:25:56] commission day by day. Very simple. Just
[1:26:00] go and preach the word as God leads you
[1:26:02] to do it. Not a public show, church. Not
[1:26:06] everything is a public show. I know the
[1:26:08] testimonies that many people in this
[1:26:09] church have, and you've talked to me
[1:26:10] about some of these things, and and if
[1:26:12] you tell me I keep them private,
[1:26:13] absolutely. But things that have
[1:26:14] happened where the spirit of God has
[1:26:16] moved in your life and you have prayed,
[1:26:18] you have asked, you have spoken and
[1:26:20] those things have happened. And what is
[1:26:22] it church? For if only for a moment we
[1:26:24] caught the perfect will of God.
[1:26:28] Now I'll tell you this. The more we read
[1:26:30] this, the easier it ought to get. The
[1:26:32] more we pray, the easier it ought to
[1:26:35] get. Which tells me how important it is
[1:26:37] to read your Bible and pray. which is
[1:26:39] the thing that the prophet of God said,
[1:26:41] "If you want to get closer to God, read
[1:26:43] your Bible and pray."
[1:26:45] It's so simple and yet so often we don't
[1:26:49] do it. We want it to come a different
[1:26:51] way. We want to dream. We want a sign.
[1:26:53] We want to wonder.
[1:26:55] And he simply just said, "Read your
[1:26:57] Bible and pray."
[1:27:00] You know,
[1:27:01] it's an untored generation that seeks a
[1:27:03] sign.
[1:27:08] But the glory is not for me and it's not
[1:27:10] for you. The glory is for God. And
[1:27:12] that's why it's not a public show.
[1:27:15] Man, Peter went down out of the the the
[1:27:18] on the day of Pentecost church with one
[1:27:20] difference. He had no more information
[1:27:23] when he went in than when he came out.
[1:27:27] What did he have? He had the experience
[1:27:29] of the information.
[1:27:32] He knew what he was preaching about.
[1:27:36] Now, Peter wasn't a preacher before
[1:27:38] this. We know that. I mean, he wasn't a
[1:27:39] a member of the the priesthood or any of
[1:27:41] those different things, but he had
[1:27:43] preached before, but now he's got the
[1:27:44] full experience of everything that he's
[1:27:47] going to talk about. And that's what
[1:27:48] made the difference was he knew what he
[1:27:51] was talking about by experience, not cuz
[1:27:53] just he had spent time with Jesus.
[1:27:56] He knew what he'd been talking about the
[1:27:57] whole time. Amen. Peter didn't come down
[1:27:59] on the day of Pentecost and say, "All
[1:28:00] right, guys. Here's my set of notes.
[1:28:02] Here's what we're going to do." church.
[1:28:04] He was so full of what he was by the new
[1:28:07] birth that it just came tumbling out of
[1:28:09] him exactly the way it needed to. 3,000
[1:28:11] souls were saved.
[1:28:14] We look at the apostles and the
[1:28:16] disciples and and we say, "Well, those
[1:28:18] are the people that are led by the
[1:28:19] spirit of God." But Paul didn't say it's
[1:28:22] only for the five-fold ministry. Paul
[1:28:24] says, "As many
[1:28:26] as many as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:28:28] they are the sons of God." Amen. And
[1:28:30] that's exactly the same thing for each
[1:28:33] and every one of us. People have this
[1:28:35] idea that the disciples could just go do
[1:28:38] signs and wonders whenever they wanted.
[1:28:40] And so they say, that's why they say
[1:28:42] today you have these cessationists that
[1:28:43] say, "Well, it's no longer here anymore
[1:28:45] because we don't see it." Well, one,
[1:28:46] they don't see it in their churches
[1:28:48] because they don't believe.
[1:28:50] But even in many churches, we don't see
[1:28:52] it all the time and everywhere.
[1:28:55] Why is that, church? Because we have to
[1:28:58] be led by the spirit of God in all
[1:29:00] things. Now we have a promise that says
[1:29:02] if there are any sick among you, let
[1:29:04] them come forward. Let the elders pray,
[1:29:05] lay hands, pray for them, and they shall
[1:29:10] recover, a process of healing over time.
[1:29:14] We have that. So guess what? You're not
[1:29:16] going to be able to run to the news and
[1:29:17] say, "Hey, look at this miracle." It's a
[1:29:20] word promised, but it's not a miracle
[1:29:21] the way they would expect it, nor that
[1:29:22] we would even perhaps. Look at Sister
[1:29:25] Lorie Snow.
[1:29:27] It's a miracle. She's still alive. But
[1:29:29] most people would not say that she's a
[1:29:31] miracle of God. We say it because we
[1:29:33] know what's going on in the background.
[1:29:35] We know the prayers that are going up.
[1:29:36] We know that the the things that she has
[1:29:38] overcome. We would say that's absolutely
[1:29:40] a miracle, but the world would never
[1:29:41] accept that. They would just say that's
[1:29:42] the one in the million that actually
[1:29:44] makes it through. Keep praying for her,
[1:29:46] church. She's so close. She's so close.
[1:29:49] She's one bad leg away from walking out
[1:29:51] completely.
[1:29:54] not perfectly healed, but restored to
[1:29:56] where she can function and the healing
[1:29:59] will work work itself out over time.
[1:30:00] Keep praying for our sister. What a
[1:30:02] wonderful testimony she's had. What a
[1:30:04] wonderful attitude the family has had.
[1:30:06] But let's keep praying for her. Amen.
[1:30:09] But the the apostles and the disciples
[1:30:11] were not just running around just
[1:30:13] healing people wherever they wanted.
[1:30:15] That's not the way it worked. Amen. We
[1:30:16] know that Jesus himself said, "I can
[1:30:18] only do what the father shows me." So
[1:30:20] remember, there's times where Jesus went
[1:30:21] in and the scripture says he healed
[1:30:23] them. Everyone walked into a crowd of
[1:30:26] hundreds, thousands of people and he
[1:30:27] healed everyone. And then the other time
[1:30:29] he goes to the pool and he heals one and
[1:30:31] walks away with all those sick people
[1:30:32] there. There are times where he walked
[1:30:34] and it says he could do no great
[1:30:37] miracles amongst them. There are times
[1:30:40] where meetings were forbidden. The
[1:30:42] spirit of God told the disciples, "You
[1:30:44] can't do it." Told Paul he couldn't do
[1:30:46] it. Listen to this.
[1:30:48] Acts 14 says, "And it came to pass in
[1:30:51] Iconium that they both went both
[1:30:54] together into the synagogue of the Jews,
[1:30:55] and so spake that a great multitude,
[1:30:57] both of the Jews and also of the Greeks
[1:30:59] believed. But the unbelieving Jews
[1:31:01] stirred up the Gentiles and made their
[1:31:03] minds evil affected against the
[1:31:05] brethren. Long time therefore abode they
[1:31:08] speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave
[1:31:10] testimony unto the word of his grace. So
[1:31:12] God testified. God followed behind his
[1:31:15] word and did what?
[1:31:18] granted
[1:31:20] signs and wonders to be done by their
[1:31:22] hands. That word granted means he gave
[1:31:24] them permission. Remember what a
[1:31:26] commission is. A commission is
[1:31:28] permission with full power. So in other
[1:31:31] words, he commissioned them there to do
[1:31:34] signs and wonders. He granted them. They
[1:31:36] weren't running around saying, "Okay,
[1:31:38] they don't believe us. Let's do some
[1:31:39] signs and wonders." But rather, the
[1:31:41] spirit of God said, "Go do what I tell
[1:31:43] you to do." And it was granted them to
[1:31:45] do it. And they did it and it caused
[1:31:46] people to believe.
[1:31:49] They weren't running around of their own
[1:31:51] accord wielding the sword of signs and
[1:31:54] wonders and gifts and authority and
[1:31:56] power and all these things. They were
[1:31:57] subject to the leading of God. Amen.
[1:32:00] Watch this again in Acts 16. Now this is
[1:32:03] Paul speaking of Paul says, "And when
[1:32:04] they had gone throughout Friia and the
[1:32:06] region of Galatia and were forbidden of
[1:32:09] the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
[1:32:11] Asia." Remember what the anointing is,
[1:32:13] church. It is knowing exactly what and
[1:32:17] how.
[1:32:19] So we see here Paul is forbidden to
[1:32:21] preach in an area. Why? We find out they
[1:32:24] weren't ready for it. Macedonia was
[1:32:26] ready and so the spirit of God told them
[1:32:28] to do it and so they moved on without
[1:32:30] delay. God moved them on without delay.
[1:32:32] Says and after they were come to Misia
[1:32:35] they as to go into Bethnia.
[1:32:38] It says but the spirit suffered them
[1:32:41] not. Remember commission is full
[1:32:43] permission or permission with full
[1:32:45] power. And how now the word says that
[1:32:47] the spirit suffered them not. It refused
[1:32:50] them permission to go. So now they're
[1:32:53] asking, remember the other one was the
[1:32:55] Holy Spirit was proactively saying do
[1:32:57] not preach in Asia. Move through. It'll
[1:32:59] slow you down. There's people waiting
[1:33:01] for you. Now it didn't say they were we
[1:33:04] know that there was something waiting.
[1:33:05] It just said don't preach preach in
[1:33:06] Asia. Move on through. So they're moving
[1:33:08] on through. And then something in them,
[1:33:10] something in Paul's heart wants to go to
[1:33:12] Bethnia and we don't know why. I'll read
[1:33:14] a quote where brother Brandham says
[1:33:15] gives a reason. I don't think he's
[1:33:17] making it an absolute, but there's
[1:33:18] something in in Paul that wants to go
[1:33:21] there. Now, here's the thing. The first
[1:33:23] time the Holy Spirit said, "So, don't do
[1:33:25] it." But Paul had no inclination in and
[1:33:27] of himself to preach in Asia. He would
[1:33:29] have assumed if we're going through,
[1:33:30] we'll preach. But there wasn't a desire
[1:33:32] in his heart specific for Asia. But now
[1:33:35] there's a desire in his heart to go to
[1:33:37] Bethnia.
[1:33:39] See, that's the test of whether we're
[1:33:41] really under his control.
[1:33:43] If God came down to me today and he
[1:33:45] said, "Now, Brother John, do not go to
[1:33:48] the Arctic to preach the gospel."
[1:33:52] I'd say, "No problem.
[1:33:54] No problem." Wasn't planning to go.
[1:33:58] But if God said, "Jonathan, do not
[1:34:00] preach in church tonight.
[1:34:04] Play a tape." That's a little different,
[1:34:07] isn't it?
[1:34:08] because I've got a desire to preach. I'm
[1:34:10] a pastor. I'm supposed to preach.
[1:34:11] There's something in my heart to preach.
[1:34:14] Maybe I would go visit somewhere
[1:34:18] and I'd have a desire to preach
[1:34:21] and the spirit of God say, "Don't you go
[1:34:23] to that church. Don't you do it. You sit
[1:34:25] down tonight. Let somebody else preach
[1:34:27] the word." That's the test of who's in
[1:34:29] control is when my will comes up against
[1:34:32] his will. When I have a sincere and what
[1:34:35] we would say godly desire to do
[1:34:37] something and God says no that's when we
[1:34:41] find out are we yielded or are we
[1:34:44] stubborn
[1:34:46] amen brother Brandham he faced this very
[1:34:48] thing in South Africa remember he goes
[1:34:50] there and the Holy Spirit had mapped out
[1:34:52] everywhere he was supposed to go and
[1:34:55] when he landed the brother said we're
[1:34:57] going to go to such and such a place he
[1:34:58] says that's not where we're supposed to
[1:35:00] go and they said but this is the way
[1:35:03] we've worked it out. He said, "God told
[1:35:05] me, the spirit of God told me this is
[1:35:07] where we're supposed to go. You're
[1:35:08] supposed to go two weeks here, then
[1:35:09] you're going to go here, and then you're
[1:35:10] going to go here."
[1:35:12] And he they said, "Brother Brandham, is
[1:35:14] it is it possible you could be wrong?" I
[1:35:16] think it was Brother Bosworth said that.
[1:35:17] And he says, "Brothers, it was a
[1:35:19] vision." And brother Bosworth said,
[1:35:21] "Well, then I ain't going to fight
[1:35:22] that." Brother Bosworth knew better. But
[1:35:24] the rest of the brothers fought him on
[1:35:25] it. And they said, "Go back to God."
[1:35:28] Sound like something, church? Balum.
[1:35:31] They're telling the prophet of God to go
[1:35:33] back to God and ask God to change his
[1:35:35] will to do it the way they wanted. And
[1:35:38] God and the spirit of God spoke back to
[1:35:40] brother Bram. He says, "Go." He says,
[1:35:41] "But you'll pay a price and you won't be
[1:35:43] the blessing that you could have been."
[1:35:45] And if you look at brother Brandham's
[1:35:46] story, the only place they got any
[1:35:48] headway was in Durban, South Africa. And
[1:35:50] that's because that's the one place on
[1:35:52] the brother's itinerary that matched up
[1:35:54] with God's itinerary.
[1:35:56] So in their permissive will they landed
[1:35:58] luckily on one place that was God's
[1:36:00] perfect will and that's the only place
[1:36:01] they had it. They got rained out. They
[1:36:04] had brothers fighting brothers. They had
[1:36:05] all sorts of things going on. They got
[1:36:07] sick.
[1:36:09] Brother Abraham I think he said he went
[1:36:11] six or nine or seven or nine months and
[1:36:13] just nothing.
[1:36:16] Why? Because they went against the
[1:36:18] spirit of God.
[1:36:25] God help us. Speaking of Paul, so he's
[1:36:28] talking about this this in Acts 16. Now,
[1:36:30] brother Bram says, "And he knew he could
[1:36:31] not go to places." He says, "Being
[1:36:33] harnessed to this, but yet he wanted to
[1:36:36] go." It's not wrong to have preferences,
[1:36:38] church. It's not wrong to have a
[1:36:39] personal will. It's not wrong to have a
[1:36:42] desire to help or to do something for
[1:36:43] the kingdom of God. That ain't wrong.
[1:36:47] But we have to make sure it's his will
[1:36:48] and not ours.
[1:36:50] He says he knew that his ambition drew
[1:36:53] him amongst brethren where he was
[1:36:54] invited to come. And yet he was pressed
[1:36:56] in the spirit to do something else. He
[1:36:59] wasn't his home. Maybe somebody could
[1:37:00] say, "Brother Paul, we want you to come
[1:37:02] over here because we have the biggest
[1:37:03] church. We have the biggest
[1:37:04] congregation. Your offerings will be
[1:37:06] great." I had a brother tell me one
[1:37:07] time, I think I've said this story
[1:37:09] before. He said, "Brother John," he
[1:37:10] says, "I don't understand these
[1:37:11] preachers." He said, "You send them an
[1:37:13] invitation." He says, "And they say, I
[1:37:14] have to pray about it."
[1:37:16] I said go read in Acts chapter 16 and
[1:37:19] that'll tell you why they have to pray
[1:37:20] about it. Is because an invitation is
[1:37:22] not God's will. It's just an invitation.
[1:37:25] As heartfelt and as sincere and as
[1:37:27] well-meaning as it is, an invitation is
[1:37:29] not necessarily God's will. You have to
[1:37:32] be led by the spirit. Remember, Brother
[1:37:34] Bram said they had that big thing over
[1:37:35] in Germany. They had 1,500 2,000
[1:37:38] ministers alone were going to support
[1:37:40] him in that. And then they had a massive
[1:37:41] place rented for him. And he says, "The
[1:37:43] Holy Spirit told me not to." He went to
[1:37:44] Edmonton, Alberta, and preached to a
[1:37:46] tiny crowd.
[1:37:48] We got to follow the spirit. And it's
[1:37:50] not always going to make sense.
[1:37:54] He says, "But being pressed in the
[1:37:56] spirit, he thought, I got a brother over
[1:37:58] there. I'd like to go over and save this
[1:38:01] brother and get him to the Lord." See
[1:38:03] what he's saying? He's saying this, Paul
[1:38:05] is not all selfish about it. He's
[1:38:07] saying, "There's people over there I
[1:38:08] want to help."
[1:38:11] He says, "But yet the spirit pressed him
[1:38:13] to go somewhere else. He was a
[1:38:15] prisoner." And then he says, "Oh God,
[1:38:17] make us prisoners like that." And we're
[1:38:19] going to preach on this next service
[1:38:20] from our own selfish ambition, from our
[1:38:23] own judgments and our better way of
[1:38:26] thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus
[1:38:28] Christ.
[1:38:30] Going back to Acts 16, he says, "So they
[1:38:34] obeyed time and time. They obeyed." It
[1:38:37] says, "And they passing by Misha came
[1:38:39] down to Trrowass." In other words, they
[1:38:40] stayed right on the path God had told
[1:38:42] them to. They obeyed the spirit. Now,
[1:38:44] watch how this plays out. They've
[1:38:45] obeyed. They've obeyed twice, church,
[1:38:48] not knowing where they need to go, but
[1:38:50] they've obeyed and kept moving the way
[1:38:51] God told him to. It says, "And a vision
[1:38:54] appeared to Paul in the night." See,
[1:38:56] church, once we obey, God opens up the
[1:38:58] way to us. Too often, we're waiting for
[1:39:01] him to show us all of the way rather
[1:39:03] than just the next step. I say, "Lord,
[1:39:05] give me faith to take the next step
[1:39:07] regardless of whether I can see further
[1:39:09] ahead or not. If we can be led, he'll
[1:39:12] keep showing us the way." It's that
[1:39:15] simple. He says, "There stood a man in
[1:39:17] Macedonia and prayed him, saying, "Come
[1:39:19] over unto Macedonia and help us. And
[1:39:21] after he had seen the vision,
[1:39:23] immediately we endeavored to go into
[1:39:24] Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the
[1:39:27] Lord had called for us to preach the
[1:39:29] gospel unto them." And I think I've
[1:39:30] shown the map before that they had to go
[1:39:32] right through a whole bunch of other
[1:39:33] lands to go all the way to Macedonia.
[1:39:35] They skipped a ton of places where they
[1:39:37] could have preached to go to Macedonia
[1:39:38] because there was a Macedonian call.
[1:39:40] There was people there ready to receive
[1:39:41] the gospel.
[1:39:43] The Bible says it this way. You can
[1:39:45] never never go forward until you're
[1:39:48] perfectly satisfied and know without a
[1:39:50] shadow of a doubt you're walking in
[1:39:52] God's will. Then when you know that
[1:39:54] you're in God's will and walking in his
[1:39:57] way, nothing can stop you because you
[1:40:00] know where you're standing. Do we have
[1:40:03] that assurance this evening? We're
[1:40:05] making decisions. You brothers with
[1:40:08] businesses, you're making decisions. Can
[1:40:09] you say, "I know for beyond a shadow of
[1:40:11] a doubt, I'm walking in his will."
[1:40:14] For all those of us that are making
[1:40:16] career decisions, school decisions,
[1:40:20] the ways we spend our time decisions,
[1:40:21] can we say, "I know I'm in his will."
[1:40:25] He says, "You know the way you're going.
[1:40:28] You know what you have in your mind, and
[1:40:30] you know what the will of God is, and
[1:40:32] you can do it."
[1:40:34] So, where should we spend the most of
[1:40:35] our time, church?
[1:40:37] Seeking his will. Seeking his will. And
[1:40:40] when you found his will, stay it. Just
[1:40:43] stay there. and do it and do it and do
[1:40:46] it until he changes your direction.
[1:40:50] It's so simple.
[1:40:52] But we got to take time to do it.
[1:40:55] We got to take time to do it.
[1:40:58] Not asking for things, not asking for
[1:41:01] stuff, not asking for blessings, asking
[1:41:04] for his will. That's what's going to get
[1:41:07] us ahead.
[1:41:08] He says, "It came to pass, now they're
[1:41:10] in Macedonia. As we went to prayer, a
[1:41:13] certain damsel possessed with a spirit
[1:41:15] of divination met us, which brought her
[1:41:17] masters much gain by Susain." So, this
[1:41:19] is a a young woman that's got a a
[1:41:21] demonic spirit that tells the future.
[1:41:24] Tells the future. The same followed Paul
[1:41:28] and us and cried saying, "These men are
[1:41:30] the servants of the most high God, which
[1:41:33] show us under show us the way of
[1:41:35] salvation." It's amazing that this woman
[1:41:36] is filled with the spirit of a demon and
[1:41:40] yet she's speaking the truth.
[1:41:44] They know the spirit of God. How many
[1:41:47] times was Brother approached by these
[1:41:49] strange people, these these women that
[1:41:50] were, you know, palm readers and and
[1:41:52] different ones, and she'd say, "There's
[1:41:53] a light that follows you, and there's a
[1:41:55] sign behind you, and when were you born
[1:41:57] and all these things?" See, they catch
[1:41:58] something.
[1:42:01] Remember what the the the the demons
[1:42:03] that were in that that demoniac in Gera
[1:42:06] said, "Don't cast us out before it's our
[1:42:08] time. Let us go into the pigs." They
[1:42:10] knew exactly who he was.
[1:42:13] It's scary that Satan can identify us
[1:42:15] more clearly than so-called Christians.
[1:42:20] She made a living. They made a living.
[1:42:22] The people that owned her made a living
[1:42:23] off of telling people what they wanted
[1:42:25] to hear. But when the spirit of God came
[1:42:27] her way, she told the absolute truth.
[1:42:30] It says, "And this she did many days."
[1:42:34] Church, if we had power, what would we
[1:42:36] have done in that situation?
[1:42:39] I'm speaking in the flesh.
[1:42:41] When something like that happens, when
[1:42:43] we see situations, when we see people
[1:42:45] that are bound, when we see hardships,
[1:42:47] when we see areas where we think we
[1:42:49] could help, what is our inclination? Put
[1:42:51] the power to work.
[1:42:54] She's got a a a spirit on her. She's
[1:42:57] possessed by a demon. Let's get rid of
[1:42:59] it. Bring her to the front. Let's pray
[1:43:01] it out of her. That's what the flesh
[1:43:03] wants to do. That's what the flesh wants
[1:43:05] to do. But remember, absolute power is
[1:43:08] subject to an absolute. And I'm not an
[1:43:10] absolute and neither are you. Watch what
[1:43:12] Paul does. Now, see, our tendency is to
[1:43:15] show power.
[1:43:18] That's the that's the inclination of the
[1:43:19] flesh is to show what you got. and its
[1:43:22] its intention, as good as it may be, is
[1:43:24] ultimately selfish to show it, to flex
[1:43:29] it.
[1:43:31] But that's not what Paul does.
[1:43:35] Paul's got authority, but Paul's under
[1:43:38] power.
[1:43:40] Watch this. It says, "But Paul," now
[1:43:43] this went on for many days.
[1:43:45] It says, "But Paul being grieved turned
[1:43:47] and said to the spirit,"I command thee
[1:43:49] in the name of Jesus Christ to come out
[1:43:51] of her." And he came out the same hour.
[1:43:54] Brother Bram says it this way. He says,
[1:43:55] "One day Paul and Silas coming down the
[1:43:57] street in a certain city where they were
[1:43:59] holding a revival, and a little
[1:44:00] demon-possessed girl kept following him,
[1:44:03] crying out after him. And no doubt, but
[1:44:06] Paul knew that he had the authority as
[1:44:07] an apostle to rebuke that evil spirit
[1:44:10] out of that woman."
[1:44:12] You can see that in scripture like I
[1:44:13] mentioned earlier with Elisha. He had
[1:44:15] authority as a prophet of God to speak
[1:44:18] and have God do it.
[1:44:21] You talk about needing character.
[1:44:24] You talk about needing character. He
[1:44:26] says, "But did you notice he waited day
[1:44:30] after day until all of a sudden the Holy
[1:44:33] Spirit spoke to him and said, this is
[1:44:35] the hour." He says, "Then he said, thou
[1:44:37] spirit come out of her." See, he knew to
[1:44:40] wait on the Lord. If we could interpret
[1:44:42] scripture the way the prophet tells us,
[1:44:44] Paul did not get grieved until God got
[1:44:47] grieved.
[1:44:48] That girl testified for day after day
[1:44:51] cuz people believed her. And she was
[1:44:54] used for a while to actually testify of
[1:44:56] the truth of the gospel and the ministry
[1:44:59] of Paul and those that were with him.
[1:45:01] But eventually, what? Mercy dropped
[1:45:03] down. Mercy dropped down and it said
[1:45:06] enough is enough. And then that's when
[1:45:08] Paul got grieved, church. This wasn't an
[1:45:10] emotional response. This was a spirit of
[1:45:13] God response that said, "Today's the
[1:45:14] day. Enough is enough. We're going to
[1:45:18] deliver you." And he cast that demon
[1:45:19] right out of her right there. Church,
[1:45:21] this wasn't Paul's feelings. This was
[1:45:24] absolute power
[1:45:26] pouring through Paul.
[1:45:29] He waited and he waited and he waited
[1:45:32] until what? The spirit of God moved him.
[1:45:35] Paul's not trying to show off.
[1:45:38] Paul did so many things. He said, "I
[1:45:40] speak in tongues more than you. When I
[1:45:41] came, I was in power and demonstration
[1:45:43] of the spirit. My words are simple." Any
[1:45:46] gift you wanted to operate, Paul seemed
[1:45:48] to have it. Any demonstration, sign or
[1:45:50] wonder, Paul had he seemed to have it.
[1:45:53] But he wasn't going around showing off.
[1:45:55] He was led by the spirit of God.
[1:45:58] But Ram says there's one there's this is
[1:46:01] where so many people today bring a
[1:46:02] reproach upon the word. They go out with
[1:46:05] an ambition. How many revivals, he says,
[1:46:07] have been left flat because of a thing
[1:46:09] like that because the evangelist doesn't
[1:46:11] wait to us, wait to see what the Lord
[1:46:13] has got to say. Some of them say, "Come
[1:46:15] over here." And they go right now
[1:46:17] because the association said, "Go." He
[1:46:19] says, "And the Holy Spirit would say
[1:46:21] something different." He says, "Yet the
[1:46:23] ambition of the man to become the state
[1:46:25] presbyer or something or another, some
[1:46:27] elder, some bishop or something would
[1:46:29] pull him. You must go." And yet he knows
[1:46:31] better. the Holy Spirit saying, "Go
[1:46:33] here." See, but he's yolked to his
[1:46:35] organization. He's a prisoner to the
[1:46:37] organization. But if he's yoked to
[1:46:39] Christ, he's led by the Holy Ghost. See,
[1:46:41] he's yolked, a prisoner. Doesn't make
[1:46:43] any difference what anything else what
[1:46:46] anything else says. He says a sounding
[1:46:48] brass and a tinkling symbol. He hears
[1:46:50] only the voice of God and he speaks only
[1:46:53] when it comes out. He says nothing. Now,
[1:46:56] so often, Brother Brand would speak
[1:46:58] about ministry and we tend to apply
[1:46:59] these quotes that way. But he's
[1:47:01] preaching to you. Behold, I said unto
[1:47:04] you, Elijah the prophet. He's preaching
[1:47:06] to you. He's not just preaching to
[1:47:08] ministers. He's preaching to the entire
[1:47:10] body of Christ and saying, listen,
[1:47:11] you've got to not be led by your
[1:47:13] ambition. You've got to be led by the
[1:47:14] spirit of God. And so, you can take
[1:47:17] something like this and you can apply it
[1:47:18] to your brothers that are running your
[1:47:20] businesses. What is my ambition? Is my
[1:47:23] ambition to grow my business and make
[1:47:26] everybody see how successful I am? or is
[1:47:29] my ambition to be led by the spirit of
[1:47:31] God to be as big as he wants me to get?
[1:47:33] Because I'll tell you this, if where you
[1:47:35] are now is already impinging on your
[1:47:38] relationship with God, he ain't going to
[1:47:40] grow your business.
[1:47:42] If you can't do what you're required to
[1:47:44] do in the body of Christ, why would he
[1:47:45] bless your business?
[1:47:47] It would be Satan that would bless it to
[1:47:50] try and what? Take you further and
[1:47:52] further away when you make career
[1:47:54] decisions.
[1:47:56] We're going to talk on this more next
[1:47:58] service, Lord willing. Brothers, even
[1:48:00] sisters, when you make career decisions,
[1:48:03] every opportunity is not God's
[1:48:06] opportunity. That's not the way it
[1:48:08] works. I've had so many opportunities to
[1:48:10] move elsewhere, take different jobs,
[1:48:13] make better money, bigger titles, and
[1:48:15] guess what? They weren't God's will.
[1:48:18] They were just opportunities. Greener
[1:48:20] pastures as we'll dwell on in the next
[1:48:22] service. What's best for us financially,
[1:48:26] materially, in our career
[1:48:30] is not always God's will for us. That's
[1:48:32] not the way that it works out. Amen. A
[1:48:34] brother told me about a young football
[1:48:35] player down in the States and he was a
[1:48:38] phenomenal phenomenal athlete and he was
[1:48:40] a he was going to go in the first round
[1:48:43] for the professional football draft. And
[1:48:46] this brother was a minister and he went
[1:48:47] to him and he said, "Listen, you've got
[1:48:48] a lot of influence because of your skill
[1:48:51] and because of the gift that you have
[1:48:52] athletically." He says, he says, "You
[1:48:54] need to give that to God." He says, "And
[1:48:57] I'm asking you," he says, "to lay it
[1:48:59] aside that you could go and influence
[1:49:00] young people in the ministry."
[1:49:03] Not as a minister. That's a call. You
[1:49:06] can't put that on somebody. But he says
[1:49:08] to use that influence and and talk to
[1:49:10] young men and talk to those that look up
[1:49:13] and use what you have for God. And that
[1:49:16] young man turned him down and he got
[1:49:18] injured his first year. And as far as I
[1:49:20] know, he's never played again. But he'd
[1:49:22] walked away from God, so he lost that as
[1:49:24] well. See, it was opportunity, but it
[1:49:26] wasn't God's opportunity.
[1:49:30] We do so many things as believers that
[1:49:33] defy logic, that defy reason, that don't
[1:49:36] make financial sense. They don't make a
[1:49:39] lot of senses.
[1:49:41] I've moved to so many places for so many
[1:49:43] stupid reasons in the eyes of the world.
[1:49:46] I say that I've walked away from the
[1:49:49] best highpaying jobs that I could get.
[1:49:51] I've turned down highpaying jobs. I've
[1:49:54] moved away from ministry that supported
[1:49:56] me to go to places where they didn't
[1:49:58] support me.
[1:50:00] Makes no sense.
[1:50:03] I went from good to not so good many,
[1:50:06] many times. Why? The leading of the
[1:50:10] spirit of God. I look around here and I
[1:50:12] see many people that have paid a price.
[1:50:15] And the older you are, the more prices
[1:50:17] you probably paid at this point. That's
[1:50:19] the way it works. But what? We've got to
[1:50:22] be led by the spirit, not by what this
[1:50:24] flesh wants. Not by the idea that if
[1:50:26] it's an opportunity and it's a possible
[1:50:27] blessing, then it must be God.
[1:50:29] Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Satan's
[1:50:32] trying to get us away with every bright
[1:50:34] and shiny thing that he can throw our
[1:50:35] way. And a lot of times, it's an
[1:50:37] opportunity that has nothing to do with
[1:50:39] our work in the kingdom of God.
[1:50:42] Going to close with one quote here.
[1:50:43] Brother Brandon would talk about his
[1:50:44] move from Jeffersonville. And remember,
[1:50:46] Jeffersonville for him was home for so
[1:50:48] long. He laid the cornerstone of the
[1:50:50] church there. It was a miracle that they
[1:50:52] got the building that they built it up
[1:50:54] and then they rebuilt it and did all
[1:50:55] these things, built it into a bigger
[1:50:57] place and that was his home place. It
[1:50:59] was it was a comfortable place for him.
[1:51:01] It was where God had done so many
[1:51:03] wonderful things. And then the spirit of
[1:51:04] God told him, "Move west."
[1:51:07] And when he moved west, church, life got
[1:51:09] harder, not easier. Did you know that
[1:51:14] life got harder? Listen to this. He
[1:51:16] says, "Why am I there?"
[1:51:19] He's talking about being in Tucson. He
[1:51:21] says, "It's the most ridiculous thing."
[1:51:25] You know, we're allowed to say that
[1:51:27] because he's not dissing God. He's not
[1:51:29] putting down God. He's saying, "Look, if
[1:51:31] you look at this in a carnal way, it's
[1:51:33] ridiculous what I'm doing." He says,
[1:51:35] "I'm sitting out there in the desert.
[1:51:37] Who wants that? Sill. Who wants to sit
[1:51:39] out in the desert? Who wants sunshine
[1:51:41] and heat?" And the church of the living
[1:51:44] God says, "Amen." Right.
[1:51:48] Right. He says, "I'm sitting out there
[1:51:50] in the desert paying $110 a month."
[1:51:53] Wouldn't we love to go back to that? I
[1:51:55] We Blanc and I were talking the other
[1:51:56] day. Our first apartment was $275 a
[1:51:59] month, which when you think of it, that
[1:52:00] was 40 years after Brother Brandham
[1:52:02] left. That's not bad. But I did the math
[1:52:05] on this. Okay? I did the math on this.
[1:52:07] So, let me finish the quote and then
[1:52:09] I'll come back. He says, "I'm paying
[1:52:10] $110 a month in rent." He says, "And
[1:52:13] here is a house sitting up here, a
[1:52:15] parsonage furnished to me." See, he
[1:52:18] says, "But it's following the Lord."
[1:52:20] See, that's all I know to do. You do the
[1:52:23] math, and he's still doing okay.
[1:52:26] Back then, they made about $6,200 a
[1:52:28] year, about $517 a month. So, his rent
[1:52:32] was 25% of his gross income. Today in
[1:52:34] Canada, it's about 77,000. Sorry, 74,000
[1:52:38] a year. So, just over $6,100 a month. So
[1:52:40] that'd be about $1,300 a month. So he
[1:52:43] went from a house that was fully
[1:52:45] furnished with no payments to a house
[1:52:48] that he had to furnish, paying about 13
[1:52:51] 12 or 1,300 bucks a month for it. And he
[1:52:53] says, "It's ridiculous. I'm sitting out
[1:52:55] there in the desert. It's not where I
[1:52:57] want to be, and it's costing me more
[1:53:00] than it cost me here.
[1:53:04] It's ridiculous." Anybody had any
[1:53:07] ridiculous moments in their life?
[1:53:10] I need like 17 hands to do it.
[1:53:13] But remember, it'll make you do things
[1:53:16] you wouldn't ordinarily do.
[1:53:20] It won't make sense to the world. It
[1:53:24] just won't. Church, if our decisions in
[1:53:26] every way line up with what people
[1:53:27] around us in the world expect us to do,
[1:53:29] let me tell you one thing. You're off
[1:53:32] the word and will of God.
[1:53:35] because it won't make sense. It cannot
[1:53:37] make sense. Sometimes it will, but if
[1:53:39] all the time we're doing it exactly the
[1:53:41] way the world does it, we've missed the
[1:53:43] ball completely. We're completely out.
[1:53:46] Brother Brandham went from a furnished
[1:53:48] house, no payments, easy living to
[1:53:52] having to make payments, and fill out a
[1:53:55] house with furniture all over again in
[1:53:58] Tucson.
[1:54:00] Sorry, Sil in Tucson. He's like, it's
[1:54:03] ridiculous.
[1:54:06] What did brother Bram say? Sunny skies
[1:54:10] are not evidence of his will or good
[1:54:11] grace, nor cloudy skies, his displeasure
[1:54:15] or disfavor. Amen. Let's stand.
[1:54:20] We're preaching on absolute power,
[1:54:23] but to me it really looks like absolute
[1:54:25] surrender.
[1:54:26] That's what absolute power is. Is
[1:54:28] absolute surrender. A total selling out
[1:54:30] to the word of God. Amen. total selling
[1:54:32] out to the leading of the spirit no
[1:54:34] matter the cost.
[1:54:37] As I said earlier, I look around and I
[1:54:38] see people that have paid a price.
[1:54:41] You pay a price to do the right thing.
[1:54:44] You pay a price to not get revenge, to
[1:54:48] not push back, to absorb that slap
[1:54:50] across the face and then the one that
[1:54:53] comes behind it.
[1:54:55] the loss of family and relationship and
[1:54:58] ministry at times even
[1:55:00] we paid prices to do the right thing.
[1:55:04] Amen. But our rewards waiting for us.
[1:55:07] Amen. I think you sang bula land
[1:55:09] earlier, didn't you? Did I hear that?
[1:55:12] That's our That's our reward, isn't it?
[1:55:15] When we get to fly away.
[1:55:19] This is something I just see in my head.
[1:55:24] Brother Bob and you're going through the
[1:55:25] air
[1:55:27] and you've got brown hair, I would
[1:55:28] presume, like you used to have.
[1:55:31] Your face is square jawed,
[1:55:35] handsome, muscled up, and you're looking
[1:55:37] at me and you're saying, "It was really
[1:55:40] worth it." Amen. Sister Brenda, walking
[1:55:44] away from family the way you did, it's
[1:55:46] not going to matter. You won't feel it.
[1:55:49] It will not even enter your thought.
[1:55:54] We sing that song, it will be worth it
[1:55:56] all. Sometimes we need to think about
[1:55:58] what's waiting for us rather than what's
[1:56:00] we're dealing with right here and now.
[1:56:03] Cuz what awaits us is so far beyond what
[1:56:05] we could ever ask or think or imagine,
[1:56:10] the trials of this life, the hardships,
[1:56:12] the things that have fallen away, the
[1:56:14] things that we've laid down willingly by
[1:56:16] God's grace,
[1:56:18] the hardships that we face day by day
[1:56:20] because of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:23] It'll all be worth it all when we're
[1:56:25] flying through the air. When that knock
[1:56:27] on that door comes and you see a saint
[1:56:30] that's gone on and you know I'm all
[1:56:33] beyond a shadow of a doubt. I'm one of
[1:56:35] the few.
[1:56:37] I'm going to make it. I believed it, but
[1:56:39] now I know I'm going to make it. And you
[1:56:42] have sweet fellowship for 30 to 40 days.
[1:56:45] You talk about having meetings, church.
[1:56:48] We won't need to have meetings anymore.
[1:56:51] We won't need to preach the word. The
[1:56:52] doors will be closed by then. But we'll
[1:56:55] know I'm going to make it.
[1:56:58] You talk about a shouting. You talk
[1:57:00] about revival. Some of us might even
[1:57:02] speak in tongues.
[1:57:05] Some of us might dance in the spirit.
[1:57:07] Some of us might finally let go. What
[1:57:09] I'm saying this evening, you don't have
[1:57:10] to wait till then to thank God to
[1:57:14] worship him for the privilege of giving
[1:57:17] your life
[1:57:19] for him to use, of yielding yourself to
[1:57:22] him. Amen.
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:27] There's a reward that comes with
[1:57:28] humility and surrender.
[1:57:32] Next service we're going to talk about
[1:57:33] is stripping down.
[1:57:35] Let me tell you, the further you go with
[1:57:36] God, the more of a stripping down there
[1:57:38] happens where he takes away every bit of
[1:57:41] self.
[1:57:43] Takes away that pride, that arrogance,
[1:57:46] that need for control.
[1:57:50] But he also strips away that I can't do
[1:57:51] it attitude and I'm not good enough and
[1:57:55] he'll never forgive me and I'm never
[1:57:58] going to get the victory. That's the
[1:57:59] thing, church. When he strips, he strips
[1:58:01] away everything that Satan's laid on us.
[1:58:03] Not just the stuff that we like, he also
[1:58:05] sets us free from the things that have
[1:58:07] bound us for so long. Amen. We speak of
[1:58:10] adoption. We speak of authority and
[1:58:11] gifts and all these things. But before
[1:58:14] we preach that, we've got to preach of
[1:58:15] the preparation of God to get us ready
[1:58:17] for those things. And that's what we're
[1:58:19] preaching in this series. Amen. God
[1:58:22] bless you. God bless you each one this
[1:58:24] evening. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[1:58:26] Jesus,
[1:58:27] Lord, I just want to thank you for your
[1:58:29] word. Lord, I want to thank you for the
[1:58:32] promise of your spirit upon us, Lord.
[1:58:34] That it would make us do things we
[1:58:35] didn't think we could ever do, Lord.
[1:58:38] That it would help us to lay our lives
[1:58:39] aside, our will aside, our thoughts
[1:58:41] aside, our preferences aside, our
[1:58:43] feelings aside, Lord, our very uh way of
[1:58:48] making a living,
[1:58:50] Lord, to make you the preeminent one in
[1:58:52] our lives.
[1:58:54] Lord, we're holding to your promise this
[1:58:56] evening,
[1:58:58] Lord. you told your your disciples.
[1:59:02] If we'll lay it all down, if you forsake
[1:59:04] mother and father and houses and lands,
[1:59:07] you'll be granted a hundfold and more.
[1:59:10] Lord, we haven't lost anything when
[1:59:12] we've laid it down to serve you, Lord,
[1:59:14] but we've gained everything when we lay
[1:59:16] down these temporary things that we tend
[1:59:18] to hold on to. Lord, I pray you bless
[1:59:21] your people. Lord, I pray you encourage
[1:59:23] us, Lord, in the trials that we face.
[1:59:26] Lord, I pray you break down our
[1:59:28] resistance.
[1:59:30] Help us to take our hands off the wheel,
[1:59:32] Lord God.
[1:59:34] Help us to humble ourselves, our
[1:59:35] thoughts, our ideas, our judgments,
[1:59:38] our ambitions, Lord, whatever it might
[1:59:40] be this evening, Lord. And maybe we're a
[1:59:43] little too humble, Lord, and we don't
[1:59:45] see ourselves the way you see us, Lord.
[1:59:47] I pray your spirit and your word would
[1:59:48] lift us up, Lord, that we'd see the
[1:59:51] regard that you have for your bride that
[1:59:53] you've called out.
[1:59:55] Lord, bless us we pray. Lord, help us to
[1:59:57] be surrendered and obedient day by day.
[2:00:00] In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.

[2:00:09] desire. 10:19
