[23:53] sin running rampant, Father, to realize,
[23:56] Lord, that you died for a small group of
[23:58] people, Father, that would accept that
[24:00] redemption, Lord, and Father, just be,
[24:04] Lord, among those, Father, that will by
[24:06] grace, Lord, very soon be able to go
[24:08] into that rapture, Lord, and go and be
[24:11] with you, Lord, forever. And so, Lord,
[24:13] we pray that you'd forgive us of our
[24:15] sins and mistakes and all that we've
[24:17] done wrong. Lord, we pray, Father. May
[24:19] it all be cast into the sea of your
[24:21] forgetfulness, Father, this day. And

[24:26] come into your house and come into your
[24:28] presence, Father, and know that it's not
[24:30] in vain because you said you would be
[24:32] here. And, Father, we're just counting
[24:34] on that today, Lord. And praying,
[24:35] Father, that you would bless our brother
[24:37] as he comes, Lord.
[24:40] Father comes to bring the word of the
[24:41] Lord which will increase our faith and
[24:43] it'll get us by grace closer to you,
[24:46] Lord. And Father, we're just thankful
[24:48] for the sacrifice he's made to come this
[24:50] far, Lord. And and just praying, Lord,
[24:52] that you would reward them, Father,

[24:58] each and every soul that is gathered in
[25:00] here tonight, Father, there are many
[25:02] needs and many burdens, Father, upon the
[25:05] hearts of your people. We just pray,
[25:06] Father, that you'd help us to claim the
[25:08] promises that we have need of in faith,
[25:10] Lord, tonight to leave our burdens at
[25:12] the foot of the cross, Lord, and let you
[25:15] deal with them, Father, by grace. And
[25:17] Lord, praying for Brother Dale,
[25:19] especially, Lord, tonight, Father,
[25:21] knowing, Lord, that after talking to
[25:23] him, Father, that he's at peace, Lord,
[25:25] with whatever it is you have in store
[25:27] for him. And we just pray, Lord, that
[25:29] your grace would be his portion. Give
[25:31] him rest, Father, body, soul, and

[43:46] I'm expecting hungry hearts and souls
[43:48] that will get in there, get our shoulder
[43:50] to the wheel, start pulling on the word.
[43:52] We want to ring him out. We We want him
[43:54] to go home so tired. He doesn't want to
[43:56] come back again for another year. Amen.
[43:58] Let's get the most out of it. Amen. This
[44:00] is a rare opportunity for us to come in
[44:03] and just dedicate a whole weekend to the
[44:05] hearing of the word, to the praising of
[44:07] our God, to thank him. Amen. And we
[44:09] expect him to do wonderful, wonderful
[44:11] things in our midst if we'll give
[44:12] everything we've got. Amen. Certainly
[44:14] want to welcome brother Jonathan Martin
[44:16] here up from Bluffton, Ohio. Right. Is
[44:19] that right? Bluffton, Ohio. Did a
[44:21] two-hour drive to the airport in Detroit
[44:23] and then flew up to be with us. Last
[44:25] time I saw him was Lufkin, Texas back,
[44:27] we think in 2008. So it's been close to
[44:30] 17 years, give or take, since we've seen
[44:32] him. Our kids are almost the same age as
[44:34] he's got one more. He's winning. But um
[44:37] it's been wonderful. I I've had
[44:38] wonderful fellowship with him. when I
[44:40] did see him and his family comes from a
[44:42] a family of preachers, a princes of pe
[44:44] preachers, even if we wanted to call it
[44:46] that. So, I have high expectations. When
[44:48] we came out of the house this evening,
[44:51] uh Samuel said, he said, um, "Is he a
[44:54] good preacher?" I said, "Yes." He said,
[44:56] "Is he better than you?" I said,
[44:58] "Yes." It's all about comparisons,
[45:01] right? So, it's not about the preacher,
[45:03] it's about the yielded vessel. Amen. and
[45:04] we're trusting the Lord to speak tonight
[45:07] and that he would just have free reign
[45:08] in our lives and in the service tonight.
[45:10] So, we're going to sing that song. I
[45:12] need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Right
[45:14] now, we'll turn over to Brother
[45:15] Jonathan. I've told him, you have full
[45:17] liberty. Take your time. Just preach
[45:20] whatever the Lord lays on your heart and
[45:21] we'll trust him to to achieve what he
[45:23] wants to do tonight. Amen. Amen. Let's
[45:26] just sing this as we pass it over to
[45:28] him. I need you, Lord.
[45:32] I need you,
[45:34] Lord, right
[45:40] now. I need you,
[45:43] Lord. I need you,
[45:46] Lord, right
[45:51] now. I lift my hands.
[45:55] I bow my knees to worship
[46:00] at your
[46:04] throne. I need you,
[46:08] Lord. I need you, Lord, right
[46:12] [Laughter]
[46:14] now. I need you,
[46:17] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[46:23] [Music]
[46:26] I need you,
[46:27] Lord. I need you,
[46:30] Lord, right now.
[46:37] I lift my
[46:39] hands, bow my
[46:41] knee to
[46:45] worship your
[46:48] throne. I need you, Lord.
[46:53] I need you, Lord, right now. Hallelujah.
[47:00] Can you say with all of your heart that
[47:02] you need the Lord?
[47:05] You know, I I know that God always gives
[47:08] us what we have need of. And if we can
[47:12] just recognize that we have a need of
[47:15] him, then he promised to fill us,
[47:18] promised to refill us, and he promised
[47:20] to be everything that we would have need
[47:23] of him in this age. And you know, we we
[47:27] come in a a special meeting like this.
[47:30] And how many would just like to uh just
[47:33] just lay your heart exposed before the
[47:36] Lord and and just say exactly what you
[47:39] would have need of. Maybe you just need
[47:42] healing. Maybe you need deliverance.
[47:44] Maybe you need a refilling. I I think we
[47:47] can all say, "Lord, refill me." And you
[47:50] can just lift your cup up and go ahead
[47:52] and just empty it from everything else
[47:55] and just set aside these uh these few
[47:58] few days and just say, "Lord, uh just
[48:01] visit me aresh and refill me and resir
[48:05] my soul. Rekindkindle the flame within
[48:07] my heart." And why don't we just go
[48:09] ahead and uh just invite him in in your
[48:12] own way, in your your heart. Why don't
[48:15] we just ask him to come and visit us in
[48:18] a real special supernatural way uh this
[48:22] weekend? Father, we just
[48:26] humbly bow our hearts before your throne
[48:29] of
[48:30] grace, recognizing that we're in divine
[48:34] presence, Lord, recognizing our
[48:37] smallalness and our need for you. But
[48:40] Lord, we've come to the right place. We
[48:44] recognize that you come where you're
[48:47] invited. And Lord, from the very
[48:49] beginning of this service, Lord, there
[48:52] was a special hunger, a special thirst
[48:55] within our hearts. Lord, a special
[48:58] request that you would come and feel
[49:01] welcome among us, Lord. We invite your
[49:05] presence, Father. I It's not that they
[49:08] invited a minister, Lord. even though
[49:12] you use a minister, Lord, uh the
[49:15] five-fold ministry is what you use to
[49:18] minister your word, but more
[49:21] importantly, Lord, we recognize that
[49:24] you're invited and that you're the same
[49:27] yesterday, today, and forever. You're
[49:30] the mighty God that has been unveiled
[49:33] among us in this hour. We see that you
[49:36] are Jesus Christ, the great physician,
[49:39] the great mighty conqueror, the great
[49:42] deliverer, the great enforcer of your
[49:45] word, the the one who can fill us and
[49:48] refill us with the Holy Ghost and and
[49:51] supply all of our needs according to
[49:54] your riches and glory. Father, we invite
[49:57] you to come and we pray that you feel so
[50:01] welcome that you would do exactly what
[50:04] your desire is, Lord, for this weekend.
[50:08] Move in a real supernatural way. We ask
[50:11] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:16] Amen. And amen. God richly bless you. Uh
[50:21] you can be seated for uh a few moments.
[50:24] It's a real privilege to uh be here and
[50:29] uh we just uh bring greetings from uh
[50:32] our pastor, brother Wayne Lawson, and uh
[50:36] the church there in uh in Bluffton, True
[50:39] Word Tabernacle. And uh it's a real uh
[50:43] real honor to uh be able to just share
[50:46] the word uh with you this weekend. And
[50:50] uh you know uh as your pastor said, it's
[50:54] been a few years uh since we become
[50:57] acquainted and uh a lot of things have
[51:00] transpired in those years. Uh but we're
[51:03] still standing by the grace of God and
[51:06] still pressing the battle and still
[51:09] believe uh this message with all that is
[51:12] within us. And uh we're that much uh
[51:15] closer to the coming of the Lord. And uh
[51:17] we're believing that it could happen any
[51:20] day. And uh the same testimony that we
[51:24] confessed uh throughout these years,
[51:27] it's never changed. And uh never
[51:29] wavered. And I'm I'm so glad to see that
[51:32] in your pastor as well and uh his
[51:35] family. And uh we just appreciate the
[51:38] invite to uh be able to come uh this
[51:41] weekend and share the word with you. And
[51:44] uh you know uh I feel like I'm the least
[51:47] of the preachers. Uh I I don't know uh
[51:51] you know some sometimes I wonder uh what
[51:55] am I doing up here? Uh but we realize
[51:58] that it's it's not about the man, it's
[52:01] not about the vessel, but it's about the
[52:03] word. And if we could just uh just the
[52:07] the little gift that God has given us uh
[52:10] just express uh the word and uh we we
[52:14] realize that God has sent his word uh to
[52:18] heal, to deliver, to set the captives
[52:20] free. It's all about the word and uh we
[52:24] know as long as we we preach the word
[52:27] well then the mighty enforcer always
[52:30] accompanies the word. Uh because you
[52:33] can't separate the word, the letter from
[52:36] the from the spirit because they're the
[52:38] same. And uh so you know uh I pray that
[52:42] you come with an expectation uh because
[52:45] you always get what you expect. Ain't
[52:47] that right? And uh I don't care if
[52:50] you're the youngest or you're the
[52:52] oldest. Uh God can meet you in a real
[52:56] real supernatural way because he
[52:58] promised to do so. And uh we're just
[53:02] going to I' I'd like to just sing a song
[53:04] for you if that's
[53:20] okay these days. And
[53:24] uh but there's a song that uh
[53:31] It's a song that I was thinking
[53:36] about. Is this
[53:39] good? Paul said, "Perilous
[53:44] times are
[53:47] [Music]
[53:49] coming. There'll be no love for the
[53:53] truth.
[53:56] Hearts are
[53:58] growing
[54:02] heavy. The bride is just a
[54:08] few while they're making things
[54:13] ready for
[54:16] tribulation and doom.
[54:21] I am making myself
[54:25] ready. I know the rapture is
[54:31] soon. Yes, I know it is their time. But
[54:37] I know it's my time,
[54:43] too. And this is my time to fight.
[54:51] to take a stand for what is
[54:56] right. Leave all the world far, far
[55:01] behind. Press toward the mark found in
[55:07] Christ. Be not entangled with the cares
[55:11] of this
[55:13] life. Stand for truth in what is right.
[55:18] Tonight I'm called to
[55:22] overcome and this is my
[55:30] time. There's never been a
[55:33] [Music]
[55:36] day like this day we're in. You believe
[55:41] that Satan's
[55:43] fighting
[55:47] harder than he's ever
[55:52] been. But the true seed has been
[55:57] restored to power and
[56:03] royal. Satan's kingdom is crashing down.
[56:09] Through the power of the
[56:14] word, the voice of the groom isn't heard
[56:20] on truth. She's standing
[56:26] firm. And this is our time to
[56:33] fight. To take a stand for what is
[56:39] right. Leave all the world far, far
[56:44] behind. Press toward the mark found in
[56:50] Christ. Be not entangled with the cares
[56:54] of this life.
[56:57] Stand for truth in what is
[57:01] right. We're called to
[57:05] overcome. This is our
[57:10] time. Oh, this is our time to
[57:18] fight, to take a stand for what is
[57:23] right. Leave all the world far, far
[57:29] behind. Press toward the mark found in
[57:35] Christ. Be not entangled with the cares
[57:38] of this
[57:40] life. Stand for truth in what is
[57:45] right. We're called to
[57:49] overcome and this is our
[57:54] time.
[57:56] Oh, we're called to
[58:00] overcome and this is our
[58:08] time.
[58:10] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that you can
[58:12] say
[58:16] God sent us a prophet to identify the
[58:20] time that we're living
[58:21] in and he would say
[58:26] that take the scripture and say rise and
[58:30] shine for thy light has
[58:34] come. And so if you have your
[58:43] Bibles, I'd like to turn to Mark the 9th
[58:49] chapter, the uh beginning at verse
[58:55] 17, and we'll just read down to the uh
[58:59] 23rd
[59:03] verse, and then we'll will uh just turn
[59:07] over to Mark the 11th chapter as well
[59:11] and read verses 22-
[59:18] 26. And one of the multitude answered,
[59:22] and said, Master, I have brought unto
[59:25] thee my son, which thou which hath a
[59:28] dumb spirit, and wheresoever he taketh
[59:31] him, he teareth him, and he foamth, and
[59:36] nasheth with his teeth, and pineth away.
[59:39] And I spake to thy disciples that they
[59:42] should cast him out, and they could not.
[59:46] He answered him and said, "Oh faithless
[59:50] generation, how long shall I be with
[59:53] you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring
[59:57] him unto me." And they brought him unto
[1:00:01] him. And when he saw him, straightway
[1:00:04] the spirit tear him. And he fell on the
[1:00:07] ground and wallowed foaming. And he
[1:00:11] asked his father, "How long is it ago uh
[1:00:15] since this came unto him?" And he said
[1:00:18] of a child, and of times it hath cast
[1:00:22] him into the fire, and into the waters
[1:00:26] to destroy him. But if thou can't do
[1:00:30] anything, now I just want to put
[1:00:33] emphasis on this. He's asking Jesus,
[1:00:37] "But if thou can't do anything, have
[1:00:41] compassion on us and help us." But
[1:00:44] notice Jesus response. Jesus said unto
[1:00:48] him, "If thou canst believe, all things
[1:00:52] are possible to him that believeth." I
[1:00:57] believe that still holds true
[1:00:59] tonight. All things are possible to him
[1:01:03] that believeth.
[1:01:05] Now, Mark the 11th chapter beginning at
[1:01:08] verse
[1:01:17] 22. And Jesus answering saith unto them,
[1:01:21] have faith in God. Now, Brother Brandham
[1:01:25] would show us that in the original Greek
[1:01:28] there it says, "Have the faith of God."
[1:01:32] And so let's just just read that again.
[1:01:36] Jesus answering saith unto them, have
[1:01:40] the faith of God. For verily I say unto
[1:01:44] you, that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:01:47] mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
[1:01:50] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[1:01:53] in his heart, but shall believe that
[1:01:56] those things which he saith shall come
[1:01:58] to pass. He shall have whatsoever he
[1:02:02] saith. Therefore I say unto you, what
[1:02:06] thingsoever ye desire when you pray,
[1:02:10] believe that you receive them, and you
[1:02:13] shall have them. So brother, so Jesus is
[1:02:18] putting it back upon the believer.
[1:02:22] whatsoever things you desire what you
[1:02:25] pray or when you pray believe that you
[1:02:29] receive them and you shall have them. So
[1:02:33] may God add his blessings to the reading
[1:02:35] of the word you can be seated and I
[1:02:39] would just like to take uh for a uh text
[1:02:43] challenged by the message of the hour.
[1:02:46] uh challenged by the message of the
[1:02:48] hour. Uh, brother Brandham would preach
[1:02:52] uh sermons like a man running from the
[1:02:56] presence of the Lord and he would deal
[1:03:00] all through the sermon on
[1:03:02] responsibility and how that uh uh a man
[1:03:07] is has a responsibility to uh a husband
[1:03:12] has a responsibility to his family uh to
[1:03:15] provide to make a living to uh provide a
[1:03:19] home. He would talk about uh a a couple
[1:03:23] has a responsibility when they get
[1:03:26] children. Uh they have children. They
[1:03:28] have a responsibility to raise uh their
[1:03:32] children in the fear of the Lord. They
[1:03:35] have a responsibility to bring
[1:03:36] correction. Uh have a responsibility.
[1:03:40] Then we find that there is a
[1:03:42] responsibility to uh as preachers to
[1:03:46] stand for the word to preach the word
[1:03:49] and what brother Brandham is showing us
[1:03:52] that there is a in in life there is a
[1:03:57] responsibility and he would show us that
[1:03:59] a lot of times it's just hum human
[1:04:02] nature to actually try to sherk our
[1:04:07] responsibility but he would show that we
[1:04:09] have a he has a he was showing that he
[1:04:12] had a responsibility
[1:04:14] uh a message that God had given him a
[1:04:18] message to bring to the church and he
[1:04:21] couldn't sherk his
[1:04:23] responsibility and he was also showing
[1:04:26] that we have a
[1:04:28] responsibility to the word uh to stand
[1:04:31] for the word to believe the word and so
[1:04:35] has called us to be
[1:04:38] believers Uh we know that faith comes by
[1:04:42] the word. Uh faith comes by hearing
[1:04:44] hearing the word of God. And it doesn't
[1:04:47] come uh by the seminary. It doesn't come
[1:04:51] by a creed. It doesn't come by a certain
[1:04:54] church that you belong to, but it comes
[1:04:57] by the revealed word. And we find that
[1:05:02] all things are possible to them that
[1:05:06] believe. All things are possible with
[1:05:08] God and all things are possible with the
[1:05:12] believer. And we would find that uh many
[1:05:16] times there would be maybe someone that
[1:05:19] was blind, uh someone that was deaf or
[1:05:22] dumb, someone uh that uh with leprosy,
[1:05:28] regardless of the condition, they would
[1:05:31] come to Jesus and ask for healing or
[1:05:34] deliverance. And Jesus simply said, "If
[1:05:37] thou can't believe." And so that is the
[1:05:42] response to every situation is if thou
[1:05:47] can't believe. And there is an
[1:05:49] importance of why we have a
[1:05:52] responsibility to the word and to stand
[1:05:56] for the vindicated revelation of this
[1:05:59] hour is because it is the answer to
[1:06:02] every situation, every condition, every
[1:06:05] problem. It is a question. We can hear
[1:06:09] the word of God speak back. I can if
[1:06:13] thou canst believe. There's nothing
[1:06:16] wrong with God. There's nothing wrong
[1:06:18] with his power. There's nothing wrong uh
[1:06:22] he he his power has not been diminished
[1:06:25] in this age. Actually, God has proven
[1:06:29] that he is still omnipotent and that he
[1:06:32] is unchanging. Unchanging in his
[1:06:34] character, unchanging in his ways, in
[1:06:37] his nature. It's just simply we can hear
[1:06:41] the question ring back. I can if thou
[1:06:45] can't believe. And so we find that when
[1:06:49] we're preaching the
[1:06:51] promises, we we're not we're not trying
[1:06:54] to put the pressure or uh h preach the
[1:06:59] promises of God and and preaching it
[1:07:02] like there's a pressure that we've got
[1:07:04] to perform something. We've got to make
[1:07:07] something happen. We've got to make
[1:07:10] something work something up. uh when
[1:07:13] we're preaching the promises of God, uh
[1:07:16] it's it's not to put a pressure upon the
[1:07:19] individual. It's not to put like a a
[1:07:22] force like we're trying to make
[1:07:24] something happen. Uh but you see, the
[1:07:28] preaching of the promises is grace. It's
[1:07:32] not something that we can you can make
[1:07:35] happen. It is just simply the grace of
[1:07:39] God that is that is being given to the
[1:07:42] church that all things are possible to
[1:07:45] them that believe and and we are riding
[1:07:49] on the promises of God. I think of how
[1:07:52] that uh our prophet would bring up Paul
[1:07:56] Rider and how that Paul uh Paul Rder, a
[1:08:01] very well-known evangelist back in the
[1:08:05] uh 40s and 50s there and and how that uh
[1:08:09] how that Paul had got sick and and he
[1:08:13] just couldn't get over this sickness and
[1:08:16] how that you know he he just it looked
[1:08:20] like he was going to die and he fell
[1:08:23] into a dream and how that uh Paul Ryder
[1:08:27] as a living he he was a logger and his
[1:08:30] boss told him to go cut down this
[1:08:33] certain a lo a tree with a certain size
[1:08:37] and and so he went out and he cut this
[1:08:40] tree down and it was a big log a big
[1:08:43] tree and and he he he put his knees down
[1:08:47] and got a hold of that log and he began
[1:08:50] to try to move it. And as no, regardless
[1:08:54] of how much he strained and tried to to
[1:08:59] make that uh wrestled with it and
[1:09:02] wrestled and he wrestled and he and he
[1:09:04] tried to move that log and all of the
[1:09:07] strain and all of his efforts, he
[1:09:10] couldn't move that log until he found
[1:09:13] found himself so depleted and and uh
[1:09:17] discouraged and he was so weak. uh
[1:09:20] because he just couldn't move it. But
[1:09:23] then he heard a voice and it was a voice
[1:09:26] of the of his boss and it said just roll
[1:09:30] it down into the river. And and he says
[1:09:34] it was the voice of the Lord Jesus that
[1:09:38] was providing him with the answer. Why
[1:09:42] are you wrestling with it? Why are you
[1:09:44] struggling? Why why are you trying to
[1:09:46] make it happen? Amen. in your own
[1:09:49] ability and your own strength. This is
[1:09:52] beyond your human effort. But there is a
[1:09:55] way. Just roll it over into into the
[1:09:59] water. And then as he got a hold of that
[1:10:02] log and he began to roll it and got into
[1:10:04] the water, then he just jumped on that
[1:10:07] log and he began to ride it down the
[1:10:09] water and he began to yell, "I'm riding
[1:10:12] on it. I'm riding on it. I'm riding on
[1:10:14] it." He said when he come to he was in
[1:10:17] the middle of the floor and he was
[1:10:19] declaring I'm riding on the promises of
[1:10:23] God and from that moment he was
[1:10:25] completely healed. You see we can
[1:10:28] struggle. It's not what you struggle
[1:10:31] with. It's not what you try to manifest
[1:10:34] in your own human abilities. We've seen
[1:10:37] those times. We we've went through those
[1:10:40] ages where people have seen the promises
[1:10:43] of God. The church has wrestled with the
[1:10:46] promises of God. They seen what was
[1:10:49] lost. Amen. In Genesis, they they seen
[1:10:53] what was lost on the day of Pentecost.
[1:10:56] And they've wrestled with it and tried
[1:10:58] to manifest these things. But we have
[1:11:00] come back to an age, amen, where it's
[1:11:03] not resting upon human abilities. It's
[1:11:06] not manifesting. It's not resting upon
[1:11:09] our even our own intellects. But the
[1:11:13] very mind of Christ has come into the
[1:11:15] church of the living God. And it's not
[1:11:18] what we can make happen. It's simply
[1:11:21] what we can surrender to. Amen. The
[1:11:24] prophet of God would let us know it's
[1:11:26] not me, the seventh church age
[1:11:29] messenger, the seventh angel that
[1:11:31] manifests these things as perfectly as
[1:11:33] they are. It's only what I surrender
[1:11:37] myself to. And I tell you the secret to
[1:11:40] the success of the bride church in this
[1:11:43] last day is it's what we surrender
[1:11:47] ourselves to. It's not by our works. It
[1:11:51] is by the grace of God that we can
[1:11:54] believe that God has revealed his power
[1:11:58] in this hour. And it's just simply
[1:12:01] submitting ourselves to the power of
[1:12:05] omnipotence.
[1:12:07] I tell you, uh, brothers and sisters,
[1:12:09] the prophet of God and God's provided
[1:12:12] way for this day, he would say,
[1:12:14] "Brother, sister, Jesus Christ promised
[1:12:18] these things to happen in the last days.
[1:12:21] I believe that we are living here. I
[1:12:23] believe that he is the same yesterday,
[1:12:26] today, and forever. I don't know how
[1:12:29] it's happened, but I'm riding on it. I
[1:12:32] believe that is the truth because it's
[1:12:34] the gospel. God's provided way. I
[1:12:38] believe it is the message of the hour,
[1:12:40] the time that we're living in. It's
[1:12:43] God's provided way. I'm riding on it.
[1:12:48] Amen. Can I go ahead and just say that
[1:12:50] we are riding on this promise all the
[1:12:53] way to the body change? We're riding on
[1:12:56] this promise. The greatest healing that
[1:12:58] ever is going to take place is the
[1:13:00] change of these atoms. Everything that
[1:13:03] has been promised for this day, amen,
[1:13:06] has been revealed to us through the
[1:13:09] message of the hour. It is the rapture
[1:13:13] secret. And we are riding on this
[1:13:16] vindicated message all the way to the
[1:13:21] translation. I tell you, we're living in
[1:13:23] a time where again, the prophet would
[1:13:26] say this message of God's word is the
[1:13:31] truth. Live or die, I'm riding on it.
[1:13:35] I'm not fussing with it. I'm not trying
[1:13:37] to fuss about it. I just took it and I'm
[1:13:41] riding on it. Let the critics rise. I'll
[1:13:44] shoot every riffle. I'm coming into camp
[1:13:47] one of these days riding on the word of
[1:13:49] God. I'm certain to arrive there. Well,
[1:13:53] I tell you, that's my testimony. Amen.
[1:13:55] I'm sure to arrive there because I'm
[1:13:59] riding on it. Amen. We've got a lot of
[1:14:02] mistakes. We We've got a lot of things.
[1:14:06] And we can look at our own humanity and
[1:14:08] see our failings. And And many times we
[1:14:12] see our faults and and we think, "How
[1:14:14] are we ever going to get there?" I'll
[1:14:16] tell you how we're going to get there.
[1:14:17] It's because we're riding on the
[1:14:20] promises of God. Amen. We're riding on a
[1:14:23] message of rapture. Amen. We're riding
[1:14:26] on on a word that has been revealed in
[1:14:29] this day to give rapturing grace to the
[1:14:32] church, to the living God. And it's not
[1:14:34] what we can manifest. It's simply what
[1:14:38] we are surrendering ourselves to.
[1:14:42] I tell you, it's the greatest thing
[1:14:44] there is to be able to listen to the
[1:14:47] message of the hour and not have to
[1:14:49] worry about making it happen, not having
[1:14:52] to worry about trying to think our way
[1:14:55] through it. Uh, but we can listen to the
[1:14:58] message and have confidence that all I
[1:15:00] have to do is believe it. All I have to
[1:15:03] do, not try to figure it out, but just
[1:15:05] simply say, "Be it unto me, Lord. I'm
[1:15:08] here to manifest it. I'm here as a
[1:15:11] believer in this last day. I tell you, I
[1:15:15] think of how that when Jesus walked the
[1:15:18] earth and and how that they had the
[1:15:21] waters of shalom and how that a certain
[1:15:24] season would come and the angel of the
[1:15:27] Lord would move upon the waters. Y'all
[1:15:29] remember that story? how that how that
[1:15:32] God in his mercy would have a way of
[1:15:36] healing, a provided way. And and there
[1:15:38] was a certain season that the angel of
[1:15:41] the Lord would begin to trouble the
[1:15:43] waters. And how they knew that the
[1:15:46] waters were troubled and the and it was
[1:15:49] it was when the current would turn
[1:15:52] backwards. The current was going one
[1:15:55] way, but when the angel of the Lord be
[1:15:57] to come upon the waters, the current
[1:16:00] would re would be reversed. And they
[1:16:02] knew that if they could get into the
[1:16:05] water, they would be made whole. And I
[1:16:08] tell you, when Jesus be to walk and and
[1:16:12] all the sudden, you know, Jesus was
[1:16:15] spiritled and he did nothing except the
[1:16:18] father. He first showed it and he seen
[1:16:20] the father do it first and and here come
[1:16:22] Jesus with his disciples and begin to
[1:16:25] just, you know, wade through the crowd,
[1:16:28] thousands of people there uh there
[1:16:31] waiting for the troubling of the water.
[1:16:34] And the first one that got in was going
[1:16:36] to be made whole. And so they were under
[1:16:39] expectation and and and anticipating and
[1:16:42] always looking and waiting for that one
[1:16:45] moment in that season where the waters
[1:16:49] were troubled. They were under
[1:16:50] expectation to get their healing. Amen.
[1:16:53] Whatever they had need of. And so they
[1:16:56] were looking for it and and focusing
[1:16:58] upon it. And here come Jesus going
[1:17:01] through the crowds of people. And he
[1:17:04] come to one man and said, "Would you be
[1:17:06] made whole?" And he said, "Well, I don't
[1:17:10] have a man that could put me into the
[1:17:12] water." And anytime that I try in
[1:17:15] myself, Amen. anytime in my own human
[1:17:19] ability, I'm just too slow. I I'm too
[1:17:22] weak. I I just I just I just don't have
[1:17:25] enough effort to be able to get into
[1:17:27] that water. But Jesus said, but he Oh,
[1:17:31] the season was changing. Now catch the
[1:17:34] changing of the season. The changing the
[1:17:38] changing of the dispensation that the
[1:17:41] angel was no longer on that water, but
[1:17:45] the angel is now tabernacling human
[1:17:48] flesh. The angel was not on that water.
[1:17:52] The see the changing of expectation to
[1:17:56] look there was now saying hey look
[1:18:00] here I tell you it's the same thing that
[1:18:02] has happened in this age we have seen
[1:18:05] many revivals many visitations God
[1:18:08] moving in great supernatural ways amen
[1:18:11] but it always led to another man another
[1:18:15] another denomination just another creed
[1:18:18] but this revival is a word revival evil.
[1:18:22] It didn't lead us to a man. It didn't
[1:18:24] lead us to a personality. It led us to
[1:18:27] the same Lord Jesus. The same angel of
[1:18:30] the covenant made flesh declaring that
[1:18:33] the word is here. The word knows your
[1:18:36] condition. The word knows what you're
[1:18:38] going through. The word knows the desire
[1:18:41] of your heart. I tell you friends. Amen.
[1:18:45] As he be to say, you know, there's not a
[1:18:48] man that can put me in the water. I tell
[1:18:51] you, let let me just say it like this.
[1:18:53] Amen. If we were talking, we would say
[1:18:55] it like this. In all the other ages,
[1:18:59] there wasn't a son of man that could put
[1:19:01] us in the water. Amen. But you see,
[1:19:04] we've been waiting for this day. But in
[1:19:08] the day when the son of man was
[1:19:10] revealed, there is a man come from
[1:19:12] heaven that can take us from creed and
[1:19:15] dogman, church traditions, and put us
[1:19:18] into the water. the power of the Holy
[1:19:21] Ghost that can make this word live. Uh I
[1:19:24] tell you that's the water that we have
[1:19:26] been put into. It's a water that has
[1:19:29] been troubled by the supernatural
[1:19:31] presence of all almighty God himself
[1:19:35] letting us know that our healing is
[1:19:38] here. Our deliverance is here. Our
[1:19:40] victory is here. There's joy unspeakable
[1:19:43] and full of glory because in the day
[1:19:46] that the son of man is revealed from
[1:19:49] heaven. There's a man that can put us
[1:19:52] into the Holy Ghost to make this word
[1:19:55] manifest in our
[1:19:57] lives. What a day. What a day to be
[1:20:00] living in. I tell you. Amen. The the
[1:20:04] Bible says he wasn't going to die. He
[1:20:07] had had that condition for 37 years.
[1:20:11] It wasn't a It wasn't a condition that
[1:20:14] was going to kill him. But notice what
[1:20:17] Jesus said. S said, "Take up your bed
[1:20:21] and live." I tell you friends, he had
[1:20:24] been in that condition and and it wasn't
[1:20:27] going to kill him, but he still wasn't
[1:20:29] living. I tell you how many times,
[1:20:31] friends, we're just coming to church.
[1:20:34] We're just going through the the rituals
[1:20:37] of church and and trying in our own
[1:20:40] efforts to make it happen and and just
[1:20:42] and just going along in our own human
[1:20:45] efforts and and it just isn't good
[1:20:48] enough. But I tell you friends, hear the
[1:20:51] voice of the word in this hour. Rise and
[1:20:55] live. Uh I tell you friends, uh don't
[1:20:58] just be don't just be a church member.
[1:21:01] Don't just don't don't don't just be
[1:21:04] going through life and saying, "Well, I
[1:21:07] believe the message and I I I go to
[1:21:10] church and I believe God sent a
[1:21:12] prophet." But there's more to life than
[1:21:14] that. We can be made whole, body,
[1:21:18] spirit, and soul. And we can be made
[1:21:20] whole in such a supernatural visitation
[1:21:24] of the power of the Holy Ghost that we
[1:21:26] can live live in the supernatural. live
[1:21:29] in the joy of the Lord. Uh live in the
[1:21:32] presence of almighty God. Uh our homes
[1:21:34] can be saturated with the presence of
[1:21:36] God. Uh our hearts can be saturated with
[1:21:40] revival, joy, unspeakable and full of
[1:21:43] glory. I tell you, I don't want to just
[1:21:46] say I believe that that God sent a pro.
[1:21:48] I want to live uh I want to live in
[1:21:51] heavenly places. I want to thrive in the
[1:21:54] joy of the Lord. I want to live in the
[1:21:56] promises of God. Not by my own efforts,
[1:21:59] but by the power of his
[1:22:02] visitation. Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] Yes, sir. That's why the prophet said,
[1:22:07] "We didn't come just to talk about the
[1:22:10] message, but we come to get in the
[1:22:13] message." And the message is Christ. He
[1:22:17] is the word. Hallelujah. We're to get
[1:22:20] into it and get beneath it. the message.
[1:22:24] Get into it and get beneath it. In other
[1:22:27] words, let it be headship over your
[1:22:31] life. Yes, sir. You see, the prophet
[1:22:34] would say it like this. He says a
[1:22:38] minister, one of his congregation, he
[1:22:40] said he could walk a log. He said,
[1:22:43] "Pastor, sure the Lord is with you."
[1:22:46] He's he's he's going to walk this log
[1:22:49] that's on the ground. He said, ' Do you
[1:22:51] believe that I can walk this log? He
[1:22:53] said, 'Oh, sure, pastor. God is with
[1:22:56] you. Oh my. He said, 'I I can pack a log
[1:23:00] across my my back when I go across.
[1:23:05] Sure, the Lord is with you. And he went
[1:23:08] and done it. He said, I can pack a log
[1:23:11] and will a wheelbarrow across at the
[1:23:14] same time. Sure, pastor, the Lord is
[1:23:17] with you. Your faith can do
[1:23:21] anything. How many times have we been in
[1:23:23] that kind of a condition? Oh, sure,
[1:23:25] pastor. Oh, God's with you. Oh, you you
[1:23:30] can do anything. We believe in your
[1:23:33] faith. Your faith can do anything.
[1:23:36] That's way we've looked at even the
[1:23:37] message. Oh, sure, brother Brandham. Oh,
[1:23:40] God was with brother Brandham. Oh, yes,
[1:23:42] sir. Your faith can do anything. Your
[1:23:45] faith can raise the dead. Your faith can
[1:23:48] can cause tumors to dissolve from
[1:23:51] bodies. Amen. There's certain ministries
[1:23:53] that we've got great confidence in. Oh,
[1:23:55] if I could just get into there, you
[1:23:57] know, into that camp or go to that
[1:23:59] certain revival or if I could have that
[1:24:02] certain minister lay hands on me. Oh,
[1:24:04] his faith can do it. But you see, the
[1:24:06] prophet of God says it like this. He
[1:24:09] said, I can put you in the wheelbarrow
[1:24:12] and pack the log. He said, "Now wait a
[1:24:16] minute. It's different when you're
[1:24:19] included in it
[1:24:20] yourself. Oh my. It's different when
[1:24:24] you're included in it yourself. Says it
[1:24:28] it's mighty good for us to say uh it's
[1:24:31] mighty good for us to say here. Amen.
[1:24:34] It's mighty good for us to say I believe
[1:24:37] that's true. But then put it in action.
[1:24:41] You got to put it in action. In other
[1:24:44] words, amen. The let me just put it like
[1:24:47] this way. The first two pulls was
[1:24:50] healing and the and the and visions
[1:24:53] prophecy. But the third pull was the
[1:24:56] opening of the word. Amen. The first two
[1:24:59] pulls. Amen. It didn't put you in the
[1:25:01] vision. But the third pull, the opening
[1:25:04] of the word put you a part of the
[1:25:07] vision. And now you're Amen. You're in
[1:25:11] the wheelbarrow. Amen. Now you've got
[1:25:14] something to do and that is it's off of
[1:25:17] the preacher. It's off of the prophet
[1:25:20] and it's on your shoulders. A
[1:25:23] responsibility to the word to receive it
[1:25:27] as your Lord, as your headship, as your
[1:25:31] answer, as your all in all, and say,
[1:25:34] "I'm riding on this promise. I believe
[1:25:37] it. I believe it's going to save my sons
[1:25:40] and my daughters. It's going to take us
[1:25:42] into the rapture. It's the answer that
[1:25:45] I've been longing
[1:25:47] for. You see, it's different when you're
[1:25:50] included in it yourself. Now I I believe
[1:25:55] that now the opening of the seals put
[1:25:59] you in the vision because Jesus said at
[1:26:03] that day you shall know that I am in the
[1:26:07] father and the father in me and I in you
[1:26:10] and you in me. And the prophet of God
[1:26:12] would say when it's revealed this day
[1:26:16] when the revelation is made known you're
[1:26:19] going to know that you're one with God.
[1:26:23] Hallelujah. So we see here now, amen,
[1:26:26] that now we've got a part to play. You
[1:26:30] see, the prophet would say it like this,
[1:26:32] life is in the grain again. Now the
[1:26:35] prophet would show us that there's four
[1:26:37] stages. He would show us that we've got
[1:26:40] he's talking about, you know, the the
[1:26:42] the wheat and he would say that you you
[1:26:44] know, first you've got the stock that
[1:26:46] comes up and and he says that was
[1:26:49] Luther. He says, "And then you've got a
[1:26:51] tassel come out of that." He said, "Now
[1:26:53] that was Wesley." He said, "Then you've
[1:26:55] got the shock." He said, "Now that was
[1:26:57] the Pentecostal age." He said, "But the
[1:27:00] grain is back to the word made flesh."
[1:27:04] Well, praise the name of the Lord. The
[1:27:08] same word, the same seed that went into
[1:27:12] the ground. The same Jesus that went
[1:27:14] into the ground has now come back again
[1:27:18] in the bride. In the bride
[1:27:21] form. Well, you see the prophet would
[1:27:23] say life is in the grain again. What is
[1:27:28] it? Just exactly like the same grain
[1:27:31] that went in the ground. The same Jesus
[1:27:34] in the bride form. the
[1:27:49] same up into a head for the rapture. My
[1:27:54] isn't that tremendous? Amen. Everything
[1:27:57] throughout the church ages has come to
[1:28:00] this point in the history of time where
[1:28:03] it is the same Jesus now in bride form
[1:28:07] and it's all gathering everything up
[1:28:10] into the head Christ Jesus for the
[1:28:14] rapture. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:17] You see then we've got a part to play.
[1:28:20] What's the what what's the bride
[1:28:23] minister? What's your wife minister? The
[1:28:26] prophet of God says that what your
[1:28:28] little queen ministers to you at home is
[1:28:30] she prepares food for you. She ministers
[1:28:33] food. Uh our our sister Blanca has been
[1:28:37] providing us some good food and
[1:28:39] preparing the food. And but you see
[1:28:41] that's her ministry. Amen. That's her
[1:28:45] position. She's she's found her place.
[1:28:48] She's found her position. And she's
[1:28:50] preparing that food that we can all
[1:28:53] gather around and feast on that good
[1:28:56] food. And the prophet of God says that's
[1:28:59] that's what the bride ministers to
[1:29:02] Christ. The word man shall not live by
[1:29:06] bread alone, but every word. She
[1:29:09] ministers the word to the king,
[1:29:13] manifesting his promised word in the age
[1:29:17] that she's living in. I don't know if
[1:29:20] you ever thought of that before, but as
[1:29:22] you believe the word and you are
[1:29:25] becoming the written epistles,
[1:29:28] manifesting the word, you are
[1:29:31] ministering the bread of life to God
[1:29:34] Almighty. My, isn't that what a
[1:29:37] ministry? not to just come to church,
[1:29:40] not to just just uh uh read quotes and
[1:29:44] go home, but we have been called to
[1:29:48] manifest the
[1:29:50] word. Hallelujah. And how do we manifest
[1:29:54] the word? By receiving the promise
[1:29:58] concerning
[1:30:01] us. You see, God can only work through
[1:30:05] believers.
[1:30:07] Ain't that right? He can't work any
[1:30:10] other way. He's got to have
[1:30:13] believers. Now, some
[1:30:16] people, you know, the mentality of of
[1:30:20] not not trying to speak negative toward
[1:30:23] anyone, but so many times they're trying
[1:30:26] to work themselves up to faith. But the
[1:30:29] prophet of God showed us that's not how
[1:30:31] faith comes because faith is given by
[1:30:34] grace.
[1:30:36] And so the prophet says that God must
[1:30:40] have believers for every
[1:30:43] age. You see the word in every age
[1:30:48] challenges the
[1:30:50] believer. The word comes contrary to the
[1:30:55] rituals, traditions,
[1:30:58] interpretations, contrary to the creed,
[1:31:01] contrary to the dogmas, to the
[1:31:04] denominational thinking. It's totally
[1:31:08] contrary to the carnal mind. But the
[1:31:12] message comes to challenge the believer.
[1:31:16] If thou can't believe it. In every age,
[1:31:20] they're trying to get something from
[1:31:21] God. In every age, they're trying to
[1:31:24] work themselves into God. But the
[1:31:27] message comes to the elect of the age
[1:31:30] and doesn't require works, but requires
[1:31:34] faith.
[1:31:36] Praise the name of the Lord. So he that
[1:31:40] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:31:43] spirit says to the
[1:31:46] church. Now he that hath an ear. So that
[1:31:49] means that there are those predestinated
[1:31:52] hearing.
[1:31:53] Now, Brother Brandham would say in
[1:31:55] proving his word, in order to have
[1:31:58] believers to meet that word, he's got to
[1:32:02] predestinate it to that age. You see it?
[1:32:07] He's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:32:09] be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:32:12] age. Now, I like how brother Brandham
[1:32:15] says this. He says, "Did it get you? Did
[1:32:19] you feel it? Did you see it? Do you
[1:32:22] understand it? That's what's happening
[1:32:24] today. He predestinated it to this by
[1:32:28] his fornowledge. When he predestinated
[1:32:31] in Malachi 4, it's got to happen. When
[1:32:35] he come over and predestinates anything
[1:32:38] to happen in this word, he had to prove
[1:32:41] his word to be so. When he predestinates
[1:32:44] anything to happen and says it will
[1:32:46] happen. He knows that seed will be there
[1:32:50] just at that time. He predestinated a
[1:32:53] bride. She's going to be there. Going to
[1:32:56] be a rapture. She's going to be there.
[1:32:59] He
[1:33:00] predestinated predestinates it by his
[1:33:02] fornowledge. There's nothing going to
[1:33:05] stop it.
[1:33:07] So God predestinated you to be believers
[1:33:12] to accept the challenge of the message
[1:33:15] for this
[1:33:16] day. Not debating, not arguing, but
[1:33:20] surrendering to
[1:33:23] it. You see, we are
[1:33:26] only the physical
[1:33:30] manifestation of the attributes of God.
[1:33:34] In other words, the prophet would say it
[1:33:36] like this. Any son is the attributes of
[1:33:39] his
[1:33:41] father. Just as you were in the genes of
[1:33:43] your father, in the body of your father
[1:33:45] when you was a young boy, you were in
[1:33:47] him. Yet he could not have fellowship
[1:33:49] with you because you didn't know because
[1:33:52] he didn't know you. But then through the
[1:33:54] bedding grounds of a mother, you were
[1:33:56] brought forth into the earth and become
[1:33:57] in the image of your father. Then he
[1:33:59] could have fellowship with you. And so
[1:34:02] were you sons of God and daughters of
[1:34:06] God before there was even a moon, stars,
[1:34:09] or a molecule. You were sons and
[1:34:12] daughters of God. For you are only the
[1:34:15] physical manifestation of the attributes
[1:34:18] that was in God at the beginning. For
[1:34:21] there's only one form of eternal life,
[1:34:23] and that was you before. You don't know
[1:34:27] nothing about it. You don't remember it.
[1:34:31] You don't know anything about it. But
[1:34:33] God sent us a prophet in this hour and
[1:34:37] says in order to have eternal life, you
[1:34:39] had to be
[1:34:41] there. Before there was a moon, before
[1:34:44] there was an Adam, before there was a
[1:34:46] world, you were a part of the eternal
[1:34:49] gene of God. And now you have been
[1:34:52] expressed to have fellowship with
[1:34:55] God. How are we having fellowship with
[1:34:58] God? by believing his word, by saying
[1:35:01] amen to every word, covered by the blood
[1:35:05] of God. No sins, no condemnation,
[1:35:09] nothing to hold us captive any longer.
[1:35:12] We've been set free by the power of
[1:35:15] Calvary by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:19] Redeemed back to fellowship with God,
[1:35:22] saying, "Lord, I'm your son. I'm your
[1:35:26] daughter. I believe your promise.
[1:35:30] You will not leave me here in
[1:35:32] Leosa. You will not leave me to go
[1:35:35] through
[1:35:37] tribulation. And we are having
[1:35:39] fellowship around the mysteries that
[1:35:42] have been revealed in this last days.
[1:35:44] Antichrist has been revealed. The United
[1:35:47] States has been revealed. Russ has been
[1:35:49] revealed. What things are happening in
[1:35:51] this hour has been revealed. But let me
[1:35:54] tell you something. You have been
[1:35:56] revealed who you are. That your name was
[1:35:59] written on the lamb's book of life
[1:36:01] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:36:03] now you have been manifest to fellowship
[1:36:07] around this revealed
[1:36:10] word. Oh, you forgive me. I get so happy
[1:36:15] I want to
[1:36:17] shout. Praise the name of the Lord. to
[1:36:21] be able to see that in this hour
[1:36:24] identification has
[1:36:25] come. Not one of those blasphemous
[1:36:30] names. Not just a Baptist church or
[1:36:33] Presbyterian church or or a Pentecostal
[1:36:36] church. Neither are we just a message
[1:36:39] church. We are bloodbought bornagain
[1:36:42] sons and daughters of the living God.
[1:36:45] And it's the alpha has become the omega.
[1:36:49] The same Jesus that was the alpha has
[1:36:53] become the omega
[1:36:55] bride. The same Jesus, the same power,
[1:36:58] the same authority that Adam lost has
[1:37:01] been restored back to the church of the
[1:37:03] living
[1:37:05] God. You say, "Well, I don't know about
[1:37:07] that. We don't have the bodies yet." But
[1:37:11] we've been given the title deed. And not
[1:37:13] just the title deed, we've been given
[1:37:15] the abstract title deed. And the lean
[1:37:18] has been taken off of our lives. The
[1:37:21] blood of Jesus Christ has annihilated
[1:37:23] sin, annihilated condemnation, had has
[1:37:27] totally destroyed all un unbelief out of
[1:37:29] our lives. All things are possible to
[1:37:33] them that
[1:37:34] believe.
[1:37:36] Hallelujah. Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen. You
[1:37:41] see, brother Brandon would say that in
[1:37:43] the beginning was the word. The word was
[1:37:46] with God and the word was God and the
[1:37:50] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:37:52] Hallelujah. Our kinsman
[1:37:55] redeemer in flesh. The almighty God, the
[1:38:00] mighty conqueror, the God that spoke and
[1:38:03] universes appeared. The sun appeared.
[1:38:06] The stars appeared. The moon appeared.
[1:38:09] This world that we walk on appeared. All
[1:38:12] because of the spoken word. And in the
[1:38:15] beginning was the word. That's God. But
[1:38:18] then the word was made flesh. God
[1:38:22] condescending, made flesh, dwelling
[1:38:24] among us. But in him was
[1:38:28] attributes. Those eternal genes, the
[1:38:31] eternal God made flesh. And the prophet
[1:38:34] of God says the word was made flesh.
[1:38:37] Therefore, you walked with them. Did you
[1:38:39] ever think of that, young people? You
[1:38:42] walked with him. When God made flesh in
[1:38:46] Jesus Christ, you walked with him. Just
[1:38:50] like, how did you get here? Because you
[1:38:52] were a part of your daddy's life.
[1:38:56] Hallelujah. It's because you started as
[1:38:59] just a little baby and then now you're
[1:39:01] growing and you've come to an age where
[1:39:03] you can realize, you can say your name
[1:39:06] and know who you are, know who your mom
[1:39:08] and daddy is. You've been manifested.
[1:39:11] You're having fellowship. was the same
[1:39:14] way that in the Lord Jesus we were
[1:39:18] there.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah. And the prophet would say it
[1:39:22] so
[1:39:23] beautifully. You walked with him when he
[1:39:27] was on earth. When you were in him, when
[1:39:30] he was on earth, you suffered with him
[1:39:33] and you died with him. You was buried
[1:39:36] with him. And now you are risen with
[1:39:39] him. and manifested attributes of God
[1:39:42] setting in heavenly places already
[1:39:45] raised resurrected to new life and
[1:39:48] setting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:39:50] Jesus. Oh, that means so much nowadays
[1:39:53] church. That means so much to see to us
[1:39:56] to see oursel positionally placed in
[1:39:59] Jesus Christ. Now, if we are those
[1:40:02] attributes of God, we cannot live by
[1:40:04] creeds. We cannot live by
[1:40:06] denominationalism.
[1:40:07] We must live by the word because the
[1:40:11] bride is a part of the bridegroom like
[1:40:14] any wife is a part of her husband.
[1:40:16] Therefore, we must be that word bride.
[1:40:19] And what is that word bride? The
[1:40:22] manifestation of this hour. The bride,
[1:40:25] not a creed or a denomination, but a
[1:40:28] living oracle of God. a living attribute
[1:40:31] of God displaying to the world the
[1:40:33] attributes of God and the formation of
[1:40:35] the bride that's to be expressed in this
[1:40:38] hour that we're now living. Aren't you
[1:40:41] glad that God sent a prophet to identify
[1:40:45] what that word bride is the
[1:40:47] manifestation of this hour? The word
[1:40:51] made manifest. So we can read it like
[1:40:54] this. In the beginning was the word. The
[1:40:57] word was with God. The word was God. The
[1:41:00] word was made flesh. And I was in him
[1:41:04] then. And when he died, I died. When he
[1:41:07] rose, I rose. And now I am the physical
[1:41:12] manifestation of his victory. What he
[1:41:15] paid for. I am the victory. What he
[1:41:19] redeemed, I am the redeemed. And now I
[1:41:23] am bearing fruits of that redemption.
[1:41:27] Praise the name of the Lord. So what has
[1:41:30] God done? He's called us out to believe
[1:41:33] the
[1:41:33] promise. Just as Abraham was called by
[1:41:38] election to believe the
[1:41:40] promise and then he was tested upon that
[1:41:43] promise. Notice in his humanity in his
[1:41:48] in the the physical body was getting
[1:41:51] weaker and weaker and weaker. But God
[1:41:55] just kept confirming the promise through
[1:41:58] the whole time. The human element in his
[1:42:02] in his body, he just saw weakness,
[1:42:05] frailty. There's no way that I can
[1:42:08] fulfill the promise. And and yet when
[1:42:12] his when his life story was wrote, Paul
[1:42:16] wrote his life story, it says that
[1:42:18] Abraham never staggered at the promise
[1:42:20] of God. Yet we find that Abraham
[1:42:23] actually disbelieved at times. But here
[1:42:27] God is not looking at his works. He's
[1:42:29] looking at his
[1:42:31] faith. So God sent a prophet over here
[1:42:35] and says Abraham was justified not by
[1:42:37] his works. He's justified by his faith.
[1:42:40] And Abraham never staggered at the
[1:42:43] promise of
[1:42:45] God. But he grew stronger in faith,
[1:42:48] testifying of the promise, refusing to
[1:42:51] look at the deadness of his body,
[1:42:53] refusing to look at the deadness of
[1:42:55] Sarah's body. He was calling those
[1:42:57] things that be not as though they
[1:43:00] already
[1:43:01] were. For faith is the substance of
[1:43:06] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[1:43:09] not yet
[1:43:11] seen. So Abraham was holding to that
[1:43:14] promise. That's what he was called for.
[1:43:16] He was chosen. He was called out of
[1:43:19] idolatry. He was called out of paganism.
[1:43:22] He was called out of his old his his
[1:43:25] home and his kindred and and all of
[1:43:27] those things to live a separated
[1:43:30] consecrated life to the promise. So,
[1:43:33] have we been called to be separate even
[1:43:36] though we're still living in this habit
[1:43:39] habitation of decay? Even though we
[1:43:42] still have our five senses of our sight
[1:43:45] and our hearing and our feeling and and
[1:43:48] our five senses of our spirit which is
[1:43:51] imagination, conscience, reasoning,
[1:43:54] affection and our emotions. But you see,
[1:43:57] we have been called to separate from
[1:44:00] those things and walk by the six sense
[1:44:03] which is the Holy
[1:44:06] Ghost,
[1:44:07] faith, a supernatural walk with God,
[1:44:12] that when our side says it can't happen,
[1:44:15] when our reasoning says it can't happen,
[1:44:18] when our emotions are up one day and
[1:44:20] down the next day and up the next day
[1:44:23] and down the next. But we are called to
[1:44:26] be
[1:44:27] separate. Separate from our human sense,
[1:44:31] separate from our imagination, separate
[1:44:34] from our conscience, and walk with God.
[1:44:41] Hallelujah. While we're yet in this this
[1:44:46] habitation, we're always going to h our
[1:44:48] sense of sight is always going to be
[1:44:50] with us. our sense of
[1:44:51] hearing. We're going to be able to hear
[1:44:54] negativity. We're going to be able to
[1:44:56] have senses that that are that are
[1:44:59] always trying to control us by
[1:45:03] negativity. The world is trying to
[1:45:05] always make us
[1:45:06] victims, victims of circumstance,
[1:45:10] victims of this, victims of this. But I
[1:45:12] just want to say what a prophet said. We
[1:45:15] are his
[1:45:17] victory. We are not victims. We are
[1:45:21] overcomers. We are not victims of Leosa.
[1:45:24] We are overcomers of
[1:45:27] Leosa. We are not hotbed plants that
[1:45:30] can't take pressure. We have been
[1:45:33] pressurized into the astronaut age by
[1:45:35] the power of the Holy Ghost. We are
[1:45:38] sitting in heavenly places in
[1:45:41] Christ walking by the six sense.
[1:45:48] Oh, now we're challenged by the message
[1:45:51] of this
[1:45:52] hour. We're challenged to refuse to
[1:45:55] believe what we
[1:45:57] see. To refuse to believe the doctor's
[1:46:00] report. When the doctor says you've got
[1:46:03] cancer, you're going to
[1:46:04] die. We're challenged. Cast down the
[1:46:08] doctor's report and believe the true
[1:46:10] report. By his stripes, you are
[1:46:14] healed. Hallelujah.
[1:46:16] When the devil trips you up and then
[1:46:20] tells you you're worthless, tells you
[1:46:22] you'll never make it and then you
[1:46:24] finally get strengthened up to get back
[1:46:26] on your feet and then he comes and
[1:46:28] knocks you back down and then he
[1:46:29] whispers in your ear and says, "You're a
[1:46:31] loser." I tell you what you need to do.
[1:46:35] You get back on your feet and say,
[1:46:36] "Satan, you don't have enough. You don't
[1:46:39] have enough to destroy me. You're the
[1:46:42] loser. I'm a conquering
[1:46:46] king.
[1:46:48] Hallelujah. Get back on your feet, young
[1:46:51] people. When the devil tries to bruise
[1:46:53] you up and trip you up and defile you
[1:46:55] and say that you're not going to make
[1:46:57] the rapture, I challenge you. Stand on
[1:47:00] your feet. Put your shoulders back and
[1:47:02] say, "Satan, I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:47:04] daughter of God. I'm going to make the
[1:47:07] rapture because it's who I am. I've got
[1:47:10] the rapture in me. I've got the
[1:47:12] quickening power already within
[1:47:17] me.
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] Hallelujah. Stagger not. Abraham stagger
[1:47:24] not. He understood that God was faithful
[1:47:28] to the promise. It challenged him for
[1:47:33] 24 years. He was challenged.
[1:47:37] But each time he grew weaker, he was
[1:47:40] getting closer to the visitation with
[1:47:43] Elohim. I tell you
[1:47:45] friends, we have been longing for this
[1:47:47] day.
[1:47:49] I don't want to get into it deep right
[1:47:51] now, but I just want to say we've been
[1:47:53] waiting for this visitation,
[1:47:55] Elohim, to come and discern the thoughts
[1:47:58] and intents of our heart and to declare
[1:48:00] who we
[1:48:02] are and to change our bodies. Oh, praise
[1:48:08] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. the
[1:48:11] prophet of God tying it together,
[1:48:14] Abraham and Abraham's seed. Says he
[1:48:17] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:48:18] through unbelief, but with strong giving
[1:48:21] praise to God, knowing that he was able
[1:48:24] to perform what he had promised. And
[1:48:27] that's the way everyone must be that
[1:48:30] way. You must come with an unfailing
[1:48:33] faith, believing that God made the
[1:48:36] promise. But you have to be in a
[1:48:40] position to have that faith. And that's
[1:48:42] what we're going to talk on to receive
[1:48:46] that faith. Now, you see, Brother
[1:48:48] Brandham is preaching perfect faith.
[1:48:52] He's putting the people in position to
[1:48:55] have perfect faith. Now, what is perfect
[1:48:58] faith? Perfect faith is just simply
[1:49:01] saying, "God, you said it. I believe it.
[1:49:05] That settles it.
[1:49:07] Regardless of what your sense of sight
[1:49:10] says, regardless of what your feeling
[1:49:13] says, regardless of imagination,
[1:49:16] conscience, reasoning, affection, all of
[1:49:20] those things will lie to
[1:49:23] you. They are a part of the fall and
[1:49:26] they will lie to you because they are
[1:49:28] contacting this natural earth. But you
[1:49:32] see the six sense is a part of that of
[1:49:35] that new birth. The six sense is the new
[1:49:38] birth that puts you into the astronaut
[1:49:41] age to bring you into the heavenly
[1:49:45] places. And when your conscience is
[1:49:47] trying to bring you back down, but the
[1:49:50] six sense says, "Lord, I
[1:49:53] believe. I believe. I believe your word.
[1:49:58] You are faithful that promised. You see,
[1:50:01] the prophet of God is taking a Holy
[1:50:04] Ghost church and putting us in position
[1:50:07] to just simply believe the word. You
[1:50:12] see, the prophet of God would say it
[1:50:14] like this. He says there's the Jew
[1:50:17] faith. He says the Jew faith is come lay
[1:50:20] your hands on my daughter. You see, we
[1:50:23] believe in laying hands on the sick. How
[1:50:25] many believes in laying hands on the
[1:50:26] sick? It's just as scriptural today as
[1:50:28] it always has been. But brother Brandham
[1:50:31] is showing us there's different faiths.
[1:50:34] He says there's a Jew faith that Gyrus
[1:50:36] says, "If you can lay your hands on my
[1:50:38] daughter, she will be made whole." He
[1:50:41] says, "Then there's the Gentile faith
[1:50:43] which just simply says, speak the word.
[1:50:46] If I'm a man of authority, if you speak
[1:50:49] the word, my servant will be made
[1:50:51] whole." Amen. But then there is a God
[1:50:56] faith, a Jew faith, a Gentile faith, but
[1:51:00] God's own faith says you speak the word.
[1:51:04] Hallelujah. It's when God, it's not just
[1:51:08] saying, God, if you'll come, oh God, if
[1:51:11] you'll just speak the word, but now God
[1:51:14] has spoke the word. And the word is now
[1:51:18] in your mouth. And he's saying you speak
[1:51:21] the word. You're in the message. Now the
[1:51:25] third Paul has put you in the vision.
[1:51:28] Now you
[1:51:30] speak. John, the word has been open. But
[1:51:33] John, Revelations 10. Now the seventh
[1:51:36] angel has taken the book. He's opened
[1:51:38] the seals. But now John, a type of the
[1:51:41] bride, is commissioned to go to the
[1:51:43] angel, take the book, eat the book, and
[1:51:47] prophesy again.
[1:51:50] Not prophesying or adding to the
[1:51:53] message, but taking the vindicated word
[1:51:57] and speaking it again. Prophesy over
[1:52:01] your family. Speak over your situations.
[1:52:05] Speak over your health. Speak your way
[1:52:07] into a body change. What did the prophet
[1:52:10] of God say? He's the high priest of our
[1:52:13] confession. What is confession? to say
[1:52:16] the same thing as. So, we're not adding
[1:52:20] to the word. We're not taking away from
[1:52:22] the word. We're taking the word and just
[1:52:26] saying what it says. Abraham would say,
[1:52:29] "I'm going to have a son." Where did he
[1:52:31] get that revelation? God said it. And he
[1:52:34] kept speaking it. I'm going to have a
[1:52:36] son. I'm going to have a son. I'm going
[1:52:39] to manifest that promise. He kept
[1:52:41] getting older. He kept getting weaker,
[1:52:43] more frail, but he kept quoting the
[1:52:46] scripture. Quoting the promise. He was
[1:52:48] writing on that
[1:52:49] promise. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:52:52] What's the What's Abraham's royal seed
[1:52:55] doing? Keep quoting the promise.
[1:52:58] Speaking the promise. Speaking that
[1:53:00] promise. I'm riding on this promise.
[1:53:03] It's going to take me in my body.
[1:53:04] Change. It's going to bring It's going
[1:53:07] to It's going to bring I Let me just say
[1:53:09] like this. It's going to bring those
[1:53:11] lost loved ones home.
[1:53:14] Hallelujah. Well, how can I say that?
[1:53:17] How can you say that? Because there's a
[1:53:20] promise. The same faith that saved you
[1:53:23] is the same faith that can take that
[1:53:25] token and apply it over your
[1:53:27] family. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:53:32] see, we're riding on the
[1:53:35] promise. God's own faith.
[1:53:38] You speak the word. What do you have
[1:53:41] need of? Well, Brother Brandham was
[1:53:45] hunting and he needed some squirrels.
[1:53:47] But we don't need
[1:53:49] squirrels. But I tell you what we can
[1:53:51] create. We can create an
[1:53:54] atmosphere. And do you realize that we
[1:53:56] can create an atmosphere of possibility?
[1:54:01] We can create an atmosphere that all
[1:54:03] things are possible and begin to take
[1:54:05] that promise and say, "Lord, I believe
[1:54:07] it. Be it unto me according to thy
[1:54:10] word." Amen. You see, that's the reason
[1:54:13] the prophet of God would say that he's
[1:54:16] given us his word. He He gave us the
[1:54:20] best thing that he could ever give us,
[1:54:22] and that is his word.
[1:54:25] Satan is always trying to come up with a
[1:54:27] better tactic, a better weapon, always
[1:54:30] trying to get us to reason. But you see,
[1:54:33] God gave us the best thing and that was
[1:54:36] his word. So he only makes his word more
[1:54:39] positive, more real. And so in the last
[1:54:44] days, amen, in the revealing, Luke
[1:54:47] 17:30, when the son of man is revealed
[1:54:51] or when the word is made flesh, when the
[1:54:54] word becomes reality. Amen. Everything
[1:54:58] that that Luther But Luther moved on
[1:55:01] into Wesley and Wesley moved on into the
[1:55:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but then it
[1:55:06] moved on into the reality of the word.
[1:55:10] the very thing that we have been
[1:55:13] needing, the word. Amen. But you see,
[1:55:17] the prophet of God would show us in
[1:55:20] perfect faith. He would say that that he
[1:55:23] says that you've got to recognize your
[1:55:26] position just as Jesus recognized who he
[1:55:30] was. Therefore, he had faith because he
[1:55:35] knew who he was. faith could produce
[1:55:39] when he knowed what he was. Now, if you
[1:55:43] abide in me and my word in you, then you
[1:55:48] know who you are. Ask what you will,
[1:55:52] it'll be given to you. Let me just back
[1:55:54] up again because again, the prophet of
[1:55:57] God is showing us. He says, "You have to
[1:56:00] be in a position to have that faith."
[1:56:03] And that's what we're going to talk on
[1:56:06] to receive that faith. Amen. And the
[1:56:10] prophet would say, "You've got to know
[1:56:14] who you
[1:56:15] are." He's putting us in position to
[1:56:19] believe for all things. Are you with me?
[1:56:23] Still putting us in position to take God
[1:56:28] at his word. Amen. So Jesus understood
[1:56:33] who he was. He was not trying to become
[1:56:37] the son of God. He was the son of God.
[1:56:42] And he was looking to the prophecy and
[1:56:46] saying this day this scripture is
[1:56:50] fulfilled. He understood Moses
[1:56:54] prophesied of him. Isaiah prophesied of
[1:56:57] him. Hallelujah. the types and the
[1:57:00] shadows was prophesying of him. And he
[1:57:04] knew he was made manifest to fulfill the
[1:57:09] words. He was the physical manifestation
[1:57:14] of the prophet's prophecy. Then if this
[1:57:17] bride knows who she is, that she is not
[1:57:21] the type, but she is the physical
[1:57:24] manifestation of Enoch's type. She is
[1:57:27] the physical manifestation of Rahab's
[1:57:30] type. She is the physical manifestation
[1:57:33] of Sarah's type. Every type, every
[1:57:37] shadow, this bride is the manifestation
[1:57:41] of what God has been laying in the word
[1:57:44] for thousands of
[1:57:47] years. Then you can stand up and say, "I
[1:57:51] am the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm not
[1:57:54] trying to become the word. I am the
[1:57:58] word. When you can see your place in the
[1:58:03] scripture and you understand your
[1:58:05] position in the word in Christ, there is
[1:58:10] nothing can defeat
[1:58:12] you. There is nothing can hold you back.
[1:58:16] There's not enough devils in hell can
[1:58:18] discourage you. There's not enough
[1:58:20] devils in hell that can anoint your
[1:58:22] senses to talk you out of the rapture.
[1:58:25] You are predestinated to meet the
[1:58:28] challenge of the message of the hour. I
[1:58:32] believe the word and I see myself a part
[1:58:36] of Malachiah 4. I see myself a part of
[1:58:41] of Joel
[1:58:43] 2:28, the church being restored back to
[1:58:46] the original faith. I see myself being
[1:58:50] restored back to what Adam
[1:58:53] lost.
[1:58:55] Hallelujah. Every message, every
[1:58:57] scripture, every type is written of you
[1:59:00] and
[1:59:03] me. Is this
[1:59:06] okay? Every
[1:59:09] type. You're not a type of Enoch.
[1:59:12] Enoch's your type.
[1:59:17] Rahab behind those Jericho
[1:59:20] denominational
[1:59:21] walls. You're not a type of her. She was
[1:59:24] your
[1:59:25] type. Sarah doubting the promise,
[1:59:28] wondering how she's going to fulfill
[1:59:30] manifest the promised son and God would
[1:59:33] have killed her, but she was a part of
[1:59:37] Abraham. You're not a type of Sarah.
[1:59:39] Sarah was your
[1:59:42] type. And how many times have we thought
[1:59:46] in our humanity, I can't fulfill the
[1:59:48] promise. I can't make it. I can't make
[1:59:51] it another day. I don't know if I can
[1:59:53] hold on. Let me tell you something. Quit
[1:59:55] trying to hold on. Let go and let
[2:00:00] God. You don't have enough keeping
[2:00:03] power. You don't have enough holding
[2:00:05] power. It's by grace we are saved. And
[2:00:08] that by faith
[2:00:11] alone, praise the name of the
[2:00:13] Lord, God would have killed her. God
[2:00:16] would have killed us. But we're a part
[2:00:18] of
[2:00:19] Christ and we are not
[2:00:23] replaceable. God will never have a new
[2:00:26] thought of
[2:00:27] you. God will never have a new thought.
[2:00:31] No one can ever replace you. So God by
[2:00:34] his fornowledge, by his thinking, saw
[2:00:38] you. Therefore, he could predestinate
[2:00:41] you, knowing that you would come in the
[2:00:43] most wicked, deceiving ages, but you
[2:00:47] would stand the test and you would stand
[2:00:50] there and say, "God, I believe. God, I
[2:00:54] believe." Oh, praise the name of the
[2:00:55] Lord. when everything's against you,
[2:00:57] when all hell is against you, but you're
[2:01:01] standing there believing the word,
[2:01:03] saying amen to the word, making love to
[2:01:05] your God, making love to your
[2:01:09] bridegroom. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:01:11] You see, Christ, and now I'm I'm about
[2:01:14] to close. Amen. Christ was our
[2:01:19] example. No other example. Christ is our
[2:01:22] example. We sing the song to be like
[2:01:25] Jesus. On earth I long to be like him.
[2:01:29] You see, Christ is our
[2:01:31] example. And and he thought it not
[2:01:35] robbery to be equal with God. And Paul
[2:01:39] said, "Let this same mind that was in
[2:01:43] Christ, who understood his position and
[2:01:46] understood who he
[2:01:48] was, let that same mind be in you.
[2:01:53] And Paul said, "Cast down
[2:01:55] reasonings. Cast down
[2:01:58] imagination. Cast down anything that
[2:02:01] exalts itself above the
[2:02:04] revelation." Hallelujah. Can't you see
[2:02:07] the grace that God has given us in this
[2:02:09] hour to bring us this
[2:02:11] revelation that the alpha bridegroom has
[2:02:14] become the omega, the bride of Jesus
[2:02:16] Christ? That it's we're not a secondary.
[2:02:20] We're we're we're not a byproduct, but
[2:02:23] we've been restored back to his
[2:02:26] side.
[2:02:27] Hallelujah. Remember the
[2:02:30] masterpiece. Remember Michelangelo
[2:02:32] struck the image. It become such a
[2:02:35] reality. What he saw in his mind become
[2:02:37] such a reality. And he struck the knee
[2:02:39] and said,
[2:02:41] "Speak." And left a little chip and he
[2:02:43] couldn't he couldn't put it back
[2:02:45] together.
[2:02:46] But God, his great
[2:02:49] masterpiece, the word made flesh and he
[2:02:53] struck Christ on Calvary. But then he
[2:02:56] took that little chip and he made a
[2:02:57] masterpiece called the bride of Jesus
[2:02:59] Christ. And what Michelangelo could not
[2:03:01] do in his humanity, God by his
[2:03:04] supernatural took the bride and put it
[2:03:06] back into the sight of Jesus
[2:03:08] Christ. We're bone of his bone. We're
[2:03:11] flesh of his flesh. We're spirit of his
[2:03:13] spirit. We're life of his life.
[2:03:17] When you see me, you see
[2:03:19] God, the word made flesh in bride form
[2:03:23] again. And as the bridegroom understood
[2:03:26] his position, so the bride understands
[2:03:29] her
[2:03:31] position. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:03:33] We're not trying to become the word. We
[2:03:35] are the word by being
[2:03:37] predestinated in Christ before the
[2:03:40] foundation of the
[2:03:42] world. That's why Ephesians is a book of
[2:03:44] adoption. And Paul says, "You were
[2:03:47] chosen in him before the foundation of
[2:03:50] the world."
[2:03:52] Hallelujah. And the word has come to
[2:03:54] bring a recognition and identification
[2:03:57] of who we are in
[2:04:00] him. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:04] Oh, all hell is against this revelation
[2:04:06] of Christ in you.
[2:04:08] Oh, hell is trying to talk us out of
[2:04:10] this revelation of Christ, the hope of
[2:04:14] glory in
[2:04:17] you. You forgive me. I get be I I just
[2:04:20] get carried away. I the things that
[2:04:23] brother Brandham says, it just starts
[2:04:25] pouring in. Brother Brandham says, "Dees
[2:04:27] not in heaven. Deities in
[2:04:30] you." Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:34] Amen. Then recognize your position in
[2:04:37] the scripture as a believer. You've got
[2:04:40] to recognize your position as he
[2:04:43] recognized his position. What are you a
[2:04:47] believer?
[2:04:49] Oh, how many times I've stood in prayer
[2:04:52] lines and and and Satan causing people
[2:04:55] to doubt and and make them think that
[2:04:58] they're not believers and trying to
[2:05:00] trying to make them think they're not,
[2:05:03] you know, they're not performing this
[2:05:04] and they're not doing this and and and
[2:05:08] because they get nervous and tense and
[2:05:12] trying to work something up and feel
[2:05:14] like they don't have enough. Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] And the devil makes people so nervous,
[2:05:19] but then you just bring it to that one
[2:05:21] simple question. Do you
[2:05:24] believe? And then the hands go up, the
[2:05:27] tears begin to fall, and the chains are
[2:05:31] broke. Yes, I
[2:05:34] believe. And that's all God is asking.
[2:05:37] Do you
[2:05:39] believe? I'm riding on this promise. The
[2:05:44] waters are troubled. I'm stepping into
[2:05:47] the power of the dynamics of the Holy
[2:05:51] Ghost.
[2:05:53] Hallelujah. It's not whether I It's not
[2:05:56] whether I held on. It's whether he held
[2:05:58] on for
[2:06:00] me. And when they nailed those hands to
[2:06:03] Calvary to make sure, I was in him then.
[2:06:08] And when he held on and he cried, "It is
[2:06:11] finished forever." was
[2:06:14] settled past and
[2:06:18] future. All sins were
[2:06:21] annihilated because every germ of
[2:06:24] eternal life was in
[2:06:27] him. Glory to
[2:06:30] God. And I see my position.
[2:06:34] I see myself not just as a justified
[2:06:36] bride, sanctified bride, a baptized
[2:06:39] bride with the Holy Ghost, but I see a
[2:06:42] were bride possessially placed with all
[2:06:47] authority and dominion. Everything that
[2:06:50] Adam lost has been restored back to us
[2:06:52] in this last
[2:06:54] day. Everything that we've been longing
[2:06:56] for has been restored back to us.
[2:07:00] Hallelujah. That's why Jesus said, "If
[2:07:02] you destroy this
[2:07:05] body, this temple, I'll raise it up
[2:07:08] again in three
[2:07:10] days." Hallelujah. He was just as
[2:07:13] satisfied he'd do
[2:07:15] that because the scripture said he would
[2:07:18] do it. I'll not leave his soul in hell,
[2:07:21] neither will I suffer my holy one to see
[2:07:23] corruption. A prophet who the word comes
[2:07:26] to had said that would happen. And he
[2:07:29] knowed he was that
[2:07:33] person. You see, he understood the
[2:07:37] scripture concerning
[2:07:39] himself. Therefore, upon that one
[2:07:43] promise, he went to
[2:07:45] Calvary, knowing that he would raise
[2:07:50] again. One
[2:07:52] promise. Can I say it like this? He rode
[2:07:55] that promise all the way to the whipping
[2:07:58] post. All the way c dragging that
[2:08:01] cross. Blood soaking his garment so weak
[2:08:05] that he collapsed. Someone else had to
[2:08:06] drag his cross. But upon that one
[2:08:09] promise, he was riding it all the way up
[2:08:12] to Calvar's heel. And as he was there
[2:08:16] nailed to that cross, he had you in his
[2:08:19] mind. He knew that you were going to be
[2:08:21] made manifest. He knew that he would
[2:08:24] have a seven church age bride without
[2:08:26] spot, without wrinkle, without blemish.
[2:08:28] And in the last days, he would have a
[2:08:30] bride that would believe it all. And
[2:08:32] there would be such a perfect
[2:08:34] understanding of scripture of who we are
[2:08:37] that he would raise Paul from the dead.
[2:08:39] It would raise Peter from the dead. It
[2:08:41] would raise Iranius and Columba and all
[2:08:44] of those down. It would raise William
[2:08:45] Brandham from the
[2:08:47] dead. He knew it. He knew what he was
[2:08:51] doing.
[2:08:52] And he said, "Destroy this body, but
[2:08:55] I'll raise it up
[2:08:57] again." And he said, "Destroy this
[2:09:00] bride. Let her be fed lions. Let her be
[2:09:03] fed, you know, killed, burnt, and
[2:09:06] everything else. But I'll raise her up
[2:09:12] again. I see the promise. I see my name
[2:09:17] written all over Malachi 45 and 6.
[2:09:20] I see my name written all over Luke. Uh
[2:09:23] Luke 17:30, Revelations 5, Revelations
[2:09:26] 10. I see my name all over S. John
[2:09:29] 14:12. The works that I do shall you do
[2:09:32] also, for I go unto my father. I see my
[2:09:35] name written all over the word. And I
[2:09:38] tell you friends, this bride sees her
[2:09:41] position in the scripture that we have
[2:09:43] come not just to be a church member, but
[2:09:46] to be the word made manifest.
[2:09:49] and we're riding on
[2:09:51] it. This rapture can't go without me
[2:09:54] because he's coming for a bride without
[2:09:56] spot, without wrinkle. And that's who I
[2:09:59] am. Riding on it. This is the revival.
[2:10:04] Oh, the revival of the hour,
[2:10:07] predestinated unto the
[2:10:10] rapture. Hallelujah. Then we can see
[2:10:13] ourselves in St. John 5:24. He that
[2:10:16] heareth my word and believeth on him
[2:10:17] that sent me hath everlasting life, and
[2:10:20] I will raise him up again at the last
[2:10:21] days. That's me. I will raise him up,
[2:10:25] the individual. That's me. I put my name
[2:10:28] right
[2:10:29] there. I've already passed from death
[2:10:31] unto life. Can't go into judgment
[2:10:34] because I've already the slave belts
[2:10:37] been taken off. I've been covered by the
[2:10:39] bleach of the blood. Praise the name of
[2:10:42] the Lord. And here is the word right
[2:10:44] there saying, "Just believe it. Just
[2:10:47] believe it. I predestinated you to
[2:10:49] believe it." And we say,
[2:10:52] "Amen. That's who I am. That's who I am.
[2:10:56] I believe. I praise the name of the
[2:10:59] Lord." You see, the prophet of God would
[2:11:01] say like this, "If I taught you a
[2:11:03] Methodist message, it would take no
[2:11:05] effect on you. This is bright time. If I
[2:11:09] brought you just another Pentecostal age
[2:11:11] message, it would take no effect on you.
[2:11:15] This is bride
[2:11:16] time. If if Moses taught the message of
[2:11:19] Noah, it would take no effect. If Jesus
[2:11:21] taught the Moses message, it would take
[2:11:23] no effect because the predestinated seed
[2:11:27] laying in that ground in that time and
[2:11:29] season could only be watered by the word
[2:11:32] for that age. And brothers and sisters,
[2:11:36] he said, "I will pour out the former and
[2:11:39] the latter rain
[2:11:41] together." The message that is falling
[2:11:43] today, former and latter rain mechanics
[2:11:46] and dynamics
[2:11:50] together. The rain that this bride needs
[2:11:53] is found in the vindicated message of
[2:11:56] the hour. It's the water. It's the
[2:11:58] anointing that is falling. And brothers
[2:12:01] and sisters, we're getting built up in
[2:12:04] the faith of this
[2:12:05] hour. Not in the faith of Luther Wesley.
[2:12:09] We're getting in the faith of this hour.
[2:12:12] And the faith of this hour is astronaut
[2:12:15] age. There's a power behind this bride.
[2:12:19] My goodness. It's not one horse. It's
[2:12:22] not just 20 horse. It's not just a
[2:12:25] thousand horsepower, but it's thousands
[2:12:28] upon thousands. It's atomic power. It's
[2:12:31] the
[2:12:31] faith, the quickening power of the Lord
[2:12:35] Jesus. The same spirit that raised
[2:12:37] Christ from the dead. If it comes upon
[2:12:40] you, it'll raise you from the dead and
[2:12:43] it'll lift you into heavenly
[2:12:45] places in astronaut
[2:12:49] age where the limits are taken off.
[2:12:52] Ain't that beautiful? The limits are
[2:12:54] taken off. I don't know if I can believe
[2:12:56] for that. the limits are taken off and
[2:12:59] the message is right there saying
[2:13:00] believe it. Every time you listen to the
[2:13:02] message of the hour, there is not one
[2:13:04] place in this message that is ever
[2:13:06] saying be careful now. Be be careful to
[2:13:10] believe for that now. I don't know if
[2:13:11] you're worthy to believe for that. No,
[2:13:13] the message is saying you're worthy. You
[2:13:16] are now sons and daughters of God. You
[2:13:18] will not become you not will be someday.
[2:13:20] You are now present tense the express
[2:13:23] gene of God. and he's taken the limits
[2:13:26] off of your faith. Believe for it. I
[2:13:30] tell you, just a weekend of
[2:13:32] services, but just just, you know,
[2:13:35] there's something special about when you
[2:13:36] just have some con just just a
[2:13:39] consecrated weekend of
[2:13:41] services where it just there's just a
[2:13:45] little bit extra expectation maybe. And
[2:13:49] I tell you what, in this time, in this
[2:13:51] season, in this I I in this weekend, why
[2:13:55] don't you just determine in your heart,
[2:13:57] I'm going to take the limits off? Let me
[2:14:00] let me just say it like this. Maybe
[2:14:02] you've had a besetting sin that you've
[2:14:04] struggled
[2:14:05] with and you couldn't get over
[2:14:07] it. Why don't we take the limits off of
[2:14:10] God and allow omnipotence to come and
[2:14:13] break that thing once and for all? You
[2:14:16] see, God's a cycle
[2:14:19] breaker. He wants you to He's He's come
[2:14:22] in this hour to break
[2:14:23] cycles. He's come just to break
[2:14:27] traditions. Not just It's by traditions
[2:14:30] we make the word of God of none effect.
[2:14:32] But come and just allow God to just
[2:14:34] break through. Break break break through
[2:14:37] all the traditions, all the fears, all
[2:14:40] the whatifs.
[2:14:42] I I how many times we want to step out
[2:14:45] in faith and say, "I believe that God
[2:14:47] can fill me with the Holy Ghost." Even
[2:14:50] step out and say, "I believe God's
[2:14:51] filled me with the Holy Ghost." And the
[2:14:54] devil's right there saying, "But what
[2:14:55] if? What if?" So many times we we think,
[2:15:00] you know, well, I can't do that. I can't
[2:15:03] do that. No, I can't do that. Do you
[2:15:06] realize, brother Bradom says that the
[2:15:08] Holy Ghost came to rid us of the I
[2:15:15] can'tss? He wants you to say I
[2:15:17] can. I can. I
[2:15:22] can't. Not. You see, it's an age of
[2:15:26] understanding. And God wants you wants
[2:15:29] to see wants you to take the word not by
[2:15:33] an intellectual revival but a real word
[2:15:35] revival the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:39] opening the word to your hearts and
[2:15:41] being able to say that's
[2:15:45] me. As our as our musicians come you you
[2:15:49] you remember how brother
[2:15:52] Brandham took us through the little the
[2:15:54] little story of how that there was a
[2:15:56] little boy and
[2:15:58] They live way
[2:15:59] out way out in the
[2:16:03] heels. They were poor people. And so
[2:16:06] they didn't have much much money, much
[2:16:09] materialistic
[2:16:12] things. And they only had just a little
[2:16:14] bitty little bitty mirror, you know,
[2:16:16] that daddy shaved or they combed their
[2:16:18] hair or something of that nature. That
[2:16:20] little boy had never seen himself in a
[2:16:22] mirror before. Y'all remember that
[2:16:24] story?
[2:16:27] and how that one time they went and went
[2:16:30] into the city and they were going to see
[2:16:32] I believe
[2:16:33] grandma they going to the city and my
[2:16:37] this little boy is walking through this
[2:16:39] through this big house and he's looking
[2:16:42] through this door and that door and my
[2:16:45] he's just you know intrigued and
[2:16:47] interested and and and all of these
[2:16:49] different things and then he comes to a
[2:16:51] door and this door had been closed
[2:16:54] before but now it's
[2:16:57] and he seen a mirror that he had never
[2:16:59] seen before, but he didn't at the time
[2:17:01] know that it was a mirror, but he
[2:17:03] actually seen another little
[2:17:05] boy. He began
[2:17:07] to, you know, he's he thought it was
[2:17:09] another playmate or something. So, he's
[2:17:10] getting close to this little boy. He
[2:17:12] says when he took a step, the other
[2:17:14] little boy took a step. When he moved
[2:17:16] his hand, the other little boy moved his
[2:17:18] hand.
[2:17:20] He said, "Mama and grandma looked and
[2:17:24] they seen what was happening. They said,
[2:17:26] you know, let's just see what's going to
[2:17:28] happen." Finally, it came to a place
[2:17:31] that that little boy stood there face to
[2:17:34] face with
[2:17:36] himself and understanding struck and he
[2:17:39] turned around and said, "Well, mama,
[2:17:42] that's
[2:17:44] me." Do you realize that God has opened
[2:17:47] this word
[2:17:49] And it's like a
[2:17:51] mirror. And the closer we get to
[2:17:54] it, the closer we come under it, submit
[2:17:57] to it, we can say one
[2:18:00] thing. That's
[2:18:02] me. That's me. Every type, every shadow,
[2:18:07] everything that was written of the groom
[2:18:09] is written of the
[2:18:12] bride. Mama, that's me.
[2:18:16] You know, if you listen to the prayer
[2:18:19] lines, there's people who come dumb or
[2:18:22] deaf and they couldn't speak, couldn't
[2:18:25] hear,
[2:18:26] right? And after they were healed,
[2:18:28] Brother Brandham would say, "Now repeat
[2:18:30] after
[2:18:32] me."
[2:18:34] Mom, and you can actually hear it. They
[2:18:36] go,
[2:18:39] "Mom." They had never heard it before.
[2:18:43] But there is a
[2:18:45] prophet that after they've been healed
[2:18:49] and their hearing is open now, their
[2:18:52] tongue has been loose to speak and now a
[2:18:54] prophet is putting a word in their mouth
[2:18:57] and saying, "Repeat after me."
[2:19:00] Mama, do you realize that our
[2:19:05] hearing was subject to denominational
[2:19:08] interpretation? All these things, but
[2:19:10] God by his grace opened our
[2:19:15] understanding. And the first thing we
[2:19:17] have heard was a prophet saying, repeat
[2:19:20] after
[2:19:21] me, I am a son of
[2:19:25] God. I am a daughter of God. I am the
[2:19:30] word bride of the word
[2:19:32] groom. I am
[2:19:35] him. Where did we get that kind of a
[2:19:38] talk? Well, a prophet is a divine
[2:19:41] interpreter of the word. And he begin to
[2:19:43] take all the scriptures and begin to
[2:19:46] challenge our faith and say, "Say what I
[2:19:50] say. Don't add to it. Don't take away
[2:19:53] from it." But God has given us a word to
[2:19:57] overcome by in this age. Do you believe
[2:20:00] that? All things are possible to them
[2:20:03] that
[2:20:04] believe. You know, maybe we can just
[2:20:08] sing that song again. I need thee,
[2:20:16] Lord. I need you,
[2:20:20] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[2:20:25] right now.
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:30] Oh, I need you,
[2:20:33] Lord. I need you,
[2:20:36] Lord, right now.
[2:20:40] Would you want to just lift your hands
[2:20:43] and just sing? I lift my hands. I bow my
[2:20:49] knee to
[2:20:51] worship at your
[2:20:57] throne. I need
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:01] you. I need you, Lord, right now.
[2:21:07] Whatever you have need of, just lay it
[2:21:09] over on that promise word. I need you,
[2:21:13] Lord.
[2:21:16] Lord, you promised to be my healer.
[2:21:20] You promised to be my revivor.
[2:21:25] You promised that you would refill me. I
[2:21:28] need you, Lord.
[2:21:30] You promised to restore me.
[2:21:33] [Music]
[2:21:35] Oh, I lift my hands.
[2:21:40] Oh, that's it to
[2:21:43] worship him.
[2:21:47] Why don't you just recognize you're
[2:21:49] before his throne of grace right now?
[2:21:55] The first night of these meetings.
[2:21:58] Just a challenge coming to us. Only
[2:22:01] believe.
[2:22:05] Oh Lord, would you have compassion on
[2:22:08] me?
[2:22:11] Have compassion on my son. The devil's
[2:22:13] trying to destroy him. Have compassion
[2:22:16] on my home. Satan is trying to bring
[2:22:21] discouragement, fear, nervous, tensions.
[2:22:27] Oh, can you have compassion on me?
[2:22:31] Can you hear Jesus speak back?
[2:22:34] Can you
[2:22:36] believe the compassion of Jesus in this
[2:22:41] hour is turning our hearts back to the
[2:22:44] word? Just
[2:22:46] believe. Just
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:50] believe. I need you, Lord.
[2:22:55] I need you,
[2:22:57] Lord, right now.
[2:23:01] I need you,
[2:23:03] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[2:23:08] I need you, Lord. Right
[2:23:13] now, I
[2:23:15] surrender. I lift my
[2:23:18] hands. I bow my
[2:23:21] knee to
[2:23:23] worship
[2:23:25] at your throne.
[2:23:29] I need you,
[2:23:33] Lord. I need you, Lord, right
[2:23:39] now. There's an old
[2:23:41] song that says, "I surrender
[2:23:45] all." Oh,
[2:23:48] I
[2:23:51] surrender all.
[2:23:57] I
[2:23:59] surrender
[2:24:05] all to thee, my
[2:24:10] blessed
[2:24:12] Savior,
[2:24:14] I surrender.
[2:24:18] Sing it again. Oh,
[2:24:22] I surrender.
[2:24:27] Would you just like to expose your heart
[2:24:29] to him? I surrender to you, Lord. Come
[2:24:33] and fill me.
[2:24:36] Aresh
[2:24:38] all to thee, my
[2:24:42] blessed
[2:24:44] Savior,
[2:24:46] I surrender.
[2:24:52] Oh, all to
[2:24:56] Jesus.
[2:24:58] I
[2:25:00] surrender
[2:25:02] all to him.
[2:25:08] My
[2:25:10] I will
[2:25:12] ever
[2:25:14] love and trust
[2:25:18] in his
[2:25:20] precious name.
[2:25:24] Oh,
[2:25:26] I
[2:25:29] surrender to all.
[2:25:34] I
[2:25:36] surrender
[2:25:41] all to thee my
[2:25:46] blessed
[2:25:48] Savior
[2:25:50] I surrender.
[2:25:52] All the next verse all to Jesus.
[2:25:57] All to
[2:26:00] Jesus
[2:26:01] I
[2:26:06] surrender at his feet
[2:26:12] I
[2:26:14] worthy
[2:26:16] pleasure
[2:26:17] all forsake him.
[2:26:21] Take me Jesus. Oh, take
[2:26:27] me. Oh,
[2:26:29] I
[2:26:32] surrender. I surrender
[2:26:35] all. I
[2:26:39] surrender. I surrender all.
[2:26:46] Be my
[2:26:49] blessed
[2:26:51] savior.
[2:26:55] I as they play
[2:26:59] it. You know, I know this is the first
[2:27:02] night of the
[2:27:05] meeting, but maybe you've come with just
[2:27:08] a real special need.
[2:27:12] Maybe you don't you don't have to come
[2:27:14] up if you'd like to. Your pastor and I
[2:27:17] can pray with
[2:27:19] you. But what I want us to do, if you
[2:27:23] would, why don't we just make a a
[2:27:26] rededication to the
[2:27:31] Lord? Such a sweet atmosphere, such a
[2:27:35] sweet
[2:27:36] presence. Why don't you just lay
[2:27:38] everything before his throne of grace?
[2:27:41] Say, "Lord
[2:27:43] Jesus, I need you,
[2:27:46] Lord. My faith has been challenged, but
[2:27:49] I accept the
[2:27:51] challenge. I've been predestinated to
[2:27:53] believe for all
[2:27:55] things." Maybe you're that like that
[2:27:57] eagle. You
[2:27:59] just your eagle visions a little dimmed
[2:28:03] over. Maybe your Maybe your beak is a
[2:28:06] little crusted over.
[2:28:09] Maybe you just need a real renewing, a
[2:28:11] real refreshing of the Holy Ghost. Why
[2:28:14] don't we just take this opportunity
[2:28:16] right now and say, "Lord, refresh
[2:28:18] me." Oh, God sees your heart,
[2:28:21] friends. God sees your heart. He loves
[2:28:24] you. You're his own. He died for you. He
[2:28:28] sent this message just for you. It's his
[2:28:31] love letter that he's revealed to you.
[2:28:34] Heavenly
[2:28:36] Father, we surrender our
[2:28:39] hearts. Lord, we're in divine
[2:28:43] presence and in this atmosphere, all
[2:28:46] things are
[2:28:48] possible. Lord, we're just letting go of
[2:28:51] everything else. And we're letting our
[2:28:53] faith go and we're just touching the
[2:28:54] hymn of your garment as you walk by.
[2:28:59] There's a cry in our hearts saying pass
[2:29:01] me not oh gentle savior hear my humble
[2:29:05] cry while on others thou art calling do
[2:29:09] not pass me by. Oh God come in a
[2:29:13] supernatural
[2:29:15] visitation. Bless your
[2:29:17] children. Father we see that that we are
[2:29:21] the fulfillment of prophecy.
[2:29:25] all of the types and all of the prophets
[2:29:28] prophecy laying out for this
[2:29:31] day. Lord, a bride without spot, without
[2:29:36] wrinkle, delivered and freed to believe
[2:29:38] for all things. That's who we
[2:29:41] are. We've been loosed from the bondage
[2:29:45] of sin, free of
[2:29:48] condemnation. Lord Jesus, bless your
[2:29:51] people.
[2:29:54] move as only you can,
[2:29:56] Father. Lord, just refresh and renew and
[2:30:00] refill. We ask it in the mighty name of
[2:30:03] the Lord Jesus
[2:30:05] Christ. Amen and
[2:30:08] amen. Oh,
[2:30:11] I
[2:30:13] surrender
[2:30:15] all. Yes,
[2:30:17] Lord.
[2:30:18] I
[2:30:21] surrender all.
[2:30:33] I
[2:30:35] surrender
[2:30:38] all. Oh,
[2:30:41] I
[2:30:43] surrender
[2:30:47] all. I surrender.
[2:30:51] Let's stand if we
[2:30:53] would. Oh, all to thee, my
[2:31:00] blessed
[2:31:02] savior,
[2:31:03] I
[2:31:05] surrender all.
[2:31:09] I was reading before service, usually
[2:31:11] before I start a we open up meetings, I
[2:31:14] usually read a scripture and it was in
[2:31:15] Ephesians 2 where he talked about by
[2:31:17] grace through faith are you saved. He
[2:31:19] says, "You've been predestined to good
[2:31:20] works." Amen. He's got a plan for each
[2:31:23] one of us. But I was also thinking
[2:31:26] before service that so often we long for
[2:31:29] revival. But you got to remember what
[2:31:31] the prophet said. He says, "When revival
[2:31:33] rolls through, there's no more in you
[2:31:34] after than there was before. All it does
[2:31:37] is it cleans out what was there in the
[2:31:39] first place." Amen. Sometimes we're
[2:31:41] screaming for revival and what we need
[2:31:42] is the first filling. Amen. We need
[2:31:45] something to revive. Amen. We need that
[2:31:48] initial revival of the baptism of the
[2:31:50] Holy Spirit. Amen. So, I want to sing
[2:31:52] that song, Holy Spirit, rain down. Amen.
[2:31:55] As we just worship for a little bit, you
[2:31:57] stay. Let's just settle. No, nobody's in
[2:32:01] a hurry. Just settle down. Let's just
[2:32:04] worship him. You keep your heart, keep
[2:32:06] your mind settled on him. You keep your
[2:32:07] needs before him. You keep your health
[2:32:10] before him. You keep your family before
[2:32:11] him. You keep your loved ones before
[2:32:13] him, your children before him, your
[2:32:14] family before him. Young people, you
[2:32:16] keep your need for the Holy Spirit
[2:32:18] before you. You say, "Lord, I'm here to
[2:32:19] get it." And if you've got it, say,
[2:32:21] "Lord, I'm here to get it again." A
[2:32:23] refilling, a rebaptism, a
[2:32:25] retouch. Lord, take away I liked what he
[2:32:27] said. We get crusty sometimes, don't we?
[2:32:30] Lord, take away the crustiness, Lord.
[2:32:32] Take away that hard shell. Take away
[2:32:34] that indifference, Lord. Soften my

[2:36:27] breathe. This is the air I
[2:36:33] breathe. Your
[2:36:35] holy
[2:36:39] presence it's
[2:36:42] living in me.
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:50] This is my daily
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:36:56] bread. This is my daily
[2:37:02] bread. Your
[2:37:04] very
[2:37:08] word
[2:37:10] spoken to
[2:37:14] me. And
[2:37:20] I I'm desperate for you.
[2:37:29] And
[2:37:31] [Laughter]
[2:37:34] I I'm lost without
[2:37:39] you. This is the air I breathe.
[2:37:45] This is the air I
[2:37:51] breathe. This is the air I
[2:37:57] breathe. Your
[2:37:59] holy
[2:38:03] presence
[2:38:05] living in me.
[2:38:13] This is my daily
[2:38:19] bread. This is my daily
[2:38:22] [Music]
[2:38:24] bread. Your
[2:38:26] very
[2:38:30] word
[2:38:33] spoken to
[2:38:36] me. And I
[2:38:44] I'm desperate for
[2:38:50] you and
[2:38:56] I I'm desperate without you. I'm
[2:39:00] desperate for
[2:39:03] you and
[2:39:06] [Laughter]
[2:39:09] I I'm desperate for
[2:39:17] you. And
[2:39:20] [Laughter]
[2:39:23] I I'm lost without
[2:39:27] you. Keep playing. keep
[2:39:29] playing. You know, he said, "I loved it.
[2:39:34] I'm not a runner and I'm not a shoutter,
[2:39:36] but I could have run and I could have
[2:39:37] shout when he said, "You're not the
[2:39:39] type. You're the reality."
[2:39:44] You don't point back to
[2:39:46] them. They're pointing to you.
[2:39:50] Let me take it a step further than he
[2:39:52] took it. Our prophet said, "If you can't
[2:39:54] see Jesus Christ in every page of the
[2:39:57] Bible, go back and read it again." What
[2:40:01] does that say about you? If you can't
[2:40:03] see yourself there, go back and read it
[2:40:06] again because they're all pointing to
[2:40:07] you again.
[2:40:10] What were they? Broken vessels, broken
[2:40:14] people, fallen soldiers, fallen
[2:40:18] women,
[2:40:19] hopeless,
[2:40:21] old, worn
[2:40:23] out,
[2:40:25] imperfect. But what do you see by
[2:40:28] faith? By faith. And God looking back
[2:40:32] through the blood could only see not
[2:40:34] Abram, but Abraham. And he could not see
[2:40:37] his mistakes. All he could see was the
[2:40:39] faith that he had the entire time. Not
[2:40:42] the ups and downs, not the ins and outs.
[2:40:45] What was Abraham feasting on? Your very
[2:40:49] word spoken to me. You got to need
[2:40:51] today. You got to find your word spoken
[2:40:54] to you.
[2:40:56] Amen. Not to your spouse, not to mommy,
[2:40:59] not to daddy, not the preacher. You've
[2:41:01] got to find your word spoken to you. And
[2:41:03] you say, "Lord, I'm here for your word.
[2:41:05] Let your word be born in the manger of
[2:41:07] my heart. Not just in my heart, but in
[2:41:09] my life. In my in my very flesh, this
[2:41:12] very body. Lord, let it happen. Amen.
[2:41:14] Let's sing this again. Let's sing it.
[2:41:16] Your very word. I'm living, Lord, by
[2:41:18] your word to
[2:41:21] me. We're not a message bride. We're a
[2:41:24] word
[2:41:26] bride. Okay? This is not a
[2:41:30] denomination. If you're here because of
[2:41:32] that, you need a new birth. But you're
[2:41:35] here because you heard a word spoken to
[2:41:37] you and it quickens something inside of
[2:41:40] you. And that's the life that's trying
[2:41:42] to express itself tonight,
[2:41:45] tomorrow. It's been trying to express
[2:41:47] itself all along. You always were
[2:41:48] children of God, but what's trying to
[2:41:50] happen is the word's trying to manifest
[2:41:52] itself. What's he asking for? Take me at
[2:41:56] my word. Have faith. Fear
[2:42:00] not. Behold, I'm with you, even in you
[2:42:03] to the end of the age. Amen. Let's sing
[2:42:05] it once more. This is the air I breathe.
[2:42:08] Amen. If you've been breathing something
[2:42:10] else, if you've been feeding on
[2:42:11] something else, make a make a decision
[2:42:13] tonight. Say, "Lord, I'm going to
[2:42:15] breathe a different air. I'm going to
[2:42:17] feed on a different word.
[2:42:20] Calling that which is in contrary to the
[2:42:22] word as if it were not, and letting the
[2:42:25] word be our faith this evening." Amen.
[2:42:27] Let's sing
[2:42:28] it. This is the air I breathe.
[2:42:36] This is the air I
[2:42:40] [Music]
[2:42:41] breathe. Your
[2:42:44] holy
[2:42:47] presence, it's
[2:42:51] living in
[2:42:57] me. This is my daily bread.
[2:43:05] This is my daily
[2:43:10] bread. Your
[2:43:12] very
[2:43:16] word
[2:43:19] spoken to me.
[2:43:23] And
[2:43:26] [Laughter]
[2:43:29] I I'm desperate for
[2:43:36] you. And
[2:43:39] [Laughter]
[2:43:42] I I'm lost without
[2:43:47] you. And
[2:43:49] I And I
[2:43:53] [Laughter]
[2:43:57] I'm desperate for
[2:44:03] you and
[2:44:06] [Laughter]
[2:44:08] [Applause]
[2:44:09] I I'm lost without
[2:44:15] you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I have
[2:44:19] a testimony. Brother Matt handed this to
[2:44:21] me. He said, "Brother Dale is doing so
[2:44:23] much better today." He said he is
[2:44:25] feeling better than over a week ago
[2:44:28] before he got sick. He slept better last
[2:44:30] night and feels like being up and at it.
[2:44:33] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:36] You've ever noticed, Brother
[2:44:38] Dale? He He says what the word said. He
[2:44:42] never said, "I've got
[2:44:44] cancer." He never worried. He never
[2:44:47] fretted. He said, "I'm okay with
[2:44:50] whatever, but I believe the Lord will
[2:44:52] heal me." And he's doing it. And he's
[2:44:55] done it. And what does Satan do? He
[2:44:56] raises up something. Satan tries to
[2:44:58] raise up a standard. And what does he
[2:45:00] say? All is well. All is well. Can we
[2:45:03] sing that? All is
[2:45:05] well. You've got to have faith to say
[2:45:07] all is
[2:45:08] well. When you've heard a message that
[2:45:11] says
[2:45:12] peace, don't fear. Don't worry. He's got
[2:45:16] it all in control. Amen. That's our
[2:45:18] message this evening. All is well. Let's
[2:45:21] sing it to
[2:45:23] him. Oh, all is
[2:45:29] well. Oh, all is
[2:45:36] well. We have heard the message
[2:45:43] shalom and all is well.
[2:45:51] There is a
[2:45:54] place of
[2:45:56] perfect rest
[2:45:59] behind the inner
[2:46:03] veil.
[2:46:05] Oh rest little
[2:46:08] bride rest for all is well.
[2:46:17] Oh, all is
[2:46:23] well. All is
[2:46:29] well. For we have heard the message
[2:46:37] shalom and all is
[2:46:41] [Music]
[2:46:43] well. There is a
[2:46:47] place of
[2:46:50] perfect
[2:46:51] rest
[2:46:53] behind the
[2:46:55] inner
[2:46:57] veil.
[2:46:58] So rest little
[2:47:02] bride rest for all is
[2:47:09] well. Amen. We're going to sing that
[2:47:11] song by his word. Amen. And as we close
[2:47:14] in prayer tonight, amen. Remember the
[2:47:17] service tomorrow. Remember brother
[2:47:18] Jonathan, he's got three hard days of
[2:47:20] work here. He's got one done, two to go.
[2:47:22] Pray the Lord will just give him a good
[2:47:24] night's rest and inspire him for the
[2:47:26] other services. And then remember, we've
[2:47:28] got the breakfast tomorrow morning at
[2:47:30] 10:00, I believe, for those that would
[2:47:31] like to come to that. And then service
[2:47:34] tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. Amen. Keep it in
[2:47:36] prayer. Come expecting, come ready, come
[2:47:40] pulling. Amen. And trust the Lord to do
[2:47:42] a wonderful thing. Amen. We've had a
[2:47:44] good start. Let's continue in it by his
[2:47:47] word. Amen. I'm gonna ask brother Chad
[2:47:48] to come and close if we would at the end
[2:47:50] of
[2:47:51] this. By his
[2:47:57] word, oh, I'll
[2:48:01] [Laughter]
[2:48:05] prevail by his word.
[2:48:12] I'll
[2:48:13] never
[2:48:18] fail by his
[2:48:24] word. I'll
[2:48:31] overcome by his
[2:48:34] word. I'll prevail.
[2:48:39] I'll
[2:48:44] overcome. Oh, by his
[2:48:51] word I'll
[2:48:54] [Laughter]
[2:48:57] prevail. By his
[2:49:03] word, I'll
[2:49:05] never fail.
[2:49:11] by his
[2:49:16] word all
[2:49:18] over
[2:49:23] come. Oh, by his
[2:49:27] word I
[2:49:31] prevail
[2:49:35] over. Amen.
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:49:49] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Yes,
[2:49:52] Lord. Amen. Lord, sometimes we live
[2:49:56] lives of quiet
[2:49:59] desperation, not knowing how to really
[2:50:03] truly ask you, Father, for what is
[2:50:05] needed.
[2:50:08] reasoning in the mind

[2:50:34] stand for the real thing Lord. Yes, let
[2:50:37] us not settle for anything but what you

[2:50:50] Lord. Those of us who need help walking
[2:50:53] the line, Lord, I pray you stand right
