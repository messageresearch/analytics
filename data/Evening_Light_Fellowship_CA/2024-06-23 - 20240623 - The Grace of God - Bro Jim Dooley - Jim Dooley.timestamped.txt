[48:59] have known brother Jim for quite a while
[49:01] some of you more than I have but uh you
[49:03] I was sinking this morning we have a
[49:05] what they call in the old times a
[49:07] grizzled veteran here this morning you
[49:09] know you know I'm 44 and I preach things
[49:13] and I preach them by Revelation but not
[49:15] always by experience but when you get
[49:17] someone like brother Jim up here he's
[49:19] preaching it by experience he's had a a
[49:21] long road he's had many trials and he's
[49:24] faced many things and he's come through
[49:25] and he's got a real character about him
[49:28] that no matter where he goes people know
[49:30] he's a man of God and I'll say this and
[49:32] I'm not one to butter people up but you
[49:34] know the way the reason why I trust
[49:35] brother Jim is that he never talks about
[49:37] himself and he never tells you what he's
[49:39] doing for the Lord he just goes and he
[49:41] does it amen he needs all he needs is
[49:43] for the Lord to show him what to do and
[49:45] he goes and and does it and that's the
[49:46] way every believer ought to be you know
[49:48] we don't need to toot our own Hornen we
[49:50] just go do it and if the Lord wants to
[49:52] give us recognition for it he'll do it
[49:54] so we certainly want to Reon welcome him
[49:57] this morning and brother Jim if you've
[49:59] known brother Gerald then you know they
[50:01] can sit a long while so take your time
[50:03] this morning amen and just we're going
[50:05] to settle back and we're going to listen
[50:06] to an experienced veteran this morning

[50:10] thankful to take a bit of a break it's
[50:12] been you know it's it's a it's a long
[50:14] slog every week and it's good to sit
[50:17] back and and have the Lord just use
[50:18] somebody else so let's let's not just

[1:01:34] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:01:37] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[1:01:41] knowledge and to knowledge
[1:01:44] Temperance and to Temperance patience

[1:01:50] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:01:54] brotherly kindness

[1:02:03] neither be baren nor
[1:02:05] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:02:08] Jesus Christ amen but he that lack at
[1:02:12] these things is blind and cannot see a
[1:02:15] far off and had forgotten that he was
[1:02:18] purged from his old
[1:02:20] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:02:23] diligence to make your calling and
[1:02:25] election sure
[1:02:27] for if ye if you do these things ye
[1:02:31] shall never fall for so an entrance
[1:02:34] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:02:37] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:02:40] and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will
[1:02:43] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:02:46] remembrance of these things though you
[1:02:49] know them and be established in the
[1:02:51] present through truth yeah I think it
[1:02:54] meet as long as I I'm in this Tabernacle
[1:02:57] to stir you up by putting you in
[1:03:00] remembrance knowing that shortly I must
[1:03:02] come to I must put off this my
[1:03:05] Tabernacle even as our lord Jesus had
[1:03:08] showed me amen praise God Amen so I was
[1:03:14] saying there before we before I my 76
[1:03:19] year old brain got away on me there for
[1:03:21] a second you know I was saying I was
[1:03:24] going to give back to brother Jonathan
[1:03:27] so I think brother Jonathan he he's full
[1:03:30] of the Holy Ghost and power and also I
[1:03:34] also think he's a well oiled
[1:03:38] oiled uh machine you know preaching
[1:03:42] machine right so you got the well oiled
[1:03:45] machine and now you I'm I'm the old
[1:03:48] rusty one here this
[1:03:50] morning
[1:03:51] so right but that's all right you know
[1:03:55] we all we
[1:03:57] all do what God we just don't want to I
[1:04:01] don't want to do what brother Jonathan
[1:04:03] does or to be brother Jonathan I want to
[1:04:05] be brother Jim right so you know
[1:04:10] whatever the Lord lays on my heart for
[1:04:12] you this morning you know you take that
[1:04:16] into your heart your bosom you know and
[1:04:19] let the word of God reflect that
[1:04:22] light it may only be a sentence
[1:04:26] might be a paragraph that I read from
[1:04:28] one of the message books here you know
[1:04:31] but take that into your heart and
[1:04:34] that'll cause you to grow into that
[1:04:37] stature that we see on the wall there
[1:04:40] you know that'll add a little bit of
[1:04:42] Faith a little bit of virtue a a little
[1:04:45] bit of uh love and so on
[1:04:50] Temperance any of those things that we
[1:04:53] just read there you know so I think I
[1:04:56] think it's
[1:04:57] wonderful that we have the opportunity
[1:05:00] in a day brothers and sisters where we
[1:05:03] have more religion more
[1:05:06] religiosity in the world today than we
[1:05:09] ever have more churches more everybody
[1:05:13] trying to do their thing and to
[1:05:18] uh trying to get souls saved in their
[1:05:22] way you know but we know that outside
[1:05:25] the message of the
[1:05:27] hour there is no
[1:05:29] Redemption for this
[1:05:32] world there is
[1:05:37] none Revelations 18:4 says brother
[1:05:41] brandham quoted this quite a bit you
[1:05:44] know join the church ages and the seals
[1:05:47] and everything else come out of her my
[1:05:49] people be not partakers of her sins that
[1:05:52] you receive not of her plagues you know
[1:05:55] because their plagues have reached on
[1:05:57] into heaven and judgment are going to
[1:05:59] get poured
[1:06:00] out because the blood of the Saints and
[1:06:03] martyrs and pilgrims and
[1:06:06] Christians are all found on her
[1:06:19] doorstep I was thinking about the soul
[1:06:21] of
[1:06:23] man so I I
[1:06:27] um I was into this message a little book
[1:06:30] little
[1:06:33] bit it's Souls that are in present
[1:06:37] now not I'm not going to speak on Souls
[1:06:39] that are in present
[1:06:42] now but I just want to lay a few things
[1:06:48] out brother brandham here in in
[1:06:50] paragraph
[1:06:53] 36 he says
[1:06:58] 35 he says now this Souls now in
[1:07:02] presence Souls that are now in
[1:07:05] present verse 36 now the soul of man is
[1:07:09] not the body of
[1:07:10] man it's the soul see and the soul is
[1:07:17] something that's the nature of the
[1:07:21] spirit and and then when the nature of a
[1:07:25] man
[1:07:26] man when he said we are
[1:07:29] dead the scripture plainly tells us that
[1:07:33] that's comes from Colossians 3 and 3 we
[1:07:36] are dead and our lives are head are HID
[1:07:40] in God through Christ sealed by the Holy
[1:07:44] Spirit sealed by the Holy Spirit and I
[1:07:48] like that sister's song this morning
[1:07:50] because you know when you're sealed
[1:07:53] brother say you're sealed Prophet told
[1:07:56] us you're sealed to you to your
[1:08:00] destination there nothing can temper
[1:08:03] with that
[1:08:05] seal the world is sealed
[1:08:09] out leot is sealed out religion is
[1:08:14] sealed out the word is sealed in and
[1:08:18] it's sealed in
[1:08:20] you amen the word is sealed in you
[1:08:25] now think about
[1:08:28] that the word being sealed in you the
[1:08:31] word being sealed in
[1:08:33] me you
[1:08:35] know Jesus said I come that you might
[1:08:39] have life life and that you might have
[1:08:43] it more
[1:08:45] abundantly Abundant
[1:08:48] Life right and that that song the sister
[1:08:51] sang there I just I just love that song
[1:08:54] at the first time I heard I heard it but
[1:08:57] I love that and and and I see a sister's
[1:09:01] heart and I thank God for that heart
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:19] now he says it wasn't that your body
[1:09:22] died it
[1:09:24] wasn't it wasn't that your body
[1:09:29] died it wasn't that your spirit died it
[1:09:34] was the nature of your
[1:09:37] spirit died see the nature which is the
[1:09:41] soul the nature of your soul is of God
[1:09:46] is God see the nature of your soul is
[1:09:49] God and if you're born again
[1:09:56] if it's if it's not it's off the world
[1:09:59] so the nature of your
[1:10:02] soul is God if you're born
[1:10:05] again if it's not it's off the
[1:10:08] world anything that begins has an end so
[1:10:12] therefore the only way that you can have
[1:10:15] eternal life is to have a life that
[1:10:18] never did
[1:10:20] begin right so we have to we have to
[1:10:23] think about that
[1:10:26] we have to think
[1:10:28] about that
[1:10:30] life that we thought well
[1:10:34] in 2026 it'll be 50 years of for me
[1:10:38] serving the
[1:10:40] lord But A J's I think he's my age
[1:10:44] pretty close 76 right is it sister Betty
[1:10:49] 76 yeah so we're pretty close to the
[1:10:52] same vintage there
[1:10:55] right but he's been I read your little
[1:10:59] thing there 43
[1:11:03] years ministering the
[1:11:10] gospel taking out the
[1:11:13] message delivering
[1:11:15] it having that website up there since 91
[1:11:19] is it 91 somewhere in that
[1:11:23] area right
[1:11:28] but
[1:11:29] God looks at
[1:11:33] that God looks at that you got a big
[1:11:37] church
[1:11:38] here you know and you got a small amount
[1:11:41] of
[1:11:42] people that
[1:11:44] doesn't have any bearing on
[1:11:47] anything
[1:11:50] right we used to have Fellowship in my
[1:11:52] home in the Yukon
[1:11:56] and just a newborn Christian a few years
[1:11:59] old you know and
[1:12:03] uh so our first meetings were was in our
[1:12:07] living
[1:12:08] room so we had
[1:12:10] myself well my wife first cuz she was
[1:12:13] saved before me we had the pastor and
[1:12:16] his wife who who became the pastor after
[1:12:18] his
[1:12:20] wife and then then the pastor's wife was
[1:12:24] my wife wife's
[1:12:26] cousin so those three and yet I was
[1:12:31] unsaved right then I got saved so I
[1:12:36] walked from down the street and I walked
[1:12:38] home I put my beer down I put my pool
[1:12:43] stick
[1:12:45] down and I said to my buddy there that
[1:12:48] was at the at we were at his house in
[1:12:51] the basement plane pool I said that's it
[1:12:53] Barry
[1:12:55] I'm
[1:12:58] done you know Jesus told
[1:13:01] Paul Paul it's hard for you to kick
[1:13:04] against the
[1:13:06] Pricks it's
[1:13:08] hard Paul not only killed Steven he
[1:13:12] killed many
[1:13:13] people there was many Believers that
[1:13:16] Paul gave
[1:13:18] consent out
[1:13:20] there you
[1:13:22] know but there had to be some conviction
[1:13:26] and and
[1:13:28] some uh
[1:13:30] uh something happening with the Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit dealing with Paul at that time
[1:13:38] that was bringing him to
[1:13:40] notice these things you know and
[1:13:43] convicting him you know why he's putting
[1:13:47] these people to
[1:13:49] death why he's doing all that you know
[1:13:53] and and in our house and I was being
[1:13:56] convicted because these people were
[1:13:59] after me to they said you got to get
[1:14:02] saved man you got to get
[1:14:05] saved right my buddy then at the time
[1:14:10] you know he became a
[1:14:12] Christian
[1:14:14] and and I I don't want anything to do
[1:14:17] with that I didn't want anything to do
[1:14:19] with it that's the truth and
[1:14:24] uh but you know the conviction of God
[1:14:29] settled down on me that one
[1:14:32] time that one
[1:14:34] time and and I end up coming home I
[1:14:38] walked into my home Friday
[1:14:41] evening and my wife is on her
[1:14:45] knees the the future pastor of the
[1:14:48] church there he's on his knees his wife
[1:14:52] is on her knees and they are praying for
[1:14:54] my
[1:14:56] salvation just like
[1:14:58] that but it was that time the Lord said
[1:15:03] you know when when he took Paul on the
[1:15:06] road to
[1:15:08] Damascus you know he'd seen all the
[1:15:10] stuff that's went on in Paul's
[1:15:13] life you know persecuting the Christians
[1:15:16] and all that you know the brother Brown
[1:15:19] said you can't sit on the
[1:15:21] fence you can't sit on the
[1:15:23] fence you're either a Christian or
[1:15:26] you're not a Christian right you're
[1:15:29] either going to one day have the Seal of
[1:15:32] God or you're going to end up with the
[1:15:34] mark of the
[1:15:37] beast that's the that's the short and
[1:15:39] tall of it you know the long and short
[1:15:42] of
[1:15:43] it and so I I just had this thought come
[1:15:47] into my mind there about the church
[1:15:51] here you
[1:15:53] know the church
[1:15:55] grew in White
[1:15:58] Horse
[1:16:01] and we were on out of space in the
[1:16:04] living room so I had a full
[1:16:07] basement and the one side of the
[1:16:09] basement half of the
[1:16:12] house was empty it was just a place for
[1:16:15] the kids to play
[1:16:16] hockey and
[1:16:20] uh so
[1:16:22] we fixed it up we built a baptismal tank
[1:16:27] put a bunch of chairs down there put a
[1:16:28] Pulpit down there did all that and so
[1:16:33] then we filled it up with people we're
[1:16:36] we're just in our house in the
[1:16:38] neighborhood my neighborhood on this
[1:16:40] side my neighbor on this side he was a a
[1:16:44] dentist my neighbor on that side was the
[1:16:49] uh Immigration Man his wife Kay she was
[1:16:54] our neighbor
[1:16:55] used to come and talk to my wife and
[1:16:57] stuff so whenever we preach
[1:17:00] Wednesdays Sundays summertime our
[1:17:03] windows are open and everybody in the
[1:17:06] neighborhood the street on that side and
[1:17:09] the Neighbors at that side that side the
[1:17:11] whole works they all knew what was going
[1:17:14] on you know and we would have the First
[1:17:18] Nations people that would come in and
[1:17:21] and
[1:17:23] uh cuz Ed's Ministry was to the First
[1:17:27] Nations people in the beginning and uh
[1:17:32] you would go go down in the village and
[1:17:34] have have uh have meetings there and
[1:17:39] then then
[1:17:41] uh they would come into our house and
[1:17:46] back in the day it was
[1:17:50] uh wasn't
[1:17:53] uh that cool I guess
[1:17:57] to to have the different type of people
[1:18:00] in your house and whatnot but we had
[1:18:04] everybody in our house we not only fed
[1:18:07] them
[1:18:09] the the the
[1:18:11] gospel but we fed their
[1:18:14] tummies and sent them on their way every
[1:18:17] time and they come back and one old
[1:18:19] sister she would come back she'd have
[1:18:22] two or three more with her and every
[1:18:24] time come back she'd have two or three
[1:18:26] more there she she could fill the church
[1:18:29] herself you know so she was that little
[1:18:32] sister little
[1:18:33] Maggie and uh and it was just wonderful
[1:18:38] then we outgrew
[1:18:39] the the
[1:18:42] uh we had 50 or some odd
[1:18:45] people in the
[1:18:48] basement then we outgrew that well we
[1:18:51] were talking about it and we should buy
[1:18:53] a church and so
[1:18:56] on you know should we do
[1:18:58] that we're just a little fledgling group
[1:19:01] there wasn't a whole lot of cash going
[1:19:03] around and
[1:19:06] uh
[1:19:08] so this little uh Pentecostal Church
[1:19:12] came up for
[1:19:13] sale kind of like the little one you
[1:19:16] had and
[1:19:19] uh so the real estate guy come by and he
[1:19:23] says you guys want to buy that church
[1:19:24] church so we went down and looked at it
[1:19:28] it had a it had a parsonage behind it
[1:19:31] you know one of this old type
[1:19:32] Pentecostal they had everything in there
[1:19:35] it was all all
[1:19:37] self-sufficient and
[1:19:39] uh so I I walked out of the apartment
[1:19:43] there and I walked out to the pulpit
[1:19:46] area and boy I saw all these
[1:19:50] people just at that moment I saw all
[1:19:54] these people
[1:19:55] people sitting in in the church
[1:20:00] there it was sort of a vision type thing
[1:20:07] right and I
[1:20:09] said
[1:20:11] Lord you
[1:20:13] know is this is this what we're supposed
[1:20:16] to
[1:20:16] do you
[1:20:18] know so we ended up buying the
[1:20:22] church there on Black Street
[1:20:26] and we ended up filling up that
[1:20:31] church so you
[1:20:35] know if you make a
[1:20:38] step God Will Make A
[1:20:40] step Bible says that God added to the
[1:20:43] church
[1:20:45] daily right in Pentecost the first day
[1:20:48] there was 3,000 or 4,000 then
[1:20:51] 5,000 you know as many as the Lord Our
[1:20:55] God shall
[1:20:57] call in some cities God had
[1:21:01] many had
[1:21:03] many people he told Paul he said I have
[1:21:07] many people in this city you go preach
[1:21:10] over
[1:21:11] there right I have many people maybe he
[1:21:14] hasn't got so many people in St
[1:21:16] John's that would sit and listen to a
[1:21:21] guy like me
[1:21:23] blabon you know
[1:21:26] or that don't have a feeling for the
[1:21:29] word because the word is what the
[1:21:31] attraction
[1:21:33] is right the word you know if you're
[1:21:36] attracted to the
[1:21:38] world if you're attracted to the world
[1:21:41] well you're going to go in that
[1:21:42] direction but if you're attracted to the
[1:21:45] word the pure word of God then you're
[1:21:48] going to go in a different
[1:21:50] direction amen you're going to grow into
[1:21:53] that stature
[1:21:55] of a perfect
[1:21:56] man you know when we I'm just bbing a
[1:22:00] little bit here so please forgive me but
[1:22:05] uh I I was a
[1:22:07] Catholic and I came out of Catholicism
[1:22:11] most of you know all this stuff about
[1:22:13] me
[1:22:15] and I wasn't a good Catholic
[1:22:18] either just a
[1:22:20] Catholic so you
[1:22:23] know I was the type of Catholic that
[1:22:25] well Saturday you got to go to
[1:22:27] confession because after confession
[1:22:30] you're going to the
[1:22:33] bar so something happens well be you go
[1:22:37] crash your car up then you're
[1:22:40] okay right CU you went to
[1:22:46] confession that's all we knew brother
[1:22:49] Bob you know that's all we knew back
[1:22:53] then in Newland when we lived out there
[1:22:55] in Sweet
[1:22:56] Bay
[1:22:58] so uh you know it it's
[1:23:04] uh when God comes and and and changes
[1:23:07] our lives
[1:23:09] around you know it it makes an enormous
[1:23:12] difference when he comes when Jesus
[1:23:16] comes right because there there was no
[1:23:20] there was no withdrawals from
[1:23:22] alcohol zero
[1:23:25] there was no withdrawals from smoking or
[1:23:27] anything like that zero because God took
[1:23:31] it away he replaced it right he replaced
[1:23:40] it
[1:23:42] see the nature of your soul
[1:23:46] is is God if you're born again if it's
[1:23:49] not it's off the world anything that
[1:23:51] begins has an end I read all that and
[1:23:53] then you're
[1:23:55] life did begin when you were
[1:23:58] born when God excuse me breathe the
[1:24:03] breath of life into your nostrils and
[1:24:06] you become a living
[1:24:08] Soul excuse
[1:24:10] me that nature that was in
[1:24:13] You by Nature you was off the world
[1:24:16] alienated from God you are actually
[1:24:19] animal that's exactly right anyone knows
[1:24:23] that we are mammal
[1:24:24] how many knows that we are mammal we are
[1:24:28] warm-blooded animal but that is what we
[1:24:31] are by our Earthly creation but you see
[1:24:36] what made us different from other
[1:24:38] mammals that God put a soul in US amen
[1:24:43] that's what he's working on now the
[1:24:45] other mammal don't have to wear clothes
[1:24:48] no other animal has to wear clothes to
[1:24:51] hide his shame but us we're the only
[1:24:54] ones that does because we have a soul
[1:24:57] but see God in the beginning knew what a
[1:24:59] man would be like and he created the
[1:25:02] Earth and he brought up all kinds of
[1:25:04] animals from the very lowest to the
[1:25:06] highest and the highest animal come
[1:25:08] forth was man and then first man was
[1:25:13] then and then the first man was made he
[1:25:16] was a spiritual man in the image of God
[1:25:18] which God is a spirit St John 4 he is a
[1:25:22] spirit and they that worship Him worship
[1:25:24] Him in in spirit and in truth and thy
[1:25:27] word is the truth now we worship Him in
[1:25:29] spirit and in truth he is the spirit
[1:25:31] being
[1:25:32] see so there was no man to till the soil
[1:25:35] at this time and then God formed Man Out
[1:25:39] of the Dust of the earth then he taken
[1:25:42] from his side a byproduct a
[1:25:45] rib a rib and from that separated this
[1:25:50] man which had a dual
[1:25:53] nature which was both feminist and
[1:25:57] masculine and he taken the feminist out
[1:26:01] cuz it was love that's the ladies and he
[1:26:05] placed it into the person called Eve and
[1:26:08] Adam called Eve which was his wife
[1:26:12] that's where his love natural felio love
[1:26:15] held to his wife that's the way a man
[1:26:18] should be today and her back to her
[1:26:22] husband say theand the masculine the
[1:26:25] woman the
[1:26:26] femin amen so the
[1:26:30] world wants to mess that
[1:26:33] up the world has messed that up right
[1:26:37] big
[1:26:39] time Big
[1:26:43] Time but the Bible tells you and I we
[1:26:47] are not off the
[1:26:48] world we are in the world but we're not
[1:26:52] off the
[1:26:53] world we are in
[1:26:55] Christ we're separated from that you
[1:26:59] know and we can have our opinions and
[1:27:02] what we're going to do you know but the
[1:27:05] Bible says slow to speak Swift to hear
[1:27:07] slow to
[1:27:08] WRA right
[1:27:11] amen don't worry about that you know you
[1:27:15] worry about your little families we
[1:27:17] worry about our churches and so on but
[1:27:20] far as changing what that's going on out
[1:27:23] there we live in Satan's Eden Brothers
[1:27:25] and
[1:27:26] Sisters we live in Satan's Eden right
[1:27:31] and it has been Satan's Eden since sin
[1:27:33] in the Garden of Eden it became from
[1:27:37] God's Eden into Satan's
[1:27:40] Eden
[1:27:42] right and we have to understand that in
[1:27:45] its fullness Satan's
[1:27:49] Eden everything that's he offered Jesus
[1:27:54] you know he said these are mine to
[1:27:59] give if you'll Bow Down and Worship
[1:28:05] me if you Bow Down and Worship me taking
[1:28:09] him up in the high mountain show them
[1:28:12] all the kingdoms of the
[1:28:14] world in a moment of
[1:28:18] time these are mine I'll give them to
[1:28:21] you if you will Bow Down and Worship
[1:28:26] me he didn't know he was speaking to the
[1:28:29] word of
[1:28:30] God he didn't know he was speaking to
[1:28:33] the spirit of
[1:28:34] God he didn't know he was speaking to
[1:28:37] the Holy
[1:28:38] Ghost he didn't
[1:28:40] know he says if thou
[1:28:43] be if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:28:46] yourself down the angels will catch
[1:28:51] you right tempting God
[1:29:01] we have a great we have a great
[1:29:04] separation in our
[1:29:07] day you know we've come all the way
[1:29:09] through the seven Church ages through
[1:29:12] the seven spirits of
[1:29:14] God and and the the ministers that he
[1:29:17] had the messengers that he had for each
[1:29:21] age and we came to this final age
[1:29:24] the culmination of everything the end of
[1:29:27] time right the beginning of the
[1:29:30] Millennium the Rapture the Millennium
[1:29:33] the new Earth
[1:29:36] eternity there's where we're
[1:29:38] living we're not under that umbrella of
[1:29:43] Satan's Eden although although we can be
[1:29:47] we we can be influenced by it we can be
[1:29:50] influenced by it but our influence
[1:29:54] should be the word of
[1:29:57] God and like the sister was singing
[1:29:59] there this morning if our influence is
[1:30:01] the word of God and Jesus comes CU he
[1:30:05] will
[1:30:06] come he knows not a not a sparrow false
[1:30:10] from heaven but he knows he knows our
[1:30:13] needs he knows our monetary condition he
[1:30:15] knows our health conditions we just
[1:30:18] believe on him act on him by faith
[1:30:21] receive from him
[1:30:24] right we receive from him we receive all
[1:30:27] the goodness every promise in the book
[1:30:30] is mine every chapter every verse every
[1:30:35] line it's all
[1:30:38] ours we if we can accumulate the faith
[1:30:41] to believe that God is and that he is a
[1:30:45] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:51] right little sisters here in the front
[1:30:55] you
[1:30:58] know when I grew up when I was your age
[1:31:01] I don't know how old
[1:31:02] you but things were much different
[1:31:07] things were much
[1:31:10] different much
[1:31:13] different we didn't have this
[1:31:15] thing where I come from we didn't have a
[1:31:18] television we didn't have power we
[1:31:21] didn't have running water we didn't have
[1:31:23] indoor
[1:31:24] toilet we didn't even have insulation in
[1:31:27] the
[1:31:28] house when the wind blew and the
[1:31:31] curtains would blow this way
[1:31:33] inside halfway across the house you
[1:31:37] know my mom would bake bread twice a
[1:31:43] day there was eight of us kids there was
[1:31:47] mom and dad there's grandmother and
[1:31:49] grandfather Nolan my mom's
[1:31:52] parents and my grandmother dly dad's
[1:31:55] parents lived next door and you know we
[1:31:59] all had
[1:32:01] the Eek out of living is what we were
[1:32:04] doing brother Jonathan we were eing out
[1:32:06] of living we were little kids we came
[1:32:09] home from
[1:32:11] school and our entertainment was my
[1:32:14] entertainment if it was in the
[1:32:16] summertime through my book bag in the
[1:32:19] corner I jump in the boat with my dad
[1:32:21] and we go lobster fishing we go uh
[1:32:24] capelan fishing we we go squid jigging
[1:32:27] we do all those things that was
[1:32:30] entertainment and a toy we had what we
[1:32:33] call a hoop and Gater it was
[1:32:36] around uh what do we call them
[1:32:40] Mark you never used one of
[1:32:45] those he's from the
[1:32:50] city yeah it was just a little that you
[1:32:52] know the wooden barrels
[1:32:54] they had staves in them right they were
[1:32:56] slats you know wooden barrels curved
[1:32:58] like that and they had the the iron
[1:33:01] Hoops around them that held it all
[1:33:02] together and the product inside it uh
[1:33:06] kept it all in place so we would take
[1:33:09] the Hoops out and we would get a piece
[1:33:11] of galvanized wire and we would we would
[1:33:14] uh it'd be that long so we would double
[1:33:17] it up bring it back and put a kink on it
[1:33:19] and then we'd have that hoop which was
[1:33:21] around and we'd run that around
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:25] around that was our
[1:33:28] toys right but you know today there is
[1:33:35] so
[1:33:36] much influence of one type or the
[1:33:40] other right there's just so much
[1:33:44] influence you know and influence it
[1:33:48] influences depending on what influence
[1:33:51] mostly it'll influence away from God
[1:33:57] right
[1:34:01] because through prophecy God told
[1:34:04] Brother bam because thou H has
[1:34:06] chosen the narrow
[1:34:09] way which is my way the narrow way which
[1:34:15] is my way and that's why we have to
[1:34:17] think about so much in Satan's Eden you
[1:34:20] know you know we have to to
[1:34:24] to separate ourselves we have to be
[1:34:27] constantly Vigilant like we read in the
[1:34:30] scripture there we have to be constantly
[1:34:34] Vigilant you know that we're walking in
[1:34:38] the light as he is in the light
[1:34:42] constantly we can't uh we can't we can't
[1:34:46] go Rogue on that you know we have to
[1:34:50] constantly cuz your devil Satan
[1:34:54] the adversary WTH about as a roaring
[1:34:56] lion seeking whom he may
[1:34:59] devour and like I said we live in
[1:35:01] Satan's Eden Satan's Eden all the
[1:35:05] denominational churches out there you
[1:35:07] know they've either get the beginning of
[1:35:11] the mark of the beast already or they
[1:35:14] they'll get the fullness of it one of
[1:35:16] these
[1:35:17] days
[1:35:19] right when his little bride goes up we
[1:35:22] know that Satan comes
[1:35:24] down
[1:35:26] right but we look at this picture
[1:35:31] here and we add to our faith
[1:35:34] virtue and we add to Virtue knowledge we
[1:35:38] add to knowledge Temperance we add to
[1:35:40] Temperance patience and we add to
[1:35:43] patience godliness and we add to
[1:35:46] Godliness brotherly
[1:35:47] kindness and the Holy Spirit loved the
[1:35:51] Capstone Ministry that that's the that's
[1:35:55] the place that we live
[1:35:57] in that is what God has ordained for you
[1:36:00] and I to have that love brothers and
[1:36:04] sisters you know Bible says without
[1:36:07] faith it is impossible to please
[1:36:09] God you
[1:36:12] know the little song that sings the love
[1:36:14] of God is greater
[1:36:16] far than tongue or pen could ever tell
[1:36:25] I was going to sing a special before I
[1:36:27] got started this
[1:36:28] morning but because I'm 76 was Jal I
[1:36:32] forget sometimes what I'm going to
[1:36:34] do and probably good
[1:36:37] thing that I forget
[1:36:40] sometimes
[1:36:43] yeah there was no man to till the soil
[1:36:46] and then God made man out off the dust
[1:36:48] of the Earth
[1:36:58] I read
[1:36:59] that and then after he made man in his
[1:37:02] own image created he them male and
[1:37:04] female there was no man to till the soil
[1:37:07] and he put him in the dust of the earth
[1:37:10] therefore he was that man this human man
[1:37:14] was mammal see he was an animal he was
[1:37:17] animal but he put the spirit of God in
[1:37:21] of spirit of God a made life into him
[1:37:25] and made him on the
[1:37:27] basis that he could make a
[1:37:31] choice I think that's
[1:37:33] wonderful
[1:37:35] right God before the foundation of the
[1:37:40] world he had all our names written in
[1:37:43] the Lamb's Book of
[1:37:46] Life and he put each one of us under
[1:37:49] free moral agency
[1:37:54] God is omniscent he's omnipotent he's
[1:37:59] omnipresent he's all powerful he's all
[1:38:01] these things God knows
[1:38:05] everything God knows
[1:38:10] everything right so he puts us here
[1:38:14] under free moral agency free moral
[1:38:18] agency my
[1:38:22] brother it wouldn't be
[1:38:25] just it wouldn't be just brother
[1:38:27] brandham says it in this book of Le it
[1:38:29] wouldn't be just that God would send us
[1:38:32] to this earth and say now brother
[1:38:36] Mark I'm going to make you this way and
[1:38:39] I'm going to make you do this I'm going
[1:38:41] to make you do that I'm going to make
[1:38:43] you do something else see that's not
[1:38:46] what he
[1:38:47] did he put brother
[1:38:50] Mark on the earth and he gave him
[1:38:54] a free moral
[1:38:56] agency to do what God already knew what
[1:39:00] brother Mark was going to
[1:39:02] do he knew all that but because you have
[1:39:05] free moral
[1:39:07] agency it's your
[1:39:09] responsibility it's not God towering
[1:39:12] over you you understand what I mean it's
[1:39:15] not God towering over you you know it's
[1:39:19] not Mom and Dad towering over you you
[1:39:22] know it your free moral agency to do
[1:39:26] what's
[1:39:28] right to take the right
[1:39:38] Road he says we think we're
[1:39:42] something just
[1:39:44] remember what are we a cloud of dirt
[1:39:48] dirt that's
[1:39:52] all and because thust th art thus thou
[1:39:55] shall
[1:39:57] return excuse
[1:40:00] me so when you see this man walking down
[1:40:03] the street thinking he is somebody you
[1:40:07] know and got a little education and
[1:40:09] things remember it's a cloud of Indiana
[1:40:12] dust that's all and that woman that's
[1:40:16] all dressed in shorts and smoking
[1:40:18] cigarettes and carrying on down the
[1:40:20] street twisting like she owned the whole
[1:40:22] country it's a cloud of Indiana and a
[1:40:25] dust and that's the way it's turning
[1:40:28] back so you're not very much to begin
[1:40:30] with see so that's right that's what you
[1:40:34] are but that Soul this is
[1:40:38] where that Soul that's in there that
[1:40:41] Soul that's in there see that soul is
[1:40:44] what God is working on that soul that
[1:40:48] nature that little spot now I'm going to
[1:40:52] vary off a little bit at there brother
[1:40:54] Jonathan cuz I didn't have a printer and
[1:40:57] I and I I had some things I wanted to
[1:41:01] share just this one little message here
[1:41:03] is United under one head
[1:41:07] 1958 see and I haven't read all the
[1:41:11] scripture but that's all
[1:41:12] right that's all
[1:41:14] right because uh my topic was sort of
[1:41:17] Grace it was UNG Grace the grace of God
[1:41:23] let's
[1:41:24] see Ephesians 4:7 says but unto every
[1:41:28] one of us is given Grace according to
[1:41:31] the measure of the gift of
[1:41:34] God Ephesians
[1:41:37] 3:1 talking about Grace again he says
[1:41:40] for this cause I Paul the prisoner of
[1:41:43] Jesus Christ for you
[1:41:44] Gentiles if you heard of the
[1:41:46] dispensation of the grace of God which
[1:41:48] is given me toward you or for you see
[1:41:54] so I was been in this message for a
[1:41:57] while and I'm sorry I didn't have the
[1:41:59] notes Here for it or copied them
[1:42:07] off and
[1:42:14] uh I don't want to go back too far
[1:42:17] because I don't want to read a whole
[1:42:19] bunch
[1:42:33] I just move ahead
[1:42:34] here okay remember that anything that
[1:42:39] man does that's outside the plan of
[1:42:43] God remember anything that man does
[1:42:46] that's outside the plan of God it's
[1:42:50] perverted it's perverted
[1:42:53] so listen now no matter how good it
[1:42:56] looks it's still
[1:42:58] perverted because God's got his original
[1:43:02] idea and he gave it to man and man wants
[1:43:05] to make something of his own self see he
[1:43:08] wants to have something to do into it
[1:43:12] man he wants to
[1:43:15] intrude he wants to add his two censor
[1:43:18] word to what God has but God don't need
[1:43:22] our two censor brothers and
[1:43:24] sisters he took
[1:43:27] Moses a a great learned man he took him
[1:43:30] from the pharaoh's Court the best that
[1:43:33] Moses could do was kill an
[1:43:35] Egyptian right but God took him out took
[1:43:39] him to the backside of the desert with a
[1:43:40] high tempered woman for 40
[1:43:43] years he came back out of there Meek and
[1:43:46] humble so sisters you got to Ministry
[1:43:51] it keep these boys
[1:43:56] humble right got to have a little
[1:44:01] humor see but God Moses left
[1:44:05] there Moses left there after after 40
[1:44:10] years her and sheep and cattle or
[1:44:12] whatever he left there to come back out
[1:44:16] and and and and the Bible says that
[1:44:20] Moses turned aside to see a
[1:44:24] PHA Moses actually turned aside to see
[1:44:27] that phenomena the pillar of
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:31] fire think about
[1:44:33] it you know if Moses hadn't turned
[1:44:38] aside God would never have spoke to
[1:44:41] him the pedal of fire was
[1:44:44] there the Bush was
[1:44:47] burning and and Moses went to see what
[1:44:51] it was all about
[1:44:54] better Bram talks about it there in the
[1:44:56] book you know but Moses never applied
[1:45:01] any of the things that he had previously
[1:45:03] learned down in Egypt from Pharaoh he
[1:45:06] never appi applied any scientific
[1:45:10] Revelation if you want to call it that
[1:45:12] way to
[1:45:14] that but because he turned aside because
[1:45:18] he showed interest in what was going on
[1:45:21] in that burning bush
[1:45:23] God spoke to him said Moses remove the
[1:45:28] shoes off your feet for the ground you
[1:45:30] stand on his Holy Ground Holy Ground
[1:45:32] being that the holy God was there on the
[1:45:36] ground
[1:45:39] right and
[1:45:42] and and and Moses received his
[1:45:47] commission from
[1:45:49] God to go and
[1:45:53] God told him he says I've come down I've
[1:45:56] heard the cries of my people I've come
[1:46:00] down to take him out and Moses I'm going
[1:46:03] to send
[1:46:06] you so after all his education didn't
[1:46:09] work after all his in the desert he was
[1:46:13] coming back after 80 years heading back
[1:46:16] into Egypt to take God's people
[1:46:21] out God was doing it
[1:46:23] it but Moses was one man in the hand of
[1:46:29] God but random was one man in the hand
[1:46:33] of God
[1:46:54] you
[1:46:57] see that soul is what God is working on
[1:47:01] see if he can only get that nature that
[1:47:03] Spirit to agree with him then that
[1:47:06] nature
[1:47:08] dies don't you want to agree with
[1:47:11] God
[1:47:13] Amen look I can't do
[1:47:16] nothing you know I can't make one hair
[1:47:20] white or black so why do I
[1:47:23] persist in controlling God I should let
[1:47:27] God control
[1:47:29] me
[1:47:30] right I should let the controller have
[1:47:35] control
[1:47:41] see the
[1:47:42] nature and the love of the world dies
[1:47:46] and the things of the world is dead see
[1:47:51] because if he loved the world or the
[1:47:53] things of the world the love of God's
[1:47:54] Not In You And A man must be born
[1:47:58] again so this Nature has to
[1:48:01] Die the one that we were born with the
[1:48:05] nature don't have to change your body
[1:48:07] don't have to change anything it's God
[1:48:10] that changes your
[1:48:11] nature it's the spirit of God that comes
[1:48:15] in and changes our
[1:48:20] nature it says in the nature of God
[1:48:22] comes in and lives in you and God is the
[1:48:25] only thing there is that never did begin
[1:48:29] or never can end so therefore he has
[1:48:34] partnership
[1:48:36] partnership you see and taken this man
[1:48:40] earthy Earthly and this eternal spirit
[1:48:44] and put it
[1:48:47] together no man can do that oh boy huh
[1:48:52] no no man can do
[1:48:55] that because God reflected himself back
[1:48:59] in that that he become a man when he
[1:49:03] become Christ Jesus and he was God see
[1:49:07] God was in
[1:49:09] Christ that's see lived in him
[1:49:12] reconciling the world to
[1:49:15] himself and through that perfect man
[1:49:18] each one of us imperfect imperfect we
[1:49:22] were were each one
[1:49:25] imperfect that believe in God and has
[1:49:30] accepted that become the Perfection of
[1:49:34] him we
[1:49:36] become we become the Perfection of
[1:49:43] God he never left talking about the Lord
[1:49:47] he never left his body to seek
[1:49:49] corruption nor did he leave his soul in
[1:49:52] hell
[1:49:54] but raised him up on the third day and
[1:49:57] he's alive forever
[1:49:59] more and we will have a body like his
[1:50:02] own glorious
[1:50:05] body that's why we're baptized into his
[1:50:09] name it's not it's not uh talking
[1:50:14] to
[1:50:16] somebody
[1:50:18] and so I said what do you think about
[1:50:22] well what do you think about have you
[1:50:23] given water baptism some thought my
[1:50:29] brother he says it's not for me right
[1:50:36] now it's not for me right
[1:50:40] now he feels
[1:50:44] he's good
[1:50:46] person and he
[1:50:48] is don't get me wrong
[1:50:52] but it's not for him right
[1:50:58] now and I don't see many people out
[1:51:03] there you know when I come to
[1:51:12] Newland like the families not I'm not
[1:51:15] talking about the church here I think
[1:51:17] the families out
[1:51:20] there uh
[1:51:24] I don't see too many people that's
[1:51:32] concerned about
[1:51:37] God we're not concerned no more brother
[1:51:40] Gerald not us but the world is not
[1:51:44] concerned
[1:51:48] anymore you know brother Brandon
[1:51:51] preached that message convinced
[1:51:54] then
[1:51:55] concerned we got to be
[1:51:58] convinced
[1:52:00] right who convinced
[1:52:03] me that I should put down my pool stick
[1:52:05] and my bear
[1:52:08] bottle that was
[1:52:12] God you know I had nothing to do with
[1:52:15] that and I'm so glad I had nothing to do
[1:52:18] with
[1:52:20] that I'm so glad that I was was God that
[1:52:23] like I didn't have no
[1:52:25] repercussions and no uh withdrawals
[1:52:28] pardon me I don't I didn't have any
[1:52:31] withdrawals from drinking beer and
[1:52:35] carousing I was a new
[1:52:38] man that's the song I was going to sing
[1:52:41] for you the old man is

[1:53:25] no
[1:53:26] hope if God didn't come in there's no
[1:53:30] hope there's no hope out there for the
[1:53:33] families if God doesn't come by his
[1:53:36] Divine Holy Spirit and touch someone's
[1:53:39] life there is no
[1:53:46] hope I used to live such a wicked life
[1:53:51] had no hope in sight
[1:53:53] I was lost in the
[1:53:55] darkness searching for the
[1:53:58] light God was searching for
[1:54:05] me you know he's still searching for
[1:54:08] man Adam never searched for God God says
[1:54:13] Adam Where Art
[1:54:14] Thou where art th
[1:54:17] Adam can you imagine that
[1:54:20] day what happened back there

[1:54:37] my when we come to the end can we sing
[1:54:40] that of course I'm so glad Jesus lifted
[1:54:48] me going to talk just a moment on
[1:54:51] Abraham

[1:54:57] will it's 12:45 so when did I start with
[1:55:02] John I'm
[1:55:07] good talking about that
[1:55:12] baptism that we might come forth in his
[1:55:14] name in his death in his
[1:55:18] resurrection that we Rise Again
[1:55:21] testifying to the world that we have new
[1:55:25] life sir see
[1:55:29] now I've walked before my siblings my
[1:55:33] families all those I've associated with
[1:55:36] over the last 50
[1:55:40] years now 50 years a long time well
[1:55:43] will'll be 50 years in in
[1:55:46] 26 50 years is a long time
[1:55:49] brother you know but but time is nothing
[1:55:53] in the hand of God that's
[1:55:56] just couple hours or whatever I don't
[1:55:59] know I don't know see
[1:56:03] but people know your manner of
[1:56:08] life people know where you go where you
[1:56:11] stand day in day
[1:56:15] out you're a
[1:56:17] Christian Christian is
[1:56:20] Christlike to be a Christ that means
[1:56:23] Christ Living in you amen Christ is
[1:56:26] living in us see that's him doing all
[1:56:30] that that's not you and me that's him he
[1:56:34] saw you before the foundation of the
[1:56:35] world he had your names on the Lamb's
[1:56:38] Book of Life we said that earlier see
[1:56:41] he's he's just coming back he's just
[1:56:43] gathering together all
[1:56:46] his right getting us ready for that
[1:56:50] Rapture stature of a perfect
[1:56:52] man praise God I like
[1:56:56] that you
[1:56:59] know when we were
[1:57:01] born natural
[1:57:03] birth natural
[1:57:06] birth we had a lot of learning to
[1:57:10] do
[1:57:12] right we had a lot of things to do we
[1:57:14] had to learn how
[1:57:16] to
[1:57:18] walk we had to learn how to talk the
[1:57:22] only thing we didn't have to learn to do
[1:57:24] was tell a lie we already that was
[1:57:27] already in
[1:57:31] us but we we had to learn how to walk we
[1:57:34] had to learn how to talk we had to learn
[1:57:37] how
[1:57:38] to ride our bike we had to learn how to
[1:57:42] do everything till we become an adult we
[1:57:45] we learned all those things we got our
[1:57:47] education some of us and uh
[1:57:52] all those things it was a
[1:57:54] growth there was a growth natural
[1:57:58] growth
[1:58:00] right so when we come to Christ there's
[1:58:02] a spiritual growth that takes place in a
[1:58:07] Christian we don't always be a
[1:58:11] baby right we don't always be a
[1:58:17] teenager we become an adult
[1:58:26] right Paul was talking to one church and
[1:58:29] he says I have need to to feed you with
[1:58:31] milk and not with meat because you
[1:58:36] couldn't you can't handle
[1:58:37] it
[1:58:39] right so we grow in Christ we grow in
[1:58:43] Grace we grow into the stature of a
[1:58:47] perfect
[1:58:49] man we grow into the stature of a
[1:58:51] perfect
[1:58:53] man you know brother
[1:58:55] brandham I was reading it there 14 years
[1:59:00] old his buddy shoots him injures both
[1:59:04] his
[1:59:05] legs you
[1:59:09] know now brother brandom is not my
[1:59:14] absolute right brother brandham was a
[1:59:17] prophet of God he was the son of man
[1:59:21] revealing the son of
[1:59:23] man
[1:59:25] right and
[1:59:29] uh he had a
[1:59:32] revelation at
[1:59:34] 14
[1:59:36] he he didn't want to go to that place
[1:59:38] that he went in the
[1:59:41] vision he didn't want to go back there
[1:59:45] cuz he says I firmly believe I've been
[1:59:48] to both
[1:59:49] places Been to Hell
[1:59:52] and I've been to the to the place of the
[1:59:57] redeemed Heavenly
[2:00:01] places
[2:00:03] wow you know the only thing that he
[2:00:06] could offer to the Lord at
[2:00:09] 14 he says Lord I never did commit
[2:00:14] adultery I
[2:00:16] lied did all those things he said but he
[2:00:19] never did commit adultery
[2:00:23] and he asked the Lord for another chance
[2:00:25] because he got into that thing and he
[2:00:27] was going down down down down down down
[2:00:31] and there was no
[2:00:33] stopping there was no stopping going
[2:00:37] down
[2:00:39] right bunch of years later he's coming
[2:00:41] up he's sitting in waiting for his wife
[2:00:43] in the JC Penny
[2:00:46] store and he sees these women coming up
[2:00:49] the
[2:00:50] escalator and they got the the the big
[2:00:54] uh bushed up haircut what you call that
[2:00:57] hair or uh I don't know what they call
[2:01:00] it you girls wouldn't know about it cuz
[2:01:03] you're you don't but the way women used
[2:01:06] to wear their hair was out in BO big
[2:01:09] head and they had this stuff on their
[2:01:12] eyes
[2:01:13] green and all that painted up and when
[2:01:17] he saw all that he saw what he saw in
[2:01:20] Hell was was
[2:01:23] the the the
[2:01:26] cat that Lo the face that looked like
[2:01:29] the cat you know he saw all
[2:01:32] that and he saw saw the depravity of it
[2:01:37] all and and then they saw it
[2:01:41] manifested and and he went into shock
[2:01:44] there at JC Penney
[2:01:46] basically he went into
[2:01:48] shock when his wife came and says what
[2:01:51] happened to you you what's going on they
[2:01:54] got out of there
[2:02:02] but now I'm just going to close here
[2:02:04] right
[2:02:05] away he
[2:02:12] says now we notice in this there's many
[2:02:15] things that happens sometimes and we
[2:02:18] wonder why they happen and we question
[2:02:21] ourselves we question others but finally
[2:02:24] after a while we find out that if we're
[2:02:27] Christians it all works out just right
[2:02:31] somehow see it all works out just right
[2:02:35] we don't have to invent the wheel right
[2:02:38] see you've seen that all Christians see
[2:02:42] that we wonder why we did it see and he
[2:02:46] says I wondered sometimes when I first
[2:02:48] read the Bible why did God let Abraham
[2:02:52] Abraham's the father of her faith father
[2:02:55] of her faith that great man ever stand
[2:02:58] there and say that Sarah wasn't his
[2:03:03] wife
[2:03:05] wow Abraham the father of her
[2:03:12] faith and how did he let him stand there
[2:03:15] and lie about
[2:03:16] that and the things that he did and then
[2:03:20] how that he ever let Abraham leave the
[2:03:24] promised
[2:03:25] land where he told him not to
[2:03:28] leave see there was a there was a
[2:03:31] drought or a famine or whatever they
[2:03:33] went down into guer to get food outside
[2:03:39] the promised land see he
[2:03:43] says why did and how you ever let
[2:03:46] Abraham leave the promised land where he
[2:03:48] told him not to leave any Jew that
[2:03:51] leaves the promised land is
[2:03:53] backslid cuz God gave them that to gave
[2:03:56] that to them and promised them to stay
[2:03:58] there see and they left it so he went
[2:04:01] down into guer into guer and then aimc
[2:04:06] that King down
[2:04:07] there in the Philistine country fell in
[2:04:11] love with
[2:04:12] Sarah the king fell in love with
[2:04:18] Sarah now Sarah was pretty old
[2:04:29] the king fell in love with
[2:04:39] Sarah and was going to marry
[2:04:43] her he was a good man a righteous
[2:04:47] man now I think Abraham was 60 75 Maybe
[2:04:52] and Sarah was
[2:04:57] 65 and this King aimik fell in love with
[2:05:00] her
[2:05:02] wow was he
[2:05:12] blind look what happens when God changes
[2:05:14] a
[2:05:16] person
[2:05:18] right oh what a change
[2:05:23] Grace has
[2:05:29] wro Sarah was going to marry uh Sarah
[2:05:33] and was going to marry her and he was a
[2:05:36] good man a righteous man and after now
[2:05:38] he says probably this sounds ridiculous
[2:05:42] but to make it so real to you after he
[2:05:45] had his evening
[2:05:47] bath and put on his pajamas and said his
[2:05:51] prayers and went to
[2:05:53] bed this is a b he's talking about the
[2:05:56] Lord appeared to him and
[2:05:58] said you're just as good as a dead
[2:06:05] man your life is a boat to be taken from
[2:06:08] you and the man had done nothing see he
[2:06:12] was absolutely deceived by both Abraham
[2:06:16] and Sarah that's right he said you've
[2:06:20] got another man's wife and I won't hear
[2:06:24] your prayers no matter how much you pray
[2:06:26] you're as good as
[2:06:28] dead but that man is my
[2:06:32] Prophet see see it's hard to understand
[2:06:36] that it's hard to understand that see
[2:06:39] but if it wasn't so we wouldn't know
[2:06:43] what Grace
[2:06:45] is if it wasn't so we wouldn't know what
[2:06:49] Grace is
[2:06:52] yeah musicians you can
[2:07:06] come let me read this for you
[2:07:11] here he says now we're we're all this is
[2:07:14] fate is our Victory now we're all made
[2:07:17] out of the same stuff see we're all made
[2:07:20] out of the same
[2:07:23] stuff it just depends on how your
[2:07:26] Ambitions
[2:07:28] run are you willing to let the master
[2:07:32] Craftsman make out of
[2:07:34] you that which he could use and that
[2:07:38] which he could control and that which he
[2:07:41] could
[2:07:42] power amen Paul a
[2:07:45] prisoner he laid it all
[2:07:49] down Moses
[2:07:52] laid it all
[2:07:53] down different different people in the
[2:07:56] Bible laid it all down and that now it's
[2:08:00] you and
[2:08:01] I you know what does that song mean I
[2:08:05] surrender all I surrender
[2:08:09] all All to
[2:08:12] Jesus I
[2:08:14] Surrender I surrender
[2:08:16] all one more verse
[2:08:24] God wants to mold and make us what he
[2:08:27] wants us to
[2:08:30] be he says but how can we do that or how
[2:08:33] can God do that when we want even stand
[2:08:38] still for him to do it he wants to be
[2:08:41] our we want to be our own Master we
[2:08:44] think we want to think our own way of
[2:08:48] thinking amen so it's
[2:08:53] important that we always consider this
[2:08:57] we live in Satan's
[2:08:59] Eden all right Satan's eating is a major
[2:09:06] influencer right so if we take that
[2:09:10] influence of Satan's eating no matter
[2:09:11] what we do brothers and sisters everyday
[2:09:13] work washing your dishes don't matter
[2:09:16] what you're doing you know if if if the
[2:09:20] world influences
[2:09:21] us more than the word of God influences
[2:09:25] the message of the hour the
[2:09:28] Bible if we're being influenced more by
[2:09:31] the
[2:09:32] world it's there we have an end time
[2:09:36] endday spirit it's cold c o l d it's
[2:09:41] cold it's a cold
[2:09:46] Spirit Leo de he says because you are
[2:09:49] lukewarm I will spew the out of my mouth
[2:09:53] I would rather that you either cold or
[2:09:57] hot right no on
[2:10:01] defense cold or hot God wants us hot he
[2:10:06] wants us on
[2:10:07] fire for him he wants us to be
[2:10:13] alive you know to have that faith of
[2:10:17] Abraham God still protected Abraham even
[2:10:21] though he he had to lie to save his skin
[2:10:25] to
[2:10:26] AMC he had to lie and so on but God
[2:10:29] still hey got him back into the promised
[2:10:32] land got him on the straight and narrow
[2:10:35] again
[2:10:46] right he says
[2:10:52] but let me tell you
[2:10:58] something
[2:11:00] tonight let me go back one paragraph
[2:11:03] here many people come into the church
[2:11:05] and join the church put their name on
[2:11:08] the
[2:11:09] book and doesn't even
[2:11:12] consider what the church
[2:11:15] believes or check up with that church
[2:11:19] how they preach the word you
[2:11:22] know you know you would think if you

[2:12:38] everybody was delighted about
[2:12:41] it God doing a miracle praise God God
[2:12:44] did a
[2:12:46] miracle now he says unless it's
[2:12:49] scientifically proven
[2:12:51] scientifically proven nobody wants to
[2:12:54] hear about
[2:12:57] it scient scientific is not
[2:13:01] Faith right scientific doesn't create
[2:13:10] Faith he said
[2:13:14] uh or check up with that church how they
[2:13:17] preach the word of God wouldn't that be
[2:13:19] nice brother Jonathan you know you get
[2:13:21] some people knocking on your door here

[2:22:39] to you
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:56] brother brandham uses Paul as an
[2:23:00] example he says Paul with all his great
[2:23:04] intellects he was taught by gilia to be
[2:23:08] a great priest or Rabbi
[2:23:10] someday and he had high
[2:23:13] ambition he was intelligently a great
[2:23:16] man great Authority great man in the
[2:23:19] nation
[2:23:21] but he had to sacrifice every bit of it
[2:23:24] to become a part of the word to express
[2:23:27] Jesus
[2:23:30] Christ see he knowed what it
[2:23:35] was he had a no notion to go someplace
[2:23:39] some brethren had called him but he was
[2:23:41] forbidden by the spirit to do his own
[2:23:45] will oh if
[2:23:47] people half spiritual can pick that up
[2:23:51] up he was forbidden to do it to do his
[2:23:55] own
[2:23:56] will he only could do the spirit forbid
[2:24:01] me he says he he was a prisoner of
[2:24:06] Christ Moses's
[2:24:09] intellectuals he had to lose them in
[2:24:11] order to find Christ to be a
[2:24:14] prisoner then when God got all the world
[2:24:17] beat out of him and all the mighty man
[2:24:20] that he
[2:24:22] was and stand in the presence of that
[2:24:25] Pillar of Fire that day he was found
[2:24:28] just speech
[2:24:31] speechless he couldn't even
[2:24:33] talk he
[2:24:36] said God had a prisoner
[2:24:39] see you w you want try after your own
[2:24:43] searching then God has to end do this
[2:24:46] man to Endo him with power enough that
[2:24:48] he could go down there see
[2:24:50] Lord I and he said Lord I told Pharaoh
[2:24:54] what you said and he wouldn't do it see
[2:24:58] he said then take this Rod God
[2:25:02] speaking that's God's word take the rod
[2:25:06] go out there and pointed toward the East
[2:25:08] and call for flies and flies come into
[2:25:12] creation because he had a
[2:25:15] prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off
[2:25:18] with
[2:25:19] nothing see
[2:25:21] nobody could turn him no way he was a
[2:25:24] complete
[2:25:25] prisoner in the chains of God's
[2:25:28] word bound up holy to thus sayeth the
[2:25:33] Lord oh if God can get his prisoners
[2:25:36] like that
[2:25:38] no that's when he can express his
[2:25:43] preeminence
[2:25:45] right God can get you brothers and
[2:25:48] sisters to rely totally on the word of
[2:25:53] God said Lord thy will not
[2:25:58] mine that's when he can express his
[2:26:05] preeminence you
[2:26:08] see he's got the
[2:26:10] man or the person so that he knows
[2:26:14] nothing but
[2:26:18] Christ you get what I
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:23] mean he says that
[2:26:25] secondarily and
[2:26:27] secondly talking about
[2:26:33] Christ he says first Christ wanted first
[2:26:37] to express himself
[2:26:39] completely God in
[2:26:42] Christ
[2:26:44] secondly to have the
[2:26:46] preeminence in his
[2:26:49] church which is his body
[2:26:52] bride he could have the preeminence to
[2:26:56] express
[2:26:58] himself can you
[2:27:00] imagine you're the body of
[2:27:03] [Music]
[2:27:05] Christ there's no other way to say
[2:27:10] it you're the expression of
[2:27:14] Christ the
[2:27:18] image the likeness
[2:27:21] the
[2:27:25] fullness think about it brother or
[2:27:29] sister you know
[2:27:32] that'll get your feet to
[2:27:38] dancing right how could we do that
[2:27:41] Christ in you the hope of
[2:27:45] glory I'm
[2:27:49] done which is his buddy he could have
[2:27:51] the preeminence to express himself to
[2:27:54] that and thirdly to restore the kingdom
[2:27:56] to its rightful position that fell by
[2:27:59] the sin by sin by the first Adam back to
[2:28:03] where he walked in the cool of the
[2:28:05] evening with his people talk with them
[2:28:08] fellowship with them you know brother
[2:28:11] brandom talks about in the early days
[2:28:13] then down there you know you could find
[2:28:17] God

[2:28:20] anywhere is talking to
[2:28:24] people

[2:28:41] God all the principles you go
[2:28:44] back down see everything falling away
[2:28:47] when it comes this way
[2:28:50] Bible says remove not the old
[2:28:54] landmarks remove not the ancient
[2:28:57] landmarks remove not the old
