Lord to give him strength and maybe some help. [snorts] Um, my coworker Gareth, his sister, passed away tragically uh early J I'm sorry, she had a a heart attack early January then passed away this past week and uh he's obviously him and the family going through a rough time and just want to bring grace to him. Uh before I forget the there's uh you should have all gotten a ballot on the way in. So uh all the eligible voters would have gotten a ballot on their way in. So, if you guys can uh just have those filled out and uh Brother Matt's going to pick them up at the beginning of the after service, the after song service. Brother Matt's going to pick those up. Um want to continue to keep Brother Chad in prayer. I think he's here this morning, but the family, but grace to him just as he continues to recover for brother Dale Worshleer. We've been praying for Cherry and Piery. Just God's grace to her and the the need that's there and for the saints around the island for the church in central those traveling grace to all of them.

Our heavenly father, Lord, we deem it a privilege to come into your house today. Father, come into your presence, Lord, to know, Father, that wherever two or three or more are gathered, Father, in your name, there would you be in the midst, Father. So, we believe it today, Father, that you're here, Lord, to answer prayer, to meet the needs of the people, Father, and Lord, to lift burdens, Father, from the shoulders of your children. So Lord we pray forgive us of our sins and our mistakes Lord as we just sang. Lord cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord but renew a right spirit and restore the joy of your salvation into every heart lord and to know that you've been with us and that you will be with us right until the end father. And we pray Lord that you would just guide us through this world of sin and evil father. It's just not getting any better Lord but Father we're looking for a change. We're looking for a new body and we're just praying, Lord, that that day will be soon. Lord, we pray you'd minister to each one. Father, remember Sister Nadine today, Lord, and pray you meet her need, Father. And for those that mourn, Lord, the loss of a loved one, Lord, we just pray that you'd just be with them, Father, and in some way show yourself to them that a soul might be saved. We ask your blessing, Lord, upon all the needs that were mentioned in the prayer service last night as well, Father. Lord, so many needs, but Father, so many promises, Lord, and a God, Lord, that's greater than the need. So help us to trust you, to believe you, Father. And Lord, we just pray your blessing upon the song service, Father, upon the musicians, upon Brother Joseph, Lord, that you'd be with him, Lord, and help him to hear the still small voice, guiding him to sing that [music] which you would have sown. So be with him, we pray, and with brother John as he brings the word. May grace, Lord, be with us. Be with him, Lord. And May, Father, the Holy Spirit, Lord, just draw an eye to each and every one to pull the word, Father, that that we might have our faith increase. So bless us, we pray as we commit to service to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Sing number 324. I would not be denied.

[snorts] The trials of [singing] this life were getting [singing] stronger. The pull I felt was more [singing] than I could bear. And I was on the verge of giving [singing] [music] over the strength [music and singing] within myself. It just wasn't there. [music] Something keeps [singing] holding me.

And it's the the holding force of our life, Lord, is you and us, heavenly father. Lord, how thankful we are this morning, Lord, that we can say we have a Christ inside of us, heavenly father. Lord, that we have the spirit of almighty God dwelling within us this morning. Lord, we just want to give you thanks, Lord, for your goodness and your grace once again. Lord, thank you for an opportunity to come and worship you and praise you. Lord, thank you for a chance to come and hear your word this morning, Lord God. Lord, we pray that you would just take this service now, Lord, as you've set an atmosphere, Lord, and we've worshiped and praised you, Lord. May you just now come and through your word, Lord, breathe life into us once again, Lord God. Change us, strengthen us, heal us, correct us, Lord, where we need it, Lord. I pray that we'd each one be changed in your presence this morning. Lord, just have your way now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn, if you would, to First John chapter 5. I sure enjoyed the song service this morning. Brother Joe took a number of my songs that I had for the end. So, I look at that always as a good thing. I've told the song leaders, you don't have to be in the same channel of thought as the preacher. You're there to set an atmosphere, but it's always very, very special when it comes out that way. And I the song service was just perfect this morning for the the message the Lord has laid on my heart. So, I'm thankful for that. Amen. Just a couple of announcements. Uh I'll be traveling this week, Lord willing. I had planned to leave tomorrow and come back Tuesday from Cornerbrook to pick up a vehicle, but with the weather uh patterns that are kind of evolving, I think I'll probably go Wednesday, th or Thursday, Friday, sorry. So keep me in prayer for that. Brother Garfield will take the service on Wednesday. You're still good, Brother Garfield. Amen. So keep him in prayer for that. Come expecting. Amen. Come pulling on the gift of God. Amen. It's good to see Sister Moren back with us again as well this morning. God bless you. Good to see you. Amen. I was talking to Sister Beverly in there this morning. She said they've just been hammered by the snow and and Brother Doug's out there almost every day with his snowblower, but it got so bad and and so built up and they just she was saying, "Lord, could somebody just come with a plow?" when a brother came or a man came by and offered to just clear away the big windowross that were there and that and spared him a bunch of work. So, she said, "God always takes care of us." And so, we're thankful for that. Always keep them in prayer. Amen. 1 John chapter 5, turn in your Bibles if you would because I'm going to read more than what's here. 1 John 5 and 4 says, "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith." And let's go to verse 10. He that believeth on the son of God hath had the witness in himself. He that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believed not the record that God gave of his son. And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son. He that had the son had life and he that had not the son of God hath not life. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. We're continuing our series on a position of dominion. And I want to take a title this morning of the prevailing revelation of our victory. Now, you know me, I'm not one for big grand titles, and that's a bit of a mouthful this this morning. I'm not one to usually make it too fancy, but I thought it summarized my inspiration for this service this morning as best that I could make it. Amen. And I just want to dwell on that a little bit. When we preached on Sunday, we preached on the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And we we focused on that word avail. And the word there is really prevail. And that word prevail means to be able, can do, to have strength, to be potent, to have force or power with the effect of getting something done. So we're talking about prayer that gets things done. And it comes from a position of finding the will of God. But here's the thing about prevailing. It says it embodies strength that is active in the fight. In other words, amen. When you prevail, it's not just that you fought. It's that you fought and achieved the victory. It's that you got what you got came to get. It's that you won what you came to want. It's that you walked where you came to walk. It's that you went through the door you came to go through. That you knocked down the walls that you came to knock down. Whatever it is that needed to be achieved, when you prevail, you finish the job. You didn't just try. You didn't just give it your best effort. Amen. But you are the overcomer. You're the victor. You're the winner of that situation when you prevail. Amen. But notice what it says. Prevailing embody strength. When we say that that someone embodies something, it means that you take a thought or a concept or an idea or a characteristic and that person becomes it. Amen. An embodiment means you are it. You're not just now thinking about it or you're just not believing it, but you are it. Amen. If I could pick an example this morning, take something like faithfulness. Faithful means that uh you're loyal. you're steadfast, that you're unwaving, unwavering and unswerving in your commitment. If I was to say, who embodies faithfulness? I would say we'd pick Brother Gerald because for 43 years, he pastored this church with minimal support from other ministry. He preached three services a week for 30 of those 43 years. Uh, week in and week out, whether the weather was bad or not, how many remembering having church in the snowstorms? I remember living in in Kilbride. We had to make three runs to get up the hill to our house cuz brother Gerald had us in church no matter what. Faithful. Faithful. That's what we would say. So, so faithful is not just a concept. Now we can look at brother Gerald. We can say faithful is a person. Amen. And that's our example. Is not the idea. Now we can look at the man and we can say that is faithfulness. It's no longer a concept. It's not just a characteristic. It has become a person. Amen. And so when we talk about prevailing the purpose is that it comes to a place where we become what we believe. Amen. Where we experience where we have where we project where we produce the very thing that we are claiming. Amen. So I'm preaching this morning on the prevailing revelation of our victory. And what I'm preaching on now is a revelation that changes from something that we just believe to something that we are. Amen. It becomes not something that's in our mind or just something that's in our soul, but it becomes the literal expression of our life. Amen. I'm talking about changing us from I believe to I am. That's what we're talking about here. Amen. Look at what Jesus would say. It was so interesting. Last night we had a wonderful, wonderful prayer meeting and there were things that people were saying in their prayers and I just thought, "Oh my Lord, they're they're they're in the channel. They're in the channel of what's coming for us this weekend." And listen to this. It says Jesus said, "Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?" He says, "It is thenforth good for nothing." That word good means prevail. He says, in other words, it is no longer prevailing. He says, "So it's good. It's good for nothing. It doesn't win. It doesn't do its job. So it'll be cast out and betrodden under the foot of men." So that word good is that same word avail. It's the same word prevail. And Jesus is saying when you lose the characteristics of salt, you can't be salt. You won't be used as salt because you can't do what salt does. Salt enhances flavor. Salt preserves. And so if salt has it loses the characteristic of its purpose, he says it's no good for anything except to be thrown out on the ground. There's no purpose behind it. Amen. And Jesus is saying when you stop being what you are, you don't prevail. When you don't have and express the characteristics of what you're supposed to be, you're good for nothing. Amen. That's a that's a hard statement to make, but he's saying, listen, you have purpose. You are something, so be it. Amen. Don't let anything take away that thing. Amen. Jesus is pointing to an embodiment rather than just a belief. You can say, "I believe I'm salt." But guess what? If you can't flavor something, and if you can't preserve something, I'm sorry, you're not salt. And Jesus is saying, listen, as sons and daughters of God, there's things that you have to be. There's things that you are, and you got to let that be the expression of your life. Amen. And so, he's pointing to an embodiment, a prevailing because of what we are, not just because of what we believe. Amen. Let me take it a step further. Jesus said in Mark 21:17, "When Jesus heard it, he said unto them, they that are whole." And that word whole is prevail. Those that prevail, those that have strength, have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. He says, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Notice his words there. He says, "Those that are prevailing, those that have strength, those that have health, those that are in the condition they're supposed to be in, they don't need doctors." Listen, we're not all going to a doctor every week, are we? Or every day. Why? Because dayto-day generally we're healthy. But Jesus said, "Listen, there are those that are sick." In other words, there are those that are struggling. There are those that are weak. There are those that are not where they're supposed to be. And he says, "That's why I'm coming. It's for those that aren't prevailing. I'm there for those that need a victory, but they can't get the victory. I'm there for those that keep trying, but just can't seem to cross the line. I'm there for those that are trying to open a door, but they can't get through it." He says, "That's why I came." So the answer to prevailing questions is you've got to have Christ. That's the only thing that will prevail. Amen. He's saying I came to take people that are losing and bring them to a place where they are prevailing day by day. Church, what is our natural state or condition supposed to be in our body? Is it supposed to be health or sickness? Health. We're supposed to be healthy daytoday. So, what Christ is saying here is, I've come to take you to your natural position. I've come to take you to the condition you're supposed to be in all the time. That's the reason why I came. And that's the foundation that I have for this message this morning. And I want to bring it down to where we live. So, if you go back to Genesis 22, and we're going to read some of it this morning. Genesis 22 is the story of Abraham and Isaac, where Abraham has received the promised child. He's had Isaac and he's born and and God says through Isaac is is is going to be this grand promise of a great nation. But if you look at Genesis 22:1, it says that God tested Abraham. So what happens in this chapter is a test from start to finish. And God tells Abraham to go and take Isaac and sacrifice him as an offering to God. Now church, that makes no sense to the human mind. Now, today, if I said, "God told me to sacrifice my son." You'd say, "Brother John, you're off the word." And you'd be correct. But this is a test for Abraham. It is not a real request. It is never meant to go through all the way. But it is a test of Abraham's faith to see what Abraham would do. And if we look at Abraham's soul in this moment, Paul by the the revelation of the Holy Spirit would show what was going on inside of Abraham that was bringing him to a place where he could prevail. And he says in Hebrews 11, by faith Abraham, when he was tried, when he had a test, when he was put through the ringer, Amen. If you're going to prevail, you've got to be in a test. There is no prevailing if there's no challenge. There is no prevailing if there's not a battle. He says, when he was tried, he offered up, excuse me, Isaac, and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son. Now, notice the phrasing there. He says it is his only begotten son that he offered. Why? Because it was a type of what was going to happen for us that God would offer his only begotten son and that would save us from our sins. But Abraham had to do it in type because he's the seed of God. He's a He's a son of God. He's a He's a type of what God was trying to do. So what was happening here was a representation of what God would do. But God said, "Listen, I I I love that you're faithful to do it, but this isn't your job. This is my job." But he wanted to see if he would do it. And he says, "Of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called." So Abraham made Isa made God made Abraham take his promise and put it on the line. It meant he had to he had to he had received the promised son. Now God told him to give it up. And and look at Abraham's attitude here and look at why he did it in faith. It says that he was accounting that God was able to raise him up. In other words, Abraham was willing to put the knife to Isaac believing that God had to raise him up. He said, "Even from the dead, from whence also he received him as in a figure." So in other words, Abraham figured that God had bound himself to his own promise and therefore God could not fail. God had given him the promised son as from a dead person. Anyways, Sarah's womb was dead. Abraham's seed was dried out. They weren't having relationship. So, Abraham or Isaac had already come out of death once. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God had made a promise to Abraham. Isaac's going to be the one that produces the great nation. You're going to have one. He's going to have multiple. And then from there, it's going to spread out. So, if God could do it supernaturally once, God can do it supernaturally again. That's where he was holding to. Amen. And so God that gave life the first time could be the God that gave life the second time. Now we opened up with this scripture. We're going to read it multiple times in multiple ways of service. Remember what John said. He says, "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world." He says, "And this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith." What is it that overcomes the world? Our faith. What is faith? Faith is a revelation of the will of God. Amen. Faith is when you take what God says and you say that is mine. He's talking about me that's for me. You confess it. You walk forward and you receive it. And whether you receive it in the first step or you receive it 10 miles down the road or 100 miles down the road, it doesn't matter because your faith keeps you walking because you have a revelation. He was talking about me there. Amen. That's what faith is. Amen. And so John says the the key to our victory is that we receive a revelation, a personal revelation of the will of God for our life and we go forward and we believe it until we get it. That's our victory. Amen. I'm building some key principles this morning as we move forward in this message. Now, let's look at this scene as we try and see what happened. Just build a bit of a drama here. It says, "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering." So in Genesis 22 it says that Abraham took two young men, two servants and he took Isaac and and himself obviously and a donkey and they took it all and they went to the mountain that God had said. But from there, watch what happens. Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. Who carried the cross? The son. Christ carried the cross for a while. Now Isaac's carrying the wood. It says, "And he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and they went both of them together. Everything they needed for a sacrifice is there. And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, "My father." In other words, dad. He said, "Here am I, my son?" "Yes, son. What do you want?" He said, "Behold the fire and the wood." Dad, we've got fire. We've got wood. He says, "But where's the lamb for a burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So they went both of them together. Church, your confession is so critical. Your confession is so critical. Abraham was not dodging the question. Abraham was in faith saying, "God provides." &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was prevailing in the test. He would not give a negative confession. It says, "And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the land, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, for me." So Abraham passed the test. He got to the point where he's about to drive the knife into downward and God stopped him and Abraham had prevailed. Amen. I want you to consider that scene this morning. Samuel, come on up this morning. [snorts] Amen. I want you to consider that this morning. And I'm doing this by type and shadow. Now, I I I've gone through this with Samuel yesterday, but Abraham comes and he takes Isaac and he lays him down upon the altar and he binds his hand so he can't move. And can you imagine? You're looking down. This is your hope. This is your promise. And he's laying there and you're about to do something to him that you can't ever imagine doing to your child. I don't know if you've ever killed anything. If you've ever killed an animal, if you've hunted in that, it's not it's not clean. And he's looking down at his promised son, and he knows in a second that son is going to be bleeding everything out. We look at this. I I'm faithful Abraham. But who's committed here? This is the one that's committed. I don't mean to be light, but you remember what they say about a bacon and egg sandwich. The chicken is faithful, but the pig is committed. Isaac's the one that's got to have the faith here. Abraham loses a promise, but he's got to lose his life. And you can imagine, they're sitting there and and Isaac's looking up and Abraham has told him, Isaac, the Lord has told me to sacrifice you to him. But he's saying, Isaac, but he also said that a great nation is going to come through you, &gt;&gt; Isaac. You came out of the dead once. &gt;&gt; You were a supernatural being from the beginning. You're a living promise. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to take your life. But the same God that raised you up the first time &gt;&gt; is going to raise you up the second time. Cuz God is faithful. He cannot tell a lie. And I can imagine, this is just me. I don't know. I can imagine Isaac's laying there and tears are streaming down his face. And he's saying, and Abraham saying, "Isaac, I love you. I love you. I would never do anything to hurt you, but God told me to do it, and I've got to do what God says." And Isaac's saying, "Daddy, I trust you. I trust you. Daddy, do what you want to do." And Abraham would take that knife and hold him. And you can imagine that knife coming up. If you've ever had to kill something, you hold it down and that knife comes and you tense because you got to drive with all your weight. You got to make sure the knife goes true. And as he's there and his body tenses and that knife just like that, God says, "Stop. &gt;&gt; Hold your hand. Hold your hand. Don't move." And can you imagine the relief that swept over Isaac? Did you see him flinch as I went down? And I didn't even hold a knife. I didn't even hold a knife. But something says, "Stop." And Abraham, his hand is stayed. And God says, "Listen, I know. Listen to what the prophet of God says." He says, "Now sometimes it's when you're absolutely at the end of the rope when he speaks to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Now listen to this. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering in thestead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra, as it is said to this day, in the mount of the Lord that it shall be seen." Now Jehovah Gyra, we we interpret it as the Lord will provide. But there are there are different ways to to interpret it. said, Abraham puts it here very clearly. The Lord who will appear, the Lord who will be seen. In other words, when God gives an answer, you're going to see it. &gt;&gt; It's not just going to be an ethereal thing. It's not just going to be a thought or an idea. Amen. Where is it going to be seen? In the mount of the Lord. Where is the mount of the Lord? Mount Zion. Who is Mount Zion? Hallelujah. That's the bride is Mount Zion. In the bride will be seen the Lord, the answer of the Lord, the provision of the Lord. Did Abraham see the Lord? No. But he saw his provision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Abraham saw in type the total redemption of his seed. He saw the total redemption of the children of God. He saw the answer. He saw the remedy to restore us back to God. And Abraham had nothing to do with it. He had nothing to do it. It was God's provision from start to finish. Says this in Psalms 27. It says, "I would have despared had I not believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living." Amen. Can you imagine? [snorts] He holds the knight. He holds his hand and he lays it down and he quickly unties it and he says, "Get up, Isaac. Get up, Isaac." And he says, "Look, there's a lamb right there. There's a ram right there. Come with me. We'll go get it. You can go sit down." And he goes and there's a ram caught in the thicket. Now, church, do you think that ram was there all along? I have a feeling Abraham would have noticed a ram caught in the thicket behind him. They make noises when they're caught. You're looking around. You don't know what's going to happen in these things. Amen. It says, "About that time, Abraham heard something behind him bleet and he looked around and there was a ram, a male sheep, caught by its horns in the thicket." He says, "Where did that ram come from?" Think of it. He was a 100 miles from civilization and he was up on top of the mountain where there's no water or nothing for the ram. How'd he get there? He says, "No, it wasn't a vision. It was a real ram." He picked him up and he was kicking and bleeding. Laid him up and cut his throat and blood ran out. He says, "Where did that ram come from?" No wonder he called it Jehovah Gyra. The Lord provided almighty God who can speak himself into a body, speak angels into a body, spoke that ram into existence. It came into existence one minute and five minutes later it went out of existence. He says, "For God is Jehovah Gyra. No matter what the conditions are, he will provide for himself a sacrifice." church. Last Sunday we spoke about people that are in a place where there is no way out. They can't go up. They can't go down. They can't go through. They can't go around. But yet God provides a way. We talked about people that are under burdens that seem so heavy that it would destroy them. But yet we are not crushed. We're in places where it seems like there is nothing can happen and yet we are not in despair. I'm here to tell you this morning the answer of Jehovah Gyra does not have to be according to the laws of man. It doesn't have to be according to the laws of nature. Doesn't have to be according to the laws of time. But almighty God can speak and move from eternity and in a moment he can give you what you have need of this morning. &gt;&gt; Haven't we seen it in our midst so many times? &gt;&gt; That's the way that God works in these situations. Amen. God can bring the answer, the solution, the healing, the deliverance, the salvation, whatever it might be in an instant by his spoken word from eternity. &gt;&gt; He says, "Atheists may rise, skeptics may stand, ages may turn, but God Almighty is still Jehovah Gyra." He said, "He can provide a sacrifice regardless of how deep you stooped in sin. He's still Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide a sacrifice. No matter how sick you are, how bad off you off you are, he's Jehovah Gyra. No matter what the doctor said, no matter what the people said, he's Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide in an instant of time the sacrifice needed. &gt;&gt; Church, can you imagine the jubilee that Abraham and Isaac had when he realized he didn't have to kill his son? When Isaac realized, I don't have to get my throat cut. I imagine they had a hooping and a hollering and a dancing time as they went and got that ram and prepared it together for sacrifice. Amen. And as they did that, can you imagine just the relief rolling through their minds? The absolute total joy that comes with knowing he provides. &gt;&gt; He abides. He cares. He knows. He sees. &gt;&gt; He's with me. church. But you know what I love? God wasn't done yet. Hallelujah. See, so often we're so we're so caught up in the idea of, "Oh, oh, he's healed me. He's saved me. He's delivered me." Church, he's got so much more than that. That's just the start. You eye hasn't seen nor ear heard the things that God has prepared for those that love him. He's got so much more than what we're we're focused on in this life. Because God is working from the eternal, not just from the present. God's got a plan that's got to play its way out in our life. And he's got so much more that he's wanting to do through his children. He's got more victories that are coming our way. Amen. Abraham's already had a conversation with God. They killed the lamb. And then God speaks again. He says, "And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven, out of heaven the second time and said, by myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord." This is a onesided unconditional covenant. &gt;&gt; God said, "I swore it by myself. I didn't swear it based on your actions, based on your ideas, based on your faithfulness, based on how you walk, based on how you talk, based on what you do." [snorts] He said, "I made you a promise by myself. It's on the basis of who he is that we receive. He says, "For thou, because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore." Now catch this. This is new. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. Hallelujah. Amen. Now look at this. He didn't say he did not say that Abraham would possess the gates of his enemies. He said thy seed future tense will possess the gate of his singular enemies plural. One person in the future will possess the gate of his enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that? Who is the one that's going to do that? We just have to go back to the scriptures. And Paul would say this. He says, "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made." &gt;&gt; He says, "Sir, &gt;&gt; he saith not and to seeds, but he says as of many." He says, "But as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ." Amen. So, who is the overcoming seed? Who's the overcoming one that will possess the gate of his enemies? It's got to be Jesus Christ. That is the overcomer. Amen. There is one overcomer. There is one victor. There is one mighty conqueror. And it is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. That's where we're at this morning. Amen. He is the one that possesses the gate of his enemies. Now, see, we don't understand this thought of possessing the gates of his enemies because we don't have gates anymore. You go overseas. Jamaica, they probably have gates. In in South Africa, they have gates on their houses. But in the old days, when you had a a city, you had to go through a gate to get into that city because it was surrounded by thick walls. We look at St. John's today. If you wanted to take St. John's today, if you're trying to to conquer it, you could pick your road. Many roads into St. John's, none of them guarded by a gate. But in the old days, what they would do is when they built a city, when they wanted a place to live securely, they'd build the city. And the city was defined by the exterior walls. And they built them as thick and as high as they could afford or they could do. And that was their protection. That was their security. Amen. And so I went and I looked some up. And these are these are at Jerusalem. This is the Damascus gate in Jerusalem. So this faces the outside. And so if an army came to Jerusalem, they would have to face these walls. And you look at them, they're huge. They're massive. Very difficult to get through. But also, you have gates within the city. And this is the Zion gate. This is the gate that guards Mount Zion. So you have outer gates and you have inner gates. You have layers of defense built within the city. And what would happen is if they lost the outer walls, they'd go back to the inner walls and try and hold it off there. Amen. But the thing is, you couldn't have a wall without a gate because people have to come in, people have to go out, you have to bring supplies in, you have to bring goods for commerce and trade and these different things. And so these gates were necessary, but they were also the weak point in every city because you can't build a gate as heavy as you can build a wall. Some of these walls, I mean, uh, Jericho, they could race two chariots around them all the way around. You're talking at probably 12, 15 feet thick. You can't build a gate that's made of stone 12 ft thick. You wouldn't be able to move it. You don't have hinges that would hold it. Certainly not in those days. You wouldn't. And so the the these gates were the weak points because they provided access to the city without the hard work of knocking down walls. And so, we're preach we're going to be preaching on gates very soon, Lord willing. But the point is this. If you can control the gate, you control the city. If you possess the gate, you possess the city because you control who comes in and out. They can hold the wall all day long, but if you can go in through the gate, they can't stop you. If you possess the gate, you have the victory. That was the guarantee of this. So God says there's coming one. There's coming one who will control the gate of the enemy. There's the enemy is going to have all sorts of big walls. He's going to he's going to make it look impossible. The the the the the uh the weapons he has, the thickness of the walls, the height of the walls, the the the task that you're facing is going to seem monumental. But there's a weakness, and the weakness is a gate. And there's someone coming that's going to control the gate. Amen. [snorts] Didn't we see that happen when Jesus Christ walked the earth? He cast out devils. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He walked on water. He controlled nature itself. And then at the end of it all, he died. And it would think that he had lost the battle, but he died and he went down to hell. And from there, he took the keys to death and hell to the gate. The lowest low was his greatest victory. &gt;&gt; Cuz he went down and he took it. Amen. In Revelation 1, it says this, "I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I'm alive forever more. Amen. and I have the keys of hell and death. Amen. Every gate had a means of locking it, of securing it. And traditionally, what they'd have is they would have uh they would have iron bars that they could drive down into the ground, and then they would have wooden bars that they would place along the inside. So, the iron bars on the ground would keep it from moving at the center, which is where it was weakest. And then the wooden bars that drop down would reinforce the center to try and make it impervious to attack. And so if you have a key, you can get in there. And the idea is that if you've got a key, it doesn't matter what they're doing on the inside, you can always unlock the door. [snorts] Now, I don't know. I'm sure nobody here has ever fought with a sibling where they had a door that was locked. But you know, these interior doors, they've got the little hole in the middle that you can go and you if you can poke in. We used to use like the the little tube from a from a a pen or something like that. Obviously, they have an actual thing that you do it with and you can just take and you just poke it in. They'd lock that door and think they're safe and then you just go pop it open. Then you go in, you thrash the living daylights out of them for even trying to lock you out in the first place. Paul knows what I'm talking about. Amen. [snorts] The thing is, you can be behind a locked door all you want. If somebody has the key, they're getting in. &gt;&gt; In other words, what he's saying is, I control access to your house, Satan. I know. I let him in. I let them out. I can defeat you at any time. Your vulnerability is in my hands. I do with it what I will. Are you hearing me this morning, church? Their power is still under his domain. &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing. He can't touch you unless God allows it. And all God's doing when he allows it is he's training you to overcome. &gt;&gt; He's training you to prevail. Amen. Their continued existence is only because God allows it. But there's coming a day where he says enough is enough. And they'll go into the pit and they'll be cast into fire and there'll be nothing left of them. There's coming an end to it. Amen. But for the meantime, guess what? We're in the middle of it. We're in the battle. We're the prize. But I'll tell you this, church. We are the victory as well. Brother Brown would say the church is Christ's victory today. But I want us to bring this home to our own our own lives this morning. We're preaching on the prevailing revelation of our victory, not somebody else's, of ours. Amen. And I want us to see to come to the place where we can look at these scriptures and we can see that we're in them, not out of them. Amen. That it's not an external thing, that it's not for somebody else or it was only for Christ, but it's for us. Amen. God told Abraham, "Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies." And that was Christ overcoming for us. But watch what Jesus says now to his disciples just before he's ready to go away. [snorts] It says when Jesus came to the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples saying, "Who do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some that say you are John the Baptist, some Elisha, some Jeremiah or one of the prophets?" And he said unto them, "But who say you that I am?" Church, that's the greatest question you have to answer this morning, whether you believe it, whether you realize it or not. Who is Jesus Christ today? Who is Jesus Christ? And how do you know who he is? It says, "And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." So Peter absolutely has a a supernatural, a heavenly revelation of who Christ is standing in front of him. Amen. We can't say anything but what Jesus said. And Jesus said, "Listen, this is a revelation that came from above." Amen. But he says, "And I say unto thee," watch what this revelation will do. "I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." In other words, there's something coming against the gates of hell that will prevail where hell used to prevail. And he's not just talking about himself because he says on this rock will I build my church &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell will not prevail against what? The church that is built on the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. God told Abraham, "Your seed will possess." And then God Jesus comes to Peter and his disciples and he says, "You're going to possess." There's a transference that's got to happen here. Amen. The gates of hell can't prevail against one thing, the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. The church is not built on Peter. That's a Catholic dogma that's taught. If we build it on Peter, Peter fails right after this. So, we're building on a cracked and broken foundation. But the church is built on one revelation who is Jesus Christ. Amen. It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. Now, Christ went and proved who he was when he went to hell and hell couldn't hold him. That's when he proved who he was. He took the keys of death and hell as we read in Revelation 1. And then he ascended back to heaven. Church, that's total victory. When you can go to the lowest possible region of of the the the the different layers of this this earth and this cosmos, go to where the powers of hell are greatest. You walk into there. They think they've won. And all you do is you go in and you take the keys to their house. That's total victory. Not only do you have the keys to death and hell in the grave, but now you go back to the highest levels and you rule and reign. That's a total victory when you can go from the lowest to the highest. That's what prevailing looks like, church. But he says, listen, I'm not the only one that's going to do it. You're going to do it as well. You may come from the lowest, but you'll go back to the highest. There will be a prevailing revelation inside of your life. And that's what we're talking about. Christ possessed the gate of his enemies. He came away with the keys. He proved that he was the word. Proved that the word was true. And he was the present day revelation of the word of God. That's what the Jesus Christ is. Scripture says the word was God. The word was with God. The word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Jesus Christ was the revelation of the word of God for that day in flesh. Amen. But Jesus isn't just talking about himself here. Amen. And he says, "Look, the church is built on the revelation of who I am. And when they get that revelation, hell will not be able to prevail against them. They'll possess the gates of their enemies." Jesus put that in the future with Peter and every other true son and daughter of God. Amen. Peter had a revelation here, but I want you to catch something. The revelation Peter had here did not hold him. Peter didn't prevail with this revelation. You know when Peter prevailed with this revelation? When it was present with him. When Peter knew that Jesus was there, Peter prevailed. When Peter remembered where Jesus was and that he was with them, he prevailed. Remember Peter as soon as he realized Jesus on the water, oh Lord, call me. I'll come to you. And he's looking at the word and that revelation allows him to walk on the water. But then he looks at circumstances, forgets that the present word is there, and he starts to fall down, starts to sink, and then he pulls him back up, and he walks on the water back. He prevailed over the water twice. Why? Because he had a revelation of the word of God in their midst. Amen. Peter was strong when he was there. Peter had the victory when Jesus was there. But Peter was weak whenever he forgot that Jesus was there. Peter was weak when Jesus wasn't present. Peter failed when the present word was absent. That was his failing. Peter's revelation of Jesus Christ was external to him. And because of that, as real as it was, that revelation would not hold him all the time unless Christ was there in person. He needed the revelation of the word right there. That's why Peter kept defaulting back to his own ways. When Jesus wasn't there, Peter went back to his old way of living. He went back to fishing. He went back to cursing. He went back to trying to do things on his own. Peter went back to disappointing himself. Why? Because the revelation of Jesus Christ wasn't there with him. It had gone away. It had died. It had passed away. It wasn't present, whatever it was. And so, he went back to saving his own skin was what he did. And just making a general mess of his life because the word wasn't there with him. But remember, he says, he said, "Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. Upon this rock, I'll build my church." the revelation of the word in its season. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. Jesus gave this great revelation, this great promise to Peter that when he got the true revelation of who Christ was personally to him, the gates of hell would not prevail against it. Peter had lots of little failings before that, some big failings, too. But when he comes into the present truth revelation of who Christ is, that's when Peter gets set settled down. He says, "Peter, listen. You're going to get settled and you're going to live in a place where the gates of hell can't can't prevail against you." He says, "Listen, Satan is he's going to try and sift you as wheat." He says, "But I prayed for you." &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you're converted, strengthen your brothers." Peter, there's a time coming. You think you've got it all now. You think you'd go with me to death. You won't. He says, "But listen, there's a revelation coming that'll hold you and hell won't prevail against you anymore. You will conquer it." Amen. That's the undefeable revelation that we have to have. Who is Jesus Christ today? Amen. That's our strength. That's our power. That's our holding uh uh anchor is who Christ is. And that's got to be personal to us. this morning. It's got to be a personal revelation. Peter's revelation was true, but it wasn't personal in him. It was personal outside of him. You are it. You prevail. You have the power. You have the strength. You can hold. Everything was in something outside of him. And so when Christ was gone, Peter didn't have it. Peter believed to a point. Peter preached to a point. Peter confessed to a point. Peter held on to a point. Peter got the victory to a point. But Peter needed something greater so he could go beyond that point and go all the way to total victory. Amen. And it was going to take a personal revelation. Peter needed a a revelation of the prevailing faith of the present Christ in him. Not just a man that was standing before him. Amen. a place where he could know the will of God for him and he could walk with total faith knowing that he would prevail. That's what Peter needed. Jesus was telling Peter and the rest of the true church. Remember, church is not people that gather in a building. Church means called out ones. God called you out of where you were into what he has for you. We are not the church because we go to church. We are the church because he has called us out. Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He says, 'Look, you're in the promise with me. We're all part of the seed. That's what he was trying to get them to see. You're in me and I'm in you. Paul would say this in Ephesians. He says, 'Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places where in Christ. According as he has chosen us where? Who chose? He chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of one thing, his grace, his unmmerited favor. He says, "Wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved." Church, that ought to make a shout this morning to know that he chose us in him Christ before the foundation of the world. We didn't pick it. We didn't choose it. We don't determine it. We don't deserve it. It has nothing to do with us. It is the grace of God. And therefore, what comes out of our lives is to the praise of the glory of one thing and one thing alone, the grace of almighty God. &gt;&gt; That's what we are there where we are this morning. So when Christ but he says we were chosen in him. So when Christ went and Christ overcame if we are in him then where is our position this morning? &gt;&gt; Where are we standing this morning? If it was through him if we were in Christ from before the beginning &gt;&gt; and Christ went and overcame. Then guess who got overcoming when Christ overcame? This guy. This group of people. Amen. When Christ went down to hell and took the keys of death and hell and the grave, guess who got them, too? You and I. Because we were in him before the foundation of the world. So, when we're in him, we get the characteristics. We get the attributes. We get the inheritance. We get the blessings. We get the overcoming power. We get the everpresent mighty God in our midst. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. Amen. Listen to what Paul says again. He says, "If ye be Christs, are you Christs? He says, "Then are you Abraham's seed?" &gt;&gt; And if you're Abraham's seed, then you are heirs according to the promise. What's the promise? You will possess the gates of your enemies. That's the promise. Amen. What is an heir, church? An heir is somebody that receives the the the things the that somebody has already built up and owns. Amen. They It's a transferral of benefits and property. An heir does nothing to deserve what they get. They get it because they are a part of the one that gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you hearing me this morning? You are an heir in Christ by his grace. You didn't deserve it. You can't do anything to deserve it. Don't try and earn your healing. Don't try and earn your forgiveness. Don't try and earn your deliverance, church. You can't earn Jehovah Gyra. He is Jehovah Gyra. You don't earn it. That is just who he is. Amen. And we are heirs of his nature and of his blessing. I say hallelujah this morning. Amen. You can't earn Jehovah Gyra. That is just who and what he is. Let's tie it together as we start to close this morning. He says, he said, 'Abraham, because you've done this, I will bless the nations by you and your seat after you. He says, here you are, sick people, listen. Do we have any sick this morning? And sinner friend of mine, listen to this. He said to the seed, who is Abraham's seed? He says, you who are born of the spirit of God, you take on Abraham's seed and are hes according to the promise. He says, is that right? That's what the Bible said. And he said,"Abraham, because you've done this, I sorry, Abraham, because you made this act, I will bless you and your seed, and your seed shall possess his enemy's gate." He says, "Hallelujah. If sickness is in your road, you're the boss." He says, "Your seed will possess the gate of his enemy." Hallelujah. He says, "When I think that is God's eternal promise, I possess the gate of the enemy." He says, "Hallelujah." He says, "I've got what? a Lord Jesus who died for me. I'm no good. Never was, never will be, and you're not either. But Jesus Christ was God's perfect sacrifice. And through his shed blood and obedience to the father, we can possess any enemy's gate and triumph. He says, "Your seed shall possess the gates of the enemy." He says, "Hallelujah. Through Jesus, I'm safe ever more." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord this morning. Praise the Lord this morning that you can possess the gate of your enemy. I know we've read it twice. We're going to read it again in John 5:4. This is such a beautiful scripture. It encapsulates our entire walk. He says, "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world." And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. It is our new birth that gives us the revelation that we are a part of God. And that gives us faith to overcome. Your new birth gives you faith to overcome. Amen. When God puts his holy spirit inside of you, his own life into our soul. That is the new birth. The new birth is not water baptism. It's not a confession. It's not repentance. The new birth is when you die to yourself and Christ lives inside of you by his spirit and you come out a new creation and you start to grow in Christ and you start to mature in Christ and you start to produce the life of Christ because that's the life that's in you now. It's not the life of mommy and daddy. It's not the life of past decisions and mistakes. It's the life of almighty God that's now coming up through human flesh. Amen. We grow in Christ by the spirit, not by joining church. Remember what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12? By one spirit we're baptized into one body. You can't get into the church. You can't into can't get into Christ by coming here and having a confession. You can't sign a a a church book. We don't have one anyways. But it's by the Holy Spirit entering into your soul and dwelling in human flesh. That's how you are born again. Amen. It's the indwelling spirit of God that makes you a part of the church of God. Listen to what Paul says again. And he says, "And because you are sons, you always were. You always will be. He chose us in him before the foundation of the world. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying, "Aba, Father." The reason you can receive the Holy Ghost is because you always were a child of God. Only sons can receive the spirit of the father. That's it. So when you receive the Holy Spirit, you know why you have to have a revelation that you've been born again? Cuz until you do, you can't go into adoption. You can't grow in Christ. You'll only go so far and then you'll stagnate because you don't know who you are and you don't know who he is truly. [snorts] He says, "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." Now, what happens when he does that, church? Wherefore, thou art no more, no more a servant, but a son. And if a son, then you are an heir of God through Christ. He says, you used to be a servant. You were never a servant, but you thought you were a servant because you were bound. You were under somebody's authority. something else made you do things. You didn't have a choice. Servants don't have choices. They just do what they're told to do. You had no freedom. You didn't know you were a child of God. But when God gave you his spirit, the first revelation that comes is I'm no longer a slave. I'm no longer a servant. I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you realize you're a child, then you realize you've got an inheritance coming your way because all the children of God are heirs of God. You got something that he set aside for you. Amen. It let you know that you didn't have to be bound. You got choices. We're going to get into it as we get into gates. You can be bound if you want to be bound, but you don't have to stay bound this morning. Amen. Are you catching it this morning? What is the prevailing revelation of our victory? It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It's not Christ 2,000 years ago. It's not Christ on a cross. It's not Christ in heaven. It's Christ right here. Amen. It is God telling you, "You are a part of me. You always have been. You always will be. And because my spirit is within you, you do not have to bow down before anyone that tries to take mastery over you. &gt;&gt; You are not a servant. You are not a slave. You are a child of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to bow to anyone this morning, church. &gt;&gt; No power, no influence, no circumstance, no sickness. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do it. Amen. He says, "And because of that, you will prevail &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was in Christ dwells inside of you. And that is a conquering spirit. That is a ruling spirit." Amen. That is a spirit of liberty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it cannot do anything but produce what it produced the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Church, it's already chosen and declared. It's already finished from an eternal standpoint. Amen. You couldn't stop it if you tried. Satan can't stop it though he tries. It's already to determine you shall possess the gate of your enemies. That's the promise of a child of God. That's the promise of a seed of Abraham. Hallelujah. Sickness can't stop it. This world can't stop it. The finances of your life can't stop it. The decree of your parents can't stop it. Your bad decisions you've made can't stop it. You will prevail. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said you would. &gt;&gt; That's all I'm resting on this morning. Not that I can do it, but because he said I will. And all I've got today, this morning, is a revelation. I'm a child of God. And so all that lays before me is prevail. &gt;&gt; Prevail. Prevail. &gt;&gt; That's the cry of my heart. I will not back down. &gt;&gt; Don't give back the ground you've won so hard. &gt;&gt; Hold fast that which thou hast declared. &gt;&gt; Stick with it. Amen. It's already done. Why? Because you came from God. Hallelujah. And you go back to God. Christ said it. And you've got to be able to recognize the same thing. If you were in Christ before the foundation of the world, then you've got to go back to where you came from. &gt;&gt; Origin is destiny. Nothing can stop it. The most frustrating thing for Satan to see is people that won't give up. Because every day brings us closer to total victory. And he knows it. He knows it. Talk about a position of dominion. Talk about a prevailing revelation. You are an expression of God today. Paul says this in Ephesians that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of two things wisdom and revelation. Wisdom is how revelation is what? Wisdom is how to apply the revelation. He says in the knowledge of him he says the eyes of your understanding been enlightened that you may what? Believe, think, presume that you may know. That you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. In other words, Paul's saying, listen, this will go from being a thought or a belief. It'll take you into the reality of the word of God. It'll take you into the reality of the riches of God. It'll take you to the inheritance that he has for you. He says, "And in that you will know what is the exceeding greatness of whose power?" His power according to the working to us word who do what? Believe. What's he asking us to do, church? Believe &gt;&gt; the exceeding greatness. In other words, if you think something is super powerful, take that and what he has is beyond what you can even think. &gt;&gt; Exceeding greatness. Have [snorts] you ever had a I'm sure brother Matt can identify with this. Maybe brother Chad, anybody that's worked on heavy equipment. You ever get to something where you think you're going to need a whole lot of strength and so you get there, maybe you take a big crowbar or something and you just give it everything you got cuz you know it's not going to come off easy and it just goes and you almost kill yourself because this thing pops off in your face or hits your shin or your foot or something like that. You're like, I'm going to have to give this everything I got to get it off and then just it's like it it wasn't even attached. Comes off so easy. That's what it's like when God gets a hold of things. The exceeding greatness. Ever have something I can [snorts] testify of this. You're doing a job and you're trying to use your own power and then you stop and you think there's a tool that they build for this. [laughter] Matt knows this and brother Chad definitely knows this. There's a tool that's built for this. And that tool takes what seems impossible with your own strength and it makes it so easy because it's built for the job. Well, let me tell you this church. God is built for the job. Whatever job you have this morning, whatever the circumstances, whatever the sickness, whatever the hardship, whatever it might be, his exceeding greatness of his power is directed one place, you and I. He says, according to the working of his mighty power. So, where's the power? Is the power up there? No. It's in here. That's where the power rests. It's not a person sitting up in heaven. It's not a man sitting there laying on a cross 2,000 years ago. It is a personal inddwelling of Almighty God in the believer that's working towards us. that's working through us, that's working for our benefit. Amen. He says, "Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places." That was the expression of the full power of God, that he took one that was dead, went down to hell, and brought him all the way back up to heaven again. He says, "Far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also which is to come." That's the position and authority of Christ. That's the power that's given to him. But let's keep going. He says, "And he hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body." Now, we preached on this. I'm not going to preach on it again. But if he's put everything under his feet, and you are the body, which includes the feet, then that puts you in what position? Above all. Not just above all, far above. all principality, power, might, and dominion. That's your position. But you've got to have a revelation that that's where you are. &gt;&gt; That you're a part of the body of Christ. Not that you're a church member, not that you're a faithful tithe payer, not that you're a faithful devotions person, but that you have received the very life of God inside of you. And because of that, you're baptized into his body. Young people, that is the only revelation you need this morning. I'm a child of God and I know it because he's given me his spirit and he's changed my life. He says, which is his body, the fullness of him that fillth all in all. The fullness of Christ is passed down into the entire bride. And together we're the complete expression of Christ. That's your prevailing revelation for your victory. This morning we read the scripture on Wednesday where Paul said, "Listen, I I I've experienced being humiliated. I've experienced abounding and having more than I ever needed, but I've learned in every state that I'm in to be content." &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us to do that. But then he would say these words. He says, "I can do." That word there is the same word avail. It's the same word prevail. Paul's saying, "I prevail. I always prevail over what? All things I can do. I prevail over all things. How? Through Christ which strengthens me. Paul's not speaking of an outside force that comes and goes. Paul's talking about an abiding presence. Amen. When you know that you know that you know he abides that he has called me to him. He has poured himself into me. And because of that I can run through a troop. I can leap over a wall. I can go through sickness. I can go through hardship. I can go through pain. I can go through suffering. And I can go through healing. I can go through provision. I can go through great times. I can go through bad times. It matters not because there's something living on the inside that takes me through. As we sang this morning, something keeps holding me. That's what Paul says. I can prevail over all things. Amen. Paul would go through things that would have crushed a mere mortal. Paul was whipped multiple times. Paul was stoned multiple times. Paul was cast in prison multiple times. He was shipwrecked. He was bitten by a poisonous snake. And nothing killed him. Church, I'm trying to tell you this morning, you are not a mere mortal. You are supernatural beings having a natural experience. Amen. And we wonder sometimes, why is it that these things happen to us? Well, look at what happens at the end and say, why does that happen to me and not everybody else as well? Because not everybody gets at the end what we get, which is I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. In the good times, in the bad times, the up times, the down times, something holds us. Something takes us through. Paul would say this, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that [snorts] he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man." Hallelujah. That's the holding power. He says that Christ might dwell in your hearts by one thing, faith. What is faith? Faith is a revelation of the will of God. Faith is a revelation of who he is today. That's the faith you need for today. He says that ye being rooted and grounded in love. What? That whatever comes my way, he loves me. He says that you may be able to comprehend. That you may grasp. that you would know the reality with all saints. What is the breadth, the length, the depth, and the height? What of this great strength? How far can you go and break that strength? You can't. How far can you go and he's not there? David [snorts] said, "If I if I uh spread the wings, if I go to the wings of the morning, dwell in the depths of the sea, even in the darkness, doesn't matter where I go, you you find me. You're there." He says, "To know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God." Now unto him, catch this. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in one place church &gt;&gt; in us. Can we read that? And I want you to say in me according to the power that workketh in me. Unto him be glory in the church of G Christ Jesus throughout all ages, the world without end. Amen. What gave Peter power to overcome? [snorts] Peter got a revelation of Christ in me. That's what it took. He's never left me. He's never failed me. He's always with me. Didn't matter if they put him in prison. Didn't matter if they beat him. Didn't matter if they pressured him. It didn't matter. He's always with me. He says, "Listen, we can only do what we've been told to do. And we've been told to go preach the gospel, so I'm going to preach the gospel no matter what." And he did. And he did it all the way to his death. Amen. Peter prevailed when he got a revelation of Christ in him. That was a victory that he needed. The scripture says that the priest looked at Peter and John and saw that they were ignorant and unlearned men. But it says, "But they took note that they had been with Jesus." I'm asking you this morning, do people know you've been with Jesus? Do people know you're with Jesus? That he's with you and you're with him. Amen, church. They were the present revelation of Jesus Christ. They were not the Christ, but they were anointed. That's what Christ means, the anointed ones. Christ poured himself into them, and he's done it for you and I. Amen. And through that they were strengthened with might by his spirit to prevail. And that's what they did. I'm going to read [snorts] two quotes as we close. The musicians can come. He says, "On the day of Pentecost, he sent down the Holy Ghost to continue through the Gentiles to take out a seed of promise to give to the Gentiles the offcasts to give to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring them into the promise." What promise? Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. He says, now we have a right to conquer all sickness. We don't have to conquer it. He says it's already conquered. We just have to claim the promise and go take it. He says it's already conquered. Death is conquered. Hell is conquered. Sickness is conquered. Temptation is conquered. All devils are conquered. Death is conquered. The grave is conquered. He says, "We stand in the gate taking it. We don't have to fire a shot. It's already been paid for." Hallelujah. Let's stand together. [snorts] Amen. When you realize he conquered, he possessed the gates, all you have to do is take that key of faith and walk up and say, "This is mine." That's it. It's already conquered. You say, "Brother John, the key isn't turning very easily. It's rusted up by years of lack of use." Maybe it's a key that's been sitting in Newfoundland for a while. I don't care how good your keyholes are here. They get rusted up eventually. But the hand of faith will turn that key and say, "This belongs to me. You can't stay here. You're a conquered enemy." Cuz greater is he that's in me &gt;&gt; than he that's waiting behind those gates. You're a conquer. You're facing a conquered enemy this morning, church. We'll preach on it later, the Lord willing. Amen. But you've got to turn the key. your inheritance. You have an inheritance of everything that he's taken. Every redemptive blessing, every bit of authority that he has is given to the church to produce the word in her season. And all he's waiting for us to do say, "It's mine. I accept it." And then you walk forward and that gate's going to open because the master of all circumstances has the key that opens the gate to your enemy. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you for your encouragement this morning. Lord, thank you for a word that shows us our position, Lord, that we're facing an enemy that does not even control his own vulnerabilities, Lord. That we're facing a defeated enemy, Lord, and that when we receive you into our souls, Lord, by the presence of your Holy Spirit, Lord, we are made more than conquerors, Lord. We're made overcomers, Lord. We've moved beyond the flesh and we moved into the supernatural, Lord, by your dwelling spirit inside of us, Lord. How thankful we are that you did the work, Lord. That you won the victory, Lord. That we're facing a defeated enemy this morning, Lord. And all we have to do is by faith walk forward and accepted, Lord. I pray you help us to hold the ground that we've won, Lord. It was so wonderful hearing the testimonies at prayer service last night, Lord, of many gates that have been opened up and possessed, Lord. But I pray you help us to hold, knowing the enemy always pushes back. Lord, let us hold fast that which we've received. Lord, let us hold to that which we've claimed. Lord, let us hold the gates of our enemies against all comers this morning. Lord, bless your people, Lord. May you just minister in our hearts and souls, Lord. You see the the cry of our hearts, Lord. Lord, you see the travail of our souls this morning, Lord. for lost souls. Lord, for those that are struggling, for those that are weary, Lord, for those that are overwhelmed by the enemy, Lord, we pray that your spirit would raise up a standard in souls and lives this morning, Lord God. Lord, let us be overcomers, Lord. Let us intercede for others, Lord. Let us not hold this just to ourselves, Lord, but may we offer it to everyone that has need this morning, Lord God. Lord, as we stand together in faith, Lord, claiming, Lord, possession of the enemy's gates. Lord, when we wake up tomorrow morning, Lord, may you remind us we're a child of God. Lord, when the enemy comes in, may we stand up and say, "I'm a child of God." Lord, not because of anything we've done, but because you chose us and you've ordained us to possess the gates of our enemies, Lord God. Lord, what a wonderful place you you've given us. Lord, help us not leave it, Lord, rusted by lack of use, Lord. Let us not forget, Lord. Let us not live below, Lord, our privileges that you've won so hard for us this morning, Lord. But let us stand in faith, Lord, claiming every promise this morning, Lord. We ask these things this morning, committing this congregation to you. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. [snorts] No longer a slave to fear. 12:19. [snorts] You have covered me with a meloy and you [singing] surround me [music] with a song of deliverance. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. from my eneies [music] till all my fears have gone and I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am [singing] a child of God. And I'm no longer a slave to fear.

[music] You split the sea so [singing] I could [music] walk right through it. My fears [music and singing] were drowned in perfect love. [music] You rescued me so [singing] I can stand and say, "Oh, I am a child of God." And I'm [singing] no longer a slave [music] to fear. Oh, I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no [singing and music] longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am [singing] a child of God. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. 7:22 [snorts] Jehovah [singing] Gyra, [music] you're my pro.

So I got down on my knees and I said, "Lord, if you please." I got up, singing, and shouting, "The victory." Oh, victory is mine. [music] Victory is mine. Victory today is mine. Oh, I told Satan to get me high. Victory today is mine. Joy is mine. Oh, joy [singing] is mine. Joy is mine. Joy [music] today is mine. [singing] Oh, [music] Satan to get [singing] behind.

I've got a note here that says all the offices and officers have been voted in as we're on the ballot. So, we thank the Lord for that. God bless you for your faithful service. God be with us each one as we continue to serve him. Amen. I'm sorry I didn't preach too long this morning. Can we sing one more song before we give it over to brother Mark? I want to sing Bloodbot Church again. Amen. I feel like we only save that for the special meetings, but we need to remind ourselves we are brought with a price and that price gave us victory. Amen. So, I want to sing this this morning as we finish up. Brother Mark, you can come and give the the financial update for the for the last year. If you would do that and then we'll be closed. Amen. You don't have to stay for this if you don't want to churches. Technically, you can go whenever you want, I guess, really. But, uh, we'll I won't pray after this. We've already prayed. We'll sing this. Brother Mark can come up. If you don't want to see the finances, by all means, you can go out and fellowship and and do whatever you want. But, God bless you. God be with you as you head out for this week. Remember, Brother Garfield, especially as he ministers that God would just use them in a wonderful, powerful way once again to speak to the church. Amen. Let's sing this before brother Mark comes. They shall lift up their voice. They shall sing [singing and music] for joy. They shall shout loud and be free. They shall glorify [music and singing] the name of the Lord. And it's the blood of the church. The redee are in that army [singing and music] of the Lord.

Every created people. [music] There's a new song [music and singing] with a brand new melody. It's the church. [music] Oh, we [singing] are in the army of the Lord.

They shall cry [music and singing] around and be free. And they shall glorify [singing] the name [music] of the Lord. It's a prophet. Oh, we are [music and singing] in that army of the Lord.
