that name if we'd take that name lord if we do what that man that had that name told us to do heavenly father and so lord we're coming in this morning lord and we're saying the name of jesus over our lives lord first personally lord that that name will be written over the door of our hearts that everything that goes in and goes out will be in your name lord that we could attach your name to it lord and that you wouldn't reject it heavenly father lord and in doing so lord that you would come and you would do what you said to those that take on that name of mrs jesus christ lord that you would heal that you would deliver that you would strengthen that you would encourage lord that you would correct us to align with your word lord that you would show us your way in your path that you would draw us closer to you lord and away from this world lord we pray that that name would have the preeminence here this morning lord as many are missing lord we pray that you will be above their homes and in their lives and hearts lord that you administer to each one listening online we pray lord god lord touch us this morning we pray lord there's many needs many requests lord so many things i don't know may you just touch each one we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen god bless you thank you musicians turn the scriptures if you would to first corinthians 7. first corinthians 7 it's certainly good to be back in church seems like we haven't been here in quite some time so it's uh it's good to be back amen i i was going back and forth with brother gerald he said to remember him in prayer he's still not a hundred percent so we definitely want to remember him also the special meetings coming up next week amen uh brother ed hammermeister and i have been talking quite a bit and he was able to change his tickets with no cost which was a huge um grace from god for sure because when you do a last-minute change within one week usually they really ding you but anyways they were able to get that done so certainly remember them in prayer that god will keep them safe as they come amen they're of course they're vaccinating these things and they've had covet in their church before but we want them to have a safe trip so they can come here and they can minister to us and by god's grace we can minister to them as well amen it's a two-way street amen so just keep those meetings in prayer and the ones that are coming amen first corinthians 7 verse 32 says but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife amen god bless you you may be seated this morning lord willing we're going to take the last chapter the last service on the series on thy kingdom come and while we're closing out this chapter on the sisters we're going to be touching on the brothers of course a little bit this morning but i want to touch on the single sisters especially this morning as we get into this but you know this has been a bit of an odd series perhaps and maybe in some ways it would be considered legalistic because what we've been talking about is our conduct amen we haven't been talking about the mysteries we haven't been talking about general doctrine we haven't been talking about a message that came and opened up the scriptures to us in a particular way but what we've done is we've dug into our lives and the way that we act and conduct ourselves day to day and i was listening to brother ron spencer last week when we didn't have service and and in the service he was talking about that message where brother branham preached on the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and we all we talk about the future home and that's where we want to be and that's where we plan on going and that's where believers you know imagine themselves but he says have you ever noticed how brother branham spends the first 45 minutes of future home doing what talking about our conduct talking about the life of the believer he says you've got to be justified you've got to be sanctified you've got to be filled with the holy ghost you have to be separated from the things of the world you have to be a part of your church community any and he goes in for 45 minutes before he ever touches on future home to talk about the condition of the people that are going to that future home amen so what we've been doing for these last 17 and and for this final 18th service is talking about what the conduct of the people that are going to that future home because we can sit here all day and we can say god sent a message but if that message hasn't changed our lives and changed our conduct then it is a message that does not have power in our lives and it does us no good amen it was uh i was listening to brother cadry diggs this morning he used a scripture where where jesus was talking to the to the jews and the pharisees and and he said the word is there to set you free and and they said we are abraham's seed we've never been in bondage right they thought because of their lineage because of their family name because of the way they were raised that they were never in bondage and yet they were in the greatest bondage because they could not see the very messiah that was standing before them but they thought because they've been raised in the right circles that they had the right doctrine or so they thought that that made them okay and he's standing in front of them amen the word of life and flesh standing in front of them and they can't even recognize him why because they're in bondage and it's no different to if you're raised in them in a message home in a family home i say god bless thus that we were able to do that but that is not what gets you into the future home amen that is not what marries you to christ is being raised in the right family and having the right doctrine or being able to repeat the right doctrine back to us amen but it is to have a life of christ living within you a life has changed and brother kadri when i was listening to him he said the reason i know this message is true is because i'm not the cadre digs i used to be not because i know the seven seals are opened or not because i know the son of man ministry or who the son of perdition is or the truth on marriage and divorce or godhead or these different things but because my life has been changed i mean that's what makes the message real is that our lives have been changed so this this series has been on has your life been changed or if it hasn't been changed in certain areas when the word comes over the pulpit and touches your ears will you allow it to change you or will you sit back and rest on the laurels of i'm a message believer amen because you need the word to set you free and so it's so easy to sit there and say i believe all the doctrines because the doctrines require nothing of our life it requires nothing of change it requires nothing of humility it requires us not to do anything except amen but when the word comes forth and it says your life is supposed to look like this as a believer now there is no bla it's black and white you either are or you aren't and you have to line up and say i'm not sometimes amen i think i've heard from almost everybody in this church that said that was a tough one for me brother why because we sat there and we looked in the word and we said guess what i still have some work to do right i still have areas where i'm not in alignment and it's not always because we refuse to sometimes it's because it hasn't been preached we haven't heard a service recently we haven't heard a message recently that reminds us oh wait we've got to live a certain way in certain areas of our life right and so all this is is a stirring up your pure minds by way of remembrance that we can't just sit here and say i'm going in a rapture because i've accepted the message of malachi 4. but i'm going in a rapture because the life of the rapture is within me amen and that's what we're looking for this morning so i want to take as a final title for this series on that kingdom come of a life of purpose and then a life of purpose and we're closing out on the sisters we'll touch on the brothers a little bit but we look at the men in this church and we look at the men around the world and we're not all created the same are we we have men with different gifts different intellects different uh purposes in life we have men with different muscular strength intellectual strength ministerial strength as the case may be and we don't all live our lives the same way but we all live them according to the word if we're a true believer and it's no different with the sisters amen we covered the men in that series here on christ like men and christ like young men but then we focused on the sisters and so much as focused on the married sisters because that's where the word has focused most that's the type of the bride but we also see that there is a life calling for singleness and it is a life of singleness with purpose and we're not just talking about singleness today because everything we do is supposed to have a word purpose it's supposed to have a kingdom purpose we aren't just living here and going to work and making a living and providing for a home and this and that just for no no good reason but we're doing it for a kingdom purpose and we'll get into what that is amen but i wanted to talk to maybe the younger ones this morning the ones that are coming up the ones that are single the one the young sisters especially but even the young brothers to say hey there is a decision that you're going to make and it's a decision made prayerfully and it's will i get married or will i live a life of singleness because guess what god calls some people to singleness and we'll see it in scriptures but you've got to be able to live a glorious life whether you're married or whether you're unmarried for the purpose in the kingdom of god amen now we read in the opening scripture that paul draws a line of distinction between those that are married and those are unmarried he says i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord and how he may please the lord now that word unmarried we think there means somebody that has never been married but he's talking to the men right now and in the in the in the old language they didn't have the word widower because back then you've got to remember if a man was unmarried it meant that he could have been divorced or he had not been married and said either way in most cases the man was allowed to remarry because the jews had messed up the divorce decree so much that basically if a man divorced he could go and marry a woman no matter what remember but the word of life comes forth in jesus and he corrects them and says hey there's only one way that a man is allowed to be remarried and it's for cause of fornication but they had so many things that they would they would basically say a man that's unmarried he was not a widower and he was not divorced because that had no bearing on it if he was not married he was automatically eligible to be remarried that's the way they were teaching it back then but then he says that there is what there is a widow and we'll get into that in the next scripture amen but the jews have gotten so far off the mark on a marriage and divorce that they didn't even have a word for a man that was divorced it was only a woman that's crazy that's crazy that they took it and it was out of the hardness of their hearts that moses gave it in the first place and that hardness took them to a place where marriage and divorce was never supposed to go it's it's interesting i've heard it preached on jesus said it was not so from the beginning and you know why he said it was not so from the beginning because the very first cause was fornication wasn't it and yet what did adam do he took her quickly to himself and what preserved her life so that she would not be put away that's why he said it was not so in the beginning because it didn't matter what happened there was always supposed to stay together and the example was supposed to do it but paul says this he says i say therefore to the unmarried and widows unmarried and widows widows are women that have lost their husbands but for the men he calls them unmarried he says it is good for them if they abide even as i am now we don't know if paul was married or not but the argument's been made that to be a pharisee of pharisees like he was you had to be married you couldn't make that as a single person and certainly when we see paul's wisdom when it comes to marriage you would think that that is a man that had experienced marriage before amen but he says no matter what he says if you're unmarried if you're divorced if you've lost your wife or if you've lost your husband he says it's good for you to abide even as i so the presumption there is that paul has what lost a wife and so he's saying after i lost my wife i never sought to be remarried again i stayed in singleness because he says it's better off to do it right so what single people have a lot of energy paul had a lot of energy they have a lot of time available to them and paul says if you can stay in singleness and preserve yourself in singleness then you can do great things for the kingdom of god it says but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife and in the amplified it says but the married man is anxious about worldly matters how he may please his wife and he's drawn in diverging directions in other words his interests are divided he's distracted from his devotion of god to god so us men will know that and our women and the sisters will know that as well when you get married then you are distracted from the purpose of god in terms of you are not in singleness of purpose to seek god only and the things of god because why you've got a spouse now you've got a household you've got a home you've got children and these family and these things and so that's going to be something that pulls away your energy and your attention and that's the way it is paul doesn't say it's wrong he just says you've got to realize when this happens that guess what that prayer life that you had as a single person you may not have as a married person that you don't have that free time you don't have that energy you can't go out on missions trips you can't work in the local community in the same way because your first ministry is always to your home and to your spouse in the first place but if you're unmarried you've got this ability to go and do great things if you have holy ghost leadership because otherwise you'll do great harm to the kingdom because you'll be out there running around like a chicken with its head cut off thinking that you're doing the will of god and it's nowhere near close to it right but i was sharing with the brother the other day about how god had to whip me into into place before i could ever be called to the ministry because if i did if i went into the ministry five years earlier than i did then i would have made a big mess of it because it would have caused resentment in my home and all probability it would have put more distance between my wife and i and it would have caused destruction in my own family home even while i was out there trying to benefit the kingdom of god right because god has to build something and he always builds it on a strong foundation and for a man especially if the home foundation is crumbling broken or weak in any way god cannot build on that because it will fail every time but the word has to be the the home has to be built on the word and in doing so he'll turn the wife into a benefit for the man as opposed to him a hindrance to her because now my wife is a benefit to my ministry she's the greatest supporter i have and i don't know what i would do without her amen i love her and i respect her and i appreciate her for what she adds to my ministry because she adds a great deal of stability a great deal of support she loves it she appreciates it she feeds off of it she isn't she isn't mad she isn't angry when i take time away from the family and whatnot because there's a security in our relationship now but without that she'd be in all probabilities sitting there and getting frustrated and being annoyed that i've had i've had to yet again put the family aside for the sake of the ministry right so god always anchors our home life first for us men before he'll move us into something else right so there's no point in pressing into a new opportunity if my home life's out of whack right but once i got my act together and once god whipped me into shape then he said okay now you're ready to do it right it's not that i wasn't called before then it's at the time was never ready for and he didn't make that call apparent until my life was squared up right so before we take more on our plate we've got to make sure our house is in order because our first ministry is to our home and our first care and consideration is always to the home but then paul switches over to the sisters he says there's a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman cares for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married cares for the things of the world how she may please her husband in the in the amplified says he's drawn into virgin directions it says in the unmarried woman or girl is concerned and anxious about the matters of the lord how to be wholly separated and set apart in body and in spirit and the married woman has her care centered in earthly affairs how she may please her husband remember the scripture says that the wife acts towards her husband as unto the lord it is a reflection of her relationship with god how she treats her husband amen so she's supposed to treat him in the same manner she would treat god without him having necessarily the value or characteristics of god if us men were to be honest right but that's the that's the trial for the women isn't it no sisters are saying amen this morning silence is consent is that what we're going with amen but paul doesn't say again that the woman focusing on her husband is wrong he's just saying that's the way it is so don't expect anything different right so he says look the unmarried woman she's focused on the things of god or she ought to be focused on the things of god but the married woman she's focused on her husband because her worship to god is reflected through how she treats her husband in these different things then he moves on he says in this i speak for your own prophet not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction the amplified makes this much easier to understand he says now i say this for your own welfare and profit not to put a halter of restraint upon you but to promote what is seemly and in good order and to secure your undistracted and undivided devotion to the lord so paul says look you've got to know what's going to happen when you get married and you've also got to know what it's like to be single because i don't want you bound down and get in there and then realize oh my goodness this is not what i was looking for you've got to realize things are going to change and you've got to be ready for that change there right so life's different i i can guarantee you the singles amongst us don't realize how different it's going to be once you get married but the marriages know very well things change as soon as you bring a spouse into the home amen you don't have freedom right you've got to set yourself aside for men selfish thoughts have to leave the door as soon as that wife walks in the door selfishness has to leave very very quickly because otherwise it won't work and for that woman as soon as she comes in then submission has to start right away in obedience regardless of whether he's worthy of it or not that's a big change amen unselfish men and submissive women from day one right but what we find is that they're both supposed to they get it up front but the idea is that you earn it to the place where you actually deserve it not just get it amen because we stand in the place and if us men stand in the place where we say you must obey me and submit to me and we're not worthy of it then there's a problem in the home and we need a correction right i i read a somebody shared it with me and i'll probably mess it up but it said something like a submissive wife is the door to allowing god to correct a husband right because if she's trying to do all of that then god has no place but if she can stay humble and quiet before then he's put into the hands of a living god sometimes i'd rather my wife corrected me if i were to be honest i think it's listen god god doesn't mess around amen and when you're in a position of leadership god isn't going to let you get away with it amen he's going to push you to the point where you give in or he'll break you right and often it'll be publicly unfortunately and we see that breaking we see that falling away very briefly and then they realize oh my goodness i really messed up and then they come back and they humble themselves and god can do something with them then now he comes back to the singles he says nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart having no necessity but has power over his own will and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin virgin he means virginity doeth well so the amplified says but whoever is firmly established in his heart strong in mind and purpose not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity he's doing well so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage do it better he's saying fathers if you give your daughter a marriage that's good but he says if you allow her to be single in purposeness to god that's even better he says the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she's at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord in other words she can only marry another believer of course but she is happier if she so abide she stays unmarried after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god so the big question is for those that are are unmarried what path is god going to lead you down because you're not guaranteed to get married in this life are you right you don't get married just because you get the opportunity you get married because you're called to it and you have holy ghost leadership for it amen if you're married god's already told you what your plan is okay it's to stay married right he's not calling you to leave it amen but we start with the married women and we we see that they've got a kingdom purpose in their marriage amen and you've got to find value in what you're doing if you can't find value in what you're doing you're going to resent be married the rest of your life amen and it's because so often it's not exactly easy to step into it like i said the day you get married your whole life changes your whole purpose changes the way your energy is focused your freedom changes as a wife right because you don't have it now your husband is your head it changes from your father to your husband and so you don't have this ability to do it and now it's not about making yourself look good it's about making your husband look good according to his purpose and vision amen so the woman's purpose has to change now and you've got to get in alignment with what the word says and that's to get in alignment with your husband and in that you're going to have no doubt children and you'll have a family and you'll have a household in these different things but now your purpose is to get an alignment with a plan of a of the head that's over you which is your husband amen and your support and his success is your success and if he's honest he'll give you credit for it i've always said with us with with blanca and myself because we got married so young even while i was in school everything we have today is because of both of us it's not because of me i didn't go get a degree and get a job and then bring her into it but everything we have is because she's been there to support me all along the way and so we take equal equal credit for that success amen in terms of working together to get what we have but when it comes to the married women of course we go back to proverbs 31 i looked it up and i preached on this if you wanted to to see it in depth again go listen to that message on the divine relationship it's october 18 2020. but i just want to cup on a touch i'll touch on a couple of elements here in proverbs 31 and it says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above ruby's the heart of her husband does safely trust in her this is the effect of a virtuous woman the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life so this is the life of a virtuous woman always good never evil and the effect of it is that her husband does safely trust in her so we talked about before how god's relationship with us is based on him trusting us we have to trust him and he has to trust us and based on that trust we get authority in our life and so we look here and we see in proverbs 31 that we're going to see a woman that has great authority in her life we're going to see a wife and a mother that has great authority but look at the first thing it starts with she's of great value and look at the very first thing it says her husband safely trusts in her so the question to the wives is does your husband safely trust in you because if he doesn't then you're not going to have great authority and you're going to have struggles and trials in your marriage because you haven't earned that trust with him but i'll flip it back on the brothers and say brothers does your wife trust you in the first place because she's got to trust you in order to follow you willingly willingly do it she'll do it out of obedience to the word but to willingly do that she's got to what trust you by a reality based on the life decisions that you've made so far we earn it by a track record not one decision not one day not one great day with the family not one great day with the wife not one great day with the spouse but it's a lifetime of decisions that give us the track record to where we're proven to her that we are worthy of her trust amen but then we see the flip side is that when he trusts her he gives her great authority in in proverbs 31 amen it safely trusts her in other words his trust is not misguided right he doesn't wake up every morning to a new surprise and a new oopsie or a new mess he's got to clean up or a new situation he's got to resolve because his wife got into trouble but he safely trusts in her than that his trust is not misguided to her and she does him good and not evil every time she's working for the household amen so the question to the sisters then is again can your husband trust you like that can us brothers say my wife does me good and not evil every day now chances are we can't because our wives are as human as we are right but it's the general progression towards good and not the evil amen that's what we're looking for isn't it amen we saw before that the women's trust is a different struggle amen they i i'm so glad i'm not a woman let me put it that way i'm so glad i'm not a woman because the struggle is real amen you're working with fallen men and even holy ghost-filled men are still fallen in their carnal nature amen and you're going to have to fight that and they have to fight it every day but we saw on first peter 3 6 it said even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now that with any amazement it says and you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you so yours is a walk of great trust and if we were to think very honestly and maybe carnally about abraham and sarah abraham did not have the greatest track record with his wife how many times did abraham give his wife to another man right sisters if your man gave you to another man would you trust him yet the scripture says she didn't get hysterical over it even in the even in the palace of the king she didn't get hysterical he didn't do right but she never got hysterical she trusted god was going to sort it out because the child had to come through her right she trusted that god was going to work the situation out amen so what sometimes the situation is very dire and our tendency is to get what hysterical to get angry to get frustrated disappointed as the case may be but says don't do it don't give in to that sit back and just let god work it out but don't be surprised if your man takes a hit if your husband takes a hit because if he's off he's going to get hit he's got to god's got to bring him back in line amen but this is a life where you've got to walk in trust when the situation calls for anything but it right that's what you lady that's what you sisters are called to is when trust is not even warranted yet you're supposed to trust because again you're looking to the god behind the husband not just the husband there amen and that's the key to the authority that you're going to get and then it's a two-way street oftentimes i think if i were honest that us men are asking the women to trust us a loss a lot more than we're trusting them and as we get older and as we get deeper into our relationships we should start to reciprocate that trust to the sisters to give them authority and to give them what the ability to have a greater effect in our lives and in our families and these different things now that we're virtuous it means strength or strong mighty efficient wealthy and army army so a woman that is virtuous she comes with a lot doesn't she this is not some so some you know princing prancing you know sit on the throne and look pretty type of woman this is a woman that comes with tools this is a woman that comes with a heart to work this is a woman that comes with with a an attitude of getting things done and getting things done well and getting them done efficiently men she's found that position of authority in in proverbs 31 and because he's trusting her he has no qualms and giving her free reign in the household and and this proverbs 31 woman is a woman of wealth and she's in a house of wealth we see that she has employees she has servants she has property she has a big house she has financial resources she makes investments all with her husband's full authority it doesn't say that he's coming and checking her every day what did you do what you do what you do but he's letting her run with it because she's gained his trust and it's implied that she's guiding his trust by her previous track record right she's proven that as he's given her authority she hasn't abused it but she's used it for his purpose amen so it says in the amplified it says a capable intelligent and virtuous woman who is he who can find her she is far more precious than jewels and her value is far above rubies or pearls the trick is to see it before it's ever there isn't it you know that miners when they're going and looking they know what a material looks like even when it's covered in something else and then when we marry somebody when a woman chooses to accept a proposal from a man when a man proposes to a woman oftentimes what she really is is not fully clear is it you're only seeing a glimpse of it right if you were to go look at rock when it's mined it is not you do not tend to find gold all just in big pieces do you you find little elements of it blended in with something else and what happens is you have to break it open to really see what's inside if you were to go find a piece of jade in australia you know they have this beautiful jade and when you look at that it's buried in another rock it's not polished it's not beautiful and all they see often is just a little piece of that sliver of jade they say wow there's something in here then they cut it open and they realize there's something in here that's great but there are other pieces that are what they're fakes not fakes but there's nothing in there it's a fake promise is really what it is you think there's something there they open it up and it's just crumbly rock there's no jade inside of it so as believers when we're looking for a spouse what are we looking for we're looking for something that's a diamond in the rough we believe the diamond's in there but it's not yet apparent what it is and that's why we need holy ghost leadership that's why we need to pray about these things that's why god gives us holy ghost-filled parents to help us to maybe see what's deeper inside that person than we can see ourselves because so often we marry potential and potential doesn't always play out says the heart of her husband trusts in her confidently and relies on her and believes in her securely so that he has no lack of honest gain or need of dishonest spoil in other words he doesn't go need to do something he ought not to be doing in order to provide for the family he doesn't have to make up for her wastage or for her taking the money and and and the values of the family and using it for her gain amen so what the woman is not called to drive a man to the point where he's working at all hours to provide for the family a man's not here to make a lifestyle for a woman amen what happens is god gives a man and a wife to each other and whatever he makes she's supposed to live within the limits of that amen what she comforts encourages and does him only good as long as there is life within her that's the that's the purpose of a of a god-filled woman amen so if we look at ourselves as the bride is this what god can say we're doing for his kingdom that we're confident he's confident that we're doing good all the days of our lives when we preached on this way back when remember we went through proverbs 31 and we talked to the to the women and the sisters and then we came right back and we talked to everybody as the bride of christ to say what are we doing with our time and with our energy and with our gifts and what god's given us and the idea here is that everything that we do is for the good of the kingdom amen because we put the burden on the sisters here because we're reading proverbs 31 but really it's a burden that we all share as members of the bride of christ is that we're doing things for his kingdom and for nothing else amen proverbs 12 4 says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed as rottenness in his bones now you see she's a crown to her husband a crown to her husband that's a wonderful thing she's a crowning she's a crowning achievement she's something that brings glory to him but it says a bad one is is as rottenness in his bones now i don't look at that rottenness in his bones as a bad thing because if if she's good then she's the opposite of rottenness she's a support she's a strength what are the bones the skeleton it's the structure of your body it provides a massive amount of support and if you don't have good bones then your body's not going to be able to handle very much is it but a woman that is that is a virtuous woman she's not his rottenness she's had strength to his bones if we can put it that way it's a bad one that's rottnest but a good one is his strength to a man to a husband a man she brings something to him she adds to him in a way and she makes him stronger and better than he was before he ever came into contact with her right she encourages him i need encouragement as a husband amen i might do 10 things that my wife thinks are wrong but if she encourages me on the one thing i do right i'm a whole lot more open to the things that she thinks i do wrong why because we thrive on encouragement we don't thrive on correction amen and i've noticed with god that he always encourages before he corrects right if we won't accept correction then it always gets a little tougher but he always gives us encouragement and what is that encouragement is he gives us a way to get there right he doesn't just tell us what's wrong but he gives us a way to get to where we need to be correction without a a way to be restored is from satan right but if he can restore us back then we'll take the correction because we know he's made a path back for where we need to go amen that's why we fellowship as believers we don't fellowship just to to to to rub each other off and and and to clean each other up but we encourage each other amen we we encourage ourselves remember what what the scripture says that we're supposed to get together we're supposed to sing songs we're supposed to give testimonies we're supposed to do these things to do what build up the the church amen to build up the body and to encourage each other a long life's path but when we drop into proverbs 31 and we see how much authority this wife has you'll see that it's tied to how she uses it she doesn't just have authority but she has it for a particular purpose it says she seeketh woolen flax and worketh willingly with her hand she's like the merchant ships she bringeth food from afar she rises riseth also while it is yet night and giveth me to her household in a portion to her maidens she consider at the field and buyeth it and with the fruit of her hand she planted the vineyard so in other words you see that she is not given authority for ease of life or luxury or comfort but she takes that authority and she's using that authority she's using it to do what to work to develop the household to do good things to provide for her family that authority is given with a purpose and it's for the benefit of the home it is not there to give her beautiful clothes it is not there to make her look pretty to preserve her youthful body none of these things but rather she's doing it for the benefit of the home that she is in amen she's using her authority to clothe and feed the company her family and her household she's getting up early in the morning for one purpose and that is to do what to prepare meat for those that are going to be working that day amen she has employees she buys a field and she develops it this is a woman with tremendous authority and we look here and we see what she's doing with it and again she's not doing it to make herself look good but she's doing it to raise up everybody that's around her amen let me stop and talk about money for a second because some of us don't make as much as others do we so let me talk to the ones that make less if god has given you less money in this world you know what he's given you brothers he's given you a wife that can stretch a dollar to make it do the work or two now sisters if you're married to a man that makes less than perhaps you would like then guess what god has given you to him so that you can do that exact work so that you can go out you can find the deals you can make two one do the work of two so you don't sit here and complain and say buddy you need to get a better job buddy you need to get a better job work harder work more so that i can have this that and the other no god gives you to that man so that you can make do with what he provides for that family and believe me i've seen it i mean when mom and dad got divorced you talk about having to stretch a dollar mom had to stretch it to make three do the work of three but yet she did it right nearly killed her but she did it right god makes a way to provide but we're not here to provide a lifestyle for our wives we're here to provide for them in the way that god has given us a means to do it amen and then for those that make more because get what we always have those that make more and we always have those that make less and god never promised that we'd make more right so some of us are going to have to deal with that as well but to the ones that do make more what does god do he gives your wife the ability to not have to spend her time so much thinking about how much she's spending and what she's supposed to do then she's supposed to take that and be more generous to others to help out others to use that extra time to use that extra energy to use that extra money as the case may be to help those that have less amen so what is it we're not given a bunch of extra money to make our lives easy either we're there to benefit the body and the kingdom of god each and every one of us says she lays her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the disc staff and she stretches out her hand to the poor yeah she reaches forth her hands to the needy there you see she's got a ton of money but she's not just holding it to the household is she she's reaching out to those that are in need she's using her authority to help others it doesn't say that she goes and asks her husband can i help says she just goes and does it because what she's got the trust of her husband that she's not going to put the household finances in in distress by helping somebody else amen but she's not just looking to herself now but she's looking to those outside and we see this in this own church don't we somebody will drop by a meal right when a sister has a baby what happens we all try and do what bring meals to come over maybe help clean the house or guess what somebody's in the middle of a trial or somebody's struggling or you see that sometimes you don't see anything and what is what happens sisters the holy ghost will say drop a meal off right how many here can say they've had a meal out of the blue didn't call didn't ask anybody did they but guess what we give as well we can't always be on the receiving end but we give it as well but how many times somebody will drop by and say hey i brought a meal over for you so you can take a break right what is it it's the holy spirit moving to share with the others that are in the church to help them out amen i'm thankful we have that what is it sometimes they what offer to come over watch your kids so you can have an evening note right a couple needs to get out sometimes get away from the kids and just kind of love on each other a bit and tell each other how much you care about each other and sort through different issues and kind of just relax a bit get out of the groove get out of the rut of of raising a family and just remember that you're married and you love each other remember right hey listen when you're in the grind right when finances are tight maybe when health is bothering a different one when when things just aren't going so great you still have to love each other don't you and you have to remind each other that you that you love each other says she maketh find linen and sell with it and deliver girdles unto the merchant strength and honor of her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness so wisdom is what makes a woman like this talk a proverbs 31 opens her mouth only with wisdom it's not gossip it's not opinion but it's wisdom and wisdom is what knowledge with experience added to it not just knowledge we get into trouble when we start spewing knowledge okay i'm a witness of that personally when you start talking about something because you you've read a book or you've heard it from your prof or whatever and you don't actually have the experience behind it you get into trouble every single time but she does this it's a careful measured discussion that's always seasons with one other thing and that's kindness right the law of kindness is what is in her tongue amen that's what this woman talks like amen it's the hardest thing i think for a ministry sometimes is when you're correcting what are you trying to do you're trying to bring the wisdom of the word to a situation but it always has to be done with one intent and that is with kindness and to restore somebody back to where they need to be she looketh well to the ways of her household and either not the bread of idleness her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he prays with her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised now listen to this brothers give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates amen this is the effect of the scriptures on a woman's life when she's giving back and then the scripture says why husbands give back to her what she's given to them you know what happens so often is that the woman does all the work and the men receive all the blessings and we hold it to ourselves but it says you're not supposed to do that you're supposed to give her back what she's given you so when tax return season comes in what happens us men sit there say my tax return my money i'm going to do what i'm going to do with it according to scripture you take some of the tax return money and you'd say honey here's something for you to use because you've worked hard to make sure that the finances are in order in the house so i'm going to give you back some of what you saved now so that you can use it for what you feel you need in the household i was talking to my wife about this this is where it came from blanca was i'm reading this and i said listen i've been looking at this and this for myself but how about this year we let you do it you tell me what you want to spend the money on and so we're buying a whole new house no no but the thing is this guess what i don't value shades and side tables but she does you know why because when people come to our house and they have nowhere to put their coffee cup and then it gets knocked over and then it spills on the rug and whatnot what's she doing she's saying we need better things here so we can support people that come to our house and host people so that's what she's looking at i'm not looking at that i'm looking at things for the shed and tools and vehicle lifts and motorcycles right that's what i care about not in every way but i what i'm saying is what i get the money and i say what can i get for me scripture says no no no you got to give some back to her you got to let her what the scripture says don't muzzle the ox of treads the corn your wife's sitting there and she's busting her hump day in and day out and we won't give him a penny because we're the man and we make the money right that's not the way it's supposed to be we're supposed to be giving back to our wives letting them have a say in what these do and not not always give the majority to us how about one time we give the majority to them amen we'll go out we'll spend 10 15 grand on a toy for us and we won't spend 500 for something that she wants for the house got to give something back to her amen we're blessed to have the wives that we have i think we need to treat them like they're the blessing that we believe they are amen but you see this woman this proverbs 31 woman there is no idleness in this woman this is a woman that's working from mourning to dusk from the time before the light comes up till after the light goes down this woman is working working working now i'm not saying sisters that's what you have to do i'm saying that's what this woman does okay but it's not a life of vitalness you know we were talking the other day and and the scripture says that a woman will be saved in childbearing if she if they continue in the faith this is what that saving looks like is that she's got no time idleness what is it idol hands or devils playground right this is what helps keep you out of trouble listen if a man sits at home all day and he doesn't work you know what he gets into trouble every single time he'll get into trouble because he's got nothing good to do this is what's good to do for a woman if she's married this is where you can't let idleness creep in that man's got to get up and go to work every single day whether he likes it or not right that's what he's called to do is provide for the family whether he's enjoying it or not it has nothing to do with it he's got to do it and the same thing is for the women is that you do have a a work to do and it's right here and this is your life of purpose is not being idle but what developing that household and gaining the trust of your husband so that he gives you more and more and more so that you can do more and more and more for the household's sake brother braham says this now this is to the married women he says a woman's place is at home with her children now when she now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different but a woman's place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right proverbs 31 that's what all we see is a woman that's working out of her home now guess what she runs a home-based business out of her home doesn't she right she makes investments out of her home she goes out of the home to make deals with merchants and ships and all these different things but her focus is in the home and so if you're married that's where your focus has to be and you can never convince me out of the scriptures or the message that a married woman should be out working in the workforce unless it's absolutely necessary and the minute it isn't necessary she should get out of there as soon as she can right you'll never pull that through the scripture unless it's out of necessity or as we'll see if she's working with her husband and that would be again out of necessity her husband's using her out of necessity for that we see that in in uh priscilla and aquila you know when they're making tents right they were making tents that was their work and she worked with them with him and the the presumptions they didn't have kids or anything it was a you know a couple without children so they work together and that sort of thing but the purpose of the life's purpose for a woman that's married is that she stays in her place and she helps to develop that home amen now listen this doesn't all come any more naturally than it does for a man to get up every morning whether he wants to or not whether it's a horrible day you know if you're on the tools like brother matt and you're called to go out and work outside and it's howling and you know newfoundland it's always windy except this morning right the weather's rarely great do you think that brother matt wants to go out every morning that he's called out to do that of course not matt's not sitting there reveling in the in the pain and suffering of the cold and wind and sleet and rain right but he does it anyways and it's no more fun to go sit at a desk all day either some days you're happy to do it some days you're not but guess what we do it because we're called to do it not because it's fun or entertaining or we get enjoyment out of it there is a benefit to it and there's a satisfaction that comes with it but it's not all fun and games it's the same for our sisters because guess what it's not all fun and games to get up and have to clean a house every day it's not fun and games to get up and have to make a meal every day and try and be interesting and try and be pretty for your husband and try and keep the kids from embarrassing you in front of people and you know it's it's not easy it's not easy it is a life's work listen we're developing careers as men you're developing a career as a wife and as a as a mother and you've got to develop into it and you've got to grow into it you've got to learn and you've got to what realize that it's not always fun and games and you're going to struggle with it at times amen but what about the single women now i think we preached enough on the married women what about the single women paul said they're focused on the things of god how to be holy in god in body and spirit that's the purpose of a single woman now in matthew 19 jesus is speaking he says but i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except to be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry now i had to laugh at this because the disciples were thinking hey we're men we get married and it goes south and it doesn't work out we just divorce her and go get another one but now jesus says you don't have that freedom brothers you're not supposed to do it except for one reason and they say well if that's the case we better not risk getting married at all why would a man risk it we see so many unhappy marriages everybody's getting out of them why would we risk an unhappy marriage because why divorce was rampant because they thought that they could divorce for any reason so the disciples are saying well if we can't get out of a bad marriage then why would we ever get into it and jesus comes behind and he says he said unto them all men cannot receive the same save they to whom it's given in other words this saying is what they've just said to him he says it's not given for everybody not everybody can do what i what you've just said and that is stay single right he says for there are some that are eunuchs which were so born from their mother's womb and there are some eunuchs which are made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it so that word eunuch in a mixed crowd means a man that cannot father a child okay so he's incapable of producing life so jesus lays out three types and the first one is people that are born that way so you could be born with a deformity you could be born with a hormonal defect a physical defect of some kind and he says you don't have a choice if you're that kind of eunuch you're born that way and you're you'll always be that way the second one were those that were made unix of men so there was surgical there was a surgical procedure that they do for male servants especially those that were in and around women to make sure they didn't mess around with the women right and then the third one but let me stop there because there's some that are made eunuchs of men and we don't have that today because we don't have slaves and we certainly don't don't do those type of procedures but we do have eunuchs that are made of men by circumstance and you'll see that even if i could speak of my own mother and that's that what she's bound to be unmarried by life circumstance amen her husband divorced her she's not allowed to remarry so my mother is a eunuch in terms of she is separated from from producing life by life circumstances and that is by what men not of god that's of men and so you have men the same way i know a brother in the united states and and him and his wife are divorced and everybody has told him brother you can remarry and he says i don't feel to remarry right he has been made eunuch by life circumstance and he believes that the the cause of their divorce is not one that would allow him to remarry and so what it's of it's of men that it's happened right so we still have this today it's just not by a surgical procedure but it's by circumstances in life but then there's a third one that that he says and it's people that have committed themselves to a life of singleness now committing yourself to a life of singleness is not i'm going to be single because i can't find somebody to marry me or somebody to marry it's people that have made a conscious decision there's a calling in their life and they've said for the sake of the kingdom of god i will not be married i'm going to hold myself back amen and jesus said they're a special type because he says you have to be able to receive that one right and in first corinthians 7 37 in in the amplified it says whoever is firmly established in his heart we read this earlier strong in mind and purpose not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire and resolve this in his heart to keep his own virginity he's doing well so paul and jesus both are saying you got to be able to control yourself you can't pretend about this one because a man that does that does that says he's this and he can't control the lust or the desires of his flesh is going to get into real problems real fast right and it's no different with a woman they're just less prone to it so he says if you're going to do this you better make sure that you've got control over it don't go around pretending and it's okay to to start that path and then say i i can't deal with this right because remember paul said hey if you can't control it's better for you to marry right so don't sit there and pretend you're controlling it and then you got lost running through your life all the time amen you've got a besetting sin going on there he says you got to be able to control it and it's of your own it's control over your own body's will amen amen that's for the men and the women both it's speaking of amen there but remember it was addressing the the unmarried women as well but if we're looking at our single sisters what does that singleness with purpose look like now and the love the beautiful thing about this is that we have types for both of these the the major ones in scripture and in acts 16 it says there was a certain woman named lydia a cellar of purple of the city of thy torah which worshiped god that heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended under the things which were spoken of paul guess what lydia had a conversion here she wasn't a believer she was an unbeliever she's in there she's she's got her own business she's a wealthy woman and she hears the message from paul and she has a conversion and that she what starts to live what paul was telling her about right she had the real deal but watch what she does it says she was baptized and her household and she basada saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrains us so lydia is wealthy enough to have not only a home but a large home with servants and employees and big enough to host the disciples so she's a wealthy woman amen and look at what she does as soon as she gets that now she's a single woman as far as we know now the thing is she's uh that roman was in control of thyatira at that time and so the belief is that she was probably divorced so a divorced woman relatively wealthy has this big home has this big business and everything so she did not start a business as a believer but she was an entrepreneur now as soon as she comes to the message can i put it that way paul doesn't go to her and say now lydia women aren't supposed to be in the workplace you need to sell your business and you need to stay at home does he why because lydia is using what god has blessed her with now for the furtherance of the kingdom the first thing she does is she constrained them do you remember when they walked on the road to emmaus with jesus and at the end of the road what did they do they constrained him that meant they gave him no option to continue but they said you will come in and eat with us that's what she said to paul you will use my home as a place for outreach it'll be a center for you while you're here when you're in thyatira you're staying with me and i'm going to use it for what the glory of the kingdom of god they didn't go and say lydia you're a single woman you shouldn't have a place in the church like this no no no what'd they do they said we'll gladly use what god has blessed you with for that purpose they never corrected her they never said you're not allowed to be in business right you're supposed to be in headship unders no no no they let her continue as she was as long as she used it for the glory of god so we don't see in the word where it says a woman can't work but it does tell us where the woman the married women should be and that's in the house right but beyond that now we get an example of a woman that's working and they never tell her she can't do it as long as she's using it for the glory of the kingdom of god amen so single sisters if you're out there working we have no single sisters here except the very young ones relatively young ones but maybe they're listening online but single sisters if you're out there's working there's nothing to say you shouldn't do it in the scriptures jethro had his daughters working at the well if you'll remember right we have priscilla making tents with her husband we have lydia here running her own business there's nothing that says you're not allowed to work brother brown never forbids it for them either right why because there's no scripture to say that you can't do it but the scripture gives you a lot of other things you should be doing as well and you just can't be be ignoring those things amen but the same thing goes for young men we're talking to the sisters this morning but young men and men we're not just out there to make a bunch of money now if you're a young man and you're believing you're going to get married then what are you doing you're saving your money for a home you're saving your money for a wedding you're saving your money for a vehicle you're saving your money to prepare to have a household but at the same time you have lots of energy and you have lots of time and the question is what are you doing with that time are you using it to constrain people to come and do something for the kingdom of god are you constraining yourself to do something for the kingdom of god are you sitting at home playing games having a great time of it right we spoke of phoebe last service also a single woman presumably i'm married we don't really know and what does she do she puts everything she's got into administration of the church to help them out to the point where paul sends her on a business trip to go and help other churches out and says when you when she gets there you do whatever she asks you to do why because she committed her life to the kingdom purpose amen now we see another single woman that was focused on being a witness in our local community because listen as we spoke in the last service sisters are not called to teach or preach you'll never find it in scripture you'll never find in scripture they're not a part of the fivefold ministry but that doesn't mean you're not called to present the gospel amen we're all supposed to be presenting the gospel but there's a way to do it and if we look in acts 9 it says now there was that joppa a certain disciple named tabitha a disciple she's called a disciple not just peter james and john disciples but there's a woman now that's called a disciple that's somebody that has committed their life to serving the kingdom of god which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almost these which she did she's full of them this wasn't a part-time job this was a full-time gig for her amen this was her focus and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber and for as much as little was not a joplin the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then peter arose and went with them and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by weeping and showing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them so dorcas was spending all of her time money and efforts to do what outreach simple outreach what going to the needy going to the the ones that didn't have clothes maybe didn't have food and her life was spent to support that ministry now maybe she had to work a day job i i don't imagine she got all of this stuff for free maybe she was working a day job and then what did she do take that home and she went and used that money to help people that had less than she did and so when they when she finally dies we got a bunch of these people gathered around her saying look at what she did for the local body amen how many of us could say that that when we die people would stand around and say look at what they did for the local body right this is a single woman this is what this is the standard the gold standard in scripture i would say for a single for a single person is that everybody's standing around saying what a great loss it was that that this woman has died because look at how much good she did and peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive what a beautiful scene how many people get raised from the dead in the scripture and yet this is a young single woman that gets raised from the dead wasn't ministers that got raised from the dead right it wasn't it wasn't great deacons or or big shot men but it was a a single woman that had dedicated her life to the widows and to the needy and and the ones that needed clothes that's the one that peter raised from the dead right that tells you how important a single sister can be in the local body is that peter would call a disciple would come the one that was that spoke on the day of pentecost would be called over and he would raise her from the dead because god says she's still needed for the kingdom that's an amazing effect to have as a single person isn't it that you could be there and people would say we need her we need to raise her from the dead that's how important she is to this amen why how cause she lived a life right she didn't talk she did she acted she had a ministry but what was it it was showing the loving care of christ to those that were in need that's something that any of us could do really but each one of these sisters found purpose in their situation lydia wasn't you know uh because when paul comes paul's going to bring marriage and divorce isn't he now lydia as a roman she could remarry they were not they were not forbidden to to to remarry as a roman you know under roman rule and these different things women were absolutely allowed to remarry but she didn't and she couldn't now under this but we don't see her sitting there saying oh what was me i can't remarry what she embraced her position she embraced what god had put her into the situation and she found purpose in it for the kingdom of god so the single sisters are you forbidden to study at university no scripture doesn't say you can't do it are you forbidden to work in the workforce no amen but the question is and this goes for men and women alike what are you using those things to achieve every time it comes back to motive and objective listen if i went to school for engineering so that i could make hundreds of thousands of dollars and become a big shot then guess what my motive is wrong and same thing for a sister if you're going in there to make a bunch of money and make a big name and a big career for yourself then guess what you're off the word but so is a man so is a man for doing the same thing amen we're supposed to be singing seeking our kingdom purpose and those things amen are we looking to become independent and free thinkers are we looking to break the mold because if that's the case you're off the word that's not what god's going to bless in your life you can go there and get straight a's and get a great job that doesn't mean god's blessed you that just means that you're getting what you want out of it right right sunny skies are not proof of god's blessing any more than cloudy days or proof of his of his disapproval amen but if you're going to university if you're going to school for a kingdom purpose and god leads you to do it then do it embrace it i always wish i kind of did school the way joe did because he embraced it i i kept myself as far apart from it as i could and i was a witness of sorts because they saw that i kept myself away from it but i never got to really have conversations with people the way joe did i think if i would have embraced it a little more as the will of god then i might have had a greater impact on it on the people around me amen but what as a woman especially if you can go into those situations if you can keep a straight head on right if you can if you can maintain your conduct if you can be a witness in a testimony then i say god be with you because again the scripture doesn't forbid it but you better make sure that god's calling you to it because how many men and women alike have i seen go into the halls of university as a believer and come out an unbeliever you got to know what you are you got to know what you believe and if you're going in there with any shadows of doubt then your best to stay away from it amen listen you can have an opportunity to testify when they're talking about female empowerment and feminism and all these things you can speak up and say guess what look at the damage it's done and you can talk about the things that we we see and we hear and we preach about over this pope but the damage that the world has seen because they put women into the workforce and destroy motherhood brother braham said when they did that they broke the back of the nation right and we're seeing it today but they wouldn't see that right you can still be a testimony you can still be a testimony in those places amen listen you can go start your own business and be like lydia right and you can be one that that takes what god gives you and maybe you help somebody else maybe you're not a dorcas maybe you can give money to a dorcas to help do that you know we can't all be missionaries but we can give money to missionaries every day right there are there are men that have committed their lives and then you've got jason demars out there and he's a full-time missionary that's all he does guess what you got money you want to send send it to jason to mars right you've got evangelists that are traveling the globe traveling the country day in and day out they would love to have money if you can't go do it support somebody that would i mean you don't always have to be the minister sometimes we're most times we're there to support them and we'll get into it a little bit as we move through this amen i know sisters in the message that have become both doctors or nurses takes a long time to become a doctor minimum seven years typically it's eight and then a lot of times you got another two years on top of that and what did they do they didn't go into it for the big bucks they went into it because every year they take a month off they take all of their vacation and they go over someplace else usually with the minister and they go out and they have special meetings and they go and they do a medical mission to help the people over there the believers and the unbelievers alike over in third world countries and whatnot so they can do what testify of the caring nature of christ and then they've got ministers there to preach and they've got men and women that are in the health care side of things to do what help care for the natural sides of people's lives amen but never forget you can do so much just with a simple life at home listen dorcas didn't have some big ministry you know she didn't have a warehouse full of people with sewing machines going day in and day out day in and day out but what one by one she helped change people's lives just with a simple act of kindness just with a coat just with a meal something like that a single brother a single sister i hey when i moved here and and we had to make that move at the last second you know and and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to get the boxes in that i called brothers up and within an hour we had everybody young and old that could make it and we moved me and it was no big deal right it's the same thing with young sisters guess what you've got the ability to call up a married sister that's frazzled out of her mind and say hey do you need me to come watch your kids so you can go to a spa for a day and and tame your frizzled hair and actually eat a nice meal with your husband that you don't have to cook in these things amen you don't always have to be out there doing some great big ministry so often it's the simple things that are going to get you across the line and men that are going to build up the character in your life that are going to draw you into the body i mean it's not it's not looking out there our first look is always inward should always be to our own family and then to those that are out of the local household of faith and then to the global as well and man we've got plenty to do here and i guarantee you if you don't know something to do talk to a sister and she'll tell you hey so-and-so could use some help hey there's no there's no lack of needs amongst us amen everybody could use a a helping hand i think but i want to close with a bit of an odd quote because this kind of wraps up this entire series because we've talked about boundaries we've talked about purpose we've talked about staying in your place we've talked about trusting the word of god about acting about conduct that is according to the word and somebody shared this quote with me kind of in in general form at the end of the last service and i went home and i looked it up and i thought it was a great way to end all of this for men and women alike because we stalked in the last service how women are not supposed to preach or teach and they're forbidden to handle the word and we saw the issues that happened when eve handled the word of god amen but this brother reminded me that guess what men are not called to do that either as in if you're not called to do it then you shouldn't be doing it amen that if you're not a part of the fivefold ministry you should not be out there preaching and teaching and trying to handle the word of god and he pointed me to this quote this is a quote where brother branham talks about uzziah now uzziah was one of the greatest kings of israel when it comes to war and things of war because uzziah was a great engineer and the scripture says that he made great engines he made great uh inventions war inventions that kept anybody from coming after israel and what happened is that he became very strong nobody would touch him and the scripture says when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction because uzziah had kind of you know reached his plateau as a king and so he said well i'm going to step into another role now and this is what he did he said there we want to he said brother braham says this is where we want to lessen now he's talking about uzziah uzziah went in and he tried to take over the priesthood role he tried to burn incense in the temple he says there's where we want to lessen now if this man which god had blessed in his capacity but he wasn't satisfied with that he wanted to take somebody else's place uzziah was a tremendous king and they were being they were benefiting and they were being blessed under his kingship but he says he wasn't satisfied he wanted to go take somebody else's place as congressman upshaw said you you can't be nothing that you ain't so that's about true you've got to stay in your calling where god called you to now as long as he remained king he was a blessing to the people being a king but when he thought he was a minister then he thought because god had blessed him he could be anything he wanted to be but he was the blessing to the people as a king but not a blessing he became a curse upon them when he tried to take the minister's place and we have a lot of that he says everybody wants to pack the ball see he's talking about football now when you're playing a ball game as it's football season the thing we want to do is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it he's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal see now you imagine okay you know they snapped the football goes to the quarterback and he hands it to the running back running back his name is running and he's back that means he's the guy who's supposed to run with the ball guess what a receiver is not supposed to run with the ball he's supposed to receive the ball right a tackle is supposed to do what tackle right running back is the guy supposed to run with the ball but he's saying you give the ball to the running back and then as he's going by and you're on his team if you try and take the ball from him you're not going to score if you say i want to be the one that gets the touchdown you're not going to score because a kingdom divided against itself can't stand right so he says you're not supposed to be trying to score you're supposed to be trying to let the teammate that has the ball score so don't try and take the ball don't try and pretend you're the running back when you're not the running back protect the running back so he can score he says but you could imagine a team so untrained as to find one man their own man with the ball running to the field goal and then has tried to instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your old man that's got the ball take off with it and every man trying to take the ball out of his hand why you're bound to lose can you imagine in hockey maybe we understand hockey a little better if your teammates got the puck and you keep trying to take your puck away from the teammates so you can go score the goal you'll never score the goal right but if you can help protect him get in a place where he can pass it to you whatever you're going to score goals aren't you but you can't keep trying to take the puck away he says today we have the same thing when we see god come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's use our influences as tackles not runners tackles that protects the runner lets him pack the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is keep running can you imagine a football player that is so well protected that nobody can lay a hand on him that's the goal isn't it is that as soon as they snap that ball and give it to him all the tackles hit and they create an open path where he can slip through the line without ever being touched and he can break all the way through to the end zone can you imagine you're not allowed to do it in hockey because it'd be interference but if you basically went ahead of the guy with the puck and just started knocking everybody down his way so that he never had to do anything and just go in and shoot on the goalie and score maybe knock the goalie down as well right not allowed to do it but can you imagine how easy it would be if everybody was focused on letting the one man carry that puck or that ball rather than trying to do it themselves because he says there's one man that's ordained to do it don't try and be that man if you're not him right but look look what he says he says let's use our influences as tackles because so often what we want to do is use our influence to do something he's saying let your influence clear the way for the gospel not do something else not do something for your ministry don't try and have your ministry going on while the other ministry's there let that ministry protect that ministry is what he's saying right when you got a man carrying the ball don't say well i've got a ball too no you block for the man that's got the ball he says we should all be tackles all of us tackles if you're not in the ministry don't try and be in the ministry protect the ministry let them carry the ball he says i speak worldwide you know for the full gospel businessmen around the world organizing chapters not long ago when i believe i was at kingston jamaica when they had castro and all them there at this meeting or we had been down to this place that's the way it was and the celebrity of all through the island was up there and those businessmen was trying to preach the gospel so brother i'm speaking by experience now he says he's out of his place we preachers have a hard enough time to keep it level and they use every little influence they can find and every little technique this way and that way and keeps it so scrupled up you don't know what to do now he says what influences and techniques can i say it this way tools what is it you think that because you have a new technique you have a new tool that that means that you're ordained to carry it guess what that's not the way this works amen when it comes to spreading the gospel there's a five-fold ministry that is anointed for this purpose and they alone are anointed to do it i don't care if you're online i don't care if you're doing podcasts i don't care if you're on youtube whatever it might be that is not the way to spread the gospel if you're not a minister a minister spreads the gospel brother brown makes no bones about it he says that and he says what when you do it he says preachers have a hard enough time keeping things straight he says so don't you try because you definitely won't do it because when you do you get things so scrupled up what you do you cause a bigger mess the thing to do is protect this message the way it's going stay right with it and knock everything away from it if we're ever going to cross the goal line all right and i said brethren there's something wrong you fellows are businessmen the first place you don't understand the approach you don't understand the approach to the ministry because the ministry is a god called gift god has said in the church first apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors god set them in there for the perfecting of the church okay you're on dangerous ground but listen to this because he brings it right to every one of us businessmen should testify woman housewife no matter if you're the maid in somebody's house testify do everything you can for the kingdom but don't ever inject your own ideas i.e i'm a minister just say what the message says and keep going on c and then maybe you have some influence but don't try to preach now until god you know calls you so how do you know you're called to preach you have a pulpit he says it's five full ministry alone preaches so if you don't have a pulpit somewhere then you're not supposed to be preaching that's what he's saying you're not supposed to be handling the word and by that i mean if you're not out there ministering the gospel to people actively as a calling then you should never do it you don't start one day and turn it off the next day it's either you're it or you're not it amen what does he say businessmen testify women testify house wives testify tell what god has done for you tell what god has done for you don't try and go tr preach serpent seed and and godhead and all these things that's not meant for you but you can tell what god did for you and that's the greatest impact you'll ever have is a life change that's what brother cadre diggs was talking about he said the message changed me and that's why i can testify and that's why i preach the way i do is because i got a life change and i testify of the life change first and foremost he says don't try and preach now until god calls you just stay right with that your testimony because if you don't you'll get off in the wrong category and then you'll mess up everything that's it and it doesn't please god at all this is malachi 4 saint this isn't me right don't get out there and try and preach if you're not a minister so the qualifications mean you are called to it and you are a man and you are welcome in a pulpit somewhere that's the easy way if you don't meet any of those qualifications don't do it he says this proves it here when this king now when he was rebuked and told the truth by the minister of the building and tried to tell him he was wrong that god called that for only aaron's descendants to do it and they were consecrated to that service only that's all they were to do they were consecrated for that and a king no matter how righteous he was or how much god had blessed him he had no right to burn incense he was taking the priest's place and he should not do it and when he was rebuked he got roth his temper flew up and right while his temper flew up leprosy appeared in his face he broke out with leprosy and then he dropped the sensor and ran out of the building see trying to impersonate somebody else we shouldn't do that in his anger he done wrong and he was smitten oh it was certainly a lesson to this to this young prophet to see no matter how great the man was he had to abide in his calling amen we're talking about places we're talking about men's roles we're talking about women's roles we're talking about single men married men single women married women we're talking about ministry all of these different things you've got to be able to stay in your place you've got to be where god called you amen think of the woman at the well i think it's my favorite story in the bible because there's so much in there there is so much in there there's redemption there's predestination but i want you to point to what he talks about when he says go out there and testify you're a woman testify don't preach the woman at the well she had just met the messiah she had placed him in the scripture and she had an experience that lined up with the word of god okay if there was ever a time to preach that was the time why look at the last time that they look at the time that the church had that in the day of pentecost what happened as soon as they had a word experience they went out and they preached and what did peter do he brought 3 000 souls to christ right so listen if this happened to peter peter probably would have went and preached but what did the woman at the well do she's met the messiah he's discerned the thoughts and infants of the heart she's received it she's placed him as the messiah in the scripture and she runs into the town does she go into the town square set up a chair and start preaching to them opening up the scriptures pointing to her experience pointing to what the scriptures say and sharing everything that that he lined up with no what does it do john 4 the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city and say it to the men now watch does she preach teach quote scriptures no she said come see a man which told me all the things that ever i did is not this the christ what'd she do she testified of her experience and all she did was ask the question isn't this the messiah she didn't say this is the messiah she said isn't this the messiah she asked them a question and what did she do she pointed them back to the man that gave her that experience she pointed them back to christ she didn't point to herself she said come listen to him she didn't say listen to me right she didn't say listen to me she said come listen to him it said and they went out of the city and came unto him so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and they said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the savior of the world she didn't sway them with her words she didn't convert them with her words what she did she bought them to one that could convert them right all she did was she pointed to a minister and she said go listen to the minister i'm not going to tell you anything i'll tell you the effect of that minister but you go listen to him and see if you can agree with me and listen it says what many more believe because of his word they came to the source they went to one that was anointed to change their lives one that was anointed to draw them to him right not to a woman drew them to the word she pointed to the word and let the word do the work in them amen but what started it her testimony without her testimony there was nothing you know what so often the problem is is we preach the word because we lack a testimony because anybody can anybody can sit here and point to doctrines and mysteries and and truths that have been revealed and all these different things but the harder thing is to talk about a testimony because that's something we need to have on a weekly basis right maybe daily i i'd certainly like to have a daily testimony but you know what every week we ought to be experiencing god if i could put it that way we ought to be able to tell somebody this is what i've been praying about this is what i've been dealing with this is how i was feeling this is who i was and this is the way it is today praise the lord amen i was so blessed when brother bob sent that prayer request for for sister beverly's uh uh grandson right jack and guess what the next day he's fine why i believe it's because we prayed i'm simple enough to believe we prayed it happened i would go testify of that if somebody says what's going on your church i say we prayed for a young man and he was a he was doing horribly he's been horribly before we prayed and the next day he was good amen right that's a testimony that's what i want to tell people about is is what the life of christ moving not just the doctrine of christ it's easy to focus on the doctrine but where's the life because that's what we're supposed to be is the life of it amen but abraham says now we find out though a good man blessed of god if god blesses you you stay in the category that god has called you in if it's a housewife remain a housewife if it's in business remain in that business reflecting god reflecting god doesn't mean you can't be a witness but do it by reflecting god and whatever god has called you to let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that would want to be a good housewife right how many times do you go out and you see these housewives and they're done up to the nines and their kids are horrible and their relationships are horrible and they're in a god forsaken marriage and they'll see our sisters here and they're happy and they're content in their simple little life what do they see they see somebody there that's got something they don't have and it can be a witness to them that there is more to this than just living the life that they have right he says if you're a good businessman let your life so be that it will reflect jesus christ in your business with integrity honesty and integrity and with things that really mean something right because what happens is when you get into business sometimes you get into fights don't you you get into issues with customers you get into issues with clients and guess what a believer is going to say be able to say this doesn't matter enough for me to fight about it i'll let you have it i'll pay the price i'll let you have the benefit of a doubt it'll go against my books not against your books what because you're a believer and you're not trusting in that client or that customer you're trusting in god and all you care about is am i witnessing and testifying of the goodness of god in this business in this business he says why because somebody is watching your life not listening to your words watching your life you're influencing somebody god has to have a real housewife god has to have a real teenager in school god has to have a real minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you christ no matter what the rest of the world has got to do that has not one thing to do with you or i don't get caught up in what's going on in around the world don't get caught up in what people are caught up in we are responsible to god for our lives and for our experience with christ now we find out that it is trying to take the minister's place uzziah and someone telling him he's out of his place telling him he shouldn't do it he's out of place he became angered angered he was so angered till his face turned red see we must be able to sit and take correction some of them won't do it i went to meetings and i've sit in auditoriums and you get up and some people come in and sit down just a few minutes if you say one word they don't agree with they're gone see flying up amen we need to stay in our god ordained positions the musicians would come amen amen god gives us a place to stay and he protects us there he blesses us there as long as we'll stay in that position amen it's never about capability it's never about capability if it's about capability most of us would never be qualified amen but what does he do is he grows us and he changes us and he puts us into that place until we can what manifest christ amen where out of nothing comes something right we're out of a life that that you know the way we used to live the the the selfishness of our life the the inward looking all the time the the the pride you know the the seeking the things of the world the chasing the almighty dollar you know focus more on our reputation than the reality of god in our lives and these different things he can take all of that take all of that if we'll stay in our place amen when we don't think because we're good that means we get to do something else sometimes he just wants you to stay good where you're at right there's not always a next step right you're not always called to a next thing sometimes you're there just to be an example of maybe not perfection but christ-like nature in the place that you're at there's not always a next step right a man doesn't automatically once he once he is as amazing as a father and as a husband automatically step into another ministry sometimes your ministry is to help another ministry and that's ir is a help but sometimes he will sometimes he'll take you and he'll say okay there's a next step there's a next opportunity but it's not always that way and i think that's a danger so often as we'll sit there and we feel like we've reached where we need to reach and we say there's got to be something more there isn't always something more sometimes it's helping somebody else get to be that something more you know to step up into it amen you know we read the scriptures where it said the aged sisters teach the younger ones right you're there sister maureen sister brenda sister betty these different ones they're there to now do what pass on what they've learned the older brothers to pass on their wisdom to pass on their strength to calm things down when us young men get younger men i'm no longer young when us younger men we tend to move quickly don't we and what do they do they slow our role a bit they teach us to wait on the lord don't be in such a hurry you know to teach us how to love our wives to show us what that means that continuity that consistency to get our wives to the place where they can trust us not just because they have to but because they want to amend if we can just stay where god has put us amen for brothers we're called to be christ-like and that is always first loving loving is always the first thing for christ what did paul say he says husbands love your wives his first command was not provide it was love and then we've got to love them and that love is always first sacrificial and then after that where providers we're protectors amen and we're gracious when we do it for sisters you're called to be like the spotless bride of christ and that first thing is always obedient and submissive and then after that it's committed in working to support the vision of the headship that you're under amen let's stand together if we would i want to read one last quote he says look it's coming to a place friend where the world is so awful it's going to make you prove every inch of ground you stand on satan's going to do it and it's coming to a time where impersonations and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised from the real true body of christ and he's going to have a body that's pure and holy and filled with his spirit walking in his spirit and doing the works that he did he says be faithful to that why because the world's got a they've got a fast food recipe for everything right a great meal is not made quickly right if you want to put flavor into something you don't just dump a bunch of stuff on it's got to soak it's got to marinate in these different things right if you want to do something that's going to last it takes a while to build it right quality doesn't come quickly right and this is the long road this is a long haul for believers amen and it what the the temptation for us is going to be that the world offers us a quick return a quick change a quick effect it's not the way he says be faithful to that what walking in the spirit putting in the time he says they want something real they're hungry and thirsting to find the real thing they don't want psychology they don't want some intellectual speech they want something that gives them the assurance something that makes this bible live again amen thy kingdom come let it live in me right isn't that what we want living in me i don't i don't want to be a talker i want to be a walker i want to be a liver not a liver organ somebody that lives amen somebody that's alive somebody's got the holy spirit moving in my life daily to where maybe i would shut my mouth more and live a little more in that time amen amen we need grace we need grace for each other we need grace for ourselves sometimes you look in the mirror and you say i should be further ahead than where i am but guess what this is all in god's hands they will preach on it soon the redemptive process has nothing to do with the redeemed it's the redeemer that does all the work amen we don't sit here we can't sit here and say well i'm not this and i'm not that because the redemptive process is in his time and his season and he's the one that's doing that work amen the idea is to stay with it stay with the word amen trust the word let god move in our lives to the place where you can say he's got a body here on earth and i'm a part of it because the holy spirit is working in me amen god help us to believe him enough to let him change us to let us stand still when things don't seem to be working to have patience to just let him put that work all the way through to the end amen to where we see christ in us not just him seeing us because it says we'll see ourselves he's not just going to see it but we'll see exactly what he's done in us amen amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord the conclusion to this long series lord and i know it's been a great challenge for me personally lord and i feel if anyone feels targeted lord lord that if anybody feels it was focused on them lord that they realize that it's your holy spirit moving heavenly father lord there's many things i don't know about there are some things i do know about but lord i believe each one of us has had our lives touched lord where we need correction where we need to come up a little higher lord sometimes

eyes lord that we be focused on the prize lord we don't want to be like that woman that was wearing those high heels she started to walk there and the prophet said you can't do it she said yes i can watch me and she walked further and further down and it wasn't that the the path looked like it narrowed but it narrowed lord lord we want to let your word take effect on us from the very beginning lord that we can stay in tune with you lord that our lives could just be lord drawn ever closer to you lord that this world could be circumcised the way we pray lord minister to our lives and hearts lord may we just be pleasing to you lord that's what we seek is to be pleasing to you lord that your word would live in our lives and our homes and our marriages and our jobs lord that people would
