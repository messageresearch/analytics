to you but Lord we're know we're in a battle we're in a in a fight Lord Lord and it's a fight for our surrender Lord for our will for self Lord that we could lay it aside that you would have the preeminence in our lives Lord God lord we're speaking of you again this evening Lord and as we open this word Lord I pray that it would just anchor our hearts and souls in you Lord that we would take another step closer to glory Lord that we would take another step away from this world that we'd take another step away from those things that hold us back Lord that we'd walk into a new victory this evening Heavenly Father Lord I pray you would settle Souls tonight Lord secure [Music] us Lord for when the battle rages we've got to know who we are Lord and we have to know who you are in US Lord I pray you speak again tonight touch your people we pray Lord for those that aren't here Lord we pray your grace to them Lord that you minister to them also in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 16 amen God bless you each one amen John chapter 16 very familiar scripture we've been reading from here for a little bit now and we're going to kind of pick up and take this forward tonight John 16:13 says how be it he when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but what's whatever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen God bless you you can have your seats and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost taking a third service on really the question how do I know I have received the Holy Spirit and last service I believe we've anchored that the constant evidence of the holy spirit in a believer's life is is what Jesus declared here and it's that you would know you would come into all the truth the holy spirit will lead you into the truth and so the evidence of the Holy spirit in in our life is when we have heard the word we have received the word we have we have applied the word and now at the end the big picture is you become one with the word that's really what we're talking about amen it's it's not that we have become one necessarily today we don't see the full evidence of it I believe we are if you've been sealed by the Holy Spirit you and Christ are one but now he's got to bring the rest of this into subjection and that's really the revealing of the word in flesh once more but it's for the word of our day it's not just the word in general people don't understand that so much today in in the nominal Christian World they just look at the Bible as the Bible but the simple fact is Noah's message isn't our message Moses message isn't our message it's there for admonition for correction for teaching and training and Doctrine and all these things but remember the word is the thoughts of God it's the plan of God it's the purpose of God and so we can find there's a place in scripture that's specifically for us amen it's for this age it's for this season it's for this church not this church body it's the the Church of of Christ the body of Christ the bride and so we have to find our place and step into that fulfillment because you'll find in the word as we go along and I'm sure you know this already there's parts of the word that other churches can't do other ages couldn't do it it was there they could read it they could have even a comprehension of it but yet they couldn't produce that word in their life why because it wasn't the time and season for it but now is the time and season we're in the the final age we're in the final portion of the Gentile dispensation of the plan of God for this time for this people and so everything that he's written about this church is going to be fulfilled in us that's where you're sitting tonight as you are sitting at the Apex your back to the restored full word it says in the in Revelation he says I am Alpha and Omega I'm the beginning and the end I was in that first church age and now I'm in the last Church age in my full revealing and it's in a bride each time it's in a it's in a body of Believers it's in the called out ones the church so we know the evidence is receiving the word for your day but now the question becomes and this is this is the way things can work every question kind of develops another question so you say well how do I know if I've truly received the word well that's what we're going to talk about today amen we're going to look at that but this is one of those things where it's kind of like when our kids come to us as they get older and they say how do I know that I'm in love and what is the answer you always give you'll know when you know and this is kind of one of those things but I don't think that that's going to satisfy our young people as they're looking forward perhaps the to having a spouse and moving into marriage life and these sorts of things they they want to say but yeah Mom Dad come on you got to be able to give me some sort of something that'll help me to understand well one thing I want to say is this is that it's the same thing that you have in your walk with Christ and that it will be a revelation it'll be a revelation that cannot be given to you somebody if somebody convinces you that you are in love then somebody will convince you that you're not in love and the thing is if you're not settled in your heart on these things that as you move into marriage what will happen is times will get tough that person will be less lovable and that's when your revelation of your love is going to be tested because when they are unlovable do you still love them when they're grumpy when they're rude when they gain weight when their when their their attitude changes when hard times come when sickness hits do you still love them when they get frustrated do you still love them that's going to be when it's tested and so as you need that same Revelation for your marriage so you need one for God you've got to have a revelation that God has sealed your soul that you have received Christ inside of you and that you are on your way you are sealed to the day of your Redemption and now you're in a journey that will take you into eternity with him that's what you have to settle and I'll tell you this that revelation of your love for your spouse you know I Blan and I were talking about this a while back but what happens is as you get further in you realize that God has made you and God has brought you to a person for purpose and things you didn't know were going to be needed are there when you need them and things you thought you needed are going to disappear As you move further and further into your relationship with God and so you'll see this is very much the same with our walk with God I know I keep saying that but when your new birth comes and you receive the holy spirit it's just the start of the journey and so you cannot walk into it thinking that you're going to be just like our elders that have been serving the lord for 90 years it doesn't work that way you get the Holy Spirit but you're not a mature believer because you have received the Holy Spirit that's not the way that it works amen so don't young people set you up for an expectation young men don't think that you're going to act like brother Gerald or brother Mark or brother Bob or Brother David because now you have the Holy Spirit you won't you might have areas of your life that God will quickly work on that will bring you to a very quick maturity CU it's needful but there are other areas where you may still be a child for 15 20 30 40 years why because it's a journey and this journey is to develop our character and our nature to reflect that of Christ watch what go what watch what Paul would say to the Corinthians he says for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many so I want you to see something here The only commonality between you and your brothers and sisters is the spirit you are completely different than I am and I am completely different than you are and you are different from each other but there's one thing that binds us together and it's the new birth it's the spirit of Christ in you that's why we can have somebody that comes from Africa from India from China wherever it is and if they have that same Spirit then we are one and if they don't have that same Spirit it doesn't matter how good their Doctrine is how good they talk how nicely they act how well they dress how much they match up they will not be a part of the body because the spirit's not there but in that we can have comfort that we're different we don't need two of me in this church we need one cuz I won't get along with myself but I can get along with brother M because he's different than me and God has placed us into that body by that Spirit but watch what he says now he he jumps into I'll jump into second Corinthians he says therefore If any man be in Christ how do we get in Christ how do we get into the body by one spirit so here's our evidence If any man have that same Spirit he is a new creature this is how we know we've received it old things are passed away behold all things are become new so this is a changing that happens inside of this brother Ram says this way he says the holy spirit is a personal experience of the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ so it is not a camp experience it's not a church experience it's not a it's not something that you have based on what goes on around you but it is a personal lasting effective experience amen it is something you are not something you did or something you got it is a changing of you of of who you literally are brother Bram says it in another way he says what is the new birth then it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you joined a church you shook a hand you did something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ he says Pastor priest whatever ever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon amen so doesn't matter what else is going on your Revelation is not about what's going on what other people say it is personal to you and your Soul Is Anchored you're settled you've entered into rest you are assured of what has happened to you and it's on the basis that you have become a new creature a new creation in Christ brother R continues now he says that's the way with people who profess Christ many of them look like Christians try to act like Christians but you've got to have Christ on the inside of you which is what the word made manifest or it'll never mature into a real Bible believing Christian remember what I said this is a journey you are you start this journey as you receive the Holy Spirit and then you are just a baby in Christ but if you don't have him you will try and you will act and you will mimic and you will do what everybody else around you is doing but that won't produce Christ it takes Christ to produce Christ on the inside and what happens is then when you hit hard times you hit struggles or offenses or hurts or Co things that are are going to impact your bank account you back away why because it's not Christ inside of you and so you cannot mature you cannot not move on he says it's Christ in you sorry it'll never mature into a real Bible believing Christian it'll always be a denominational something it cannot live because there's no life in it to live now remember what what Paul said he says old things have passed away all things are become new if we were to look around and look at something that the old has passed away and then something else has become new what does it look like if if a building were to go away and then a new one be raised up in its place what does that look like well it's got to rot and it's got to break down and it's got to crumble and then it's going to start to look really bad and it might even smell a bit funny and then there's going to come the Machinery to come in and tear it all apart there's a lot of noise there's dust there's confusion and then after that there's a building up of that house again and it's still noise and it's still a mess but when it's all said and done everything's cleaned out and you've got a house there that replaced the one that was there in other words it's a mess becoming a new creation is a mess if you look at a tree that dies and a new one comes up in its place it just starts to sayag and it starts to get soft and it starts to get doy as brother Brandon would say and it starts to crumble and rot and there's a smell associated with it but out of all of that comes life and that's the way that this works in this in this so if we're talking about evidences we've said the evidences that you re received the word but how do you know you've received the word one the holy spirit will make a mess of your life absolutely 100% even if you've been raised in a Christian home you still got issues need to be sorted out I don't know if you know this I used to be a young person I used to hide things I used to have things in my heart that people didn't know about I had thoughts I had dreams I had desires I had things I was doing in secret you parents don't think for a second that because you're raising your kids right they don't have issues they've all got issues go to a camp sometime and ask the pastors and the preachers what they come up for prayer for they've all got issues we've all got issues amen so we may be raised the right way and we may not have things that we're actively doing amen but there are still things that need to be changed absolutely 100% amen and what does it do the Holy Spirit comes in and it turns our world upside down it lifts us up and it starts to shake and say let's see what falls out isn't it and guess what it's not always habits sometimes it's attitudes sometimes it's approaches sometimes it's a uh uh just the way that we deal with people whatever it might be and so he comes up and he starts to shake our life and the bad relationships fall out and the bad habits fall out and the bad desires start to fall out and what does he do then he flips us up over again and he starts to put the good relationships in and the good habits and the good desires and all of these different things amen why cuz when life is coming into you it has an effect it changes the environment it changes everything around you as it starts to build you up and when life comes into us by the Holy Spirit he's kicking out the old man and he's putting a new person in there and it's Christ the word that's sitting in our hearts amen that whole that old controlling nature that old worldly person all those things have to be pushed aside so that he can come in there so the evidence of the Holy Spirit one of them is certainly this change if you say I've received the Holy Spirit and you're the same person today as you were yesterday I'm sorry something didn't happen it can't because you're a new creation you're a new creature in Christ amen there's been a Changing of the Guard in your life that means things are going to change you know if you've ever been in a job situation where they changed the boss he always or she always changes something they never leave it the way it is every boss when they come in they change things even if it's going well they think it can be better and so they'll change things guess what the holy spirit's no different when he comes in believe me if he kicks me out which is what he does then there's going to be a new person in charge and things are going to change and we'll see why as we go into the scriptures brother brah says it this way he says well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it she'd have to be unconscious not to know it neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it there's something takes place place in you see there's something that changes you your whole system but watch how he clares clarifies this your whole spiritual system is made new again not your flesh after the New Birth your flesh is the same stinking carnal broken flawed flesh that you have before the New Birth remember it's a soul ceiling not a flesh ceiling okay he says and you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible puts it you know it so not our flesh the flesh is unregenerated and that's where the battle is now is the soul has the holy spirit inside of it he's the controlling one in our life but our mind and our attitudes and our emotions and the five senses of our flesh are completely unregenerated so don't think you don't have the Holy Ghost because your flesh is uncooperative the fact that it's uncooperative means there's a battle going on which is one of the best best evidences you can have is that the flesh is not you're not letting the flesh have its way okay Paul says it this way he says know ye not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death amen we died with him we were in him we die with him from God's Viewpoint he says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life so in other words if you've received the same spirit that Christ did your life afterward is different than your life was before even if you were raised in a Christian home as I said your life is different there's a big difference he says for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection so there is a dying out and there's a raising up and that raising up is a new creature in Christ he says knowing this that our old man is crucified IFI with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin now we've we've preached many times on what sin is and this is something that the nominal world doesn't understand because they focus on the acts of sin rather than sin itself amen but notice we've talked about this before in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve did the very same thing and yet one of them did Sin and the other one did not remember what Paul said to Timothy he says Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so in the original sin the act that they both did was the same and yet it says the woman was in the transgression not the man what was the difference between Adam and Eve their faith that's the difference remember the woman disbelieved the word of God and we know that because she believed the word of Satan and so to believe believe his word she had to disbelieve the word and so she was deceived and her sin was that she disbelieved the word of God Adam on the other hand knew and believed the word of God but he accepted the consequences for the sake of his bride it was a type of Christ an imperfect type but a type nonetheless but he did not disbelieve the word he did it to save his bride to be with her bride amen so Paul comes along now and he says the body of sin is destroyed not will be destroyed he says it is destroyed amen so there's a changing of this natural body that's coming but he's not talking about this natural body is destroyed he says the body of sin is already destroyed by the new birth and we're now in newness of life so if we look at this scripture again and he's talking about he says knowing this our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin the body of unbelief might be destroyed that henceforth from now on on we should not serve unbelief so what is he doing what is this new birth doing is it sets our faith in the word of God and nothing else that's what it's doing amen there's more to this idea on the body of sin being destroyed we're going to take a whole service on it sometime in the future Lord willing but really what he's focused on here is that you have moved from death which is to believe everything but the word or only a portion of the word to life which is to what receive the full word you move from a body of sin to a body of life okay that's the evidence remember of a child of God is that they can hear and accept the word of God we read this scripture last service where Jesus said he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you not of God so every child of God every son every daughter will accept the word as it comes your way and God is gracious he knows how to send it God doesn't just come up and just punch us between the eyes with everything that's why we have to have Grace one for another God moves at different speeds and different areas of life for each and every one of us but what he does is he gives us the word as we need it and as we accept that then he can bring the next portion and the next portion and the next portion and that's one of the other evidences we'll see is that there is a continuation in the word of God for a child of God that has received the holy spirit amen but there's more what what's he doing with that word he may just be getting somebody to the place where they realize there's more to being a child of God or a Christian than just going to church cuz that's what 99.9% of Christians think going to church makes me a Christian and that has so little to do with it in the big scheme of things Satan's in church amen the holy spirit is here to elevate us from acting like a child of God to being a child of God Pharisees were the actors remember they were acting something they were not there's a big difference we've got to go from acting like a Christian to becoming Christ big difference between those two things we read that quote where brother Bram said that our whole spiritual system is made new and that means it's got to be different than the old way and our old way was this way Paul said in Ephesians 2 he says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins this is the body of sin this is the body of death wherein in time ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience all of us he says among all whom also we and I put all in Big Bright letters so that every one of us would see no matter where we were raised no matter how good our parents are how good the ministry was how faithful we were in church we are still all born this way we all had our conversation we all had our living our way of life in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others what are the things that are unregenerated the Flesh and the spirit he gives us a new spirit but that's not a regenerated spirit it's a new one but it's not his his is the one that we need the other one can just get along with it brother brandham said but it is not a perfect Spirit otherwise we wouldn't need his Spirit but what's Paul pointing here what I'm trying to get across he's showing us a contrast he's showing us a change in our way of life amen he's looking at the old and the new he's looking at what was and what is he's looking about how it used to be and how it is now and we ought to be able to see that no matter how old we are we ought to be able to see a progression in our walk with God as the word becomes a greater reality in our life amen these things have to be totally different what you were and what you are need to be completely different because we're all born Bound in sin to the lust of our flesh so if we've got a new system a new spiritual system that old one can't survive so we know that if we before it might have been religious but now it has to become Christ and we may have been taught well and have knowledge but now that's got to translate into Revelation because revelation will live that's the difference between knowledge and Revelation revelation has life in it knowledge has nothing it's of no good in and of itself it needs Faith behind it and that's what Revelation is is a faith is is a faith is is a revelation of the will of God but how do we feed our spiritual system there's only two places faith and doubt the word of God and everything else amen if we've got the holy spirit it's going to feed on the things of God it's going to feed our faith it's going to feed our Christian walk because our Christian walk is 100% by faith it is Faith from start to finish people ask us all the time when they're talking to us atheists people in the world maybe close friends or or or co-workers they say how can you believe what you believe by faith listen we have evidences we've had experiences and all those things but in the end it comes down to Faith amen we believe because we believe we can't help it but how do we get Faith we're going to build a bit of a circle this morning this evening Paul said this he says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so faith comes by receiving and applying the word of God it's very simple so if you're lacking something in your life where are you going to go the word of God Amen I I I if you're struggling in an area of your life where do you go to build up your faith if you're facing a trial if you're facing great Temptations If You're you know you're going to be walking into battle you know you're going to need Faith then where do you go Church the word of God every single time read it meditate upon it sing about it listen to it whatever way you can absorb it whatever way you can get it into your system if I can put it that way if there's a situation that requires a greater Faith get into the word of God nothing else will do it nothing else will do it you got to get into the word of God Peter would write to the to to the the Believers all over the the the new Gentile regions in places where the gospel was just starting and these people were not raised in a believing home they were not raised serving the one true God they had no background for these things but the apostles come through and they preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and some of these people were converted but I want you to watch how Peter encourages them in their walk these are new Believers just received the Holy Spirit watch what Peter says he says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings laying aside all your feelings and all your false words he says as newborn babes why is he saying as newborn babes because they are newborn babes as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby that word sincere means this it means reasonable unadulterated and pure now we would great maybe jump quickly if we're talking about the word and say unadulterated and pure that makes sense but reasonable the word is reasonable God's Expectations by the word are reasonable church because you're what a bab in Christ these are just young believers new Believers and what do you feed a baby milk that's what God has provided for a newborn baby there's a built-in food delivery system to Mama and it's just milk but notice she takes the strong meat and she converts it into something that produces milk but as we grow then what do we start to do we start to eat solid foods we start to get into the steak and the bread and the honey and the jam and all the good things chocolate we get into the good stuff but as a baby you only need one thing and that's milk and the milk will do the job if you'll just drink the milk what's Peter saying he's saying guys don't get ahead of where you are don't try and be more than you are you've just received the Holy Spirit he's saying listen you got to lay aside your feelings you got to lay aside the way you talk and just get into the word and let the word do what's reasonable for a baby get you walking cuz if you can't walk you're easy pickings just get you where you can walk and once you start to walk then you can start to run and you can start to climb and you can start to get around and you'll build your strength and from there you'll grow very quickly but you got to eat to have strength and the strength will help you to move forward in your relationship with Christ amen he's saying start small don't try and be an elder at the tender age of 19 you're not expected to even Paul told Timothy who was a special special special young man he says show by your good works prove yourself do the basics Timothy so that they'll trust you to do the bigger stuff don't jump ahead Timothy yes you're a special guy we've laid hands on you you've got a great gift inside of you but you've got to prove yourself in the basics before you can ever step up into any area of responsibility that's why the preaching of the word can't always be great Mysteries and tremendous depth in the word it can't always be great Doctrine and theology we've got to be able to preach the word to the entire congregation amen we've got to be able to preach real world examples and application we've got to be able to preach to people that aren't even under conviction or those that are under conviction and need the Holy Spirit to those that have the Holy Spirit and yet are early in their Journey all the way up to our elders that have received and are really at the Apex of their Christian walk by God's grace I appreciate how they'll sit here in these services and they say the most amens even though they've already got the Holy Spirit and have had it for decades why because they know it's good for the rest of us and here's the thing they need more of it as well absolutely but we'll see as we talk about how that transitions amen but you know we had a a funny moment in the house not funny it was it was very tender I I so appreciated it and our youngest came up to me and he he had we have these visual Bibles it's all pictures and he came up and he showed me a picture of the crucifixion and he said did he die and I said yes that's Jesus he died there he says why I said he died because we were bad and he couldn't understand this concept about how being bad could have such dire impact on a human life and so he kept asking how why did the Romans do it what and he couldn't grasp this idea what is it he's trying to catch the gospel I couldn't take him into the portals of Glory with my revelation of what was going on I'm trying to tell him when we're bad there's a price that has to be paid and he took your spanking so you wouldn't have to that's why we've got to preach from the easy stuff to the highest stuff amen and just because we preach the high stuff doesn't mean we're all there I preach stuff I don't have yet church but I preach it because it's in the word and I aspire to it I expect it I'm looking for it I'm praying for it I'm asking for it but we've got to preach the whole spectrum of the Gospel amen it's why we tend to cringe don't we when somebody comes along and they've been raised in a Christian home perhaps raised in the message I think is the worst that we see and they have lofty ideas about all sorts of things and yet they're lacking the basics of Christian Christianity their attitude's wrong their Nature's wrong they're still selfish they're still egotistical whatever it might be however that looks amen what happens is they've skipped the milk and they went straight to the steak and they never developed because their digestive system couldn't handle it if they'd have gone by way of milk and then to solid food they'd have built themselves up into a true Christian but because they skipped by way of knowledge rather than by experience it's just a cringe Fest the whole time remember what Jesus said to Peter the first thing he said was Peter feed my Lambs cuz Peter if you don't get them from Lambs to sheep it's no good giving them sheep food you got to get them from the lamb stage to the full grown sheep stage and then you can feed them by sheep food but at the beginning it's just got to be what little lambs take and that's going to be milk so he says Peter feed my lambs and then he says Peter feed my sheep and then he says Peter feed my sheep again we've got to be able to preach the whole thing you know even if you look at Jesus ministry brother Grant shared with me a Bible study that he did recently it was excellent and he was talking about the the the three the three polls and we know brother Brandon's Ministry had three PS sign of the hand discernment and then it was the spoken word but if you look at Christ Ministry he had the same thing and his ministry progressed he started with signs and wonders and yes he went around preaching but the preaching wasn't really the big focus it was the manifesting the pointing to the word and then after that what did he do he started to reveal the word and then after the revealing of the word was the fulfilling of the word signs and wonders revealed word fulfilled word that's how he progressed through these things amen and so we can see that in our own lives we don't jump to the top of the experience ladder we've got to go wrong by wrung by wrong and go through the hard work of it because that hard work is the dying out that's necessary to have the character to handle what's coming on the higher rungs that's what's going on Amen are you with me this evening amen so if there you've got the holy spirit inside of you it'll create a desire for the word like you've never had before that's what it does Amen remember Paul said Faith cometh by hearing reading is good reading is good don't stop reading your Bible but there's a hearing because hearing is what brings understanding and it's based on anointed what Ministry it's a five-fold ministry that's been appointed to bring the church into Perfection into full maturity it's not not just hearing but it's the understanding and it comes by way of that five full ministry from your prophets to your Apostles evangelists pastors and teachers but it's not men speaking it's supposed to be the Holy Spirit speaking remember when Philip was drawn out to the to the the unic in The Chariot and he was reading Isaiah and Philip came up to him he says do you understand what you're reading he says how can I unless a man Teach me well guess what a man won't do it but the Holy Spirit through a man will do it that's what it was going to take and it took a man full of the Holy Spirit to reveal to him what Isaiah was and it brought conviction on that man and he was saved and baptized that very day right there in the water it just took the holy spirit in a man you I was talking to my wife the other day about when I was studying on some things about lead DEA a while ago and I came across a well-known Baptist preacher and he was he was preaching on the leodan church Age and what he had to say was factually excellent he drove he deep down into the geography and the political and the the finan I things of those those times and his explanation of those scriptures in terms of the facts and setting a scene of leoa was was far better than anything I've ever heard but he missed the greatest part of that scripture he had all the facts he had all the ideas he had all the understanding but he couldn't see where he was in that scripture and so he had all of the facts about it but he didn't have a revelation of it and so he now is sitting there with only a half truth stuck in the very thing that he was crying out against because he doesn't have a revelation of what's going on in Le oysa amen what was he missing Church the holy spirit's voice because it's already spoken we've already had a vindicative voice amen that man is a man I believe with a gift absolutely but what he's missing is that there is a voice that has already spoken to this age and he came and he showed us what that verse was all about about what that was all about amen I'm so glad God sent a Vindicated prophet of Malachi 4 of Luke 17:30 of Revelation 107 these different things all those great scriptures and it's a voice that turns our hearts back to the truth you know it amazes me because Jesus we read the scripture in in previous Services where he says the Holy Spirit even today will guide you into all truth when Christ was here in flesh form he did not preach the entirety of the Gospel he understood it he was it but it took Paul to come to give us what we have in this Old Testament in such great in such a great way who was it speaking remember what Jesus says when he the holy spirit is come he won't speak of himself why who was the Holy Spirit speaking Paul Paul didn't speak about Paul Paul spoke about Christ it was the Holy Spirit speaking through a man bringing us into all truth there is nothing we can add to Paul's Message Church brother Ram didn't add a thing to it he preached the same gospel so the holy spirit let us into all truth and that all truth was brought to us by a man and he preaches that and then what happens is now Jesus says you know they said we thought that Elijah was supposed to come he says he has first come and he sure he he will come and restore all things he had said when the Holy Spirit come he'll lead you into all all truth and then at the end he says there's going to be somebody that comes and he'll take you back into all truth he'll restore you into all things what is it once again it's the Holy Spirit speaking through a prophet to bring us back to the word that's what's going on amen he said Elias truly shall come and Reve restore all things and that's what we've got in this age is a prophet that's restoring the full word back to us to produce Christ the way it was in the original age in the First Age so yes the holy spirit will speak through men Vindicated anointed men men that are gifted and called to preach the word but I'll tell you this he'll speak to you as well why because you've heard the voice that's what he's doing is he's speaking to you he's opening up the word because you have shown yourself willing to receive the word then he can open up your word to you I have my devotions in the morning and then I study to preach in the evening and I separate those things uh intentionally because there's things that I need God to deal with me in my life about and then there's things that he needs to deal with the church and that includes me as well but there's personal and then there's group if I can put it that way but there are things that I'm reading in the scriptures and it's just for me and it doesn't open up because I'm a preacher it opens up because I'm a Child of God I believe that as you read the word with an open heart to hear what he says he'll speak catch what I'm saying we don't read to hear what we think we read to catch what he says total difference total difference we're not looking for Vindication we're looking for leadership and Direction by the word of God Amen I can't emphasize that enough the nominal Christian world has fallen apart because they've read what they want and they think rather than what the word says and they've missed the voice of the Holy Spirit to this age it's made a mess of things continuing on if so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also so he says as Christ was a living Stone living Stone a stone that's alive men didn't want it they pushed it away but yet it was of God it was chosen of God it was precious ye also as Lively Stone so in other words just like Christ ye are Lively Stones you are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ notice he doesn't say you are he says you are built up there's a process of choosing there's a process of digging out of the earth then there's the shaping and the cutting and the forming and the trimming and the sanding then the transport and then there's the fitting in the adoption the positional placing but it's a progress of work it's a process that's going on before we can be fully fitted into the bride of Christ and that's the working of the holy spirit in the believer's life he says wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in zon a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner what everybody else has turned aside is what God has chosen you want another evidence you'll be turned down he says and it's a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense but watch this watch what stumbles them it says even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed notice they stumble at accepting receiving the word amen they just can't take it they either reject it or they add a little bit or they take a little bit away amen Peter says they were appointed to this they are not children of God and so they are appointed to refuse the word of God but notice this it doesn't say they stumble at attending church doesn't say they they they they stumble at being a part of a local body it doesn't say they're not religious it says they stumble at the word that's what causes the problems amen the word is what trips them up makes them fall why because they're disobedient he says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so we're living stones we're alive when this process is going on and we saw how at the beginning we have that that sincere uh milk of the word and God takes care of the basics we could say God cleans out our life God changes our desires God God uh you know we have those little hidden habits and those little things that we don't want people to know about and the Holy Spirit is here to take care of those that's the first thing he's doing is he's getting you ready for him to use amen but let me say it this way what you do doesn't matter nearly so much as what you want to do we are going to lose to this flesh from time to time but it's the changing of the heart that matters remember what Jesus said he says if a man looks on a woman to lust after her he has already done it with her in his heart and he is judged as if he did it in his flesh God's looking at the heart and that's the thing that needs the changing amen that's the desires so if our actual desire is to do the things that don't please God that's what the holy spirit's there to change now you can fight that desire all your life and God bless you for fighting but that's not the victory God bless you for fighting amen but your desires have to be cleansed they need to be Washed by the Water of the word your and and your your guilty conscience has to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ that's the real Victory is when the desire is no longer there rather than the battle is going on in you're fighting why because now you've entered into rest you've ceased from your dead works and you've entered in the rest that is Christ amen now that doesn't mean we aren't tempted and let me drop this in here real quick that doesn't mean we aren't tempted because this flesh is sticky it has five senses It Wants What It Wants but what the what the Holy Spirit does is he changes Temptation from a desire to a choice because here's the thing I don't sit around all day I got to be real careful here got to pick something that's okay to say over the pulpit I don't desire I don't sit around all day every day even part of my day wishing I made $300,000 a year but if the opportunity comes up to make $300,000 a year let me say this this flesh is going to say lead me to that job right because the flesh wants stuff it wants Comfort it wants ease it wants security and so that there is a Temptation there from the flesh but in my my heart it doesn't matter to me but if you put it at the right time in the right place with the right spin on it it can become a greater Temptation especially if I'm dried out especially if I'm not where I want to be where I ought to be but in my heart of hearts my desire is to serve God not to make a lot of money but it's a Temptation because this flesh likes everything that money brings amen so what does the Holy Spirit do it takes away that continual thirst for the things of the world and the things of this flesh and that's when you can rest cuz can you imagine not imagine we've all been there when all you do is fight all day long because there's something in here that's wrong that's a miserable miserable place and that's the rest of Christ when you get the holy spirit is it'll take that away so now you've just got the occasional Choice rather than the constant battle to keep those things in check amen does that make sense so he changes the Holy Spirit changes your motive it changes your purpose your desires and so when those things come up it's not a heart and soul desire and so it's easier to overcome and so the holy spirit's there to have you turn your head to say no to use your feet for discernment to hit the next song Whatever that might be in our life amen Paul or John would say it this way I love the scripture he says for whatsoever is born of God how are we born Church by the holy spirit for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world you want to know if you've been born again you're overcoming the world Amen very simple test you win the battle against The Temptations and influences of this world he says and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so see how it's all tied together he says we've got to have faith to have overcoming power but we need Faith to get the victory but Faith only comes by hearing the word but you can only hear the word if you're a child of God God and you can only become a child of God by the Holy Spirit as in you can only live the word by the holy spirit so it's all tied into this one big circle here he says who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God we got lots of people saying they believe Jesus is the son of God shoot this scripture and see where they end up are you overcoming the world CU if you're not you don't love him because if you did that love would do something in our life when we really believe overcoming power follows he says this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth Jesus said the holy spirit will lead you into all truth because what it's the spirit of the word it is the word amen so the more we mature the greatting the work the greater the working of the spirit in our life and it's not just Truth for the sake of knowledge but it's Truth for the sake sake of an experience of the reality of the word it's to take that truth and make it an applied experience rather than a head knowledge experience Amen brother R says it this way he says a hybrid plant we're talking about overcoming the world there we go a hybrid plant you have to baby it and spray it and keep the bugs and beetles off of it but not a genuine healthy plant he is sturdy strong and no bugs come on him he has got enough in him to throw the bug off and so as a genuine Christian you don't have to Baby him and Pat him and tell him this that or the other he says he has got something in him the baptism of the Holy Ghost that throws all the rest of it off you don't have to beg him around because he's a genuine plant of God he says he has got something in him that Wars I love that a Christian fights for every inch of ground he stands on he must do that if ever expects to exist and by doing it there's something in him that takes care of him so what's he saying if you've got the Holy Spirit you'll fight and you'll fight and you'll fight and you'll fight you'll fight when you're disappointed you'll fight when you're tired you'll fight when you're weak you'll fight when it's hopeless you'll fight when you're hurt you'll fight when you're offended there's something in you that won't let it go and sometimes we think well I've given up I'm not fighting the way I used to but the thing is you hav walked away that's when you've lost the battle is when you walk away when you lay your weapon down that's when you've lost sometimes all we're doing is we're laying bloody on the on the on the field of battle and we're just slightly poking that sword up and saying stick stay away keeping the buzzards off of us but we're still fighting we're still fighting the scripture says a just man a righteous man falls seven times but he gets up again why there's a life inside of him that's bubbling up that cannot be suppressed you can put concrete on it you can put dirt on it you can slander it you can kick them you can do whatever you want but there's a life that keeps coming up because it's the Life of Christ it's not me inside that's doing this that's what we're talking about amen it may not look like we're fighting but we haven't dropped our weapon I was reading in my devotions yesterday morning and I love this it's talking about the Mighty Men of David it says these be the names of the Mighty Men whom David had and he talks about the top three it says the taconite that sat in the seat chief of among the captains this is the best of the best was Ado the eite and he lifted up his spear against 800 whom he slew at one time and after him was elazar the son of Dodo the yoite one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away now watch the great man here he says he arose he didn't sit back he went to battle it says and smot the Philistines until his head hand was weary till he could barely lift his sword it says and his hand clave unto The Sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day notice we've got a pause there a period of time that wasn't the end of the battle he was fighting that way for a long time it says and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to SPO oil now we know that the scriptures in the Old Testament are a type and a shadow but I want you to see something the first thing that elazar did was he went into battle he got involved he says I'm not going to stand here and let the uncircumcised Philistines take what belongs to a child of God so he arose and he took his weapon and he fought and he fought and he fought and he got tired but I want you to see something church that the longer he fought the more at one he became with his weapon and at the end of it he couldn't let that word go he couldn't let that sword go because his hand had fused to his weapon why because he said I'm not letting go and it became a part of him Hallelujah he couldn't let go if he wanted to that sword was a part of him the word had become one with the with the Christian with the believer with the warrior don't let go this morning this evening don't let go when you get tired disappointed weary depressed thinking it's just you it was just elazar and it says that what elazar did was he got something for everybody else that ran away they only returned after his he had become one with the word but they got the blessing of his battle and I'm sure it inspired courage for the next time but he became one with the word amen people say this this thing today when you've received the message you've received the Holy Spirit and I know what they're talking about I know what they're trying to say but it's not strictly correct because Jesus said the Devils believe also and tremble if we talk about simple belief or acceptance of it in that way the Devils believe it enough that they're scared of it amen but it's becoming what you believe that shows that you've received it amen you become one with your weapon with the word amen we can believe it in our head but until it drops into our soul and starts to produce the Life of Christ in this body our faith is intellectual and our belief is purely that as well it's not wrong it's not bad it just has to mature it has to grow amen we need a rapturing faith a changing faith not just a knowing faith we need something that's going to take us into a life experience that is a changing amen we start as newborn babes in Christ as Peter said Naturally Speaking we do the same thing we grow from a a baby into a toddler and toddlers aren't a much use except wrecking things and making messes we've got to be patient with our young Christians sometimes they make more messes than they help but you know what you'll find that the heart of a good child they still want to struggle and carry that one little bag of groceries up the stairs banging the freshly purchased eggs all along the stairs all along the way and then dropping them on the apples so they all get bruised but what are they trying to do they're trying to help and we let them help in their own little way they're not much use but they're a little bit they may make the difference between one trip and two trips to the car for the groceries and we appreciate that amen but then as they get a little older well they can now they can shovel the snow off the off the steps they can clear the walkway as they get older they can clear the whole driveway can't they brother Bob and it's a wonderful day they can mold along and these different things as we come into the teenager years now they have the strength to do so much but what do they need they need the right application of the strength they need the character they need the willingness to do what needs to be done they've got the strength now they need to put it in the right place so from that first stage God is really building you up and he sets that that Firm Foundation that word foundation and he gets those early principles settled on on the first on the first bit amen but once that's settled then where does God start working this is my personal experience I believe the word supports it was we move now into attitude we move into response we move into laying our lives down we move into a humility we move into a servitude amen God starts taking all of those principles and he starts putting them into action in the local body then the local community where now we don't have to fight over everything we can lay our rights down we can lay our ego down we can lay our image down amen and we're able to let the love of Christ flow rather than what this flesh wants to let flow which is usually two quick lefts and a solid right to finish the job that's what this flesh wants so many times amen but it's the love of Christ now that's flowing through us and we're starting to come then to a place where our purpose becomes clear and what used to satisfy us in the word no longer does amen I remember this may shock some people I hope you understand my heart I used to love going to youth camps when I was a youth but when I went to youth camps after I received the Holy Spirit after a while guess what I needed more it's a wonderful place it's a wonderful atmosphere but the focus is something that I didn't necessarily need it's not wrong it's not bad it's wonderful things but it's really focused on people at a different stage of their Christian walk and so when I would go to a youth camp now it's as a supporter more than it is as a receiver I'm there to work and help and set an atmosphere and pray for others rather than go in there and get a bunch of stuff for myself why cuz I've moved on I've matured I've grown amen so we need something a little stronger and Paul would talk about this in Hebrews he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us do what go on go on unto Perfection onto maturity onto completeness is the the root word there he says not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards God I was talking to brother Mark the other day and he says well you'll you'll notice somebody's maturing in the word when they stop coming up to the altar every service that's a really good thing because they've got a revelation that you don't have to come up here to repent doesn't always have to be a show it's not that it was a show but it doesn't have to be a public uh uh thing you can do that in the privacy of your own home on on your bed in your car seat whatever you might be amen he says we we we moved on beyond what we had these were the principles that you're your Christian walk is built on Amen the faith that accepts the finished work of Calvary of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment now you've moved from from from what got you into Christ now you're moving to the foundational truth of the Christian church but he says there's more to it than that there's more than just understanding there's more than just go good Doctrine Peter's saying you shouldn't need to be taught the basics again you've got them you've applied them you've received them you followed them you've obeyed them they're settled now keep going keep moving on in your walk amen there's more than just understanding Perfection maturity now is getting the full effect of it rather than just the knowledge of it a revelation is meant to be revealed amen and if we're the word made flesh then that Revelation at some point has to drop into this flesh thank you brother Matt he says' but beloved we're persuaded better things of you he says we believe you're going to do this you you're meant to do better than what you've got he says and things that accompany salvation though we though we thus speak so we don't stop because we're saved because we're filled with the Holy Spirit there are greater things that are waiting for us he says for God is Not unrighteous for to forget your work and your labor of love which you have showed uh toward his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope under the end he says don't won't stop the works your maturity won't stop you from having an effect in the local congregation and in the body of Christ and these different things but he says you've got to go on to Perfection maturity he says so be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patient do what they inherit the promises remember when you go into into Hebrews 11 I guess the the faith chapter they would say by Faith by Faith by faith he says these all died having not receive the promises but he says you've got to have faith and patience to inherit the promises because they're meant for you to get them they're not meant to always stay out there as a carrot God holding a carrot to try and keep us moving forth but there's a day where we're supposed to receive it there's a day where we're supposed to have the reality of it in your life so he's saying don't stop because you've had a new birth don't stop because you're saved don't stop because you have gifts amen he says go all the way to the promise that's meant for you and what's our promise it's a resurrection and a Rapture it's a body change amen it's rapturing Faith it's a marriage supper of the L it's a glorified body listen you can stop here with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you'll go to heaven but who wants to show up having sat around for the last bit keep going keep pressing keep pushing to the full promise Paul would talk to the Jewish the the the Jewish converts and the thing I love about Paul is he never pulled his punches and it wasn't wasn't Paul that was doing that it was the Holy Spirit doing it and I think it's because sometimes we need a swift kick in the rear to get us going sometimes Paul says for one for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat so Peter said leaving the first principles once you got them established and now Paul's coming back and he's saying you've not grown at all and now we've got to retach you the things that you were supposed to have been taught and used already why they didn't move on in the word they didn't feed their experience they were satisfied with where they'd gotten and all it led to was a backslidden condition he says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a bab new newly Christians that have newly received the Holy Ghost let me put it this way don't go in thinking you're going to correct the church be still grow learn be humble and God will open your eyes and if you do what Timothy did then people will listen to you because it'll be the Holy Spirit speaking not you he says but strong meat belongeth to them that are of what full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now I'm not going to dig into the script scripture we could preach a whole service on it but I want you to see one thing here and he says that if you have the Holy Spirit it will bring you to maturity that is reflected in your daytoday life and decisions because you've exercised what you've got amen we're we're talking about people that have moved Beyond knowing the doctrines and knowing the teachings and have fully applied the word of God and now they're able to say it's true because they've experienced the truth of the applying of the word and what does it do Church it gives them discernment it gives them an understanding it gives them an insight into what's going on and they've learned it because they've tested it and they've applied it and they've checked their own life against what the word says they've checked their decisions hey every church has things where we look back and say we wish we would have caught that earlier don't we absolutely you guys know what happened in Texas and I've said before the reason that I believe we missed it is because we were too willing to look past it we put the word aside because we wanted so bad to have a pastor there to have a minister there amen but these people they've learned to look past your clothes your good your good clothes your good words they've learned to look past what they see and look at your attitude your spirit your priorities and they've learned to have patience to see the fruit before before they fully commit listen we we ought to open our arms to every person but we also have to have deser to sit there and see first that's why we have a waiting period to serve in as an officer of this church a minimum 6 months so that we can see what your life is like a minister moves in here what do we do we stop and we see unless we already know them well there's a time of waiting for those things and it's a time of testing and it's a time of proving and why do we do that church because we got discernment and we know that we have to see the fruits to really see what's in that person's life amen so in other words we can have this idea that we've received the Holy Spirit and that's good we want to believe we ought to believe and our faith ought to be an anchor for our soul but our faith needs to be anchored in something real and brother Braham said there's only one place for an for your faith to Anchor and that's the word of God Amen if our faith is anchored in an exp exp erience and it doesn't produce a life that lines up with the word of God there's something wrong with our experience it's that simple okay that experience may have been from God it may have been God but it is not the receiving or the baptism of the holy spirit because there will be a lasting effect that matures you in the word if you've received the Holy Spirit there's a growth in your Christian walk amen If all we're doing is coming to church going home and sleeping getting up going to work for a couple more days coming back to church and then having a day off on the weekend and then doing it all again and rinse and repeat rinse and repeat church that's not the Holy Ghost that's just dead religion there's a life there's a life day to day that represents and reveals Christ amen otherwise it's just dead tradition Jesus said this he says sorry John said this behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now we'll have a body like unto his glorified glorious body the scripture says but will also have his character and nature that's what the lead Dean uh overcoming is remember is it's gold tried in the fire that's the deity that's the character the nature of Christ we'll have a white robe that's his righteousness and that's what comes out of this amen but then he says in John 1 this is or 1 John 3 he says but as many as received him remember only a child of God can receive Christ the word to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen so there's a transforming that it's talking about here we talk about a metamorphosis where it doesn't appear what you are until the end you always were this but the outside hid what was on the inside and so Paul is saying or pet John is saying here he says there's a power that comes here that will transform what does not appear to be a child of God into a child of God you always were a child of God but there's an appearance that has to change there's something that has to happen from the inside out that makes it very clear that you are a child of God Amen and so it starts with an inward work of the Holy Spirit sealing our soul a changing of our nature our desires and these different things and that's to get us to accept the word of God and give it the preeminence in our life but after that when that desire has changed when we've surrendered to him now all of that has to be put into action and into service it has to do something in our life amen I can't say that this Bible has changed my life if my my life is the same as it was before the Bible changed my life if my life is the same after I've received Christ then I didn't receive Christ because it will always take me further and further into the word remember what Jesus said he said I came that you might have life more abundantly more and more life continuously growing a Wellspring of of life within us amen the holy spirit is here to make us live like we never could live before that's the bottom line to it all amen because it's that eternal life springing up inside us and that's bringing now our body and our spirit by faith subject to the word of God going to read two quotes and we'll close he says the word is supposed to transform you from what the things of the world are into the image of the Sons and Daughters of God then if you accept that word it'll transform you from a son of the world a daughter of the world to a son and daughter of God he says look at you in here how many have had that experience every one of us we've had that experience why because it was spoken it was believed and the word came forth and fell into the bed of the heart and there it grew right out of it he says transforming yourself his holy spirit transforms the seed word into its likeness like if a pear tree brings forth a pear an apple tree an apple things like that his word word will bring forth Sons and Daughters of God that's what it is supposed to do if youve received the Holy Spirit it'll change you into it'll transform you into a child of God Amen God bless you let's stand yeah we look at that and it can be confusing at times because we say well what's the difference I look just like anybody else at the start for sure but you know we had this kind of disgusting experience I guess at the house where you can look around your house and if you go look at the leaves in the spring you'll see all sorts of worms and insects and all sorts of creepy crawly things and some of them look very similar but you'll notice that some of them after a while a process starts to happen and this happened on the front window of our house right next to our main door and what was it is one of those worms that didn't look any different from a lot of other worms he went up and he attached himself to our front window and then there was a fuzz that went over him and inside that fuzz we didn't see anything happen but one day the fuzz was open and a big red nasty mess was out of it but you know what else came out Church a butterfly you can go into the into into nature into the wild and you can put two caterpillars beside each other and one of them is a butterfly and the other one will never be a butterfly one of them has inside of it the nature of a butterfly amen the other one looks just like that that butterfly did at the beginning but it can do everything the butterfly does and it'll never change into a butterfly it will never go to a place where it wraps itself and it rests and it changes itself in a process called metamorphosis that's what the word does you might look like a caterpillar like everybody else but there's a DNA inside of you a word seed that says you're a child of God and when that word comes and you wrap yourself in it and you give yourself over to the process and you let it do its work one day it cracks open and all of a sudden you're a child of God and then from there guess what that butterfly isn't Bound by what it was bound by before it doesn't have to crawl it doesn't have to creep it can go as high as it wants it can go as low as it wants it can fly wherever it wants at a speed it could never do things before it has overcoming power it didn't have before it's not Earthbound anymore everything about it was meant to be this way and yet it did not appear as Paul says what we are but we know when we see him we're going to be like him what is it we'll be turned we'll be transformed into the fullness of the word for our day that's what the Holy Spirit does don't worry about how you look when you start trust the process and he'll change you into a son and a daughter of God amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Lord God how thankful we are Lord that this is not a process Lord that relies on us Lord but you built into US Lord a way of being a child of God lord and it comes by the washing of Water by the word and it comes by the power of your spirit to quick Quicken that seed inside of us and Lord all we have to do is surrender Lord we take it we believe it we apply it and then by faith with patience Lord we look for the promise Lord we're all at different stages here tonight from The Young to the old Lord from those that have not given their hearts to you to those that have confessed you as their Savior and haven't received your spirit Lord to those that have but they are young in their walk Lord all the way to those that are fully experienced Lord and ready for that change Lord but from the top to the bottom we're waiting for the Perfection the maturity of that image Lord I pray you help us to rest in your word Lord that is the only thing that'll do it Lord we've accepted the word for our day Lord and we're trusting it'll do that work our faith is in your word Lord and it's quickened by your spirit help us to trust Lord help us to wait Lord help us to be real help us to be honest honest about where we're at Lord and look for the good things of God to grow in Grace Lord help us to be gracious one to another as well Lord we are Lord we are dust Lord we are Fallen creatures outside of the Holy Spirit Lord give us Grace one for another patience Lord help your love to cover a multitude of sins Lord those little things that we do and say that great Lord and forgive us where we fail Lord help us to hold tight to our weapon Lord let us become one with it we pray Lord and when the arm is weak Lord help us to keep fighting anyways trusting Lord that the answer the help is on the way Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's
