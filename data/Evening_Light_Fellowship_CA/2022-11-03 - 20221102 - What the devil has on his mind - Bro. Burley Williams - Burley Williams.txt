there's anything that we needed God provided Grace for other well but I need this I need that well brother without Grace we get nothing because you got it got to start with Grace no wonder the Bible says by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen thank God for Grace amen Grace to believe Grace to take our stand Grace to move on Grace to understand amen what God has done but Grace to understand what God is doing amen praise the name of the Lord Brother it's not just moving on with a religion it's moving on with Revelation praise the name of there's too many going on even in the word today they're just moving on it's just religion religion or we believe this we believe that whether yeah what what is your faith doing for you Amen brother it's just making them more and more religious but brother we need to get more and more spiritual not religious but spiritual amen and brother I'll tell you this religious you're just caught up with the church if you're spiritual you're going to get caught up with the word not getting caught up with the word the word's going to catch you up amen we got to get caught up with the word and then keep believing until the word catches you up in the rapture amen because if there's anything you're looking for now anything we need now is the resurrection and the rapture oh brother it's more than just oh Lord I want the spirit of God to move and do this move and do that brother brother he's he's done it all down Through the Ages God we can say God did this God did that God did this and then they can they all testify on what God did in their day in their age what mother we're testifying what has God done in this hour and what is God doing in this hour amen let's not go back oh he did this he did this he did this but we got to understand that what he what he did and what he was doing was to get us bring us to what we what he's doing now amen and to get us to believe what he's doing amen not to look back and say I believe this I believe that I believe that no brother you move on because now brother he's asking us to believe what the others did he didn't ask them to believe they believe in a resurrection and they believe some of them believe that there's going to be a Rapture but that to them it was up there but now for us it's here Abraham praise the Lord for God because it's not in the past it's not in the future it's in the present amen God God brings us his word into the present tense brother it was in the present tense for for our other ages what God gave them amen the Revelation for that age but what is the Revelation for this age brother what God requires of us Brothers what he gave them Plus amen it's not just the same well I I believe this God did this God's going to do this yeah brother well we got to go right on back in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth amen and God did this and God did that brother we believe God had a plan a purpose and per an a reason to do it God is by the grace of God help us to get more and more into the revelation of his plan and his purpose yes in God's pattern the way the way he he does it the way he was going to do it amen oh brother sister help us God may the Lord help us amen so the Lord bless you and again I could go on I guess if we could go on and Minister but the Lord really I I was going to have the another brother minister and uh online tonight and uh so uh hopefully he won't be too long uh because if he preaches then I preach and so on but so it's difficult to get up and do behind the ball but as a clergy and not breach amen if you just got to get up and greet the people you're gonna you're gonna greet to greet them with a sermon amen so we just pray the grace of God be with us as we will tonight go into hear another brother Minister on the word but I want to share with you a scripture we have to ask you to keep keep one another in prayer and uh but uh if it was ever an hour that we need to pray for one another's now but when we consider the hour the age that we're living brother brother uh there's going to be well the Bible says concerning this age the Bible says when he comes will he find faith amen they had a reason for for putting that in the word amen because they knew when it went all down Through the Ages that this was going to happen this was going to happen that was going to happen until finally it was Faith was going to get less and less and less yeah fewer and fewer and fewer amen because when he comes he's there's going to be so few here for the resurrection so a few going in the Rapture oh yes the bubble of God someone asked the prophet of God he said well brother Branham he said what would you do if God asked you to pick out you know so many for the bride in this hour this age and he said uh you know but how many would he get he said I might get a dozen a dozen that's 50 or 60 years ago when the prophet was there now gone how many will you find now how many were can we go out there and find now I'll tell you brother sister straight is the gate Narrows the way and few there be that binding considering and compared to all all that are religious out there the spiritual is going to give so small so few so I pray God that we Are Spiritual not religious we're spiritual amen because brother it's in spiritual are going into Resurrection the spiritual are going into Rapture not to religious so the grace of God to help us to get out of away from religion and into the spiritual revelation of the word the Holy Ghost revelation of the word we're not following man and I trust by Grace we're here we're not following William Branham we're following the word amen because he was sent to point us to the word and then God took him off the scene and he knew that he knew he knew that they were coming to see him he knew what they want they want him to do this they wanted him to do that no So eventually oh yeah that's why eventually you know he stopped stopped using the gift and they oh yeah the world the world was amazed that William Brown he had this gift then all of a sudden oh you just get up and just talk and preach and that was it yeah why because now he was he was he what was the gift for why did why did God give him these gifts to do this to do that discern the thoughts and intention of the heart amen the sign in the hand it was to get our attention and the prophet of God and he was instructed by the angel get the people to believe amen believe what to believe the word amen and to believe the word that would give us rapturing faith not just to believe them for down in the previous ages but to believe what God was doing in this hour and what God was revealing this hour and it would give us the faith we need because brother the faith that they need they did what what what what God ordained him to do in that age and like Luther with his justification sanctification Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit but where was the resurrection and the rapture amen it was all pointing to the resurrection and Rapture and then God would raise up a generation that he would give that faith of Resurrection to and the rapture brother the other age just didn't do it oh they had the faith to move on and oh they believed the resurrection was up the road the Rapture was up there somewhere well that it's coming but for us we believe it's here amen what God did is to show us that it's here amen it's revealed to us the faith we need look up that's what the Bible says when you oh see this see this all to finally it says look up amen well they were they were asked to believe this that's to believe that now there was a generation that would come on the scene and he's asking us to look up what poor Resurrection what it's going to be that real yes and the Rapture we're going to be caught up yes there's going to be a generation that's going to be cut up Grace please in the name of Jesus I pray Grace that we are not not get religious but get spiritual amen God bless you before we go into the hear another brother minister of the word tonight this turning our Bibles to Galatians chapter 2. the book of Galatians chapter 2. amen praise the Lord oh we should go on all you're going to do is read the scripture and then you can minister amen but we're going to get another brother to minister to us tonight and uh just to bear in mind too that I mentioned about what we're going to deal with in when it comes to the word because right near right getting that getting here the end of the the ministry as it were getting near the end of the of the revealed word and getting near the end of the word of the revelation of Grace brother I said oh yes there's going to be judicarians yes Jesus dealt with it and really I don't trip the ages they had to dealt with judaistarian spirits that's right they didn't all stay with the word some were there just to betray it some were there to just to just to find fault with it amen and the father of God did warn us concerning that judaistarian spirit that was coming upon the Earth that judaistarian spirit that we would have to deal with in these last days amen oh yes he said now he said do you get what I'm meaning he said when the goal sign comes on all right he said when the thing is inspired to you and God makes it known like he did back there all right he said but until he does it we got a bunch of judaistarians impersonating amen so we're going to be dealing with judaistarian spirits brother so they're they're preaching the what what we think are what are preaching the message they're preaching this they're preaching that amen but is it giving us the faith that we need amen you can have the revelation of this you can have the the understanding of this but what about faith faith comes by hearing the word amen and brother what God has done in every age was the word he revealed this part of the word that part of the word to give them the faith they needed now he's revealed that portion of the word to give us the faith we need amen oh yes thank God for justification thank God for sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit oh brother but where where are they the Bible God said the gifts are right there he said he said if we need them if we need them now Pentecost they just add them that's it that's all they focused on was was the baptism and the gift the baptism the gift the gifts the gifts but now brother God want us to focus now on the resurrection and the rapture thank God for the baptism thank God for the gifts amen sure if we got faith for the baptism faith for the gifts of the Spirit surely we're moving into a faith for the resurrection and the faith for the rapture we're moving on and that's what God's requiring of us believe us thou this amen again do I light you amen that when he came in his first coming to reveal himself as the resurrection and the rapture and Jesus was laid down his life but he picked it up again resurrection and then he went up in a rapture now he's revealing the same in Mrs Jesus Christ is bright Hallelujah that he is the resurrection and he is the rapture they preached on it for 2 000 years but now there's a generation believing the resurrection deleting the Rapture praise the name of the Lord amen not just a Doctrine but an experience praise the Lord father thank God so I trust thank God for the experience that they had in in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts of the Spirit praise the Lord thank God for the the experience that we're having in the resurrection please in the name of Jesus please come on let's believe for the resurrection let's believe for the Rapture there are those that are believing for God to do this God to do that brother God's God's waiting for you to believe for the resurrection let me say it again the prophet of God said that that the Lord is waiting on you yeah we think oh we're waiting on the Lord for this waiting on the Lord no no no God has given us the word to give us the faith for the resurrection now he's waiting on you to believe it and to claim it God help us amen brother Luther claimed the faith that God gave him Wesley claimed the faith that God gave him the Pentecostals and the other claimed the faith that God gave them amen now I trust proclaiming the faith that God has given us through the ministry of a prophet praise the Lord and brothers not just to say oh thank God he sent the prophet and he revealed the mysteries of the word this mystery that mystery you know my brother it was to give us the faith amen so that as you could go from the mystery as it were to the reality of the Resurrection how many believe really believe we're in the hour of the Resurrection really believe we're in the hour of the Rapture I tell you brother sister it's time to go it's time to go God help us and in the book of Galatians chapter 2 . in verse 19 he said for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ I trust that's your faith I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God if it's Christ in you it's his faith let go and let Jesus at his way let go and let Jesus have control you have your thoughts your words and your Deeds amen and he said in the Life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain amen the righteousness didn't come by the law no no it was in the flesh but not in the soul in your flesh but not in your heart amen but through Christ Hallelujah Christ did what he did he laid down his leg picked it up again came back to share it with you and me not in our flesh but in our hearts amen from the inside out there's too many they got it outside but they don't have it from the inside amen by the grace of God let's make sure that the life that we live is from the inside of it it's the anointing on the inside of the inside we're not going by the intellectual knowledge of the word intellectual letter of the word we're going by the spiritual revelation of the word amen that is God and Christ in us the horrible glory amen so brother let's let's make our calling and our election sure stay with the word and we're going to go into air oh a ministering brother of minister uh in the States never Burley oh Brody Williams Oh okay the Lord blesses the ministry of the word to our hearts amen so let's let's be in the spirit and pray the grace of God by the spirit to minister to us please in the name of Jesus hear the word amen it's not going to say well I'm going to see what the brother is going to say listen to the word faith comes by hearing the word amen so brother oh well it's by the prophet yes but the prophet of God said that the bride has got a fight full ministry someone asked the prophet that and they said brother round does the bride have a Ministry he says sure and he said it's in the bride now and I believe it's in the in the in the revelation of the seals somewhere that questions and answers said they asked the prophet that he said yes and he had he identified the five-fold ministry so please let's not just think oh yes we just got to hear Brother Branham no no there's a five-fold Ministry God has said in the church for this purpose for this reason amen and for the perfecting of the Saints by the revealed word of God so make sure there's too many brothers too many around the world too many around the message that by dirt but they won't don't recognize the ministry I'll tell you they won't be in the resurrection they won't be in the rapture not by any means because God has a plan God's got a purpose and God's got a pattern and brother it includes the fightful ministry oh well it's just the prophet no yes it does but he came and gave the word to the Prophet The Prophet came and shared it with the fivefold ministry amen so God help us to stay with the word because God has set in the church for the perfecting of the Saints God help us again in Galatians Chapter 2 and verse 19 for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me I trust that Christ is living in US and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Grace that we'll love one another and give us gift give ourselves to or for one another amen oh yes they did it down Through the Ages I pray that we're willing to do it now I do not frustrate the grace of God for it is righteousness come by if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain but thank God Is by grace not by the law amen so I pray the grace of God to be with us as we go in and hear our brother Minister the word this evening amen God increase our faith for his glory and make sure that we've got the right Spirit and the right attitude amen because there's anything that God's looking for is a right spirit and a right attitude amen and I've met many over the years through this word through this afterwards Obama's 50 years for me for about 50 years that I've been into the word into the message and I've had to deal with many spirits oh yes as I've said one time I was in a messy church and had an altar call people were coming up around the Altar and worshiping and praying and and there was two that came up and they were on my left side there and uh and I said oh they came up and they were worshiping and they were stood around the altar with a lot of the other believers and I looked down and I said oh Lord I said they don't believe people were shocked when I re mention it to them oh yeah I said no I said we don't believe I said they got a religious spirit but they don't have the Holy Spirit in them so make sure you got the holy spirit in you and in your heart don't just come with don't come with a religious spirit come with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to teach you the holy spirit is going to give you the word amen the holy spirit is going to increase your faith by the grace of God he said the prophet said again the hours coming when right and wrong is made manifest right he said it shows in the Christian today it shows in the churches today it shows in the people today he said I'm he said I know it's that I'm all in you long but he said I want to get this to you amen if you're going to hear the word recognize the word act on the word but make sure it's the Holy Ghost In You from your heart not in your flesh the prophet of God said you can you can experience God in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell why because you got to have it in your heart amen so make sure that what God has given you what God is is giving you and what amen what you're believing is out of the heart not out of not by the letter of the word but by the spiritual revelation of the word amen and again he said we are in the end time now the Lord bless you richly I get started on that and forget about time and we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity amen brother I trust that we're sensing now that we're fading more and more and more into eternity he said because he said God is sovereign and we see here what David done in the scriptures he said reading he said verse Chronicles 13 and he says but God does not give us merits on good intentions no no he said there's only one way to serve God and that's by doing his will at his command and he said and God being Sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it he said the way to do it that does it the way that he knows the right way to do it and he said that makes me feel good but he said one great thing again about God he has not left us without knowing what's the truth out of it and how to do it God knows what's best God knows when to do it and how to do it amen we have our ideas but God knows amen so I trust by the grace of God that you're influenced by God you're not influenced by a religious spirit which is the devil put your influenced by God Amen so the grace of God be with us as we go into hear the word amen for the glory of God amen they say the hour is coming when right and wrong is made manifest it shows in Christian the Christian today it shows in the churches today it shows in the people today I'm holding you long but if I want to to get this to you amen so as God get into you the word personally amen so he's got us dealing with you in a very personal way and you are dealing with God in a personal way amen not just religion oh yeah he's God so I you know but I'm on this and I'm that yeah well you got to recognize him as your father and your yourself as the Son of God as the daughter of God Amen you have a relationship with God Amen to God be the glory remember he said he said we are at the end of all things now brother if if it was the end of all things back then what is it now amen he said again he said the church life is at the end he said the normal church now this may stick just a little bit but the church Colonel the Esau Church she has come to her hand amen the spiritual church is at its end and he said she's coming to the end oh God he said Look Back Yonder when she started with Luther shook down the spiritual then with Wesley came to sanctification then with Pentecost the Holy Ghost and now at the end time the spirit of Christ so in the church it's doing the same works that he did right back to it and again and ready for the church and Christ to unite amen and the coming of the Lord Jesus and the resurrection of the Dead we are at the end time and Jesus told us as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man amen so brother are you are you more and more conscious and more and more aware that we are at the end of all things right at the end but we don't look down we look up to many that to the end means to look down know what we look up for the resurrection and the rapture please we've we've got to focus more and more on the resurrection and the Rapture because brother if we're going to experience it we've got to believe it if we got exp yes if we're going to experience it yes believe it yes but we've got to go forth and live for the resurrection live for the rapture previous ages they lived for what God was doing in their age are we living for what God is doing in this age how many are living for the resurrection how many are living for the rapture oh brother God help us amen this thing only believe all things are possible and our brothers will move us to the hearing of the word amen the stand is singing [Music] [Music]

and get into the scriptures and uh see what the Lord will do for us this evening I was up in uh Toledo working this week and I was just thinking yesterday as I was working at want to go to Paul's house at his house and uh a little thought come on my mind it sounds a little strange but it just won't leave so I I guess I'll preach it y'all my title is what the devil has in his mind what the devil has in his mind I was just it just come out of nowhere where I ain't gonna say it come out of nowhere I don't believe God just give us stuff out of nowhere but I just uh I said well I just been studying on it and looking at some things that's what we're just Minister on by God's grace what the devil has in his mind you know many times we talk about what God has in his mind and uh but sometimes I guess it's going to do us good to look to see what the devil got in his mind I believe we already know what the devil has in this mind I do believe that so I don't think we'll be ministering nothing new uh that you haven't heard already but we'll just see what the Lord will do amen let's go to Isaiah chapter 14. Isaiah chapter 14. this is a very familiar scripture let's go to verse 12. he said how thou falling from heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which deadest weaken the Nations for thou have said and thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit amen you may be seated amen what the devil has in his mind you know uh we thank God for his grace of the mercy allowing us to be here this evening and uh we just want to share a few things with you because we certainly is in the present time amen it's a lot of negative things you could talk about but you have asked yourself what does good does it does talking about negative it's no faith in it there's no virtue in it there's no help in it amen so we want to talk about deposited things because I believe sometimes if you talk about negative stuff too much it's like you're giving the devil Glory giving him some Victory and we don't want to do that I remember um I can't I hope I got this story right I can't remember what war it was um uh my pastor was telling me about it one time how many of you ever heard I think this lady I think it's called Tokyo Rose anybody ever heard of that Tokyo Rose from understanding uh when the war was going on I think with the Japanese and so forth Tokyo Tokyo Rose was a woman on a radio announcer and on the radio broadcast whenever something goes bad American dies something like that they just broadcast it on the radio another American down this wasn't going to happen this way don't happen but that was a design to keep for her to keep talking making statements like that so people could hear it to discourage them amen it just kind of reminded me just recently when uh this war was going on but I was still going on with Ukraine you hear all kind of stuff on the news and and this and Russia is doing this and so while it looks pretty bad for Ukraine and then I got friends in Ukraine and uh you know when you hear what the news saying you say you shake your head for Ukraine this and that and the other but I called one of my friends he said brother don't listen to that nonsense on y'all uh uh broadcast he said we fighting amen he said we were doing what we got to do I said well praise the Lord so sometimes when you can hear certain things you really need to dig in and see what is truth and what is not truth because the things that you listen to it actually influences you can we say man so but we want to hear about positive things it also reminds me I remember I went to a museum one time and they had a display in the museum and it's called Uh psyops and uh and it was kind of interesting to me and I began to read some of the uh the statements that they had upon there and it was kind of amazing and this is uh it's been many many years ago so I probably can't remember all of it but they had a plane that America has it is designed for psyops which psyops means psychological it means psychological warfare and in this plane I was reading the listings they had everything in there that they could tap into wherever they whoever they're fighting they could tap into their radio communications and they can their radio waves and it's just a plane just totally designed for psyops I said that's interesting and then uh so when they can break in somebody else's uh radio thing and start talking to the people and trying to tell them you need to surrender you need to do this and we're going to kill you and then it can mess with people mind and then they had a display on there where uh This Plane would drop leaflets and uh when the soldiers that they was fighting against this plane would drop leaflets down there and tell them we're gonna drop this bomb on you and the Folger that walking would pick it up and they would read it and then they keep on walking then they'll drop another flyer then after we drop this bomb we're gonna drop this one and then they will pick it up and they would read it and then they would literally drop another flyer and said don't try to dig into the ground because the bomb that's going to come out with that it's called The Bunker Buster and they begin to describe how far it could go down in the ground say if you go down in the ground we're going to drop this one on you and then all of a sudden they just start dropping their weapons and they start raising their hand just from leaflets they didn't even have to shoot a weapon they were defeated in their mind so it was over with that's why God sent us a message today to explain to us the greatest battles that his fault is in the mind because once you lose in the mind everything else Falls right into place can we say man you see that was the tactic that the Philistines used on the children of Israel and he saw and uh Saul was afraid soldiers was afraid but if you really look at that story uh God had all of that laid out perfectly because you remember when they wanted a king they wanted somebody to fight for them stand for them so God let a war come to let them show this is the man you choose to fight for you but he just as scared as you are so God allowed that to happen so he could bring David on the scene can we say praise the Lord but you remember Goliath he defeated them not through in the spirit amen not shooting the arrow nothing he defeated them with words if you say Amen they lost the battle in their mind and they was totally defeated but when David came the words that Goliath was speaking couldn't penetrate David's mind to David had an experience he just pushed it all out so when David looked at Goliath he already seen Goliath defeated so that's what we ought to do amen by God's grace because he said that we are more than conquerors our interview been defeated a long time ago at Calvary he done it all but we have to believe that can we say praise the Lord but you know Satan uh he he is a bluffer right yeah and he's very good at extremely good at it so we have to understand what Satan tactic is so now I'm going to talk about some things and uh this uh uh but then we'll flip it back around because sometimes I know you can preach sometimes about something on one side too much and you'll be like hmm come on bring it back Branch it out so I believe in the balance amen and I remember years ago I used to hear people talk on Prophecy Brothers preach on prophecy about what's going to happen to America and all these things and they taught me everything that was going to happen to America and you can leave a service depressed you're telling me everything that's going to happen but then but you gotta you gotta remember you got to bring it in what the prophet said before it wasn't born could fall he's going to take his bride away so that balances it out yeah she got it coming but let me know what's going to happen to me I'm gonna give it up I'm coming up out of here amen so I don't want to be depressed say man that's the same as correcting your children you correct them not to depress them is that right when you correct them then you got to give them a ray of Hope yeah you did wrong all right you got to acknowledge you did wrong you shouldn't have done this but then you know after you well sometimes you gotta sprinkle after you do your business then encourage it just tell them you're better than that you know I expect more to you than that I'll listen to it brother I can't remember who just told me recently he said man sometimes when his parents used to tell him I'm disappointed in you he said definitely worse than the weapon yeah see I'm disappointed in you those things cut and they hurt but yet leave encouragement so I believe God had left us with a message of encouragement this message comes to encourage us not to depress us so when people around the message I'm not trying to be funny when they're living in a realm of depression something is wrong they need to check their Revelation amen they need to check and see what they believe because God did not call us haven't given us a spirit of fear can we say man but power in love in the sound mind that's what God gives it so anything opposite of that is what the devil gives can we say praise the Lord now what's interesting about this scripture here we talking about what the devil has in his mind which we know uh we know the words our thoughts expressed before we become worried is actually a thought but then when you speak it and it comes word then it manifests whatever your thoughts was we understand that how the prophet went over this million times God said let there be light and there was light and it come to pass but you remember before Earth and all of this coming to existence it was all in God's mind but now it's just being played out and it being manifested amen so Satan had thoughts also in his mind what he wants to do amen Satan thought did not start here on Earth Satan thoughts started when he was in heaven is that right and that's what we actually just read Satan telling what I'm going to do but what's so interested when when you look at the scripture and you go to the message Satan the prophet said God Eden was established in righteousness Satan Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin God is righteous and God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and Satan establishment is in sin and religious sin I like how he just adding it in in sin religious sin he said now notice how he deceived his deception as he said he would then he said he promised to do this then he refers to Isaiah so what Satan was saying in Isaiah I'm going to be like the MOHAI Satan was making a promise otherwise I promise you this is what I'm gonna do God got promises and the devil got promises but the only difference is is God promises is to bless you Satan promises to bless himself that's the only difference can we say Amen even when you look in the scripture Satan saying I will be like the most high I will Ascend it to Heaven I will exalt my Throne I will sit upon the mouth all of those are Satan's eyes but then when you go to the Book of Ezekiel God got eyes God said I will take away your stoning heart I I'll give you a new spirit God said I would do this I will call you from the nation but the only difference Satan's eyes is for himself but God's eyes is for you God said I'm going to do this for you I'm going to take care of you I'm Gonna Change you but Sadie said all of my eyes is for me so that's the difference then he says here he said now he said now now what I'm looking at here I listened to ask the prophet ministers and speak he's actually telling us what's in Satan's mind he's telling us amen now now how many of you here got Facebook oh come on I ain't gonna preach against you you got Facebook raise your hand on your Facebook when you hit the home button what comes up what's on your mind right yeah just well I promise you after the service over You're Gonna Go before you post something on Facebook that's what the title is on the top what's on your mind then you start posting stuff and everything you're posting is what's on your mind right praise the Lord so when people put things on Facebook they're just telling what's on their mind whether it's good or bad they're telling what's on their mind and it's so sad how bad Facebook don't ask you to God people like to post their problems on Facebook I'm going through this y'all pray for me and this and I'm going I'm going through this and then all of a sudden they might go to a meeting one day they don't kind of in a in a good mood then they go to a meeting somebody just walk up to him praying for you let's say ain't nothing wrong with me no that post that you put on them I'm praying for you are you okay then you get offended I'm a strong Christian not me don't be no you put it there they're just responding back what was on your mind what you posted that's the only thing they do people put so much of their information on Facebook to it's really sad to people know you that don't actually know you Facebook I guess I'm Gonna Leave Facebook alone because that's some people's Church and they get offended when you talk about it but let me tell you something friends them things could be used right those things could be used wrong it's just the bottom line of the whole matter but anyway back to the scripture here now I want you to notice is this also the prophet says in Satan's Eden he said now he said he would exalt himself above the most high he will Ascend above the clouds and the stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high then he says and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats so with Satan had in his heart in his mind when he was in heaven when he promised because the prophet said there he promised what he was going to do but now he has succeeded he said he has certainly had a marvelous success and carrying out his threats but now he's going to explain how he did it he said by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age so for Satan to fulfill his promise he has to attack God's promise and that's what he done and that's what he said the value he said he had explained away in every age the value of God's promised were to that Aid so whatever God promises in the age That's what Satan is going to attack to get the people to disbelieve what God has promised in that age can we say Amen say they gonna attack you today and tell you and argue with you about Noah build art right why do you want to do that for give me some amen then he ain't interested in that cause that don't pass so he ain't worried about that but what Satan is going to attack now he's going to try to show you that God is building the bride can we say Amen how many of you believe God is building the bribe God has him right God is creating his own bride how do God create his own bride by the word that's why when you go to the book of Ephesians he said he's going to have a church without spottarenka he cleansing her by the washing of the water of the word but what is the purpose to present her to himself so the bride that God wants he's created her for himself to present her to himself can we say Amen but Satan want to explain away every promise that God has done in the age he want to try to explain it away from the people that's why he get people to say ain't no such thing God's gonna send a gentile Prophet that's not really true that's God didn't really promise that but God did promise this it depends on where you're looking at so Satan want to explain all presence day promises that God has given us today he want to explain it away from the people like he said and he want to explain the value of it can we say Amen see people don't understand the value of the word of God the value why God's son the prophet is a value in that commission is that right it's wealth in there it's a pro it's a purpose for that so when we catch those Revelations even like uh uh you know me myself you got all kind of different attacks on the message and all of these sort of things it don't bother me people get offended when people say things against the message and stuff it don't bother me what people say because they can't take it from me there's not a devil out of hell can take this message from Burley Williams you can't explain it out of me because then nobody explained it in me can we say Amen I've been born again I don't care what I can't explain it don't matter to me I know what I believe so the devil can't shake me from none of those things the people say I just don't believe the message I said well you're unbelievable didn't they get mad how can you tell me I'm a Believer I said well God promise you you'll send a message in this day God promised that the Bible you said you read and God promised it so if you don't believe that that makes you an unbeliever [Applause] of maturing this is maturing time but you got to remember we have to go through things in life to help us to mature now let me just keep reading this he said he succeeded he has success in carrying out his stretch he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threat now let me go on down it says also in God's power transformation he says Satan's purpose from eating was to make his own self an Eden exalt himself above the stars of God God would worship Him Sons would worship him he said and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this brought it into the church he's which I won't go in details he said any of you listen to these texts know about it that's exactly that I will living in and you remember in God at this evil age he said there's never been another age until this age where Satan is called the god of this evil age the reason why he's called to God because all the way from Genesis he doesn't succeed into this age that he has actually become God of this evil Aid so he has fulfilled what was in his mind way back up there in Heavens he has successfully fulfilled it today but we see how the prophet going into details how he did it can we say man he says Satan has done it through educational programs now normal preaching ain't nobody gonna say oh come on that's nonsense educational program yeah that's exactly what he has done through school through education amen through seminaries through preachers Satan has actually have been able to do these things so the prophet just really just breaking it down what was in Satan's mind and how he done these things then he says he said a better fit a better this a better debt he said not knowing all the time they're walking straight into death blinded leading the blind blind leaders of the Nations blind leaders of science blind leaders of the church blind leading the blind Jesus said let them alone they'll both fall in the ditch he began to break down everything house Satan see you and I we just know and Isaiah he said how I'm going to exalt myself above God how I'm going to do all these things but God sent us to mentioned this in time to break it down how he's able to succeed to get his desire fulfilled now you and I would never how many you don't find many places preaching against education like the bride does can we say man but we know there's a balance education is all right as long as you don't get in the way of God because you got some smart people and they don't let that intellect get in their way with God Paul was a smart man extremely smart man then the disciples weren't a smart man so God could use both smart people and not so smart people as long as they got the Holy Ghost amen he's their teacher to teach them and guide them what to say and what to do so these things are okay now you know Satan Satan don't brag so much how he had succeeded because one one deceit that the world normal nominal don't look at that the biggest deceit actually today it is through religion see many talk about uh seeing on the streets and seeing out here in prostitution and all this stuff but they don't understand what religious sin is Satan is here behind that so deep that's what people don't catch I was talking to an end well I was talking to my my niece and I made a statement to her I said you're looking for the devil in the wrong place I said you always looking out on the streets and stuff you don't know he stands behind pulpits foreign something just dropped in my heart but I want to read this first you know Satan unbrack so much and he's so thankful of his eating in the world when they have their little gathering and somebody don't make some kind of achievement uh some accomplishment you know they give a toast [Music] you know what I'm talking about they say we would like to give a toast to our brother here accomplishment hit the glasses together what a great accomplishment when Satan brought forth his great accomplishment he said I got to give a toast and he did the prophet says right here in Christ and mystery God revealed he said the Bible in Revelation said this great City ring over all the kings of the Earth said she was a what is that he said a woman that claims to be a lady and commits fornication she had a cup in her hand of toast [Applause] to the world so that cup in her hand come and drink up this cup of my great achievement that I have accomplished to deceive you a toast to the world when I read that I said that ain't nothing but the truth filled with the filthiness of the Abominations of a fornication and she had daughters the Protestant churches to everyone come out of her with her same false doctrines baptism he just began to break all these things down all of these things that was in Satan's mind he's actually displaying it through false Ministries through false religion all of it is coming out now and we seed it right now let me just backtrack a minute because I'm not finished but I want to explain something that just fell in my heart and this is going to be to young people I had something to just recently happen and uh it just very disturbing when you many take it lightly when the prophet talk about comic books many people take that very very lightly he said comic books setting children's mind up for a blast that's what he said you know everybody don't read comic books so the devil devil has done in this day they have taken see now I come from them times I was a cartoonist I lived and breathed comic books I actually used to draw out of the comic books better than the man that drawed it himself but being an artist this is what I know when you draw something you come under inspiration why you drawing that so I had to get real inspired to draw these gruesome looking pictures and stuff but I called it art and it was beautiful but I had actually entered into a realm of inspiration to be able to draw that so his spirits behind it right now everybody don't read comic books so what the devil has done I guess in the last couple of years he took what was in comic books and made him live people Spider-Man movies Superman Adventures she said they no food he knows you know people ain't gonna read comic books because it ain't no interest in many people but then he thought putting Billboards up coming soon Thor coming to get some people mind can we say Amen now to some people it don't affect to some people it do but I'm here to tell you the spirits behind those things are actually real they are real now uh I know myself I preach a lot about what you watch what you see what you hear affects you I preach all those things like that a lot and I know sometimes people get tired of me saying it but I'm not gonna get tired of saying it because I know the importance of it amen because people just don't really understand how Spirits work sometimes let me explain something friends is very crucial to know without a shadow of a doubt you were born again you're full of the Holy Ghost because I'm gonna show you a big that the devil has done and I'ma read to you what the prophet said and he's expressing what's in his mind Satan is so all of this music and all this garbage they got out here on the internet what you think commercials are for they just pop up out of nowhere and all of them got music behind them what you think that is fun to get in your subconsciousness do you ever think it's just so amazing you can walk into a restaurant and they play the music you used to listen to yeah Satan ain't no fool he knew exactly what he's doing I have been with Brothers before just recently we went to a restaurant the music was playing he started going and then he called himself yeah oh yeah you remember this sign says music is the only thing can enter your subconscious without your permission science says that but look at the deceit Satan is expressing everything wanting people to worship him I want to be like the most high he's doing it today let me read this to you I know I changed the service a little bit but that's okay because this just dropped in my heart to tell your young people don't play with the wrong stuff if it's questionable leave it alone so is the question come up you see I'll just leave it on because who's throwing that question to you that's God warning you right there just leave it alone walk away don't experiment don't explore just leave it alone man right this isn't questions and answers they asked a question about uh where did the spirits go that was in that man that the maniac of gallery now he said and that man well you know he's talking about how the man hung around twos making scriptures clothes off he said them Spirits are still here he said now and that man with some of these spirits that was cast out in the swine at Galleria now he's talking about the man that was uh gonna kill him he referring to him first and he's now he's identifying some of them Spirits was in that man because you remember he told but a man said he could have kept me just as real easy as he wanted to he's strong he could have kept me but the thing that I love about this so much when he came up to the prophet you remember God told him not to move then he said he said since you challenged us uh challenged God you're the one gonna bow down but you as a preacher before that he beat him up [Music] can you say Amen but you remember before this man in the Bible for they got through a mini tried to bind him many tried to change him but when he met Jesus that's when he spoke so now when that spirit that man came to brother he knew there's a representative of Jesus Christ was on the earth can we say Amen so it's the same parallel but he says here is some of those poor people out here in these insane institutions beating their heads against paddled by ourselves remember Devils never die Devils always live but there will be a time where Devils will have to die they will become totally annihilated but now they are alive he said and they work from generation two generation upon human beings some of them in the form of cancer some is in the form of epilepsy Psalm is in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerfulness until they can get into a person they have to operate through a person which brings to another thought he said that the Holy Spirit covers the earth but it is almost helpless until it gets into you and to me and this is what he said God is depending on you and I depending on what Tabernacles he can get in so he can also display himself [Applause] depending on us did he say s the Earth he said it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate now here's what I want to get to he said the devil wants to take us over to operate unto him so when he gets the mild form he starts in sin he's going to talk about how Satan maneuvers to try to do something small in somebody's life and keep them there he says this if he can hold them just in a righteous man he ain't talking about a righteous man if the devil can just put something in their life they could even be a righteous man he said a good man and just let him go ahead try to be a try to be good like that if he could hold him like that until he's dead that's just just what he wants to do he got it because no matter how righteous you are how good you are how moral you are how clean you are how Earnest you are you'll never get to Heaven until you're born again [Applause] so the devil can have somebody living righteous clean pure but it could be a sin that's stuck there in their life where they couldn't go no further than that to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and say if I could just keep them there until they die they still comes to me that's why I make the statement make sure you know you were born again because when God is sealed in the devil is sealed out but Temptation still come but you got something inside of you to help you fight those Temptations amen people want to say you don't know what I'm going through it's hard you can be born again full of the Holy Spirit still you go through things still you got trial still you got bad but you've got something inside of you to take you through them can we say man go back to the parable when they talk about two houses the rain descended the floods came give me a second man and beat upon the house did it then that one was built on Sand then they talked about the other one built on the Rock but they got the same problems rain descended floods came beat on both houses but the only difference wouldn't fail one did so Christians we go through same problems in similar fashions that the world go through but it's just the only difference we stand and falling I don't say they fall they keep falling because we already falling these things are important praise the Lord the devil can just keep you there hold him like that until he's dead that's why so many people are so religious now the devil makes them so religious he know they ain't got no Holy Ghost but he keeps them so religious and they'll say well I don't do this and I don't do that I don't do this so I'm okay none of us okay until you feel with the Holy Ghost then you're okay until then we just religion I know that sounds a little blunt but it's time to be blunt [Applause] cause many get discouraged because they see people falling why are they falling because the house wasn't built right when God builds a house it won't fall it might need remodeling and some repairs on it but it won't fall can we say praise the Lord amen that one dropped in my heart I had to share that with your friends Satan is up to no good when I say no good no good how many you know what no good is no good his whole thinking his whole makeup his whole desire is no good and people underestimate in John 10 even though it talks about a thief but we know it refers to Satan also it says Jesus said I'm the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved shall go in and out and find Pastor he said but the thief come is not I just like the way Jesus worded it otherwise he telling you the things cometh not in other words he got nothing that's on his mind but this the still to kill and destroy other words he got no other motive interjected but kill still and Destroy now you say how could you apply that to Satan being the thief you know what the the what it says he come to do kill still destroy all you got to do is compare that to Peter when he said that the devil going around like a roaring lion seeking who he may devour that word devour means destroy so we still talking about the same person that's the only thing the devil got in his mind kill still destroyed want to steal your joy destroy your life and kill you now I'm gonna say something friends when it comes to this message when a person been in this don't come in contact with the word of Life the trueness of this message and the devil knows that the devil loves it when he can get somebody to fall in this message he loves it more for somebody to fall in the message than out there in the number of the churches [Applause] he loves it more he said why you say that brother birdie I said it to say this the devil we'll get more Glory for himself and a backslider than just killing somebody oh I know you're thinking out of all of the problems Samson caused those Philistines why didn't they just immediately kill him so we got him now to kill him no they want to kill him they wanted to make sport mockery to be able to display him where's your power now oh look at you weak you're nothing now that was more glory for the devil than having Sampson in that situation the same thing today if you can have somebody backslitting and the devil can get people the point and they went to church all those years look at them now I guess God ain't real I guess this message ain't real I guess the Holy Ghost can't keep you I might as well go ahead and live any kind of way too they fail they fail Satan like yes yes those are facts that's why I preach on now more than ever you must be born again which you don't become teachings people don't really want to hear no more yeah come on give me some seals brother break some seals down to him all of that comes with it but where's your foundation when you can have all of this knowledge I know many know how to clear revelation on the Deep mysteries of God and therefore not singing it friends that's why I got to be here first must be born again [Applause] the devil what's in his mind Jesus said when he speaks in Luke 8 about the seeds he said those by the wayside uh they that here you should then cometh the devil and taking away the word out of their hearts I like the way he put it they hear the word he said but then come the devil and take the word out of their hearts because the devil knows if he can get the word out of a person's heart he got him you can have the word in your heart and not be born again but on your way can we say amen and because you're keeping the word before you're in loving the word you're on your way there to get the Holy Ghost but if the devil start getting you to doubt the word snatch that out of your heart he said I got you can we say praise the Lord if Peter 5 and 8 be so will be villager because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour to me that's from strong reading it telling you what's in his mind his very purpose he ain't looking for nobody to love Satan ain't looking for nobody to love he looking for somebody to devour that's what's in his mind can we say Amen then when it come to job God went right to the point when Satan came he says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord Satan came also among them and the Lord said it to say once come has died God already know where he come from God already what his purpose was I'm glad God actually so Satan can reply so you and I know what's in Satan's mind then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth walking from walking up and down in it but what is his purpose now God's going to bring God exactly what's in his mind Satan just told God oh minding my business going up and down to and from you know just enjoying the scenery that God will go right through what's in his mind this is what God Said God said and say how do I considered him I servant job he went right what was the Satan man [Applause] look how Satan put it you know just walking around uh God said no I know you're naughtiness I know what's in your mind and I'm gonna call it out you considered a joke hello you remind me of some of these slick Mars when you actually what are you doing oh are you doing that oh I'm just you know standing over here no you're not you're scoping foreign looking for a girl looking at her conscience let's see is she going through something so they can spread their nice little words I call them predators [Applause] he said brother birdy that is pretty cold no that's what a predator does a lion might be the strongest they say of the Jungle but he's smart too he looked for a weak wildebeest [Applause] [Applause] and that's what predators do I went straight to Satan's mind you can you considered my servant job there is nothing like him in the Earth [Music] perfect outright man wasn't that feared God and it sewage evil I wish I could be building that congregation conversation God is telling Satan that say I say wait I can just see Satan when God telling him that God lock him in the earth safe yeah right I can change that God just bragging on Joe and like the prophet said could he do that about you I'll say yes God can't brag on this bride why can God brag on his bride because the prophecy went forth she will not fall like Eve had fallen so God can brag on his bride so she ain't gonna fall do whatever you want to do to us say she ain't gonna fall I just love it Satan says here Satan answered the Lord and said the job feel God for not this is picture here friend job is minding his business enjoying his wife just just having a good time and he don't even know God and Satan talking about it you and I don't understand what we're going on in the other realms them conversation still goes on they still go on saying I can make nothing fall guards no you can't all right can't do it so you say all right move the head you go move it I'll move go ahead I preached on his years ago and I remember preaching on removing the Hedge that wasn't the title but I used that statement because you got to catch the impact of how much courage and faith God had in job he had so much faith in job till he was willing to move his protection from job and prove to the devil job can beat you without me helping you helping you [Applause] that's why that's why everything's going wrong with pressure now got to move the hedges from the bride and telling Satan she ain't gonna fall she don't need me to help cause I'm in her she got what's inside of her that's going to whip you safe so I'm just gonna stand back I'm just gonna watch that's the confidence God has in his bride friends have not made it hey he said hath not Thou made an edge about it see how Satan understood this brother yeah he already know the boundaries but God done he do the same thing to you and me he know he know all about you [Applause] and about his house and about all that he hath on every side Satan knew your family Satan knew he renewed I can't even touch the children Casa Joe he didn't touch his house because of job that's why it's so important for us parents that make sure we're in favor with God doing what we're supposed to do in our whole got to take care of your children God will take care of your house you just stay right with God he does it that's your proof right there even when Satan children went out and party I mean children wouldn't party Joe prayed for he said pre-advisor they might sin and the prophet said that's what a good parents should do you never know what your children are going to be getting to involved but you can always pray and keep them before God say God I commit them to you I've never seen a time like it is now where marriages is being destroyed never seen a time like this but it's happening because of pressure let me tell you I don't understand why people think their marriage can survive without communication your relationship with God can't survive without communication he wants to fellow shoot with you he wants to talk to you he wants to communicate with you and if that be so that God that also is in the natural and I'm talking about communication not complaints communication I'm talking about communicating talking to one another it makes marriage healthy what are you talking to one another [Applause] long time people don't understand why would I say something it hurts my wife feeling when I say something to hurt my husband feeling it just really tears them up and I said that's good hey what you mean that's good that's good what's bad when there's no feelings then you'll become indifferent when she say something to you whatever you say something here whatever just rolls right off that's bad but when it can hurt at least know that there's feelings still there [Applause] you see what you said hurt me and if you got finished I didn't mean to what was now you can communicate about it foreign [Applause] gotta communicate but Chad I might say I'm I would close the note because it ain't working let's just give some stories I just give some stories how many you ever read this quote I probably don't preached it here but I say it again it's one of my favorites when that little girl boy left her and she kept screaming Johnny I know Johnny loves me anybody ever read that quote I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny loves me you gotta remember what the prophet said he heard her he broke her heart he said but then she formed herself in that world she made that she was he was married to another girl but still she said I know Johnny loves him I know Johnny left she created that world I think president stage of my Ministry or ever present from the president ever present water from The Rock the prophet said there's enough power in you in me you can go create your own private world and live in it he said but there's if it wasn't a law to it you could do it that power is in you now I'm here to tell you you also have the power in you to create the wrong world [Applause] create the wrong world as a pastor I see Time After Time After Time dealing with people I just begin to realize they created a wrong world that they live in it and as far as they are concerned everybody else is wrong because they are not in their world [Applause] them things that get you keep and grip you a man can do it a woman can do it you can create those wrong worlds but I like what he said when he was talking to this girl God showed him a vision he said some transaction happened between her and that boy and when he told her she snapped out of that world and then he said now that you're out of that world look towards Calvary so it took a supernatural element of vision to make a snap out of that world and I find that's the same thing it takes something to strike a person's heart to pull them out of the world that they don't form themselves in it because when you get yourself in Worlds you actually become right in your own world and it's right to you [Applause] all right back in April my wife it was a birthday but in February my daughter called me she said Daddy we gonna give Mama a surprise birthday party he said you play a major role in it that's okay she said we gonna do it the fellowship hall at the church and you got to get her there without knowing it's a party actually okay so I can do that that was in February then Here Comes April get close to her birthday but no I see what I did as soon as my daughter told me that I think it was the next day I called my wife I said you know I said this year for your birthday I said I don't need you to make no plan she said Why That's because I made plans she said really see by me knowing my wife because I don't make a lot of plans I'm just kind of a say a spur of a moment person I've been like that all my life but it works out right it just works out I don't know how but it just works out I can just be driving say hey what are you doing she said let's go it just comes out man I'm just not a good planner I just it just but it works the scripture said the footsteps of the righteous is already the Lord [Applause] so I knew say something out of the ordinary we just can't I said make no plans I already got some plan I got what I'm gonna do for you where I'm gonna take you okay so she wouldn't tell her daughter man your daddy got friends for me for the birth for my birthday she said gotta be taking me somewhere fancy she said I need to order me a dress and then my daughter telling me that my daughter she me and my her me and my daughter going back and forth of the conversation she had with them what she started doing so excited he making the world so March call you know everything going good then you're getting close to April where she did not know my daughter lived two hours away my daughter would get a birthday planner sneak down to our church my wife don't even know she's there and they be laying out the fellowship hall everything that's how you that's how you gonna get down

motel so Friday she started moping around sad looking at her little planner I said what's wrong with you nothing let me tell you something friends about marriage life we tell lies sometimes it's a whole brother Burley yep when you know something is wrong with you your husband will watch you okay I'm fine and you know you're not fine no it's okay if you're going through something but your faith

tomorrow you have plans she said so I'm looking at that what she did she don't created a world and stuck in it I'm talking about that Depression was in the room just strong I could just feel it I just went to sleep because it wasn't gonna be nothing I can do to change it so Saturday came got up that's all right gotta be there two o'clock she said okay okay then I see her putting a dress on smiling trying to make herself happy but she was hurt because the children didn't even call and say happy birthday she would do the best she can I just like the Lord have mercy I said I'll be right back she's okay I went to Walmart you know these little Rags most of the black people wear them on their head they call them do rags I want to bought a couple of those I came to the motel I laid them on the bed started opening them up what are you doing because you know I'm bald-headed you don't wear though I said oh this is not for me it's for you she said for me I see off in the blindfold I promise wherever you take me I won't look to forget that's oh no no no no no no [Applause] after the church I wrapped them around the head you know we sat in the car wrapped them around here can you see no see my wife's smart so when I started leaving out of there Motel I knew what she was going to do she was going to calculate every turn and try to map out with a gun so I just circled around the motel that throws everything off I just circled around then we got them driving and she said how long before we get there ain't that long it ain't that long and it was a lot of tension because everything Kate was not doing right this didn't do what they put attention start going and then my daughter said Dad you got to come a little come a little late Mama beside you know when my phone wrong I had kind of blanked out a little minute she was sitting there I said hello she's it what I said oh she did what happened bro what happened she didn't want some money [Applause] yeah let's come a little later I was all right so we went on another scenic route I just circled around to the barrel of where in the world we at then I got close to the church when I was getting close to the church I seen my son pass going to another Direction what oh did I pull up to the church you know we got gravel in our parking lot she said she the bird I hear ground that sound like gravel I said yeah she said what restaurant got ground [Applause] I said Nisha I said we're going to get on some pavement it's just it's a lot of cars out here that was the truth it was a lot of coffee she said all right the people walking by knew that she just sitting there and then you know all right yeah I had pulled her back to the back with a fellowship hall I said you ready they reached out the door I can't you stay right there I'm coming open the door open the door when she put her foot out she said that's grass what kind of restaurant got I said niece just hold on my hand it's okay it's okay [Applause] then we got in the fellowship hall people all around did we got in she's just doing it like this and when I took that rag off it's a fry she was shocked and she just said all of these beautiful people was everywhere she just started walking like a zombie we they had a table for us hugely doing right there then we sat down she's a bird I feel so bad I said you ought to you [Applause] I said look at this world you created now look we've done this for you I said but you let your mind go so many places and you doom and gloom because it's a world you created we do the same thing sister never let the devil come to you and say your husband don't appreciate you [Applause] children don't appreciate you they don't appreciate what I do around this house don't let the devil do that to you because I'm gonna tell you what's going to happen you're gonna start walking around your house I call it zombie mode I'm not saying it to be funny you'll be in your house functioning without an anointing you just go through motions cook he likes doing something they like because you're in your own world nobody appreciates me now because when you feel appreciated you just cook I mean you excited because you you feel appreciated but when you get in that wrong world everything come down same as a man when you don't feel appreciated look at the children look at that they always wanting something buy me this and buy me that but they don't see where it comes from when I have to go through to get it and stuff you're creating the world and when you create another word it cause you to respond wrong you start being negative and bitter yeah because it's your world you created and you think everybody got to come in it all right it ain't right that's not right we ought to live in a world of faith believing the promises of God knowing who we are that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that's where we ought to be living amen amen not in the Doom of Gloom she's all kind of Worlds I can name all different ones I know it's getting a little late there's a different world we create and they be wrong a lot of people create worlds just by looking at services on the internet then they create a world against their own church well our church don't do that look what they do in their Church we don't do that then they come in nature own little world only thing in church is their body not the spirit [Applause] children do that stuff boys do that girls do that create worlds and they be the wrong ones everybody that she got a girlfriend she don't got well she got a boyfriend well that's around the message too I don't know who thought that that homosexual Spirit won't come around message Believers I don't know who thought it won't but that's the main place you to try to come because we got to remember it was so bad they wanted angels as close as you can get their own Angels around the pride of Jesus Christ they wanted them that's how bad it's getting and people don't realize this stuff talk to your children talk to your daughters talk to your son if you got to talk about question they might get tired of hearing but still keep planting them seeds and let them know the program of God your son your daughter God you can you can live a half to have a happy life happy healthy marriage you can have it just just put God before everything yeah sometimes you might seem like it ain't doing it I promise you the scripture said train them on the way they should go praise the Lord the worlds I'm a pastor I've been guilty of creating my own world oh yeah I've done it so I'm not just putting the fingers I can preach from experience Church don't really appreciate me I don't know well they don't want me I just leave I can leave I got no problem either shall create the world creating but then all of a sudden somebody say but apparently oh that service right on the money thank you do you come out of that world I appreciate that you create these worlds man is that correct that's why it's good to appreciate one another tell one another I appreciate you I was just reading the text my wife had sent me she said brother thank God for you being my husband and my pastor that made me feel pretty good you're my husband you're my pastor but these words we create friends they are real may God bless you my everything changed but this is what's in my heart praise the Lord if you got problems I like to tell the young people if you're struggling you got problems don't keep it to yourself talk to your parents be honest with your parents even if it hurt them just just say mama I need to talk let it out don't try to handle it by yourself let it out praise the Lord my son he tell me some things what he used to do when he was a child well I couldn't believe you've done stuff like that he we didn't laugh about it wasn't bad stuff that he did some of this stuff in his imagination he's a daddy he said man he said I know I had got in trouble he said you came home that particular day he said he was eating your dinner see my son my youngest one I always knew when he was in trouble he won't eat and that boy loves to eat whenever he won't come to the dinner table and eat I know he don't got in trouble in school it never fail he loses his appetite because he did when I seen you eat your food when you put that spoon to your mouth you try to send your muscles on your arm [Applause] he's like oh this man gonna kill me [Applause] this is why you crazy he's about daddy he's a one-day user security to give me a whiffing and then one of your friends popped up I said hey you want to go fishing he said then you say yeah let's go he said then you looked at me and said I'm gonna get you when I come back he said that I went in my room and I prayed to God you'll forget pray he I guess God answered his prayer so God got ways to make children pray so God answered his prayer I think I forgot but he could tell me those things but I had to ask myself what did I project to make him feel that way though then I'm some kind of brief father what did I do so I don't want to project nothing like that I want to know yes I'm your father but when I have to correct you I will because that's my job that's my duty and the correction is not to kill you it's to help you could disappearance Duty choose and be like ah yeah no the Bible said let them jump it won't kill them yeah but it won't kill children into nothing but this day is about the psychologist they can play with your emotions huh they they can say some stuff that throw you off track they can do it I just never forget even my son one day he just messed up my son I'm gonna have to I'm not discipline I have to discipline he really did something bad he pleaded so bad Daddy no Daddy Daddy please he starts saying Mercy Mercy he said that Mercy with so much compassion to start bothering my mind [Applause] the scripture come in my mind show no mercy receive no mercy that's our passion that he was it really messed me up but I had to push all that reason aside the son you stepped over Grace but with Grace I have to be a disciplined parent I have to I have to do it can we get the Lord a hand I'm gonna stop for the Chad oh no more coming up so I'm gonna stop may the Lord bless you it's a little late but I got a lot in my heart but trust me God changed the service and I just prayed something was said to help you because that's my I'm telling your pastor that's my only interest if I can't help nobody I won't I won't do I'd rather not do nothing I can't help say something to help that's my whole motor energy always has been to try to help people see them watch them grow in the Lord this will have been my motive and ejected since I've been in this message yeah you get you misinterpret it sometimes that you're a legalist or hard I'm over all that kind of stuff because I know what's in my heart this is what I know you can't play with spirits don't play with the Devil this is my own Hearts musicianship huh maybe we could uh you played it song Draw Me nearer you know that song brother dropped me nearer I think that's a wonderful song for us that we want to be drawn nearer to him I know I do and he's the one that does the joy he pulls on us and I'm so thankful that he does if I'm asked the question how do you know God loves you I said man the way he beats me the way he corrects me I know he loves me he's a true father let's pray father we shall thank you for your word things just change Lord but that's okay I think about what the prophet said that any Minister knows when you want to change the direction they know to leave the notes alone and that's what we did Lord because some things I just really felt need to be fed and I know it's not going to return void gotta go exactly what you where your purpose is to go my father I just pulled out my heart this evening trying to show even what's in Satan's mind is up to no good it's deceiving to get people to feel religious but not born again Sanctified but not filled with the Holy Spirit Satan is such a deceptive deceiver in these things but I'm so thankful oh God for predestination that everything is into your hands or God is Not Me choosing you you chose me and I'm also thank you for the scripture that whenever you start a good work Lord you're also going to finish it and we're going to be just like Paul we're fully persuaded that we commit to you Lord that you'll carry it through so father we thank you this evening and I pray that you just really dealt with the heart of a young person to let them just be careful of the things that's the surrounding them because we got choices nobody can force us to do nothing we also could say no we have choices and may we just recognize hey I'm a Son of God I might be in this little to see an age but I'm not a little sin I am a son and daughter of the Lord Jesus Christ so father I just commit everything to you and into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen may the Lord bless you brother Chad God bless you my friend amen praise the Lord thank God for the word again faith comes by hearing the word amen trust referred what the Lord said amen to get
