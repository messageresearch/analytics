Lov the name of Jesus Christ amen we've been enjoying the services amen haven't you amen glory to God uh we were inspired Yesterday by by the sermon our brother preached and he preached on the the woman at the well and uh he was saying that you know the seed in her was longing for love and comfort but the flesh was giving her the wrong interpretation right and that's why she went to adultery and from husband to husband but when Jesus came along the son of man the prophet and uh he gave him the true gave her the true interpretation amen and uh and that was the water that was the water that she never she no need to uh the water that can the water of life amen so we pray that this be a blessing to you all amen amen oh Jesus water Jesus water Jesus he gave a water and it was not from the well oh Jesus gave a water Jesus gave water Jesus water water and it was not from the well there was a woman from Samaria went to the well to get some water and there she met a stranger who did her story tell she went back to the city she came back to him ringing the time she had Living Water not from the Jesus gave water my Jesus gave water Jesus he gave a water and it was not from the well on that woman he had a Pity she ran back to the city crying Glory Hallelujah I'm going to let his prais swell every time she doubt him she stop to think about him the man that g that Living Water not from the gave a water Jesus gave a water he gave her water he a water he gave water I'm going to let that woman he gave water he water he water he water he water and it was not from the well gave a water Jes gave water he gave a water he gave water he woman water he water and it was not from the w [Applause] the amen little by little I'm changing I'm growing little by little I hope that it's showing I'm Not Who I'll be I'm not who I was I'm somewhere in the middle God is changing Me little by little once I was walking when I was small learning new things as I grow some people say that I'm getting so tall where did the little K go inside God is making me you may not see it until he is [Music] through little by little I'm changing I'm growing with little by little I hope that it's showing I'm Not Who I'll be I'm not who I was I'm somewhere in the middle God is changing Me little by little [Music] amen sometimes I feel like I'm so far away from all that I know I should be but his word says that'll finish one day all that he started in me I look at me and I don't understand but God has aici and God has a plan little by little I'm changing I'm growing little by little I hope that it's showing I'm Not Who I'll be I'm not who I was I'm somewhere in the middle God is changing Me little by little every tiny Step Up Fai brings me a little bit nearer I can't wait till the Brand New Me shows up in the mirror in the mirror little by little I'm changing I'm growing little by little I hope that it show I'm Not Who I'll be I'm not who I was I'm somewhere in the middle God is changing Me little by little by little I'm changing I'm growing little by little I hope that it show I'm Not Who I'll be I'm not who I was I'm somewhere in the middle God is changing Me little by [Applause] little amen praise the name of the Lord enjoyed those specials amen that was good and it was a revelation to some it's just a a story in the Bible to others it's a revelation to some is just words to others is life amen something that we again is not just listening to something that they are singing but rather it's identifying with what's written here it's got to be a personal say yes you got to identify with the woman at the well and it's it's you again as our brother preached last night on Enoch and you and uh so and he was putting the emphasis on you because Enoch has come and Enoch is gone so uh now it's your your turn it's the same with the the little by little God works on us and as our brother brought out about Enoch last night you know in the 300 years after after methusa was born and he walked with God little by little by little to F to finally well brother something struck down on the inside of the inside something struck that that Soul right down there that Spirit right down there and uh he was no more he was gone and uh a brother brought out about and they couldn't find him so they must have been looking for him but couldn't find him because little by little by little the Revelation increased because you remember again that water that the brothers sisters saying about you you keep drinking that water all of the revealed word amen you got to drink this drink this but some will drink that but not this you know that because they they don't like the taste of it or it some might have a good you know effect on their lives and and and to drink something else may not feel so good it might it might taste a little bitter but still You' got to drink it amen so you got to he said are you able to drink of the cup that I drink and he said You shall indeed drink of it amen so thank God for his word and the Lord willing this morning we're going to dedicate uh the third child of our sister Priscilla and uh uh I don't know when the fourth one will be we'll leave that with the Lord amen and the will of God be done and maybe they're praying no Lord and maybe the Lord is praying yes my brother and sister my son and daughter but we're going to dwell on the third one and uh the third is is perfection but as I as I uh did speak to a couple in the United States a few years ago when they had their fifth child and uh I said true I said fifth is Grace but I said seven is completion so but it's a revelation They didn't accept and they and they came back and said well we we'll be we'll we're content with Grace so that's as many children as they had was five and and uh and they they didn't go on to completion when it comes to the family so but again uh I can say that I'm from a family of that went beyond completion and added to the body more when I from a family of eight boys and one girl no offense to the girls here but eight boys and one girl and that's what my mother had to deal with that's what my mother had to raise and uh and had to had to train and I must say that uh they had control parents had control and I pray God give our young parents here the control that our parents had amen governed and again for my experience I was my parents were governed by a again of Faith their faith in God they went to church we were raised in church we went to Sunday school and uh and so on and but again now the anointing back then was quite different from the anointing now and uh back then when the power of God was more present there was more of the Holy Ghost and now there's less of the Holy Ghost in the Earth the prophet of God did say when he was praying for our brother Perry green and his ministry ordaining him as it were into the ministry and he said Lord we know the holy spirit is leaving the Earth is going to leave the Earth and he said when he does we want to go with him and so there's less and less of the spirit in the earth now because those in whom he dwelt is gone they've been called home so there's fewer and fewer people with the holy spirit so we pray the grace of God that we have the Holy Ghost without it you're dead spiritually dead we need more of the Holy Ghost and he did say we've been reminded in this hour that it's going to take a double portion of the Holy Ghost to get us off the Earth amen Satan is here preparing his bride Christ is here getting his bride ready and he said it will take a double portion to get us out of here so brother we need to get put ourselves more and more into it the things of God the word of God we need to start dwelling on it thinking on it praying without ceasing meditating on it redeeming more time for God cuz I tell you the devil is there to get us to redeem more time for the world and the Natural Things of life and less for God and again I we have gone through it before what is the devil's plan the devil's plan is keep us busy too busy for God so I pray Grace help us Lord to walk in the spirit God grace to help us live in the spirit by the grace of God and brothers the only ones that are going into a Rapture are those that are in the spirit and the spirit in them by the grace of God in control not you in control but by the letter of the word by the Holy Ghost in control by the spirit of the word the life of the word so we pray that Grace in in our young parents here today with the young children boys and girls to raise them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord by the grace of God and I was trained in such a way that every Sunday of course we went to church uh as children as young people we went to church three times a day and that was Sunday morning and again we had to be there at 2:00 for uh for Sunday school and then we had to be back again at 7:00 for the Sunday evening service so that was three times a day for the young people so brother and now of course we see that people are giving less and less time to God and uh whether it's it the sermons that I preach or whether it's the worship whether it's Church whether it's in our homes less and less time to God and the thing becomes a form of godliness and no power we need the power God help us this is serious it is it is Heaven or Hell brother I tell you that it's either eternal life or Eternal damnation we're going to lift up our eyes in torment or you're going to lift up your eyes in the bosom of Abraham in that sixth Dimension and uh worshiping and fellowshipping with the saints that have gone on by the grace of God so God help us is my prayer amen so the Lord bless you as we prepare for the dedication of our sister Elsa Carol June coffee uh she should have had another name but that's all right for names is four is is Deliverance praise the Lord so we pray God to bless our our young sister today and it's a not exactly the world we would like for her to welcome her into but we pray the grace of God to be with her and the grace of God to be with the parents and of course also the grandparents also have a responsibility amen our brother and sister beg here and our brother uh Mark sister Moren you know they're they're the grandparents they think well it's all in the hands of mom and dad you know yeah but again you have a responsibility and that responsibility might be to pray that responsibility might be to plead the token constantly for them realizing because you realize how difficult it is to raise the child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord not the way that the world raises them but the way that God wants them rais amen the way that God wants you to raise them up the way that God raises his children amen so I pray the grace of God to be with our brother and sister be and we certainly welcome them from Tucson and U pray the grace of God to brother Mark sister Moren and uh as well as to our brother Joseph and sister Priscilla it's a test and I guess that uh I thought it's unusual that some of from Tucson would marry a newlander where were maybe somebody from Ohio we marry a new finlander and have to move further north that's good we're getting closer to the North Star amen and all everybody and all down Through the Ages is the North Stars govern the the those in the ships so they they look for the North Star and then they set there they set their course you know depending on which direction the North Star was in amen so God put it there for a reason amen amen so we're we're all there for a reason so God bless you and I want you to turn with me to St Luke's gospel chapter 2 St Luke's gospel chapter 2 that the dedication of a child is scriptural in the scriptures we find that the greater emphasis was put on the dedication of a boy a man child not the dedication of a of a girl or a woman child but in the New Testament there is neither male nor female to make a difference there's neither a Jew nor Gentile but we're all the same in the eyes of God and we all require his grace amen and God looks down to to see in us whether is male or female his own life and his anointing and his Blessing and we know of a we don't have Aquilla but we got Priscilla we know of his scriptures and as the Aquilla and Priscilla and there are sisters in the scriptures that God has used and when it comes to the word to be a witness of the word not a preacher not a teacher but you can still be a witness of the word you have a testimony to give even as a sister amen and we find that God has used them in the scriptures God has used them in the Old Testament God has used to in the New Testament but not not into positions that he had ordained for a man only so the grace of God to be with our sister Elsa today and we find in the St Luke's gospel chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 21 in the birth of Jesus there was the Adoration of course of the Shepherds that came to witness as it were the birth of the of the Lord Jesus Christ two years later the wise men came to worship and to give their gifts to the king they had a revelation that he was the king and in Luke Chapter 2 when Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple for circumcision and dedication they are following the rules that God had laid out in his word they were going by the letter of the word but we're going by the spirit of the word because we want God's blessing on our children we want God's blessing on us so we put forth the effort to bring them into the presence of the Saints praying the grace of the presence of God to come down and to anoint the [Music] child and in Luke 2 and verse 21 and when 8 days were accompl lished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle dos or two young pigeons and under the New Covenant it's just not every male that openeth the womb should be called holy but sometimes it's see it's a female it's a little girl am that can be called holy to the Lord that you can have children you can have a male it could be serpent seed you can have a female and it could be the seat of God we have been reminded by the messenger that Christian parents can give birth to serpent seed and that serpent seed parents can get birth to the seat of God because it's not what's in the flesh it's what's in the soul right and then God makes it manifest by sending his Messengers with the word in every age and the thr out the seed of the word and the seat of God is going to respond to that word not serpent seat amen so whether it be a male or female it can be holy unto the Lord and we're praying of course great that the children that we have dedicated the children that you have had are the seed of God and you will train them and nurture them as the children of God you have a tremendous responsibility and he said to offer sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle does or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon Him Praise the Lord and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he up in him in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation May the salvation of God be in our sister Elsa today and may our birth be a blessing to our brother Joseph and sister Priscilla that there is a purpose in her birth he said which thou has prepared before the face of all people I light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother Marvel at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against and may God bless sister Elsa to be his testimony and his witness yay ass sure it shall appear through thine own soul that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and verse 36 to 38 and there was one Anna a prophetess a female that God had used he used the male and he used the female to Bless the Child the daughter of Fel the tribe of Aer and she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about 4 score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day whether was sh ion or Anna they were totally devoted to the Lord and to serve the Lord and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him and to all them that look for redemption in Israel amen God has ordained that in the birth of a child it is to be brought into the presence of the ministry and the Saints to ask God's blessing on it amen the Lord bless you we're going to sing number well in The Melodies of praise it [Applause] is almost the last one in the book and this was the one that the messenger used when he was dedicating children and the parents brought the child and they would sing when he cometh when he cometh to make of his jewels all his jewels precious jewels is loved and his own and like the stars of the morning his bright Crown adorning they shall shine in their beauty is loved and is own amen going to ask you to stand and

word I want to thank everybody for their prayers for the baby and thank to be here now I also wanted to explain that Elsa is a form of Elizabeth and which means truth and um it struck me there this morning which uh we've talked about having a fourth uh not right away it struck me this morning that we we may have to because if if you notice in the Scripture it was Gabriel who visited Zachariah and to tell him that Elizabeth was going to have [Applause] John we may having AO amen praise the name of the Lord I pray that when it's announced the fourth one is on the way that he'll have the same attitude amen praise the Lord and just a reminder brother three is perfection five is Grace and after that seven is completion amen we but we'll see if the Lord's going to T that long we don't know but you [Music] know sisters was a Sarah Ro Sharon and Sharon brother Brown's first daughter died a child but just shortly after when he went beyond the curtain of time and saw her she was a young woman huah that's right and yet people were taught back then oh yeah people were taught back then in the Evangelical world that if a child died it went into a certain Dimension and it was trained and and to grow up yeah there was a certain sister said she had a vision and that was the vision you know she saw the child going and went to this area and that Tri was was growing in this area where it had to be in time it had to be in time growing in this area and then after a while you know we get a certain get up to a certain height and age and responsibility then it would go on into another dimension but the prophet of God when his child died and he went beyond the curtain of time and he was walking down the the the road and he was singing the wheel on the wagon is broken sign on the ranch for a sale and then he heard that you heard that voice hello Daddy God allowed her that way for a [Music] reason and he said I not old enough to be your dad why because she was a young woman and she told him who she was and she said mom is over there waiting for you amen praise the Lord there's no babies in heaven amen so God's grace that when when we step from time to Eternity you know it might be uh Gabriel John Justine or or or Lydia Daniel you're going to be a Young Man in Christ that's right it's wonderful eternal life I pray that it's more real to us than the body we're in now

and to say again pray for our brother and sister begot and for their physical healing and our brother Philip poer and and others that need sister Betty and others that need a touch of God in their body listen Saints the prophet has reminded us if you can't believe for healing how can you believe for a Rapture you can't believe for God to heal the body how can you believe for God to change the body so we need to pray more we need to worship more we need to Fellowship more why so that that that encourages us encourages us we strengthen one another we uphold one another amen so we either we believe it or we don't believe it so I pray God help us to believe for our our brother Philip's healing sister Betty's healing for brother bega's healing and sister bega's healing and the others that are sick here brother brother Mark and his our condition and brother Adam here and so we all have physical needs but let's turn to Jesus uh you know well we got to go do this we got to do that listen if you turn to Natural things that's fine but do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do it with faith have faith in God even if you go to the doctor have faith in God Amen so Grace to us we pray amen so let's sing only believe as our brother Mike comes with the word today and believe that God's going to bless us today as he did on Saturday night and on Friday night and it was a blessing amen preaching true righteousness on Friday preaching Enoch and you on Saturday night and let's pray the grace of God be with him today and you know again I appreciate it let I said it last night he's preaching the word he's not preaching just you know oh go in a prophet he's preaching the word he's bringing it down to you and Christ you and the word that's good that's good that's what it should be and brother Brandon wanted always wanted to get out of the way so to give preeminence to Jesus amen so and that's what the ministry's got to do is get preeminence to Jesus amen because he's the one that's going to Rapture us he's our healer he's our savior he's our change it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's saying only believe all things are possible and we'll give it to our brother Mike amen oh ho [Music] be all things [Music] are amen [Music] amen [Music] all yes amen Lord I all things are [Music] possible Hallelujah [Music] GL [Music] Lord Jesus is his Jesus is here all things [Music] areus [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus [Music] amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord amen you know the closest that man comes to creation is having children amen because that child wasn't even here it part was in its mama and part was in its daddy amen and neither part was a person it was potentially a person but it wasn't a person and through the through the union of a man and a woman comes a conception and I guess the old older I get and the more I think about it how that that little seed once it's conceived it becomes life and you almost have to look at it through a little microscope yeah and so science tells us that that little seed has a blueprint in there but the blueprint isn't on paper the blueprint is a is life it's called a DNA and from that one little cell comes eyeballs eyelash es hair skin cells backbone blood system nervous system out of that out of that one little seed comes comes a little child it wasn't nothing there and now it's a person that's the closest that we come to creation and yet it's become so cheap in this day of abortions and giv jilling her way and and yet it's the greatest thing that God's given man outside of Salvation is to have children amen it's a it's a great miracle look at yourself you know once you weren't here at all there was a part in your mom and a part in your daddy and now you're living a life all your own unconnected thinking talking making your own decisions praise the Lord it's a great it's a great miracle and and man in this day is trying to escape responsibilities to where they don't want to get married they don't want to have children so it's a great challenge for a man and woman to come into holy matrimony and it's a great challenge to have children amen and you know to have have great children with the knowledge of responsibility that god holds us accountable yes for raising them it's not a it's not an insignificant thing with God it's not a it's not just a cheap thing it's just not a reproduction of animal life no but it's bringing life in there and then he takes a part of himself and places in that little to Tabernacle that he might come in the fullness of time with that child and place his own life in there it's a it's a great thing yes amen praise the Lord praise the Lord for for parents you know if we can if if we can turn there just so much that comes into your mind you just have to push it back I'd like to turn to Matthew 25 and I know that we've been here probably an hour and a half so I just pray the Lord give me wisdom uh I guess I just got a lot on my plate this morning we want to speak of Noah and our our intentions this morning is not to spend a lot of time I don't want to go into depth as much on Noah as I did Enoch because there was so many things in Enoch and probably still is in and by the grace of God your pastor will bring more things out because our identity is actually in in Enoch amen and and brother brandham when he would refer to Noah and Enoch he said in Noah you know it was it was uh it was uh eight out of that generation but he said he wasn't the type of the Rapture the bride it was one man showing the showing the uh I guess the numerical difference but there was times that brother brandham used Noah as a type of the church or the bride and he also used Noah as the type of the 144,000 we know that but we're using it tonight we've just or this morning we're we're trying to what my purpose is is to connect the ministry of enan with the ministry of Noah because remember it was Noah and lot and brother brandham said they were both preaching they were actually preaching to the totally lost at the time of Destruction so Enoch was actually taken before that time he wasn't actually in the time when it was it was already seal shut but there's a Ministry that connects those two things together yes and that's what we're looking at is the third pull so what I want to do is I want to bring in Noah tie in some things here but then I want to move on to to take this picture that we have in our mind and bring it down to the third pole amen and and I know it's going to be a lot of information and I don't want you to worry over it I don't want you to try to take a bunch of notes and things but we want we're on a journey this morning and and you know when you when you go to a place and maybe it' be the Grand Canyon or whatever it be out here and and you're traveling along there's so much and so what do you do you take photographs and then when you go home all you see things you done forgot about and it brings that that that visit it brings that little holiday back and you can live it again through the pictures not live it in life but oh yeah I forgot about that oh look at here you know I didn't even notice that was behind me when you took that picture you know so our pictures this morning is is going to put on a a CD or a DVD so we can go back so I just want you to relax this morning and listen I'm going to move probably rather fast a lot of information but don't let it overwhelm you I just want you to kind of look at the scenery some things may be thought-provoking to you so I want you to have your thinking caps on and I I really want the Lord to give me wisdom because I don't want to worry you out and as I say ride this horse into the ground but but we do have something on our heart that I feel that God has sent us here to to share with you and and I don't want to be limited by time but I don't want to take advantage of your hospitality so we we want to have we're still in these bodies amen and and I know some sometimes how tired I get my wife gets and you get uncomfortable and but but we do want to share something with you this morning and and if and if you know I might have an objective in my mind and God might have something different in his mind and I don't want to control his mind I want him to control my mind amen he said when we pray we need to pray Lord change my will to match your will amen but many times we're trying to pray to get get God to think like we think or his will to be with our will but but we need to be in a fluid place that he can take our will to bring it subject to his will and that's what we want and and and praying for that is like praying for patience because we know when you pray for patience here comes the tribulation right amen and and when you pray for humility here comes the crushing because humility comes through crushing and trials and he doesn't just hand it out and make you polite and timid but humility has power prise the Lord humility has boldness but humility doesn't speak of itself it doesn't do for itself I remember years and years ago I heard I had was getting some tapes from Brother Perry green he said humility is to have the power to do something and don't do it he had the power to call a legion of angels but he didn't do it amen Paul had the power to cast that demon out of that girl but he didn't do it so humility is waiting on God and being in the will of God and your will being subject to his will amen and to me that's Rapture in faith prise he said the bride will have the word and she'll know what he wants done with that word and she won't move unless she has thus sayith Lord amen so that's what we want to look at a little bit this morning so I'm going to take this parable of the foolish virgin and the wise and we know it by heart but just to take a platform and we're going to start from here in Matthew chapter 25 and we'll just read verses 1 through1 13 if we can then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened on the 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while a bridegroom carried they slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made Behold a bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said onto the wise give us on give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the and the door was was shut afterward came also other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh amen may we bear our heads Heavenly Father we know that that in our our Bibles it says the parable of the 10 virgins but we look at it Lord not just as a parable but a prophecy amen and we are living in the day of this prophecy and Lord that when any man lived in the day of the prophetical word you always came and Open the Eyes of the understanding of your elect for that day to understand that prophecy and father we we have a knowledge but we want it quickened to us Lord that it becomes reality for where there is darkness and prophecy comes then prophecy is a light that shines in darkness to reveal that what is hidden by ignorance of man and by the lack of the wisdom of God in man but when prophecy comes and prophecy is revealed to the people yes it becomes an illumination that lightens up that which was not seen amen so father may you come for without you we can do nothing amen we're the Vine you're the vine we're the branches and without you we can do nothing may you come yes as you've already presented yourself Lord your your presence Lord through song and worship and and Lord even prophetically in the dedication of this child praise the Lord amen a bride for we're living in a bright age yes amen praise the Lord and Lord you dedicated a Manchild Jesus Christ now we have the dedication of a child of woman the bride of Christ amen so Lord may it be prophetical this morning yes Jesus as we speak upon your word May the light of Illumination come come upon each and every one of us and may you lead us to Higher Ground and deeper depths amen may you grant to me the wisdom Lord we're still creatures of time may we not be bound by time but may you grant to me Lord the wisdom yes Jesus Lord with your people prise for Lord I'd rather speak four words that they would understand than to speak 10 thousand Lord that their mind could not comprehend so father help us this morning bring us the Mana in due season for this day amen and we ask it in the precious name of thy son Hallelujah Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated there's a lot we can say about this Parable every scripture uh sometimes you know you can uh with a minister or with me it sometimes you know you can you can already have your your what you want to minister on and you got your notes and and you have your scripture and and I've had this happen it's not all the time that happens but you'll start reading a scripture and and my thing just start busting open while you're reading that and almost makes you want to stop and and say well I never saw that before and it wouldn't be under that anointing or that inspiration and it just opens up just like a we were talking the other night about a Roman candle and well or a Chinese candle I guess but to us over in America it's the Roman Candle you know oh Rome and and uh and their great light that they put out which is a false light but but anyway it just breaks open and and I've seen you know I've read some places where brother Brown said okay well I just don't really have any anything this morning let's just uh oh let's just read right here and we'll just see what happens oh if that happened to me I'd be up here i' I'd probably have to take something for an uler or something you know I'd be a nervous wreck but he he just he he was just uh we're all built different you know and Pentecost they call that the anointing you know if if they see you come out with notes like this they'd say Church intellectual you know God just deals by inspiration and and that's true I've seen men just read their notes but that's the way God uses them he sits under the inspiration and he writes it he comes with that same inspiration and reads it if he wants to sit and preach or stand and preach or if he just wants to stand there and read it or if he runs all over the place uh each man is different in his in his ministry but the thing we want to watch is what does he say not not how he says it but what he says amen not how you feel when he says it but what he says it's got to be according to the word of God or I don't care how it comes or how it makes you feel if it's not according to the word it doesn't come from God that's right and so that's that's where we want to be this morning but we don't want to be Church of Ephesus you know uh they could judge that word they knew if people were preaching the word they knew if they was Apostles but they done drifted from the from the warmth and the love and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and and they became deceived amen not by the intellect but they had walked away from Christ like Mary and Joseph and didn't even realize they left him behind so we don't want to leave him behind and we don't want to reject anything that he has for us so in this parable what we're what we're noticing here uh that after the Rapture takes place now we know that this is a a parable that includes the church ages because we see that there is a there is a uh calling forth of these virgins like it was with uh Esther that the King was looking for a wife so they went all over the the kingdom and there was he wanted a woman he didn't want a man that was before this day you know he he was he was he was a he was will say not that he was normal because today normal is not what normal was back there then because it's so perverted but anyway they so then they went out to find a a wife a woman for him and they searched all all over but now uh out of those women they had to find women that were undefiled and they had to find virgins amen so then out of the multitude of the women that there was a calling for virgins and so they called The Virgins out and so now we had two groups those that were called and those that weren't called because those that were called were virgins but in there there had to be a woman that would be selected from that group that would be wife to the king and we know that that was Esther so she was elevated from the women in the in the group with the virgins and then she was elevated from that to be wife to the king yes and so here we have the the foolish virgins which were called by the gospel and they all came out and and now they were preparing uh for that wedding and if you know the old traditions of that day and I'm sure that it's been ministered here that when that girl was was consecrated or dedicated when that vow was taken she went home he went to build a little Hut for the honeymoon and she went home and started preparing her things and in that Preparatory time she had this lamp and she would sit that lamp which was an oil lamp in those days up in the window and when the bridegroom came back and it was usually at midnight according to the Eastern custom at that day that uh he would come and that lamp would be lit now if that lamp went out then that then that was disan he he didn't take her because that lamp represented her love and her Readiness and her expectation of the coming of that bridegroom Hallelujah her all her whole life that was connected to the bridegroom was represented in that lamp because when he came and that lamp wasn't lit it disen knowed that engagement that was it amen so that's what this lamp represents and so down through the church ages there was a calling forth of a bride but we also had the foolish and the wise and and the way that some people preach the foolish virgin they they take it just like the word foolish and just make them stupid dumb and and just not worth anything but but remember they were virgins amen and a and a virgin represents a woman that's undefiled and and and if you've ever read that that book that's a sequel to the to the prince of the House of David the the uh the Throne of David the way that that author brings forth Jonathan you begin to realize that Jonathan was just as a spiritual man and just the same a man as David was he loved God he loved his father he was loyal to his father and he loved David and he accepted the Throne of David that his father couldn't do his father could not accept the choice of God for David to be king but Jonathan submitted himself to the kingship of David before David ever came to his throne amen he said when you come to your throne remember my children so he was able to submit himself to his father but he was also able to submit himself to the word of God to God's will in his own life he was actually the heir parent from the way man looked at things Saul and then his son would be the prince would be the next king but because of Saul Jonathan lost that kingship he didn't do anything wrong it was his daddy amen it wasn't that you did anything wrong it was Adam but when Adam fell amen from his throne all of his children fell that's right and Jonathan didn't do anything bad he was a good man he had Faith he believed God right he was able to to protect David and he was able to be loyal to his daddy he was able to stand between David and his daddy and yet he was able to stand with his daddy and battle and die with him he was a man of Great Character and when the enemy had to had the armies of Israel at Bay he went out with his armor Bearer he said he said if God if that man hollers at us and says come up here we'll know that that's the voice of God speaking through that man and we're going to go up there but if he doesn't then we know that God ain't with us and we're going to stay right down here about that time that man hey come up here we'll show you a thing or two he says that's it that's the voice of God Amen and he put himself into an unwi position militarily because in order to crawl up there they had to they had to crawl hands and feet up there and you know that's a bad position to be when there's a man standing up there with a sword waiting on you it's hard to defend yourself when you're working your way but by faith he went up there and conquered the enemy Hallelujah but the problem was that he was of The Tribe of Benjamin and The Tribe of Benjamin was not given the kingship it was a tribe of Judah amen so Jonathan wasn't in the election but David was so the foolish was not in the election yes but you know Noah preached and he was a preacher of righteousness he was not a defiled man and he walked with God and yet he was the type of the foolish virgin so that's one thing to keep in mind that this foolish virgin she's 100% as far as what God releases to her in Revelation but she never comes up to the place that the bride the very elect is she had oil but she didn't have enough oil to take her through but the bride the the true bride the the five virgins that were wise they had oil with them and took them all the way in to what we know as the Rapture amen at midnight The Voice goes out the Lord shall descend with a shout and brother Brown said the the bridegroom call comes right through the son of man Ministry so we find that there's even foolish virgin that responds to the bridegroom call but she just does not have the inspiration the light to take her all the way into the Rapture so she's Justified she's Sanctified but she doesn't have rapturing faith amen and when she comes up to that door the bride has already gone into the Rapture but now there's a voice that speaks to her and says it's too late now to me that expresses a message that's going to be spoken to that foolish virgin because that foolish virgin according to the prophet according to the seals the six seal she has to give her life during that tribulation period yes but the scripture says let the righteous remain righteous the wicked remain Wicked the ungodly Etc so we know that she is righteous but she did not have the Revelation to take her in to that Rapture amen so then she has to give her life during that tribulation period and come up at the white Throne judgment and be granted eternal life because she doesn't sit with him during that Millennial Reign amen so then she gives her life now my thought is this it's not going to be somebody coming up and just holding a gun and saying you're going to have to deny Christ I believe she's going to have to recognize she's in the tribulation period yes she's going to have to know and recognize and have the discernment to know the the Beast the the name the number the mark of the beast because she's going to have to know the Antichrist and it's spirit and that she's in that tribulation period because to give her life when I look at at at Hebrews 11 they all gave their life and died in faith so for her to give her life her being the Virgin she'll give her life for the word in other words she'll have to give her life dying in faith not just ignorance amen and so what I'm trying to do this morning is to tie the ministry of Enoch with the ministry of Noah and showing you that there's a link between that so then let's go let's go to the Book of Genesis if we will and I want to try to take this and like I said maybe we won't get get through with it it's important to me but it may not be important to God and and and so then I just don't want to wear you out and I'm just going to try to keep track of this in Genesis and uh I want to start in chapter 6 and and maybe uh just go to to verse 8 of Genesis chapter 6 but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man amen now I want you to notice that he was a just man speaks of justification that doesn't mean that he was a man that was out here and he he was a he he he he was fair with everybody but I believe it speaks of he was a just man because it said job was a just man upright before God perfect now we find this same description here of Noah and remember that job was a prophet and he received his rightous nness through a revelation that God had given him it was not the sacrifice it was the Revelation the sacrifice only testified of the revelation God gave him so his sacrifice like Abel testified of his righteousness so the first thing we see here Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation now you take that and try that with what God said about job and Noah walked with God so these are the only two people in the Old Testament that the Bible said that they walked with God Enoch and Noah Noah type of the foolish and walked with God not some trash people not some people that are just dirty and all stupid foolish virgin Noah walked with God and Enoch walked with God Amen so keep that in your mind when you think a foolish virgin but you cannot decide to be a foolish virgin you cannot decide to be bride you cannot decide to be saved that lays within the election of God that foolish virgin is 100% all out she's living all the word that she knows she is not somebody that comes in the message and says well I don't want to live like that but I I'll believe brother brandom and I'll stay in the message I'll just be foolish virgin foolish virgin would decide to be bride she would not decide to be foolish amen she would decide to be chosen not just one of the virgins that wasn't chosen that's right because in her heart she wants to be bride but she just wasn't predestinated but the wise virgin was predestinated and she wants to be the wife of that bridegroom amen she doesn't want to go back into the group that's just going to be out here in the uh amongst the other women that never come into association with the King she wants to be she wants to be his wife she just doesn't want to live down there in the castle with him and not have nothing to do with him she wants to be married to him and bear children fruit onto that marriage amen so true bride could never say I just want to be foolish because that's contrary to to the bride Revelation amen Noah walked with God God the Lord and Noah begat Three Sons Shem ham and japheth now here's something that I found to be interesting that if I go back to Genesis 5 and verse 6 and Seth lived a 100 years and five years and begat enus and in verse n enus lived 90 years and begat Cain verse 12 and Canaan lived 70 years and begat Mahalia verse 15 and mahale lived 60 and5 years and begat Jared and then Verse 18 and Jared lived 160 and two years and begat Enoch verse 21 and Enoch Liv Liv 60 and5 years and begat methusa verse 25 and Methuselah lived 80 and7 years and begat lmch verse 28 and lmch lived 180 years 80 and two years and begat begat a son and he called his name Noah now verse 32 and Noah was 500 years old and Noah begat sham Hamond japheth that's a little different isn't it they were triplets do you ever see that I never saw that he was 500 years old and he had he had three sons he was 500 years old and he begat Shem ham and japheth it didn't say that that he had Shem and then he had Sons and Daughters it says he was 500 years old when he had these three boys they were triplets am and you know the Bible said we're all of One blood and brother Brown said the whole world is populated through these three sons they represented the the Jews Samaritans and Gentiles and they were triplets no room for hybridization there that's interesting isn't it amen it's something that you can go back and look at and Noah begat three sons shemam and japheth and the Earth was and the Earth also was corrupted before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth make an ark of gopherwood room shall thou make within make in the Ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch so as I was reading this I noticed that when I was reading about Enoch it said that Enoch was 65 years old and he had Methuselah and after that he had methusa he walked with God so we seen there was a period of time that he didn't walk with God and we went back and looked and said there had to be a Reconciliation and so we see that that methusa is a is a Time marker between when he didn't walk with God and when he did walk with God am and the Bible made it explicit because it said after he had methus Le walked with God so then we begin to look at the Revelation that God had and and righteousness through faith and begin to tie those together that God had come to him his thirst for God what he had received through Adam's Ministry the which was the word of God to him testimony at that time and then God quickened that he began to seek God and God met him and he revealed to him what he'd been looking at because under the ministry you know he listened to what Adam was saying and then through that Revelation that he received from Adam when he walked in the garden he was looking at the church and the condition and his eyes was being open now to the ungodliness and to the backsliding and in him was a fire to to and perhaps he had even the same experience that uh Adam did when he began to talk about what was revealed to him in the message of Adam they said oh yeah yeah yeah because you see he was the seventh Church age and that was the lukewarm Church age so it identified the the characteristic of the church and yet we're not saying that these firstborn was lost but they represented the True Vine so when you begin to study the when the flood came every one of these firstborn had died off and methusa was the last one to die Before the Flood came so none of these first Bo Di in the judgments of God in the flood they were taken up before the judgments or taken out before the Judgment come amen but each one of them after they had CH after they had a son then they had sons and daughters so there was many children in that lineage and I believe that it was in those Sons not the firstborn not the original vine it was in there that man be the sons of God began to look upon upon the daughters of men amen so it was in these children that were begotten by these men that we see the hybridization beginning but in this first born which is representation they were taken out before the Judgment come not one of them died in the flood they all died before that flood come so then when I began to read about Noah I notice that it said and Noah found Grace in the eyes of God these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation and these words refer to righteousness justification because then it goes on and ties in with that and says and he walked with God he could not walk with God without being reconciled to God he had to have word supplied to him by God in order to have faith that God would Inspire him to that word amen and then as I read down and I got down here to verse 13 and it says and God said unto Noah I said now according to the scripture and the way it's written that God was walking with Noah before he spoke to him where did that righteousness come from and that's why we were looking at lot where does his righteousness come from we looked at Matthew 10 that he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward what is it righteousness by being inspired to the message of the prophet and becomes righteous before God by the inspiration on the word of the Prophet bringing Faith so now if I if I look here at Noah I want to show you or I won't be able to show you but if I uh if I don't get excited here and and do something wrong on this little thing you know I can I can be at the house doing just fine I get up here and this thing just does not want to mind me I got and then I get nervous let me give you a little bit of timeline and we're not we're just going to go from Enoch to Noah and and some of you probably already studied these things but i' never really connected these things before and I don't have charts like some people do so I just had to do this with my own figuring but Enoch was 65 years old when he had methusa and then it was 300 years years before he was translated so then methusa actually sat under his daddy's Ministry for that 300 years so he sat under the administration of Enoch the building of the pyramid because it was after that that he had Methuselah that he walked with God so I believe it was in that period of time that the Revelation came of the pyramid when he was walking with God so he witnessed the building of the pyramid he witnessed he witnessed the the prophetical message that went out listened to it for 300 years sat in church with his daddy and then also he was a sign child and he knew that his name according to his daddy's preaching had something to do with the coming judgments that his daddy was preaching about yes and then he had a son and his son's name was lmch and and M methusa was7 years old when he had limi and so then limi he lived 113 years under the administration of Enoch before he was translated so now we got methusa he sits 300 years under that that Ministry and now we've got limi his son that sits 113 years under that Ministry and these are believers but yet we find that in this even though the methusa is a sign child and Lim also is the grandchild of Enoch there's a lack of inspiration here because that they don't have the same relationship that Noah has with God so they believe the message but it's not inspired to them it's not inspired to them even though they believe it they said under that Ministry I believe what my daddy taught but methusa wasn't raptured and methusa died before the flood and methusa never walked with God even though that he was Enoch's son right but he believed that message and he preached the same message that his daddy preached amen he preached it to his son and to those that listen to him we know by limi that he had listened to Adam and he knew the ground was cursed and we knew that he was prophetical limi was because he he prophesied of the of the ministry of his son Noah by expressing that he he would be a rest to the people and connecting it to the labor with the cursing of the earth and we find that when Noah walked out of the Ark then God said I won't curse the Earth anymore so he had a prophetical Ministry that he could see that his son was going to have a Ministry for the people to bring rest but he didn't know exactly what it was he just had that prophecy amen now 69 years after Enoch is is taken up then we find that Noah is born so that Noah his daddy is limi and limic said 113 years under that under that message and we know that any daddy that's spiritual and believes in God he's going to raise his child in the admonition of God Amen that scripture is just not for today it goes all the way back to the beginning any Scripture is the same yesterday today and forever God don't have different Revelations and different standards but he does have different elevations of Revelation so Lim methusa bringing his child up and they actually sat together in church and listened to Lim's Grandpa and and meth and and Methuselah's Daddy and they were Believers because they were firstborn firstborn lineage amen they weren't unbelievers and and so here comes Noah 69 years after after that Enoch is is taken out and now his grandpa and his daddy is still preaching the message that Enoch preached just like Adam was telling them about what happened in the garden and they Poss they all believed it but Enoch was inspired to that by God God used that word through a Adam to create a thirst in Enoch and that thirst brought him to the presence of God it was all God's doing Enoch was just the vessel that God was inspiring and motivating him by inspiration and not being born again but having representation of seed in him and now Noah finds Grace why does he find Grace Because he believes that message that his grandpa and his daddy's telling him and he's inspired to that message amen and he looks out and he sees the same thing that Enoch saw through the same eye that Enoch was looking through because he's inspired to the prophecy of Enoch and he looks out and he sees the ungodliness that's been accumulating since Cain walked out of the presence of God and now there's an intermingling of the churches and he sees the church here that believes but they're lacking a reality of God and yet he's inspired to that word and God imputes that to him for righteousness because he's just and he's perfect in his generation and he's walking with God and remember he's foolish virgin but he's even though he's inspired to that word he's not translated but now there's a problem he knows that there's a common delusion he knows the prophecy concerning methusa his name and he begins to look at him and he says now when he dies the delusion is coming right he didn't know how it was coming he just knew it was coming he believed that amen and it was imputed to him for righteousness and he was perfect and he was a just man and he walked with God but he needed something to take him through the Judgment he didn't know how to get through it he just now he knew according to the message of Enoch it was coming and he saw the condition of the church he looked out you know there's foolish virgin that looks out and sees the condition of the world they see the signs of the time but they don't have Rapture in faith and God didn't Rapture Noah but he came to him and he says you know what you believe is exactly thus sayith the Lord he confirms the message to him that it is thus saith the Lord he says I've looked out and judgment come up before me all of the violence and everything he actually is rehearsing what Noah has already believed and heard through the prophet Enoch through his son and through his grandson his grandpa and daddy but now he doesn't know what to do when methusa dies he just knows the judgment's coming so then God goes on and he says no build an ark and it doesn't take him in a Rapture but it takes him into that tribulation and in Noah day it took him through the tribulation and when the ground wasn't cursed anymore amen there's a second burning after the Millennium there's another burning yes sir sir and the ground was justified it wasn't it wasn't cursed anymore but the foolish that we're looking at they give their lives but they've got to be on the ark when they give their lives they've got to have faith and the voice spoke to the foolish and said it's too late I believe that there is a message to the foolish yes because not only did the fool not only did no receive the message of of Enoch but he didn't have Rapture in faith but God revealed to him how to go through that tribulation amen so they receive a message Noah received a message from God but I want you to notice over in in second Peter and again I'm going to try to stay inside of your Bibles we're going to Second Peter chapter two and we just look at verse verse five second Peter 2:5 and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eth person a preacher of righteousness amen it doesn't really call him a prophet because he didn't prophesy of the coming judgment he believed and by inspiration he preached the prophet's message which was God's voice to that generation so it was noted by Peter he calls him a preacher of righteousness he doesn't refer to it as a prophecy and then if I look at Hebrews 11 while we're on this end of the Bible here Hebrews 11 and verse 7 pertaining to Noah by faith by Revelation Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear and that word of course we know it means reverence it's not talking about being afraid it's talking about Godly reverence and godly fear of God's prophetical word in other words he believed it being warned of God had things not seen so we find that he had that faith that he looked to the Unseen he looked at that which had not come but yet God said was coming amen that there will come a resurrection and we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so Faith looks to the Unseen so he already saw the Judgment he already saw the rain coming down because looking to the Unseen he moved with fear and he built the ark which God told him to build and then notice here and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith so he was an heir of the righteousness which come by faith look at Romans 4 real quick uh Romans 4 and in Romans 4 and I want you to look at verse 13 of Romans the 4th chapter for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith so then the being heir of the world is not through OB obedience it's through election that we're the sons of God that we will inherit the whole world back to Adam in the beginning so then he becomes an heir of the righteousness which is of Faith amen he believed the message yes and he was a man of righteousness because he believed the prophet's message he received a prophet's reward amen and he was a preacher of righteousness and Heirs of righteousness at the resurrection when Christ identified himself amongst the disciples upwards of 500 people one time and there were many witnesses of that Resurrection there was witnesses that not only saw him but saw the resurrected SA sa because they spoke to people on the streets they were Witnesses of that Resurrection but they were not HS to that Resurrection you can sit in a courtroom and and somebody's passed away and they're reading out the will and they says okay uh I'll just use my own name Michael uh he's left you all of his bank accounts and his property in the car everybody oh look what he inherited but nobody else in the courtroom inherited only I benefited from that will because I was the heir of what was left to me in that will and we are heires of the righteousness which is of Faith so in righteousness we have an inheritance we're hirs through righteousness so 120 went to the upper room they were HS and they drew benefits from that Resurrection but the witnesses didn't draw any benefit they were witnesses to an event but they were not hirs to that event Hallelujah that's right and the Lord descended with a shout and there was many witnesses Amen on but the elect was the benefactor huah they said all heard the ministry of Moses but not all profited by it not all were Heirs of that Ministry but Joshua and Caleb being the air of the righteousness of God by faith amen look what it says in verse 16 I really like this verse I just hope I'm not taking too much time uh there was a my my sister and my brother-in-law living out in the west they were friends to a to a real estate man and he was kind of neglected by his family they never did visit him and things and and so they they took up a friendship and they became very close so the man was approaching death and he was a multi-millionaire so he he he got his his lawyer the best lawyers that he could get and he drew up a will what we call an ironclad you know a whe that's that's roten Stone and surrounded by Steel and you know through the intelligence and the intellect of all that his lawyers had and he had left everything to my sister and my brother-in-law but he left a little bit to his family that was shattered around and they were all wealthy people too so when it come time to the reading of the will that was Ironclad he wanted to be sure that these two people got this inheritance because he loved them and so he did everything legally to tie that thing and make it Ironclad that they would get what he was going to give them because he wasn't going to be here to give it to them if he give it to him and be alive then he would be sure they'd get it he'd find said this is what I decree but they contested it in court and because they had money it went on for three four or five years so my sister said I'm tired of this thing me and my husband and so they just let them have half of everything course they wanted all the money and it involved property and things so they liquidated and gave it to them God has left you and I an inheritance we lost that inheritance through Adam but he has promised to give it back in the end time to restore all of Adam's elected children Jacob not Esau Isaac not ishma amen is that right so then he had elected children that he was going to restore or redeem back to the Lost Throne they had in the Garden of Eden where he could express himself through true sunship and have sons and daughters on the earth with the power of creation because that's the identification of the fullness of deity hallel is the Satan cannot create if he could create there wouldn't have been no serpent seed he would would have created his children and created a soul and then he would have come and lived in that child because only in the soul can he place his life and have children amen he can enter into animals but he cannot have children and he could not enter in to those Souls that belong to God because they were sealed by election hallelujah hallelujah so look what God says here in Romans 4 and verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace now Ephesians is same he writes we're saved by grace and that through faith but here now notice that he's making the emphasis on how God is going to save you and why that he's going to to use this particular Avenue to give you inheritance in other words election tells me why I got saved Grace speaks of the election of God the unmar favor and Faith tells me how I got saved because it's through faith that I came to to my salvation that I walked out of my Amnesia and recognized myself to be a Son of God and under the opening of the word we found it just wasn't according to our free moral agent but it was our free moral agent that was motivated by election by a seed that laid in you and I Hallelujah so watch what he says now he says therefore for it is of faith that it might be by Grace Amen in other words God controls Revelation so then God chose the avenue on this rock I'll build my church and from the beginning Abel by faith offered up a more excellent sacrifice that was God's Avenue to connect with his children and to provide the righteousness of that dispensation to come into His presence but he controls it ever present water from the rock if you're born again you got the Holy Ghost the life of God is in you you have enough power in you now to create a world and go live on it but he said there's a law that controls that there's a restriction that keeps you from doing that it's in you but you can't do it you try it Lord let there come an elk and let it have a big rack it didn't work Lord let that car be mine it didn't work we Tred it a lot because it's in us but God holds the key to that amen and the key to that power is Faith and then he goes on to say whatever God leads your soul to believe that's how much faith that you have so God controls the amount of Revelation you have this morning and he says however much faith that you have that's how much power is released in your life amen so the power for the Rapture the revelation that we're waiting on is in us now but we're waiting for God to Quicken it to make it a realization Hallelujah because the many it hasn't been quickened yet and there's an element that God has not quickened to us because it's not time hallu and then he goes on to say he says we don't need to pray for more power he says what you need to do is live a Godly life now he's bringing it back to character because power without character is satanic amen so David had to go through his pre-thinning of the Prophet to the anointing at Hein but he had to go through a preparatory time until all the flesh died I cut off a little bit of of Saul's here and I'm going to show them who's got control I can't believe I did that it's not me it's God that was the Flesh in David to cut that little bit of a corner off and he repented for doing that just to show that he had power over Saul he was coming to True humility amen his pre thrr days was caves and running and hiding that he could come to the place to have character to rule over the people of God Preparatory time Preparatory time for Moses Preparatory time makes a man ready for a Ministry but it doesn't make him perfect he smoked that rock but he did what he was sent to accomplish he accomplished what he was sent to do so now he says therefore or it is of Grace that it might be by grace in other words by God's control to the end that means this is why he chose this this is why we're saved by grace and that through faith that's why he chose faith that he could make it of Grace of his own choosing to the end the promise might be made sure absolute to all seed that they would inherit their promise Hallelujah you inherited your promise today not by accident that's but God made sure that you were going to inherit This Promise of rapturing faith that come through a message he wasn't going to leave it up to some preacher he wasn't going to lead it up to Mom and Dad he wasn't going to he wasn't going to leave it up to some Prophet or anything they were all avenues that he used but he controlled it yes he inspired you to the word to be sure that you draw benefits from your inheritance there ain't no loopholes in God's in God's plan there ain't no questions in God's plan who's going to get saved and who ain't which of his children are going to be redeemed and not redeemed he made it what we call airtight but yet it's a mystery to man because it's still up to your free moral agent he said he you know when I first came in the message you're predestinated so in calvinistic mind I said huh that simple I didn't have nothing to do with it he he he saved me he got me saved oh here's another message and God placed you here as he placed Adam and Eve a free moral agent to choose there a window wait a minute wait a minute now wait a minute that's Armenian ISM isn't it it's just up to me what I decide to do oh but when you blend them together in the harmony of the word he's left it up to you but he placed a part of himself to influence your choice hallelujah hallelujah though did it not have life it's part of God and that part of God is eternal but it's not eternal life that seed that's in your daddy that that germ that's in your mama it's it's living and it's part of the human race but it ain't a person but when they come together we've got a person and that Soul that's in you is part of God from the beginnings of the world but it doesn't have life but it is living it's not dead but when God comes with the Holy Spirit through the election of Grace and by the free moral agent and as the as nabal was killed and now that that uh Abigail was free and when our first husband died into repentance and justification and sanctification we were free to choose when he came to proposed to us as David sent his Messengers to Abigail and she said I'll go huah and he sent his Messengers to you and I and through the gospel we were Justified Sanctified and because there was a seed in us we chose to be United with him hallelujah hallelujah amen prise the Lord thank you so we find that now that Noah through the ministry of of Enoch and by the inspiration of God was walking with God and now he had the instructions of what to do so now I want to I want to move move ahead and we recognize that in this third pull let me see if I can uh work this thing a minute and I know you're familiar with this this a Look Away to Jesus he and I'm going to read pieces of it because I know you've read it and had it read he says so now I'm going to say something to you now I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence so the first point I want to make is that you know when I begin to think about this third pull I was thinking about the opening of the word the third pool and and then I noticed that when brother brandham goes back and relates to the times that we saw the third pool come in the manifestation it reached all the way back to Hatty Wright all the way back actually a little bit before Hatty Wright when he spoke the squirrels that's when it began and then it evolved from H from the squirrels to hadti Wright and on through his own wife and the and the candy and the different the five times that he refers to expressly so this this is the point I want to make you and I are waiting for the adoption of the sons of God but we're not waiting on sons of God we're not waiting to become sons of God we're waiting for the adoption so we are not waiting for the third pull it's already here it's already in existence so it's not looking for something that's to come it's already right here Among Us he says it's in existence it's been Vindicated it's here and then we realize this is different but as a result of the third pool in the prophet's Ministry because the two are connected because the third pool of the prophet's Ministry brings that same power to the church the Bride come on because we know that the opening of the word 1963 was the beginning or the third pull he identifies that amen he talks about the sword he talks about the cloud he talks about the the room the shoe and all that he says this is what you've been looking at the seven seal was the mystery of the coming of Christ that even Jesus didn't know the Angels didn't know amen amen yes sir but it wasn't the coming the Lord shall descend and we shall rise to meet him him but it was the dissension according to Revelation 10:1 and According to second first Thessalonians 4 the Lord shall descend with a shout amen that was the coming what we call the appearing amen because he said he is now appearing in flesh amen this is the day of his appearing but it's part of his coming he said there's a there's the appearing and there's the coming he said the coming is is always when we meet him in that Corporal body and we are the Corporal body but this is not the body that hung at Calvary this is the body that was in the body of [Music] [Applause] Calvary amen so we are the Corporal body on Earth there is a tabernacle on Earth amen but there's a true Tabernacle in heaven and there still is John sought Revelation 4 [Applause] amen but on Earth it's a bride but it reflects that which is in heaven amen praise the Lord but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power now in and you forgive me if I'm taking this time but I want you to understand what we're listening to am and if I feel if I feel that we're just wearing out and wearing down we'll just stop amen amen but in 62 the spoken word The Original Seed he says the entire seed word has struck the Earth first he says a denominational seed has struck under uh Billy Graham the Pentecostal seed has struck under oil Roberts amen but he said the entire seed word has struck the Earth in other words first pull second pull the teaching Reign the entire but he said and yet Malachi 4 hasn't been fulfilled yet come on it'll come now I'm going to paraphrase this now with this so that we can relate to this when it when when Malachi 4 comes to its fullness then what we've seen in temporary power will be manifested in the fullness of its power and that's connected to the purpose of Malachi 4 AM and the purpose of Malachi 4 is to turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic faith and that could not be accomplished without the opening of the word and the revealing of the son of man so in 1963 God is opening up a door A Door of rapturing Faith by the opening of the word just like he did with Peter he opened the door of grace to the Gentiles he opened the door of grace to the Samaritans he opened up the door of grace to the Jews and all three races the whole world the door was open he had the keys he had the message to bring Salvation to the world and he wasn't needed after that then Paul then Phillip then all the rest of them could preach cuz now the door was open and God could pour it out hallu Malachi 4 had to open the door for rapturing Faith for a translation not a resurrection we're not pointing at first fruits first fruits is Pentecost first fruits is church ages amen this message is to bring us to the fullness am Hallelujah so in 63 yes sir at the opening of the word Malachi 4 was fulfilled amen it came to its full power of the opening or revealing of the word that would bring Rapture in faith that was the prophet's third pull in his ministry amen which is not to be separated from this third pole Noah had a third pole Jesus had a third pole amen what about you amen what about the bride yes ours may not be as prevalent in the first and second pull probably there's those that could bring that type out but the third pull we have a third pull that now brother brandom is identifying that this when it comes to its full power will come at the time of the squeeze you read this anywhere you read that he always ties those two things together he puts a time element in there amen but it won't come by observation yes sir it'll have to come by inspiration to recognize it it won't be jail houses and bars maybe like we thinking it might be who knows but one thing for sure when it comes you're going to know amen let me go on down now this is in the same it it in in this it's it's um paragraph 38 to 49 I'm going to jump down here to the bottom of it it's tightening and then when the time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch that third pull then see It'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church amen so I didn't recognize that for a long time but it's actually three grp three groups that it's involved with it'll be two the two the totally lost now let me let me see if I can uh you have to forgive me but I'm I don't use this thing that much I wish I could use it more because it makes things more convenient Souls that are in prison now and this is it's it's paragraph 206 there will be a Ministry that will show great wonders Joel said so so he's referring to prophecy and there will be no time for Redemption so at the time of the manifestation of this ministry which is spoken of Joel there won't be no time for Redemption and that's that's very important it's all over the lamb has done took his book and his redeemed his over and Jesus first preached and was rejected and then went and haunted those that were in in there preach to them that were in prison could not repent no time for salvation that same ministry will have to repeat again amen what if that could be the third pull to the Eternal lost what if it is there I hope it's not but what if it is think of it just a moment minute now what if it is God forbid I got children see but it sure looks pretty close to that amen so the prophet's Ministry was in in in in the major impact of the first and second pull to me was to the denominational world what I saw was the climax of the ministry of the Holy Ghost a Capstone to the ministry of the Holy Ghost through the son of man Ministry Christ identifying himself not the Holy Ghost but Christ the Capstone of the Holy Ghost expressing the fullness of that power through a prophet revealing the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man so it brought Pentecost not just to a first fruit but actually to the discernment of the heart God work himself amen and it was it was in majority to the denominational World l a sea so it could fulfill the scriptures that they put him out by their worldliness so they put him out and crucified him the word but praise God when they killed him there had to be a resurrection cuz you cannot kill a word and the word returned in a resurrection in 19 1863 the son of man and the same experience they re they they received on the day of Pentecost which was God killed son of man and returned back Son of God we reive the same experience of dispensational change and a quickening of God upon this age from Son of God to son of man amen so we see him preaching to the totally lost in relationship to the Church of Leia amen that's not to say he didn't preach to the individual I'm not saying that but this third pull he says will come at the time of the squeeze and according to what we read here it'll be after Redemption has been finished for the Gentiles now watch if I don't get afraid of this thing all right this here is is is questions and answers this is back in 54 he's talking about Paul he's talking him about out there on the on the island and that snake bites him and he talks about him being so full of the Holy Ghost that poison couldn't kill him amen like we were saying the other night I believe it was here it's coming a time of diseases what you need is the inoculation not small pox that's all right not your flu shot that's fine but the true inoculation is the Holy Ghost amen so he was so full of the inoculation of the Holy Ghost the poison of that of that serpent couldn't kill him amen that's right watch what he says and he goes on to talk about that and then he says religious people put him in Chains talking about Paul it was the religious people that had him on that boat religious people put him in Chains the very finest of the churches that day was what put him in Chains if it just wasn't for the Constitution of the United States and I guess Newland they do the same thing today that's right just wait till she's till she's broke a little more amen now he's tying to national debt in with with his third pull I don't know how many more trillions China can lend but when people need money they'll do anything amen they'll even sell out to the Catholic church if they got somebody to go their bond they'll do anything to get out of jail and he goes on this is in the same this is now this is questions and answers 54 January the 3r and so we're reading like paragraph 145 to 199 and now it's paragraph 202 and I'm just saying this so it be on tape in case you want to go back and look at it so he goes on to say oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theologies fail to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant after the doors of the Gentiles is closed oh God will anoint his church then he who's filthy let him be filthy he who's righteous let him be righteous so we see now he's tying this thing in to that shutting of the door and the last voice we hear in revelation 22 let him come quickly at the time of the Rapture at the last Feast the Feast of Tabernacles because it was at the feast of Tabernacles when they had taken a a a special vessel and they were they went down and they drew water from The Well of salom and then they they came back up and they and they and they poured that water into the Brazen Altar and while they were pray pouring that water Jesus says if any man thirst let him come and drink amen H last Feast the Bible says and he says let him come for I Am The Living Waters hallelujah amen now under ordinary circumstances the deacons or the priests that were the guards of the temple because he was out of order they would have grabbed him and hauled him out but they were afraid to touch him they didn't move now the same voice for she is him speaks and says let him that is thirst let him come Hallelujah last Feast last call amen for she is the final voice to the final age let me read one more here true sign Overlook paragraph 191 let the people let let that little flock that little Remnant that God will give him let that little Remnant go to calling out to God and watch what happens there will be a national Showdown there will be a power that they never seen before trouble of it is this time it's going to be too late for them the doors will be closed now I had other scriptures because I wanted to bring into this the adoption so if you you you can take these scriptures down or I'm not going to go to them because I don't want to take that much time Ephesians 1 and: 3-5 we are predestinated onto the adoption of children he said the mystery of his will and so you and I are predestinated onto the adoption so our whole life our whole calling all of what we are the sons of God all of Grace all of faith is to bring us to the adoption and remember the adoption is not adopting us into the family but the adoption comes to the son of the king and the son of the king is equal to the servant and no more powerful than the servant David and Jonathan were the same but in David Flo Royal Blood in Jonathan it was not amen so in the very elect flows the royal blood and only the son he rises he is equal in in subversion submission to the servant because the servant has been given authority over the son but there's a problem the servant can never raise above that position of being servant over all the servants but the king can raise to a position that the servant cannot be elevated to to sit on the throne amen but before he's recognized his King The King identifies the son as the heir and he changes his robe in a public place basba said David Solomon's supposed to be the next king but now you got another son over here by another woman that's older than him and he's claiming he's going to be King David I want you to place Solomon as king to be sure that there's not a rebellion or a vot they might get the wrong Pastor so David says take my mule nobody rides that mule but David if they caught somebody just trying it out and say boy this thing sits really nice he was a dead man you take him and you you put Solomon on there and you put the robes on him and you give him don't know if his a scepter or what and you take him and ride him all the way through the public streets and announce him as a king and he made sure that Solomon was going to be the next king [Music] amen and so he takes his son to a public place and changes the robes and gives him the Ring Of The Authority the Seal of a king and now he sits in the throne King not as king king that's the adoption brother Brandon preached that message over and over amen so the predestinated to the adoption is to be predestinated to our throne but it's not going to be the Throne of God Christ is sitting on God's Throne Spirit but his own Throne is on the earth Hallelujah that's right and we sit on that Throne not up there in the heaven with the angel angs where Adam was made to sit on the throne in the Garden of Eden you and I sit with him in his throne Earthly vessels in a glorified body but all the godhead in US of Creation in Romans he says you're pre you're predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ of his son the Ephesians 1 we'll read it and I think we're starting to wear down a little bit so I think we're going to try to bring this thing we got enough presented here I'm going to Ephesians chapter 1 let me find my notes we read we quoted 3 through five where you talked about chosen in him we should be holy Without Blame talking about being predestinated having predestinated us verse verse five having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure now verse 11 chapter 1 verse 11 of Ephesians in whom we we have and whom we have obtained not going to but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the new birth and through the righteousness of faith we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth and the gospel of your salvation in whom also that ye have believed ye were you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise and which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so how did you get the Holy Ghost well from what I'm reading here the holy spirit is part of your inheritance that's what I just read because it said I have obtained an inheritance and the Holy Ghost is the earnest of the complete inheritance that I have so then if the Holy Ghost is part of my inheritance how did you get your inheritance you were predestinated amen so you didn't get the Holy Ghost by your efforts or by accident you were predestinated before you were born to receive the Holy Ghost because that's part of your inheritance what's it going to do it's going to bring you to your full Redemption until everything that was paid for in Redemption is redeemed yes not just your soul but the body that goes with the soul a glorified body that's the fullness of our Redemption that's when death is put under fooot and we're sealed unto the day of redemption when that book is open the prophet said and Redemption comes and the fullness of redemption is the fullness of the Redemption of this Triune being and I have have the earnest of that which is the Holy Ghost amen which I was predestinated to receive but I still had to come through justification and sanctification as Peter said through the sanctification of the spirit so we had to be born through the process of God's birth that he reflected in the natural birth now go to Romans 8 same author just a different letter Romans 8 Romans 811 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ now that he must be God himself from the dead shall also Quicken or make alive your mortal bodies now he's not talking about your soul he's talking about your body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh but if we live after the flesh we shall die but if we through the through the spirit do mortify or put to death the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again that old nature of the world at first husband you don't have to worry about nabal coming back to life he's dead amen you know I know he's not coming back to life because it said we're dead so I don't care if he comes back to life or not we're dead in Hidden Christ the lord what are we hid from the law our first husband you don't have to worry about him coming back to life if he does that's fine but you're dead and that broke that marriage vow amen you don't have to re we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father so we have received the Holy Ghost the spirit of adoption that spirit that is in you that's going to bring you to adoption and the Way Up Is Down the way to the throne was through caves and being hunted and persecuted by Saul the way to the throne was through Calvary amen because after Calvary he was exalted into heaven and all power was given to him oh we have to come through Calvary and we have to have a spirit that will give us strength amen am but not like Samson like the branch drawing from the vine strength drawing from elot Ab the father drawing Revelation from that rock that word to give you strength and Manner and it will lead you down down not under the foot of America or Newland but under the will of God submitting your will to him and going down coming up and without that Spirit you'll never come to adoption because pride and self-will will keep you from it your first husband she could not she could have nothing to do with David as long as that first husband was alive Paul said as long as that first husband's alive then that woman can't marry but what happens said we are dead in Christ so we died in him he taken that first marriage and he nailed it up there on that cross and we are HID in him from the law it can't touch us we're in him married to him and the law the penalty has been removed because we're innocent not forgiven but Justified where did we get to okay now if we just drop down a little bit verse 22 for we know I guess we know this because Paul said we know for we know at the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have which have the first fruit or the earnest of our inheritance we could say until the fullness of the that which is purchased is received the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit or to include the Redemption of our bodies amen so then according to this scripture the fullness of our adoption is to include the the Redemption of our body so the fullness are being placed upon the throne is tied to the changing of the body fullness of our adoption the adoption to include that which was purchased we only have a portion of it we have a portion of the power of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost through gifts and through Revelation but there will become a day that we set upon the Earth thrown and Adam lost the power of the spoken word to have children and to move trees and to fulfill the commission that he had without the spoken word he could not fulfill the commission nor could he be the fullness of the image of God on Earth in man amen but when we come to our position of restored Sons to include the body that was identified with a fallen Throne we'll receive a restored Throne that which was lost and he that holds that Throne amen do you know who holds the title deed to Israel it ain't Israel it's God he only gave it to them as an inheritance you got a grandson or a son and you're going to give them your car but you know that sometimes they get kind of in a fix for money and he might take this $5,000 $10,000 car that you give him and he'll probably sell it for a couple thousand but you don't want him to do that but you want them to have the benefit of the car so you said I'm going to give you the car and and you can get the tag and the insurance and your name but I'm holding the title cuz I don't want you to sell that thing amen so the boy goes out and he says well I'm going to take it down to the title P or I'm going to sell it so he's at work and this this guy says he says man he said I sure like to sell my car and so this guy's working with him said well I'll I'll give you a couple thousand for it he said oh man he said it's worth more than that he said well that's all I can give you take it leak it okay let me write you out a bill of sale I sell this car to you for $2,000 sign there you are okay here's your money give me the keys thanks he goes down riding down the road and here comes a blue light behind him pulls him over and says hey what are you doing driving that car he says mine I got a bill of sale right here see he says yeah but he don't have the title and his daddy wants that car back amen and Israel sold out but God held a title dead to that land amen and god holds a title deed to your soul amen thank you Lord people try to sell their soul to Saint to get what they want but you know you can't sell it amen he might get a bill of sale but there's one that owns that and that's God and he can come get it anytime he wants it and he came and got it and redeemed you back lord where are we at waiting for the fullness Hallelujah so I'm going I'm going to close with this I'm not closing in just a minute I don't want you to I don't want to be one of those I'm closing I'm closing I'm closing I'm closing but I have closed this and I am going to take this and fold it up but it's still on it just it just it's just gone to sleep but I can wake him up anytime I want to now let's look at the first resurrection Christ dies he goes down into into hell and the first part of his third pole Ministry is to preach to the souls that are in prison but he has another Ministry and that's the empty out paradise so he goes down and he preaches to the the souls that are in prison then he goes over to paradise and he gets them and he says come on let's go and that's the first fruit that's a whole bundle bundled together with the resurrection of Christ he brings forth those dead and brother brandham actually says they were in their glorified bodies walking on the streets we don't know if it was all portion whatever it was it doesn't make any difference if it was one so then first part preaching to the souls in prison second second part he takes those out of paradise now he comes up and he's he's meeting with the disciples and his whole purpose of coming to his disciples is to prove to them or manifest to them that the resurrection is on and to open up the message that he already gave him before he died because he said I've told you this before amen so he walks with him on a road to emus and they don't know who he is and he's talking to them but now it's different they heard these messages before but now it's time for the quickening power on this message so he is now bringing it forth in his in his glorified body in the dimension that it was meant to have the fullness of its power can I say amen and so he's telling them the scriptures and he's talking about quotes if he was a message believer and he's tying these things together and of course the people are walking in it's a gloomy time it's about like it was with Abraham when he went out and sat under the oak tree that day and it looked like everything was going wrong he couldn't have children she couldn't have children still he hold the promise in his hand he was looking to the Unseen but every time he looked into the mirror there was a problem amen that problem was him it was his body but he believed what he was looking at in the mirror didn't have anything to do with the power of God God didn't have a problem with it Abraham might have the doctor might have had the neighbors might have had but God didn't and Abraham in faith didn't he didn't even consider it he didn't he didn't put his head in the sand and ignored it but he believed that God's power was great than a dead body and he went out and sat under the tree and brother Bron said it looked like everything was going wrong so here's the disciples walking down and they're just kicking cans and rocks you know I'm just oh man I just thought we was really I thought that climax was coming and he's gone I just don't understand you know and here comes this guy and I had one brother who was preaching this was years ago and I always thought it was true you know I think it is today they walking down there and they're going well you remember what he said yeah so they're going over the quotes and scriptures and things and they just so here comes up this man and he's smiling you know and so they've been through this crucifixion in all this turmoil in Jerusalem and everybody you know ain't nobody really too happy because the Pharisees and them they ain't happy because they can't find jesus' body and they're looking for it and you know I mean the whole place stirred up so here comes this guy and he's said hey what's going on Brothers uh you been having a good day and they said oh we say you're a stranger around here because he was smiling you know sometimes you come to church and you can tell the visitors CU they're smiling and everybody else said it's nice to get visitors once in a while so anyway he begins to open the word to them under the anointing and they're being inspired while the inspired word is coming to him yeah that's right oh yeah yeah I can see it now and he creates a vision through words of the resurrection of the crucifixion and what had taken place in the scriptures oh by the time they get to the house they're in Revival because the bride's Revival has come now and they're in Revival and and he that brought the Revival said all right we'll see you guys at the next uh maybe next prayer meeting or something let's see you say oh no oh no don't go 45 minutes ain't enough oh no oh no don't go one hour ain't enough oh no oh no he's dead pray for him bring him back up don't let that stop the service don't go now come on you oh I hear some more we're hungry but go on preaching while we eat you know the preacher he goes out he preaches a sermon there he preaches one there he gets over there and he preaches and he never does stop preaching I was raised with a bunch of preachers that when you come together and you was talking you didn't raise your hand cuz you wouldn't ever get to sayen nothing you just had to butt in and then one brother says you know there's one thing I hate is for somebody to butt in after I've already butted inah so they're walking along there and now they're rejoicing come in so he comes in they don't know who he is it's not because they didn't know him when he was 24 years old it's because the scripture that it was withholden from him so he sits down he says okay let's eat and they said would you ask the blessing said sure he takes the bread and He blesses it and he says the same blessing that he said in the F the Passover and they said you know Jesus did that same thing he did something that was done before the crucifixion now he's doing it after that and that particular thing identifies to them who he is and her eyes was open and her understanding was open amen and then he gave them a message he said go to Jerusalem and wait now the resurrection was on but they needed a message to tell them what to do amen and the message said go to Jerusalem and wait until the promise of the father comes so now if if that pattern would hold when I begin in this message several years ago I began to ponder I thought I heard people say well the third poll when we're being 100 persecuted we'll just speak food on the table you know and I thought well that that's nice then other said well you know we'll speak Limbs and we'll speak our glorified bodies and we'll speak that I said well that's nice because how would I know if Malachi 4 has been fulfilled or not if I don't know what it was to do I would have to know the purpose of Malachi 4 to even know that it had been fulfilled amen now what we've seen in portion we're not waiting for the third pool so we can hear people testify said oh you know I I had to third pull manifests for me I I said this this happened I don't that don't surprise me because it's here he said it's identified so that means that if anybody comes to that Faith they can manifest it but now to the fullness of its power or to the purpose that it was sent to what is the purpose of the third poll if it's not speaking our bodies and it's not going to be for rapturing Faith that's in the message so I'm not going to be speaking rapturing Faith to us rapturing faith is what brings us to the third pole amen amen the message is what brings us to the third pole so what's the purpose of it God ain't no clown and it's going to be to the totally lost it's going to be for the bride and for the church the foolish now how's it going to be for me if you're not do anything for me it's going to manifest the fullness when you got the Holy Ghost there was things that manifested in your life that you knew you had the Holy Ghost not by what the Pentecostal the Baptist told you what the word told you amen so the so the Rapture of the Resurrection takes place and the body change takes place and brother Gerald now is in his glorified body but I'm foolish virgin I'm still looking for the Rapture I'm still looking for the squeeze I'm still looking for things so brother Gerald comes up to me says how you doing brother oh how you doing you a Believer yeah oh how you doing brother I don't know who he is and he says uh brother Mike you know the resurrection's already taken place and the body change has already come and you're in Tribulation period oh is that right now I guess you you're in your glorified body yes I am yeah well I hav heard that I've heard that for about 10 years they preaching that all kinds of places you know they're in their glorified body and the Rapture and you know what Paul said he said but brother Mike and he starts going over the scriptures and he starts going over the quotes but Neil he's not in a he's not in a position of partial revelation he's in the fullness of that Revelation not the knowledge of it the actual alley and there's something different when a man has the Holy Ghost and preaches about the Holy Ghost and a man that doesn't have the Holy Ghost and preaches about the Holy Ghost so he starts going over the scripture I say yeah you know that's right you're right yeah and man I just seeing things I ever saw before and I'm just kind of in Revival now what could he do what could he do to prove to me that he was in the fullness of his adoption that he was in his glorified body and that I was in Tribulation what would happen if he spoke something into existence he broke the bread he would have to do something before and after that would identify him so now it gave a purpose it would Express the fullness of the sunship poor brother Gerald but it would also be for me because now I'm going to give my life but how can I give my life without faith how can I give my life without recognizing the Beast how can I give my life without recognizing who God is and that I'm in Tribulation because I have to give my life in faith I have to have a revelation I die for that Revelation amen and so then he gives me the Revelation that now I can die for build an ark and then I go because lot had a Ministry and Noah had a Ministry and I go and start preaching to those that are elected foolish virgin and it and it sweeps the world not just one man but and I'm not saying it just going to start with with message Believers but they have that word that they can spread to the other foolish that never had the opportunity to hear it and anoch walked with God and Noah not walked with God through the message of Enoch and I believe the fullness of the ministry there's a ministry that's going on but the fullness of that Ministry the third pull then it won't be for show it won't be for de demonstration but it'll be for a confirmation it'll be for something that God uses in Redemption amen prise the Lord hallelujah as we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we don't know what all holds and your Prophet said the time that we've got things figured out we may not have them figured out and I'm not trying to to figure things out Lord amen but I'm trying to look into your word that you brought to us and I'm not dug into this and demanded Revelation but little by little it's accumulated amen and father however you choose to do to do this let us be ready when you come as you told Brother Gerald one day when he asked you when are you coming he said well when are you going I had whatever it was that you spoke to him yes Lord so may we be ready may we not put a period behind anything that we feel that we understand because we only understand in portion but Lord at least it can open up the map to us for those that don't know that Elijah has come they're still looking for an Elijah those that have or don't have the Holy Ghost are seeking a Holy Ghost and for those that have it they seeking another spirit so father we don't want to be deceived and you said prophecy revealed is light Into Darkness amen so may we Ponder these things into our hearts yes Jesus may you bless these people this morning your children for their patience for their endurance for their longsuffering and forgive me your servant if I've taken too much time with your children but may you inspire that which what you have given for you can take one word and do much with that amen where man takes many words and does little so without your inspiration without your life upon and in the word it will profit us nothing and any Revelation that you give us we know one thing that it will do it will change and transform our character yes Lord into the very image of thy son Christ so these things are not given to bring knowledge and pride but it's to bring love and experience amen and knowledge is Jesus had that he had that total sec security and was not insecure may you comfort your people Lord with your word yes J for I ask it in the precious name Hallelujah of thy son Jesus Christ amen amen Amen brother Gerald if you come God bless you brother God bless you brother and uh you could have went on so I'll pick up where he left off all right bring it to completion not five amen we have eight it's a new beginning that's right it's a holy convocation so we sng of going want to eight children but this is a generation that doesn't want it amen but but again we want to thank God for the word and again brought it back to me when when he made just made a remark concerning Jesus and the railroad to emus and I said well amen I said I said what Jesus did is doing and what was that that was to bring the word to their attention right to bring them back to the word right because whatever happens or is happening and will happen for the Christian you want to know where it is in the word that's right and th this is Faith amen by the grace of God and uh he was he was Jesus he said was happy and laughing why because Jesus knew that it was the scriptures fulfilled Hallelujah and but for them that they they were lacking the Revelation that's right now they had knowledge because Jesus told them he said I'm going to Jerusalem I'm going to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men they going to be crucified and so on and he knew all of that and they knew that yeah but again they lack revelation of it and people can have a re a knowledge rather of of the message a knowledge of the Rapture a knowledge of the Resurrection knowledge of the of the change of our bodies the coming of the Lord but still not have the revelation of it and what is the Revelation it is the reality it is it is the spiritual reality of what God's doing that you can't you don't see what you're naturalized but you see what you're spiritualized amen it is it is it is uh it is your faith as it were is becoming sight is becoming more and more in into reality and I said Lord I said that's it I said what I said the brother was doing I said preaching the word the word word the word the word I said that's what Jesus did and I said the Bible says it began at Moses and he went right on through to the scriptures and he expounded to them that the Messiah had to come and what the Messiah had to do and and and then still still they did not recognize him as the Messiah right until he got into their homes right let's get more personal amen let's come into the secret place of the most high amen and there and let God reveal to you what you need to know about you and him amen it's it becomes a very God makes it personal that's right it's not really impersonal like a religion out there you know going into the church and sing and and uh and and you know you put your money in or whatever and or somebody prays you listen to the preacher and then everybody goes home and so on no no no no it's it's you're coming here for a reason purpose why because there's a personal relationship between you and God you know and and again I'll be honest to most of the churches are there and even to even churches around the message that God is just an idol is no more than an object of worship it is you know it's it's just a book right it's just this book or a spoken word book or you know it could be this right here or this right here it's just all physical it's all knowledge it's all intellectual it's all by the letter of the word but there's no spiritual reality to it that's right amen and and you can believe again you you know you can believe the cloud and and you can believe the billar of fire you can believe the altar of fire and all of these things but again it's knowledge but but in order for it to for God to do something in your life or for it to something in you and bring you closer to God you got to have Revelation you got to have the spiritual Holy Ghost revelation of it you got to have faith it's not it's not just going by what somebody told you no see again I preached that in Virginia in 1984 and in brother fer Church secondhand religion right and and and the prophet of God said he said what did pilate have he had a second hand religion he said what do you mean because he said to Jesus he you know he said are you the Christ yeah are you the Son of God are you this and that and what did Jesus say Jesus said did he said did you say that of yourself or is it did somebody else tell it to you about me do that is that a revelation that God gave you and you're saying it of yourself or is it you're you're going be what somebody else said he said pilot was going by what somebody else said he had a secondhand religion right amen it wasn't a spiritual Revelation to him and the same thing with the message of the hour it's not a spiritual Revelation to everybody and to many it's a secondhand religion oh I ain't going by what brother Mike said I ain't going by what brother jural said I ain't going by what brother green said I ain't going by by what William brandom said that's right and it's just a second and God looks down that's a secondhand religion right amen but where's the life yeah where is the life again we're coming back down to the to the again three kinds of Believers right we can narrow down to the foolish virgin and the wise virgin but then there are the others out there right they're not even virgins right amen but religious but but they're not virgins right so what but again there's there's Adam again he talked about Adam and Enoch and the the foolish virgins and the wife virgins and one is going into a tribulation and the other is going to going into a Rapture one is going to Bear witness of the of God in the Rapture and the resurrection and the other one's going to Bear witness of God in Tribulation that's right they are God's got a witness no matter where it is no matter what's going on no matter what he's doing the devil is there but God's there too that's right amen and well no no no no God's not going to have his children going to tribulation but again our brother brought it out through the word there was an Enoch that walked with God and he was gone and and and and he didn't have to experience death right he didn't have to go through sorrow he didn't have to go through all these things but there is Adam look what he went through look what he had to endure not ad Noah look what he had to endure and look what he had to go through and he brought it out listen to something else too when he he he was bringing at all the families how many how many of no of those families died in the flood yeah how many cousins and aunts and uncles and and nephews and nieces died in the flood right and was there was their Uncle no Uncle Noah there and preaching but you know they didn't want to be identified with him because he was crazy to the world right you know bill because they building a boat on dry land right and not only that you you're talking about raining and what what do you mean rain that's we never had rain before you know where where's that going to come from you know and so it's crazy to the world it's crazy to the make Believers and so on but again too late it was too late when uh brother Barry preached it here one time and uh and he said you know maybe they were having a coming up making fun of no something about with with umbrellas and saying well Noah where's where's the rain where's the rain oh it's there he believed it and and and even KN went into went into the ark for seven days nothing seven days maybe the Sun was shining maybe it was the best weather they ever had but anden the prophet of God brought says oh well the family went over and says well Dad are you sure yes he said I'm sure I am sure God told me and we I didn't spend all this time building this Ark you know and for nothing I know that it's the word of the Lord he believed Enoch he believed what God had said through Enoch he believed the prophecy that our brother brought out concerning Enoch's son Methuselah after his going the delus the delus so he he he he saw these things whereas the rest of the world didn't didn't pay any attention to it so we're seeing things that the rest of the world is not paying any attention to them we're seeing things there in the Gentile realm in the Jewish realm all over the world we see these things coming to coming to to pass and and the world is just going on in their religion going on in their form of godliness or going on in their unbelief but the bride is lifting up her head of understanding lifting up her head head of understanding and what and entering into the Promised word for for the bride listen he talked about the foolish virgin and the wise virgin do you know what that extra oil was that was the revelation of his coming for the bride oh that was just more power more anointing it was Revelation yeah they took that extra oil with them because the scripture says prophesied it they wanted to be ready for it yeah that's and the and the and the messenger said they add the extra oil of Revelation right and that so when when when the the the the sound went out behold he comes the breakroom comes they went out to meet him they knew they had the extra all Revelation to know what that what that what that message was what that shout was amen so the bride in this hour knows about the shout the voice of the Archangel the the last Trump because she got the extra oil of Revelation right and and that's why that's why we're getting ready that's why we're acting different and that's why we're giving God preeminence the foolish virgin knows there's something to it they know there's something to it the prophet of God said he said listen he said the hour is coming when he said in the tribulation they're going to die for what we're standing for now that's right why because they're and he said he said he said when that hour comes and they lift up their heads of understanding right we're going to lift up our ours in moving into the resurrection moving into the Rapture moving into the chains but they're going to lift up theirs of understanding they're sincere right they're virgins right they haven't defiled themselves with that over there religiously or spiritually again as our brother brought it again it's the word I appreciate that the word right and and then they're going to lift up their IDs of understanding and say oh this is what the master said and they're going to say oh what they were what they were saying is the truth as again our brother brought this morning what what Noah was saying what what he KN say was the truth what he said about his son was the truth it was a revelation from God and and the prise of God in this hour said he said the in the tribulation those foolish virgins they're going to they're it's going to all come back when they see this they see that they see something else that's going to come back to them and they're going to say Amen look what they were preaching was the truth right and they're going to lay down their lives for it that's right he said they'll die for what you and I are standing for now but what's it going to do for you and me put us into the resurrection it's putting us into into another dimension into eternity it's good thank God for the word thank God for the understanding of the word as I said our brother been preaching word Friday Saturday Sunday he's been preaching word he's not just preaching well God sent a prophet and you know here's the prophet and here's the cloud of angels and here's the pillar of fire and all these things yeah what the devil sees it devil believes it the devil knows it's God but he ain't going to in no Rapture what's all that for to bring us back to what's going to give us the faith that pleases God to get us out of here that's like when he preached he preaches a rap listen where's brother R oh he there no he's not no he's not he's right there he said listen he said I am above the congregation looking down on you right he said you see me there behind the pulpit he said I'm not there he said I'm up there and he said I'm looking down on the congregation he was in another dimension brother it is the it is the word the revelation of the word that has taken us into that Dimension and making that Dimension more cons making us more conscious of that Dimension right see and you can you can see him there and again this flower was only Tiny But Revel it's only a few words there but it's a big Revel in the heart amen so people can look at that and just identify with a picture yeah yeah yeah yeah of course they're denying it now a lot of people yeah but again you've got to you've got to recognize what that's for and get back to the word as like when he preached the Rapture message if most preachers today if they preach the capure what would the text to use 1 Thessalonians 4 he didn't use that text no he did and has surprised me but he he read it and the text and then he went on went on to say now he said I'm going I'm going to say things maybe he said he said that that he said in such a way of the Rapture he said that that you wouldn't say it this way you don't believe it this way cuz they believe the Rapture this way the Rapture that way but brother it's the third pull right and not only that it's the tent Vision right that's right what yeah in that tent vision is the resurrection in that t vision is the rapture in that t vision is the change remember everybody that went in there they were all changed and and when they come out they couldn't explain anything right what happened in there I don't know can't explain it it was the third poll it was it's the tent meeting I pray God R in the tent meeting CU When he preached the Rapture he read the scripture concerning the tent meeting right he did yes he did that's right he said he read psalms 27 seven MH wait a minute brother Ram you're going to preach the Rapture go over to Thessalonians yeah right no no no no I'm coming back here and he said one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after and he said that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and he said to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for understanding for Revelation for he said in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion that's right amen we're hidden in the tent meet tent Bishop that's right we having the tent meeting that's right and he said in the secret of his Tabernacle or tent right in the secret of his Tabernacle tent he said shall he hide me right and he said he shall set me upon a rock that's right Christ new land is called a rock but let's get beyond that Rock Amen to Christ amen and he said and now he said shall my it be lifted up up when you see this lift up your heads your Redemption draw not right this says for for to to look for a natural tent and in all due respect God Rest their souls those Brethren that had the plane that they're going to fly brother randam here and there if the pro of God comes back he won't need no plane that's right when you're in a glorified body you won't need no plane right you won't need no car no Philip when he went from here or to to the Ethiopian unic God didn't put him in a plane God get didn't send him a a horse and and a chariot no he was here and he's there he said you're going to travel like a thought right praise the Lord God help us to believe Amen brother look these last three services and sermons God has brought out a revelation of himself his plan and his purpose and his pattern that's right the thing is believest thou this amen God he said now shall mine head be lifted up mine head of understanding above my enemies are around about me you're seeing what they don't see you're understanding what they don't understand therefore will I offer in the in his Tabernacle uh therefore will I offer in his tent sacrifices of Joy I will sing y I will sing praises unto the Lord that's the Rapture text that's the Rapture text that's right that's the tent meeting Hallelujah that's the opening of the word so there there nothing there to Ender the bride from moving on amen amen again according to your faith be it unto you God help us listen Saints what the people are missing is the Simplicity of it right it was the Simplicity of Enoch Walking with God the Simplicity of of Noah building the arc right it was so simple it went over their heads yeah well what we going to do with an ark what you build it you know what it's for it's going to float in water where's the water going to come from oh God's going to send down rain Lord help us we need the we need the extra oil of Revelation and God forbid that we should still have after all that God's done after all the preaching you've heard that we should still have amnesia right I remember preaching on it some years ago in the other building spiritual Amnesia and there was a visitor that came in he said what that brother Jo preach on and one of your brethren told him something use a a certain word for it and I said well I said when you get the Holy Ghost you get your memory back I said who you are where you come from job got his memory back you know eventually he said I know my redeemer liveth but God came down to check his spiritual memory where were you when I I laid the foundations of the Earth where were you when I when they when this these sang and these worship and so on so job was back there too amen so brother I tell you when you get the Holy Ghost I said you get your memory back whereby we cry oh Father right father father right oh you're my father it gives us our memories back as to who we are and where we come from and who our father is who our brothers and sisters are that's right it's not the ones that my siblings In the Flesh right no no it's my brothers and sisters in Christ have you got your memory back or do you still have amnesia you know when you feel that you've been in this place before you've experienced this before you've seen this before you've heard that before well why because that's where you come from we're going back to where we come from make sure you got the Holy Ghost your memory of who you are and who your father is if you got amnesia you don't know who your mother or father is brothers sisters anybody like that you don't know but you get the Holy Ghost it all comes back I don't know what the word is but one of the Brethren there did tell that brother to use a certain scientific term that that I was preaching on about being there before I've been here before de Vu that was it oh yeah he said he preached on deu I didn't use that term but but that was their understanding of it when I finish it's like you've been there before yeah because now you're not going by this natural memory you're going by the Holy Ghost memory Hallelujah he brings those things to your remembrance Hallelujah and our brother brought in about the preparation for the ministry it's good and but Abraham he had to leave home family and friends right even when he got his son God asked to sacrifice his son then there was Moses he had to run from Egypt right because of murder right when I became a firer a Shepherd right met God in the mountain in a pillar of Fire right on his way down he had got into a fight with his wife and a battle there concerning the circum of his son right amen God Was preparing him that's right for the ministry right what he was to do in Egypt then I thought about David or rather our brother brought out a David and it's me I never I I did bring out I always bring out another one I'll mention in a minute but it brought he brought it to my remembrance when he said B about David David he had the throne by a promise of God that's right but he had to fight his way all the way to the throne right I like that he had to be in the caves hiding in the mountains right he even went into the the philisa there somewhere somewhere another country hiding you know and uh just just pretending he was somebody else and oh brother and yet he was a Shepherd he killed the lion he killed the bear he went out there and killed the Goliath and and and here he is a prophet anointed him as the king thus sayeth the Lord where's the throne right it's yours but you got to fight your way through you got to fight all the way to the throne you talk about preparation for the ministry and I said Lord praise the Lord I said that that's a Vindication again I get I said what he's saying is a Vindication of what I was ministering on a number of times yeah what was it and I ministered on Joseph I said he had to go he had to go to the the throne right but I said where did he start I said he started in the pit yeah that's right he started in the pit his brothers threw him in a pit and then they sold him as a slave then he got falsely accused and ended up in prison right what surely God's not with that man God was and we think you know this happens to this man or this woman oh God's not with them if God was with them that wouldn't happen this wouldn't happen it's God preparing them watch out yes better watch out Amen brother that's it so don't think because you're a child of God everything's going to go good no God's going to work on you according to the need to get you in his will to line you up with his word to get you in the middle of the road and stay there Lord oh that always struck me but now now there's more after hearing the word this morning yeah that's right there's more to it it's not just it's not just Joseph no no no no look what our our Lord went through brother you got to go from the pit to the throne that's right and yet it was God all the others never experienced it no they were enjoying life right they wrot they're having you know their families and their farming and their cattle and everything else and oh they were prosperous and it was and and and they were the like the foolish virgins and there was Joseph there going through all of that that's right and he was the chosen of God here was David there going through all of that and he was he was anointed king of it of of of Israel here was Moses look what he had doing do her what Abra and you could go on with others in the scriptures amazing brother the bride is in the tent the bride is in the Resurrection The Bride is in the Rapture it's just what we got to do now is we're going to move on with the word believe the word to get this flesh out of the way that's all I pray that the other dimension is more real than this one we got to be if you got the Holy Ghost you will be more sensitive to the other dimension than this one I am Alpha and and Omega that's right the bridegroom was the alpha the bride is the Omega that's what the messenger said the alpha the Omega he started it now he's in the bride finishing it that's right to the Gentiles I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without our dogs and Sorcerers and arm mongers murderers idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches amazing I have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the braid and morning star and the spirit and the bride oh just the spirit no the spirit and the bride what a position she's in the spirit and the bride say come I believe this is the scripture our brother was referencing when he said come drink of the waters and he said the spirit and the bride say come not just the spirit amen but the bride and let him that heareth say come right and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely amen and the foolish virgin takes it but the warning is given right right don't add to it right and don't take away from it right or your name will be taken out of the book of life right amen that's right and you're a part out of the city and so on no wonder John said even so come Lord Jesus why when the bride has come to this spot and has got to endure all of this even so come even he said even so come Lord Jesus and he said he finished with this the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen amen why Abraham needed the grace of God that's right Moses David Joseph needed the grace of God and you and I need Grace if you're going to stand for the truth you need Grace to preach what our brother Mike Michael is preaching needs Grace to take that stand you need Grace to stay with the word you need Grace that's right without adding to it and taking from it you need Grace that's right it's going to be difficult and hard and even more harder for the ministry that's true yeah that's true why to stay with the truth that's right and not be influenced to compromise just to keep people in the church or just to have a bigger Church no no Jesus let it all go by his grace by by the grace of God to let it all go come back stay with the word stay with the truth amen God bless
