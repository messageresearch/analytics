[43:27] may it just fill our hearts and souls
[43:30] Lord may you speak to your people we ask
[43:34] we're asking you in Jesus Christ's name
[43:35] this morning amen and amen God bless you
[43:39] turn if you would to Ephesians chapter
[43:42] 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and God bless you
[43:46] each one it's a typical New Finland
[43:48] spring day it's rainy and it's windy and
[43:51] it's blustery amen but I was just
[43:53] sitting in the office and I was saying
[43:54] Lord thank you for this solid building
[43:56] he's given us and people that'll come in
[43:59] and gather in and worship under his name
[44:01] amen we're gathered under the banner of
[44:03] his name this morning certainly want to
[44:05] wish the mothers a Happy Mother's Day
[44:08] and then I was reading brother Jason
[44:09] dear shared a quote this morning he was
[44:13] I'll summarize it quickly and brother
[44:14] Braham said Womanhood is the backbone of
[44:17] the
[44:17] nation not fatherhood motherhood
[44:21] motherhood is the backbone of the nation
[44:23] how did he Define Womanhood he said it
[44:25] is the fine virtue that God gave for a
[44:28] woman to be a
[44:31] mother Hallelujah sisters you are in
[44:34] rare rare company today amen that God
[44:37] would call you scripture says that a
[44:39] woman will be saved in childbearing if
[44:41] they continue in the faith you know we
[44:44] look at that and the world would scoff
[44:45] at that how how masculine is that that's
[44:49] a a malale dominated idea no that's a
[44:51] god idea Amen to express those things
[44:54] and you know I've talked about this many
[44:55] times with my wife
[44:57] and I believe it God gives her
[44:59] childbearing to save her from
[45:01] herself you look at that God gives us
[45:04] fatherhood to save us from ourselves
[45:05] Amen on fatherhood it takes the man out
[45:07] of that Beast nature and it commits him
[45:09] to one but that woman is temp tempted to
[45:11] be drawn away she's tempted to be drawn
[45:14] away as Eve was and so God gave her God
[45:16] made her God put a desire in her to
[45:18] produce and and bear and and raise
[45:21] children and it saves her from what this
[45:23] world will give her otherwise because
[45:25] this world takes women and it spits them
[45:27] up and chews them up and spits them out
[45:29] and turns them out and they're more like
[45:30] a man than half the men today and what a
[45:32] shame that is when they could be such
[45:34] wonderful woman so I'm thankful we have
[45:36] Godly mothers I'm thankful for my Godly
[45:38] mother my mother went through a lot she
[45:40] went through a lot and she stayed true
[45:41] to God and God stayed true to her and
[45:44] I'm so thankful for that this morning
[45:46] amen so God bless you richly man it's
[45:48] good to see brother Paul and brother
[45:49] Wesley back with us as well amen and I
[45:53] certainly appreciated our annual special
[45:55] from sister Amber amen God bless you it
[45:58] is just wonderful it is just wonderful I
[46:00] so appreciate that and sister Lydia as
[46:02] well there you are used to you sitting a
[46:03] bit left amen well done well done she's
[46:06] uh really coming forward in her plane
[46:08] and you can see the the practice and the
[46:09] effort that's gone in there so God bless
[46:11] you both for that amen I'm praying for
[46:13] the day when we get two or three or
[46:15] maybe even four a year but we know we
[46:18] know I'm I'm teasing her I know and
[46:20] she's smiling she's taking it graciously
[46:22] um for now but um you know those things
[46:25] have to be led they have to be led you
[46:29] we'll get into it a bit this afternoon
[46:31] maybe Lord willing but in all things we
[46:34] have to be led amen we can have a gift
[46:37] and some gifts are very evident but the
[46:39] gift has to be anointed that's it it's
[46:42] that simple and so we can get up and we
[46:44] can make a wonderful noise and people
[46:46] could say what a wonderful thing it is
[46:47] but if it's not anointed it is a
[46:49] tinkling symbol that's all it is amen so
[46:52] God bless you certainly appreciated that
[46:54] this morning Ephesians 4
[46:57] Amen in verse 7 says but unto every one
[46:59] of us is given Grace according to the
[47:02] measure of the gift of Christ wherefore
[47:05] he saith when he ascended up on high he
[47:08] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[47:11] unto men amen God bless you you can have
[47:13] your seats this evening and we're
[47:15] turning yet another page and I want to
[47:17] take a a title this morning of finding
[47:19] your position and we're going to spend
[47:21] at least a couple services on this we've
[47:23] been speaking on adoption and we know
[47:24] that in the biblical ense adop option is
[47:27] the placing of the children into their
[47:28] foreordained position in the body of
[47:31] Christ and that position is what gives
[47:33] us our purpose day by day amen we're not
[47:36] supposed to go through our lives just
[47:37] saying well I'm just going to live my
[47:38] life today no we ought to live our lives
[47:40] with purpose we ought to say this is the
[47:42] day that the Lord has made I'll rejoice
[47:44] in it I'm going to do what he's called
[47:46] me to do and what I'm doing more
[47:48] importantly is what he has called me to
[47:50] do amen our will ought to be what God to
[47:52] find the will of God in our daily lives
[47:54] and then if we do that then whatever
[47:55] happens our our life is in his hands
[47:57] we've committed our life into his hands
[47:59] we've laid ourselves at his feet and
[48:01] said Lord use me and so whatever comes
[48:03] then we say Lord that's you working in
[48:05] my life for purpose and with that we
[48:07] know with that position with that
[48:09] purpose comes responsibility comes power
[48:11] comes Authority comes expectations
[48:13] benefits promises and until we're fully
[48:16] in position we can't realize all of
[48:17] those things God's trying to build us up
[48:19] to the place where he can use us where
[48:21] God can flow through us we we sang that
[48:24] song or sister Amber sang that song you
[48:25] know flow through me Holy Spirit when
[48:27] we're fully in position and we're
[48:29] surrendered the Holy Spirit can flow
[48:31] through us in a special way and that's
[48:33] when we get the greatest blessings in
[48:34] our life and sometimes what all God's
[48:36] waiting for us to do is recognize that
[48:38] where we are and what we're doing is
[48:41] exactly our adopted position and what
[48:43] happens then is we start to realize that
[48:45] God has ordained us to be here that God
[48:47] is in the things that we're doing and
[48:49] all of a sudden we can invite God we can
[48:51] expect God we can believe God for things
[48:53] that perhaps we didn't believe before I
[48:56] want to remind of a quote I read just a
[48:57] couple Services ago about the children
[48:59] of Israel on the way to Canaan as we
[49:02] talk about finding your position he said
[49:03] you're bound for the promised land amen
[49:06] how many are bound for the promised land
[49:07] this morning amen what is the promised
[49:09] land brother Braham said the promised
[49:10] land is the Holy Ghost in action in The
[49:13] Believer that's what it is it's the
[49:14] fullness of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[49:16] he says like God said to Joshua a very
[49:19] type of the new ones coming out he said
[49:21] you've been on this mountain for 40
[49:23] years wandering around and what did they
[49:25] do out there those 40 years did God
[49:28] curse them no he blessed them he says oh
[49:31] they married wives they grew good crops
[49:33] they raised babies they had a wonderful
[49:38] time he says God was with them but it
[49:41] still wasn't the promise they W went out
[49:45] there and they had no needs Church their
[49:48] clothes lasted 40 years I'm sure the
[49:50] sisters hated it cuz they never had to
[49:51] go get a new one the clothes never wore
[49:53] out the shoes never wore out the food
[49:55] was always there they had water when
[49:57] they needed it they had animals they had
[49:59] protection they had all of these things
[50:01] they had a cloud by day to keep the sun
[50:02] off of them they had a pillar of Fire by
[50:04] night to keep them safe so they could
[50:05] see all these things and yet they
[50:07] weren't living in the promise what's
[50:10] brother Braham saying he's saying you
[50:11] can be living a good clean Christian
[50:14] Life and not be in the promise you can
[50:17] be walking around and living to the best
[50:20] of your ability and you can have
[50:21] everything that this life
[50:24] needs but you may not be in the promise
[50:27] and when we don't just look at the
[50:28] provision of God in our day-to-day lives
[50:30] and say that's what makes me a Christian
[50:32] or that's what proves it because outside
[50:34] of Canaan God still met every need why
[50:36] because they were part of the family
[50:39] amen but they had to step up from being
[50:41] children to being adults they had to
[50:42] step into the promise they had to step
[50:44] into the inheritance and that's when you
[50:46] found out who really had it and who
[50:47] didn't who was just a part of the family
[50:49] and who was really going to live like
[50:51] they were a part of the family they were
[50:53] dead men walking they were living in a
[50:55] rut under the perfect blessing blessings
[50:56] of God but not the complete and full
[50:58] blessings Amen to live according to
[51:02] their full privileges they had to take
[51:03] the word of God and act on it that's
[51:05] what you'll see as we come into maturity
[51:07] as we come into adoption is we're acting
[51:09] on the word day by day you young people
[51:12] you can sit at home and you can sit
[51:14] there and Mom and Dad can pay for the
[51:16] roof over your house and they can pay
[51:18] for the food that you eat and you can
[51:20] sit there and you can relax and you can
[51:22] chill and everything's good but there's
[51:24] no satisfaction in that because what the
[51:27] nature of a child is to
[51:29] receive that's what children love they
[51:31] love gives my my youngest one is always
[51:34] telling me maybe we could buy me this
[51:36] maybe we could buy me that his latest
[51:37] one is a Lamborghini for the family
[51:39] maybe we could buy that for the family
[51:41] dad maybe we could do that this morning
[51:43] he said maybe we could buy a racing van
[51:45] with a spoiler on it a GT I said no no
[51:48] we're not going to do that well maybe we
[51:51] could get a blue one this is what he
[51:53] thinks everything is about getting and
[51:55] getting and getting and that's the
[51:57] childish nature amen but Jesus said it's
[52:00] more blessed to give than to receive
[52:02] amen and sometimes the issue is that we
[52:04] are sitting around and we are getting
[52:06] getting getting and we're never giving
[52:08] and then we wonder why life is not
[52:10] satisfying that's exactly the way it is
[52:12] you know sometimes the biggest problem
[52:13] with people trying to enjoy life is that
[52:15] they're trying to enjoy life the
[52:17] enjoyment comes from contrast it comes
[52:20] from giving and receiving it comes from
[52:22] doing and sitting still it comes from
[52:24] relaxing and working there's nothing
[52:26] more better at night than to lay your
[52:28] head down after having worked hard if
[52:31] we've sat around all day that's when we
[52:32] can't sleep when we're doing nothing
[52:34] we've got nothing to actually put us to
[52:36] sleep and most people are just trying to
[52:38] tick the next item on their bucket list
[52:40] and then they wonder why their life is
[52:42] empty it's because all they're doing is
[52:43] trying to get get get rather than to
[52:45] give give give that's some of the
[52:47] saddest most depressed people on the
[52:49] Earth you'll find is the ones that have
[52:50] everything there there's this this game
[52:52] out there and it's such a simple game
[52:54] it's all blocks called Minecraft the guy
[52:56] that sold it sold it for3 billion and
[52:59] they asked him they said how do you feel
[53:01] about this you know you're you're so
[53:02] wealthy he says I hate it he says
[53:04] because I can get anything I want and I
[53:06] don't have to wait for it he says and I
[53:08] can't trust people because they're after
[53:10] my money he says I don't have
[53:11] anticipation of anything because I know
[53:13] I can walk out and get it today if I
[53:15] really want it that's why you see
[53:17] amongst the the wealthy and the rich and
[53:19] the famous as they have issues with
[53:20] drugs they have issues with suicide they
[53:23] have issues with infidelity they have
[53:25] these massive public break down so many
[53:26] of the times why is because they're
[53:28] getting getting giving getting and
[53:30] there's no purpose in their giving it's
[53:32] all about themselves you know we don't
[53:35] want to just look at those things though
[53:36] we want to look at ourselves and you
[53:38] know sometimes we can look at our own
[53:39] lives and we can say I'm not satisfied
[53:41] as Christians you know what's not wrong
[53:45] sometimes that's God telling you there's
[53:46] more to life than what you're doing son
[53:48] there's more to doing what you're doing
[53:50] daughter that there's a higher plane
[53:51] there's a level that you can live at
[53:53] that will bring satisfaction into your
[53:55] life you you know we can have stability
[53:57] we can have Fellowship we can have a a
[53:59] nice church building we can have a
[54:01] pastor that shows up every service and
[54:02] all of these things but that is not the
[54:04] Christian walk that's the benefits of a
[54:06] Christian walk but that's not where our
[54:08] satisfaction is necessarily found it's
[54:10] something that we enjoy but it's not it
[54:12] amen we've got to step into purpose
[54:14] we've got to step into position to have
[54:16] that inner contentment we can look at it
[54:18] from a standpoint of internal hunger you
[54:21] know because there's something in me
[54:22] that calls out for certain things and
[54:24] what happens remember brother Bram says
[54:26] he says there's a there's an empty spot
[54:28] in your life that's meant for
[54:30] God Amen there's an empty spot that's
[54:33] meant for the Holy Spirit to dwell for
[54:34] God to dwell and he says and all the
[54:36] world is trying to satisfy that hunger
[54:39] and the only thing that will satisfy it
[54:40] is God but there's a hunger and there's
[54:42] a thirst constantly and that's why we
[54:44] see people going to such extremes today
[54:46] even within the confines of this message
[54:48] is they're seeking a satisfaction
[54:50] through Doctrine through Revelation
[54:52] through shouting through the next
[54:53] Revival through this and that and other
[54:55] and what is it they're seeking is really
[54:57] God to come live in their lives that's
[54:59] the satisfaction they need is when he's
[55:01] dwelling and living through them in
[55:03] these sort of things we can eat so much
[55:05] in this life and yet be
[55:07] unsatisfied amen it takes God to satisfy
[55:10] those things amen but there's a remedy
[55:12] for that hunger and Jesus said this and
[55:14] I'm going to use the Amplified a number
[55:15] of times today Jesus said this is after
[55:18] he spoke to the woman at the well he
[55:20] goes out of his way he climbs up to
[55:22] Samaria and he talks to this woman and
[55:25] the then the the the the disciples come
[55:27] up to them and they're talking to them
[55:29] and Jesus said to them I am fed in other
[55:33] words my Hunger is Satisfied by doing
[55:36] the will of the one who sent me and by
[55:39] completing his work by doing and
[55:42] completing that's why he's the author
[55:43] and the finisher of our faith because
[55:44] when he starts it he finishes it amen
[55:46] but he says I'm not just satisfied in
[55:48] doing it but I'm satisfied when the work
[55:51] is done anden there's a way that we have
[55:53] to go and I brother Mark with me some
[55:56] things that brother Paul Aon was talking
[55:58] about a while ago and he was saying how
[56:00] God's not just interested in starters
[56:02] he's interested in finishers Paul said
[56:04] you did run well what did hinder thee
[56:06] there's lots of people that start we
[56:08] read that parable of the s or a portion
[56:10] of it I believe last service where lots
[56:12] of people start with the word but how
[56:14] many produce it to its full benefit amen
[56:17] it's not just the starters account it's
[56:19] the finishers you know what I'm a
[56:20] horrible starter I am the king of I used
[56:23] to be the king of proc procrastination I
[56:25] can't do it anymore I don't have that
[56:26] Liberty anymore but I in by Nature I'm a
[56:30] horrible starter but you know what I'm
[56:33] the world's best finisher once I get
[56:36] started I don't stop there's no stopping
[56:38] me but it takes me a while to decide if
[56:41] what I'm going to start is worth the
[56:42] time and effort and that's the internal
[56:45] question is always is it worth it is it
[56:47] worth it but once I decide it's worth it
[56:49] my mind's made up and I'm going to go
[56:50] all the way to the Finish Line amen if
[56:53] we're seeking satisfaction sometimes
[56:55] what happens is we start and we never
[56:57] finish we've got to finish what we start
[56:59] and we've got to make sure that what
[57:00] we're starting is the leading of the
[57:02] Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen and then
[57:04] what happens then is even when you're
[57:05] tired even when you're worn out even
[57:07] when you're weary even when you got to
[57:09] go work in the salt mines yet again then
[57:11] what is it there's something inside of
[57:13] you that's feeding on God and it's
[57:15] driving you forward amen these days I
[57:17] get one night one night off of a week I
[57:20] work during the days and then Monday
[57:21] night I study Tuesday night I study
[57:23] Wednesday night I preach Thursday night
[57:25] I have a Bible study Friday night's my
[57:27] one night off and then Saturday I study
[57:28] and then Sunday's preaching again but in
[57:31] all of that I'm never more content than
[57:34] I've been these last few years why
[57:37] because there's a hunger to be found in
[57:40] purpose there's a hunger to be doing
[57:43] what God wants me to do and as long as
[57:45] I'm doing that that doesn't mean I don't
[57:47] like a break that doesn't mean I don't
[57:49] get tired that doesn't mean that I don't
[57:51] sometimes groan and say I've got to go
[57:52] sit in front of that computer for
[57:53] another 4 hours tonight absolutely Ely
[57:56] but that doesn't change a thing why
[57:58] because there's a satisfaction that
[57:59] comes out of it because the fruit of it
[58:02] is lives that are changed and I look at
[58:04] that and I say that ain't me that can't
[58:06] be me that's God and so I'm satisfied
[58:08] because he's using me that's the
[58:11] satisfaction is when we see something
[58:12] that he does that that nobody else can
[58:15] do and I know in myself I can't do it
[58:17] the world today is just looking to loaf
[58:19] through life isn't that living for the
[58:21] weekend work life balance chill relax
[58:24] that's what the world wants to do and
[58:26] what happens is they're not even happy
[58:29] all they want is more chill more relaxed
[58:30] not realizing that that's not where
[58:32] their satisfaction going to be that's
[58:35] satanic you all know how I know it's
[58:37] satanic because in the very beginning
[58:40] God put Adam on this Earth not to chill
[58:42] and relax he put them there to care and
[58:44] dress for the Garden of Eden even under
[58:47] Perfection under sinlessness we have
[58:50] work to do we're meant to do something
[58:53] for the kingdom of God for the kingdom
[58:55] of heaven amen so if we got if we've got
[58:57] to do that when we're in Perfection we
[58:59] definitely have to do it now because you
[59:01] know Idle Hands are Satan's playground
[59:04] God has something for us to do brother
[59:06] BR says this in the message faith is our
[59:08] Victory he says but let me tell you
[59:09] something tonight you're going to wind
[59:11] up at a destination one of these days
[59:14] and that's going to be in the Valley of
[59:15] the Shadows of death he said I would
[59:17] advise you at this hour to prepare to
[59:19] meet the god that will have to meet you
[59:21] at that hour now listen to this you'll
[59:24] either meet him as a master piece that
[59:26] he has worked on or a floating piece of
[59:29] Driftwood to go into your final
[59:33] destination he says so don't you use
[59:35] this life just to drift around and Float
[59:37] around get a better job and dress better
[59:40] get a new television or a better car
[59:42] life means more than that don't you try
[59:45] to just use it just to say well if the
[59:47] rest of them join church I will too he
[59:50] says we've got to have a purpose for
[59:52] something brother baham said this and
[59:55] for the sake of time I didn't put it
[59:56] there to read it but I'll paraphrase it
[59:58] he says we don't just go to church
[59:59] because there's a church there you know
[1:00:02] what happens so often and I'm seeing
[1:00:03] this more more message ranks is we go
[1:00:05] find a job and then we say is is there a
[1:00:07] church there oh there's a church there
[1:00:09] good I'm good and you know what happens
[1:00:11] is people go there and they find out the
[1:00:13] pastor's not to their liking they don't
[1:00:14] mix well with the people and then they
[1:00:16] got to go find another job and another
[1:00:18] church and another job and another
[1:00:19] church and they're moving from Pillar To
[1:00:21] Post because what they're seeking
[1:00:23] themselves first and then saying well
[1:00:24] all I need is a message Church no you
[1:00:26] need a god-ordained pastor that will
[1:00:29] feed you because I can't feed everyone
[1:00:31] and not every Pastor feeds everyone some
[1:00:34] people need a calmer quieter Pastor some
[1:00:36] need a fireball some need more of a
[1:00:38] teacher some need more of a Preacher
[1:00:40] some need a more Evangelical
[1:00:42] style but what happens is instead we say
[1:00:44] well I got what I want and then I'll
[1:00:46] just trust God that the church will work
[1:00:47] out no we seek God's will for our church
[1:00:49] first for where we're going to go do
[1:00:52] they line up listen you got to know who
[1:00:54] where you're going you got to know where
[1:00:56] going you might be walking into some
[1:00:57] place that's full of fanaticism that's
[1:00:59] full of cold formalism that's off on the
[1:01:01] uh on the right hand or the left side on
[1:01:03] Doctrine we've got to know these things
[1:01:06] we don't just go someplace because
[1:01:07] there's a message church we better know
[1:01:09] what we're walking into but I like what
[1:01:12] he says here because what he's saying is
[1:01:13] you can be a Christian and still be
[1:01:15] floating just going along well what is
[1:01:17] be what will be is what will be and I'm
[1:01:20] just going to float through life and
[1:01:21] whatever happens happens and he says no
[1:01:23] we're supposed to be a masterpiece we're
[1:01:25] supposed to be something that God is
[1:01:27] working on Amen and that happens by
[1:01:29] Revelation it happens by Revelation that
[1:01:31] what we're going through is not just
[1:01:33] happen stance that it's not just events
[1:01:35] and it's not just Karma or luck or these
[1:01:38] different things but God is working and
[1:01:39] shaping Us in everything that we're
[1:01:41] going through in our life and we allow
[1:01:43] him we allow him to work on us we learn
[1:01:47] from these things we grow from these
[1:01:48] things amen we got to know that we're in
[1:01:51] God's
[1:01:52] Will and we're going to take a service
[1:01:54] in the not too distant future on how I
[1:01:56] find God's will for my life because it's
[1:01:58] so much hinges on finding his will on
[1:02:00] prayerfully seeking his will but today
[1:02:02] we want to talk more on finding your
[1:02:04] position and let's go back to Ephesians
[1:02:06] 4 where we open the scriptures up he
[1:02:09] said but unto every one of us no
[1:02:13] exceptions he says unto every one of us
[1:02:15] is given Grace according to the measure
[1:02:18] of the gift of Christ so each one of us
[1:02:20] has a portion of the gift of Christ and
[1:02:22] it's by Grace we can't add to it we
[1:02:24] can't take away from it we have what we
[1:02:27] have and it's God that gave us to us
[1:02:29] amen every single one of us we can't
[1:02:31] force it we can't remove it it's all of
[1:02:34] God's choosing he says wherefore he
[1:02:36] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[1:02:38] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:02:41] men now he talks about the fivefold
[1:02:43] ministry in verse 11 he says he gave
[1:02:45] some Apostles some prophets some
[1:02:47] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:02:50] these men are gifts themselves and these
[1:02:52] men have gifts they have gifts and they
[1:02:54] are gifts he says what it's for for the
[1:02:57] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:02:59] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:03:01] body of Christ till when till we all
[1:03:04] come in the unity of the faith and of
[1:03:06] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:03:08] perfect man a mature man a complete man
[1:03:12] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:03:14] fullness of Christ now we've preached on
[1:03:17] this many many times so we're not going
[1:03:18] to cover it in in depth this this
[1:03:20] morning but you know I was as I was
[1:03:22] studying these things I came across a
[1:03:24] quote that certainly helped me and I
[1:03:26] wanted to drop it in this morning
[1:03:28] because we can get very carinal about
[1:03:30] what it h what it means to preach the
[1:03:31] word of God and by that I mean we can
[1:03:34] say this is what it looks like this is
[1:03:36] what it sounds like this is the way it
[1:03:38] will be and it is completely
[1:03:41] carnal there is no one style to preach
[1:03:44] the gospel there is no one way of
[1:03:46] preaching the gospel there is no one
[1:03:49] preference for these things it is our
[1:03:51] own preferences that determine that and
[1:03:54] it is not necessarily A God if you look
[1:03:56] at the Scriptures it says we're not to
[1:03:58] seek after teachers that tell us what we
[1:04:00] want to hear and sometimes it's the way
[1:04:02] we want to hear it rather than what
[1:04:03] they're actually saying I've been in
[1:04:05] Services where the people are so worked
[1:04:07] up that the minister says something that
[1:04:09] doesn't literally mean a thing and
[1:04:10] people are jumping up and screaming and
[1:04:12] shouting you know what it tells me
[1:04:14] they're caught up in a spirit not under
[1:04:15] the spirit because they're not
[1:04:17] responding to the word they're
[1:04:18] responding to the emotion but I want you
[1:04:20] to talk I want us to look at this amen
[1:04:23] because we we've we've spoke about this
[1:04:25] before about when Jesus was was was
[1:04:27] reading Isaiah 61 and he said he that
[1:04:30] the spirit of the Lord is upon me to to
[1:04:32] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:04:34] Deliverance to the captives the
[1:04:35] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:04:37] at Liberty them are bruised that's a
[1:04:39] freedom sermon that's a liberty sermon
[1:04:41] that's a power of the Holy Ghost sermon
[1:04:44] and yet we know that what happened there
[1:04:45] when Jesus is preaching this is he's not
[1:04:48] running around like a man on fire but
[1:04:50] today we'd say if you're preaching that
[1:04:52] then that preacher better be going up
[1:04:53] and down and up and down the A and the
[1:04:55] people better be hooping and hollering
[1:04:56] cuz the holy spirit's here to set us
[1:04:58] free but remember what brother Braham
[1:05:01] said about this he says now we would
[1:05:04] think if such anointing was on him had
[1:05:07] been prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:05:09] would come and here he was with that
[1:05:11] type of anointing the full blessing and
[1:05:14] anointing of the Lord upon him we would
[1:05:16] want to run all over the building scream
[1:05:18] and holler but the Bible said he laid
[1:05:20] down the scroll and sat down and
[1:05:22] precious words proceeded from his mouth
[1:05:25] he says that's what he done under the
[1:05:27] anointing the anointing is not emotion
[1:05:31] now I'm not here to say there's no
[1:05:32] emotion with the
[1:05:34] anointing that's
[1:05:36] Antichrist God gave us emotions amen God
[1:05:40] gave us feelings and that should be part
[1:05:42] and parcel of this but that is not the
[1:05:44] anointing because I feel something does
[1:05:46] not mean I am anointed and because you
[1:05:48] feel something doesn't mean you're
[1:05:49] anointed he says but the anointing is
[1:05:53] supreme power in control knowing exactly
[1:05:56] what and how I want to ask you something
[1:06:01] when brother Brandon was
[1:06:03] praying over the people in the prayer
[1:06:06] lines is he
[1:06:08] shouting is he
[1:06:09] screaming is he yelling is he sweating
[1:06:13] profusely is he hollering is he taking
[1:06:16] his head and shoving them down to the
[1:06:18] floor
[1:06:19] 99.9% of the time he is just praying a
[1:06:22] simple humble prayer
[1:06:26] with
[1:06:28] authority why because he knew Devils
[1:06:31] aren't cast out cuz you shout healing
[1:06:33] isn't brought because we
[1:06:35] scream right people aren't delivered by
[1:06:37] shoving them down to the floor under the
[1:06:40] anointing what he knew what and how God
[1:06:43] wanted him to do and he simply spoke
[1:06:46] it we don't see Jesus listed as a
[1:06:49] screaming
[1:06:50] preacher that's not what he was known
[1:06:52] for he simply spoke and things happened
[1:06:57] amen it's not by shouting that things
[1:06:59] happen it's by the word anointed and
[1:07:02] quickened by the holy spirit that things
[1:07:04] happen amen I don't have a problem with
[1:07:06] screaming shouting preachers sometimes I
[1:07:08] wish I was more of a screaming shouting
[1:07:09] preacher because that's human nature is
[1:07:11] to like that for most of us but that's
[1:07:14] not the way it is and that's not what
[1:07:16] changes things it's the holy ghost that
[1:07:18] changes things under the Vindication of
[1:07:20] that word that's the only way that
[1:07:22] things happen it's when the word of God
[1:07:24] has quickened us that that's when things
[1:07:26] happen I wanted to share this quote
[1:07:28] that's coming up here now and this is
[1:07:30] that's not the one I was talking about
[1:07:31] it's this one I was talking about
[1:07:33] because we have a five-fold
[1:07:35] Ministry we've got prophets we've got
[1:07:37] Apostles we've got teachers evangelists
[1:07:39] and pastors and each one of them has a
[1:07:41] way of bringing things and even amongst
[1:07:43] each of those five categories they have
[1:07:44] different ways of presenting the word of
[1:07:46] God and yet if we insist on preachers
[1:07:48] being all the same way we lose out on
[1:07:50] the blessing we lose out on the blessing
[1:07:53] amen we've had preachers come here and
[1:07:55] and I hope you see that I don't just
[1:07:56] invite the the ones that are are loud
[1:07:59] and and running all the time and I don't
[1:08:01] always just bring the quiet ones but
[1:08:02] we've had it from one extreme to the
[1:08:04] other and we've had tremendous Services
[1:08:06] under men that just stand here and
[1:08:07] preach absolutely phenomenal and the
[1:08:10] Discerning of the Holy Spirit sometimes
[1:08:12] is even sharper in those meetings than
[1:08:14] they are when the man is running around
[1:08:15] screaming but through it all God has
[1:08:17] blessed us has he not why we're a mature
[1:08:20] church we take the gifts of God as they
[1:08:22] come to us and that's the way it ought
[1:08:23] to be now this quote I'm about to read
[1:08:25] to you brother Bram is talking about the
[1:08:27] experience of Portland Oregon where that
[1:08:29] crazy man came at him said I'm going to
[1:08:30] kill you I'm going to wreck you I'm
[1:08:32] going to destroy you I'm going to break
[1:08:33] up the meeting and brother brandom says
[1:08:34] and he says it wasn't me the holy spirit
[1:08:36] says because you have challenged who the
[1:08:39] Holy Spirit you will fall across my feet
[1:08:42] and when he did it that man charged
[1:08:43] towards him the Holy Spirit knocked him
[1:08:45] down at his feet pinned him to the floor
[1:08:47] and brother Bram said all the demons and
[1:08:49] all the sickness in that building left
[1:08:51] it was a complete and total healing of
[1:08:53] the entire people in the building
[1:08:55] because they Champion had been destroyed
[1:08:56] had been defeated they said but I want
[1:08:58] you to see read this because what would
[1:09:00] happen is I know ministers we want to
[1:09:02] have a Ministry just like brother Brams
[1:09:04] don't we sure why wouldn't we why
[1:09:07] wouldn't we want to have the most
[1:09:08] powerful Ministry the world has seen
[1:09:09] since Christ was here but we're not all
[1:09:12] called to that he's a prophet he's the
[1:09:15] prophet there's only one of him ain't
[1:09:18] nobody going to replicate him but in our
[1:09:20] carnal nature we would say we ought to
[1:09:23] be just like brother brandham listen to
[1:09:25] this you'll never find that in scripture
[1:09:27] the five-fold ministry is all varying
[1:09:28] types of different people he says Tommy
[1:09:31] hosb he he just told the story and he
[1:09:33] said Tommy osbor happened to be sitting
[1:09:35] looking at that he went home got a
[1:09:37] hammer nails and nailed the door open
[1:09:39] and said I I ain't coming out of here
[1:09:41] God till you do something for me he said
[1:09:43] I'm staying right here he saw that
[1:09:45] brother brandham had something he didn't
[1:09:47] have and he said God I'm not moving
[1:09:49] until you give it to
[1:09:51] me is God going to give it to him he
[1:09:54] said he prayed for several days he came
[1:09:56] down was sitting on the porch brother
[1:09:58] Bosworth was sitting with me and he said
[1:10:00] brother Tommy Osborne said brother Bram
[1:10:02] do you think God would answer my prayer
[1:10:05] now notice he said I'm not coming out of
[1:10:06] here until you do something for me but
[1:10:08] he came out eventually because God
[1:10:10] hadn't done something for
[1:10:12] him he said and brother Braham said now
[1:10:15] look brother osbor get started on the
[1:10:17] right foot he says now you can make a
[1:10:19] lot of noise or anything and people will
[1:10:22] follow you but remember your ministry
[1:10:25] you'll answer before God for it
[1:10:29] someday he says I said there sits an old
[1:10:32] oak tree on my porch referring to
[1:10:34] brother Bosworth I said who knows about
[1:10:36] Divine Healing crawl up under the tree
[1:10:39] and talk to him a little while the
[1:10:41] prophet of God did not say I can tell
[1:10:44] you he says go listen to that
[1:10:46] experienced man there he says he says I
[1:10:50] said if you've been called with a gift
[1:10:52] you'd have known it way back Yonder
[1:10:54] gifts and callings are without
[1:10:56] repentance you're at least a preacher
[1:10:58] and every preacher by general orders are
[1:11:00] to pray for the sick not only preachers
[1:11:03] but the deacons and the lay members he
[1:11:06] quotes scripture pray ye one for another
[1:11:08] every Christian in here has just as much
[1:11:10] right to pray for the sick as I brother
[1:11:12] Bosworth brother Baxter brother Roberts
[1:11:14] or any other man is notice what he's
[1:11:15] saying he he's saying brother you would
[1:11:17] already have it if God intended it for
[1:11:20] you in this
[1:11:22] way but he says go talk to brother
[1:11:24] Bosworth and he'll get you set straight
[1:11:26] on this but notice what he says he's
[1:11:28] saying it's not that these things can't
[1:11:30] follow you because you're authorized
[1:11:32] you're instructed to pray and when you
[1:11:35] pray things should happen but the gift
[1:11:38] of brother brandham was not just praying
[1:11:40] God was with him in a very special way
[1:11:42] he had a gift of healing he had a gift
[1:11:44] of faith in these
[1:11:45] things now catch what brother brandham
[1:11:47] says here now he's saying everybody's
[1:11:49] authorized to pray the prayer is not
[1:11:50] what makes me special prayer is not
[1:11:52] what's going to make you special he says
[1:11:54] and what do these men do all the ones he
[1:11:56] just listed himself brother Bosworth
[1:11:57] Baxter Roberts all these other ones he
[1:11:59] says the only thing they can do is
[1:12:02] preach the word of God so clear that
[1:12:05] you'd see it and accept it he say
[1:12:08] there's nothing in the man that would
[1:12:09] heal nothing in his prayer that would
[1:12:11] heal here stood a guy standing here
[1:12:13] maybe he's standing here an unbeliever
[1:12:15] and I could pray for him all night long
[1:12:17] with a toothache and never heal him he's
[1:12:20] got to have the faith it's that man he
[1:12:24] says it wasn't I could heal him but he's
[1:12:26] got to have the Faith of Christ to
[1:12:28] receive his healing he says see see what
[1:12:30] I mean notice the first thing he says
[1:12:32] they've got to preach the word of God so
[1:12:33] clear that you'd see it and accept it
[1:12:35] what is the word of God for the
[1:12:36] preaching of the word of God for faith
[1:12:39] faith cometh by hearing not just reading
[1:12:43] not just reading by hearing because God
[1:12:45] has anointed a five-fold Ministry to
[1:12:47] break these things down for the people
[1:12:49] amen he says so brother Osborne did just
[1:12:53] that he got with brother BOS and stayed
[1:12:55] with him for about a year or so I guess
[1:12:57] or something like that different places
[1:12:59] till he found all the techniques of how
[1:13:02] to use the scriptures he says I met him
[1:13:06] here not long ago in New York when he
[1:13:07] was standing in Cuba there different
[1:13:10] places the man had 20 or 30,000 people
[1:13:12] in the congregation and I said are you
[1:13:14] tired brother osbor he said I've never
[1:13:17] laid my hand on a person said what have
[1:13:19] I got to be tired about I just preach 30
[1:13:21] minutes or go home and go
[1:13:23] home okay okay he's done exactly what
[1:13:26] brother brandham told him to do and
[1:13:28] brother Bram says how do you do it cuz
[1:13:32] brother bram's experience in Ministry is
[1:13:34] completely different from TL osburn's
[1:13:37] brother brandham goes through a meetings
[1:13:39] and he comes out just rung just
[1:13:42] completely so completely tired out of
[1:13:45] his mind half the time so worn out so
[1:13:48] overcome by what God was using him and
[1:13:52] then he goes to TL osbor TL osbor says
[1:13:55] what have I got to be tired
[1:13:58] about he says brother I stand out there
[1:14:01] and I take the word of God said now
[1:14:04] don't come talk about gifts and things
[1:14:06] like this the gift that I have is
[1:14:08] explaining the word of God he said and
[1:14:11] the word of God will defeat Satan he's
[1:14:13] saying I don't need gifts to destroy
[1:14:16] Satan I don't need gifts to defeat Satan
[1:14:18] all I need is the word of God he says
[1:14:21] and that's the truth it'll defeat Satan
[1:14:23] anywhere any place any time and he
[1:14:26] begins to explain and tell and just
[1:14:29] moves in the word like that till Satan
[1:14:32] is so well built in he can't move see we
[1:14:37] want the hype we want the emotion we
[1:14:39] want the excitement we want the buildup
[1:14:41] we want the dynamic delivery but that's
[1:14:43] what's not that's not promised that's
[1:14:45] possible but it's not promised but what
[1:14:48] look at Paul Paul put a guy to
[1:14:51] sleep Paul put a guy to sleep the
[1:14:55] prophet of the age put a man to sleep
[1:14:57] with his
[1:14:59] preaching Dynamic delivery is not
[1:15:03] guaranteed but what is Promised is when
[1:15:05] a real Holy Ghost filled God called man
[1:15:09] comes the word will expose Satan and it
[1:15:12] will show God in his power amen and
[1:15:15] brother bam saying what's happening here
[1:15:17] is that brother Bosworth can take the
[1:15:19] word and he can preach it until Satan
[1:15:22] can't move in your life he'll show you
[1:15:25] exactly where Satan is what he's doing
[1:15:27] what your rights are what your property
[1:15:29] is he says and now you don't have to do
[1:15:31] anything Satan is boxed in he's
[1:15:32] powerless as soon as Satan is exposed
[1:15:34] church he loses his power because it's
[1:15:37] obvious what he is what's the purpose of
[1:15:40] the preaching of the word to inspire
[1:15:41] faith in the people and so when you can
[1:15:43] expose Satan in their lives and show
[1:15:46] them what God has for them then Satan
[1:15:47] has to leave if they'll believe it
[1:15:50] that's the Simplicity of it amen when we
[1:15:53] preach that way then what happens is if
[1:15:55] you've got a demon in your life when he
[1:15:58] is
[1:15:59] exposed it's not about you then I'm not
[1:16:02] preaching at you I'm preaching to expose
[1:16:05] Satan and then he's exposed in your life
[1:16:07] and then you simply have a choice kick
[1:16:08] him out or hold on to him that's it but
[1:16:11] you will have to make a choice because
[1:16:12] the word will make it so clear that you
[1:16:14] have to make a choice that you
[1:16:16] understand what's going on in your life
[1:16:17] listen the emotions come and go emotions
[1:16:20] come and go we can have the world's best
[1:16:22] set of meetings and we can walk out and
[1:16:25] we can lose it all on Monday if if we
[1:16:26] don't have something in our lives day by
[1:16:28] day if we can rest on the word of God
[1:16:31] day by day not on the hype and the
[1:16:33] emotion of a special meetings or a great
[1:16:35] Minister that came through but if we can
[1:16:37] rest because the word is in our lives
[1:16:39] and that is our foundation then that's
[1:16:41] where we get the victory from amen
[1:16:43] listen too many people are coming to
[1:16:45] church for the preacher to put into them
[1:16:46] what they don't have themselves it
[1:16:48] doesn't work that way I can't give you
[1:16:50] the Holy Ghost I can't give you the word
[1:16:53] into your life I can present it to you
[1:16:54] like brother Gerald always used to say I
[1:16:56] lay it in their laps right brother
[1:16:58] Gerald lay it in your laps but you got
[1:16:59] to pick it up you got to take the sword
[1:17:02] in your hand you got to take the word
[1:17:03] and put it in your mouth you got to take
[1:17:05] the word and run it through your
[1:17:06] thoughts and you got to start fighting
[1:17:08] your own battles because when that
[1:17:09] preacher leaves when the pastor leaves
[1:17:11] the pulpit when this the the special
[1:17:13] Ministry that comes through is gone back
[1:17:15] to where they come from then you've got
[1:17:16] to live you've got to survive you've got
[1:17:18] to have Victory you've got to have
[1:17:19] overcoming power you've got to have
[1:17:21] Direction and leadership in your life
[1:17:23] that means you got to have more than
[1:17:25] that because what happens is your
[1:17:26] Victory is not here your Victory is in
[1:17:28] here you got to have victory in here cuz
[1:17:30] Victory is a life it's a person not just
[1:17:33] an event not just a set of
[1:17:35] meetings so brother braham's looking at
[1:17:37] TL OS saying how do you do this and
[1:17:40] brother TL's Osburn says I just preach
[1:17:42] until Satan's completely boxed in and he
[1:17:43] can't
[1:17:44] move that's his
[1:17:46] gift brother Bram says the audience sees
[1:17:49] it he said how many of you will believe
[1:17:51] and want to accept it they raise their
[1:17:52] hands like that he says come up here and
[1:17:54] test testify and brother osbor gets in a
[1:17:56] chair sits down listens for about 2 or 3
[1:17:58] hours to them testify what the word has
[1:18:01] power the word has effect and they sit
[1:18:03] there and they hear them preach and
[1:18:05] they're delivered and then they come up
[1:18:06] and testify of it he says I don't even
[1:18:08] have to lay a hand on
[1:18:11] them he says listen to them testify say
[1:18:14] hallelujah and go on home come back the
[1:18:15] next night explain it again he says gets
[1:18:18] more done of the Lord what then if he
[1:18:21] was off seeking special gifts to try and
[1:18:23] have a Ministry like brother brandham
[1:18:25] he says the man is Right absolutely
[1:18:30] 100% you just sit there and box Satan in
[1:18:32] to expose Satan to make it to where he
[1:18:34] can't move that was his gift that was
[1:18:37] his ministry not laying on of hands not
[1:18:39] running prayer lines just simply explain
[1:18:42] the word in Clarity so the people can
[1:18:44] grab Faith he says no fundamentalists or
[1:18:46] nobody else could put a finger on it cuz
[1:18:48] that there there it is in the word of
[1:18:51] the Lord so when we're bringing
[1:18:53] ministers in when I'm deciding who to
[1:18:54] bring in I don't say Lord give me what
[1:18:57] we want by no means Lord Give me give us
[1:19:01] what we need and help us to accept it in
[1:19:03] the way it comes cuz some some preachers
[1:19:06] come in and they're like a a a punch to
[1:19:08] the face and sometimes we need that
[1:19:11] don't we I heard a couple Giggles
[1:19:12] sometimes we need somebody to just come
[1:19:13] in and let us have it CU what we've had
[1:19:16] it easy for a while and we've done
[1:19:17] nothing about it so God's got to come in
[1:19:19] and really hammer it and sometimes he
[1:19:20] just comes in in gentle sweet Simplicity
[1:19:23] of the preaching of the word
[1:19:25] amen all these different ways but if
[1:19:28] we're mature we'll we'll accept them as
[1:19:30] God brings them in Paul continues in
[1:19:33] Ephesians 4 here's the effect that we
[1:19:35] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:19:37] and fro and carried about with every
[1:19:39] wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and
[1:19:41] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:19:43] weight to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:19:45] and love may grow up into him in all
[1:19:48] things which is the head even Christ
[1:19:51] then we have verse 16 I took this from
[1:19:53] the Amplified and this is where we're
[1:19:54] going to preach the last half of this
[1:19:56] service he says from him the whole body
[1:19:59] the church in all its various parts
[1:20:02] joined and knitted firmly together by
[1:20:05] what every joint supplies when each part
[1:20:08] is working properly causes the body to
[1:20:11] grow and mature building itself up in
[1:20:14] Love Now Paul says he gives three
[1:20:16] answers there and we're going to talk
[1:20:17] about one how does it happen how does it
[1:20:20] happen he says it's when we are joined
[1:20:23] and knitted firmly together
[1:20:25] by what every joint supplies in other
[1:20:28] words that happens when we get into
[1:20:30] position but not what when not just when
[1:20:32] we get into position but when we're
[1:20:35] connected see that's what matters if
[1:20:37] your muscles aren't tied together then
[1:20:39] your joints can't move everything can
[1:20:41] pivot like likely but You' got to have
[1:20:44] those joints you got to have those
[1:20:45] tendons you got to have those muscles
[1:20:46] there to make it work together and so
[1:20:48] each one of us individually brings that
[1:20:51] portion of Christ that portion of Grace
[1:20:53] that gift that purpose to the body but
[1:20:55] we can't just bring it we've got to be
[1:20:57] joined into the body we can't sit here
[1:21:00] and say well well I've got a gift of
[1:21:02] this if we're not working with somebody
[1:21:04] else if we're not connected with the
[1:21:05] body we're outside of the body then
[1:21:07] we're just an injection of some sort
[1:21:08] we're not a part of the body we might be
[1:21:10] a help but we're not a part of the body
[1:21:12] brother Braham says this in Jehovah Gyra
[1:21:14] he says we pray that you'll receive
[1:21:16] those tonight who raise their hands and
[1:21:18] may they receive Jehovah gyr's provided
[1:21:20] sacrifice for their sins tonight and
[1:21:22] each of them be taken into the kingdom
[1:21:24] peace Y and given eternal life now catch
[1:21:27] this he says and then baptized by the
[1:21:29] Holy Ghost into the Church of the Living
[1:21:31] God and positionally placed into the
[1:21:34] body as a position to work with whom
[1:21:39] with the members of the body of Christ
[1:21:43] so it doesn't R what what role you play
[1:21:45] it doesn't matter what role you play
[1:21:47] whether you're most outgoing person
[1:21:48] whether you're the most introverted
[1:21:49] person you've got to be able to work
[1:21:51] with others in the body of Christ amen
[1:21:53] there's no Rogue
[1:21:55] elements in the body that's not it we're
[1:21:58] all together that word joined and
[1:22:00] knitted the original word there is
[1:22:02] compacted in the scriptures and it means
[1:22:04] to intertwine ideas and gifts and to
[1:22:08] consider what the other person says and
[1:22:10] brings and put it together into its
[1:22:12] proper conclusion or place so in other
[1:22:16] words I don't have it all you don't have
[1:22:19] it all but together we can produce it
[1:22:22] all amen each one of us is is required
[1:22:25] amen I can't do it all you can't do it
[1:22:26] all but under the leadership of the Holy
[1:22:28] Spirit under the headship of Christ we
[1:22:31] can do what is needed for the body to do
[1:22:33] amen like I said there's there's no
[1:22:34] Rogue members you say well I'm an
[1:22:36] evangelist evangelists have to have a
[1:22:37] home Church Apostles have to have a home
[1:22:41] Church they may go out but they've got
[1:22:43] to be a part of the body and we would
[1:22:45] support them we would send them out we
[1:22:46] would give them the finances they need
[1:22:48] we'd help their family when they're gone
[1:22:50] in these things because you're not a
[1:22:51] lone unit the only description of a
[1:22:54] sheep itself is lost in the scriptures
[1:22:56] amen we're part of a family we're part
[1:22:58] of a body you imagine we had the world's
[1:23:00] best musician here but if they can't get
[1:23:01] along with other musicians what's the
[1:23:03] point can you imagine amen we get the
[1:23:07] best song leader but he's off we've got
[1:23:08] the best song
[1:23:10] leaders but if they go off in their own
[1:23:13] thing and it's all a show about them
[1:23:14] then what's the point that's not worship
[1:23:17] that's not benefiting the body that's
[1:23:18] just showing off their talents and their
[1:23:19] gifts that's not what it's there for
[1:23:22] even as a pastor this Church doesn't
[1:23:25] function if we all look to
[1:23:27] me and that's why we have officers of
[1:23:30] the church that's why we have helps in
[1:23:32] the church that's why we have people
[1:23:33] that we delegate things to is because I
[1:23:35] can't be all of those things I'm not
[1:23:37] meant to be all those things I'm not
[1:23:39] called to be all those things and so God
[1:23:41] sends gifts into this body to do those
[1:23:43] things amen not only just from a a lady
[1:23:46] standpoint but to bring other ministers
[1:23:48] in and to help and support I don't know
[1:23:51] it all brother Mark shared some things
[1:23:53] with me and I I responded by back to him
[1:23:54] and I said I'm glad you shared this with
[1:23:56] me because I didn't have that I needed
[1:23:58] that brother to fill in that gap for me
[1:24:00] I wasn't sure where to place that or
[1:24:01] what to do with it what is it they all
[1:24:04] help and support one another and it's
[1:24:05] not just this local body it's the global
[1:24:07] Body of Christ and we see how each one
[1:24:09] of those plays into those things that's
[1:24:11] why we bring in people from the outside
[1:24:13] Ministries from the outside is because
[1:24:14] we don't have it all here we need all of
[1:24:16] those different things so if we're doing
[1:24:18] it alone I'll tell you this you're not
[1:24:20] in position yet you're not in position
[1:24:22] because you got to be joined and knitted
[1:24:25] together and if you're by yourself
[1:24:26] you're not a part of the body you're
[1:24:27] just out there doing it your own but see
[1:24:30] here's the thing unities
[1:24:32] work isn't it it's hard to be United but
[1:24:35] when the people are united Satan's
[1:24:37] defeated that's the thing so that's the
[1:24:39] hard work is to get United to get close
[1:24:41] to the people that are around us watch
[1:24:43] what brother Braham says Jehovah gy says
[1:24:45] watch that pyramid as it shapes up he's
[1:24:47] talking about pyramid of statue of a
[1:24:49] perfect man which is the bride of Christ
[1:24:51] he says watch that pyramid as it shapes
[1:24:53] up in other words as it comes into what
[1:24:55] it's supposed to be the church
[1:24:57] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:24:59] the Holy Ghost he says and then that's
[1:25:01] got to be honed out what the whole
[1:25:03] pyramid has to be honed he says The
[1:25:06] Headstone never did come to the pyramid
[1:25:07] it was rejected just like the
[1:25:09] Cornerstone he's talking about the the
[1:25:11] Great Pyramid in Egypt which doesn't
[1:25:12] have a Capstone it's representing Christ
[1:25:14] being rejected he says now when that
[1:25:16] headstone comes when Christ comes down
[1:25:18] to what take full control of the body of
[1:25:21] Christ the bride he says I've been to
[1:25:23] the pyramid it's just so perfectly fit
[1:25:26] you couldn't run a razor blade between
[1:25:28] it where the mortar's at he says when
[1:25:30] the Christ comes to receive his church
[1:25:33] the church will have a Ministry just
[1:25:35] exactly like that and through that Grace
[1:25:37] will raise the whole thing then go the
[1:25:40] coming of The Headstone crying Grace
[1:25:42] unto the Lord but I want you to realize
[1:25:44] what he says he says until the headstone
[1:25:46] comes down the church has to be
[1:25:49] honed do you know what honing is brother
[1:25:51] Matt knows what honing
[1:25:52] is honing is the final stage of prep for
[1:25:56] a material see what happens is we can go
[1:25:59] in we can go in with a saw and we can
[1:26:00] rough cut it but when you do a saw and
[1:26:02] it's rough cut you got edges that are
[1:26:04] all crinkled up and stuff the edges
[1:26:06] aren't fine then you can go in and you
[1:26:08] can turn it you can machine it you can
[1:26:10] run it on a lathe and you'll get it even
[1:26:11] finer but then at the end when you hone
[1:26:13] it no you may even go to sandpaper next
[1:26:16] but then when you go to honing it's just
[1:26:17] a paste and a light buffing pad and what
[1:26:20] it's doing is it's putting that perfect
[1:26:22] mirror finish on it
[1:26:24] what so we can reflect Christ but that
[1:26:26] honing is what allows you to put things
[1:26:28] together and there isn't even an air gap
[1:26:32] they can do parts so fine now that
[1:26:34] literally there isn't even an air gap in
[1:26:36] there when you pull it out it
[1:26:38] goes it's so tight it's
[1:26:41] airtight because the parts are so
[1:26:43] perfectly fitted together brother Bram
[1:26:45] says when Christ comes down to put his
[1:26:47] full power in the church they have to be
[1:26:49] so perfectly honed and fitted together
[1:26:53] that there's no gaps
[1:26:56] God help us God help us you know what
[1:26:58] that means church is the little lumps
[1:27:01] and bumps and personal preferences and
[1:27:03] opinions they've all got to go because
[1:27:06] I've got to fit up next to you and
[1:27:08] opinions have no place when it comes to
[1:27:10] Unity the word is the only thing and
[1:27:12] that's why the word is a sword it cuts
[1:27:14] and it trims and it does it coming and
[1:27:17] going amen it cuts us to fit we don't
[1:27:21] cut ourselves and we don't cut the word
[1:27:23] to fit ourselves
[1:27:25] amen we want to be right all the time I
[1:27:28] want to be right all the time I strive
[1:27:31] to be right all the time simple fact is
[1:27:33] I'm not and if you haven't figured it
[1:27:35] out yet then just give me a little bit
[1:27:36] of time and I'll prove it okay I'm not
[1:27:39] right all the time but you know what is
[1:27:40] we act like we're right all the time but
[1:27:42] when you look at that word compacted
[1:27:44] joined and knitted together it means
[1:27:46] we've got to consider what everyone else
[1:27:47] is bringing to the table cuz guess what
[1:27:50] other people happen to know more than we
[1:27:51] do in certain things including the word
[1:27:53] of
[1:27:54] god listen brother Mark can correct me
[1:27:58] and I can correct him even though he's
[1:28:00] the Elder that doesn't mean he knows it
[1:28:02] all by no means by no means just cuz I'm
[1:28:06] the pastor doesn't mean somebody can't
[1:28:07] correct me absolutely people come in
[1:28:10] talk to me about things question me on
[1:28:13] it and sometimes I'm wrong and I've had
[1:28:14] to come up in this pulpit and make it
[1:28:16] right and sometimes I don't believe I'm
[1:28:17] wrong and so I don't do that but we've
[1:28:19] got to be able to come up to somebody by
[1:28:21] the word and say here's what I think and
[1:28:23] here's what I want but when it comes to
[1:28:24] a body we'll realize that not everything
[1:28:26] we do has to do with the word you know I
[1:28:29] was in part of a planning committee
[1:28:30] recently in the church and I didn't
[1:28:33] particularly agree with the way that
[1:28:34] everything was kind of going but if you
[1:28:37] remember what I said I said here's my
[1:28:39] vote but it's my vote as a member of the
[1:28:41] committee not as the pastor because when
[1:28:43] the pastor votes then that's it usually
[1:28:46] people just get in line no no no that's
[1:28:47] not what I wanted I said here's my
[1:28:49] opinion but we'll go with whatever the
[1:28:51] group decides why it wasn't a word
[1:28:53] problem it wasn't a word issue and half
[1:28:55] the time the things that's holding up
[1:28:56] Unity is not a word issue it's personal
[1:28:59] preferences and I spent a whole service
[1:29:01] talking about that so I trust I don't
[1:29:02] need to do it again this this afternoon
[1:29:04] but half the time the reason we're not
[1:29:06] at peace with people is because of
[1:29:07] personal preferences and opinions not a
[1:29:09] word issue not a word issue and if we'd
[1:29:12] sit down and focus on what really is the
[1:29:14] problem we'd realize how silly we're
[1:29:15] being we'd realize how silly we're being
[1:29:18] each one of us bring something to the
[1:29:19] body of Christ and Paul's saying don't
[1:29:21] throw that away don't throw that person
[1:29:23] away listen if God can use balam's
[1:29:25] donkey to speak he can use the little
[1:29:27] kid that's next to you amen I've had
[1:29:30] myself I've been corrected by my
[1:29:31] children at times in attitude and
[1:29:33] response absolutely not that they come
[1:29:36] up and say Dad you're wrong but their
[1:29:37] reaction corrects me and I know that I'm
[1:29:40] wrong amen we ought to be able to lay
[1:29:42] our pride down amen let those that are
[1:29:45] gifted let those that are strong in
[1:29:46] certain areas do those things amen but
[1:29:49] what happens is we turn it into
[1:29:50] spiritual issues and we've got a facade
[1:29:52] built up and so we say no I've I've got
[1:29:54] to be able to do that I've got to be
[1:29:55] able to do that and we're holding back
[1:29:56] gifts in the body people that can do it
[1:30:00] but the question then is how do we find
[1:30:01] our lane how do we find our spot we're
[1:30:03] talking about finding your position
[1:30:05] brother John how do I find my position
[1:30:07] in the body of Christ well let me tell
[1:30:09] you one thing where you are now that's
[1:30:11] your
[1:30:13] position fathers you're a father mothers
[1:30:16] you're a mother you don't have to have
[1:30:18] spiritual insight to see that but what
[1:30:19] you do need is a revelation that you're
[1:30:21] not just a father you're a Godly father
[1:30:23] you're a Godly mother and that the
[1:30:25] things that you do and say in there
[1:30:26] matter more than anybody
[1:30:28] else amen we've got to recognize those
[1:30:31] things but if you're going to take on a
[1:30:32] role outside of that if there's a place
[1:30:34] and a position for you outside of that
[1:30:36] in the body how do we figure out what
[1:30:37] that looks like how do you know whether
[1:30:40] you're in it right now or
[1:30:41] not luckily we had a
[1:30:44] prophet question to brother brandham how
[1:30:46] does one know their rightful position in
[1:30:49] the body of
[1:30:51] Christ he says your position in Christ
[1:30:54] is revealed to you by the influence of
[1:30:56] your parents and pastor and the
[1:30:58] occasional visiting
[1:31:03] Minister that's the way it is
[1:31:05] usually but he says it's by the Holy
[1:31:08] Spirit but now listen he can use your
[1:31:10] parents he can use your pastor he can
[1:31:13] use the people around you but you need a
[1:31:16] revelation your parents don't need the
[1:31:18] Revelation and your pastor doesn't need
[1:31:20] the Revelation you need to have a
[1:31:22] revelation of what your role is in the
[1:31:23] the body of Christ otherwise what
[1:31:25] happens is the going gets tough and we
[1:31:28] Wilt why because it was somebody else's
[1:31:30] dream it was somebody else's Vision it
[1:31:31] was somebody else's concern it was
[1:31:33] somebody else's Revelation and so what
[1:31:35] happens is we fall apart he says your
[1:31:38] position in Christ is revealed to you by
[1:31:39] the Holy Spirit number one he says and
[1:31:42] then if you want to know whether it's
[1:31:43] the Holy Spirit or not see that's the
[1:31:45] big question well yes I believe that I'm
[1:31:47] supposed to do this he says then find
[1:31:49] out whether He blesses what you're doing
[1:31:51] or not cuz it's a if it's God inspires
[1:31:54] it then God will vindicate it he says
[1:31:56] and if he blesses it then that's him if
[1:31:58] he doesn't bless like someone said to me
[1:32:01] not long ago said the Lord called me to
[1:32:02] preach I said well then preach
[1:32:05] see brother brother brother Joe brother
[1:32:09] brandom could be rough sometimes he say
[1:32:11] if you're called to preach then preach
[1:32:13] what's stopping
[1:32:14] you he says I really think Satan if he
[1:32:18] can just get somebody to act like that
[1:32:21] and then deceive them that's just what
[1:32:23] he wants to do then the whole world
[1:32:25] points their finger right there somebody
[1:32:27] thinks they have a gift of speaking in
[1:32:28] tongues and interpretation some has a
[1:32:30] gift of Divine Healing some has these
[1:32:31] things he says sometimes they're
[1:32:33] mistaken in those things
[1:32:36] see he says and sometimes they think
[1:32:39] they haven't got it when they have so
[1:32:41] it's very tricky brother John you're not
[1:32:44] helping us at all you're saying it's got
[1:32:45] to be the Holy Spirit he's got to bless
[1:32:46] it but sometimes you think you got it
[1:32:48] and you don't and sometimes you have it
[1:32:49] and you don't and how do I figure it out
[1:32:52] we're going in circles here
[1:32:55] can I use myself as an
[1:32:57] example I'm going to show you the right
[1:32:59] way usually I use my example as the
[1:33:02] wrong way I'm going to give you the
[1:33:04] right
[1:33:05] one I'm a preacher I'm a pastor I
[1:33:09] believe God called me to that but here's
[1:33:11] the thing acting like a preacher and
[1:33:14] acting like a pastor doesn't make me a
[1:33:16] preacher and it doesn't make me a pastor
[1:33:19] that's not it that's not the way it
[1:33:21] works amen this isn't an act it's not a
[1:33:23] show the most serious thing you can do
[1:33:25] in this world is handle the word of
[1:33:27] God and you got to be ordained to do it
[1:33:30] that's not a place to pretend it's not a
[1:33:32] place to act okay and I remember I told
[1:33:34] you I've said this many times when God
[1:33:36] called me to the ministry I said God I
[1:33:37] don't think this is a good
[1:33:39] idea I
[1:33:41] don't I'm okay with it
[1:33:43] now but at the up front I said I don't
[1:33:46] think it's a good
[1:33:47] idea for a number of reasons but I want
[1:33:49] you to remember what Peter said Peter
[1:33:52] said wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:33:55] diligence to make your calling and
[1:33:57] election sure for if you do these things
[1:34:00] you shall never fail now remember never
[1:34:02] fall rather remember what he's talking
[1:34:04] about before that is the statue of a
[1:34:05] perfect man add your faith virtue virtue
[1:34:07] knowledge knowledge Temperance and these
[1:34:08] different things and then he says when
[1:34:10] you've done all of that give diligence
[1:34:13] to make your calling election sure what
[1:34:15] in other words don't presume don't
[1:34:19] assume don't just say it is therefore it
[1:34:21] is no he says make proof of it Paul told
[1:34:25] Timothy make proof of your ministry
[1:34:28] don't just sit there and say I'm called
[1:34:29] to do this Peter said give diligence
[1:34:32] don't assume don't presume remember what
[1:34:35] brother Bram said he said I got the
[1:34:37] dictionary and looked up what the word
[1:34:38] presume actually meant Webster says it
[1:34:40] means to venture without actual
[1:34:42] Authority or to take for granted you can
[1:34:45] take for granted that you've heard from
[1:34:47] the Lord he says to do something before
[1:34:50] you are authorized to do it and without
[1:34:52] the actual author to do it before you're
[1:34:55] supposed to do it so timing matters you
[1:34:57] see that with Moses you see that with
[1:35:01] David see with
[1:35:03] Joseph timing matters he says and
[1:35:06] without the actual authority to do it
[1:35:08] that means leadership matters timing and
[1:35:10] Leadership God's time God's
[1:35:12] season so I took this to
[1:35:15] heart when I got called to the
[1:35:18] ministry I knew that my inclination was
[1:35:21] to rest on my study and my scholarship
[1:35:23] and my intellect and all of these
[1:35:24] different things that's where I knew
[1:35:26] that I was going to have a
[1:35:28] battle because that could allow me to
[1:35:31] act like a
[1:35:32] preacher but that's not what preaching
[1:35:34] is amen so what I did was two things
[1:35:38] when I started preaching I look to see
[1:35:40] does it have an effect on the
[1:35:42] people and that testimony is not from my
[1:35:44] side that has to come from the people I
[1:35:47] can't say I'm a great preacher the
[1:35:49] people have to say he's an effective
[1:35:51] preacher I can't force that I can't sit
[1:35:53] there in my mind and say oh my this is
[1:35:55] wonderful God no no no that's up to the
[1:35:57] people to testify of I couldn't come up
[1:36:00] with that on my own that had to come
[1:36:02] through the people amen and God proved
[1:36:04] himself very quickly there that the word
[1:36:05] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:36:06] intents of the heart amen God has proven
[1:36:10] that and you you yourself have proven
[1:36:12] that in this in me coming here in these
[1:36:15] different things but that's only one
[1:36:17] side of ministry remember the word is a
[1:36:19] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:36:21] the heart the word as it's preached is
[1:36:22] Discerning the need of the people and
[1:36:24] it'll go and it'll meet those things but
[1:36:26] the other thing I looked for was God to
[1:36:28] vindicate himself following my Ministry
[1:36:32] because you have the work over the
[1:36:33] pulpit and then you have the work that
[1:36:34] comes outside of the pulpit if I can put
[1:36:36] it that way because if you look in Mark
[1:36:38] 16 it says these signs shall follow them
[1:36:39] that believe and so what happened was I
[1:36:42] looked at that and I said God I can see
[1:36:45] you vindicating me on the on the
[1:36:46] discernment side but I don't see you
[1:36:48] vindicating me on the signs and wond
[1:36:50] side on the Mark 16
[1:36:52] side and and I I was talking to a good
[1:36:54] friend of mine out west and I said I'm
[1:36:56] just not seeing it I said thee word says
[1:36:58] it but I said I'm not seeing
[1:37:00] it and so what did I do I went to the
[1:37:03] Lord and I said God there's a
[1:37:05] gap there's a gap between what your word
[1:37:07] says and what my Ministry is and then
[1:37:10] after that so I just started praying
[1:37:12] because here's the thing you can't act
[1:37:14] the minute you start acting Satan's got
[1:37:16] you you can't pretend you can't put on a
[1:37:20] facade Satan will Bluff you remember the
[1:37:22] seven sons of CA Paul I know Jesus I
[1:37:24] know who are you and he drove him out
[1:37:27] and stripped him naked ran him down the
[1:37:29] street That's what Satan does the
[1:37:31] pretends Pretenders but what happened
[1:37:35] after that and this was on my heart for
[1:37:36] months and months and months and then I
[1:37:38] went down to Louisiana we went down to
[1:37:40] visit Atlanta this was in uh 2018 I
[1:37:43] guess it was and brother Tim puit
[1:37:45] preached a message called The Calling of
[1:37:47] a
[1:37:47] Ministry and in there he confirmed
[1:37:50] everything that I been praying about and
[1:37:53] he preached about how that healing
[1:37:54] always follows the preaching of the word
[1:37:57] it always does and that's what I've been
[1:37:58] praying about and that's and different
[1:38:00] things and deliverance and these
[1:38:01] different things and so that was so
[1:38:02] Sovereign to me because I go to a
[1:38:04] completely different place where nobody
[1:38:06] knows anything I'm going through and God
[1:38:08] uses that minister to preach a service
[1:38:10] just to me and my wife even commented
[1:38:12] after that she said can you believe that
[1:38:14] he did that she said it was like he was
[1:38:16] just preaching to you the whole
[1:38:19] service and so what was it it was God
[1:38:22] confirming to me yes keep praying for it
[1:38:25] keep looking for it he didn't give it to
[1:38:28] me right there but he said I'm in this
[1:38:32] don't let
[1:38:33] go the word says it you don't have it
[1:38:36] keep looking for it I'm in this I'm in
[1:38:39] this trial I'm in this I'm in this test
[1:38:41] I'm in this time where you're deficient
[1:38:44] and you see it so I kept praying and I
[1:38:46] kept praying I kep kept praying and then
[1:38:48] shortly after that brother Gerald asked
[1:38:49] me to come preach to the services in
[1:38:51] 2018 at Easter now that that was a
[1:38:53] tremendous set of services if you
[1:38:55] remember I remember talking to brother
[1:38:57] Mark about it afterwards and he says
[1:38:59] that's only happened
[1:39:01] twice and what was it it was God
[1:39:04] answering my prayer while answering your
[1:39:07] prayer because it's not about
[1:39:10] me it's about the edification of the
[1:39:13] body it's not about what I want it's
[1:39:17] about what the word says and it's up to
[1:39:19] God then to vindicate those things and
[1:39:22] that was the one of the greatest moments
[1:39:23] of my life in my Ministry to date was
[1:39:26] when that happened because it was God
[1:39:28] answering a prayer in my heart that said
[1:39:31] Lord your word's here and my Ministry is
[1:39:34] here and he just brought me up that next
[1:39:36] step to where I needed to be
[1:39:39] amen church we can sit here all day and
[1:39:41] say we've got an end time rapturing
[1:39:43] message we know the prophet of the age
[1:39:45] we've got an open book but that's not
[1:39:47] what makes us
[1:39:49] anything having it doesn't make us an
[1:39:52] end time believer
[1:39:54] it's having it being
[1:39:56] it receiving it acting on it that's what
[1:40:00] makes us an end time believer and then
[1:40:02] we can't sit here and say I know it all
[1:40:05] how about I live it all how about I live
[1:40:07] it all because that's what Satan loves
[1:40:09] is people that know it all but can't
[1:40:11] live it that's his church that's his
[1:40:14] church is they live they they can talk
[1:40:17] about it but they can't live it but it
[1:40:18] takes the power of the Holy Ghost to
[1:40:20] make this end time message live that's
[1:40:22] for sure knowing it's it's not
[1:40:24] enough brother Bram continues he says so
[1:40:27] always do this Brethren whether you feel
[1:40:28] that you're supposed to do a thing he
[1:40:30] says first find out if it's scriptural
[1:40:33] for you to do it he says if it's in the
[1:40:34] scriptures now catch this don't we love
[1:40:38] this when you open your Bible and you
[1:40:39] read that one one scripture and you say
[1:40:41] that's it he's confirming he says not
[1:40:43] just wrode in one place but I mean
[1:40:46] completely scriptural Through the Bible
[1:40:49] for you to do it your position say if
[1:40:51] you being an evangelist Pastor teach
[1:40:53] your Prophet whatever God might have
[1:40:54] called you to be he says you see or if
[1:40:57] you have the gift of tongues gift of
[1:40:58] interpretation gift of any kind of the
[1:41:00] nine spiritual gifts in the church the
[1:41:02] four spiritual offices of the church any
[1:41:04] position he says first see if God called
[1:41:07] if you're a woman none of those offices
[1:41:10] are
[1:41:12] allowed scripture is clear on it there's
[1:41:14] no women
[1:41:15] priesthood you can't do it so a woman
[1:41:18] that comes up and says I'm called to
[1:41:19] preach I say you're not cuz the
[1:41:22] scripture says no
[1:41:24] and there's no debate about it but he
[1:41:25] says for everything else where it's not
[1:41:27] an absolute you got to make sure that
[1:41:28] you take it from Genesis to
[1:41:30] Revelation take it in all the types take
[1:41:32] it in all the Shadows take it in the
[1:41:34] purity of the New Testament if you will
[1:41:36] but you got to run it from start to
[1:41:37] finish not just pick that one thing that
[1:41:39] support you that's that's itching ears
[1:41:42] that's what that is now having done all
[1:41:45] that he says then usually I watch it for
[1:41:49] myself he says this is me I watch the
[1:41:51] nature of the person
[1:41:53] and see what kind of a gift they're
[1:41:55] professing he says see God will work
[1:41:57] with his creature the way he's made him
[1:42:00] so in other words you can't have a job
[1:42:01] that your nature doesn't support he says
[1:42:04] it he says see if you see him real
[1:42:06] flighty going on he says the Lord called
[1:42:08] me to be a pastor he says now a pastor
[1:42:10] can't be a flighty person a pastor's
[1:42:12] solid sound see God called me to be a
[1:42:15] teacher then watch him how he interprets
[1:42:17] the word see he gets it all mixed up and
[1:42:19] everything then you can tell see then
[1:42:21] the thing to do your position position
[1:42:23] is usually known whether you can do it
[1:42:25] or not in other words he says the proof
[1:42:27] is in the pudding if you feel called to
[1:42:29] do it and when you do it it doesn't work
[1:42:31] you're not called to do it now that
[1:42:34] doesn't mean there isn't growth how many
[1:42:36] remembers the first time a preacher
[1:42:39] preaches it's usually a little bit
[1:42:42] painful cuz they're nervous they're just
[1:42:45] trying to get through
[1:42:46] it and they may say great things they
[1:42:48] may be anointed but they're just trying
[1:42:50] to settle themselves down and so usually
[1:42:53] painful you say well that was no good
[1:42:55] you got to give them a bit of
[1:42:57] time not everyone that steps into a role
[1:42:59] is going to get it right just from the
[1:43:00] get-go that's not the way it works we're
[1:43:02] still human we still got to grow we
[1:43:03] still got to mature we still got to
[1:43:05] develop character in these things what's
[1:43:07] he saying a pastor can't be flighty if
[1:43:09] you move into pastorship and the church
[1:43:11] falls apart people are leaving people
[1:43:13] aren't getting fed nothing's happening
[1:43:14] guess what you're not called the pastor
[1:43:16] the proof is in the pudding he says if
[1:43:18] you can you
[1:43:21] will now listen to him this is his
[1:43:23] personal testimony now he says now when
[1:43:25] God called me to be an evangelist I
[1:43:28] wanted to be a pastor so your desire has
[1:43:31] nothing to do with it prophet of God
[1:43:34] wanted to be a pastor he started that
[1:43:35] little church if you remember he says
[1:43:37] and I thought staying at home here would
[1:43:38] be just fine but the Lord called me and
[1:43:40] finally all the people got together says
[1:43:42] there's not a one of them left in here
[1:43:44] tonight that they cried and went out
[1:43:45] there on 1717 Spring Street and the lady
[1:43:48] Mrs Hawkins over here met me and said
[1:43:50] I'll allowance my children at the table
[1:43:52] if you'll only build a Tabernacle see
[1:43:54] and my calling was an evangelist he said
[1:43:56] the woman was saying I'll limit how much
[1:43:58] food I buy for my household to help Fe
[1:44:01] build a church if you'll stay and Pastor
[1:44:03] us how tempting is it when the people
[1:44:06] say that I'll give anything if you'll
[1:44:10] stay desire is not what it is it's got
[1:44:13] to be leadership he says laying right
[1:44:16] here at this Cornerstone if we could
[1:44:18] burst in there tonight you'll see a fly
[1:44:20] leaf off of my Bible where he told me to
[1:44:22] be an IST see he says I wasn't a
[1:44:26] successful
[1:44:27] Pastor prophet of God I wasn't a
[1:44:30] successful Pastor never would be because
[1:44:33] I haven't got the patience and what it
[1:44:35] takes to be a
[1:44:39] pastor the prophet of God greatest
[1:44:43] preacher since Christ and
[1:44:46] Paul Paul you have to go to the original
[1:44:48] I think but certainly the greatest
[1:44:50] modern preacher the greatest modern
[1:44:51] Ministry we've had likened unto
[1:44:54] Paul and he says I can't be a pastor I
[1:44:57] would never make a good pastor I don't
[1:44:59] have the patience I don't have what it
[1:45:01] takes see we put him on a
[1:45:04] pedestal his pedestal is profit it's not
[1:45:07] all in all it's not everything that's
[1:45:10] Christ's pedestal am man he's a man he's
[1:45:13] called to one thing that was to be a
[1:45:14] prophet and go out with signs and
[1:45:16] wonders and restore the hearts of the
[1:45:17] children back to the faith of the
[1:45:19] original Pentecostal fathers by what the
[1:45:21] opening of the word
[1:45:23] that was his role not the pastor he says
[1:45:26] I never would be a good pastor he says I
[1:45:29] wasn't a successful
[1:45:31] Pastor he says so therefore if I tried
[1:45:34] to Pastor I would be just as far out as
[1:45:36] a pastor is trying to be an evangelist
[1:45:38] see what I mean you can see the way Lord
[1:45:40] calls you and what your position is in
[1:45:42] the body your Nature has to match up
[1:45:44] with
[1:45:44] it that's in questions and answers and
[1:45:47] now he moves forward and we're almost
[1:45:48] done here this morning he says when
[1:45:50] you're born again God vindicates you he
[1:45:53] says that's how God vindicates all of
[1:45:54] his nature what by their fruits and
[1:45:58] that's the way he vindicates his
[1:45:59] ministry all of his servants are
[1:46:02] Vindicated the same way he vindicates
[1:46:04] nature how do you know it's a peach tree
[1:46:07] because it brings peaches how do you
[1:46:09] know it's an apple tree it's bearing
[1:46:10] apples how do you know it's a Christian
[1:46:12] Christian signs bear from it Christian
[1:46:15] Life comes out of it what is it he
[1:46:17] confirms it he vindicates it by his
[1:46:19] anointing and the anointing is always
[1:46:21] life it's always life life it always
[1:46:24] brings fruit it doesn't bring death and
[1:46:27] it doesn't stay Barren remember he told
[1:46:29] the disciples that what you would have
[1:46:31] life and life more abundantly that your
[1:46:33] fruit would
[1:46:34] remain amen not just a flash in the pan
[1:46:39] but what it's a sustaining work it's a
[1:46:41] life work it's a continuing
[1:46:44] thing he he explains it he says how do
[1:46:47] you know he's a teacher the word comes
[1:46:49] from him he says in other words if
[1:46:51] you're a teacher you'll teach teach
[1:46:53] effectively and people will learn under
[1:46:55] your teaching if you learn and people go
[1:46:57] out if you teach and people go out more
[1:46:59] confused than they came in you're not a
[1:47:01] teacher here's the thing you know what
[1:47:04] they say the gift of teaching is to take
[1:47:06] complex things and make them
[1:47:08] simple and you know what we found so
[1:47:10] often is we have people that come in and
[1:47:12] they take simple things and they make
[1:47:13] them complex that is not
[1:47:16] teaching no that's head knowledge and
[1:47:19] usually you've missed out on something
[1:47:21] he says how do you know he's a
[1:47:23] the word comes through him Bears record
[1:47:26] Vindication it proves himself he says
[1:47:29] how does it become that how do you
[1:47:31] become one of those people he says when
[1:47:33] it dies and becomes one he says that's
[1:47:36] right when we die and become a new
[1:47:37] creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with
[1:47:41] our calling we stay with our calling the
[1:47:45] fruits of the spirit follow us when we
[1:47:46] are his servants when we are born again
[1:47:49] the fruits of Christ's life follows up
[1:47:52] notice that he says there when we get
[1:47:54] our calling we stay with our calling we
[1:47:56] aren't jumping around from pillar to pul
[1:47:58] this one to that one this church to that
[1:47:59] church this ministry to that Ministry
[1:48:01] try this try that listen we may try a
[1:48:03] few things before we figure out what
[1:48:04] sticks but if we can set back a little
[1:48:07] bit and say Lord what's your will we
[1:48:10] seek seek first see what happens is we
[1:48:13] try and then we fail we try and we fail
[1:48:14] we try and we fail and eventually we get
[1:48:16] there but if we can seek first and be
[1:48:20] led that takes a whole lot of the pain
[1:48:22] out of it a whole lot of the friction
[1:48:24] out of it cuz what's happening is the
[1:48:26] person that's meant to be there can't be
[1:48:27] there because you're trying to be
[1:48:29] it right but if we can just say Lord
[1:48:32] what's my place and hold back now don't
[1:48:34] let that turn us into lumps on the on
[1:48:36] the couch amen let's prayerfully seek
[1:48:39] and then having prayer check it with the
[1:48:41] word and if the word says it then go and
[1:48:42] do it and if the Lord blesses it then
[1:48:44] you found his will it's very simple
[1:48:48] amen I sure you've met people like this
[1:48:51] and no matter where they go they do one
[1:48:53] thing and they do it well and there's a
[1:48:56] brother I'm thinking of right now that
[1:48:57] does it and no matter where he goes he
[1:48:59] can't help it that's what he does and he
[1:49:01] doesn't force himself into it he just
[1:49:04] slides right into it what happens is
[1:49:06] he'll
[1:49:07] volunteer or usually what happens by now
[1:49:09] is he's got a reputation and somebody
[1:49:10] says brother so and so would you do this
[1:49:12] for us and he steps in and it is amazing
[1:49:15] why because that's his gift that's his
[1:49:17] calling and he's wonderful in it and
[1:49:19] everywhere he's been he's been able to
[1:49:21] use that gift in a particular way
[1:49:24] why would I try and force myself in on
[1:49:26] something like that there's already
[1:49:27] somebody
[1:49:28] there Lord I don't want brother Matt's
[1:49:31] job I want brother Matt to have brother
[1:49:32] Matt's job and I want me to have my job
[1:49:34] amen stay in our lane stay in our
[1:49:36] position recognize gifts sometimes
[1:49:39] that's the other thing is pride raises
[1:49:40] up and we don't want to recognize that
[1:49:42] somebody has something we don't maybe we
[1:49:44] look down on them a little bit and then
[1:49:45] they're going to take a position that
[1:49:46] has Authority or respect or
[1:49:50] influence no no we're all one in Christ
[1:49:54] there's no there's no big eyes here
[1:49:57] amen we're all sheep we all need a
[1:50:00] Shepherd amen we all need the Holy Ghost
[1:50:04] amen we all need personal leadership we
[1:50:05] all need
[1:50:08] sovereignty usually Pride's the only
[1:50:10] reason we try and take over somebody
[1:50:12] else's
[1:50:14] job I think I can do it better therefore
[1:50:17] I will listen if you can do it better
[1:50:20] God will place you but as long as you
[1:50:22] keep thinking it's about you God will
[1:50:24] never place you can't do
[1:50:26] it listen to
[1:50:28] this it's unscriptural for you or I to
[1:50:31] impersonate anyone else impersonate act
[1:50:35] like somebody else act like somebody
[1:50:37] you're
[1:50:38] not he says right so be what you are and
[1:50:43] be a good one listen there's only one
[1:50:45] person can be you and that's you and he
[1:50:46] says be a good you he says be what you
[1:50:48] are be a good one and fulfill your
[1:50:50] purpose so others can see you if you're
[1:50:53] a housewife be a real one see if you're
[1:50:55] a husband be a genuine see if you're a
[1:50:57] deacon be a genuine or a preacher
[1:50:59] whatever you are but don't try to take
[1:51:01] somebody else's place and then when the
[1:51:03] word calls you down on this he's saying
[1:51:07] I'm saying this now if you feel this he
[1:51:09] says if you do feel rebuked then repent
[1:51:12] that's all is get right that's the only
[1:51:14] thing to
[1:51:15] do sometimes we're trying to be
[1:51:18] something we're
[1:51:19] not he says don't do that he says and if
[1:51:22] your heart's pricked right now he says
[1:51:23] repent of it and stop being that way but
[1:51:27] I love what he says here he addresses
[1:51:28] you sisters it's Mother's Day let's talk
[1:51:30] to the sisters for a moment he says and
[1:51:32] don't try he says if you're going to be
[1:51:35] a housewife be a real one be the real
[1:51:38] you housewife don't try and be somebody
[1:51:41] else's housewife be your housewife you
[1:51:43] are sovereign in your own home under the
[1:51:45] headship of your husband under the word
[1:51:48] so what that means is sister Amber
[1:51:50] should not try and be the housewife that
[1:51:52] sister Blanc is Sister Blanca should not
[1:51:54] be the housewife that sister Nikki is
[1:51:56] Sister Nikki should not try and be the
[1:51:57] one that sister Kimberly is Sister
[1:51:59] Kimberly shouldn't be the one that
[1:52:00] sister relle is Sister relle shouldn't
[1:52:03] be the one that sister Leah is who
[1:52:04] shouldn't be the one that sister Brenda
[1:52:06] is who shouldn't be the one that sister
[1:52:07] Moren is each one of you is different
[1:52:10] and God has provided you with the Home
[1:52:11] Sister Priscilla I skipped over
[1:52:17] you you shouldn't try and be something
[1:52:20] you're not be the one God made you to be
[1:52:23] listen sister Amber makes amazing
[1:52:25] sourdough
[1:52:28] pizzas okay but you know what happens is
[1:52:32] you have your party for your boy and if
[1:52:34] you don't make the same sour or pizzas
[1:52:36] we think you order Little Caesars God
[1:52:38] forbid well I'm not the same I'm not I'm
[1:52:41] not a good of a a wife or mother or
[1:52:42] sister
[1:52:43] Amber doesn't have anything to do with
[1:52:46] anything amen comparisons get us nowhere
[1:52:49] we are sovereign to our own households
[1:52:52] and God has built us God has made us
[1:52:54] uniquely and specifically by his own
[1:52:57] hand to be where we are doing what we're
[1:53:00] doing and if you do it just be good at
[1:53:03] it according to what he's placed in you
[1:53:06] listen not all of us are going to have
[1:53:09] sparkling houses all the time not of us
[1:53:12] all of us are going to have three or
[1:53:13] four course meals every
[1:53:17] meal okay that's not it be who you are
[1:53:23] in the place that God has placed you and
[1:53:25] don't look around don't look around who
[1:53:29] cares if your husband is unsatisfied
[1:53:32] he'll let you know on a very brave
[1:53:36] day you answer to your husband you don't
[1:53:39] answer to the ministry you don't answer
[1:53:41] to other men you definitely don't answer
[1:53:42] to other
[1:53:43] women women God has made you sisters God
[1:53:46] has made you wonderfully for your family
[1:53:52] be a good one for your
[1:53:56] family God's provided let's not slap him
[1:53:59] in the face by trying to be another one
[1:54:02] amen brothers be yourselves you know
[1:54:06] what I don't need two brother Joe's for
[1:54:07] deacons I need a brother Joe and I need
[1:54:10] a brother Matt you know why because they
[1:54:12] are alike in certain ways and they are
[1:54:14] completely opposite in both in other
[1:54:16] ways and they bring balance and they
[1:54:18] bring contrast and they bring experience
[1:54:20] and they bring Insight different to each
[1:54:22] other and it brings a balance to
[1:54:25] decisions
[1:54:26] Amen brother mat can be real tempting to
[1:54:28] want to be like brother Joe sometimes
[1:54:31] and brother Jo can be real tempting to
[1:54:32] want to be like brother Matt when things
[1:54:34] go wrong but no we need both of them to
[1:54:37] be as they are under the leading of the
[1:54:40] Holy Ghost so that we have balance in
[1:54:43] this
[1:54:46] church yes we can grow yes we can mature
[1:54:50] listen if you're immature don't say God
[1:54:52] May
[1:54:53] immature that's not what we're talking
[1:54:55] about but we're saying your
[1:54:57] nature your nature the way you're built
[1:55:00] the way you look at things in these
[1:55:01] different things God can grow us but
[1:55:03] these differences bring balance brother
[1:55:05] B puts it this way he says Be
[1:55:07] Yourself act
[1:55:10] normal but what does normal mean he says
[1:55:13] natural people think more of you see
[1:55:16] sometimes our natural is actually a
[1:55:18] little bit weird it's a little bit
[1:55:20] different we're not supposed to to try
[1:55:22] and hide
[1:55:23] that that's the beauty of the garden is
[1:55:26] the thing that stands out and there's a
[1:55:28] place for the natural weirdness that we
[1:55:30] have as
[1:55:30] well it's not that we all have to be a
[1:55:33] certain way God does not have a cookie
[1:55:35] cutter up there just stamping out
[1:55:37] Believers we all have one thing the seed
[1:55:40] of God in us everything else is
[1:55:41] different from person to person to
[1:55:44] person amen don't conform to people's
[1:55:48] expectations that is the that is the
[1:55:50] epitome of Rel
[1:55:54] and that's where Satan
[1:55:56] rules he says don't try to act like
[1:55:59] somebody else you're
[1:56:02] not don't
[1:56:04] mimic Paul says follow me as I follow
[1:56:07] Christ I mean you're looking to the word
[1:56:09] not to be like Paul he says just be
[1:56:11] yourself he says but all that put on
[1:56:14] Pharisee acting like somebody else when
[1:56:15] you're not I don't like he says you
[1:56:17] never know how to take a fellow like
[1:56:19] that you don't know where you're
[1:56:21] standing with him
[1:56:22] see if they will say one thing to one
[1:56:24] person and they'll do it with another
[1:56:25] person a different way or they'll act
[1:56:27] one way around this person but different
[1:56:29] around that person you know what the
[1:56:30] problem is they're double-minded they're
[1:56:33] acting be yourself let your yay be yay
[1:56:36] your Nay be Nay it's okay to not like
[1:56:39] things that people like and it's okay to
[1:56:40] like things that people don't
[1:56:42] like be yourself he says he says you
[1:56:46] don't know where you're standing with
[1:56:47] that man he says he doesn't know where
[1:56:49] he's standing himself cuz he's something
[1:56:52] one in his heart and something else in
[1:56:54] his else in his mouth so he's an actor
[1:56:56] remember what Jesus said these are the
[1:56:57] people that he says they draw not to me
[1:56:59] with their mouth but their hearts far
[1:57:00] from me you can't be one thing here and
[1:57:02] one thing here different thing here out
[1:57:05] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:57:06] speaks so he's saying if you're speaking
[1:57:07] two things your heart is confused you
[1:57:09] haven't settled
[1:57:11] something he said there's something else
[1:57:13] in his mouth so he's an actor he says I
[1:57:14] just don't like it it just seems to be
[1:57:16] too much of something that's not right
[1:57:18] putting on last
[1:57:21] quote he says oh my deliver me from
[1:57:24] being an
[1:57:26] actor amen he says be what you are God
[1:57:30] will bless you he says you even see
[1:57:33] sometimes ministers will do that they
[1:57:34] get in the pulpit and make their voice
[1:57:36] very big or
[1:57:38] deep God bless you this
[1:57:42] morning come
[1:57:44] on put on a
[1:57:46] show no no no he says they'll get in the
[1:57:49] pulpit and make their voice very big I
[1:57:51] have now receive my degree like it run
[1:57:54] Shivers over you he says I feel sorry
[1:57:56] for them people don't appreciate that
[1:57:59] just be yourself people will appreciate
[1:58:01] you more it'll do you good you won't put
[1:58:05] on what's he saying God made you the way
[1:58:07] you are be that and God can bless it
[1:58:10] amen you know how God blesses it he
[1:58:12] anoints it he anoints it in all of our
[1:58:17] little
[1:58:18] quirks and differences yet he anoints us
[1:58:21] amen let's stand together if we would he
[1:58:24] says be what you are God will bless you
[1:58:28] you know I look through this church and
[1:58:30] we've got coffees we've got cetes we've
[1:58:33] got grants we've got more coffees we've
[1:58:35] got columbos we've got lushes we've got
[1:58:37] Shaws we've got Walsh leggers we've got
[1:58:39] more coffees we've got collinses we' got
[1:58:41] more coffees
[1:58:43] again right and not a one of us is alike
[1:58:49] even amongst the coffee Clan not a one
[1:58:51] of the alike and I say praise the Lord
[1:58:54] praise the Lord that we have contrast
[1:58:58] that we have different backgrounds that
[1:58:59] we can bring different experiences to
[1:59:01] this church because our strength is in
[1:59:03] being different remember what Paul says
[1:59:05] can the you know and I don't know which
[1:59:06] ones he use you know can the eyes say to
[1:59:08] the to the mouth because I'm not a mouth
[1:59:10] I'm not a part of the body see we look
[1:59:13] at the things that are different say
[1:59:14] well I can't be a part of this
[1:59:15] body no no no that's not what it's about
[1:59:18] at all if we're all the same we're a
[1:59:19] freak
[1:59:22] right we have to be different even
[1:59:25] amongst our fingers you say I've got 10
[1:59:27] fingers but not one of them is the same
[1:59:28] the index finger on both sides is
[1:59:30] different even every one of us is a has
[1:59:32] a difference and we bring it amen we
[1:59:34] bring something unique and special to
[1:59:36] this body and that's what we're supposed
[1:59:37] to be looking at is what God has
[1:59:39] anointed what God has blessed don't kick
[1:59:42] it out let God be God in these things
[1:59:45] and you know what the thing that
[1:59:46] challenged for us to do is to focus on
[1:59:48] the thing that God has blessed in our
[1:59:50] lives rather than the thing that God
[1:59:51] hasn't in put
[1:59:53] there see the human nature is to look at
[1:59:55] what the brother or sister doesn't have
[1:59:57] the god nature is to look at the Christ
[1:59:59] in that person and you know how we get
[2:00:02] that joining and knitting
[2:00:05] together amen we sit here under the
[2:00:09] preaching of the word this is not where
[2:00:10] the great joining happens We Gather here
[2:00:12] under one name the name of Jesus Christ
[2:00:14] under one Banner his word and we have
[2:00:17] Fellowship here one with another but the
[2:00:19] joining and knitting doesn't happen in
[2:00:21] here it happens out there amen when we
[2:00:24] spend time together when we do things
[2:00:27] together when we do things for each
[2:00:28] other when our sisters have babies and
[2:00:30] we bring meals over when somebody moves
[2:00:31] in and we help them find their stuff and
[2:00:33] we help them find a place and maybe we
[2:00:35] put them up for a while when somebody
[2:00:37] gets hurt when somebody loses a
[2:00:39] job when somebody needs help because the
[2:00:41] snowstorms are too big whatever it may
[2:00:43] be that's where the joining and the
[2:00:45] knitting comes is the real
[2:00:47] life in here we're all holy we're all
[2:00:50] perfect out there is where we prove it
[2:00:52] amen that's where those things happen
[2:00:54] amen we focus we ought to focus on the
[2:00:56] blessing that each one of our brothers
[2:00:57] and sisters is not the deficiencies cuz
[2:01:00] in the body you're there for your
[2:01:01] strengths not for your weaknesses amen
[2:01:03] what God has blessed amen you know what
[2:01:07] I've noticed we have a lot more grace
[2:01:09] for each other when we spend time
[2:01:12] together because you know what happens
[2:01:13] is when you step away from fellowship or
[2:01:15] they step away from you as the case may
[2:01:17] be then what happens is Satan's got all
[2:01:19] sorts of imaginations that he can work
[2:01:21] with see see I always knew that about
[2:01:22] that brother I always knew that about
[2:01:25] that sister see it's it's coming to it's
[2:01:27] coming ex no no no that's Satan driving
[2:01:30] in a wedge amen where's the
[2:01:33] intercessor and you know what the best
[2:01:35] thing we need to do sometimes get back
[2:01:38] in Fellowship you start thinking about
[2:01:40] someone the wrong way you start painting
[2:01:42] pictures in your mind you start having
[2:01:44] conversations with that person in your
[2:01:45] head you know what you need to do have
[2:01:47] them over have fellowship with them amen
[2:01:50] get knitted and joined together because
[2:01:52] something's pulled you apart when I hurt
[2:01:55] my shoulder you know what hurt you know
[2:01:56] what caused it to pull apart an
[2:01:59] impact what is it somebody says
[2:02:01] something somebody does something
[2:02:03] somebody doesn't say something somebody
[2:02:04] doesn't do something and what does it do
[2:02:06] it causes a tear it causes a stretching
[2:02:09] and all of a sudden things get loose and
[2:02:10] it starts to move around it doesn't work
[2:02:11] the way it's supposed to how do you get
[2:02:13] it you start working together with it
[2:02:15] again that's how I'm building my
[2:02:16] shoulder back together I'm working it in
[2:02:18] with the rest of the body sometimes the
[2:02:21] first thing we need to do
[2:02:22] one go to God in prayer and say God take
[2:02:24] away that
[2:02:25] attitude don't don't say Lord fix the
[2:02:27] brother say Lord fix me my attitude is
[2:02:30] the one I've got to live with and then
[2:02:32] say Lord help me to draw them in help me
[2:02:35] make them a part of my life in a way
[2:02:37] that Satan has no wedges that he can
[2:02:38] throw in between me and them that's how
[2:02:40] we get knitted and joined together amen
[2:02:43] what did Jesus say by this shall all men
[2:02:45] know that you are my disciples by your
[2:02:48] love one for another amen
[2:02:53] by your love one for another God bless
[2:02:56] you let's bow our
[2:02:57] heads Heavenly
[2:03:00] Father Lord I believe if there's one
[2:03:02] thing the church wants Lord is that you
[2:03:05] would flow through US Lord that you
[2:03:07] would use us Lord that your Holy Spirit
[2:03:09] would have free reign in our lives Lord
[2:03:12] that we would bring souls to your
[2:03:13] kingdom Lord that we would surrender our
[2:03:15] lives so that you can have Lord your
[2:03:17] preeminence Lord so that you can fulfill
[2:03:19] your very promises through each and
[2:03:21] every one of us but Lord we know that
[2:03:24] comes by working with each other Lord
[2:03:26] Under The Authority Under the headship
[2:03:27] of you of the Holy Spirit Lord and by
[2:03:30] the the the truth of the word in our
[2:03:32] lives Lord
[2:03:33] God lord so many of these things are so
[2:03:37] simple Lord we're looking for victory
[2:03:39] and you give us such Simplicity and you
[2:03:41] say will you do it Lord I pray where
[2:03:43] there's anything Lord
[2:03:45] broken Lord where joints have come apart
[2:03:49] Lord where attitudes and ideas and
[2:03:51] imaginations have raised up Lord I pray
[2:03:53] you kill it even in this service this
[2:03:55] morning Lord let me esteem my brothers
