[16:16] Let's uh sing the chorus 992. It's not
[16:20] in trusting. Not in trying, but in
[16:22] trusting. I'm going to sing that this
[16:24] morning. And uh and ask brother Garfield
[16:27] to come and open in prayer this morning.
[16:30] And remember to pray for brother John as
[16:33] he brings us the word of the Lord. And
[16:35] also remember of course those we pray
[16:38] for brother Dale uh sister Kim's mother
[16:41] I just continue to pray for her and we
[16:46] had and brother Merl of course sister
[16:48] Priscilla's dad as he recovers from his
[16:50] surgery and
[16:53] the request we had from brother Joe for
[16:55] his coworker's mother-in-law who was
[16:59] fainting passing out and they were
[17:01] trying to figure out what was causing
[17:03] that. So, we just ask for grace in that
[17:05] situation. Remember, uh, Sister Beverly
[17:08] has got, uh, Beverly Gail, she sent me a
[17:11] note last night. She's got surgery
[17:14] happening on Wednesday, and, uh,
[17:18] she's asked for prayer for that. So,
[17:20] we're going to remember her. She didn't
[17:22] say what it was for, but, she asked for
[17:25] prayer. So, remember her and also her
[17:27] grandson, Jack, who was uh, suffering
[17:30] with high fever at this point. So
[17:33] remember them and brother Doug as well.
[17:35] Uh the uh and brother David has a
[17:38] relative uh who has
[17:42] who's got problems especially with
[17:44] liver. So u we just want to remember her
[17:46] name is Betty regular. So we want to
[17:49] remember her before the Lord for the
[17:50] salvation of her soul for a touch of
[17:52] healing in her body by grace. Also
[17:55] remember those not here. Brother Chad,
[17:56] Sister Leah, and the family and of
[18:00] course, Brother Kingsley [music]
[18:02] and Sister Melody and that and we'll
[18:04] remember them uh also. And I think
[18:07] brother Gerald is back in town, so
[18:10] he'll most likely be here. So, let's
[18:12] pray one for another and uh Brother
[18:17] Garfield lead us in prayer.

[33:19] No matter [singing]
[33:20] what I face
[33:22] through every season change,
[33:27] Jesus [singing] you remain.
[33:30] [music] You will be my joy in [singing]
[33:34] the trials of the [music] day, in the
[33:38] testing of [singing] my faith.
[33:42] Jesus, [music] you remain.
[33:48] You have not abandoned [singing]
[33:50] me. [music]
[33:52] Drawing closer as I seek
[33:56] to know [singing] you better.
[34:03] This is where [singing] my joy is found.
[34:07] The only solid ground
[34:11] is in [singing] you, Jesus. [music]
[34:19] No matter [music and singing]
[34:20] what I face,
[34:22] through every season's change, [music]
[34:26] Jesus, [singing] you remain,
[34:30] you will be my [music] joy. In [singing]
[34:33] the trials of the day,
[34:37] in the testing of [music] my faith,
[34:41] Jesus, [singing] you remain.
[34:46] For you are making [music and singing]
[34:50] all things new.
[34:52] And even as you do, I [music] consider
[34:56] [singing] it joy
[34:59] just to trust you. And I [singing]
[35:03] know the testing [music] of my faith
[35:07] produces
[35:08] inner strength. I [music] consider it
[35:12] joy. [singing]
[35:14] Just trust you. For you are making all
[35:20] things [singing] new. And even [music]
[35:23] as you do, I consider it joy
[35:29] just [singing] to trust you. [music] And
[35:32] I know the testing of my faith produces
[35:37] [singing]
[35:38] inner strength. [music]
[35:40] I consider it joy
[35:44] just to trust [singing]
[35:46] you.
[35:56] Amen. Enjoy that nice happy song.
[36:01] Amen. [clears throat]
[36:02] This is the joy of the Lord is our
[36:04] strength, right?
[36:06] Amen. Let's uh why don't we stand
[36:10] and let's sing 1083.
[36:15] Nothing can wash my sins away.
[36:19] Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Aren't
[36:21] you glad for that blood? Amen.
[36:25] Praise the Lord. [clears throat]
[36:30] Nothing can wash my sins [singing]
[36:34] away.
[36:36] Nothing [music]
[36:37] can wash my sins
[36:41] away. [singing]
[36:43] Nothing can wash [music] my sins away.
[36:51] [music] Nothing.
[36:57] Amen.
[36:58] Nothing [music] but the blood of Jesus.
[37:03] Nothing can lead [music] me to your
[37:08] throne.
[37:10] Nothing can lead [music] me to your
[37:14] throne.
[37:16] Nothing can lead me [music] to your
[37:21] throne. [singing]
[37:25] Nothing. [music]
[37:26] Hallelujah.
[37:28] Nothing.
[37:31] Nothing [music and singing] but the
[37:33] blood of Jesus.
[37:36] And nothing can bring me peace
[37:39] [music and singing]
[37:40] with God.
[37:43] Nothing can bring me peace [music]
[37:47] with God.
[37:49] Nothing can bring me peace.
[37:52] [music and singing]
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:57] [music]
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Praise the Lord. Nothing.
[38:04] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[38:07] [music and singing]
[38:08] And nothing can make your people [music]
[38:13] want. Amen. Nothing can make your people
[38:19] [singing] one.
[38:21] [music] Nothing can make your [singing]
[38:25] people
[38:26] want.
[38:30] Nothing. Hallelujah. [music] Nothing.
[38:36] Nothing but the blood [singing] of
[38:39] Jesus. [music]
[38:41] And nothing can wash [singing] my sins.
[38:45] away.
[38:47] Nothing can wash [music] my sins away.
[38:52] [singing]
[38:54] Nothing can wash [music]
[38:56] my sins away.
[39:01] [music]
[39:02] Nothing.
[39:04] Oh, nothing. [music and singing]
[39:06] Praise the Lord. Nothing but the blood
[39:11] of Jesus. [music and singing]
[39:13] Nothing can lead me.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing can lead [music]
[39:22] me to your
[39:26] Nothing [music] can lead me to your
[39:30] throne. [singing]
[39:34] Nothing. [music]
[39:37] Nothing.
[39:40] Nothing but the blood [music]
[39:42] of Jesus. [singing]
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:49] Lord, we can only approach through your
[39:51] blood,
[39:52] Lord. It's [music] what cleans it, what
[39:54] cleanses,
[39:56] Lord. It's what divorces us from our
[39:58] sin,
[39:59] Lord. And we approach through that blood
[40:01] this morning, Lord. We claim nothing of
[40:02] ourselves, Lord, but we're claiming your
[40:05] blood, Lord. We're claiming the price
[40:07] that was paid for our sins, Lord. We're
[40:09] claiming the price that was paid for our
[40:11] healing, Lord. We're claiming the price
[40:13] [music] that was paid for our
[40:14] resurrection and rapture, Lord. We're
[40:16] standing under that blood this morning,
[40:18] Lord. And we're accepted in your sight
[40:20] because we've accepted that blood,
[40:21] [music] heavenly father. We plead it
[40:23] every day, Lord. Your believe your
[40:26] prophet said, "Never get too far away
[40:27] from Calvary, [music] Lord. And we're
[40:29] resting in that finished work, Lord. But
[40:31] we're resting, Lord, not just in what
[40:32] was done there, Lord, but what followed
[40:34] afterwards, Lord. That there was a
[40:36] resurrection, Lord. There was a a
[40:38] raising from the dead, Lord. There was a
[40:40] walking in newness of life that followed
[40:41] it. Heavenly Father, Lord, and that's
[40:43] our claim this morning is that through
[40:45] the blood, we can walk in newness of
[40:47] life. Lord, thank you for the promise,
[40:49] [music] Lord. Thank you for our freedom.
[40:51] Thank you for our healing. Thank you for
[40:52] our deliverance, Lord. Thank you for our
[40:54] provision. Thank you for our leadership
[40:56] that we have, Lord, by your grace at
[40:58] Calvary. And Lord, we're here to claim
[41:00] it tonight. Lord, we're here to claim it
[41:02] today, Lord, to just be in your
[41:04] presence, Lord, and be washed by that
[41:05] blood, Lord. be washed by your word,
[41:08] Lord, that we could draw closer to you
[41:09] once again this morning, Lord.
[41:11] Strengthen and encourage us, Lord, this
[41:13] morning for service. We pray [music] in
[41:14] Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray it.
[41:17] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[41:19] would to Matthew chapter 16.
[41:22] Matthew chapter 16. I've got a quite a
[41:24] few announcements this morning.
[41:26] Certainly appreciate that special,
[41:27] Sister Selena. A joy to trust you. Amen.
[41:30] That certainly feeds into our thought
[41:31] this morning. We'll see as we get into
[41:33] it. Want to remind you that we are
[41:35] taking up the offering for Jamaica.
[41:37] Quite a few of you have g given already.
[41:39] Lord bless you for that. But we're going
[41:41] to close that out very shortly so that
[41:42] we can send this over to them. They're
[41:44] very much in need of it. So if you were
[41:46] thinking about giving, you haven't
[41:47] given, then by all means send that over
[41:49] to brother Mark through the church
[41:51] account and uh we'll forward that
[41:53] through brother Garfield to get to
[41:55] brother Keith Reed down in Jamaica
[41:56] hopefully in the coming week. So just to
[41:58] remind you of that, there's no pressure.
[42:00] Give as you can and uh we'll trust the
[42:02] Lord to to magnify and make a blessing.
[42:05] Amen. Remember, we've got special
[42:06] meetings coming this week, so no service
[42:08] on Wednesday, but we will have service
[42:10] on Friday at 7, Saturday at 5:30
[42:15] and Sunday at 900 a.m. Brother Billy has
[42:18] to leave at 1:30 p.m. So, he's basically
[42:20] going to preach, change his clothes, and
[42:22] fly out. So, we have a very early
[42:24] service on Sunday morning. Uh I think
[42:27] brother Matt said it's basically like
[42:28] going to work on Sunday morning. and we
[42:30] should all be able to make it for a 9:00
[42:31] a.m. service. So, we'll keep those in
[42:33] prayer. Uh I've talked with brother
[42:35] Aaron Oglesby this week. We're looking
[42:37] at mid January for services with him.
[42:39] And I got confirmation this morning that
[42:41] brother Kry Diggs is going to grace us
[42:42] with his presence in 2026. Dates to be
[42:45] determined. So, we're just going to
[42:47] trust the Lord to lead and guide and
[42:49] bless us in those things. Make a way for
[42:51] each one to come. Amen. We've got room
[42:52] for brother Diggs now. He'd have taken
[42:55] down the old building, I think, but we
[42:56] got room for him to run and roam the way
[42:58] he does. And so we're trusting that when
[43:00] he comes it'll be a blessing as well.
[43:03] Want to remember Sister Beverly Gail.
[43:04] She messaged me yesterday. She said
[43:06] their grandson Jax had fever for two
[43:08] days. Asked me to pray for that which I
[43:09] did. But she's also going for surgery on
[43:12] Wednesday. She'll be in the hospital
[43:13] Tuesday night overnight in preparation
[43:15] for surgery Wednesday. So she's asking
[43:17] for prayer for that as well. So we want
[43:19] to remember her. Amen. God bless you.
[43:22] Matthew chap 16 and verse 24. And
[43:24] actually we'll read 25 and 26 as well.
[43:28] says, "Then said Jesus unto his
[43:29] disciples, if any man will come after
[43:32] me, let him deny himself and take up his
[43:35] cross and follow me. For whosoever will
[43:38] save his life shall lose it, and
[43:40] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[43:43] shall find it. For what is a man
[43:46] profited if he shall gain the whole
[43:48] world and lose his own soul? Or what
[43:50] shall a man give in exchange for his
[43:53] soul?" Amen. God bless you. You can have
[43:55] your seats this morning. We're
[43:57] continuing our new Sunday morning series
[43:59] on a position of dominion. And this
[44:01] morning, I want to take a a thought or a
[44:04] title of the first enemy. Now, last
[44:06] service, you remember we spoke about the
[44:07] first battle about for the believer on
[44:10] earth. And it was in the garden of Eden
[44:12] when the serpent serpent had a
[44:13] conversation with Eve and he challenged
[44:15] her about the word of God. And God had
[44:18] told Adam and Eve, "Don't touch the tree
[44:20] of knowledge of good and evil. Leave it
[44:21] alone. The day you eat thereof, that's
[44:23] the day you die." And then the serpent
[44:25] heard it and he said, "You won't
[44:26] actually die, but God knows that the day
[44:28] that you touch it, the day that you eat
[44:29] it, that's the day you'll become just
[44:31] like him. And God's just trying to keep
[44:33] you from becoming like him." And so he
[44:35] reasoned with Eve and he seduced her so
[44:38] completely that she believed a direct
[44:39] contradiction of the word of God.
[44:42] Church, that ought to make us wake up
[44:43] sometimes that that a a child of God in
[44:46] a perfect situation
[44:48] can still be seduced off of the word of
[44:51] God. And it takes time, but he can do it
[44:55] because he's got lots of time. Amen. And
[44:57] so she believed a direct contradiction
[44:59] of go of the word of God that brought
[45:01] all the pain and suffering that we have
[45:03] today. It caused natural death, but it
[45:04] caused spiritual death. It caused a
[45:06] separation from God. And Eve lost that
[45:09] first battle. And I want to take the
[45:11] step from there and see what was it that
[45:13] lost Eve the battle. What was it that
[45:15] took her down this road? We talked last
[45:18] service about how that Eve got away from
[45:19] the protection of the word. And when she
[45:21] did that, she was an easy target. She
[45:23] had no shield. She had no weapon. Amen.
[45:26] He had no power over her. But when she
[45:29] stepped away from the word, she had no
[45:31] protection. And she became an easy
[45:33] target. And she gave him power over her
[45:36] by stepping away from what was her
[45:38] power. Amen. She gave herself over to
[45:41] him. She stopped to have a conversation.
[45:43] She stopped to listen. She stopped to
[45:45] reason. And when she did that, she put
[45:46] herself in a position to lose. And if
[45:49] you stay in a position to lose, church,
[45:51] eventually you're going to lose. You
[45:53] can't get out from the word and stay
[45:54] away from it and expect victory. It's
[45:56] not going to happen. And so she stayed
[45:57] out of it long enough that it caused her
[45:59] to fall. She could have stepped back.
[46:01] She should have stepped back. The
[46:03] further it went away from the word, the
[46:04] more it should have been ringing alarm
[46:06] bells in her head. Get back to the word.
[46:08] Get back to the word. But she stayed
[46:10] there and she kept listening for a
[46:12] reason. She stayed for a reason. Why?
[46:16] Because what he was talking about was
[46:18] for her personal benefit.
[46:22] The way that he presented it, it was
[46:24] going to take her to a higher place, a a
[46:26] a greater reality, greater potential,
[46:29] greater success. She was going to be
[46:30] like God. She was going to have
[46:32] something she thought she was lacking in
[46:34] the first place. And he held her so
[46:36] powerfully because he offered her
[46:38] elevation above her natural position.
[46:42] He took her he was offering her to go
[46:44] higher than she thought that she was at
[46:46] that point. He thought he was she
[46:48] thought he was going to give him some
[46:50] her something that she had never
[46:52] experienced and that experience was
[46:53] going to be greater than what she had
[46:55] right there. And she didn't walk away
[46:57] because she was seduced ultimately by
[46:59] selfish desire. It was something that
[47:02] she thought would make her life better.
[47:04] Church, we've got an enemy today.
[47:06] There's no doubt about it. But the
[47:07] problem is we keep looking out there for
[47:09] the enemy rather than looking inwardly
[47:11] for the enemy. Amen. We're going to be
[47:13] we're going to be real pastoral this
[47:15] morning if that's okay. Amen. We've got
[47:16] to we've got to resolve the enemy that
[47:18] is within before we look for the enemy
[47:20] that is without. Amen. That's what we're
[47:22] looking at this morning. We're so busy
[47:24] looking at Satan and we forget that
[47:26] we've got an enemy that's built into us.
[47:28] This natural flesh, the natural desires,
[47:30] the natural inclinations, the reasoning
[47:32] and thinking that comes with this whole
[47:34] thing, church. And this whole series is
[47:36] on overcoming. But I've got to say this
[47:38] to start. Before you can win, you've got
[47:40] to lose. Before you can have the
[47:42] victory, you've got to let somebody else
[47:44] have the victory. Amen. That's what's
[47:46] got to happen. You've got to overcome
[47:48] yourself before you can overcome Satan.
[47:50] Because in yourself, you've never
[47:51] overcome Satan. And if your ultimate
[47:54] victory is going to be over him and the
[47:56] things that he holds, you've got to
[47:57] defeat the thing that holds us back in
[47:58] the first place. And that is self. This
[48:00] self will never defeat Satan. It cannot
[48:03] do it. It's never done it. He's been
[48:05] winning for generation after generation
[48:07] over people that thought they could beat
[48:09] him in themselves.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a generation of
[48:13] overcomers. There's a blood seed of
[48:15] overcomers that has been here. But we've
[48:17] got to go the way of that first seed.
[48:20] We've got to go the way of the royal
[48:21] seed if we're going to have this victory
[48:23] that we're talking about. Amen. And the
[48:25] beautiful thing is we've got a template.
[48:27] We've got a template for how do I
[48:28] overcome? This whole series, if I could
[48:30] summarize it, how do I overcome?
[48:32] standing in the position of dominion,
[48:34] being in a place of victory. How do we
[48:36] do it? We've got to go the way of the
[48:37] original victor, the mighty conqueror,
[48:39] amen, that went before us and showed us
[48:41] the way. I'm going to take us into our
[48:43] own church age. This is our scripture,
[48:45] church. This is written just for us. It
[48:47] is not for anyone else. It's just for
[48:49] us, okay? This is Revelation chapter 3
[48:51] to the Leadyian church age. This is the
[48:53] overcomer's instructions. Now, he said,
[48:55] you know, I he's told us our natural
[48:57] condition. He's told us the remedy. But
[49:00] then he says, "Behold, I stand at the
[49:01] door and knock. And if any man hear my
[49:04] voice and open the door, I'll come into
[49:06] him and will s with him and he with me."
[49:09] Overcoming requires that you recognize
[49:11] the voice of God, the message of God to
[49:15] your age. You got to recognize your day
[49:18] and its message to overcome.
[49:21] Noah's message did no good in Moses'
[49:23] day. Moses' message did no good in
[49:26] Joshua's day.
[49:28] It was a continuation. But Joshua did
[49:30] things that Moses never had to do.
[49:32] Joshua did things Moses never had to
[49:34] contend with. It has to keep moving.
[49:36] You've got to catch your message for
[49:37] your day and for your situation. Amen.
[49:39] You can't overcome without hearing it,
[49:42] accepting it, and acting on it. You've
[49:46] got to open the door to that. And he
[49:47] says, "Now to him that overcomemeth will
[49:50] I grant to sit it with me in my throne."
[49:52] Catch this. Even as I also overcame and
[49:56] am set down with my father in his
[49:58] throne, he that hath an ear, let him
[50:00] hear with the spirit saith unto the
[50:02] churches. Now remember, the Bible said
[50:03] that Jesus was the firstborn among many
[50:07] brethren. In other words, he's the first
[50:09] of a lineage of overcomers. He's a he's
[50:12] a first of a lineage of children of God
[50:14] that will walk in the same life, that'll
[50:17] walk in the same footsteps, that'll have
[50:19] the same power, the same authority. Do
[50:21] you hear me this morning? They'll be
[50:23] just like him, but they'll be little
[50:25] ones instead of complete ones.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That's who I'm preaching to this
[50:29] morning. Amen. He says, "Yes, the
[50:31] overcomer will sit in the in my throne
[50:33] with me, but he says to do that, you've
[50:35] got to overcome the way I overcame.
[50:38] You've got to do what I did." Church, I
[50:40] love when he gives us something that
[50:42] says, "You got to be like me." Because
[50:43] it means he's got to do something in me
[50:45] to get me there. It means I've got a
[50:47] promise that he'll fulfill it because
[50:49] he's requiring it. God can't make a
[50:51] requirement and be just if he doesn't
[50:52] give us the means to fulfill it.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't do it in ourselves. So,
[50:56] he's got to do it in us. So, Jesus says,
[50:58] "You've got to win the way I won. You've
[51:00] got to get the victory the way that I
[51:02] got the victory." Church, what was the
[51:04] great victory that Jesus won?
[51:07] What do you think was his greatest
[51:08] victory?
[51:10] Was his greatest victory over death and
[51:12] hell? Was it when he walked on water?
[51:15] Was it when he healed the sick? Was it
[51:16] when he he he gave eyesight to the
[51:18] blind? Was it when he raised the dead?
[51:20] Was it when he took the loaves and
[51:21] fishes and produced it from itself?
[51:25] Was it when he thought spoke things into
[51:27] existence? Was it when he spoke things
[51:28] out of existence?
[51:30] Those are all great victories. I want to
[51:32] have those victories.
[51:34] We've had those victories. But there is
[51:36] a greater victory than all of that
[51:37] before that. Amen. Because I want you to
[51:40] catch something here. Overcoming is like
[51:42] a game of dominoes. Overcoming is a
[51:46] series of events that lead you to a
[51:49] final victory.
[51:51] Victory in the overcoming sense is a
[51:55] series of things that build up to a
[51:56] great victory. Okay? The final victory
[51:59] that Paul said, remember he says the
[52:01] last thing that shall be defeated is
[52:02] what? Death. That means there's a bunch
[52:04] of other things that are defeated before
[52:06] that. So, we've got a bunch of battles
[52:08] lined up before us. We've got a series
[52:10] of events where we have to overcome
[52:12] before us. It's like a game of dominoes.
[52:14] You've got to beat one before you can
[52:15] beat the next one. One has to fall
[52:18] before the next one can fall. Amen. But
[52:19] I want you to see in this life, there's
[52:21] an inequality to our victory. There's an
[52:24] inequality to our overcoming. We are the
[52:26] definition of inequal to what we're
[52:28] facing. And I want you to see this by
[52:30] the scriptures. Okay? Take us back to
[52:32] what Paul said in 1 Corinthians. He
[52:33] says, "But we preach Christ crucified,
[52:36] unto the Jews a stumbling block, and
[52:38] unto the Greeks foolishness." So Paul
[52:40] says, and we remember this for later.
[52:42] This is key for this service. He says,
[52:44] "We preach Christ crucified." He says,
[52:46] "And that's for a reason. We preach
[52:48] Christ resurrected, too, but Christ
[52:50] crucified is the starting element. It's
[52:53] the first domino in this victory chain."
[52:55] Okay? He says, "But unto them which are
[52:57] called, both Jews and Greece, Greeks."
[53:00] So to them, hold on. It is foolishness.
[53:02] It's a stumbling block. But he says,
[53:04] "But them who are called to the true
[53:06] believer, to the royal seed of Abraham,
[53:08] both Jews and Greeks, Christ crucified
[53:11] is Christ the power of God and the
[53:13] wisdom of God." So as if we preach
[53:16] Christ crucified to everyone else, it's
[53:17] a stumbling block. It's foolishness. But
[53:19] to the called to us, it means that it's
[53:22] power and wisdom. Christ crucified is
[53:25] power and wisdom. Amen. Hold this
[53:27] thought. Now he says because the
[53:28] foolishness of God Christ crucified is
[53:32] wiser than men and the weakness of God
[53:35] is stronger than men. So what seems
[53:37] foolish to humanity is God's wisdom and
[53:40] what seems weak to humanity is the
[53:42] strength of God and it's greater than
[53:45] anything that we have. Foolishness and
[53:48] weakness is greater than anything that
[53:50] we have. Okay? Now catch this as he says
[53:53] this. Now I'm preaching to us.
[53:56] For ye see who's calling?
[54:00] Your calling. Raise your hand if that's
[54:02] your calling this morning. Okay. Half
[54:04] the church is called this morning. For
[54:06] you see your calling. That's my calling.
[54:10] Okay. For you see your calling. He's
[54:12] talking to you and I, brethren. How that
[54:14] not many
[54:16] wise.
[54:21] How that not many wise men after the
[54:23] flesh, not many mighty,
[54:29] not many noble
[54:32] are called. Look around you.
[54:38] And it's true.
[54:40] We're just regular people.
[54:44] We are. We're regular
[54:48] more or less. [snorts]
[54:50] Okay,
[54:52] that's good.
[54:54] It means you can identify with what he's
[54:56] talking about.
[54:58] But catch this now. But God has made do
[55:02] with the
[55:06] Come on. God has [snorts] chosen the
[55:11] foolish things.
[55:15] Come on now.
[55:17] God has chosen you and I, the foolish
[55:20] things
[55:22] of the world, what the world thinks are
[55:25] foolish,
[55:27] to confound the wise.
[55:30] And God has
[55:33] chosen
[55:35] the
[55:37] weak things.
[55:39] God has chosen the weak things of the
[55:41] world to confound the things that are
[55:45] mighty. If you're foolish and weak,
[55:46] raise your hands this morning compared
[55:48] to what the world says. Okay, now we're
[55:50] moving forward. He says, "I've chosen
[55:53] you. I've chosen you. I wasn't forced."
[55:58] Anybody ever get picked last in sports?
[56:02] A number.
[56:04] And you know what? You know that they
[56:06] had to choose you. And there's no worse
[56:09] feeling I've been told.
[56:14] There's no worse feeling. I've been told
[56:15] to pick be picked last and everybody
[56:18] else been picking. They kind of look at
[56:19] you and they go, "Well, I guess I'll
[56:21] take her." Right? God didn't do that.
[56:25] God said, "Give me Elsa.
[56:28] I want her.
[56:30] I want the one that nobody else think
[56:33] can do it.
[56:35] I want the one that has nothing.
[56:38] slow.
[56:41] Doesn't know what she's doing.
[56:43] Yeah. God chose. God chose.
[56:48] God chose.
[56:51] And the base things.
[56:54] Sorry. He said to confound. You know
[56:56] what that word confound means? I'm going
[56:58] to use them to shame, to disgrace, and
[57:01] to humiliate the wise and the mighty.
[57:07] We use little people to do big things.
[57:11] He says, "And the base things, you and
[57:12] I, of the world, and the things which
[57:15] are despised,
[57:18] hath God chosen, yay, and things which
[57:21] are not to bring to not things that
[57:23] are." So the things that are not reality
[57:25] yet? He says, "I'm going to use those to
[57:27] enull to take away the things that are
[57:29] present with us already." So the things
[57:32] that seem like they can always stand,
[57:34] I'm going to use something that doesn't
[57:35] yet exist to take them out of out of
[57:37] existence, to make them nothing.
[57:40] He says that no flesh should glory in
[57:42] his presence.
[57:44] That no human being should brag in his
[57:47] presence. Why? Because the things that
[57:48] were mighty have been reduced to
[57:50] nothing. And the ones that have become
[57:53] something know that they came from
[57:54] nothing. You've been raised up by his
[57:56] grace. Amen.
[57:58] We're there by God's elective grace. He
[58:00] says, "But of him are ye in Christ
[58:02] Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom
[58:04] and righteousness and sanctification and
[58:07] redemption, that according as it is
[58:09] written, he that glorieth, let him glory
[58:12] in the Lord." Let me summarize it this.
[58:15] God takes nobody's and nothings to
[58:18] destroy somebody's and somethings. Okay?
[58:20] That's what that whole scripture we just
[58:22] read. Amen. There's an inequality that
[58:24] we're dealing with when it comes to
[58:25] victory. And God says one plus one is
[58:28] more than a thousand.
[58:30] God says 2 plus two is more than 10,000
[58:34] because a thousand will fall at that
[58:35] left hand and 10,000 at that right hand.
[58:37] But I won't allow you to fall down.
[58:40] God can take something that is so
[58:42] insignificant and turn it into a
[58:44] victorious person. That's what Paul is
[58:46] talking about here. God's math is not
[58:48] like our math. And God can do great
[58:50] things with little things. Now I want to
[58:52] take us and I want to show this by
[58:53] example this morning. We have something
[58:55] in mathematics that's called geometric
[58:58] growth. And this is something that we
[59:00] can see in a domino effect. Amen. And
[59:02] it's how you can get something very
[59:04] large to fall by way of using something
[59:06] much much smaller. Amen. There's this
[59:09] professor here that did a study on this.
[59:11] And and and the final domino, the one at
[59:13] the very end there is about 3 feet tall
[59:15] and it weighs about 100 pounds.
[59:18] Now, if I were to ask you, what size
[59:19] domino does it take to knock down that?
[59:22] And you said roughly 2/3 the size, then
[59:24] you'd be roughly right. Okay. But what
[59:27] if I handed you a domino
[59:32] that big,
[59:35] 5 mm tall,
[59:37] roughly the size of a SIM card, lighter
[59:40] than a tic tac, and said, "Knock that
[59:43] down."
[59:45] Can anybody see that from the back?
[59:48] Barely, right? But I guarantee if I had
[59:50] that 100 pound three-footer up here, you
[59:52] could see that. If I come up to you and
[59:54] I said, "I want you to knock it down
[59:56] with this." What would you say, brother?
[59:57] John, you're crazy. Can't be done. It
[59:59] cannot be done. And you'd be absolutely
[1:00:02] right. This thing is so small. Look at
[1:00:04] what it is. That's him putting the final
[1:00:07] piece to this puzzle there. That's this
[1:00:10] man starting a victory. And it's this
[1:00:12] tiny little piece here, 5 millime high,
[1:00:16] 1 millimeter thick. But what if you had
[1:00:19] a series of friends that was just a
[1:00:21] little bit bigger? What if you had a
[1:00:23] series of victories that was just a
[1:00:25] little bit greater than you?
[1:00:27] What if you had something on your side
[1:00:29] that was just a little bit more than
[1:00:30] what you could do in your own? What
[1:00:33] could you do then? What if there's a
[1:00:35] continuous change, a continuous growth
[1:00:37] along the path where each one was half
[1:00:39] again as big as the one before it?
[1:00:43] I want you to consider something here.
[1:00:45] This first domino is virtually nothing
[1:00:48] compared to the last one.
[1:00:50] Virtually nothing. This domino when it
[1:00:53] falls has two billionths
[1:00:56] two billionths of the energy of the
[1:00:59] final domino.
[1:01:01] Insignificant. You could take this thing
[1:01:03] and you could blow on it
[1:01:06] and it could blow and it would move.
[1:01:10] Sorry, Sister Amber.
[1:01:12] You take a SIM card and you put it
[1:01:13] there. You can blow that with your
[1:01:15] breath and you say you're going to knock
[1:01:16] down a 100 pound 3-ft tall thing with
[1:01:18] that. How you going to do it, brother
[1:01:19] John? Geometric growth is how we're
[1:01:21] going to do it. A series of victories.
[1:01:24] Okay.
[1:01:26] It can't knock down a 3-ft tall 100
[1:01:29] pound domino. But you know what? It can
[1:01:31] knock down a 7 1/.5 mm by 2 mm block.
[1:01:37] And then that one can knock down a 12 mm
[1:01:39] block. And that one can knock down an 18
[1:01:42] mm block.
[1:01:44] See, it just takes a little bit to get
[1:01:47] it moving along. Okay, I want you to
[1:01:49] think about this. With 13 dominoes, each
[1:01:52] one progressively larger than the other,
[1:01:55] it can knock down something that's 50%
[1:01:57] bigger than itself at each stage.
[1:02:02] So that as this one little domino falls
[1:02:05] at the beginning,
[1:02:10] see if this will roll.
[1:02:15] That's what happens. That's geometric
[1:02:17] growth, church. Something the size of
[1:02:20] your SIM card just knocked down
[1:02:22] something that was 100 pounds.
[1:02:24] You say he didn't do it. Yes, he did. He
[1:02:27] started it. He started it. Okay. It's
[1:02:32] progressive victory. It comes in stages.
[1:02:36] Okay. Let's talk about the potential for
[1:02:38] this. That was 13 dominoes. If you add
[1:02:41] another 16, do you know how big the
[1:02:43] final domino would be, church?
[1:02:46] the size of the Empire State Building,
[1:02:50] 443
[1:02:53] m tall. So you have something this tall
[1:02:57] versus something that is 88,600
[1:03:01] times bigger.
[1:03:06] And it all starts with one little thing
[1:03:08] falling over at the beginning.
[1:03:10] Amen.
[1:03:11] If I were to tell you that a tic tac
[1:03:13] could knock over the Empire State
[1:03:14] Building, you'd say it can't be done. It
[1:03:16] can, but it takes a series of stages to
[1:03:19] do it. Amen. Look at this.
[1:03:24] 29 dominoes
[1:03:26] and you can get to the Empire State
[1:03:27] Building. And if it was a domino, wasn't
[1:03:30] anchored, it'd fall over.
[1:03:33] Are you with me this morning? So many
[1:03:36] times what we're looking at is the
[1:03:39] Empire State Building.
[1:03:41] It cannot be moved. It cannot fall. It's
[1:03:45] bigger than me.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; It's greater than me. Who am I?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Why should I even try?
[1:03:54] Why should I even try? Amen. And what
[1:03:56] are we doing? The thing is, we're trying
[1:03:58] to meet power with power. We're trying
[1:04:00] to meet force with force. And we're
[1:04:03] looking inwardly for that. And we're
[1:04:05] saying in myself
[1:04:08] is insufficiency.
[1:04:10] and I can't win. I can't do this. It's
[1:04:13] not going to happen. Amen. But remember,
[1:04:15] God's in the business of doing big
[1:04:17] things with little people. It's the
[1:04:20] weak. It's the despised. It's the
[1:04:22] foolish that knock down Empire State
[1:04:24] Buildings. Amen. But what starts the
[1:04:26] victory, church? What starts the
[1:04:28] sequence to overcoming?
[1:04:31] One thing has to fall. One thing has to
[1:04:35] fall. One thing has to let go. One thing
[1:04:38] has to be acted upon. Someone
[1:04:42] has to lay themselves down.
[1:04:45] Someone has to let themselves go.
[1:04:47] Someone has to sacrifice themselves for
[1:04:50] victory to happen. Someone has to say,
[1:04:52] "I'm going to lay down and trust that
[1:04:55] somebody else will pick me up so I can
[1:04:56] celebrate when the dust settles."
[1:04:59] Somebody's got to do that. Amen. Jesus
[1:05:01] says, "You've got to overcome the way
[1:05:03] that I overcome." How did he overcome?
[1:05:05] What was the great victory that Jesus
[1:05:07] had? The great victory Jesus had was not
[1:05:10] my will but thine be done. He pled, he
[1:05:13] cried. He pleaded. He he he suffered. He
[1:05:17] sweated blood.
[1:05:19] But in the end, the greatest victory he
[1:05:22] had was when he said, "Not my will, but
[1:05:24] thine be done." And when he did that, he
[1:05:26] laid himself down and he started a chain
[1:05:29] reaction that would lead to holding the
[1:05:31] keys to death and hell and the grave. So
[1:05:35] that when you and I fight, we're facing
[1:05:36] a defeated enemy. An enemy that is prone
[1:05:40] to topple if we can just make him move a
[1:05:43] little bit. Are you with me? Amen. The
[1:05:48] way to overcoming power was to lay down
[1:05:51] your free will. That's the way that he
[1:05:53] had to do it. Watch this now as we set
[1:05:55] this pattern for the first enemy. Bam.
[1:05:58] says to him that overcomemeth will I
[1:06:00] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:06:01] as I also overcame and am set down on my
[1:06:04] father in his throne. He says now what
[1:06:06] are we to overcome? He says that's the
[1:06:08] normal question to ask here but that is
[1:06:10] not the actual thought of this verse for
[1:06:12] is not so much what we are to overcome
[1:06:15] but how we are to overcome. Now this is
[1:06:18] logical for does it matter much what we
[1:06:20] are to overcome as long as we know how
[1:06:23] we could overcome. He says, "A quick
[1:06:25] look at these scriptures which involve
[1:06:26] the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out
[1:06:28] the truth of his proposition." Amen.
[1:06:30] That's exactly the truth. What we're
[1:06:32] looking for is how to overcome because
[1:06:34] we can't predict every circumstance.
[1:06:35] I've said this in other services
[1:06:37] already. I don't know what you're going
[1:06:38] to face. So, I can't tell you how to
[1:06:41] deal with it, but I can tell you how to
[1:06:42] overcome
[1:06:44] because there's only one way that we
[1:06:46] overcome. And it's the same thing every
[1:06:47] time. We'll see as we go through this
[1:06:49] service and through this series. If I
[1:06:51] could tell you if you're a hockey player
[1:06:52] and I could show you a move that works
[1:06:55] all the time to score a goal, then what
[1:06:58] would it matter what team you're facing?
[1:07:00] How big they are, how fast they are, how
[1:07:01] strong they are, how skilled they are,
[1:07:03] how mean they are, how many of them
[1:07:04] there are. It wouldn't matter if I've
[1:07:06] given you the way to score a goal that
[1:07:07] nobody can stop. All you need to do is
[1:07:09] keep doing the same thing over and over
[1:07:11] again. It'll defeat it every time. It'll
[1:07:13] score a goal every time. That's what
[1:07:14] he's saying here. If you know how to
[1:07:16] overcome, it doesn't matter what you're
[1:07:17] facing, you'll get the victory anyways.
[1:07:20] He says in Matthew 4, when Jesus is
[1:07:22] tempted of the devil, he overcame the
[1:07:24] personal temptations of Satan. Personal
[1:07:26] temptations, we'll get into this in a
[1:07:28] moment, of Satan by the word and by the
[1:07:31] word only. In each of the three major
[1:07:34] trials that corresponded exactly to the
[1:07:36] temptation of the Garden of Eden, the
[1:07:38] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,
[1:07:39] and the pride of life, Jesus overcome by
[1:07:42] the word. Eve fell to the personal
[1:07:45] temptation of Satan by failing to use
[1:07:48] the word. Adam fell in direct
[1:07:50] disobedience to the word. Do you see the
[1:07:52] two events there? Eve fell by personal
[1:07:54] temptation. Adam chose to disobey. He
[1:07:58] was not deceived. He was not seduced. He
[1:08:00] made a choice. But Eve was seduced. She
[1:08:02] was convinced by personal temptation.
[1:08:05] Let me say it this way. When Satan comes
[1:08:07] to you with his temptation, it's going
[1:08:08] to be personal. Satan's going to offer
[1:08:11] you something that you've been craving,
[1:08:12] that you've been crying, that you've
[1:08:14] been desiring for. Amen. It'll appeal
[1:08:16] specifically and personally to you.
[1:08:20] Listen, if you got a complex, it'll feed
[1:08:23] that complex. It'll give you something
[1:08:25] that'll take away that complex. Amen. It
[1:08:27] It'll make it'll pull to your flesh,
[1:08:29] your pride, your needs, your your desire
[1:08:32] for approval, trying to make you feel
[1:08:34] warm and warm and fuzzy, trying to make
[1:08:35] you think that you're somebody. It's
[1:08:37] going to come and it's going to appeal
[1:08:38] to you. Amen. It'll offer you what you
[1:08:41] think you've been missing all along.
[1:08:43] Okay?
[1:08:45] He'll make you think you can be
[1:08:46] somebody. He'll think you can be such a
[1:08:49] success nobody can ignore you now.
[1:08:52] He'll make you think that if he only
[1:08:53] does this then everyone will love you or
[1:08:55] someone will love you finally.
[1:08:58] Someone will accept you as you are.
[1:09:02] He'll make you think he can make you
[1:09:03] happy. And I'll tell you this, the one
[1:09:06] thing that Satan always offers is he
[1:09:08] offers you something that you can only
[1:09:10] get when your character is proven by
[1:09:12] God. But he'll offer it to you now.
[1:09:16] He'll offer you the benefit without the
[1:09:18] trial and the testing without the
[1:09:21] proving. You won't come through with
[1:09:23] gold tried is in the fire as the
[1:09:26] scripture talks about. You won't come
[1:09:27] through with godly character. You'll
[1:09:28] come through with something that will
[1:09:29] destroy you because you lack the
[1:09:31] character to control it. Amen. He says
[1:09:35] but Jesus overcame by the word. And
[1:09:37] right now let me say this is the only
[1:09:39] way to be an overcomer. Also, it is the
[1:09:42] only way you can know if you are
[1:09:43] overcoming because the word can't fail.
[1:09:45] You say, "I'm failing." It's because the
[1:09:47] word isn't there. Then you haven't
[1:09:49] trusted the word. You haven't let the
[1:09:51] word take its preeminence. He says, "Now
[1:09:53] notice again how Jesus overcame the
[1:09:55] world systems of religion." When he was
[1:09:57] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[1:09:59] of his day, he constantly applied the
[1:10:01] word. He spake only what the father gave
[1:10:03] him to speak. There was not a time when
[1:10:05] the world was not utterly confused by
[1:10:08] his wisdom, for it was the wisdom of
[1:10:10] God. Remember, he's going to confound
[1:10:11] the wisdom with the foolishness of God.
[1:10:15] And it's still greater. Why? Because
[1:10:16] they can never get grasp the word. It
[1:10:18] doesn't make sense to them. But catch
[1:10:20] this. He says in his own personal life.
[1:10:23] See, we've got to separate the two. I
[1:10:25] know they're together, but for a moment,
[1:10:27] you got to see that he's the firstborn
[1:10:28] among many brethren. Jesus had his own
[1:10:30] mind. He had his own will. He had his
[1:10:32] own flesh. He was as human as you or I.
[1:10:36] The difference is he had the full deity
[1:10:38] within him. But catch this. He says in
[1:10:41] his own personal life, contending with
[1:10:43] who? Himself.
[1:10:46] This is the great battle. This is the
[1:10:48] first enemy. Amen. He says, "Contending
[1:10:50] with himself, he overcame how?" By
[1:10:53] obedience to the word of God. In Hebrews
[1:10:55] 5:7, it says, "Who in the days of his
[1:10:57] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[1:11:00] supplications and strong cryings and
[1:11:02] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:11:05] from death." Anybody else been crying
[1:11:07] out lately? Lord, save me. Lord, help
[1:11:10] me. Lord, provide for me. Lord, save
[1:11:12] this one. Lord, help this one. Lord,
[1:11:13] move on this situation. Lord, do this.
[1:11:15] Do that.
[1:11:17] That's what Jesus did in the Garden of
[1:11:20] Gethsemane. He was there and he's
[1:11:22] sweating blood. He's in such agony. He's
[1:11:26] in such trial. He's in such temptation
[1:11:30] that he's sweating blood.
[1:11:33] And he's pouring out his heart as a man
[1:11:36] to God that was within him.
[1:11:39] crying out.
[1:11:41] But after that it says what?
[1:11:45] That he was able to save him from death
[1:11:47] and was heard in that he feared. Though
[1:11:50] were he were a son, yet learned he
[1:11:52] obedience by the things which he
[1:11:53] suffered. And being made perfect, he
[1:11:56] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:11:58] unto all them that obey him. He says,
[1:12:01] what was his what was he obedient to?
[1:12:04] The word of God. I'm teaching you how to
[1:12:06] be. He's teaching us how to overcome.
[1:12:08] And we see it with Jesus. He cried. He
[1:12:10] prayed. He pleaded with God Almighty. He
[1:12:13] desired not to lay his life down. His
[1:12:16] human desire was, "Let this cup pass
[1:12:19] from me. Don't make me drink it." And
[1:12:22] God wouldn't make him drink it.
[1:12:27] But he said, "Nevertheless,
[1:12:30] not my will, but thine be done." And he
[1:12:34] took the cup of death and he drank it of
[1:12:37] his own free will. Amen. How did he
[1:12:40] overcome? By obedience to what the word
[1:12:43] required him to do, regardless of how it
[1:12:45] made him feel. Regardless of what it
[1:12:48] did, church, he put himself last instead
[1:12:51] of first.
[1:12:53] He's the beginning of all creation.
[1:12:57] He's the image of God.
[1:13:00] He gave up his position. He gave up his
[1:13:03] fellowship. He gave up his holiness. He
[1:13:05] gave up his throne. He gave up that that
[1:13:08] uh uh constant uh fellowship with God
[1:13:11] day by day. He laid it all down and he
[1:13:13] took the cup of death for you and I. He
[1:13:16] died out to himself. He gave up
[1:13:18] everything and yielded himself over. And
[1:13:21] in the end, Jesus said, "Into thy hands
[1:13:24] I commit my spirit." And the domino got
[1:13:27] pushed over. He fell. He wasn't pushed.
[1:13:31] He fell.
[1:13:33] He laid himself down.
[1:13:36] Into thy hands I commit my spirit. He
[1:13:39] let himself fall to start a domino chain
[1:13:44] of victory. And what did it start with?
[1:13:47] Laying his life down. Laying everything
[1:13:50] that in his flesh he desired and laying
[1:13:54] it aside
[1:13:56] for victory's sake for the joy that lay
[1:13:59] before him. That's what the scripture
[1:14:00] says. That's you and I, church. That's
[1:14:02] you and I. Amen. How do we overcome? By
[1:14:05] yielding ourselves to the complete word
[1:14:08] alone. That's it. Amen. We lay ourselves
[1:14:11] down. We give in completely to the word
[1:14:13] of God. We die out to our thoughts. We
[1:14:15] die out to our opinions. We die out to
[1:14:17] our natural human rights.
[1:14:20] Amen. We're in Leodysa, the age of
[1:14:23] people's rights. We die out to that. So,
[1:14:24] it has no power over us. Amen. I know
[1:14:27] I've said this a million times. Amen. We
[1:14:29] don't let ourselves get led around by
[1:14:31] our feelings,
[1:14:32] by how we feel about what's going to
[1:14:34] happen if we make this decision. We
[1:14:37] can't be led around by our feelings.
[1:14:39] Otherwise, Satan will lead us around by
[1:14:40] the nose and we'll lose the victory
[1:14:42] every time. Rebes his thought in the
[1:14:45] church age. He says, "Remember, we have
[1:14:46] shown clearly all through the ages that
[1:14:48] even as Adam and Eve fell because they
[1:14:50] left the word, so the Ephesian age fell
[1:14:52] by turning slightly
[1:14:55] from the word until with every age
[1:14:58] continuing to turn away, we have a final
[1:15:00] repudiation of the word by the world
[1:15:03] church system." Geometric growth works
[1:15:05] both ways. See, they're quickly going to
[1:15:09] hell. We're quickly going to eternity.
[1:15:12] But it starts slow. It starts small.
[1:15:14] They started slow. They started small.
[1:15:16] The Ephesian church just got off a
[1:15:18] little bit. But where when you look at
[1:15:20] today church, what used to take
[1:15:22] centuries
[1:15:23] to go through a church system, now they
[1:15:26] can do it in a year, two years. Look at
[1:15:28] what's happened. Look at what's
[1:15:30] happened. You look at these churches
[1:15:31] that are full of homosexuals and they're
[1:15:33] they're promoting it. Drag shows in
[1:15:36] church, singing rock and roll songs in
[1:15:38] church. I saw a priest dressed up as
[1:15:40] Dracula in the pulpit the other day.
[1:15:44] church, this is happening like this.
[1:15:46] Why? Because everything's accelerating
[1:15:48] to that final moment and we're going
[1:15:51] into victory and they're going into
[1:15:53] defeat.
[1:15:55] Amen.
[1:15:56] He says this Leo age ends in a blackout
[1:15:59] of the word. We're way past that. Not
[1:16:03] just a blackout of the word as they are
[1:16:04] embracing Satanism
[1:16:08] openly.
[1:16:09] He says thereby causing a departure of
[1:16:11] the Lord from the midst. He says he
[1:16:14] stands outside calling to his own who
[1:16:15] follow him by obedience to the word. And
[1:16:18] after a short and powerful demonstration
[1:16:20] of the spirit, this little hunted and
[1:16:22] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:16:24] Jesus. Now, in this series, we're going
[1:16:26] to get into the idea of gates and access
[1:16:28] points for Satan that he comes at us and
[1:16:30] how we overcome those things. But I want
[1:16:32] to just look at our humanity in general
[1:16:34] today because we're talking about self.
[1:16:36] Amen. And remember what Paul would say.
[1:16:37] Paul would talk about his self. He would
[1:16:39] talk about the flesh and he'd call it
[1:16:41] this body of death. this body of death
[1:16:43] and they'd say, "Who will deliver me
[1:16:45] from this body of death? We're in a
[1:16:47] constant fight, church. We're in a
[1:16:49] constant fight." Amen. And that was
[1:16:51] something that worked at Paul at all
[1:16:53] times. But he got the victory.
[1:16:56] Hallelujah. Romans 7 is the fight.
[1:16:58] Romans 8 is the victory. There is
[1:17:00] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:17:01] which are in Christ. Amen. But it
[1:17:03] doesn't mean the battle went away, but
[1:17:05] there was a daily dying out and there
[1:17:07] was a daily victory that came with that.
[1:17:09] But I want you to see Paul's approach. I
[1:17:10] want you to see what happened with Paul
[1:17:12] because Paul was one of those wise and
[1:17:14] mighty people.
[1:17:17] And remember, that's not who God uses.
[1:17:21] Not many are even called, but he's got
[1:17:24] to do something with them. Now Paul, now
[1:17:26] we we opened in 1 Corinthians 1 earlier.
[1:17:29] Let's go to 1 Corinthians 2. [snorts] He
[1:17:32] says, "And I, brethren, when I came to
[1:17:34] you, came not with excellency of speech
[1:17:36] or of wisdom, declaring unto you the
[1:17:38] testimony of God. For I determine not to
[1:17:41] know anything among you save Jesus
[1:17:43] Christ and him crucified. Remember
[1:17:45] that's the power of God and the wisdom
[1:17:47] of God to us is Christ crucified. It's
[1:17:49] foolishness to everyone else. It's power
[1:17:51] and wisdom to us. Christ crucified is
[1:17:53] the starting place of the template for
[1:17:55] overcoming. Christ crucified. Okay? If
[1:17:59] we die with him and we must, then we'll
[1:18:02] raise with him and we must. But we've
[1:18:04] got to die so we can raise.
[1:18:07] Amen. You got to start the play the way
[1:18:08] that he started. And then Paul says,
[1:18:10] "And I was with you in weakness and in
[1:18:13] fear and in much trembling." Now listen
[1:18:16] to what brother says. He says, "Listen
[1:18:18] to him. Could you imagine a man, a
[1:18:20] Pharisee of the Pharisees, a teacher of
[1:18:21] the teachers, a man that was trained
[1:18:23] from childhood for their ministry to be
[1:18:25] an eloquent man that was smart and
[1:18:27] brilliant to come before a class of
[1:18:29] people like the Corinthians." What were
[1:18:31] the Corinthians? Spiritual nobodies,
[1:18:34] crude, lewd, and unschooled.
[1:18:38] They had nothing on Paul, nothing to
[1:18:42] compare. He says, and he said, "Come to
[1:18:44] a class of people like the Corinthians
[1:18:46] and say, I was with you in weakness and
[1:18:48] in fear and in much trembling." He said,
[1:18:50] "A man who turned the world,
[1:18:57] we can get the next one. The man who
[1:18:58] turned the world upside down, the
[1:19:01] greatest missionary that's ever been
[1:19:02] known, confessed that he came in
[1:19:04] weakness, not as a trained scholar, but
[1:19:07] in weakness and in fear, lest he would
[1:19:09] step off the path somewhere in much
[1:19:11] trembling. He says, because he could not
[1:19:14] trust in his own ability.
[1:19:16] Where had Paul's ability taken him
[1:19:18] before? Antichrist.
[1:19:21] Paul's ability, Paul's wisdom, Paul's
[1:19:23] knowledge, Paul's training, Paul's
[1:19:24] education, Paul's position took him
[1:19:26] contrary to Christ the word. So he says,
[1:19:30] I come to you in weakness and in fear
[1:19:32] and trembling because I got to make sure
[1:19:34] that that doesn't happen again.
[1:19:37] He says the reason he was fearing not
[1:19:39] because he was scared of anything, but
[1:19:41] because he was scared he would displease
[1:19:43] God in some way. That he get his own
[1:19:46] ability mixed up into it. Something that
[1:19:48] he had learned. He was telling them that
[1:19:51] I didn't come to you with these e this
[1:19:52] excellency of speech. He said I came to
[1:19:54] you in fear that I would come that way.
[1:19:58] That's a great trap for a preacher. I'm
[1:20:00] going to wow them into the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:03] I'm going to preach them into an
[1:20:04] experience. You can't do it. You can't
[1:20:07] do it.
[1:20:09] He said, "And I come to you knowing
[1:20:11] nothing but Christ and him crucified.
[1:20:13] And I come to you in fear and weakness
[1:20:14] and in much trembling." He says, "Listen
[1:20:16] to this man who was a warrior that had
[1:20:20] stripped himself." He says, "Amen. If
[1:20:23] there's anything our schools need today,
[1:20:25] if it's anything our churches need today
[1:20:26] is a stripping of themselves, not
[1:20:28] clothes. That's what they're doing. A
[1:20:30] stripping of themselves." Amen. Of your
[1:20:32] own thoughts and your own abilities.
[1:20:35] Strip yourselves before God. Unless you
[1:20:37] would try to do something within
[1:20:40] yourselves. He says, "I hope that gets
[1:20:42] down deep to us that you realize you've
[1:20:44] got to become nothing. Not a
[1:20:46] know-it-all, not a great somebody, but a
[1:20:49] nobody. Lord, help me.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me." He says, "You've got to
[1:20:54] become dust."
[1:20:57] You've got to get to a place that you
[1:21:00] know,
[1:21:02] you know that you're nothing. And don't
[1:21:06] never rise above it. For as soon as you
[1:21:08] rise above it, you rise above God. He
[1:21:11] says, "You've got to keep yourself in
[1:21:12] the dust and on the road to Damascus,
[1:21:15] you've got to keep yourself off your
[1:21:16] high horses."
[1:21:19] Keep yourself off your high horses.
[1:21:22] And that's for everywhere. That's for
[1:21:25] everyone.
[1:21:27] Paul continues. He says, "My speech and
[1:21:28] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:21:30] of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of
[1:21:32] the spirit and of power that your faith
[1:21:36] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:21:38] wisdom of man, but in the power of God."
[1:21:40] Why? Because Christ crucified is greater
[1:21:42] than the wisdom of man. If you follow
[1:21:45] his way, that's better than anything I
[1:21:46] could ever preach to you or tell you. He
[1:21:49] says, "My speech wasn't in the enticing
[1:21:51] words of man and men's wisdom, but in
[1:21:52] the demonstration of the spirit of
[1:21:54] power." Now watch what for, Paul. Why
[1:21:57] did you do this? He says, "Power
[1:22:00] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:22:02] wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
[1:22:04] He says, "Oh, what a preacher. This
[1:22:06] great man who sought God." And he said,
[1:22:08] "God, I am weak and I don't know what to
[1:22:11] do. I just pray you, God, to strengthen
[1:22:13] me and take my infirmities away from me
[1:22:16] and these things so I can be stronger."
[1:22:21] Come on, we all want it. Lord, make me
[1:22:24] stronger. Lord, take away this besetting
[1:22:26] sin. Lord, take away this thing that
[1:22:28] keeps bugging me. Lord, heal me. Lord,
[1:22:31] change me. Lord, deliver me. Hey, we've
[1:22:32] got a promise for all of it, church, but
[1:22:34] we've also got a time for it. Amen.
[1:22:37] There's a time and a season for every
[1:22:38] promise in the book. He says, God spoke
[1:22:42] back to him. Said, Paul, my strength is
[1:22:45] made perfect in your weakness.
[1:22:48] And then Paul said, when I am weak, then
[1:22:50] I am strong. Yes. He said, "Then I'll
[1:22:52] glory in my infirmities, of my
[1:22:53] weaknesses, and so forth." I'm thanking
[1:22:56] God that I got all of it out of me. He
[1:22:59] says, "And when I get everything out of
[1:23:00] me, then God can come in. But as long as
[1:23:03] I have some of myself there, then God
[1:23:05] can't get in."
[1:23:08] This is the template church. Get out so
[1:23:11] he can get in. He says, "There, that's
[1:23:14] it. We smother him out."
[1:23:18] Why? by insisting on our strength so we
[1:23:22] can control
[1:23:24] so we can be strong.
[1:23:26] So we can stand on our own two feet.
[1:23:31] He says we drive him away from the
[1:23:32] poorest of us to the richest of us. From
[1:23:34] the least to the greatest, we keep God
[1:23:36] out of our lives because of who?
[1:23:40] Satan.
[1:23:43] Demons, powers of hell.
[1:23:46] We keep him out of our lives because of
[1:23:49] this guy, our own selves.
[1:23:52] I've often said, "The greatest enemy I
[1:23:54] got is myself." He said, "William
[1:23:55] Brandham." I took it and put it in
[1:23:57] myself just so we could identify this
[1:23:58] morning. He says, "The greatest enemy I
[1:24:00] got is William Brandham." The prophet of
[1:24:02] the age said, "The greatest enemy I have
[1:24:04] is not Satan, it's me."
[1:24:07] You know why we're calling it the first
[1:24:08] enemy this morning, church? Because
[1:24:11] we're blaming too many things on an
[1:24:13] enemy that has no power over us.
[1:24:19] He said, "He's the one who, William
[1:24:21] Brandon." Me. I'm the one that gets in
[1:24:23] God's way. I'm the one that gets lazy.
[1:24:25] I'm the one that gets to a place where I
[1:24:27] think I can do something about it. And
[1:24:29] when I do that, that shoves God right
[1:24:31] out of the picture. He said, "He, but I
[1:24:33] put me in there. I'm putting all of us
[1:24:36] in there." He says, "But when I can get
[1:24:39] rid of that guy, when I can get rid of
[1:24:41] that girl, when I can get to a place
[1:24:43] where he or she is out of the way, then
[1:24:46] God can come over and do things that I
[1:24:49] know nothing about, that I can't even
[1:24:52] conceive that could be done through me
[1:24:55] or with me." Hallelujah.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Eye has not seen nor ear heard the
[1:25:00] things that God has prepared for us. Not
[1:25:02] only there, but right here.
[1:25:05] When you look at the great heroes of the
[1:25:07] faith, can you imagine they thought that
[1:25:10] they would do what they would do? Do you
[1:25:12] think Joshua ever thought, "One day I'm
[1:25:13] going to speak to the sun and the moon
[1:25:15] and they will stand still at my
[1:25:17] command."
[1:25:20] No.
[1:25:22] But he did it.
[1:25:24] He says, "When I can get rid of that
[1:25:26] guy, when I can get to a place where
[1:25:27] he's out of the way, then God can come
[1:25:29] over and do things that I know nothing
[1:25:31] about." That's when God can use you.
[1:25:34] That's when he can use any of you. Not
[1:25:35] just the preachers, not just the men. He
[1:25:38] can use anybody when we get out of the
[1:25:41] way. But as long as we got ourselves in
[1:25:44] the way, then we cannot. So what's the
[1:25:46] problem? We get in the way. What does
[1:25:49] getting in the way look like? This is
[1:25:50] what I asked myself when I was studying
[1:25:52] this. What are what are the symptoms or
[1:25:54] what does it look like when we get in
[1:25:55] the way? When we've got a plan and we
[1:25:58] refuse to change it. That's when we get
[1:26:00] in the way. When we insist on our
[1:26:02] opinion,
[1:26:05] when we devo when we voice our
[1:26:07] discernment of every situation,
[1:26:12] when we insist on our ideas,
[1:26:15] when we insist on our timeline,
[1:26:18] when we decide we're going to make it
[1:26:21] happen.
[1:26:24] Now, that's that's the actual being in
[1:26:26] the way. But what are the symptoms of
[1:26:28] that? You ought to know the easiest one.
[1:26:31] I have a master in this. Frustration.
[1:26:35] Frustration is the hallmark of
[1:26:38] self-will.
[1:26:40] You know why? You know why you're
[1:26:42] frustrated? Is because it's not going
[1:26:44] your way. Because you don't have what
[1:26:47] you want. Because somebody didn't want
[1:26:49] somebody didn't do what you said they
[1:26:51] should do. Your opinion wasn't the one
[1:26:54] that was taken. Your way wasn't the way
[1:26:56] that was chosen. It didn't happen in the
[1:26:59] timeline that you set. And what happens?
[1:27:01] We get frustrated. We get annoyed. We
[1:27:04] get angry at God.
[1:27:07] We get depressed.
[1:27:09] We back away. These are all symptoms of
[1:27:12] the me monster
[1:27:14] because it didn't go our way. It didn't
[1:27:16] meet our expectations. It didn't flow
[1:27:18] through the way that we thought it was
[1:27:20] going to happen. And so when it doesn't
[1:27:22] happen, then we get mad. We get
[1:27:23] frustrated. We don't like the response.
[1:27:25] And we did all we could do and it didn't
[1:27:27] happen.
[1:27:31] And what do we do? We get mad,
[1:27:34] frustrated, annoyed, disappointed,
[1:27:36] depressed, hurt, offended.
[1:27:40] Let's take it a step further.
[1:27:43] Look at what Paul dealt with.
[1:27:46] I won't do it because I'm too weak.
[1:27:50] Paul could have said, "Listen, Lord, you
[1:27:52] won't heal my eyes. Guess what? I ain't
[1:27:54] going to write your books.
[1:27:57] get somebody else to write them. Paul
[1:27:59] had an issue with his eyes. Ever since
[1:28:01] his experience, he had an issue with his
[1:28:04] eyes.
[1:28:06] And God said, "No, no, no, no. My
[1:28:09] strength is perfect in your weakness."
[1:28:12] Paul had every right to say, "God, pick
[1:28:14] somebody that's got good eyes so they
[1:28:16] can sit there and write by candle light
[1:28:18] in the small letters.
[1:28:20] Pick somebody else." But remember that
[1:28:22] old saying, "God doesn't call the
[1:28:24] equipped. God equips the called.
[1:28:29] God gives you what you need. God doesn't
[1:28:30] pick you because you have what he needs.
[1:28:33] Amen. What was it that equipped Paul?
[1:28:39] Grace.
[1:28:40] Grace.
[1:28:43] Paul probably took 10 times as long to
[1:28:45] write his letters when he wrote them.
[1:28:50] Lord, if you would only take away this
[1:28:53] issue with my eyes, I'd be so much
[1:28:54] faster. I'd be so much better.
[1:28:57] My grace is sufficient for thee. You'll
[1:29:01] still get there, Paul. You'll still get
[1:29:03] it done. My strength is perfected in
[1:29:07] your weakness. Amen.
[1:29:11] The Lord had me write this one down for
[1:29:13] me.
[1:29:16] Getting in his way. You won't try
[1:29:19] because you might fail.
[1:29:24] You won't try because you might fail.
[1:29:27] God has had to deal with this in me.
[1:29:29] He's continuing to break me of it. You
[1:29:30] talk about pride, church, this is pride.
[1:29:33] This is pride in its rawest form. I
[1:29:35] won't do something that might make me
[1:29:38] look bad.
[1:29:42] I might fail.
[1:29:45] My testimony might fail. This facade
[1:29:47] that I've built up over decades might
[1:29:49] crack. that somebody might see, I'm not
[1:29:52] as perfect as I've made myself out to
[1:29:53] be. And what is it? We forget we are his
[1:29:57] body. We are not our own. We're bought
[1:29:59] with a price. We are his hands. We're
[1:30:02] his feet. Amen. The actions are by his
[1:30:05] will and the results are by his power.
[1:30:08] It has nothing to do with me. I'm just
[1:30:10] doing it. I love what uh brother Daryl
[1:30:12] Ward said one time. He said, "I'm not
[1:30:14] responsible for healing the people. I'm
[1:30:16] responsible for praying the prayer of
[1:30:18] faith."
[1:30:19] See, too often what happen is we attach
[1:30:21] ourselves personally to the results and
[1:30:24] the results are up to God. Try being a
[1:30:27] pastor sometime. You can get real worked
[1:30:30] up because the results don't happen when
[1:30:31] you think they should. You can preach to
[1:30:33] the people bold-faced straight. They'll
[1:30:36] come up to you, say, "That was
[1:30:37] wonderful." And walk out and do the
[1:30:38] opposite. And you can get personally
[1:30:41] attached to that.
[1:30:43] We get so personally attached to it.
[1:30:45] church, we ought to take it personally,
[1:30:46] as in it ought to mean something to us.
[1:30:48] But the results are in his hands and in
[1:30:50] his time and by his power. It's not in
[1:30:52] our doing we get results. It's by doing
[1:30:55] his will that we get results or not as
[1:30:58] the case may be. Amen. We forget the
[1:31:01] personal part is our relationship,
[1:31:04] not the results of everything else. The
[1:31:06] personal part is our relationship with
[1:31:08] God, not in what we see happening or
[1:31:10] what we don't see happening as the case
[1:31:11] may be. Look at what Jesus said to his
[1:31:14] ser to his disciples. He said, "But he
[1:31:15] that is greatest among you shall be your
[1:31:18] servant." That word servant, brother
[1:31:19] Matt means deacon. Brother Joah means
[1:31:22] deacon. And brother John and brother
[1:31:23] Grant means minister.
[1:31:26] So we look at that and if we were to
[1:31:27] pick the hierarchy of the church say
[1:31:30] bear with me in my foolishness. Who's
[1:31:32] the greatest in the church?
[1:31:35] The pastor. I'm not saying that of
[1:31:37] myself. That's what we'd say. The the
[1:31:38] hierarchy of the church is the pastors
[1:31:40] up high. Who comes right under that? The
[1:31:42] ministry. And then right under that is
[1:31:44] the deacons because they're the the
[1:31:45] spiritual policemen of the church. And
[1:31:47] what does Jesus say about us? They are
[1:31:49] your servants. They're at the bottom,
[1:31:52] not at the top. We're not here to be
[1:31:54] served. We're here to serve. The very
[1:31:58] word minister means servant. Amen. He
[1:32:02] says, "And whosoever shall exalt himself
[1:32:04] shall be abased, and he that shall
[1:32:06] humble himself shall be exalted." We're
[1:32:09] talking about the first enemy here. And
[1:32:10] we see that the great enemy is self-will
[1:32:12] and pride. That's the simple truth of
[1:32:14] this. Amen. It's our own estimation of
[1:32:16] our skills, of our gifts, of our ideas,
[1:32:18] our intellects, our strengths,
[1:32:20] education, whatever it might be. And we
[1:32:22] forget one thing. The comparison isn't
[1:32:24] here. The comparison is here.
[1:32:28] Listen, I may be more educated than some
[1:32:30] of you. Brother Kingsley is more
[1:32:31] educated than all of us. You know what
[1:32:33] that means, brother Kingsley?
[1:32:34] Unfortunately,
[1:32:36] zero.
[1:32:37] Brother Grant's about to get his second
[1:32:39] degree for Pete's sake. What does it
[1:32:41] mean, Brother Grant? Nothing. In God's
[1:32:44] eyes, it means nothing. See, we're so
[1:32:45] busy comparing with each other.
[1:32:49] Listen, some of you are better at things
[1:32:50] than I am, and I'm better than you at
[1:32:52] some other things as well. But that has
[1:32:54] nothing to do with it because what in
[1:32:55] comparison to God, we're worthless,
[1:32:57] useless. We just get in his way. Amen.
[1:33:01] That's what dying dying out is all
[1:33:04] about. Is when you say, "Lord, in
[1:33:07] comparison to what you have, I have
[1:33:10] nothing. I am nothing. I bring nothing.
[1:33:13] All I'm bringing is a body for you to
[1:33:16] use." That's how we approach. That's
[1:33:18] what dying out is. Amen. I remember when
[1:33:21] I gave my heart to the Lord and walking
[1:33:22] up. It took 40 45 minutes for me to get
[1:33:25] to the front and to pray and and it was
[1:33:27] a time of repentance. But I knew that I
[1:33:30] was no good. That was a great revelation
[1:33:33] for me.
[1:33:37] You know, I was headed into school. I
[1:33:39] was top of my class. You know, I was a I
[1:33:41] was I was somebody that was seen as to
[1:33:44] probably be very successful.
[1:33:47] It's not that I haven't been. But when I
[1:33:49] got in his presence, I realized I am
[1:33:51] less than nothing.
[1:33:54] I bring nothing to this table.
[1:33:57] Brokenness,
[1:33:58] pride,
[1:34:00] self-will.
[1:34:02] And in his presence, I said, "I am
[1:34:04] unworthy to be here." But I continued on
[1:34:07] for one reason. He bid me come. He bid
[1:34:11] me come even as I was. But church, I
[1:34:15] died that day and Christ rose up and I
[1:34:18] became a new creature in him. Amen.
[1:34:20] That's what I experienced that day.
[1:34:21] Amen. Because I laid myself down. Now,
[1:34:24] it's a daily dying. It's a daily
[1:34:26] crucifying. I am by no means a finished
[1:34:28] work. If I was, I'd be of all men most
[1:34:31] miserable. And you would, too. But it's
[1:34:34] a daily work that happens. Amen. But it
[1:34:37] came through a dying out where I
[1:34:38] realized with all my intellect, with all
[1:34:41] my ideas, with all my discernment.
[1:34:44] I'm nothing. I have nothing. And that's
[1:34:46] why I needed Christ. That's the great
[1:34:49] revelation is I have need of him. And he
[1:34:51] calls me. He says, let's go over to
[1:34:54] Revelation. Jesus said to himself, he
[1:34:56] that overcomemeth, I'll give him the
[1:34:58] morning star. The Bible said, he said,
[1:35:00] what is it? an overcomer.
[1:35:03] One that's overcome the world, overcome
[1:35:06] self, and overcome pride. He says, "I'll
[1:35:11] make him the morning star." What does it
[1:35:13] do? I'll shine him up and set him up
[1:35:15] there that I by my owning power will
[1:35:18] reflect my own presence in the darkness.
[1:35:20] He that overcomes will I give the
[1:35:22] morning star. He says, "What's the
[1:35:23] morning star set there for?" He says,
[1:35:25] "To reflect the sun coming." What's the
[1:35:28] morning star? It's the sun shining
[1:35:30] against it reflecting the presence of
[1:35:31] the coming of the son. It's the
[1:35:33] brightest thing in heaven in darkness.
[1:35:35] He says the brightest thing in heaven
[1:35:37] ought to be today and is today. The
[1:35:40] minister, brother Grant, Brother Gerald
[1:35:44] or the Christian. Everybody else raise
[1:35:47] your hands. Or the Christian or the
[1:35:50] spiritfilled man that is so filled with
[1:35:52] the Holy Spirit till he's forsaken the
[1:35:55] world and everything. And God is
[1:35:57] reflecting his light coming through him,
[1:36:00] warning the world that the approaching s
[1:36:03] is at hand. He says, "Oh, what an hour."
[1:36:04] That is a person that has overcome the
[1:36:06] world, overcome self, and overcome
[1:36:09] pride.
[1:36:12] If you want to see what man can achieve,
[1:36:14] look at the denominational world.
[1:36:17] Look at what they can do. The Catholic
[1:36:19] Church by the numbers is the most
[1:36:21] successful church in history. Most
[1:36:23] successful. over a billion followers,
[1:36:26] untold amounts of wealth, churches in
[1:36:29] every city and every continent.
[1:36:32] And yet they're completely off the word.
[1:36:35] No holiness,
[1:36:38] constantly changing their doctrines,
[1:36:39] constantly changing their positions,
[1:36:42] worshiping men, worshiping saints,
[1:36:45] all these different things. Go start a
[1:36:48] church and preach a gospel of Jesus
[1:36:50] loves you and come as you are and you
[1:36:52] don't ever have to change and watch the
[1:36:53] pews fill up. No problem. Not a problem
[1:36:57] to do it. But the glory of God will
[1:37:00] never grace that building.
[1:37:03] Why? Because they won't preach him. They
[1:37:05] won't preach the full word. That's what
[1:37:07] men produce. You know what God produces?
[1:37:10] a little church of 12 people in Ephesus
[1:37:14] with the prophet of the age as the
[1:37:17] pastor. 12 people.
[1:37:21] That would not be a success. Can you
[1:37:22] imagine if they said, "Paul, we trust
[1:37:25] your great gift. Go to Ephesus and do a
[1:37:27] seed church."
[1:37:29] And Paul goes there and after a year,
[1:37:31] Paul, how many you got? 12. Next year,
[1:37:33] Paul, how many you got? Still 12. Paul,
[1:37:36] we're going to swap you out. You lack.
[1:37:39] your gift is not there.
[1:37:42] See, the world would say that's not a
[1:37:44] success. But Paul had 12 that would stay
[1:37:46] no matter what. He had born again
[1:37:48] believers, not church members. He was a
[1:37:52] success nonetheless. Paul said at the
[1:37:54] end of his life, he said, "I have fought
[1:37:56] a good fight.
[1:37:57] I have finished my course." That wasn't
[1:38:01] Paul speaking. That was the Holy Spirit
[1:38:02] speaking through Paul. That was
[1:38:03] confirming to Paul, "Hey, you've done
[1:38:05] what I told you to do." He says, "I have
[1:38:08] kept the faith. Henceforth there's laid
[1:38:09] up for me for me a crown of
[1:38:11] righteousness which the Lord of the
[1:38:13] right the righteous judge shall give me
[1:38:14] at that day." Why? Because Paul came in
[1:38:17] weakness and fear and trembling and kept
[1:38:20] himself out of the way so that the power
[1:38:22] of God could demonstrate itself through
[1:38:24] his life. Paul got himself out of the
[1:38:27] way. Paul died out. Paul laid himself
[1:38:30] down. Paul could have come in power and
[1:38:33] training. And this is what the Greek
[1:38:35] says and this is what the Hebrew says.
[1:38:37] And if you compare these two and you did
[1:38:38] it. No, no, no. He never did that. He
[1:38:40] came in power and demonstration of the
[1:38:42] spirit. This is what God is, not what
[1:38:46] Paul is.
[1:38:47] And that's how the power of God worked
[1:38:49] through him. Brother Brown would say
[1:38:50] this. He says, "And God can only operate
[1:38:52] as we let him operate." You know, people
[1:38:55] want power and really they don't know
[1:38:57] what power is. See, they really don't
[1:38:59] know what goes with it. He said, "The
[1:39:02] way up is down always.
[1:39:05] If you want power, see how humble you
[1:39:08] can get."
[1:39:11] I got to knock down the Empire State
[1:39:13] Building. Lord, give me power. Get ready
[1:39:15] to lay down. He says, "Just get away
[1:39:18] from all your worldly thinking and
[1:39:20] humble yourself before God. And then
[1:39:22] you've got more power than that man that
[1:39:24] runs all over the building and makes a
[1:39:26] big lot of noise." to see because you
[1:39:28] have been able to conquer who
[1:39:33] yourself.
[1:39:36] We've got to see the enemy within
[1:39:39] that lurks no matter what. Even with the
[1:39:41] Holy Ghost, he's still there trying to
[1:39:45] gain the upper hand. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:49] Absolutely he is.
[1:39:51] He says, "You've been able to conquer
[1:39:54] yourself, the first enemy, and commit
[1:39:57] yourself to Christ." How do you
[1:39:59] overcome? Commit yourself to Christ.
[1:40:02] Take your hands off the steering wheel.
[1:40:04] He says, "You see, to humble yourself
[1:40:06] before him." He says, "That's really
[1:40:09] power." He says, "You show me a church
[1:40:12] that's humble, real humble, not
[1:40:15] arrogant.
[1:40:17] A church, just a sweet, humble church.
[1:40:20] I'll show you a church that has the
[1:40:22] favor and power of God in it. That's
[1:40:24] right. He says that's the thing it
[1:40:26] takes. Humility, humbling ourselves
[1:40:29] before God, letting God just work
[1:40:32] through us. He says, don't have to make
[1:40:36] a lot of noise.
[1:40:38] What does that look like, church? What
[1:40:40] does that humbling look like? Laying
[1:40:43] yourself willingly, taking the fall
[1:40:47] for the sake of victory.
[1:40:50] letting go and letting God have his way.
[1:40:52] That's the song we always sing, isn't
[1:40:53] it? Let go and let God have his
[1:40:55] wonderful way.
[1:40:58] We're talking about the first enemy. But
[1:41:00] I want you to see it's a domino effect.
[1:41:02] That geometric growth that we talked
[1:41:04] about starts with you and I laying
[1:41:07] ourselves down.
[1:41:10] Not my will, but thine be done. Someone
[1:41:13] has to fall first. Someone's got to go
[1:41:16] first. Isn't that the hardest thing is
[1:41:18] to be the first one? I I appreciate this
[1:41:20] about my children. Some of them, they
[1:41:23] love to go first. This this this master
[1:41:26] of perfection will never go first. He'll
[1:41:29] let them go, make the mistakes, see how
[1:41:31] to do it better, and then beat them at
[1:41:33] it,
[1:41:34] right? That's the self. That's the
[1:41:36] flesh. I'll let other people go first so
[1:41:38] I can learn from their mistakes because
[1:41:40] I don't want to make a mistake. Because
[1:41:42] I want to be perfect. I want to be
[1:41:45] better than you. This is the flesh
[1:41:46] speaking, right?
[1:41:48] But I've got kids that'll they're like,
[1:41:50] "I want to go first." They're
[1:41:51] practically beating you off to try and
[1:41:52] go first because they want what it
[1:41:55] offers more than they want to look good.
[1:41:58] They want to have the benefit of it.
[1:41:59] They want to have the experience of it
[1:42:01] more than they care about how it looks
[1:42:02] to everybody else. They're so enthused
[1:42:05] about it. They're so excited about
[1:42:06] what's coming if they can only get this
[1:42:08] figured out that they don't care what
[1:42:10] everybody else thinks about them failing
[1:42:11] or not doing it perfectly the first
[1:42:13] time.
[1:42:15] This first victory is victory over self,
[1:42:17] letting go, letting God have his way. We
[1:42:20] look for great victories. We're looking
[1:42:21] for great victories. We're looking for
[1:42:24] great testimonies. We're looking for the
[1:42:26] signs and wonders of God that he would
[1:42:28] do in our midst. We're looking for
[1:42:30] deliverance. We're looking for
[1:42:31] salvation. I long for the day when
[1:42:34] Sharon walks through that door, Sister
[1:42:35] Betty. When Martha and Anna and David,
[1:42:39] Jenna, these different ones,
[1:42:42] my can you imagine if somebody from
[1:42:44] brother brother Vicel's church walked
[1:42:45] through those doors from his family, I
[1:42:47] should say,
[1:42:49] we wouldn't know what to do.
[1:42:52] Somebody's got to fall first.
[1:42:55] Victory comes with a humbling, a laying
[1:42:58] down of self. Amen.
[1:43:02] We let go of that attachment.
[1:43:05] Image is the big enemy.
[1:43:08] Image is the big enemy. You know why we
[1:43:10] don't repent? Because we've kept it on
[1:43:13] so long that we're perfect.
[1:43:16] You know why we don't share things
[1:43:18] honestly with people?
[1:43:20] Because we're too attached to what they
[1:43:22] think about us.
[1:43:24] Tell you what, you be honest with a
[1:43:26] brother or sister one time, they'll
[1:43:27] think more of you than they ever thought
[1:43:28] of you before. Paul said, "Confess your
[1:43:30] faults one to another." You know why
[1:43:32] that we do that? keeps us humble, keeps
[1:43:36] it real. You know why I share my
[1:43:38] struggles and the things that God's had
[1:43:40] to do with me over this pulpit? So that
[1:43:41] you know, you can come tell me anything
[1:43:43] and I'm not going to judge you for it.
[1:43:45] I've had people tell me some pretty
[1:43:47] awful things. And you know what? It
[1:43:50] matters not to me.
[1:43:52] Tell you what, I've dealt with most of
[1:43:53] them. Not all of them, but most of them.
[1:43:57] That's why I do it. Because if I can be
[1:43:59] honest before you, you know, you can
[1:44:01] certainly be honest before God. And we
[1:44:04] ought to be able to be honest with one
[1:44:05] another. Amen.
[1:44:08] We die out and we trust that the God who
[1:44:11] starts the work
[1:44:13] will finish it. Remember what brother
[1:44:15] says. Scripture says it. Everywhere that
[1:44:17] the soul of your foot shall tread, it
[1:44:19] belongs to you. Brother said, "Footsteps
[1:44:21] is possession."
[1:44:23] What was the first place that their foot
[1:44:26] crossed
[1:44:27] when they went into Canaan? Jordan.
[1:44:31] Death.
[1:44:33] dying out.
[1:44:35] They had to die out before they could
[1:44:38] overcome.
[1:44:40] What did they do? They went and it was a
[1:44:41] it was a type of baptism. It was a type
[1:44:43] of dying out. They went, they died out
[1:44:46] and then they rose. They came up and
[1:44:47] what did they do? They sanctified
[1:44:49] themselves a new. They circumcised
[1:44:50] themselves. Remember? And then only
[1:44:53] after that could they go in and take
[1:44:55] over Jericho. Amen.
[1:44:58] That's the first step. Dying out. The
[1:45:01] first step of victory you can take is to
[1:45:03] die out. That's why we baptize you. Your
[1:45:06] baptism isn't a dying out. It's a symbol
[1:45:08] of what's supposed to have happened
[1:45:09] internally. That you have died out. And
[1:45:11] when you come up, it's a sign that
[1:45:13] you've risen a new in Christ. And you no
[1:45:15] longer exist. And it's Christ that's
[1:45:17] living through you now. It's Christ
[1:45:19] that's got the victory. And there's a
[1:45:21] price to pay in that. Is there a price
[1:45:23] to pay? There's a price to pay.
[1:45:26] Absolutely there is. It's not easy to
[1:45:28] die out. It can be humiliating.
[1:45:30] It can be humbling.
[1:45:33] It can hurt. It's certainly tough on the
[1:45:35] ego. Brutal on the pride. Pride and and
[1:45:39] humility cannot exist simultaneously.
[1:45:41] They're contrary to one another. Amen.
[1:45:44] And sometimes the reason we're not
[1:45:45] winning is we don't want to pay that
[1:45:47] price.
[1:45:48] We're so stuck on I'm going to make it
[1:45:51] happen.
[1:45:52] I can do it. I can stand. If you're very
[1:45:56] heavily disciplined, you have a lot of
[1:45:58] natural strength. That's the reason we
[1:46:00] don't overcome is because we think we've
[1:46:01] got enough to make it through. We don't.
[1:46:03] That's why we need Christ. Amen.
[1:46:07] But the thing is, what happens? You say,
[1:46:09] "I can knock down the next domino." Can
[1:46:12] you knock down the Empire State
[1:46:13] Building? Because that's what you have
[1:46:14] to knock down. Death is the final
[1:46:16] victory.
[1:46:18] Anybody here think they can knock over
[1:46:19] death?
[1:46:24] Brother Grant's wanting to say yes.
[1:46:28] I can run through a troop and leap over
[1:46:29] a wall.
[1:46:31] When I get there, I'll be ready. Amen.
[1:46:35] But for now, what matters is what stands
[1:46:37] in front of me. And if I think I can do
[1:46:40] it on my own, you know what God does? He
[1:46:42] just lets them get bigger and bigger and
[1:46:45] bigger until I finally say, "I can't
[1:46:46] make that one fall. It's too much."
[1:46:49] Then I start to say, "Is there somebody
[1:46:51] here that can knock this thing over?"
[1:46:55] And what does he say? Let me start with
[1:46:56] you, son. Let me take you down a peg.
[1:47:00] Let me lay you down. Let me use you
[1:47:04] so that you can get the victory.
[1:47:08] He's got to have victory in us before he
[1:47:10] can get victory in front of us. That's
[1:47:12] what he's trying to do. This is the
[1:47:14] scripture we started with. And as we
[1:47:15] close this morning, then said Jesus unto
[1:47:18] his disciples, "If any man will come
[1:47:20] after me, let him deny who?" Himself
[1:47:24] and take up his cross.
[1:47:28] You got to crucify the flesh daily.
[1:47:31] Take up his cross and follow me. Deny
[1:47:34] who? Satan. I told Satan to get behind.
[1:47:37] We sing that song, Victory is mine. I
[1:47:39] told Satan to get behind. You know what
[1:47:40] we need to do? I told myself, get
[1:47:42] behind.
[1:47:44] That's really what we're talking about.
[1:47:45] It's not the world and Satan we need to
[1:47:46] worry about. It's self. It's self that
[1:47:48] gets in the way. Amen. The overcoming
[1:47:50] position, the starting position is deny
[1:47:53] yourself. Let Christ have full control
[1:47:55] of your life. And then when you die out,
[1:47:57] he can live through you and do things
[1:47:59] that you could never do before. Give you
[1:48:01] victories you could never have before.
[1:48:02] Amen. We want so many victories and we
[1:48:05] resist the one that he wants, which is
[1:48:08] victory over you.
[1:48:11] That's the great victory that he wants.
[1:48:13] That first enemy we've got to defeat is
[1:48:15] the toughest one because he likes to
[1:48:16] bounce up. She likes to bounce up every
[1:48:19] day.
[1:48:22] The flesh
[1:48:24] has to be changed.
[1:48:27] But we have a daily victory we're
[1:48:28] supposed to be getting over it. Amen.
[1:48:30] Itself, it's pride attached to it. And
[1:48:32] I'll tell you this, it doesn't want to
[1:48:34] go through that processing that that
[1:48:36] refining process that God puts us
[1:48:38] through. It hates it. That's the price
[1:48:40] we have to pay. I'm going to close with
[1:48:42] these three quotes.
[1:48:45] He's talking about Samson. He says,
[1:48:46] "They're not willing to pay the price."
[1:48:49] Samson prayed, right? What did he pray?
[1:48:51] Lord, let me die with the enemy. He
[1:48:55] says, "That's the trouble. They don't
[1:48:56] want to pay the price of dying. You've
[1:49:00] got your own self worked up into a
[1:49:02] community, into a bunch of people that
[1:49:04] you associate with and play cards, stay
[1:49:06] home, watch programs, eat chips, and
[1:49:07] drink Cokes." He's not talking about
[1:49:08] you, Sister Mory.
[1:49:13] The church sits empty. That's why I can
[1:49:16] say that the church is not empty. She's
[1:49:17] here. Chips and Cokes are her her
[1:49:20] kryptonite. If any of you know Sister
[1:49:22] Moren,
[1:49:23] the church sits empty. That's right. He
[1:49:25] says, "Make you sign a card and you'll
[1:49:26] come six months out of the year to
[1:49:28] Sunday school." What? Churchity
[1:49:31] membership.
[1:49:34] He says, "Such man-made enthusiasm.
[1:49:38] What you need is the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:49:42] what dying out really does, church. It
[1:49:43] brings the Holy Ghost on the scene. He
[1:49:46] says, "Oh, you say I got it." He says,
[1:49:48] "You sure don't act like it." Yes, sir.
[1:49:50] Let the preacher preach an hour or
[1:49:52] something or something or another like
[1:49:54] that, you're ready to call the trustee
[1:49:55] board and throw him out. Praise the
[1:49:57] Lord. Not in this church. It would have
[1:49:58] happened a long time ago, wouldn't it,
[1:49:59] Brother Gerald?
[1:50:02] Amen. I don't think I can count on one
[1:50:03] hand the number of times Brother Giller
[1:50:05] preached under an hour.
[1:50:07] And if if it was, it was because he felt
[1:50:09] the spirit wasn't moving.
[1:50:12] Some of the most glorious services for
[1:50:13] the young people.
[1:50:16] Just get us out. But he's sure changed
[1:50:18] us, hasn't he, brothers and sisters? Now
[1:50:21] we can't get enough.
[1:50:23] That's what the Holy Ghost will do. He
[1:50:26] says that's right. Oh, you want to eat
[1:50:27] your cake and keep it, too.
[1:50:31] Isn't that the truth, church? We want to
[1:50:33] have everything our way plus everything
[1:50:36] his way. We want to do everything our
[1:50:38] way and get all of his blessings. That's
[1:50:41] having your cake and eating it, too. He
[1:50:43] says, "Can't do that."
[1:50:47] You know, they have in the in industrial
[1:50:50] environments, they have that that siren
[1:50:52] that goes off and it's meant to get your
[1:50:53] attention.
[1:50:55] That's what Brother Brad's doing here.
[1:50:57] You want to eat your cake and keep it
[1:50:58] too?
[1:51:00] Can't have it. He says, "No, sir. You've
[1:51:03] got to surrender yourself. You've got a
[1:51:06] price to pay. You've got a cleaning up
[1:51:09] to do.
[1:51:11] He says, "And I'll tell you, the whole
[1:51:13] church world needs a cleaning all the
[1:51:15] way from the pulpit to the janitor's
[1:51:17] room." That's right. He says, "It's the
[1:51:19] truth." Not willing to pay. But Samson
[1:51:21] prayed right when he said, "Lord, let me
[1:51:23] die with these Philistines." He had
[1:51:26] failed, but he said, "Let me die." He
[1:51:28] said, "You must be ready to die to the
[1:51:31] enemy that's got the victory over you.
[1:51:34] You must be willing to surrender your
[1:51:37] own ideas.
[1:51:41] He said Samson was willing to to pay the
[1:51:44] price to get the power of God again.
[1:51:49] What's got our victory so many times?
[1:51:52] This thing, this mind.
[1:51:55] That's where we think the victory is.
[1:51:56] We've got our way set up of how this is
[1:51:58] going to play out. And God laughs.
[1:52:02] and he just sits back and he says,"All
[1:52:03] right,
[1:52:05] go ahead. Do it. See where it gets you."
[1:52:09] And all it does is get us brokenness and
[1:52:11] frustration and annoyance and hurt and
[1:52:14] separation and despair
[1:52:18] and humility if you're a child of God.
[1:52:21] And then we comely crawling back.
[1:52:24] Lord, I'm really sorry I did it again.
[1:52:29] Can we do it your way now?
[1:52:32] Can we do it your way now? What was
[1:52:33] Samson's problem? Sam Samson's problem
[1:52:36] was he thought he could do anything he
[1:52:38] wanted to do and the spirit of God would
[1:52:40] always come on the scene.
[1:52:42] But you know what? He was under a
[1:52:45] covenant that required him to do
[1:52:47] something.
[1:52:48] Keep his hair from being cut. And for
[1:52:52] the sake of personal and fleshly
[1:52:55] satisfaction, he let his hair get cut.
[1:53:00] Did you ever notice what led him to do
[1:53:02] it? Frustration.
[1:53:05] He got so annoyed with Delilah's
[1:53:09] constant badgery.
[1:53:13] That's what our own way does, church.
[1:53:16] Gets us frustrated.
[1:53:18] You know, usually we're most frustrated
[1:53:20] with this guy. We're frustrated. We're
[1:53:24] frustrated.
[1:53:25] And it's just our own thinking. It's
[1:53:26] just our own way that we've drawn things
[1:53:28] so much and we've wound a net so tight
[1:53:31] of our own way and our own thinking and
[1:53:34] our own plan and our own timeline that
[1:53:36] when it doesn't go that way, we're just
[1:53:37] a bundle of frustration.
[1:53:43] Let go.
[1:53:45] Let go.
[1:53:47] Samson presumed
[1:53:50] that his way was God's way and it
[1:53:53] wasn't. And he lost out. And what
[1:53:56] happened was he awoke and he says, "I
[1:53:58] will go out as I have every other time."
[1:54:01] And you know what happened? He didn't.
[1:54:03] He went out, but not the way he always
[1:54:05] went out. The spirit of God was not
[1:54:07] there. He'd broken his covenant. And so
[1:54:09] they took him, they put his eyes out,
[1:54:11] they put him on a gr on a on a mill to
[1:54:13] to grind the wheat and whatnot. But what
[1:54:16] they forgot was where his power was, his
[1:54:19] covenant was. And in those years of
[1:54:22] grinding that mill, his hair grew back.
[1:54:25] And when they finally brought him out,
[1:54:27] Samson said, 'Lord, give me one more
[1:54:29] victory. Give me one more victory.
[1:54:33] And he had strength and he pulled down
[1:54:34] that temple. And I think there was over
[1:54:36] 3,000 Philistines killed that day. His
[1:54:38] final victory was his greatest victory.
[1:54:40] But he sacrificed with them. But
[1:54:42] remember church, he's under a
[1:54:43] conditional covenant.
[1:54:45] Let me tell you tonight, today, I
[1:54:47] haven't preached that long.
[1:54:49] You're under an unconditional covenant.
[1:54:53] You can't lose.
[1:54:55] You can lose temporarily.
[1:54:58] Hey, you can lose temporarily, but
[1:55:01] there's always victory ahead.
[1:55:04] You just got to come back and lay
[1:55:06] yourself down. Come back. Lay yourself
[1:55:10] down. That's it. That's all God's
[1:55:13] looking for.
[1:55:16] God honors his word. And when you come
[1:55:18] back and say, "Lord, I'm willing to do
[1:55:19] it your way.
[1:55:21] I'm willing to take your template
[1:55:23] instead of mine. That's when he can
[1:55:25] honor it. Amen.
[1:55:27] We've got to say, Lord, I'm willing to
[1:55:30] die.
[1:55:32] I'm willing to lay down. Parents, isn't
[1:55:34] that what we do? We lay ourselves down
[1:55:36] for each other. We lay ourselves down
[1:55:38] for our kids. We sacrifice.
[1:55:40] God's just asking us to do the same
[1:55:42] thing for him. Lay yourself down and let
[1:55:45] me do something through you. Amen. When
[1:55:47] God places you, when God moves you,
[1:55:50] that's when the dominoes start to fall.
[1:55:52] And that thing you've been staring at
[1:55:54] for years,
[1:56:03] that's it. In a moment, gone.
[1:56:08] That's the way God works.
[1:56:10] Amen. Let's stand together if we would.
[1:56:15] The first enemy,
[1:56:18] the first showdown is between you and
[1:56:20] God.
[1:56:23] And I'll tell you this, church, he never
[1:56:25] stops refining. He never stops working.
[1:56:28] He never stops looking in those doors of
[1:56:30] our life, of our house. And he's
[1:56:33] constantly trying to get us, lay
[1:56:36] yourself down. And what does it become a
[1:56:40] battle of? My will or God's will?
[1:56:44] My way, God's way. My life, eternal
[1:56:48] life,
[1:56:51] personal strength,
[1:56:55] total power,
[1:56:58] defeat,
[1:57:00] victory.
[1:57:02] That's all he's asking us. Make a
[1:57:04] choice. Choose you this day. Amen. And
[1:57:07] that's what it is every single day. It's
[1:57:09] a choice of victory or self. Amen. Let's
[1:57:13] bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:57:20] Lord, I can only say this this morning
[1:57:21] by grace, Lord. How much we need you,
[1:57:26] Lord. When we look at the darkness that
[1:57:27] surrounds us, when we look at the
[1:57:29] onslaught of the enemy,
[1:57:32] Lord, we need you more than we've ever
[1:57:33] needed you, Lord. I need you, Lord.
[1:57:36] Every single person in this congregation
[1:57:38] needs you in a greater way, Lord. Lord,
[1:57:41] and we know that Satan's trying to raise
[1:57:42] up ourselves. He's trying to raise up
[1:57:44] our pride. He's trying to get us to hold
[1:57:45] on to image, Lord. And you're asking us
[1:57:48] to humble ourselves before your word,
[1:57:50] before each other, Lord, so that you can
[1:57:52] pick up this piece and use it for great
[1:57:55] victory.
[1:57:57] Lord, you see our needs. Lord, you see
[1:57:59] that Empire State Building, that 443
[1:58:02] meters
[1:58:04] of power that stands before us, of
[1:58:06] might, of immovability.
[1:58:09] Lord, you see souls that don't seem to
[1:58:11] want to be saved. You see diseases that
[1:58:13] don't seem to want to be moved. You see
[1:58:15] situations that don't seem to want to be
[1:58:17] changed. But Lord, we're standing here
[1:58:19] in faith. Lord, we're standing here in
[1:58:22] humility by your grace and we're saying,
[1:58:25] Lord, we're giving ourselves to you,
[1:58:29] Lord, that you would use us, Lord, that
[1:58:31] you would overcome us, Lord. That
[1:58:33] through us, you could overcome these
[1:58:35] situations we face, Lord. Then in the
[1:58:38] meantime, Lord, that your grace will be
[1:58:41] sufficient every single day, Lord, let
[1:58:45] us not resist, Lord, but let us lay
[1:58:47] ourselves willingly into your hands. We
[1:58:49] pray, Lord, bless this special people,
[1:58:52] we ask, Lord, we've had a showdown this
[1:58:54] morning. Now we're going into a second
[1:58:56] showdown,
[1:58:57] Lord, where we approach the emblems of
[1:59:00] your shed blood and your broken body,
[1:59:02] Lord. And we know there's healing,
[1:59:04] there's deliverance, there's peace,
[1:59:07] there's joy, Lord. Every redemptive
[1:59:09] blessing, Lord, is here today by your
[1:59:12] word and by your presence, Lord. We're
[1:59:14] here to claim them for ourselves and for
[1:59:16] each other, Lord. But let us die out
[1:59:18] this morning. Lord, let us repent. Let
[1:59:22] us humble ourselves, we pray, Lord,
[1:59:25] bless your people now, we ask. In Jesus
[1:59:27] Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[2:05:12] here I [singing] stand.
[2:05:16] Lord, my life [music]
[2:05:20] is in your hands.
[2:05:24] [music] Lord, [singing]
[2:05:25] I long
[2:05:28] you to [music] see
[2:05:32] your [singing]
[2:05:33] desires

[2:06:08] can use.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Giving my life away. 12:32
[2:06:18] I've seen [music and singing] a vision
[2:06:22] harsh and sweet
[2:06:26] of [music] one who gave all he had for
[2:06:31] me.
[2:06:32] [music] And I've seen the pass
[2:06:36] of his death
[2:06:40] and the forgiveness
[2:06:43] of his [music]
[2:06:44] final breath.
[2:06:47] And now I can [music] never
[2:06:50] be the same.
[2:06:55] My heart has been [music]
[2:06:57] forever
[2:07:00] changed.
[2:07:01] [music]
[2:07:02] I want [singing] to live and love and
[2:07:06] [music] give the way he gave.
[2:07:16] So now [music]
[2:07:17] I'm giving my life
[2:07:21] away.
[2:07:23] [music]
[2:07:25] I laid it down on the [singing] altar.
[2:07:31] Now [music] I'm giving my life
[2:07:35] away. [singing]
[2:07:39] [music] The very least I can [singing]
[2:07:43] offer
[2:07:45] [music] is my all.
[2:07:52] Oh, [music] here I stand
[2:07:55] today,
[2:07:58] giving my life [singing and music]
[2:08:00] away.
[2:08:06] No [music and singing] earthly price
[2:08:09] could be too great.
[2:08:13] No sacriice
[2:08:16] too [music and singing] much to make.
[2:08:21] the way of measuring [music]
[2:08:25] the cost
[2:08:28] next [music] to the blood of Calary's
[2:08:33] cross.
[2:08:35] [music] So [singing] if I live, I live
[2:08:40] for him.
[2:08:42] And if [music and singing] I die, I can
[2:08:47] decay.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; My life is not my own, but his
[2:08:55] [music and singing] from this day on.
[2:09:03] So now I'm [music and singing] giving my
[2:09:07] life
[2:09:08] away.
[2:09:12] Oh, I'm laying [music] it down on the
[2:09:15] [singing] altar.
[2:09:18] Now I'm giving my life [music] away.
[2:09:27] The very least I [music] can offer
[2:09:32] is my [singing] all.
[2:09:36] [music]
[2:09:39] So here I stand.
