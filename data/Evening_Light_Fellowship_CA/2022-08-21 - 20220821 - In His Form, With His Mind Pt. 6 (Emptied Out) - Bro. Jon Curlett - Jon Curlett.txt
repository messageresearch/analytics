he's so lord i give my all to amen a song about surrendering surrendering all to christ amen and i really enjoyed both specials they were wonderful but you know many you know many times we hear the term that john the baptist used right he must increase and i must decrease but that applies to us too in my opinion we've got to decrease and get ourselves out of the way and surrender to christ so that he can increase in us amen let's um that's saying uh i give my mind i'm not sure what uh what number that is i give my mind completely to you lord that's our biggest problem is our mind amen let

[Applause] help us [Music] we want to see jesus [Music] and say that we love you [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] we want to see jesus [Music] lord we've come in with open hearts this morning lord we've come in with open minds or with open lives or we're laying ourselves at the foot of the cross or before your throne of mercy lord and we're claiming the blood this morning lord for every sin for every sickness lord for everything that troubles us lord we're claiming the finished work at calvary lord god lord not only for ourselves but lord our brothers and sisters next to us lord for our loved ones that our wayward lord for those in the body of christ around the world that have need of a touch this morning lord lord we're coming before you and asking your goodness and grace once again lord even unto the ministering of the word this morning lord as our brother prayed earlier lord that you would anoint the lips to speak lord and the ears to hear or that they would be in sync with your spirit lord god that we would hear what the spirit is saying to the church in this time lord jesus lord have your way in this people have your way through me this morning lord we ask in jesus christ's name we're praying amen and amen and god bless you if you'll turn the scriptures to philippians chapter 3 thanking musicians as always and then certainly appreciate the specials this morning that was just beautiful i feel like it's uh it's certainly a sacrifice amen it's a sacrifice to come up and lay yourself before the people and before god and and just sing your heart out amen it's always a limited edition when sister amber gets up and then if if she was a hockey card she'd be worth a million dollars i think because we only get about one a year but we're thankful for every time we get it amen and then i believe god leads and guides it's not about the the quantity it's about the quality i believe amen so praise the lord for that and certainly for sister kimberly as well we appreciate it and then god bless them both philippians 3 verse 4 says though i might have confidence in the flesh if any other man think it that he hath aware of he might might trust in the flesh i more it's an interesting thing for a prophet the age to say paul's saying if any man has reason to think of himself highly it's me that sounds egotistical doesn't it paul says i'm the best of the best if anybody has a reason to think that they're great it's me he says i was circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin and hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless paul says i did it all but what things were gained to me those i counted loss for christ he says yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things what are you willing to lose this morning and to count them but dung that i may win christ he found something he was willing to pay the price for and be found in him not having my known righteousness which he just spent a couple verses telling us about which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection we love that but then he says and the fellowship of his sufferings be made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead that's what paul had that mattered most was his resurrection he knew that he wasn't going in a rapture you know that was for a time in the future but he says i've got to make that resurrection mourning amen he was looking for what not the life here but the life hereafter he says not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which i am also apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended he says i don't consider myself to have it all amen but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before he says i'm not fully mature i'm not fully ready i'm not fully prepared for this yet he says but in spite of that he says i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus he says let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded amen and if in anything he be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you he says it's not wrong if you have a different mind he says but let god change your mind and reveal a new way of going so that you can come into a more perfect way a more mature way amen god bless you may have your seats this morning amen we want to continue in our our little series and we've got just a couple more services as far as i know but i want to take a a title this morning of in his form and with his mind of course but i want to preach on emptied out amen emptied out we're talking about having the mind of christ and before you can ever get the mind of christ you've got to get rid of the mind that's inside of you amen last service we we talked about the the the upper room experience and the day at pentecost and and what happened to those people up there and it's the new birth what they had up there was the new birth and it's what jesus said nicodemus had to have he said that's what every man and every woman that comes into the kingdom of god has to have is a new birth but we didn't really talk much about what happened before that and what was going on up there for those 10 days and it's amazing because we we tell our young people especially you know we we that are maybe more mature in christ we've had the holy ghost we've we've had the baptism the sealing of the holy ghost in our life and there's if there's one thing we teach our children it's get the holy ghost amen it's not get the doctrines of the church it's not it's not come to church all the time those are all good things but they can do all of those things and never get life i mean they can never get that token life of the blood that brother branham said was the holy spirit and there's a there's a process to getting the holy spirit you don't just get it one day amen there's something you have to do and we know what that is peter said it in acts 2 38 and he says you have to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the for the remission of your sins and then you'll receive the baptism of the holy spirit and so often we're focused on getting the holy spirit but there's two things that have to happen before that and that's repentance and baptism now baptism we've got nailed down we know we know what how it's done we know the name it's done in we know the proper uh you know way of doing these things but repentance is something we don't talk too much about and if you'll remember i've said this many times the prophet of god said that the zeal of the age this age is to repent and there's a reason why and we're going to get into that this morning but as they were sitting up there in the in the upper room they had to have a change of something that happened up there something had to go on up there that hadn't happened in their days with jesus even as they they walked the earth with him and they saw the miracles and even they did miracles and signs and wonders and these things yet they were not fully converted remember jesus told peter when you're converted strengthen your brethren so there was something that had to go on in in peter's head and in peter's body and in peter's mind and these different things and same with every single other person up there and you say how long does that take well it took them 10 days it took them 10 days to get to the place where the holy spirit could drop into their lives now how long is it going to take you for me it took about six months from the day i got baptized to the day i knew that i received the holy ghost it was six months so it takes a different amount of time for each and every one of us but i will say this i believe if you set yourself aside from the things of the world if you set yourself aside from the things that distract us and the the hobbies and the entertainment and these things and you turn your face to the wall and you said lord i need the holy ghost you'll get it in the same 10 days if you put the same focus and effort into getting it and waiting on it and expecting for it that they did i believe you'll get the same results because brother brown says if you come to god with the same promise and you do the same thing that everyone else did then you'll get the same result but you got to come the same way and that's what their whole heart mind soul body everything they had was committed to getting the holy ghost and they were waiting to be endued with power on on high amen focus and intent matter so much amen i appreciated brother chad's prayer this morning on helping us to what lord focus on you more amen the times that we set aside the things that we do that that clog up our life get them out of our lives amen help us to focus more purely on god and i read this in the last couple of services but it behooves us to hear it again i think and in jeremiah 29 it says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an unexpected end so if we're looking at god maybe like a amazon delivery service amen it's all on the shelf it's all waiting for you to hit the button there's nothing god doesn't have to create something new for you this morning but it's all sitting there in the promise of the word for you to take hold of this morning and guess what it was lovely in vancouver i could get a package in as little as three hours from amazon you know why because they had a delivery system they had a they have multiple warehouses right there i could get it in three hours from amazon guess what god can give it to you the second you asked for it because it's ready and prepared and waiting for those that are asking him for it amen god doesn't have to create this for you he's ready willing and able to do it he says look the thoughts i have towards you are of what peace not of evil it's all good stuff that god has waiting for us but watch what it takes to get it it says what there's going to be a day he says then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you these are prophetic words listen if you're not crying out to him today there's going to come a day when you're going to cry out if there's a day where you're if you're not asking today there's going to come a day where you're going to start asking because you're going to recognize that there's something missing in your life there's a need in your life that has to be changed amen there's something that has to be met it's deep inside of you amen and god says you will call on me and i will answer amen you will call you may not be calling today but on that day you're going to call and the day you call i'm going to answer you he says and you shall seek me that's prophetic you shall seek me and you shall find me amen you're going to seek and you're going to find you do not seek without finding when god's in the midst of it amen he says what when you shall search for me with all of your heart amen with all of your heart not just a little bit not just a bit here not just a bit there not just this portion of my life and not that portion but when you seek me with all of your heart with all of your soul with all of your mind that's when you're going to hear from heaven amen it's when you seek the way he's telling you to seek and he says you're going to seek you're not going to get away if you're a child of god you're going to seek what he has for you because he doesn't prepare it so that nobody will take use of it he's always got somebody that's going to call on his name amen we look at what that new birth was and peter on the day of pentecost did not preach it from an intellectual conception he might have known he might have had ideas before this ever happened but when he preached on the day of pentecost he didn't say that is that he said this is that it was something that peter had in his life he had gone through the steps the three works of grace repentance and these different things he had gone through all of it he'd been baptized and then he got the baptism of the holy ghost and he steps out and he says you need what i have you've got to go through the process that i went through and the majority of it happened up there in that little room amen with 120 other people acts 2 37 says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said to peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do peter's just finished telling them that you you crucified the prince of life you pro you crucified the messiah you pray you you crucified the christ you did it and their hearts were pricked and they said what do we do and peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins not in titles in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untowards generation he says save yourself so often you people think in the world that the gospel is condemning them no the gospel is saying come get out of where you're in because that's going to a particular age you don't want to be a part of that you don't want to be with that when it falls off the edge of the cliff when it goes from mercy into judgment save yourself from this generation that word untoward means crooked curved that means it's not straight that means it's not consistent that means it moves with the times that it changes with the whims and the emotions and the schools and the education with the politics it's always moving around it's perverse and it's wicked he says save yourself from this generation then it says they that glad they received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls now i want to talk about that word repent because it's it has so many angles to it and brother branham would say it this way he said they said men and brethren what can we do first they wanted to be saved now watch he's talking there to who unbelievers he said repent every one of you now what does repent mean repent means to be sorry for what you've done for instance what if i turned around right here and hit my brother without a cause and i want to repent for it i'd say brother neville i'm sorry i did that see well then if i say i'm sorry i did it and mean it from my heart i am repentant and if i'm sorry for my sins and ask god to forgive me i am repentant is that right all right peter said repent and be sorry for your sins and then be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now this is often deeper than what people think because so many say well brother brahm said and the scripture indicates say you're sorry listen how many times have we seen politicians say they're sorry with zero repentance brother brahm says if i said i'm sorry and it's from my heart i am repentant amen so it has to come from your heart it has to be something inside of you that says that was wrong not because mama said it not because daddy said it not because the pastor said it not because my boss said it but because something in my heart is pricked that's what happened on the day of pentecost their hearts were pricked they mean it has to come from your heart how do you even repent of something if you're not truly sorry for it right what's it going to be it's just the formal proceedings without any sincerity to it and god doesn't accept the formal proceedings that's not the way it works amen their heart he says with your mouth you draw anatomy but your heart is far from me right why because there's no repentance there inside of you nothing has changed but your mouth is just spewing out what people tell you to do to try and make things right acts 2 37 says they were pricked in their heart now peter is only answering the question that those people asked they're the only ones that ask what can we do how do we fix this maybe there are others that say huh that's an interesting thought you're telling me that guy jesus was the messiah he was the christ huh but there were some people that were affected by peter's words and they said how do we fix what's going on inside of us right now what he's only talking to the ones that are impacted by it that's all you're looking for is the ones that are impacted by it it's not for everybody but there are those that were impacted and they had to get it fixed in their life now listen they had just crucified jesus 50 days before 51 in a bid i think anyways they just crucified him and now they're sitting there and saying what we did was wrong but on the day they crucified him they thought it was completely right they thought it was justified they thought it was the better thing to do let barabbas go and kill jesus everything inside of them was saying this is the right thing to do and they supported it and now they're sitting here on the day of pentecost and they're saying what do we do something's changed inside of us what's happened god started moving hasn't he because he blinded their eyes so that they would crucify him he had to pay a price he had to be crucified so he blinded their eyes but then he pulls it back off and all of a sudden their mind is working a different way their heart is in a different condition it's ready to receive the message that he brought in the first place they've gone from one thing to another in 50 days and they don't even know what's happening inside of them don't even know what's going on but something has changed inside of them without them even knowing about it what happened to their minds god started moving god changed wrong in right into wrong in an unsafe person only god can do that only god can take somebody that's been drinking all their life smoking all their life living in adultery all their life watching movies all their life doing all the things the world does and in one moment say whoa that's wrong and it's under what the preaching of the word not just over the pulpit but out of your lives amen out of your lives is going to do the same convicting that i can do over this pulpit or brother gerald can do it and then it's lives lived that's going to do that so many times amen but god is the one that's calling them that's the only way it can happen there was a time allotted and he he did the work in 120 and then they came out and said this is what joel the prophet was talking about now is the day now is the time of salvation brother brown would say he said repent what is repent so he said to say you're sorry from your heart he says repent means to turn around you are going with the world turn around and go up towards god go up you're down here go up but he says go up towards god now you're looking down this way look up this way repent run along with a big long face like this well bless god i've been in the church for 40 years i've never understood a christian with a long face never understood a christian with a long face he says then repent look up this way and say hallelujah there it is yeah that's what you want to do turn around and look different he's not saying look different with your clothes he's saying look in a different direction look to something different than you were looking before he says that's what you should do but he says listen you've been in the church for 40 years and you haven't done this he says and it shows in your long face why because something's stolen something out of your life that ought to be there in the life of a believer and then in john 10 10 it says the thief cometh not before to steal and kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly when we're sitting here with long faces what's it telling me the thief's been in and stole something that belongs to you or you never had it in the first place that's what brother i'm saying you never had in the first place you've been here for 40 years and you're still got to turn down mouth you still have a long face you don't have the joy of the holy ghost in your life the thief has been in our midst amen when someone can't muster up enough joy or peace to crack a smile as a believer i'm starting to question their current experience my voice is going pray for me amen the prophet of god says repent means to turn around and go towards god now listen you'll go towards something if i was super charismatic guess what i could probably turn some of you towards me if you weren't a child of god but guess what children of god can get drawn by charismatic men by ministries by gifts right hey we can all we can all be influenced by those things but that's not what we're supposed to do but you'll be drawn towards what is calling you so the thing is what is calling you you have to make sure it's god every single time because if you're called towards another voice if you're called towards another church if you're called towards a ministry or gift that's where you're going to go so you've got to make sure that it's god calling you every time amen you can respond to an emotional pull over this pulpit and guess what you'll do you'll be stuck in emotional polls the rest of your life because that's what you felt a call to was not god but you responded to emotion right you can be drawn to to to to someone with a great gift up here until the point where that's the only one you'll listen to because their gift is so great that's not the holy spirit it might be the holy spirit in them it's not the holy spirit in you that's doing that sort of having that sort of an effect amen but we're in this this series of in his form and with his mind and when i looked at that word repent in the original language it speaks of our minds and it means to change one's mind not just to have a different thought or a different idea of what's wrong but literally to change one's mind for the better to heartily amend with the abhorrence of one's past sins so to recognize that the way you've been walking was not just wrong but it was abhorrent in god's eyes that there was no rightness there was no goodness about it it was completely opposite of what god wants you to do in your life amen right now that's the hardest thing to do being raised in the message church because you think well i've been raised right and i've been doing right listen you haven't i say by experience my thoughts and attitudes towards people and situations around the message and in this church were completely different before and after i got the holy ghost completely different the way i looked at scripture was completely different the way i applied it how much i looked at myself as opposed to how much i looked at other people changed a whole lot too right you can be raised in it all day long but listen we've got to repent completely and say none of it is worth bringing forward let me start anew on a firm foundation clear everything out empty out is what we're talking about this morning set it all aside and then if he wants to take a brick i've thrown away and put it back in because it was good that's up to him but don't start building the foundation don't continue with the foundation you built on anything other than the true and genuine new birth in your life amen in other words that word repent means you have to upgrade your mind you have to get a new mind it's not just a cleaning it's a new one because the old one doesn't work with god romans 8 says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death so any aspect of the carnal mind in the christian walk leads to one thing and that's death he says but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so one's death the other one's life you'd say i'll be happy with life he says to be spiritually minded is life and peace it's a peace that passes all understanding as the scripture says because the carnal mind is enmity against god and that that word enmity means it is an enemy it is contrary to it is never in agreement with never ever ever is the carnal mind in agreement with the spirit and mind of god ever it is enmity paul says for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be it's not subject to the law of god what is the law of god to the believer the word through the holy spirit he says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god in the fleshly mind in the carnality that is to be human none of it can ever please god but listen to this he says but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you he says you're not in the flesh in the spirit if the spirit dwells in you you've got to have the spirit dwelling in you to be what he says is out of the flesh he says now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his you must be born again he said to nicodemus and that goes for every single person in this church every single person in the world you must be born again it is not receiving the message of the hours not accepting the the prophet of the age it is accepting the person of jesus christ into your life that's the only way he says if christ be in you paul says it if christ be in you this body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen brother brown speaking of the the signs and the miracles and wonders of these things he says the same things will blind the eyes of the carnal mind because it can't understand the things of god can't even comprehend it can't put it in its rightful place it's against god it's the enemy of gods the human mind is the enemy to god you've got to get out of your own human mind and be born anew by the holy spirit and get the mind of god in you then you can believe these things then it becomes a reality he says amen so be it so be it he says see what the world calls great god calls foolish and what the world calls foolish god calls great that's right so don't mind to be called foolish because remember you can't have the mind of christ and the mind of the world at the same time you can't be now what does that look like he says you can't be in your way and god's way at the same time you can't be in your way and god's way at the same time you have to get out of your own way to let god have his way that's the only way you're ever going to do anything you've got to get away from your own thoughts your own reasons don't try to reason he said just believe grace example i know this in the scripture is moses right he had the calling he had the election he had the purpose he knew who he was knew what he was supposed to do and we read that quote where brother branham said he tried his intellect he tried his education he tried his way he tried his his might he tried his strength and none of it worked and then he did it god's way and it worked amen take an example go god's way the first way amen choose that the first time seek that out rather than presume that because we're we're this or we're that then we automatically know he says you have to forget all you ever knowed in order to learn of him empty out that he can fill us he says you don't mix it now you have to empty out amen can i say this bluntly this morning if your thinking hasn't changed since you got saved you haven't been saved you don't have the new birth if you just continued on as you were as if nothing had ever happened then there's a problem in your experience because repentance brings a new mind amen it is not necessarily the mind but there's something that happens there that says what's wrong is right and what's right is wrong now it flips the switch there so that you can start walking with god and that keeps going and going and going and going and it's a process that's going on even today amen it's not that it's all gone because it's a process god's working through us he's cleaning things out he's changing things amen but repentance requires it is defined by a changing of your mind you have to have a different mindset after this is done amen you let go of what you were because it was wrong and you embrace christ because he's the only thing that's right so you let it go you let it go completely but says pentecostal people letting them do that too yeah they want a shortcut to heaven hallelujah all i have to do is get down here and just don't think of nothing at all and say hallelujah hallelujah i got on elijah's garment i'm going out tomorrow to cast out devils hallelujah hallelujah i got it praise god here i go lots of enthusiasm he says they want the shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take what you're in the church and you're experiencing the presence of god but you want to go right back out and continue on doing things as if nothing has ever changed you want the the good times here and the good times out there and the good times in here don't match the good times out there amen okay you can't get sweet water and salt water out of the same fountain bubble says you can't do this he says you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent he says you die you actually die and i'm listening to him preach this and he says oh god why can't i say it right he says you die you literally die to yourselves you die to the things of the world and are born anew amen he says no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcuts amen the things of the world are dead there's no shortcuts that's why i'd say the new birth is a mess why because you die i'm not going to get graphic but guess what deaths are messy when a person dies things relax things release things empty out any nurses or doctors or people that have been in the room when it happens it's not a pleasant experience if you stick around for a little bit it's a mess what is it you cut the strings to over relationships old friendships old habits old ways of doing things old ways of talking connections influences it all gets cut off in one moment and it's a mess it's like cutting off your arm if you cut your arm off there's a big mess there isn't it until things get tied off the same when you die it's a mess but guess what a new birth is a mess too because what you're coming out of something and life's coming with it and you're tied to something else and all those cords have to be cut as well don't they and there's things that surround it and and things that may be initially protected and they come out with it and they get discarded and now life comes out of it but a birth is anyone that has a kid that's been in the room it's a mess too it's as much a mess as death if not more many times it's not clean it's not surgical the work is surgical but the effect is messy amen amen you come out a baby comes out a baby doesn't come out running ready to paint pictures to have intellectual conversations what sometimes you make a mess as a baby too don't you because you don't know anything sometimes that makes messes in our in our relationships and in our marriages and and the different things we do sometimes our enthusiasm and our zeal gets the better of us and we can make messes that way too as soon as you're born what's the first thing that baby does cries all a baby knows is to cry listen no matter the problem with a baby it only has one response doesn't it it's to cry that's the only thing a baby knows it can't say mommy my diaper is wet or dirty it can't say i'm sleeping in an awkward position the only response a baby has is to cry and it's up to the one that knows what's going on to come over and figure it out for the baby the baby's job is to cry out and it's the father or the mother's job to come in and figure out what's wrong so that that baby will stop crying amen the baby may not even understand what it is that is truly wrong with it it can't say i'm hungry all it knows is there's something that doesn't feel good so it cries it can't say i'm wet all it knows is i'm uncomfortable i'm cold this doesn't feel good and so it cries and sometimes we're spiritual children and when we ought to be crying we're sitting there and we're trying to have an articulate conversation with god and say god this is wrong god this is wrong and god fix this and god do it this way and god do it that way and he's saying you're a spiritual child my son cry out let me figure it out let me do that i'm the father i'm papa you don't have a clue you're just a child in this area of your life don't tell me what to do just cry out and say i don't like this i'm not comfortable where i'm at i can't do what i'm supposed to do as a believer god help me god help me i don't know what's going on that's what we're looking for is people that will cry out don't presume on our maturity sometimes the bane of a believer is presumption you presume you're there we're not there we're not out of here we're growing we're maturing he's taking us somewhere cry out to papa god and say papa god i need this cleaned up something's wrong something's wrong and i can't tell you i won't presume to tell you but i need you to clean it up because otherwise i'm just going to be in a mess amen the prophet of god said christ had to die to make us alive to quicken us is that right no matter what church you belong to how many times you shook hands with the preacher how many names you got on the book or how many churches you belong to it doesn't mean that you've got to absolutely accept the death of the lord jesus christ and not only that but you've got to die to yourself listen to this you've got to die to every thought of the flesh so that you can receive the mind of christ and walk from henceforth not of your own but of his mind the mind of christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive that's the only way you can stay alive this morning that's the only way i can stay alive that's all i live by is by the holy spirit man said man shall or jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so many times i've spoken first and cried out later i want to flip that and cry out first and speak later amen lord here's a symptom but i don't know the root cause whether it's temper whether it's an inability to overcome whether it's addiction whether it's depression whether it's a feeling of helplessness or pointlessness lord i don't know where this is coming from but lord something's wrong because this is not the fruit of the holy spirit so instead of saying lord fix this area say lord i'm just telling you what the problem is i'm telling you what i'm feeling like a baby will you go into my life and change it will you go in and empty out what's causing the problem and fill it with the thing that'll make it all better brother branham he's talking he says as i was remarking some time ago about a certain little canary and he thought he knowed all the knowledge that need to be knowed and he knows so much that he could tell all the rest of the canaries about the human beings we call that a psychologist today so he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human being how he knowed all about them and all of a sudden a professor from purdue walked up and began to speak some high polish words to him and the little fellow batted his eyes and turned his head he says now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain listen your carnal mind it's a bird brain compared to god it's not even a bird brain it's a worm brain they don't have brains it's a worm brain he says he hasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings and neither can a human being think like god your human and all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain all you do you just hurt yourself with it he says you've got to have the mind of christ listen job was a man that god was proud to brag about job was a man among men he was the best of the best he was the elite believer and job came to the place where god started talking to him and job said i will be silent the greatest man on the earth at that time and when god started talking job said i'll be silent he'd been talking a lot job had he had some things to say to god but when god started going and looking through the symptoms and making the diagnosis of what was going on in job's life job said i'm an idiot i'm just gonna shush we need to shush so often and let god have a little conversation with us amen too many times we presume on the two-way street and really it's a one-way from us to him and there's so little traffic coming back be like joel i will be silent why brother brown says compared to him we're canaries we're nothing we can't comprehend we can see and we can hear but there's no understanding of what god understands and the way he sees things and the way he does things amen he says people are told out on the west coast now they always have movements don't they brother batman's addressing one of the movements he says oh we got the immortal baptism we baptize you in water you turn right back to a young man right there a young woman yes sir you keep getting he says they got elijah's garments they got manifested sons of god yes sir god brother god is getting manifested sons right now hey we're preaching it in the message listen to this manifesting telling them all about it tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're manifested sons of god he says nonsense where you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and they grow to men amen there's a promise to the manifestation of the sons of god and it does not happen like that listen you're sealed into the kingdom in a moment i believe that but there is a process of training brother brahm said that's the way too many people do it too much carrying on without enough word behind it to back it up he says grow up oh he danced in the spirit last night brother branham he's all right no that don't make him all right to me no sir he's got to one grow up two be proved three tested growing up to him to reach four seasoned amen grow up proved tested and seasoned that's the way it works there is no born and then seasoned there's a lot happening in between there amen he says god's infinite and when he speaks it's got to be perfect he cannot change he says we cannot alter god's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind of christ be in you then we'll think like he thinks so if you don't get rid of the old mind which starts with repentance then where do you end up you end up with dead works because you never started from the right place in the beginning you're not building on a foundation of repentance and so you get down the road and listen i know people that have been there and i know people that are there and they go down the road and they're 5 or 10 years later and they're struggling with their walk and they're saying what in the world went wrong i thought i had the holy ghost i thought i did everything right and you take it back and almost every time it goes straight back to repentance you didn't actually repent you just went and got baptized and then you were expecting the holy ghost and nothing changed in your mind god never did a work there you did it because you answered an emotional call not because there was a prick in your heart i will speak for myself and not not to raise myself up but to say the experience of uh uh of of when that con that conviction hits you is not the work of a moment and you don't get over it in a moment i know when brother braham says dioxide and we'll talk about it in a second a dry confession a dry confession makes no sense to me because it took me 45 minutes to get from my seat to where those brothers prayed for me and then i went to get baptized later that evening 45 minutes and i cried and shook and cried and shook the entire time and i wasn't looking at anybody else except my life and saying unworthy unworthy unworthy there was no dry eyes there there's no looking around to see what people thought but when i went through that prayer line and i came out i was completely scoured out clean as a whistle i had no thoughts of guilt no thoughts of shame but i repented and i repented and i repented and it wasn't my work it was something in my heart that wouldn't stop until it was resolved that's what we're talking about not mommy and daddy told me to something in my heart says i got her change and that's what drew me up to there you know what did it praying praying parents praying church people looking for a real new birth in our young people amen without a sincere repentance without a change of your mind water baptism is just a dead work even if you do it in the name of the lord jesus christ because you didn't repent lebron talks about he says in a great revival here not long ago up here one of these eastern states he says they claimed to have 30 000 converts and six weeks later they couldn't find 30 people holding out why it was just a cold dry-eyed confession god requires death and regeneration he says that's what the matter he says to come to the altar with a dry eye confession is a tradition you should die there to your sacrifice as you identify yourself that you are dead amen buried in christ the world is dead behind you and you're to walk in a new life with christ jesus in his resurrection loving his word taking his word watch him identify himself in his word as giving you the identification that you pass from death unto life it's not just die but out of that death comes life now he says what a time that we're living in yes sir now we see that we're living down to the last hours the believer must accept all the word he didn't restore it so we could ignore it right the opposite of repentance is what rebellion you feel it's wrong and then you say but i'm going to keep doing it amen right if you don't repent then it turns into rebellion and what happens if you insist on rebellion eventually it sears your conscience and so that you don't feel any conviction anymore and so you can do whatever you want if you turn down repentance then rebellion's going to come in first timothy 4 says now the spirit speaks speaketh expressly it means it's very specific about when this is going to happen that in the latter times which is when now so let me put it this way that today now some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils i mean that's aimed at people that are going to leave the faith we've seen it haven't we and we're still seeing it people that are leaving the faith and what caused it seducing spirits that's one thing guess what that's not always over a pulpit there can be all sorts of things that are seducing you drawing away your time and energy and efforts getting your mind out of the word and getting it into something else and then he says there's doctrines of devils and that's preached over the pulpit he says speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience here with a hot iron that speaking lies in hypocrisy means that you're excluding yourself from the requirement of the word of god and what happens is as soon as you do that he says that your your conscience starts to get seared and when your conscience is seared what do you start doing you start telling other people they can do the same thing you do and guess what that's lovely for the carnal mind that's lovely for the flesh you can do what i do and because i'm a preacher and i do it then you can do it too and they're taking their cues from the ministry rather than the word and the holy spirit right you check everything i say you check everything brother gerald says against the word don't do it if it's not in the word amen but they listen to the doctrines of devils and it draws them into a place where they get their conscience here and they're an open rebellion again amen that's why i said the other day i said when people go against the word when they make decisions in their life when they do something that is contrary to what god has said what do you do you tell them and then you let them go because you can't you can't cushion the chastising of god that's his chastising so and i'm speaking by experience right you walk away people warn you you do something you ought not to do god spanks you and guess what having your brother there ain't going to make it any easier all you're doing is getting them involved having your sister in there just gets them involved you got to take the spanking amen but like the prodigal son we stand where back home on the word and we say come on home we're looking every day the father was out looking for them to come home wasn't he he didn't lose his sonship he just lost some of his innocence right and he got some pain and he got some heart he got some offenses he got to a place where he had to eat pigs food that's when he finally said hey i'm better than this i come from a better lineage than to have to eat pigs food i don't enjoy it anymore amen he came to himself the scripture says brother jason watkins said this he said a friend is someone that holds you accountable to the word that's a tough thing to do to say to a brother or sister hey shouldn't do it but he says that's what a friend will do hold you accountable to the word amen because why i'm not for or against you i'm for the word amen and then the question is what are you for because if you're not for the word then you've got to go but i'm going to stay with the word so i'm not for brother vaishal i'm for the word and as long as brother weissel stays with the word then we're great but if he gets out then what happens fellowship pulls away why because he's not for the word he's not for me i'm not for him we're for the word and as soon as that changes then there's what a barricade comes up to fellowship barricade comes up to relationship because why we're serving two different masters at that moment right and we've got to come back to the same page we've got to come back to the same foundation we've got to come back to the home and home base is always the word of god amen i'm not trying to be dark or harsh with this i'm telling you that's what the prophet said is what the scripture says look out for it i like what brother eargley said it really struck me when he preached he says sometimes lacks-ness isn't from being backslidden he says sometimes it's a lack of fervency i thought that was amazing i thought that was amazing he says listen it's not that you're out there doing bad things it's that you're not doing the right things and what happens is then you start to slide into other things what slack living depression feelings of pointlessness questions worry mindless entertainment what you're trying to get something in there that's going to make you feel the way that god intends you to feel which is fulfilled right but because you're not in his place you'll fill it with anything else trying to do what gets you back to that place the only way to get back to that place is to go back to that place right what standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find jesus right where right where you left him right where you left him he doesn't move on without you right he just sits there like the prodigal father saying is she coming back don't see her all right another day i'll be here tomorrow 24 7 365. he stands there waiting for you to come back where you left him i started with paul's words this morning because they speak so eloquently of what it looks like to experience the new birth in the changing of your mind amen he gave all his credentials as to why he was an awesome person paul was a pretty awesome person before he got saved and he was the enemy of god the enemy of the true church he was antichrist and he was an awesome guy amen philippians 3 we're going to close shortly he says but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ this is a beautiful before and after picture he says yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ you can't make anything less valuable than dung if you're to sell something on the open market dung's about as low as it gets unless you're a farmer right paul says that's the kind of value we attach to our achievements and the things that we've done in our life the gifts we bring he says it's all done the prophet of god puts it this way he says well i was studying one day what was this pitch he's talking about noah's ark pitch to us is tar that we take chemicals and make tar and pitch the road the cracks in the road and so forth with tar but those days it was different they had a rosin tree and they'd take this evergreen and cut it down and instead of having the things that we do today to take the rosin out they beat the tree and they beat the tree till the sap and rosin poured out then they would heat it and pour it upon the soft gopher wood that was like a sponge and it just filled up and then when it got hardened you couldn't drive a nail in it see it was ready to receive he says that's like christ he's talking about the beating tree the tree that's beaten so that things flow out of it then he switches to the to the other word or to the other tree which is the the gopher wood he says that's the church see the church must empty itself out and get real light get all the denomination out of you now listen raised in the message in the message we don't have a concept of what denomination means i was talking to this to some ministers about this we don't have a clue what denomination means because most of us have never been there only some of the older folks here have ever been in a denomination if at all but what is a denomination a denomination is where you take your thinking over god's thinking your way over god's way guess what we've got a million denominations in the world of people that are sitting in message pews and doing things their own way he says get the denomination of you get the get your own way of doing things get your own way of thinking of things your own way of approaching things your own way of resolving things get out of that he says get all the world out of you get all the belief out of you and then he says get away remember repentance says to turn around and go towards god get away from it he says and there was another which was different from us that was cut down in his young life and he was bruised and beaten wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity and he was beaten until the life of him poured out like the rosin out of a tree he says and oh how the christian can soak it up oh if you're empty there's a condition here you've got to be empty can't be half full can't be three-quarters full can't be 99 empty he says you've got to be empty period but you got to empty up first he says the trouble of it is we don't want to empty up but let's empty up all of our thoughts all of our creeds all of our books and soak up the holy spirit which is god in his word then it could ride the storm it could ride the seas because it was harder than any other wood there was nothing could take its place he says the parts of the ark still remain six thousand years ago and they find parts of it because it remains because it was so hardened from this cased out that kept the judgments on the outside he says the waters was the judgments he says and when we come into christ through his beaten life soak up him into our system we become so inoculated from the things of the world until they could stand the wrath then when the storms are pitching and the sea is contrary yet the little boat won't fail she slides right on through the waves to the rock of ages he says inoculated what we'd say today vaccinated listen you don't have to believe in vaccination this world but you better believe in this kind of vaccination amen he says when you get this kind of vaccination you get this kind of inoculation he says what the world and the things of the world do not affect you they can't touch you because why you're hardened to it he says you're cased there's a shell that's formed over you says you can't even drive a nail into it that's how hard it is nothing from the outside gets in because you soaked up the life of the one that was bruised and beaten for you amen amen says what it's inoculated from the things of the world guess what if you're not affected by it you don't try and fix it you don't try and get involved with it you don't worry about it because you're unaffected by it listen i don't like the politics we have today i don't like the finances we have today i don't like the way things are going but guess what it's got to get worse it's got to get worse to make us more desperate it's got to get worse to fulfill prophecy and it's got to get worse to get us on our knees to where we say this is not my home why would i try and fix a place that's not my home i'm a pilgrim and a stranger right we're seeking a city whose builder and maker is god why would i start trying to fix up satan eason i've got no time to fix this place it's done it's dead 1956 brother bram says it's over she has turned it down for the last time and then he indicted her for the second crucifixion of jesus christ the united states and i believe canada was involved in that as well all of north america it's done it's over he says the logs on the skid it's rolling down it ain't coming back amen so don't try and stop it don't try and fix it it's prophecy being fulfilled we'd literally be fighting prophecy to try and stop it watch how paul's mindset changes here after the new birth not just towards his old self but what he's achieved because sometimes that's where we get caught up is well i'm this and i'm that and i've done great things and raised great kids and had a wonderful ministry and all these different things whatever it might be that's in your head but paul says this he says not that i have attained this ideal this in the amplified or i've already been made perfect listen he talked about how perfect he was but he says look i'm no longer perfect in that way but i press on to lay hold of to grasp and make my own that for which christ jesus has laid hold of me and made me his own i do not consider brethren that i have captured and made it my own yet but one thing i do he says it is my one aspiration forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead sometimes we think about that looking in the past is is forgetting our old lives and mistakes and that's fine and true but if you look at verse 12 he's not talking about his old life and his mistakes he's saying all of my achievements all the good things i've done he says i forget that even he says and i press i strain my work is to go forward amen he's not letting his past growth and improvement stop him from continuing to seek future growth and improvements he's not resting on his laurels we would say he's saying there's always more for me until i leave this earth so i'm going to keep pressing towards the more i'm going to keep pushing i'm going to keep saying lord do more in my life because there's a promise for it amen listen we're satisfied we're appreciative of what god does in our lives i'm thankful he saved me and thankfully fill me with the holy ghost and thankfully he's called me to a ministry but it's not the be-all and end-all amen he wants to turn me into a fully manifested son of cr son of god he wants to turn you into one and a daughter in these different things there's a there's a furtherance in this ministry for each and every one of us amen we're not there yet but we're straining for it because we know when we believe it's there amen paul say no matter what i've done or achieved in christ i never consider that high enough to stop trying and by trying he means pressing the battle not trying to do it on his own but pressing for more and more of god to absorb more of the life if we can put it that way to empty out more so that more can be poured in amen you know what was his mindset verse 14 says i press on toward the goal to win the supreme and heavenly prize to which god and christ is calling us upward what is it the resurrection and the rapture that restores us to eternal fellowship with god amen that's the way our mind ought to work after the new birth i'm pressing towards one goal and one goal alone jonathan what's your goal for monday make a rapture tuesday make a rapture when you wake up in the morning wake a rapture when you go to bed make a rapture that's the only thing we ought to have in our mind make that rapture romans 12 he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world do you know what confirmation is you take a piece of steel you have a piece of tubing or something and you take it and you press on both sides and you bend it around that's conforming that's using force it's using force it's putting pressure on something to change it into a different shape or purpose he says that's not the way this works we're not forcing you into it he says but be ye transformed by the what renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god good acceptable and perfect that's a high standard that's a very high standard his way his time his attitude his motive his objective right his strength that's what he says that's the prize of the high calling here that's what it looks like is when you're pushing as you're looking for this amen but he says what the renewing he didn't say by transformed by the new mind he says the renewing how can you be renewed if you didn't have it in the first place he says this is your original mind this is what you used to be before you came into sin this is the way your mind used to work before sin dropped in we're taking you back to your precinct condition we're taking you back to what you used to be that word transform is kind of like a butterfly right it used to be a caterpillar and then it goes in through a process and it wraps itself up and what comes out in no way represents what came in right a butterfly doesn't look like a caterpillar doesn't act like a caterpillar doesn't move like a caterpillar everything about a caterpillar has been erased from that butterfly he's a butterfly now and nothing of a caterpillar remains that's what a transformation is you were one thing and now you're another and he says it starts with the renewing of your mind it starts with the changing of your mind that's the start point and it never stops it's a lifetime of renewal it's a lifetime of renewal as god opens things up to you as he shows things to you as he takes things out and fills it with new things there's a constant thing that's going on but it's a new creation it's a new creature it's not a confirmation we're not bending you into another shape we're taking you and turning you into something completely different that has no attachment to what you used to be lebron says don't think i'm crazy he says i'm not if i am just let me alone i'm more happier this way than i was the other way yes sir just let me stay this way oh sure crazy to the world for those things what the world calls crazy god calls blessed he says you have to lose your mind to this world because why you're not of this world when you cross over that separating line you become fellow citizens of the kingdom of god says oh my how good is it why you become a new creature oh my change from this what you are now he says you are now the sons of god now we are sitting together in heavenly places not we will be in the millennium we are now right now we're the sons of god right now we're sitting together in the heavenly places in christ jesus not just in the church in christ jesus the resurrected lord jesus is here he is here in his power he is here in his redemption power he is here for the exodus he is here to bring every church member into fellowship with him he is here to bring every sinner no matter how low you are he is here to bring the power of his resurrection into your life and make you a new creature and then if the musicians would come he says what he's here to bring every church member it's where we start so often isn't it just a church member just coming to church mom and dad bring me to church i go to church because we always have gone to church he says buddy i'm here to turn every bring every church member into fellowship with him amen we close with one quote if we'll all stand together he says and dear god then for ourselves we will claim in this hour to be the church to call out those around the world who has come out from babylon and to be partakers of this wonderful fellowship in this last day we pray god that you'll bless our hearts in such a way he says we're truly hungry lord and emptied out from all the things of the world that we know of can you pray that prayer this morning i'm emptied out of everything he says lord we've set aside every weight that so easily beset us and now let us run this race with patience that sets before us granite father and may we be fuller stronger better christians at the end of this service than we were when we entered now listen he says may god get all the glory for we ask it in jesus name amen and then next service we're going to talk about a pouring in but before there can be a pouring in there's got to be an empty nowaday man like i said that's it's a start point you give up what you know to give up you let go of what you know to let go but we're in a body that is completely identity with god and so it's a day in and a day out god's cutting things away and sometimes it's messy sometimes it takes a long time to heal sometimes it takes to fill up time to fill up doesn't it but if you empty out he'll fill and guess what it's him that's going to do the emptying out anyways all he's saying is surrender it let it go let it go whatever you're holding on to the enjoyment the the the dopamine rush you know what dopamine does makes you feel good you get addicted to something and dopamine is what comes out whether it's fast cars whether it's riding your bike quickly whether it's airsoft whether it's sports what you get a rush from it so many times you can't let go of the rush you can't let go the good feeling that comes with it he says you got to let go of that you got to let go the thing that makes you feel great because i've got something so much higher than that something that lasts right that's the fruit of the holy spirit it lasts it's not just a high every now and again but it's something that's available to us constantly day in and day out you don't have to pay money for it you don't have to go somewhere to get it you can have it with you every day of your life amen you gotta empty out though so he can pour it let's bow our heads lord jesus lord you called us to walk a straight and narrow way the lord we rest on the fact that you called us to it or that you pricked our hearts lord that our consciences lord they couldn't stay in the condition they were in after you started calling us and lord we emptied out i believe that day that you called us but lord we need to empty out more and more lord if we want more of you then more of us has to leave or more of the world has to leave more of satan's strongholds have to be torn down in our lives lord god and lord so we ask in these just few moments lord that as we would dwell in your presence orders we would sing songs of worship and praise lord that we'd look into our lives lord and we'd see where we need to empty out lord where we need to let go lord where we need to relax lord where we need to rest and just trust that the pouring in will follow the emptying out for each and every one of us lord where we need healing lord we pray your grace this morning lord where we need deliverance we pray the power of your holy spirit to come down and touch each one lord where we need resolution lord we pray that you would be the mighty conqueror lord that you would be the lord the negotiator lord that you would sort all things out according to your perfect will and purpose if we'll trust you amen lord just
