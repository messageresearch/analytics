it's quite long but it's a report from the nurse who is uh attending her looking after her who's also a believer uh but she has uh well she starts off by saying that it has been a difficult week for her and she said it's difficult to put into words uh but it's been an uphill battle for every inch of ground that they that that they've fought for this week uh so she describes her uh medical condition and things that have gone on so you know she's not able to take food or water through her mouth or anything like that she's having a difficult time but she is home and there are nurses that come by and help drain fluid from her liver and also by grace the christian doctor has taken over her care and she just she's he's described as very uh caring very loving so we thank the lord for that but uh she's also had uh discussions with palliative care doctors and uh they the doctor just gives her a couple of days a few days so we won't remember that but it ends off by saying that laura is very peaceful and trusting in the lord regardless regardless of the outcome so he has a really good attitude we are we are convinced together that nothing is too hard for uh for the lord our god and that now is the time that we expect him to come on the scene in the darkest of hours so it's and she said this is what we hold to and we give the glory to god so we just want to continue to pray for him i mean god is god is quite capable of providing a miracle and performing a miracle and we believe that we've seen miracles in our own lives i'm sure we've never had to go down to that level of course or experience that but god is still still able and i'll never forget you know what matt sent to me one time when i was dealing with the cancer and that is that what brother branham said that it's only cancer right so there's no sickness or no disease any greater than the promises of god i mean let's face it i mean god is greater right so he has a purpose for sister laura he has a purpose for all of us but he has a purpose for her for her going through this right and if nothing else what i'm seeing is a wonderful attitude to somebody who's who's dying and leaving a young family behind

he needs stitches in his head and but he also hurt his neck in the process so that's why i think that's why they're keeping him in to see if just any effects from that so you know he's he's having his time as well so we want to remember brother everett uh god's grace to him again again there's a purpose for all of it right so we've got to believe that god's god's purpose is being fulfilled in all

redemption amen and the token is the sign signal and proof of redemption amen if i got the token life of the holy ghost in me amen praise the lord it is a sign that i've been redeemed praise the lord hallelujah it is a signal in my life oh why do i feel this why do i have this amen when i experience this it's not it's not it's not religion it's it's spiritual it's the holy ghost amen it is christ in us and it is the signal and it is the proof amen that we have been redeemed the life you're living the life that we live the life that we're experiencing amen amen we got the token amen it is the life of the blood the shed blood of jesus praise the lord the holy ghost praise the lord and again remember that it is a sign and it is a signal and it is proof of our redemption praise the lord oh brother don't let the devil persuade you or you're not redeemed i am redeemed amen i got the sign i got the signal and i got the proof because god gave it to me amen god promised it and now i've experienced it and i am experiencing it amen morning noon and night in my relationship with god hallelujah he is constantly reminding me of the sign he is constantly reminding me of the signal and the proof what what what are we experiencing what are you experiencing what is this that you're experiencing amen this sign this signal this proof amen son daughter that's the sign of my redemption you have been redeemed amen i ever redeem you please don't let don't doubt it don't let the devil get you to doubt it amen to think oh lord will i be saved will i brother sister we have the assurance amen by the grace of god that we are saved amen now we will be we are you have been redeemed not will be redeemed we have been redeemed amen and by the grace of god brother sister there's you can't lose it you can't lose it amen it is forever settled there you know as the prophet of god brings it out again in the token message there brother sister he said where did this come from when did this come he said before the foundation of the world amen he said because he said why he said the lamb was slain for our redemption he said before the foundation of the world hallelujah so brother sister don't think oh well i was saved amen and i i i'll be lost no no if you're if you're identifying with the redemption for the before the foundation of the world amen what god redeemed before the foundation of the world oh brother sister you're there at the end amen the alpha there's that's the alpha and then the omega oh brother there's many that's going to come in and go out and come in and go out in between the alpha and omega but brother those that god for for ordained those that god predestinated those got god for no before the foundation of the world brother you're not going to be lost amen he started with you he's going to finish with you amen by the grace of almighty god hallelujah oh praise the lord brother is there oh i thank god oh it's not just saying well this one is going up and getting saved that one's going on getting saved no they're going up to it to identify with what god already did he already saved them amen before the foundation of the world so he brought forth the gospel the preaching and the ministry and so on and to bring conviction in their hearts amen oh or they're going to go up and get saved oh if you don't walk through the elder you want to say oh yes you will what god's looking at is your faith amen praise the name of the lord amen and brother the faith that god's looking at amen not in your head it's in your heart amen what is your attitude in your heart toward god and toward the word amen toward salvation what is your attitude in your soul amen because there's where god works is on the inside of the inside amen when it comes to religion brother oh brother god all down true in every revival god started with this god started with that it was in the soul amen but within within a matter of maybe three years the prophet said that's when they went into a denomination amen and got organized oh yeah within about three years brother it came out of the soul and just and they began to deal with it in your mind amen i'm this and i'm that but it was all in their mind amen but if you're the seed of god brother it's an experience you're constantly living in your soul hallelujah it's not what you think in your mind no no not by any means because if it's just your mind the devil is there the the to cause you to doubt or the devil is there to cause you to believe or you're not saved because of this you're not saved because of that amen but brother go back into the soul and see what god has done and see what god is doing in your soul amen the devil is there to accuse us that the devil is there to condemn us the devil is there amen to work on our flesh i tell you this brother if we said that's why he said if we sin we've got an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous amen if we sin just and you and you and you repent amen oh that's it i tell you this if you're the seed of god predestinate the seed of god amen from the foundation of the world amen and it's in your soul by the grace of god i tell you this no matter what what what happens in your flesh the devil might cause you to do this and stumble amen but i tell you if you're your seed you got that you've got that nature amen if oh if the devil does this the devil does that amen in a time of weakness in your flesh or you'll repent oh you will amen your seed of god you will repent oh lord forgive me lord forgive me lord that was the devil working in my flesh amen so lord i pray grace amen so we're redeemed and we go back again to serve the lord oh brother sister amen now god help us amen to truly truly amen know what redemption is amen my experience with god is redemption amen my experience with with one another is redemption as brothers and sisters we we were lost but we're redeemed amen we were amen lost but now we're saved amen and i i experienced redemption your experience redemption the life that you live amen is going to reflect redemption amen that is it's god that works in us amen it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me oh yes there's got to be christ in you amen not religion brother and and and for many when it comes to their religious oh yes but i'll tell you this it's not christ in them it's the devil oh yeah it's the devil and what's he doing he what did he give them you give them an experience yes he give them an experience amen but not the experience that god gives amen and give them a religious experience and to go to church and to do this and maybe just to go to the altar oh yeah oh brother sister as i said one time when i was in a church somewhere and at messi's church and brother if you come to the altar if you really really meet jesus at the altar you're going to be like jesus amen not just religious and like the church no not by any means and you think this and think that no you're going to have a true revelation of redemption oh yeah it's like i said when i was at that altar praying and there was another professing believer nearby and they were praying and i said lord i said what are they saying oh they said oh lord i thank you lord for bringing us out of the denominations and now lord we don't addre i said lord i said that person needs a revelation amen i said you bring us out of one thing you bring us into another and i said we're not subbing to what you brought us out of but i said there and there are there are other other other anointings there that you want us to be subject to or in the church oh yes most definitely amen and yet there are believers that feel that they don't have to be and that person was supposed to be a believer and saying thank you lord for bringing me out of the denominations now i don't have to be subbing to any man i don't have to listen to anybody i just listen to you i tell you this because why because god has set in the church amen these ministries to do this to do this to do this amen for the perfecting of the saints amen so that person will that person never come to perfection i pray the grace of god they do amen but tell you this to come to that perfection they got to come to the revelation of god amen what god has done yes he did this but what's he doing how is he bringing that out how is he how is he bringing that into your life and amen and revealing that in you amen how is he making it flesh in you becoming flesh in you it is through a ministry oh my oh my oh my god help us brother the power of god has warned us amen that oh yes he said god is going to bring you from there from there from there then he's going to bring you into a church and he said you become you come under a ministry oh he said that why that's god that's the way god does things by the grace of god amen amen so brother let's let's make sure we got a right spirit amen we got the right revelation amen amen we know what god is doing amen and we know how he's doing it amen oh but god does it this way well this is according to the word of god we can go we can go all the way back to genesis and see that god begins to deal this way this way this way amen brother again like i said all down through the old testament there's the ministry all that through the new testament is a ministry right on into amen right on into the kingdom of god is a ministry oh yeah the problem of god said you know if you're got a ministry here he said he said you you'll meet you'll have that ministry in in in in heaven oh yeah the ministry is going to be there too oh we know that we're all going to be under jesus amen it's not going to be the like it is here but he said the ministry is going to be there amen by the grace of god oh yes amen and again oh i won't say it i'll leave that amen no doubt the prophet has said it and highlighted it and so on amen but let's recognize who we are as the sons and daughters of god and let's recognize what god is doing in our lives and how god is doing it amen and the power and the anointing that god is using amen god is using this god is using that amen and it it's for your benefit amen spiritually and maybe physically amen but all you physically too oh yes because god is there amen and god is in the ministry god is in this one your brothers and sisters to pray for one another amen for god to bless you god to help you god to do this oh my brother sister amen let's don't think oh it's just me and god but he well lord he's in that brother he's in that sister amen and sometimes he'll move in that brother moving their sister to bless you oh yes definitely moving that brother that sister amen to to speak to you amen oh yes he does and and again i know yeah well it's a ministry yes but sometimes

just amen brother and what happens it's got to be a testimony that is holy ghost leadership oh brother what a testimony when god leads you to do this i pray god amen that we have the grace to follow his leadership oh yes because sometimes god is going to ask us to do things that oh that's absolutely tremendous amen a tremendous challenge to our faith oh yeah tremendous challenge to what we're

as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father amen and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together praise the lord if so be that we suffer with him amen are we willing to let go amen and follow his leadership we might think well if i go that way i'm going to have to suffer this and i'll suffer that we'll suffer it amen amen he suffered amen so if we suffer with him we will also be glorified with him praise the lord hallelujah is to identify he's identified with us we're identifying with him and again verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory amen which shall be revealed in us god help us to believe it amen brother amen let's get beyond religion into a real experience with god amen into a real experience with jesus amen that i know him amen in the power of his resurrection praise the lord

church they go to that church oh this is their pastor so on brother we're not identifying with those churches we identified with the church of the living god amen it's not churches it's just at your church amen brother it's not oh well uh this is my church here that's their church there that's their church that no we're all part of the same church by the grace of god amen no matter where you go it's the same church amen oh brother i pray grace give us that understanding that revelation that feeling amen we need it so that we're not oh well these believers are going to that church these believers are going over there that church somewhere else oh yes they asked and they're identified with this and that no no no we're going to the church of god by the grace of god your and you go

jesus amen there's not reflecting oh they belong to this church they blot no you belong to jesus grace to us amen oh brother what an hour work we're coming to god is challenging our faith god has excused this and excused that down through the ages but brother now no no he's not accusing it no more why considering what he's done and what he's revealed brother he requires more perfection amen again verse 18 i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us glory revealed in us amen i don't know if i read verse 16. oh yeah it said the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen you're not it's not natural spiritual we are the children of god not children of this church not children that church you're the children of god amen and if children yeah then hairs heirs of god joint ears with christ if also if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together god help us let go let god have his way for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen no for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain to gather until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves amen how many have that experience amen that we've grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption amen waiting for the adoption to wit or to know the redemption of our body we've got the experience that we're redeemed in our souls amen but amen is giving us the faith for the redemption of our bodies amen hallelujah onto perfection hallelujah brother it's not just from the from the inside it's got to be in from the inside out amen it is the holy spirit controlling the holy ghost controlling your human spirit and through the human spirit controlling your physical being by the grace of god it's not going from the head down it's going from the soul up amen there's too many god in their heads when it comes to the intellectual knowledge or even you know they feel the holy ghost is in the soul revealing the word under this they're this they're they we do this we do this we do this amen right but it's got to be out of the soul amen got to come from the inside of the inside amen showing that your life is on the inside not the outside because what's outside is just oh the census is the flesh but if it's in your soul your senses is the holy spirit amen hallelujah is your spirit your spirit so i trust the brother we're being governed by the senses of our spirit and not the senses of our flesh amen god's in control a man of your not just your your physical feelings but you're spiritual from the inside out amen because god's in control of the soul and god's controlling your spirit and through your spirit he's controlling your human nature oh yeah your physical being praise the name of the lord there's too many got religion in their heads but oh yeah but the enemy is still in control of their flesh but if you've got if god is in your soul i'll tell you this he got control of your spirit and your flesh oh god have mercy on us amen verse 23 again and it says not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption amen to wit or to know the redemption of our body we got the experience of redemption in our souls and we're hungry and thirsty amen so that we can work it out through the flesh a man sure is not just controlling the flesh so that the holy ghost takes control amen and changes it we're going to be changed from the inside out praise the lord he brother changed the inside but now he's working on us to change us outside to get us into a glorified body amen by the grace of god but we groan how many are groaning within themselves i mean really really really are hungry and thirsting for the things of god how many are really angry at thirsting and groaning within themselves oh lord we want to get out of time and into eternity i'll tell you if you got christ in you you're going to have the same spirit he had the same anointing he had the same feeling that he had and what what was this feeling don't you oh i brought it out many times where jesus said after he was with the disciples for so long he said oh my he said how long shall i be with you how much longer will i be with you what in the flesh experiencing those things in the flesh he said no man he said talk about no man has come down but he that is in heaven he's not even the son of man who is in heaven he has come down he said even the son of man who is and he was longing to get back there amen he had a well we got a representation there he got a representation there jesus did he went back amen brother but he come back to us by it by the spirit amen what poor decreed in us to hunger and thirst to get back to get home to get back to eternity amen if we are the seed of god as jesus was we want to go we we believe oh the prophet of god did say he said listen he said you're theophany body he said it's not 12 feet from you at any given time how many are conscious of theophany how many are conscious that you you don't belong here in this body you don't belong here in this dimension what no i'm i'm waiting my my theophany's right there and he says sometimes he said the holy ghost he said the lord he said well allow your theophany to get closer to you and it create created you he said a hunger amen oh and a longing to get to get out of time into eternity how many are conscious of their theophanies not many yours is your theophant is not is not far from you right now not no it's just in another dimension it's right now it's right next to you by pray grace of god brother especially us in this hour in this age that because we're getting getting closer and closer to the resurrection closer to the rapture i believe our theophany is getting closer to us and it's going to stay closer to us amen because we got to step out of time into eternity by the grace of god how many are really conscious of it brother it's not just an idea something got in your head not but too often and it's just it's unfortunate that too many so-called believers all they got is in their head or they believe oh yeah the prophet are theophanies right there yeah but um but the bible speaks of groaning groaning to get out of this dimension into that dimension and brother the closer we're getting to eternity closer we're getting to the resurrection closer we're getting to the rapture amen brother i believe the greater greater greater the groaning is going to be and we're going to get more and more conscious of eternity oh brother oh oh my god have mercy on us lord have mercy on us how many believers are really really more conscious of eternity than time well when we consider what the prophets say concerning the number that is going to go at a time into eternity at the resurrection rapture i trust we're numbered with the very few oh it is shocking i know because i've shocked certain believers when i've said what the prophet said about how many will be here for the resurrection and the rapture oh yeah believers have been shocked that few is going to be that few i trust we're numbered with the few at the time when that anointing and i'll tell you this brother the anointing is going to come on the word the anointing is going to hey man hallelujah we got there's got to be the word in you and the anointing is going to touch the word in you and change you i trust we got that word and we're we got this word that word this word and he did this and and it brought forth this word in us they've revealed in our flesh revealed this revealed that amen praise the lord and it's getting greater and greater and greater until one day oh praise the lord oh there's something going on i'm beginning to send something oh my who's here anybody here oh there's someone right there where you don't see them but you're contacting by faith you're theophany because you've got to get closer closer and closer and then we blend into eternity please let's be very conscious of what god has done let's be conscious of what god's doing you know the prophet of god has warned us of those things so god help us brother brother i tell you what has god done to make us more and more conscious of eternity that's what the token he gives us the token the power and the anointing of the life of the blood of jesus amen through the baptism of the holy ghost he said our token is the holy ghost and he gives us the holy ghost to keep us well to keep us in contact with the word he gives us the holy ghost to keep us in contact with eternity that's where we come from that's where we're going believing the word brother is changing us that's what it's ordained to do it's what it's ordained to do it's changes so believe in the word by the holy ghost we're moving on moving on moving on hallelujah to the change please in the name of jesus stay with the word in the name of jesus stay under the control of the word grace grace grace that you make sure every day not you that lives is christ living in you is christ in control of your thoughts christ in control of your words your days is christ's control of your plans lord what is your will not my will no matter what you have to make a decision to do not my will thine be done i don't care what it is brother what a statement to make that is not me that lives is christ living in me you mean is jesus leading you to do this is jesus doing this jesus doing that yeah god help us but i know that there's things that that certain individuals do and well that's not the lord no lord that's their carnal nature i pray gracious for a greater anointing to make them more conscious of their spiritual nature amen a great anointing to bring us to the place where we want to surrender more and more to the leadership of the holy ghost again not my will thine be done brother the proof that you have the token is the token in control by the grace of god let me share with you a thought praise the lord the prophet said he said the token was not so good unless the token was displayed showing that he's in control amen he said the token had to be displayed he said it's not a sympathizer he said with the token but a token must be applied amen no matter how much anyone he said could prove that he was a jew or a covenant jew by circumcision that didn't do anything about it he said it took the token not the covenant amen he said he never said when i received a covenant sign he said but when i see the token amen so today he said you might be a professed christian and he said you might be a covenant and he said with oh yeah with covenant with christ but unless that token is displayed in this late hour that we are coming to now there is no way for him to pass over the token must be displayed it must be in control the token so he said remember a jew could have come up and said i'll take you men aside and i believe that to be the truth i believe moses the prophet i believe the pillar of fire that's guiding him i believe that's jehovah witness all of it believe all the word all the message but yet say now i'm just as well off as you because i am a circumcised jew and he said if he didn't have that blood in the night of the passover he died just the same and he said today he said every church listen every church every individual that isn't and cannot display that token of the holy ghost is spiritually dying and will die every church every individual that isn't and cannot display the token of the holy ghost it's spiritually dying and will die and no matter how much you believe in the death burial and resurrection he said no matter how much you can repeat the apostles creed he said whatever you might do repeat it no matter how well how educated you are what a theologian you experience he said no he said there must be the token displayed amen the life it's the life not the letter no no it's it's the life that makes the letter live amen he said listen i want you to remember this he said you inside outside in the basement wherever you are he said wherever you may be the hour has come and he said everyone can see the dullness of the church today everybody can see the deadness of many and he said too many of the members it's just because that you have played around and you took sensations and you took other things and he said you have trusted upon he said the membership of your mother's church upon some loyal pastor but he said that all our good things have nothing against them no more than circumcision was to the jew but he said that wasn't god's program he said when i see the blood well can you see the blood yes by the life of the blood in you if any he got to see in you it's not just the letter of the word it's gonna be the life of the word amen and today said the holy ghost is god's covenant with god's covenant people the holy ghost the life of the resurrected christ has got to be displayed in the church amongst the people making him the same yesterday today and forever amen and he said today the exodus is calling out of the systems into the bride it's no matter how you said how much system you're in it still requires the token of the life of jesus amen of jesus christ again nothing else will work still the token is required the life of jesus christ in you so the life you live is it is it the reflection of jesus in you i trust by grace it's not the letter of the word but the spirit amen he said remember the holy spirit will only recognize the covenant people are you in the covenant are you in the word the holy ghost will only recognize those that are hungry and thirsting for the word amen he said we find that death was ready to strike egypt at any time and god had showed them his grace his power and his signs and i want you to know that that's followed every revival grace power and signs he's a grace to come to the people power to make himself known and the sign of the times god's revealing it in you and me oh brother we're not here just going out here just to reflect and and be a witness for this church no no it's a witness for jesus witness for the word is a witness for the resurrection a witness for the rapture what god is doing churches for the most part today they're there representing what god has done but how many are representing what god is doing that's tremendous oh yeah there's even message churches and they're based on what god did what god did god did this god did that in in in the ministry of william branham in this ministry that ministry but what is he doing now again i mentioned it i don't know what was to do i might have been brother jonathan but uh or my other brother ed cater i was talking on the phone where the prophet of god said he said you ministers you referred to us back then you young ministers he said you ordained to take this message on to the coming of the lord not god set a prophet but it's not we've already been through that that's passed where are we now after all those years since the prophet has been gone where are we now what are we doing what is god doing he said you young ministers ordained to take the message on to the coming of the lord are we doing that god help us grace amen again he said listen he said you could take that one scripture there and run it around and around for 10 weeks and never leave it and he said i would symbolize three stages that we have come through it would symbolize the three mercies of god and he said through he said it was oh yeah he said there was martin luther he said and so on to pentecost and he said on down wesley each of the three stages of the journey and he said amen the three stages of israel's journey three messengers to sodom all these different things and he said it would symbolize the ministry of today it would symbolize the message of billy graham grace to the world or robert's power to the world he said the presence of jesus christ as the last sign to the world that was billy graham or roberts william branham he brought that in another message he said there has been three witnesses to the world and he said billy graham oral roberts and william branham billy graham did this oral roberts did this and william branham was doing that so he said he said symbolize the message of billy graham he said grace to the world he was preaching the grace of god for the salvation of their souls oral roberts oh yeah he came forth with the signs and wonders ministry i remember because i i can remember back in those days yeah i lived experienced it yeah even to even to i lived to see that time when when oral roberts was taken off the scene and wow many were shocked when we received the news that oral roberts was gone god had took him off the scene what oral roberts why because he represented such a powerful signs and wonders ministry around the world yeah but william branham yeah he had signs and wonders too but you've got to understand that oral roberts went on and on and on in his sons and wonders ministry but when it comes to brother branham it was it was the he had three he had three pulls and he went through the first the second and then oh and he had to leave as it were oh god allowed to do this god allowed him to do that one poor he said now he said brother brown you got to do this first and second paul get the people to believe believe what healing no that was oral roberts to believe the word because the first and second pull signs in one nurse amen but the third bull was the opening of the word now he said brother brown get the people to believe god help us amen billy graham did what he was ordained to do amen or roberts did any what he was ordained to do and the prophet of god did what he was ordained to do so he said again billy graham of grace to the world or roberts the power to the world of the presence of jesus christ as the last sign to the world amen for the sodomies of god their last sign the church spiritual he said the one that was called out got their last sign before the gentile world was burned and jesus said so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said the same thing amen and he said we find out that these great things had been displayed in egypt and they were displayed in the world god have mercy on us brother he said the end and just think what's god requiring now god's requiring us to believe the word god and what and not just just don't just say oh it's the bible i believe it no in the word where god is working now the resurrection the rapture pentecost believed this others believed that others believed that but now brother has been a calling out of the bride to believe for the resurrection and rapture and brother ram highlighted this in the rapture message yeah he said the third pole the third pole we saw that was the only word yes but he said the third poll was to bring and give us rapturing faith amen go read the rapture message he one sign did this once on another sign did that but brother want to come to the opening of the word amen praise the lord it was to give us the faith that we need for the rapture and he said we see in the church where grace has went forth to call them and we see he said where the power has been demonstrated by the pentecostal group and bring back again the baptism of the holy ghost and he said we have seen the supernatural power of the identification of jesus christ himself standing in our midst he is among us he said listen the first thing they got to go through identify that the howard was at hand a prophet with the message moses came with a message the word of god was with moses the next thing he said moses had to be identified and he was identified by a pillar of fire and the same thing that happened today the same thing the word of god has been brought to us the pillar of fire is among us identifying jesus christ raised from the dead the same yesterday today forever and the assurance of the baptism of the holy ghost amen the baptism of the holy ghost upon our hearts and putting our love to god the all glory he said the exodus is on again for the rise the rapture to go out amen he said today is the calling out of the bride out of the church the exodus for the rapture amen are we ready for the rapture are we more conscious of the rapture not just oh god sent a prophet he had signs and wonders what a miraculous ministry amen we saw this we saw that amen what was what was it for oh just to get us to believe and keep going on no to get us to believe and going to rapture going to resurrection it's to get us out of here because it's the finish it's the end amen as he had to get the people to believe moses and to believe moses ministry in egypt amen what was the significance of it it was to bring him out of egypt what's the significance of this ministry now the problem of god is bringing it out here amen what's the significance of it is to get us out of here into the rapture god's requirement of you again he said today is the calling out of the bride the exodus for the rapture god help us bear with me oh just a few minutes he said there should be such a hunger to get to church and he said there should be such a hunger for us to get to one another it should be a love affair yeah i tell you in the early days you consider the revival in the early days of luther considered the revival of the spirit that was on them morning noon and night and yeah there was a time when even john wesley would preach five five times a day preach five times a day was time when when brother john wesley he would go to church to preach but there's the church wasn't big enough to keep keep the crowd and where where did he preach he he preached outside and what did he stand on he went and stood upon a tombstone because for the most part in those days graveyards were around around the churches and so he just went to the cemetery the graveyard and he stood up on a high i guess a large tombstone there and he preached and all and then all the all the believers were just standing around the church wasn't big enough and he preached five times a day and went on to william booth he would preach and preach and preach and preach yeah well we just wouldn't stop salvation army pentecost oh my morning noon and night pentecostal revival and pentecost went around the world preaching god help us now brother it's come down to the bride but the thing of it is the bride revival is getting much much smaller god help us he said listen he said that's the way the church ought to be just seeing that power of god and he said what it's done for us we should be counting the moments and he said getting together in love that we can fly away someday to meet jesus amen and it says he will appear the second time to all those that love is appearing he said who love and are longing for his appearing now and you're loving it and longing for it it is a love affair and now we ought to love one another because we are fellow citizens in the same body and we should have loved one for another and he said warning us the time is at hand and believers should be separating themselves from the things of the world separate themselves from the cares of this world and he said that's the reason i hammer at women and so forth and he said then he said separate yourself from tv programs separate yourself from this hollywood evangelism and he said come back to deepness and sincerity amen he said we stand in the pulpit jump up and down laugh and holler and carry on and women dance over the floors clothes on them real skin tight and all kinds of jewelry and stuff hanging on and he said bug there and some of them with makeup on and he said they got a oh yeah he said they got an intellectual pastor and he said they're a preacher that can put the word together so perfect but he said that isn't it he said we don't come to the altar of god laughing carrying on and cutting up we come to the altar with sincerity and deepness because there we are dying amen we don't go he said to death laughing and jolly he said if you've got your right mind it's an insane person that would do that now if you're sincere you're going to be really sincere amen not laughing and jolly he said no no he said with sincerity and deepness by the grace of god he said people is not ready to confess they want to pray and god you heal me do this do this lord yeah that's probably god said he said see you know what your problem is he said you want god he said but you only want god for what he can do for you what you can do for god god help us and you want god to heal you you want god to do this but when it comes to dying out and confessing your sins and getting right with god it does it seems it isn't seen no more isn't seen no more no no he said that's the reason we don't see no more healings than what we have that's the reason i'm preaching these things let get let get let's get things ready for a healing service you have got to get the thing working first god heals you for his glory and we must be ready for his glory amen he said get all the filthy of your house and he said put all the leaven out every bit he said you can have no leaven and when this mark has come upon your house this token he said you cannot have 11 in it amen listen he said we've got to come to sincerity and he said and there die as dead as we can amen that the blood of jesus christ and the token can come upon us it makes a person a different person amen a woman can come up get up from there and go away and she wants to obey every scripture amen that's in the bible regardless of what takes place a man and a man the same way amen if you really got god in you the anointing of god in you amen your emphasis is on the word you give the word preeminence amen listen he said to come to the altar with dry hide confession is a tradition he said you should die there to your sacrifice as you identify yourself that you are dead amen that you are buried in christ amen and the world is dead behind you amen and you're to walk in a new life with christ amen in his resurrection loving his word and taking his word amen so we see that we are living down at the last hours and the believers must accept all the word amen he said we're not to come together to talk about the message we are to come together to get in the message amen let's get in the message let's get the message in us amen and the message is it is christ he is the word and we we're to get into the word he said get beneath it he said that's what we're supposed to do amen we know that as brother brown was getting near the end of his ministry and this was november 1963 and especially after the opening of the seals brother began to put more and more and more emphasis on the life of the bride separation unto the lord put more and more emphasis on the resurrection the rapture the coming of the lord amen but more and more episodes of the bride and what god was requiring of her this grace if the life of jesus christ lives in the person they become identified with him remember it is christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the holy ghost is the token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture and the promise is written in there amen you are not yourself no more you are christ and you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts amen it's christ the life that was in christ is in you amen i trust by grace that it's true let's prove it when we go out the door let's prove it when we wake in the morning let's prove it through the day morning noon and night is jesus in control are we following jesus leadership are you spiritual not religious there's many a believer out there and whether they're very religious but not spiritual as i remember years and years and years ago and i was just by just a young man then and we were we're in a church having service it's amazing the church was full and i'm sure there might have maybe 300 or close to maybe to 400 in the church but not all of them were believers because they had come for another reason concerning i think it might have been a memorial service or for for a brother that had died and many individuals that he worked with and that worked with them also came to the church service it was amazing but the anointing was there and by grace that the pastor had asked me to control the service when it comes to this the song services not the ministry of the word but after the ministry of the world again and so on now remember that we did make an altar call and for believers to come and pray and so on and they came up came up came up and i remember and i was moving back and forth that we were singing and praising the lord and oh and there was a a couple of believers came and they were among all the crowd they were stood up and i said oh lord i said i said they don't have the holy spirit lord i said they got something wrong with them i said they don't have the victory and they were they were there stood up and seemingly worshipping and so on no i said lord there's something wrong i shall leave him with you and it wasn't long after that might have been a few months or a year or so that i discovered that both had gone back into the world and it surprised everyone but it didn't surprise me why because that because it was a spirit that i was discerning yeah but god was in the service because like i said there was a lot of unbelievers there but they respected us and as i said after the service we were out and we were greeting everybody and and one of those gentlemen came back and he said always said excuse me he said thank you and i said oh i said you're welcome i said glad you came i said we just wanted to honor that our brother always said listen he said i just want to let you know he said you know i said he said this is this was one of the best church services he said i ever experienced i said what oh yes he said i thought it was wonderful he said a wonderful feeling there i said yeah i said well thank the lord i said give the glory to god. well he said thank you he said he said i just want to let you know he said i've never experienced that before i said oh i said it's wonderful that's encouraging i said we're doing it for the glory of god okay sid thank you and that person was a politician that's right but he had come just just because he knew this person that had died and the memorial service were having for him and they come out of respect for him but he said thank you praise the lord brother let's be in the spirit by the grace of god amen listen he said he said what we need today is a refreshing he said we need a baptism of the holy spirit back in the church not a celebration he said what we need is the feeling of the holy ghost amen listen he said i am trying to press upon your minds friend that our has struck that something has got to be done and we must do something it's either in or out and he said that's all he said the hours come he said where the token must be there and he said if this church ever expects to remain alive until jesus christ comes he said the token will have to be there we need the token the power the anointing of the life of the blood of jesus in you grace to us he said when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit then the life of jesus christ is within you and now he said that's true every theologian will have to admit that and he said to me it's the new birth by the grace of god amen now he said when you want eternal life he said you receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it is the life of the blood in you brother there's many putting the emphasis on the life on the blood but how many have the life of the blood grace i've had to finish with this couple of paragraphs here and again the message is called the token november 1963 he said you man he said likewise i am through with drinking i am through with smoking i am through with lying i am through with jokes i am through with jesting i am through with all these idol words that the bible said will give an account for i want the seal i want the token in my life i am laying my hands by faith right now upon my sacrifice jesus christ i am identifying myself as a dead man or a dead woman boy or girl i die now with him because he died that i can live and he said i am accepting my life in him and oh lord make it known to me tonight that eternal life now dwells within me and he said think those thoughts believe those things let this entire group of people standing here he said up and down he said around the place let them all take that deeply and sincerely he said you will see a healing meeting that you've never seen before and he said when this starts and he said what we need now is healing of our soul what we need now is a faith that's something in us that takes a whole of the word amen that when you see the word make made real just speak the word and it'll be so is it like the romans said to jesus speak the word only and it will be so amen god's grace to us to speak the word to believe the word god's grace with us amen to stay with the word amen and to give the word preeminence in our hearts in our souls in our everyday living amen how many of us go through the day and thinking about the word thinking the word how many of us go through the day oh that's right lord that's what that's what you said in the bible yeah that's what you said yeah i remember lord you know it's it's right there yeah it's right there lord maybe in the book of ruth or the book of deuteronomy oh it's right there lord yeah matthew yeah mark yeah we've got matthews and marx here we got luke yeah john amazing we got them all here so we pray the grace of god they can identify with matthew mark and luke and john in the bible by the grace of god hallelujah god help us brother sister to stay with the word god help us to make our calling election sure by the word help us to give preeminence to the word morning noon and night i tell you if you got the holy ghost there's no way you can get up in the morning not think about the word the holy spirit you bring this to your remembrance you'll bring that to your remembrance oh yeah you will through the day and you're doing this you're doing that you think about the word you think of this you think of that oh yeah the bible says this the bible says that oh the prophet said this the prophet said that because the holy ghost is constantly dealing with us in the word amen to make us more and more conscious of the word give preeminence to the word amen because i tell you the only ones going in the rapture are those in whom the words got preeminence the word got control morning noon and night grace well yeah they can call you fanatical or whatever you're just religious fanatic your religion says yeah well praise the lord i am pleased to praise the
