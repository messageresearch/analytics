can't turn back I've turned away from sin [Music] Wow I reached the pool I've reached the point of no return I've reached the point of no return a man you believe it that way this morning nothing to go back to Amen praise the Lord we just appreciate the wonderful presence of the Lord here this morning in the presence of the Lord last night just to be able to enjoy the good Word of God and these things don't come from us they come from the word and the opening of the word and the seven seals being open to us and to be able to enjoy that it's our inheritance it's our food it's what the Lord has given us and so that's why we enjoy it so much we were living in a special time and so we're thankful once again thank you for inviting us brother Gerald is our last service although I were in wrestling with the angel here last night quite a bit and this morning of what two preachers now that I'm into the flow of it there's so many more things that I wanted to preach amen so we should stay another week and have service every night it would be nice it's nice but we just been trying to get the focus of the Lord and mind of the Lord for this morning so many wonderful things that we want to be able to share with you but we just want to thank say thank you once again for the hospitality and we just thank you that we can come and have friends we have several young people here that have attended our retreat and it's good to see you and be a participator in those things we remember you remember your participation and young people they're serving God as an example to the younger ones and we appreciate you going on with the Lord trust that you've reached the point of no return and so we are glad to be able to share our lives with you in those ways and then sister Kim as well and to see her in a good Church here using her gifts it's a great honor for me as a pastor be able to send young people like this to other places to be able to serve the Lord in good churches like this it's a gives me great joy to see her here and in just serving the Lord this way so I know she's an asset to you here so we appreciate appreciate very much we have I just will mention to you for the glory of the Lord we last 5 years our main mission work every church that's a church should be involved in some type of mission work and I know that you are here because you're always in the will of God when you're given to missions and helping spread the message so about five years ago would put it on my heart and brother Doug Baker's heart from Tucson to finish the message to entirely in Spanish so we launched the project about five years ago we hired several translators around the world some of them full-time some of them part-time and we thought the project would take just two years well it's been five years but here in a couple months we are only about 25 messages short now we'll finish those in the next few months of finishing the entire message in Spanish a spanish-language second or third largest language in the world it's the most downloaded message such a demand for it and so I you can imagine how I'm going to feel in a couple months when that project is done and we'll be able to know that they can enjoy the message the spanish-speaking people just as much as us in English they can be able to do the search program and all these other things available to us in the entirety of the message in Spanish so we thank the Lord for that it was also a very expensive project but the Lord has provided all the funds as well and he took care of us that way as well so we're thankful we just want to give glory to the Lord I don't know what the Lord will have doing for us next there's many needs around the world many different languages and things but would just be praying for his leadership and and we trust that you're involved in something here to be able to help with that little as much when God is in it little as much when God is in it and a small portion that you do and even that you give can go to help someone to come closer to the Lord and the message of the hour I think we should have our part in that participation in that praise the Lord well we're going to stand and read a scripture this morning if you would don't mind standing again we're going to read from Joshua chapter 1 just a few verses of Scripture and to set a set us in the right channel this morning and certainly enjoy last night to be able to enjoy the that subject and be able to cover that with trusted administered each of you in a special way amen and so we're going to continue a little bit in the subject of maturity as we've been the entire weekend we're gonna stay in that vein but just a little different channel to it and we're gonna speak about the transition here from Moses to Joshua a very very important transition to go from Moses to Joshua to go from the Prophet to the prophecy and we're in those transitions and those so they're important to talk about Joshua chapter 1 and verse 1 says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel so even in the first two verses here you can see the transition that God is moving the people to from Moses singular to them the people so it's moving from the prophet Moses and you remember the purpose and God sending the Prophet was to bring the people all of them into they're individual tribes and individual lands and their inheritance that God promised them that was the purpose in God's ending Moses we know that Moses brought them out of Egypt we know that Moses did mighty signs and wonders we know there was a whole focus there of God leading his children in a certain way and they were 40 years in the wilderness but the main purpose and God sending a prophet was to bring the people to their promised land and you'll notice in that did not stop after Moses was dead Moses ministry was finished but the commission of the Joshua Commission was to finish what the message was meant to do and that's to bring them as he says the children of Israel now the focuses is not Moses Moses my servant is dead but the focus is right now now that he's gone arise and let's finish this work let's go into our land and so you can see that you can see yourselves in this scripture because we realize the focus is not on the prophet as much as it is now taking the message and bringing the people into their individual here inheritance that's a huge change so if you wouldn't mind let's add in chapter 5 and verse 10 and I don't know if I'll get to this but let's add it in so we can refer to it if we get time Joshua chapter 5 and verse 10 and the children of Israel in encamped Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month that even the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the self-same day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year so the diet of these believers now after Moses was gone the diet had changed where for forty years they ate manna now they're eating the old corn so the diet had changed even so many changes amen father bless your word today we pray that you'll help us that you encouraged us that you encouraged the brokenhearted that you'd strengthened the believers here Lord and God that you'd through the Word of God just annoying it Lord and coming close and personal to us this morning so we commit this service to you in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you we realize anything that we do in Jesus name that's an important thing and we do this in Jesus name today and do it in his name praise the Lord so in the changes that we want to look at from Josh from Moses to Joshua and I'm sure your pastor is ministered on these things and you've heard other ministers refer to the Joshua Commission and that's that originates out of the message as the Prophet preached as I was with Moses so will I be with thee and the Prophet begin to notice that even in his own ministry as he was moving from the first and second pole as I was as Moses God led the prophets Joshua chapter 1 and he read that Scripture because we're starting to see the beginning stages of a transition in the message from the first and second pole to the third pole and so people don't realize how big a transition that is people I think sometimes don't realize how many changes took place from Moses to Joshua in that well how it would affect the people people wouldn't realize that it's the same mighty God that's leading the message it's the same mighty God that's leading the people the same God that worked through what he did through Moses is the same God here today working in his people to accomplish and finish Redemption and to bring us back to what we're called - so now we've been on that subject the whole weekend but we want to elaborate on it in the in the subject of Moses and Joshua it's very important that we see a sons and daughters of God no matter who we are it's very important that we understand this transition and today I want to respectfully but clearly and plainly talk about it a little bit so that we understand and why do we talk about these things it's because that we might catch these things and live under the correct expectations for God now remember I said the first night that we want to be under the right expectations we don't want to be looking for something that's already past we want to look for the expectation now for what God has for us now if we linger in the past under the days of the past we fall short of taking our land if in the days of Moses they wanted to go back to the days of Moses they fall short of taking their own land so that's how important it is that it holds us back when we look back and look back and look back it keeps us from our promise and so and and I want to make this point because we've been talking about maturity it is in maturity to stay back and not move on with this transition it is great spiritual maturity to cling back to the days of Moses can you say and you understand what I'm saying it's huge in maturity to clean back to the days of the wilderness and Moses and all that it's in maturity just want to stay back there to some people it's a security blanket they feel better if I can just stay talking about the days of Moses it's a security blanket and you feel safe in that but it's not really safe because you if you lay back there and stay in that day you'll die spiritually you will die spiritually if you stay back in the days of Moses because why the pillar fire is moving on message is moving on amen so the people had to catch the change in Joshua Commission back then and today we have to catch it too people have to be amateur people to take be able to take this on that's what I've been preaching it takes amateur people it takes the message maturing but it takes amateur people to take to latch onto this and that's why we're praying this weekend and I've been praying with you Lord mature me take all my immature knees out Lord let me look at this message the way I'm supposed to look at it let me not reach back to some security blanket of yours even brother Graham said about your experience he says if you're experienced your testimony is that the Lord gave me the Holy Ghost 30 years ago and that was the last time he says he said your back slid the Prophet said that he said you ought to be able to say my experiences fresh with me right now amen thank God for what he did 30 years ago but the your experience is how close are you to the Lord today so in the wilderness we had a people following a prophet following the message but in the wilderness the people had huge immaturity how many know that and I was in the office I jotted a few down because I forgot to type them in but I thought what were some of the immaturity sand won't be we'll all be speaking a lot about these today but I jotted some down of course the children of Israel under a prophet in the message were murmurers were complainers they murmured in their tents which today would be their houses they talked about things that they shouldn't talk about they gossiped they tore people down they tore Moses down they talked about things they it was an immaturity in them I think we ought to grow out of those immaturity they were negative they were disrespectful in their tents they were disrespectful sometimes to Moses they were disrespectful sometimes to one another they were sign seekers can you say Amen if there wasn't a sign going on then they got disappointed wanting to go back to Egypt if there wasn't something supernatural God they got disappointed I want to go back to Egypt that's immaturity God sees that as immature children God can perform the supernatural God can do it anytime he still does it today but we as Christians cannot depend on that all the time to keep us in the faith and they followed a sin and Korah Dathan cornrows approves the disrespect towards Moses we've seen that spirit rise up the last five or six years especially in the message a disrespect from Dathan and Korah and so then and then the children of Israel immature that one day there one day they're thinking about going back to Egypt and talking about going back to Egypt can you imagine come out with a prophet brought out of denominations in the world and when they win the tough times hit and emotional times if they're entertaining thoughts and saying maybe we should go back to Egypt you know what that is it's immaturity its babies spiritually God wants the people that are all in God wants the people that's reached the point of no return God wants to hear the faith to say I don't care what happens I don't care if I ever see another miracle again I don't care if God ever shows his presence again Jimmy I'm all-in and I'm gonna carry this thing out by the grace of God if I don't feel God I don't have to feel God I love to feel God but if I don't have to feel them I'm gonna continue serving them anyway that's what God wants to hear hey man that's maturity into faith can you say man and so what one day they're thinking go back to Egypt but another thing the next day they would they were their emotions just sewing everywhere and for one day then the next you didn't know where they stood and one day they're wanting to go back and evening the next day get excited about a miracle and now they're all in there ready to follow Moses again these are immature T's they were up and down with their emotions but I think the greatest immaturity and the children of Israel is their dependence upon a prophet as their attachment to God and I hope I said that right and today I might say some things that I I'm praying that I pray that I say them respectfully because nobody believes that God sent a prophet and this is God's prophet for the hour William Graham nobody believes they're stronger than I do I believe it with all my heart I'll never disrespect that but I want to say some things today I want to say I'm respectfully that the children is are one of their immaturity ziz their dependence on having to have that prophet having to have him there and if he's not there having to talk about when he was there and to keep that going and to keep in that realm it's a security blanket can you say men and those in the wilderness they could not have survived without Moses they had a lack of faith they were fearful they were up and down and so their dependence was on the Prophet and when God moved him into the Promised Land they had to die to that immaturity because Moses was no longer around and there had to be an individual faith rise to take their land it's like God has given something to you but it's not gonna come easy to you you're gonna have to fight for it and Moses won't be around I've given the Holy Ghost Joshua to encourage you to lead your right path but you've got to stand on your own two feet and you've got to take your individual leg because this isn't about standing around glorifying of what God does through a prophet it's looking to see what's God going to do through me now it's my inheritance what's my life in Christ hey man everybody on board this morning praise be to God so now is Mirman complaining but the worst thing is the dependence on that prophet let me just step back here and see now when we entered the days of the message when God sent a prophet in this hour just like Moses day it was a change when a voice came to call us out of the world and out of Egypt and out of denominations that was a great transition in Scripture Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30 all these things that our scripture for the last days that was a transition that was a movement in scripture and all of us observed it many were here back when that took place actually when the Prophet was here it's nice to have the two generations here worshiping the same Lord can you say man we got ones that were in brother branham's meetings who got ones that followed and watched all that huge transition of God blessing us was a major prophet to this earth but we've moved on from those days and I think each generation has to respect one another can you say man oh thank god not every but not all the old people died in the wilderness just in that there was a there was a Joshua and Caleb and Caleb got old can you say man but he's seen the transition and he's wanting to go get his land hazel or Caleb all caught up in Moses he said no no I want to go get my land I want that mountain and he was an old guy so you had the young guys and they had their old guys but as long as they were led by the Holy Ghost they're gonna all go get their land and when you see that happen it's a blessed thing taking place nothing worse than the old ones trying to pull the people back to the days of Moses nothing worse than that young people don't want to go there the young generation don't want to go there we want to move forward nothing worse than the old people trying to take us back to the days of Moses but it's also nothing worse than the young people disrespecting the older generation amen praise the Lord these things I didn't put in my notes I'm just saying they're coming from somewhere praise the Lord so if I don't stay with my notes though we we won't get very far I learned 45 minutes last night my you can tell I'm right at home here that's for sure yeah so much hay on my fork and the farmer that had you know there was a farmer that was asked you know one time he came to church and he attended church and there was nobody there but just the preacher and the farmer nobody showed up and so the preacher got up and he said what do i do today nobody's here the farmer says well said when I go out to feed my feed my cows or whatever he says so if only one comes around I feed him you know I feed him anyway and so the preacher took his text and he preached just as hard as if a thousand people were there and preached and farmers said Amen he was the only one there you know preached about 9:45 minutes just like I did last night preached everything he knew and some things he didn't know he come out and shook the preachers hand because it shipped the farmers in because it was the only one to shake hands with just Illman he said well how did I do farmer says well he says I know when I go out and feed my cows he says I feed him even if one shows up but I don't feed him the whole barn a hay so he got his point across again that's how I feel there's just so much to preach praise the Lord so you know when we entered that change I don't want to spend too much time on it but it was a great movement to see the Prophet come on of the scenes and we have that was a shadow of the Prophet coming in the last days because we received a prophet on the level of Moses that was a shadow and because it's a shadow in the Old Testament remember Paul said the Old Testament was shadows and types in Hebrews he said that there were shadow of things to come and so if you have a shadow and it's a real true scriptural shadow then the real is coming and you can't work around your shadows can you say man that's the problem with message churches any churches and a lot of noise is they work outside of the shadows and interpret the Bible themselves you can't work outside the shadows and types if God sent a prophet before he can send a prophet again you have no right to take that out of the scripture and say he could bring prophets all through the Bible even balsa prophet but he can't do it today you have no right to do that who died and made you interpreter of the word a man so you can't get around the shadows and the shadow moses shows a prophet coming taking us out of egypt which meant presents the world any bible scholar tell you that egypt represents the world it represents bondage of not only the bondage of the world but bondage of denominations the people of god under the bondage of domination how does God get them out of that he sends a prophet so that you're not going to work around your shadows can you say man and so there's a transition that we see under Moses coming calling us out of Egypt bringing us the word to live by and and there's other places in the Old Testament that show that so the people were in bondage after 400 years a time for a deliverance came God called Moses to the desert gave them a commission gave them two signs now as I'm talking about this you can see the shadows of Moses happen exactly like they did today four hundred years of bondage time for deliverance God calls a prophet gives him two signs he rose in faith to the challenge of Pharaoh holding God's children bodies said let my people go and and so then then they came out of Egypt by a mighty hand of God they were in the journey of the wilderness for forty years signs and wonders followed that great message ministry but then after that the word was given from the mountain to the people and when the word was given there was a cloud on the mountain Exodus 24 and then right after the cloud appears the word comes to the people right after the cloud and and so that this goes back to the time of the end time when the seals are open and and the opening the word comes to his people so I can go on and on to show you the shadows are perfectly to bring us to what happened today even with the cloud can you say man so I didn't preach on that we've already observed and seen those things take place and but something after that after many years there's a reality of something happening and it wasn't it wasn't Moses that fulfilled the final purpose of God's people so stay with the shadows now if the Bible would have read that Moses himself as a man would have been the one that lead the people in the promised land and finished the message then we would have seen that in the Bible but we can't get around the shadows and types and the shadow says that Moses my servant is dead now Joshua take up the people and take him into their life can't get around the shadows can you say men and so we find in this stark reality that that Moses now died and never went into the Promised Land himself at least at least back in that day never physically went into the promised land and so we're coming to a very critical point here and I'd like you to put your seatbelts on spiritually and I'm going to say some shaking things so now who now when Moses was in the wilderness do you know that there was those whose hearts were back in Egypt they wanted to go back and so they stayed on many of them but they were miserable and then when the spies went to view the land there was those who were too afraid to go they were happy staying in what they thought was a safe place in the wilderness under the Prophet now I know these points are simple but I want you to catch them there were people that were perfectly content staying in the wilderness they were in the message and they were content to stay there they felt that was their safe place but I'm telling you God has called this bride to something else [Applause] but there were people like that and Jesus said in John 649 they they says mole he says they died in the wilderness your father's died in the wilderness Jesus spoke to a religious people and said your father's ate manna in the wilderness and are dead he spoke to those that were disbelieving stayed in the wilderness under the prophets message they ate manna in the wilderness they're dead they died in the wilderness so no matter if a person comes under this by birth or by being a witness to it if they don't come with Joshua we can make the point if you don't move on with Joshua death sets in spiritual death sets in to our lives if we don't move on with the Joshua Commission really under a prophet under prophets message in a message church spiritual death can set in to a message Church I've seen it I've seen it friends and why is it you don't move on with the pillar of fire you don't move on to the Joshua Commission spiritual death they all died in the wilderness under Moses under a prophet spiritual death can set in a host died in there and some of us and so that can happen today spiritually people can die spiritually and not even realize their day because there's a safety zone they try to stay in of just talking about Moses and being under his leadership and did you know if you read your Bible you know some wept for days when he died they just wept and wept and wept and they wanted to stay there and they wanted Moses to come back and same thing happened with Elijah when Elijah went up in a chariot there were men that come around Elijah and says we think we know where Elijah is that we're gonna go find him would you go with us these things are right in the scripture you believers watch these things in the message take place these things return ministry all these it's right in the Bible they're so caught up and that's such a safety zone for them that the only hope for this is to get Moses backer to find Elijah to go find him he's gonna come back he's gonna and they were all at the gravesite in 1965-66 and Easter looking for him to come back why they're too tied to Moses and too tied to the prophets ministry these things are real they happen looking for a lot we're gonna go find Elijah and Elijah said you know you're not gonna find him but he already knew a double portion of his spirited come on him so this is no reason disrespect to Elijah but is that they people can't realize the first scripture in Joshua one if they would get a revelation of the first line in Joshua one look at your Bible read what it says that people need a revelation over the first line in Joshua one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord how about the first line of verse to Moses my servant is dead now friends I say this respectfully God uses live ministry can you say man and God by His grace today news technology to not not to get just the personality of the Prophet but to hold the word there on tape and on CD and all these things because it was stored up food for us because we're not going to get into a promised land without the food the word he said is part of how we're getting in there can you say man so I'm not against the food I'm just saying that Moses my servant is dead people people today don't even have a revelation to see that transition Moses my servant God says he was my servant but he's dead he's finished his course he's been faithful everybody still like me people today don't realize brother Branham is dead now he's not really dead he's sleeping because he was a believer which I believe he is he's gonna come up in the resurrection can you believe that but God's saying here you could have said that about Moses so he's gonna come back he did he come back in with Jesus transfer Transfiguration is in another body we understand that but God said it my servant is dead and now it's time to go on and finish what this message is so if you try to stay back in the days of Moses in his personality you're gonna have a problem in the first two verses he's trying to get the people to transition away from that because they'll never be able to take faith to finish this and come into their own land if they keep glorifying Moses can you say Amen so we see then that that somewhat for days when Moses was gone only two of all that coming to the message went in with Joshua can you say Amen as soon as he died right away God opens the Commission Moses my servant is dead and as soon as he said that he opens up the Joshua Commission he said Joshua take the people under their land he didn't waste no time it wasn't an I don't want to spend another 40 years here God said no no he didn't waste no time he's fulfilled his course my servant has fulfilled his course he's done his work right now it's time right now to take up and take the people into their land no more 40 years it's time to go now oh praise the Lord maybe you're feeling that this weekend hey man you're feeling that in your heart it's time now for you to take your land praise the Lord so somebody said a few months ago somebody quoted it says the only thing that Joshua did was pointed the people to Moses listen now you think about that statement somebody said this the other day on the Internet the only thing that Joshua did was pointed the people to Moses that's not true that's not the only thing Joshua did now did they read Moses yes did they get together after a battle after they won ai they got together and read the whole book of Moses they stayed in the message but to say that the only thing that Joshua did was pointed the people back to Moses that's a lie that's not true that's that person that said that doesn't even have a revelation of the Joshua Commission and brother Branham had a revelation of the Joshua Commission he was in the initial stages of it by the word that came through him was to begin the Joshua Commission but then he passed away and died can you say man but the Holy Ghost would take the people on to the rest of this and so you cannot say that the only thing Joshua did was point of the people to Moses our to listen to Moses that wasn't the only thing it wasn't good enough just to sitting to listen to Moses if that was the shadow then Joshua would say the only thing left to do is to sit here and listen to Moses Joshua was saying Joshua yes we do listen to the message but we're not gonna sit here and that's the only thing we do to the rapture we're gonna get up and fight this battle amen and so it's an effort to and that when people say that it's an effort to continue an emphasis on Moses it's safer for some people because we know that God works through the Prophet God supernaturally worked through you and that's wonderful and I love to hear the testimonies and I love to hear the reports I love to be around men that were with him I love that I would never disrespect it I was around Perry green quite a bit and he was around brother Branham Allah he's gone on now many of those brothers have gone on but I loved listening to it but I can never come into my full inheritance just by listening to what God did through William Branham that's not my ticket into a rapture I'll never make a rapture by listening to that if it builds my faith praise the Lord you know when I got the Holy Ghost at 16 you know the Lord touched my heart and received the Holy Ghost I don't know about you but I after that I developed an incredible craving to hear the word of God and I think someone who gets the Holy Ghost that's what they do I knew I grew up in this message world when I got the Holy Ghost the difference was for me is that I know mom and dad have said it I've heard it quoted but I got a craving to hear it for myself and this is what I concluded I said if God was gracious enough to send a prophet on the level of Moses or greater to my generation in my own language then if God took the time to do that then I can take the time as a young 16 year old man to find out what he said and the next three or four five years of my life people didn't see me a lot because basically I worked I came home I did my school then when I was out of school I brought tapes home out of the library to church and I just fed on this message for about four or five years that's all I did because I thought if God sent him I ought to take the time to find out what he said but when I studied it and when I and then it opened the Bible to me it will open the word to me I come closer to Jesus Christ and for me I didn't just see the glorious works that God did for you William Branham I got a hold of a faith to realize what is God gonna do through me because if he can do it through William Branham he can do it through me and I don't know how people don't some people don't catch that because they're good enough just to hear what what God did through brother Brent I didn't catch all that I realized in reading that and built my faith to realize when he's finished when his work is finished which he was by that time then it created faith in me to realize that the same God is still alive leading his people what is in this for me what's my part [Applause] praise the Lord but he died Moses died his commission was over Moses Commission was done you can't find any shout or even words from Joshua that say put moment we need to put Moses back in the pulpit you can't find the words from Joshua we need to put Moses back in the pulpit or we need to put brother branham back in the pulpit there's no shadow for that there's no direction for that there's nothing there that shows us that's the next step it's a bit of a deception if not a full deception and I have my personal opinions on that but I'm gonna keep them to myself but I'm staying with the scripture here I'm staying with the scripture you know your Joshua saying that it's time that we put the Moses back in the pulpit no no no no God's taking his people on not leaving the word now not leaving the message not leaving the word but the word that he said comes into the heart of his bride by the Holy Ghost and takes us on to our individual land and if we stay back in the old days will dry up and die we'll die spiritually can you say Amen so Moses did not take the people into the land that's the shadow and he could not do it as that as he died he could not do it first of all he couldn't do it cuz he died he couldn't take the people on because God uses live ministry he couldn't take the people in the bronze line cuz he died but we know the other reason that he had a temper there or whatever and God said kept him out of the promised land we understand he made a mistake prophet the prophet made a mistake prophets make mistakes when they're speaking thus saith the Lord it's the infallible Word of God but as a human being they can make mistakes [Applause] a man so Moses did not fulfill the final commission of placing the people but the word that he gave and the Holy Ghost leadership under Joshua placed the people in the promised land this transition is so crucial that we understand can you say ma'am what a crucial transition to make all this under the same message that's coming the last days this is so important because that I I preached here to our new generation that's coming up who was not even here when the Prophet was here it would be a disservice for me to try to teach them to live back in the days of Moses and look back and though I would do a disservice to those young people to try it if you just relive all that he'll be fine and you'll make the rapture that's deceiving the young people and that's all the experience you need is just to believe God send a prophet no the devil's believe it's not just that we believe God sent a prophet but that's that we keep believing to find our inheritance of who we are in Christ you have an inheritance in Christ you have a place a position God wants you to be stepping into that and living it out praise the Lord so now there's so much more we can say on this but we want to move along so there's death in there if we stay and not move on with that transition there's life in the Joshua Commission now people are dying left and right friends people are dying sometimes even under this message they're dying and sometimes if you had a lot of signs and wonders people would perk up and say all good we're back in the days of Prophet again they would perk up with signs and wonders I rejoice in signs and wonders but that doesn't make me perk up as much as when I see an individual in this message get so filled with the Holy Ghost that they're living overcoming life every day and they're conquering the devil's in their lives and they've taken their land that's what makes me sit up and take pay attention but if somebody's in and out and they oh they're all in church for several months because signs and wonders took place and then you don't see them for several months because they're discouraged and may leave the message that doesn't make me impress friends it doesn't impress me when they can come and rejoice and hear all the stories but when I see a banner woman in their struggles in their hard times they're battling it out every day because that's our our inheritance is our life in the Holy Ghost every day that's our inheritance our life in the Holy Ghost that's what makes us so we understand let me just say this so so you understand Moses came up in the resurrection with Christ how many believe that he died but he came up in the resurrection with Christ he was there I believe brother Branham will be up in the resurrection and I would be so glad to meet him and shout with him and shake his hand and thank him for the sacrifices probably no other human being in the 20th century made as many sacrifices for the people of God as William Branham did but that's it he's my brother brother Brian's my brother I'll shake his hand I'll thank him for his service I'll thank him for being faithful to the call the same God that was with Moses was in the Prophet and that was a wonderful thing but also he's my brother the same God that was in William Branham is the same God that's in me [Applause] remember Jesus referring to John the Baptist and saying there's not a mirrors of the greater man than John born of woman but then he turns and says but he that's least in the kingdom of God is greater than he so let's not get into glorifying just one in an age above and we're just down here no no he that's least in the kingdom it's greater not greater than a prophets position but in God's eyes all of his sons and daughters come into glory is what God's got in mind God would get no no joy out of just one son coming to adoption it's the whole crop praise the Lord so I'll shake his hand and I would love to meet him and spend eternity with him but brother Branham is my brother he's not my god so Joshua says there's more to this than just reading Moses now you need a greater faith yourself to drive out the enemy now Moses was a law and if in that day it was a law and today it's the opening of the word so the glory of God after Calvary as I said last night it changes us and brings us into full Redemption but Moses was a law for the people to stay in line with but if you would have stayed in that law you stay in a cycle of that law and there are elements to this word that even we've received that brought deliverance in other words what Moses preached were elements of it to bring deliverance and to protect the people there were elements to Moses message that were meant to protect the people from the world can you say mad I'm thankful and there were elements to the message of the hour that were to bring us out of denominations there were elements of this a message that was about the women's dress to show a woman the dignity of a true woman how she dresses how she acts can you say men this message was not to belittle women it's actually to restore to the dignity of what a woman is you know it's the devil that told you that this message is to bring women under bondage that's the devil this it's the complete opposite God's thoughts was bringing God's daughters back in line with truth the true dignity of what a woman is and that's why she needs to be respected it says there proverbs 31 she's to be praised yes she fears God can you say man she doesn't manifest the beauty of the world she manifests the character of God she's to be praised God praises her God praises are you brother should praise her can you say man thank God thank God for women of this hour thank God for these sisters see why do I stop and do this because they don't get enough praise for their stand that they're making can you say man they get preached on a lot and for years in the message that's all we preached out if we get the women line if we give them dress them right they get preached on a lot but they don't get complimented on and so I say these young girls standing with with the the glories of modesty standing is that you know do you know how much of a miracle that is to see these young girls here today and saying out of love for the Lord I want to manifest not what the world's beauty is but to manifest what God said in this generation do you know how what a paradox that is for them to be sitting with you this morning the glory of the Lord upon them Thank You sisters thank you old elderly sisters thank you for your standing many of you been living this for counsel years countless years you've been laughed at you made fun of your in school some of you even laughed at you made it fun we're not there to see that but God seen it and I want to say thank you to all these lovely sisters here this morning let's give them a hand god bless you god bless you we brothers don't know the battle they've been through we don't haven't been laughed at like that so thank you for holding that stand some parts of the message though were to to bring that back some parts of the message just to correct Pentecost some parts of the message to bring us out of Pentecost there's so many elements to the message and emphasis from brother Branham to bring us out of worldliness and out of denominations can you say man and I'm trying to get to this point to show you that but those are things are very important they're still important but to a person who's moved on they don't necessarily need to hear all of that rebuke out of worldliness because there's some mature adults that's moved on they've got the dress in order they've got these other things in order so a message church that continues to every service preach on the woman's dress or the men's dress or worldliness they're not emphasizing all this message you understand you're not going to get the results you're looking for just by doing that because we've moved on to the inheritance of the Lord if we only preached those parts of the message then actually you can put people sometimes under bondage we have to preach the whole counsel of God we have to preach the full word can you say Matt so those were needed for a time and everyone saw the austere I'm a pastor I have to hit things the world in this creeps in and sometimes you got to hit things but I don't take every service on it because that's not the emphasis that's not the weightier matters of the law dress is not the way tears on the way dear me matter of fact it's not even brother Bram says those things how we dress into that he says that's not the kingdom of God he says and do you know that there's certain things that God gives us in the message and in the Bible that are protections for this life only we won't need them when we get to the other side see and so when you talk about the kingdom and building us for a millenium Kingdom people there's certain things we preach to keep us in line and keep us protected here thank God for those things but if I only preach those things that means I'm just staying here I got a preach the faith to get us out of here glory be to his name we've got a priest rapturing say what's my heritage what's what's God building in my character to make me a millennium people ready for the millennium because it'll be a people of the millennium it'll be us that will be ruling and reigning and God's making a people of kings and priests right now to get us ready for the Millennium that's the stuff the bride's got to hear if we're not getting them ready to go to the other side of the rapture in faith and we're just that means we're just gonna stay here I don't want to stay here does anybody want to stay here well if we get all the dress right and all the things right it all perfectly and all the church are just perfect right well that's just staying for a year I'm not rebuke in church order but I'm just saying I'm not staying here for I don't want to stay here forever and just stay here I want a rapturing faith to take my inheritance because brother Brown says when the believers knows his position fully in Christ he'll take a rapture [Applause] and sisters Young says your position is Christ in Christ is more than just wearing a dress more than your hair it's much deeper than that this message is much deeper than hair and dress but it was part of it but if we emphasize you see now that we have to be careful of our emphasis is that okay amen so the transition has come and we're hearing things from the Lord now that call for his people to walk with the Lord under the Joshua Commission not under the Moses Commission but under the Joshua Commission to go to a convention and just play a tape at a convention of the Prophet it's fine it would be fine there's nothing wrong but that's not my full commission that's not the final result of what we're supposed to do that's not my part of the vision my part of the vision is the vision for the last days transitions from Moses Commission to the Joshua Commission and I'm part of that and that's the shadow now I'm living in the real of it can you say man so that that first quote if you if you guys did hear I'm gonna just bring another example up to you of this this transition are you still with me cuz the clock is still gone it's not it's not there amen so brother Graham says this in this first quote and it's the one brother from what is the traction on the mountain and he's referring to John the Baptist there's one standing among you whose shoes I am not worthy to bear John saying this about Jesus he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire as i baptize with water one day an ordinary young man about 30 years old walked down and was baptized and when this man come there was such an attraction by the Prophet the Prophet act strange that day the congregation could help from watching the action of that prophet when he was debating with the priests across the river they said God built this altar God told us to do this Moses is the Prophet we believe Moses the sacrifice will never be done away with I can hear John answer back say have you not read the scripture what Daniel Prophet said the the sacrifice will be done away with and that hour has arrived have you not read that Isaiah said for the chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord Johnson there's two prophecies for me and another thing did you not recognize our prophet 400 years ago Melek I when he spoke in the 3rd chapter and said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way don't you know this fulfills prophecy so now catch it now John what is the attraction on the mountain scripts are being fulfilled so the attraction on the mountain then for John he is pointing to the scriptures four hundred years before that he is fulfilling I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness all right so he refers to that but when jesus walks in that day there was a transition in about that time the prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it's changed from the Prophet to the prophecy [Music] [Applause] sit right there friends that's the transition right there and if we don't catch that we're gonna get lost in the wilderness somewhere we're gonna get lost in the past somewhere right there it changed from the Prophet to the prophecy because he came to introduce Christ right he came into here so a prophet came to introduce Christ the same as he needed it the Prophet was in today to introduce Christ once Christ is there working in his people then it moves the emphases the attraction the attraction changed from the Prophet to the prophecy it's a powerful quote friends it's a powerful thing to say that I don't think he believed Little John the Baptist at all by saying that she got to remember it's John who said later I must decrease he must increase I can no longer be the attraction now I fulfilled my commission I am no longer the attraction he's the attraction we're seeing the attraction today in the bride let me see Christ in the bride that's the attraction on the mountain his word being fulfilled in the bride it changed from the Prophet to his prophecy aren't you glad that we're living in the days not of the Prophet but the days of the prophecy you're living in those days you know this this bride we're walking in the vision a prophet let me just take a little time here not like I'm already doing that I'm already taking time but but a prophet is you know let me make this real simple for the children young people the Prophet is built special because he sees things by vision like Jesus did he says what I do nothing except my father shows me so he's he's speaking but when he speaks he's speaking by vision he sees he sees it and so when a prophet comes he can be specially built to see visions and so the particular thing that a prophet is sent for is speak the vision for that hour I think I said it Friday night when when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he spoke it he's seen that happening by vision spoke it by the vision then four hundred years later an angel Reese peeks it to Mary and then there was a manifestation so now thankfully here II speaks it to us in our generation but when God sends a prophet he's a man of vision so now he catches that vision so but but he speaks the vision but the people are to walk in the vision he spoke so I say you which is greater speaking it or walking every day in it from the Prophet to the prophecy which is greater to God to me to God to God it's greater when he sees his people walking in the vision greater than a prophet because the Prophet just speaks at all he has visions no I'd love to be around the Prophet him telling visions and heads business praise the Lord praise the Lord but what's better the vision walking in the vision so now is the beginning of the it was beginning of the the 20th century when television came on the scene in science and television was as the Prophet explained we bring it into a certain channel there's there's pictures there's things out there there's images but they develop this thing by science they can draw that in and bring it through a certain I don't know all the technical stuff but here you can see it now in a television television so that happens beginning of the 20th century that size came natural types of spiritual we received a prophet at the beginning of the 20th century can you say math so then he moves on in his ministry and he's going to be the Prophet to bring the people back so now what's happening naturally so what happens with televisions is that through the years there's an advancement in the picture of the television and the thing called pixels and pixels are little dots in the screen and as time has moved out science is advanced and there was only like 30 40 50 thousand pixels in a screen when they started now there's millions billions of pixels because the more little pixels you have the clear the picture is so now you go into these stores and you see these televisions and you're looking at this it's almost real I mean it looks so crystal clear they actually call it crystal because they've advanced the picture so much there's no doubt about what it it looks like you're there that's the bride coming to the place we're moving from the shadow to the real and so many little pixels until when God opened the seals to us you talk about a burst of pixels never before is history ever seen such a dumping of Revelation pixels to a people on the face of the earth and he speaks those things and it just starts the through for the last 50 years the vision God's vision God's prophecy what God wants what he wants to achieve becomes crystal clear to the people of God it's right there in front of us the fivefold ministry is preaching it to us dead and I say I say here a little there a little a little dot here a little dot here little there little and it just keeps more dots morning like billions of dots in that picture now where are people that's blessed to have billions of pixels so we're not only seeing the vision we're walking in the vision I asked her the question again I asked you the question again which is greater a prophet speaking the vision or the people who afterwards walk in that vision you know you remember brother Bissell's testimony when he was out there the caribou and all that and he took that his wife put that green checkered shirt in the thing never even planned that but you know brother bisko's startling realization at the end of the day I didn't even realize it I was walking in that vision he puts that shirt on he walks out there because in the vision when he measured that with his hand and the Prophet looked over he had a green brother had had a green checkered shirt on how did all that happen he's walking in the vision and God did little things like that to show us the prophecy for this day it's not just about wearing a checkered shirt it's the word for this day is a vision and you are the ones walking in it right now moving from the Prophet to the prophecy is that okay with everybody I'm not losing any friends here today am i hey man I'm trying to gain friends in life not lose them I need more friends praise the Lord I got just a few you know brother Barry and that's questionable right there we're just like two totally different people I don't know how the Lord brought that friendship that we work together and we do retreats together in things but we're two opposites until he's totally different he's very different for that matter we have a I tell the young people we have a strange and wonderful relationship he's strange and I'm wonderful that's right so I have very little friends but I come to new feeling to gain some more I don't want to lose any praise the Lord so now now let's get to our text and try to finish this up here this morning we see then that one of the changes that I read to you so there's so many changes that took place under the Joshua Commission the people had grown to a place no more murmuring no more complaining did you realize that you don't find that in the book of Joshua no more days and no more Korah the gossiping had stopped they had matured okay it's time to move on get under Joshua here it's time to there's one focus to take our land when I got to sit around in our tents and just hash over things that's going on in the message no no there's a focus now you don't find it you don't find mermen complain you don't get see they find them seeking for a side Oh where's Moses and we just had Moses we can get out of this no no Josh was saying you got to get out of it you gotta fight your battles remember what I said one of the worst and maturities in the in the wilderness was too much dependence on Moses now you see a people and Joshua rise you got a leader you got the Holy Ghost Liam but you got two people and you never hear the complaining you never heard the murmuring everything's changed now there's one focus zeroed in on this day praise be think I want to be that way so all these changes we could preach about forever here it seems like but I'm just bringing out one in relation to our subject this weekend the manna ceased and they begin to eat the old corn and fruit of the promised land so the diet changed you know people that are maturing going from babyhood to adulthood your diet changes you go from milk to me so you can't take that meat though you can't move on with that unless you're matured yourself so you're you you eat mature food because you are becoming mature so you can go try to eat it and still bring them and remain a baby but you can't do that you're gonna choke yourself you're gonna be where's my milk at you want to be babied but if you're betray say god mature me God burn out all me maturities then you became ready for more of the meat of the word and when I say meat of the word I don't mean just doctrine of the word we're gonna find out in a minute that doesn't mean heavy deep doctrine I think the meat of the word is something much deeper even than that so now the diet change so does that apply to us spiritually yes it does for sure because we are in transition as revelations 10 as the book of redemption that was sealed is open to us for the first time it's crystal clear that it opens while the seventh angels on earth he opens it while the seven angels on earth Amen after that he says John was told to eat the book this is our diet so it changed though from what we ain't in the church ages now we have a book of redemption that we're feeding on John says taken and eat it so we're gonna be the different diet you know we're eating from the book of redemption being open to us so we become about Redemption we don't become about temporal things if I didn't just see another sign that I'll make it through the day if I can just see God do another supernatural act then I'll keep being a Christian if I can just see that's all Church ages God performing his thing but but it's not about finishing Redemption when we start to feed on the book of retention first of all we see our name in the book of redemption my positions in there I'm a part of this I'm a part of the vision I see my name in the book John seen his name in the book should it was an open he said he must have seen his name in there he began to shout and everybody heard him shouting so first of all you see your position and name in there but because it's a book of redemption it's like I preached last night you become a part of like Esther a part of Redemption that your focus is a much on focus not on temporal things and and what's going on in the message and all this happen and all the sin and all the stuff you move your focus now is that how can I be used to finish Redemption where's the last elected seed what does God want to do how does the redeemed son of God act a mature redeemed son of God what's this character I want to know I want to know where I stand I want to stand there now that this book is open I'm feeding on something that brings me to a maturity that I'm not getting all depressed about temporal things I'm not like the children in the wilderness that are just caught brother Brad explains it here and we just moved down I've got to move down this down this these notes said the manna ceased that's pretty significant that was 40 years of that manna every day being provided and it said that manna seized and they begin to eat the old corn of the lame the fruit of the land this is the man of the God supernaturally provided in exodus 16 early in their journey every morning to do was up and there was fresh manna on the ground it lasted for 40 years every day when God's people are hungry he will provide fruit for them but now something that there was every morning for 40 years stopped it seized Wow to these new ones under Joshua Commission the manna ceased and we don't hear one bit of complaining that they were so dependent on the manna for 40 years and now one morning it stops and there's not one word from the children of Israel to say Oh what are we gonna do we've been used to this for 40 years it's not one word of that God's given us another food never asked about the manna that's maturity Oh blessed be his name they would have a different food can you say mad so you should understand that the change in spiritual diet happens in a believers life in this hour if you turn with me to the scripture but the Gerald read after Friday night it's us such a supernatural move of God this weekend for him to read that scripture Hebrews chapter 5 but I got to refer to it again now under my subject today you see those little things that happen pastor gets up and reads that scripture and that's the scripture I was gonna read and just in he's just trying to say something to us we don't realize we're so earthbound sometimes we're not conscious of what the Lord is doing can you say Amen I I'll give you a little testimony last Sunday I was talking about brother Bram saying driving the nail down he says if you don't drive the nail down in 47 he was he was talking about 4890 48 he says I go into a Sunday meeting and then the devil gets on people the whole week oh if we come back just Sunday the devil knocks out what I've done the faith isn't theirs we have to start again so it's cheap preaching to my people about we have to stay in the word and that we have to let the Lord clinch that nail and brother Graham wanted to have meetings every night so you clinched that faith they don't really drive it down so the devil couldn't move it so I brought a nail up to my pulpit and I was gonna nail that in and give a visual to explain it to the people and they were I said if you're worried about me putting a nail in the pulpit I said what's my pulpit I can do it so I put a little aluminum nail on there I should have got a real one but I grabbed something for that the house and I grabbed a rubber hammer because I thought that would be a good type to cuz I want to be a good pastor that even though it's a hammer driving down the word I want to do it as politely as I can so I thought that would be a good point you know and they liked that there's a little praise the Lord I got a pastor his sensitivity he's not just trying to beat us up all the time but he's hammering it down the word but he's using a rubber hammer well it did work out so well because when I begin to pound that aluminum nail with a rubber hammer it just wasn't working so my brother-in-law who's a remodeler he went and got a real hammer and he hands it up to me while I'm doing this helping me out because I you know I needed help deliverance out of this visual it was gonna fall apart you can see it's unfit it's on the archive and so he walks up with the real hammer and he he hands that thing to me he says listen preach the word don't hold anything back just take this hammer and and nail it down now that I didn't pre plan that but when I got home I just realized that you know what the Lord's doing something here some things you don't plan and I took that hammer and beat that thing put it right through the pole back and then I had just an eruption from the audience it seemed like they said yeah we get the point we get the boy yeah you got to nail it down keep preaching it keep nailing it down to anchors can you say man praise the Lord we're gonna leave that nail right in there as an example to show down through the years that that's what we're up here to do we don't want it because brother Bram says you know if you just tap that in then the devil can come and knock it off you know as you just tap it in he also said the children could get hurt by it and I said to the people I says if people don't get anchored in the Holy Ghost as parents their children will suffer for it we need to be anchored we need to be mature Christians we need to know where we stand it's just those supernatural things and so he read this Friday night Hebrews 5 and verse 12 and he said he's reading it here and he said of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing here dull of hearing for when the time he ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God our become such as one and have need of milk and not strong meat so he's talking about babies spiritually and there's security blanket like lioness and it's a security blanket they reach and back into no no I don't want to hear that I want to hear the things that I first heard because that's a comfort blanket to me and you're just babies you want to stay babies I just want I feel comfortable just hearing the stories that the Prophet told and says it and it's wonderful to hear it but if we're not moving on in our inheritance then we're using that for a comfort blanket I say that respectfully for every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age did you notice now the diet for strong meat belongs to the one who are growing up in maturity so you have to mature in order to meet the diet God wants to give you and you can handle it that's why we pray God matura God take all very maturities out but strong meat belonging to them that are full eats even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now friends I believe that's given a trait of true maturity then we're not babies anymore we're not falling to just anything every doctrine anymore but we've become there our senses have been exercised by the Word of God by the Holy Spirit that we can detect the enemy at every one of his tricks can you say mad and and and and using discernment in every situation you know an example is if something comes in your dog you see the devil setting a trap for you you have a strong people of God that's raising to the place today in in maturity that they're not falling over and over again to temptations because they recognize the devil ahead of time and you go down a certain Street and you fell in a hole in that Street then the next day you take the same way to work and fall on that hole again you take the same way to work and you fall in that hole again you're not using discernment so discernment says I got to quit going down that Street and go another Street and the devil won't meet me fall so you deserve it in your own life to say now I'm not going to fall to this all the time if I do I God forgive me I don't mean to fall but I want to keep falling over and over again so I used my discernment to pick up on the devil overcoming is recognizing the devil every one of his tricks we're not ignorant of his devices oh boy we got a lot of devices whether Gerald was saying that got a lot of devices today Satan's devices so we have them we can't we can't we have to live with them but we're not ignorant of how Satan can use them the rest of the world's ignorant the rest of the world's ignorant they're not mature they're they're like babies are the newest movie that comes out the newest thing they just fall for it whatever okay okay let's do it they get on there click on anything in their net we can't live that way we know what this tree of knowledge is where people who know what this stuff is we know the devil behind it so we have to use our discernment for our own lives but let me say it this way we also must use discernment with the sword of the word and how we use it on other people because if we don't have divine love as our motivator we can take this sword and slice people up big time the people of the message can be more judgmental people and critical people than any denomination I've ever seen now why is that because we have so much of the word so much of the correction of the word we know how Christians supposed to live but you have to be careful that you don't not use discernment and how you apply it you know I was talking about my dad the other night he came to the Lord so on fire came to a Baptist Church gave his heart to the Lord then he came to a Pentecostal church then the Lord opened the message told me he's following the message of the last day so I told you that but boy he got on such fire that when he went in the service down to North Carolina he thought his dad bomb everybody was going to come just like that and just resent so he wrote a letter to his dad's and dad dad I'm excited you're gonna have to quit your smoking you're gonna have to quit your drinking you're gonna have to quit going to bars he listed all stuff you do and dig and get filled with the Holy Ghost god bless you sign butch just a zeal to see his dad be saved no discernment whatsoever it's like Paul said about Israel a zeal but not according to knowledge no discernment so is he saying the words he's saying well yeah but no desert no love no no manner image to bring it so dad got a letter back a few weeks ago he says his dad never wrote him but this time you wrote him back and Butch don't bother to come home keep your religion to yourself don't tell me what to do sign dad and so then it took years to repair what he had done for even us kids to be around grandpa but then he repaired it he apologized and then you know it's funny where grandpa's going on now grandma but my dad's with his sibling sometimes and they still haven't accepted the Lord there's one going to church but they haven't really accepted the Lord and dad was with this is this is wasn't planned this morning but dad was with his brother who has a lot of heart issues and he was with them last week he's visiting from Florida and he went to a motel to see him there and dad said let me pray for you so this dad's family now rejected all that we believed all these are rejecting the message we're called were strangers you know but over the years because dad's developed a respect now they're asking questions you see there's a discernment there's a maturity that people can pick up on to trust I think early years in this message I think there wasn't enough maturity to present this message the right and that's what I've been preaching this weekend friends we've got to mature because we've got a great thing here we have got a great thing but if we're not mature we'll destroy people with it my dad said let me pray for you in the motel my sister was there and he wept my Uncle Jim he wept drinker smoker just terrible life just this really but he just wept as my dad prayed just left you see over time and see we have to be careful that we don't use this sword with the wrong spirit to slice people up with it we got to have divine love now divine love is not compromising but it's administering it in such a way it's not harsh it's not belittling it's not trying to take away from the person but it's just bringing that divine love with the Word of God and that becomes attractive to people my observance all these years and the message by they're just too much of that that went on too much beatin people over the head trying to beat people into a rapture you don't beat this bride into a rapture you love them into a rapture God's gonna love his bride into her rapturing thing she's gonna so crave him more and more that she wants to be in church she wants to be in the world she wants to serve the Lord she wants to wear a dress the sisters any way she wants to it's not that she has to she wants to because of love I've fallen in love with him you understand these things and so brother branham explains this as I try to close on this quote if I can I have a lot of stuff here a lot of hay in the barn don't want to preach the whole barn of hay this morning I will get a drink has this been helpful to you this morning praise the Lord that's what we want to be a help so now he says what we didn't finish the scripture he said strong meat discerning both good and evil so it's the desert it's matured discernment with the word that we need chapter six therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God of the doctrines of Baptism laying on hands and resurrection of the Dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit so it just stops right there so leaving the principles those we still do those things but what's the emphasis you see if we only emphasize the laying of the hands if we only emphasize healings and miracles if we only emphasize the days of the Prophet we're gonna drop and die we have to personally move on with our inheritance with the law so when this man and corn thing this is the way brother branham explains it if he got that quote he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel who has possessed a land Oh aren't you glad you've come out of Egypt garlic aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness and remember they had to eat man and angels food out of heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they crossed over into the land the manna ceased to fall they were fully matured in and they eat the old corn of the land now now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel that you don't have to be babied and patted and persuaded to come to church did you notice the one of the marks of babyhood there you have to be persuaded to do things I wasn't that group under Joshua they were all in there ready what's next where's the next city to conquer you come to church like that you inspire a pastor got that what's next let's go forward hey man that's the way our maturity should be so they're not little babies anymore baby pat it you know we peek so many people unless it's got to be babied and patted and persuaded and you know Paul said without use enticing words of man's wisdom to entice somebody to do something we ministers don't have to use every type of thing to try to entice people just preach the word preaching to mature people they're gonna take the word amen but you know you don't you don't want to just keep babying fat little babies in the message that just want to be you know I have had this I've had people leave my church years ago man left my church cuz I didn't quote brother branham enough I know you'd think about that one I didn't have I didn't say enough quotes for his satisfaction so then then I've had people leave the church because I quoted him too much you know and passengers don't know what to do sometimes do you know what it's just immaturity it's just babies they want to hear what they want to hear they don't want to hear nothing else they don't want to be corrected they don't you know they want their little bottle and come to church treat me right treat me just right don't preach against my sin don't preach against my and when I say sin today I don't mean smoking drinking but preaching against their their complexes or preaching against their their attitudes or their anger that's out of control or their treatment of other Christians don't you say nothing about that just give me what I want to hear babies big babies who bring their bottle to church we're not here to preach the babies feelings he touched me my daughter used to say he touched me now kids can be sometimes you know when they're all irritable you know and their brother or sister just rubs again he touched me you know and isn't fusses in the backseat of the car and and you wish hat you wish he had that police thing that had the window from the front to the back soundproof would that be great you just can't hear any of it just can't just let him go on do we get there or if you don't have it with my dad if you didn't have that screen there if you weren't careful you'd feel a hand go slap every one of us yeah that's right so you just move back like this because you're going to get it here this babyhood in the church sometimes people they're supposed to be grown up their feelings are on their shoulders don't you dare offend me preacher don't you offend me somebody don't offend me and they're just they're just shallow the babies can't take too much used to be a song that says I know a man maybe you know him too he never can tell he might even be you he knelt at the altar and that was the end he's saved and that's all that matters to him his spiritual tummy it can't take too much one day a week he gets a spiritual lunch on Sunday he puts on his spiritual best but he gives his language a spiritual rest he's just a fat he's just a fat little baby he wants his bottle and he don't mean maybe he sampled solid food for once or twice but his doctrine leaves him cold as I and it goes on and on and on it's a song it says a fat little spiritual baby living on his emotions there is offended here and there you know drop of the Hat crying about things I'll tell you friends we need strong mature believers grown up in the word they're not living by their feelings their living by the word their living by that's what's next in the Word of God not little babies have to be persuaded to come to church and Pat it oh it's okay brother and make them a deacon to make them feel better brother Brant talks about that you know do something give them a position in the church and let them sing a special or something to make sure their feelings aren't hurt or something like that they shouldn't have their feelings hurt you know people that serve in positions places should never hang so tightly onto that position that they can never step aside to let somebody else do it that's humility I've put people in my positions in my church sometimes and they got in there and they're holding on for dear life you know and then God feels the the gods leaving the church in a different way and Holy Ghost in a different direction boy they're gonna hold on to that for dear life and it's a terrible thing because then you realize the persons in there not to serve the Lord but they're in there because they they like the position they're like to be seen that can be talked about we got to grow out all those mature in the trees you've seen too much of this and the message Friends you me like David and say I'd rather be he's the King I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God just so I can be in the house of God I don't need to be king I don't need to be a priest I don't need to be the preacher I don't need to sing a special if I can just be there and I open the door I'll greet the people I'll do whatever little thing because it's not about what position we hold it's about being in the glory of the Lord that's maturity so he says you're not baby padded and persuaded to come to church now that you feel you wholly mature Christians you're ready to eat strong means now you're ready to come into something you say you're ready to understand something that's deep and rich Oh we'll get into it directly oh it's been hidden since the foundation of the world now that you come to this I'm addressing this to you not to those who've just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that has received a promise how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad you're in the land or eating the old corn eating the strong things of God get a clear understanding your spirits will not mine is all unmodeled up there's another sign of wisdom excuse me of maturity your minds not all muddled up there's a clarity in your mind sound mind you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know and whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against that that's maturity friends that's discernment praise be to God just wonderful I believe God wants to hear from people mature confession like you heard I said to Caleb last night we're more than able that makes God's attention perk up that he can do something and we have to have confessions not of murmuring and complaining and can Moses come and do us another period can Moses come back and do us another miracle to pull us out of this can all this immaturity but but it's it's something that were proclaiming with a strong faith people that would say maybe in Joshua's day they'd say to Joshua Joshua not murmuring complaining I want to let you know Joshua Egypt is dead to me I will never go back to the wilderness I'm all-in I've crossed Jordan I've reached the point of no return I believe this thing with everything inside me pastor I don't need to I don't need God to show himself that he's great to stay in the message he's already showed me he's great I need him now to help me while I Drive these enemies out of the land and get my inheritance Joshua I'm not needing the mana I've got the old corn and I can pick up this corn and fruit of this land and eat that and be totally satisfied I'm not going back I'm not murmuring complaining I need to go get my inheritance and so whatever God shows you to tell me I want to know the next thing so I can move on with the Lord those are mature comments too in the Joshua Commission I mean I don't need to join a group that's trying to get Moses to come back I need to stay away from groups they're trying to raise him from the dead and have him a tent and have him a white horse all this fanaticism they'll come down and it's bound to be you know why it happens because we had such a significant spiritual happening in this generation whenever you have that you're gonna have a lot of fanaticism that goes with it and I'm not interested in fanaticism I'm interested why God sent a prophet see and so I'm not going to join the groups that are you know trying to bring him back join the groups that did glorifying what he did you know brother brems gonna come up and speak for us tonight it's a it's a tad of spiritualism when you act like a man is still alive and he's dead it's borderline spiritualism young people the young people the the prophet of God brother Branham will be speaking for us tonight it's it's eerie it's eerie but just just leave that with them because God has sent us a wonderful message through William Branham God sent us a wonderful message through William Branham and I can take what he said I can thank God for what he did through it but his commission is over and I can take what he's getting feed on it I feed on this message more than anything else this message is open this Bible to me I can feed on it and I say Lord what's next in my life can you say man and don't let me to stay with the manna let me eat the old corn the mature corner of the land let me eat that kind of food amen can we stand together god bless you amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise god is good all the time can we sing that God is good all the time amen praise the Lord God is good [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you say man sure have enjoyed being with y'all we want more the jail to come but can I pray with you before we close the service my part of the service and why brother Gerald come I just want to be in tune with the vision for this hour I don't want to be lingering in the past I don't want to get ahead of God but I want to find what he's the where he's leaning now and that's my desire and to be the mature Christian that I need to be for the Lord for him to use me and I trust out of their desire as well we certainly have had a good time here and thank you and we would like to come back sometime that's good I've said a lot of things you know I've had more fun than a human being should be allowed to have probably here and this really enjoyed and said things about brother Barry and different things and hopefully it's not on the Internet I get in trouble maybe we'll have a slogan what happens in Newfoundland stays in this what gets said that would be good thank you for feeling making us feel at home most I know the Lord has been here and present among us and we feel good about the meetings can we pray together let me pray for you Heavenly Father bless this precious group of people Lord and Newfoundland Saint John's here Lord that have been laboring through the years and faithful pastor and then Lord to see some new souls come to you Lord revive Lord revivals happen that way in the book of Acts errs many new ones came to the light pray that you'll continue to do that Lord and find the last elected seat in this this region Lord that they'd hear the word and be able to walk in that light I pray bless this assembly and its officials and deacons trustees Lord the singers and Sunday School teachers and all the ones that are just putting their gifts Lord in the temple to be used of you just pray your blessings one of their father and Lord if they caught anything this weekend from our our sermons lord I just pray they catch look there they are the children of God they are called of God and their to rise to this place to be your bride in this hour to finish Redemption such an important position Lord and we're thankful Father for them we pray you bless their lives give us maturity Lord that the next trial that lays ahead whatever it be if it starts tomorrow or next year whatever we know there'll be trials may we conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of our trials may we conduct ourselves not as babies but as mature men in men and women of God during those times and we're taking the word that you've given us and representing it to the world in the best way that we can that's our desire for you have given us a wonderful message we're thankful for it thus these hearts we pray in Jesus name Amen god bless where the Gerald come god is good [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man thank God the Bible says out of the mouth of two or three witnesses let it be established hey man so it's it's our brothers we thank the Lord for our brothers ministry we thank the Lord for the word that's been ministered and it's the confirmation of maybe a number of things that you have heard me Minister for a number of years a man that's the truth I believe what he said you know and that was tremendous scripture there this morning concerning them my servant Moses is dead a man and no doubt there were those that were still wanted Moses and they still put the emphasis on Moses a man's the same thing today my servant brother Branham is dead physically amen we know they're spiritually he's in that dimension that the Lord has showed him before he took him a man but the emphasis is not on him now mother now we're going from the messenger to the message and I oh that's good praise the Lord for for confirming it for confirming those things so you've heard not just me you but now you've heard our brother come with with with the thoughts God laid on his heart I believe it was the Lord oh yes most definitely in the Lord and there's not only a witness to the Saints right here but a witness are those online or in DVD land and brother it could be around the world so the group we thank the Lord God I believe it was the will of God for our brother to come it was the will of God for our brother to minister what he ministered amen so god help us brother that we're going to recognize the message a man and I can go back for a number of years having having been around the message world maybe over 50 years and I can confirm what our brother is said a man most definitely because I can go back to well when I came to the message in 1965 our brother wasn't born to 66 and it's amazing but I was I was getting better getting closer to the message and I'm late late 65 but it was in 1966 that that I that I was I was given a witness that God had sent a prophet a man and brother and I and I have I have I can bear witness on what it was like then and what it's like now a man and how that it has changed over 50 years a man and he ended what our brother preached was truth that the emphasis was on the messenger and is the truth when I first come to this message they were preaching God has sent a prophet goddess and a prophet God has sent a prophet but brother now the emphasis is on the message and brother it was and again I believe the prophet knew that this was coming this change was coming because there was somebody that asked the prophet of God in in the late 1950s somebody said brother Bentham what do you see ahead for the church and he said what do I see and he said well he said I see nothing but total darkness after 1977 a mayor that's the truth somewhere that God was going to draw a line and after 1977 it was total darkness and I can bear witness that it was in the early 1970s that we began to move from God a center prophet to the message amen that is that is the absolute truth brother because I remember from there 66 and underground through the 1970s 72 at least 72 that it was all God's and a prophet everybody we were in went on the world preaching God has sent a prophet we went from one town to another one church to another God has sent a prophet a man but then all of a sudden it changed yes he sent a prophet but why did he send the prophet a man so let's get let's get into the message and we had me begin the move from putting the emphasis on the Prophet to these message a man but again there was an older generation and I mention that just recently the older generation they kept on preaching goddess and a prophet a man and they didn't understand the things that we were saying concerning the message a man what we were pointing to concerning the resurrection because suddenly the rapture concerning you know going on to perfection and more in into the image of our Lord Jesus Christ amen not William Branham no it was Jesus Christ if yet if he was pointing to anyone he was plenty to Jesus a man he didn't even want to either get his attention attention on him he wanted to get the attention on Jesus because he is is the resurrection and the rapture amen by the grace of God should we thank the Lord tonight a Merida's forty rather for the confirmation that he has given us through our brother Paula Fontaine a man to God be the glory a man and again I said he talked about the older generation when I'm part of that older dinner well Joshua came and ministered so caleb is going to confirm so we thank the Lord for that amen but it's amazing when he read that scripture and Moses my servant is dead a man so where do we go from here we can't we can't stay with Moses we be stably be in the wilderness hey man so let's go on with Joshua Caleb a man a man and it's going to give us the faith we need to get in and possess the land by the grace of God to God be the glory amen and I know there's some of the Saints here have confirmed to me Oh wonderful he said that brother just confirmed he said well you've been preaching he said that's good and then and it's been it's been a real blessing to their brother so praise the Lord to God be the glory amen so let's recognize what God has been revealing to us during these last three sermons amen let's move on from the messenger to the message we're not denying the messenger no not in any way we reverence and respect the messenger we thank God for the messenger a man but let us put the emphasis on the message and I like that quote besetting or you're going from the Prophet to the prophecy that's good praise the name of the Lord hallelujah a man so let's believe God what God has said not with her Bentham said what God said the prophet of God says this is not me he said I got to get myself out of the way and he said for him to do this him to do that and for for God to say what he wanted to say through the Prophet praise the name of the Lord let's believe the word a man to God be the glory amen and we've changed it as I said from the Prophet to the prophecy yes by the grace of God and again brother Paul didn't say that prophecy amen that was good oh praise the Lord that was good in what is the attraction on the mountain a man 19 and if 1965 praise the name of the Lord and the prophet knew he was going oh yeah no doubt he maybe he saw Moses was taken off the scene and God was going to take him off the senior praise the Lord hallelujah so there is a ministry that God's been raising up one after the other to get to get the message to the bride praise the name of the Lord Amen so god bless her brother Paula Fontaine and our sister Rebecca and amen and all the saints that have joined us here from central of land Lord bless you amen so the

God a mayor round the walls of Jericho softly trot trusting in the Lord they felt the conquers trade by faith they saw the victory man was wonderful this to our brother was preaching even today he said God bringing Israel out of Egypt amen but again Lord that like I said there's a lot of competitors ahead of the denominations and they want to go back now there they some have gone back and here's the truth brother and grace to us that we're going on a man does not stay back here with Moses now stay back here with God sent a prophet amen let's get into the list getting to the Ministry of Joshua Caleb a man regarding the message amen let's take the responsibility of the world a man brothers one thing for him for the proper to do what he did now it's a tremendous responsibility to act on what he said amen to acts on the message respond to the message go in and possess the land footsteps is possession hey man so the grace of God who are taking footsteps into the Promised Land amen
