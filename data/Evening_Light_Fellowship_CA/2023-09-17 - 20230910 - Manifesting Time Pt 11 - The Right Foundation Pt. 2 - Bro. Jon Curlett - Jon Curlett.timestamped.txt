[41:39] Lord under the shadow of the Almighty
[41:43] Lord in the cleft of The Rock
[41:46] Lord we can rest
[41:49] Lord and it's under that name
[41:52] Lord It's a tower for us it's a defense
[41:54] for us
[41:56] Lord It's a shield for us and we're
[41:57] resting on your word this morning Lord
[41:59] we're surrounding ourselves in your word
[42:02] this morning Lord and we're saying Lord
[42:04] that we're here to confess that we
[42:05] believe it Lord we accept it we're
[42:08] applying it and Lord we're expecting its
[42:11] full results in our lives Lord God Lord
[42:14] we've come in to hear you once again
[42:16] Lord let us come in Lord with

[42:24] but Lord May something new quick and
[42:26] within us Lord may US draw us closer
[42:28] Lord to that rapturing faith that
[42:30] rapturing Grace Lord may have left us
[42:32] higher Lord may it settle us deeper Lord

[42:37] Lord minister to our hearts and souls
[42:39] and lives Lord we pray this morning in
[42:42] Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen
[42:45] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[42:47] II Peter chapter one second Peter
[42:50] chapter one
[42:51] I want to thank brother Paul for taking
[42:53] the Wednesday service while we were away
[42:54] we went to Terra Nova and
[42:57] went camping with the intention of rest
[42:59] and we went camping I don't know that we
[43:01] got any rest but it's always good to get
[43:04] away and just kind of lay down the
[43:05] mantle for a little bit so I appreciate
[43:07] that
[43:08] certainly want to welcome brother Gerald
[43:10] and sister Betty back I think they're
[43:11] starting to enjoy their retirement now
[43:13] where they don't have to be back in
[43:16] service and don't have to preach every
[43:17] time they don't have to have a cat to to
[43:19] luck after these things so I I just see
[43:22] think they're going to start really
[43:23] enjoying life now and they can come and
[43:25] go and they can get up and go down when
[43:27] they want so God bless you thank God for
[43:29] bringing you back safely
[43:31] but the Kings he's not here this morning
[43:32] but we do want to thank him for his work
[43:34] for cleaning the fellowship hall over
[43:36] the over the week and as you if you go
[43:38] out and see he he stripped it where is
[43:40] he there he is he's right in front amen
[43:42] sorry
[43:43] there he is God bless you brother
[43:45] Kingsley it certainly looks wonderful
[43:46] and I know you put a lot of Blood Sweat
[43:48] and Tears into it so we're thankful for
[43:50] that and then the the trustees and many
[43:51] others went in and helped paint the the
[43:53] fellowship Hollow over again and
[43:55] rearrange it and brother Joe and brother
[43:57] Kingsley came in on on Saturday morning
[43:59] to move the heavy stuff that we'd moved
[44:01] out last Sunday and then the others came
[44:03] in and did the lighter stuff so it's a
[44:05] body effort amen amen a body that works
[44:08] well works together and so I'm very
[44:09] appreciative for those that have done
[44:11] that this morning amen second Peter 1
[44:13] we'll just read the first verse here
[44:15] Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of
[44:18] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[44:20] like Precious Faith with us through the
[44:23] righteousness of God and our Savior
[44:25] Jesus Christ amen God bless you can have
[44:27] your seats this morning and as you can
[44:29] imagine we're continuing on our series
[44:31] on manifesting time and I want to take a
[44:33] second service on on this title of the
[44:36] the rape Foundation we're talking about
[44:38] faith this morning and as I said before
[44:40] we're pressing now into this message on
[44:42] the stature of a perfect man and we know
[44:44] that the basis for the Christian walk
[44:46] the basis for our life is always Faith
[44:48] amen our foundation our Anchor Point our
[44:51] our settled attribute of our life is
[44:54] always on faith and you know there's a
[44:56] lot of misplaced Faith going around
[44:57] these days you see what's going on and
[44:59] you see the polarization that's
[45:01] happening in the world and whether it's
[45:03] around political systems and you've got
[45:04] people that think that the Democrats are
[45:06] going to make it happen or the
[45:07] Republicans are going to make it happen
[45:08] or the liberals or the conservatives and
[45:11] people think well if we can just get
[45:12] this one in here if we can just get that
[45:14] one in it'll change it listen it's all
[45:16] under Satan's control
[45:17] God is the great orchestrator of all
[45:19] these things but these things are in
[45:20] Satan's hands until God redeems the
[45:22] Earth back to him so there's no answers
[45:24] coming through political parties there's
[45:25] no answers coming through Economic
[45:27] Policy there's no none of this is going
[45:29] to work out
[45:30] it's not going to work out and listen
[45:32] we've got people that have placed faith
[45:33] in their pastor and we've seen where
[45:35] that leads as well because the pastor
[45:37] doesn't stand the word stands amen we're
[45:39] all each one faithful we're all each one
[45:42] um
[45:43] yeah you know doing our best up here but
[45:45] in the end men fall men rise gifts come
[45:48] gifts go but the word is the thing that
[45:50] stands true amen people have a faith in
[45:52] the inherent goodness of other people
[45:54] and we've seen how that works out as
[45:56] well because there's nothing good in us
[45:58] our righteousness our goodness Paul said
[46:00] us as filthy rags there's there's
[46:02] nothing that we can trust unless it's
[46:04] the word and so when we're looking at
[46:06] where we place our trust we've got to
[46:08] see the word as our anchor the word is
[46:11] our basis the word is our foundation and
[46:13] it's our faith in that and so for the
[46:15] believer our faith is based on something
[46:16] real and it's something that is absolute
[46:18] and it's something that is firm and it
[46:20] is the word itself not just the word
[46:22] written not just the word spoken but it
[46:24] is the person of the word and we
[46:26] remember last service we showed that
[46:28] slide and we've got some issues going on
[46:30] this morning but we showed that slide of
[46:32] the word and what it was and we've got
[46:33] that big circle and within it we had all
[46:35] of those attributes because the word is
[46:37] the attributes of God it is the nature
[46:39] of God it's the characteristics of God
[46:41] it's the truth and the plan of God it's
[46:43] it's the anointing of God it's it's the
[46:45] personality of God it's the plan of God
[46:47] all these different things it's the life
[46:49] of God it's the light of God all of
[46:51] these different things is is the word
[46:53] and we saw what in last service we went
[46:54] to John 1 and we said the word was with
[46:56] God and the Word was God and it was all
[46:58] of these these ideas and Concepts but it
[47:01] was only that it seemed only conceptual
[47:03] to us as humans but there came a time
[47:05] where the word became a hymn and then
[47:07] the hymns started doing things if I
[47:09] could put it that way and he started the
[47:11] word started to have an impact on on our
[47:13] life and it had an impact on our world
[47:14] and it had an impact on the creation
[47:16] that he made and all of these things
[47:18] came and he said there came a point
[47:20] where that hymn became not just
[47:21] impactful but it became the life of men
[47:24] and it became the light of man amen that
[47:26] means the word is alive it's not just
[47:28] outside of us it's not just around us
[47:30] but now it's something that comes in and
[47:31] it's working and it's dealing directly
[47:33] with us as Believers it wasn't abstract
[47:35] anymore this word
[47:37] it wasn't just the father above us and
[47:39] it wasn't just God with us but now it
[47:41] became God in us if we could put it that
[47:43] way the word was progressing the
[47:44] revealing of the word went from above us
[47:46] to with us and now we're in the age
[47:48] where it's the word in us and we are the
[47:50] revealing of the word in this final time
[47:51] as Gentiles and since that word has been
[47:55] revealed everything that any believer
[47:57] has ever done has come through faith in
[47:59] that word anything that's worth talking
[48:01] about anything that's worth having has
[48:02] come through faith in that word and it
[48:04] was based on the revealing of the word
[48:06] to each person and we're going to talk
[48:07] about the revealing of that word and the
[48:09] faith that it brought this morning but
[48:11] every time we see it we see the word is
[48:13] constantly unfolding this was the slide
[48:16] that I was talking about this is the
[48:18] word and it was all those things wrapped
[48:19] up inside of it and it was all the word
[48:21] but since that time or since the
[48:23] beginning the word has been constantly
[48:25] unfolding Christ has been unfolding
[48:27] Christ has been revealing and it's not
[48:29] that he's ever contradicting himself but
[48:31] it's that he's opening himself up more
[48:32] he's showing himself up more as he goes
[48:35] through time so you can't rest on a
[48:37] message from yesterday because Christ
[48:39] has kept moving the word has kept
[48:41] revealing the word is kept unfolding and
[48:43] so we can't even rest on something
[48:45] that's come you know a hundred years ago
[48:47] or even 50 years ago but the word is
[48:49] constantly unfolding because it's life
[48:51] and it's light and it's wanting to
[48:53] reveal itself it's wanting to show
[48:54] himself but I want to read a quote this
[48:57] morning and this is a reminder of why
[48:59] we're not a denomination we hold the
[49:01] Bible as our absolute that is the word
[49:04] to us that is the written word it is
[49:05] God's God's thoughts and his words that
[49:08] he spoke written down for us and that's
[49:10] where we hold our foundation is always
[49:13] with the word because what happens with
[49:15] the denomination is God revealed himself
[49:17] in a way and what happened is they
[49:19] caught the truth but then they only
[49:21] stayed with that truth and they did not
[49:23] move on as God continued to reveal
[49:25] himself what they have is truth but the
[49:27] truth has continued to be revealed the
[49:29] truth is kept walking remember the word
[49:31] says if we walk in the light as he is in
[49:34] the light that means he's walking and
[49:36] that means he's light so you've got to
[49:38] stay with them otherwise you're going to
[49:39] be left behind and when you get left
[49:41] behind what are you doing you're resting
[49:43] on something from another day the word
[49:45] is continually opening the word is
[49:47] continually moving amen so we want to
[49:49] constantly be quick to hear quick to
[49:51] understand quick to grasp what God is
[49:53] doing because as he moves he's bringing
[49:55] a bride with him he's bringing a church
[49:57] out with them now listen to this quote
[49:59] it says this
[50:01] all Christianity all you are all you'll
[50:05] ever be is based upon faith in the word
[50:07] that's the reason I believe the word see
[50:09] I can't put my faith on nothing else if
[50:12] I was going to put it on the church
[50:13] which church would I put it on Catholic
[50:16] Lutheran Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[50:19] you said where would I put it on I don't
[50:21] know they all scruple everything up and
[50:22] everything else they twist lines and
[50:24] everything else
[50:26] what because they've stayed there and
[50:27] they've had to make it into something
[50:29] that it wasn't meant to be and they
[50:31] twisted up
[50:32] like I said last time I was talking
[50:34] about the Pentecostals and I was looking
[50:36] at even yesterday and all they want to
[50:38] do is get you to speak in tongues all
[50:40] they want you to do is do the least of
[50:42] the gifts
[50:43] and they say that's it when you got that
[50:45] you're done you're finished that's all
[50:47] you need Paul said it's the least of the
[50:49] gifts and they're not even doing it the
[50:50] way it did on the day of Pentecost
[50:52] because everyone's supposed to
[50:53] understand you as you speak if you want
[50:55] a gift of tongues if you want it is the
[50:57] original evidence that they had it was
[50:58] that everybody understood what they were
[51:00] saying not this stuff that they're
[51:02] talking about that's not the gift of
[51:04] tongues
[51:05] on the original day everybody heard it
[51:07] in the language that they understood
[51:09] that's the original gift
[51:11] but this gift of tongues to speak and
[51:12] unknown languages Paul said it's the
[51:14] least they said you can only do it a
[51:15] little bit in church less people come in
[51:17] and think we're crazy he says and then
[51:19] if you don't have an interpreter then
[51:20] just be quiet
[51:21] because it just brings confusion in the
[51:23] church
[51:24] but what they stayed there and God had
[51:26] restored it in Azusa we see that God
[51:29] have restored those gifts and they
[51:30] stayed with the gifts rather than moving
[51:32] into the full revealing of the word of
[51:34] God
[51:35] they took the guess but the giver was
[51:37] coming behind it the full revealing of
[51:39] the word
[51:40] amen we believe in the gifts we believe
[51:43] in the operation of the spirit we do
[51:44] absolutely 100 but that is not the
[51:47] evidence
[51:48] that is not the evidence of that he says
[51:51] he says they scruple things up and
[51:53] everything else twist lines and
[51:54] everything else but when I put my faith
[51:56] in his word it's anchored nobody
[51:58] interpret it here it is thus saith the
[52:01] Lord then I believe that there's the
[52:04] basis amen if you've got a Doctrine you
[52:06] want to bring to me if you've got an
[52:07] idea you want to bring to me you got to
[52:09] bring it through here first
[52:10] don't bring me your preacher don't bring
[52:12] me your profit or anything you bring it
[52:13] to this because this is our absolute
[52:16] this is where we stand amen this is the
[52:19] word that never fails
[52:20] this is the word that never fails now we
[52:23] read in second Peter one last Service as
[52:24] we mentioned the start of the stature of
[52:26] a perfect man and Peter never says the
[52:28] statue of a perfect man but Paul brings
[52:30] it from Ephesians 4 and he coins the
[52:33] phrase Paul tells us uh Peter tells us
[52:36] what it is but Paul's the one that
[52:37] mentions it and he's talking in
[52:39] Ephesians 4 about the fivefold ministry
[52:41] he says he gave some Apostles he gave
[52:43] some prophets and some evangelists and
[52:45] some pastors and teachers so Paul is
[52:47] telling us who God gave to do the
[52:49] primary work of the ministry
[52:51] to the gospel and it's in a five-fold
[52:53] Ministry now listen we notice today that
[52:56] people will lean on one or two have you
[52:58] noticed that people that are drawn to
[53:00] prophets all they want is a prophetic
[53:01] Ministry but the prophetic Ministry
[53:03] alone won't do it
[53:07] or they just want their pastor and they
[53:08] run everything through what their pastor
[53:10] says but guess what that Pastor doesn't
[53:12] have it all either
[53:13] or they just want the Evangelist because
[53:15] the Evangelist Hypes you up and he gets
[53:17] you going in these different things no
[53:19] no we need all five we need teachers
[53:22] come stable anointed teachers that'll
[53:26] Place us solidly on the word
[53:28] that'll take emotion out of it
[53:31] but then you'll have an evangelist come
[53:33] in and he'll bring that emotion back
[53:34] into it because an emotionless marriage
[53:37] is no marriage at all there's no
[53:39] relationship if there's no emotion but
[53:41] the thing is if you lean towards emotion
[53:42] you'll never listen to the teacher and
[53:43] you'll be what flighty the rest of your
[53:45] life
[53:45] and if all you do is listen to that
[53:47] teacher you'll get cold and formal you
[53:49] need a pastor that'll come in and shape
[53:51] you that'll say the things you don't
[53:52] want to hear
[53:53] for your good even though it makes his
[53:56] life difficult you need a Prophet come
[53:58] to come and what catch the mind of God
[54:00] and what speak into our lives and these
[54:02] different things and we know those gifts
[54:04] exist in the body
[54:05] but you can't rest on any one of them
[54:07] but the five of them together what they
[54:10] produce a finished work
[54:11] what they all have a work to do but we
[54:13] need every single one of them in the
[54:14] body what is the work it's for the
[54:17] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[54:19] the ministry and for the edifying of the
[54:21] body if you want to be perfect you want
[54:22] to be mature you need to sit under a
[54:24] five-fold Ministry
[54:25] that's it Paul's unequivocal about it he
[54:28] says You must have all five you can't
[54:30] just pick one or two you need all five
[54:32] of those and the goal of the ministry is
[54:34] to bring us to what the unity of the
[54:35] faith the full maturity of the Bride him
[54:37] and it's too edified to build up to help
[54:39] develop the body of Christ around them
[54:41] and that is our only goal my only goal
[54:44] is to get you in a Rapture or get you in
[54:46] a resurrection if you go by way of the
[54:47] Grave that's my only goal and everything
[54:49] else falls to the side
[54:51] if I'm sitting here and I'm talking
[54:52] about me me me get me out
[54:55] because this is not to build me up
[54:58] this is not to build me up if anything
[55:00] this ministry will break me down frankly
[55:03] it will it'll break me down but if all
[55:05] you can hear is me talking about myself
[55:07] get me out in any other minister that
[55:09] all he can do is talk about me me I I
[55:11] that is not a man that you want because
[55:13] he's focused on himself not on you
[55:15] listen we are servants to Christ I am
[55:18] not your servant but I serve you
[55:21] he's my master I answered him but I
[55:23] serve you
[55:24] listen proud servants don't last long
[55:27] they don't last long do they what Pride
[55:29] goes before destruction in a haughty
[55:31] spirit before a fall doesn't mean I
[55:33] can't get up again
[55:34] but if I come in Pride God will knock me
[55:36] flat on my back
[55:38] he'll do it he's done it he'll continue
[55:40] to do it if I get raised up in any way
[55:42] of myself he'll knock me flat on my back
[55:43] because he can't work with pride
[55:45] humility is power with God amen amen I
[55:49] serve you in humility and in love to
[55:52] edify you to help you grow to help you
[55:53] mature whether you like it or not and
[55:56] whether I like it or not that's the way
[55:58] these things work
[55:59] how long are we going to do it for how
[56:00] long are you going to be a minister
[56:01] brother John until we all come I'm in
[56:04] there with you until we all come in the
[56:07] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[56:09] the Son of God unto a perfect man unto
[56:12] the measure of the stature of the
[56:15] fullness of Christ now what's the effect
[56:17] of all this this is how you know when
[56:18] you're there it says that we henceforth
[56:20] be no more children toss to and fro and
[56:24] carried about with every wind of
[56:25] Doctrine by the Slate of man and cunning
[56:27] craftiness whereby they lay and wait to
[56:29] deceive Peter would sum it up this way
[56:31] he said You shall never fall
[56:33] you come into the statue of a perfect
[56:35] man you'll never fall
[56:37] remember the scripture says adjustment a
[56:39] righteous man falls seven times but he
[56:40] gets up again it's not that you don't
[56:42] have issues it's not that you don't
[56:43] stumble it's not that you never break
[56:44] down but you keep getting up again you
[56:47] keep getting up because there's
[56:48] something inside of you that won't let
[56:49] you stay down it says but speaking the
[56:52] truth in love this is to the fivefold
[56:54] ministry there's our motive
[56:56] it's always in love the the preeminent
[56:59] nature of Christ the word is love
[57:01] everything he does is love whether it
[57:04] hurts or whether it feels good it is
[57:06] always done in love there are things
[57:07] that that a Ministry is going to say
[57:09] that are going to seem cutting and
[57:10] hurtful at times
[57:11] we say it to our kids we do it to our
[57:13] kids no kid enjoys a spanking it's
[57:15] hurtful for them but we do it for their
[57:17] benefit amen but we can't hold back the
[57:20] truth and call it love
[57:22] we can't hold back the truth and call it
[57:24] love
[57:25] Paul said I have not you know I'm not
[57:28] shunned to declare to you the full
[57:29] counsel of God Paul had some hard things
[57:31] to say
[57:33] Paul had them put people out of the
[57:34] church
[57:36] but he also had them bring them back
[57:38] when they repented
[57:40] what for their sake not for his sake
[57:43] amen the world says today as soon as you
[57:45] hurt me
[57:46] you don't love me
[57:48] I'm not saying it to hurt you I'm saying
[57:51] it to help you
[57:52] but that's where motive comes in that's
[57:54] where attitude comes in Paul will talk
[57:56] about he says we're supposed to be meek
[57:57] in these things
[57:58] we're supposed to be making these things
[58:00] what so perchance that person would hear
[58:02] us and come to the truth because if they
[58:04] don't accept the truth eventually
[58:06] they're lost
[58:08] God's only obligated to give us one
[58:10] opportunity but God will give it over
[58:12] and over again so many times but if they
[58:13] keep turning down the truth that they
[58:15] continually turn it down they're lost
[58:16] and so we're seeking their souls not
[58:19] their comfort and certainly not our
[58:21] comfort the hardest thing you can do
[58:22] sometimes is tell a person that they're
[58:24] lost
[58:26] but that's not the gospel the gospel is
[58:28] not your law loss the gospel is there's
[58:30] a way to get back there's a way to be
[58:33] found there's a way to make it into
[58:34] eternity but we're talking about faith
[58:36] this morning and I want to go back to
[58:38] the great Heroes of the faith and the
[58:39] the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter
[58:41] and I I started it last week and I want
[58:43] to finish it and I don't want to spend
[58:44] too much time on faith but I want us to
[58:46] look at where the start of faith is and
[58:48] and what it looks like this precious
[58:50] Faith this like Precious faith that
[58:51] Peter was talking about
[58:53] so we go to Hebrews 11 this is Paul
[58:55] talking about this he says now Faith is
[58:57] the substance of things hoped for and it
[59:00] is the evidence of Things Not Seen so in
[59:02] other words when you have faith faith is
[59:03] as tangible to you as this
[59:06] you have it you may not be able to see
[59:08] it but you have it you can't touch it
[59:10] you can't feel it but yet you know it's
[59:11] there you can rest on it it's an
[59:13] assurance it's that set of feeling it's
[59:15] a knowledge it's a revelation that what
[59:17] you're believing for is what you're
[59:19] going to get that's what real Godly
[59:21] faith is amen it says and for a buy it
[59:24] the elders obtained a good report
[59:25] through faith we understand that the
[59:27] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[59:30] that things that are seen were not made
[59:32] of those things which do appear we could
[59:34] spend a month on this just on that
[59:36] phrase there we because what when our
[59:39] faith is is settled it's not based on
[59:41] what we can see
[59:42] it's not based on how we feel that
[59:44] morning when we get up it's not based on
[59:46] how we feel as we're going through the
[59:47] day it's not based on how we feel when
[59:49] we go to bed at night it's not based on
[59:50] what we see in the mirror it's not it's
[59:52] not based on what the doctor tells us
[59:54] it's not based on what the work is
[59:55] telling us our colleagues none of it is
[59:57] based on that amen it is based on God
[1:00:00] has revealed it to me and I believe it
[1:00:03] so what he says at the beginning God
[1:00:05] made everything out of nothing
[1:00:08] God is a Creator and so circumstances
[1:00:11] have no effect on the faith of a child
[1:00:12] of God because God can create anything
[1:00:14] out of nothing
[1:00:16] and God can turn anything into anything
[1:00:18] else Jesus said listen if they would be
[1:00:20] silent when he was coming into Jerusalem
[1:00:21] he said if they would be silent he says
[1:00:23] God's able of these stones to raise up
[1:00:25] children
[1:00:27] heals the cattle on a thousand hills we
[1:00:29] don't have to worry about our employer
[1:00:30] we don't have to worry about it getting
[1:00:32] favor with this one or that one God
[1:00:34] provides us the favor God provides us
[1:00:36] with the source for every need that we
[1:00:39] have he is our source he is our Jehovah
[1:00:41] Jireh amen God speaks and things happen
[1:00:44] God declares it by his word and nothing
[1:00:46] will stop it the word is like that great
[1:00:49] Energizer Bunny come commercial they
[1:00:51] used to have and every other thing that
[1:00:52] had a battery and it would fall by the
[1:00:54] wayside but they had that that bunny
[1:00:56] rabbit that was just going and banging
[1:00:58] the drum with the Energizer batteries in
[1:01:00] it why everything else failed but
[1:01:02] Energizer the word is the Energizer amen
[1:01:05] it does not stop it does not sleep it
[1:01:07] does not need to rest it goes and it
[1:01:10] goes and goes until it produces what it
[1:01:11] said it was going to do amen
[1:01:15] but then we jump to verse six and it
[1:01:16] says but without faith it is impossible
[1:01:18] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:01:21] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:01:24] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:01:26] him we're talking about faith as the
[1:01:28] foundation of a Christian walk and Paul
[1:01:30] would go so far as to say is if you
[1:01:31] don't have faith you can't please God in
[1:01:34] other words you're not acceptable to God
[1:01:36] and we'll see this as we go into the
[1:01:38] scriptures amen face the starting point
[1:01:40] but Faith takes you somewhere Faith puts
[1:01:43] you into action Faith changes you amen
[1:01:45] it's not dormant but faith is active it
[1:01:48] has an ingredient to it that causes it
[1:01:50] to do things amen it has purpose and
[1:01:52] intent in itself remember we preached
[1:01:54] about a seed and everything that you are
[1:01:56] going to get out of a seed is in the
[1:01:58] seed at the beginning
[1:01:59] and the first thing that comes out of a
[1:02:01] Believer is faith and it's faith in the
[1:02:03] word of God it's faith in the finished
[1:02:05] work of Calvary it's faith in what God
[1:02:07] has revealed to you now we spoke how
[1:02:09] Paul said last service in First
[1:02:11] Corinthians he said for no other
[1:02:12] Foundation can no for no other
[1:02:15] Foundation can no man lay then that
[1:02:16] which is laid which is Jesus Christ what
[1:02:19] the word
[1:02:21] our foundation is Christ's the word and
[1:02:23] it's the Cornerstone of our faith and
[1:02:24] Peter had the greatest Revelation which
[1:02:26] is Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:02:28] Living God and that's the Cornerstone
[1:02:29] under the New Covenant but we see if we
[1:02:32] go all the way back into Hebrews 11 that
[1:02:34] they had what a different revelation of
[1:02:36] who Christ was all throughout and it was
[1:02:39] him revealing his Plan of Redemption it
[1:02:41] was him revealing the the power and the
[1:02:43] the intention behind his word because
[1:02:46] Christ was not revealed to Abel the way
[1:02:48] he was to Peter
[1:02:50] Noah did not have a revelation of Christ
[1:02:52] the way that Peter did and yet the word
[1:02:55] was being revealed Christ was being
[1:02:57] revealed through all of these different
[1:02:58] things and he's been revealing himself
[1:03:00] all through the last six thousand years
[1:03:02] so if we look at Hebrews 11 it says this
[1:03:05] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:03:08] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[1:03:11] he obtained witness that he was
[1:03:13] righteous
[1:03:15] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:03:18] being dead yet speaketh now listen to
[1:03:20] this he says when Abel offered unto God
[1:03:23] a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and
[1:03:25] God Vindicated Abel by coming down and
[1:03:28] receiving a sacrifice it caused jealousy
[1:03:30] with Cain because he was jealous of his
[1:03:33] brother and slew his brother it started
[1:03:35] at the beginning that when the natural
[1:03:37] and the spiritual you've got two
[1:03:39] lineages here you've got a spiritual
[1:03:41] line and you've got a natural line he
[1:03:43] says you have both Cain and Abel
[1:03:45] worshiped the same God
[1:03:48] we like to draw a big distinction
[1:03:50] between children of God and children
[1:03:51] that are not of God
[1:03:53] but yet we look here and we see that
[1:03:55] they both worshiped the same God
[1:04:00] worship is not what defines you as a
[1:04:01] Christian
[1:04:03] it is a part of being a Christian but
[1:04:05] saying I worship God does not make you
[1:04:07] Christian because Cain comes with
[1:04:09] worship to God
[1:04:11] it says they both built the same kind of
[1:04:13] altars they both worshiped the same God
[1:04:16] at the church same church at the same
[1:04:18] altar among the greatest demonic spirit
[1:04:20] is a religious spirit
[1:04:22] and that's what we're fighting in
[1:04:23] laodicea it's a religious spirit that
[1:04:25] makes you think because of what you do
[1:04:27] just like every other believer that's
[1:04:29] what makes you a Believer no what makes
[1:04:31] you a Believer is the Holy Ghost inside
[1:04:32] of you and that is the only thing that
[1:04:34] makes you a Believer because you can't
[1:04:36] even call Jesus Christ Christ without
[1:04:38] the Holy Ghost inside of you you can't
[1:04:40] truly understand what it means to be
[1:04:41] anointed until you yourself have been
[1:04:43] anointed amen what is the
[1:04:45] differentiation between a child of God
[1:04:47] and a child that's not of God
[1:04:49] the true revelation of the word
[1:04:51] not worship not the church you attend
[1:04:54] but what is the word doing in your life
[1:04:56] it'll be a true revelation
[1:04:58] it says but Cain by carnal reasoning
[1:05:03] brought in the fruits of the land and
[1:05:05] laid them upon the altars of sacrifice
[1:05:07] thinking that surely that this would
[1:05:09] answer God for an atonement oh they're
[1:05:12] coming not just to worship but they're
[1:05:13] coming with intention they're coming
[1:05:15] with an atonement they're trying to
[1:05:17] cover themselves they're trying to make
[1:05:19] themselves acceptable in the presence of
[1:05:21] God
[1:05:22] so he must have brought in as people
[1:05:24] think today apples that Adam and Eve
[1:05:26] took that caused a sin he says but Abel
[1:05:28] had the right sacrifice he knew that it
[1:05:30] was blood that did it so he brought a
[1:05:33] lamb and God received his act sacrifice
[1:05:35] he says now Abel by Faith by Revelation
[1:05:39] no other way there was no Bible written
[1:05:42] so you see the beginning of
[1:05:44] righteousness is God's revealed truth
[1:05:47] and the entire Church of the Living God
[1:05:50] is built upon that notice he says no
[1:05:53] Bible Abel didn't have a Bible and until
[1:05:55] Moses comes there is no scriptures all
[1:05:59] there is is God dealing with people and
[1:06:02] whether he talked to them by Dream by
[1:06:04] Vision an audible voice an unction in
[1:06:06] their heart whatever it might be that
[1:06:08] was the word to those people
[1:06:10] and so Abel had something and he was
[1:06:12] trying to come back into fellowship with
[1:06:14] God he was trying to get restoration to
[1:06:17] what
[1:06:18] to have a relationship again
[1:06:20] he wanted to be able to talk to God he
[1:06:22] wanted God to be able to talk back to
[1:06:24] him he wanted to be accepted back in the
[1:06:26] presence of God because everybody's
[1:06:28] trying to get back to Eden
[1:06:30] everyone wants to get back to what they
[1:06:32] know they lost
[1:06:34] and so Abel comes and he comes by
[1:06:36] Revelation it says he had to bring blood
[1:06:40] God had chosen blood as the original
[1:06:42] covering Abel came with the exact same
[1:06:44] thing that God did but Cain on the other
[1:06:46] hand was bringing the fruits of the land
[1:06:48] now I'm not going to go into original
[1:06:49] sin but if you think that the original
[1:06:51] sin was an apple or any fruit then we're
[1:06:53] sorely mistaken why would an apple cause
[1:06:56] them to be aware of and ashamed of their
[1:06:58] nakedness
[1:06:59] and someone said if apples make us aware
[1:07:01] and ashamed of our nakedness we need to
[1:07:03] pass the apples because nobody's aware
[1:07:05] of it and nobody's ashamed of it anymore
[1:07:07] why did they cover their nakedness if
[1:07:09] the mouth is what it caused them to sin
[1:07:10] it makes no sense amen but Abel brings
[1:07:13] the right sacrifice and God Scripture
[1:07:16] says God had respect unto it
[1:07:18] now it doesn't say specifically what
[1:07:20] that means but if we go to the Mount
[1:07:21] Carmel Showdown with Elijah God showed
[1:07:24] acceptance of a Sacrifice by what fire
[1:07:27] he consumed the Sacrifice from fire from
[1:07:30] heaven and we know it was a type of the
[1:07:31] Holy Ghost today wherever you come and
[1:07:33] you lay your sacrifice you die out you
[1:07:36] lay yourself on the word you take God at
[1:07:38] his word Holy Ghost fire comes down and
[1:07:40] it cleanses you and it makes you what
[1:07:42] fit for service for God
[1:07:44] amen God consumed Abel's offering by
[1:07:47] fire and Cain was left with the most
[1:07:49] beautiful Altar and the most beautiful
[1:07:51] offering unconsumed
[1:07:53] he worshiped he prayed he offered it to
[1:07:56] God and God didn't even recognize it
[1:08:00] God didn't even recognize it why Cain
[1:08:03] had no revelation
[1:08:05] now this is just me
[1:08:07] but sometimes I think Cain understood
[1:08:09] but if Cain acknowledged what that
[1:08:11] original sin was Cain would have had to
[1:08:13] recognize who he was as well
[1:08:15] listen Cain is not listed in any
[1:08:18] genealogy of Adam
[1:08:20] why
[1:08:21] Original Sin
[1:08:23] Cain had to recognize what and who he
[1:08:26] was to make the right sacrifice
[1:08:28] because remember God came down to him
[1:08:31] scripture says Cain was of that Wicked
[1:08:33] one
[1:08:33] doesn't say he was of Adam in fact he's
[1:08:35] never listed says he was of that Wicked
[1:08:37] one
[1:08:38] amen but Hebrews 11 says April's basis
[1:08:41] for sacrifice was faith and what is
[1:08:43] faith we said it before faith is a
[1:08:45] revelation of the will or the word of
[1:08:47] God and it's not just a revelation you
[1:08:49] receive but it's a revelation you act on
[1:08:51] if it only stays in our head you know
[1:08:53] what that does it condemns Us in the end
[1:08:56] if we have Revelation but we don't act
[1:08:58] on it then it condemns us because we did
[1:09:00] not respond to what God gave us
[1:09:02] we've got to act on what God gives us
[1:09:04] amen but what happens is as soon as you
[1:09:06] take that Revelation and you act on it
[1:09:08] it changes you it puts you into action
[1:09:10] it puts you on a path towards God and it
[1:09:13] puts you on the path with God because
[1:09:15] God is trying to restore us back to that
[1:09:17] Eden condition it puts you in a place
[1:09:19] where God can bless you it puts you in a
[1:09:21] place where God can work with you Abel's
[1:09:23] Faith didn't get him back to Eden but it
[1:09:25] got all of humanity started back towards
[1:09:28] Eden
[1:09:29] what was it it was the starting of the
[1:09:31] revelation of the word
[1:09:33] and that Revelation had to come from
[1:09:34] what is the problem itself
[1:09:37] if you don't understand original sin you
[1:09:39] don't understand why Jesus had to be
[1:09:40] born by a virgin
[1:09:43] you want to understand you won't
[1:09:44] understand why it has to be blood
[1:09:46] you don't understand why it has to be a
[1:09:48] lamb
[1:09:49] you don't understand that the fact that
[1:09:51] I'm standing here today born of a woman
[1:09:54] means that I am in sin
[1:09:56] if you don't understand the original sin
[1:09:58] what was it it was the revealing of the
[1:10:00] word and it starts with trying to make
[1:10:02] you acceptable and able sacrifice made
[1:10:05] him acceptable amen
[1:10:07] God told Cain if he'd do the same thing
[1:10:09] he says if thou do us the same thing
[1:10:11] will thou not also be accepted and Cain
[1:10:14] refused to do it why because there was
[1:10:17] nothing in him to respond to the
[1:10:19] revealing of the word
[1:10:21] he couldn't do it he just wouldn't do it
[1:10:23] but Abel's Faith brought him back into
[1:10:25] relationship with God we read read this
[1:10:28] quote it says the beginning of
[1:10:29] righteousness is God's revealed truth
[1:10:32] what the beginning God had to reveal
[1:10:34] himself to Abel God had to reveal what
[1:10:36] was going on and God had to reveal a
[1:10:38] path to get back into his presence
[1:10:39] through Abel and then Abel had to what
[1:10:42] act on it
[1:10:44] we have the word today Abel didn't have
[1:10:46] this
[1:10:47] Abel didn't have 66 books to go and say
[1:10:50] this is the way back all he had was a
[1:10:53] revelation of what God had done and what
[1:10:54] God was going to do
[1:10:56] God had promised I'm going to bruise the
[1:10:58] Serpent's head
[1:10:59] and he gave no explanation and it
[1:11:02] started with an atonement it started
[1:11:04] with an atonement so that God would work
[1:11:06] with his sons and daughters as he was
[1:11:07] going through amen but in the early days
[1:11:10] before Moses nothing was written and so
[1:11:12] we see Abel and we see Noah and we see
[1:11:14] Abraham and all these different ones and
[1:11:16] they don't have a word to go back to but
[1:11:18] God comes down and again we only know
[1:11:20] some of them how it actually worked but
[1:11:22] God will reveal something to them and
[1:11:24] they would change their entire life
[1:11:25] around that one moment with God
[1:11:28] what are we to do
[1:11:30] if one moment with God would change
[1:11:32] their life and cause them to go and do
[1:11:34] the things they did what ought we to do
[1:11:35] as we sit and we have 66 books a
[1:11:38] thousand plus pages of God's talking to
[1:11:40] us of God talking to us
[1:11:42] what are it to do
[1:11:44] but it says the beginning of
[1:11:45] righteousness what is righteousness
[1:11:47] to do the will of God
[1:11:49] that's what righteousness is Amen to be
[1:11:51] found pleasing to God why because you're
[1:11:53] in his purpose you're in his plan in his
[1:11:56] timing with his motive and his objective
[1:11:58] you're stepping literally right into the
[1:12:00] word of God that's what righteousness is
[1:12:02] is when you step into the word how by
[1:12:04] faith
[1:12:05] by faith
[1:12:08] your faith in the word of God to act on
[1:12:10] the word of God to live by the
[1:12:12] revelation of God is righteousness
[1:12:15] but it's his righteousness because it's
[1:12:17] not you that decides it it's not you
[1:12:19] that comes up with how you're going to
[1:12:20] do or what you're going to do or when
[1:12:21] you're going to do but it's God opening
[1:12:23] himself up to you and he gives you the
[1:12:24] Revelation and behind that comes Faith
[1:12:26] to put you into action to do what God
[1:12:28] wants you to do
[1:12:29] it's a work of Grace from start to
[1:12:31] finish that he's even talking to us
[1:12:33] that he's even open to us in these
[1:12:34] things but we see these things these
[1:12:37] actions of great faith in the scriptures
[1:12:38] long before the word was ever written
[1:12:40] down and yet God would speak to men and
[1:12:42] women and they would respond in perfect
[1:12:44] obedience eventually
[1:12:47] and God would produce the word exactly
[1:12:48] in their lives amen
[1:12:50] we look at the next one we look at Enoch
[1:12:52] it says by faith Enoch was translated
[1:12:55] that he should not see death but was and
[1:12:57] was not found because God had translated
[1:13:00] him but before his translation he had
[1:13:03] this testimony that he pleased God he
[1:13:06] says now but without faith it is
[1:13:08] impossible to please him for he that
[1:13:09] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:13:11] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:13:14] diligently seek him now we're in the age
[1:13:16] of resurrection and Rapture now
[1:13:19] this is this is it this is the final age
[1:13:21] it's the seventh Church agents the
[1:13:22] laodicean church age this is the rapture
[1:13:24] and Resurrection season it's the
[1:13:25] declared end of the Gentile plan of God
[1:13:27] Amen and that ends with a resurrection
[1:13:29] and a Rapture before tribulation comes
[1:13:31] our way but notice the Enoch he
[1:13:33] experienced the Rapture before we ever
[1:13:35] did and if you notice Enoch is the
[1:13:38] seventh from Adam
[1:13:39] and what is it it was a type of the
[1:13:41] seventh Church age it was the type of
[1:13:43] the Bride that goes before tribulation
[1:13:45] ever comes
[1:13:46] and it was God showing us that what was
[1:13:48] going to happen but Enoch walked for 500
[1:13:51] years with God and then he took a
[1:13:53] Rapture and you say brother John how are
[1:13:55] we going to do it maybe the best of us
[1:13:57] will be here 70 or 80 years
[1:13:59] how are we going to achieve in 70 or 80
[1:14:02] years when Enoch took 500 years to
[1:14:03] achieve or under an anointing
[1:14:07] worrying the word of God to go in this
[1:14:09] that's how we're going to do it is
[1:14:10] because this is the time this is the
[1:14:12] season this is the anointing that's on
[1:14:13] the bride it's an eagle anointing that
[1:14:15] lifts us up above the trouble rather
[1:14:17] than making us have courage to go
[1:14:19] through it amen we hold to the word and
[1:14:21] we're in expectation but the anointing
[1:14:23] of the church is to go up not to go
[1:14:25] through
[1:14:27] right our tribulations right now our
[1:14:29] testing our trial is right now and
[1:14:31] that's Faith to take us through here
[1:14:32] until he takes us up and out of these
[1:14:34] things but if you want to know what a
[1:14:35] Rapture Ready Church looks like we look
[1:14:37] at Enoch for a bit amen if we want rap
[1:14:39] stream Faith let's look at Enoch's walk
[1:14:41] because Enoch dedicated his life to
[1:14:44] Walking with God for 500 years Church
[1:14:47] 500 years and he never had a Rapture
[1:14:49] until he had a rapture
[1:14:52] I don't know what was going through
[1:14:54] Enoch's mind I don't know if Enoch had
[1:14:55] this Revelation that I'm gonna go in a
[1:14:57] Rapture but Enoch the scripture says he
[1:14:59] walked with God he didn't just walk in
[1:15:01] the morning
[1:15:02] he didn't just walk in the afternoon but
[1:15:05] day after day after day Enoch walked
[1:15:07] with God morning noon and night Enoch
[1:15:11] dedicated his life to Walking with God
[1:15:13] and it was by faith
[1:15:16] by Faith by a revelation that God wanted
[1:15:18] to be spending time with him what Abel
[1:15:21] had showed him how to be accepted and
[1:15:23] under that acceptance comes what the
[1:15:25] ability to go into the presence of God
[1:15:27] and so Enoch says if there's a way made
[1:15:30] I'm going to walk in the way that's made
[1:15:31] if I'm accepted now under the blood of a
[1:15:34] shed lamb then I'm shed blood of a lamb
[1:15:36] then I'm going to go in and I'm going to
[1:15:37] take full advantage of that revealing of
[1:15:39] that word and I'm going to take it and
[1:15:40] go on to the next step
[1:15:42] as soon as you're accepted you've got
[1:15:43] access to that amen but Enoch I believe
[1:15:47] he had like that one of Abraham the
[1:15:48] revelation of Abraham that were pilgrims
[1:15:50] and strangers
[1:15:52] that ought to be in our hearts today
[1:15:54] that Enoch recognized that I'm not of
[1:15:56] this world
[1:15:57] and we ought to be looking and saying
[1:15:59] this world has nothing for me
[1:16:01] absolutely nothing there's nothing that
[1:16:04] I can identify with in this world you
[1:16:05] walk around I was driving with my wife
[1:16:07] yesterday and you see the the state of
[1:16:09] undress you see the nature you see the
[1:16:11] idiocy the insanity of what's going on
[1:16:13] in this world and you say this cannot be
[1:16:16] my home
[1:16:17] I don't identify with it I don't like it
[1:16:21] all I want to do is get out
[1:16:23] and I believe Enoch came to the place
[1:16:25] where he put everything he had into
[1:16:27] getting out
[1:16:30] and the world wasn't even as bad as it
[1:16:31] was yet
[1:16:33] but yet he said I can't do it but his
[1:16:35] Rapture Revelation Enoch's Faith said
[1:16:37] God is pleased with me
[1:16:41] he walked with God
[1:16:43] and God kept coming back to him and God
[1:16:45] kept walking with him and talking with
[1:16:46] him and that came to the point where
[1:16:48] Enoch said God is pleased with me
[1:16:51] now let me say it again we're nothing
[1:16:54] I'm nothing you're nothing but God has
[1:16:56] already said I'm going to have a bride
[1:16:58] that is spotless she's dressed in white
[1:17:01] she's without spot she's without
[1:17:03] wrinkles she's acceptable she's the
[1:17:04] apple of my eye he's already declared it
[1:17:07] and because we're accepted in his sight
[1:17:09] now we can come in and we can have the
[1:17:10] same Rapture Ready what Revelation that
[1:17:13] Enoch did I please him
[1:17:15] I please him
[1:17:17] but I've got to be walking by faith to
[1:17:18] do it what pleases God when we obey his
[1:17:21] word when we take him at his word simple
[1:17:24] faith in the word of God is what pleases
[1:17:25] him we saw it with Saul so many times
[1:17:27] was he go in and he would make a
[1:17:29] sacrifice to God and God Samuel said to
[1:17:32] him God doesn't want your sacrifices
[1:17:34] Saul he just wants you to do what he
[1:17:36] said
[1:17:37] don't go with the grand gesture
[1:17:40] we love grand gestures as humans because
[1:17:42] we think it makes us more acceptable or
[1:17:44] God likes us better with the grand
[1:17:45] gesture and all God wants us to do is
[1:17:47] just take him at his word
[1:17:49] it's so simple take him at his word walk
[1:17:53] with God trust him to do what he said
[1:17:55] he's going to do
[1:17:56] we've been given a Bible that's full of
[1:17:58] stories
[1:17:59] and history has proven it
[1:18:01] you know they thought for so long I've
[1:18:03] shared this they thought for so long
[1:18:04] that Jericho wasn't real and then
[1:18:06] finally they dug down far enough and
[1:18:08] they found exactly what happened to
[1:18:09] Jericho and it matches exactly what the
[1:18:11] scripture says
[1:18:12] they couldn't find evidence for King
[1:18:14] David and all of a sudden they're
[1:18:15] starting to find evidence for King David
[1:18:16] you think that would you think that
[1:18:18] would be an easy one King David I mean
[1:18:19] he's he he's the Cornerstone King of the
[1:18:22] Jews you'd think there'd be tons of that
[1:18:24] but no there was nothing
[1:18:25] but now they're starting to find it
[1:18:28] what they're finding proves the history
[1:18:29] of the scriptures but by faith we
[1:18:32] hopefully have already received it and
[1:18:33] so we know that what he's done shows
[1:18:36] that what he's going to do is going to
[1:18:37] happen that what he said he's going to
[1:18:39] do is going to happen amen we have
[1:18:41] everything in here we have encouragement
[1:18:42] we have correction we have direction we
[1:18:44] have anointing we have praise worship
[1:18:45] all these things in there everything
[1:18:47] that we have need of and so all we have
[1:18:49] to do is take it and say I'll walk with
[1:18:51] this I'll take this
[1:18:53] I'll take it I shared that quote you
[1:18:55] know brother Brown would talk about he
[1:18:57] say you know I like to look around the
[1:18:58] things that I own
[1:18:59] we read the word and we see the things
[1:19:01] that he's offered to us
[1:19:03] you start walking in that and you watch
[1:19:04] what God starts doing in your life
[1:19:07] look at Noah
[1:19:09] it says by faith Noah being warned of
[1:19:12] God of things has not yet not seen as
[1:19:15] yet moved with fear prepared an ark to
[1:19:18] the saving of his house by the which he
[1:19:20] condemned the world and became heir of
[1:19:22] the righteousness with which is by faith
[1:19:25] God just takes one scripture here to
[1:19:27] summarize the entire thing that Noah did
[1:19:29] in his life and God warns Noah by
[1:19:31] revealing the time that he's in the
[1:19:33] season that he's in and what God's going
[1:19:35] to do in it and it's a revelation of God
[1:19:37] nobody else get this gets this
[1:19:38] revelation God comes and talks to one
[1:19:40] man and everybody else has to hear what
[1:19:42] that man says God doesn't come to the
[1:19:44] entire population one by one and say I'm
[1:19:46] going to destroy the Earth he comes to
[1:19:48] one man and he lets that man's actions
[1:19:50] and response to that Revelation let
[1:19:53] people know how much he really believes
[1:19:54] it it wasn't just words but no one now
[1:19:57] the scripture says that he moved
[1:20:00] he moved with fear the revelation of
[1:20:03] what God was going to do moved him and
[1:20:06] it caused him to change his entire focus
[1:20:08] in his life
[1:20:09] and he started building an ark and he
[1:20:12] built and he built and he built and he
[1:20:13] let nothing distract him every minute
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:16] we need to be moving under the
[1:20:18] inspiration of the word not sitting back
[1:20:21] well what God's going to do is what
[1:20:22] God's going to do and I'm a child of his
[1:20:23] he's going to take it no he's provided a
[1:20:25] way for you by the word of God he's
[1:20:27] revealed his word he's opened his word
[1:20:29] and he's asking you to just step into it
[1:20:31] to follow it to obey these things amen
[1:20:34] we need to be moving under this
[1:20:35] understanding the revelation of the word
[1:20:37] for this age it's a rapturing word
[1:20:39] that's what God's trying to get us to
[1:20:41] we're at a time where fire is coming not
[1:20:43] water
[1:20:44] there's no getting away from it this
[1:20:46] time the whole thing's going to burn up
[1:20:48] amen we ought to be moving what did
[1:20:50] Noah's fate do it moved him with fear to
[1:20:52] do what prepare an ark
[1:20:54] to follow God's provided way to get out
[1:20:56] of things amen and what did he do he
[1:20:58] convinced his family
[1:21:01] he convinced his family he was concerned
[1:21:03] he knew he believed that God was going
[1:21:05] to destroy the Earth by water and so he
[1:21:07] convinced them to join him in the ark
[1:21:10] no easy thing
[1:21:12] maybe after the first year it wasn't so
[1:21:14] bad but when you're going for decades
[1:21:18] decades
[1:21:20] building this stupid Ark I imagine they
[1:21:23] started calling it that after a while
[1:21:24] you know
[1:21:25] just so annoying the day in the day out
[1:21:29] why do we have to do this why does it
[1:21:31] have to be so big
[1:21:33] why does it have to be with this type of
[1:21:35] wood we have to do every every scene my
[1:21:37] brother was just that they've got that
[1:21:39] Noah's Ark down in the States you look
[1:21:40] at it it is huge
[1:21:42] can you imagine being the one that had
[1:21:44] to go and put the pitch in every single
[1:21:46] line every single seam every single
[1:21:48] crack
[1:21:49] you're the tar guy
[1:21:51] for the next 10 years
[1:21:52] what are you doing today pitch in the
[1:21:55] cracks
[1:21:56] what are you doing tomorrow pitch in the
[1:21:58] cracks what are you doing the day after
[1:22:00] next month next year I'm gonna be
[1:22:02] putting pitch in the cracks
[1:22:04] praise the Lord
[1:22:08] Sometimes It's a Grind
[1:22:10] it ain't always easy I was talking
[1:22:12] brother Paul you know he had took
[1:22:14] service on Wednesday then he had Sunday
[1:22:16] school this morning which brother Joe
[1:22:18] thankfully took from and then he's got
[1:22:19] youth group it ain't always fun to sit
[1:22:21] there and study and study and pray and
[1:22:24] prepare and prepare
[1:22:25] It Ain't Easy Being a mother is it day
[1:22:28] in day out no breaks
[1:22:31] serving and then you serve on top of
[1:22:33] that with the local body
[1:22:34] it's not easy is it brother Josh get
[1:22:37] pressure to come up and find the will of
[1:22:38] the Lord for a service to sing and
[1:22:40] worship in these things
[1:22:42] sometimes it's just pitch after pitch
[1:22:44] after pitch day in and day out fill in
[1:22:47] the cracks
[1:22:49] but they had to do it because that was
[1:22:51] God's design
[1:22:52] they had to take him at his word and
[1:22:53] they had to go through the heavy times
[1:22:55] so that they could actually float when
[1:22:57] it all came down amen didn't matter what
[1:22:59] they said
[1:23:01] listen if you really believe would you
[1:23:03] believe it'll show in your life it'll
[1:23:05] show in the way you live day to day
[1:23:06] Noah's life showed that he believed that
[1:23:08] there was water coming
[1:23:11] because he followed God to the letter
[1:23:12] and built the exact design of a boat
[1:23:14] that God did they had said there's never
[1:23:16] been rain the meteorologists of that day
[1:23:19] remember all that came was a mist from
[1:23:21] the earth they had never had rain come
[1:23:23] from the sky and the Judgment that
[1:23:25] Noah's talking about has never happened
[1:23:26] before
[1:23:29] they were smart people back then they
[1:23:31] said there's nothing up there
[1:23:33] nothing to come down
[1:23:35] it's all bogus science has proved it
[1:23:38] our instruments can't measure anything
[1:23:40] up there there's no moisture in the
[1:23:42] atmosphere Noah what are you talking
[1:23:43] about it's gonna rain
[1:23:46] It's Gonna Rain get in help me build
[1:23:49] this
[1:23:50] and only ate God in
[1:23:52] and even one of them was not a real
[1:23:53] believer
[1:23:54] but he believed enough to get out
[1:23:59] he says this you've got to First find
[1:24:01] the will of God remember last service I
[1:24:04] said
[1:24:05] that means that our Focus not ought to
[1:24:07] be on do we believe it's do we have the
[1:24:09] will of God to believe in
[1:24:11] we'd spend as much time seeking as we
[1:24:13] did believing then we'd get a lot more
[1:24:14] of what we believe for because we take
[1:24:16] the time to find out what God's will is
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:19] he says and then if you really have
[1:24:20] received the seed in your heart then you
[1:24:22] can be persistent there's nothing going
[1:24:24] to move you no matter what wisdom man
[1:24:26] tries to say it's not so and it's not
[1:24:28] this and that and the other it doesn't
[1:24:29] move you one iota because you know what
[1:24:32] the will of God is
[1:24:35] he spoke it into your heart your faith
[1:24:37] sits there and it'll hold right on no
[1:24:40] matter if there's no more than like a
[1:24:41] grain of mustard seed it'll bring you
[1:24:44] right out to the place
[1:24:46] the will of God
[1:24:48] little Mustard Seed of Faith you hold it
[1:24:51] there it'll bring you to the place where
[1:24:53] it puts you right into the will of God
[1:24:56] the purpose of God the word of God the
[1:24:59] manifestation of what that Faith was for
[1:25:01] in the first place
[1:25:02] what does our life declare this morning
[1:25:04] we're looking at Noah his life declared
[1:25:06] there's judgment coming
[1:25:08] and there's a way out
[1:25:11] what's our life declaring this morning
[1:25:14] look at your life
[1:25:15] how do you spend your time
[1:25:18] how do you talk with people
[1:25:20] what's your focus in life that'll tell
[1:25:22] you what you really believe
[1:25:24] is it on getting comfortable or is it on
[1:25:27] getting out
[1:25:29] what are we building
[1:25:30] and are we building it with enough
[1:25:32] purpose that somebody can look at it and
[1:25:33] say he's got something she's got
[1:25:35] something she's convinced
[1:25:37] he knows something I don't know what is
[1:25:39] it and why is he living the way he's
[1:25:40] living why is he doing things the way
[1:25:42] he's doing it's because I believe
[1:25:43] there's a Rapture and a Resurrection
[1:25:45] coming before tribulation hits
[1:25:48] Noah acted on his Revelation it says he
[1:25:50] became heir of the righteousness which
[1:25:52] is by faith Noah's actions Noah's faith
[1:25:55] in the word of God made him act on the
[1:25:57] word of God and by that he received the
[1:26:00] righteousness of God by faith
[1:26:03] then we go to Abraham it says by faith
[1:26:05] Abraham when he was called to go out
[1:26:07] into a place which he should hear he
[1:26:10] should have to receive for an
[1:26:11] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[1:26:14] knowing whether he went we read about
[1:26:17] we've read about Abraham the Book of
[1:26:18] Genesis and we see the great detail that
[1:26:20] God did there but when you look at the
[1:26:22] starting point God literally just comes
[1:26:25] to Abraham and he gives him this big
[1:26:27] heavy command
[1:26:28] look at what God says let's go back to
[1:26:30] the original in Genesis it says now the
[1:26:32] Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out
[1:26:34] of thy country and from thy Kindred and
[1:26:37] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[1:26:39] I will show thee That's Heavy that is a
[1:26:42] total separation and you'll see it time
[1:26:44] and time again in the word that God's
[1:26:46] word calls for what a total separation
[1:26:48] from unbelief
[1:26:50] God didn't call Abram's family
[1:26:52] God called Abraham God didn't call lot
[1:26:55] God called Abraham he said Abraham get
[1:26:59] away from all of them why because
[1:27:00] there'll be a ball and chain on you the
[1:27:02] rest of your life if you don't separate
[1:27:04] now I'm taking you I'm going to do
[1:27:06] something with you it's for you it's not
[1:27:08] for them so you've got to get away from
[1:27:09] them
[1:27:11] that means what we can't walk in the
[1:27:12] call of somebody else
[1:27:14] I can't be walking because brother Mark
[1:27:16] and sister Maureen or brother Gerald and
[1:27:18] sister Betty or brother Bob and sister
[1:27:19] Brenda have gone before me
[1:27:21] that's an inspiration but that can't be
[1:27:22] my call
[1:27:24] because what's going to happen is
[1:27:25] they're going to come a challenge to
[1:27:26] that call at some point and I'm not
[1:27:27] going to have the Revelation that they
[1:27:29] had which is that God called me out God
[1:27:31] made me separate God made me go where I
[1:27:33] am God made me do what I'm doing amen
[1:27:36] what you'll come to friction eventually
[1:27:38] if I'm walking in your call
[1:27:40] it'll come to friction it'll come to
[1:27:42] fussing we'll come to a junction and
[1:27:43] what will happen is we'll split off
[1:27:44] because my call is not your call and
[1:27:46] I'll end up going the way that lot did
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:49] we've got to have our own call we've got
[1:27:50] to have our own experience with Christ
[1:27:53] listen to this he says in Abraham one
[1:27:55] day when he was perhaps out in the field
[1:27:57] hunting or whatever he was doing picking
[1:27:59] berries or whatever his job might have
[1:28:01] been he met God
[1:28:02] and from that time he was changed
[1:28:06] he could call things that were not as
[1:28:08] though they were because he had met God
[1:28:11] he knew the minute and the hour that he
[1:28:14] met God
[1:28:15] let me ask you this do you know when you
[1:28:17] met God
[1:28:19] because the the word is not just here
[1:28:22] the word is a person
[1:28:24] and you've got to have a personal
[1:28:26] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:28:29] the the the the Living Word
[1:28:33] to you the person of the word has to be
[1:28:35] it is not in Doctrine
[1:28:38] it is not in going to church but it's
[1:28:40] when the person of Christ comes down and
[1:28:43] speaks to you I remember when I gave my
[1:28:45] heart to the Lord I've said it many
[1:28:47] times before I didn't want to get saved
[1:28:49] but yet there was something drawing me
[1:28:51] to give my heart to the Lord for many
[1:28:52] many years but the night I gave my heart
[1:28:55] to the Lord was when he spoke to me
[1:28:56] personally
[1:28:58] personally and I knew he was talking to
[1:29:00] me and no one else
[1:29:02] because what it was personal to me it
[1:29:05] was so specific to me that it could mean
[1:29:06] nobody else
[1:29:08] that's how I knew he was calling me and
[1:29:10] that's where my anchor is is that he
[1:29:12] personally met me and called me
[1:29:15] so it didn't matter if brother Gerald
[1:29:17] stayed or went didn't matter if my mom
[1:29:19] went to a state or wait didn't matter
[1:29:20] what my dad did didn't matter what
[1:29:22] people around me did didn't matter
[1:29:23] people left people came in up and down
[1:29:25] in and out had nothing to do with it
[1:29:26] because he called me and that's what I
[1:29:28] rest in is I met him personally that
[1:29:31] night and he's never left me since
[1:29:33] that's where I rest amen
[1:29:36] you need to know the day and the hour
[1:29:37] that you met God
[1:29:39] personally
[1:29:40] he says it changed him and God called
[1:29:42] him to be the father of many nations he
[1:29:44] believed God and he believed his promise
[1:29:46] because he had met God 25 years later
[1:29:48] they were discussed discussing trying to
[1:29:50] discuss him tell him that he had
[1:29:52] believed something was wrong but the
[1:29:54] Bible said he got stronger all the time
[1:29:56] giving praise to God that because he
[1:29:59] knew that God had to keep the promise he
[1:30:02] says and when man meets God it changes
[1:30:04] his makeup it gives him a super sense as
[1:30:07] I was speaking the other night the
[1:30:09] natural man only has the five senses but
[1:30:11] the believer when he meets God he gets
[1:30:13] something different it's a super sense
[1:30:15] that lifts him up above the Shadows it
[1:30:18] makes him believe things that are
[1:30:20] impossible to come to pass
[1:30:23] have you believed that which is
[1:30:25] impossible
[1:30:27] you're sitting here
[1:30:29] that's impossible
[1:30:31] you're staying here that's impossible
[1:30:33] you're pressing on that's impossible
[1:30:35] when we look at the rest of this world
[1:30:38] he says it makes him believe things that
[1:30:40] are impossible to come to pass he still
[1:30:42] believes they will come to pass because
[1:30:44] God said so when a man meets God he says
[1:30:48] something takes place
[1:30:50] God told Abraham get out
[1:30:52] leave it all
[1:30:56] drop it
[1:30:57] dump it
[1:31:00] didn't say get your best price for your
[1:31:01] business we don't know what Abraham had
[1:31:02] or did
[1:31:03] maybe had a successful business
[1:31:06] maybe you had a ranch maybe had a farm
[1:31:07] maybe he was a Tradesman of some sort we
[1:31:09] don't know
[1:31:11] we know he left with something
[1:31:13] because God blessed it but God said
[1:31:15] separated out
[1:31:16] get out
[1:31:18] leave it behind
[1:31:20] and get moving because I've got
[1:31:22] something I want to do for you
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:26] we don't know what Abraham had heard
[1:31:27] before that we don't know that Abraham
[1:31:29] had a relationship with God of any sort
[1:31:31] all we know is there came a time and God
[1:31:32] chose it and he said I'm going to do
[1:31:34] something with you Abraham literally
[1:31:36] plucked him out of the crowd and said
[1:31:38] this is my man this is my Prophet this
[1:31:40] is my child and then he started
[1:31:41] revealing himself to him
[1:31:44] but watch what he said he says and I
[1:31:46] will make of thee a great nation and I
[1:31:49] will bless thee and make thy name great
[1:31:51] and thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[1:31:54] bless them that bless thee and curse him
[1:31:55] that curseth thee and in thee shall all
[1:31:57] families of the earth be blessed
[1:32:00] so Abraham departed as the Lord had
[1:32:02] spoken unto him
[1:32:03] now you notice here Abraham's part of
[1:32:06] this Covenant is nowhere
[1:32:08] because remember God had given them a
[1:32:10] two-sided Covenant in Egypt in Eden and
[1:32:13] they broke it and so God knew he can't
[1:32:15] give a two-sided Covenant anymore
[1:32:17] so now he gives a one-sided Covenant and
[1:32:19] this is to Abraham and this is to
[1:32:20] Abraham's Royal seed this is the lineage
[1:32:22] of Faith he says I'm gonna do it
[1:32:26] I'm gonna do it
[1:32:28] Abraham has no part in this he says I'll
[1:32:31] make you a great nation all bless thee
[1:32:33] I'll make your name great I'll make you
[1:32:34] a blessing I'll bless him that bless you
[1:32:36] curse him and curse of you I will I will
[1:32:38] I will I will
[1:32:40] where's Abraham in all of this
[1:32:42] Abraham only has one thing to do
[1:32:45] have faith and act
[1:32:47] that's all he's got to do now you know
[1:32:49] the scripture says God had told Abraham
[1:32:52] that means there was a period of time
[1:32:54] before God said it and Abraham did it
[1:32:57] and then he goes out and Abraham doesn't
[1:32:59] do what God tells him to do
[1:33:01] you notice that he takes a lot with him
[1:33:02] God said separate from all your family
[1:33:04] and we don't know why he took law maybe
[1:33:06] lot was was you know he had lost his
[1:33:08] parents or something so maybe he did it
[1:33:10] out of out of a sense of obligation or
[1:33:13] maybe emotion whatever it might be but
[1:33:15] until lot Got Away God couldn't even
[1:33:17] confirm the Covenant but it's still a
[1:33:19] one-sided Covenant
[1:33:21] what was he doing he had to bring
[1:33:23] Abraham to a place where Abraham would
[1:33:24] step into the Covenant that's all where
[1:33:27] Abraham would completely obey the word
[1:33:30] of God and he never got that full
[1:33:32] Covenant God never talked to him again
[1:33:33] until Abraham comes out and separates
[1:33:36] from lot
[1:33:38] but you know how God did it
[1:33:40] he blessed them so much that it caused
[1:33:42] friction
[1:33:43] you know they say there can't be two
[1:33:45] sheriffs in the town
[1:33:46] listen you're his child
[1:33:48] God takes care of you
[1:33:50] God meet your needs he's Jehovah Jireh
[1:33:53] but he blessed them so much that the two
[1:33:55] of them couldn't be in the same place at
[1:33:56] the same time notice Abraham and lot
[1:33:58] never had issues with each other but the
[1:34:00] people that were backed up behind him
[1:34:01] had issues
[1:34:03] Abraham and lot had a good relationship
[1:34:05] and they resolved it amicably in the end
[1:34:07] but the servants the people underneath
[1:34:08] them couldn't get along because they
[1:34:10] were too busy fighting for their masters
[1:34:11] rather than trying to see the big
[1:34:13] picture and God used His blessings to
[1:34:15] bring friction to cause a separation
[1:34:19] God's Got You
[1:34:22] but he doesn't care if we got out of
[1:34:23] here rich or poor middle class
[1:34:26] what he cares about is getting us into
[1:34:28] the Covenant
[1:34:29] so he got Abraham to a place where
[1:34:31] Abraham willingly separated
[1:34:34] where life was so difficult even with
[1:34:36] his great blessings that he says listen
[1:34:38] we got to make a change here so a lot
[1:34:40] you pick first
[1:34:43] that's how you know you're a child of
[1:34:45] God you give the other person the
[1:34:46] opportunity you go the way you want to
[1:34:48] go I'll take what's left
[1:34:50] why because he had the Covenant to fall
[1:34:52] back on
[1:34:53] he believed the Covenant lot had nothing
[1:34:56] it's a lot needed to go where it was
[1:34:58] good Abraham knew the Covenant would
[1:34:59] make wherever he went good
[1:35:03] God was bringing Abraham to Abram to
[1:35:05] that place of total obedience
[1:35:07] amen it was unconditional
[1:35:09] the work was going to be Gods but
[1:35:11] Abraham had to step into that Covenant
[1:35:13] it's waiting there
[1:35:15] this is waiting here
[1:35:17] it's unconditional
[1:35:19] God's just asking you step into it
[1:35:21] separate
[1:35:23] separate from unbelief step in in faith
[1:35:25] and see what he'll do
[1:35:26] and Abraham did the same thing that
[1:35:28] Enoch did he walked with God
[1:35:30] but we look in Genesis and we see it
[1:35:32] Through The Eyes of a of an imperfect
[1:35:33] atonement and he had his ups and downs
[1:35:35] he had his ins and outs he didn't always
[1:35:37] stay in the land but he kept coming back
[1:35:39] to the promise and the scripture
[1:35:40] testifies that he what he continued to
[1:35:43] get stronger in faith calling those
[1:35:45] things that were not as though they were
[1:35:47] why he had a revelation of the word to
[1:35:49] him
[1:35:50] that God had given him personally but
[1:35:52] watch how it can how it continues this
[1:35:54] morning he says by faith he sojourned in
[1:35:56] the land of promise as in a strange
[1:35:58] country dwelling in Tabernacles that
[1:36:00] means tense with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:36:02] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[1:36:04] he looked for a city which had
[1:36:05] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:36:07] god listen I just spent three days in a
[1:36:09] tent
[1:36:10] it's no way to live
[1:36:12] it's no way to live it's no wonder they
[1:36:14] wanted a city which had foundations
[1:36:18] but they were in obedience as long as
[1:36:19] they were what walking in the land that
[1:36:21] God had given to him it says through
[1:36:23] faith also Sarah herself now we're
[1:36:25] switching from Abram to Sarah
[1:36:27] that said by faith for everyone else
[1:36:29] with Sarah says through faith
[1:36:31] also Sarah herself received strength to
[1:36:33] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:36:35] child when she was past age because she
[1:36:37] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:36:40] therefore spraying there even of one and
[1:36:42] him as good as did as many as the stars
[1:36:45] of the skies in multitude and as the
[1:36:47] sand which is by the seashore
[1:36:48] innumerable that through the lens of the
[1:36:50] perfect sacrifice Christ Jesus we see a
[1:36:53] very different picture of Sarah compared
[1:36:54] to what we see in Genesis
[1:36:56] under the blood of bulls and goats we
[1:36:57] see a very imperfect woman
[1:36:59] we see a very imperfect man in Abraham
[1:37:01] but now as he's writing this from the
[1:37:03] what looking through the blood of Christ
[1:37:05] all we see from Sarah's faith
[1:37:07] that's all we see
[1:37:09] that's all he sees with us
[1:37:12] the same cover the blood covers the sin
[1:37:14] and what he sees is the faith that comes
[1:37:16] out and steps into the word that's the
[1:37:18] effect of the New Covenant the Grace
[1:37:19] Covenant amen but the scripture says
[1:37:21] through faith
[1:37:22] Sarah receives strength Faith was a
[1:37:24] vehicle
[1:37:26] Faith was a carrier for the strength
[1:37:28] that came to cause her to be able to
[1:37:30] conceive seed and I don't want to get
[1:37:32] into this too heavily this morning
[1:37:33] because this is really the where we're
[1:37:35] going to go for the next Services we
[1:37:36] talk about virtue but notice that
[1:37:38] Sarah's Faith was that she judged God to
[1:37:40] be faithful
[1:37:42] her faith said you're faithful
[1:37:45] she believed that he would do it and
[1:37:48] though she tried in many different ways
[1:37:49] she still believed that he was going to
[1:37:51] do it one way or the other amen her
[1:37:53] faith was that she would do what he said
[1:37:54] he would do
[1:37:55] notice God never had a conversation with
[1:38:00] Sarah
[1:38:01] God talked to Abraham
[1:38:03] God came to Abraham God gave his
[1:38:06] Covenant to Abraham God gave visions and
[1:38:07] dreams to Abraham Gall of God's
[1:38:10] conversations God's covenant God's
[1:38:11] promise was through her headship
[1:38:14] Sarah never got a word directly from the
[1:38:17] Lord
[1:38:18] she had to hear it all secondhand
[1:38:23] but she still have faith
[1:38:25] because she received it from the one
[1:38:26] that received it she believed it in the
[1:38:28] one that have received it amen
[1:38:30] God gave Abraham the Covenant sign
[1:38:32] before Isaac ever came along she had no
[1:38:34] Covenant sign she had nothing it was all
[1:38:36] through Abraham
[1:38:38] Sarah was just along for the ride
[1:38:40] but she had faith
[1:38:42] she had faith in these things but what
[1:38:45] there came a day when the Lord himself
[1:38:46] dropped down in flesh
[1:38:49] and he came to visit Abraham
[1:38:51] and notice he still isn't talking to
[1:38:53] Sarah
[1:38:54] 's in the tent she's not sitting out
[1:38:57] there with Abram
[1:38:58] and these three men that are there
[1:39:00] but the promise was to Abraham but Sarah
[1:39:02] receives it through faith because what
[1:39:04] she's a part of Abraham the covenants to
[1:39:07] Abraham
[1:39:09] but the manifestations through Sarah
[1:39:12] we're a part of Christ
[1:39:14] promises through him the manifestations
[1:39:16] through us
[1:39:17] it's just a type of what he's doing
[1:39:18] today God himself comes down to Abraham
[1:39:21] to talk to him for 24 Years brother
[1:39:23] hammermeister said remember that God
[1:39:25] talked to Abraham if you read everything
[1:39:27] God said to Abraham it took about eight
[1:39:28] minutes so Abraham walked for 24 years
[1:39:31] on eight minutes of conversation with
[1:39:33] god
[1:39:34] and there were many years where God
[1:39:35] didn't do anything with him but he's
[1:39:37] been what dirty Dusty living in tents
[1:39:40] right tents are no fun
[1:39:42] they're not sound proof they're not dirt
[1:39:45] proof they're not bug proof and after a
[1:39:47] while they're not waterproof
[1:39:48] things come and go smells come and go
[1:39:51] it just ain't the same as a house that's
[1:39:53] built on foundations
[1:39:55] and Sarah was dragged through that
[1:39:57] for 24 years
[1:39:59] if you like a clean house a tent is not
[1:40:01] for you
[1:40:03] if you like being separated from the
[1:40:04] elements a tent is not for you if you
[1:40:06] like privacy intent is not for you if
[1:40:08] you like decorations a tent is not for
[1:40:10] you
[1:40:11] but she had been doing it for 24 years
[1:40:13] and God himself comes down now you say
[1:40:16] that wasn't God's scripture says this
[1:40:18] it says the Lord appeared unto him in
[1:40:21] the plains of memory and he sat in the
[1:40:23] tent Door In the Heat of the day
[1:40:25] it says this the angel came to Abraham
[1:40:27] in the form of a man and Abraham
[1:40:30] spiritually recognized him and he sat
[1:40:32] down with his back to the tent and
[1:40:34] Abraham fed him and he said Abraham I'm
[1:40:36] going to visit you about the time of
[1:40:38] life Abraham was a hundred Sarah was 90.
[1:40:40] they've been looking for that promise
[1:40:42] for years and years and years and years
[1:40:46] though we Terry
[1:40:49] he's not going to tarry forever
[1:40:51] he says them who are looking for the
[1:40:53] coming of the Lord is watching every
[1:40:55] move blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:57] they're watching for something to take
[1:40:59] place just like a piece of metal to a
[1:41:02] magnet they're watching for it to take
[1:41:04] place Abraham was looking for it that
[1:41:06] promise that God had made this scripture
[1:41:09] we read on Sarah I think it's one of the
[1:41:10] greatest scriptures for the Bride of
[1:41:12] this age
[1:41:13] because the question is how is he going
[1:41:15] to do it when there's nothing in us to
[1:41:17] do it
[1:41:18] when we are incapable of it ourselves
[1:41:20] when we're past time past due it's gone
[1:41:23] on so long it's It seems impossible but
[1:41:26] yet he comes and he personally confirms
[1:41:28] the promise to Abraham and it's going to
[1:41:30] come all the way through Sarah but what
[1:41:32] this this scene that we have on the
[1:41:34] plains of memory it shows us three
[1:41:36] things for the bride it shows us the
[1:41:37] sign of God
[1:41:39] it shows us the faithfulness of God and
[1:41:42] it shows the impact of the personal
[1:41:44] presence of God
[1:41:46] and that's all three things that had to
[1:41:47] happen in this age
[1:41:49] he had to come down
[1:41:50] he had to remind us of his word he had
[1:41:53] to make himself known
[1:41:55] and it was him personally
[1:41:57] because remember he said I'm going to
[1:41:59] visit you
[1:42:01] he didn't say something's going to
[1:42:02] happen he says I'm going to be there
[1:42:04] it's going to be me that does it it's
[1:42:06] going to me that does the work amen
[1:42:08] they've been slogging along for 24 years
[1:42:10] watching waiting watching waiting
[1:42:13] disappointment trying this trying that
[1:42:15] in and out up and down 24 years not a
[1:42:18] single change in fact things had gotten
[1:42:20] worse
[1:42:21] had him held they'd gotten worse they
[1:42:23] gotten old they got wrinkled and then
[1:42:25] and not a single movement towards the
[1:42:28] fulfilling of the word promise they'd
[1:42:29] had nothing happening
[1:42:31] but there came a day where God dropped
[1:42:33] down
[1:42:35] the word came down
[1:42:37] the one that had said it came down and
[1:42:40] Abraham recognized him I've always
[1:42:42] marveled at that that Abraham recognized
[1:42:44] him he saw three and he called one
[1:42:46] he said Lord and he spoke to one
[1:42:49] he spoke to one he knew which one it was
[1:42:51] this is just me
[1:42:53] but Abraham had met him before
[1:42:55] he knew the way he walked he knew the
[1:42:57] way he talked he knew the things he said
[1:42:59] and when he saw them I believe something
[1:43:00] triggered it and spiritually he
[1:43:02] recognized this is the physical of the
[1:43:04] spiritual that I've been experiencing
[1:43:05] all along
[1:43:07] you walk around the word long enough
[1:43:08] you'll recognize the word when it comes
[1:43:10] your way
[1:43:10] amen
[1:43:12] because we don't get Christ walking
[1:43:13] amongst us in flesh the way that he did
[1:43:15] two thousand years ago but you'll see
[1:43:16] the word walking and Believers you'll
[1:43:18] see the word walking in ministries and
[1:43:20] it's not the fullness but you'll see a
[1:43:21] portion and you recognize it because
[1:43:23] what you've met the person of this word
[1:43:25] and it matches up and you say there's
[1:43:27] the word there's the word there's the
[1:43:30] word and you realize God's moving
[1:43:32] something's happening amen
[1:43:38] the word said Paul said we are
[1:43:41] the Epistles
[1:43:42] seen a red of all men
[1:43:45] people say where is Christ today it's in
[1:43:46] the believer by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:49] they're looking at us
[1:43:50] that's why I'm saying what is our what
[1:43:52] are we building what is our Focus today
[1:43:54] and can people see that it's serious
[1:43:56] enough for us that they ought to be
[1:43:57] serious about it as well
[1:43:59] we've dedicated Our Lives I believe it
[1:44:01] I'm not trying to harangue you this
[1:44:02] morning
[1:44:03] but I'm saying where are we at
[1:44:06] can people look and say they know
[1:44:07] judgment's coming
[1:44:10] but they also know Christ is alive and
[1:44:12] well that he's the same yesterday today
[1:44:14] and forever and there's a remedy there's
[1:44:15] a way to get out
[1:44:17] it says in the time
[1:44:18] Drew nearer and a man came up it wasn't
[1:44:21] a man it was an angel and the angel was
[1:44:23] none other than almighty God manifested
[1:44:25] in a man now listen you Bible readers
[1:44:27] Abraham called his name Lord take that
[1:44:29] Lord and see whether it was Elohim the
[1:44:31] almighty Jehovah dressed in a man's
[1:44:34] clothes and sat down with his back to
[1:44:36] the tent he said I'm personal pronoun
[1:44:39] I'm going to visit you about the time of
[1:44:42] life for Sarah and she's 90 years old
[1:44:45] even in this conversation God is not
[1:44:48] talking to Sarah directly
[1:44:50] she's sitting there eavesdropping like
[1:44:52] any good wife
[1:44:56] she's interested in the things of God
[1:44:59] she's hanging on to every word
[1:45:02] she knows he's special
[1:45:05] but something in her
[1:45:07] had her holding on
[1:45:09] and listening in
[1:45:11] but he's still not talking to her
[1:45:13] tents aren't very soundproof like I said
[1:45:15] earlier she can hear the entire
[1:45:17] conversation I'm sure she made sure to
[1:45:19] move over to the side closest to that
[1:45:21] conversation and started making her food
[1:45:22] right there
[1:45:24] she wanted to know what was up
[1:45:26] 99 she was 90 years old 89 years old
[1:45:29] there's got to be a time maybe this is
[1:45:31] the time I think Faith and Hope brought
[1:45:33] her over to that corner so she could
[1:45:35] hear those things amen
[1:45:36] Abraham was the called out one
[1:45:39] Sarah went along because she was married
[1:45:41] to him
[1:45:42] she's the beneficiary of the Covenant
[1:45:45] it's not to her but because she's a part
[1:45:46] of Abraham she gets to be a part of it
[1:45:48] amen Abraham received the promise Sarah
[1:45:51] fulfilled the promise
[1:45:52] you ever see that
[1:45:54] she fulfills it
[1:45:56] promises through Christ but the
[1:45:57] manifestation is through the bride today
[1:46:00] and it's because we're a part of him
[1:46:02] remember the prophet would say he said
[1:46:03] that she should have been struck dead
[1:46:05] when she doubted
[1:46:07] when she laughed in her heart and he
[1:46:10] called her out he said why did Sarah lie
[1:46:11] she should have been struck dead
[1:46:13] but because she was a part of Abraham
[1:46:15] she had to be saved that's no different
[1:46:18] with the bride sometimes we don't
[1:46:19] believe
[1:46:20] we say our mouth and with our mind we
[1:46:22] believe but our actions say we don't but
[1:46:24] he can't strike us because we're under
[1:46:25] the blood and we're a part of the
[1:46:26] Covenant through Christ and we're part
[1:46:28] of the same Royal seed they both needed
[1:46:30] a body change
[1:46:31] Abraham needed it as well as Sarah did
[1:46:34] but you'll see serenita more than
[1:46:36] Abraham did
[1:46:37] Sarah needed more than Abraham didn't
[1:46:39] we'll get into that a bit but that Faith
[1:46:41] was the vehicle that brought strength
[1:46:42] Faith was a means to the end it was the
[1:46:44] anchor it was the foundation it was the
[1:46:45] resting place but it took a personal
[1:46:47] revealing of God to her for that body
[1:46:50] change to take place that was in her
[1:46:51] amen amen if the musicians would come
[1:46:55] what are we talking about we're talking
[1:46:56] about faith in a word that God reveals
[1:46:59] to you
[1:47:00] not a new word
[1:47:02] but they were starting where no word was
[1:47:04] given and they had to walk so completely
[1:47:06] by faith but we have a more sure word of
[1:47:08] Prophecy we have this all laid out for
[1:47:10] us
[1:47:11] we've got a path we've got a plan we've
[1:47:13] got everything we need laid out for us
[1:47:15] our faith is way different than theirs
[1:47:17] and that we don't have to say is that
[1:47:19] God or is that this or that
[1:47:21] you know is that just a voice am I just
[1:47:23] a schizophrenic or bipolar or any of
[1:47:25] these different things but we know it's
[1:47:26] Christ the word that's speaking to us
[1:47:28] because it matches up with what he's
[1:47:30] told us before
[1:47:31] amen but they never had a fullness
[1:47:34] Abel had the start of righteousness that
[1:47:37] through the sacrifice of a of an
[1:47:39] innocent animal you can be accepted
[1:47:41] but it wasn't a restoration to Eden
[1:47:45] then Enoch comes along
[1:47:47] and he gets go to go in a Rapture but he
[1:47:49] doesn't go through the things that we
[1:47:50] have to go through
[1:47:52] he's not in the last stage
[1:47:54] he's not in a restoration he walks up
[1:47:56] he's a type of the Bride that goes
[1:47:57] through Noah has a revelation that
[1:48:00] there's a way of Escape but it didn't
[1:48:01] take him back to Eden
[1:48:03] Abraham has a revelation that there's
[1:48:05] going to come a serpent bruising man
[1:48:08] and he's the start of it but he never
[1:48:10] gets to finish it remember Hebrews 11
[1:48:12] says these all
[1:48:14] they didn't get the promise
[1:48:16] they got a portion but they didn't
[1:48:17] receive the promise which is what the
[1:48:19] word made flesh in them
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost the New Birth the promise
[1:48:24] of God coming Upon Us amen what was it
[1:48:26] it was God showing I've got a plan and
[1:48:29] I've got a way to do it but it's got to
[1:48:30] roll up into something
[1:48:32] it's got to roll up into a bride it's
[1:48:33] got to roll up into a bride that's ready
[1:48:36] to come back to Eden
[1:48:38] and a bride that walks completely by
[1:48:40] faith in the fully revealed word
[1:48:43] they only had a portion but they walked
[1:48:45] fully in the portion they had
[1:48:47] that's why when you talk to somebody
[1:48:48] from a denomination don't put them down
[1:48:49] they're walking if they're walking fully
[1:48:52] in the Revelation they have praise the
[1:48:53] Lord
[1:48:54] but let them see there's more
[1:48:56] let them see there's more but don't put
[1:48:57] them down they're faithful to what
[1:48:58] they've seen just pray that God opens
[1:49:00] their eyes and keeps them moving along
[1:49:02] that's all we're looking for in those
[1:49:03] things amen but in every one of these
[1:49:05] instances where that Faith come from a
[1:49:07] personal revealing of Christ to that
[1:49:09] person the word coming down and putting
[1:49:12] something in their heart that kept them
[1:49:13] going forward they gave them a direction
[1:49:15] that gave them purpose that gave them
[1:49:17] Focus that gave them energy they gave
[1:49:19] them strength that gave them something
[1:49:20] to hold them
[1:49:22] through 24 years of Dusty dirty tent
[1:49:25] living
[1:49:27] that walk through around in the desert
[1:49:30] for 40 years with Moses
[1:49:32] that walked with God for 500 years
[1:49:35] that held on for four thousand years
[1:49:37] until Christ came
[1:49:39] what was it it was God revealing himself
[1:49:42] and they were standing in faith on the
[1:49:44] portions as he opened it up but now
[1:49:46] we've got the whole thing
[1:49:48] now we've got the whole thing and if
[1:49:49] we've got the whole thing that means the
[1:49:51] plan is ready to be rolled up
[1:49:53] starts with faith but we've got to add
[1:49:55] to that faith we've got to have strength
[1:49:57] we've got to have knowledge we've got to
[1:49:59] have all these other different things
[1:50:01] amen
[1:50:02] let's stand if we would this morning
[1:50:12] I said it last service I'll say it again
[1:50:14] this is not a flat plane that we build
[1:50:16] and we look at that pyramid but it's
[1:50:18] it's a continuous growing
[1:50:21] you have faith to believe you have faith
[1:50:24] to believe in the finished work of
[1:50:25] Calvary that's a starting place but the
[1:50:27] word is greater than that
[1:50:28] because Hebrews 13 8 says he's Jesus
[1:50:30] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:50:32] forever where's the word today
[1:50:33] what's it doing today our faith has to
[1:50:36] grow from just that faith in Calvary
[1:50:37] it's got to move into what Greater Works
[1:50:39] than this show you do it's got to be the
[1:50:41] living manifestation of that bride so
[1:50:43] our faith grows and as it does we add in
[1:50:45] virtue and those different things like I
[1:50:46] said before it's it's like the rings of
[1:50:48] a tree
[1:50:50] so I don't sit here and say I've got it
[1:50:51] all
[1:50:52] I've got faith and then I've got virtue
[1:50:54] and so I've only got a few more things
[1:50:55] to go in there I'm done no no no the
[1:50:57] whole thing is being built up
[1:50:59] the whole thing is growing together the
[1:51:01] whole thing is producing Christ the word
[1:51:04] in my life and in your life
[1:51:06] so don't stop
[1:51:07] don't stop don't say I've got it you
[1:51:09] know I was I was picking blueberries
[1:51:11] yesterday
[1:51:12] and I had on polarized glasses
[1:51:15] and let me say this those glasses were
[1:51:17] not made for blueberry picking
[1:51:19] because what happens is they turn the
[1:51:22] blue nearly the same shade as the Green
[1:51:25] so I'm walking up the road to pick
[1:51:27] blueberries there's a reason for this
[1:51:29] okay
[1:51:30] and a man calls out he says hey I
[1:51:32] thought it was a Believer I thought oh
[1:51:34] Matt's here and Amber you know somebody
[1:51:36] else oh get some fellowship in no no
[1:51:38] it's just a stranger he said come up
[1:51:39] here I'm nearly done he says there's
[1:51:41] tons of blueberries up here but I'm full
[1:51:42] he says I'm ready to go you come up and
[1:51:44] take over I said okay I walked up I
[1:51:46] couldn't see blueberries anywhere
[1:51:48] couldn't see a blueberry
[1:51:50] I like gee thanks you know call me up
[1:51:52] waste my time so it took me like almost
[1:51:54] two hours to pick the first gallon but I
[1:51:56] did find places where I could see there
[1:51:58] were blueberries and so I finally
[1:51:59] started getting picking them anyways I
[1:52:01] picked more or less my first gallon I'm
[1:52:03] walking down to where I picked the last
[1:52:05] time last year
[1:52:07] I'm looking around like where are the
[1:52:08] blueberries
[1:52:09] anyways I was sweating and I was leaning
[1:52:12] over to pick up a blueberry and a drop
[1:52:15] of sweat hit my glasses and so it was
[1:52:16] blurring them so I took off and
[1:52:19] the blueberries appeared
[1:52:22] and I said what have I been missing all
[1:52:25] along
[1:52:26] the blueberries were there
[1:52:28] but the filter I had on would not allow
[1:52:31] me to see all the blueberries that were
[1:52:33] there
[1:52:34] we come in with a filter
[1:52:36] I've got it
[1:52:38] I'm here
[1:52:40] it's a finished work
[1:52:41] I know everything I've got the full
[1:52:43] revelation of the word I've received an
[1:52:46] end time message I'm going in a Rapture
[1:52:48] I'm a member of the bride and we put a
[1:52:50] filter on and it stops our growth it
[1:52:52] stops us from seeing what the word
[1:52:53] really has there
[1:52:54] I I I was shaking my head thinking how
[1:52:58] much did I miss behind me because I had
[1:53:01] those stupid polarized glasses on
[1:53:04] and if I'd have just taken them off
[1:53:07] and use what God had given me I'd have
[1:53:10] seen there were blueberries everywhere
[1:53:12] and the second bucket was better than
[1:53:15] the first bucket and I picked it twice
[1:53:17] as fast because all of a sudden I could
[1:53:19] see blueberries
[1:53:20] see all I was looking for was shape
[1:53:23] but not color
[1:53:24] the color was blending in
[1:53:26] but as soon as I took those glasses off
[1:53:28] blueberries appeared everywhere and you
[1:53:30] know what I started picking normally I'm
[1:53:32] good for a gal and I said there's enough
[1:53:33] blueberries here to get two I didn't
[1:53:35] quite make it but it went so fast and so
[1:53:37] easy I said
[1:53:38] how could I have been so silly
[1:53:42] had the wrong filters on
[1:53:44] I just let God do the work use what he
[1:53:47] gave me not try and add to it not try
[1:53:49] and take away from it not saying stand
[1:53:51] still in some idea or some Dogma or some
[1:53:53] Doctrine or some pride in what I am or
[1:53:55] who I have
[1:53:57] I was literally
[1:53:59] this is even funnier I went through
[1:54:01] areas where I could see footprints and
[1:54:04] they walk past monster Blu-rays I said
[1:54:06] what kind of blueberry picker went past
[1:54:08] these berries
[1:54:10] but you know what there was somebody
[1:54:11] coming behind me no doubt a few hours
[1:54:13] later said what kind of idiot walks past
[1:54:15] all of these blueberries I can see he
[1:54:17] went by them why didn't he pick them and
[1:54:18] then get the beam out of my own eye
[1:54:20] I'm saying sometimes we're looking and
[1:54:22] we think we're so far ahead
[1:54:25] we've got it all we've figured it out no
[1:54:27] no no till we're wraps you're ready
[1:54:28] there's stuff still there for us amen
[1:54:31] and then let's not put a filter on that
[1:54:33] just because of what we have we're there
[1:54:35] we don't have it until we can live it we
[1:54:38] don't have it till we can live it we can
[1:54:39] have a conceptual idea we can have an
[1:54:41] intellectual Revelation but until we're
[1:54:43] living it I say we've got a filter in
[1:54:45] our life
[1:54:47] a holy man's filter is what the word of
[1:54:49] God anointed by the Holy Spirit
[1:54:51] amen I appreciate our older our Elder
[1:54:54] people here listening to this this is
[1:54:55] foundational this is for the young
[1:54:57] people and this is for maybe the middle
[1:54:58] aged as well this is for this is this is
[1:55:01] old hat
[1:55:03] for our elders
[1:55:04] but the jails probably preached it 73
[1:55:06] times in his life
[1:55:07] but they'll sit here and listen
[1:55:08] patiently because they know they're not
[1:55:10] there yet
[1:55:11] not that they don't have faith but
[1:55:13] there's a greater Faith there's a
[1:55:14] Rapture in faith there's a Rapture in
[1:55:16] grace that we're looking for amen so I
[1:55:18] appreciate that you don't sit here with
[1:55:20] a filter and say well this is going to
[1:55:21] be on faith and I'm so far past that I
[1:55:23] don't need it no no there's always more
[1:55:25] blueberries
[1:55:27] if we'll just look through the right
[1:55:28] lens amen
[1:55:29] hey man let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:55:32] Father
[1:55:34] Lord your word is so good
[1:55:37] Lord and there's more in it more than I
[1:55:40] think we ever realize or recognize
[1:55:42] but Lord if we'll keep walking around in
[1:55:44] the land you've given us Lord okay we'll
[1:55:47] keep looking on it if we'll keep
[1:55:48] meditating on it if we'll keep reading
[1:55:49] it if we'll keep hearing it Lord I
[1:55:51] believe we'll see those blueberries Lord
[1:55:53] that you've laid out for us Lord we'll
[1:55:55] see the healing we'll see the
[1:55:56] Deliverance we'll see the Redemption
[1:55:58] Lord we'll see the goodness of God we'll
[1:56:00] see the provision we'll see the grace
[1:56:01] we'll see the love we'll see the healing
[1:56:03] Lord every bit of it that you've given
[1:56:05] to us Lord
[1:56:06] but Lord let us not just rest on what
[1:56:08] you've given Lord but may we press
[1:56:10] towards that Mark Lord may we look for
[1:56:12] the greater things the deeper things the
[1:56:14] higher things Lord God
[1:56:16] Lord let no Pride be found in US Lord
[1:56:19] keep us humble but keep us in
[1:56:21] expectation Lord for your soon coming
[1:56:23] and the soon fulfillment of your whole
[1:56:25] word we pray
[1:56:26] Lord bless us now we ask in Jesus
