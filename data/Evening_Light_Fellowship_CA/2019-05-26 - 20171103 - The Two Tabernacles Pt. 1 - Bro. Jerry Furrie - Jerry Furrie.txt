grace you are the elders grace to the young brothers and sisters Lord we bless them amen those that are here and those that are not able to make it the Saints wherever they are God's grace to them but we thank the Lord for the grace that has brought our brother Jerry with us today to minister to us today tomorrow and Sunday amen and having met him around noon today there's little change in our brother well we're looking for a greater change a man is looking for a greater change the the change that I saw was negative a man but I'm sure that we're all hoping for and believing for a more positive change a man because when I met our brother and minister for our brothers some years ago is there wasn't wasn't white as the as a brother sings on the song sometimes he said just to talk about the old house that he dwells in and he said the hinges are there no more good and and he said there's snow on the rooftop and so on so so our brother got snow on the rooftop but he but the the hour is coming the hours fast approaching we're really we're approaching that new body my God to the glorified body of our Lord Jesus Christ and our brother Jerry is not going to look older he's going to look a lot younger a man and and our sister here is going to be much younger a man praise the Lord see if we don't need to go out into the world and look for the things to make you look young you know whether it's clothing and amoled the world looks for is makeup and and all these things so you can look yeah yeah yeah no no no that passes away but regardless of how old you get you know you're gonna need a lot of painting and makeup to cover the old age but we're going to do a body where you won't need it a man a man a mate we're going to do a glorified body a young body that a never girl knows nothing of old mate know nothing of time or or or what goes on in this temporal world praise God we're going into a glorified body a perfect body and that's what God is doing we know what he did in Luther and Wesleyan and then the Pentecostals but with us he's moving us into a different dimension he's moving us into a higher dimension he's moving us into the fulfillment of a greater promise a man the resurrection and the rapture god help us to believe by the grace of God God Elva so that our faith becomes sight spiritually a man we go from looking to the promise to experiencing the reality of it a man so we're not just believing for a glorified body we will we will be in a glorified body by the grace of Almighty God so God help us is my prayer that he will anoint our brother tonight with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and it's going to bring that word more into a more more reality to the Bride of Christ that's right that it'll be--it'll be as real to us as the promise was to Joshua and Caleb amen to go into the promised land they believe they all believe they're coming out but not all believed in going in same answer by the grace of God I pray God blessing Blair and anoint our brother Jerry fury tonight from Alberta and Ann Elpis brother get us more into that faith that Joshua and Caleb had to go in the Promised Land was more real to them than the others so I pray that the promised land is more real to us than you know all the other churches and all the other denominations and many even so-called professing believers a man that we really believe in the resurrection we really believe in the rapture we really believe in a new and glorified body a man and I pray that by by the hearing of the word that will hear tonight that by the hearing of the word will out of the faith the real faith that makes these things more real than the natural things by the grace of Almighty God so the lord help us brother and i alternative if it becomes a reality in your heart and in your soul you're gonna we're gonna live a different kind of a life I'll guarantee you that we'll think different act different talk different and in the eyes of the world will be foolish in the eyes of the world will will be insane a man and fanatical with God help us he's looking for that he's looking for those people to rise on the earth and I remember again as the prophet said he said God he's waiting on us but there's too many of they're waiting on God took don't wait on God if you wait on God to get judgment but everybody will go on and fulfill what God wants us to do a man we're gonna have the grace of God unto the redemption complete redemption soul body and spirit by the grace of God amen so god help us and let's be in prayer for our brother Jerry as he comes with the word a man and with the faith he's moving into a into a young body a man by the grace of God so and also to be in prayer for the saints that want to make it here tonight but couldn't make it and those since there were some in central that wanted to come out but we're not able to make it so be in prayer for them and they're praying for us and some said that they would try to connect with us online and so god bless them and give them direction and leadership they need a man so the Lord bless you and again being preferences to Betty she's having problems with her back and hips and so on and the pain and of course we just returned from a trip across the island right to Deer Lake and so on so we've had many many stops and stop and go stop and go serving the the emblems of the shed blood and broken body having foot washing and so on so it's been a it's been a very very busy schedule for us no stopping whatsoever so but again that's fine I don't mind ministering that to the body of believers and of course the Saints do that we met all along the way they sent their greetings to the to all of the Saints here by the grace of God and of course those that were here in September they enjoyed the service enjoyed the word and so on so also our brother Gordon snow and his wife send their greetings brother Ron sister Shirley sent their greetings and our brother Hank and sister Verna sends greetings we were going to be met with them all and of course brother Tom and sister Shirley I think a lot of Shirley's out there yeah and so they all said may remember the pass on our greetings to the Saints in st. John's and that we're praying for you and we're praying for them because their brother bill snow left yesterday for Ontario with his daughter Patsy so it's going to be a tremendous change in the Assembly of there he has been the song leader for many many many years many years could be 30 maybe 40 years he's been the song leader out there and and he's exhorted the people and so on so they're going to miss him so we pray God's grace to help the Saints are there in God's grace be with our brother bill in Ontario amen so the Lord bless you all let's stand and this thing only believe is our brother comes for the with the word a man faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man so I pray that you're going to get the faith that you need tonight through the hearing of the word amen God is going to minister to every one of us he's going to answer your questions he's going to dissolve your doubts so that will have the faith that pleases God and let it be don't forget as we've been ministering on faith make sure it's a faith there's motivated by divine love a man that's the faith that pleases God grace so being will pray for will be in prayer for our brother Jerry as he comes to minister the Eternal Word it's not temporal it's eternal our brother will be in contact with eternity the eternal one our Lord Jesus Christ a man he'll just get himself out of the way and Jesus would take over hallelujah let's say only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] praise God you believe God that saves you let me just say it this way you know we all want to believe in Rob for your faith amen thing is that one day that's gonna become more of a reality - it is than we are today stand here coming to church because remember the Bible says that Noah walked with God but he only had salvation faith but but Enoch walked with God for 365 years what was a difference he had rapturing faith this bride has Rafi and faith she she doesn't have salvation faith which is a good thing but she has rapture faith a man well thank you brother Jiro for asking me here I'm good to see all the saints here I've I've heard a lot about you over the years of course I knew your brother Adam knew sister Jamie I knew different ones I just met brother mark here today the first time I heard a lot about him over the years brother Bob of course sister brendham known for a few years and so you all probably heard the story gave me a black eye when he came at her out in Delbert so it was kind of like you know it's well you know I said you go back to the friend oh I just wanted to say that I appreciate brother Gerald having me and I evergreens from Alberta from a little congregation outside of Edmonton near Spruce Grove I just wanted to thank God for what he's doing is working our lives because the thing is friends if we realize what we've been called to I'll tell you what we should be more consecrated I'm talking for myself because the thing is being the bride of Jesus Christ is not a light thing because the we talk about grace but you realize grace is an attribute of time it's something that God has put in time in this day so we can be saved one day we won't need grace but we need grace now we need blood we need the covering of the blood we need forgiveness ends all those different things but friends one day it's going to be done away with but in understanding those things grace will lead you the Holy Ghost Grace will get you save grace will do all sings and Friends of things when God opens these revelations in our heart and we walk in those that's when God keeps on opening up because people misunderstand grace grace is not to make a disgrace grace is supposed to be able to do something for you to walk closer to him amen amen I don't know how long I'm gonna be here tonight I just want to start on a subject and if we're how far we get tonight I'll pick it up tomorrow night and I just want to because I put 70 slides on there I says I said the brother Matthew sorry I remember that brother Adam brother Matthew I said the brother Matt got 70 slides but we're probably warning come close to getting them done but I just wanted to see how far we're gonna get see how you pull see how God comes down and he delivers it I just wanted to be able to be in his will his leadership I don't want to be able to try to do something because sometimes you can over feed people and you can try to stuff it down their throat and they're done eating and we'll see tonight how how much we how far we get but anyways if you have your Bibles handy we'll turn to Revelation chapter 5 amen and just want to be able to get kind of comfortable here you know we got here about one o'clock in the morning it's morning and got a good sleep but you know how it is you when you travel sometimes you just kind of just you just your wits are not all about you and you know I've told my wife you form kind of getting to the place now on I mean we got some younger brothers in congregation that speak and they go out different places and have outreach meetings which a big supporter of it but the thing is is that when you when you get an older and you travel all the time when I was traveling there quite a bit to Africa and stuff like that it was just I was getting tired and I thought well I just stay home and pastor for a while and but the thing is is that I don't know if the Lord see you're looking for leadership of the Lord I don't know if the Lord wants me to do that but we'll find out and maybe we'll go back go back over to Africa and see what's over there as far as what under leadership of God to get me to a place where because you're always getting brother Jill would know that you're always getting people asking to come over and some of this you feel bad in one way but you feel you want to feel under the leadership of the Lord is this Lord is this you doing this amen amen as a familiar scripture to us Revelation chapter 5 verse 8 you realize a book is closed in revelations chapter 5 but it's opening in Revelations 10 we all know that right so understand this sometimes it can be closed to a person because the book only comes open by revelation it's not open because I said it's open its open by revelation to you I can explain all those things to you but it's got to be open to you personally in your life because what it actually is to you is the Almighty God unveiled in your personal life we know we had a prophecy in this day mighty angel way well we have a mighty angel come down speak through the revelations 10-7 angel brother branham we all know that right and on the unveiling of Almighty God but it doesn't stop there it's got to be an unveiling personally to you to many people in the message are just sitting on message pews absorbing information and not taking in revelation now let me just say it this way we're about three generations since the Prophet went off the scene you know what we're becoming in this message like Hutterites Amish where it just becomes a lifestyle and not a new birth that's what friends that's what we should be after is the new birth God being born as a son or daughter of God that's important and the thing is friends were in an adoption age there's a maturing that goes on in the bride chief Cornerstone comes into your heart and he begins to build his characteristics in your life amen let's read from verse eight and when he had taken the book in the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and that's made us unto our God kings and priests we shall reign on this earth let's have a word of Prayer father I pray to your God that you just Lord Jesus now father it's it's you father on display we don't want our flesh to get in the way dear God we have these human bodies and father they are frail and Lord they're there that they're full of many mistakes but dear God father you've used man in this day to preach your word and father I pray now dear God that you just use me speak to your people Lord speak to them father straight to their hearts and father let thy word have preeminence in us granted I pray I ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats amen I just wanted to know it's working amen oh you know God uses ministry to imperfecta our imperfecta ministry to actually perfect the bride you realize friends the thing is God always used been you know you hear people and I just wanted we kind of relaxed myself but you hear people say that you know I'm gonna go right straight back to the tapes and get it off the tapes I don't need to go to church I don't need to hear ministry I don't need to you know because ministry makes so many mistakes but the thing is friends that's the way God's chosen because you know brother Branham told tells us that there's only one provided way we got to be because the God set the pattern in this in this age and our harsh is supposed to be turned back to our AAPIs taluk father's right that's what the ministry came in this day it was a restoration message it was a restoration ministry the King honor a prophet but the thing is that as the bride goes on and begins to become more mature in these things she understands who she is because if I said to you tonight who's the book of redemption now friends who's who's the book of redemption in novel scenario well what you realize God's not coming for message books and message tapes he's coming for a book and it's the book of Jerry it's the book of Mark it's a book of gerald book a bob on and on now what is if I open up the covers of that book what is that book readin it should be reading Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see it should not be a book of so much of saying that because if you read the belt Abraham in the Old Testament and you read about him in the New Testament totally different man you read of all his mistakes but through the blood covenant through the Covenant of coming through the cross you read about Abraham he never failed he was a man of faith all those different things that's the kind of thing that I want to read about me I don't want him sit there and just sit you don't become a message believer is drying up on a message Pew I don't want to be cold for a you know just formal and powerless I want God to come on the scene in my life and I want to see the working of the word in my life that's what I want and the thing is I understand friends the thing is these these human bodies are full of frailties they're full of mistakes all those different things but the same questions been taken care of a long time ago see I've never sinned in the first place I'm justified here tonight I don't take those things for granted but I just believe what the Word says about me I don't believe what I say about myself but I believe what the Word says about me that there will be a bride that's spotless without blemish you know friends will be white as snow all's I believe in all those things I understand friends you look back on your life that you've come over many things you look back because you see the growth of God in your own life because we're coming to maturity here because you come for a mature bride he's not coming for a for a young girl he's coming from a mature bride elect lady that's what we are friends now as we go on in here watch in 1st Peter says he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a house holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable the God by Jesus Christ now 1st Peter 2:9 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood now we're talking about us it's about us okay you got to identify yourself in these things these are not for somebody else this is for the end time bride this is about us now watch a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which are not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy now that's speaking about us we have obtained mercy this isn't for everybody you realize that the the nominations read it are the same Bibles reread out of but the Bible's not written for them it's actually written for the bride see it's only the bride that actually has understanding because the eyes of our understanding God's oxu opened up now on Ephesians 1:18 this is for the eyes are very understanding have been enlightened now these are the characteristics of a bride the eyes of your understanding being enlightened we've been enlightened by the truth of this day that you may know what is the hope of his glory of his calling and what riches of his glory of his inheritance in the Saints now friends the characteristics of the bride Jesus Christ today as she will be enlightened so God has opened his word in this day and Friends the thing is is that if I'm in that word I should be able to see my part in there because we've been called to the reading of the will now friends the thing is we can we can look at in many different ways here we can look at in the sense of why message believer but friends were more than just a message believer see where the bride of Jesus Christ were a people called a royal priesthood and we're stones fit into a house now friends the thing is is that we have a promise in this day and age but remember friends Cain and Abel were in the same church and I'm gonna read you a quote here right away but you know once you understand see not all revelation is great and wonderful revelation Abel got a revelation of who Cain was it was very painful to him it was a painful revelation because you got to reimagine he ready he grew up with cane and he did a lot of things with cane maybe they went to the fishing the stream and threw rocks and on and on and on all of a sudden one day God gives a bowl of ition now we all know about the sacrifice because the thing is a the thing is that Abel could God could identify Abel's sacrifice but he couldn't identify with Cain's sacrifice because that's not what was reflected in heaven but understand this it Abel had a painful revelation who Cain was now Cain was a worshipper brother ban says Cain was a believer Cain had a desire to serve God came let me just get it real world so you can real xxx Cain was a good message believer amen see the thing is this is what people they think of Cain you know like yeah and of course we know Cain wasn't predestinated because the thing is we know God gave him a chance he turned that down he was certain see we know we haven't understand that but the thing is is that the way we look at Cain sometimes is the wrong way of looking at him he comes to church he worships he sings hymns he does all the things like a believer does without revelation because he has no spiritual application without God he tries to apply things but he has no spiritual application there's nothing about him that is spiritual he sees everything carnal now let me go can I get connected just preach here tonight you can dress right you can have all the outfit right all those different things but that doesn't tell me that you're born again that doesn't you can do that under your natural way we look at the Pharisees we look at the Sadducees probably get it into the Sun Sunday but remember friends this Pharisees and Sadducees quoted Moses but sort of Jesus what was the difference between Jesus quoting Pharisees courting they courted the same prophet there our prophet following people amen quoting the Prophet what was the difference the identification of Jesus identifying himself who he was in the scripture talked to him about from Moses the Pharisees were talking about him in an historical point see we could talk about a message in an historical way or we can talk about the message in a present way amen see this is why this bride steps into her place and she speaks about a now God not a history God but a God is now see friends a thing is I can tap my hand on the pulpit here as soon as I stop that was history what I just did but I serve a present God a God that lives right now and the thing is when I leave Church here tonight he's going with me I'm not saying bye to him as I walk out the door and I'll see you tomorrow night he goes with me where I go because he's a present God he's not a history God he's a present God now here brother Branham says this he says now let me just read the rest of this so I can get into it right quick now and the eighth verse he says when he had taken the book the four beasts talking about what we were just reading about in the twenty and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps golden vials for orders and prayers of the saints now this is the time when they everything must be worshipped now remember how appropriate now don't let us miss this now listen close he says when all the mysteries of the church age was finished when all the mysteries of the plans Redemption them seven seals was opened right immediately after this now look it's time for everything in heaven everything unearthed to worship God so that's on believer and believer that's the nomination you know on and on and on and on everybody after the openness seals everybody's called the worship okay so now watch what takes place he says listen I listen at this just a minute he says and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy listen to what the worship this was the Alvers the Beast everything felt right before him see like that when he made his complete plan plan it's a time of worship now listen then redeem souls crying out there everything in heaven is worshiping this lamb so there's people that are actually worshiping that aren't born again and people that have born again are worshiping but what God is looking for is a true worshiper the Pharisees and I want to get too far ahead of myself when I preach them in Lord willing on Sunday morning the Pharisees they had all the dress right they had all the garments right they were clean living people brother Bram tells you couldn't put one finger on their life they weren't fornicators there weren't adulterers there were clean living people and friends the thing is is that they followed the law what they knew of of course they attitude all those different things but they could not identify themselves in the scriptures see friends is an identity crisis going on if you can't identify yourself in the scriptures friends if you can't everybody everybody's identified in the scriptures here tonight you can be a Judas give me any Christ you can be cried somebody's got to fulfill some part of the scripture somewhere I believe friends the thing is I'm popping apart bride here tonight but understand this razor thing is that as we go along down this road there's gonna be more and more things pop up and it's happening all the time I don't know what this mess is going to look like in five years from now because the thing is what people are preaching now I'm portraying now friends they're portraying a God that doesn't exist it's a god of their imagination and the thing is it's not a God of reality because the thing is is that III I believe with all my heart of course the thing is that's a Brundage trace but me it's a part of I serve a God a reality I don't serve a God of my imagination and the bride has that type of faith because she has Rob treating faith so the thing is is that all the mysteries that he was senior of the church Jesus was finished here now when the seven seals broke open what was the seven seals doing for you that's the pride it was actually making a call to you come and worship the true lamb right common trusted to come and worship the true lamb that's what friends the bride is doing she's at she could worshiping the true lamb knowing John 4:23 now I'm gonna go through so I'm just laying a foundation here but the hour cometh now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth so he says the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth the hour cometh and for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so there will be a true worshiper and also a false worshiper amen so the thing is is that there's two systems of worship there's one system that is true one citizen that is false and they're side-by-side all the way from the book of Genesis from Cain and Abel all the way down this end time there will be two ones one will be acceptable to God and one will be not be something a god one will do go through the rituals forms and all those things the other one will go through and worship and in truth in spirit in fact a pillar of fire o be with them and there will be ones that worship in that will the pillar fire won't be with them that's why friends the thing is true worship comes from a person that is actually born-again by word word birth you understand this just for a second here the mail is here tonight Jesus Christ he speaks for through the ministry and the thing is that what he's doing he's actually you are receiving a love from him from the word the word is actually what actually German ties is the soul and the thing is that he uses ministry to actually preach his word we had a problem this day who actually preached and friends the thing is that well at the time he was living there's a lot of people that didn't understand what he was doing but there was a ministry coming out after and I picked up what that prophet was saying and actually got a revelation of it and what it was it was through the preaching of the word the mail the word the mail actually preaching into the bride now if I were to ask you just just so you can just so you understand where I'm coming from now if we're the bride of Jesus Christ and the Mail's here what is actually taking place it becomes new birth by spoke than worked okay what I want to say to you really is reality is this is a book of redemption is in the hands of us right so on that book these Redemption let me put it this way Adam and Eve had the book they felt the book went back up the owner revelations 5 the book came back down correct so the book came back and where is it it's in our hands right and every name on that book has to be redeemed they cannot be made perfect without us so in other words are waiting for us to mature to perfection so they can actually be come out of the graves the Saints for the last two thousand years the maturity of the bride is going on right now so the male's here Jesus Christ right and what he's doing he's feeding the bride the work and what is happening is that there's a birth coming more forth more and more because she's getting more of more of rapture in faith as it builds into her and it's actually she's coming cuz we had a perfect word there's word coming that's actually perfecting us it's come already but it's coming and it's actually gonna bring those ones out of the grave The Voice is the resurrection right it's gonna come through this bright I just want the friends we got to know who we are I want out of here I'm not waiting for anybody else I'm in your it amen I'm not what there's no other message for coming we had our messenger but I know I'm the guy you're the guy I met see friends the thing is we look for everybody else to do something but listen we are what it is as friends the thing is finding your place in the body and God working through that part to actually bring forth his word but what it's hopping for his people are sitting there waiting well it's gonna happen let me just say this Rob stirring faith is in you now you are the rapture you are Jesus Christ the second coming of Jesus Christ right now that's what you are you're actually then people three top well the thing is is that who else who else the second coming of Jesus Christ he's come right he's comin see and we're sitting here tonight we're wondering well is he come or not come I'm not saying you're wondering that way but I'm just saying your position is this that I'm the second coming of Jesus Christ and friends the thing is you're the door to salvation you're everything just like Esther take your position take your place what are you gonna do you're gonna turn around death remember that you remember the types because the thunders are in the types you remember ray up you remember Ruth you remember after all those every once those are our types that we look at what they become we're supposed to be God put a lot of people through a lot of things so we can actually look back and say what we're supposed to be amen that's what we are now watch this so the thing is is that we're supposed to worship in spirit and truth he says in matthew 15:8 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honors me with their lips but their heart is far me so they come to church they talk a good talk port a good quote that's all they're doing but watch what happen but in vain do they worship me so they're worshiping God but in vain they're worshiping them the people that are in vain worship Him are the ones that are not born again he says teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so there's two forms of worship one word from the lips mouth and one actually worship from their heart so you have all the religious demonstrations coming out but if you're not new birth here and don't do any good God doesn't accept your worship because the thing is is that he only worked he only takes the form of the ones that are truly born again by thy word by the word of this day the reveal were today now friends has been going to this and I just want you to just kind of show you a tape here because the thing is is that when we we want to look at this in a way that what's actually taking place in our name and you can follow through the scripture pretty good here the weight weight weight fails it but how that understanding here is that we're in a son of man ministry that's what we're under I just want to I want I'm trying to get a feel here where we're out here because in and I believe your talk well I'm not saying not what I'm trying to say to you sis it's under the son of man ministry there's a rapture that's what we're under right now is the son of man ministry after the order of melchizedek right does everybody understand what my cousin and I'm I'll just throw this out to you when Jesus came he was a son of man right he brings the Melchizedek order in what it was was everything that the everything that the the Levitical order was doing up to that time see God accepted but when Jesus the Melchizedek aim on the scene God refused that after now in this day in age a prophet comes right son of man ministry with a mouth category all the denominational ideas all the thinking all their opinions went out the window that's why friends a thing God does not wink and ignorance no more because the thing is the word has come back and its fullness amen so the word has come back and its fullness down and we're under the order of Melchizedek it's not a man ministry and the thing is in this is before the millennium and and the son of God came up but the son of man came down in that in that and that the timeframe were in right now to give us what to give us robbed Street faith to get us out of here everybody with me so far Amen know where we're gonna pick this up is look at the parallel here because there was actually a dispute in the first church in Acts chapter 15 and the thing is is that when we when we were looking at this I'll show you the type because the tabernacle of David because people don't think what was the time after they have David over built the tabernacle he did build the tabernacle and here's what James rises up then he says after they had held their peace James answers saying men and brethren hearken unto me Simeon hath declared out God the first invisi Gentiles to take out them a people for his name so what it is there's an argument in the first church so you remember there's Jews and there's Gentiles some of the Pharisee Jews came into the message in the first church and they're arguing to stay with the law of Moses you can't get saved without the law Moses first 15 and to this agree the words of the prophets as is written after this our return and I will build again the tabernacle of David which is falling down and I'll build again the ruins thereof and I'll set it up so in other words when they're disputing they're just meeting over long grace James stands up and says is going to be a restoration of the tabernacle of David and as we go down this I'll show you this is talking about us this day this scripture is fulfilled in the bride see because the thing is they were these believed and Pharisees came along and they're trying to get the Gentiles to obey the law of Moses that are in the message and they're trying to get them this get circumcised they're trying to say you can't get saved without this and the thing is is that here James testifies concerning the Gentiles coming to Christ and actually he's speaking of Amos 9 verses 11 and 12 and he's counting the company he's talking to them about the restoration of the tabernacle of David so the thing is is that the Gentiles are listening this Jews are in the church see it's a big mix-up because remember in Jerusalem see the Jews when they were coming in the church at the time and but they weren't saved and they're trying to bring the Gentiles to do than what they're doing under the customs of the Jews before the law of Moses so it says after this I'll return build up again the topography which is falling down I'll build again the rules thereof and I'll set it up so the Pharisees are trying to get the Gentiles to be under the law of Moses so what they're trying to do is actually trying to get them under the Levitical order of worship that's what they're trying to do now you say well that does have nothing to do with us and we'll show you here so James disputes and the thing is he's saying worship doesn't come by the Levitical order worship only comes by the Melchizedek order true worship only comes by that because in people's minds they said think David never had a taco but realize there was two Tabernacles in the time of David amen now watch this see because the thing is the tabernacle Moses was there erect at the same time the tabernacle of David and the tabernacle of Moses the one that had built in the wilderness the one that they had built in before they went in the promise and all those the problems and all those things this is a tabernacle that was built by Moses and put on the mount Gibeon and the thing is it was there they had their they had their priesthood they had the sacrifices that all the rituals and all those everything's they went through all the things but there was a town and I closed David that was being built or built in Jerusalem and the thing is how we look at this I want just concentrate on the unmount giving here for a moment where the where they had that Moses of are they the Tabernacle in the wilderness after Moses and just show you that there was there was a there was a there was a tabernacle there but there was one thing big that was missing in the tabernacle Moses and the one thing that was missing in the town of Moses was the Ark of the Covenant they had all the riches he had the priesthood there the high priests they had that they had that brazen altar they had the menorah that all those are all the things but they were coming to worship under ritualistic form but they had no Ark of the Covenant big thing right no washes for the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made the Willetts the altar of the burnt offering were out at that season in the high place I give him so the tabernacle of Moses represented the Levitical order or the vertical priesthood that was actually obeying what they thought was the law of Moses and the thing is is that friends they had the outer court they had the hosts the Holies they had everything there like I said they're the showbread they're the menorah and all those they had everything there but they had no Ark of the Covenant so when they would bring a lamb to the do this this Tabernacle they would go through all the rituals but no Ark of the Covenant which is the most important thing that was the word because what was in the arc of the Covenant the law of Moses the rod of Aaron the manna and the thing is the rod but it bought it it brought forth fruit all those ever things it was alive so friends the thing is is that here they are they're worshiping without the Ark of the Covenant but God is not there so in their imaginations that are going to the altar or they're going to church so to speak or the tabernacle in their imaginations they're thinking that they are forgiven but there's no mercy seats because the Ark of the Covenant had the mercy where they sprinkle the blood on the mercy seat everybody with me so there was no mercy seat so they couldn't bring any blood but they watched the high priest go in behind the veil with the blood from the lamb that they'd come in and the lamb was slain they put in the charger and they'd swatch the high priest going behind the veil what was he sprinkling the blood on there was no Ark of the Covenant there was no mercy seats so there's no mercy seat there's no forgiveness but but that person would walk away from there in his imagination thinking that he's forgiven but the thing is he wasn't forgiving because there's no longer the Covenant there amen no washes Zadok well maybe I skipped over or maybe I didn't even get it on here I must have skipped it anyways in first chronicles 1639 says it's eight off the priest and his brethren the priests before the table of the Lord in the high place that was in Guinean so they sail off the priest so they had all the riches that all those different things but they had no Ark of the Covenant now understand this they have an order of worship just like many people come to church there's an order of worship but the thing is is there's no Ark of the Covenant in your heart there's no forgiveness for you that's the only way to be forgiven if you're born again brother Graham tells us you're not your name's not even recognized in heaven without the new birth I'm just saying what he said you take it up with him that's what he said that's why friends the thing is many people go through forms and rituals they believe the message they quote the message talk about the message but there's nothing there to reflect in heaven that they are actually a part of heaven because there's got to be you're flexing in your heart that you're a part of there's got to be something when he looks down he's got to see something in your heart to reflect it yeah I'm after the heaven I'm born of heaven I'm birthed from heaven I'm a daughter of God now washes in confers conical 15:1 and David made him houses in the City of David I prepared the place for the Ark of God and pitched it for it a tent so here David of course king of the king of Israel he gets on his heart he wants to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem he doesn't have given on his mind he doesn't have knob on his mind he doesn't have Shiloh on his mind but he has Jerusalem Jerusalem is a type of Zion or the same word of Zion where it is IANA type of the bride so in this heart now remember the start of it because James stood up and disputed that God's gonna restore the tabernacle of David so this is all type through so David gets in his mind doesn't even know why he's doing her probably gets in his mind I'm gonna bring the Ark of the Covenant dock to Jerusalem because the thing is is that he he's thinking that's where we want to worship God now watch this second samuel chapter 5 verse 7 nevertheless David took the stronghold was on and the same is the City of David so he builds a tent in the City of David and he puts the Ark of the Covenant there now what the difference was from the tabernacle that was in the City of David to the tabernacle that was built on Mount Gibeon was this the tabernacle of David only had one room there was no outer court there was no inner Court and there's no holy soli it only had one piece of furniture in that tower knuckled amen and every priest could go in that tent now remember I read you Revelation chapter 5 he's made us kings and priests [Applause] see the worshiper that went to the Tabernacle in the wilderness they had to starve us they couldn't go in behind the veil they had to stay away from there they had a worship God from afar off amen by the town and I called David you didn't have to do that now you've been made kings and priests in a tabernacle of David they could go in there and they can go behind before the Ark of the Covenant the blood was on the Mercy because the Ark of covenants there and they could worship God there they didn't have to go through the outer court they'd have to go through the inner court they'd go right into the holy Solly's now remember this time Michael is typing us we come to church we worship God we sing we have song books we have a preacher we have all these things as I show you this understand this trance what but James is actually speaking about is the endtime Church is the endtime bride no watch this first chronicles 16 1 so they brought the Ark of God set in the midst of the tent of David had pitched it and had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices peace offerings before God so only one piece of furniture in this in this in this town Michael David was the Ark of the Covenant now you still have have have her to have the tabernacle of the wilderness I'm now giving on so they have three different courts in that tabernacle but in this one was only one and a sister and when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the Peace offers he blessed the people in the name of Lord and he dug and he'd out to every one of Israel both man and woman to every one loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine no friends in the tabernacle of waters there's no way this could happen he's actually having observing communion to the women to the men everyone because remember we're called to true worship in this day they did so here was David he was a prophet he was a king and he was a priest he never had that anywhere else here was David raisin up in me what it is it's typing us that we are kings and priests see friends a thing is understand we're a prophetic people following a prophets message now let me just get so I don't want to go too far ahead but I understand where the light is today now we had a light bulb here called William Marion Brown 250 watt 300 watt whatever but that light bulb had to be changed out to a bride's lake ball and had to be changed out so it was the changing of the light bulb the bride is the light now Reid look at this John the Baptist's from Jesus to the Upper Room was about five years three dispensations changed him from John the Baptist light bulb to Jesus light Bob to the Upper Room played ball if he did were in tune with what the Holy Spirit was actually doing you'd miss it because people say what is the light of this day and they hand out a message book no brother Brown says the light of the hour is when the word is manifested in flesh that will be the light of the day it can't be just on book for friends it can't be on tape it's got to be in you understand this friends we have to understand we have to have an identity if we have no identity friends where's our daddy didn't stop the denomination's or we're just a limbo or we're just a denomination so he doubt every one of his you're both man and woman to everyone a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine and the appointed certain of the Levites the minister before the Ark of the Covenant and to record and thank and praise the Lord God of Israel in search wine serving communion to the women to the men singing praising worshiping where did you see an endtime message search but over on the other side say like the priest says priests breath his brethren in the priests before the tavern our Lord in the high place that wasn't giving so they still had their company and priests doing all the riches newer Haller forms and no arkla covered davis down in Jerusalem profit King priests serving communion because you never had that was not supposed to be in the Old Testament you remember what happened to use I what are you went in trying to be a priest he got leprosy but this is a tight for us to understand what so salmon in the end time see we're kings and priests the book was closed the book is open we preached from an open book now we don't preach from a closed book we preached from an open book where we can actually begin to identify who we are by revelation see friends that's what I'm saying you are the book of redemption see Friends of thing is all the names that the Adam was supposed to speak for first friends the thing is is now he's now the male Christ himself is speaking it through the bride in this day everybody that's on that books gotta be redeemed this is why this is such an important age and adoption age where we become matured we have the very attributes of the Living God we have a very care of Jessica because why there's a lot of things depending on us we got a lot of responsibility here that's why we're not just sitting around on the message pew info I'm noting yeah you're something if you're the bride you something we got a responsibility what's a responsibility yield yourself so the male can come in you and Nasus and south through your body hey now so watch this now in this tabernacle on Davis Tabernacle but I'm pretty dry up here but I don't know why I'm maybe it's the weather I don't know but it's moisture in the air here isn't there anyway so understand this and Davis Tabernacle one thing they had the time knock on the Willers didn't have worshiping praising you know how important worship is to the believer you understand that is the right approach to God at bore ship as part of it understand this is Tabernacle had worshiping and rejoicing going on 24 hours seven days a week you understand when David set it up because friends they didn't have three things to go through to get into horse one-room tabernacle the Ark of the Covenant it no washes that's so the number of them that were brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord even all over cunning was 204 score and eight so 288 priests twelve priests every hour would move off and worship before the Ark of the Covenant 12 hours worship 12 hours 24 hours seven days a week they just didn't wait for Sunday then just wait for Wednesday because if you're waiting for Sunday and Wednesday you're identified with with with the tabernacle the Wilmers because they symbolize the church ages we don't symbolize the church ages even though the lay on see in church ages here all around us but we're in the bride age see the Miocene churches tries to influence is to become cold formal dead but the bride age makes us alive makes us rejoice we are our life was a worship we get up in the morning we worship we go to bed at night were worse we're sleep on works that's a 24-hour seven-day-a-week worship so the number then that were brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord even Oliver kind was 204 score and 812 is a number of worship so every hour 12 men would be proven for the Ark of the Covenant they would move up so it was one hour shifts 212 24/7 on and on it would just continue perpetual it was worse it worship worship type in us friends desist because we go to bed at night friends the thing is we're not worship this because we're not in church this time because we're not where we worship when we go outside we worship when we go shopping we worship when we long vacations we worship all the time it's a 24 hour 7 worship because why is it friends the thing is it's God living in you know watch and these are the singers of the chief of the fathers of the Levites who remained the Chamber's were free they were employed that work day and night employed a night they were stiff they praise God friends a thing is that the who's going to who's going to carry the work of the Lord of this day it's gonna be the bride there's gonna be helps in the church is gonna be diversity again this is me all these type of things and friends the thing is is that weeds a continual worship but understand this is that friends it's not a ritualistic form some people go to church because it's realistic to think it matters it matters it matters that you come to your place your position in this day it matters it matters friends that you worship in spirit of truth because the thing is what does the Bible say bonus we're living sacrifices we're not dead we're living that's the thing in the Indians Tabernacle they went in there and they worship continuing 24/7 now watch this David comes the Psalms and he says this let me prayer let me let my prayer be set forth before thee as since and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice we're in the evening time are we not both about the clothes on but to go home oh right the bodies I'm watching for a bar change I said I heard some of the things brother Joe said about me I'm ready believe me I'm ready I don't like this body this body gets to be down this body gets to be tired this body does all kinds of things but let me say this to your friends I I'm not gonna stay this as temporal that I'm staying in I'm gonna be out here I have an eternal life what is I'm birth here you realize if you die here tonight you die you remember your brother Brad for her birthday and biology that you have a body to go to he goes to this yosity see friends your eggs I mean you see often he body but your Co from bodies already existed right brother branham towels will cease there's certain things brother Brown tells us he's even represented before the throne before it because it's the word body he said that word body was the Satan was made at the same time Jesus body was the theophany was made so that you got to see often he said they're telling you hurry up get the revelation see what it is that what's happening friends the thing is that God is trying to get us out of here but we're saying slow down God but realize this God will open up that scripture to you one day and it says it's time to come home see we're bombed by scripture because when God opens up the scripture your old boo-boo-boo the other here now watch this first Corinthians chapter 16 I'm just laying the foundation here for he point certain the Levites diminish before the Ark of the Lord and to record and thank and praise the Lord God of Israel and verses 5 and 6 of the same chapter you have musicians here he got a soldier see the musicians he got the preacher you got the congregation you got the lady taking notes on and on and on what is it it's typing us it's showing us in the scripture that's what was James was saying when he stood up and we just feed it with with the Pharisees of the Jews that were in the mess of my day disputing with them we don't have to go that that's not where they're called for the Gentiles are called here to worship and in truth in spirit friends what gives us that Liberty is the opening of the seventh seal the seal of your life has been broken open and what's happening the Spirit of God is all over you as you allowed to come into you and friends it's a worship you had a seal in your life but that seals been broken God is German he got in there friends I'm not going to some dead man's - I'm going to a tomb that's alive there's no body there anyway it's been broken that seal that seals and broken on you remember brother BAM tells us that the bride of Jesus Christ it's the ending of the ministry of Jesus Christ he also says if it's a Ministry of Jesus it's just a continuation of him from 2,000 years ago that's what he says about us I believe him amen no watch amen second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 so song and all a congregation with him went to the high place that was in Gibeon for there was a town round Congress of God which Moses the servant of Lord had made in the wilderness but the ark of the God had David brought up from Kathryn Jairam to the place which David had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem so that's the tabernacle now let's just think about this what is it what did I say Corinthians chronicles sorry I'm not a professor on a theologian a my wife oh crap I make a lot of mistakes my wife says yeah you sure do so forgive me only the only only defense I have his brother branded too maybe brother Josh doesn't but I do but understand this the representation of this is that Davis Tabernacle which had the Ark of the Covenant the church ages are identified in the tabernacle of the wilderness and the thing is is that Solomon's Temple is identified over the millennia but in between there was the tabernacle of David to be restored as I read to you so understand that the thing is is that I'm not identified in the church ages I'm identified in David's Tabernacle that's where we got to be identified this is where we got to have an understanding of what called us why we're called to the new order of worship remember David is the one that made the new order he was prophet King and priests he called the new order now a lot of times we think it was brother brand that called this new order it wasn't brother brand it was Christ coming down in the fullness of the work and veiled himself in a prophet if I could say it this way so you can understand here was Jesus the body on the throne the spirit got up off that throne and came down and unveiled himself in a profit and that profit began to speak okay and what was that that was the order of Melchizedek and begin to speak and what was he doing he was setting up a new order of worship a new or praise I knew or and that was what David was doing David was setting up a newer it was it was an order that they know Israel never he knew nothing about before because they were used to the tabernacle in the world but here David sets up a new order so watch this again but for its second chronicles chapter 4 chapter 1 verse 4 but the ark of the God had David to carry our rim to the place with Shiva David had prepared for it and he had pitched a tent fort in Jerusalem so he brings he brings he builds a tabernacle in Jerusalem one room house okay one room tent and puts the Ark of the Covenant and everybody could go in there and worship all the priests okay so God actually desire to be in Zion he actually desired to be in Jerusalem everybody with me now in Psalms 132 verse 13 for the Lord have chosen Zion he had desire for his habitation this is my rest forever here I will dwell for I have desired so its desire which means wish for long for this is God's desire okay now brother Brown says this in future home it shall come to pass that he is left in Sion and he that's a remnant in Jerusalem shall be called holy even everyone there's written among the living and drew some seat wherein the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters on then he says remember that's always the bright Zion is always the bride now let's read that scripture again for the Lord had chosen the bride he had desired her for his habitation she is my rest forever here will I dwell in her for I have desired her now you're sitting here today friends you're the bride he desires to dwell in you I don't know how much more clear I can get this to you he desires to be in you see friends the thing is when he's you know the pillar of fires here a pillar of fire never went when brother Baron went pillar of fire still here here four are still leading us a pillar of fire is something that indwells us the pillar of fire is something that is actually personified in the believer now watch now friends we were just talking about the old Jerusalem this is New Jerusalem I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first seven the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men the real translation is the title now God is in them and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God that's you when I read this that's talking about me I'm identifying that remember Jesus brother BAM tell us how did he get his faith by identifying himself reading about himself remember he went to the grave on that scripture that I'll not leave my holy one being the grave in the in the grave for more than three days he went in the grave that because what does he believe that about himself we need to believe not I'm not talking intellectual here but understand friends who is this message for there's a call that whenever I earn the Seventh Seal it's called you and I that's my friends the thing is so many people you know let's take the five wives of the fives 5-volt foolish here the difference between them was the Holy Ghost we all know the story but you realize when Jesus talked that parable that those Jews that were standing there they knew exactly what he's talking about to us it was formed because it was an Eastern custom but you realized when those 10 virgins came out they all came at the call right midnight hour midnight hour call was was the message they all came out and you see people to gets excited by this message how do you praise God you mean um a few years down in there lukewarm called formal what happened what has happened because the five their five foolish the five what the five wise did because in those days what they would do the wise virgins they'd have a canister of oil here and it would keep their wits lit lit and keep it burning really good all the time the five foolish went out but they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had some burning there but it burns out and that's what's happening a lot of people in the message they're burning out because what is it they went out they and in the only difference between a Holy Ghost still a person and not another Holy Ghost fell person as far as the verses go is that they have no Holy Ghost that's the thing that that's the missing part but they might dress the part they might look the part they might do because friends it's not five and five five wise so camping denominational systems because God our God already looks at them that they're did not necessity domination so it's not vanity domination it's way in the message now friends the thing is that we if we look at some of these things these parables are stuff and bring it up to our place that's why you see the things that are happening in this message people are getting cold again formal they're getting powers then because in it and they might have been on fire and God for God for a couple years ago or last take they might have in front but now they're just dying off what is it no Holy Ghost see let me just put it this way there's a bride's revival there's church revival there's can't revive us the only revival the whole is the bride's revival because the bride's revival is return on not against Kent revivals I'm not against Church rather than against any of the friends it's great things the this person can come out of that but let me just assure you you watch it y'all young people that go to camps and they get on fire for God I'm not against camps don't don't pull me on this but they get on fire for God they come back in the local assembly and they're on fire for about one two weeks maybe three weeks maybe month to month and they just burn right out and what is it they got they had a camp revival I'm not not against uh but if they didn't have a broader survivor because the bride's revival will never burn out a bride's revival keep going on she'll stay steady she'll walk steady I've said he'll talk steady it just stays with them Francis ting is that we have to have an understanding is that this broad is destined to a body change no watch st. John 14 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knows enough but II know him for II 12 in you and shall be in you was he did a fine God's Tabernacle in Zion you Partizan tonight I am you part of New Jerusalem I am that's me it's talking about me identify with this friends but brother Giri don't you ever get tired I've already gets tired absolutely has nothing to do with the promise I might get sick and my body has nothing to do with the promise I'm still promised this this is for me friends if you don't want to take it go ahead and you don't take it but I'm taking it's for me it's what's spoken about me see friends the thing is is either were spoken brighter or not spoken bride but there's been a word spoken in this last days she will be like him there's been a word spoken about her see that she has the mind of Christ it's a spoken in this day that she will have thus saith the Lord or she'll keep quiet that's his spoken by us now friends we could put that off to someone I'm not saying you go around and you get up in the morning you have an orange juice oh they gave you or any think that I'm not talking about that you know that's beyond me I don't understand that but I do understand this that I'm overcome her by the grace of Almighty God I look at what my promises are I claim those promises because they're for me see this what friends of thing is is that when we're looking at some of these things here tonight I'm trying to get it conveyed to you that's a believer in this day's been called the true worship no other people have been called the true worship they might clap their hands they might sing that's not the worship I'm talking about but it's a worshiped from a new birth or a born-again art there's a worship coming from them they get up in the morning and God's just in awe that's my child oh that's my daughter they go to church and they're just thank you lord thank you God you look at other people I don't want to go to church I hate Church Oh friends maybe I'm staying I'm from a standpoint of being a preacher but I love the one to church I don't know I preach about this all the time is it back home is that friends the thing is that there's so many people they don't think that's that it's necessary to go to church it's almost a necessary evil to them and the only reason why they go to church is because brother band makes statements if you got the whole egos you can't wait til the doors are open and that I mean these are these are absolute boats that's the only reason to go to church but it's not in their heart to go to church there's nothing drawing than the church as the Friends of thing is that if we are not drawn to his word then what are we doing the bride is drawn to the word I'm drawn because the thing is is that the word drew me it looked for me I'm not doing this under my power I'm doing this under his power at the end of the day at the end of the day you'll pat me on the back say good job but it's all him that did it uh-huh so here we have the to not to have an answer to set up side-by-side and our friends the thing is we had one of those army of them one no give him and then I'm now giving yeah I'm Mel Gibeon they have all the rich shows all the forms everything they're doing all the things that the law of moses that but mount now in zion they're having a real grand old revival they're worshiping they're praising god all those different things and friends the thing is that here we had David come in and he makes another priesthood he makes a priesthood built after the tabernacle of David now listen to me here for a second here see the Ark of the Covenant should be really important to us I'm talking about the word I'm talking about the word I'm not talking about the physical time word it's because the thing is that this is this is why it's so important to understand this the Ark of the cotan had the word in it but also had the rod in it what did the rod represent it represented Aaron's rod the priesthood that actually bought it it actually actually had life in it it restored it was a restoration you realized the true fivefold ministry in this day she should be button she should be getting bringing forth fruit I'm talking about in the people because what is it it's the preaching of the word and people are around the word amen we cannot bypass God's word amen friends I was just preaching here on the new cart where David come brain builds a new cart and tries to bring back to roo some of the Ark of the Covenant and the thing is brethren says a very specific quite a few times they tried to bypass his word you realize I don't know if you had the trouble around here but we got the trouble in Edmonton people are saying that the ministry has failed you realize what brother brems said about that he says when the people begin to say that the ministries felt it's the gainsaying of korah they're actually fulfilling the gainsaying of korah now let me just say it this way Korah and dates that were not after Moses you won't read that in the Bible they Moses office was already established that's not what they are after they're after Aaron's position they're after the ministry what's happening around the message in this day as people are saying the ministry is failed and brother ben says when they begin to say that it's the gainsaying of korah check it up as a church age book to page 291 I understand friends they they'll start beginning to say these things so that friends we're to do is it justifies themselves and what they do they begin to bring bring the quotes together themselves and they begin to build a golden calf before the people ball does DD right so they take quotes and build a golden calf words that going calf going to lead them right back to Egypt is happening more and more and more but the bride led under the ministry or the administration of this prophet brought in this day remember Joshua took him over in the Promised Land and remember Joshua gave the inherence to the priesthood the priests went to the people and divvied up the inheritance that was the protocol but people don't want to go off to the patterns by the pattern of God anymore they want to do their own thing we're not called to do her own thing we're only called to live the word follow the word the word will lead us amen no washes sorry I hope I'm not born you're too long here but just just I'm kind of scattered a little bit but I'm just trying to get my thought down here and we'll pick it up tomorrow night again here now actually chapter 45 verse 21 alright gonna come thou shall put the mercy seat above above upon the earth and the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I'll meet thee I'll commune with thee from above the mercy in between the two chairman's which are upon the Ark of the testimony that was the only place that God said they would meet him right who had the Ark of the Covenant David had the Ark of the Covenant but they still had they saw the ritualistic form on Mount Gibeon not this time but you know what I've been reading you so I understand this is and we can follow this rate to description we're going to then the New Testament here right away and I'll probably leave it there but I understand this is that the Ark of the Covenant what was in the Ark of the Covenant was the word the the rod of Aaron the but it brought forth fruit and the manna that never aged we're in that mist right now we every believer with the Holy Ghost feel believe every every every bride member or everybody that works it has to be working God is birth under this so you don't need to go to a priest to get forgiveness of sins you go to the high priest yourself now let's just bring this up into the New Testament here and we'll shut her down here tonight and I'll bring out Lord willing tomorrow night the Melchizedek quarter but watch Matthew 27 verse 51 and behold the veil the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent now norse is the setting here of course we know this is Jesus being crucified on Mount Calvary and the crucifixion took place at the time of the Passover we all know that right so mark 14 verse 12 and the first day of the unleavened bread when they killed the Passover the disciples said on DIMM where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayst eat the passover so remember I went from the Old Testament were going the New Testament - Tabernacles setup side-by-side again no washes now I'd been a very weary nervous day and it was an unusual day we find Jesus here coming up to Jerusalem ready to attend the Passover and the Passover is where the Paschal Lamb was killed and the blood was spread upon the mercy seat for the atonement for the people so notice the vay the temple veil was rent right from top to bottom the mercy seat was not inside that temple behind the veil no Ark of the Covenant it was taken in the time of Babel omen or Babylon 5 and 86 when Nebuchadnezzar went into Jerusalem and destroyed Jerusalem so all these years they were worshipping under false worship at the time of the Passover there would be about 2 million male Jews would go to Jerusalem with their lamb for sacrifice so the priests would get their lamb slit open the lamb drain the blood another charger the priest would go into behind the veil but there's no blood all right no Ark of the Covenant so there's no blood to be be put on the mercy seat and what was God doing ripping over the veil of that what they would call whole is the hoist to show there's no mercy seat behind them but the true mercy seat was hanging on the cross so there's two Tabernacles once again one in Jesus where the true worshipper would go and the one behind the veil that there was no Ark of the Covenant there so understand this friends well God was trying to show us that there was no pillar far behind that veil once again false false worship now let me just bring it down here real quick he says the veil was rent that God might be manifest the unveil God plainview they should have seen him standing there yet he was too common it was an ordinary man ordinary man they couldn't see it see they there stood a man well they said this guy that school did he come from but remember when that spear struck his body that spirit left him the temple the sacrifice blocks turned over and lightning whipped down through the temple and rent the veil what was it there was their God hanging on Calvary and they were too blind to see it so those blind Israelites standing there their whole religion was based on God given the law they based it on worshipping God all those things no Ark of the Covenant so the man would go up there in his imagination he walked away thinking that his sins were covered but no rocker becoming behind the veil but the one that was on the cross that was the tabernacle that was the true where the true worshiper should be amen so two Tabernacles two high priests high priests cathetus and high priest Jesus amen ever how you want to type in out watch this brought him an open view still they don't see it they are blind that God failed a human being how God could have mercy on foul sinners is us when he hid himself as a mystery and now it's in plain view or full view reveal buzzwords is always the word coffee that is gone it's the word that opens it up if those people would have known the Word of God that day when Jesus died they would have seen the mercy seat he was the mercy seat I was in that mercy seat you were in that mercy seat but friends the thing is the brother branham was identified where that mercy seat was everybody with me I'm going to be closing here don't worry I won't be all night here maybe another two hours all right who was what did the veil rent remember was death to go into it no more he could see it Moses saw it in the form it was a world it was a man's mouth well here it is I bleed him back the same in what was God wanted to show them mercy see ya what God wanted to show them the mercy God wanted them to show them who he was so the veil of the mers merged in the temple from the hand of God above was rent from the top to the bomb show God in plain view it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross the mercy seats so they're still going through their sacrifices they're doing all the rituals they're doing hauler form and they're working they're praising God we know that they were seeing Psalms 22 and here the mercy seat was on the cross hang in there so here we have to try out Michaels again one of ritualistic and one of true worship now my question is which one you worshiping huh which one you worshiping here tonight because he understand this Jesus being the true temple the word now where's that word now that word isn't us now if I open up my mouth and said to you this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Who am I talking about you present word Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever see friends the thing is that if we don't see ourselves brother Graham tells us his greatest curse to the church is people don't recognize who they are and understand this is that when Jesus said in st. John 2:19 jesus answered said unto them it destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up he knew who he was he knew he was called by the word he knew friends the thing is we got to understand this he grew in wisdom and stature the pattern was shown and used same way we're growing in wisdom stature are we not you are Germans I see now if there's some things I could say to you I just want to hold back here for a minute here but I understand this you're the true tabernacle of Jesus Christ tonight you don't want friends if we if we could just grasp some of these things we've seen a prophet a mighty prophet in this day Malachi 4 brought us back to the Apostolic fathers because remember this in closing here we're supposed to be brother ben says the pattern of every church ghost but for the true church at the day of Pentecost so he says the church is booked if we could take an old First Church age Church and put it up right beside us we should be the same no difference Omega Alpha and Omega right and the thing is that they identify themselves because they seen themselves in what the word says now I'm gonna say something here and I'll explain it with Lord willing Sunday morning when G or Peter when Peter said this day this Christmas's fulfilled when he was when he said this is this is joel 2:28 he identified himself in the scripture do you realize he didn't say Calvary he didn't talk about Jesus he didn't talk about any of that what he did he identified himself this is that that joel 2:28 uh uh he later on they identified who Jesus was in the Calvary and all this but what I'm trying to tell you is they identify themselves friends the thing is we identify ourselves now as bride bridegroom form bride form Jesus Christ two thousand years ago Jesus Christ now this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears let's stand amen hallelujah I hope and I was kind of scattered here no one not knowing where I was gonna stop but I think that's good be good to stop now because the thing is while bring it out tomorrow night a little bit more both the order of melchizedek because understand this is that through this understanding of this of who Jesus is of course he allowed us to have a new living way he set up a new way that the Old Testament Saints couldn't understand you realize friends in the Old Testament and let's let's even bring it up to our day present day there's a lot of Old Testament Saints around Old Testament Saints is this that they don't really truly believe in the grace of Almighty God work in their lives because if you truly believe what the grace has done for it you will personify him more you know why because you're allowing him to take control but when we sit there and say we have to do this we have to do that we have to do this we have to do that friends none of that will count the only thing that will count is what you allow him to do through you amen so allow him to do things through you allow him that preeminence how where do you do die that's that's all I know it's died out he said how do you die just died your own opinion your own thoughts see friends we're always giving our own appeaser our own thoughts but just die out to yourself just say Lord you're the only thing that matters amen let's just have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father merciful God were thankful dear Lord Jesus for coming on the scene father I prayed Lord God father we can identify ourselves in a greater way that we have a revelation of who we are and where we've come from Lord and not let just be an intellectual say so but father have a true revelation a true summons from You Lord that we've been called to this great call after the opening of the seven seals Lord because everybody's called to worship but Lord only the true believer father actually worships you in truth in the spirit father I thank you dear God for your grace in our lives I thank you Lord Jesus for you've done for us Lord I thank you Lord Jesus for what you're showing us father I stand here before you Lord God and I want to die to my own thoughts my own opinions father I want your opinions and your thoughts I want you to work through this body Lord God father I pray for my brother Gerald here Lord Jesus is Labour's in this part of the world father there's different things sure that's going on in this in this area father I don't know them all but you know father I pray that you give us grace to keep on pushing keep on pressing on Lord father granted I pray I ask this in our name of our Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you know the song moments like the moments like these amen brother Gerald if you want to come right now I'm not much of a singer hey man you better singer than I am my friend god bless you hey man a reflection of him in for the word Raymond hey yeah baby brother Bob should lead us in that one amen if you would brother come up and lead us in that one it's not okay brother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man thank God for his word a man faith comes by hearing the word and not with your ears but with the ear of the soul a man has got to be single let your eye be single you know that all these things be single but it says let you got to let your hearing be single a man and when it comes to the natural the prophet of God said a lot of lot of any citizen schools here if it's intellectual it goes in one ear you know the other and it buddy big if your area with the ear of the soul it's going to go in and stay in your soul it's going to accomplish the will of God in your soul by the grace of God you're born again by the word but be remembering this it's got to be it's got to be by divine law a relationship of divine love since the scripture says and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not divine love I am nothing brothers brought it out concerning the believer and the make believer a man the believer is motivated by divine law in the prophecy motivator is motivated by David are true believers motivated by divine love in the understanding of all mysteries and all knowledge and faith of a mountains a man you do it for the glory of God a man I just saw a selfish motive or objective no but for the glory of God a man if not then we are nothing so again I brought that to your attention just recently concerning first Corinthians 13 because we're we're gonna have this faith or I got this faith and I got that feat but do we have divine love the part of God's that God permitted all that's gone on and it's going on he said to reveal himself so that we would love him for himself amen seeing the revelation seeing what God has done seen what God is doing he says you're gonna love him for himself by the grace of Almighty God I trust that if they're going further the word a man there's revelation hallelujah there's understanding the revelation of God revelation of God dealing with his sons and daughters the revelation of God bringing out a doubt of that he'd bring it out another bride a man that old brother it'll be a bright that loves you and he said to Peter lovest thou me more than these praise the name of the Lord I trust her we're in that temple with the relationship of love with our Lord Jesus Christ so I pray God may the Holy Ghost take what was preached tonight and put it down into your heart and into your soul a million is not gonna be knowledge that you will leave here and walk out amen no it's gonna be revelation it's gonna be life it's gonna be the greater revelation of Christ that's gonna go with you a greater oneness with Christ that you're going to have by the grace of Almighty God but you don't know how God helped us not not don't let us fall back to religion like all the rest have done and many are doing even around the message just and our brother brought it out just coming to church because it is a ritual religious ritual and although the bride is coming get closer to her bridegroom the writers coming to get more in the likeness of her bridegroom the right is coming to become more one with her bridegroom to ever have a more intimate relationship with our bridegroom by the grace of Almighty God amen so I pray grace they got it God is and God will use industry of the word tonight and again for Saturday and Sunday through our brother amen to magnify the relationship that he is working on with his right the prophet of God said he has come back to be the brain and he said the bride is the Omega a man that's good I like that the verifier that brother brought it out he said a pillar of fire didn't call when the problem left non huh hey man the Velo fire is still there in you and me a man it's Christ is the invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bright god help us that brother that root faith is more real to us than just knowledge intellectual knowledge oh I praise more real to you than the leaders of this country or any other country a man is more real to you by the grace of God than the natural things of life god help us brother things yanked in my heart and I might want preach but to highlight a couple of things that our brother said now I get he was referring to God and Cain good that was good they're in the state they're in the same church and I have preached on which church would you add in well which altar would you go to you know Cain's older or Abel's altar ain't man this is amazing but I want you to notice this to what we brought out the Cain was condemned not for what he did before what he didn't do because the because the Bible says if thou doest well once you also be accepted and many are going to lose their salvation they're going to go to hell now because of what they did but because of what they didn't do a man because God Himself said to Cain if thou would do as well what you also be accepted a man so I pray God will judge ourselves by the word tonight is there anything that God is revealing to us that we didn't do that we should have done but didn't do for him and for the glory of God and for one another a man that this is amazing like like the like again like the the that went in and washed Jesus feet and as similar Simon the believers are the the Pharisee there Jesus says he said look he said you ever done this I come here you never even washed my feet and so on and though it's a tradition and so on but you didn't do it he was condemned for what he didn't do not for what he did that's right and then and and the render and the the she was forgiven and she wasn't condemned for what she did she was blessed for what she did do a man what God wanted her to do by the grace of God so let's do what God wants us to do a man not doing what's right in our own eyes no no by doing what's right in the eyes of God and leave you with this saw - oh yes thank God our brothers bringing that revelation out going from John to Jesus to the upper room good is making it more clear now what's going on giving us more understanding as to what God is doing a man I like that because there's too many God sent a prophet and the problems gone now we're waiting for this waiting for that they're waiting for what God is doing and and they don't recognize what he's doing that's good a man made the Lord can do to bless our brother bringing out making him more clear that's good going from one time when I come to another one well I trust for in the early Tabernacles a man now I just in the right time when akka but with the right worship a man in the in the right spirit that's good a man a good Revelation John to Jesus to the Upper Room and of course he going from brother plant him to Jesus to the bride a man and and again he's right the Alpha and the Omega being the same that's good I like that revelation but now he's great he's making it more clear I trust you'd be more serious with it that scripture that he read and started with we are kings and priests go out and conduct yourself as a king and a priest that's just as tremendous beyond the kings of this world beyond the priesthood of this world this is this is royalty all brothers sister goat and love the Lord and live for the Lord do what you can for him and for his children and then and then his body oh my this is wonderful that's good I like that brother yeah see righto concerning their the right approach to God worship and they worship 24 hours a day that's good I had to go check the script and that it that he was mentioning and write it down he worshiped what they were so 24 hours a day take you take him their their time and so on and then what the Bible tells us in the New Testament pray without ceasing a man God elvis is my in my prayer that we're going to hear that word and let it convict us in our hearts in our souls that work when lord help me to pray without ceasing help me Lord to recognize Who I am and that Lord to recognize the tabernacle that I am in and what you require me in this tabernacle grace grace grace brother the problem made mention the invisible you know the heavenly bragged on the earthly bride he's having an intimate relationship with her and he's reproducing the word in her and through her praise the Lord grace that there will be a virgin birth of the word in the right grace let me just read this scripture there's others too he brought about Cora good and the scripture is of course Jude and he said well unto them for they have gone in the way of King brother not only then but now and what is it to go in the way of King it means to oppose God and God's leadership you're not going to follow God's leadership they're gonna do what they feel to do religiously and all you better come back to the word sources they have gone in the way of Cain and they have ran greedily after the error of Balaam what was the error of Balaam it was human reasoning trying to convince the people the Jews that were all the same with the other race out there we're all the same it was human reasoning and there's human reasoning being used around this message today we got to leave it to thus saith the Lord it is written don't reason and that says they have perished in the gainsaying of korah and what was the gainsaying of korah they were denying God's authority brother god help us that we're going to be the sons and daughters of God and going beyond that to the Bride of Christ by the grace of God amen Lord bless you and God bless our our brother Jerry let's be in prayer for him and to service tomorrow night be in prayer that God all this is good I'm looking forward to it maybe we could come out and preach for another couple of hours hey man they won't
