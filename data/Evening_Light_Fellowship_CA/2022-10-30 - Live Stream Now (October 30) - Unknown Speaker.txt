Believers thou this amen hallelujah your sake when he when he came here 2000 years ago Hallelujah and here he was at the grave of Lazarus and then oh oh he's going to rise up over in the resurrection he said I am the resurrection amen he was bringing it out of the future into the present out of the past into the present and brother if there's anything else he's doing in this hour that's what he's doing he's bringing the resurrection not not up there it's here amen not back there two thousand years ago no it's here now amen praise the name of the Lord and brother he's getting the bride to believe it Believers brother amen for God to do it God's got to get got to get his seed to believe it amen brother you go right right on into the enter the Bible the Bible says in in Genesis and it says by faith Abel amen by faith this one by faith that one by Faith No and so on Amen brother he he had somebody there to believe what he was going to do amen he revealed it amen testing their faith and just saying look look what Abel did went out and offered the sacrifice that he offered amen that was faith Cain offered a sacrifice like the world is offered sacrificed today basically the world wants to oh do this for God do that for God amen amen let your sacrifice reflect and reveal what he did for you amen this is redemption this is salvation amen let's let's uh sacrifice amen and reveal just reveal what God has done and is doing for us amen he laid down his life picked it up again raptured the Old Testament Saints amen and he's laid down his life picked it up again it was for the bride amen oh yes brother sister he laid down his life amen and Glory Hallelujah and brother he came back and he began to pick up pick up pick up his life again in this hour in this age the resurrection amen and the Rapture praise the Lord and brother if anything that God was revealing in its in the ministry of William Brown oh my brother's sister what was it we know what it was in Lutheran and Wesley and in the others said yes even the Pentecostals but brother what about what about the bright age in this hour amen oh yeah justification we got it amen sanctification we got it amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit thank God he gave it to us through the Pentecostal Revival but amen but still there was a move on for to give us the resurrection and rapturing Faith Amen to bring it all to a climax amen so brother all day God was doing that with the ages he climaxed in the Pentecostal age and now he's climaxing it all down through this yes Jew and Gentile the resurrection and the Rapture amen he promised that all we could get into scripture after scripture God was pointing to this appointing to that amen and finally oh yeah he challenged if it's challenging our faith on anything it's not just to be healed is to be raised from the dead amen we're raised from the dead Fair spiritually amen now to be raised from the dead physically praise the name of the Lord amen that's why when he came to the grave of Lazarus there and Mary and Martha were there oh he'll rise in in the resurrection you know you're never looking ahead two or three thousand years yeah he said I am the resurrection amen yeah it's not it's not where he's waiting for this and waiting for that it's here amen the resurrection was right there with them amen and his question was and his question is believe us now this amen do we believe in the resurrection and if there's anything that God through the messenger of the hour was pointing us to whether it's not just the older it's the mystery of the Seven Seals that this mystery is this mystery is that mystery Brothers the mystery that we need now is resurrection and rapture amen what is God doing how is God doing it Amen brother are we ready well brother I tell you this what was the message ordained to do it was ordained to give us rosual erection and rapturing Faith Amen brother in every age God sent the message to give them the faith that they needed amen we're the Luthers and and the faith of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost gets to the spirit amen oh praise the Lord thank God for what he did wonderful but now what's he doing now it's come to that time oh what a challenge to our faith to believe the resurrection to believe in the Rapture to believe amen this is what all we know why God did through Lutheran Wesley and the Pentecostals amen and other revivals for what is God doing in us and through US amen and brother it's a bright Revival and the bride Revival Hallelujah brother it's the uniting of the of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride yeah and brother is going to take the resurrection and the rapture to climaxes you take the Resurrection The Rapture to perfect it by the grace of almighty God Amen resurrection and Rapture to all we're moving out of faith into reality amen it's going to bring the bride and the bridegroom not will it is bringing the bride and the bridegroom together oh brother it wasn't William Branham it was Jesus amen let me say it again when the prophet came to the pulpit now he said okay he said uh he said excuse me he said but I got to get myself out of the way he said I can't do this amen why he was Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart amen and then that's not just Healing The Sick and these signs and wonders and miracles but even in this even in the meetings in his own church the dead was raised oh yes even that that sister that time one time just fell out of the seat onto the floor she died amen and the problem went down prayed for her she came back to life the dead was raised five times in the ministry of William Branham his grace amen but what was God doing God was revealing to the bride the resurrection revealing to the Bride of the Rapture Amen brother is no longer just driving by a cemetery and oh feeling so bad everybody's gone now no they're not going to right there waiting for you amen that's the problem of God saying they're going to appear to us amen glory hallelujah amen oh yeah he said they're going to appear to us and we're going to have fellowship with them amen to up to the living Saints during the resurrection oh brother sister what's God doing please in the name of Jesus I pray Grace that we have the faith of what God is doing brother and we want to be part of it brother it's not just waiting for God to do is wait for God God's waiting on you amen that's what the prophet said God's waiting on you amen God's waiting on you to to express your faith amen that's right in what you do and how you do it not just what you say it's your life amen sure brother it wasn't just what Abel was saying what he did amen Cain he just he just didn't have it oh yes it was nice what he did just think all that he give God all that he give God Amen but yet God gave it to him God gave it to him and so he turned around gave it to God on the Altar and he just didn't he just felt so bad about Abel you know because Abel did this and they and he argued with Abel amen yeah but yet God received Abel's sacrifice why he didn't think Abel did offered the right sacrifice what he had all this Cain and he will take one lamb and kill it and shed his blood Abel what's wrong with you you felt maybe the neighbor just never had a good spirit he did he had the right spirit brother sometimes they don't we take the stand we take Colorado and on us that's right we take those down we take and people think we're being too hard they're so religious and so wondrous oh they're this they're that and so legal no no we're Believers we're staying with the word Amen brother it can't Abel's day with the word but but can't no he just did it this way he did it that way oh Lord I'll do it this way I won't kill nothing but sometimes God wants to get wants you to kill something he wants to let you let him kill you you got to lay down your life and pick it up again amen and the thing of it is there's too many Believers that won't lay down their lives no no oh they'll give this to God or maybe they're they're in church today and in church Wednesday and they'll give this to God they'll do this for God do that for God but God wants your life so that's not you it's him doing it amen so it's not brother Jonathan coming up here to minister it's Jesus amen is Jesus ministry is Jesus talking to us is Jesus revealing himself through his word to us and we thank you for what he's done through our brother Jonathan amen so brother God and God help us to us Christ in US receiving what he was giving amen receiving the word amen oh yes Amen brother listen what God requires in us he was working on us through our brother Jonathan he's working on us through the ministry amen why because why God what's God looking for in you and me Faith he's looking for faith without faith it is impossible to please him amen amen so God got the ministry there and God has sent in the church amen this ministry this ministry that Ministry amen and no praise the Lord what was for number one perfecting of the saint of the ministry amen for the Saints and so on oh yeah God God got the ministry for this to put five full purpose amen and there's as the brother Brad said the five-fold ministries of the Bride he said it's there now amen is there to give us the word to give us the faith that God's looking for in you what are you believing how are you believing amen brother it's not what what they had years ago or whatever yeah God appreciates that but what he's doing now the present tense amen there's too many it's past tense and unfortunately brother even in the message there's too much past tense God did this through William Branham God did that God did this God did what's he doing now amen remember he did all of that to get the chance of the bride and to get in the bride with the bride to make the Word Flesh in the bride amen so God help us to believe stay in the word yes let the word stay in you as the prophet said you said you're in the message but the message is not in you he knew that oh yes this is absolutely I want something I was going to say about what's a my little pad certain individuals yeah so brother sister I pray Grace stay with the word Amen brother let lay down your life every day for the word of God whatever you do you're going to do it for God you're going to do it for Jesus amen praise the Lord and believing that if you do this Lord you oh thank you Lord I don't deserve it but I want to serve you anyhow but he he's going to reward you praise the Lord God bless you joining me to Isaiah chapter 55. amen we've already preached okay amen Isaiah 55. verse 1. and it speaks of the Everlasting salvation amen and brother is moving us on to the resurrection moving us on to the rapture praise the name of the Lord and he said oh everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that had no money Come Ye buy and eat yea come by wine and milk without money and without price and wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread amen and your labor for that which satisfyth not aren't diligently unto me and each ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness the fatness of the word incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people amen a leader and Commander to the people Bill thou shall call a nation that thou knowest not and Nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God for the Holy One of Israel for he had glorified thee amen let's give the glory to Jesus and seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near because there's an hour when he won't be found and there's an hour when he won't be near but he has revealed himself to be near amen so Grace brother sister that we're going to acknowledge and respect his presence let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man is thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for Eve will Hallelujah for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord but he has come down in the anointing of the Holy Ghost to blend us with the words amen and as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and he has increased our thoughts amen from time to Eternity amen to a new Heaven and a new Earth for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not neither but watered the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater amen hallelujah greeting our brother and greetings from our brother Rob snow amen so I wanted to know I when speaking with him this week I said this have anybody been shoveling snows in in central Newfoundland no I think there have been times when they people have Endeavor to shovel the Snows amen there's quite a few snows in in the word and in the message in central amen so God bless them praise the Lord amen so don't don't worry about the name it's scriptural amen amen and we certainly enjoyed the fellowship with our brother Ron and sister Shirley undone the phone the other night amen God bless them again verse 10 for the rain coming down and the snow from heaven our brother Ron comes from heaven amen and returneth not dither but water the Earth amen and they've been around for quite a while and they've been and God's been using the water the faith amen of many of his children amen and says but water the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater and so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I said it continue to the end for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the Briar shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off God bless his words you may be seated amen thank you for your patience amen ah so by the grace of God if I could share with you some other thoughts concerning the rapture and it saws that I have expressed and ministered on some years ago but I want to share with you again because we're getting closer and closer to the rapture we're getting closer and closer to what God is requiring of us and there's anything that God has requiring of us now it is rapturing Faith amen it is one thing to say Lord I believe you sent the messenger I believe there was it was Malachi 4 you did this you revealed the seals you revealed this mystery of that mystery that's good but what's what's what's it accomplishing in US amen there's one thing to bring us out of the denominations oh yes but it's another thing to bring us into the word into the message and into Christ it's another thing to bring us into the faith that God is looking for praise the name of the Lord and it's more than just coming at our denominations that's coming into Christ again as I said it's like one time when I was kneeling at adulter at a certain church and there were the others uh around praying and again this this believer that was just kneeling to the left of me there and they they were praying his oh Lord thank you for bringing us out of denomination and thank you Lord so that we don't have to come under any man anymore and I said Lord I said I said they don't have the Revelation I said because you're going to bring them bring it up from under the control of one to the control of another amen I tell you this they weren't under they weren't under the leadership of the Egyptians in Egypt but I tell you when they came out of Egypt they were under the leadership of Moses and and and and Aaron I believe it was Joshua and so on Amen so brother because of why it's God's leadership is what God does and how God does it amen don't think oh we're free so I don't have to listen to anybody amen God is ordained the God has set in the church amen the faithful Ministry and why this and why that why did God do it that way it's to test your faith amen not only the test your faith is to increase your faith amen because if you're going if you're going to recognize that this is God and this is this is what God does and this is how God is doing it amen it's going to increase your faith amen there's too many thinking that oh God came through the message of the prophet and he brought us out of denominations now we don't have now we don't have to be subject to any man now we don't have to ever have any leadership with Lord we just let you lead but I'll tell you this rather he'll bring you out from that but he'll bring you under another leadership almost definitely amen you're not under the leadership of denomination you're not under the leadership of the nominee those Brethren out there the ministry over there that's controlled by denominations my brother he's going to bring you out from under that Ministry to another Ministry most evidently again because as it is written that God has set in the church amen and the proud of God somebody asked the prophet of God the question concerning you know our ministry does the bride have a Ministry he said yes he said the bright God of ministry he said it's in the church and it's in the church now and he quoted Ephesians he said and God has said in the church this rightful Ministry amen but again we think because we came out out from under denominational rule that we come up from under the control of man we can have under the control of the leadership of ministry no not by any means amen God took you up from under that leadership and brought you under the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and the leadership of the Holy Ghost is in a faithful Ministry amen the Republic of God has highlighted it the proper goddess has put the emphasis on it amen to get our attention to the ministry so it's not just coming out of denomination and oh yeah and now I believe the message with that sent I don't have listen to anybody else oh yes you do amen and God brought you out of that and he brought you under another Ministry to teach you the word he brought you in another Ministry to give you to give you the word that will give you the faith that will please God Amen and it's not just it's not just oh the Lord's going to do this the Lord's going to do that no no we're not without the ministry not without not by any means so brother and sister don't never think they that they oh they trust me so that I don't have to listen to this I don't have to listen to that I don't have to follow this ministry that Ministry amen sometimes God is testing your faith to follow him to see if you'll follow him in the ministry amen will you follow him in that ministry will you follow him in that Ministry where they acknowledge Him in that Ministry amen or the other Ministry amen as acknowledge in our Lord and believing that it was it was God ministering to us through our brother Jonathan amen God ministering to us through the other Ministries amen that he would send our way amen don't think we don't have to have it we don't I don't think we don't need it we do because brother God God has got a pattern God's Got A Plan God's got a purpose and this is this is what God is doing this is how God is going to do it brother all down true right from beginning to end there has been a Ministry amen God always has listened and whether even in the even in heaven he got the Angels amen that's right even in heaven the angel there to minister the angels are there to do this the angels are there to do that by the grace of almighty God Amen and yet there are so many Believers that think because God through the messenger of the hour the prophet of the hour brought us out of the denominations then we don't have to be under any man we don't have to be in any church you don't most definitely do amen and as Believers that have come out of denominations and they won't go to church they won't go to any church they they wanted they won't don't even bother the fellowship with Believers the fellowship with family and friends and neighbors but what about Believers Amen brother because we're there to minister to one another where they're they're there to encourage one another amen praise the name of the Lord until I pray the grace of God don't never let the devil give you that that that that that Spirit don't ever let the devil give you that feeling that you don't have to listen to a Ministry you don't have to come under a Ministry that you don't have to do this you don't have to do that brother the thing of it is say God brings us out from from the control of a denomination and amen into under the word amen back to the word amen and brother if you're coming back to the word brother if it was it was the Jews in the Old Testament he brought him under Prophet after Prophet after Prophet Ministry after Ministry after Ministry amen if they were looking for God they were looking for a Ministry amen and they had to recognize the ministry that God would send whether it was Isaiah the prophet or or in the Book of Genesis brother that Cain should have recognized the ministry that God was was witnessing to him through evil amen oh no he was judging Abel he argued with Abel oh yeah the Bible says they went out there and they just argued and fussed and and he killed Abel amen that's right and brother today there are those that would argue with the true Ministry of God and and kill them not necessarily physically but spiritually oh yes you're not necessarily God God is going to judge us not necessarily for killing somebody physically but you can kill the kill their influence amen spiritually amen that you can spread this word and that word concerning this brother this brother that brother amen amen to try and try that and and get the people oh just ignore that that brother amen be careful you're killing him amen and and to kill him you're gonna you're gonna kill God's influence amen and you're going to answer for it brother sister yes and Sir again against is there a respect again like he says respect our brother Jonathan here and and to believe that it is God ministering through the brother not not say oh hey brother Jonathan brother Jonathan no it's God so thank you Lord for the ministry thank you for what you said amen oh we're not not giving the glory to brother Jonathan because I sure he don't want it amen but we'll give the glory to God Amen and believe that it was God Ministry to us through the ministry God ministering through us to us through that Pastor that or that evangelist whoever whatever whatever calling he might have amen oh just don't don't think again and that's unfortunate that too many so-called Believers that believe that they are the bride but brother they don't they they'd absolutely refuse to come under the ministry oh yeah I've I've experienced those things over the years and I've experienced many who have amen took their stand as it were for the message and for the word but they wouldn't come under the ministry to counsel them in the word no no I've actually like I said I've experienced many like that that have done that over the years and brother they're better their spirit is not right their attitude is not right because again there's certain Ministries I'm not saying they're not trying to promote this one not by any means no but there's certain Ministries that God is in and God's with and to reject that Ministry you're rejecting God Amen to reject what our brother Jonathan was Ministry is to reject Jesus you're not rejecting brother Jonathan no you're rejecting Jesus amen and brother in the end brother at the time of the of the time of the Judgment amen they're going to be judged for rejecting the Lord and then they'll lord said you you didn't listen to me and they said listen to you what do you mean you didn't say this you didn't say yes I did and he said the Lord the Lord will open the sky there and he said there look up oh and he said they'll see this ministry they'll see Jesus ministry to that one Ministry through that one but he was ministering to these and they didn't recognize Jesus because they never recognize the ministry amen so let's record let's recognize the ministry let's recognize and do not recognize that as Jesus ministering to me is Jesus teaching me is Jesus meeting me amen we asked whether it's her our brother Jonathan this ministering there and we've had our brother Mark here minister a few times amen not lately but we may get him to do it again amen to exhort the Saints oh yes definitely if he's not if he's not ministering you you you could have the call to exhort Oh yes most definitely by the grace of almighty God so brother said let's let's recognize God and what God's doing it's not being put in our focus on man let's focus on God Amen brother there's too much going on today and then they're putting their focus on man man man and they'll raise this man up they'll raise that man up they're glorified this man or they'll put this one down put that one down and brother they're not recognizing Jesus God help us that we're going to recognize Jesus brother again to believe that it's not not our our brother Jonathan or some other Ministry brother Ministry or brother Mark is not not their Ministry it's Jesus amen is Jesus giving us the word amen because it is it is Jesus that's in the ministry God has set in the church amen for the perfecting of the Saints amen so brother to for God to perfect us through the ministry of the word we got to recognize and honor and respect the ministry amen so God help us to do that amen thank God Amen for the for the ministry of our brother Jonathan thank God for the ministry of the other brothers amen that have stood behind this Pulpit to God be the glory amen brother they're going to be surprised when we get when when they come to the end and they find out they missed this they missed that and they wonder why and God will show them here oh that was brother so-so no that was Jesus oh that was brother someone said no no no that was me that was Jesus amen you Lord yes I was I was speaking to you and ministering to you through that Ministry amen well brother we better take it serious amen we better take it serious amen but down through the years as I've said that I've had to deal with much and I've had to deal with with with the so-called Believers not respecting the ministry oh yes and I I and I I've been a bit in in pulpits as it were introducing Ministries and so on and yes encouraging the people to respect that Ministry respect the word Amen brother don't look at the bat the person look at the word pay not pay attention to the person pay attention to the word amen listen we're not here to find fought with brother Jonathan no or if I fought my brother Mark what about the word amen let's respect the word amen whether to God be the glory amen so brother he said again so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void amen and going out of God's mouth is going out of the ministry's mouth to believe that it's the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen ministering the word the anoint of the Holy Ghost is speaking to you I'm speaking to you brother Jonathan wasn't speaking to us no no it's the Holy Ghost he's God please in the name of Jesus we come to worship Jesus amen we come to hear Jesus we come to hear his word amen amen forsake not the Assembly of yourselves together and much more as you see the day approaching amen Grace brother but the the I think the prophet did say sometime long ago I don't know where it is now I said if you don't find it if you find it tell me but seemed like I said it was in he was in in one of his message books and it was on on this side of the book and down down the bottom that I remember the prophet of God saying he said the hour is coming when he said we should we he said when we should meet every night oh yeah meet every night what and it was seemed like now services are getting less and less one time it was every Sunday there was two services that I when I was raised up brother even in denomination they have service Sunday morning at 11 o'clock and of course we as as young people back then we had Sunday school around three o'clock yeah in the church and then service again at seven o'clock oh yeah yeah and he got not only that the service would if it's seven o'clock it would go on to around 12 midnight or one o'clock in the morning Services yes sir that was the kind of services we had in the in the old-fashioned Salvation Army and I said I remember even amen I can remember now as I said sitting in a front Pew and uh oh I was just a young person sitting right at the front Pew and then all of a sudden they went on a Jericho March oh yeah they did oh yes they they started they went on down and went on right around the marching they would gather at the pulpit first or down at the altar and they were worshiping and worshiping then they'd line up and go to Jericho March and and they go up that side and they go on out in the into the porch we call it and then they come on back again in the other door and come on on overall kept on going kept on going and I was sitting I was set as a young boy sitting in the front seat and I remember now that I had to pull myself in and pull my legs in under the seat amen because they were moving around going walking around and they were singing Onward Christian Soldiers amen Martinez to war and praising the Lord and praising the Lord you experience that even in the Salvation Army yes I experienced it in the Salvation Army amen experience that even even in Pentecost amen the old-fashioned Pentecostal church that I attended years ago here in St John's amen and they would go and go and March and March and March and March praising the Lord amen tremendous praise the Lord and again even in the fellowship with Believers at one time they Fellowship a lot more than they did now oh yeah grace of God to us there's only going to be a few please be numbered with the few amen it's not the many it's not the it's not the great big groups it's the little groups amen that's like the power of God they wondered they wondered why in the world they said to William Branham they said brother why in the world would you would you refuse Ministry to this group over here and there might be two or three thousand and he says you're going to minister over to a few people he said maybe you know maybe uh three or four dozen or something like that and well he said the Lord wanted me to go there not there amen because God God had more freedom more Liberty in that little group than he did in than he did in the large group amen so brother and sister let us recognize God as don't don't think oh Lord what's wrong we're getting smaller we're getting smaller good praise the Lord amen straight As the straight As the gate Narrows away and few there be that find it amen if there's too many if there's big crowds oh no no something wrong exactly brother somewhere there's compromise amen as and then again all due respect and I know there are churches around the message and they've got maybe hundreds of hundreds of Believers in big churches and so on but I'll tell you this Jesus even when he was here oh yes he first when he had his ministry there oh at one point there he had he had his 12 disciples and he had 70. 70 disciples following him and wherever he went they were there amen yeah recognizing his ministry recognizing this recognizing that until he spoke the word amen and they said who can do this who can believe this and they were and they went away and walk no more with him amen and Jesus turned to the 12 and said will you also go away no he said you got the words of eternal life they recognize the words of eternal life they didn't understand everything even what he said they didn't understand it but they believed it amen even though we don't understand everything let's believe it that it is God Amen brother so they they went back and went on their own way again brother God help us stay with the word whether you understand this and whether you want this and don't want that leave it with the Lord and move on if if you recognize the word that it is God in his word Amen brother and his it's increasing your faith in God stay with it amen because again remember even though the 70 walked away Judas stayed he stayed brother and brother brother Branham also said again and I was thinking about that very very early this morning while I was still in bed six or seven o'clock six o'clocks for sure I think and I said Lord where is it where is it please I want to find that quote Lord and it is he said judaistarians he said there it's Jewish terrians in the church he said pretended Brothers yeah and he and he's oh yeah he said they're in Hmong Believers yeah Hmong believers yeah I'm sure I'll try to find that quote you can try to find it yeah so brother Jesus had to deal with it we're dealing with it that was Jesus back then and he was betrayed and he was crucified and Jesus and the prophet of God said he said there's judaistarians he said in the churches today and he said they're there and he said for the same thing to betray us it's not going to be easy he was crucified then he's crucified now oh what brother Brown yes brother Brown preached preached on it you know yes he did because the denominations crucified it my brother I tell you this is going to get even more serious because there's going to be Jewish terrians in in around the world still professing to be believers yeah beyond your guard amen don't think oh don't worry my brother if everything's gonna be fine now because we're getting closer to the Rapture the closer you get to the Rapture brother the more you're going to have the experience of juditarians that'll betray you amen Judas was right there right there and to 24 to take Jesus right out to Calvary praise the Lord so brother sister I pray the grace of God be with us stay with the word amen take your stand for the word regardless of of anything negative that you might experience among other other believers stay with the word amen Jesus stayed Jesus took his dad we got to take our stand and if Jesus Is With Us Jesus is in us we will take our stand we will stay with the word amen and listen as Jesus was betrayed and crucified we will be to betrayed and crucified don't think because oh we're Believers so we got no worries and we can go around the world with Believers and and they'll respect us no not necessarily no no God help us stay with the word don't compromise and the thing of it is is that there's too many churches are compromising they're compromising with the world and the things of the world oh yeah they're getting more and more worldly oh yeah like the denominations out there they're allowing this they're allowing it they're focusing more and more on the world focusing more and more on the things of the world amen God help us stay with the word amen so sorry I'm spend an hour already but what are thoughts that I want to share with you oh my did we have time for all this I don't I don't know that's four four messages okay and this oh my I'll live to just just start I guess and then come again on Wednesday and see well we can never finish it no no way amen God bless brother Jonathan if he can start to finish your message amen that'll be good but when it comes to starting to finish a message you can't do it no because boy it come from eternity in the time when we're going back to Eternity so brother there's no there's no way we can get away from eternity there's no way we can narrow it down not by any means you know but to stay stay with the word and there's these thoughts that I wanted to share with you on the Rapture and as I said I preached them a number of years ago and I still have oh oh not enough yeah so it's quite a few pages but we'll see what the Lord will allow us to bring to you and minister to you again concerning the rapture because we're getting closer to the Rapture amen and brother God by his by the grace and by the ministry of the word is focusing more and more on rapturing faith and we thank the Lord again for the ministry of our brother Jonathan and the emphasis he was putting on faith faith faith faith Because Why without faith it is impossible to please him amen whether whether it's the faith that they've required in the first age or the faith in the sixth age but the faith in the seventh age under Pentecost but brother now we're going on to a bright age the crowning of the Pentecostal age with a bride message Amen to give us a resurrection and a robbery faith now brother I'll be honest that Pentecost when when they started way back a hundred years ago that they they felt that they felt that there are some of them not all of them felt that what God was doing in Pentecostal Revival a hundred years ago was going to go on and climax with the rapture and some of them were right but again all of course they were the older ones and of course the Lord took them on and they they're gone on Amen to their reward but the Pentecostal people they eventually just became another denomination and so God had to move on to scene again to call out from all these organizations out of these denominations to call the bride so brother it's not Pentecost and it's it's not the Lutheran or the or the methodists or or any of the others but no it is the bride Revival let's take the bride on to the resurrection take the oh God help us please Lord help us that we're we're not just getting into the letter of the word and Lord your Prophet said this your Prophet said that but praying Grace oh God that it's becoming a revelation to us Lord and we're getting a greater and a greater a revelation of the Rapture a greater revelation of the Resurrection amen Brothers the lutherans got into what God was revealing oh my they were thinking about justification but all of a sudden it struck them and it became a a Revival in their hearts to Revival in their souls amen and they would preach it morning noon and night justification because it struggled amen that Jesus Justified him that they didn't have to do this they didn't have to do that do this Jesus already did it and is because we're justified in Jesus and of course what what did they think they thought that they they had to justify themselves they were oh yeah that's what Luther was thinking that that he would justify himself if he did this if he did that if he went here and he went there oh and he made many Journeys because he thought that oh there's a if he was going to be justified in the presence of God he had to do this he had to do that until finally he was so it just he just didn't feel Justified he was doing this doing that and the more he did it this seemed like he still wasn't Justified until one day he was so frustrated and he was crying unto the Lord and to finally and he was walking and walking to finally walk into the church that he attended and of course right in the vestibule thereof there was the on on the on the thing there and there was a there was a Bible oh and Luther went into the church and he he was all frustrated and he went over to the Bible and opened the Bible oh struck him did Jesus Justified us Jesus Justified us oh and that shock and that brought the Lutheran Revival and he went preaching that we didn't have to do this for justification we didn't have to do that for justification he said Jesus has already done it he said we need the faith that we are Justified amen and he went and preached that and that was the that was the the Lutheran Revival amen by the grace of God the word of God it's brother sister so it's the same with us let's come to the word let's see what God Said in the word amen oh praise the Lord let's not build upon this and build upon that amen let's get into amen what God Said and what God's doing amen that we'll have the faith make it live in US that we'll add the faith to make the resurrection and the Rapture in US oh yeah the prophet of God and we'll get you do it maybe Wednesday or the following service and uh the father of God brings out in them many different messages concerning the rapture and he said the rapture oh should the ruptures that's been going on all time it is yeah yeah he said the Rapture is is here it's in our hearts this is in our souls and he said he said we we've been raptured yeah we have yes because what God has done God is doing amen God's bringing us to pass in your life mine so I want to bring out concerning the resurrection concerning the Rapture oh God to give us the faith of the present tense to give us the faith that is not something up the road it's what God's doing now brother what what brought what brought them all down Through the Ages was the resurrection amen of Jesus the brother has brought us all down brought us all down amen from one age to the other it was the resurrection of Jesus and now we're going into the rapture amen oh yes we could get back there and do the scripture where Jesus was cut up amen Jesus was talking to the disciples and oh yeah and the Bible says that did the the Old Testament Saints rose with him and brother and after this the disciples were talking to Jesus oh they looked and there was Jesus going up and the Old Testament Saints was going up with him and brother Jesus is going up and the New Testament Saints are going up with him God help us that's the rapture and brother if there's anything that God wants us to focus on now through the message of the hour it's the resurrection and the rapture brother we thank God for justification we thank God for sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit good thank you Lord but what do we need now we need the resurrection and the rapture thank God for the resurrection to rapture and the prophet of God has highlighted it and we will in in due time as we get into it share with you some of the thoughts that Prophet expressed concerning the resurrection and the rapture it's amazing one of the last sermons he preached was rapturing faith 1965. amen God help us that we're going to get into the revelation of the Rapture that we will have rapturing faith by the grace of God amen it's not just faith God did this God did this God did that oh yes thank you Lord for the prophet thank you for this revelation of the Seven Seals oh Lord this mystery and that mystery oh yeah the Revelation or the mystery of the god the mystery of serpent seed the mystery of uh and this Lord that happened in the scriptures here yeah but what about the mystery of the rapture what about the mystery of the Resurrection what is God doing and how is God doing it there was a resurrection there is a resurrection the Old Testament saints were resurrected and raptured now the New Testament Saints are being resurrected and raptured the prophet of God said they that are gone on now he said they at their Rapture they're going to appear to the living Saints amen and then we're going to step into the we're going to step into that Dimension with them and he said we're going to have fellowship with them and he said he said now it's eternity but he used he used time to to express to us along that we're going to be fellowshipping with the Saints who are gone on and then he said after that certain period of time he said then they were going to look up and he said there in the cloud is Jesus there the cloud is Jesus amen praise the Lord I don't know if you know this or not but uh right here who's that that's that's brother random it's brother Branham well yeah he said he was he was in the cloud yeah he's there and this is the cloud of course up there and it's William Branham thank God yeah the overall Cloud itself is revealing Jesus amen and Jesus was acknowledging the prophetic Ministry praise the Lord so brother this
