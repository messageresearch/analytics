[34:23] to listen to the word amen others will
[34:25] get up and walk away
[34:27] but but his seed is going to stay so
[34:30] thank god for the word and thank god for
[34:32] the grace of our relationship with him
[34:35] amen praise the lord hallelujah oh just
[34:38] think oh we're not just christians oh
[34:40] because christ is christ is christian

[34:44] we're christ-like no no we're we are the
[34:47] seed of god
[34:48] amen we are the sons and daughters of
[34:51] god
[34:52] amen and he's bringing that out in by
[34:55] the going forth of his word amen because
[34:57] his seed his sons and daughters are
[34:59] going to feed on his word
[35:01] amen they respond to his word they love

[35:06] lord so brother we when it comes to the
[35:09] natural relationship between us and and
[35:11] natural family oh brother thank god for
[35:13] the relationship between house and our
[35:15] spiritual family
[35:17] amen the relationship between us and our
[35:20] lord jesus christ praise the name of the
[35:22] lord so again just to say that i i just
[35:26] come to the pulpit not to preach i'll
[35:28] try not to amen and uh
[35:32] and i wouldn't surprise you if i did
[35:34] but again we'll we'll leave it to our
[35:36] brother steve
[35:37] and i just want to welcome our brother
[35:39] steve and sister anna amen clara amen
[35:42] from british columbia from alberta amen
[35:45] to newfoundland amen the new found land
[35:49] praise the lord
[35:50] so and uh we brought it that before
[35:53] concerning maybe you know god ordained
[35:56] it god god also
[35:58] put newfoundland here for a reason
[36:00] amen exactly because why because some
[36:03] years ago
[36:05] when when the plane could have
[36:07] flashed out in the ocean
[36:09] the power of god then the plane of the
[36:11] landing gander
[36:12] in in here in newfoundland oh he did yes
[36:15] he did yeah so the the father god was
[36:18] was familiar with newfoundland he knew
[36:20] where it was
[36:22] amen and not only that for that reason
[36:24] because of the plane but because of the
[36:26] of uh of a dog that he had
[36:29] amen and like i said i got a picture of
[36:31] that dog it comes up on my computer
[36:33] and uh it's part newfoundland and part
[36:36] airshire but it's more like a
[36:37] newfoundland we would we'd recognize it
[36:40] as being like a newfoundland dog amen so
[36:43] for the proud of god identified with
[36:46] newfoundland amen and i guess some
[36:48] newfoundlanders
[36:50] and only that i don't know if you're
[36:51] aware of it but
[36:54] there were a number of people from
[36:56] newfoundland that did
[36:58] write
[36:59] william branham letters requesting
[37:01] prayer
[37:02] and in fact
[37:04] in just in in the basement here there
[37:06] are some old papers
[37:09] from another pastor that's going on for
[37:11] a number of years
[37:12] and
[37:13] part of those papers is a letter that
[37:16] his mother wrote years ago requesting
[37:19] prayer
[37:20] for from brother william branham
[37:23] and there's a response to that letter
[37:25] amen
[37:26] and uh saying that uh
[37:28] we'll we'll put you on the prayer list
[37:30] we're going to pray for you and we're
[37:32] encouraging you to believe this way and
[37:34] we want you to do this and they said
[37:36] also send a prayer cloth
[37:38] and
[37:39] and according to the instructions on the
[37:41] letter that they received from brother
[37:43] branham that they had to take the prayer
[37:45] cloth and apply it to where they they
[37:48] feel they need healing in their body he
[37:51] said apply it there amen and so i assume
[37:55] that's what she did many many many years
[37:57] ago that was like i said brother
[37:59] manuel's mother
[38:01] and
[38:01] also also brother manuel did write
[38:04] brother branham many years ago now
[38:08] inviting him to come to newfoundland for
[38:10] services and and he acknowledged it and
[38:13] he said brother uh we're we're putting
[38:15] it on the prayer list on on the prayer
[38:17] list and we we pray the lord give us the
[38:19] leadership
[38:21] he said when he would want us to come to
[38:22] newfoundland amen so of course he didn't
[38:25] come for services
[38:28] i don't know how much longer after that
[38:30] the lord called him home so we thank god
[38:32] that the prophet identified with
[38:34] newfoundland
[38:36] he had connection with newfoundland amen
[38:39] and with with uh
[38:41] yes believers in newfoundland so thank
[38:43] god and we're so glad amen well again
[38:47] for for
[38:48] where where that led us to the word to
[38:50] the message amen
[38:53] that he would leave
[38:54] what through his servant the prophet
[38:56] thank god
[38:58] it's wonderful
[38:59] to god be the glory and as i said
[39:02] they were listening to william branham's
[39:04] sermons and in fact
[39:06] i do know that there was a certain
[39:08] sister the wife of a certain pastor back
[39:11] there that she used to receive brother
[39:14] obama's tapes
[39:16] and uh did on a regular basis
[39:18] and they they did that back back years
[39:20] ago that when brother brown preached and
[39:22] they taped it and then they sent the
[39:24] tapes out to those that that were on the
[39:27] on the list wanting to receive his tapes
[39:30] and at the time it was sister emanuel uh
[39:33] in uh in central newfoundland that was
[39:36] receiving the tapes
[39:37] to and she would give them to brother
[39:40] emanuel she wanted him to hear the word
[39:42] amen praise the lord so thank god
[39:45] brother
[39:47] see that's that's what god does and
[39:48] that's how god does it
[39:50] but by grace amen so and again that was
[39:53] brother manuel uh the main pastor that
[39:56] god used
[39:57] to
[39:58] highlight the message in newfoundland
[40:00] and to introduce the message introduce
[40:02] the prophet amen so we thank the lord
[40:04] for that so god moves in mysterious ways
[40:07] is wonders to perform so we thank the
[40:10] lord again for brother brown's
[40:12] association with newfoundland and again
[40:14] like it's not only not only his dog but
[40:17] but better the the believers

[40:21] many years amen to god

[54:01] to romans chapter 14
[54:04] romans chapter 14 and uh we're just

[54:12] this evening
[54:14] amen

[54:19] 17.
[54:24] amen
[54:26] for the kingdom of god is not
[54:29] meat and drink
[54:32] but righteousness
[54:34] and peace
[54:36] and joy in
[54:39] the holy ghost
[54:40] amen praise the lord
[54:43] righteousness peace and joy in
[54:46] the holy ghost
[54:48] amen let's have our seats this evening
[54:51] amen
[54:52] praise the lord
[54:54] hallelujah i'd like to speak to you this
[54:57] this evening on a little thought
[55:00] that i i was praying about and it's a
[55:02] little word on joy you know something we
[55:05] need joy
[55:07] the the world that we're living in is
[55:08] full of darkness and
[55:10] there's peril and there's strife and
[55:12] we're just saying he's the god of the
[55:14] day as well as the god of the night and
[55:16] that brings me great joy
[55:19] and so we want to speak on joy because
[55:21] in a time that we're living in and it's
[55:22] a lady of sia time
[55:24] it's time of luke warmness it's a time
[55:27] where people have cooled off and and you
[55:30] know in our season and a time that we're
[55:32] living with all this this is going on in
[55:34] our in the in the world today there's
[55:37] people that have seemingly uh did not
[55:40] have joy uh because i believe joy comes
[55:43] from the holy ghost and if you have the
[55:44] holy ghost you have joy
[55:46] and so too many today have not received
[55:48] the holy ghost they have had joy which
[55:51] is it's just a season of earthly joy but
[55:55] they've never received the joy that
[55:57] comes from the holy ghost and so today i
[56:00] just want to speak on a word of joy i
[56:03] want to start off and now you've never
[56:05] seen me before and brother jonathan was
[56:07] way too kind
[56:09] amen i felt like shrinking in the back
[56:11] after he said all those words
[56:13] amen i didn't come with a resume to get
[56:15] a job
[56:17] amen i came to preach the gospel
[56:19] amen and so tonight that's what i'm
[56:21] going to do and and i appreciate brother
[56:24] jonathan for saying all those kind of
[56:26] words god bless you but you don't know
[56:28] me and i just want to establish in your
[56:30] hearts as i preach to you these three
[56:33] services that that i believe the message
[56:35] of the hour with all my heart
[56:37] amen uh it's it's the only thing that's
[56:40] going to get us into a rapture
[56:42] and i heard our brother gerald he's
[56:43] speaking about brother branham and
[56:45] and how that he did not get the
[56:47] opportunity to come to newfoundland but
[56:49] the word surely did get to newfoundland
[56:51] and this evening we're we're here in
[56:53] this building and you are a living proof
[56:56] of the word of this hour that's still as
[56:59] real as it ever was
[57:01] and so this evening i want to start off
[57:03] like this just to make sure that we're
[57:05] all on the same page
[57:07] and brother brown speaks a message from
[57:09] jesus on the authority of the word he
[57:10] says the authority of god's word now
[57:14] every word
[57:15] of god is written sworn authority
[57:19] so what we're reading and what we're
[57:20] believing here today is under the
[57:22] authority of the word of god it's god's
[57:25] word
[57:26] to us in this time and this season and
[57:29] brother branham says it's the absolute
[57:32] right on uh right of the believer to
[57:34] accept
[57:35] this as the infallible truth and i say i
[57:38] do
[57:39] because it's god's word
[57:42] heavens and earth will pass away
[57:45] but my word friends this evening my word
[57:48] will never pass away that's the word of
[57:52] our lord jesus and that's the word that
[57:54] was spoken through the voice of our
[57:56] prophet god's word will never pass away
[57:59] saith the lord it must be fulfilled in
[58:04] its season
[58:05] and this hour we are in the season of
[58:08] the rapture
[58:09] we're in the seizing it's the
[58:11] culmination of all times and where all
[58:13] the mystery truths have revealed to the
[58:15] bride and it's an elisha ministry amen
[58:19] we've had an elijah
[58:20] but there's an elisha ministry and you
[58:23] the people of god sitting before me you
[58:26] are that bride's ministry that elisha
[58:28] ministry that's speaking the truth of
[58:31] god in its season
[58:34] we are living in bible times we're
[58:35] living in a time where bible is
[58:37] fulfilled and we're standing upon that
[58:40] word of god that liveth and abideth
[58:42] forever
[58:44] you know the prophet god would
[58:45] often quote a song
[58:47] that he appreciated that he loved and i
[58:50] love this song my
[58:51] my hope is built on nothing less
[58:55] then jesus blood and his righteousness
[58:59] i dare not trust the sweetest frame this
[59:02] evening we cannot trust upon man
[59:05] you can't trust upon me yet i will do
[59:08] the very best that i can do but you
[59:10] don't cannot trust on the sweetest frame
[59:13] but holy lean on
[59:16] jesus jesus name
[59:18] oh
[59:19] christ the solid rock i stand all other
[59:23] ground is seeking sand
[59:26] all other ground
[59:28] is sinking sand
[59:29] oh let me read one more verse because i
[59:31] love it so dearly when darkness hides
[59:34] his face
[59:35] i rest
[59:37] on his unchanging grace
[59:41] oh friends this evening i got an
[59:43] absolute how many's got an absolute
[59:46] it's his unchanging grace what he said
[59:50] will always be he said i am the same
[59:53] yesterday today and forever he's also
[59:56] said to his people i am god and i change
[59:59] not and so i hold on to that absolute
[1:00:03] that unchanging grace
[1:00:05] in every hide and stormy gale
[1:00:08] oh friends i was just tell brother
[1:00:09] jonathan took me and i we were looking
[1:00:11] there and we were seeing some of those
[1:00:12] star those winds blowing the waters and
[1:00:15] how they were building and splashing
[1:00:17] against the rocks sometimes it feels
[1:00:20] like our lives are in turmoil and
[1:00:22] there's a struggle and the gales of life
[1:00:24] are just pounding against but friends
[1:00:26] this evening no matter how high the
[1:00:29] stormy gale
[1:00:31] our anchor holds
[1:00:33] how many's got an anchor here tonight
[1:00:35] our anchor holds within the veil
[1:00:38] and the message brother branham says in
[1:00:40] satan's eden he says that's all i know
[1:00:43] to tell
[1:00:44] that's this bible i believe it with all
[1:00:47] my heart
[1:00:48] and you know all my heart it to be
[1:00:51] perfect unadulterated word of god
[1:00:54] by this i
[1:00:57] live and the church said
[1:00:59] we live by the word of god by this we
[1:01:02] live by this we stand
[1:01:06] on the infallible
[1:01:08] word of god
[1:01:10] and so this brings me to my thought this
[1:01:13] evening the infallible word of god says
[1:01:15] that we need to have righteousness
[1:01:19] we need to have peace
[1:01:22] and we need to have joy
[1:01:24] not just in this temporal life
[1:01:27] not just this life that we're kind of
[1:01:29] living and groping in and you know we're
[1:01:31] raising families then that's what god
[1:01:33] wants us to do we're working that's what
[1:01:34] god wants to do we come and we we we
[1:01:37] fellowship together but friends we need
[1:01:39] to have that righteousness peace and joy
[1:01:42] in the holy ghost
[1:01:44] in christ jesus the word in the zoe life
[1:01:48] in the logos of god that's where we find
[1:01:51] this righteousness
[1:01:53] we cannot be righteous on our own try it
[1:01:56] we cannot be but we need righteousness
[1:01:59] in the word of god
[1:02:01] and so we're going to look at this now
[1:02:03] this word on joy because i believe more
[1:02:06] than ever we need to have joy
[1:02:09] joy in the holy ghost
[1:02:12] the lamb's book of life now i'm going to
[1:02:14] quote a little bit tonight and i hope
[1:02:15] you don't mind that i do
[1:02:17] praise the lord because i can say it but
[1:02:19] if the prophet says it sounds even
[1:02:21] better
[1:02:22] and so the lamb's book of life in 1956
[1:02:27] our prophet said he says now watch
[1:02:30] the bible said that jesus the lamb was
[1:02:32] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:02:35] was ever laid oh
[1:02:38] i know i act funny up here
[1:02:40] but i feel glorious
[1:02:43] now i like that because i kind of feel
[1:02:45] in that stimulation of revelation just
[1:02:48] right now
[1:02:49] and you know something you know when
[1:02:50] when we get around god's word
[1:02:53] you know i feel like that little mouse
[1:02:54] story brother branham talks the cat is
[1:02:56] always chasing the mouse
[1:02:59] and you know i was a little felon and my
[1:03:01] parents they allow us to to look at some
[1:03:04] things called tom and jerry how many of
[1:03:05] us ever heard that and we see that you
[1:03:07] know that that tom and jerry was a cat
[1:03:10] in a mouse game all the time the cat
[1:03:12] chasing the mouse and there was tests
[1:03:14] and there's struggles and but you know
[1:03:16] something that i want to know the end of
[1:03:18] the book and then a book says the cap
[1:03:20] okay the cat is defeated and you know
[1:03:22] something i think about that that mouse
[1:03:24] cat and mouse game and how that that
[1:03:26] mouse is running and and you know he
[1:03:28] runs and runs and he runs on top of that
[1:03:30] vat you know the van of wine and he
[1:03:32] spins around there and he happens to
[1:03:34] fall into that wine how many remembers
[1:03:36] the story and he falls into that wine
[1:03:39] and you know he's been chased by that
[1:03:40] cat he's been a place of turmoil by that
[1:03:43] cat but when he falls into that wine and
[1:03:45] he picks himself up he looks around and
[1:03:48] now he's got a different opinion
[1:03:51] he's no longer thinking about how that
[1:03:54] cat's going to eat him for lunch finally
[1:03:56] he gets some some strength some some
[1:03:59] muscles something within him some
[1:04:00] stimulation of revelation with inside of
[1:04:03] him no matter how small he is he's
[1:04:06] willing to look at that cat and he's
[1:04:08] willing to say boo devil
[1:04:12] you've chased me long enough and he
[1:04:14] looked up and he looked and said now
[1:04:16] where is that cat
[1:04:18] and you know something believers with
[1:04:20] the joy of the holy ghost with the
[1:04:22] inside of them they come to that
[1:04:24] stimulation not of just some earthly
[1:04:26] something another wind or or something
[1:04:29] that they stingle and feel but it's the
[1:04:30] joy of the holy ghost that's down in the
[1:04:34] depths of
[1:04:36] our lives now brother branham says now i
[1:04:38] may look funny funny up here but i feel
[1:04:41] glorious he says jesus
[1:04:44] was slain before the world had a
[1:04:48] first speck of dirt laid
[1:04:50] jesus already was slain and i think
[1:04:53] about that for a moment because i look
[1:04:55] over at my life now did you know there's
[1:04:58] no perfect people that come to church
[1:05:01] we come to church so that we might
[1:05:03] become perfected
[1:05:05] and so we look at this and i think it's
[1:05:07] grand because
[1:05:09] jesus was slain before the foundation of
[1:05:12] the world for my sin for my affliction
[1:05:15] for what i've already done
[1:05:18] and here i'm thankful and this brings me
[1:05:20] great joy because you know friends our
[1:05:23] lord knows and took a picture of my
[1:05:25] beginning
[1:05:26] and he sees my ending and in between
[1:05:29] there his blood suffices for everything
[1:05:32] it emits every sin every shortcoming
[1:05:36] everything that i have ever done
[1:05:38] oh i'm thankful for the blood of jesus
[1:05:41] christ jesus was slain the very minute
[1:05:44] god spoke the word
[1:05:47] you were in his thoughts friends you're
[1:05:50] sitting here tonight listening to an
[1:05:52] insignificant preacher but through the
[1:05:55] mind of god he knew exactly that you
[1:05:58] would be here today on november 12th to
[1:06:01] worship god with spirit and truth and
[1:06:03] then brother branham makes a statement
[1:06:05] and he says and many have spoken this
[1:06:07] before but brother brown says god
[1:06:08] already spoke it he says to the believer
[1:06:10] he says have you got your joy shoes on
[1:06:14] have you heard that before have you got
[1:06:16] your joy you know brother dwayne lawson
[1:06:18] he was preaching up in edmonton and he
[1:06:20] kind of read this quote and he coined
[1:06:22] the phrase for all of us you say have
[1:06:24] you got your joy shoes on and today we
[1:06:26] want to worship him in joy
[1:06:29] we've got our shoes on you know a
[1:06:31] a basketball player or a volleyball
[1:06:33] player or somebody like that they put a
[1:06:35] lot of confidence in their shoes did you
[1:06:38] know that
[1:06:39] how they've got all kinds of shoes and
[1:06:41] all kinds of things and they think that
[1:06:43] it makes them play better
[1:06:45] you know i have a daughter who who likes
[1:06:47] volleyball quite a bit
[1:06:49] and she's very good at it and
[1:06:51] and uh you know something she played at
[1:06:53] a very high level and and not to give
[1:06:55] any glory to the sport but to the glory
[1:06:57] of god she would like these shoes and
[1:06:59] she she thought her shoes did a good job
[1:07:02] in her playing and she'd buy all kinds
[1:07:04] of expensive shoes but friends this
[1:07:06] evening it's it's not about natural
[1:07:07] shoes
[1:07:09] it's about our spiritual and our feet
[1:07:11] are shod
[1:07:13] with the joy of the lord that wherever
[1:07:15] we go
[1:07:17] that we show forth the grace of jesus
[1:07:19] christ the joy of the lord
[1:07:21] how many knows that the joy of the lord
[1:07:23] is higher
[1:07:24] come on you can do that better the joy
[1:07:26] of the lord is our amenity truly is our
[1:07:30] strength we're not looking at our
[1:07:32] muscles ourselves boy somewhere you're

[1:08:04] of satan's eden the taskmaster has
[1:08:08] whipped us he has tried to put us in
[1:08:10] bondage but friends there has become a
[1:08:13] voice in our age a trumpet has sounded
[1:08:16] and it's a time of jubilee
[1:08:20] it is the rising of the sun johnny crow
[1:08:23] you are no longer tied down but you're
[1:08:26] free the word has made you free
[1:08:31] oh
[1:08:31] friends i'm so happy that i serve a god
[1:08:34] that that gave us dynamics and mechanics
[1:08:37] together
[1:08:38] i'm a god that just didn't want to just
[1:08:40] let's live by intellectualism and i'm
[1:08:42] glad that he just didn't want us to live
[1:08:44] by every sort of move of wind but he
[1:08:45] wanted us to have the full package
[1:08:49] he want us to live in spirit and in
[1:08:52] truth
[1:08:54] hallelujah spirit and truth and so this
[1:08:56] is the year of jubilee we are saved we
[1:09:00] are free and we are secured
[1:09:04] we're secured in christ jesus now i'm
[1:09:07] giving you reasons for you to express
[1:09:09] your joy this evening and i'm not afraid
[1:09:12] if you get up and wave your arms and
[1:09:15] shout hallelujah because we have a
[1:09:18] reason to praise him hallelujah you know
[1:09:21] one time i remember the prophet he was
[1:09:23] testifying there of a sister
[1:09:25] who who was he was preaching and she she
[1:09:27] just felt the anointing of the word and
[1:09:29] felt so happy and she came to brother
[1:09:31] branham after and said brother i just
[1:09:33] felt like getting up and shouting
[1:09:35] hallelujah and brother branham said why
[1:09:37] didn't you do it
[1:09:39] friends we got the opportunity we take
[1:09:42] in this time aside to give god all the
[1:09:45] praise
[1:09:46] so we're secured in christ
[1:09:48] i want you to notice when the word came
[1:09:51] and and and came into the womb of your
[1:09:54] being into the womb of your heart your
[1:09:56] womb is sealed
[1:09:58] and there is nothing that satan can do
[1:10:01] to destroy it to ruin it friends you are
[1:10:05] sealed god has a there's an eternal
[1:10:08] security in christ jesus if the word is
[1:10:11] planted in the womb of your being amen
[1:10:15] in blasphemous names brother branham
[1:10:17] said in 1962 he said and god
[1:10:20] has adopted you
[1:10:22] and sealed you by the holy ghost into
[1:10:26] his kingdom
[1:10:27] and there's no getting out of it i say
[1:10:29] hallelujah
[1:10:31] you are eternally
[1:10:34] secure
[1:10:35] hallelujah and they ask the people do
[1:10:37] you believe it and we see we believe
[1:10:40] and so we can say with brother adams yes
[1:10:43] i look funny
[1:10:45] and i am willing to be an audible for
[1:10:47] jesus christ
[1:10:49] hallelujah i'm willing just like you to
[1:10:51] come to church
[1:10:52] regardless of what happens or what
[1:10:54] people say or the feeling that people
[1:10:56] might have in this time of the season
[1:10:58] under all this medical problem i am
[1:11:00] willing to say i will stand out for
[1:11:03] jesus christ i'll come to the house of
[1:11:06] god i will give him praise i will honor
[1:11:09] what is to caesar but to god what is god
[1:11:12] and god deserves
[1:11:16] god deserves my praise
[1:11:20] oh
[1:11:21] now we tend to think of happiness when
[1:11:23] we think about happiness and we we think
[1:11:26] and tend to equate and put those things
[1:11:28] happiness and joy together oh i'm so
[1:11:30] happy or i i and we say i am so joyful
[1:11:34] and i want you to notice that there
[1:11:35] they're two different ideas
[1:11:38] because they they spring up from
[1:11:40] different sources
[1:11:41] one says i'm happy and the other says
[1:11:43] i'm joyful.
[1:11:45] one comes from the world
[1:11:47] around us
[1:11:49] you know and the and there's another one
[1:11:51] that you see the others originately
[1:11:53] directly from the spirit of god so the
[1:11:55] world around us says i am so happy kind
[1:11:59] of like you know it's my birthday
[1:12:01] right and and and my wife you know gave
[1:12:04] me a wonderful present now now my wife
[1:12:07] and i have been married now 25 years
[1:12:10] and it's not been very long comparing to
[1:12:12] some and praise the lord but but i think
[1:12:15] it's a milestone
[1:12:17] she she got to live with me for all
[1:12:19] these years and she made it through
[1:12:22] praise the lord but you know funny thing
[1:12:23] is uh she gave me a gift and i
[1:12:26] shamefully uh took her to costco we've
[1:12:28] got costco there and i told her to hold
[1:12:31] a bunch of flowers and i took a picture
[1:12:32] and i said well there honey i gave you
[1:12:34] flowers
[1:12:36] uh you know something uh but she
[1:12:38] deserves more than that but she was so
[1:12:40] kind and she gave me are you coping and
[1:12:42] they say well i i'm so thankful that my
[1:12:44] husband my wife my child my grandparent
[1:12:47] they're on the other side
[1:12:50] and they say well are you are you coping
[1:12:52] with your sadness and you say no i have
[1:12:55] a joy
[1:12:56] now the world doesn't understand that
[1:13:00] they have no understanding of that
[1:13:02] because they're depending their
[1:13:04] happiness or their joy on the things
[1:13:07] that are surrounding us we are depending
[1:13:09] our joy upon a supernatural
[1:13:13] word that comes from the god that says
[1:13:15] we have an eternal rest
[1:13:18] right and so there is a great big
[1:13:20] difference between it all my soul leaps
[1:13:24] within me
[1:13:25] my heart spins with gladness
[1:13:28] the new testament word of gladness means
[1:13:30] a bliss of celebration my heart is
[1:13:33] overwhelmed with joy and pleasure why
[1:13:37] because the holy ghost
[1:13:39] that life god's very own life is in my
[1:13:43] being bubbling up to make me joyful
[1:13:47] now let me give you an example from the
[1:13:49] prophet the prophet god said about the
[1:13:51] stream of water and he and he got next
[1:13:54] to that water he says water
[1:13:56] what makes you so happy why are you so
[1:14:00] joyful he said because the rabbit comes
[1:14:03] and drinks from you oh that is wonderful
[1:14:05] no it's not the rabbit is it because the
[1:14:08] deer comes no that's not is it because
[1:14:11] no it's because something is pushing and
[1:14:15] bubbling on the inside of me
[1:14:18] and this word that we're believing
[1:14:21] that's right
[1:14:22] this part of god that we're believing is
[1:14:25] what brings joy within outside our lives
[1:14:30] now i've sat many times just like you
[1:14:32] and and the pastor's been preaching and
[1:14:35] i'm listening to the word of god and
[1:14:37] it's coming and it's coming so fresh and
[1:14:39] i begin to experience something that
[1:14:41] comes down on the inside of me now i
[1:14:43] can't explain it but you understand
[1:14:45] because you're believers
[1:14:47] if we were trying to explain this
[1:14:49] outside to the world around us they
[1:14:51] would call us crazy and i say i'm acting
[1:14:54] funny yes but i i am doing it because of
[1:14:56] jesus christ and so i sit there and i
[1:14:59] listen to the words of the pastors he's
[1:15:01] beginning to bring the word and all of a
[1:15:03] sudden something begins to churn inside
[1:15:05] me
[1:15:06] and it begins to move inside of me
[1:15:09] and
[1:15:10] and this stirring begins to develop in
[1:15:12] such a way that i can't help but express
[1:15:16] myself
[1:15:17] now it's not just my natural feelings
[1:15:19] and the person who i am and my
[1:15:21] boisterous nature that's calling up no
[1:15:24] something on the inside
[1:15:27] of the inside is moving me
[1:15:30] now there's one thing when the music
[1:15:31] plays like today and we clap and rejoice
[1:15:34] and we praise and we get joyful and but
[1:15:36] there's something else when the inside
[1:15:39] of the inside begins to rejoice and you
[1:15:42] don't know why you're crying
[1:15:45] oh one time i sat in a meeting it was so
[1:15:47] strong i don't know if you know our
[1:15:48] brother stephen francis i believe he's
[1:15:50] went on to be with the lord but he was
[1:15:52] preaching daryl's in toronto and he was
[1:15:54] preaching special meetings there for
[1:15:56] brother danko and i and i was sitting
[1:15:57] and i had led some songs for the meeting
[1:15:59] and i was sitting there in the pew and
[1:16:01] he began to preach now it was a good
[1:16:04] message but it wasn't a message where we
[1:16:06] would click our heels and shout out
[1:16:09] and you know and all this kind of
[1:16:11] wonderful expressions we like in the
[1:16:13] psalm it was a solemn a word of god to
[1:16:16] the people but exactly what i'm
[1:16:18] expressing you today something on the
[1:16:21] inside begin to erupt
[1:16:23] and i begin to and that you can identify
[1:16:25] with them tonight my experience is your
[1:16:27] experience we all have come to this
[1:16:29] place where the word of god is moving
[1:16:31] within our being and before you know it
[1:16:33] tears are flowing
[1:16:35] and the joy comes out and i'm shouting
[1:16:37] hallelujah beyond what i would do even
[1:16:40] as a natural person
[1:16:42] it's because the word of god become a
[1:16:46] reality within my being and i could not
[1:16:50] contain the joy of the holy ghost that's
[1:16:54] coming out of my very being
[1:16:56] you know i want you to notice now joy
[1:16:59] joy of the holy ghost takes a journey
[1:17:02] now when you're born by the spirit of
[1:17:04] god into the family of god you're born
[1:17:06] with all the the characteristics of god
[1:17:10] you're born with the full patch i've
[1:17:12] seen i love this i see the statue of the
[1:17:14] perfect man standing behind me but i
[1:17:16] want you know all those things all those
[1:17:19] faith and virtue and knowledge and all
[1:17:22] those things of god those seven virtues
[1:17:24] of god they were given to you at your
[1:17:26] birth
[1:17:28] but you have to come into the
[1:17:30] understanding into the knowledge not by
[1:17:32] now intellectualism but by the knowledge
[1:17:34] of the holy ghost that you have faith
[1:17:37] within your life
[1:17:39] that you have dunamis power in your life
[1:17:42] that you have knowledge not earthly
[1:17:44] knowledge but you have the knowledge and
[1:17:46] the wisdom that comes from god you've
[1:17:48] got temperance not just you know
[1:17:50] temperate for one another that allows
[1:17:52] you to stand at the bank and wait with
[1:17:54] patience for within the teller no a
[1:17:56] godly temperance with inside of you you
[1:17:59] have those virtues already you have a
[1:18:01] god beloved with inside it's capstone
[1:18:04] ministry this is the word we're
[1:18:06] preaching tonight that's right
[1:18:08] this is the word in its fullness and the
[1:18:12] capstone ministry of is amongst the
[1:18:14] people the gopis love of god
[1:18:17] the joy of god in your being he's here
[1:18:19] tonight
[1:18:21] but you have to recognize that you got
[1:18:23] that all at your birth
[1:18:25] and it takes a journey amen amen i like
[1:18:29] to say it like this when you're when
[1:18:30] you're uh born into the kingdom of god
[1:18:33] you're a baby
[1:18:34] okay you're just a little infant in the
[1:18:36] arm and you before you know it god feeds
[1:18:38] you
[1:18:39] and god waters you so to speak and god
[1:18:42] revelates you gives you of his word and
[1:18:45] you begin to grow and as you begin to
[1:18:48] grow it's a journey it's not always easy
[1:18:51] and god allows temptation to come your
[1:18:53] way trials to come away what it's all
[1:18:56] for your perfection
[1:18:58] so joy it takes a journey to receive all
[1:19:02] that has god has for you but you've
[1:19:04] received it already at your birth in
[1:19:08] psalms chapter 30 are you still okay
[1:19:10] jesus
[1:19:11] amen in psalms chapter 30 verse 5
[1:19:14] the psalmist he writes
[1:19:16] weeping may endure for a night
[1:19:20] but joy amen cometh in the morning
[1:19:24] so there are seasons there's things that
[1:19:26] were going in our life but i want you to
[1:19:28] know the joy of the lord never leaves
[1:19:31] you
[1:19:32] just the same as the word of god never
[1:19:34] leaves you it's always there it's
[1:19:37] persistence because it is zoe's life it
[1:19:40] is joy of the holy ghost
[1:19:43] joy comes in the morning suggesting that
[1:19:46] after all our struggles
[1:19:49] all of our tests there are it's a new
[1:19:51] day it's a new dawn it's a new spring
[1:19:55] praise the name of the lord
[1:19:57] i am thankful for newness
[1:20:00] oh i'm thankful for newness
[1:20:03] now i i don't i don't grow i'm not a
[1:20:05] farmer i'm not a vine keeper but i
[1:20:08] understand that there's special
[1:20:10] attention that needs to be taken when
[1:20:12] you grow grapes
[1:20:13] it takes time
[1:20:16] it takes diligence
[1:20:18] it takes patience
[1:20:20] it takes hard work to make a grapevine
[1:20:23] produce fruit
[1:20:25] so fruit is not
[1:20:27] instantaneous
[1:20:30] okay uh you know there's a lot of
[1:20:32] something that that goes on with it it's
[1:20:34] it's it's just not oh i plant it walk
[1:20:36] away and and to and to you know the next
[1:20:39] few months all of a sudden i'll have a
[1:20:40] bushel of grapes
[1:20:42] it takes time
[1:20:44] okay it takes diligence you know where
[1:20:46] i'm going with this it takes patience
[1:20:49] and so for you to receive more of the
[1:20:52] word which we've already established is
[1:20:54] our joy
[1:20:55] it in order to receive more revelation
[1:20:57] from god it takes us as believers
[1:21:01] time
[1:21:03] time how time in the word of god
[1:21:06] time to meditate
[1:21:09] upon the word of god not just reading a
[1:21:11] a portion of scripture as we fly out of
[1:21:14] the house in the morning and return in
[1:21:17] the evening it takes us to have a
[1:21:19] thought a meditation around the word of
[1:21:23] god
[1:21:24] it takes diligence
[1:21:26] it you know you you've got to be
[1:21:28] diligent you have to be you have to have
[1:21:30] a routine you have to have a a habit
[1:21:34] amen amen around the word of god
[1:21:37] okay you you have to subject this flesh
[1:21:42] to the will of god
[1:21:45] you see you have a part to play in this
[1:21:47] if you want the joy of the holy ghost
[1:21:49] you want the peace that passes all
[1:21:51] understanding you want to have
[1:21:53] righteousness live out in your life
[1:21:56] friends you need to have some diligence
[1:21:59] and you need to wait upon the lord
[1:22:02] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:22:05] their strength
[1:22:06] they shall mount up with eagles we know
[1:22:08] we like to fly in the heavenlies
[1:22:11] we like to soar our wing
[1:22:13] the wings of the eagles but friends it
[1:22:15] takes us learning patience
[1:22:19] humbling ourself before the lord to make
[1:22:22] this fruit come about but now
[1:22:24] you're going to get some weather in your
[1:22:25] life
[1:22:27] some undesirable weather brother geralt
[1:22:30] and it's going to flow into our and
[1:22:32] we're and we're saying whoa hold back
[1:22:35] the snow the storms okay we were talking
[1:22:38] with brother jonathan about a great big
[1:22:40] snowstorm that happened some years ago
[1:22:42] here and you think he called it snow
[1:22:44] storm snow
[1:22:46] snowmageddon
[1:22:48] you might have a snowmageddon in your
[1:22:50] life
[1:22:52] you might feel like your truck has got
[1:22:54] six feet of snow on top like we talked
[1:22:56] to this you might feel like you're never
[1:22:58] going to get out of this situation
[1:23:01] i want to tell you we believe in a god
[1:23:03] of the impossibilities he'll get you out
[1:23:05] of that storm if you'll hold on
[1:23:08] bad weather
[1:23:10] does not cause a christian to move away
[1:23:13] out of the presence of god
[1:23:15] bad weather in our life causes us to
[1:23:18] move closer
[1:23:21] closer to god
[1:23:23] brother brandon preached a whole message
[1:23:24] on desperation yes think about that now
[1:23:27] for a sense friends if we could come to
[1:23:29] a place where we didn't have to go
[1:23:31] through desperations and we were just
[1:23:32] yielding to god we would live these
[1:23:34] amazing year victorious lives but being
[1:23:36] in this human life being in this human
[1:23:38] body god already knew he had to put us
[1:23:41] in situations where there's weather and
[1:23:44] there's bugs and there's weeds and
[1:23:46] there's poor and there's a neglect of
[1:23:49] spirit there's all this coming in your
[1:23:50] way to cause you some hindrances why to
[1:23:54] get you closer to him
[1:23:57] the whole purpose of all of this is that
[1:24:00] we come back into fellowship with god
[1:24:05] you are no longer called church you are
[1:24:08] called bride and the bride of jesus
[1:24:11] christ walks with christ in the cool of
[1:24:14] the evening speaking with him in
[1:24:16] fellowship like they had back at the
[1:24:18] garden of eden
[1:24:20] there is no other place that fulfills
[1:24:23] the joy like that place in the cool of
[1:24:26] the evening
[1:24:27] with almighty
[1:24:28] god so
[1:24:31] tests are inevitable
[1:24:33] bugs in our life how we don't like them
[1:24:35] they're inevitable but we are overcomers
[1:24:38] through christ jesus we can face it we
[1:24:41] can face the storms
[1:24:43] listen covet this season of code for the
[1:24:45] last two years has put a lot of pressure
[1:24:48] on people
[1:24:51] oh i understand that this is meetings
[1:24:53] that you haven't had for two years to
[1:24:56] gather and have a special meeting and so
[1:24:58] forth that's pressure
[1:25:00] amen and then not knowing from sunday to
[1:25:02] sunday whether or not you're able to
[1:25:04] gather that is pressure then looking at
[1:25:07] our friends and even some of our loved
[1:25:09] ones that have sort of turned their back
[1:25:11] on the truth because of the pressures
[1:25:13] or people fighting against one another
[1:25:15] because they're vaccinated or not
[1:25:17] vaccinated this is precious
[1:25:20] but the children of god do not buckle
[1:25:23] under these pressures because they're
[1:25:26] hidden in the rock
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:30] these are not just cliche words that we
[1:25:32] use all the time friends this is a fact
[1:25:35] we are hidden in the rock which is
[1:25:38] christ jesus
[1:25:40] but i want you to notice you cannot
[1:25:42] manifest manufacture any of the joy of
[1:25:46] the lord on your own you cannot manifest
[1:25:48] any peace or anything of this nature you
[1:25:52] need to rely upon god
[1:25:55] you can't do it by yourself
[1:25:58] so if we want to see
[1:26:00] his fruit ripen in our lives then what
[1:26:03] we need to do is press in to the holy
[1:26:06] spirit when i say press into the holy
[1:26:09] spirit we're not pressing saying the
[1:26:11] holy spirit and then we're pressing into
[1:26:12] god the father and then we're pressing
[1:26:14] it no he's the same person
[1:26:17] he is the word
[1:26:19] so don't get confused when we say the
[1:26:21] holy ghost and say while i'm pressing
[1:26:23] the holy ghost and i'm believing the
[1:26:24] word and trying to make him two separate
[1:26:26] things it is the same one amen and we're
[1:26:30] pressing into his word and we're pruning
[1:26:34] away all the things that are hindering
[1:26:37] us
[1:26:38] now you look at our lives and you look
[1:26:40] at individually in your life and you see
[1:26:42] all these things are before you we need
[1:26:45] to prune away all the excess
[1:26:49] that does not belong in our christian
[1:26:52] life
[1:26:53] i want you to notice when elijah
[1:26:56] when he went up in the chariot and his
[1:26:58] and his garment fell down elisha had to
[1:27:01] pick up that garment and he had to put
[1:27:03] it on isn't that right
[1:27:05] it had to fit him correctly now elisha
[1:27:08] couldn't go to the tailor and say you
[1:27:10] know something i need it taken in over
[1:27:12] here
[1:27:13] or i've expanded i'm a little bit larger
[1:27:15] than elijah so i i i need in my ministry
[1:27:19] i need it to be tailored
[1:27:21] it was not the way he had to wear the
[1:27:24] garment
[1:27:25] as the garment fit
[1:27:27] and the word of god has to fit us this
[1:27:31] holy ghost life in order to bring us
[1:27:33] this joy that we're talking about that
[1:27:34] gives us strength has to fit us exactly
[1:27:38] as god intended for us to have it fit
[1:27:42] so you can't trim it here a little and a
[1:27:44] little bit there and make it fit where
[1:27:46] you think you like it to fit and live
[1:27:47] the gospel of here the way you like it
[1:27:49] god has said take the book eat the book
[1:27:53] let it become part of you and then when
[1:27:55] it becomes part of you then it becomes
[1:27:57] your
[1:27:58] strength to war against the enemy so
[1:28:01] don't try to snip the word off here
[1:28:04] there snip away the worlds
[1:28:08] take those things out out of you that's
[1:28:10] with you in their life get them out of
[1:28:12] your life
[1:28:13] now i i want to speak in just a moment
[1:28:15] here about things that that cause our
[1:28:18] joy
[1:28:20] to to to be lessened
[1:28:22] and i'd like them to to speak of it as
[1:28:24] they're called joy busters okay they
[1:28:27] they destroy your joy
[1:28:30] now in galatians chapter 4 verse 5 15 a
[1:28:34] portion of scripture it says
[1:28:36] where is the blessedness of the
[1:28:38] blessedness yes
[1:28:40] you speak of so the question is is where
[1:28:43] is this blessedness
[1:28:44] where is the joy that you're talking
[1:28:46] about where's this fulfillment of god's
[1:28:49] life with inside of you and that's the
[1:28:50] question i want to ask you today where
[1:28:52] is your joy
[1:28:54] because it should be oh as first fruits
[1:28:57] before you
[1:28:58] your life should thunder with the holy
[1:29:01] ghost in it
[1:29:02] when you go down to the supermarket okay
[1:29:05] your life should express the joy of
[1:29:07] christ your life should express the word
[1:29:10] in fact people should look at you and
[1:29:12] say who is that person
[1:29:14] they walk with that head hive remember
[1:29:16] remembers the story of of that that that
[1:29:19] that plantation there and they were
[1:29:21] looking there a man was wanting to buy
[1:29:23] another fellow in that time you know
[1:29:25] with slavery and there was that man that
[1:29:27] walked with his head higher than the
[1:29:28] rest and he said i'd like to buy that
[1:29:30] felon and he said well he's not for sale
[1:29:32] well why i'd like why is he not for sale
[1:29:34] i look how he walks and how he presents
[1:29:36] himself is he somebody special and he
[1:29:38] said no he's just like everybody else
[1:29:42] but
[1:29:43] he's a son of a king where he comes from
[1:29:46] and friends that's how we ought to walk
[1:29:48] okay we're doing our jobs and we're out
[1:29:51] there and in the industrial world or
[1:29:53] wherever you you look for for a job you
[1:29:57] should walk as christ walk
[1:30:00] hallelujah you should walk with this
[1:30:03] extra click in your heel
[1:30:05] you should come on the job ready to work
[1:30:08] right men we work the bible says learn
[1:30:11] from the aunt jesus sluggard
[1:30:13] and we work with the sweat of our brow
[1:30:16] right to bring a
[1:30:17] a loaf back home for our families when
[1:30:19] we do it in joy
[1:30:22] enjoy this world so we can buy christmas
[1:30:24] gifts and we can buy thanksgiving
[1:30:26] presents and one birthday no that's not
[1:30:28] his we want to present ourselves with
[1:30:30] the joy of the lord
[1:30:34] come on friends we are testimonies
[1:30:38] and when we walk in this world our lives
[1:30:41] are preaching
[1:30:43] your life is thundering
[1:30:46] what do you want us you want to get that
[1:30:47] last soul let your life speak of the joy
[1:30:51] of the lord so where is this joy it's in
[1:30:55] our hearts but there's friends there's
[1:30:56] things in our lives
[1:30:58] that cause us
[1:31:00] to to lack in the joy that we really
[1:31:03] should have unfold in our lives
[1:31:05] amen and so i hope you bear with me just
[1:31:08] a moment
[1:31:09] now i'm not made to pinch anybody or
[1:31:11] prick anybody hurt anybody today but
[1:31:14] hold on to your seat now i believe in a
[1:31:15] positive gospel
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:18] all right and so now remember
[1:31:21] when god speaks to us it's positive
[1:31:24] now if god meant negativity towards us
[1:31:27] he would say as he did with
[1:31:30] jacob and esau
[1:31:32] he would say jacob have i loved and esau
[1:31:35] have i hated you see god doesn't mince
[1:31:37] his words he just says it i hate esau
[1:31:40] so if we're going to preach a negative
[1:31:42] gospel gospel we'd say god just hates
[1:31:44] you
[1:31:47] right
[1:31:48] but we're preaching the gospel that says
[1:31:49] god loves you
[1:31:51] and god says those that are my children
[1:31:53] i chasten
[1:31:55] you know i hated getting a spanking when
[1:31:57] i was like you know young people you
[1:31:59] listen to this
[1:32:00] i hated it
[1:32:01] so what i did often times and sorry for
[1:32:03] deviating but this is just for the young
[1:32:05] people just a moment you know what i did
[1:32:07] i i i went and i put on like ten pairs
[1:32:09] of underpants
[1:32:12] and then i went and obviously i thought
[1:32:14] my dad would never recognize my backside
[1:32:16] was twice the size it ever was
[1:32:19] but hang on a second that was that was
[1:32:21] all right because i thought i was going
[1:32:22] to cheat
[1:32:24] okay the experience of the fifa ministry
[1:32:26] on the seat of understanding
[1:32:30] right but nevertheless
[1:32:33] my father's spanking
[1:32:36] okay
[1:32:37] it was good for me
[1:32:39] believe it or not i never played with
[1:32:41] fire again
[1:32:43] and when those trees were high and the
[1:32:45] wind was going i never climbed to the
[1:32:47] top because i received some chastening i
[1:32:50] do see some understanding that that was
[1:32:52] not good for the person i was going to
[1:32:55] become
[1:32:56] and so the positive gospel we believe
[1:32:58] god chastens he says things to us and he
[1:33:00] tells us it's not legalism it is the
[1:33:03] word of god to us and we say yes lord
[1:33:06] because we want to walk in your
[1:33:08] fulfillment of joy
[1:33:10] amen
[1:33:12] so here we go what destroys your joy
[1:33:15] what causes you to have a a lack of joy
[1:33:17] now i'm now friends remember you cannot
[1:33:20] lose the the life of god with inside you
[1:33:23] what causes you to get to a place where
[1:33:25] you're cooled off shall to speak or
[1:33:28] backslidden
[1:33:30] you always have the holy spirit inside
[1:33:32] of you if you're sealed then you have it
[1:33:34] but how many has ever felt that place of
[1:33:36] their life was just cool
[1:33:40] you go to pray
[1:33:41] and you pray and it seems like the
[1:33:42] heavens are brass
[1:33:44] hello is anybody is everybody hello
[1:33:48] are you
[1:33:48] there come on that's where we are
[1:33:52] so sometimes there are things in our
[1:33:54] lives that cause us to to be in this
[1:33:56] situation
[1:33:57] and i want you to tell you it's one of
[1:33:59] them is unsatisfied
[1:34:02] expectations
[1:34:04] and i like to call it discontentment
[1:34:08] now think about just for a moment
[1:34:10] if you're discontent
[1:34:12] you see the spirit of discontentment
[1:34:15] robs us believers today to receive real
[1:34:19] joy
[1:34:20] we get discontent we get discontent
[1:34:22] around us the things that are in our
[1:34:23] life
[1:34:24] now i want you to notice ever since from
[1:34:26] the beginning of time there's been
[1:34:28] always someone and somebody somewhere
[1:34:31] that's been unhappy
[1:34:34] well looking for a moment let's start in
[1:34:35] heaven lucifer
[1:34:38] curated amongst all the angelic beings
[1:34:41] to be the brightest
[1:34:44] to be the song leader of heaven with the
[1:34:46] most beautiful voice
[1:34:48] everybody looked oh lucifer's son of the
[1:34:51] morning
[1:34:52] but what was his problem
[1:34:54] discontentment
[1:34:56] and pride
[1:34:57] that's right he was discontent to be the
[1:35:00] very thing god created him to be he
[1:35:03] wanted to be
[1:35:04] equal with god and his discontentment
[1:35:07] caused him to lead rebellion in heaven
[1:35:11] it caused discord amongst all the under
[1:35:14] other angels he was he was discontent
[1:35:17] that he was made the way he was he
[1:35:19] wanted to be equal with god
[1:35:22] amen now think in your life
[1:35:25] the places you've been
[1:35:27] the things that you've done
[1:35:29] and all of a sudden you get discontent
[1:35:33] we see also
[1:35:35] then we see in the heart of eve
[1:35:38] you know eve was walking and with adam
[1:35:40] and they were content walking and
[1:35:42] walking
[1:35:43] and as they walked
[1:35:46] you know we see that serpent influenced
[1:35:47] by the enemy
[1:35:49] he he gets her aside and he begins to
[1:35:53] preach to her
[1:35:54] now he he doesn't leave the word of god
[1:35:57] out as we know it
[1:35:58] he twists the truth of the word of god
[1:36:01] and he begins to talk to her
[1:36:03] and you know no doubt now we don't read
[1:36:05] this from scripture but just take an
[1:36:07] imagination trip with me for just a
[1:36:09] moment no doubt
[1:36:10] there were other animals in the garden
[1:36:13] that were producing life
[1:36:15] and she saw it and she had these
[1:36:17] instincts okay to be a mother
[1:36:21] but how it was to come was by perfection
[1:36:24] by the spoken word of god that was god's
[1:36:28] provided way that was the perfect will
[1:36:30] of god
[1:36:32] god loudout permissive will but there
[1:36:34] was a perfect will of god but you know
[1:36:37] what got her thinking
[1:36:39] was the word that was sown from the
[1:36:41] serpent through from the voice of satan
[1:36:44] to discontent her amen
[1:36:47] in the position that she was in
[1:36:51] now i want you to notice friends these
[1:36:53] are seeds
[1:36:56] seeds that are sown
[1:36:58] and amongst the people the bride of
[1:37:00] christ we are people that know that we
[1:37:03] are we're moving towards a celestial
[1:37:06] city where our builder and maker is god
[1:37:08] but yet we get tied up amongst ourselves
[1:37:13] and we start talking and we start
[1:37:15] bickering and we and before you know it
[1:37:18] we begin to sow words seeds words our
[1:37:21] seeds and we sow them and sow them and
[1:37:24] we don't even mean to sow them in the
[1:37:27] way we do we want it to be to be
[1:37:29] positive creatures but yet they come out
[1:37:32] negative and before you know it what
[1:37:34] happens discontentment
[1:37:38] begins to breed
[1:37:40] amongst believers
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:45] humanly i want you to notice this
[1:37:49] humanly we often say you know
[1:37:52] i want how many has ever heard this as
[1:37:54] young people i wish i was older
[1:37:57] right you're discontent to be young
[1:38:00] and then the older people say you know
[1:38:01] what i just wish i was younger
[1:38:05] how many knows that
[1:38:08] you know
[1:38:10] if it's something small
[1:38:12] we're saying you know i wish it was
[1:38:14] bigger you know i
[1:38:16] well i like boats and so we were driving
[1:38:18] and it's in all these boats you know
[1:38:21] and uh and and when i was a youngster
[1:38:23] you know my daddy was so nice he bought
[1:38:24] me a four foot a 14 foot aluminum boat
[1:38:27] with a small seven horse engine on the
[1:38:30] back
[1:38:30] and i would drive that thing around and
[1:38:32] i had such happiness
[1:38:34] but you know what broad bridge begin to
[1:38:36] breed uh uh discontentment is when my
[1:38:39] friends showed up
[1:38:41] in something a little bit larger
[1:38:43] and a lot bigger and a lot of happier
[1:38:46] and you know what we do we begin like
[1:38:47] the prophets of god says we begin
[1:38:50] to compare with one another like the
[1:38:53] joneses
[1:38:54] oh if we just had a bigger church
[1:38:59] oh if we just had more musicians oh if
[1:39:02] we could just have more money we could
[1:39:04] do more outreach and before you know it
[1:39:06] it's more and more and more and more and
[1:39:08] it begins to breed
[1:39:10] discontent amongst the people of god
[1:39:14] where we ought to be fully content with
[1:39:17] the now
[1:39:18] the hear
[1:39:19] and the presence of what god is doing in
[1:39:23] our
[1:39:24] midst because he's in our midst
[1:39:28] right we come to church to meet with him
[1:39:31] we we fellowship in our homes to meet
[1:39:33] with him when we fellowship with one
[1:39:35] another it's to meet with him
[1:39:38] we're meeting with god amen oh
[1:39:42] so we have this in the natural we have
[1:39:44] these things where we get in a place of
[1:39:46] discontentment and we let them float
[1:39:48] into our spiritual lives
[1:39:51] we are foolish that way as natural
[1:39:53] creatures
[1:39:54] but let us not be foolish that way as
[1:39:57] spiritual christians jesus
[1:40:00] you know it's good in our lives now i
[1:40:01] want to point this a balance it's good
[1:40:03] to want to strive
[1:40:06] you know you you want to do well in
[1:40:07] school okay
[1:40:09] and sometimes you get a bad mark on your
[1:40:11] examination or you get a on your job you
[1:40:14] get a a review that's not so good and
[1:40:16] you're a little bit discontent about
[1:40:18] what happened those things in the
[1:40:20] natural are good they push you forward
[1:40:22] and those are like trials and tests
[1:40:24] don't be discontented in what god gives
[1:40:25] you
[1:40:27] be happy in what god gives you it might
[1:40:30] be for your edification for your
[1:40:31] building up for you to become a greater
[1:40:35] son and daughter of god which he
[1:40:37] intended so there is a balance in all
[1:40:38] things but yet we are not allow satan to
[1:40:42] breed in our minds
[1:40:44] with discontentment
[1:40:46] i want you to notice that we are
[1:40:48] we are this being
[1:40:50] that's got a mind a body
[1:40:52] all right a spirit
[1:40:54] and a soul
[1:40:56] and on the inside of the inside is where
[1:40:58] god lives
[1:41:00] and that is the purity of god now we
[1:41:02] have to put our our spirit and our soul
[1:41:06] into subjection to god's word when we do
[1:41:09] that then satan can't come in and
[1:41:12] disrupt disrupt disrupt us with these
[1:41:15] discontentments
[1:41:18] that tried to easily beset us
[1:41:22] how many has ever heard of the word envy
[1:41:26] uh envy breeds discontentment
[1:41:30] the
[1:41:30] inability to rejoice at the success of
[1:41:34] others
[1:41:36] you know
[1:41:37] many times we look at somebody gets
[1:41:38] something bigger better shinier and we
[1:41:40] look and we say oh
[1:41:42] i wish i had that
[1:41:44] and we may not be silly enough to say
[1:41:45] that with our with our natural voices
[1:41:48] right but the inside goes man i really
[1:41:50] wish
[1:41:52] but you should be on the other hand
[1:41:53] thanking god for the blessings
[1:41:57] that's bestowed upon your friend your
[1:42:00] brother your sister in christ jesus you
[1:42:02] should be thank you lord
[1:42:04] that my brother is succeeding and now we
[1:42:07] know that natural blessings has nothing
[1:42:09] to do with spiritual blessings but thank
[1:42:10] you lord that you're you're blessing him
[1:42:12] that you're looking after him that
[1:42:15] brings joy in your life
[1:42:17] right uncontrollable ambition
[1:42:20] it's a buster it destroys
[1:42:22] you know a critical spirit oh my
[1:42:26] okay none of us ever had a critical
[1:42:28] spirit right
[1:42:30] critical spirit the tendency to make
[1:42:33] negative
[1:42:34] or hurtful are cutting remarks about
[1:42:37] others
[1:42:39] these things destroy our happiness in
[1:42:41] the lord
[1:42:44] you know if you have a concern
[1:42:46] i've had many concerns
[1:42:49] i've had critical thoughts come through
[1:42:50] my mind but i don't we ought not to
[1:42:51] allow the dead off to roost in our minds
[1:42:53] you know what we do
[1:42:55] we take it to the lord
[1:42:58] we find our needs
[1:43:00] we say lord these are things are my
[1:43:02] concerns when you express them to the
[1:43:04] lord your situation changes
[1:43:08] complaining spirits you know the dispos
[1:43:11] uh disposition to make excuses
[1:43:14] and then to blame others
[1:43:17] or bad circumstances for your problem
[1:43:21] uh a lot of people don't want is this
[1:43:23] okay
[1:43:24] a lot of people friends they don't want
[1:43:26] to take ownership for their own troubles
[1:43:29] and their old problems it's always
[1:43:30] somebody else's problem so you come into
[1:43:32] church
[1:43:33] and you've got this big chip on your
[1:43:35] shoulder man and listen i'm preaching
[1:43:37] from experience
[1:43:38] i i i've had a hey i've had a chip on my
[1:43:41] shoulder before and god had to
[1:43:43] fix me real good
[1:43:45] and you come into church and you've got
[1:43:47] an issue right
[1:43:48] hey got a critical spirit on you and you
[1:43:51] got this complaining spirit on you and
[1:43:53] you sit down on the bench
[1:43:54] and you look over to somebody who is
[1:43:56] pure as nothing's ever they've never
[1:43:58] done nothing to you
[1:44:00] and they they're just completely
[1:44:02] whatever else but you know what it makes
[1:44:03] you miserable to see them so happy
[1:44:08] and you look at them from the corner of
[1:44:09] that seat and all of a sudden you begin
[1:44:11] to think of everything possible from the
[1:44:14] hairdo right down to the bottom of the
[1:44:16] shoes that wasn't clean and maybe their
[1:44:17] car wasn't even washed
[1:44:19] but you find something to complain about
[1:44:21] them to blame them for your own problem
[1:44:25] the problem is you now let me tell you a
[1:44:27] little story i like stories let me tell
[1:44:29] you the story there is a couple boys and
[1:44:31] they had a grandfather and they wanted
[1:44:32] to play a trick on granddad
[1:44:34] and he had this this this terrible
[1:44:36] mustache you know those ones that come
[1:44:37] up and curl at the ends
[1:44:39] and he had it all waxed up and these
[1:44:41] boys wanted to play a little trick on
[1:44:42] grandfather so what they did was they
[1:44:44] went to the fridge and and they had some
[1:44:46] old limburger cheese you know what it's
[1:44:48] just awful stinky
[1:44:51] stinky stuff how many has ever eaten
[1:44:52] lemon cheese
[1:44:54] do you like it
[1:44:55] you hated it
[1:44:57] god bless you it's awful it stinks it's
[1:45:00] awful okay blue cheese is almost there
[1:45:03] but it's terrible so they went and they
[1:45:04] just smeared it took it in their hands
[1:45:06] and they it was he sniffed he stuck it
[1:45:08] on his mustache like this you know
[1:45:10] and he began to wake up and smelling
[1:45:12] this off and
[1:45:13] ah stinks right so i like everybody does
[1:45:16] first thing today
[1:45:19] how come it stinks that's our first you
[1:45:21] know first resolve and oh
[1:45:23] he it went into the next room
[1:45:25] it stinks
[1:45:27] went to the next chip sticks he finally
[1:45:28] went outside and he smelled outside and
[1:45:31] before you know it the first thing that
[1:45:33] came in his mouth he says this whole
[1:45:35] world stinks
[1:45:41] but really it's him that stunk
[1:45:45] right
[1:45:46] and that's exactly
[1:45:48] our position when we have these critical
[1:45:51] these complaining spirits on us that
[1:45:54] that become we were just problem in
[1:45:56] ourselves but we want to make the world
[1:45:57] the problem
[1:45:58] and everything the church stinks the job
[1:46:01] stinks your family sticks you love your
[1:46:02] wife and she stings
[1:46:04] all right everything is awful well it's
[1:46:07] then for you to clue in hello
[1:46:10] maybe you got the problem
[1:46:13] maybe you need to get on your knees
[1:46:16] and ask the minister the pastor to come
[1:46:18] and pray with you and anoint you with
[1:46:19] oil to remove this spirit that's causing
[1:46:22] the joy to be waning out of your life
[1:46:27] angry outbursts how many's ever got
[1:46:29] angry
[1:46:31] oh my
[1:46:33] don't preach on anger brother steve
[1:46:34] that's so natural yes anger outbursts
[1:46:38] not only are they embarrassing but they
[1:46:40] take away the joy out of your life
[1:46:44] you know i witnessed one time when we
[1:46:45] all have problems but i witnessed one
[1:46:47] time a wonderful lovely sister and she
[1:46:49] must have had a lot of pressure she had
[1:46:51] a bunch of sisters and brothers over
[1:46:53] you know she just a little ass straw the
[1:46:55] last straw
[1:46:56] have you ever been the last draw
[1:46:59] and i've never seen this before and i've
[1:47:01] never seen it since but she was taking
[1:47:03] that hot potato out of the oven and
[1:47:05] something just was the last straw
[1:47:07] and that sister she took that potato
[1:47:09] like it was a baseball and she whipped
[1:47:10] it and it went sailing through the air
[1:47:14] and it
[1:47:14] it hit her it it hit her like in the
[1:47:17] backsplash of her thing and then you
[1:47:20] know now did that make her feel better
[1:47:24] likely not because we're all watching
[1:47:26] her do it and she probably felt inches
[1:47:28] high
[1:47:29] and very silly and hoping that no but
[1:47:32] we're all watching
[1:47:33] and you know what it didn't make her
[1:47:35] feel joyful
[1:47:37] now think about all the angry outbursts
[1:47:39] that you've had in your life
[1:47:41] not only is it the old man rising
[1:47:44] right because that's the old flesh
[1:47:46] we're supposed to take all of that
[1:47:48] and bury it
[1:47:50] and put a new mind on us the mind of
[1:47:52] christ the new attributes of christ so
[1:47:54] we're not making any excuses today for
[1:47:58] our tendencies of the old flesh i say
[1:48:00] today in the name of the lord bury those
[1:48:03] things put them six feet under and when
[1:48:05] the little hand comes up and tries to
[1:48:07] steal your joy bury that hand step it
[1:48:10] down do what you need to do because it
[1:48:12] cannot ride out of your life control
[1:48:15] yourself by the holy ghost which is in
[1:48:17] the soul
[1:48:19] in that place of your being
[1:48:23] oh friends we need the lord
[1:48:27] philippians chapter 4 verse 12 speaks
[1:48:29] like this in the in the niv it says like
[1:48:31] this i know
[1:48:33] what is to be
[1:48:34] in uh be needed i know
[1:48:37] what it is to have plenty i learned the
[1:48:40] secret of being content
[1:48:43] we need to learn we've had nothing and
[1:48:45] we've had a lot
[1:48:48] and that's what has spoken but we need
[1:48:50] to find the place of contentment
[1:48:55] now let me read from the prophet in his
[1:48:57] life story in 1953 he says happiness
[1:49:00] doesn't consist of how much of the
[1:49:02] world's goods you own
[1:49:05] but how contented you are with the
[1:49:08] portion that has been
[1:49:10] allotted to you
[1:49:12] that's why you can be happy for your
[1:49:13] neighbor
[1:49:15] that's why you don't have to be critical
[1:49:16] about the other person that's why you
[1:49:18] don't have to try to talk badly about
[1:49:20] something be happy with the portion god
[1:49:23] gave you
[1:49:25] just make yourself content as long as
[1:49:28] one thing that brings contentment and
[1:49:30] that alone is jesus christ
[1:49:33] so get to the foot of christ get to
[1:49:36] god's
[1:49:37] prayer into god's presence and find joy
[1:49:40] and happiness there forever
[1:49:42] and brother brown said in jesus christ
[1:49:44] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:49:46] says he promised us joy and happiness
[1:49:49] and contentment which is the earnest of
[1:49:52] our salvation that we have now as a
[1:49:54] golden inheritance
[1:49:58] oh but i'm not i just don't feel like it
[1:50:00] brother this chief i'm just not happy
[1:50:01] tonight
[1:50:03] is your night to get the joy of the holy
[1:50:05] ghost if you don't don't have it
[1:50:08] uh christ among the people
[1:50:10] that they see the christ is not subdued
[1:50:13] hanging in the building but he's living
[1:50:15] in being formed by the holy spirit so
[1:50:18] we're not just looking at a pillar of
[1:50:19] fire
[1:50:20] of of the brother branham had hanging
[1:50:22] over him but we're seeing that life amen
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:29] and overcoming love that that destroys
[1:50:31] all these these things that try to
[1:50:33] hinder your life out of joy
[1:50:36] how about another one can we go through
[1:50:38] another one
[1:50:40] another one that busts the joy out of
[1:50:42] our lives is unresolved conflict
[1:50:46] wow
[1:50:47] unresolved joy it begins to evaporate it
[1:50:50] just goes away when we allow conflict
[1:50:52] between ourselves and other person to go
[1:50:54] on
[1:50:56] a little while a little while before you
[1:50:58] know it starts off a little something
[1:51:00] before you know it gets to be this great
[1:51:02] big thing
[1:51:03] i used to work in the hospital in the
[1:51:04] surgical department i was a operating
[1:51:06] room nurse
[1:51:08] you know there's a little there's a
[1:51:09] fella
[1:51:10] that developed a little skin cancer on
[1:51:12] his face
[1:51:14] and you know that little skin cancer
[1:51:15] thing on his face was just like in babe
[1:51:17] form
[1:51:18] you know and he could have come in and
[1:51:20] and this isn't the natural now he could
[1:51:21] have come in and we could have cut that
[1:51:23] thing off and sewed it up and chances
[1:51:25] are he probably nothing would ever
[1:51:26] happen to him but you know what happened
[1:51:28] he let it grow when british gold let it
[1:51:29] grow a little growth pretty soon it was
[1:51:31] so large that we had to take his entire
[1:51:34] face off
[1:51:36] and when he came to the place of time he
[1:51:37] could not see no more
[1:51:39] he couldn't speak anymore we had to do a
[1:51:41] skin flop that came all over his face
[1:51:42] like this all he could do is hear his
[1:51:44] ears but it all started out friends
[1:51:48] with one
[1:51:50] little bittle thing of skin cancer on
[1:51:53] his face
[1:51:54] he could have taken care of it but i
[1:51:56] want you to notice and that's the same
[1:51:58] in the spiritual we sometimes have these
[1:52:00] just little conflicts between husband
[1:52:03] and wife
[1:52:06] they just start off really small
[1:52:08] before you know it they grow
[1:52:10] and pretty far they grow
[1:52:12] and pretty soon they're way so big that
[1:52:16] it takes a lot of time and a lot of
[1:52:18] energy with the ministry trying to put
[1:52:20] the family back together again
[1:52:23] when you could take the solid truth of
[1:52:25] the word that says don't let your anger
[1:52:27] go down down
[1:52:29] don't have this anger let and let the
[1:52:30] sun go down upon it that's what i'm
[1:52:32] trying to say allow forgive one another
[1:52:34] don't go to bed angry
[1:52:37] okay and be honest about it you know
[1:52:40] give one another a hug and say i'm sorry
[1:52:42] for the way i treated you
[1:52:45] isn't that true come on for us married
[1:52:47] ones
[1:52:48] you know i at one time in our marriage
[1:52:50] you know we had a disagreement and i
[1:52:52] said to my wife and jokingly but it was
[1:52:54] nevertheless i was trying to make a
[1:52:55] point i said if i would agree with you
[1:52:57] both of us would be wrong
[1:52:59] that's not how you apologize
[1:53:02] okay don't go to bed with that kind of
[1:53:05] apology
[1:53:08] she's gonna be madder than a buzz saw in
[1:53:10] the morning
[1:53:14] and i like my age hard but i don't like
[1:53:16] them real hard
[1:53:17] see we got to love one another right
[1:53:20] right and that stumbles all the way in
[1:53:22] your work life and in your home life in
[1:53:24] your church life everything resolve the
[1:53:27] conflict that's in your life
[1:53:29] don't let someone's offenses come
[1:53:30] against you and let it occupy your mind
[1:53:34] i don't know about you but when when
[1:53:36] somebody's done me wrong or i'm holding
[1:53:38] an offense that i should not be holding
[1:53:40] and the lord is working on me but i want
[1:53:42] you to notice what happens i can't pray
[1:53:45] it's the first thing that happens i
[1:53:46] can't pray
[1:53:48] i get before the lord
[1:53:49] and i'm like lord and it's like no i
[1:53:51] just can't even do
[1:53:53] and then i get to the bible and i love
[1:53:55] reading and i love to study the god's
[1:53:56] word and
[1:53:57] i become more disciplined as my life is
[1:53:59] gone to read the word and of love but
[1:54:01] you know when i look at that it's just
[1:54:02] words
[1:54:04] and then everything starts to go falling
[1:54:06] down
[1:54:07] friends
[1:54:08] let's get to the point and let's not
[1:54:10] just let it occupy your mind if you're
[1:54:12] not letting it occupy in your mind
[1:54:14] you're just giving god the leftovers
[1:54:17] right we don't want to give god the
[1:54:18] leftovers we want to give god the first
[1:54:20] fruits of our lives
[1:54:22] so don't give god the leftovers
[1:54:24] cast that thing out make things right
[1:54:26] don't just wait till communion
[1:54:29] how many people they don't want to be
[1:54:31] embarrassed by the church and not come
[1:54:33] up that sunday evening you know to have
[1:54:34] communion so they waltz over to their
[1:54:36] family members say you know i'm i'm
[1:54:39] sorry now don't wait till then
[1:54:43] when the lord is calling and you know
[1:54:44] you weren't right yeah we're not silly
[1:54:46] people we know when we made a boo-boo
[1:54:50] we know when we cross the line god
[1:54:52] convicts us we have the holy ghost in
[1:54:54] our life god convicts us at the time of
[1:54:56] conviction
[1:54:58] go to that one
[1:55:00] and say look let's at least pray
[1:55:02] together and and establish ourselves
[1:55:05] around the word and say we're sorry to
[1:55:07] one another and then let's work together
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:13] oh let's not allow these things to cloud
[1:55:15] our mind make the hebrews it says make
[1:55:18] every effort to live in peace with all
[1:55:21] men and be holy without holiness no
[1:55:24] one will see the lord
[1:55:28] can we understand that without holiness
[1:55:31] without godliness none of us are going
[1:55:33] to see the lord without a ref
[1:55:37] getting forgiveness without coming to
[1:55:39] the lord and between one another say
[1:55:41] father be between us and forgive us of
[1:55:43] our troubles we are not going to see the
[1:55:45] lord
[1:55:46] i see that too many times today
[1:55:49] unresolved conflict and you know what
[1:55:50] happens you're cheating yourself
[1:55:53] you're cheating yourself on what god has
[1:55:55] for us
[1:55:57] number
[1:55:58] three
[1:56:00] anybody know what it would be
[1:56:03] number three is unconfessed sin
[1:56:07] now friends we're children of god here
[1:56:10] filled with the holy ghost most of us
[1:56:11] i'm sure
[1:56:12] we're not talking about now sin that we
[1:56:14] remember sin is unbelief to god's word
[1:56:17] so when i talk about unconfessed sin i'm
[1:56:19] not talking about grossities
[1:56:22] i'm not talking about fornication and
[1:56:24] adultery because that should never be
[1:56:25] named even amongst us that's
[1:56:28] and theft and stealing all right and
[1:56:31] lustful living and all those things
[1:56:33] should not be named amongst us yes but
[1:56:36] when i'm talking to us about sin that
[1:56:38] robs our joy it's unconfessed sin that's
[1:56:40] doubt according to of doubting of the
[1:56:43] word of god
[1:56:45] so you know something
[1:56:47] when you have a doubt and when you have
[1:56:49] something in the way i don't know about
[1:56:51] you but guilt sets in
[1:56:53] you know you shouldn't have this
[1:56:55] right you should have faith to believe
[1:56:58] but i got this guilt
[1:57:00] and it becomes and it begins to grow
[1:57:01] faster and faster before you know it the
[1:57:03] guilt overwhelms you and your joy begins
[1:57:06] to wane off
[1:57:08] amen how many knows you've ever
[1:57:10] been been sick before and you know that
[1:57:12] god is your healer
[1:57:14] even a simple headache or if i've had a
[1:57:16] toothache and i'm like i know god's my
[1:57:18] healer and god can take care of this
[1:57:20] pain and i'll go the dentist and he'll
[1:57:22] get it sealed up and we'll be good but
[1:57:24] you know someone i i might find a little
[1:57:26] bit more doubt in there
[1:57:28] and i might find a little then i begin
[1:57:30] to think and you know what begins to
[1:57:31] happen to me as a christian i begin to
[1:57:33] get guilty
[1:57:34] well why don't i believe
[1:57:36] and why can't this happen
[1:57:39] and before you know it it over it
[1:57:40] consumes us
[1:57:42] so let me can i give you another example
[1:57:45] this is a little bit closer closer to
[1:57:46] home to me i i have a son he's 21 years
[1:57:49] old he's a wonderful christian fella
[1:57:52] loves the lord and loves to sing and
[1:57:53] very gifted young man but the devil has
[1:57:56] come against him
[1:57:57] and he he has in his body something we
[1:58:00] call spontaneous pneumothorax and as he
[1:58:03] was growing his lung would separate from
[1:58:05] and would make a little hole and his
[1:58:07] lung would collapse
[1:58:09] and it would cost he's had five
[1:58:10] surgeries on uh two uh two and three so
[1:58:13] two on one side and three on the other
[1:58:15] and each time they'll take out a piece
[1:58:17] of his lung and it's just a big surgery
[1:58:19] and so forth and
[1:58:20] you know what
[1:58:22] you know all of a sudden
[1:58:24] i believe for without a shadow of a
[1:58:27] doubt that the lords are healing
[1:58:30] but after his lung had collapsed 15
[1:58:33] times
[1:58:35] and five surgeries
[1:58:37] i got a little bit
[1:58:39] weak
[1:58:42] now i'm preaching for my heart
[1:58:45] i got to this place where lord i i know
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:48] are our healer your word says
[1:58:51] but i
[1:58:52] i'm not seeing this and i'm praying and
[1:58:54] i'm calling out to you and that's not
[1:58:56] lord
[1:58:58] what's happen you know what happened to
[1:58:59] me i started feeling guilty
[1:59:02] guilt came him out
[1:59:04] and brothers would ask me you know hey
[1:59:06] brother steve how's your son doing
[1:59:08] and usually i would testify god is good
[1:59:11] god is wonderful these are overcome here
[1:59:13] but you know what happened to me
[1:59:15] i would just say he's fine
[1:59:18] he's fine
[1:59:19] he's fine and you know why because this
[1:59:22] guilt
[1:59:24] began to push over in my life
[1:59:27] until i got a revelation
[1:59:30] it didn't matter
[1:59:31] whether god would allow my son to be
[1:59:33] taken from me through death
[1:59:35] or he would have life
[1:59:36] god is still stays and remains the same
[1:59:40] when i got that revelation
[1:59:42] then all of a sudden all that guilt was
[1:59:45] gone
[1:59:46] all that
[1:59:48] what i would like to say unconfessed sin
[1:59:50] that all that that disbelieve of god's
[1:59:53] word it was taken from me
[1:59:56] all of a sudden then once it was gone
[1:59:58] for me
[1:59:59] i now
[2:00:00] could once again have the joy
[2:00:03] of the word in my life because now it
[2:00:06] made no difference
[2:00:08] it has no bearing upon who i am or what
[2:00:12] it is yes it's my son yes i love him but
[2:00:15] he giveth and he taketh away so blessed
[2:00:18] be the name of the lord and inside of
[2:00:20] that i once again found joy
[2:00:24] amen but if i would keep on in the path
[2:00:28] i was
[2:00:30] if i would keep in this this place of
[2:00:32] unconfessed unbelief you know where we'd
[2:00:35] be today in a very bad spot
[2:00:38] but thanks be to god by the holy spirit
[2:00:40] that he breaks this thing and he can
[2:00:43] break it in your life now i'm i spoke
[2:00:45] very personally to you but i want you to
[2:00:47] know if you're going through something
[2:00:50] don't let this unconfessed unbelief this
[2:00:53] unconfessed sin we're not talking about
[2:00:55] lust now we're talking about things that
[2:00:57] come against the believer that cause us
[2:01:00] not to live victorious lives
[2:01:03] so some things come against you friends
[2:01:05] just call unto god and say lord remove
[2:01:08] this thing out of my life
[2:01:11] brother braham says now he says now you
[2:01:13] remember if you've got unconfessed sin
[2:01:15] in your heart i'm placing it back on
[2:01:17] your lap
[2:01:18] worse sorry yeah worse then this will
[2:01:21] come upon you if you've got unconfessed
[2:01:23] sin step out of the prayer line he says
[2:01:26] and make it right before god

[2:06:42] an individual walk between you and god
[2:06:46] more than ever
[2:06:48] in this last little bit i realized
[2:06:50] when i go to church
[2:06:52] wherever i am
[2:06:54] it's not about other people
[2:06:56] how many is looking for a revival
[2:06:59] what were promised a bride's revival
[2:07:01] but guess where the revival is it's an
[2:07:03] individual people amen
[2:07:05] we're not gathering the the football
[2:07:07] stadiums anymore if you obviously notice
[2:07:11] there's not this great big gathering of
[2:07:13] all the people that want to hear the
[2:07:14] message any longer there's a revival and
[2:07:17] that's in the individual lives the
[2:07:19] revival starts with you and i begin to
[2:07:22] notice when i begin to praise god for
[2:07:24] the individual walk not for my wife's
[2:07:26] walk
[2:07:27] not for my children my children not for
[2:07:29] me it's god has no grandchildren we're
[2:07:31] worshiping god we receive something
[2:07:33] special at the moment for the moment for
[2:07:36] ourselves
[2:07:38] and that's how we ought to come to
[2:07:39] church we walk in those doors
[2:07:41] through those wise nice doors with those
[2:07:43] brass knobs we pull them open and we say
[2:07:45] lord i'm here
[2:07:47] to worship amen
[2:07:49] okay now listen we're worshiping him
[2:07:52] he's not worshiping us a lot of us stand
[2:07:54] there and say okay put on a show up for
[2:07:56] us god we want to see something happen

[2:08:06] worship him

[2:08:11] that is what god has for us so we need
[2:08:14] to rehearse it we need to come before
[2:08:16] him joy comes by the attitude of joy
[2:08:20] you are a creator of your own atmosphere
[2:08:25] wherever you are
[2:08:27] in whatever situation i've been in the
[2:08:29] most awfulest seems in my own little
[2:08:32] puny life
[2:08:33] situation i've been since atmospheres
[2:08:35] i'm thinking oh man how can i ever
[2:08:36] possible have a good attitude here
[2:08:39] but you know something with that
[2:08:40] bubbling inside of me like i said
[2:08:43] of the stream on the inside you could be
[2:08:44] in the worst place
[2:08:46] i'm talking about like a situation like
[2:08:48] at work when everybody likes you you
[2:08:49] know
[2:08:50] it makes no difference you still are
[2:08:52] representing christ in such a way that
[2:08:55] the attitude of joy
[2:08:57] comes out of your life

[2:09:39] and things that were in the backward
[2:09:41] parts of your mind come forward
[2:09:43] and you're telling them all about the
[2:09:44] wonderfulness of god
[2:09:46] amen then you're finished you're
[2:09:47] witnessing they go their way

[2:13:54] oh praise the lord i spoke lord this
[2:13:57] evening
[2:13:59] we desire more joy lord
[2:14:02] we're believers here i
[2:14:04] look around the room today and
[2:14:07] lord i believe the believers here have
[2:14:09] your nature your life inside of them
[2:14:12] they have your word
[2:14:14] sometimes the enemy comes by and cools
[2:14:16] us off a little
[2:14:18] we live in this leia see a word when
[2:14:19] we're not part of it no i refuse to be
[2:14:22] part of it
[2:14:23] we're called out of this leosia world
[2:14:26] but father sometimes we get distracted
[2:14:29] and we get influenced by things that's
[2:14:31] so easily beset
[2:14:33] then we get cooled off and the first
[2:14:35] thing that
[2:14:36] begins to leave our lives is the joy of
[2:14:40] serving you
[2:14:42] so i want to ask the people tonight lord
[2:14:44] if you would
[2:14:45] speak to their hearts just now i would
[2:14:47] like to ask them
[2:14:49] if there's anyone here today that just
[2:14:50] needs a special touch for god to come in
[2:14:53] and
[2:14:54] restore the joy in their heart
[2:14:57] maybe something i've said touched their
[2:14:58] lives something that they've maybe got a
[2:15:00] little dote or something that's in there
[2:15:01] that shouldn't be there
[2:15:03] i pray father that they would just
[2:15:06] acknowledge it before you today
[2:15:13] amen father
[2:15:17] now that we've recognized lord that
[2:15:18] those things are in our way
[2:15:21] i pray lord now that we begin to speak
[2:15:23] to you and talk to you about it for just
[2:15:25] a moment
[2:15:26] lord i could say a lot of things and i
[2:15:28] can pray and
[2:15:29] but unless oh god they find their
[2:15:32] position in you and find their way back
[2:15:34] to you lord
[2:15:35] i can say a million words but it'll
[2:15:36] never help they have to come before you
[2:15:39] say lord forgive me
[2:15:41] so i'd like to leave this opportunity
[2:15:43] just now lord
[2:15:45] i'd like to encourage you saints one to
[2:15:47] another don't worry about the next
[2:15:48] person that's next to you
[2:15:51] this might be like time like no other
[2:15:54] but i wonder if you could take a moment
[2:15:56] and just begin to pray individually

[2:16:00] to you just pray
[2:16:04] you have an issue in your life you know

[2:58:29] hallelujah
[2:58:32] hallelujah praise the lord just keep
[2:58:34] playing
[2:58:36] just to say what struck me about this
[2:58:38] song
[2:58:39] is that
[2:58:41] if you look at the three the three
[2:58:42] verses together
[2:58:44] my joy uh my sorry my peace my joy and
[2:58:48] my love
[2:58:50] we're
[2:58:51] that's god giving that to us
[2:58:54] he said i'll be with you and i'll be in
[2:58:56] you right so god is god is in his people
[2:58:59] he's given us that peace and he's given
[2:59:01] us that joy he was preached about
[2:59:02] tonight
[2:59:04] and he's given us that love
[2:59:06] so
[2:59:07] because god is in all of us shouldn't we
[2:59:09] be showing all those three to each other
[2:59:11] right
[2:59:13] that's what the body of christ does
[2:59:15] right that's what believers do
[2:59:17] so there's no room for
[2:59:20] hurt just
[2:59:21] there'll be that there'll be mistakes
[2:59:23] and all of that sort of thing but
[2:59:24] there's a love there's a joy and there's
[2:59:26] a peace
[2:59:27] that it that expresses itself
[2:59:30] through through that true forgiveness by
[2:59:32] the holy ghost in all of us right
[2:59:35] so
[2:59:37] i just i just wanted to focus on that
[2:59:39] for a second this is
[2:59:41] god giving of himself to each and every
[2:59:43] one of us
[2:59:45] it's that peace that love and that joy
[2:59:49] so let's just sing that love the third
[2:59:51] verse
[2:59:52] and
[2:59:54] brother josh can close in prayer but i
[2:59:55] just wanted to point that out it's
[2:59:57] sometimes we just sing it because it's
[2:59:59] nice words
[3:00:01] and brother brandon said that at one
[3:00:03] point he said that
[3:00:05] we don't have this problem here by the
[3:00:07] grace of god but he said he said
[3:00:10] people in the church that he said they
[3:00:13] sing and they worship and they jump and
[3:00:14] they dance and they shout and they do
[3:00:16] all that stuff and he said when the
[3:00:17] music stops that stops
[3:00:19] but that's just a precursor that's just
[3:00:21] a preliminary to the word going forth
[3:00:23] where where
[3:00:25] the response is greater right
[3:00:28] because there's god speaking to our
[3:00:29] hearts right
[3:00:31] and he's increasing our faith and he's
[3:00:32] he's given us what he knows we have need
[3:00:34] of through the ministry
[3:00:37] you know we're
[3:00:39] very privileged people we just need to
[3:00:40] realize it sometimes
[3:00:43] amen let's just sing it
[3:00:45] and brother joshua calls right
[3:00:48] my
