[44:48] people Lord you are the shepherd and
[44:50] they are your flock Lord we're trusting
[44:52] you to do a work in each life here this
[44:54] morning Lord God lord we invite you in
[44:57] now to take preeminence in this service
[44:59] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[45:02] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[45:04] Psalm
[45:06] 17 Psalm 17 this morning amen want to
[45:09] say Happy Father's Day to all the
[45:11] faithful fathers that are here this
[45:13] morning and all of us that have a
[45:15] faithful father amen we've got a great
[45:16] father above us all amen he's more
[45:19] faithful than we can be and that's our
[45:20] great rest amen is that we have a
[45:22] heavenly father that loves us and cares
[45:24] for us and covers for us and protects us
[45:27] and meets all of our needs amen and we
[45:29] have a number of announcements this
[45:31] morning certainly appreciate the special
[45:32] this morning right in line with the
[45:34] service I was talking to brother Jim
[45:36] douly the uh yesterday and his his
[45:39] brother Jack has Belle's paly and he's
[45:41] got one eye that stays open and his jaw
[45:43] is having some problems as well so he
[45:45] asked for prayer for that brother Jim
[45:47] will be in uh tomorrow until the 30th so
[45:50] I've asked him he'll take one service
[45:52] Lord willing while he's here so we look
[45:54] forward to fellowship with him amen we
[45:56] want to re
[45:57] want to welcome sister Rebecca Benjamin
[45:59] to the church this morning amen all the
[46:01] way from Ontario amen the Lord gives
[46:03] amen so I was telling her yesterday I
[46:05] don't believe that God just sends us
[46:07] members he sends us a part of the body
[46:10] that we were missing and we didn't know
[46:12] amen so if somebody comes in we believe
[46:14] they're here for a reason they're here
[46:15] to get a blessing and they're here to be
[46:17] a blessing Amen to be a part of the body
[46:19] so we want to certainly make her welcome
[46:22] so the Lord gives and the Lord also
[46:24] takes away and uh brother Josh and
[46:26] sister relle asked me to announce to the
[46:28] church that they'll be me moving to
[46:30] Ottawa on July 11th right after the
[46:32] special meetings and they just feel led
[46:35] to do that so I said it's a real shame
[46:37] we certainly have appreciated having
[46:38] them brother Josh has been here 15 years
[46:41] maybe brother Josh is that about right
[46:43] 15 years of faithful service and he's
[46:45] been a real steady believer it's a it's
[46:48] a real shame it's a real shame to miss
[46:50] him but here's the thing somebody needs
[46:52] him more than we need him apparently so
[46:54] we trust that God does all things well
[46:56] and he gives a blessing and he takes
[46:57] away some blessings but we say brother
[47:00] Josh sister relle and baby anniah God go
[47:02] with you God bless you we certainly love
[47:04] and appreciate you and if there's
[47:05] anything we can do to help you on that
[47:07] move then just let us know and and we'll
[47:09] be there to do it amen amen God bless
[47:12] you Psalms chapter 17 and verse 5 this
[47:15] morning David says this he says hold up
[47:17] my goings in thy paths that my footsteps
[47:21] slip not I have called upon thee for
[47:24] thou Wilt hear me oh God incline thine
[47:27] ear unto me and hear my speech show thy
[47:31] marvelous loving kindness oh thou that
[47:34] savest by thy right hand them which put
[47:36] their trust in thee from those that rise
[47:39] up against them keep me as the apple of
[47:42] the eye hide me under the shadow of thy
[47:45] Wings amen God bless you you can have
[47:47] your seats this morning and we're
[47:49] continuing our series on manifesting
[47:51] time on the adoption of the Sons and
[47:52] Daughters of God and I want to continue
[47:54] the the series we started last service
[47:57] on living in the realities of God and I
[47:59] want to keep pressing on this and we
[48:01] asked last service where is the god of
[48:03] the Bible amen and it's a fair question
[48:05] and we know it's been asked many times
[48:07] in scriptures and just by way of review
[48:09] this morning for those that weren't here
[48:10] Gideon asked if God be forc and where
[48:12] are all the Miracles Gideon had heard of
[48:14] the god of Moses and the the god of
[48:16] Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god
[48:18] of Joshua and these different things but
[48:20] he says if God is really with us then
[48:22] where are the Miracles where is the
[48:23] proof that he's with us amen we know
[48:25] that Elisha when elah died he came over
[48:28] to that River and he says where is the
[48:29] god of Elijah and he smot the waters and
[48:32] they parted amen and we see that God is
[48:34] still alive and well he never dies he
[48:36] never stops moving he never falls asleep
[48:39] but there Comes A Time of Need there
[48:40] Comes A Time of battle there Comes A
[48:42] Time of decision there Comes A Time of
[48:44] trial and we need the reality of God
[48:46] Amen it's not enough now to just sit in
[48:48] church and hear a preacher it's not just
[48:49] enough to sit and read your Bible but
[48:51] you need the god of that preaching the
[48:52] god of that Bible to step out of those
[48:54] pages and into the circumstances of your
[48:57] life amen we don't just want a god of
[48:59] reality we need we need a god of reality
[49:02] amen and if we are to step into adoption
[49:04] if we have stepped into adoption then
[49:06] we've got to see that God is a reality
[49:08] because this world is broken people are
[49:10] broken the systems are broken politics
[49:12] are broken the financial systems broken
[49:15] morality is broken everything's broken
[49:17] there's only one thing that stands
[49:18] steadfast and sure and that's the word
[49:20] of God in our lives amen amen I read
[49:23] this quote last service and I want to
[49:24] repeat it for those that weren't here
[49:26] just to keep us moving forward this
[49:27] morning brother brownan would say this
[49:29] he says I think that today we've had
[49:31] much preaching many five ministers able
[49:33] ministers have brought us the word your
[49:35] pastors and evangelists and so forth
[49:37] that come through the city but I think
[49:40] the main thing that I'm trying to bring
[49:41] to you now he's setting himself apart
[49:44] and this isn't ego talking but this is
[49:46] the Fulfillment of scripture speaking
[49:48] over the pulpit now amen this is a
[49:50] prophet of God and he's differentiating
[49:52] his ministry he says what I'm trying to
[49:53] bring to you is the reality of the
[49:56] presence of Christ he says that you
[49:59] might see him and know that it's him by
[50:02] his identified promise for the day so we
[50:06] have to see that there's a revealing of
[50:08] God for each day and it's according to
[50:10] the promise of his word he does not come
[50:12] the way we want him to come he comes the
[50:14] way he said he was going to come amen he
[50:16] he is in alignment with his word at all
[50:18] times and so last service we talked
[50:19] about the mystery of Christ The Mystery
[50:21] of God being unfolded in this age and we
[50:23] talked about a seventh Angel's voice and
[50:25] a restoring message that brings us back
[50:28] to the original truth of the Pentecostal
[50:30] fathers and we said why does God have to
[50:32] do this because God's got to take us to
[50:35] the uh the intended conclusion of the
[50:37] word which is a resurrection and a
[50:38] Rapture it's a Redemption it's a
[50:41] restoration of the Bride to her original
[50:44] position in Christ and to do that she
[50:46] has to have the original word as it was
[50:48] understood and taught Amen brother bham
[50:50] did not bring a new message if you think
[50:53] that it's heresy he did not bring a new
[50:54] message he brought a restoring message
[50:57] that restored the truth of the word that
[50:59] was lost through 2,000 years of men's
[51:01] ideas and denominations anden there's
[51:03] nothing new here they understood those
[51:04] things already but Paul would say this
[51:06] mystery this mystery unveiling it's been
[51:09] there since the world began but it's
[51:11] been kept secret but he says it's
[51:13] happening now it's manifesting now it
[51:15] it's coming to fruition right now and
[51:18] God has been working in Simplicity all
[51:20] through 6,000 years and usually working
[51:23] in Simplicity means working with simple
[51:25] people amen it's not not big flowery
[51:27] speeches it's not men of renown in terms
[51:30] of their education or their knowledge
[51:32] but it's simple people of Faith simple
[51:34] humble Victorious Believers that God has
[51:36] worked in through all these times and
[51:38] it's the revealing of God Through the
[51:40] Ages in little simple humble men and
[51:42] women throughout the times Paul would
[51:44] say this he says to whom God would make
[51:46] known what is the riches of the glory of
[51:49] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[51:51] what Christ in you the hope of glory not
[51:54] just Christ in the prophet not just
[51:56] Christ and the one that's bringing the
[51:57] word but there's a word that comes to
[51:59] the word and it's revealing who you are
[52:01] in him amen this morning so it was all
[52:04] tied to the church ages it was tied to
[52:06] that final messenger of the final
[52:07] seventh Church age and we have plenty of
[52:09] scriptures and I'm not going to go into
[52:11] it this morning if you weren't here
[52:12] Wednesday night go back and listen to
[52:14] the first 15 or 20 minutes and it'll set
[52:16] you up for where we're going this
[52:18] morning but after I said all that I read
[52:20] one quote and I wanted to read it again
[52:22] this morning as we're talking about
[52:23] living in the realities of God because
[52:25] we want to know what are the realities
[52:27] for today what are we supposed to be
[52:29] looking for and what does it look like
[52:31] in our personal lives amen not just
[52:34] what's happening out there what's
[52:35] happening in here what's happening in
[52:37] here that's where we want God to be amen
[52:39] the re the reality of God is for God to
[52:41] fulfill his word that's what it looks
[52:44] like amen and so we've got to know what
[52:46] the word is supposed to be fulfilling in
[52:47] our day now brother BR would say this
[52:49] and he reads Revelation 10:7 in the days
[52:52] of the voice of the seventh messenger
[52:54] when he shall begin to sound the history
[52:56] of God should be finished as he had
[52:58] declared to his servants the prophets he
[53:01] says there it is he's sending a
[53:02] Vindicated Prophet he's sending a
[53:04] prophet after almost 2,000 years he's
[53:07] sending someone who is so far from
[53:09] organization education and the world of
[53:12] religion that is John the Baptist and
[53:14] Elijah of old he will hear only from God
[53:17] and he will have thus saith the Lord and
[53:20] speak for God now that's a heady
[53:22] statement but we see it in Revelation 2
[53:24] and 3 that there's an angel mess meenger
[53:26] to each of the seven Church ages and
[53:28] that angel messenger has the voice of
[53:31] the Holy Ghost it says hear what the
[53:33] spirit sayth unto the churches and guess
[53:36] what it speaks through a prophet
[53:37] messenger and what's he doing he's
[53:38] bringing you to the word for your day
[53:40] amen that's what we believe this morning
[53:42] but then he says this he will be God's
[53:44] mouthpiece And he as it is declared in
[53:47] Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the
[53:49] children back to the fathers that's
[53:51] where you and I come in he says he will
[53:53] bring back the elect of the last day and
[53:56] and they will one here a Vindicated
[53:59] Prophet give the exact truth as it was
[54:02] with Paul he does not bring a new
[54:04] message he is telling us what Paul
[54:06] originally
[54:07] taught then he will restore the truth as
[54:10] they had it and those elect with him in
[54:12] that day will be the ones who truly
[54:15] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[54:19] his voice and perform his Works amen
[54:22] behold I said unto you Elijah the
[54:24] prophet he's coming to do a work in our
[54:27] lives not just through that prophet he
[54:29] did not stop at a prophet but the voice
[54:31] has moved into the bride now and she is
[54:33] speaking in the stad of God because why
[54:35] the Same Spirit that's in hers is in the
[54:37] prophet amen it's God speaking through
[54:39] his bride and we know that God and
[54:41] brother B would say it's all been hidden
[54:42] through types and shadows throughout the
[54:44] scriptures after those seals were opened
[54:46] he says he says go back and read your
[54:48] Bible and if you don't see Jesus Christ
[54:50] on every page go back and read it again
[54:52] and yet what do you read in those pages
[54:54] you read about people you read about
[54:57] people and it's just a mention here of
[54:58] God does this and God did that but every
[55:00] page is God working through a bride it's
[55:02] God working through an elect people and
[55:04] he's saying you got to see Christ in the
[55:05] people not just Christ in the pillar of
[55:07] fire or Christ in the body as he came
[55:09] 2,000 years ago anden we see the word
[55:11] always comes to a woman so many times
[55:14] not always comes it comes so often to a
[55:16] woman and many times she's an outcast
[55:18] many times she's a gentile we see Rahab
[55:20] gets a a promise of saving life see it
[55:23] always comes with a promise and Rahab
[55:25] it's not only to say save her life but
[55:27] anyone else she can get in he'll save
[55:29] them as well it's extended to her you
[55:31] have the woman at the will well what's
[55:33] her promise you'll never thirst again
[55:34] you'll never seek anything once you've
[55:36] tasted what I've given you hallelujah
[55:38] amen that's why we don't go seeking
[55:40] another message that's why we don't go
[55:41] seeking after other things we've already
[55:43] got our thirst satisfied and we're
[55:44] drinking from a well that will never
[55:46] will never end in our lives amen see
[55:49] Ruth what does she get she gets a
[55:50] promise of
[55:52] redemption something that never belonged
[55:54] to her and yet it's redeemed to her she
[55:56] didn't realize she owned something she
[55:57] didn't realize she had an inheritance
[55:59] but she had a man that came to her and
[56:00] he redeemed her by the word of that day
[56:03] so this morning we're going to talk
[56:04] about a woman but this is not an outcast
[56:07] but this is a great woman amen it's a
[56:09] woman with wonderful character faithful
[56:11] in her house and community and she was
[56:13] well regarded in many ways and you know
[56:15] many of us were H were perhaps outcasts
[56:17] in some ways you know brother Mark would
[56:19] say he was living under a mushroom you
[56:21] know certainly in the in the things of
[56:22] God outcasts Catholics
[56:26] atheists agnostics whatever it might be
[56:29] but many of us were born in a Christian
[56:31] Home praise the Lord and so we have to
[56:33] still come to a place where the word
[56:35] comes to us not just where we go to
[56:37] church but we have to make a decision
[56:39] and we have to have a personal
[56:41] experience that validates and vindicates
[56:43] that word in our life where we know that
[56:45] God is real and God is alive and well
[56:48] but we see this word coming to a woman
[56:50] and we can read about it in 2 Kings 4
[56:52] and if you'll take your Bibles there I
[56:54] may move around a bit but we'll stay in
[56:56] Second Kings this morning and it says
[56:58] this and it fell on a day that Elijah
[57:00] passed to shunum now that that that that
[57:03] word shunum means double resting
[57:07] place it means
[57:10] undisturbed in other words you're at
[57:12] peace so much that if the first piece is
[57:14] broken you got a piece behind the piece
[57:16] and you cannot be frustrated you cannot
[57:18] get worried you cannot be broken you
[57:20] cannot be fearful it's peace layered on
[57:23] top of Peace On Top Of Peace you are at
[57:25] rest at all times what a glorious thing
[57:28] to think of that no matter what's
[57:29] happening you can say all is well amen
[57:32] and we see that's exactly the way it
[57:33] goes but it says in shunum there was a
[57:35] great woman and she constrained him to
[57:37] eat bread you know they did that on when
[57:40] they were walking to emus they constrain
[57:42] Christ to come
[57:44] in sometimes we've got to pull him in he
[57:48] comes our way but we've got to pull him
[57:49] in it constrained him to eat bread and
[57:52] so it was that as often as he passed he
[57:54] turned in thither to eat bread
[57:56] so notice here it says that there was a
[57:58] great woman there were many women in
[58:01] shunum there were many Israelite women
[58:03] in shunum but there were also a great
[58:06] Gentile woman great women maybe perhaps
[58:09] but there's one great woman that the
[58:10] scripture mentions and she is a gentile
[58:13] this is a blended City they have
[58:14] Israelites and they have Gentiles listen
[58:17] uh uh living there but there's only one
[58:19] that's identified as a great woman by
[58:21] the scriptures and the prophet of God
[58:23] would confirm this many times he says
[58:24] she was a shunamite she was a gentile
[58:27] and we'll see where he gets that from as
[58:28] we go through the scriptures this
[58:29] morning it it was interesting I was
[58:31] doing some just some research on on on
[58:33] different element of of this is I was
[58:35] studying yesterday and I I I was reading
[58:37] of a a woman theology professor and she
[58:40] was talking about the patriarchy and the
[58:42] right of agency and and the roles of
[58:44] women in the scripture and she ties this
[58:45] woman to Israel and she's made a false
[58:48] premise right there because she says she
[58:49] had leadership over her husband and she
[58:51] had this and that and the other and she
[58:52] completely misses that this woman was a
[58:54] gentile
[58:56] she's gone off on these things Church
[58:57] we're blessed to have a message like we
[58:59] have today I was listening to an
[59:02] Adventist service yesterday and they're
[59:04] convinced that the tribulation will will
[59:06] will center around those who celebrate
[59:10] uh who meet to worship on the Sabbath
[59:12] that's what's going to cause the
[59:13] tribulation hasn't caused the
[59:15] tribulation yet why would it cause it
[59:16] now there there there's nothing going on
[59:18] about the Sabbath nobody cares about it
[59:20] but they're convinced on it why because
[59:22] they picked an element of scripture that
[59:24] they're going to stand on and they'll
[59:25] Circle every single thing about it and
[59:27] they'll completely Miss what's going on
[59:28] around them we're blessed this morning
[59:30] to have a word
[59:32] amen but you first word it says a great
[59:35] Gentile woman I looked up that word
[59:36] great and the first time you see it is
[59:38] in Genesis 1116 where God created two
[59:42] great lights a greater one to rule today
[59:45] the day that's Christ and then a lesser
[59:47] one to rule the night and that's the
[59:48] moon and that's the bride reflecting
[59:50] Christ This is a reflection of Christ
[59:52] here in this little story that we see
[59:54] and she stands far above all others and
[59:56] we see why that is as we'll go through
[59:57] that this morning it says and she said
[59:59] unto her husband behold now I perceive
[1:00:02] that this is an holy man of God which
[1:00:04] passes by us continually this is Elisha
[1:00:07] the prophet believe me everybody that's
[1:00:09] an Israelite knows who Elisha is she has
[1:00:12] no clue who she is but there's something
[1:00:14] about him that she says he's a holy man
[1:00:16] he's a good man there's something
[1:00:18] different about this man and the prophet
[1:00:19] of God will put it this way he says
[1:00:21] elishah so conducted himself around in
[1:00:23] that Gentile country there that this my
[1:00:26] woman realized that he was truly a
[1:00:28] servant of God by what his character his
[1:00:32] conduct and the things that God did by
[1:00:35] him she recognized him to be a servant
[1:00:37] of the Lord notice those three things
[1:00:39] say we think well it'll be the signs and
[1:00:41] wonders he says no his conduct and his
[1:00:42] character his day-to-day living was the
[1:00:45] first thing that catches her attention
[1:00:46] and then the signs and wonders follow
[1:00:48] that what are people looking at in our
[1:00:50] lives church can they see the character
[1:00:53] can they see the conduct does it cause
[1:00:54] them to want to draw us into their lives
[1:00:57] or is there something that's pushing
[1:00:58] them away the starting point of this
[1:01:01] story is not Elisha it's the woman it's
[1:01:04] the woman and she has wealth and she has
[1:01:06] a big house and so she takes those
[1:01:08] things and she welcomes Travelers that
[1:01:10] are passing by in to take some
[1:01:12] refreshments to put up their feet to
[1:01:14] have a nice meal or a cool drink or
[1:01:16] something her character inside of her
[1:01:18] makes her welcoming to whoever would
[1:01:20] come her way that ought to be the nature
[1:01:22] of the Bride amen God crosses a lot of
[1:01:24] paths today
[1:01:27] amen when you're walking around this
[1:01:29] world it's God Crossing people's paths
[1:01:32] and the question is church is our
[1:01:33] conduct and character causing people to
[1:01:35] draw Us in or is it pushing them
[1:01:38] away cuz sometimes our attitude is the
[1:01:41] thing that pushes him away not what we
[1:01:42] stand for our attitude is the thing that
[1:01:44] pushes him away but Elisha walks by and
[1:01:47] he's God's Prophet he's God's mouthpiece
[1:01:49] for that day and God spoke through
[1:01:51] Elisha and Elisha went a lot of places
[1:01:53] and a lot of people that knew him turned
[1:01:56] him down but here's a gentile woman and
[1:01:58] she brings him in and brings him in and
[1:02:00] over time she realizes that this is a
[1:02:02] special man this is a special man he's a
[1:02:04] holy man and you'll find that with
[1:02:06] Believers all over the world and when
[1:02:07] you talk to them about their testimony
[1:02:09] they'll say there's just something about
[1:02:12] the word that I can't get away from and
[1:02:14] it doesn't matter where they come from
[1:02:16] doesn't matter if they're from India
[1:02:17] from Africa from Canada I've been over
[1:02:19] in Ukraine and Russia people that are
[1:02:22] true believers are drawn to the word and
[1:02:24] they don't even know it they don't even
[1:02:26] know they're a Believer sometimes but
[1:02:28] there's something about when Christ the
[1:02:29] word in your life passes through their
[1:02:31] life that they latch on to it and
[1:02:33] something Springs to life and they
[1:02:34] realize there's something there that I
[1:02:35] want there's something there that I need
[1:02:37] and they'll pull us into their life
[1:02:39] what's the difference church it's a seed
[1:02:41] there's a seed inside that person and
[1:02:43] they don't even know it's there but
[1:02:44] something Springs to life and they start
[1:02:46] to feel things they start to think
[1:02:47] things they start to understand things
[1:02:49] and yearn for things that maybe they had
[1:02:51] never thought of before it's the word
[1:02:53] coming to the word so what do she do do
[1:02:55] with this she says let us make a little
[1:02:57] chamber I pray thee on the wall the
[1:02:59] literal meaning there is let's build him
[1:03:01] an upper room it's on top of the of the
[1:03:04] roof of the house and let us set for him
[1:03:06] there a bed and a table and a stool and
[1:03:08] a Candlestick and it shall be when he
[1:03:10] cometh us that he shall turn and neither
[1:03:12] she wants this man in her life she wants
[1:03:14] this Prophet to be on her property she
[1:03:17] wants the blessing of the word in her
[1:03:18] life amen he's different and she wants
[1:03:20] to do something for him she recognizes
[1:03:22] that he's worthy of it and it fell on a
[1:03:25] day that he came and he turned into the
[1:03:26] chamber and lay there and he said to GES
[1:03:29] a servant call the shunamite and when he
[1:03:31] had called her she stood before him and
[1:03:34] he said unto her say now and he said
[1:03:36] unto him say now unto her behold thou
[1:03:39] has been careful for us with all this
[1:03:40] care what is to be done for thee what
[1:03:42] has thou be spoken for to the king or to
[1:03:45] the captain of the host and she answered
[1:03:47] I dwell among my own people in other
[1:03:48] words she's happy with where she's at
[1:03:50] she's a gentile she's got her family
[1:03:52] she's got relatives around she's got
[1:03:54] what she needs she says I don't need
[1:03:56] anything I didn't do it for that I'm
[1:03:58] just happy to give you a little
[1:04:00] portion and he said what then is to be
[1:04:03] done for her and gesi answered verily
[1:04:06] she had no child and her husband is old
[1:04:08] in other words she hasn't had a child
[1:04:10] and there's no hope of her having a
[1:04:13] child and he said call her and when he
[1:04:16] had called her she stood in the door and
[1:04:18] he said about this season according to
[1:04:20] the time of life Thou shalt Embrace a
[1:04:23] son and she said nay my Lord thou man of
[1:04:26] God do not lie unto thine handmaid she
[1:04:28] is so past hope of an heir of a child
[1:04:32] she didn't ask for this she wasn't
[1:04:34] expecting it she did it out of kindness
[1:04:36] out of the inclination of her own heart
[1:04:38] she acted to support a prophet and now
[1:04:40] he comes and he gives her he tells her
[1:04:43] the desires of her heart and then he
[1:04:45] says you'll have it and she says don't
[1:04:47] play with me like this don't don't play
[1:04:49] games that's that's a serious thing
[1:04:51] that's that's close to my heart and
[1:04:53] you're sitting here telling me I'm going
[1:04:54] to have it don't lie to me like
[1:04:57] that but he doesn't back off because
[1:05:00] it's not him that's making the promise
[1:05:01] Church he's a mouthpiece for God Elisha
[1:05:04] does not have life in himself amen but
[1:05:06] he's got a god behind him that shows him
[1:05:09] what's going to happen and he speaks as
[1:05:11] God speaks to him and he says he's
[1:05:13] saying thus sayith the Lord you're going
[1:05:14] to have a child God's the author of life
[1:05:18] God's the one that brings these things
[1:05:19] and that woman has promised a child and
[1:05:21] not just a child a son an heir a
[1:05:24] continuation of her generations and of
[1:05:26] her family name she's a gentile woman
[1:05:28] she's on the outside of the Israelites
[1:05:30] she has no right and no access to God
[1:05:33] there is nothing that allows her to come
[1:05:35] to God but yet the word comes to her
[1:05:38] hallelujah it's a sovereignty of God
[1:05:40] reaching out to her why because there
[1:05:43] was something in her that would respond
[1:05:45] when God came her way Hallelujah God
[1:05:48] comes to those that will receive him
[1:05:50] amen and this woman this Gentile woman
[1:05:52] is right there with Hannah the mother of
[1:05:55] uh of Samuel he's right there with
[1:05:57] Elizabeth the mother of John she's right
[1:06:00] there with Sarah the mother of Isaac and
[1:06:03] she's a gentile woman that has no
[1:06:05] promise in the word but yet the word
[1:06:07] comes to her and says you're going to
[1:06:08] have this I'm going to give it to you
[1:06:10] and it's the Sovereign working of God
[1:06:12] church that's why we're here this
[1:06:13] morning is The Sovereign working of God
[1:06:16] why because he knew us before the
[1:06:17] foundation of the world he knew us
[1:06:19] before we even had a thought before we
[1:06:21] came into existence and he knew what's
[1:06:23] inside of us and he knew if he came our
[1:06:25] way then would respond to him and we
[1:06:27] would take him at his word
[1:06:28] amen amen unto you I send Elijah the
[1:06:32] prophet he sends his prophets to people
[1:06:35] that will hear the word amen God knows
[1:06:37] what's inside of each and every one of
[1:06:39] us now watch what happens it says and
[1:06:41] the woman conceived and bear a son at
[1:06:44] the season that Elisha had said unto her
[1:06:46] according to the time of life and when
[1:06:47] the child was grown it fell on a day
[1:06:50] that he went out to his father to the
[1:06:51] Reapers and he said unto his father my
[1:06:54] head my head and he said to a lad carry
[1:06:56] him to his mother and when he had taken
[1:06:58] him and brought him to his mother he sat
[1:07:00] on her knees till noon and then died can
[1:07:03] you imagine how she feels about this
[1:07:04] church can you imagine if God heals you
[1:07:07] and then six years later that disease
[1:07:08] comes back on you there's sister Andrea
[1:07:11] Grant over in BC she's had cancer three
[1:07:13] times church and she's been healed three
[1:07:18] times see what's the attitude going to
[1:07:20] be when things take a turn for the worse
[1:07:22] when the word promise seems to have been
[1:07:24] lost that's what what this son is to her
[1:07:26] is he is the word made flesh he is the
[1:07:29] manifestation of the promise of the word
[1:07:31] in her life her word promise has just
[1:07:34] died where is the god of Elijah now
[1:07:37] where's the god of Elisha now where is
[1:07:39] the god that promised it God gives it
[1:07:41] now he takes it away what kind of a God
[1:07:43] would do this when God blesses our
[1:07:46] brothers and their businesses and things
[1:07:48] are flourishing then all of a sudden
[1:07:49] things get tight all of a sudden we're
[1:07:51] staring bankruptcy in the face where is
[1:07:53] the god that gave me my business
[1:07:56] we've had brothers that have and sisters
[1:07:58] that have lost spouses across this
[1:08:00] message just in a moment where is it why
[1:08:03] would God do
[1:08:05] that what's our response when God does
[1:08:07] things like that when God allows it when
[1:08:10] God allows it look at job job lost
[1:08:12] everything except the wife that gave him
[1:08:14] bad
[1:08:17] advice and he said the lord giveth and
[1:08:21] the lord taketh away and he didn't stop
[1:08:24] there he said blessed be the name of the
[1:08:26] Lord good times and bad praise His
[1:08:30] name amen that's the attitude that's the
[1:08:34] attitude God blesses us and then
[1:08:36] sometimes he pulls
[1:08:37] back just to see what you're going to do
[1:08:40] amen we're in a season of change this
[1:08:42] woman was in the season of change and in
[1:08:44] seasons of change you have things that
[1:08:46] are given and you have things that are
[1:08:47] taken away and it's for your good amen
[1:08:51] and you've got to be able to praise God
[1:08:52] through all of those things amen we have
[1:08:54] we we think that the realities of God is
[1:08:56] all the blessings and the Miracles but
[1:08:58] here's the thing you've got to go
[1:08:59] through a time of needing a blessing and
[1:09:00] needing a miracle before you get it You'
[1:09:02] got to go through a battle you've got to
[1:09:04] go through a trial before he can be the
[1:09:05] god of your answers amen it's a yin and
[1:09:07] yang if we wanted to put it that way so
[1:09:09] when the things are pulled back then
[1:09:11] what do we do are we faithful and strong
[1:09:13] giving praise to God as Abraham was or
[1:09:15] are we whiny and petulant like the
[1:09:17] children of Israel when we don't get our
[1:09:19] water for the day or we don't get our
[1:09:20] bread for the
[1:09:22] day we need a checkup this morning
[1:09:24] because this woman is a type of the
[1:09:26] Bride it's a woman that has found favor
[1:09:28] with God and that doesn't mean she
[1:09:30] doesn't have trials or or tribulations
[1:09:33] but a means she's got a rock in a weary
[1:09:34] land that she can go to Every Time those
[1:09:36] things happen we've got a sure
[1:09:38] Foundation we can go to church that God
[1:09:40] has Us in the palm of his hands every
[1:09:42] single
[1:09:43] time watch what she does now it says and
[1:09:45] she went out and laid him on the bed of
[1:09:47] the man of God and shut the door upon
[1:09:49] him and went out and she called unto her
[1:09:51] husband and she said send me I pray thee
[1:09:53] one of the young men and one of the
[1:09:55] asses that I may run to the man of God
[1:09:57] and come again this is almost a casual
[1:09:59] like honey I'm going out for groceries
[1:10:01] and I need somebody to carry it for me
[1:10:03] this is not a woman that's that's
[1:10:05] distraught that's all up in tears or
[1:10:07] throwing a tantrum or or or or just in
[1:10:10] the in the the the depths of Despair but
[1:10:12] she says I'm going to need some help can
[1:10:14] you give me one of the servants to go
[1:10:15] with me I'll be out I got to go see the
[1:10:17] prophet and I'll be right
[1:10:19] back what an
[1:10:21] attitude she's got the promise of the
[1:10:24] word laying dead in her house and she
[1:10:27] says I've got to go out and I'll be back
[1:10:28] in a little bit that's all she says and
[1:10:32] he and her husband said wherefore wilt
[1:10:34] thou go to him today it's neither new
[1:10:35] moon or Sabbath there's two things here
[1:10:38] that man's going to be somewhere on a
[1:10:39] new moon or a Sabbath he's going to be
[1:10:40] somewhere you can find him she's a
[1:10:43] gentile she's not in church and she says
[1:10:46] you're not going to be able to find
[1:10:48] him and you know what she
[1:10:51] says she says and she said unto him
[1:10:56] it shall be well it'll be okay it'll
[1:10:59] work itself out all I know is I got to
[1:11:02] find the prophet and I have a need for
[1:11:05] him therefore I'm going to find him it's
[1:11:06] going to be okay and then she saddled
[1:11:09] and asked and she said to her servant
[1:11:11] drive and go forward slack not thy
[1:11:13] writing for me except I bid thee no
[1:11:15] hysterics no moaning no complaining she
[1:11:17] says go until I tell you to stop don't
[1:11:20] stop for anybody don't stop for anything
[1:11:22] unless I tell you to stop this woman is
[1:11:25] in A desperate need amen and she's not
[1:11:27] letting anything distract
[1:11:30] her got to get to
[1:11:33] Jesus amen so many times what happens is
[1:11:36] we've got a need and it's as I said last
[1:11:38] service it's quick now I lay me down to
[1:11:40] sleep Lord help my need and then we fall
[1:11:42] asleep but no let's press let's lay
[1:11:44] aside everything that would hold us back
[1:11:47] let's not not get distracted by the
[1:11:49] things of this world but say Lord I'm
[1:11:51] coming to you and I'm not going to stop
[1:11:52] until I find you and it'll be well
[1:11:55] that's when it'll truly be well brother
[1:11:58] Braham says this he says now sometimes
[1:11:59] when we meet the requirement we think
[1:12:01] why didn't he
[1:12:03] answer God does that sometimes to see
[1:12:06] what our reaction will be look at the
[1:12:09] shunamite woman for instance see she
[1:12:11] wanted to see he wanted to see what her
[1:12:13] reaction would be and he does that many
[1:12:15] times just to see how we'll react but if
[1:12:19] this is the big if church if we're
[1:12:21] certain that we have met God's
[1:12:22] requirement just stay right with it
[1:12:25] he's got to act he says you hear it he's
[1:12:29] got to act if he made the promise he's
[1:12:31] God and has to keep that promise he's
[1:12:34] God he can't just take it back and say
[1:12:35] well I was mistaken God makes no
[1:12:38] mistakes he's perfect amen so if you're
[1:12:40] resting on the word you can have
[1:12:42] confidence that God is going to fulfill
[1:12:44] it he's perfect his first thought is
[1:12:46] always perfect his first action is
[1:12:48] always perfect his first word is always
[1:12:51] perfect he doesn't have to go back and
[1:12:52] change it we're preaching on the
[1:12:55] realities of
[1:12:56] God what does this look like it looks
[1:13:00] like waiting in faith it looks like
[1:13:02] believing it looks like trusting that's
[1:13:05] part of the realities is that something
[1:13:07] holds you when you don't even think you
[1:13:09] can hold yourself remember what they
[1:13:10] said to brother brandham when his wife
[1:13:12] died and when his daughter died brother
[1:13:13] brandham did you did you hold on to your
[1:13:15] religion he said no My Religion held on
[1:13:17] to me there's something inside of me
[1:13:19] that won't let go even if I wanted to
[1:13:22] sometimes our emotions want to let go
[1:13:25] sometimes our intellect wants to let go
[1:13:27] but there's something deep on the inside
[1:13:29] that says I will not let thee go until
[1:13:32] thou bless
[1:13:33] me Jacob had no hope of wrestling that
[1:13:36] angel to the ground but he says I'm not
[1:13:38] going to let go you're going to have to
[1:13:39] drag me out of here before I let go
[1:13:41] because I came here for answers and I'm
[1:13:43] going to get the blessing that I seek I
[1:13:46] need a reality of God in my life
[1:13:49] amen church if you're tired out this
[1:13:51] morning are you tired out this morning
[1:13:53] do you feel you've lots of BL
[1:13:55] do you feel like you've lost the battle
[1:13:57] this morning stand still hold on to
[1:14:02] God's word amen hold fast to what God
[1:14:06] has said he'll never fail that's what
[1:14:09] believers do they believe the word no
[1:14:12] matter what comes no matter what
[1:14:14] circumstances look like amen why it's
[1:14:16] that word that's inside of us and it's
[1:14:18] pulsating day in and day out and you
[1:14:20] know what keeps us strong church it's
[1:14:21] when we feed the word that's inside of
[1:14:23] us with the same word amen that that's
[1:14:25] the thing that will help hold us day by
[1:14:26] day that'll turn our depression and turn
[1:14:28] our whininess into praise and joy and
[1:14:31] Faith cuz Faith is what's going to hold
[1:14:33] us through all of these things
[1:14:38] amen this woman she went and she came
[1:14:41] unto the man of God to Mount Carmel and
[1:14:43] it came to pass when the man of God saw
[1:14:45] her a far off that he said to gesia
[1:14:47] Servant behold Yonder at shunamite run
[1:14:49] now I pray thee to meet her and say unto
[1:14:52] her is it well with thee is it well with
[1:14:55] thy husband is it well with thy
[1:14:58] child and she answered it Is Well church
[1:15:03] what kind of Faith are we looking at
[1:15:05] here she's not willing to throw in the
[1:15:07] towel until God says it's over it ain't
[1:15:09] done till it's done it's not over till
[1:15:11] the prophet says it's over she's going
[1:15:13] to her access point to God and she says
[1:15:15] until he says it's over I'm believing
[1:15:18] that all is well I've got a promise that
[1:15:20] I've held on to I've lived in the
[1:15:21] realities of that promise every day with
[1:15:23] that boy is a miracle and I'm looking
[1:15:26] for that Miracle to continue because God
[1:15:28] gave me an air to continue on my family
[1:15:31] name we see we read our Bibles we see
[1:15:33] the promises of God and we look and it
[1:15:36] seems like we're at the end of our rope
[1:15:37] and nothing's nothing's happening and
[1:15:39] it's easy to say it's all
[1:15:41] over church we need to grow a backbone
[1:15:45] we need to grow a backbone and say it's
[1:15:46] not over until the word says it over and
[1:15:48] if the word is given then the word never
[1:15:50] ends it never fails amen it's about time
[1:15:52] we got some backbone and Satan started
[1:15:55] walking back depressed because he says
[1:15:56] it is really over now because I can't
[1:15:58] get them off that word and I know what
[1:16:00] happens when people stay with the word
[1:16:02] they overcome Hallelujah when they stay
[1:16:04] with the word they overcome and he walks
[1:16:07] away saying how am I going to do it now
[1:16:09] we need him to start walking away from
[1:16:11] losing some
[1:16:13] battles
[1:16:16] amen start coming with some praise and
[1:16:18] some worship into the battle rather than
[1:16:20] depression and how's it going to work
[1:16:22] out how's God going to do it say God is
[1:16:24] always has made a way through for his
[1:16:26] children and start testifying of what
[1:16:28] God has done so you can build yourself
[1:16:30] up on what he's about to do amen
[1:16:33] hallelujah Hard Times come our way we
[1:16:35] ought to meet it with a mouth of praise
[1:16:37] and worship and faith and trust in his
[1:16:40] name and in his
[1:16:42] word listen to this it says and she said
[1:16:45] did I desire a son of my of my
[1:16:50] Lord no sorry verse 27 I didn't finish
[1:16:53] that it says and when she came she says
[1:16:55] to the servant it's all well and when
[1:16:56] she came to the man of God to the hill
[1:16:58] she caught him by the feet but gesi came
[1:17:01] near to thrust her away and the man of
[1:17:03] God said let her alone for her soul is
[1:17:05] vexed within her and the Lord had hid it
[1:17:08] from me and had not told
[1:17:10] me then she said did I desire a son of
[1:17:14] my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me
[1:17:16] she says I didn't ask for the
[1:17:19] promise I didn't come to you beseeching
[1:17:21] this you came to me and you said this is
[1:17:24] the the word and the promise of the Lord
[1:17:27] she says and now it's
[1:17:30] gone I'm broken I'm hurting I'm in pain
[1:17:35] because you gave and then you took away
[1:17:37] the thing that you said I was going to
[1:17:41] have and he said to gesi GT up thy loins
[1:17:44] and take my staff in thine hand and go
[1:17:46] thy way if thou meet any man salute him
[1:17:49] not and if any salute thee answer him
[1:17:50] not again and lay my staff upon the face
[1:17:53] of the child and the mother of the child
[1:17:55] said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:17:57] liveth I will not leave thee and he
[1:17:59] arose and followed her why she said
[1:18:02] you're the one gave me the son I'm not
[1:18:04] leaving unless you come with me my trust
[1:18:06] is not in your servant my trust is not
[1:18:08] in your Rod my trust is in you as the
[1:18:10] mouthpiece of God to come and make a
[1:18:12] change in this situation amen she says
[1:18:14] you're my only link to life and I'm not
[1:18:16] letting go until I get life back in my
[1:18:18] child and gesi passed on before them and
[1:18:21] laid the staff upon the face of the
[1:18:23] child but there was neither voice nor
[1:18:25] hearing wherefore he went again to meet
[1:18:28] him and told him saying the child is not
[1:18:29] awakened Church what does Elisha do he
[1:18:32] sends his servant with his rod and he
[1:18:34] tells him to touch the boy's Faith with
[1:18:35] it what does the rod always represent
[1:18:38] the law and
[1:18:40] judgment he sends the law ahead it might
[1:18:43] bring Deliverance but it never brings
[1:18:45] life the law took the children of Israel
[1:18:47] out of Egypt but it doesn't restore you
[1:18:50] back to life legalism can protect you
[1:18:53] for so long but it does not give you
[1:18:57] life it can keep a hedge of protection
[1:19:00] about you but what happens inevitably if
[1:19:03] you don't get life is you either become
[1:19:05] a performance-driven Christian where you
[1:19:08] think that your works are good enough to
[1:19:09] get you into heaven and you become a
[1:19:10] Pharisee or you ultimately fail as we
[1:19:13] all do and you fall away because you
[1:19:15] fail
[1:19:16] God legalism is not life it's a
[1:19:20] protection and in the end what a
[1:19:22] Believer does is out of the heart not
[1:19:24] out of of a demand because there's a
[1:19:26] life inside of us that's calling us to
[1:19:28] that word amen but watch now what
[1:19:31] happens and when Elisha was coming into
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:34] house behold the child was dead and laid
[1:19:36] upon his bed and he went in therefore
[1:19:39] and shut the door upon them Twain and
[1:19:40] prayed unto the Lord and he went up and
[1:19:43] lay upon the child okay he prays lays
[1:19:46] upon the child and put his mouth upon
[1:19:48] his mouth his eyes upon his eyes and his
[1:19:49] hands upon his hands and stretched
[1:19:51] himself upon the child and the Flesh of
[1:19:53] the child wax warm now notice the
[1:19:55] initial effect of the prophet's presence
[1:19:58] it warms him
[1:20:00] up he stone cold dead he's probably got
[1:20:04] rigor mortise sitting in he's cold as
[1:20:07] cold can be in that climate and he lays
[1:20:09] on the boy and the body warms up but no
[1:20:12] life comes in we'd say the boy was
[1:20:16] lukewarm can I put it that way this
[1:20:18] morning we're we're trying to bring it
[1:20:20] to the realities of God in our day amen
[1:20:22] the prophet comes and the prophet's pray
[1:20:24] presence only warms up the
[1:20:28] body his first message only warms people
[1:20:33] up but what happens
[1:20:37] next says then he returned and walked in
[1:20:40] the house to and fro see so often we
[1:20:43] think the prophets have it easy but this
[1:20:45] Prophet walked the
[1:20:47] floors walked the
[1:20:50] floors they don't have it easy we don't
[1:20:52] have it easy either Church walk the
[1:20:54] floors what do I do now what do I do now
[1:20:57] nothing's happening Lord at my prayer
[1:20:59] nothing's happening I'm your Prophet
[1:21:01] nothing's
[1:21:02] happening Brother Braham says it this
[1:21:04] way he says so away they went and came
[1:21:07] into the yard and now looked into the
[1:21:09] crowd everybody around wailing and
[1:21:11] screaming he says what a place for Faith
[1:21:15] you cannot depend on the the
[1:21:17] circumstances to provide you what you
[1:21:18] have need of you've got to come with
[1:21:20] what you have need of Amen you've got to
[1:21:22] be ready in the word you've got to be
[1:21:23] planted in the word you've got to be
[1:21:25] settled on who you have believed in that
[1:21:28] he is able to do that which he's
[1:21:30] promised to do in your
[1:21:32] life he says Elisha standing there no
[1:21:35] vision don't know what to do all he
[1:21:37] could do was look around he's got no
[1:21:40] answer the prophet has no answer in
[1:21:43] himself he needs the Lord to speak he
[1:21:45] says there was the father screaming
[1:21:47] there were all the neighbors and
[1:21:48] everybody carrying on well he goes
[1:21:50] around to his little old chamber and the
[1:21:52] woman had the baby laying on the bed so
[1:21:54] he shut everybody out of the room and P
[1:21:57] pulled the door together by himself
[1:21:59] Church you want answers get alone with
[1:22:01] God that's what he's saying shut out all
[1:22:04] the noise turn off the phone tell your
[1:22:07] family don't disturb me for the next two
[1:22:09] hours and go in there and wait on God
[1:22:12] Amen we've got to get serious if we want
[1:22:15] direction if we want leadership if we
[1:22:17] want healing if we want Deliverance
[1:22:18] let's make ourselves serious before god
[1:22:20] let's let him know we want it as much as
[1:22:22] we say we want it amen if if we're
[1:22:24] needful of it let's go do it church if
[1:22:27] we needed money we'd work till our our
[1:22:29] fingers
[1:22:30] bled but we won't spend 10 minutes on
[1:22:32] our knees in
[1:22:35] prayer he says he went over in a corner
[1:22:37] and knelt down and began to pray when he
[1:22:39] got through praying he got up and walked
[1:22:41] up and down the floor back and forth to
[1:22:43] and fro up and down the floor until the
[1:22:46] spirit of God Came Upon him Church we've
[1:22:49] got to know that God is with us and that
[1:22:51] means we've got to wait until he's with
[1:22:52] us we cannot presume we cannot assume
[1:22:55] we've got to wait on him and when we
[1:22:57] know he's with us then we can do
[1:22:58] something in faith otherwise we're going
[1:23:00] to fail every single time Watch What
[1:23:02] Happens it says and he went up and
[1:23:05] stretched himself upon him and the child
[1:23:07] sneezed seven times and the child opened
[1:23:10] his eyes he says when the spirit of God
[1:23:12] come upon him no doubt but what he saw a
[1:23:14] vision he goes over stretches himself on
[1:23:16] top of the baby his nose again its nose
[1:23:19] no
[1:23:21] prayer no prayer why the word of the
[1:23:24] Lord has been spoken to him he doesn't
[1:23:25] have to say anything he just has to do
[1:23:28] now just the nose against his nose lips
[1:23:31] against his lips eyes against his eyes
[1:23:33] hand against his hands and the baby
[1:23:35] sneezed seven times and come to life he
[1:23:37] says what was that that wasn't that
[1:23:39] preacher that was Christ in his Prophet
[1:23:42] that brought that boy back to life
[1:23:45] Hallelujah now you notice here it says
[1:23:47] the child sneezed seven times we're
[1:23:50] talking about the living in the
[1:23:52] realities of God we're talking about the
[1:23:53] word promised for our day and brother
[1:23:55] bam says two times he says I wish I had
[1:23:58] time to get into those seven
[1:24:01] sneezes doesn't say he does or he
[1:24:03] doesn't he just says I wish I had time
[1:24:04] to do it but what does a sneeze do this
[1:24:06] is just me what does a sneeze do it
[1:24:09] clears out the things that ought not to
[1:24:11] be in your body it opens up your
[1:24:13] passageways it allows the Breath of Life
[1:24:16] to come in
[1:24:17] uninhibited this is like a little
[1:24:19] Revival that's going on casting out all
[1:24:22] those things that are caught in his
[1:24:23] lungs and in his throat and in his nose
[1:24:25] and these things amen it flushes out
[1:24:27] those things that aren't supposed to be
[1:24:28] in your body we could put it this way
[1:24:30] Church his starting condition before he
[1:24:32] died was his Alpha condition he was a
[1:24:34] young healthy
[1:24:36] man and then what happens amen he's a
[1:24:39] perfect manifested promise and then he
[1:24:41] has what an event that drops him from
[1:24:43] perfect health almost directly into
[1:24:45] darkness like
[1:24:48] that the alpha Church dropped right into
[1:24:51] darkness
[1:24:54] the promised word is there signs and
[1:24:56] wonders God moving in his people and
[1:24:59] then in just 30 years they drop away
[1:25:01] there are already wolves among you
[1:25:04] you've already left your first
[1:25:06] love and they drop down and they drop
[1:25:08] down the prophetic presence could only
[1:25:10] get him warmed up notice when you read
[1:25:13] in in Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones
[1:25:15] the prophet's first message could only
[1:25:17] get the bones and the Flesh and the
[1:25:18] Senus
[1:25:20] together but there had to come a second
[1:25:23] portion there had to come something that
[1:25:24] followed to bring the breath of life and
[1:25:28] that's what we see in this boy is we see
[1:25:30] that there's a first work that brings
[1:25:32] him to life but there's got to come a
[1:25:34] second work there's got to come a latter
[1:25:36] rain there's got to come something
[1:25:37] behind it that'll bring life back into
[1:25:39] that body CU it's all Fallen apart amen
[1:25:42] but his final condition his Omega
[1:25:44] condition is exactly the same as his
[1:25:46] Alpha condition he's perfectly healthy
[1:25:49] he goes down into a temporary sleep and
[1:25:52] then he wakes up and he's as good as new
[1:25:55] as if it never
[1:25:57] happened it will be worth it all when we
[1:26:01] see Jesus life's trials will seem so
[1:26:03] small when we see Christ one glimpse of
[1:26:05] his dear face all Sorrows will erase so
[1:26:08] bravely run the race till we see Christ
[1:26:11] that young man had no idea what happened
[1:26:13] to him all he knew was I was alive and
[1:26:16] I'm alive
[1:26:18] again Sovereign work of the power of God
[1:26:21] inside of his life amen there was no
[1:26:24] between that promise between the start
[1:26:26] and the Finish there was just a trial of
[1:26:29] faith in the middle that's
[1:26:31] it never had an issue the rest of his
[1:26:33] life as far as we know he died when he
[1:26:36] died no doubt old and and typical of all
[1:26:40] the the rest of the the people of that
[1:26:42] time but God comes in and by Grace
[1:26:44] brings them out of that Darkness black
[1:26:45] back into glorious
[1:26:47] life says and he called unto gazy and
[1:26:50] said call the shunamite so he called her
[1:26:52] and when she was come unto him he said
[1:26:54] take up thy son then she went in and
[1:26:57] fell at his feet and bowed herself to
[1:26:59] the ground and took up her son and went
[1:27:02] out now we always have the story twist
[1:27:05] don't we we think this is the story
[1:27:06] twist remember we read in last service
[1:27:09] we talked about the the woman with the
[1:27:10] cruise of oil and and how everything's
[1:27:13] provided for her and then all of a
[1:27:14] sudden what happens there's death in the
[1:27:17] house and she loses the son of her
[1:27:20] promise the food's not going to run out
[1:27:22] the food didn't run out but her son died
[1:27:23] anyway
[1:27:25] why cuz God's always working on his
[1:27:27] bride he's always working to show
[1:27:29] himself real he's always working to help
[1:27:32] us grow in our faith amen we got to have
[1:27:35] faith for a resurrection and a Rapture
[1:27:36] pretty soon church that means he's going
[1:27:38] to be working in our day-to-day lives
[1:27:40] amen we should never stop and think this
[1:27:42] is it we're done we're not done till
[1:27:45] we're
[1:27:46] gone and Paul would say this in
[1:27:48] Philippians he says not as though I had
[1:27:50] already attained either were already
[1:27:51] perfect if there's somebody that ought
[1:27:53] to be perfect to be that prophet he says
[1:27:56] I don't even look at it but I follow
[1:27:57] after if that I may apprehend that for
[1:28:00] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[1:28:01] Jesus in other words he says I want to
[1:28:04] be what he says I am I don't just want
[1:28:07] to be satisfied with where I'm at I want
[1:28:09] to be the Fulfillment of what he says
[1:28:11] I'm supposed to be and I'm not going to
[1:28:12] stop until I get there I want to be
[1:28:14] found fulfilling everything he says
[1:28:16] about me in his word amen he says
[1:28:20] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:28:22] apprehended Paul spoke with tongues more
[1:28:24] than them he had signs and wonders
[1:28:25] following he had the Holy Spirit
[1:28:27] speaking lip to ear he wrote the
[1:28:28] majority of the Gospel of the New
[1:28:30] Testament and he says I don't even look
[1:28:32] at it don't even dwell on it I'm not
[1:28:35] resting on that he says I count not
[1:28:37] myself to have apprehended I haven't
[1:28:38] made it yet he says I don't act and
[1:28:40] believe that he says but this one thing
[1:28:42] I do forgetting those things which are
[1:28:44] behind and reaching forth into those
[1:28:46] things which are before amen we can't
[1:28:48] rest on our past
[1:28:50] experiences they're there and they did a
[1:28:52] job back then but we need an experience
[1:28:54] today we can't rest on our Laurels we
[1:28:56] can't rest on our works there has to be
[1:28:58] a continuation of God in our lives day
[1:29:00] by day he says one thing I do forgetting
[1:29:03] those things which are behind and
[1:29:05] reaching forth into those things which
[1:29:06] are before I press toward the mark for
[1:29:10] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:29:13] Christ Jesus Paul never let off the
[1:29:16] gas Paul never slacked on his daily
[1:29:19] devotions Paul never stopped praying
[1:29:21] that's it I'm good I'm sealed I got the
[1:29:23] Holy Ghost no let's get forward into
[1:29:25] what God has for his Believers in this
[1:29:28] age back in 2 Kings it says then spake
[1:29:31] Elisha unto the woman whose son had
[1:29:33] restored to life saying arise and go
[1:29:35] thou in thine household and sojourn
[1:29:37] where wheresoever thou can sojourn for
[1:29:40] the Lord hath called for a famine and it
[1:29:42] shall also come upon the land seven
[1:29:44] years now here's more proof she's a
[1:29:46] gentile because a prophet will not send
[1:29:49] you out of the land of
[1:29:50] promise doesn't do it Naomi went out and
[1:29:53] what did she return as bitter she wasn't
[1:29:56] supposed to be outside of the land but
[1:29:57] he says no go out you're not bound
[1:29:59] there's judgment coming to the people
[1:30:01] here they Fallen away from the word
[1:30:03] they've Fallen away from God and so
[1:30:05] famine is coming you don't have to go
[1:30:06] through this Hallelujah you don't have
[1:30:09] to go through the tribulation you don't
[1:30:10] have to go through the Judgment you can
[1:30:12] be set aside so go wherever you can and
[1:30:14] make a
[1:30:16] living right she's not bound to the
[1:30:19] Judgment that they're bound
[1:30:21] to notice now he comes to her she
[1:30:24] doesn't come to him why she's a friend
[1:30:26] of the Prophet brother Bram says it's
[1:30:28] handy to be the friend of a prophet
[1:30:30] sometimes amen he's not telling everyone
[1:30:33] this he's just telling her he's telling
[1:30:36] her the secrets like Jesus said in John
[1:30:39] he says henceforth I call you not
[1:30:40] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:30:42] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[1:30:44] you friends for all things that I have
[1:30:45] heard of my father I've made known unto
[1:30:47] you we're not ignorant we're not
[1:30:50] ignorant of Satan's devices and we're
[1:30:51] not ignorant of what God's trying to do
[1:30:53] in this age that's for sure and then we
[1:30:55] know what he's doing and so he says and
[1:30:57] the woman arose and did after the saying
[1:30:59] of the man of God and she went with her
[1:31:01] household and sojourned in the land of
[1:31:03] the Philistines seven years now we see
[1:31:05] what's happening here this is God not
[1:31:07] God protecting the woman this is God
[1:31:09] protecting his word it's God protecting
[1:31:12] the promised son it's God protecting the
[1:31:14] promise that he gave this woman amen and
[1:31:16] this great Gentile woman with the
[1:31:18] promises warn get out take all of your
[1:31:21] household with you but catch the
[1:31:23] sacrifice because she's a gentile if she
[1:31:25] leaves it behind she loses
[1:31:28] it she has no right of
[1:31:30] redemption she has no right of a kinsman
[1:31:33] redeemer she's a gentile when it's gone
[1:31:35] it's gone and he says get out preserve
[1:31:38] the word preserve the promise go make
[1:31:40] any way you can make it because you
[1:31:42] won't last if you stay here there's
[1:31:43] judgment
[1:31:45] coming so she's got a she's got wealth
[1:31:47] she's got a a large farm it would seem a
[1:31:50] large property she's got tons of money
[1:31:52] she's got ease of life and all these
[1:31:53] things and he says walk away if you want
[1:31:55] to keep the word alive if you want to
[1:31:58] keep your promise alive set it all aside
[1:32:00] and go make a living someplace else
[1:32:02] because there's going to be coming
[1:32:03] judgment here you know I look around
[1:32:05] this church this morning and some of us
[1:32:06] have made some big moves in our lives
[1:32:09] and I'm not just talking about geography
[1:32:11] and me I look at sister Morin and I know
[1:32:13] Sister Brenda's not here they made huge
[1:32:16] moves to get away from
[1:32:18] judgment and today even so they still
[1:32:21] pay a price to a degree with their
[1:32:22] families because they came and accepted
[1:32:24] this
[1:32:25] message why to preserve the
[1:32:28] word that's it I look around this room
[1:32:32] we've got Josh here in the back we've
[1:32:34] got brother Grant and sister Nikki here
[1:32:36] we've got sister Rebecca just moved here
[1:32:38] big moves leaving Comfort leaving
[1:32:43] convenience leaving people you've known
[1:32:45] for many many
[1:32:47] years pastors Ministries
[1:32:50] fellowships have it all maybe and you
[1:32:53] come here and you got to start all over
[1:32:56] again hopefully because the Holy Spirit
[1:32:59] Led
[1:33:00] you but there's almost always a
[1:33:03] sacrifice with following the leading of
[1:33:06] God there's always something we've got
[1:33:08] to give up and there's always something
[1:33:11] though that he's going to give us in
[1:33:12] return amen I look around and church
[1:33:16] don't let this hurt you this morning but
[1:33:18] don't let the knowledge of the sacrifice
[1:33:20] keep you out of the realities of the
[1:33:22] blessing see we can dwell on what we've
[1:33:25] lost for so long that we don't get to
[1:33:27] enjoy what we have right here and we
[1:33:29] don't see it we don't see it amen and
[1:33:32] it's hard again I think of sister Moren
[1:33:35] she was literally pushed away from her
[1:33:37] family brother Mark was not accepted for
[1:33:39] 10 years I think 10
[1:33:41] years being out just an outcast from
[1:33:44] your
[1:33:46] family if she dwell on it it would have
[1:33:48] driven her
[1:33:49] insane and she'd have missed the
[1:33:51] blessings that were all around her if
[1:33:54] all you can see is loss in following God
[1:33:56] you've missed the vision and you've
[1:33:58] absolutely missed the blessing because
[1:34:00] God is not just a God that gives away
[1:34:02] takes away he's a God that gives as well
[1:34:04] you know I miss a lot about being out
[1:34:06] west in Alberta and BC here I only get
[1:34:09] to moose hunt on my own tag every three
[1:34:10] years there I could hunt five species a
[1:34:13] year every year without fail pretty much
[1:34:16] Edmonton has over 300 days of sunshine
[1:34:19] can you imagine Church 300 days of
[1:34:23] sunshine a year
[1:34:24] that's three years worth of New
[1:34:27] Finland Ministries rolling through
[1:34:29] constantly camps special meetings
[1:34:31] hundreds of Believers you can find the
[1:34:34] perfect friend there because there's so
[1:34:36] many to choose
[1:34:37] from I've got to settle for
[1:34:41] Joe
[1:34:43] no but there's an ease that comes with
[1:34:46] some of these things but God didn't send
[1:34:48] us here for ease he sends us for purpose
[1:34:52] and he sends us for what he has in need
[1:34:53] of Amen I miss being able to fly my wife
[1:34:56] out to California for
[1:34:58] $400 or let her go in the car so she can
[1:35:00] go see her family I don't have any blood
[1:35:03] family here I've got family here I
[1:35:05] believe this is family and you treat me
[1:35:06] like family and I'm trusting I'm
[1:35:08] treating you like family but there is a
[1:35:09] difference at times and we don't have
[1:35:12] that my kids don't get to see their
[1:35:13] Grandma all the time barely know my
[1:35:16] dad there's a price to be paid for
[1:35:19] following the leadership of the Holy
[1:35:20] Ghost but there is always always
[1:35:24] always a greater benefit than a price
[1:35:26] that's paid god brother Braham says God
[1:35:29] has no unpaid debts amen I'm a testimony
[1:35:33] of that this morning you know the
[1:35:34] scripture says God loves a cheerful
[1:35:37] Giver God loves a cheerful giver and we
[1:35:39] look at that as opening up our wallet
[1:35:41] and putting money into the tith box and
[1:35:43] the offering box and this is just me
[1:35:45] okay I think God loves a cheerful
[1:35:48] sacrifice when he calls you to give up
[1:35:50] something and you say I'll do it
[1:35:52] cheerfully I'll let it go for his sake
[1:35:55] cheerfully not bemoaning my fate not are
[1:35:58] you kidding me I put so much time and
[1:36:00] effort no Lord you can have it what did
[1:36:04] he sacrifice for us cheerfully
[1:36:07] willingly his own body his own
[1:36:10] life God loves a cheerful Giver Jesus
[1:36:13] said in
[1:36:14] Luke give and it shall be given to
[1:36:18] you good
[1:36:20] measure see we give light and FL
[1:36:26] we just give what we're supposed to give
[1:36:27] but he says when he gives it back he'll
[1:36:29] give it in a good measure press down
[1:36:31] shaken together and running over shall
[1:36:34] men give into your bosom for with the
[1:36:36] same measure that you meet with all it
[1:36:38] shall be measured to you again God has
[1:36:40] no unpaid debts now watch what he says
[1:36:43] because he's talking about this little
[1:36:45] widow woman he says a little woman Widow
[1:36:47] came by and she only had three pennies
[1:36:50] all of her living and now what would you
[1:36:52] have done if you'd have stood there he
[1:36:54] said you'd see that little woman put
[1:36:56] them three pennies in you'd run and say
[1:36:58] oh no sister don't do that don't do that
[1:37:00] because we got plenty in here and we
[1:37:01] don't need that more to the point her
[1:37:03] money she was putting in would not make
[1:37:05] a lick of
[1:37:06] difference three mites
[1:37:10] worthless it's like somebody giving a
[1:37:12] dollar in
[1:37:13] tithes don't stop doing it because
[1:37:16] that's a blessing to you but the simple
[1:37:18] fact is a dollar and TI is not going to
[1:37:20] make a difference in this church but you
[1:37:22] give it nonetheless
[1:37:24] why because there's a promise behind it
[1:37:27] weed go to that woman and say sister
[1:37:30] sister sister you don't need to do it
[1:37:33] keep your money keep your money you got
[1:37:35] kids you don't have a husband you got
[1:37:37] kids all around you keep your money
[1:37:38] sister we don't need
[1:37:41] it he says but Jesus never told her not
[1:37:44] to do it he let her go ahead and do it
[1:37:46] why because he knew he had something for
[1:37:49] her down the road a little something
[1:37:52] better he says you see so he just let
[1:37:54] her God loves a cheerful Giver it always
[1:37:58] takes sacrifice to follow the will of
[1:38:00] God Amen it is not the easy Road
[1:38:03] remember what he said in Matthew 7 wide
[1:38:05] is the gate broad is the way that leadth
[1:38:07] to destruction and many there will be
[1:38:10] that go
[1:38:11] therein the easy road is usually not
[1:38:13] God's Road scripturally speaking and if
[1:38:16] you look around nobody gets a an easy
[1:38:18] path to adoption nobody gets an easy
[1:38:21] path to position to influence
[1:38:24] to power they don't do it and the ones
[1:38:26] that do fail and fail and fail and fail
[1:38:30] because they didn't go through God's
[1:38:32] program amen but when we can go
[1:38:34] willingly
[1:38:36] cheerfully in the way that God calls us
[1:38:38] though include sacrifice what a blessing
[1:38:40] he lays out for us Amen on the other
[1:38:42] side of
[1:38:43] it so this woman goes away she leaves
[1:38:46] everything behind gives up all of her
[1:38:48] wealth and influence and position Great
[1:38:50] Farm whatever it might be and she walks
[1:38:52] away it says and it came to pass at the
[1:38:54] seven years end that the woman returned
[1:38:56] out of the land of the Philistines and
[1:38:58] she went forth to cry unto the king for
[1:39:00] her house and for her land this is what
[1:39:02] we said before that she has no kinsman
[1:39:05] redeemer she has no right to a land
[1:39:07] every Israelite has a right to the land
[1:39:09] and they can buy it back at any time she
[1:39:11] has no rights so she's got to go to the
[1:39:14] king now what about that son what about
[1:39:17] the word promise now the word has grown
[1:39:20] the promise has grown he's a man now he
[1:39:22] needs an inheritance he needs a place to
[1:39:25] set down Roots again and she's going to
[1:39:28] bad and saying now the word has to come
[1:39:30] into full fulfillment you didn't just
[1:39:32] give me to him so I could have him but
[1:39:34] now he's got an inheritance that's
[1:39:35] supposed to be for him as well I need to
[1:39:37] get his inheritance from her Jews could
[1:39:40] always rely if nothing else even without
[1:39:42] money on the Year of
[1:39:43] Jubilee but you could always buy it back
[1:39:45] if you had the money she's has to go to
[1:39:48] the king for this amen she hasn't got a
[1:39:50] kinsman
[1:39:51] redeemer she's not tied into the law but
[1:39:55] watch what's happening and the King
[1:39:56] talked with gesi the servant of the man
[1:39:58] of God saying tell me I pray thee all
[1:40:00] the great things that Elijah had done
[1:40:02] and it came to pass as he was telling
[1:40:04] the King how he have restored a dead
[1:40:05] body to life that behold the woman whose
[1:40:07] son he have restored to life cried to
[1:40:09] the king for her house and for her land
[1:40:11] and gesi said oh Lord my king oh King my
[1:40:15] Lord oh King this is the woman and this
[1:40:16] is her son whom Elisha restored to Life

[1:40:31] in there's no coincidence as we run into
[1:40:34] people we run into situations and we say
[1:40:36] well that was
[1:40:37] handy who' have thought God thought God
[1:40:42] knew God placed you God placed them
[1:40:45] whatever it might be God has set things
[1:40:47] up he ordains the footsteps of his
[1:40:50] children the gahaz is there talking the
[1:40:53] king king says hey tell me about Elisha
[1:40:55] tell me all the great things he's done
[1:40:56] gy says well the greatest thing I've
[1:40:58] ever seen is that he he he raised a dead
[1:41:00] boy to life and this woman comes in he
[1:41:02] says there's the woman that's her you
[1:41:04] can ask her there's the son there's the
[1:41:07] proof ask them all about it they'll tell
[1:41:11] you and this woman comes in with a need
[1:41:14] right as the king is listening to her
[1:41:16] testimony
[1:41:19] Hallelujah the very day she makes her
[1:41:21] petition is the day that the king is
[1:41:22] talking about her
[1:41:24] says and the King asked the
[1:41:26] woman and when the king asked the woman
[1:41:28] she told him she gave her
[1:41:31] testimony and so the king appointed unto
[1:41:33] her a certain officer saying restore all
[1:41:36] that was hers and all the fruits of the
[1:41:38] field since the day she left the land
[1:41:43] even until now Hallelujah he doesn't say

[1:44:31] Temple of the Holy Ghost he will restore
[1:44:33] his Eden he will restore everything that
[1:44:36] death killed that's right now the only
[1:44:39] way it can ever remain dead is let it
[1:44:42] lay in the wrong
[1:44:44] place that's something we have to change
[1:44:47] sometimes is we've got to let him move
[1:44:49] us to where we can grow and prosper in
[1:44:52] the word
[1:44:54] Amen brother Josh is leaving to go do
[1:44:57] that sister Rebecca is coming to do that

[1:45:10] place he says but if it falls in the
[1:45:13] right place it's got to come back to

[1:45:46] preeminence and then sit back and watch

[1:46:25] morning amen God restored the woman's
[1:46:28] promise it's not just the woman now it's

[1:46:32] inheritance that they lost as well he's
[1:46:34] giving them the everything they always
[1:46:36] had and all the benefits of what they
[1:46:39] lost they've come now in the presence of
[1:46:42] a
[1:46:43] king and that's where we've come as a
[1:46:45] bride we've come in the presence of a
[1:46:46] king we don't go to a prophet now that's
[1:46:49] what people did for so long with brother
[1:46:51] Bram I believe that's why he had to go
[1:46:53] on was because we were stopping at
[1:46:54] Eleazar instead of going into the tent
[1:46:57] with Isaac amen but now we're in the
[1:46:59] we're in the presence of the king and
[1:47:02] like we talked about Esther he's
[1:47:03] extended his scepter of Grace and says
[1:47:05] whatever you want up to half the
[1:47:08] kingdom we'll go splitsies on it you can
[1:47:11] have half whatever you have need of I'll
[1:47:14] give it to
[1:47:15] you that's the unmerited favor and Grace
[1:47:18] that he's extended to the bride this
[1:47:20] morning amen the king says I will
[1:47:22] restore rest I will restore you know
[1:47:25] what that means Church you can't have a
[1:47:28] restoration if you haven't lost
[1:47:30] something and sometimes that's where
[1:47:32] we've got to be honest and say I've lost
[1:47:35] something sometimes we've lost like
[1:47:37] David the joy of our
[1:47:40] Salvation sometimes we lost our peace
[1:47:42] sometimes we've lost our
[1:47:43] rest sometimes we've lost our
[1:47:47] health sometimes we've lost our
[1:47:51] Direction we've got to go back to the
[1:47:53] king and say would you restore
[1:47:56] it would you restore it I've lost my
[1:47:59] North
[1:48:00] Star I've lost that rock in a weary land
[1:48:03] I don't know where I'm
[1:48:05] at but I'm trying to keep your word and
[1:48:08] I want to put your word in
[1:48:10] preeminence and when you do that he
[1:48:13] steps in he says I'll do anything you
[1:48:14] ask me to do because when the word's in
[1:48:17] preeminence you'll ask according to the
[1:48:19] word amen and that takes you right into
[1:48:21] the perfect will of God God Amen
[1:48:24] sometimes our Miracle is to get
[1:48:26] something sometimes our Miracle is to
[1:48:28] hold on to something amen it's no
[1:48:30] different it's the same God it's the
[1:48:31] same Faith it's the same strength but
[1:48:33] he's there to do above and beyond what
[1:48:35] we could ever ask or think amen what put
[1:48:38] the word first come into His presence
