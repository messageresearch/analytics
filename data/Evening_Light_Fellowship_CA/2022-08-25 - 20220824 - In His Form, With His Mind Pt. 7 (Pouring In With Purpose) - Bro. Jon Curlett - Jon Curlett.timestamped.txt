[43:23] or we appreciate those things
[43:26] the lord the never failing portion is
[43:29] your word that said you be with us
[43:31] lord that where two or three would be
[43:33] gathered in your name there you would be
[43:34] in the midst of us lord and lord
[43:36] sometimes our emotions lead us wrong
[43:38] sometimes sensations lead us wrong lord
[43:41] but your word will never lead us astray
[43:42] and so we're resting on that promise
[43:44] this evening lord that as we gather for
[43:46] one purpose and that's to sit under the
[43:48] hearing of the word lord to raise your
[43:50] name lord to lift up praises to these th
[43:53] this roof lord we pray that you would
[43:55] just now be with us
[43:57] lord that you have moved me aside lord
[43:58] that you have moved the hearers aside
[44:00] lord that the word would come directly
[44:02] into the soul and anchor there lord that
[44:04] it would discern the very thoughts and
[44:06] intents of the hearts that are here this
[44:07] evening

[44:10] bodies as well lord many sick amongst us
[44:13] lord we pray your gracious touch to them

[44:23] amen
[44:24] amen god bless you if you would turn
[44:25] your scriptures to acts chapter 17
[44:29] and acts chapter 17
[44:31] and it's good to be back in church
[44:33] welcome back
[44:34] our our distant travelers amen the
[44:36] colombo's back sister lily and sister
[44:38] elise and of course mr and mrs joshua
[44:41] colombo amen it's good to have them here
[44:43] and then of course brother garfield
[44:45] grant and his family we certainly want
[44:46] to welcome you my brother and your whole
[44:48] family and man god is good and then
[44:51] these days it's uh very difficult to
[44:52] travel and not have some sort of hiccup
[44:54] so to get everyone back and more or less
[44:56] on time and in one piece it's uh
[44:59] it's a good thing amen i mean glad to be
[45:02] here this evening acts chapter 17
[45:04] verse 22 says then paul stood in the
[45:06] midst of mars hill and said ye men of
[45:08] athens i perceive that in all things ye
[45:11] are too superstitious
[45:12] for as i passed by and beheld your
[45:14] devotions i found an altar with this
[45:16] inscription to the unknown god whom
[45:19] therefore ye ignorantly worship him
[45:21] declare i unto you
[45:23] god had not made the world and all the
[45:25] things or god that made the world and
[45:27] all things therein seen that he is lord
[45:30] of heaven and earth dwelleth not in
[45:32] temples made with hands neither is
[45:34] worshipped with men's hands as though he
[45:36] needed anything seen he giveth to all
[45:38] life and breath and all things
[45:41] and hath made of one blood all nations
[45:44] of men for to dwell on all the face of
[45:46] the earth and had determined the times
[45:48] before appointed and the bounds of their
[45:50] habitation
[45:51] that they should seek the lord if haply
[45:53] they might feel after him and find him
[45:56] though he be not far from every one of
[45:58] us
[45:59] for we in him we live and move and have
[46:03] our being as certain also of your own
[46:05] poets have said for we also are also his
[46:09] offspring
[46:10] for as much then as we are the offspring
[46:12] of god we ought not to think that the
[46:14] godhead is like unto gold or silver or
[46:16] stone grave him by art and man's device
[46:20] amen god bless his word you may be
[46:21] seated this evening amen
[46:23] i'm going to be continuing on our our
[46:25] series on in his form and with his mind
[46:28] and i want to continue with a subtitle
[46:30] this evening of pouring in with purpose
[46:32] and for those that missed almost half
[46:34] the church here tonight we spoke last
[46:36] service about the emptying out and and
[46:38] before they could have a pentecostal
[46:39] outpouring before they could receive the
[46:41] baptism of the holy ghost they had to
[46:43] get emptied out they had to get cleaned
[46:44] out they had to get scoured out they had
[46:46] to get themselves set aside so that god
[46:48] could come in and live inside of them by
[46:50] the holy ghost amen we talked about even
[46:52] before that how when god does something
[46:54] he often does it suddenly amen it seems
[46:56] like you're sitting and you're waiting
[46:57] and you're waiting and the promise is
[46:59] giving and nothing's happening oft times
[47:01] you'll see even things are getting worse
[47:02] and worse and worse so they're
[47:03] degenerating and then all of a sudden
[47:05] what happens is god moves and he makes
[47:06] his word happen he brings the
[47:08] fulfillment of the promise and you on
[47:10] you you then understand it has nothing
[47:12] to do with what i could see or what i
[47:14] could feel or the circumstances that
[47:15] were around it amen but god does it in
[47:17] his time and in his season and he does
[47:19] it perfectly every single time when god
[47:21] does it he does it perfectly and then
[47:23] when we looked at what happened on the
[47:25] day of pentecost it took them 10 days to
[47:27] get to the place that they needed to be
[47:29] and we know that after this peter was a
[47:31] changed man
[47:32] remember when we've read the scripture
[47:33] many times where jesus told peter he
[47:35] says when you're converted strengthen
[47:36] thy brethren and that is a man that had
[47:38] the revelation of who jesus christ was
[47:40] he had power over sickness and devils
[47:42] amen he had cast them out under the
[47:44] ministry he had with christ while he was
[47:46] on this earth but he had to come to an
[47:48] upper room experience where he died and
[47:50] something else started to live inside of
[47:52] him amen and before this we know peter
[47:54] was inclined towards violence he was a
[47:56] right-wing zealot he was big into
[47:57] politics he was big into the the freedom
[47:59] of israel and these different things and
[48:01] he had deep spiritual revelation but yet
[48:03] he was still tied to the to the things
[48:05] and the thoughts of the world in so many
[48:07] ways and we know that when it really
[48:08] counted peter cracked under the pressure
[48:10] didn't he
[48:11] when it could when it came time for him
[48:13] to stand and be counted then he wouldn't
[48:15] be counted and not only that but he
[48:16] reverted back to his old nature and that
[48:18] was to curse and say i know nothing of
[48:20] this man i'm not a part of this christ
[48:22] that you're speaking of amen
[48:24] what he needed something inside him that
[48:26] would anchor and hold him when the times
[48:27] got tough and he wasn't ready to stand
[48:29] there until he had his upper room
[48:30] experience was he a child before this
[48:33] was he a child of god
[48:35] he was always a child of god amen does
[48:37] our actions don't change who we are
[48:40] right they just change how god responds
[48:42] to us and what he can trust us with but
[48:44] peter was always a child of god god can
[48:45] see the seed gene inside of each and
[48:47] every one of us but god has to bring us
[48:49] to a place where he can use us and he
[48:51] was bringing peter and 119 others to a
[48:54] place where he could be used amen and he
[48:56] had to bring him someplace where his
[48:58] identity got lost and another identity
[49:00] came into him amen we saw how it was god
[49:02] the father above us we saw how it was
[49:04] god stepping down into christ and the
[49:06] whole point of this series of in his
[49:07] form with his mind is to show the
[49:09] progression of god changing his form
[49:11] from from from the great god elohim the
[49:13] self-existing one into a pillar of light
[49:15] a pillar of fire down into christ and
[49:17] now he stepped down into a multi-member
[49:19] body called the bride of jesus christ
[49:21] amen and that is the only christ this
[49:23] world is going to see
[49:24] amen they don't see him when he comes
[49:26] down to get us we meet him in the clouds
[49:27] they don't see him the only time they
[49:29] see him later is when we come back with
[49:30] him isn't that right so the only christ
[49:32] they'll see in this day is going to be
[49:34] what the manifestation of the sons and
[49:35] daughters of god on this earth amen
[49:39] now we read in the last service this
[49:41] quote and it kind of tells us what peter
[49:43] needed
[49:45] and i want to just for the sake of those
[49:46] that didn't hear perhaps and just to
[49:48] remind ourselves of what the prophet of
[49:50] god said he said god trains his men
[49:53] then he anoints them gives them
[49:55] experience takes them through the rigid
[49:57] training down through the sands of
[49:59] bernie's burning punishment trying and
[50:01] testing not only does he do that to his
[50:04] prophets but he does it to his children
[50:07] every son that cometh to god must be
[50:09] chastened and tried tested by his word
[50:12] because he says what see when the pinch
[50:14] comes the strong time when it faces
[50:17] death are you able to stand there on the
[50:19] word of god and say god said so that
[50:22] settles it that's what he's looking for
[50:24] somebody that can stand asher that has a
[50:26] foundation that can't be moved it's not
[50:28] built on sand but it's built on rocks so
[50:30] that when the storms of light come when
[50:32] the impressions of this world when the
[50:33] influences line against us then what
[50:36] happens is we stand there and say god
[50:37] said so and i'm going to stay with what
[50:39] he said amen peter had lots of training
[50:41] when he was with christ on this earth
[50:43] amen but he needed more than just
[50:45] unanointing because he had an anointing
[50:47] jesus breathed on them and he he told
[50:49] them he said go out and cast out devils
[50:51] and healing my name and these things he
[50:52] had an anointing he had an authority
[50:54] given to him but he needed the anointing
[50:56] amen because it wasn't just one christ
[50:58] because brother brahm talks but he says
[51:00] if there's going to be false christs
[51:01] that means there also has to be real
[51:03] christs on the earth and that is what
[51:05] anointed ones the anointed ones not just
[51:07] anointed ones but the anointed ones and
[51:09] peter had to become a modern-day christ
[51:11] he had to be an anointed one that could
[51:13] do the same things that jesus did amen
[51:16] so that when the time came down and he
[51:17] had to choose between his finances in
[51:19] the word he take the word when it came
[51:21] time to choose between his job and the
[51:23] word then he'd take the word his health
[51:25] and the word his head and his word and
[51:26] the word he choose the word every time
[51:28] until he even gave his life and was
[51:30] crucified upside down amen
[51:33] but i want to talk about what happened
[51:34] on that day of pentecost in the upper
[51:36] room because as we're talking about god
[51:38] moving from form to form we want to see
[51:40] that it didn't just start there but it's
[51:42] continued all the way down through the
[51:43] ages to even today in this age to where
[51:46] every son and daughter when they receive
[51:47] the holy spirit something happens to
[51:49] them that happened to peter and those
[51:50] 119 others on that day amen and this is
[51:53] about the church
[51:55] this is about the called out ones these
[51:56] are about the anointed ones these are
[51:58] the ones that god has chosen for this
[52:00] age for a very specific service or
[52:03] purpose amen and i want to dig into what
[52:05] happened on the day of pentecost because
[52:07] if you know what happened then you'll
[52:08] know what god has for you you know what
[52:11] god has called you to be and why he's
[52:13] even done it in the first place amen we
[52:15] don't just get the holy ghost so that if
[52:17] we die then we resurrect and go
[52:20] to heaven to meet him later and if we
[52:22] have the holy ghost we don't just get it
[52:23] so we can go on a rapture
[52:25] i mean that's where we're going because
[52:27] of it that's the destination that's what
[52:28] we're sealed to but between then and now
[52:31] now and then rather something else is
[52:33] happening and god has a purpose for
[52:34] everyone that has the holy ghost on this
[52:36] on this planet amen
[52:38] now we know what happened in the upper
[52:40] room was the new birth that's what we
[52:42] call it when you get the holy ghost we
[52:43] call that the new birth and it's not
[52:45] just a an anointing on on your on your
[52:47] flesh remember brother branham says you
[52:49] can have the holy ghost anointing on
[52:50] your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell
[52:53] why because it's just something that's
[52:54] around you but it's not something that's
[52:56] in you but when you're sealed he says
[52:58] your soul is sealed to the day of your
[52:59] redemption which is the rapture and the
[53:01] resurrection
[53:03] the prophet of god would say look christ
[53:05] in you makes him the center of life of
[53:09] the revelation now i want you to notice
[53:11] there he says the center of what the
[53:13] doctrine
[53:14] no he says the center of the life of the
[53:17] revelation that means that there's
[53:19] something that comes out of every
[53:21] revelation that he gives you and it's
[53:22] life
[53:23] it's a way of being it's a way of doing
[53:25] it's a way of thinking it has an effect
[53:28] on you it's not just intellectual
[53:29] knowledge but there's a life that comes
[53:31] from that revelation he says that is
[53:33] what christ is is not just a revelation
[53:35] but it's a life behind that revelation
[53:38] right he says christ's life in you makes
[53:40] him the center of the revelation christ
[53:43] in the bible makes the bible the
[53:44] complete revelation of christ christ in
[53:47] you makes you the complete revelation of
[53:50] the whole thing see what god is trying
[53:53] to do he's trying to take it off the
[53:55] pages and put it into living living
[53:58] people
[53:59] he says what is the new birth then you'd
[54:01] say well brother bryan what is the new
[54:03] birth he says it's the revelation of
[54:05] jesus christ personally to you amen he
[54:08] says see
[54:10] so there's a revelation that you have to
[54:12] have and there's a revelation that i
[54:14] have to have and that revelation is not
[54:16] always the exact same thing and we'll
[54:18] see as we go through here he says not
[54:20] you joined a church you shook a hand you
[54:22] done something different you said a
[54:23] creed you promised to live by a coat of
[54:25] rules but christ the bible he is the
[54:28] word that was revealed to you and no
[54:30] matter what anybody says or what takes
[54:32] place it's christ he says pastor priest
[54:35] whatever it might be it's christ in you
[54:38] that is the revelation that the church
[54:40] was built on and everything else is
[54:42] shifting sands and everything else will
[54:44] fail
[54:45] he says what is it
[54:47] it's christ being revealed that he is
[54:49] the word
[54:50] can somebody pass this move this forward
[54:52] and it's christ being revealed that he
[54:54] is the word and when the word is
[54:57] revealed it expresses itself see this is
[55:00] the key to the whole thing when the word
[55:02] is revealed it will express itself so a
[55:05] revelation without an expression is what
[55:08] intellectuality
[55:10] right it's dead it doesn't mean there's
[55:12] not some life in it but there's no life
[55:14] has come out so it's only intellectual
[55:16] to that point he says when the word is
[55:17] revealed it will express itself we
[55:20] preached on this that god's word cannot
[55:21] return unto him void god doesn't come to
[55:24] send us an intellectual representation
[55:26] god comes to do what give us life and
[55:29] that more abundantly
[55:31] so what it has to be expressed and
[55:33] manifested
[55:35] not just expressed through word but
[55:36] expressed through life he says that's
[55:38] god's purpose for jesus christ was to
[55:40] express himself to take his own laws and
[55:43] live by his laws and fulfill his law by
[55:45] death and christ god died in flesh in
[55:48] order to condemn sin in the flesh that
[55:51] he might bring to himself a glorious
[55:53] pride redeem back that will believe only
[55:57] in the word of god
[55:58] he says and she will not swap it like
[56:00] eve did for intellectual conceptions of
[56:03] men what high revelations without a life
[56:06] behind them
[56:07] he says you see it that's christ's idea
[56:09] that's god is the god's idea the new
[56:12] birth reveals this
[56:14] what the new birth reveals a bride that
[56:16] will only believe the word of god and
[56:18] she will manifest it amen
[56:20] i love great doctrine i love great
[56:22] emotion i love i love the praise and the
[56:25] worship and the songs and the services
[56:27] and these things but that's not it
[56:30] that's what sets an atmosphere for it
[56:31] but that's not it he says there's got to
[56:33] be a manifestation that comes out of
[56:35] this amen the new birth is someone that
[56:37] will not only believe it but they'll
[56:39] live it
[56:40] amen
[56:41] he says the new birth is christ is a
[56:43] revelation god has revealed to you this
[56:46] great mystery and that's a new birth he
[56:48] says now what are you going to do when
[56:50] you get all that group together what all
[56:52] the ones that have a revelation of
[56:54] christ
[56:55] in who
[56:57] in themselves
[56:59] i can't have brother mark's revelation
[57:00] of christ
[57:02] because that's for him and it's going to
[57:04] be specific to him because it's a
[57:05] multi-member body he's going to show a
[57:07] portion of christ that maybe i won't
[57:10] so he's got to have his revelation
[57:11] sister moines has to have one brother
[57:13] gerald has to have one sister brenda
[57:14] brother bob we all have to have our
[57:16] portion of that revelation because
[57:19] that's what we've got to live
[57:20] now that doesn't exclude us from doing
[57:22] something in the word because i don't
[57:24] have that revelation no we're to be
[57:25] obedient to every word of it but the
[57:27] expression the full manifestation of
[57:29] that is going to be in piecemeal from
[57:31] each and every one of us in that bright
[57:32] body because together we're the perfect
[57:34] expression
[57:35] i'm not the perfect expression i'm the
[57:37] perfect expression of the little portion
[57:39] that he's given to me
[57:40] amen that takes the pressure off doesn't
[57:42] it that i don't have to be all things
[57:46] i've got to just be what he told me to
[57:47] be what he's called me to be amen
[57:49] so when you have a revelation of your
[57:51] part and i have a revelation of my part
[57:53] then what happens he says what
[57:56] he says oh if the church only knew its
[57:58] position no he says where the revelation
[58:01] is perfectly in harmony so if you know
[58:03] your place and i know my place then what
[58:05] happens we can fit together and there's
[58:07] no bumps
[58:08] right there's no budding heads and
[58:10] knuckles is there why because i know my
[58:12] spot and you know your spot and we're
[58:13] not worried about anything else
[58:15] we just fit right in the way we're
[58:16] supposed to there's no friction then why
[58:19] because it's revelation built on
[58:20] revelation and we're just being molded
[58:22] and tied and joined together like it
[58:24] talks about in ephesians
[58:26] he says what now what are you going to
[58:27] do when you get all that group together
[58:29] where the revelation is perfectly in
[58:31] harmony and god expressing it through
[58:33] his word by the same actions the same
[58:36] things that he did making the word
[58:38] manifest
[58:39] oh if the church only knew its position
[58:42] it will one day then the rapture will go
[58:45] when it knows what it is
[58:48] let me say that that's a revelation only
[58:50] god can reveal
[58:51] amen i can't give it to you i can preach
[58:53] the word time blue in the face but god
[58:55] has to open your eyes and your heart to
[58:57] what it is you're supposed to be doing
[58:58] on this earth right in this age right
[59:00] now amen because it's the revelation of
[59:02] christ in you
[59:04] i've got the revelation for christ to me
[59:06] and i'm getting the revelation of christ
[59:07] to me you've got to make sure you're
[59:08] getting the revelation of christ in you
[59:11] amen and i don't believe we fully got it
[59:13] yet because the prophet of god said when
[59:15] we do the rapture will go
[59:17] so i believe we see portions of it and
[59:19] we see bits of it and we have moments
[59:21] and situations where we see the word
[59:23] just come out so perfectly and
[59:24] beautifully and we look back and we say
[59:26] whoa
[59:27] what happened there
[59:29] that's not the way i used to do that
[59:32] anybody else would have done something
[59:33] different that wasn't sealed with the
[59:34] holy ghost but out of that came the word
[59:37] and it was christ coming out of you and
[59:39] it's christ coming out of me manifesting
[59:41] in the situations in the lives that we
[59:43] live each and every day amen
[59:45] but we're coming to the place now where
[59:47] we're what we're stepping into that true
[59:49] place where we know what he's doing and
[59:51] what he wants done brother branham talks
[59:52] about it different parts but i don't
[59:54] believe we fully realize it yet
[59:56] i don't believe we do
[1:00:00] paul said this
[1:00:02] for we know in part
[1:00:04] and we prophesy in part
[1:00:06] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:00:09] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:00:10] away
[1:00:12] the prophet of god said when that which
[1:00:13] is perfect has come then that which is
[1:00:15] in part shall be done away with he says
[1:00:17] perfect redeeming
[1:00:19] unadulterated love of the holy ghost
[1:00:22] into a human soul that's passed from
[1:00:24] dead unto life amen that's what he says
[1:00:27] that that perfection looks like when it
[1:00:29] comes amen is that redeeming perfect
[1:00:32] unadulterated love of the holy spirit
[1:00:34] he'd say later on he said but when that
[1:00:36] which is perfect it has come that which
[1:00:38] is in part shall be done away with see
[1:00:40] that perfect what is perfect he says
[1:00:43] love
[1:00:43] what is love god so let us lay aside all
[1:00:47] these little dead works and ordinances
[1:00:49] and go on to perfection he says you see
[1:00:52] we per were perfected through christ and
[1:00:54] how do we get into it by holy spirit
[1:00:56] baptism all right what happens you've
[1:00:59] passed from death unto life well do i
[1:01:02] shake and jump and do it he says you
[1:01:04] don't you don't have to do nothing
[1:01:06] you've already done it what was your
[1:01:09] part die
[1:01:11] your power was to die
[1:01:13] his part is to make you live again amen
[1:01:16] he says god brought you from death unto
[1:01:18] life and you're alive he says then the
[1:01:21] fruits of your life show it you don't
[1:01:23] you don't you don't produce those fruits
[1:01:25] of your own uh making or effort it just
[1:01:28] comes out of you
[1:01:30] amen as the prophet god would say sheep
[1:01:32] bear wool
[1:01:33] they don't have to stop and think about
[1:01:35] okay i'm gonna push out a bit of wall
[1:01:37] tonight but this comes out of them
[1:01:39] naturally he says by your fruits you're
[1:01:41] going to know them the holy spirit
[1:01:42] fruits are going to come out of a life
[1:01:44] that's full of the love of god amen
[1:01:47] but that's not the end of it amen it's
[1:01:49] not the end of it you get the holy
[1:01:50] spirit you're sealed to the day of your
[1:01:51] redemption but that's not it there's
[1:01:54] more from there and the pro and and the
[1:01:56] apostle paul talks about it
[1:01:58] amen because we get a sea a seal and it
[1:02:00] seals our soul
[1:02:02] until what we go on that rapture in that
[1:02:04] resurrection but when we come back to
[1:02:06] first corinthians 13 the apostle paul
[1:02:08] says when i was a child i spake as a
[1:02:11] child i understood as a child i thought
[1:02:14] as a child but when i became a man i put
[1:02:16] away childish things
[1:02:18] but then he says for now we see through
[1:02:20] a glass darkly
[1:02:22] he's the apostle he's the prophet of the
[1:02:24] age he's got the holy ghost he's sealed
[1:02:26] to the day of his redemption and he says
[1:02:29] now we see through a glass darkly
[1:02:32] that means he says i don't understand it
[1:02:35] all yet i'm not fully mature yet i'm not
[1:02:38] where i'm going to be eventually
[1:02:40] he says there's some place i've got to
[1:02:42] go with this holy ghost baptism there's
[1:02:44] something that's got to happen beyond
[1:02:45] this new birth and i'm going to have to
[1:02:47] progress towards it amen
[1:02:50] he's not talking to unbelievers he's
[1:02:52] talking to holy ghost-filled believers
[1:02:54] and he's saying you're only seen through
[1:02:55] a glass darkly
[1:02:57] he says but then i'll see face-to-face
[1:03:01] now i know in part but then shall i know
[1:03:04] even as also i am known
[1:03:06] so what he says now we see through a
[1:03:08] glass darkly that's like speaking as a
[1:03:10] child acting as a child he says but
[1:03:12] there comes a place where you step out
[1:03:13] from behind the tinted glass and you
[1:03:16] understand what this is all about and
[1:03:17] you understand who you are and you
[1:03:19] understand what you are and you
[1:03:20] understand why you're here and what
[1:03:22] god's trying to do in your life amen
[1:03:24] if you're looking through tinted glasses
[1:03:26] it's hard to see especially when the
[1:03:28] outside is dark looking through your
[1:03:30] sunglasses at night is not going to
[1:03:32] serve you very well is it and it's very
[1:03:33] dark outside isn't it
[1:03:35] in this world it's very dark there's no
[1:03:37] light
[1:03:38] but when you step up from behind it
[1:03:40] that's when things change
[1:03:42] it's funny because paul says then face
[1:03:44] to face you look at his damascus
[1:03:46] experience that was pretty face to face
[1:03:48] you'd think you think that was the
[1:03:49] moment that was where he really
[1:03:51] understood all this
[1:03:53] the holy spirit in the pillar of fire
[1:03:54] knocks him down off of his horse and
[1:03:56] paul says that's not the face-to-face
[1:03:58] experience i'm talking about
[1:04:00] that was only the start of something but
[1:04:02] there's something more and it's where
[1:04:03] there's a unity between christ and his
[1:04:05] bride that is so exceptional that she is
[1:04:07] him and he is her
[1:04:09] that's what we're going towards amen
[1:04:11] the prophet of god speaking of the day
[1:04:12] of pentecost in the upper room
[1:04:14] experience initially would say this he
[1:04:16] said now the complete fullness of the
[1:04:18] godhead bodily dwells in his church the
[1:04:20] preeminences
[1:04:22] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:04:25] and all that christ was was poured into
[1:04:27] the church the believers now this is him
[1:04:30] preaching in the message christ is the
[1:04:32] mystery of god revealed for me
[1:04:33] personally this is my favorite message
[1:04:35] because it's a it gives us a view from
[1:04:37] eternity to eternity it shows us the the
[1:04:39] mind and the thought of god in the
[1:04:41] beginning who he was and it takes us all
[1:04:43] the way through all the way to pass the
[1:04:44] millennium and then it it shows us the
[1:04:46] entire mind and purpose of god in in 30
[1:04:50] or 40 pages it's an absolutely
[1:04:52] phenomenal message but brother branham
[1:04:54] said this so many times that that idea
[1:04:56] that all that god was he poured into
[1:04:57] christ and all that christ was he poured
[1:04:59] into the church
[1:05:01] and we understand we believe that that
[1:05:03] first part very easily that all that god
[1:05:05] was he poured into christ in colossians
[1:05:07] 2 it says as ye have therefore received
[1:05:09] christ jesus the lord so walking in him
[1:05:12] rooted and built up in him and
[1:05:14] established in the faith as you have
[1:05:15] been taught abounding therein with
[1:05:17] thanksgiving but where lest any man
[1:05:20] spoil you through philosophy and vein
[1:05:21] deceit intellectual revelation i would
[1:05:24] call that after the tradition of men and
[1:05:27] after the rudiments of the world and not
[1:05:28] after christ for in him dwelleth all the
[1:05:31] fullness of the godhead bodily we can
[1:05:34] say amen to that very easily can't we we
[1:05:36] believe that all that god was he poured
[1:05:38] into christ we saw it in his life we saw
[1:05:40] it in his actions we saw it in the
[1:05:41] effect that he had we saw it in the
[1:05:43] responses that he had everything about
[1:05:45] christ screamed god is inside of him we
[1:05:47] believe
[1:05:48] that what about the part about christ
[1:05:51] being poured into us
[1:05:53] because that's a little harder to
[1:05:54] believe isn't it it's always easier to
[1:05:56] believe for the other person it's never
[1:05:57] easy to believe for ourselves
[1:06:00] but john 14 says and this is jesus
[1:06:03] speaking he says i will pray the father
[1:06:05] and he will give you another comforter
[1:06:06] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:06:09] the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:06:11] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:06:13] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:06:15] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:06:18] then he says i will not leave you
[1:06:20] comfortless i will come to you personal
[1:06:22] pronoun
[1:06:23] the person of christ the anointed one
[1:06:26] the anointing he says is going to come
[1:06:28] back on top of you but he says it's in
[1:06:29] the form of the holy spirit
[1:06:31] yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:06:33] no more but ye see me because i live ye
[1:06:36] shall live also at that day you shall
[1:06:39] know that i am in the father and you and
[1:06:41] me and i in you so he says i'm going to
[1:06:44] pour myself into you church
[1:06:46] in first john 4 4 he says ye are of god
[1:06:49] little children and have overcome them
[1:06:52] because greater is he that is in you
[1:06:55] than he that is in the world now notice
[1:06:57] if we've got something inside of us
[1:06:59] they've got something inside of them too
[1:07:01] there's an incarnation of satan as well
[1:07:03] in this world amen and it's through
[1:07:05] demon spirits and these different things
[1:07:07] but as there's a a a type there there's
[1:07:10] a perfect in there in us amen he's just
[1:07:12] doing there what christ is doing in us
[1:07:14] he's mirroring what he sees god doing in
[1:07:16] us and that's that there is something
[1:07:17] living in us and that's the very life
[1:07:19] and nature of christ itself
[1:07:21] first corinthians 6 says what know ye
[1:07:24] not that your body is the temple of the
[1:07:26] holy ghost which is in you which ye have
[1:07:29] of god and ye are not your own
[1:07:31] the temple is a place of what dwelling
[1:07:34] and worship
[1:07:36] so he's saying you're the place where
[1:07:38] god
[1:07:39] is to be worshiped not that people will
[1:07:41] worship me or you god forbid
[1:07:43] amen but where he is worshipped through
[1:07:46] the life that has lived here through the
[1:07:48] things that i do through the things that
[1:07:49] i don't do the words that i speak the
[1:07:52] thoughts that i have the attitudes
[1:07:53] reactions responses modes and objectives
[1:07:56] all of that is to worship the god that
[1:07:58] is within us
[1:08:00] he says for ye are bought with a price
[1:08:02] therefore glorify god in your body and
[1:08:05] in your spirit which are gods
[1:08:08] so can we see that and agree to it today
[1:08:10] as is as we say all that christ god was
[1:08:12] important to christ can we say yes
[1:08:14] christ has poured something into me
[1:08:16] amen can we say that i am christ in part
[1:08:19] today
[1:08:21] we're not preaching some weird doctrine
[1:08:22] here i'm saying that if you're a part of
[1:08:24] the bride of christ then that means
[1:08:26] there's a portion of christ inside of
[1:08:27] you and if you don't believe that you're
[1:08:29] not going to get very far because you've
[1:08:31] got to believe that the very same life
[1:08:33] that was in christ jesus is inside of
[1:08:34] you because that's what's going to raise
[1:08:36] this mortal body and take it into our
[1:08:38] into a resurrection or a rapture amen
[1:08:40] that's the thing that takes us to the
[1:08:42] other side is the very same life that he
[1:08:44] had
[1:08:45] amen amen
[1:08:48] why we've got to be able to confess
[1:08:49] we've got the token we've got the ticket
[1:08:51] that takes us to the other side
[1:08:53] if you don't have that you're not going
[1:08:55] to walk up with any confidence you're
[1:08:56] not going to walk up at all if you don't
[1:08:58] think you've got a ticket to get on the
[1:08:59] train to glory
[1:09:00] you've got to know you've got it you've
[1:09:02] got to settle that in your heart amen
[1:09:04] you got to seek it out with fear and
[1:09:05] trembling amen that's our resting place
[1:09:08] my resting place is that he sealed me so
[1:09:10] that it doesn't matter what the storms
[1:09:12] of life throw at me it doesn't matter
[1:09:13] what people say doesn't matter what
[1:09:15] happens with job and finances and health
[1:09:17] i'm sealed i'm going through no matter
[1:09:19] what that's my resting place is because
[1:09:21] it's a work he did not a work that i've
[1:09:23] done
[1:09:24] amen brother brahm said all that christ
[1:09:26] was he poured into the church and many
[1:09:28] times in many different ways and context
[1:09:30] and that's what i want to focus on
[1:09:31] tonight on this thought of pouring in
[1:09:33] with purpose
[1:09:34] amen it's not just to get us to a
[1:09:35] resurrection it's not just get us to a
[1:09:37] rapture but it's to get us to do
[1:09:38] something while we're here on this earth
[1:09:41] now when you experience a new birth
[1:09:43] there's something that happens and the
[1:09:44] prophet of god puts it this way this is
[1:09:46] his own experience
[1:09:48] this is i believe the last or second
[1:09:50] last sermon he preached communion
[1:09:52] he says now then one day as i walked on
[1:09:54] that voice talking said don't ever smoke
[1:09:57] drink and so forth and the young fellows
[1:09:59] and all got older see there was
[1:10:01] something moving but yet all that once i
[1:10:03] looked up and said i'm not the son of
[1:10:06] charles and ella branham there's
[1:10:08] something calling
[1:10:10] like my little eagle i'm not a chicken
[1:10:12] there's something up yonder somewhere oh
[1:10:15] great jehovah whoever you are open up he
[1:10:18] says i want to come home there's
[1:10:19] something in me that's calling
[1:10:22] he says then i was born again
[1:10:24] what happened he recognized he had a
[1:10:26] different identity than he'd had all of
[1:10:28] his life to that point
[1:10:30] he says that little life was laying
[1:10:32] there the life of water was poured upon
[1:10:34] it and then it began to grow
[1:10:36] now that old life was forgiven and put
[1:10:38] in the sea of god's forgetfulness to
[1:10:41] never be remembered against me no more
[1:10:42] see now we stand justified as though we
[1:10:45] never had sinned in the presence of god
[1:10:48] and you'll see if you look in his life
[1:10:50] story and you hear him say these things
[1:10:51] before this moment he had complexes and
[1:10:54] he had fears and he had insecurities and
[1:10:56] 99.9 of them were bad
[1:10:59] they weren't helping him at all yeah he
[1:11:01] was just
[1:11:02] his dad was a bootlegger he was
[1:11:04] partially indian they were poor they
[1:11:06] didn't have food i mean he was just an
[1:11:08] outcast amongst people nobody liked the
[1:11:10] branhams they had to run his dad was in
[1:11:13] trouble with the law they had to change
[1:11:14] their name all these things
[1:11:16] being a branham was not a good thing in
[1:11:17] brother branham's life
[1:11:19] but when he gets saved you see that he
[1:11:21] changes now and god starts to do a work
[1:11:23] with him because what he's realized that
[1:11:25] i am not a branham anymore i'm a son of
[1:11:27] god
[1:11:28] right i i'm a i'm part of something
[1:11:30] bigger and better than what i was ever
[1:11:32] raised up to be now that's one thing to
[1:11:34] say when your family's full of uh of
[1:11:36] whiskey-making bootleggers and and law
[1:11:38] breakers but what if we're in a great
[1:11:40] family
[1:11:42] right it's a little harder to say i'm
[1:11:43] not a part of that family either is it
[1:11:46] but you got to break that identity to
[1:11:48] come into his identity because that's
[1:11:49] the one that he's hoping you'll see
[1:11:51] that's the one he's waiting on you to
[1:11:52] see is that you're called to be a member
[1:11:54] of the bride of christ not to be a
[1:11:55] member of the coffee family of the lush
[1:11:57] family of the columbo family of the
[1:11:58] colette family of the grand family or
[1:12:01] these different ones
[1:12:02] he's saying no you've got to come up to
[1:12:04] a different identity you've got to see
[1:12:06] your place and you've got to see
[1:12:07] yourself in a different light amen
[1:12:10] now we spoke of this the the this
[1:12:12] filling up last service about the gopher
[1:12:15] wood but i wanted to cover it again
[1:12:17] different quotes but the same idea just
[1:12:18] for the sake of those that missed it
[1:12:20] because we talked about the emptying out
[1:12:22] and now we want to get to the pouring in
[1:12:24] but he says now we find out that gopher
[1:12:25] wood that's what the ark was made of the
[1:12:27] first thing the rfb made out of gopher
[1:12:29] wood it had to be cut down and its own
[1:12:31] life dried out this is the dying out the
[1:12:34] emptying out we spoke of last service he
[1:12:36] said that's the sign of the sinner the
[1:12:38] sinner before he can get right with god
[1:12:40] has to dispel all his sin and get white
[1:12:43] then the gopher what's the lightest
[1:12:44] there is and a sinner that's repented
[1:12:46] and laying before god is the most
[1:12:48] receptive thing there can be
[1:12:51] that means you're open to something
[1:12:53] because you've got nothing left to give.
[1:12:56] he says then the holy spirit comes down
[1:12:59] now if you put that gopher what in the
[1:13:00] water it would sink in a few minutes
[1:13:02] that's right now the sinner's all
[1:13:04] emptied out and then when the gopher
[1:13:05] would empty out it becomes light and
[1:13:07] flexible
[1:13:08] he says did you ever get real light when
[1:13:10] you got down there and god forgave your
[1:13:12] sins and it seemed like he was walking
[1:13:14] on clouds
[1:13:15] he said sure emptied out of your own
[1:13:18] life then god took you to the tabernacle
[1:13:20] to the gathering of the people and he
[1:13:22] made you a piece of timber or a stone in
[1:13:25] a house what he fits you into a group of
[1:13:27] people
[1:13:28] amen it's like i've always said from
[1:13:30] brother paul haley said he says there's
[1:13:32] only one definition of a lone sheep in
[1:13:34] the bible and that's lost
[1:13:36] right there's no such thing as a as a
[1:13:38] herd of of one sheep no that's a lost
[1:13:41] sheep what's brother brown say he's fits
[1:13:42] you into a group of people and he starts
[1:13:44] to make you a part of that body
[1:13:46] amen he says and then when you were
[1:13:48] nailed on like the gopher wood was then
[1:13:50] they took the rosin out of this tree the
[1:13:52] pine tree the evergreen and boiled it
[1:13:54] and poured it into these pores there
[1:13:56] there that was one sap of no use and no
[1:13:58] effect and poured the rosin out of the
[1:14:00] other tree into that and made it as
[1:14:02] strong as steel and it could stand the
[1:14:04] judgment he says this is what we're
[1:14:07] talking about the point in he says then
[1:14:08] when you poured out all your sinful life
[1:14:11] and the holy spirit boiled in the fires
[1:14:14] of calvary has been poured into you it
[1:14:16] sealed you into the kingdom of god and
[1:14:18] he says grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:14:20] god whereby you're sealed unto the day
[1:14:22] of your redemption amen he says this is
[1:14:24] the effect now he says let the world
[1:14:26] bounce and the chunks and all the other
[1:14:29] things will never touch a born-again
[1:14:32] christian amen
[1:14:34] why because that's dead to you now it's
[1:14:36] sealed out you've got a case hard and
[1:14:39] outer section there that nothing can
[1:14:41] penetrate brother brown would say you
[1:14:42] couldn't drive a nail into it when they
[1:14:44] were done that's how hard it was nothing
[1:14:46] from the outside can get in
[1:14:49] it's sealed out
[1:14:51] it's sealed out
[1:14:52] brother brown says how do you know if
[1:14:54] you got the holy ghost he says you're
[1:14:55] dead to the desires that you used to
[1:14:57] have
[1:14:58] now satan will play tricks i'll tell you
[1:15:00] a story it's not mine it's brother cadre
[1:15:02] diggs brother cadre diggs talks about he
[1:15:04] says i'm in a store in a clothing store
[1:15:06] or something he says and the music comes
[1:15:09] on that i used to like he says and
[1:15:11] pretty soon my foot's temping i'm kind
[1:15:13] of starting to move around a little bit
[1:15:15] and he catches himself he's like huh
[1:15:18] he says but when i walked out that door
[1:15:21] the music stayed in the store he says it
[1:15:23] didn't come with me because all it did
[1:15:25] was it revived a memory but it did not
[1:15:27] revive a desire for that amen all it was
[1:15:30] was triggering something that was in his
[1:15:32] mind but when he walked out the devil of
[1:15:34] that rock and roll stayed right in that
[1:15:35] store because why he was sealed with the
[1:15:38] holy ghost and nothing from the outside
[1:15:40] could come in
[1:15:41] don't let the devil take those memories
[1:15:43] and make you think you've lost it amen a
[1:15:45] memory is just a memory amen how you act
[1:15:48] on it that's what's going to define
[1:15:49] what's going on inside of you amen
[1:15:53] he says what christ took that beating
[1:15:55] that killing that destruction so you
[1:15:56] could have life he took the shame he
[1:15:58] took the judgment the humiliation that
[1:16:00] was the beating out to get the life out
[1:16:01] of him he took what we were supposed to
[1:16:04] take so that we could have the life that
[1:16:05] he had amen
[1:16:07] what is he doing he's restoring you back
[1:16:08] to your kingdom position amen
[1:16:11] and what does he say what does this
[1:16:12] pouring in look like we talked about the
[1:16:14] pouring out of our own lives and the
[1:16:16] emptying out but he says what does this
[1:16:17] pouring in look like he says the world
[1:16:19] bounces in the chunks and all the other
[1:16:21] things they'll never touch a born-again
[1:16:23] christian
[1:16:24] so what the politics of the world don't
[1:16:26] suck us in the ideologies the social
[1:16:28] justice the sports the music the
[1:16:30] entertainment the clothing pick your
[1:16:32] poison amen none of it draws the
[1:16:34] believer in because it's sealed out
[1:16:36] it's sealed out it has no effect on them
[1:16:38] amen prophet of god would say and when
[1:16:40] you come into christ you're no more of
[1:16:42] the world you are of christ
[1:16:45] see you care not them for the things of
[1:16:46] the world they are dead to you for he
[1:16:49] that loves the world or the things of
[1:16:50] the world the love of god is not even in
[1:16:53] him so you see you can't be an
[1:16:55] artificial christian there's no such
[1:16:57] thing he says you can be an artificial
[1:16:59] professed christian
[1:17:02] but you can't be a christian and become
[1:17:05] one until christ injects himself into
[1:17:07] you by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:09] then you're connected with him you're no
[1:17:11] longer twained you are one christ
[1:17:13] promised to be in us as the father was
[1:17:15] in christ
[1:17:16] i and my father are one you and i are
[1:17:18] one see christ in us all that god was he
[1:17:21] poured into christ and all that christ
[1:17:23] was he poured into the church to do what
[1:17:26] to continue the work of the gospel
[1:17:29] that's why brother brown would talk
[1:17:30] about us doing another second book of
[1:17:32] acts because what they continued the
[1:17:34] gospel and that gospel has never stopped
[1:17:36] being preached we're at alpha and omega
[1:17:38] now he was in the first church and he's
[1:17:40] in the last church perfectly represented
[1:17:42] right it's going to be the exact same
[1:17:43] thing it's got to be the same thing
[1:17:46] he says then we become not by artificial
[1:17:49] name but by a reality of the holy spirit
[1:17:52] of life connecting us into christ
[1:17:54] notice that he says not by artificial
[1:17:56] name now we'll list up baptist and
[1:17:58] pentecost and methodists and all these
[1:18:00] things but guess what you can put
[1:18:01] message right there too
[1:18:03] the
[1:18:04] being identified as a message believer
[1:18:06] is not the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:08] that's an artificial name amen that's
[1:18:10] not where we stand
[1:18:12] we stand on the word that's revealed by
[1:18:14] the holy spirit amen he says then
[1:18:16] through the power of his resurrection
[1:18:18] we're raised from the dead things of the
[1:18:19] world and setting with him in heavenly
[1:18:21] places amen he says i like that tonight
[1:18:24] we're sitting in heavenly places in
[1:18:26] christ jesus see resurrected with him
[1:18:29] we've died to the things of the world
[1:18:31] and took on christ and when we take on
[1:18:33] christ then the world is dead then we
[1:18:35] care no more for the world the world is
[1:18:37] dead to us and it's dead to us he says
[1:18:40] and we're dead to it amen it doesn't
[1:18:43] bring you to life it doesn't spur you
[1:18:45] into action it doesn't cause reactions
[1:18:48] because what you're as dead dead as it
[1:18:50] is dead to you
[1:18:51] there's no resurrecting power in the
[1:18:53] world
[1:18:54] so if you're dead the world can't raise
[1:18:56] up the old dead person can it
[1:18:58] he says you're a different person
[1:19:00] different personality because you are a
[1:19:03] new creation a creation he says not the
[1:19:06] same creation polished up not a man
[1:19:09] that's turned a new leaf right this is a
[1:19:11] new year's resolutions we're talking
[1:19:13] about he says but a man that's died and
[1:19:16] been born again and become a new
[1:19:18] creation in christ jesus and the spirit
[1:19:20] of the living god
[1:19:22] lives in the person that's our
[1:19:24] confession the spirit of the living god
[1:19:26] is inside of me
[1:19:28] the spirit of the living god is inside
[1:19:30] of you that's got to be our confession
[1:19:32] we've got to believe it not just our
[1:19:34] confession but our reality amen
[1:19:37] he says what brother brahm's saying the
[1:19:39] pouring of christ into your life does
[1:19:41] one thing up front and that's that it
[1:19:42] seals out the world amen so you can't be
[1:19:46] tied into it
[1:19:47] you can't be joined to it because he
[1:19:48] built you into another tabernacle he's
[1:19:50] built you into another body so you can't
[1:19:52] be part and parcel with the world it's
[1:19:54] an unholy union it's an unequal yoking
[1:19:56] it can't be done with the true believer
[1:19:59] it won't stick
[1:20:01] sometimes we get caught in traps and we
[1:20:02] get sucked into things and it may last
[1:20:04] temporarily but in the end if you're a
[1:20:06] child of god it has to pull away because
[1:20:08] it can't penetrate in and hold on
[1:20:11] right what's he saying he says you're a
[1:20:13] different person not the same creation
[1:20:14] polish not a man that's turned a new
[1:20:16] leaf i'm not jonathan corlett version
[1:20:18] 2.0
[1:20:20] no jonathan curlett is dead
[1:20:22] and christ now lives in me amen and he
[1:20:25] calls me something else and that's mrs
[1:20:27] jesus christ jonathan colette has to be
[1:20:29] dead he has to die amen i have a new
[1:20:32] identity my old person is dead he
[1:20:35] doesn't exist anymore that's why i can't
[1:20:37] go back to it it's dead
[1:20:39] i can't go back and resurrect it i can't
[1:20:41] go back to my old life it's dead it
[1:20:43] doesn't exist anymore it can't come back
[1:20:45] to life because the life has moved out
[1:20:47] of it and there's a new life living in
[1:20:49] me now amen it's died and i've got a new
[1:20:51] identity and i've got a new life
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:55] the prophet of god says now the purpose
[1:20:57] what was god's purpose in sending the
[1:20:59] holy spirit
[1:21:00] not to just take us to a resurrection
[1:21:02] and rapture he said god's purpose we
[1:21:04] find here and sending the holy spirit
[1:21:06] was one purpose that god himself might
[1:21:09] dwell in his church and continue his
[1:21:11] plans through the church
[1:21:13] that's why we have the holy ghost so god
[1:21:16] can do something through us
[1:21:17] he says that god was in christ
[1:21:19] continuing his plans through christ and
[1:21:21] out of christ into the church continuing
[1:21:23] his work through the church now we know
[1:21:26] what the holy spirit is we found out
[1:21:27] last night that it's god now when we
[1:21:29] think of god the fathers jesus spoke of
[1:21:31] here his father god the son is jesus god
[1:21:34] the holy spirit is what we call it today
[1:21:36] now that does not mean that there's
[1:21:37] three individual distinct gods it means
[1:21:39] that there is one god in three offices
[1:21:41] we know these things he says may we say
[1:21:44] it like this he says all that god was he
[1:21:47] poured into christ because he emptied
[1:21:49] himself and poured it into christ and
[1:21:51] christ was the fullness of the godhead
[1:21:52] bodily and all that jehovah was he
[1:21:54] poured into christ and then here's our
[1:21:57] part he says all that christ was he
[1:21:58] poured into the church not into one
[1:22:00] individual
[1:22:02] not into one ministry not into one man
[1:22:05] not into one physical church but what he
[1:22:08] says but into the entire body he says
[1:22:11] there where we come together in unity
[1:22:14] where in the body of the bride in the
[1:22:17] body of christ there where we come
[1:22:19] together in unity we have power
[1:22:23] not in silos not in individual churches
[1:22:26] not in individual ministries but when
[1:22:27] the bride comes together in one big
[1:22:30] unity he says that's where we have power
[1:22:32] he says all that was in god god was was
[1:22:35] in christ and all that christ was is in
[1:22:38] you
[1:22:39] because remember remember what they said
[1:22:41] to jesus he said they that you're you're
[1:22:42] casting out these these devils and
[1:22:44] diseases by the power of satan he says a
[1:22:46] kingdom divided against itself can't
[1:22:48] stand
[1:22:49] and so when we set up camps and we set
[1:22:51] up the these doctrinal this and and
[1:22:53] ministry that and whatnot what are we
[1:22:54] doing it's a kingdom divided against
[1:22:56] itself and there can't be full unity and
[1:22:58] if there isn't full unity there can't be
[1:23:00] full power
[1:23:02] because if i got if i'm trying to lift
[1:23:03] something off the ground and i've got
[1:23:05] one hand lifting and one hand pushing
[1:23:07] that ain't gonna move is it it's gonna
[1:23:08] stay right there because i'm fighting
[1:23:10] against myself and it's the same thing
[1:23:12] with the bride of christ when we get
[1:23:14] caught up into isms and personalities
[1:23:16] and charisma and gifts and signs and
[1:23:18] wonders of this one and that one what
[1:23:19] happens is it divides the body rather
[1:23:21] than pulls it together
[1:23:23] i was talking to brother joe about this
[1:23:25] i read a quote that was wonderful for me
[1:23:27] because brother brahm says he says some
[1:23:29] men preach like a building on fire he
[1:23:31] says and then there are others
[1:23:34] i said i'm others
[1:23:37] but he didn't say i wasn't a minister
[1:23:39] because i didn't preach like there was a
[1:23:40] house on fire right
[1:23:42] and he was pointing out that every gift
[1:23:43] is not the same every person's not the
[1:23:45] same and our value is equal regardless
[1:23:48] of the gift
[1:23:49] because why we've each got a portion of
[1:23:51] christ to give out amen amen
[1:23:54] you look at a church where the people
[1:23:56] are in factions one wants this pastor
[1:23:58] one wants this pastor one wants this
[1:23:59] preacher one backs this deacon one back
[1:24:01] zach deacon one wants this one in sunday
[1:24:03] school one wants that one in sunday
[1:24:04] school and what happens is what it's
[1:24:06] fractured and nothing happens there it
[1:24:08] drives the spirit of god completely out
[1:24:10] of the church
[1:24:11] because it's what a bunch of men doing
[1:24:13] denominational things rather than
[1:24:14] submitting themselves to the holy spirit
[1:24:16] amen what do you do you say lord is this
[1:24:18] my church
[1:24:20] and if this is your church
[1:24:21] and he says yes this is your church and
[1:24:23] what do you do you get your shoulder to
[1:24:25] the wheel and you push
[1:24:27] whatever direction that the church has
[1:24:28] led you push that's all we do
[1:24:31] that's what we do brother brown said if
[1:24:33] you've got 51 vote for it and 50 vote
[1:24:35] against it he said there are 49 vote
[1:24:36] against he says that's a holy ghost
[1:24:37] majority
[1:24:39] you say it's barely one way or the other
[1:24:40] it doesn't matter you go the way the
[1:24:42] church is going and trust me that's the
[1:24:43] holy spirit leading amen
[1:24:45] and then what if he says no it's not
[1:24:47] your church then the next thing you say
[1:24:49] is what where do i go then
[1:24:51] i've been there done that
[1:24:53] i remember back in
[1:24:55] in one place where we were and and we
[1:24:57] were praying about leaving and we had a
[1:24:59] minister come from the united states
[1:25:00] come up knew nothing about us knew
[1:25:02] nothing about our situation or whatever
[1:25:03] and he was preaching there and we'd talk
[1:25:06] beforehand about leaving and and we were
[1:25:09] possibly going to leave in the middle of
[1:25:10] the school year and it was going to
[1:25:11] impact our kids transcripts and grades
[1:25:13] and make things difficult we were saying
[1:25:15] well maybe we could wait till the the
[1:25:16] summer and just make things simpler and
[1:25:18] the man of god gets up now
[1:25:20] this is the holy spirit moving in the
[1:25:21] minister okay he knows nothing about us
[1:25:23] and he says don't worry about your kid's
[1:25:25] transcripts he says if you're not
[1:25:27] supposed to be here get up and go
[1:25:33] he said exactly what we were talking
[1:25:34] about
[1:25:35] what it's the word discerning the spirit
[1:25:37] and the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:25:39] heart and he comes out and he says don't
[1:25:40] worry about that kind of stuff don't get
[1:25:42] caught up in the what-ifs if god moves
[1:25:45] your move
[1:25:46] and if god stays you then stay and get
[1:25:48] your shoulder to the wheel
[1:25:50] but don't go back and forth don't waffle
[1:25:52] the worst thing is a waffley person
[1:25:55] let your yay be in your navy nay
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:58] why because if you're not where you're
[1:26:00] supposed to be you'll be of no good
[1:26:01] where you are
[1:26:03] and you won't be of any good until you
[1:26:04] get where you're supposed to go so find
[1:26:06] the will of god and get there that's
[1:26:08] what i've had to do
[1:26:09] and involve moving further than our
[1:26:10] jamaican friends here
[1:26:12] to do it
[1:26:13] but in the end you move you do what god
[1:26:16] asks you to do amen what are we trying
[1:26:18] to do get in tune with what the holy
[1:26:19] spirit wants for us not what's
[1:26:21] comfortable not what's easy not what not
[1:26:24] not what always makes sense but to find
[1:26:26] what he wants us to do and trust he'll
[1:26:28] work out the rest of the details amen
[1:26:30] and he's done it time and time again for
[1:26:31] me
[1:26:34] brother brown would say now here it is
[1:26:36] the father was god over you were saying
[1:26:37] and we've been since adam god the father
[1:26:40] was over moses the children of israel
[1:26:41] the pillar of fire then god was with us
[1:26:43] in christ he walked with us he talked
[1:26:45] with us ate with us sleep with us
[1:26:47] he said god over us god with us and now
[1:26:49] god in us all god was come into christ
[1:26:52] all christ was come into the church what
[1:26:54] is it he says it's god working in you
[1:27:00] if he's working in you that means work
[1:27:01] has to be done
[1:27:03] something has to be done we don't just
[1:27:05] sit on our seats and pews
[1:27:07] that is not the life of the believers
[1:27:08] sitting in the pew saying amen to the
[1:27:10] words that come over the pulpit
[1:27:12] he says god working in you anywhere in
[1:27:15] the world that he would want to call on
[1:27:17] you you're right there working in you to
[1:27:20] do his good will he says how we ought to
[1:27:22] thank god for that god the holy spirit
[1:27:24] is sent for the purpose of god living in
[1:27:26] his church moving through each age
[1:27:29] working out his divine will
[1:27:31] that's why we believe in a message
[1:27:33] because he came to tell us what the
[1:27:34] divine will was for this age so he
[1:27:36] didn't go around trying to do a bunch of
[1:27:38] things that had nothing to do with our
[1:27:39] age
[1:27:40] right remember he said it wasn't
[1:27:41] wouldn't do moses any good to have
[1:27:43] noah's message
[1:27:44] that wouldn't do any good to identify
[1:27:46] with noah's message in in or in moses
[1:27:48] day would it we've got a message for our
[1:27:50] day that takes us to where we're
[1:27:52] supposed to go in this age
[1:27:54] then he says when men make fun of you
[1:27:56] they're not making fun of you they're
[1:27:58] making fun of him that sent you amen
[1:28:01] the thing is can you say it's him that
[1:28:02] sent me am i confident that i'm where he
[1:28:05] told me to go and doing what he told me
[1:28:07] to do because then you can rest assured
[1:28:09] that they're making fun of him not of
[1:28:10] you
[1:28:11] so jesus said blessed are ye when men
[1:28:13] shall say all men are of evil against
[1:28:15] you falsely for my name's sake blessed
[1:28:17] are you and then again all that live
[1:28:19] godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[1:28:21] persecutions but when god made himself
[1:28:24] known in christ they hated him
[1:28:26] who hated him the worst the church
[1:28:29] the church hated him the worst they
[1:28:30] hated him worse than the drunkard they
[1:28:32] hated him worse than all the other
[1:28:33] people it was the church that hated him
[1:28:35] they hated him worse than barabbas the
[1:28:36] murderer
[1:28:38] that's how much they hated him
[1:28:40] that they they they let a killer get
[1:28:42] away to kill the guy that wouldn't hurt
[1:28:43] a fleet
[1:28:45] he said so therefore when you see cosmos
[1:28:48] the world order the world that knew him
[1:28:50] not means the church the so-called knew
[1:28:52] him not he came to his own and his own
[1:28:54] received him not but as many did receive
[1:28:57] him to them gave he the power to become
[1:28:59] sons of god to them that believed in his
[1:29:01] name he says oh how we should love him
[1:29:04] and worship him the purpose of god
[1:29:07] wanting to become in fellowship
[1:29:10] so he poured himself into us to have
[1:29:13] fellowship amen
[1:29:14] and you'll notice that he makes it so
[1:29:16] that you can't have fellowship with the
[1:29:18] world
[1:29:18] because they reject hit you the way they
[1:29:20] reject him
[1:29:22] so if you've got fellowship with the
[1:29:23] world what does it tell you
[1:29:27] quick checkup
[1:29:29] if you've got fellowship with the world
[1:29:30] and it goes real easy when you're around
[1:29:32] the world then guess what
[1:29:33] you're not acting like one of his
[1:29:35] because the world can't have fellowship
[1:29:37] with a true believer
[1:29:39] that's why we give them the first
[1:29:40] admonition the second admonition then we
[1:29:42] walk away because it's never going to be
[1:29:44] an agreement they're of a different
[1:29:45] master they're in a different kingdom
[1:29:48] they're under a different anointing and
[1:29:49] it's not the anointing of christ we
[1:29:51] can't get close it's impossible to get
[1:29:53] close to someone in the world that way
[1:29:55] you can't do it it's an unequal joking
[1:29:58] amen amen and this isn't a quote just
[1:30:00] for ministries
[1:30:01] you think well that's the ones that
[1:30:02] they're the the face of the message of
[1:30:04] the the face of the churches and they're
[1:30:06] the ones that are going to get ridiculed
[1:30:07] and persecuted and these different
[1:30:09] things no this goes for everyone i
[1:30:10] believe probably every sister in here
[1:30:12] has been persecuted in some form or
[1:30:14] fashion because of her stand for
[1:30:15] holiness the way she dresses the way she
[1:30:18] walks the way she talks right
[1:30:21] somebody out there is going to say boy
[1:30:22] you're just old-fashioned aren't you
[1:30:24] oh you stay home you don't go to work my
[1:30:27] my my
[1:30:28] yep male privilege
[1:30:32] it's there it's there you wouldn't
[1:30:33] believe the stuff that's coming out
[1:30:35] these days even in work
[1:30:37] flags are raising initiatives they have
[1:30:40] sisters you better keep your hat on
[1:30:43] you better keep the word tight
[1:30:45] tight because they'll spin you so fast
[1:30:48] if you get caught up in it
[1:30:49] it's amazing how far it's spiraling
[1:30:51] downward
[1:30:53] i was just reading some things today and
[1:30:54] i shook my head and said wow
[1:30:56] i mean it seems like every week they
[1:30:58] don't just take a step
[1:31:00] they're 100 yards down the road and just
[1:31:02] going further and further and they're
[1:31:03] speeding up they're speeding up towards
[1:31:05] what death
[1:31:07] destruction
[1:31:09] but i want to load you up tonight on the
[1:31:10] good things about this pouring in
[1:31:12] because that's what's going to get us
[1:31:13] out of here is a pouring in and pouring
[1:31:15] in and pouring in and pouring in
[1:31:19] lebron says jesus said the father that
[1:31:21] sent me is with me
[1:31:22] oh my he says what a declaration what a
[1:31:24] word the father that sent with sent me
[1:31:27] come with me
[1:31:28] listen and as the father sent me so do i
[1:31:31] send you he says he don't only send you
[1:31:35] but he goes with you amen
[1:31:38] he says i'll be with you even in you
[1:31:40] unto the end of the world all that god
[1:31:42] was poured out in christ and all that
[1:31:44] was in christ was emptied out into the
[1:31:46] believer the church he says god is with
[1:31:49] you though i am with thee always even to
[1:31:51] the end of the world that's the
[1:31:53] declaration of god's world this is not
[1:31:54] brother brown's word this is god's word
[1:31:57] here he says that's what the bible says
[1:31:59] that's what i believe
[1:32:01] and if we had to stand it alone stand it
[1:32:03] for it's god's word every man that ever
[1:32:06] got anywhere had to stand alone on his
[1:32:09] convictions only that's not in the
[1:32:11] partnership there's only one who will
[1:32:13] walk it with you and that's him who made
[1:32:16] the statement
[1:32:17] the lord jesus he's the one that'll try
[1:32:19] the valley with you he'll go through
[1:32:21] every briar patch and climb every
[1:32:22] mountain by your side yoke yourself up
[1:32:25] with him for my yoke is light and my
[1:32:28] burdens are easy he says don't be yoked
[1:32:30] up with the things of the world don't be
[1:32:32] yoked up in different societies and
[1:32:34] organizations yoke yourself singly with
[1:32:37] the lord jesus christ in order that you
[1:32:40] can do it believe he says and see the
[1:32:43] resurrection why did he pour christ into
[1:32:46] us he says so that you would know that
[1:32:48] god is with you
[1:32:50] i can't feel him brother john he's still
[1:32:52] with you can't see him brother john he's
[1:32:54] still with you can't hear him brother
[1:32:56] john he's still with you
[1:32:59] what what did david say he says if i
[1:33:02] send into the heavens thou art there he
[1:33:04] says if i make my bed in hell
[1:33:07] thou art there
[1:33:08] from the top to the bottom and
[1:33:10] everything in between he says lord thou
[1:33:12] art there it doesn't matter where i go
[1:33:13] you're not gonna leave me you're not
[1:33:15] gonna forsake me amen
[1:33:17] what is it i'll fail you
[1:33:19] ministry will fail you churches will
[1:33:20] fail you people will fail you doctors
[1:33:23] will fail you spouses will fail you

[1:33:27] every single one of us holy ghost filled
[1:33:29] or not we're going to fail you he says
[1:33:31] yoke yourself singly with the lord jesus
[1:33:34] christ because he's the one that said it
[1:33:36] and he's the one that'll make it happen
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] he says believe it and you'll see the
[1:33:42] resurrection
[1:33:44] prophet god continues he says it's god
[1:33:46] in you

[1:33:48] all christ was he poured into the church
[1:33:50] it's god above us god with us and god in
[1:33:52] us he says no wonder we're commissioned
[1:33:54] to baptize using father son and holy
[1:33:56] ghost it's not three different gods it's
[1:33:58] three offices of one god see god above
[1:34:00] us in the father god with us in the son
[1:34:02] cleansing his way
[1:34:04] condescending coming down making a way
[1:34:06] for me to get back he says and bring his
[1:34:09] people back to manifested sons of god
[1:34:12] like they had them in the garden of eden
[1:34:15] he says the whole world's a groaning and
[1:34:17] waiting for that hour for the
[1:34:19] manifestation of the sons of god he says
[1:34:22] he has no voice tonight but our voice he
[1:34:24] has no hands but our hands he has your
[1:34:27] hands he says then whose hands is it
[1:34:30] he said i am the vine you are the
[1:34:32] branches i hope that you'll listen to
[1:34:34] this poor voice voice tonight and the
[1:34:36] little still voice of the spirit that
[1:34:38] can speak in your heart and hear him say
[1:34:40] it's i
[1:34:41] be not afraid
[1:34:43] he says do you believe
[1:34:45] he says the mind of christ is to be in
[1:34:47] the church
[1:34:48] and the mind of christ and the mind of
[1:34:49] god was in christ and how that the
[1:34:52] spirit led christ so out his spirit to
[1:34:55] lead the church
[1:34:56] and all that god was he poured into
[1:34:58] christ and all christ was he poured into
[1:35:00] the church so the church has the power
[1:35:02] that christ had
[1:35:05] christ had the power that god had he
[1:35:07] said at that day you'll know i'm in the
[1:35:09] father the father and me i in you and
[1:35:11] you and me now listen to this he says
[1:35:13] you'll find out that god dwells in his
[1:35:16] church
[1:35:17] and in his people
[1:35:19] the purpose of the holy spirit
[1:35:22] pouring in is to draw us back to our
[1:35:23] rightful position as manifested sons and
[1:35:26] daughters of god amen
[1:35:29] what did brother brahms say he has no
[1:35:31] voice but yours
[1:35:33] no hands but yours no feet but yours
[1:35:36] he needs help
[1:35:38] not because he needs it but because
[1:35:40] that's how he's ordained it right he can
[1:35:43] create whatever he needs to create out
[1:35:44] of thin air but he has dedicated himself
[1:35:46] to using what fallen men and women at
[1:35:48] this time
[1:35:50] wear his hands
[1:35:51] where's feet he's got nothing else
[1:35:54] like i said the only christ this world
[1:35:56] is going to see is you and i living out
[1:35:58] the christ for our day
[1:36:01] it's the only one they're going to see
[1:36:03] so are they seeing it
[1:36:05] are they hearing it
[1:36:07] are they watching it
[1:36:09] are they just seeing jonathan curlett
[1:36:14] so often we're committed to the half day
[1:36:16] we spend in church every week
[1:36:18] you know you spend a quarter a couple
[1:36:20] hours on a wednesday a couple hours on a
[1:36:21] sunday but he's got six and a half days
[1:36:23] left outside of that for us to do
[1:36:25] something for him amen
[1:36:27] coming to church is great you know what
[1:36:29] we come to church for to get charged up
[1:36:31] for the other six and a half days when
[1:36:33] we're not in church
[1:36:34] we're coming in here to get built up in
[1:36:36] the most holy faith to stir up our pure
[1:36:37] minds by way of remembrance to be put
[1:36:39] into what kingdom order so that when we
[1:36:42] walk out the door we're an army in
[1:36:43] formation to do what the masters will
[1:36:46] we come in here to encourage each other
[1:36:48] not just for myself
[1:36:50] maybe this sermon isn't for everyone
[1:36:52] maybe it's just for a couple but if
[1:36:54] we're all sitting there pulling then
[1:36:55] that person's gonna get what they need
[1:36:56] amen
[1:36:57] and i guarantee you if you sit there and
[1:36:59] pull god will drop something in for you
[1:37:00] as well
[1:37:01] amen i've never seen the righteous
[1:37:03] forsaken nor see begging bread amen
[1:37:05] doesn't matter who's behind this pope
[1:37:06] but amen you poll god will give you
[1:37:08] something i believe he'll do that amen
[1:37:12] what's brother brahm talk about here
[1:37:13] he's talking about people that can live
[1:37:14] christ outside of the church
[1:37:17] it's easy to say hallelujah praise the
[1:37:19] lord when the holy spirit's anointing
[1:37:21] the the building and everything's going
[1:37:23] great and and satan's been pushed out
[1:37:25] and and there's no half-naked women
[1:37:27] walking around and rock and roll playing
[1:37:29] and job pressures and spouse pressures
[1:37:31] and
[1:37:31] it's easy in here
[1:37:33] but you got to be able to walk out there
[1:37:34] and live it once the worship ends right
[1:37:37] when the music fades
[1:37:39] when everything's done you walk out you
[1:37:41] got to be able to face the music and
[1:37:42] still stand up for what you believe amen
[1:37:45] people that can walk the talk
[1:37:47] not just preachers either brother brahm
[1:37:48] says now everybody can't be a preacher
[1:37:50] but you got a voice and if you can't
[1:37:52] preach the people a sermon he says if
[1:37:54] you're a preacher you're called to the
[1:37:56] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[1:37:57] still a preacher but live the people a
[1:37:59] sermon let your sermon be lived and it's
[1:38:02] the voice of god that will bring
[1:38:03] reproach to them that reject it they say
[1:38:05] no one could put a finger on his or her
[1:38:07] life they're sweet and living if there
[1:38:09] was ever a man of god it's that man or
[1:38:11] woman see he says live your sermons
[1:38:14] don't try to preach them if you're not
[1:38:15] called to be a preacher you get all
[1:38:17] mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll
[1:38:19] get people tangled up and you won't know
[1:38:21] he says well you'll ruin them and you'll
[1:38:23] and yourself too
[1:38:25] he says just live your sermon the
[1:38:27] preachers called the preachers and live
[1:38:29] it too if you can't live it then you
[1:38:31] stop preaching it but you're supposed to
[1:38:33] live your sermons he says all right here
[1:38:35] was voices
[1:38:36] oh how we needed in jeffersonville how
[1:38:39] we need in saint john's thousands of
[1:38:41] lived voices the thunder of god
[1:38:44] thundering out in sweetness and holiness
[1:38:47] purity undefiled lives walking around in
[1:38:50] the earth today without a blemish
[1:38:53] we talk about the seven thunders and the
[1:38:55] mystery of the thunders brother brown
[1:38:57] says this is a thunder
[1:39:00] not the thunder
[1:39:02] but he says this is a thunder this is
[1:39:03] god's thunder right here he says yes sir
[1:39:06] real christians that's thunder against
[1:39:08] the enemy the devil don't care how loud
[1:39:10] you can holler the devil don't care how
[1:39:12] much you can jump or how much you can do
[1:39:13] this or shout but what hurts the devil
[1:39:16] is to see that sanctified holy life
[1:39:19] consecrated to god
[1:39:21] say anything to him call him anything
[1:39:24] just as sweet as it can be and moves
[1:39:26] right on he says oh my that throws him
[1:39:28] away that's the thunder that shakes the
[1:39:31] devil
[1:39:32] my my my it's not big sermons
[1:39:36] it's somebody that can do what face the
[1:39:38] music and walk away unaffected
[1:39:40] that won't even let satan get in there
[1:39:42] and rile him up
[1:39:43] can walk away from every little little
[1:39:46] thing that sparks up and just say not
[1:39:48] doing that today
[1:39:51] won't even have the conversation with
[1:39:53] them
[1:39:54] you say brother john i haven't cast out
[1:39:56] any demons in my life
[1:39:57] let me ask you this prophet god says
[1:40:00] have you cast satan out of your own life
[1:40:02] is he wholly unable
[1:40:05] to touch you
[1:40:07] is he sealed out is his every attempt
[1:40:11] brought to nothing
[1:40:14] i'd say you're on a good start
[1:40:16] because you can't go do for somebody
[1:40:17] what hasn't been done in your life
[1:40:19] already
[1:40:20] you can't be an influence if you aren't
[1:40:21] already under the influence you can't go
[1:40:23] out and and show people away if you're
[1:40:25] not already in it
[1:40:26] right you've got to have the experience
[1:40:28] before you can go out and try and be
[1:40:29] anything else to somebody else amen you
[1:40:31] got to have an experience to back up
[1:40:32] your confession you have to be what
[1:40:34] you're trying to get others to be amen
[1:40:35] so they know where you're going to take
[1:40:37] them amen
[1:40:38] listen we aren't all demon slain
[1:40:40] disease-healing people but the prophet
[1:40:42] god says every single one of us is
[1:40:43] supposed to be a lived voice that
[1:40:45] thunders out against satan
[1:40:47] that's something we can all do
[1:40:49] that's something we can all do
[1:40:52] right you don't have to have some great
[1:40:53] gift
[1:40:54] he says you just have to be a live voice
[1:40:56] he says that's
[1:40:57] what shakes the devil
[1:41:00] an untouchable life amen
[1:41:02] listen
[1:41:03] there's only one voice left
[1:41:05] the prophet's dead
[1:41:07] right prophet's gone there's only one
[1:41:10] voice left on this earth and that's the
[1:41:11] bride of christ
[1:41:12] that's it
[1:41:13] we're the last voice
[1:41:15] guess what what does the scripture say
[1:41:16] the bride says the spirit and the bride
[1:41:19] say one thing
[1:41:20] amen come
[1:41:22] come
[1:41:23] amen come it's an invitation isn't it
[1:41:26] remember when we read in the last search
[1:41:28] for paul or peter was talking about save
[1:41:29] yourself from this perverse generation
[1:41:31] this untowards generation that's what
[1:41:33] we're preaching save yourself from
[1:41:34] what's out there
[1:41:36] because you're not going to like it when
[1:41:37] you get to the end and see what it all
[1:41:38] turned into
[1:41:40] save yourself come with us there's a
[1:41:42] remedy get in the ark
[1:41:44] that's what we're saying right get out
[1:41:46] of it while you still can
[1:41:48] and guess what we are never to judge
[1:41:52] scripture says they judge themselves
[1:41:54] right
[1:41:55] prophet god said they judge themselves
[1:41:56] when they do what when they turn it down
[1:41:59] that tells you what's inside them i
[1:42:00] don't have to say if somebody's a
[1:42:02] believer not a believer when they turn
[1:42:03] the word down that shows what's inside
[1:42:05] of them at least for this moment at
[1:42:07] least for this moment because paul
[1:42:08] turned it down a lot of times before he
[1:42:09] took it didn't he so we leave that in
[1:42:11] god's hands amen
[1:42:13] but we're here to offer a part and we're
[1:42:14] here to offer grace while we're here
[1:42:17] prophet god says oh god if the world
[1:42:19] could only see that god and man are one
[1:42:22] what's the limiting factor
[1:42:24] it's not god
[1:42:26] living factor is not god the limiting
[1:42:27] factor is how much we'll let get poured
[1:42:29] out of us
[1:42:30] how much we'll die how much we're set
[1:42:32] ourselves aside how much we'll let him
[1:42:34] in and push out the rest of the stuff
[1:42:36] that's inside of us
[1:42:38] he says the super sign was that first
[1:42:40] man that god could come into and all
[1:42:42] that god was he poured into christ and
[1:42:43] all christ was he poured into the church
[1:42:45] he says a super sign god and man
[1:42:47] together that was to be the super side
[1:42:50] of the last day when the entire bible
[1:42:53] was to be fulfilled in the last days
[1:42:57] he's poured it into us so that we can
[1:42:58] fulfill the entire bible for this day
[1:43:03] amen that's an amazing thing when you
[1:43:04] think about it not to fulfill the entire
[1:43:06] bible but to fulfill the portion that's
[1:43:08] allotted to us
[1:43:11] now
[1:43:12] the prophet of god talks about this of
[1:43:13] course and christ the mystery of god
[1:43:14] revealed and i'm not going to go too
[1:43:16] deep in it but he wraps it up in just
[1:43:17] this one quote what he's talking about
[1:43:19] here he says now he's sanctified with
[1:43:21] his spirit and blood a church that he
[1:43:23] might make every promise in this last
[1:43:25] day be revealed that's the fulfillment
[1:43:28] of the entire word for this day he says
[1:43:30] now see he could go back and pick up
[1:43:31] what these other fellows has left off
[1:43:33] here in the last days and by his holy
[1:43:35] spirit reveal all the mysteries of the
[1:43:36] seven seals
[1:43:38] he says see he is expressing himself
[1:43:40] that's his purpose that's why he died
[1:43:43] that's the second fold of his threefold
[1:43:45] manifestation first to express himself
[1:43:47] in christ then expressed himself through
[1:43:50] the church and the same thing christ was
[1:43:52] the word and the church becomes the word
[1:43:55] when it lets the word go through them
[1:43:57] amen
[1:43:58] it's the final expression of what
[1:44:00] the word
[1:44:02] the word was with god the word was god
[1:44:04] it's the final expression of god it's
[1:44:06] the final expression of the word is you
[1:44:08] and me
[1:44:10] that's why he poured himself into us
[1:44:12] he says
[1:44:13] see the threefold mystery now god
[1:44:16] manifested in christ christ manifested
[1:44:18] in the church and then he says all
[1:44:20] together to bring back the original adam
[1:44:22] and eve again men and women which are
[1:44:24] one made out of the same blood and the
[1:44:27] same spirit and everything else
[1:44:29] very familiar scripture revelation 10 7
[1:44:31] says that the mystery of god should be
[1:44:33] finished
[1:44:35] complete
[1:44:36] finalized
[1:44:38] and the prophet of god points to you and
[1:44:40] he says you're the last piece
[1:44:43] he says you're the final mystery
[1:44:45] you're the final portion of the mystery
[1:44:47] of god remember when brother brahm says
[1:44:49] when the seals rope he says the bible
[1:44:50] became a new book and he says if you
[1:44:52] can't go back in your bible and see
[1:44:54] christ on every page read it again why
[1:44:56] because it was the revelation of god
[1:44:58] working all the way through through
[1:45:00] humanity through christ and now fully
[1:45:04] back into humanity again
[1:45:06] it was a mystery of god moving amongst
[1:45:08] us and he says in the end there's a
[1:45:10] perfection that comes alpha and omega
[1:45:12] same as it was on the day of pentecost
[1:45:13] it's the exact same thing right he says
[1:45:16] what he says christ the word is in the
[1:45:18] church and she becomes the word when the
[1:45:20] word goes through them
[1:45:24] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:45:26] us
[1:45:28] that's what he's saying
[1:45:29] it wasn't just christ
[1:45:31] it's you too
[1:45:33] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:45:35] us so guess what bump the person next to
[1:45:37] you and say i'm the word and so are you
[1:45:40] that's what we're talking about amen
[1:45:43] now here's the thing can we recognize it
[1:45:45] in each other
[1:45:49] that's a little more difficult isn't it
[1:45:52] that's a lot more difficult
[1:45:54] i can see all the flaws on brother grant
[1:45:56] back there already
[1:46:00] no
[1:46:02] but what
[1:46:03] guess what
[1:46:05] we got two hundred thousand thousand
[1:46:07] demons pointing out the flaws in our
[1:46:09] brothers and sisters
[1:46:10] and we've got one spirit that's trying
[1:46:12] to pour the bomb of gilead on our eyes
[1:46:13] so we'll see him through the word
[1:46:16] right
[1:46:17] so what are you rubbing on your eyes
[1:46:19] these days
[1:46:21] right
[1:46:22] because what you're rubbing on your eyes
[1:46:23] is what you're going to see
[1:46:24] you know how they have glasses that they
[1:46:26] have uh you know they've got the 3d
[1:46:28] glasses that'll do all sorts of wonky
[1:46:29] things but if you put on red glasses and
[1:46:31] brother bam says if you look at red
[1:46:33] through red then it is what white and he
[1:46:35] says that's the way the blood works is
[1:46:36] when you look at a red mark which is
[1:46:38] which is a uh
[1:46:40] you know a dead ode he says you look at
[1:46:42] red dead ode through the red the blood
[1:46:44] of christ it shows white it's not even
[1:46:46] there right you can't even see it
[1:46:48] so you do this what you're looking
[1:46:50] through the eyes of the holy spirit
[1:46:51] you're looking through the film of the
[1:46:52] holy spirit and it'll show you the word
[1:46:53] in your brothers
[1:46:55] but if you get out under another
[1:46:56] influence
[1:46:58] right if you get away from the the
[1:46:59] sweetness of the holy spirit then what
[1:47:01] happens is that lifts up and you start
[1:47:03] looking through the lenses of something
[1:47:04] else and guess what you start to see you
[1:47:06] start to see the rough edges don't you
[1:47:08] the flaws and the failures and the
[1:47:10] hypocrisy
[1:47:12] because we're hypocrites every one of us
[1:47:15] none of us is perfect
[1:47:16] we say we believe and then often we do
[1:47:18] something different than what we say
[1:47:20] in reaction and motive and objective if
[1:47:22] not in anything else amen
[1:47:27] prophet has said what happened in the
[1:47:28] pre-figure now he says he opened adam's
[1:47:30] side and took part of his flesh which
[1:47:32] was adam to make eve he says the bride
[1:47:34] has to be the word for he is the word
[1:47:37] she cannot stand on creeds she cannot
[1:47:39] stand on denomination she cannot stand
[1:47:41] on good behavior she has to stand alone
[1:47:44] on the word because she is part of it
[1:47:46] she was taken from christ see
[1:47:48] listen to this his church is himself
[1:47:52] revealed
[1:47:53] amen he says amen do you see it
[1:47:56] his church is himself revealed and
[1:47:59] expressed by the word itself
[1:48:01] that he
[1:48:02] is god
[1:48:05] what a phrase
[1:48:08] his church is himself revealed amen you
[1:48:12] go up and tell that to just about
[1:48:13] anybody today they put you right in the
[1:48:15] mental institution
[1:48:17] you go tell that to a denominational
[1:48:18] christian they'll say you're out of your
[1:48:21] mind
[1:48:23] but you've got to get out of your mind
[1:48:25] you've got to see yourself the way he
[1:48:27] sees you you got to believe the word
[1:48:28] that he's given us that tells us who and
[1:48:30] what we are
[1:48:31] even when we don't see it
[1:48:34] even when we get up and we look at
[1:48:35] ourselves in the mirror and say hoof
[1:48:42] or maybe your kids look at you and go
[1:48:46] maybe that happens a little more often
[1:48:47] right
[1:48:50] this church is himself revealed
[1:48:52] i think we're at the place where paul
[1:48:54] said
[1:48:54] we're still looking through the glass
[1:48:55] darkly
[1:48:57] we believe it i believe it i say i
[1:48:59] believe it i believe it with as much as
[1:49:01] i know how to believe it but i believe
[1:49:02] there's a further quickening that's
[1:49:04] coming to us amen i believe we've got a
[1:49:06] further place that we can go i believe
[1:49:07] there's a deeper way that we can go and
[1:49:09] like i said before i believe we see
[1:49:11] moments we see spots of light we we see
[1:49:13] things and and we say
[1:49:15] okay god
[1:49:16] i see you've got a handle on this i see
[1:49:18] you've made that change i see you've
[1:49:20] really nailed things down in my life
[1:49:22] and that's a beautiful thing
[1:49:24] that's a victory that's what we're
[1:49:25] talking about is when you get a victory
[1:49:27] and you say lord that's you
[1:49:29] and you can say that's the word that's
[1:49:31] the word living through me
[1:49:32] but then you go into the next trial and
[1:49:34] then you say oof
[1:49:36] and that's when you're looking for what
[1:49:37] the tinted glass to be taken away when
[1:49:39] the battle's over on that one and you
[1:49:41] can see the word built up again word
[1:49:43] upon word line upon line here a little
[1:49:44] there little right just building us up
[1:49:47] into the perfect stature that's all
[1:49:51] what are we doing we're learning to be
[1:49:53] patient
[1:49:54] to trust to wait
[1:49:57] that he's given the word
[1:49:58] and he can't return to him void
[1:50:00] and it's really that simple amen
[1:50:03] god said he's going to do it he'll do it
[1:50:06] that's where we rest amen
[1:50:08] almost done here he says all that christ
[1:50:09] was he poured into the church
[1:50:11] what is it anointed one to continue his
[1:50:14] work that his word might live constantly
[1:50:18] i've uh i've been delving into other
[1:50:20] denominations in the last couple weeks
[1:50:22] on youtube and
[1:50:24] and listening to what they preach and
[1:50:26] it's amazing
[1:50:27] what they'll get into at times
[1:50:30] and you sit there and you're just like
[1:50:31] it's as dead as dead can be
[1:50:34] and you feel horrible and you there's
[1:50:36] you're not left with any wonder why
[1:50:38] people are leaving churches in droves
[1:50:39] these days
[1:50:40] because there's no living
[1:50:42] life
[1:50:43] in that word that they're preaching it's
[1:50:45] dead it's rhetoric it's theology it's
[1:50:48] it's well structured much of it
[1:50:50] but it's dead
[1:50:53] and that's why people are leaving is
[1:50:54] because there's no life in it
[1:50:57] i believe some of them have life in them
[1:50:58] that's waiting to be quickened and
[1:50:59] they're waiting to come under the
[1:51:00] message
[1:51:01] and that's what's going to quicken them
[1:51:02] but they sit there and they say this
[1:51:04] does nothing for me
[1:51:06] it does nothing for me it makes it has
[1:51:08] no effect on me
[1:51:10] i'm just sitting here listening to
[1:51:11] well-reasoned arguments
[1:51:13] but that's it
[1:51:15] might as well go listen to jordan
[1:51:17] peterson
[1:51:18] better at it than all of us preachers
[1:51:19] when it comes to reasoned arguments
[1:51:20] probably
[1:51:21] but there's no life in it
[1:51:24] he says what is it anointed one to
[1:51:26] continue his work that his word might
[1:51:28] live constantly
[1:51:30] he lived by the word of the father and
[1:51:32] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:51:34] every word that proceedeth from the
[1:51:35] mouth of god and the church don't live
[1:51:37] by bread alone but by the word of christ
[1:51:40] and the holy spirit comes in and takes
[1:51:42] the word of christ and makes it a living
[1:51:44] action today he says these signs shall
[1:51:47] follow them that believe
[1:51:50] now the first time was in their life
[1:51:52] and then those signs followed after
[1:51:55] and so often what he's trying to do is
[1:51:57] get this life here sorted out so that
[1:51:59] those things can come afterwards amen
[1:52:01] sometimes we're looking for the signs
[1:52:03] and wonders and god's saying but your
[1:52:04] life is in shambles
[1:52:06] you're nowhere near as mature as you
[1:52:08] need to be and you're sitting there and
[1:52:09] you're seeking signs and wonders and
[1:52:11] dreams and gifts and healings and this
[1:52:13] and that and the other thing and he's
[1:52:14] saying but your life's not even
[1:52:15] sanctified
[1:52:16] what am i supposed to do with that
[1:52:18] because he pours it into a vessel that's
[1:52:19] not cleaned out then what does it do it
[1:52:21] taints the gifts doesn't it attains the
[1:52:23] experience it taints the message that
[1:52:24] you're giving out to people so often
[1:52:26] what he's trying to do is get us to do
[1:52:28] what clean out so that he can actually
[1:52:29] use us
[1:52:30] empty vessels is what he wants
[1:52:33] amen
[1:52:35] if he says that we're supposed to live
[1:52:37] by the word
[1:52:39] that proceeds from the mouth of god the
[1:52:40] question is is that what we're feeding
[1:52:42] on
[1:52:44] not just me preaching it's not just
[1:52:46] brother jail preaching amen
[1:52:48] we said it last time brother bam says
[1:52:49] two things to get close to god read your
[1:52:51] bible and pray
[1:52:53] right
[1:52:54] that allows god to speak to you outside
[1:52:56] of any man and guess what he does it way
[1:52:59] better than i can
[1:53:01] way better than brother gerald kent
[1:53:02] and he cuts through to the heart of the
[1:53:04] matter
[1:53:05] if you'll read in honesty and you'll
[1:53:07] read with an open heart you'll read
[1:53:09] something and you just say yes lord
[1:53:11] that's me
[1:53:12] because sometimes if i'm saying it you
[1:53:14] think well he knows or he sees or this
[1:53:15] or that the other thing brother jail
[1:53:16] says it well he's known me for 40 years
[1:53:18] or 30 years or 20 years and no no but
[1:53:20] when you sit there and you read and the
[1:53:22] holy spirit's dropped down says that's
[1:53:23] for you son
[1:53:25] that's for you daughter
[1:53:26] that's when you grow
[1:53:28] amen
[1:53:29] sometimes it's because you don't do that
[1:53:31] that he's got to get the minister to
[1:53:32] talk to you about it
[1:53:34] but if you let him deal with it it would
[1:53:35] be a whole lot easier
[1:53:37] that's my experience at least
[1:53:39] amen
[1:53:43] what you're eating is what's going to
[1:53:44] come out you can't get it you can't get
[1:53:46] health by eating sugar all day
[1:53:48] right so what i'm saying is your your
[1:53:50] walk with god can always be about the
[1:53:52] fun times the great services and this
[1:53:53] the other thing there's got to be the
[1:53:55] tough times too you got to eat your
[1:53:57] vegetables
[1:53:58] right
[1:53:59] guess what gospel vegetables are just as
[1:54:01] horrible as real life vegetables
[1:54:03] they're not fun but you still got to eat
[1:54:05] them right
[1:54:06] you can't get peace out of eating
[1:54:07] distrust
[1:54:09] right
[1:54:10] you can't get joy out of eating symptoms
[1:54:12] all day
[1:54:13] talking about what the problem
[1:54:16] talking about the problem
[1:54:17] no joy's gonna come out of talking about
[1:54:19] the problem is it
[1:54:20] talk about the promise
[1:54:23] matthew 15 as we start to close he says
[1:54:25] and he called the multitude and said
[1:54:26] unto them hear and understand
[1:54:28] not that which goeth into the mouth
[1:54:30] defileth a man but that which cometh out
[1:54:32] of the mouth this defileth a man
[1:54:35] then answered peter and said unto him
[1:54:36] declare unto us this parable and jesus
[1:54:38] said are ye also yet without
[1:54:40] understanding
[1:54:41] do you not yet understand that
[1:54:42] whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
[1:54:44] goethe into the belly and it's cast out
[1:54:46] into the draw
[1:54:47] but those things which proceed out of
[1:54:49] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[1:54:51] they defile the man
[1:54:53] for out of the heart proceed evil
[1:54:55] thoughts
[1:54:56] murders adulteries fornications thefts
[1:54:59] false witness blasphemies
[1:55:02] learn a lesson here you can't stop
[1:55:04] what's in you from coming out
[1:55:09] right
[1:55:10] you speak out of the truth of the heart
[1:55:12] and you speak by action not just by
[1:55:14] words
[1:55:15] so brother or what jesus is saying here
[1:55:17] is he says whatever's in your heart is
[1:55:19] going to come out he says in the heart
[1:55:21] is where evil thoughts adulteries
[1:55:24] fornications
[1:55:26] he says that's in you there's something
[1:55:28] in you wanting that it's not that you
[1:55:29] get an opportunity it's that you want
[1:55:31] the opportunity and you recognize it
[1:55:32] when it comes
[1:55:34] right
[1:55:36] that's why the scripture says no man can
[1:55:37] say i'm tempted of god but he says what
[1:55:39] you're what led aside by your own lusts
[1:55:42] there's something in your heart that
[1:55:43] wanted it and then when the opportunity
[1:55:44] came you said i'm gonna take it
[1:55:46] god didn't give you a desire you had
[1:55:48] something inside of you wanting it and
[1:55:50] then you took advantage of it when you
[1:55:51] could
[1:55:53] he says these are the things which
[1:55:54] defile a man but to eat with unwashing
[1:55:57] hands defileth not a man
[1:56:01] last quote that's the thing god will do
[1:56:03] to his sons here on earth someday
[1:56:05] he will call you a side church if you'll
[1:56:07] only obey him
[1:56:09] stay on the word
[1:56:10] and believe it
[1:56:13] that's not difficult
[1:56:16] if you'll only obey him stay on the word
[1:56:19] and believe it
[1:56:20] and he will place into the church before
[1:56:22] the coming of christ
[1:56:24] all the powers that christ had in him
[1:56:26] will be in the church all that god was
[1:56:29] he poured into jesus all that jesus was
[1:56:31] he pours into the church god wanting his
[1:56:34] work done he sent it into his son the
[1:56:36] son wanting the work done sent it into
[1:56:38] his church
[1:56:39] at that day you'll know i'm in the
[1:56:41] father the father in me and i in you and
[1:56:44] you and me
[1:56:45] at that day because the same power of
[1:56:48] god was in jehovah god rested in jesus
[1:56:51] christ he says the same power that
[1:56:53] rested in jesus christ rests in the
[1:56:56] placed sons in the body of christ
[1:57:00] place sons this isn't for rookies
[1:57:03] this isn't for newbies
[1:57:05] this isn't people that just come out of
[1:57:06] the water
[1:57:08] like we read last time he says you're
[1:57:09] not born men you're born babes and you
[1:57:11] mature into men amen these are people
[1:57:13] that have gone through the process that
[1:57:15] have willfully submitted themselves to
[1:57:17] the chastening and changing hand of god
[1:57:20] to draw them to a place where they can
[1:57:22] be placed sons adopted sons and
[1:57:24] daughters of god where they're in a
[1:57:26] place now where he says i trust you and
[1:57:29] i'm giving you my authority i'm giving
[1:57:31] you the checkbook
[1:57:33] start writing it out in my will and
[1:57:35] whatever you ask
[1:57:36] that's what i'll do
[1:57:38] why because he knows you're going to do
[1:57:40] exactly what he told you to
[1:57:42] because what you've been found obedient
[1:57:44] to god
[1:57:45] faithful to his word and willing to act
[1:57:47] on it when he tells you to act on it
[1:57:49] amen
[1:57:50] there's a time of training and then
[1:57:51] there's a time of placing and then
[1:57:54] there's a time of work
[1:57:55] that's what we're going to go to next
[1:57:57] time amen god bless you stan if you
[1:57:58] would
[1:58:00] we don't get to skip any parts
[1:58:02] like i said we don't come out of the
[1:58:03] water get the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:58:05] and
[1:58:06] run around start doing a bunch of things
[1:58:08] for god he's going to have to train you
[1:58:12] remember when we're done
[1:58:14] he says you're perfect spotless
[1:58:18] the image of god the form of god in this
[1:58:21] last age amen
[1:58:24] amen let's bow our heads together
[1:58:26] heavenly father
[1:58:30] lord
[1:58:32] so often we see so little
[1:58:35] lord and we have a wonderful message
[1:58:38] lord we have an open book laying before
[1:58:40] us
[1:58:41] and lord i believe that it's not you
[1:58:43] that's holding back so many times lord
[1:58:45] it's us that's holding you back
[1:58:48] and lord if we'd only look deeper
[1:58:50] lord if we'd spend a little more time to
[1:58:52] give you an opportunity to open things
[1:58:54] up to us lord i believe we'd be a little
[1:58:55] further ahead maybe than we are tonight
[1:58:58] but lord i'm asking your grace for us
[1:59:01] lord we read last service lord that
[1:59:03] there you said there's a day when we
[1:59:04] would call on you and you would answer
[1:59:06] lord that we get to a place where our
[1:59:08] every desire our every moment was going
[1:59:10] to be spent calling on you because
[1:59:12] that's what mattered most to us heavenly
[1:59:14] father lord i pray you put a desperation
[1:59:16] in our hearts lord that you put souls on
[1:59:19] our minds lord that you'd put a burden
[1:59:21] there for changes in our own lives lord
[1:59:23] in our own families even in this church
[1:59:25] lord god lord that your holy spirit
[1:59:27] would just have such a freedom to move
[1:59:29] and reign in our hearts lord to do the
[1:59:31] perfect will of the father that's been
[1:59:32] called out in this age by a message
[1:59:35] lord we pray you lift us up
[1:59:37] lord separate us from the things of the
[1:59:38] world lord shake these things off of us
[1:59:40] that ought not to be there lord lord let
[1:59:43] us consecrate ourselves anew to you lord
[1:59:45] that you can fill us up again lord your
[1:59:47] prophet said there are there's one
[1:59:49] filling lord but many refillings and
[1:59:51] lord may you just fill our hearts again
[1:59:53] this evening lord and through the coming
[1:59:54] days and weeks lord as the battles come
[1:59:57] and go lord we pray that you would just
[1:59:58] reign in our hearts lord that we be
[2:00:00] looking for more and more of you lord
[2:00:03] that be we we'd be willing to die out to
[2:00:05] ourselves more and more each and every
[2:00:06] day we pray
[2:00:08] lord we know there's many need you lord
[2:00:10] not in this church even necessarily lord
[2:00:12] but many lord souls that are out there
[2:00:14] lord we pray that you bring them to the
[2:00:16] fold heavenly father lord that you'd
[2:00:18] finish this great work that you've
[2:00:19] started lord and that your holy spirit
[2:00:21] would just have free reign amongst us
[2:00:23] for granted now we pray in jesus

[2:19:39] 11 44
[2:19:41] it's each step of the way i'm following
[2:19:43] jesus
[2:19:45] i just i just thought i'd mention a
[2:19:48] little testimony i uh
[2:19:50] i was telling brenda and the kids just
[2:19:53] yesterday that uh
[2:19:55] well as i was out berry picking i was
[2:19:58] alone and in prayer and trying to out
[2:20:01] pick the girls
[2:20:02] and
[2:20:04] while i was there i got thinking about
[2:20:07] god and
[2:20:08] i just started hearing that that still
[2:20:10] small voice
[2:20:12] and
[2:20:13] and all it what he was telling me to do
[2:20:15] was keep on the path
[2:20:17] there was a past there was three there
[2:20:19] was three paths around me
[2:20:21] and
[2:20:22] and i was looking at one path and i was
[2:20:24] picking a few berries and just praying
[2:20:26] and
[2:20:27] and it kept coming back to me keep on
[2:20:28] the path and as i kept down the path i
[2:20:30] got lots of berries
[2:20:32] it might sound real simple but this is
[2:20:34] how he was working with me
[2:20:36] and
[2:20:37] and at one point
[2:20:38] i got off the path because i saw
[2:20:41] i saw a nice round big berry and i and i
[2:20:44] saw i saw it there
[2:20:45] so i got off the path and i went after
[2:20:47] my hips in a hole
[2:20:51] and the voice said
[2:20:53] stay on the path
[2:20:56] and i got back on the path and i started
[2:20:59] moving on that same path and i'd say
[2:21:00] which way would i go there's two or
[2:21:01] three paths and it said just stay on
[2:21:03] this path and i stayed on that path
[2:21:05] and i outpicked the girls
[2:21:07] ask matt he'll tell you
[2:21:10] but the point the point is and you know
[2:21:12] you take that further that doesn't apply
[2:21:15] only to berry picking you know it's it's
[2:21:17] our lives you know we
[2:21:20] god has given us a path to walker and he
[2:21:22] wants us to stay on that path and not
[2:21:24] deviate
[2:21:25] that the devil will try and deviate us
[2:21:27] but there's something that keeps holding
[2:21:28] us to that path
[2:21:30] right we're just saying about it and
[2:21:32] we're going to sing about it now
[2:21:33] following jesus stay on that path
[2:21:36] right
[2:21:37] but it was a real lesson i was really
[2:21:38] blessed with it was just me and him
[2:21:41] it was wonderful
[2:21:43] just in that simplicity stay on that
[2:21:46] path when you get off you'll fall into a
[2:21:48] hole and into a ditch and the devil has
[2:21:50] got you right so you shake loose and you
[2:21:53] get back out you say sorry lord i didn't
[2:21:55] do what you told me to do i'll follow
[2:21:57] your path and then he'll he walks with
[2:21:59] you
[2:22:00] he'll just walk with you he'll hold your
[2:22:01] hand
[2:22:02] just let him do it
[2:22:05] that's how i would encourage everybody
[2:22:07] stay on the path
