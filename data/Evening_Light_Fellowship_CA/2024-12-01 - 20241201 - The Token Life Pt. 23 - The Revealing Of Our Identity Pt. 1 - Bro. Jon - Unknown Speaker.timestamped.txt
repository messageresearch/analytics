[50:12] that reality of its Victory every day in
[50:14] our lives Lord God Lord that your spirit

[50:48] God bless you turn if you would the Book
[50:50] of Genesis easy scripture to find this
[50:52] morning first book first chapter amen
[50:55] God bless you each one good to see each
[50:57] one that's made it good to see brother
[50:58] Blair here all the way from BC he'll be
[51:01] driving back with brother Dale so we
[51:03] want to remember them that God would
[51:04] grant them traveling mercies amen it's
[51:06] always good to see a visitor not so good
[51:08] when they're taking away one of our own
[51:10] amen but we'll forgive him as long as he
[51:12] promises to come back and visit us again
[51:14] some other time amen as brother Bob
[51:17] mentioned I'll be headed out this
[51:18] afternoon to go to Central to go moose
[51:19] hunting so Lord willing I'll be there
[51:21] and come back Friday night if I get my
[51:24] animal quickly I may be back a bit early
[51:26] but regardless I'm hoping to get some
[51:28] time of fellowship with brother Hank
[51:29] sister Verna brother back if I get a day
[51:32] I'll I'll head out and see brother Doug
[51:34] and sister Beverly as well but we'll see
[51:36] uh how that goes it's all in the Lord's
[51:38] hands but in the meantime brother Mark
[51:39] will take the service on Wednesday night
[51:42] um so I'm trusting you'll be in prayer
[51:43] for that and you'll enjoy that amen I
[51:45] certainly enjoy it when I listen in and
[51:47] I'm able to my eye is almost 100% it's
[51:50] about 95% but I'm just wearing my
[51:52] glasses out of precaution this morning I
[51:54] don't want to aggravate anything before
[51:56] I head out to Central but I'm
[51:58] appreciative for God's healing there
[51:59] amen God bless you Genesis 1 very
[52:01] familiar scripture says this in the
[52:04] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[52:06] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[52:08] void and darkness was upon the face of
[52:10] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[52:13] upon the face of the waters and God said
[52:15] let there be light and there was light
[52:17] and God saw the light that it was good
[52:20] and God divided the light from the
[52:22] darkness and God called the light day
[52:24] and the Darkness he called night and the
[52:26] evening and the morning were the first
[52:29] day amen God bless you you can have your
[52:30] seats this morning may God bless his
[52:32] word amen we're continuing our series on
[52:34] the Holy Ghost amen and this is our 23rd
[52:38] service preaching on the token life and
[52:40] I want to take a couple of services
[52:42] excuse me this morning on this thought
[52:45] of the revealing of our identity amen
[52:47] and I preached like I said 23 services
[52:50] on the Holy Spirit and what it means to
[52:52] the believer today and you know some of
[52:54] those Services maybe you could take that
[52:55] and you could go hear a similar service
[52:58] in in just about any Pentecostal church
[53:00] or any Bible believing church and it's
[53:03] it's something that maybe the world is
[53:04] understood in the terms of the Christian
[53:06] world Amen but I believe we're preaching
[53:08] far more than just a generic message
[53:10] this morning I believe we've got a
[53:12] message that takes us into a fully open
[53:14] Word and so I want to take us into some
[53:16] of that depth this morning and over the
[53:18] coming Services amen and I believe
[53:20] there's more to this uh our
[53:22] understanding our reality of the Holy
[53:24] Spirit than we've ever had cuz the
[53:26] scriptures says if the same spirit that
[53:27] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[53:30] it will Quicken your mortal bodies amen
[53:32] so we've got a Rapture and a
[53:33] resurrection by the Holy Spirit that's
[53:35] what it is it is our literal Rapture and
[53:37] Resurrection but until we go that means
[53:40] there's a change that's got to happen to
[53:41] bring us to a rapturing a Rapture Ready
[53:45] condition amen so I believe there's more
[53:46] of an understanding because with
[53:48] understanding comes the reality behind
[53:50] that understanding God opens his word so
[53:52] that we will believe for it we'll expect
[53:54] it for it we'll accept it and then it
[53:56] will come into our lives amen but I want
[53:59] to talk this morning about the plan of
[54:01] God and how God works and how God
[54:03] reveals himself in us and there's a plan
[54:05] that he's got and it's not a new plan
[54:08] amen we're not God isn't coming up with
[54:09] something he's not sitting down with a
[54:11] group of advisers adapting to the way
[54:13] the world's going and the situation and
[54:15] the circumstances around us but God set
[54:18] a plan and it was a plan way before time
[54:20] even began before the world really came
[54:22] into its current form amen but when it
[54:25] started moving at the beginning as we
[54:27] read here God set his plan in motion and
[54:29] that plan's been in works now for over
[54:32] 6,000 years and God's been letting it
[54:34] unfold and it's right on time amen we
[54:37] can look in the word and we can see that
[54:39] God's plan is right on time because we
[54:41] can turn especially as we look at the
[54:42] Book of Revelation and we can see we're
[54:44] exactly where we ought to be in sync
[54:47] with the church ages in sync with the
[54:49] the condition of the world and sync with
[54:51] the economies and sync with the
[54:52] religious world and we can see God's
[54:54] plan is coming to pass exactly as he
[54:57] ordained it amen and so we have a word
[55:00] that confirms that God knows what's
[55:01] going on he knew it before it happened
[55:04] and he's already made a plan that works
[55:06] through all of these different things
[55:08] but I want to take us back to our
[55:09] opening scripture this morning to talk
[55:11] about the revealing of our identity and
[55:13] the scripture says in the beginning God
[55:15] created the Heaven and the Earth full
[55:18] stop this is not a semicolon it's not a
[55:21] colon It's a period full stop brother
[55:23] Brandon would say we don't know how long
[55:25] the Earth sat there in that condition it
[55:27] could have been one day it could have
[55:28] been an hour it could have been millions
[55:30] of years it could have been billions of
[55:32] years amen but when God created that
[55:35] Earth in that form it had everything
[55:38] that was needed to to sustain life
[55:41] everything was there but it was not yet
[55:43] under the conditions that would allow it
[55:45] to do it it wasn't in a mature condition
[55:47] he created the Earth as a seed itself
[55:50] amen but everything was just inside of
[55:52] it but it wasn't the way it was meant to
[55:54] be it wasn't in its fully mature
[55:57] condition amen the seeds were buried in
[55:59] the dirt but there was no plants yet
[56:01] everything was covered by water there
[56:02] was no light in the heavens but yet
[56:04] everything that was going to be needed
[56:06] to sustain life was in the Earth right
[56:08] there and then the scripture says in two
[56:11] and this is just the first half of the
[56:13] Scripture it says the Earth was without
[56:15] form and void and darkness was upon the
[56:18] face of the deep now if we look at a
[56:20] creation like this and we know it's
[56:22] intent our our our human nature is that
[56:25] we would go and we'd start pulling
[56:26] levers quickly to get this earth into
[56:29] its intended condition when we see
[56:31] things the way they ought not to be when
[56:33] we see hardship when we see pain and
[56:35] suffering when we see things that are
[56:36] out of order our human nature wants to
[56:39] go and start setting things right we
[56:41] want to jump in there and we want to
[56:43] take it from where it is to where it
[56:45] ought to be to its intended purpose amen
[56:48] and looking at this Earth as humans and
[56:50] we if we could see through the eyes of
[56:52] God and see how great and wonderful and
[56:54] beautiful it was going to be our human
[56:57] nature would say let's get things going
[56:59] and we'd hire the contractors and we get
[57:01] the Earth moving equipment and we we get
[57:03] all of the the climatologist to come in
[57:05] and let's get this thing working the way
[57:07] that it was supposed to work amen but
[57:09] God doesn't do things our way God has a
[57:13] plan and time means nothing to God time
[57:16] is a human construct not a god con God a
[57:20] god concept if we were to put it that
[57:21] way but I want us to put on our
[57:23] spiritual Minds this morning because I'm
[57:25] not here to preach about the Earth I'm
[57:27] here to preach about you amen and so
[57:29] when we look at conditions when we look
[57:31] at circumstances and we look at what's
[57:33] going on we've got to understand that
[57:35] God works differently than we do amen
[57:38] that when things aren't where they ought
[57:40] to be that doesn't mean they get to be
[57:41] the way they should be immediately
[57:43] because we recognize its intended
[57:45] purpose or plan God's got a way of doing
[57:48] things amen God is the master of
[57:50] circumstances God doesn't react to
[57:52] circumstances again that's a human thing
[57:54] we react to circumstances but because
[57:56] God knows all things God is the master
[57:59] of circumstances and therefore
[58:01] circumstances react to God rather than
[58:03] God reacting to circumstances amen God
[58:06] takes troubles and he puts bits in their
[58:07] mouth amen God is using everything
[58:10] that's happening it's all working for
[58:12] our good who are the called according to
[58:14] his purpose watch how brother Bram says
[58:17] this he says there was nothing but just
[58:18] a darkness of
[58:20] chaos and what a horrible shape it must
[58:23] have been in nothing but we into the
[58:25] darkness Yonder without light or
[58:27] anything and the churning of the water
[58:29] and that wandering star twisted around
[58:31] and around the orbits out there
[58:33] somewhere it must have been a terrific
[58:35] mass of something lost like it was it
[58:38] couldn't find its way then he says these
[58:40] words he says and that's what we become
[58:43] when we become wandering Stars away from
[58:46] God just without hope without God he
[58:49] says just churning around out in
[58:51] darkness not knowing where we're going
[58:54] he says and God took that great chaos of
[58:57] Darkness Hallelujah and transformed it
[59:01] into a Garden of Eden see by his word he
[59:04] says that's how we are transformed by
[59:06] God's word when God said let there be
[59:09] light and that mass of creation out
[59:11] there come over in and around the Sun
[59:13] and begin to revolve around it and
[59:15] became a Garden of Eden because it
[59:18] obeyed the word of God that's how it
[59:22] happened amen he says it did the perfect
[59:24] will of God for it was transformed from
[59:27] chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word
[59:29] of God now did the earth do that by
[59:32] choice does the Earth have a
[59:35] will no does the Earth have a mind no it
[59:38] did not do it by choice but rather under
[59:41] the hearing of the word of God there was
[59:44] a power behind that word and that word
[59:47] took authority over the darkness it took
[59:49] authority over the chaos and it brought
[59:52] it into subjection by the word of God
[59:55] Amen that's how it works amen it's a
[59:58] created object it has no will it has no
[1:00:00] power God took it under the control of
[1:00:03] the word of God he says now that's what
[1:00:06] we're here for that's my message and has
[1:00:09] been all along is the word of God we
[1:00:11] must hold to that regardless of what
[1:00:13] other things take place always stay with
[1:00:16] that word always check out your motives
[1:00:19] and objectives if it is according to the
[1:00:21] word of God if it isn't leave it alone
[1:00:25] he says but if it's with the word of God
[1:00:28] and lines up with the word of God then
[1:00:30] you hold to that he says now God
[1:00:32] sometimes just like your little group
[1:00:34] here this morning he lets it not happen
[1:00:38] just
[1:00:40] overnight he says we're the one that
[1:00:42] gets in a hurry God is never in a hurry
[1:00:46] he says he just says it and it's going
[1:00:49] to be for when he says anything it's got
[1:00:53] to be it's just going to be he lets it
[1:00:56] take its time see God isn't worried time
[1:00:59] is nothing to him he's a creature he not
[1:01:02] a creature he is eternity he's outside
[1:01:04] of time amen but you look at Abraham and
[1:01:07] Sarah God comes down in Sovereign Grace
[1:01:09] and Mercy calls them out of Earth calls
[1:01:12] them out of an idolatrous people and he
[1:01:14] gives them a promise of a great nation a
[1:01:17] promise of a son and what does it do
[1:01:20] takes 25 years to happen to the point
[1:01:23] where they are completely in a place
[1:01:25] where they can't produ produce it and
[1:01:27] then all they get is the one son God
[1:01:30] says I'm going to make you a great
[1:01:31] nation then he gives him one Lord what
[1:01:34] are you doing I've given you enough and
[1:01:36] then that out of that one Isaac he goes
[1:01:38] and he marries Rebecca now he's supposed
[1:01:41] to be the one that really starts to
[1:01:42] spring up that's what God told and a and
[1:01:45] Isaac and Rebecca can't have
[1:01:49] children it's in chaos it's in darkness
[1:01:52] the promise of God seems of no effect
[1:01:54] and Isaac Liv literally has to go to God
[1:01:57] and pray for children before God gives
[1:02:00] him Jacob and
[1:02:03] Esau see God's not in a hurry look at
[1:02:06] Israel Israel has a promise for a land
[1:02:08] of their own and it takes almost 500
[1:02:11] years for God to give it to them and in
[1:02:13] the meantime they're in darkness they're
[1:02:16] in chaos they're in slavery they're in
[1:02:17] all of these things 430 years under
[1:02:20] bondage and then another 40 years in the
[1:02:22] desert 470 years of hard times
[1:02:27] is God
[1:02:28] worried who's worried this
[1:02:31] morning this
[1:02:33] guy
[1:02:36] right time means nothing to God Amen
[1:02:40] when nothing's happening in our eyes it
[1:02:43] doesn't mean nothing's
[1:02:44] happening it just means we can't see it
[1:02:47] yet amen but there's something that's
[1:02:49] going on Amen because when God speaks
[1:02:50] his word brother Bram says it's done it
[1:02:53] has to happen it's going to be there's
[1:02:55] nothing that can stop these things but
[1:02:57] watch how things start to change as God
[1:02:59] comes down and and he sees that this
[1:03:01] world is in darkness amen because we're
[1:03:03] trying to see how he works with us I'm
[1:03:06] trying to show you this morning and we
[1:03:07] we won't finish it this morning by any
[1:03:09] means but I'm trying to show you how
[1:03:10] we're going to get into a Rapture and
[1:03:11] the resurrection I want to show you how
[1:03:14] the plan of God works because the Earth
[1:03:16] is in darkness it's in chaos that means
[1:03:19] it's out of order nothing's in its right
[1:03:21] place it's not working the systems of
[1:03:23] the Earth are broken amen the parts are
[1:03:25] all there but nothing's working it's
[1:03:27] like if you buy a thing of Lego if you
[1:03:29] just shake it up a little bit it doesn't
[1:03:31] turn itself into the picture that's on
[1:03:33] the box it needs somebody to come in and
[1:03:35] put the pieces together properly in the
[1:03:37] right order amen but the world is just
[1:03:39] dark it's cold it's out of order it's
[1:03:41] wet it's stormy nothing about it is
[1:03:43] appealing and certainly nothing there
[1:03:45] will sustain life but Watch What Happens
[1:03:48] now because it says and the Earth was
[1:03:50] without form and void and darkness was
[1:03:52] upon the face of the deep but then
[1:03:55] something happened it says and the
[1:03:58] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:04:01] waters amen when the spirit of God moves
[1:04:04] that's when things start to change anden
[1:04:06] it seems like nothing's happening and
[1:04:08] it's been maybe millions or billions of
[1:04:10] years but then the spirit of God moves
[1:04:12] and when the spirit of God moves things
[1:04:14] change that word move there it means to
[1:04:17] relax to brood to grow soft to hover
[1:04:21] this is literally the same word that
[1:04:23] they use for Mary when the the Holy
[1:04:26] Spirit overshadowed her when the Holy
[1:04:28] Spirit overshadowed her and produced
[1:04:30] life inside of her it was the brooding
[1:04:33] of the Holy Spirit over a Darkness over
[1:04:37] something that was without without
[1:04:39] greatness without deity that was that
[1:04:41] was out of its position and yet it comes
[1:04:43] down and what does the moving of the
[1:04:45] spirit do it starts to bring things in
[1:04:48] order so that life can come forth that's
[1:04:51] what the moving of the spirit of does
[1:04:53] Amen its purpose is to bring life amen
[1:04:55] the the presence of God and we felt it
[1:04:58] many times the presence of God is there
[1:05:00] to bring life it's there to bring things
[1:05:03] to their to the their proper position
[1:05:05] amen we'll see that life doesn't happen
[1:05:08] in
[1:05:09] winter nothing grows in winter why
[1:05:12] because it's cold it's windy it's snowy
[1:05:15] you have way less sunshine and you have
[1:05:16] shorter days of sunshine it's not
[1:05:20] conducive to life but in the spring as
[1:05:22] things start to change the atmosphere
[1:05:24] changes and what's the changing of the
[1:05:26] atmosphere do it starts to bring forth
[1:05:29] life but watch how this atmosphere works
[1:05:32] because so often we miss how God works
[1:05:34] in these things amen the atmosphere
[1:05:36] doesn't sit there and do nothing but
[1:05:38] rather than the spirit of God moves it
[1:05:40] brings a message amen it brings the very
[1:05:43] word of God there's times where we can
[1:05:45] feel the presence of God but we've got
[1:05:47] to say Lord what would you have for your
[1:05:49] servant cuz he doesn't just come yes he
[1:05:52] comes to comfort us yes he comes to
[1:05:54] reassure us but he comes with a word
[1:05:56] because that's where the power is to the
[1:05:58] believer is in the word and that's what
[1:06:00] the spirit's quickening inside each and
[1:06:02] every one of us he comes with something
[1:06:04] that we can rest on cuz the feeling's
[1:06:06] going to go amen you don't know if God
[1:06:09] is with you or or not with you by
[1:06:11] feeling I don't feel him every service I
[1:06:14] don't feel him every day as I'm walking
[1:06:16] around every hour that I'm awake but I
[1:06:18] know he's there because his word says
[1:06:20] I'll never leave you or forsake you he
[1:06:22] says I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:06:24] end of the age I know know he's there by
[1:06:26] his word that his Spirit brought when it
[1:06:29] came to me and when it comes to you
[1:06:31] that's my rest amen so no matter where
[1:06:34] we are when we come into the presence of
[1:06:36] God its purpose is to bring Life by the
[1:06:39] word amen God doesn't just come with his
[1:06:42] presence but he comes with his word
[1:06:44] that's why the evidence of the holy
[1:06:45] spirit is not signs and wonders it's not
[1:06:48] speaking in tongues it's not prophesying
[1:06:50] or any of these things because those
[1:06:52] things can be put into a vessel that is
[1:06:54] without form and void something that is
[1:06:56] out of order something that's in chaos
[1:06:58] when Paul came with his message that he
[1:07:00] got on the backside of the desert of
[1:07:02] Arabia what did he come and do he set
[1:07:04] things in order because what happened is
[1:07:07] people were coming to church to speak in
[1:07:09] tongues to prophesy to give a word of
[1:07:11] knowledge to to interpret and do all of
[1:07:14] these things and Paul was coming to say
[1:07:16] that is not going to work that's not
[1:07:18] going to produce life that's not the
[1:07:20] purpose of the spirit that's the effect
[1:07:22] of the spirit you're focused so much on
[1:07:24] the effect but you're missing the the
[1:07:25] purpose the purpose is to set things in
[1:07:27] order and that's what his message did it
[1:07:30] set them in order so they could what
[1:07:32] receive life rather than just receive
[1:07:34] the effects of the spirit
[1:07:37] amen that word put the atmosphere into
[1:07:41] order that word put the atmosphere into
[1:07:44] order so that atmosphere that God create
[1:07:47] caused created caused the word of God to
[1:07:49] be spoken and to come in reality so
[1:07:51] watch now verse three it says and God
[1:07:54] said let there be light
[1:07:58] pause and there was
[1:08:00] light remember in
[1:08:03] adoption brother bam would talk about
[1:08:05] speaking the
[1:08:06] word listen when God speaks it did not
[1:08:10] say it happened immediately it said God
[1:08:12] spoke and then it happened now that Gap
[1:08:16] may have been a millisecond or it might
[1:08:18] have been a thousand years we don't know
[1:08:21] we don't know what happened but when he
[1:08:23] spoke it was going to happen because his
[1:08:25] word words are spoken with power amen it
[1:08:28] says and then there was light not and
[1:08:29] then there was light pause and there was
[1:08:31] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:08:34] good and God divided the light from the
[1:08:35] darkness and God called the light day
[1:08:38] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:08:40] evening and the morning were the first
[1:08:42] day now there's so much to unpack here
[1:08:44] and I'm not going to do it this morning
[1:08:45] because we preached on this but we saw
[1:08:47] that the first thing that God created
[1:08:49] was light and it was not the sun moon
[1:08:51] and stars that was the fourth day but
[1:08:53] the light that he created here was the
[1:08:55] pillar of fire a dwelling place for God
[1:08:58] to be in amen and that body had no
[1:09:00] darkness in it it had no shadow of
[1:09:02] turning as the scripture says it was
[1:09:04] pure light and it conquered all Darkness
[1:09:06] there was a clear separation between
[1:09:08] this light and everything else amen
[1:09:11] everything else is called Darkness
[1:09:13] there's light and then there's
[1:09:14] everything else and everything else is
[1:09:15] darkness and that Darkness could not
[1:09:17] conquer it Amen brother says this he
[1:09:19] says the world was without form and it
[1:09:21] was void and darkness was upon the Earth
[1:09:24] nothing but complete chaos and when this
[1:09:27] world was in that condition the spirit
[1:09:29] of God moved upon the face of the water
[1:09:32] and the entire picture was changed from
[1:09:34] Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden he says
[1:09:37] that is the transforming power of God
[1:09:41] now catch this that's the transforming
[1:09:43] power of God that can take something
[1:09:45] that's nothing and make something
[1:09:48] wonderful out of it Hallelujah that's
[1:09:51] who we are this morning amen that God
[1:09:53] can take nothing and make something
[1:09:54] wonderful full out of it now notice he
[1:09:56] didn't add anything to
[1:09:59] it nor did he take anything away from it
[1:10:02] when he did this it was already there he
[1:10:06] just brought it to its predestinated
[1:10:09] condition according to his plan
[1:10:11] according to the great idea that he had
[1:10:14] in his mind amen it's nothing in that
[1:10:16] it's not in life it's not in order it's
[1:10:19] not the way it's supposed to be doesn't
[1:10:20] mean there's nothing there it's that
[1:10:22] it's not doing what it's supposed to be
[1:10:23] doing and it can't do it it self
[1:10:26] remember scripture says can a man by
[1:10:27] taking thought add a cubit of stature to
[1:10:29] himself he can't do it I can't think
[1:10:31] about being 7t tall and then become 7t
[1:10:33] tall the seed can't become come to life
[1:10:36] by thinking about it it takes an
[1:10:38] external Force amen but lot why did God
[1:10:42] create that light first because notice
[1:10:44] he created that Pillar of Fire but we
[1:10:47] see that that light is life
[1:10:49] itself amen see we think that the light
[1:10:52] of the sun is what matters most because
[1:10:54] that's what ains life here on Earth but
[1:10:56] that's not what God created first but
[1:10:59] rather God created something else first
[1:11:02] and I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:11:03] it's because you were Central in his
[1:11:05] mind when he was doing this creation
[1:11:08] amen I'm here to show you who you are
[1:11:10] this morning in a little way that you
[1:11:11] may not have seen before because when
[1:11:13] God created that first thing and that
[1:11:15] Pillar of Fire he did it with purpose
[1:11:17] and we've read the scripture so many
[1:11:19] times in this series but I'll read it
[1:11:20] again in John 1 he says in the beginning
[1:11:23] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:11:25] and the Word was God the same was in the
[1:11:28] beginning with God all things were made
[1:11:31] by him and without him was not one thing
[1:11:34] made that was made and it says in him
[1:11:37] was life and the life was the light of
[1:11:40] men he says and the light shineth in
[1:11:43] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[1:11:45] it not so we look at the Earth and
[1:11:47] botney life and animals and vegetation
[1:11:50] as those things are critical and they're
[1:11:52] they're beautiful but I want you to see
[1:11:54] something here amen that the first thing
[1:11:56] that God created was that which was
[1:11:58] critical to my life and your life not to
[1:12:00] their life the first thing that God
[1:12:03] created was what was necessary for you
[1:12:05] and I to live
[1:12:07] eternally rather than live on this Earth
[1:12:10] amen the first thing that he created was
[1:12:12] a body for himself that he could later
[1:12:14] divide and put into his sons and
[1:12:17] daughters so they could be with him no
[1:12:18] matter what condition this world was in
[1:12:21] the first thing he created was that
[1:12:22] which pertains to our eternal life not
[1:12:24] to this temporal life then and only then
[1:12:27] did he move on to setting things up for
[1:12:29] our natural existence amen God's
[1:12:32] greatest priority is for his family it's
[1:12:34] for his bride for his elect seed to be
[1:12:36] eternally with him and everything is
[1:12:38] secondary to him everything else the
[1:12:40] first thing is his family amen the first
[1:12:43] priority for God was to put himself in a
[1:12:44] form that could indwell you and I that's
[1:12:47] the very first thing he did Brother B
[1:12:49] says this he says the difference is just
[1:12:51] like it was in the beginning where there
[1:12:53] was gross Darkness upon the Earth are we
[1:12:55] in Gross Darkness now we are in Gross
[1:12:58] Darkness it's gross as in it's great and
[1:13:00] it's as in it there's a lot of it and
[1:13:03] it's gross and is in it's disgusting
[1:13:05] we're at it we're in every every way
[1:13:07] that gross could be gross he says when
[1:13:09] there was gross Darkness upon the earth
[1:13:11] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:13:13] face of the water and said let there be
[1:13:16] light and God separated the light from
[1:13:18] the darkness now catch this he says and
[1:13:21] I believe that we're now living in that
[1:13:23] hour again
[1:13:25] when God is separating light from
[1:13:28] darkness and he's pressing it to this
[1:13:30] other side of the world that the light
[1:13:33] might be made manifest what's the
[1:13:36] purpose of the light of God to drive
[1:13:38] away Darkness to allow life to be where
[1:13:41] it wasn't before that's the purpose of
[1:13:44] it amen when life comes forth it proves
[1:13:46] what's in each seed because it brings
[1:13:48] out the source of the plant it brings
[1:13:50] out the intentions of the plant by
[1:13:52] causing it to grow listen you can't grow
[1:13:55] up a thorn and say I'm here to make
[1:13:57] people feel good that's not it you can
[1:14:00] see why the light that produces life in
[1:14:02] you that you're meant to cause harm that
[1:14:05] you're meant to protect that you're
[1:14:07] meant to be a barrier so that things
[1:14:08] won't go through and around you but at
[1:14:11] the beginning of Life when we look at
[1:14:12] everything that's in the ground and the
[1:14:14] seeds they might look very much the same
[1:14:16] and I looked up this picture on the
[1:14:17] internet and you look how a lot of those
[1:14:19] seeds especially that second column over
[1:14:22] those first four look pretty close they
[1:14:24] look look like they're almost the same
[1:14:26] thing even in seed form they look very
[1:14:30] similar but as you go from one side to
[1:14:32] the other you see that they go from
[1:14:34] bulbous and dark to lighter to skinnier
[1:14:36] to odd shapes and lumps and and prickly
[1:14:39] and all these different things and you
[1:14:41] say well I know what that is by the seed
[1:14:42] but not everything can be distinguished
[1:14:44] by the seed by most people an expert
[1:14:47] would know but you and I probably
[1:14:49] wouldn't be able to to understand but as
[1:14:51] these grow and they mature then the
[1:14:53] differences start to show and we start
[1:14:55] to understand hey that wasn't what I
[1:14:57] thought it was it's something different
[1:14:59] amen the longer they're alive the more
[1:15:01] we realize what each plant is what its
[1:15:03] purpose is whether it's good for us
[1:15:05] whether it's bad for us but in that
[1:15:07] first little while they all look very
[1:15:09] much the same when you see a little
[1:15:11] sprig of something come out of the
[1:15:12] ground you can't tell me most of us if
[1:15:14] that's a a thing of grass if it's a
[1:15:16] piece of corn that's going to be growing
[1:15:18] maybe it might even be wheat cuz it's
[1:15:20] just a little piece of green that comes
[1:15:21] out but then it turns into a bean plant
[1:15:24] and you're like oh well that's or a
[1:15:25] tomato plant or whatever and you start
[1:15:27] to understand as the leaves start to
[1:15:28] come out that gives you an idea but then
[1:15:30] as the fruit comes then you know for
[1:15:32] sure exactly what it is but it's
[1:15:34] interesting they found this plant in the
[1:15:37] Amazon and it's called Bia
[1:15:41] trifoliolata and it's in the Amazon and
[1:15:43] it mimics the plants that are around it
[1:15:46] so you probably can't see it so well
[1:15:48] here but the yellow the yellow arrows
[1:15:50] are pointing to this this Bia
[1:15:53] trifoliolata
[1:15:55] and if you'll notice it looks very
[1:15:57] similar to the plants around it and it
[1:15:59] can look completely different when it's
[1:16:00] next to one plant than it can to another
[1:16:03] and they don't know how it does this CU
[1:16:05] plants don't have Minds as far as we
[1:16:07] know they don't have a Consciousness but
[1:16:09] yet they can mimic very closely the
[1:16:11] plants that are around them so you look
[1:16:12] in the bottom leftand corner and you see
[1:16:15] that it's got a more Jagged appearance
[1:16:17] and then if you go look up uh even look
[1:16:19] to the one right next to it or the two
[1:16:21] next to it you'll see it's a much
[1:16:22] rounder appearance and sometimes it's
[1:16:24] really veiny some sometimes it's very
[1:16:25] rounded and flat and smooth in these
[1:16:28] different
[1:16:29] things and so it's changing its
[1:16:31] appearance based on what it's around
[1:16:33] we've got Believers like
[1:16:36] that you got talk to them one day and
[1:16:39] they're all all high up in the clouds
[1:16:40] and super spiritual and then you go talk
[1:16:42] to them and they're with this group and
[1:16:43] they're putting down this one they're
[1:16:45] putting down and what is it they're
[1:16:46] changing based on the people they are
[1:16:48] they are
[1:16:49] around but here's the thing the true
[1:16:52] plants that it's mimicking are that
[1:16:54] shape for a reason and it is there so
[1:16:57] they can grow so they can mature it's
[1:16:59] there to protect them from parasites and
[1:17:02] from insects and these different things
[1:17:04] and so The Showdown comes when a
[1:17:06] parasite comes or a disease comes and it
[1:17:09] can't touch the real plant but if it if
[1:17:11] an animal will ever bite through and
[1:17:13] realize that that one's a fake all of
[1:17:16] its appearances won't help it because it
[1:17:19] doesn't have what's required to save it
[1:17:21] from the
[1:17:23] thing that the other one is protected
[1:17:25] from you can't be what you're not can't
[1:17:29] be what you're not Church you can't put
[1:17:31] on listen we can put on the clothes we
[1:17:33] can say the right thing we can go to the
[1:17:35] right church we can do it the same as
[1:17:37] everything around us and everyone around
[1:17:39] us amen but until the spirit of God
[1:17:42] comes in and shows our true colors we
[1:17:44] don't know who and what we are but we
[1:17:46] can sit under that word and as we see
[1:17:48] ourselves changing it rather than
[1:17:50] changing ourselves see that's the key I
[1:17:53] can't change myself
[1:17:55] I can't do it I'm a seed but if I can
[1:17:58] let the light and the environment around
[1:18:00] me produce what's inside of me I'll see
[1:18:02] what's natural but I can't be putting
[1:18:04] things on Amen the spirit of God sends
[1:18:06] light and Life to us and it produces and
[1:18:09] it makes it abundantly clear whether
[1:18:10] we're the real deal or
[1:18:11] notam says this way he says and the
[1:18:13] first light was ever given in the Earth
[1:18:15] was God's spoken word the first light
[1:18:17] that ever struck the Earth was God's
[1:18:19] spoken word he said let there be light
[1:18:21] and there was light that turned Darkness
[1:18:24] into light in order to bring forth the
[1:18:26] creation of joy and life upon the Earth
[1:18:30] and for its first time it was to bring
[1:18:32] joy and life to the Earth by a seed he
[1:18:36] says that was a great hour how does the
[1:18:38] seed bring joy and life there's no joy
[1:18:41] when you plant it it's work you can't
[1:18:44] see it you don't know what's going on
[1:18:47] but when do you have joy with a seed
[1:18:49] when it comes out and you say hey it's
[1:18:51] alive I didn't kill it I do have a green
[1:18:53] thumb I'm GNA have
[1:18:56] tomatoes you know brother brother
[1:18:58] kingsley's wife gave my wife a a
[1:19:00] pineapple
[1:19:02] plant I think she was fooled about the
[1:19:05] conditions of Newan land before she came
[1:19:07] here I think Kingsley had told her it's
[1:19:09] a tropical
[1:19:11] island I just think he forgot to tell
[1:19:13] her it's an Atlantic tropical island but
[1:19:16] she gave her a pineapple plant and if
[1:19:19] you go to our house now you'll see that
[1:19:22] it's got a little pineapple about this
[1:19:23] big but you know what that's as big as
[1:19:26] it's ever going to get cuz we don't have
[1:19:29] the climate here to produce it but it'll
[1:19:32] only go so far but you know what just
[1:19:35] seeing that little pineapple right there
[1:19:37] we can say technically we grew a
[1:19:39] pineapple in Newan land praise the Lord
[1:19:43] what is the joy the joy is when the seed
[1:19:45] comes to
[1:19:47] maturity right when it comes all the way
[1:19:49] and I remember brother Mark's old
[1:19:51] Greenhouse there and you go in there and
[1:19:53] there' be Tomatoes there and these
[1:19:55] different things and you go in you'd say
[1:19:56] this is wonderful if you like tomatoes
[1:19:58] right that was the joy that it came amen
[1:20:01] it brings Joy not just when it it comes
[1:20:04] out of the ground that's great and
[1:20:06] there's Beauty there and and these
[1:20:07] different things but when that seed is
[1:20:09] in maturity that's when it brings Joy
[1:20:12] because now its purpose is fully
[1:20:13] revealed and you can enjoy it if it's
[1:20:15] for food you can eat the food if it's
[1:20:17] for shade you can enjoy the shade if
[1:20:19] it's for beauty you can enjoy its beauty
[1:20:21] if it's for protection you can enjoy its
[1:20:23] protection that's where The Joy comes
[1:20:25] amen but as soon as those conditions are
[1:20:27] right you can start to have joy because
[1:20:30] you know that it's going to come forth
[1:20:32] it's going to produce itself amen but
[1:20:34] everything we see is in seed form the
[1:20:37] Earth itself was a a seed Earth if we
[1:20:39] wanted to call it that way amen and then
[1:20:41] within that Earth were other smaller
[1:20:43] seeds for for for the plants and botney
[1:20:46] life and these things but it took the
[1:20:47] personal presence and the atmosphere of
[1:20:50] God followed by the word of God to put
[1:20:53] everything in order so that God plan
[1:20:55] could become
[1:20:56] obvious the word itself is a seed Jesus
[1:20:59] said many times and we have to
[1:21:01] understand that because we're a seed a
[1:21:03] word seed bride and and we've got to
[1:21:06] understand the way that a seed works
[1:21:07] because the word seed is thought
[1:21:10] Allelujah then it's spoken and then it's
[1:21:14] planted and then it comes out under the
[1:21:18] the the presence of God Amen when God is
[1:21:21] speaking that word that's when he plants
[1:21:24] it
[1:21:25] it's planted and it can sit there for
[1:21:27] thousands of years before it comes out
[1:21:29] but it's planted and all it takes is the
[1:21:31] spirit to what bring it to life and then
[1:21:34] it comes out and it does it amen but
[1:21:36] when God thinks it and God speaks it
[1:21:38] everything that that seed needs is in
[1:21:41] itself all it needs is the right
[1:21:43] conditions you don't have to add
[1:21:45] anything if you want Tomatoes you go
[1:21:47] plant a tomato seed and everything to be
[1:21:50] a tomato plant is in that Tomato Seed
[1:21:52] even though it's just this little tiny
[1:21:53] thing why the word embeds it within
[1:21:56] itself and all it needs now is the right
[1:21:58] conditions the right atmosphere the
[1:22:00] right circumstances for it to come to
[1:22:02] life and we look at the end of creation
[1:22:04] and and we're not reading it this
[1:22:05] morning for the sake of time but at the
[1:22:07] end of this creative work God spoke and
[1:22:10] it happened God spoke and it happened
[1:22:12] and at the end of it it says that God
[1:22:14] saw that it was very good and he rested
[1:22:17] there's nothing bad in there everything
[1:22:19] that he had done was good amen he had
[1:22:21] spoken and when he had spoken he knew
[1:22:23] that it was going to come to pass and
[1:22:25] when it was finished he rested from all
[1:22:27] of those things because what the word
[1:22:29] had been spoken and he knew everything
[1:22:31] that was going to happen was going to
[1:22:33] happen but watch how God's word works
[1:22:36] very familiar scripture in Isaiah 55 he
[1:22:39] says behold Thou shalt call a nation
[1:22:41] that thou knowest not and Nations that
[1:22:44] knew not thee shall run into thee
[1:22:46] because of the Lord thy God and for the
[1:22:49] Holy One of Israel for he ha glorified
[1:22:51] thee this is a prophecy concerning you
[1:22:53] and I
[1:22:55] this is a prophecy of a gentile bride he
[1:22:57] says Thou shalt call a nation that
[1:22:58] knowest the not listen the Jews knew him
[1:23:01] it was the Gentiles that didn't know him
[1:23:03] he says and they'll run to him why
[1:23:06] because of
[1:23:07] him I'm not running to God because of me
[1:23:10] I'm running there because of something
[1:23:12] he did because of who he is amen it
[1:23:16] happens because of God not because of
[1:23:18] you and I but watch now he drops down to
[1:23:20] verse 8 and says for my thoughts are not
[1:23:22] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[1:23:24] ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens
[1:23:26] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:23:29] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:23:31] than your thoughts remember the
[1:23:32] scripture says God is not a man that he
[1:23:34] should lie do you know we lie all the
[1:23:38] time not out of
[1:23:40] intention but we say something and then
[1:23:43] it turns out to not be true because we
[1:23:45] didn't have all the facts we didn't have
[1:23:47] all the understanding the situation
[1:23:49] changed the circumstances have changed
[1:23:51] new new light has come and we'll say oh
[1:23:54] my my goodness I guess I can't do that
[1:23:56] we lied not out of
[1:23:58] intention we lied because we made a plan
[1:24:01] that we didn't carry
[1:24:02] through it's not something that we're
[1:24:04] doing that's bad in and of itself it's
[1:24:06] not a sin to do those things amen but
[1:24:09] but he says that he's not the same as we
[1:24:12] are and he says I am the Lord I change
[1:24:15] not and in that same scripture he says
[1:24:18] and that's why you're not
[1:24:20] consumed the reason that we are not
[1:24:22] consumed with all of our fault and
[1:24:24] failures and bad thoughts and and where
[1:24:27] we fall away and we fall short the
[1:24:29] reason we're not consumed is because of
[1:24:31] Isaiah
[1:24:32] 555 that he said I'm going to have a
[1:24:35] bride and she's going to come from a
[1:24:36] gentile nation and she's not going to
[1:24:38] know me but she's going to come to me
[1:24:40] because of the what I've done and
[1:24:41] because of what I said not because of
[1:24:43] what her what she's
[1:24:45] done so when we fall the reason we
[1:24:48] cannot be pushed away and consumed by
[1:24:50] him is because he has a word that
[1:24:52] overshadows us that says they've got to
[1:24:54] be there no matter what that's why amen
[1:24:57] we can say things and we can think
[1:24:59] things with the best of intentions amen
[1:25:01] I say here today I'm going out to hunt
[1:25:03] Moose guess what I could have a wreck
[1:25:06] halfway down and guess what I
[1:25:09] lied cuz I never make it to Hunty
[1:25:12] moose but I didn't lie with intent I
[1:25:15] lied with what an incomplete picture of
[1:25:17] what was going to happen amen we can put
[1:25:20] things in motion and then one little
[1:25:22] thing we can set the big the big biggest
[1:25:24] greatest plan and we can look at it from
[1:25:27] every angle and get all sorts of input
[1:25:29] and one little thing can derail it and
[1:25:31] we lied because we couldn't see the
[1:25:34] whole picture amen and in our sincerity
[1:25:36] with our best knowledge and
[1:25:38] understanding we say something or we
[1:25:39] plan something or we do something and
[1:25:41] then all of a sudden one thing happens
[1:25:43] and we
[1:25:44] stop God's saying I'm not like
[1:25:47] you I know the end from the beginning I
[1:25:51] know the start to the Finish amen I have
[1:25:53] all the information I need at the front
[1:25:56] and when I think it it's perfect and
[1:25:58] when I speak it it is absolute he
[1:26:01] doesn't change his mind he doesn't go
[1:26:02] back God is not caught out by
[1:26:05] surprise this what's happening today in
[1:26:07] this world around us is not taking God
[1:26:09] by surprise God's not having to react
[1:26:12] he's already seen it he's already
[1:26:14] accounted for it and he's using it to
[1:26:16] produce exactly what he said he would
[1:26:17] with a perfect spotless sinless Gentile
[1:26:20] bride amen sometimes we say things to
[1:26:22] try and pump up our tires
[1:26:25] sometimes we act real spiritual why
[1:26:26] because we're on a spiritual mountain
[1:26:29] and then what happens is we slide down
[1:26:31] into a valley of the shadow of death we
[1:26:33] slide down into another trial and all of
[1:26:34] a sudden we're like oh maybe I wasn't as
[1:26:37] great as I thought I was maybe I didn't
[1:26:39] know as much as I thought I
[1:26:41] knew what is it we're fooling ourselves
[1:26:44] cuz we're human and guess what I hate to
[1:26:46] tell you guys we're foolish we are
[1:26:49] foolish we are foolish foolish foolish
[1:26:51] we think so much of ourselves and in the
[1:26:53] grand scheme of things we know nothing
[1:26:56] we know nothing absolutely nothing amen
[1:26:59] but God isn't Like Us Praise the Lord
[1:27:02] God doesn't do
[1:27:04] chitchat God doesn't come down you ever
[1:27:06] notice when God comes down and talks to
[1:27:08] people he doesn't mess
[1:27:10] around he doesn't come down and say hey
[1:27:12] how you doing have you noticed the
[1:27:14] weather outside hey did you see that new
[1:27:17] car that haunted us coming no God comes
[1:27:20] down and all he does is he speaks
[1:27:22] exactly what he's thinking and it's
[1:27:24] absolute and it's perfect every time why
[1:27:26] cuz his words have power behind them you
[1:27:29] can't chitchat when you have the word
[1:27:32] because it's absolute it comes with
[1:27:33] power it comes with authority there's
[1:27:35] something that's behind it and it's the
[1:27:37] power of God that brings it to pass so
[1:27:39] you can't chitchat about just anything
[1:27:41] you can't have casual conversation
[1:27:43] because whatever you say casually is
[1:27:44] going to happen you know we've got to
[1:27:46] watch our
[1:27:47] words sometimes we can say something
[1:27:50] casually that brings something to pass
[1:27:52] because we let our tongue slip we ought
[1:27:54] not to do those things brother Braham
[1:27:56] says this he says God never speaks a
[1:27:58] word unless he's got a reason for
[1:27:59] speaking that word he's not like you and
[1:28:01] I that we are especially
[1:28:04] myself that's the humility of a real
[1:28:07] prophet he says like you and especially
[1:28:10] me he says that speak so many foolish
[1:28:13] things God speaks every word with a
[1:28:16] meaning and something that he's trying
[1:28:18] to achieve and will achieve by his word
[1:28:20] and it will perform exactly what he said
[1:28:23] it will do
[1:28:25] do Watch What Happens now we're still in
[1:28:28] Isaiah 55 the intention of God's word
[1:28:30] being proven watch how God says things
[1:28:32] with purpose he says for as the rain
[1:28:35] cometh down and snow from heaven and
[1:28:38] returneth not thither but WTH the Earth
[1:28:40] and maketh it bring forth and Bud that
[1:28:42] it may give seed to the S and bread to
[1:28:45] the eater God's pointing at the systems
[1:28:47] of the Earth he's pointing to the the
[1:28:48] rain systems the watering systems and
[1:28:51] they're all there to produce and sustain
[1:28:53] life amen there for our sake notice he
[1:28:57] says I'm giving it so it will give seed
[1:28:59] to the swer who's the swer you and I and
[1:29:02] bread to the eater who's the eater you
[1:29:04] and I everything in this earth is for
[1:29:06] our comfort and for our benefit to to
[1:29:09] sustain our life amen God created the
[1:29:12] world and set it in order for your sake
[1:29:14] and for my sake for our
[1:29:16] purposes but watch what he says in the
[1:29:18] Amplified so he says just as there's
[1:29:20] systems in this world that work to
[1:29:23] sustain life he he says so will my word
[1:29:25] be which goes out of my mouth and it
[1:29:27] will not return to me without result
[1:29:30] without accomplishing what I desire and
[1:29:33] without succeeding in the matter for
[1:29:35] which I sent it so God's saying as as
[1:29:37] the Earth has a system for producing
[1:29:39] boty life and sustaining it so is my
[1:29:42] word A system that produces and sustains
[1:29:45] eternal life amen it comes with purpose
[1:29:48] and its purpose is to bring to life the
[1:29:51] word seed that he planted in the
[1:29:53] beginning that's the purpose of it amen
[1:29:55] and it's a system of the word that'll
[1:29:57] keep going and keep going and keep going
[1:30:00] until life comes out of every seed amen
[1:30:02] everything that's going on in the great
[1:30:04] plan of God is to bring you and I into
[1:30:06] eternal life that's what it's trying to
[1:30:08] do the purpose of the holy spirit in the
[1:30:10] in our midst and in our lives is to
[1:30:12] bring us all into the realities of
[1:30:14] eternal life amen we can sit here today
[1:30:18] and we can worry and we can fret and we
[1:30:20] can stress and we can Wonder and we can
[1:30:22] struggle and we can fight and listen we
[1:30:24] know it's a fight life is a fight on
[1:30:25] this Earth because we're in sin amen and
[1:30:28] don't so don't give up I'm not telling
[1:30:30] you to stop fighting amen but what I
[1:30:32] want you to see is the rest behind this
[1:30:35] battle amen that we are struggling for
[1:30:37] life but the point the point of the
[1:30:39] struggle is to produce character not to
[1:30:42] make us worry not to make us fear not to
[1:30:44] make us Wonder not to make us fret but
[1:30:47] rather it's to show us that in that
[1:30:48] there is a word that's going on behind
[1:30:51] us and that is our rest that he says
[1:30:53] I'll take you through
[1:30:56] it if God can rest after a 7-Day
[1:31:00] Creation with 6,000 more years to go we
[1:31:04] ought to be able to rest for tomorrow
[1:31:07] amen why because he's got a word that
[1:31:10] takes us
[1:31:12] through bam says all this great thing
[1:31:15] that he knew would come to pass after he
[1:31:17] had spoken it he could take a rest
[1:31:20] everything under control his seed was
[1:31:23] his his word and his word is a seed
[1:31:26] Jesus said it was and everything would
[1:31:27] be all right because he had said for it
[1:31:29] to bring forth of its kind transforming
[1:31:31] only to its kind he says see his word
[1:31:35] had to be of its kind if he had said a
[1:31:38] palm tree he didn't mean a palm and an
[1:31:40] oak mixed together he meant a palm tree
[1:31:42] here and an oak tree there everything
[1:31:44] positionally in its
[1:31:47] place what's position mean be what you
[1:31:50] are he says oh if we could only learn
[1:31:53] that what part of the word we are we
[1:31:56] must take our place no matter what it is
[1:31:59] we can look at that line where he says
[1:32:01] we must take our place and we can put
[1:32:03] pressure on ourselves and we can say
[1:32:05] come on pull your boots up by your
[1:32:06] bootstraps let's get going let's get
[1:32:08] serious I'm not saying don't do that but
[1:32:10] I don't believe that's the pressure that
[1:32:12] brother Brandon was trying to put on us
[1:32:14] amen does a tree get stressed out trying
[1:32:16] to produce
[1:32:18] fruit does a palm tree stress out about
[1:32:21] being a palm tree I got to keep working
[1:32:23] to be a palm tree no what does a tree do
[1:32:28] it takes its god-given
[1:32:30] environment and it uses it to bring life
[1:32:34] that's it amen why because a tree is
[1:32:37] under a law that says you are what you
[1:32:40] are a tree doesn't have to worry am I
[1:32:42] going to switch tomorrow am I going to
[1:32:44] be a palm tree today and tomorrow be an
[1:32:46] oak tree and all of my hard work of
[1:32:48] being a palm tree lost no it always is a
[1:32:50] palm tree it always will be a palm tree
[1:32:52] and so all it has to do is do what every
[1:32:54] other tree does take in the water take
[1:32:56] in the nutrients and it'll be a palm
[1:32:58] tree it's under a law amen I believe
[1:33:01] what brother Bram saying here is that as
[1:33:03] this tree is under a law you are under a
[1:33:06] law that says you are a child of God and
[1:33:08] you can't be anything less than a child
[1:33:11] of God and when you are acting as a
[1:33:13] child of God when you are producing as a
[1:33:15] child of God when you are feeding as a
[1:33:16] child of God you are at your happiest
[1:33:18] and listen you can pretend you're not a
[1:33:20] child of God for a long time but you'll
[1:33:22] never be satisfied until you are what
[1:33:24] you are amen why because there's a word
[1:33:28] that declares your position your place
[1:33:31] your relationship to God and so that
[1:33:34] word cannot return to him without void
[1:33:36] so therefore we must take our place not
[1:33:39] by pressure but because there's a law of
[1:33:41] the word that says you are what you are
[1:33:45] amen that means that my flesh comes into
[1:33:48] subjection it means my mind comes into
[1:33:51] subjection it means my nature comes into
[1:33:53] sub rejection because there's a word law
[1:33:55] that's working behind all of this amen
[1:33:58] it's not by
[1:33:59] might not by power but it's by the
[1:34:02] spirit anointing the word of my life
[1:34:04] that this is going to happen amen it's
[1:34:06] the word of God producing what it says
[1:34:08] about you ream continues he says now he
[1:34:11] had all this in his mind and he said let
[1:34:13] there be now that's Genesis 1 see Let
[1:34:15] There be this let there be that let
[1:34:17] there be he was sowing seed Let It Be
[1:34:20] Here let it be here let it be here and
[1:34:23] he knew it was is going to be that way
[1:34:25] because it cannot change he says now
[1:34:27] that gives us Faith then what he said
[1:34:31] here notice that's Capital H what he
[1:34:33] said here it's going to be so let's let
[1:34:37] that seed fall into our hearts that we
[1:34:39] might be the betting ground of that into
[1:34:41] our hearts and let us act out this place
[1:34:44] that he has placed Us in in the last
[1:34:46] days see let the seed fall in our hearts
[1:34:48] Lord and let Thy word fall in my heart
[1:34:51] let there not be any unbelief
[1:34:55] so what's our part our part is to do as
[1:34:58] a tree does feed
[1:35:01] appropriately listen feed on what the
[1:35:04] spirit has placed around you because God
[1:35:07] gives us an environment to produce life
[1:35:09] God gives us an atmosphere to produce
[1:35:11] life God gives us nutrients to produce
[1:35:13] life God gives us water to produce life
[1:35:15] so what does he do he brings his word
[1:35:17] the atmosphere of God brings the word of
[1:35:20] God we drink it in why because that's
[1:35:22] what believers do
[1:35:24] Believers eat the word of God remember
[1:35:26] Rel Revelation 108 John has to go and
[1:35:29] take the book and eat it that's what
[1:35:31] believers do we eat the book we take it
[1:35:34] in and it has an effect on us it has a
[1:35:36] tremendous work in our life because
[1:35:38] that's what feeds our souls it's the
[1:35:42] word of God
[1:35:43] Amen we can't help it go try and tell a
[1:35:47] tree stop drinking water and stop taking
[1:35:49] nutrients out of the out of the earth it
[1:35:51] won't do it cuz it's built to do it
[1:35:54] every system in place is built to feed
[1:35:57] on that so let me tell you this morning
[1:35:59] if you're feeding on something else and
[1:36:01] wondering why you're struggling it's
[1:36:02] because you're not feeding the way you
[1:36:04] were built to
[1:36:05] feed every time I slip and fall I can
[1:36:10] take it back to something I fed on that
[1:36:11] I shouldn't have fed on that's it that's
[1:36:14] it that's the only way you can come in
[1:36:16] is if you allow it
[1:36:17] in so if we're feeding inappropriately
[1:36:21] guess what we stunt our growth and we
[1:36:23] get Dr and we get into a what a drought
[1:36:27] condition and under a drought condition
[1:36:29] we get dry we get
[1:36:32] brittle we get
[1:36:33] hard we don't produce leaves and we
[1:36:36] definitely don't produce
[1:36:37] fruit but if we'll feed on what the
[1:36:40] atmosphere has produced around
[1:36:43] us we'll produce exactly what we're
[1:36:45] supposed to amen
[1:37:00] but I want you to see something here
[1:37:03] because we started in the beginning and
[1:37:05] when we read the story in Genesis 1 we
[1:37:07] only see a portion of the story but
[1:37:10] remember God rested his word had been
[1:37:12] spoken but not everything that he said
[1:37:14] was written in Genesis 1 that's why we
[1:37:17] have the other 65 books of the Bible is
[1:37:19] to open to us all the other things that
[1:37:22] he said and that he thought
[1:37:24] amen God literally spoke this word
[1:37:28] before the foundation of the world and
[1:37:31] so that word was there before you came
[1:37:33] into existence before I came into
[1:37:35] existence before we ever breathed the
[1:37:37] breath of life amen before we ever gave
[1:37:39] our hearts to the Lord before we ever
[1:37:41] heard the word before we ever had health
[1:37:43] before we ever had sickness before we
[1:37:44] ever did good before we ever did bad
[1:37:46] that word was already in action to bring
[1:37:49] us to eternal life amen it was already
[1:37:52] there it was already working amen the
[1:37:54] reason you and I are here today is
[1:37:55] because the word of God has been spoken
[1:37:57] and we're included in it that's the
[1:37:59] reason we're here today but look at what
[1:38:01] he talks about in Revelation 17 we're
[1:38:03] talking about our origin and the
[1:38:05] revealing of our identity he says the
[1:38:07] Beast that thou sawest was and is not
[1:38:09] and shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[1:38:11] pit and go into predition and they that
[1:38:13] dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose
[1:38:15] names were not written in the Book of
[1:38:17] Life from the foundation of the world
[1:38:19] when they behold the Beast that was and
[1:38:22] is not and yet is now that scripture is
[1:38:24] pointing to the unbelievers in the
[1:38:26] tribulation who will be fooled by the
[1:38:28] Antichrist system amen it's already here
[1:38:31] it's not in power yet not in full power
[1:38:33] yet but yet it's already here and they
[1:38:35] are fooled not because they aren't smart
[1:38:37] enough not because they aren't spiritual
[1:38:40] not because they aren't religious amen
[1:38:42] but far from it they are fooled because
[1:38:44] their names are not written in the
[1:38:46] Lamb's Book of Life That's the
[1:38:48] separation between us and them is that
[1:38:51] their names were not written there ours
[1:38:53] were amen so if you read that correctly
[1:38:55] you'll understand that if their names
[1:38:57] were not written and that's what kept
[1:38:59] them from going into a resurrection or
[1:39:01] Rapture there must have been a people
[1:39:03] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[1:39:04] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:39:07] the world that they would not be fooled
[1:39:09] that they would receive the word and
[1:39:10] that they would go in a resurrection and
[1:39:12] a Rapture that's the word that's working
[1:39:15] over you and I amen there are names
[1:39:17] written that are being called out as we
[1:39:19] come into existence and it's the word
[1:39:21] now that starts to bring us back into
[1:39:23] Christ amen there are people whose names
[1:39:27] have always been on that book of life
[1:39:29] and they cannot be removed and they're
[1:39:31] written in that special chapter called
[1:39:32] the Lamb's Book of Life and those names
[1:39:35] can never be erased they can never be
[1:39:37] marked out they can never be blacked out
[1:39:39] nothing can take them out of the palms
[1:39:41] of his hand Jesus said now there are
[1:39:43] people who can and there are names that
[1:39:46] were never written in there in the first
[1:39:47] place the scripture says and that's a
[1:39:49] different study for a different time
[1:39:51] amen but before they're born the ones
[1:39:53] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[1:39:54] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:39:56] the world before they were born they're
[1:39:58] already declared to be children of God
[1:40:01] and there's a word that's working to
[1:40:02] produce them and we see that amen we see
[1:40:05] it with Jacob and Esau where God said
[1:40:07] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:40:10] the scripture says having done neither
[1:40:11] right nor wrong but that the election of
[1:40:14] God might
[1:40:15] stand Jacob had done nothing wrong
[1:40:19] nothing right and Esau had done nothing
[1:40:20] wrong and before they're born God says I
[1:40:22] hate Esau and I love Jacob why because
[1:40:24] Jacob's name was in the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:26] Life and Esau's wasn't that simple that
[1:40:30] simple amen so before they made a choice
[1:40:33] for against the word before Esau gave up
[1:40:35] his inheritance before he went against
[1:40:37] the the teachings of of what God had
[1:40:39] given his father and his grandfather and
[1:40:41] his great-grandfather before anybody
[1:40:43] gets baptized before they do any of
[1:40:45] these things there's a different law
[1:40:46] that's working and it's the law of
[1:40:49] eternal life that's the overarching law
[1:40:52] above all of these things amen it's the
[1:40:53] word that's been given over the children
[1:40:56] of God Amen but Paul would tell us that
[1:40:57] we're under a law now and that's what's
[1:40:59] working in Us by the Holy Spirit to make
[1:41:01] us into the full reality of a child of
[1:41:03] God he says in Romans 82 he says for the
[1:41:06] law of the spirit of life we're going to
[1:41:07] preach on this next Sunday Lord willing
[1:41:09] but I want to touch on it this morning
[1:41:10] says for the law of the spirit of life
[1:41:13] in Christ Jesus ha made me free from the
[1:41:16] law of sin and death not my works not my
[1:41:19] desires Not My Religion not my beliefs
[1:41:21] rather there's a law of the Holy spirit
[1:41:24] amen that is what's doing the work to
[1:41:26] change you and I this morning there's a
[1:41:28] law that's happening amen it's trying to
[1:41:31] set us free from what our
[1:41:33] circumstances right the world is dark
[1:41:37] it's in chaos it's without form it's
[1:41:40] void there's nothing in order but
[1:41:43] there's a law of the spirit of life
[1:41:45] that's there to set us free from
[1:41:46] circumstances you know what I call them
[1:41:48] circumstances because circumstances can
[1:41:50] be changed you know what can't be
[1:41:52] changed
[1:41:54] seeds you put a seed in one circumstance
[1:41:57] and it won't produce life but if you
[1:41:58] change the circumstances the seed will
[1:42:00] produce what's inside of it and that's
[1:42:02] what the law of the spirit of life is
[1:42:04] here to do it's to take us out of the
[1:42:06] circumstances that prevent life and take
[1:42:08] us into circumstances that produce
[1:42:10] eternal life amen that's the law of the
[1:42:13] spirit of life it's the law of those
[1:42:15] that are written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:42:17] Life and it's a law that's working
[1:42:19] constantly you know what laws don't
[1:42:20] change laws don't bow to circum
[1:42:23] cumstances the law is the law is the law
[1:42:26] now somebody can tell you I'm going to
[1:42:28] give you a break but the law didn't
[1:42:29] change the person just elected not to
[1:42:31] use the law
[1:42:34] amen so we're under a
[1:42:37] law that in all this chaos in this gross
[1:42:40] darkness in these sinful bodies in our
[1:42:43] failed flesh and all of these different
[1:42:45] things amen there is a seed inside us
[1:42:47] that's unchanging and there's a law of
[1:42:49] the spirit of life that's producing an
[1:42:51] atmosphere by the word to bring us to
[1:42:54] full life
[1:42:55] amen I can't stop
[1:42:58] it why because it's a law I can't say I
[1:43:02] don't want that law it's a law it's
[1:43:03] written it's Written in Blood amen and
[1:43:06] we can't stop it amen I can fight it in
[1:43:08] this flesh meaning My Flesh can resist
[1:43:11] amen even when it causes hurt or
[1:43:13] discomfort or these different things but
[1:43:15] that law is Unstoppable and it doesn't
[1:43:18] recognize circumstances all it
[1:43:19] recognizes is there's power behind it
[1:43:21] because it's a law how does the law work
[1:43:25] how does the law of the spirit of Life
[1:43:26] work it works the same way it did in the
[1:43:28] beginning the spirit of God moves to set
[1:43:31] an atmosphere that brings the anointed
[1:43:33] word that produces eternal life that's
[1:43:36] the law of the spirit of life amen the
[1:43:39] great moving of God is to bring eternal
[1:43:41] life Jesus came and he did great signs
[1:43:43] and wonders we talked about this a
[1:43:44] couple Services ago he did great signs
[1:43:46] and wonders he cast out demons he he
[1:43:50] opened blind eyes he he opened deaf ears
[1:43:52] he walked on water and he calmed storms
[1:43:55] but guess what more storms came he
[1:43:57] raised the dead and people still died
[1:43:59] Lazarus still
[1:44:00] died people still got sick Storm still
[1:44:03] came people still had their boat swamped
[1:44:06] that was all temporary amen but Christ
[1:44:08] didn't come for those things they were
[1:44:09] just proving who he was amen but his
[1:44:12] purpose was to bring eternal life and he
[1:44:14] said in John 10 the thief cometh not but
[1:44:16] for to steal and to kill and to destroy
[1:44:20] I am come that they might have life
[1:44:23] and that they might have it more
[1:44:25] abundantly and then he ties Us in this
[1:44:28] is so beautiful he's talking to the Jews
[1:44:29] but he says and other sheep I have
[1:44:32] Hallelujah that's you and I this morning
[1:44:33] other sheep I have which are not of this
[1:44:35] fold them also I must bring and they
[1:44:38] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[1:44:40] one fold and one Shepherd Jesus was
[1:44:44] pointing all the way forward his
[1:44:45] ministry was not yet to us but he was
[1:44:47] pointing to a time in just a little
[1:44:49] while that the gospel would turn to the
[1:44:51] Gentiles under the prophetic anointing
[1:44:53] of Paul's Ministry what was it God was
[1:44:56] planning to start calling names out of
[1:44:58] the Lamb's Book of Life and he would
[1:45:00] send a word out by the holy spirit that
[1:45:02] would catch and produce the conditions
[1:45:05] for their life amen the Holy Spirit was
[1:45:07] going to go forth to a people that were
[1:45:08] not a nation that hadn't received a
[1:45:11] special bloodline that weren't from a
[1:45:13] particular church or Ministry and it was
[1:45:15] going to show them that they were really
[1:45:16] children of God that's how he did it
[1:45:18] with Abraham and what did they do they'd
[1:45:20] go out and it'd just be one here and one
[1:45:23] there and one here and one there and it
[1:45:26] would be Sovereign and it would be
[1:45:27] Supernatural what was it it was the
[1:45:29] spirit of God moving upon the dark upon
[1:45:33] the the chaos on those things that were
[1:45:34] out of order and out of it producing
[1:45:36] children of God they didn't know they
[1:45:38] were children of God when you look at
[1:45:40] the description of of of Paul as to what
[1:45:42] those people were before they realized
[1:45:44] who they were you talk about
[1:45:46] Darkness you talk about Sin you talk
[1:45:49] about filth you talk about perversion
[1:45:51] some of them were the worst of the the
[1:45:53] worst some of them would have fit real
[1:45:55] well into this world we have right
[1:45:58] now but what
[1:46:00] happened an atmosphere came and a word
[1:46:04] came forth and all of a sudden they
[1:46:06] realized I'm a Child of God
[1:46:10] Amen he says but it shall be one day
[1:46:13] which shall be known to the Lord not day
[1:46:15] nor night but it shall come to pass that
[1:46:19] at evening time it shall be light we're
[1:46:21] called evening Light Fellowship ship
[1:46:23] here why this is our
[1:46:25] scripture brother brah says this he says
[1:46:27] now in the beginning Genesis 1:3 we find
[1:46:31] that there was Darkness upon the earth
[1:46:33] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:46:34] water and said let there be light and
[1:46:37] there was light and God saw that the
[1:46:39] light was good and God separated the
[1:46:41] light from the darkness he said so does
[1:46:43] the word of God begin to separate the
[1:46:45] light from the darkness from the
[1:46:47] beginning so does it remain until this
[1:46:52] day amen God bless you just stand if you
[1:46:54] would I had so much to bring this
[1:46:58] morning and I just said I'm not going to
[1:47:00] preach for 2
[1:47:01] hours because that's what it take it'
[1:47:03] take another hour to go through so I
[1:47:04] said we'll save it for Sunday I won't
[1:47:06] Tire the people anden I'm not stopping
[1:47:08] because I'm going hunting I'm stopping
[1:47:10] because it would genuinely take us an
[1:47:11] hour to to do the next bit maybe an hour
[1:47:13] and 15 minutes so I thought it was a
[1:47:15] good stopping point this morning amen
[1:47:17] but what am I talking about God's
[1:47:19] sending what an atmosphere and he's
[1:47:22] already sent it it's already here and he
[1:47:24] sends a word he sends a message to what
[1:47:27] to bring seeds to life to bring seeds to
[1:47:30] life and you'll notice in the original
[1:47:32] creation everything was
[1:47:34] good everything the spirit of God's
[1:47:36] trying to bring to life is good it's the
[1:47:39] children of God Amen it's the
[1:47:41] predestinated it's the elect bride amen
[1:47:43] so I'm so glad we can say we've received
[1:47:45] a message because that message is how he
[1:47:48] produces that life amen it's quickening
[1:47:50] of the spirit to bring us into what the
[1:47:53] conditions the circumstances that will
[1:47:55] allow us to see who and what we really
[1:47:57] are amen we'll pick it up next Sunday by
