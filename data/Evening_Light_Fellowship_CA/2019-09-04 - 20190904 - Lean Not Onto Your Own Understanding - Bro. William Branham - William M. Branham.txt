Lord the god bless yes and we thank God for the gathering tonight where two or three are gathered there am I in the midst so if we got a little more than two or three surely here and I trust that he came with you a man trusted he came with me and it's not is not going to church to see the Lord or to meet the Lord it is to go to church so the Lord is gonna be there with you a man by the grace of God amen so we thank the Lord for His grace toward us and His blessings to us and over this past weekend with our brother George Smith and it's our brothers third trip to Newfoundland so and we trust by the grace of God that he'll be back again maybe to finish his series on the book of Acts and well I didn't want me to preach after he finished on Sunday so I won't get into it we'll see if our brother maybe will agree some time to come back maybe next year sometime and and to finish it if he did sixteen chapters in three services maybe you're doing doing the rest of the book of Acts a man that they in another three services so we'll be in prayer and leave it with the Lord amen and as I said we thank the Lord for that blessing for the Lord to send our birth sister from Tucson here that was in brother been meetings met brother Branham a man experienced the the gift one of the signs that the Lord gave him in his and a man and and also the discernment of the thoughts and intents of her heart a man who it's amazing when we thank the Lord that for her visit and for her testimony and also for our brother George coming and that was brother randoms son-in-law a man so he omit the Prophet personally and he dealt with the Prophet in a very personal way he had to of course being interested in brother Madam's daughter Rebecca and I remember the testimony that they gave one time that that our brother George went to brother branham's home he used the curve that somebody had given brother branham and I understand there brother BAM usually he would not drive that car around Jeffersonville why because it was a cat I was the Cadillac it was a Cadillac and and he said he felt no no I can't drive that around here he did use that a couple of times I'm highway driving from the from Jeffersonville majorly to another city somewhere but not in not in Jeffersonville because he felt it wasn't right for him to be driving such an expensive car that was expensive even back there but he let brother George use it one day when he and sister Rebekah drove around Jeffersonville a man and I and I heard the the tape or the the testimony that they were surprised when they came back to brother Graham's home in Jeffersonville man when they stopped the car they looked behind them there was another car behind them and oh they stopped for a moment there and looked at it and they and it was brother Branham he apparently he had followed them where they went around Jeffersonville and they didn't they didn't realize that until they stopped in front of the house and the person each a man and brother round came up and stopped behind them he was in his regular vehicle a man so the Lord the Prophet allowed our brother George to drive that Cadillac a man so he had to deal with the prophet of God in a very personal way for sure so we thank the Lord for sending our brother George to be with us and administer to us and now he didn't preach but he was teaching and basically that would be the calling then our brother as would be to teach and that's one of the fivefold ministry is teaching a man a teacher but is also a pastor is also the Evangelist and the apostle's and so on so we thank God for our brothers ministry to us and and it was a blessing I've got to say it was a real blessing and we were really encouraged with it and and we were lifted up with the revelation that our brother was bringing to concerning the book of Acts that's good thank the Lord so I trust that we will not forget what we heard will not forget what the Lord was teaching us not not just brother George but it was the Lord I believe it was God anointing the brother to give us the revelation concerning the book of Acts and it's good to know this that the book of Acts is still going on amen that what God started on the day of Pentecost is going right on now from the Alpha ministry to the Omega ministry praise the name of the Lord for a man is again and then I thought about this revelation I said yeah in the back there I said it went from the Jews to the Gentiles but now in the conclusion of the book of Acts it's going to go from the Gentiles back to the Jews a man that's exactly what that's going on right now we know that God's getting Israel ready a man to receive those two messengers in revelation 11 chapter 11 that speaks of the two messengers that God is going to send to Israel and it's either Moses and Elijah or it will be two men with their spirit with their anointing that that kind of a ministry like Moses said and I like Elijah had and so those Israel is really really honestly brother they're getting ready they're those that are spiritual they're getting ready to receive those messengers and they're going to call out the hundred and forty-four thousand a man out of Israel so if only 144,000 out of Israel you know and it's going to be less when it comes to the Gentiles a man 144,000 Jews that are going to be there but but again it's gonna be more Jews than that when it comes to being saved but they're they're there for a special purpose by the grace of God we don't have time to get into those things tonight but we thank God for the revelation of the book of Acts amen they're beginning of it and in the beginning of it you know and going by like Betty brought up concerning the ministry and and the disciples and the apostle's and our brother Paul you know Amen that God chose Paul as his servant praise the name of the Lord just think he killed Christians oh yeah he did and he persecuted the church but he was God's chosen vessel a man seen that that shows you got to keep your attitude right and keep your spirit right a man because just think there was some that never had a right attitude or a right spirit toward Paul and they hated him because because he persecuted the Christians but I guess it was a shock to many of them when they realized that he was God's chosen messenger for that first age a man for the Ephesian age but see that God's ways are not our ways and that God said that he said your thoughts are not my thoughts might your what my ways are not your ways for as high as the heavens are above the earth he says so are my ways and my thoughts above yours a man and they are and brother that proves them when we consider who God chose in the first church age a man and like I said he went from the Jews to the Gentiles and now it's going from the Gentiles back to the Jews a man it is absolutely the truth and the doors closing on the Gentiles but God is opening the door to the juice and brother we know that there's going to be a many many Gentiles during the Great Tribulation that are going to lay down their lives for the gospel many a number that no man could number but they're not bright the bride is not going to go through the Great Tribulation no know where God is going to test us and try us but brother we're going in a resurrection and the rapture by the grace of God so I trust we're looking for it pleased that we're not going to say Lord don't don't don't send the resurrection until maybe in another month don't send the resurrection to another year Lord because I got to do this and I want to do this and I want to do that know no matter what what's going on in your life you want the resurrection any moment a man in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Lord let the rest direction rapture take place we want to go home where do you work where would you rather be right now I don't care what what what kind of life you got and so some it might be all I'm enjoying this life well if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not enjoying this life amen oh no no no you're taking your stand for the truth and he's got to give you the revelation of the rapture and you want to get out of here amen you got the revelation of eternity you want to get out of here by the grace of God you want to get out of time and go to eternity brother when we consider what's going on in this world what what reason would you want to stay oh I want to stay for this reason you leave that but the Lord but you but the prophet of God in this hour and they saying why did God do what he did in this age the probably God said he did it to create in the bride a call for the resurrection and the rapture amen God ever he said he said every time he said before God God's going to do this going to do that he said God since the Holy Ghost ahead and he said what for to create in the heart of the people hunger and a thirst he said for what he's going to do amen they got to be praying for what he's going to do Pentecost was praying for the Pentecostal revival a million they were amen now the bride is praying and calling for the rapture and brother any moment amen by the grace of God Lord is not my time he is yours and Lord that you've done this to create in us a call for the rapture and the resurrection that's why that's why the Provost said God is waiting on us and he said the dead in Christ are wienie on us for the resurrection grace of God be with us Brotherhood as we we will eventually get into the message that I want I said the Lord want me to go back to it again and there's a reason that the Lord want me to go back to the message on I have heard but now I see and we've been preaching on hearing and seen but seed doing it God's Way amen there's a there's man's way but then there's a God's God's Way I trust we're going to hear it God's Way we're going see it God's me by the grace of God a man and I wanted to express some other thoughts in this message right here brother Brown preached this message works his faith Express November the 26th 1965 in the message that we've been ministering on I have heard but now I see he preached it in November the twenty seventh nineteen sixty-five the next day and I believe a muscleman brother Jack Morris Church in Shreveport Louisiana a man and I believe it was brother Jack Morris church because brother Ram is so open with what he's preaching amen so the grace of God I trust it will be with me on Sunday I'll believe this till Sunday and I'll get into it on Sunday because there's there's quotes again in the message I've heard but now I see but there's also quotes and works his faith expressed that I want to share with you amen so the grace of God be with us so tonight the Lord willing tonight are going to hear the prophet of God minister on a message said I was going to quote that of as well well we'll let the Prophet quote and it's called lean not unto your own understanding amen brother when we get into into these two messages here on Sunday brother that's that's gonna be another thought that I want to want to leave with the Saints don't lean to your own understanding a man I trust that you're not leaning on it tonight I trust you're not here tonight because of your understanding you're here tonight because of Holy Ghost understanding in your heart a man and the Prophet brings it out and says you've got to have it in your heart not your head it's got to be spiritual he said not intellectual a man and we're too many so-called believers and Christians they got intellectual revelation but not spiritual they understand a lot in their heads but they haven't got it in their hearts because in order for it to be in your life it's got to be in your heart amen by the grace of God so tonight I want to hear the message lean not unto your own understanding so let's not let's not lean under own understanding with these messages does not lean unto our own understanding concerning the resurrection and the rapture the Lord grace that we're going to understand God's understanding God's Way God's thoughts a man oh well he said his thoughts are i above ours while the Holy Ghost catches up there a man will be caught up by the grace of God into the mind of God so we're going to see it the way that God wants us to see it we're going to hear it the way that God wants us to hear it amen so we're going to hear this message and again it might be just over an hour if we were to hear all the message it would be almost two hours but we'll come we're going to cut out a number of pages here and we'll begin where the Prophet reached the scripture and we'll finish when he finishes with a prayer they man so god bless you let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe only Oh [Music]

believe praise the name of the Lord amen god bless you we're going to go into the the message but just before we do it's brother George referred to this and it is the movie that he referred to saying concerning paul the apostle of christ and i was wondering what the significance was because i received it from believers international of course that's brother George's ministry in Tennessee and I received it when I may be ordered something from believers International and when I got it and received that this was included this dis filmed this video on Paul the Apostle Christ I'll check them and see exactly what it what is like and and see if it's reasonable to to show to the church what we'll see if we see and I check it amen so God's grace again it's a witness to the world brother when it comes to the witness to us it is the opening the seven seals was the witness to the bride a man but God is still witnessing to the world and God is using this one out there and that one out they're not bright the prophet said we're not going to we're not going to get everyone the message to everyone no no the message is only for the bride to give the bride rapturing faith it's calling out the bride giving a rapture faith to go in the rapture but the world is still being witnessed concerning Jesus Christ and what he has done and what he's and what he's doing for the world in general because it'll get get many ready to go into the Great Tribulation and because of the witness they're going to lay down their lives it is the foolish virgin the prophets are they are foolish virgins virgins yes but he's not the wise virgin of the revealed word that's taken sin to the resurrection rapture it is the foolish virgin that'll they'll go into a Great Tribulation but you know it'll strike them and they'll they'll lay down their lives a man and so they'll come forth by the grace of God and they'll be outside the city so again I'll check it and let you know about it to see if we can play it for the church again the message is lean not unto thine own understanding January 1965 and there is an extra copy right here if anybody wanted it Amen god bless yes we've seated and we're going to turn out to the book of Proverbs the first chapter and a second chapter or other and the first few verses of the Proverbs of two beginning with one proverbs two beginning with one the continuation of Solomon advising his son my son if thou will receive I'm sorry I have proverbs 3 1 I'm sorry I looked over here on on book and I see that it is proverbs 3 instead of 1 5 - I'm sorry Bob verbs 3 1 my son forget thought my law but let thine heart keep fire commence or length of days and long life and peace shall be shall be ed to these sets not mercy and truth for safety buying them about thy neck write them upon the tables of thine heart soul shall die find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto their own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths oh I think that's the most beautiful scripture now I want to take for a text out of the v first lean not unto their own understanding now this is a a very strange text for the day that we're living in because the emphasis today is certainly laid upon education upon our own understanding of things the day of learning but we find out here that this strange statement like other scriptures it has its place and we trust that God will let us see where the place is today we send our children to the school to have understanding then HR there through the grammar schools we stand in the high school for a better understanding of knowledge then edger there through there some children are even fortunate enough to go to college and go through college to complete their education and their understanding of knowledge what they are acquired of by many times to get a job you have to have a at least a high school understanding or college education or so forth yep the wise Solomon told us that not to lean to it up to our own understanding learn not of these things because we wonder why that he would say such a thing is this or it's because it usually our modern understanding is usually the wisdom of man which is contrary to the Word of God I think that's what if Solomon was trying to advise his son was not to be illiterate but not to lean to their understanding and I think it would be a good excitation today if we said to our sons and to the sons of God that it's alright to have an education there's nothing against that but when that education is contrary to the Word of God then lean to the word and let your education go thank the cause the word and education will stand and will give you a good job probably a good standing amongst intellectual people but that's alright which will probably be a great help to you help you in your financial and your your livelihood make living maybe a little better for you but remember one thing my son you've got to die no matter how much education you got how much culture you're able to accumulate you've yet got to face death because it is written that man must die and after that the judgment yes and God when death is not so bad but coming to the judgment is the bad boy ha you can die but after that the judgment and God is not going to inquire of you how much schooling you got when you were here on earth how much knowledge you accumulate whether you've got your Bachelor of Art or whatever degree you might have it even as the minister it's not going to be required of you but it's going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of God's Word yes II Men that's where the requirement come because that's your education fine but the Word of God is left my word is life yes and to know it is life and he is that know him he is the word yes so you can only know him by the word for he is third that's the only way you'll know him is by his word somebody could come up say this is God or that's daughter this is Guara this is right and that's right but we come back to the word which is the truth and the word is just like the the North Star it's a true star no matter which way the worlds of floating that North Star is centered with the earth you set your compass to the North Star it's always in the center of the earth other stars float around with the world but the North Star stay stable now compass is the holy spirit and the your your typos would be the North Star so the Holy Spirit will always part towards the words the Holy Spirit will never lead you to anything else but the Word of God so how could a man except decreed what is contrary to the word and then still say he has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost had taught you away from that it takes the Holy Spirit to point you to the word for he is the world he is the word it can only as the as the magnet Indiana compass is only set toward the North Pole that's the only way it can draw and when the Holy Spirit is the author and rider and the quicken ER of the word how can it point the person to anything else but the word so when a person says they have the Holy Ghost and accept something contrary to the word it shows that ain't the genuine Holy Ghost they got think it may be a ghost I wouldn't dispute that but it it is the Holy Ghost a pride now you know many times they take one another spirit and so that might part in a like a group Amman to a certain things but it won't it won't part to Christ but the Holy Spirit always ports to Christ and Christ is the word we see this so plainly in the Bible or I do maybe I be wrong but my thinking but I don't think so because that this lean not to your own understanding of thing if you lead to your own understanding then you're bound to get off of the right Road you can't leave to anyone else's understanding when it comes to life they're fine life you've got to lean to the word man that's life we see this from the beginning it's so plainly made known to us from the beginning at God gave his first family on earth his word to live by only his word was deliver that's not through eating the food and so forth but his word they were to live by eternally and as long as they kept that word they lived eternally well the first little fries of that work was misplaced the whole chain broke and the human race plunged into death he how we noticed Eve which was no doubt an intelligent person the first cut off of Adam who was the son of God and Eve certainly being in that pot or there had been no sin no place for sin he certainly must had a wonderful conception of what God was because ever afternoon she and her husband walk in the cool of the guard levy and talk face to face with God what a an on reasonable thing that a person who would won't face to face with God each day and that would turn to the reasoning of something that reason her away from the Word of God we still gotta tell you told me be reasoned away from the Word of God after setting in the presence of God seeing the Word of God preached the Word of God made manifest drunkards and sinners come to the altar and be converted and made new creatures in Christ people of ill-fame made ladies and gentlemen and then to turn from that blessed thing that led him to this life and then he preferred it off after some kind of a creed you become more popular or get into what they would call a better price to people while you're in the best class that there is tons of daughters of God I don't like that company better not wear with all the kings and Pope takes it everything else give me that whole bunch of people if they don't throw the right hand from the left as long as they know God and loving and serving that's the celebrity of heaven to me yes sir now but we find that Eve was easy persuaded by Satan from the Word of God and she lead on her own understanding because Satan had projected something to her which wasn't there her real understanding of God but she had something else told to her by the enemy Satan as she believed it down we find the results of this it plunged the whole human race to death because the first mother on the earth leaned to her own understandings contrary to the Word of God and plunge the whole human race today how can you believe that that's the word well a woman is always the church in the bible is type to woman and a church today can accept a bunch of dogmas are Creed's and puns the whole congregation in a separation from God those people who stop those things in the state of the Word of God are just like even it's been done over over till it's got this whole generation punched away from the Word of God and when the word is made manifest the word is revealed they won't accept it because they won't do it because they lean to their understanding this church is built here it's a beautiful place it's a great organization it's a member of a great body of people why should we blog that I'll trust in it just not in your own understanding but trust in the word of the Lord now now it ended finally in death to the whole race as I said Fame is now to the many people who rely upon their own understanding their dogmas and creeds and so forth blaming the word God is not altogether truth that some of it is inspired and some is not how can you have faith in a Bible if part of it is inspired and part of it's not if one if one quotation is wrong then the whole thing might be wrong it's all got to be right exactly right and some of these so called perverted Bible schools teaching man's knowledge of cumulation where they get together instead in a council of people and say now look if the days of miracles that ended in the days of the Apostles and many man under the bishop for the harm in which sit there and say well if I can just agree with him no doubt but I might be in line next for his position see then your leave to your own understanding instead of standing on your two feet for the word of God that's what causes these things some time ago someone has in a dispute on an income tax and they said to me said why your trustees are nothing but puppets are supposed I said I by a trustee on the board that had a different idea and wouldn't stand up and I'll turn about it would express his own views of him I throw him off the board yes sir thought was contrary to my belief I wanted to express what he thinks is right that's what I got him therefore see what he says about it but we have it notice Jesus said in Saint John 10 my sheep know my boy a voice of course is his word when he's speaking my sheep know my voice my voice has been proven to them to be true it's been vindicated that it is my voice now now notice they are not subject to follow in any other voice they won't my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow in other words they will not understand a theological voice that's teaching contrary to the word the sheep don't understand that no more than the Eagle less I could understand the clucking of the hymn they don't understand the cause he wasn't eagle and that's the same thing with a genuine born-again child of God they understand only the things that are of God now somebody say when I look you can do this I think it's I believe that it isn't this the way I believe that the days of miracles just fast I don't believe that that's divine healing I don't believe this now a genuine born-again Christian that'll never stop it is you you don't understand it at all and how could a man that believes in God and can read the Bible and see that he's the same yesterday there forever will ever accept such a thing is that I don't understand it don't they do not lean to their own understanding just like a baby you take a little baby and let it be born and let him once lean upon his mother's bosom nurse from hers the warm milk leave his little head a born or bosom doe he's just a few hours old in a day or two from then take him away from his mother and give him over all the breast of a strange mother you kick that little of feet up yeah and yell it's not his mother think he is already had a something of body because he is a part of this mother yet Nature has provided him a way to know his own mama and if nature has provided a way for babies and would smother forwards born from how much more is he a son of God that's born of the Spirit he knows his mama he knows because he was born of the word and he understands the word put him in a strange place he certainly is out of out of place he'll get out of there as quick as he can because he has he doesn't leave somebody saying I wait dear this is your mama now it's not his mama because he has the way of knowing it he's part of this mother that's his mother no one else can ever take her please he knows his own mother notice how is how it is really so God has made everything after its kind the cattle add to their time any time in bringing around up down we bring the whole herd the cattle and the little cash I used to wonder how they would ever know they're all mama now they the coming down out of the mountains the cattle all mixed together a cow that is a with the cat maybe a little hungry cat night nurse a little from the other mother if he's real hungry but when we stop him out on the Prairie that mama starts today brother cows and calves she finds her own and their cap is running hard mother it knows that certain old wine her ball and she's bawling for that cap the other mothers are ball engine you can't even hear yourself ain't but that little calf will find that all of its mother they call just part of the matter Lord and a born-again Christian from heaven he is a part of this world [Applause] another mama he will not follow he's a part of the word he stays with the word if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who can prepare yourself for battle said Paul he knows the sound of the word notice help how this is the predestinated hand of God fallen them through he knows that he was ordained he was in the gospel truth he know that he was born by the Spirit of God he knows that the Spirit of God cannot deny the Word of God so therefore a stranger he will not follow notice how I was looking back your honor note that I had wrote down here a past fine but I just happened to see the scripture reading thought I'd refer back to it again notice how his own predestinated sheep followed him right in the days of the greatest theologians that we ever had they come right out because they knew him they knew what the word had promised for that day they know what the Messiah was to be like when he came and Simon Peter came three which was only Simon there and Andrew had tried to kill him about that this man is the Messiah whilst I'm in of course he was maybe a little hard-headed he wouldn't go but when he walked up into the presence of Jesus or Jesus said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas now we know that Jesus told his apostles that he knew him and he before the foundation of the world they were the attributes of his thoughts therefore being that seed lay in him and he knew that the word said and had been promised that the Messiah would be a prophet and when he seemed that he was true officially he knew then that he had stopped his nets because he's been gobos become a Fisher of man part now there stood others standing there who seen the same thing that acquainted a evil spirit that was the theologians because it wasn't in the taste of their theological teaching and they turned it down because they leaned their own understanding father doctor my Jesus Christ came in the fulfillment of the word of promise and they were to gone to see it they leaned upon what the priests tape and if all of the church said and still upon what God said about Jesus rebuked impart he said search the Scriptures for in them you cleave you have everlasting life and they are they that testify of me these scriptures out of s here to search they tell you who I am yes but they wouldn't lean to what the word said but they lean to what their understanding law they leave to their own understanding and the scripture tells us that they were failed the fail of their own theology has them blind you say brother Branham what are you getting at I'm just getting to this that thing is occurring again so man women and people will lead to a certain church that they have charged that belonged to no matter what the Word of God says about it they go right on with that CD to their own understanding and ignoring the Word of God as if it that's never even been written it's a sermon high speed of human life it's got the physical life but no spiritual life end up to be quickened the big it was over their face now I noticed they had their own thoughts of what God should be they had their own ideas of what the size should be but the word said what the massage should be now see they had their own understanding of what he would be no God for what the high priest said oh my priests under me now when the Messiah comes we've built a great temple year we'd all this is the Bible said he'll quickly come to his temple in all these things what he does the Messiah will come right up here and recognize himself with us and say I am the Messiah I have arrived I am that Messiah that you've been looking for well why did did come he come in such a different way from what they thought it would they didn't recognize it they didn't know who he was but he is oh it what if some hypocrite what a Walter Benson I am the Messiah I'm dr. so-and-so they would have accepted it but when you come to any man that was born with a darkened birth behind him no education of any school he ever went to to learn no seminary did he have no fellowship part but he was the interpretation of faith oh did I tell you who I am I do not the worst that was promised I do then believe me not and could we not apply that to this day when the Holy Ghost comes if they want to part of some other age when he comes into action and the demonstration of his power of eternal life the people or a corner a wild fanaticism wow they are leading to their own understanding and up to the word of the Lord you know that's right the identification that God own interpretation is the manifestation of the promise maybe I'll stick make a little plainer when God speaks the word he doesn't need any man or any form under no one else just say what that means when you say well you say God meant this God means just what he says now how does he interpret his own word by fulfilling him the Bible said a virgin shall conceive she did that don't need any interpretation God said let there be light and there was that don't need any interpretation God said also that in these rice days hit pour out his spirit upon all flesh I don't need any interpretation that only needs an exception somebody to accept what God is done it doesn't need an interpretation God interprets his own word God promised the things that we see day by day that he were doing in the last day people today like it was then they leaned upon their own understanding my pastor says that that's fanaticism but the Bible said it would happen yeah Zeus understand ego to lean upon the Bible promised in the last days that the lady of steer church age would get so rich and get salt in Sofia its sufficiency other own I am rich I have neither nothing I said as the Queen and she's rich and he said thou knowest it not that you are miserable that's the entire church age the church to the Church of radio see you are naked run poor miserable yeah don't know it setting inner riches ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of members whittle for the world air hand almost butter you know all together they for the Catholic Church sort of Protestant together as you're going together they got the well to the world we are busted in this nation just about where's barring on tax that will be paid in forty years from now they tell me so they set a lifeline that's this we're standing out will be paid forty years from now my little grandson if Jesus carries the taxes that he'll pay when he's 40 years old we're spending on it now sending too far day than her own hymns and they starving today trying to buy fellowship you don't find fellowship you don't buy freedom no but that's what we're doing that's way we're set up that's the people to ever think they can get owned a tax tax tax and will not be on a war debt first for hundreds of years yet uh suppose as we've been thrown into by politicians and now we shouldn't be that way there's no reason for us to be that way but the churches themselves has become rich or near the well for the world says the Bible blazed in the Catholic Church that's why Russia run her out while Russia excommunicate asked was the very grassroots of communism that calls the church talk to be something it wasn't no more for the rest of the world woman's up there in Finland that little I was raised in the dead that's to them Russian soldiers at attention and they said we will receive a God that can raise up the dead we have made denominations and schools and and buildings and failed to do what Jesus told us do is preach the gospel we tried to educate the world he never said educate the world he that educators should be safe you've got to be born again that's the reason we have so miserably failed everywhere right see we got the well we got the thing now what will happen when this a church World Council of Churches goes together can't you see who's gonna do the levy thank you Methodists and Presbyterians understand that the rest of you even to Pentecostal church right you sit you're not on the end you'll either go ahead or you bust up the denomination you do or the other it's right before you got to do it it's a forcing the mark of the beast that's what it is that that is the nomination ISM absolutely I prove it by the Bible is the mark of the beast there's a she had prostitute daughters and we know that that is the truth organized religion it's contrary to the word and it's Antichrist in its principles not everything in there's Antichrist but in its principle principles its system is Antichrist because it's against the Word of God ever organized system is that way there are senior Lee into somebody else's own under their understanding instead of leading to God to understand what God said about it that's reason it's wrong boys go off to seminaries who has good education off to these Bible schools so clone and maybe they got it got call of God in their heart and they get out there and there is so in documented what one view if so it's those that at bishops or and so this one said it that one says the council man agrees this where it should be don't care what anybody says jesus said let every man's word bli and mind be the truth matter whose it is I be the truth now how do we know what's truth when the Bible that cares if something will happen if something's gonna take place and it happens that way now the Bible said in her bosom oh well for the world gold silver now if we're on the gold standard and where it broke now what's going to happen what's going to happen you know the rich people of this nation these big factories in whiskey man tobacco man and so forth like that is not going to stand to change the currency so the only thing would have to is buy and there's only one place we can bar it and when we do we start birthright opportunity then what are you gonna do your own by their that system there's nothing else you can do old people don't they are you may think I'm crazy but what my boys the solace of death these tapes will still be playing you'll recognize or whatever I'm the bag a bit more silly person to take the stand that I have to even against this stain yeah I would be a big just God I think esteverena five just if I had well what's wrong in my thinking it with my calling the thing would be against God but I've tough I stand because I see it here in the world it's God's Word they not see it being vindicated proven that it's the truth that's the interpretation that God gives off his word God's own interpretation of his word is how he indicates it makes it true why were these Pharisees blind what made them survive because they would not accept revelation or vindication of the work and that's reason to pay that the churches are blind is because they won't accept revelation that's been vindicated if the word sessile is revealed and then it's proven still they won't accept it that's the reason these Jews the Jews - this thing will not you cannot talk to him about Christ because the veil is still over their face blinded this and a church you can't talk to him about the Full Gospel in the power of God because a god of this firm has glide to them from the truth of God and they lean to their own understanding when women come into the church and follow off their hair the coarser pastures tells him all that surah that man's crazy but the Bible said she's done wrong when she doesn't refused to answer a prayer and some of them women make another disgrace to try to be a preacher then she's on the BB her father said she should not do that none of it but the church organization will receive it and are dangerous stand her out they're landing to their own understanding one word of God misplaced or misconstrued or not accepted breaks the whole chain mansion out there by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God why is it women you hear me preach against these things where is shorts and paints and and hairdos of this year bobbed hair and all that kind of stuff and then every year when I come back you're still set to the same condition if the cause you're leading to your own understanding and other the pastor's why don't you clean up your church because you're going to hear denominational credence to the word of the Lord let's lean not to your own understanding well lead not to your own understanding but upon the word of the Lord they were not accepted because they would not accept vindication Jesus come with a a gospel just exactly the way he said he would come even many times John was the longer confused when he was thrown into prison and he uh he got out there and he had preached that there was coming into Messiah Hussein was in his hand his early purchase Lord burned the chaff of that pushpa fire gather the wheat into the garner the Spirit of God bringing forth launching out of him like a like a fountain and then when he seen Jesus come on the scene the little meek lowly started to develop and pushed around around here for his life and over there while they did John couldn't understand it so he sent some of his disciples to find out from Jesus if he really wants to one water disarm to Jesus after that prophet standing on the water with the Word of God said I knew he because I've seen de done a holy spirit like a dove God just sitting for more than like a dove and going into you I heard a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son and then John said who asked him if really he was the one or do we look for another now jesus never sent him a book on how to behave in prison huh what church he should have joined but he said stay around a little while and watch what happens and then go show John the things that you have seen and done because that is works that he did vindicated him to be the Messiah the Son of God blessed is he who is not offended in me so many have become offended so many people get offended so easy at the word of God it's contrary they want to lean to their own understanding they don't want to take the word of the law and they have to go just the way that that says they've been taught to go and they waited it there how their church leans upon it no matter if God promised he'd hidden rain i have rain in the morning in the church said that's nonsense they'd believe the church is to the god they cause what they're born of the church but a man is born of God his other seat of God and the seat of God is the word of God and he only lives by that that's his life now they leaned all to their own understanding but that is what to lean on God's Word they know better it was in the scripture they called it an evil spirit that man calls why their preset anybody that goes to hear this man preach they'll be put out of the synagogue when a man was healed that was fine once by Jesus even his parents so happy about the eating but there was afraid to confess that it was Jesus that did yeah I said he said is this your son said yes sir who made me well sir I don't know said he's the beige you asked him he thought for himself because he'd have been said that any man that leave to hear Christ understanding instead if their understanding would be put out of their church now isn't that just the same I asked you a fine blank question right it's a drew the same thing no matter what God does it has to be according their understanding not what God indicates to be the truth now and that man had the answer all he said who he was he said one called Jesus of Nazareth that he's a sinner we don't offer which he come instead now that's a strange thing here's folks be the leaders of this hour here's a man open my eyes they have the mint don't sense a whirl beginning yep you say you don't know from their own understanding instead of the word of the Lord because Isaiah said the blind would see believe would be heart deserts should break forth and joy but to see they lead to their own understanding not to the word their own system they have brought up now notice the churches of today do the same thing they have a farm of great super race of understanding in their denominational systems that they have such a super understanding they don't want nobody else to fool with it nobody to come in unless they belong to that group don't tell me Eileen in Tucson Arizona I come down there three years ago I met with the Council of Churches not that I never come to start a church I come to fellowship with you I come to help you know I'm a missionary evangelist whatever I'll do this that are you coming your star church I said no sir I come here I want a church I got one in Indiana I said I come here because the Lord led me here a division I'm going to stay for a while now unless he leaves me away but I never come to start a church I've come to help here brother that's been three years ago I've never been invited to one place Wow the goal there was to get together right after that instead of any man had me in their bullpen they would X commute that preacher say walk to their own understanding cert me that's it is so called they formed their super understanding bless you put your name on their book you're saying you're lost I'm Minister told me that all you say that was a some quack it's a Pentecostal that born Arthur listen that even Dallas Texas he said he's gonna have to take a man off the book on sir why cause he fellowship with you answer well take it off he said what he's lost then after lost I said with these names I'll say you mean your district prosper you believe that so that's the truth I said get off the phone mister that is the grace of God that co1 spirit we are all baptized into one body in the coffers of that body I don't care what brands you got on you that don't have nothing to do with it you are absolutely a Christian by birth that's the only way the only way you can be not the journey not the Creed's not exciting history or reciting this or any other thing or about education theology or Christian when you're born again and you cannot be born again less you've been elected to be born again but don't make it come to me except my father draws it in all that the father has given me will come hey I'll raise him up against the last a great so-called Bible schools we have this they lean upon their own alone worthy oh hey no matter what the word says they can so plainly explain it Oh to their own self make your own selves believe it and their own kind believe it that the days the miracles is fast there is no such thing as prophet prophet fossils there is no such thing as gifts of healing and so forth it all ended back in the Bible days they can make themselves believe that you know the Bible said you can believe Allah and be damned by hey that's exactly the truth they all no matter what the Word of God says they lead to their own understanding they they lean on it they believe it they think it's the truth you can keep believing a lie over and over and over to tell us the truth are you fine well how do we know what is truth or not God proves it's truth anymore and he have indicated he does his own interpretation of it how did you get through this they do it by their culture their education other understandings other the degree of doctors degree and so forth that they have come from some certain seminary and learn these things but look France listen throw her in the bag are we as to understand we're not asked to understand it we're asked to believe it believe it by walk by faith if you understand it sense that makes faith no you can't booth understand it but you believe it anyhow if I could understand God I wouldn't have to believe God I do not understand God no man understands God I cannot understand the Word of God except this I believe it I'm not asked to understand I don't been to know seminary all this great understanding of man's knowledge on that honest though that the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday for every I'll look for him in that same category I'd already promised one even doing this they all look for him to do it and he doesn't God he'd promised grace I look for it and I received it he promised healing I believe me and I accepted it and I'll receive it now don't take too much of your time but I want to ask one thing if you bear with me a minute to consider some of those who did not leave on their own understanding some characters of the Bible just for a few that leave hop to their own understanding regards to what the understanding of their age was let's take for instance Noah Noah lived in a day of great scientific research the days of nor they probably built the pyramids but you cannot reproduce again now we have got nothing to do it with nothing to lift the boulders up there they could not today then days they had some kind of a chemical they can die it makes the clothes look natural till the day they had an embalming fluid as they can make a mummy we could not make one today if we had you we loved the arts that we have lost and they lived in a smart scientific age Jesus referred to that that same carbon age would return again before he come back for as it was in the days of Noah now you will believe that won't you you believe it Jesus said do you believe we have returns that age now that isn't a book of Luke the 17th chapter xxix first now in Luke 1730 and as it was in the days of lot when the angel of the Lord now is read the same Bible we are and when you go back and find out what kind of baby it was before Noah I was REME go back and find out what kind of a day it was before the world was destroyed in the days of life find out what it wasn't you see what Jesus is talking about in the days of Nohr they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage do it not until Noah entered into the ark the flood come take them all away in the days the box just before the world was a fire burn the Gentile world the sodomites there were homosexual perversions everything in the world great it was a modern Los Angeles not a modern only Los Angeles but in the United States yes states for the world yeah it sure was perversion man lost her natural source of life and their natural understandings of common sense become for birdie by an evil spirit to change the whole course of their natural life and they were possessed with demons spirits that eats a picture of the days of Noah I don't know what and in the days of lot I mean and days of Noah also eating drinking Mary given in marriage divorce courts filling and everything just like it was but remember before the world was destroyed Abraham was sent on the face of the earth and was given a promise of a son and abraham met god in many stages as a type of the church's met god but just before the destruction and the promised son returned or came rather the son of the promise came god came down and was mammoth human flesh in a mate dreaming and they come down to LA come first to abraham and they sit down and abraham had his name changed from Abram to Abraham Sara - Sara and these man the speaker ello him when he came down to speak to him What did he say he said work is your wife Sara said she's in the tent behind you that I and will visit you according to the time of life is she left in the tent behind him and he said why did sterile and see now he would Chuck's the life of Sarah right there for laughing at his word but he could not do it because Sara was a part of Abraham at today jesus said in Luke the 17th chapter in the 31st as it was in the days of love so shall it be at the end on when the Son of Man now remember Son of Man is a promise he killed a son of man Jesus man son of David son of God he called his death son of man short the beef word understand for he was that prophet that the Lord God would raise up now notice the Danny promise what the settlement would be feel himself again just before that time before the far it's time that Abraham saw before the promised son arrived and he turned back to a young man is she to a young woman before now notice the scripture specifically says that now we must look for that and then if we see the world in perversion and the things that's in it today carry it all the way it is then how can we say that's right and don't say this others Rock because somebody you're leaning on their understanding and not the understanding of the Prince of life who was that person that was there at the gate with them it's Sodom now we noticed we lead not to our own understanding know what did not lead to his understanding it was a great scientific age but he did lead to his understanding of his day but he leaned on the promise of God and moved by the power of God and prepared an ark in the staining of his house when it was absolutely contrary to common sense there was no water up there never had been but he knew if God said there would be there would be so he need not to his own understanding but by faith he moved by the word of God's promise the spirit moved him and he did it Abraham he did not leave to his understanding about human life it married his wife at about 17 years old here he was 75 years old and she was 65 years old 10 years younger but Abraham did not lead to his understanding when God said that he had gave him a son by Sarah but he called anything any scientific proof that was contrary to God's Word any learning outside of God's Word as though it wasn't so and he give God praise strong giving him praise he did not even consider looking at his own body or the deadness of Sarah's body or or his body he did not consider anything but leaned upon the promise of God he leaned that up on his own understanding he leans out of bone reasons why say brother Brahim it's reason that God wouldn't Gila stick we've got so many fine doctors the Bible said we cast down reasoning we don't reason faith don't reason faith believe and accept notice but he believed instead of unbelieving and call the face which were not as though they were which is absolutely it against any reasoning but he didn't reason he just believed him there was no reasons could prove that that baby could be born that woman was about twenty years of past menopause and his body was as good as dead and when he was a hundred years old 25 years there he still was giving God praise against any kind of understanding but by faith II know that God would keep his word he leaned not to his own understanding what if Moses what a lead to his own understanding when God told him and he was done to take Pharaoh and the children of Israel out of Pharaohs hand what a fiddly to his own understanding when he's there by the pillar of fire when God said go down and I'll be with you what if it lead to his understanding when he brought him to the Red Sea and Daddy was at the water and yet God had promised him the promised land what if he'd lean to his own understanding how am I going to get across sir we have a time to build a bridge here's the army coming right behind you here's the mountains on either side here is the water in privacy the Red Sea outfit lead to his own understanding his own of his hands are unveiled at the feet of Pharaoh that Pharaoh forgive me I did wrong but he leaves not to his own understanding but he pray that God taught him to step forward and I see older which music is Oh reasoning but he leaned not to his own understanding what if Joshua when he went over there with the other ten denomination and walked over there and seems that Promised Land of God I'm going to come back but damn it said now wait a minute is true we look like grasshoppers they're Giants how can we ever take them we don't even have swords just what we picked up how're we ever going to take that land was totally impossible to outnumbers fifty man to one they're trained soldiers and we're nothing just a bunch of a sheep herders and mud dobbers out of Egypt hell we don't even have shields thanks how would we ever take it while understanding would sure prove that they could not do it any military man like he was Ramos's could not have lean on their own understanding but their understanding they lean not on but they know that God said I have given you that land go take it lean not to your own understanding if you lean on your own understanding day when you're sick maybe sitting in a wheelchair dying with cancer heart trouble the doctor says here go to bat if you lean to that understanding you'll die yeah but don't leave that understanding Oh turn it on what about if the walls of Jericho bets they say that garage share it race around the top of them then faith big ball god sake for up there and march you're at it so many times and sound a trumpet all of you lash out the walls all day well that was absolutely would be silly to the carnal mind but josh away knowing how thick those walls was cause he had built plenty walls down in Egypt you know what to see Matt there was in him how tight they were the hole that chariot races on top and even houses built on top of it but he didn't lead to his own understanding he believed what God said was the truth and obey his word and the walls fell down leaning on trees don't understand

stood there to give him a PhD in hell LD all that is a portal couldn't even move he didn't oh hi he said I never proved this that ecclesiastical vest don't fit me take the thing off let me go with what god help me with that was faith in the power of God penny he didn't lead to his own understanding he didn't lead to what somebody else said he leads to faith because he knows if God had saved him from the bears paw how much more would he save him from that Philistine well of God loves you well enough to bring you up out of sin and to fill you with the Holy Ghost what's the matter do you force funless weakens around the country who need much more deliver you from your affliction what do you promised he'd do it God's Word said so sure he delivered you out of the handle Oh every one of the prophets what if they were to leave there our understanding in their age they don't ever walked up to that priest and high priest and called him planted walls and everything else they'd never prophesied contrary to that have been like some of them modern prophets would agreed ward by Coles and Biddy King's palaces well John would have tried to lead to his own understanding but he walked out up this hour what is it John don't you preach on marriage and divorce he walked right up to the parents cut Hey yeah well you know who that is that's the proper I don't care who it is he didn't lead some night you know you haven't got but you're down here on this first association won't receive you if you go to act like that you didn't care about any Association he didn't mean to his own understanding but to the understanding of God shirk that was one man who did lead to his own understanding and his name but Judas is cast oh ye I don't see how I could have done it he'd walked face to face with Christ just like he did in the beginning he had seen the vindication he had looked at God in the face like he did in the crew the easier he looked at Christ in the cool of the evening in the garden and Tudor said set in the cool of the evening and the Garden of Gethsemane and many places and it looked at the same Christ and heard him teach prove himself by the word vindicated to be the prophet that Moses a spoke of a be raised up and told him in Scripture who he was know all about it they'd seen approved by God that he was and how to it is because he never had it down here in the first place he was the German passing he was the son of perdition poured out a perdition return back to perdition now we noticed but he went out and maybe he might have had an idea of his understanding he might have thought that Jesus he had so much respect for him now you know I'm I studying for thirty pieces of silver and if I do I'll have some moody not gonna do something with that and he's able to deliver himself see he didn't know in the scripture that he raised up to take that same place and these are there's a people today realize what condition if they're in its ordained for this lady or see a church to be in this condition but in Christ on the outside he's not trying to get back in no cooperation in the world vindicating his word in the day now like he did an errand eight and it walked right away from it leaning to the understanding that's all there is to it or maybe let's say this to them and he thought maybe if he did sell Christ for thirty pieces of silver well and he would have a fellowship with some of the great denominations of that day the Pharisees the Sadducees he's saying I'll wait he can take care of yourself I've seen great battles huh I know that that he can take care of himself so I might make some money kind of a little retirement as it was and then again I might have a great standing with these churches today if I would betray to it see but he leaned to his own understanding instead of the understanding is that was the vindicated Word of God and he did to Jesus just what the scripture said he would do and today the church world has turned Christ out in this last days just exactly like the book of Revelation said they would do it it's the spirit of Judas again and form a church having a form of godliness but denying the word shine now oh ma what did it result in death just like it did to eat it does to all others who tries to pervert the Word of God and leave to their own understanding even now they sell not for thirty pieces of silver but maybe become all some great officer some seminary experience wouldn't need more thirty pieces of silver but they sell it in they'll tell their understanding of God out for such a thing is that God differ from the great learning st. Paul we had all the knowledge he could brag about but he said I've turned the whole thing on my reasons down I'm gonna kill her for one day on the road that's all and he said I'll never come dear with excellency of speech because if I did you trust in the wisdom of man but I come to you in the power demonstrations of the Holy Ghost beam upon the Word of God he said of an angel from heaven come preached any other thing let he be accursed relations 1:8 that's right yeah no sir he never the little woman at the well she was immoral but she know that the churches that excommunicated her and but she never leaned up on her own understanding once she met this one at the well who told her all the sins that she had done she run into the city now it wasn't right for a woman to do that you're going say you think or she's a prostitute but when she had met Jesus she never leaned to the understanding of the people that day she come said she come see a man who told me the things [Music] she ever leaned upon her understanding no the Virgin Mary when the angel Gabriel met her and told her that she is going to have a baby without knowing a man never been she never leaned up on her own understanding that a woman could not have a baby but out having a husband she didn't lean up on that but she said be all the hands feet of the Lord be it unto me according to your word she didn't say a hammock or good family good how's this all gonna take place the angel said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and that holy thing will be born to be she'll be called the Son of God she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord she didn't take her reasonings that it couldn't be done she just said Behold the handmaid of the Lord that's right notice the the woman that had the bread issue the doctor told her said there's the hope she spent over living with the physicians and none of them could help her and she didn't lean upon death when Jesus she walked through the crowd as she said I'd leave if I can touch that man's garments I'll be made well she now wait the doctor said you can't get well she'd had this blood issue for years and years she got weaker all-time and worse the doctors to give her up that's all the understanding they had but she said by faith there's no scripture tell her to do that but she said if I could touch the border off his gun he'll be made well and she slipped around and touched him she walked back sit down Jesus turn around said who touched me look down till he found her he told her of her blood issue and she felt at that moment in her own body she could prove it then but she felt in her own body that her blood issue stopped she never reasoned if the doctor had turned her down how could anything else help her she never went to reason but she went to faith now the Bible said that he's the high priest today that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities yes see my right don't go Theresa say all that he said today he's that he is right now a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities the same yesterday today and forever what do you think when I was out there as a Baptist preacher and that angel the Lord met the other and commissioned me to go do this that I'm doing wha my pastor said you've gone crazy well you had a nightmare here I said you better take my fellowship card right now oh he said how can you with not even a Grammar School Education preached around the world how can you ever pray for kings and potentates and you can't even use your grammar ID I wasn't trusting in my grammar I was entrusted in ability I had I was commissioned if I had to listen to reasons that probably in thousands of people died years ago but I carried a message exactly like he said around and around the world and I'm going against by the grace of God reasons but our Commission hallelujah team thought you say you're 55 years old about 95 that don't mean a thing still the same God that he was of Abraham yeah yes sir lean not to your own understanding and after the sign went forth and the boys farther the church's begin to turn me down and close your doors upon doctrine that's any of them garrison to stand before me to get right or wrong ah challenge any of them not to be smart but I know where I'm at God what did they do what did they do to shut ever door now what do you go to do go dig up on the mountain house turn out the Lord I got one open door in the whole nation as far as I know that's Phoenix Arizona he's only one I got and I start out off mountain just as plain as I ever heard anybody said what's that - these follow thou me not about my old understanding Halloween for his promise oh don't lean upon reasons then you cry out with any fruit of all all hail the power of Jesus name that angels prostrate ball bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all yeah that's right don't lean upon what you think but somebody else thinks by faith accept the promise of God right will you do it thank you that isn't whether somebody else did it where they didn't do it but what about you what will you do with this Jesus call the cry that makes yourself known in this state as same as he did in that day and you're believing let us pray Lord Jesus King of Kings Lord of lords god of God thank you God of all potentates the first the last the Alpha Omega the beginning and the ending the bright morning star the roles of shared Lily LaValley routing offspring of David come Lord God the same yesterday today and forever bless this crowd of people Lord this just getting ready to start tomorrow we've had a little meeting here and you've blessed us in it you've made yourself known to us I pray God that you will continue to make yourself known to us bless us tonight help us now we're needy people lord down north I don't like to scold people but how can i push that holy burning I don't like to do that Lord you know my life my heart I must do it and I pray God that you'll help me to do just give me grace and never let me lean to my own understanding but let me lean up all night promise in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord thank God for the word and the encouragement I trust we'll take the counsel not to lean upon our understanding amen by the grace of God to take what God reveals believe it it's not for us to figure it out it's for us to believe it again Jesus wasn't asking Mary if she understood it he said I am he said Lazarus were right will rise again in the resurrection she oh yes she said I believe you'll rise in the future resurrection he said I am the resurrection and he said believers thou this he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die and though he were dead yet shall he live amen so believe us that's what God's asking us to do is believe his word whether was in the Garden of Eden believe what God said amen don't question it don't try to figure it out amen but the devil got there and he tried to get Eve to reason and me he said yeah she said he said yeah if God said yes she said but he said I he said yeah it got said but brother you don't put no buts in it a man you leave it the way God said it so she allowed the devil to put a butt in it and that's what the devil is still doing and he's been doing it right on down through the ages every time God came and gave His Word through a prophet or through whoever it was brother the word the revealed Word of God the enemy has come and said yeah God has said but a man remember the devil is there to preach the word the devil is there to preach the message but you know add a word here or you know take away a word there brother stay with the word don't take the devil's buts a man again that's what the goats do the goats but this and but that no no the Sheep just believes the word the sheep are gonna let God feed them a man it's like a knowing that she recognized their Shepherd I remember when we were in Israel with our brother George Smith and that's it back in 2008 and we were in the hotel in Jerusalem and I remember at one point there we look we're looking at a window and way over somewhere on a field there were some shepherds and sheep yeah amazing that God would God would do this to quicken to us to Revelation that we had already heard that we had all they believed concerning the sheep and the shepherds and the the Shepherd's began to move move around and this one moved there that will move there then are we we didn't know what was going on well then all of a sudden the Sheep began to move and it looked like they didn't like it was confusing because the Sheep was going this way this way this way undefined after a while we noticed that there was it was all oh these sheep were going that way these sheep are going that way these sheep are going that way why because they heard the voice of their Shepherd they recognized the voice of their shepherd and this one called him and not always she went to him just his own that the sheep that recognized his voice just a sheep that knew his name and so on so they went there and others went over here and others went to the other Shepherd and so on so brother God a man his sheep recognized his voice and they follow God's voice run all the way down through the all the way down through the Church ages the Sheep have followed God's voice where there's in Luther's age in Wesley's age the Pentecostal age where there was the old fashioned Salvation Army but it was it was God calling it was God speaking and the Sheep recognized it and went and went went in the direction of that voice by the grace of God and in this hour and in this age that's why we are where we are because why as the Sheep of God we recognized the voice of God speaking the Word of God a man sure we got one Luther ed+ what Wesley had we got what Wesley had plus what the Pentecostal said we got where the Pentecostals ANT+ what God has revealed for the bride a man he gave them the faith for that and he gave us to faith for it but now he's given us the faith for justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit and now he's given us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture hey man because now that's what God is looking for that's what God requires of us now hey man God's not just looking for all you believe justification sure that's absolute a man Lord we believe it we know that you justified us we know you sanctified us we know Lord did you give baptizes with the Holy Ghost in the new birth and and the gifts of the Spirit are there dude because I know I know a certain brother one time lift the impression that God did away with the gifts of the Holy Spirit No if he did away with the gifts of the Spirit he did away with the spirit the Holy Spirit because with the Holy Ghost comes the gifts of the Spirit amen there they're saying with justification were justified sanctification revelation were justified in Christ and so on oh my brother's sister the prophet of God they came and he didn't do away with it he said always said the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts are right there is it but they're just on the Shelf he said if we need them if we need them God will use them we will leave that with the Lord but there's there's there are those that believe that God did away with it all brother if God did away with the gifts he did away with justification if he did away with justification of sanctification and so on no brother God added to it amen we believe that plus plus plus plus a man though he go on and we're believing for the resurrection and the rapture a man old brother the prophecy this the prophets did that the prophets did all these signs and wonders but brother when they died they we know where they went into another dimension but their bodies were put down and threw into a grave somewhere and they never come back never come back but Jesus laid down his life and picked it up again amen he was the god prophet he man why because he came to fulfill the scriptures a man concerning the Messiah to God be the glory we'll see Elijah and all the other prophets and Moses they weren't ordained to do that they weren't the God prophets no no no Jesus was the God prophet he was God in flesh a man the and it was the fullness of the Godhead bodily the prophets were just God by measure in that prophet God that measure in that prophet but but in Jesus it was God himself - in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen praise the name of the Lord where's the prophets were just the word by measure but Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily he was the word for word 100% word in flesh he meant he said I am the resurrection and the life a man praise the name of the Lord so brother believers how this that Christ is in his bride now what for to bring forth the resurrection and the rapture the dead in Christ are waiting on us amen brother sister we are waiting on Jesus the dead the Old Testament Saints are waiting out Jesus he came and when he arose they rose they went into the city and appeared on to many a man to God be the glory brother what an hour were living what a tremendous hour that we're living god help us to believe please don't doubt it just saying I'm waiting on God God's gonna do this God's gonna do that well brother sister if Luther kept waiting and he and he refused to revelation brother he would never come to justification but he got as I said he did it he did everything he did this he did this he did that he went he did all kinds of things that he was taught that you had to do as the Catholic back then till finally but he still didn't feel justified he said Lord I'm looking for justification and I do this I do good works and I still not justified and to finally went in and he opened a Bible and he read it that the just shall live by faith and that Jesus was was one that justified us oh and as I said he took the no doubt the thing there and the feather and maybe ink and he wrote wrote in the on the Bible alone justified by faith alone amen and he in it from that moment on he was a different man he lived different act different amen he preached different Amen why because he felt oh now I know I'm justified Jesus has justified me praise the Lord Jesus sanctified us Jesus has baptizes with the Holy Ghost giving us access to his gifts amen and now Jesus is giving us the revelation and the faith of the resurrection and the rapture god help us amen brother god help us jesus said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me brother you wanna know what the resurrection of rapture it's in the word amen and what God has done in this hour in this age is to give the bride resurrection of rapturing faith the finish of the mystery of God the opening of the seven seals the prophet of God may mentioned about trying to educate the world and I remote a family doctor that I had many years ago I would say that he would be gone on now but I was in to see that doctor and he was checking some things out in me as a doctor your family doctor might do and I did I do remember that I had a trach here in my pocket and he was talking to me and about different things that eventually became spiritual and he said Jarrell you mean to tell me that he said that person you're talking about that can't read the Bible that he would know more about the Bible he would nor more about God and God's plan then he said somebody that's been several years in a Bible College studying the Bible he said you mean to tell me that other first person would know more about the Bible than that person I said yes I said because the one that can't read but he can hear it when it's read to him I said he got the Holy Ghost in his heart and the Holy Ghost is quickening the word that making it alive to him real to him whereas the old fellow's going by education I said and he's gone by the letter of the word but he's not getting the risperdal of it in his heart oh oh I said I oh that's what you mean yes I said that's what I mean I was referring to a great uncle of mine from years ago brother lane and he believed the message he believed what God has done he believed what God was going to do and so on and but he couldn't read no no he had a Bible and so on but he couldn't read it you never had that education now his wife could read it and he believed it a man and he had the understanding that educated people never had when it come to the Bible why because he had the Holy Ghost Christ in him was revealing it read the word oh yes he believed it and he understood it a man and so when we finished our conversation the doctor reached in and took them took the track he looked at it and he laid it on his desk and he kept it a man so I pray God rest his soul amen because he was believing what I was telling her understanding what I was telling him by the grace of God amen do a couple of things I had highlighted here but I want I won't go any further into it amen amen because of the time so the Lord bless you and God help us don't lean to your own understanding brother depend on the Holy Spirit in you to reveal what God has done and what God is doing to reveal to you what God has said right here in the word believe it God never asked us to figure it out he asked us to believe it he never asked Martha do you understand it he asked her do you believe it because he said I am the resurrection and the life amen so do we believe it if if she said ah yes Lord I believe if she believed that then do we believe it now amen because she lived she lived to meet Jesus who came back from the dead a man and brother sister we have lived to see the Ministry of that same Jesus revealed in and through a prophetic ministry hey man I'll tell you this it wasn't william branham no no brother BAM said I can't do this when he had when he when he got up with those doors that sign in his hand and he was discerning the thoughts and intents of a person's art past present and future he said that's not me he's I can't do that he said I got to get at him out of the way now so Jesus can come and do it amen and that's who was doing it anyway it was it wasn't I wasn't it like like like many thought that William Branham at a gift of discernment it wasn't a gift a gift of discernment can discern your thoughts present tense my brother the gift the anointing that was on the prophet of God for this hour went back into a person's past not just a present tense but and then went into a person's future oh yeah and he someone asked him one time about a certain thing that he did he said brother man what did you do this when when you had this prayer line and you would say you tell us to tell a certain person oh this is your name you're from here this is what happened to you and he's a brother BAM sometimes you would say oh they'll say it the Lord knew you're healed call your way and rejoice and praise the Lord and others father bound you would say you would tell him all these things and then you would instead of saying they were healed you will say go your way and just trust the Lord yes he said there's a wife why didn't you tell him whether or not they were healed be cases I saw them in a coffin and he said they were going to die so he said I never told him that I just tell him to go on trust the Lord amen so he knew the past the present and the future and that wasn't really Branham that was Jesus Christ came in the flesh of his bright and they and the prophet of God said he said the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now in the bright for the resurrection and for the rapture amen grace of God to us is my prayer brother that's the scripture says bear with me we will finish with this looking for a scripture here be all I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God the last Rome and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen brother not children of the night but children of the day will be part of that resurrection a part of that rapture by the grace of God amen god help us to believe and God help us to claim the promise amen god help us to keep pressing on to the change please and the name of the Lord don't ignore it but let it be a revelation that we lived with constantly morning noon and night the revelation of the Resurrection the revelation of the rapture brother every time you pass the cemetery it ought to it ought
