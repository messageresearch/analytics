[43:19] they they've really doubled down on this

[43:24] like God and his middle name Michael
[43:27] means who is like

[43:48] made us he made us in His image and as
[43:51] cute as little Kachi is he's not in His
[43:54] image yet amen but I believe you'll hear
[43:57] by the sermon we're going to preach this
[43:58] morning God is bringing us back to his
[44:00] image God has come down to bring us back
[44:03] into his image and in the Old Testament
[44:05] they used to bring them in on the 8th
[44:06] day and they come in and they'd
[44:08] circumcise them that circumcision was to
[44:10] put them under the Covenant it was to
[44:12] join them to the promises of God and so
[44:15] today we don't bring them in to
[44:16] circumcise them I'm certainly not
[44:17] qualified to do that this morning but
[44:20] what we do is we bring him in and we say
[44:22] Lord we want him under your Covenant we
[44:24] want him under the Grace Covenant and
[44:26] really what we're doing is parents as
[44:27] we're humbling
[44:28] ourselves we're saying I can't do it I
[44:31] can't do it on my own we can we can do
[44:33] our best to follow the principles of the
[44:35] word but what we seek is the Holy Spirit
[44:37] to lead us by his word to show us how to
[44:40] raise our sons and daughters in the fear
[44:41] and admonition of the Lord and so we
[44:43] want to dedicate little Kachi this
[44:45] morning to the Lord if I can take him
[44:47] from
[44:48] you hey

[46:46] musicians thank you this morning Exodus
[46:48] chapter
[46:51] 3 and verse 7 Exodus 3 and verse 7 very
[46:56] familiar scripture this
[46:58] morning this is God speaking to Moses
[47:01] now out of the burning
[47:06] bush Exodus 3:7 says and the Lord said I
[47:09] have surely seen the Affliction of my
[47:11] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[47:14] their Cry by reason of their task
[47:15] Masters for I know their
[47:18] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[47:21] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[47:23] and to bring them up out of that land
[47:24] unto a good land and a large unto a land
[47:27] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[47:30] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[47:32] the amorites the perizzites the hivites
[47:35] and the jebusites amen God bless you
[47:37] let's bow our heads each one Heavenly
[47:39] Father Lord may you just take your word

[47:46] just go in and anchor deep Lord may it
[47:48] spark something this morning Lord that
[47:49] would just reveal more of you and us
[47:52] Lord that would change us a little more
[47:53] into that image this morning we pray
[47:56] Lord take this service this people this
[47:58] time that we've set aside Lord to hear
[48:00] your word Lord and may you make us fit
[48:02] for service Lord by what we hear this
[48:04] morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[48:06] we ask it amen amen God bless you you
[48:09] can have your seats this morning I
[48:11] certainly enjoyed our service on
[48:12] Wednesday that brother Garfield preached
[48:14] and I want to just take him take where
[48:16] he stopped in in some ways and just
[48:18] continue that this morning and I want to
[48:20] take a title this morning will'll be on
[48:22] this a few Services by God's grace
[48:24] called the condescending God Amen the
[48:26] condescending God and and our series is
[48:28] focused on the holy spirit this this
[48:30] series on the token life the token of
[48:32] the Holy Spirit the requirement of God
[48:34] for this this age this is this is the
[48:37] whole uh effort that God is doing in
[48:40] this age is to bring us to the fullness
[48:42] of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Amen to
[48:45] bring us back to the fullness of our
[48:46] Redemption and I think one of the things
[48:48] that keeps us realizing that full power
[48:50] that that recognition of what's going on
[48:53] within a born again child of God is that
[48:54] we look at the Holy Spirit as a thing
[48:57] instead of as a person now now that
[48:59] seems a bit odd but the thing is what do
[49:01] we say we say well what do you need to
[49:03] do to truly be saved you need to get the
[49:05] Holy Ghost we don't need we don't say
[49:08] you need to get Holy Ghost we say the
[49:10] Holy Ghost we we treat it like a thing
[49:12] rather than a person if I was to say to
[49:14] you this morning you know all you need
[49:16] is all the right vitamins in your body
[49:18] and you'll be healthy then what would we
[49:19] do all day we'd be taking all these
[49:21] vitamins but if we could have a
[49:22] dispenser built into us that gave us
[49:24] exactly what we needed that's what we'd
[49:26] be looking for is what can I have inside
[49:28] of me that'll give me everything I need
[49:30] and so often what we look at at the holy
[49:31] spirit is we look at it as a
[49:33] dispenser as opposed to a
[49:36] person and because it's a thing then
[49:39] there is not a personality attached to
[49:41] that that we have to subject ourselves
[49:42] to but if we can see it as the person of
[49:45] God inside of us the very life of Jesus
[49:47] Christ inside of us then it changes our
[49:49] perspective amen and so we have to see
[49:51] that the holy spirit is the literal life
[49:54] of Jesus Christ inside of us this
[49:55] morning it is the person of Jesus Christ
[49:58] it's the very nature it's the very
[50:00] attributes of God and yes you have a
[50:02] little bit and I have a little bit we
[50:04] don't have it all but what we have has
[50:07] every portion of him that there is to be
[50:09] it has every attribute it has every
[50:11] Power it has every blessing it has every
[50:14] portion of our inheritance in it we just
[50:16] don't have it all that was for Christ
[50:18] Alone the fullness of the godhead bodily
[50:20] so if God is love and he is then we have
[50:23] a portion of that love if God is peace
[50:25] then we have a portion of that peace if
[50:27] God is rest we have a portion of that
[50:28] rest if God is all of these things then
[50:31] we have a portion of it and I'm not
[50:32] trying to diminish what you have this
[50:34] morning I'm trying to elevate your
[50:36] understanding of who it is that's living
[50:38] inside you this morning because we could
[50:40] say today brother John if I had all the
[50:42] money in the world that would be a
[50:44] wonderful thing but what if I said you
[50:46] had a small portion of all of the money
[50:49] if you said I only have 1% of all the
[50:52] money in the world you would still be a
[50:54] billionaire this morning when we look at
[50:57] God and you say I only have a portion of
[51:00] joy unspeakable how much joy do you have
[51:03] if I only have a portion of all
[51:05] knowledge how much knowledge do you have
[51:07] because he is he is he is unheld back by
[51:10] in his nature and in his person and when
[51:12] you have a portion of the the absolute
[51:16] of of the everything you have more than
[51:19] this world will ever have and can never
[51:20] give to you that's what we have inside
[51:23] of us this morning that when the spirit
[51:25] of God is living inside you by measure
[51:27] yet you have more than enough to take
[51:29] you to the end of your journey you have
[51:30] more than enough to do what you need
[51:32] done in your life this morning whether
[51:34] it's in your body in your spirit in your
[51:36] soul in your life whatever it might be
[51:38] whatever you've been born with whatever
[51:40] curse you feel you're under whatever
[51:42] hardships you're facing the spirit of
[51:44] God is more than enough to take you on
[51:46] through those
[51:47] situations but I want to take us back
[51:49] briefly this morning to set a a pattern
[51:52] in the scriptures and in the Old
[51:53] Testament because we're supposed to do
[51:55] that we don't just want to preach
[51:56] Doctrine out of one one scripture one
[51:59] point but we ought to be able to set a
[52:00] pattern from Genesis to Revelation to
[52:02] show how God moves and I want to talk to
[52:05] you this morning about how God and why
[52:07] God steps out of glory and condescends
[52:09] to be with his people I want to show
[52:11] what God does why does God come down
[52:14] that's the question we want to answer
[52:16] this morning and I want to start by
[52:17] saying this one thing our daytoday
[52:20] circumstances is not what moves
[52:22] God that is not what moves God see we
[52:26] tend to think that God's coming down to
[52:28] deal with circumstances no God's coming
[52:30] down to deal with us and too many times
[52:33] we're looking for change in
[52:34] circumstances when God's trying to
[52:36] change us and so that's what you'll see
[52:38] when Jesus comes is that they did not
[52:41] recognize him as Messiah because they
[52:43] were looking for Isaiah the the
[52:45] Fulfillment of Isaiah to take them under
[52:47] out from under Roman rule and instead he
[52:50] came to set them free from themselves he
[52:51] came to set them free from dead religion
[52:54] he came to fulfill the law so that they
[52:56] could live in newness of Life under the
[52:57] power of His Spirit but because he
[52:59] didn't change their circumstances God
[53:02] and morphate in flesh Emmanuel God With
[53:04] Us did not change their circumstances
[53:07] they rejected him his circum their
[53:10] circumstances in life were not what
[53:11] brought him
[53:12] down but I'll tell you one thing thing
[53:16] that moves God and that's faith in his
[53:17] word you want God to come in your life
[53:20] you have to have faith in his word you
[53:21] have to stand on his word I've said it
[53:24] many times if you want God to answer
[53:26] your prayer find your prayer in his word
[53:29] because if you can find your resting
[53:31] place on the unchanging word of God you
[53:34] have a compass pointing to the north
[53:36] star and he cannot fail to come in and
[53:39] meet your need because now you're
[53:41] standing in his word and his spirit is
[53:43] there to fulfill his word on a daily
[53:44] basis that's what we're supposed to do
[53:47] but we are in a Plan of Redemption we're
[53:50] in a plan that that that God is is
[53:53] moving and doing to bring us back to our
[53:55] original position position so where we
[53:57] are today in our flesh and in life
[53:59] circumstances is not where we were meant
[54:01] to be but God is not here to change our
[54:04] circumstances God is here to change his
[54:07] people his promise is for his people not
[54:09] for their circumstances we'll see God
[54:11] does change circumstances I believe God
[54:13] changes circumstances but that is the
[54:16] last thing on his list the first thing
[54:18] is to change this little person here
[54:20] this poor miserable beggar that I am
[54:22] amen but God moves by faith in his word
[54:25] and God moves according to his Sovereign
[54:27] will and purpose and when God does it
[54:30] he's moving with an intention God
[54:33] doesn't just get bored and say I'm going
[54:34] to come down to earth and spend some
[54:36] time with my family for a little bit God
[54:38] comes down with intention he has a
[54:40] purpose behind his movement he's not up
[54:42] there getting tired or impatient or
[54:44] frustrated time means nothing to God he
[54:47] dwells in eternity he steps into our
[54:49] time to to to to deal with us but he's
[54:52] not up there frustrated he's got a plan
[54:54] that's already laid out he knows the end
[54:56] from the beginning so he's not caught
[54:59] out by surprise he's not wondering what
[55:01] we're going to do he's not wondering how
[55:02] it's going to work out but he steps down
[55:04] now out of his Sovereign Place in glory
[55:07] and steps into this world to do
[55:09] something in our time and in our season
[55:12] he always moves with purpose and I want
[55:14] you to see this as we go back to our
[55:16] opening scripture in Exodus 3 this is
[55:18] now God again speaking to Moses out of
[55:20] the burning bush and he says moreover he
[55:22] said I'm the god of thy father the god
[55:24] of Abraham the god of Isaac the the god
[55:26] of Jacob and Moses HD his face for he
[55:29] was afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[55:32] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[55:35] of my people which are in Egypt and have
[55:37] heard their Cry by reason of their
[55:38] taskmasters for I know their sorrows now
[55:42] you say brother John he's coming down
[55:43] because of their circumstances Church
[55:45] they've been in those circumstances for
[55:47] 400 years and he never moved why is he
[55:51] moving now he's moving now because in
[55:54] Genesis 15 he said will be there for 400
[55:58] years and after that is when I will move
[56:01] that's why he's coming down is because
[56:03] he's coming to fulfill his prophetic
[56:05] word in their lives and until that time
[56:09] came they could cry they could moan they
[56:12] could raise their hands they could have
[56:14] Spirit-filled services but it would not
[56:16] change a thing because God operates
[56:18] according to his word not according to
[56:21] our
[56:22] circumstances so he comes down here and
[56:24] he says yes I've heard it but I'm moving
[56:28] because it's time to move because I've
[56:31] set a time I've set a season and God
[56:34] moves in according to his own Sovereign
[56:35] will and plan he says now I am come down
[56:39] to deliver them out of the hands of the
[56:42] Egyptians oh it's not just about
[56:44] Deliverance Church you say I want to be
[56:47] set free this morning I want healing I
[56:50] want provision I want guidance but do
[56:53] you want what he has for you because
[56:56] because he doesn't set us free to go do
[56:58] our own thing he didn't set them free so
[57:00] they could all split up he says I have
[57:02] come down to deliver them out of the
[57:03] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[57:08] up out of that land into a good
[57:11] land and a large you say I don't he
[57:14] doesn't have enough for me Church he's
[57:16] got more than enough for you this
[57:17] morning he's got room for every one of
[57:19] his children he has a place prepared for
[57:22] every one of us every needs subli he
[57:25] says a large unto a land flowing with
[57:27] milk and honey under the place of all
[57:29] these different things so again he's not
[57:30] setting us free to do our own thing did
[57:33] they have a choice yes they did they
[57:35] could have walked out of Egypt and gone
[57:36] their own way but the pillar of fire
[57:38] went before them to show where God
[57:40] wanted them to go and he led them
[57:42] according to what his word said he would
[57:44] do it was to the land that he had
[57:45] declared flowing with milk and honey
[57:47] with a lot of people in it as well amen
[57:50] God's moving to fulfill his word you've
[57:52] got a choice go with him or go your own
[57:54] way and we that there was a lot of
[57:57] people set free that day that couldn't
[57:59] walk into that
[58:01] land we'll see this as we go through our
[58:03] service today God sets people free and
[58:05] what do they do they walk away from
[58:08] him why because there was nothing in
[58:10] them in the first place to follow after
[58:12] these things you look at this scene and
[58:14] you'd say well brother John why did he
[58:16] have to lead them out of Egypt today
[58:18] we'd say start a
[58:19] revolution when you look through history
[58:21] when slaves revolted what did they do
[58:23] they just came up they killed their
[58:25] masters and took what they had and
[58:26] stayed there and made it their own God
[58:28] says I'm not going to put you in a place
[58:30] that's already been provided I'm going
[58:32] to take you to my place I'm going to put
[58:35] you under my word I'm going to put you
[58:36] under my protection I'm going to put you
[58:38] under my provision I'm going to put you
[58:40] under my leadership and I'm going to do
[58:42] a sovereign work to provide for you now
[58:45] you don't take what they have that'll
[58:46] just take you back into
[58:48] slavery I'm going to take you under my
[58:51] protection and I'm going to do things my
[58:53] way and under that you'll be blessed in
[58:54] a way you could never be blessed on your
[58:57] own God's doing it his way and his way
[58:59] alone Church God's God I I'm learning
[59:03] day by day I've learned and I'm
[59:04] continuing to learn when situations
[59:06] arise let God deal with it as a pastor
[59:10] so many times in my Germanic nature is
[59:12] to always nip it in the bud nip it in
[59:15] the bud I've had to learn let go and let
[59:18] God lead cuz you're his children you're
[59:21] not my children you're his sheep you're
[59:23] not my sheep you're his inheritance
[59:25] you're not my inheritance I'm merely a
[59:28] vessel a tool that he can use and so
[59:31] being able to sit back and say God
[59:33] you're God you know all things you see
[59:35] all things I'll tell you one thing I've
[59:37] learned this very very quickly coming
[59:39] into Ministry is I don't see everything
[59:41] I don't know everything I don't
[59:43] understand everything and it's I get I
[59:45] get so much further so much faster if I
[59:48] sit back and I say Lord what would you
[59:50] have me to do rather than go to him and
[59:52] say here's what I know and here's what I
[59:53] think I should do to be open to allow
[59:57] him to be God in these things God has a
[59:59] plan it's a perfect plan and if I can
[1:00:02] step back and say Lord I
[1:00:04] Surrender You
[1:00:07] Lead You Tarzan me
[1:00:09] Jane you lead the way you know where
[1:00:12] we're going you know how to do this
[1:00:15] watch what God does now he says now
[1:00:17] therefore Behold The Cry of the children
[1:00:19] of israels come unto me and I've have
[1:00:21] also seen the oppression wherewith the
[1:00:23] Egyptians oppressed them come now
[1:00:25] therefore and I will
[1:00:28] send wait God said I've come
[1:00:31] down how come God's not going who does
[1:00:35] he send a 40-year past
[1:00:39] failure a man that's lost his education
[1:00:42] a man that's lost his ability to speak a
[1:00:44] man that's lost his ability to
[1:00:47] lead God sends a 40-year-old want to be
[1:00:50] an 80-year-old WN to be deliverer that's
[1:00:52] 40 years past his prime I will send thee
[1:00:56] unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[1:00:59] forth my people the children of Israel
[1:01:00] out of Egypt I want you to catch that
[1:01:02] because we see in scripture too many
[1:01:04] times people are looking for the
[1:01:07] Supernatural and they
[1:01:08] miss the Simplicity of God see we want
[1:01:12] dreams we want Visions we want tongues
[1:01:14] and interpretation we want Thunder we
[1:01:17] want lightning we want something to just
[1:01:18] drop down and meanwhile God's using a
[1:01:21] simple little failed man to bring the
[1:01:24] people out
[1:01:26] I'm not saying we don't have dreams and
[1:01:27] Visions in the
[1:01:28] Supernatural but I'm saying don't miss
[1:01:30] what God's doing either because God uses
[1:01:33] people God uses ministers God uses the
[1:01:36] body of Christ to do his work he's the
[1:01:40] head he's the inspiration he's the lead
[1:01:42] he's the guide but he's here working
[1:01:43] through his body to do things and so
[1:01:45] many times we're looking for God to do
[1:01:47] something and he's saying I've already
[1:01:48] sent you that brother I've already sent
[1:01:49] you that sister and they're there to
[1:01:51] help you through this they're there to
[1:01:53] help you do these things but God moves
[1:01:56] why to fulfill his word in this
[1:01:57] situation yes the circumstances were bad
[1:02:00] the people were in a hard place but
[1:02:01] they've been there for over 400 years
[1:02:03] and that hadn't moved God he moved when
[1:02:05] it was time for his word to be fulfilled
[1:02:08] and he didn't just move to give them
[1:02:09] their freedom like I said he didn't just
[1:02:11] move to give them Choice he gave them a
[1:02:13] choice but they was hoping that their
[1:02:15] choice would be his choice that his way
[1:02:17] would be their way that his worship
[1:02:19] would be their worship His law would be
[1:02:21] their law but they had to make a choice
[1:02:23] that day time and time we see God move
[1:02:26] on the scene and what's he trying to do
[1:02:27] Church get people back to his word
[1:02:30] that's it get people back to his word
[1:02:33] you say brother John I'm dealing with a
[1:02:35] hard circumstance today where are you at
[1:02:37] in his word if you find your way back to
[1:02:39] his word that's the sure resting place
[1:02:41] that you're looking for if you can come
[1:02:43] back to where he told you to be then God
[1:02:46] can deal with you he can deal with your
[1:02:48] situations you can have
[1:02:49] confidence not in our
[1:02:51] self-righteousness but in simple humble
[1:02:54] obedience to his word Lord you told me
[1:02:57] to do it and now I'm doing it and now
[1:02:59] it's not now we're in his hands we're
[1:03:00] not in our hands amen now we're under
[1:03:03] his leadership not under our
[1:03:07] leadership God was moving to try and get
[1:03:09] them to a place where they could rest
[1:03:10] Under the Umbrella of his promise just
[1:03:12] like Abraham did but in a permanent
[1:03:15] place rather than so Journey throughout
[1:03:16] the land and these different
[1:03:18] things but we have to keep something in
[1:03:21] mind as we're going through this and
[1:03:22] this is really the basis of our the
[1:03:23] message this morning and brother
[1:03:25] Garfield touched on this on Wednesday
[1:03:26] night see God has a hierarchy of
[1:03:29] importance when it comes to dealing with
[1:03:31] his people okay God has things that
[1:03:33] matter more God has things that matter
[1:03:36] moderately and then God has things that
[1:03:37] really don't matter that much in the big
[1:03:39] scheme of things God is first and
[1:03:41] formost interested in our soul that is
[1:03:44] the very first thing a soul is worth
[1:03:47] 10,000 worlds to God it is priceless
[1:03:49] because if you're a child of God that
[1:03:51] soul is a part of him amen and so it's
[1:03:53] worth everything to him that's the
[1:03:55] Eternal portion of our being if we are a
[1:03:58] child of God now I want to take us back
[1:03:59] to Ezekiel 36 because God's talking
[1:04:02] about what matters to him you'll know
[1:04:04] what matters to God based on how he
[1:04:06] works if it doesn't matter to him then
[1:04:08] he doesn't work with it but if it does
[1:04:10] matter to him then he steps into it and
[1:04:12] we've read this before and I'm not going
[1:04:13] to read the whole scripture here but I
[1:04:14] want you to point to to to look at this
[1:04:17] idea he's saying to Israel and we are
[1:04:19] Abraham seed by faith we under this same
[1:04:21] Covenant he says I'm going to take you
[1:04:23] from the heathens gather you from where
[1:04:25] you are I'm going to a Sprinkle clean
[1:04:26] water on you and you'll be clean from
[1:04:28] your filthiness and your idols and I'll
[1:04:30] cleanse you then he says a new heart
[1:04:32] will I give you and a new spirit will I
[1:04:34] put within you and I will take away the
[1:04:35] Stony heart out of your flesh I'll give
[1:04:37] you a heart of Flesh and I will put my
[1:04:39] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[1:04:42] in my statutes and you shall keep my
[1:04:44] judgments and do them and I've preached
[1:04:46] on this before so I won't preach too
[1:04:48] much on it this morning but you have to
[1:04:50] understand here is that nowhere do I
[1:04:52] appear in the actions of this verse God
[1:04:55] says I God doesn't say I will do this
[1:04:58] and you will do that and it will be a
[1:04:59] perfect work God says I will I will I
[1:05:03] will and I say I will receive I will
[1:05:05] receive I will receive and out of that
[1:05:07] comes a perfect work it is not God plus
[1:05:10] me it's God God God and out of that
[1:05:12] comes god in me it is his perfect work
[1:05:15] amen because when we add our portion to
[1:05:17] God it turns it into imperfection it
[1:05:20] takes away the absolute it takes away
[1:05:22] the truth it takes away the foundation
[1:05:24] it h breeds the
[1:05:26] seed because it Blends intellect with
[1:05:29] the word and that doesn't get us
[1:05:31] anywhere we saw that with Eve in the
[1:05:33] beginning we saw it with Canan and his
[1:05:35] worship when we add ourselves to what
[1:05:37] God wants it takes it into
[1:05:39] imperfection okay if we could do it
[1:05:42] Church we'd have already done
[1:05:44] it look around we've had 6,000 years to
[1:05:47] do God's work and what has happened
[1:05:49] nothing you've got 30 on Thousand
[1:05:52] denominations saying that they can do it
[1:05:55] that's that's why we're not a
[1:05:56] denomination the minute you put a period
[1:05:59] behind what you believe you kick God out
[1:06:02] because youve said it only goes as far
[1:06:03] as my understanding no no no we have to
[1:06:06] be open for God to further reveal
[1:06:08] himself to us on a daily basis amen the
[1:06:11] world tells us we know how to raise
[1:06:13] families we know how to take care of the
[1:06:15] earth we know how to take care of the
[1:06:17] people we know how to have a good
[1:06:18] marriage and do they no all we have is
[1:06:22] Fallen failed systems and people
[1:06:27] seems like today we struggle less to
[1:06:30] survive right we have refrigeration we
[1:06:32] have a supply chain that allows us to
[1:06:34] eat mangoes in January in New
[1:06:37] Finland okay unheard of supplies of food
[1:06:41] and and a way to to to have things when
[1:06:44] we don't plant and we don't Harvest and
[1:06:46] we don't hunt and we don't kill or
[1:06:47] butcher these things we have every need
[1:06:50] supplied so that we don't have to
[1:06:51] survive and yet today people are
[1:06:53] struggling yet to live with
[1:06:56] purpose all that it's done has made our
[1:06:59] lives more complicated and we've lost
[1:07:01] our reason for living it takes the word
[1:07:04] it takes God inside of us to give us
[1:07:06] purpose for life I think that's what
[1:07:08] we're seeing today so much as people go
[1:07:10] so far out on the limb because they're
[1:07:11] trying to find a purpose and so what do
[1:07:13] they do they find the world's craziest
[1:07:14] cause and they decide I'm going to
[1:07:16] support it I'm going to live for it I'm
[1:07:17] going to make this my goal in life
[1:07:20] rather than coming back to the
[1:07:21] Simplicity of the word of
[1:07:23] God look at Cain
[1:07:26] Cain tried to do it Cain tried to add
[1:07:29] his way of worship to God's requirement
[1:07:32] and God corrected him God gave him an
[1:07:35] opportunity and yet Cain turned it down
[1:07:38] Nimrod did the same
[1:07:39] thing and you see it then Through the
[1:07:42] Ages even into this day is men and women
[1:07:44] trying to produce a system that will
[1:07:46] give them the results that God said only
[1:07:48] come through him by simple obedience to
[1:07:50] his
[1:07:51] word takes God in our lives to do those
[1:07:54] things to get is truly living the way
[1:07:56] that we ought to live and we see if we
[1:07:58] look in the Old Testament God comes down
[1:08:00] time and time again he comes down with
[1:08:02] Moses he comes down with Joshua he comes
[1:08:05] down in the judges he comes down through
[1:08:06] Samuel he comes down through Saul he
[1:08:08] comes through David and then he starts
[1:08:09] to get pushed out more and more and more
[1:08:11] and yet God comes down time and time
[1:08:13] again but the effects are always
[1:08:15] temporary it's always temporary because
[1:08:17] the people couldn't hold on to him the
[1:08:19] people couldn't hold on to Victory the
[1:08:21] people couldn't hold on to the word
[1:08:23] their own nature their own Fallen flesh
[1:08:25] would p pull them away and so time and
[1:08:27] time again they go from blessing into
[1:08:28] curse they go from blessing into
[1:08:30] judgment because they kept walking away
[1:08:32] from the word God was with them God
[1:08:34] condescended to come down time and time
[1:08:37] again and yet it never held them it
[1:08:39] never held them you look at David a man
[1:08:43] after God's Own Heart the very desires
[1:08:45] of his heart were the same as God's and
[1:08:47] yet you read the Psalms and you see
[1:08:49] David's frustration with himself for not
[1:08:51] being able to live the life that he
[1:08:52] wants to live
[1:08:55] God being with us is not
[1:08:57] enough it's going to take God in
[1:09:00] us and we'll see that as we go through
[1:09:02] this this little mini portion or this
[1:09:03] Min series that we're doing here we've
[1:09:05] got a power today that they don't have
[1:09:07] I'm not saying we don't have ups and
[1:09:09] downs but the way that God looks at us
[1:09:12] now is different too because he looks
[1:09:14] through the
[1:09:15] blood but we're talking about this
[1:09:17] hierarchy that God's had that God has
[1:09:19] and we look in Ezekiel 36 and we see
[1:09:21] that God is talking about the soul he's
[1:09:23] talking about our spirit which is our
[1:09:24] nature he's pointing to our attributes
[1:09:26] and he's pointing to a time he's
[1:09:28] prophesying of a time where he'll change
[1:09:30] us from the inside out where he'll do an
[1:09:32] inner work to produce an outer effect
[1:09:34] see to many times under the law it was
[1:09:36] all about the outer person and the inner
[1:09:38] person never changed and it could never
[1:09:40] make you perfect Paul said even the
[1:09:42] blood that you that was shed even the
[1:09:44] sacrifices the atonement that was given
[1:09:46] it couldn't make you perfect and it
[1:09:47] couldn't cleanse your conscience and so
[1:09:49] people would walk out the same way that
[1:09:51] they came in but he's showing here in in
[1:09:53] Ezekiel 36 that he's not going to change
[1:09:55] the outer man he's going to change the
[1:09:56] Inner Man and it'll have an outer work
[1:09:58] that's the greatest change that you can
[1:10:00] have in this life church is an inner
[1:10:02] life it's a new creation is what he's
[1:10:03] pointing to because the old creation is
[1:10:05] born under sin he's wanting you to be
[1:10:07] born by the word now he's wanting you to
[1:10:09] be a new creation and so from this we
[1:10:11] see a hierarchy and I I would call it
[1:10:13] this morning spiritual triage when you
[1:10:15] go into a hospital if you go in and you
[1:10:17] have a torn Little Nail guess when
[1:10:19] you're going to be
[1:10:20] seen
[1:10:22] never because you got people that are
[1:10:24] having heart attacks ATT and you got
[1:10:25] people with broken bones and you got
[1:10:27] people that are struggling to breathe
[1:10:29] and people with rashes and cuts and
[1:10:30] wounds you got a little hang nail you're
[1:10:32] never going to get into that into that
[1:10:34] doctor in the AR cuz you have something
[1:10:37] that's not life-threatening and so when
[1:10:39] God looks at us he's got a a spiritual
[1:10:41] triage and the first thing he starts
[1:10:43] with is the soul because God wants to
[1:10:46] get your soul in the proper condition
[1:10:48] amen so that's what he came down to do
[1:10:51] and then he comes down after that and he
[1:10:53] says look not only is your soul needing
[1:10:55] a touch but your spirit needs a touch
[1:10:58] now your spirit is your nature and he
[1:11:00] says you need a nature change and that's
[1:11:01] a part of the three works of Grace
[1:11:03] because remember what brother Brown
[1:11:04] would say he says listen you couldn't
[1:11:06] even get along with yourself under your
[1:11:07] original nature you can't get along with
[1:11:10] other people you definitely can't get
[1:11:11] along with God so he has to give you a
[1:11:14] new nature so you can get along with
[1:11:16] God's nature he needs to give you a new
[1:11:19] spirit so you can get along with his
[1:11:20] spirit and when he does that then that
[1:11:23] opens up the opportunity for his spirit
[1:11:25] to come in inside of our of Our Lives
[1:11:27] amen so our spirit does not reside in
[1:11:29] our soul his Spirit resides in our soul
[1:11:33] and our spirit has to become subject to
[1:11:35] his spirit because remember the soul is
[1:11:38] the Throne of the life it it's the seed
[1:11:40] of power so whatever influence your soul
[1:11:43] is under is what will have ultimate
[1:11:45] Authority in your life so if my spirit
[1:11:47] is in my soul then guess who's in
[1:11:48] control this Fallen guy even if I'm a
[1:11:53] Child of God that's not going to get me
[1:11:55] there the new spirit he gives me is not
[1:11:57] enough that's why he says I've got to
[1:11:59] give you my spirit and only after I give
[1:12:00] you my spirit will you be able to walk
[1:12:02] in my statutes the way I want you to
[1:12:04] that's the only way you can walk and
[1:12:05] live by the word is by my spirit that's
[1:12:08] the only way it's going to happen amen
[1:12:10] so the Holy Spirit dwells in our soul
[1:12:12] it's the Seal of our soul Paul said
[1:12:15] until the day of our full Redemption
[1:12:17] amen and that Spirit though is the
[1:12:19] promise of God it's a part of the
[1:12:20] promise of God and that will go with us
[1:12:23] even to the other side because you
[1:12:25] remember your spirit is connected to
[1:12:27] your character you don't have the right
[1:12:29] Spirit then your character is going to
[1:12:31] be all wrong what is it that makes us do
[1:12:34] the right
[1:12:35] thing it's the influence of our
[1:12:38] spirit it's the influence of the Holy
[1:12:40] Spirit on our spirit but you go and you
[1:12:42] look in the Book of Revelation you'll
[1:12:44] see there's prophets talking to John and
[1:12:46] even over there they still have the
[1:12:47] spirit of a prophet they have a nature
[1:12:49] of a prophet remember that one John
[1:12:51] talks to to two different a prophet up
[1:12:54] there two different times he says don't
[1:12:55] bow to me I'm of your brethren the
[1:12:57] prophets he still had that nature there
[1:12:59] but he always was pointing to somebody
[1:13:01] else Samuel when Saul spoke to him he
[1:13:04] still had the nature of a prophet even
[1:13:06] over
[1:13:07] there see it goes with us but the one we
[1:13:10] take with us is from God that's why it
[1:13:11] can go with us it's not my nature now
[1:13:14] it's a nature he gave me and so we'll go
[1:13:16] over there and we'll have that with us I
[1:13:17] believe but God first deals with our
[1:13:19] soul and then next God is interested in
[1:13:22] our spirit in our nature and then after
[1:13:24] that comes our flesh our body our health
[1:13:26] in these Earthly conditions God isn't
[1:13:28] looking to change your Earthly
[1:13:30] conditions or deal with your flesh if
[1:13:31] your spirit is at odds with him and if
[1:13:34] your soul is not sealed to the day of
[1:13:35] your Redemption then God is more
[1:13:37] interested in that than in your body see
[1:13:40] so often we're we're looking for him to
[1:13:41] change this and he's saying we've got a
[1:13:44] bigger problem we've got a deeper
[1:13:45] problem and so we've got to deal with
[1:13:47] that listen you can look in the
[1:13:49] scriptures where God will sovereignly
[1:13:51] come down and touch somebody's body and
[1:13:54] usually they walk away and they have
[1:13:56] nothing to do with God after
[1:13:57] that some do most don't you look in the
[1:14:02] scriptures in Jesus and he heals the 10
[1:14:04] lepers how many came back one one the
[1:14:09] rest went their way the scripture says
[1:14:11] that Jesus healed thousands upon
[1:14:14] thousands that Jesus would sit down and
[1:14:16] he would preach the word and then it
[1:14:18] would say he healed them
[1:14:20] everyone not a single person left that
[1:14:22] meeting unhealed and yet on the day of
[1:14:25] Pentecost how many people are in the
[1:14:26] upper
[1:14:27] room thousands of people healed 120 in
[1:14:30] the upper room and those people that he
[1:14:33] healed went and rejected him and
[1:14:35] crucified him why because they were in
[1:14:38] it for their comfort for their ease for
[1:14:40] their health for their emotions whatever
[1:14:42] it was but they weren't in it for
[1:14:44] relationship they weren't in it to be
[1:14:46] right with God they were just in it to
[1:14:48] have an easier life so if we're looking
[1:14:50] to God to do something in this life and
[1:14:52] we're at odds in our soul or our spirit
[1:14:55] I'll say this this morning it's better
[1:14:57] that you ask him to deal with the other
[1:14:59] things than your body than your
[1:15:01] circumstances because he'll allow those
[1:15:02] to go on until we get into line with
[1:15:04] what he wants us to
[1:15:06] do and then when those things are in
[1:15:08] good standing God will jump to our
[1:15:10] circumstances I've me I've mentioned
[1:15:12] this this this scripture many times in
[1:15:14] the past while I want to read it this
[1:15:15] morning John said beloved I wish above
[1:15:18] all things that thou mayest prosper and
[1:15:19] be in health and we all say Amen but he
[1:15:22] says even as thy soul
[1:15:26] prospers listen look what God did to job
[1:15:29] to give him a revelation of a redeemer
[1:15:32] and a life beyond this one he took away
[1:15:34] every
[1:15:36] enjoyable circumstance and wealth from
[1:15:38] his
[1:15:39] life for the sake of his soul for the
[1:15:41] sake of a revelation that would keep job
[1:15:43] going no matter
[1:15:45] what these things are temporal they're
[1:15:48] temporal it's all going to burn it's all
[1:15:50] going to burn that's what God thinks of
[1:15:52] it it's all going to burn at the end but
[1:15:54] what looking for is that soul and that
[1:15:56] Spirit to be changed above all things
[1:15:58] but I like how Jesus did it when he was
[1:16:00] here because he he he reflected it back
[1:16:03] on us see we can say look God wants us
[1:16:06] to be healthy and prosper even as our
[1:16:07] soul prosperous but then Jesus would
[1:16:09] come along and he would say focus on
[1:16:10] your soul focus on the things of God
[1:16:13] focus on the kingdom of God and he'd say
[1:16:16] therefore take no thought saying what
[1:16:17] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[1:16:19] wherewith shall we be wherewith all
[1:16:21] shall we be clothed listen we need
[1:16:23] clothes you can't can't come to church
[1:16:25] if you don't have clothes
[1:16:28] church amen we need it we need a roof
[1:16:31] over our head we need food to eat but he
[1:16:34] says for all these things do the
[1:16:36] Gentiles seek we're Gentiles if you
[1:16:38] didn't know it that's what this world is
[1:16:40] seeking
[1:16:42] after food clothing shelter
[1:16:46] stuff amen things to satisfy this outer
[1:16:50] shell he says for after all these things
[1:16:53] do the Gentiles seek but your heavenly
[1:16:55] or for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:16:57] you have need of these things he's
[1:16:59] saying you don't ignore them at your
[1:17:00] peril you ignore them by faith because
[1:17:04] God knows what you have need of and so
[1:17:06] if we're out there killing ourselves to
[1:17:08] get those things he says you missed the
[1:17:10] mark You're not where you need to be he
[1:17:12] says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:17:15] God what is the kingdom of God the
[1:17:19] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:17:20] observation but it dwells within you the
[1:17:23] kingdom of God is the holy spirit see
[1:17:24] speak first the Holy
[1:17:26] Spirit and he says righteousness what is
[1:17:29] God's righteousness God's Will and God's
[1:17:32] way if you've got the Holy Spirit you
[1:17:35] will eventually seek his will in his way
[1:17:39] because that's what his spirit is there
[1:17:40] to do Jesus said I can do nothing except
[1:17:42] the father shows me the spirit of God
[1:17:44] inside him drove him or caused him to
[1:17:47] seek after God's will he says and if you
[1:17:50] do that all these things shall be added
[1:17:53] unto you now I'm not trying to tell you
[1:17:55] God doesn't care about your health God
[1:17:57] doesn't care about your wealth God
[1:17:59] doesn't care about this flesh God
[1:18:00] doesn't care about our suffering listen
[1:18:02] he took the worst beating a man ever got
[1:18:05] so that we could be healed it matters to
[1:18:07] him but it's the last on his list of
[1:18:10] what matters if I could put it that way
[1:18:12] it's a part of our promise it's a part
[1:18:14] of our inheritance but he wants our soul
[1:18:16] and our spirit to be at Health before he
[1:18:18] moves in those Realms amen we're here on
[1:18:20] this Earth and listen Church we're
[1:18:22] always going to have tough circumstances
[1:18:24] that's the nature of sin that's the
[1:18:26] nature of being in a world that is out
[1:18:28] from under the control or or or
[1:18:30] surrender to God is that things are
[1:18:32] always going to be tough and everything
[1:18:34] in this flesh is temporary listen we can
[1:18:36] get healed today and be sick tomorrow
[1:18:38] and we can live our life in Total Health
[1:18:41] and we're still going to die if God
[1:18:42] terries and the resurrection and the
[1:18:44] Rapture doesn't happen God will allow
[1:18:46] this flesh to experience extreme
[1:18:48] conditions because he's trying to get us
[1:18:49] ready on the inner man to go in a
[1:18:52] resurrection and a Rapture this flesh is
[1:18:54] unredeemable it's unfixable that's where
[1:18:57] the greatest battle is these days isn't
[1:18:58] it it's to bring this flesh subject to
[1:19:01] the word of God it always has been that
[1:19:03] way this flesh is not redeemed it is not
[1:19:06] Sanctified it is lost it is failed and
[1:19:08] it's going to take a glorification to
[1:19:10] make it worth anything what happens is
[1:19:13] our Heavenly has to come down it has to
[1:19:15] swallow up this
[1:19:17] flesh and when it does that then it will
[1:19:20] dissolve everything that Satan ever did
[1:19:21] in this flesh and we'll have a body like
[1:19:24] unto his glory glorious body but that's
[1:19:25] the last thing God does Church why
[1:19:28] because that's the last thing that
[1:19:29] matters the first thing that matters is
[1:19:31] to get this man ready on the inside so
[1:19:33] that the outer man can be changed that's
[1:19:35] what God's trying to do so God has come
[1:19:38] down in many ways and many times with
[1:19:40] differing effect through the Old
[1:19:42] Testament but as we come into him trying
[1:19:44] to change us into a New Testament Church
[1:19:47] God steps into flesh and this is a
[1:19:50] GameChanger because remember God always
[1:19:52] dwelt above us in the pillar of Fire
[1:19:55] he was Untouchable unattainable you
[1:19:57] couldn't look at
[1:19:59] him face to face you couldn't Moses saw
[1:20:02] the back part of a man and just that
[1:20:04] seeing the back side of God put a glow
[1:20:06] on his face that required him to wear a
[1:20:09] veil but now God steps into flesh and he
[1:20:12] didn't just come down Church to have
[1:20:13] some a new experience he didn't come
[1:20:16] down for a thrill or because he was
[1:20:17] bored remember God condescends with
[1:20:20] purpose he's coming down with purpose
[1:20:23] and so he's revealing now as he comes
[1:20:25] down and steps into Christ he's
[1:20:27] revealing his name he's revealing his
[1:20:30] image he's revealing his purpose his
[1:20:33] identity and so he's coming down with a
[1:20:36] particular intention in mind and look at
[1:20:38] what Paul would say now is looking back
[1:20:40] after all these things that happened he
[1:20:42] says now I say that the heir as long as
[1:20:44] he is a child differeth nothing from a
[1:20:46] servant though he be a Lord of all but
[1:20:49] is under tutors and governors until the
[1:20:51] time appointed of the father even so we
[1:20:55] when we were children were in bondage
[1:20:57] under the elements of the world but when
[1:20:59] the fullness of time was come church we
[1:21:03] were in the same circumstances for 6,000
[1:21:05] years he did not come down because of
[1:21:08] our circumstances but when the fullness
[1:21:10] of time was come in other words when God
[1:21:12] said now's time that's when God did it
[1:21:15] we're going to see how critical this is
[1:21:16] when we get to Revelation
[1:21:18] 10 when you get to Revelation 10 and God
[1:21:21] steps down again he says what
[1:21:25] what's he saying in Revelation 10 time
[1:21:27] should be no more God comes down and he
[1:21:31] says it's time for a change in the
[1:21:34] fullness of time God determines that God
[1:21:38] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:21:41] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:21:43] under the law that we might receive the
[1:21:46] adoption of sons so under the law you
[1:21:49] could not come into what God had for you
[1:21:52] Amen in other words as Christ has come
[1:21:54] and he's born in flesh he was born
[1:21:56] through a woman but he was not born by a
[1:21:58] woman he was born by the spirit he was a
[1:22:01] spoken word Son of God he was not born
[1:22:04] by man's desire he was born under the
[1:22:06] law Paul said he was born under the
[1:22:09] original Covenant in other words Christ
[1:22:11] was born into the same circumstances
[1:22:13] that we all deal with he wasn't born
[1:22:15] into a perfect situation a perfect world
[1:22:17] he was born into a perverted Fallen
[1:22:19] religious
[1:22:21] world and in that he had to come into
[1:22:23] perfection
[1:22:25] he didn't get an easy Road from his
[1:22:28] birth which was under a shadow of being
[1:22:30] illegitimate all the way through his
[1:22:32] life he was under a cloud of people
[1:22:34] thinking that he was something different
[1:22:35] than what he
[1:22:36] was he was born into the same Pig pin
[1:22:39] than you and I were born into and he had
[1:22:41] to live by the same rules that they did
[1:22:42] under the law he was held accountable to
[1:22:44] the same things they were held
[1:22:45] accountable to amen and he if he did his
[1:22:48] work properly under that law then he
[1:22:51] could redeem us that was a requirement
[1:22:54] now we're speaking of the condescending
[1:22:56] God this morning and like I said God
[1:22:58] always comes with purpose and the big
[1:23:00] purpose Paul tells us and we certainly
[1:23:03] would know this today is to redeem us
[1:23:05] that is what God's been trying to do
[1:23:07] this entire book of the Bible is a book
[1:23:09] of redemption is to bring us back to our
[1:23:12] original condition our original position
[1:23:15] our original relationship our our
[1:23:17] original Authority and power our
[1:23:19] original purpose it's to bring us back
[1:23:22] to our original estate amen it's not a
[1:23:25] finished work when Christ came down but
[1:23:27] it's the finishing of the first part
[1:23:29] that he could start the real work after
[1:23:31] that amen so God living in human flesh
[1:23:34] tells us why he came watch what Jesus
[1:23:37] says because Jesus would share his
[1:23:39] purpose so many times in different ways
[1:23:41] he says think not that I am come to
[1:23:43] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[1:23:46] come to destroy but to fulfill then he
[1:23:50] jumps down and and he he says these
[1:23:53] words and church I want this to be
[1:23:54] encouragement to you this morning for I
[1:23:56] say unto you that except your
[1:23:58] righteousness shall exceed the
[1:23:59] righteousness of the scribes and the
[1:24:01] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[1:24:04] into the Kingdom of Heaven see the
[1:24:06] priesthood in that day it was all about
[1:24:08] image it was all about representation it
[1:24:11] was all about your reput your reputation
[1:24:14] and so they gave off this Aura they gave
[1:24:16] off this idea that they were perfect
[1:24:18] that they didn't sin Jesus said you
[1:24:20] tithe of your mint and cumin you get a
[1:24:22] little sprig of it and you cut off a
[1:24:24] then you give it to the
[1:24:26] temple they they they they followed the
[1:24:29] 613 laws that they had to the end
[1:24:33] degree
[1:24:36] apparently
[1:24:37] apparently amen can I preach this
[1:24:40] morning your appearance is not what's
[1:24:43] going to get you in there because he
[1:24:45] says unless your righteousness exceeds
[1:24:49] what you think is the best of the best
[1:24:51] here you'll never get into the kingdom
[1:24:53] of heaven church you can sit here this
[1:24:55] morning and you can say I'm not like
[1:24:56] brother so- and so I'm not like sister
[1:24:58] so and so you can have a complex about
[1:25:00] your lack of Works about where you're at
[1:25:03] in your life let me tell you this
[1:25:04] morning it doesn't matter whose standard
[1:25:06] you hold up if you think you're worse
[1:25:09] than them it doesn't matter because
[1:25:11] they're not getting in on their works
[1:25:13] anyways it's not by works we're getting
[1:25:15] in it's by Grace but don't use that as a
[1:25:19] license for
[1:25:22] disgrace remember what scripture says
[1:25:23] provoke spoke one another
[1:25:25] to Good
[1:25:27] Works we ought to hold each other
[1:25:30] accountable we ought to be able to say
[1:25:31] to one another hey I don't think you
[1:25:33] should be doing that I don't think
[1:25:35] that's the best decision I don't believe
[1:25:36] that's the way that the word wants us to
[1:25:38] live our lives we should be able to do
[1:25:39] that amen but we're not getting it done
[1:25:42] by works we're not getting into Heaven
[1:25:44] by works don't stop working but don't
[1:25:46] rest on those
[1:25:48] Works don't rest on your reputation cuz
[1:25:51] compared to Christ's reputation ours is
[1:25:54] as filthy
[1:25:55] rags the best of the best of the best of
[1:25:58] us is as filthy rags Paul said that's
[1:26:00] what our righteousness is so how are we
[1:26:02] going to get it done the only way we're
[1:26:05] going to get it done is when the I am
[1:26:07] says I will and we accept
[1:26:09] it when the Everlasting everpresent God
[1:26:13] comes down in the fullness of time for
[1:26:15] your life and says I'm going to do a
[1:26:17] work and we say yay Lord be it unto me
[1:26:19] according to your word we accept what he
[1:26:22] did at Calvary the finished absolute
[1:26:26] atonement the the work of Calvary is how
[1:26:28] I'm getting into heaven it's the work
[1:26:30] that he did not the work that I'm going
[1:26:32] to do he was Perfection he is perfection
[1:26:36] that's how I'm getting in is on his
[1:26:39] works not on mine God said this is my
[1:26:43] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:26:45] that's the only one that ever got
[1:26:49] that in flesh up to that point and that
[1:26:53] was before he ever got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] and became God
[1:26:56] incarnate he said in his flesh I'm
[1:27:00] pleased remember Jesus was the same as
[1:27:02] Adam he's a word born son of God and he
[1:27:06] lived a perfect life and then the
[1:27:07] scripture dwells the scripture says that
[1:27:09] the spirit of God came and dwelt in him
[1:27:11] and that's when he became the fullness
[1:27:13] of God in a body he had every attribute
[1:27:16] he had every Power he had every element
[1:27:18] of God inside of him without
[1:27:21] limitation everything that God was he
[1:27:23] poured into that body of Jesus Christ
[1:27:26] every aspect of him God condescended to
[1:27:30] live in human flesh for the first time
[1:27:32] that's what he did watch now as Jesus
[1:27:35] talks about his purpose on Earth we're
[1:27:37] not going to finish our thought today
[1:27:38] but we'll set it foundation for
[1:27:40] Wednesday night Jesus says I came to
[1:27:43] fulfill the law see the law was a
[1:27:46] contract the law was just a
[1:27:49] placeholder it was not Perfection it
[1:27:51] could not perfect us what it did was it
[1:27:53] kept people busy until God could come
[1:27:55] and do a real Work If we're honest with
[1:27:58] it all it did was kept us temporarily
[1:28:00] from
[1:28:02] judgment year after year if we did what
[1:28:04] he told us then he would hold back
[1:28:05] judgment but it couldn't change us at
[1:28:07] all and that's why it was only a
[1:28:09] placeholder the law was a covenant of
[1:28:12] Works God said if you do this then I
[1:28:15] will do this or I won't do that as the
[1:28:18] case may be if you will sacrifice a lamb
[1:28:20] every year then I will cover your sins
[1:28:22] for a year
[1:28:24] if you will uh stay away for a week
[1:28:27] after you touch a dead body then you're
[1:28:29] allowed to come back into the temple and
[1:28:31] if you'll do this then I'll do that and
[1:28:32] if you'll do this then I'll do that and
[1:28:34] it was a covenant of works and it was
[1:28:36] just a temporary placeholder until
[1:28:38] Christ could come amen but it could
[1:28:40] never bring us Perfection all it could
[1:28:42] bring was condemnation if we were honest
[1:28:44] with ourselves all it could bring was
[1:28:46] condemnation it could not bring us into
[1:28:48] the presence of God it couldn't make us
[1:28:50] feel good because knowing in our own
[1:28:53] conscience and in our mind I still
[1:28:55] messed up today listen I might go
[1:28:57] through a day by God's grace where
[1:28:59] nobody in my family thinks I made a
[1:29:01] mistake probably not because they're
[1:29:03] eagle-eyed and Eagle eared but maybe
[1:29:06] there'll be a day where they say boy dad
[1:29:08] did pretty good today I didn't see him
[1:29:09] do anything wrong and yet I did
[1:29:10] something wrong I guarantee
[1:29:12] you right the law of Works only brings
[1:29:16] condemnation so God's got to get us out
[1:29:18] of works and get us into something else
[1:29:22] and that's what he's coming down to do
[1:29:24] and the only way for that law to be set
[1:29:26] aside was for the law to be fulfilled
[1:29:29] see when we sign a contract today it's
[1:29:31] between at least two parties and they
[1:29:33] say if you do this then I will do that
[1:29:35] if you will give me this car then I will
[1:29:37] give you this money and when they give
[1:29:39] us the car and I give them the money the
[1:29:41] contract is fulfilled the Covenant is
[1:29:43] fulfilled but under this one the
[1:29:45] requirement was that to fulfill the law
[1:29:48] you had to do two things you had to meet
[1:29:50] every requirement you had to live a life
[1:29:53] of sinless Perfection and then if you
[1:29:56] did that and God acknowledged it then
[1:29:59] you had to willingly lay down your life
[1:30:01] as a blood sacrifice for every other
[1:30:03] person that couldn't do it cuz remember
[1:30:06] under the law the sacrifices were
[1:30:08] animals it was the blood of animals and
[1:30:10] that blood the life of that blood
[1:30:12] couldn't come back and it would take the
[1:30:14] life of the blood of a human a perfect
[1:30:17] one to come back on us to bring us into
[1:30:20] Perfection so God stepping down into FLH
[1:30:24] God condescending into flesh to live
[1:30:26] perfectly and give his life is the
[1:30:29] greatest work of Grace you'll ever
[1:30:31] find God came down and he allowed his
[1:30:34] word perfect body to be ripped to shreds
[1:30:38] more mangled more destroyed than any
[1:30:40] other person in history so that you and
[1:30:43] I could come back to him that's what he
[1:30:45] did church God loves us so much that he
[1:30:48] came down to fulfill his own
[1:30:52] contract can you imagine if I went into
[1:30:54] a dealership and I signed a contract
[1:30:56] that if they if if they would give me a
[1:30:59] brand new uh Honda Odyssey that I would
[1:31:01] give them the $60,000 they want and I
[1:31:04] come in and I take that van and then
[1:31:05] they say by the way we'll pay your van
[1:31:07] for you they won't even do that for 60
[1:31:11] Grand and yet God comes down Steps From
[1:31:14] the portals of Glory from his Perfection
[1:31:16] his Holiness he comes down to where they
[1:31:18] will spit on him where they will beat
[1:31:20] him they will reject him they will mock
[1:31:22] him they will tell lies about him him
[1:31:24] they'll besmer his reputation they will
[1:31:27] reject him in every possible way and he
[1:31:29] says I'll give you my life I'll let you
[1:31:33] destroy who I am for your
[1:31:35] sake listen to this he says God
[1:31:38] manifested in the pillar of fire god
[1:31:40] manifested in the son and now God
[1:31:43] manifested in you he says the same holy
[1:31:46] spirit that was the dispensation of the
[1:31:47] fatherhood Jesus was the dispensation of
[1:31:50] the F of the sunship and this is the
[1:31:52] dispensation of the the Holy Spirit
[1:31:54] that's the reason we are commissioned to
[1:31:56] baptize you in the name of the father
[1:31:58] Son and Holy Ghost watch how he explains
[1:32:01] this now we don't baptize in titles
[1:32:03] because titles are not a name he says he
[1:32:07] why do we do this it's showing that God
[1:32:09] has unfolded
[1:32:11] himself condescended coming down and
[1:32:15] working his way through notice this
[1:32:17] Redemption process is also a process of
[1:32:19] revealing God he says it started with
[1:32:22] God above us as the father father in the
[1:32:24] pillar of fire he was working through
[1:32:26] the law then he comes down as God With
[1:32:28] Us Christ in flesh God and morphate in
[1:32:31] flesh and through that he does the work
[1:32:34] of Calvary and then the process
[1:32:36] continues with God in us Christ in you
[1:32:38] the hope of glory the Holy Spirit but
[1:32:41] it's still one and the same God from
[1:32:43] start to finish and it's all part of
[1:32:45] this Redemption process and then he says
[1:32:48] these beautiful words he says working
[1:32:50] his way
[1:32:51] through working his way through there's
[1:32:53] a a process going on there are phases
[1:32:56] going
[1:32:57] on it's not just one and done but
[1:32:59] there's this whole thing that's being
[1:33:00] unraveled and shown to us
[1:33:03] amen he says he couldn't enter into sin
[1:33:07] church that ought to make a shout this
[1:33:09] morning because if he couldn't enter
[1:33:11] into sin and he's entered into you by
[1:33:13] the holy spirit this morning what does
[1:33:15] that tell you about where you are this
[1:33:16] morning it tells you that there is no
[1:33:19] sin attributed to you it means that you
[1:33:21] are perfect that you are righteous that
[1:33:23] you are accepted in the Beloved if you
[1:33:27] have truly received the Holy Spirit this
[1:33:29] morning there is nothing that can stand
[1:33:31] before God and accuse you you stand
[1:33:35] perfect Hallelujah you stand perfect
[1:33:38] this morning if he has stepped into you
[1:33:42] it is his approval that matters and he
[1:33:44] says you are perfect you are blameless
[1:33:46] you are spotless you are sinless you are
[1:33:50] me and I am you
[1:33:55] praise the Lord that means you're a new
[1:33:58] creation it's not Jonathan klet anymore
[1:34:01] it's a Son of God it's a daughter of God
[1:34:03] that stands before him this morning he
[1:34:05] says he couldn't enter sin but he
[1:34:07] cleared his way as he
[1:34:10] went sometimes we're trying to jump to
[1:34:12] the end Church let's take it one day at
[1:34:15] a time let's take it one step at a time
[1:34:18] sufficient to the day is the evil
[1:34:20] thereof let's not look to tomorrow let's
[1:34:22] deal with today
[1:34:24] and have faith for today for God so
[1:34:27] loved man that he wants to come down and
[1:34:28] fellowship with him God tonight the same
[1:34:31] Jehovah God that spoke to Adam and Eve
[1:34:33] in the Garden of Eden lives in every
[1:34:36] born again man or woman trying his best
[1:34:38] to make you believe him he says have
[1:34:41] faith in him step out don't you doubt
[1:34:43] one bit he says but the same God that
[1:34:46] was with Abraham is the same God that is
[1:34:48] tonight he said it might make me act
[1:34:50] funny and be be a crazy man by this
[1:34:52] world but I cannot deny him who did so
[1:34:55] much for me he took my place in death he
[1:34:58] took my place at Calvary he did all
[1:35:00] these things he condescended from heaven
[1:35:03] from the pearly white Thrones to become
[1:35:05] a man catch this to taste my
[1:35:09] suffering to go through my temptation to
[1:35:13] know how to be the right kind of a
[1:35:15] mediator in me to lead me and guide me
[1:35:18] to eternal life and through his poverty
[1:35:24] I am made Rich Hallelujah through his
[1:35:27] poverty he emptied out his treasures and
[1:35:30] gave them to
[1:35:32] me through his death I am given life
[1:35:37] eternal life
[1:35:39] Hallelujah why did God
[1:35:42] condescend and dwell in
[1:35:45] Christ it's all tied to that great work
[1:35:47] of redemption but we see it's in
[1:35:49] phases and each phase has its own Works
[1:35:53] see some sometimes God comes down to
[1:35:55] start a work sometimes God comes down to
[1:35:58] finish a work and then sometimes God
[1:36:01] comes down to continue a work and then
[1:36:04] there's the final completion of it all
[1:36:06] at the
[1:36:07] end see it's All Phases and if we in our
[1:36:10] Humanity what happens is we get so
[1:36:12] frustrated in the phases because we know
[1:36:14] what's coming we know what's supposed to
[1:36:17] happen and we're trying to jump phases
[1:36:19] and God's saying if you'll just let me
[1:36:21] work my way through it in you you'll
[1:36:23] have so much more peace and rest in this
[1:36:25] situation let me work through it with
[1:36:28] you because I'm trying to get the inner
[1:36:29] man ready to go not just the outer
[1:36:33] man watch what Jesus says oh I love
[1:36:36] this he says the thief cometh not but
[1:36:39] for to steal and to kill and to destroy
[1:36:43] he says I am come that they might have
[1:36:45] life and that they might have it more
[1:36:48] abundantly why did God condescend in
[1:36:50] Christ that we might have life
[1:36:54] this isn't just be alive life this isn't
[1:36:56] just have breath life this is Zoey life
[1:37:00] this is God's Own Life Church I started
[1:37:02] crying when I read this yesterday
[1:37:04] because so often we're coming down and
[1:37:06] we're saying Lord I need this Lord I
[1:37:08] want this Lord I have need of this Lord
[1:37:10] show me this Lord show me that and he's
[1:37:11] saying if you only understood how much
[1:37:14] you're undercutting what I have for you
[1:37:16] because you're so limited by this
[1:37:17] fleshly needs that you're forgetting
[1:37:19] there's a Life Source inside of you that
[1:37:21] if you could just get those channels
[1:37:23] cleaned out I'd step in in a way you've
[1:37:25] never experienced
[1:37:27] before see we're so Bound by our
[1:37:29] stinking thinking we're so Bound by what
[1:37:32] this world is embedded in our lives that
[1:37:35] it inhibits the spirit of God inside of
[1:37:37] us from doing what it's supposed to be
[1:37:39] doing he didn't come so we could have
[1:37:41] our way we came so he could have his way
[1:37:43] he didn't come so we could have our
[1:37:44] thoughts he came so we could have his
[1:37:46] thoughts he didn't come so we could have
[1:37:48] our satisfaction so that we could have
[1:37:50] his satisfaction
[1:37:55] more
[1:37:56] abundantly pressed down shaken together
[1:37:59] and still pouring out church I want life
[1:38:02] more abundantly this morning I say Lord
[1:38:05] lift me up to a higher plane where I can
[1:38:07] let go of what this man wants this
[1:38:09] thinking that so failed and come to a
[1:38:12] place where the spirit of God could have
[1:38:13] its way in my life where I could
[1:38:15] surrender even my very situations my
[1:38:18] very hardships and say Lord have your
[1:38:20] way in my life Lord do what you're
[1:38:23] trying to do and help me to have a right
[1:38:25] attitude towards it help me to have a
[1:38:27] right Spirit towards it and don't let me
[1:38:29] get
[1:38:30] bitter let me trust
[1:38:32] you oh he didn't come so we could just
[1:38:35] have a little bit of
[1:38:36] Life see I said before we all have a
[1:38:39] portion of him but that portion is still
[1:38:42] more abundantly Hallelujah more
[1:38:44] abundantly there's more than enough to
[1:38:46] go around that's yeah there's that old
[1:38:48] song they sing I'm drinking from my
[1:38:50] saucer cuz my cup is overflowed
[1:38:53] see we don't tend to drink saucers and
[1:38:55] cups anymore do we we just have our tea
[1:38:57] in a cup but the old way the the the the
[1:39:00] the high futin way was you had your
[1:39:03] teacup in a
[1:39:04] saucer and that was there to catch the
[1:39:06] drips but see life abundantly is the tea
[1:39:09] is overflowed the cup and now you're
[1:39:11] drinking from the
[1:39:12] saucer Hallelujah that's what his offer
[1:39:15] is church God wants you to have his life
[1:39:18] more than you wanted God wants to bless
[1:39:21] you more than you want to be blessed but
[1:39:22] he's doing it in phases and ways and
[1:39:25] plans according to his desire and his
[1:39:27] Sovereign will not ours and what we do
[1:39:30] is we limit him by trying to Define what
[1:39:33] he's supposed to do to bless us to work
[1:39:35] in our lives in a particular
[1:39:38] Way Church I want something that raises
[1:39:40] me above those clouds of Life the storms
[1:39:43] the noise isn't the noise starting to
[1:39:46] get really really loud i' say you can't
[1:39:49] every time I turn on the news I think I
[1:39:51] should never have done that
[1:39:54] I'll be honest you know when I drive
[1:39:56] into the office or something I'll turn
[1:39:57] on CBC in the morning every time I I I
[1:40:00] say why did I do that I never learn I
[1:40:03] never
[1:40:04] learn trying to catch up on things you
[1:40:06] know I never learned there's never
[1:40:07] anything that's that's good or unbiased
[1:40:09] or
[1:40:10] clean it's a mess it's a mess it's a
[1:40:13] mess and it it embeds into our life
[1:40:16] amen but if we'll let that Abundant Life
[1:40:19] flow out of the Soul
[1:40:24] but we've got to be in the right
[1:40:26] place remember what brother Mark was
[1:40:28] talking about there when he took this
[1:40:29] service a few weeks or months ago he
[1:40:32] said how does God use you keep your life
[1:40:36] clean keep the junk out that's what
[1:40:38] clogs up the channels What influences
[1:40:41] are you under this
[1:40:43] morning listen your soul can be sealed
[1:40:45] but your spirit can be affected by many
[1:40:47] things and this flesh can absolutely be
[1:40:50] affected what is it that's clogging the
[1:40:52] channels up that life abundantly isn't
[1:40:54] flowing it's not God it's not God that's
[1:40:57] doing
[1:41:00] it Jesus said this I am come a light
[1:41:03] into the world that whosoever believeth
[1:41:06] in me should not abide in darkness and
[1:41:09] if any man hear my words and believe not
[1:41:11] I judge him not for I came not to judge
[1:41:13] the world but to save the
[1:41:16] world now that's that the bride's
[1:41:19] message has always come we see that in
[1:41:22] Revelation the spirit and the bride say
[1:41:24] come the message is come on get in but
[1:41:28] there's a judgment coming at the end of
[1:41:29] it all church but he says until that
[1:41:32] time the doors open I don't want you to
[1:41:35] live in Shadows and darkness I don't
[1:41:37] want you to live a life where you don't
[1:41:38] understand what's going on I don't want
[1:41:40] you to live a life where you don't know
[1:41:42] why you're
[1:41:44] here I want you saved
[1:41:48] secure
[1:41:50] amen not just a temporary
[1:41:55] effect when Christ saves it's not saved
[1:41:58] today lost
[1:41:59] tomorrow
[1:42:02] amen it's not in today out tomorrow it's
[1:42:05] not up today down
[1:42:06] tomorrow scripture says he saves us to
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] uttermost you know what the uttermost
[1:42:13] means all the way to the
[1:42:15] end one saved always saved I believe
[1:42:19] that doesn't mean we don't have our ups
[1:42:21] and downs I'm not trying to say we don't
[1:42:24] but he says you don't have to you don't
[1:42:26] have to be there you don't have to be in
[1:42:29] that place of up and down saved secure
[1:42:34] resting that's what he's
[1:42:37] offering he says in first John he that
[1:42:40] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:42:42] devil sinth from the beginning and for
[1:42:44] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:42:46] manifested this is why Christ came that
[1:42:48] he might destroy the works of the devil
[1:42:53] I like that summary and this is where
[1:42:54] we're going to close this morning God
[1:42:56] condescended into human flesh in Christ
[1:42:59] Jesus so he could destroy the works so
[1:43:01] he could do every undo every effect that
[1:43:05] Satan has had on this
[1:43:08] Earth he came to undo it he came to make
[1:43:11] it as if it never happened but that word
[1:43:14] destroy there is is a bit different than
[1:43:16] what we would think it doesn't mean
[1:43:18] destruction as we would think of it
[1:43:20] means to loose
[1:43:23] it means to set free it means to
[1:43:26] dissolve it means to make it as if it as
[1:43:28] if it never happened in the first place
[1:43:31] Christ came to set his children
[1:43:34] free to live in Liberty as we preached
[1:43:37] last service he came to set his children
[1:43:39] free he came to turn the tables on the
[1:43:41] devil you know one of the first things
[1:43:44] that he did was he set Mary Magdalene
[1:43:45] free she had seven Demons Inside Of
[1:43:49] Her Seven demons and he went and he set
[1:43:52] her free to serve him and she went all
[1:43:54] the way up to that day on Pentecost what
[1:43:56] does he do he comes to the woman at the
[1:43:59] well does he change her circumstances
[1:44:02] Church no he answers the questions she's
[1:44:06] had all of her life and what does it do
[1:44:08] it Sparks something to life inside of
[1:44:11] her she went
[1:44:13] home and she still had a common law
[1:44:15] husband now I believe with all my heart
[1:44:17] she got rid of
[1:44:19] him but he changed her he set her free
[1:44:23] to worship he set her free to praise he
[1:44:26] set her free from everything that
[1:44:28] Society had dumped on her he set her
[1:44:30] free from her own decisions even and he
[1:44:33] set her free and remember what we said
[1:44:34] last time if your son sets you free
[1:44:36] you'll be free indeed I say it this
[1:44:38] morning once free always free when he
[1:44:40] does it it's a finished work that's why
[1:44:43] he came down was to break every chain to
[1:44:46] loose every shackle to heal every
[1:44:48] disease to break every
[1:44:51] oppression but it's starts with the
[1:44:53] inner
[1:44:54] man first thing I've got to be set free
[1:44:56] from is myself that's the biggest thing
[1:44:58] that he's got to do in this
[1:45:00] life everything else will fall in line
[1:45:02] after
[1:45:03] that he said Jesus came to destroy the
[1:45:06] works of the devil that's why God was
[1:45:08] made both soul and body Jesus had both
[1:45:11] soul and body and yet was God he said he
[1:45:13] came to take on himself the full form of
[1:45:17] man to redeem the full form of man back
[1:45:21] to God that's why he came in flesh and
[1:45:24] in Soul that's the reason Jesus could
[1:45:26] say it's not me that doth the works it's
[1:45:28] my father that dwelleth in me notice
[1:45:30] what he's saying the full form Body Soul
[1:45:33] Spirit remember he's come to destroy the
[1:45:36] works of the devil Church he's not going
[1:45:38] to leave anything untouched he's not
[1:45:40] going to leave anything behind he's not
[1:45:42] going to leave anything unresolved every
[1:45:45] single aspect of this Redemption is
[1:45:47] perfect it's complete and it's absolute
[1:45:50] amen listen you may go into a rapture
[1:45:53] sick I don't believe it I believe that
[1:45:55] if we're going into rapturing Faith then
[1:45:57] we're going to have healing Faith but
[1:45:59] you may be sick on that day of the
[1:46:00] Rapture but as that body change happens
[1:46:03] Hallelujah that sickness will lose its
[1:46:05] hold and not only that sickness death
[1:46:08] itself will pull its thing out and you
[1:46:10] will realize once and forever you're
[1:46:12] you're healed you're set free cuz in
[1:46:16] this flesh dwells no good thing it's
[1:46:19] always going to be problems even to the
[1:46:22] end it it'll be a
[1:46:23] battle even to the end it'll be a battle
[1:46:26] but as we rise Hallelujah As We rise
[1:46:30] that last thing will be changed and now
[1:46:32] we're in Perfection that's it Body Soul
[1:46:37] and Spirit the full form of man redeemed
[1:46:40] back he doesn't leave anything alone
[1:46:42] church I'm so glad he'll undo it as if
[1:46:46] it never happen he'll perfect Us by his
[1:46:48] Spirit by his word he'll lead us by his
[1:46:50] Spirit he'll get us off of Satan's
[1:46:52] gospel get us on his gospel he'll get us
[1:46:54] off of our leadership and the world's
[1:46:56] leadership into his leadership that's
[1:46:57] the battle we're in today take God at
[1:46:59] his word and let him lead that's it it's
[1:47:02] a battle for our minds it's a battle for
[1:47:04] control of our decisions the way that we
[1:47:06] live and we walk and do things day by
[1:47:08] day as we start to close I want you to
[1:47:12] see what this is going to look like as
[1:47:13] we set a foundation for next service he
[1:47:15] says behold what manner of love the
[1:47:18] father had bestowed upon us that we
[1:47:20] should be called the sons of God
[1:47:22] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:47:24] because it knew him knew him not now
[1:47:26] catch verse two this is so beautiful
[1:47:29] beloved soon we are the sons of God in
[1:47:33] the future we will be the sons of God no
[1:47:37] now now are we the sons of God that's
[1:47:40] our position okay never confuse your
[1:47:44] position with your
[1:47:46] circumstances okay now are we the sons
[1:47:50] of God he says and it does not yet
[1:47:52] appear we shall be see sometimes it's
[1:47:54] hard to believe we're a child of God
[1:47:56] because we look in our flesh we look at
[1:47:58] our struggles and we say how can I be a
[1:48:00] child of
[1:48:02] God but Paul says it clearly we are now
[1:48:05] sons of God we are now children of God
[1:48:08] our condition may not match our position
[1:48:10] but it doesn't change our position and
[1:48:13] because our position cannot be changed
[1:48:15] we've got a work that's going on by the
[1:48:18] word of
[1:48:19] God that's why we need Redemption to
[1:48:21] make our condition match our position
[1:48:24] that's what Redemption is he says we
[1:48:28] doesn't appear we shall be in other
[1:48:29] words we're not in our final form yet he
[1:48:32] says but we know that when he shall
[1:48:34] appear
[1:48:37] we
[1:48:39] shall see in legal terms shell is an
[1:48:44] absolute it's certainty there's no
[1:48:46] wiggle room in
[1:48:48] Shell if the law says you shall stop at
[1:48:51] every stop sign
[1:48:53] there is no wiggle room there to roll
[1:48:55] through to occasionally blow through a
[1:48:57] stop sign shall is an absolute and God
[1:49:00] saying we shall be like
[1:49:04] him you can take that to the bank that's
[1:49:08] a that that's God's covenant to you we
[1:49:10] shall be like him he says for we shall
[1:49:14] see him as he is I want to ask you a
[1:49:17] question before we read this last verse
[1:49:19] how good a job is God going to do
[1:49:25] how good is a job is God going to do
[1:49:27] listen if he is the Eternal all powerful
[1:49:30] all knowing god that cannot disobey his
[1:49:33] own word how good a job is God going to
[1:49:41] do sometimes we're limited by our own
[1:49:43] thinking you can't change me this is too
[1:49:46] embedded I've been fighting it too long
[1:49:48] been dealing with it too long still
[1:49:51] haven't got the victory prayed and
[1:49:53] prayed and prayed still haven't got the
[1:49:56] victory does God do incomplete
[1:50:00] works let me show you give you some
[1:50:03] insight into the kind of work that God
[1:50:05] does verse 9 says whosoever is born of
[1:50:10] God does not commit
[1:50:15] sin that's the kind of work God
[1:50:20] does he says for his seed
[1:50:23] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:50:26] because he is born of God the job that
[1:50:30] God does is so good so complete that
[1:50:33] Satan has nothing to use against us
[1:50:37] there is no sin found in
[1:50:41] you that's the kind of work God does
[1:50:45] Perfection the same Perfection of
[1:50:48] Christ that's what he's talking about
[1:50:51] here God has
[1:50:53] condescended to give us his own
[1:50:57] Perfection that's what he's doing
[1:51:00] bringing us back into himself amen God
[1:51:04] has condescended to destroy everything
[1:51:07] that Satan has laid on
[1:51:09] us 6,000 years of Satan
[1:51:13] working and there'll be a day where in a
[1:51:15] moment in a twinkling of an
[1:51:18] eye
[1:51:20] done that's it
[1:51:22] and When God says it's done it's done
[1:51:25] and Satan can't do a thing about it
[1:51:27] that's the kind of work God does amen
[1:51:29] God bless you let's stand this
[1:51:32] morning the whole purpose of God coming
[1:51:35] down is restoration it's to bring us
[1:51:38] back to our original
[1:51:42] condition our original
[1:51:45] position but it's God's work as we spoke
[1:51:48] of last service this is God doing this
[1:51:50] it's not mine it's not yours yes God
[1:51:52] uses people but I'm not going to change
[1:51:54] myself that's for sure takes God inside
[1:51:56] of us to do it it's the person of God
[1:51:59] living inside of us that changes
[1:52:00] everything Israel had signs and wonders
[1:52:03] for 40 years in the desert and it didn't
[1:52:04] change a
[1:52:06] person God had to change from just being
[1:52:08] with us to being in
[1:52:09] us and when he condescends CU he was
[1:52:13] above us in that Pillar of Fire then he
[1:52:14] came down in Christ but remember now he
[1:52:17] condescends to you and I and that's the
[1:52:19] greatest
[1:52:20] condescension when he's in the pillar of
[1:52:22] fire that's of his own making and
[1:52:23] Perfection Christ is the perfect body
[1:52:26] but now he condescends to dwell in
[1:52:28] sinful
[1:52:29] flesh and that's the greatest
[1:52:31] condescension you can see is when
[1:52:32] something that is greater than you dains
[1:52:35] to come down and say I'll live in you
[1:52:37] and I'll change you and I'll bring you
[1:52:38] into a place of overcoming power amen
[1:52:41] that's the condescending God Amen God
[1:52:44] bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly
