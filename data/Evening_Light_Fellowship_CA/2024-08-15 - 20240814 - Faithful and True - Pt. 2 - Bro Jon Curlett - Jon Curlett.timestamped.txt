[49:33] scared that she was leaving and she said
[49:35] no I'm not and then they're watching the
[49:37] service and he was crying because he's
[49:39] not at church
[49:40] so you can't win amen so anyway Samuel
[49:44] God bless you amen just trusting that
[49:47] they'll be all better soon and Selena as
[49:49] well Hebrews 10: 19 says this having
[49:53] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[49:55] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[49:58] by a New and Living Way which he had con
[50:01] consecrated for us through the veil that
[50:03] is to say his flesh and having an high
[50:05] priest over the house of God let us draw
[50:08] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[50:12] of Faith having our hearts sprinkled
[50:15] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[50:17] washed with pure water in other words if
[50:19] God has done a work in your life that
[50:21] ought to give you confidence to come to
[50:23] him and expect him to finish the work
[50:26] amen if we've had our our our minds
[50:28] changed if we've had our lives changed
[50:30] if we've got a a heart that's inclined
[50:32] towards him we ought to have some
[50:34] confidence now that he's a God that's
[50:35] going to finish the work he says if
[50:37] we've had all these things he says let
[50:39] us hold fast the profession of our faith
[50:42] without wavering why because for he is
[50:46] faithful that promised amen God bless
[50:49] you this evening and as you might
[50:51] imagine we're going to take a second
[50:52] service a final service on this thought
[50:54] of faithful and true and and I want to
[50:57] start us with a conversation on The
[50:59] Impossible on the impossible
[51:00] circumstances I want to talk about
[51:02] things that can happen I want to talk
[51:04] about diseases that can't be healed I
[51:06] want to talk about situations that are
[51:08] so twisted up that none of us can
[51:10] unravel them I want to talk about people
[51:12] that are so far in sin so broken that we
[51:15] think there's nothing can ever restore
[51:17] them I want to talk about doors that
[51:19] could never be opened I want to talk
[51:21] about lives that could never be changed
[51:23] this morning because if we can't believe
[51:25] for those how are we ever going to
[51:27] believe to get out of here in a
[51:28] resurrection or Rapture amen but things
[51:30] that we write off as
[51:31] impossible is just the place that God
[51:34] dwells God dwells in the impossible
[51:36] we'll see as we go through this that is
[51:38] that that God is comfortable in the
[51:40] things that we call impossible because
[51:42] for him all things are easy there's
[51:44] nothing that's difficult for him amen
[51:46] but I I want to start with what I
[51:49] consider the greatest impossibility that
[51:51] we could think of physically because so
[51:53] often that's where our faith is first
[51:54] proven is in this Physical Realm we're
[51:56] in in the in the bodies that we're in in
[51:58] the lives that we're living and the
[52:00] greatest impossibility I know is a
[52:02] paradox and that's when something is
[52:04] going to be done that is against the
[52:06] very definition of what it is and there
[52:09] the greatest Paradox that we see in
[52:10] scripture this is my opinion this is
[52:12] Brother John is in Isaiah 7:14 that says
[52:15] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[52:17] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[52:20] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[52:24] his name Emmanuel anden the idea of a
[52:27] virgin producing a son is a paradox
[52:29] because it contradicts what a virgin is
[52:31] which is somebody who has never known
[52:33] physical intimacy with another person it
[52:36] says somebody that has never done the
[52:38] act of producing life will produce life
[52:42] and this is the promise for the Messiah
[52:44] coming and it's just one scripture that
[52:46] shows how he's going to be brought to
[52:47] life in this earth and I want you to
[52:49] realize something the greatest promise
[52:51] for Israel and for the children of God
[52:54] starts with The Impossible
[52:57] he started with the impossible he
[52:58] started with a paradox he started with
[53:01] something that could not happen and so
[53:03] often we're looking for the great
[53:04] Miracles of our life church to happen at
[53:06] the end well when I'm a mature believer
[53:09] when I know this when I understand that
[53:11] then God's going to do this let me tell
[53:13] you God is living in the Supernatural
[53:16] God is Supernatural and there's always
[53:18] the element of the supernatural in the
[53:20] word of God in the believer's life from
[53:22] the very start to the very end as we
[53:24] spoke in the last service when whether
[53:26] it's the the the rain coming down
[53:28] whether it's the rotting the growth or
[53:30] whether it's producing fruit every
[53:32] portion of it is Supernatural and so
[53:35] often we look at things and we think
[53:36] it's simple because it doesn't look
[53:38] Supernatural but if we only knew what
[53:40] went on behind the scenes to make those
[53:43] simple things happen we'd realize that
[53:45] God was moving all along amen that's the
[53:47] way he does this and I'm not saying you
[53:49] know we ought to expect the supernatural
[53:51] a and I'm not saying we need to expect
[53:53] it daily but we need to expect it daily
[53:55] so that when it happens we're not
[53:56] surprised and we recognize it for what
[53:58] it is amen if we're if we're children of
[54:01] a supernatural God we ought to expect
[54:03] the supernatural to happen because God
[54:06] loves to show his power to his children
[54:09] God loves to show you that he cares
[54:11] about you and that all of Heaven is
[54:13] behind you to produce what he said you
[54:15] are that's what God's trying to do
[54:17] brother Brandon would say this he says
[54:19] God always in every age dealt with men
[54:22] through signs because he is Supernatural
[54:25] and where a Supernatural God is there is
[54:28] bound to be Supernatural things going
[54:32] on see remember that the the the the the
[54:35] condition of this age is that they they
[54:38] put out God out of the church completely
[54:40] we're going to get into that a little
[54:41] bit later but when they put God out they
[54:43] put the supernatural out so many times
[54:45] do where we got people that don't
[54:46] believe in Divine Healing we don't have
[54:48] people that we have people that don't
[54:49] believe in the Holy Ghost we have people
[54:51] that don't believe in signs and wonders
[54:52] we have people that don't believe that
[54:54] God is still doing what he did 2,000
[54:56] years years ago but we are in the
[54:59] expectation of the supernatural of God
[55:01] in our life because in this age we
[55:03] expect the greatest Supernatural event
[55:05] that's ever happened and that's for a
[55:07] resurrection and a Rapture to happen in
[55:09] our bodies amen what a wonderful thing
[55:12] amen so don't sell yourself short this
[55:14] evening don't sell yourself self short
[55:17] say well I'm not this and I'm not that
[55:19] I'm not part of the ministry I'm not a
[55:20] listen if you are a child of God the
[55:23] Supernatural is embedded in your life
[55:25] whether you realize it or not so don't
[55:27] sell yourself short and definitely don't
[55:29] sell God short you know we have that
[55:32] story of the the man that went to the
[55:33] king and he asked for $1,000 and the
[55:35] King said no and then another man walked
[55:37] up and said can I have $10 million and
[55:39] the King gave it to him and they said
[55:40] King why did you not give him the ,000
[55:43] but you gave the other one the $10
[55:44] million he said because the one that
[55:46] asked the $1,000 didn't ask anything
[55:48] worthy of who I am the one that asked
[55:50] for $10 million asked something that I
[55:53] was worthy of giving I can give you
[55:55] those things and God is looking for
[55:57] people that are in expectation for him
[55:59] to do above and beyond what we could
[56:01] ever ask or think amen it's Jesus Christ
[56:04] the same yesterday today and forever and
[56:06] what he did back then for people he'll
[56:08] do for us today amen he does not change
[56:10] if we won't change because that's the
[56:12] big question will we believe it will we
[56:15] expect it will we look for it will we
[56:16] testify it or do we just say well that
[56:19] seems impossible and so we leave it
[56:20] alone and we're just going to live a
[56:22] life like everybody else no that's not
[56:24] what he's looking for our confession Our
[56:26] Testimony ought to be Jesus Christ the
[56:28] same yesterday today and forever and if
[56:30] you look in Hebrews that's 138 if you
[56:33] look at Hebrews 13:7 the the testimony
[56:36] of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[56:37] and forever was in the lives of the
[56:39] Believers that's where it was found and
[56:41] it says follow after their faith imitate
[56:43] them as you see Christ the same
[56:45] yesterday today forever and them do what
[56:47] they do because it'll produce the same
[56:48] thing in your life now God promised the
[56:51] the children of Israel a messiah and he
[56:53] he said his name will be Emanuel which
[56:55] means god with us and God promised he'd
[56:57] come down and he'd live in flesh he'd be
[56:59] a man living like they were and he says
[57:01] and if you think that's hard to believe
[57:03] I'm going to make it even harder to
[57:04] believe I'm going to be born of a
[57:06] virgin that's the way God does things
[57:08] amen God does that we call the hard way
[57:11] naturally because for him everything is
[57:13] easy there's nothing held back from him
[57:15] there's nothing that can stand before
[57:16] his his power but you know it's one
[57:19] thing to believe that God could come
[57:21] down and live in flesh and be born in
[57:24] flesh but the thing is can believe that
[57:26] it will happen in
[57:28] us because there's many that that that
[57:30] could believe he was going to be born of
[57:32] a virgin but how many virgins were there
[57:34] saying I believe it could be born in me
[57:37] that's really what we're looking for
[57:38] amen it's an entirely different thing to
[57:40] believe that God can do it in me rather
[57:42] than God can do it and we all have
[57:44] probably heard of
[57:46] this this story of of the the trapeze
[57:51] artist that that that had a crowd in
[57:53] front of them and he says do you believe
[57:55] that I can walk across this tight RPP
[57:57] across these Falls blindfolded or that I
[58:00] can walk across it they said sure we do
[58:02] he says do you believe I can do it
[58:03] blindfolded sure we do he says do you
[58:06] believe I can do it blindfolded and
[58:08] pushing a wheelbarrow and not fall yes
[58:10] sir we believe you can do it he said Do
[58:12] you believe I can do all of those things
[58:14] that with somebody in the wheelbarrow
[58:16] they said we sure do he says who's
[58:18] willing to get in the
[58:20] wheelbarrow and guess what nobody was
[58:22] willing to get in the wheelbarrow it
[58:24] showed who really believed believed him
[58:27] and who believed him for somebody
[58:30] else when somebody else's life is in the
[58:32] wheelbarrow we've got all sorts of Faith
[58:34] don't we but God's coming for a bride
[58:36] that says I'll step into the wheelbarrow
[58:38] and me I'll take him at his word as
[58:40] impossible as it seems as foolish as it
[58:43] seems I'll get into the ark that he
[58:46] provides and I'll trust him to do the
[58:48] impossible when my life's on the line
[58:50] when my money's on the line when my
[58:51] family's on the line when my Health's on
[58:53] the line when my career is on the line
[58:55] when my relationships are in the line
[58:57] I'll step into the wheelbarrow and I'll
[58:59] trust him to take me across this great
[59:01] Chasm that's before me those are the
[59:04] ones that really believe in him the ones
[59:06] that'll get in there themselves now I'm
[59:08] trying to set a pattern tonight church
[59:09] for us because we have to be able to
[59:12] believe for the impossible we have to be
[59:15] able to do it because the impossible is
[59:18] what is our
[59:19] promise and so we've got to be able to
[59:21] believe it but I want us to see that
[59:23] faith without works is dead that's what
[59:25] this picture shows faith without works
[59:27] is dead belief without faith to actually
[59:30] step into it is not real faith I like
[59:33] what brother Jerry said he said Faith
[59:35] leads to trust and Trust means you'll
[59:38] put yourself on the line with the word
[59:41] because you believe it you truly believe
[59:43] it and that's what God's looking for
[59:45] somebody that says I'll believe your
[59:47] word but I want you to understand that
[59:49] if God has sent out his word then he's
[59:51] got a people that's prepared to receive
[59:53] his word that's a beautiful promise to
[59:55] us and if we look at the Fulfillment of
[59:57] Isaiah 7:14 there we come to the Book of
[1:00:00] Luke and it says in the sixth month the
[1:00:02] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[1:00:04] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[1:00:06] virgin espoused the Virgin engaged to a
[1:00:09] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[1:00:11] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[1:00:13] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:00:15] hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[1:00:19] with thee blessed art thou among
[1:00:23] women what a greeting what what a
[1:00:26] greeting can you imagine Church Mary is
[1:00:29] sitting perhaps in the house and all of
[1:00:31] a sudden Gabriel is standing and he says
[1:00:34] God has favored you you are a blessed
[1:00:39] woman that would do something for
[1:00:42] us it says and when she saw him she was
[1:00:45] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[1:00:48] mind what manner of salutation this
[1:00:49] should be listen church God sends angels
[1:00:52] to those that are favored of God Amen
[1:00:54] God as we move forward tonight angels
[1:00:57] are sent to a certain type of people but
[1:01:00] she's sitting there and she's saying
[1:01:02] what does this all mean I found favor
[1:01:05] I'm just a little girl she wasn't that
[1:01:07] old they say she could have been as
[1:01:08] young as 14 or 15 just a young lady just
[1:01:11] like our young sisters here and an angel
[1:01:13] comes and appears to her and says you
[1:01:15] are highly favored you are
[1:01:17] blessed God is with you wow I didn't
[1:01:22] know
[1:01:23] that says and the angel said unto her
[1:01:25] fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor
[1:01:28] with God and behold Thou shalt conceive
[1:01:30] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[1:01:33] shall call his name Jesus he shall be
[1:01:35] great and shall be called the son of the
[1:01:37] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[1:01:39] him the Throne of his father David and
[1:01:41] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:01:43] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:01:45] be no end in other words the angel is
[1:01:48] saying to Mary you're going to fulfill
[1:01:50] the word of God in your
[1:01:53] flesh what was written in Isaiah 7:14
[1:01:57] you are the Fulfillment that's what he's
[1:02:00] saying there have been many virgins in
[1:02:02] Israel through the 700 years that were
[1:02:05] between Isaiah and this time many
[1:02:09] believing virgins but there was one
[1:02:12] chosen virgin out of all of them amen he
[1:02:15] says you're in the season of the Messiah
[1:02:17] and you've got a part of it and your
[1:02:19] flesh is going to play a part in this
[1:02:20] your body is going to produce the
[1:02:23] Messiah you're the chosen vessel to
[1:02:25] fulfill Isaiah
[1:02:27] 7:14 says then said Mary unto the angel
[1:02:30] how shall I how shall this be seeing I
[1:02:33] know not a man you notice Church she
[1:02:35] never says I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:02:39] qualified I don't want to do it go find
[1:02:42] somebody else all she says is how she
[1:02:46] says you I'm a virgin you know I'm a
[1:02:49] virgin and I know there's only one way
[1:02:52] that you can have a child and that's to
[1:02:53] know a man and I haven't had any
[1:02:55] intimacy with a man man yet how is this
[1:02:56] going to
[1:02:58] be
[1:03:00] notice what what gave her this attitude
[1:03:03] church if God sends an angel to you that
[1:03:07] ought to be good enough for us to look
[1:03:08] past all of our faults and failures that
[1:03:10] are inevitably there amen if God sends
[1:03:12] you a message if God sends you an angel
[1:03:15] if God sends you his word then the very
[1:03:17] coming of the word to you tells you that
[1:03:20] you are eligible and you are worthy to
[1:03:22] receive it Hallelujah that's where we
[1:03:25] stand this morning this evening is
[1:03:27] because he sent us his word we're worthy
[1:03:29] to receive his word the sending of the
[1:03:31] word tells you you're worthy to receive
[1:03:33] it God sends his Angel to people that
[1:03:35] will accept it and will listen to it and
[1:03:38] accept it and act on it that's who he
[1:03:41] comes to amen and her only question is
[1:03:43] how is this going to
[1:03:44] be it says and the angel said unto her
[1:03:47] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:03:50] the power of the highest shall
[1:03:51] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:03:54] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:03:55] shall be called The Son of God in other
[1:03:58] words his answer is Mary you're just
[1:04:00] going to have to accept it and believe
[1:04:02] it this is going to be a working of the
[1:04:05] Holy Ghost you're not going to have a
[1:04:07] part to play all you will know is that
[1:04:09] it happens you won't know when it
[1:04:12] happens but you'll know it happens
[1:04:14] because there will come the evidence
[1:04:15] later that of what happened in your body
[1:04:18] it'll be a working of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:20] Church everything that we receive to
[1:04:23] produce the word of God is a working of
[1:04:25] the Holy holy ghost in our life and we
[1:04:28] may not be able to explain it how do you
[1:04:31] explain how you go from one minute a a a
[1:04:33] creature that is lost in sin and
[1:04:36] trespasses and dead in those things to
[1:04:38] be newly risen in Christ and you're a
[1:04:40] completely new creation with a new mind
[1:04:42] and a new heart and a new spirit how do
[1:04:44] you explain that you know when you've
[1:04:47] been changed because you know the way
[1:04:49] you used to think you know the way you
[1:04:51] used to feel you know the way you used
[1:04:52] to desire things and now when you
[1:04:55] received the Holy ghost when it does the
[1:04:56] work in your life you know something's
[1:04:58] changed but you can't say how that's the
[1:05:02] impossible happening and he says Mary
[1:05:04] The Impossible is going to happen and
[1:05:06] the only thing that does the impossible
[1:05:08] in you is the Holy Ghost it takes the
[1:05:10] Holy Ghost to do these
[1:05:11] things now listen what he says and
[1:05:13] behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also
[1:05:16] hath conceived a son in her old age and
[1:05:18] this is the six Monon with her who is
[1:05:20] called baren see the Holy Ghost comes
[1:05:22] and he says other people are having
[1:05:24] Miracles too he building up her courage
[1:05:27] he's building up her faith he's saying
[1:05:28] somebody else is receiving the
[1:05:30] impossible as well it's not your
[1:05:32] impossible but it but it was impossible
[1:05:34] for her she's old she's Barren she
[1:05:36] couldn't have kids and she's 6 months
[1:05:37] into her pregnancy
[1:05:39] already he's testifying of those things
[1:05:43] it says for without for with God nothing
[1:05:47] shall be impossible church that's where
[1:05:50] we're standing today for God With God
[1:05:52] nothing will be impossible it's not ours
[1:05:55] to to say how is it going to happen it's
[1:05:57] ours to say what she says next and Mary
[1:06:00] said behold the handmade of the Lord be
[1:06:03] it unto me according to Thy
[1:06:07] word and the angel departed from her
[1:06:09] what an answer Church you're going to
[1:06:12] produce a child by the Holy Ghost you
[1:06:15] won't feel a thing all you will know is
[1:06:17] you'll be pregnant and you won't know
[1:06:19] what happen and he's going to become
[1:06:20] Messiah he'll be Emanuel God With Us his
[1:06:23] name will be Jesus and he will save you
[1:06:25] from your sin
[1:06:26] sins Hallelujah how's it going to happen
[1:06:30] I don't know but it's going to happen
[1:06:32] it's going to happen and all she says
[1:06:35] here is Lord I'll take you at your word
[1:06:38] what you said let it happen in me here I
[1:06:40] am that's all she said that's all she
[1:06:43] said church that's all we have to say
[1:06:45] listen to what the prophet God says he
[1:06:46] says now the angel Gabriel 6 months
[1:06:48] later have visited Mary and told her
[1:06:50] that her cousin was going to have a baby
[1:06:52] also so Mary knew that that would be a
[1:06:54] miracle of that woman well stricken in
[1:06:57] age having a baby but she said to the
[1:06:59] angel how shall it be with me seeing
[1:07:01] that I know not a man see see Zacharias
[1:07:05] and Elizabeth they'd had relations but
[1:07:07] Mary says this is that's great but
[1:07:09] that's not the same as me but he says
[1:07:12] and ask and you shall receive he said
[1:07:14] the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow
[1:07:15] you that Holy thing which shall be born
[1:07:18] of you shall be called The Son of God
[1:07:20] that's how it's going to happen like I
[1:07:22] said that's how anything good by the
[1:07:24] word happens in our life it's by the
[1:07:25] Holy Ghost and we may not be able to
[1:07:28] explain
[1:07:29] it it says Mary never talked back to the
[1:07:32] angel she never disgusted in any way the
[1:07:35] only thing she said was behold the
[1:07:37] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[1:07:39] according to Thy word he says did you
[1:07:41] think how that even the priest Zacharias
[1:07:44] had questioned him being an old man and
[1:07:46] her old to how this would be done and a
[1:07:48] priest who should know the word and know
[1:07:50] what God did but this little virgin was
[1:07:53] just a child remember Zacharias didn't
[1:07:55] believe it and so he was struck dumb so
[1:07:58] he couldn't speak until John was born
[1:08:02] his unbelief put him mute God said I'm
[1:08:06] not going to allow you to challenge this
[1:08:08] I'm going to strike you I'm going to
[1:08:10] close your mouth because you don't
[1:08:11] believe and when it happens then you'll
[1:08:14] be allowed to talk and when his mouth
[1:08:16] was opened it was because John was born
[1:08:18] and then the naming was John and as soon
[1:08:20] as he wrote that out then that's when
[1:08:22] his mouth came open but it said this
[1:08:24] little virgin was just a child she had
[1:08:26] no husband she had to believe the
[1:08:29] impossible something that had never
[1:08:31] happened before but she never argued she
[1:08:34] never questioned anymore it says his
[1:08:37] word was enough for her church that's
[1:08:40] where we need to get this evening his
[1:08:42] word is enough for me he says oh if the
[1:08:45] church could just get like that the word
[1:08:47] settles it if God said so that's all we
[1:08:50] need to know how's it going to be I
[1:08:53] can't tell you but if God said so it's
[1:08:55] going to be that way because God said so
[1:08:58] oh that's the way I want the church to
[1:09:00] know if there's anything I want you to
[1:09:02] sink faith in is in what God has said it
[1:09:05] has to be
[1:09:08] true he says did you notice she had to
[1:09:10] believe the impossible she could not go
[1:09:13] back like Zacharias could he could have
[1:09:14] gone back to Sarah and Sarah was almost
[1:09:17] 100 when she had the baby and Hannah at
[1:09:19] the temple she was an old woman too and
[1:09:21] they had plenty of examples of that
[1:09:22] where they had husbands but Mary had to
[1:09:24] believe some something that never had
[1:09:27] happened
[1:09:28] before what a position for this young
[1:09:30] woman to be in never happened before
[1:09:34] says you've got thousands of examples of
[1:09:36] Divine Healing look at people's been
[1:09:38] healed with cancer blindness dumbness
[1:09:40] deafness all kinds of sicknesses and
[1:09:42] diseases we've got plenty of that to
[1:09:44] look to as examples but this little girl
[1:09:47] didn't have nothing but just his word
[1:09:49] and that was sufficient his word was
[1:09:52] good enough for her Hallelujah he says I
[1:09:55] want want you to notice she didn't wait
[1:09:57] till she was positive it was going to
[1:09:58] happen she started testifying about it
[1:10:01] right away she didn't wait till she felt
[1:10:03] life so she could be positive she was
[1:10:05] going to have the baby just as soon as
[1:10:07] she heard his word she took him at his
[1:10:10] word she started testifying and praising
[1:10:12] God for the baby before she ever felt
[1:10:17] anything this is the Overcomer response
[1:10:21] this is the believer's response here he
[1:10:23] says give us more Marys around here that
[1:10:25] can take God at his word and praise him
[1:10:28] whether you feel anything or not take
[1:10:31] him at his word God's trying to find
[1:10:33] somebody who will take his
[1:10:35] word he says I don't care how you
[1:10:38] feel someone says well I don't feel any
[1:10:41] better I went to the meetings I was
[1:10:42] prayed for that don't have nothing to do
[1:10:44] with it God said so and that settles it
[1:10:47] amen somebody who will take his word
[1:10:50] that's what pleases him believe his word
[1:10:53] that's what pleases God that's the only
[1:10:55] way you will ever find favor with him is
[1:10:58] believe his word amen God help us this
[1:11:02] evening to believe him he said Mary had
[1:11:04] to believe for the impossible but God
[1:11:07] takes The Impossibles and makes them
[1:11:10] real when he's taken at his word church
[1:11:14] what impossible situation are you facing
[1:11:16] this
[1:11:17] evening we look around we've got people
[1:11:20] we're praying for we've got people
[1:11:22] facing debilitating sicknesses we've got
[1:11:24] people facing conditions in their body
[1:11:26] they've had for their life maybe for
[1:11:28] decades we've got people that are out in
[1:11:30] the world that ought to be in the church
[1:11:32] and it seems like things are getting
[1:11:33] more and more twisted up let me tell you
[1:11:36] there's always a god of the impossible
[1:11:39] amen there's always a god of the
[1:11:42] impossible the doctors might have said
[1:11:44] you'll never get rid of that cancer the
[1:11:46] doctors might have said you'll never be
[1:11:47] able to walk again it's impossible for
[1:11:49] you to do it he says but Impossibles
[1:11:51] Fade Out when God's taken at his word we
[1:11:55] sing that song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
[1:11:57] look full in his wonderful face and the
[1:12:00] things of this world will grow strangely
[1:12:02] dim in the light of his glory and grace
[1:12:04] it's what you're looking at that will
[1:12:06] determine what you see and as you look
[1:12:08] more and more on him as you look more
[1:12:09] and more on his word as you dwell in his
[1:12:12] presence and the things of God you'll
[1:12:14] find that these things start to fade
[1:12:15] away and Faith builds up and the
[1:12:17] impossible starts to happen and it
[1:12:20] doesn't always happen like this it may
[1:12:23] fade in slowly bit by bit I told the
[1:12:28] story many times of my mom when she came
[1:12:31] to the message and she she she loved her
[1:12:36] makeup but she had read in the
[1:12:38] scriptures that the woman that wore
[1:12:39] makeup was
[1:12:40] Jezebel and she said Lord I see in your
[1:12:43] word that I ought not to be wearing this
[1:12:46] she said but I want to wear
[1:12:50] it she was honest before God but she
[1:12:53] said I want to please you more than I
[1:12:55] want that makeup but you know that I
[1:12:58] can't give it up unless you change my
[1:13:00] heart and so she said I'm saying I'm
[1:13:02] willing to give it up but I'm asking you
[1:13:04] to take the desire away guess what she
[1:13:07] did not wake up the next morning with no
[1:13:08] desire for makeup but 6 months later she
[1:13:12] realized she was no longer wearing it
[1:13:14] anymore Hallelujah and she couldn't tell
[1:13:16] you the day it was taken away all she
[1:13:19] knew was that it was gone where once it
[1:13:21] had been I talked to my dad about that
[1:13:24] my dad doesn't serve the Lord he said
[1:13:25] John that's exactly the way it happened
[1:13:28] it just started fading out of her life
[1:13:31] until it was all gone and she never
[1:13:32] picked it up
[1:13:34] again The Impossible happened for her
[1:13:39] Lord I want it I like it I desire it but
[1:13:43] I want you more than that so take it
[1:13:45] away and God took away the very thing
[1:13:47] that she had loved for all of her
[1:13:50] life Impossibles Fade Out when God's
[1:13:52] taken at his word no matter what the
[1:13:54] doctor says he's doing the best he can
[1:13:56] he says but God is
[1:13:59] God Amen and his word is just like he is
[1:14:01] and you take his word that settles it
[1:14:04] forever if thou can't believe say to
[1:14:06] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:14:08] in your heart but will believe that what
[1:14:10] you've said will come to pass you can
[1:14:12] have what you said remember what he said
[1:14:15] Mary had no history of this no previous
[1:14:18] cases she couldn't turn back into the
[1:14:20] into the the Old Testament and say oh
[1:14:22] there's one that happened therefore I
[1:14:24] know it can happen again no God asked
[1:14:26] her to believe the impossible something
[1:14:29] she'd never seen never read about she
[1:14:31] had no testimonies nobody in her church
[1:14:33] to to to to bolster her faith but just
[1:14:36] the presence of the messenger of God
[1:14:39] with the word for her was enough to
[1:14:40] raise her faith to say be it unto me let
[1:14:42] it happen as you said it she knew she
[1:14:45] was nothing special that's why she
[1:14:46] wondered what's this all
[1:14:48] about that's the kind of people God
[1:14:51] comes to people that think they're
[1:14:53] nothing
[1:14:55] why
[1:14:57] me cuz you're chosen not cuz you're good
[1:15:01] not cuz you're great because you're
[1:15:04] chosen and it's his choosing not ours as
[1:15:06] we'll see as we go later but watch now I
[1:15:08] want you to show the to see the followup
[1:15:10] of this so she says be it unto me she
[1:15:13] receives the word she says I believe it
[1:15:16] and she goes to visit Elizabeth remember
[1:15:18] she goes straight to Elizabeth and it
[1:15:20] came to pass that when Elizabeth heard
[1:15:22] the salutation of Mary the Babe leaped
[1:15:24] in her womb and Elizabeth was filled
[1:15:26] with the Holy Ghost and she spake out
[1:15:28] with a loud voice and said blessed art
[1:15:30] thou among women and blessed is the
[1:15:32] fruit of thy womb and whence is this to
[1:15:34] me that the mother of my Lord should
[1:15:36] come to me she says Mary you're special
[1:15:38] why are you coming to me God why is this
[1:15:41] why are you blessing me with this sing
[1:15:43] it says for L as soon as the voice of
[1:15:46] thy salutation sounded in mine ears the
[1:15:48] Babe leaped in my womb for Joy the first
[1:15:51] mention of the name Jesus brought life
[1:15:53] to a dead baby
[1:15:55] that b it wasn't dead it had never moved
[1:15:57] she was growing but the baby had never
[1:15:59] kicked in her and they were worried that
[1:16:01] it was going to be still born and as
[1:16:04] soon as that name Jesus Is Spoken life
[1:16:06] came to that baby and the Holy Ghost now
[1:16:08] comes over and anoints Elizabeth and she
[1:16:11] listen to what she says she says and
[1:16:12] blessed is she that did
[1:16:15] what
[1:16:17] believed if thou C believe all things
[1:16:19] are possible the only requirement for us
[1:16:22] is to believe it and act on it
[1:16:25] and blessed is she that believed for
[1:16:28] there shall be a performance of those
[1:16:31] things which were told her from the Lord
[1:16:33] this is Elizabeth now speaking under the
[1:16:35] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and what
[1:16:36] does the Holy Ghost do Church it
[1:16:38] confirms the word you want to know if
[1:16:41] you've got the Holy Ghost does it
[1:16:43] confirm the word in your life does it
[1:16:45] say Amen does it make it a reality in
[1:16:47] your life that's how you know you got
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost not because you speak in
[1:16:50] tongues not because of signs and wonders
[1:16:52] but because the life of that spirit is
[1:16:54] in you producing the word in you
[1:16:57] amen says Mary does this Mary said my
[1:17:01] soul do magnify the Lord church that
[1:17:03] ought to be our response when the word
[1:17:05] comes to you and you know it's to you we
[1:17:07] ought to start praising the Lord we
[1:17:09] ought to be able to worship though we
[1:17:10] can't feel it though we can't see it
[1:17:12] though it may not have happened yet in
[1:17:14] this Physical Realm when we receive the
[1:17:16] word it's as if it has already happened
[1:17:18] and we can praise the Lord for it right
[1:17:20] then and there remember brother Ram said
[1:17:22] he says if I've got the money for a
[1:17:23] piece of bread I can thank God for the
[1:17:25] bread even though it's not in my pocket
[1:17:27] yet why cuz I've got what it takes to
[1:17:28] get the
[1:17:29] bread she says my soul do magnify the
[1:17:32] Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
[1:17:35] my savior for he ha regarded the lowest
[1:17:38] state of his handmaiden for behold from
[1:17:41] henceforth all generations shall call me
[1:17:43] blessed and here's her confession for he
[1:17:46] that has Mighty ha done to me great
[1:17:50] things what a line what a scripture
[1:17:52] Church the Mighty God has done something
[1:17:54] wonderful in my life we ought to be able
[1:17:57] to testify of the Mighty God what he's
[1:18:00] done in our life amen that's what God
[1:18:03] does to people that believe him he does
[1:18:05] mighty things amen he changes them he
[1:18:07] turns lowly people into great names he
[1:18:10] says for he that is mighty had done
[1:18:12] great done to me great things and holy
[1:18:15] is his name notice how it says in verse
[1:18:17] 45 there shall be a performance of those
[1:18:20] things which were told you of the lord
[1:18:22] we saw God gave a word promise and we
[1:18:24] know his word can't return to him void
[1:18:26] it has to produce what it said it has to
[1:18:28] bring it to reality and now we come 700
[1:18:31] years later of that bread being upon the
[1:18:33] Water the word's been given 700 years
[1:18:36] ago and God says now is the season of
[1:18:39] The Impossible after 700 years we'd say
[1:18:42] the word's dead it's not going to happen
[1:18:44] it's gone too far look at the conditions
[1:18:46] we're in the Romans have taken over us
[1:18:48] we're under we're under slavery we can't
[1:18:50] worship the way we want
[1:18:52] to the conditions are darker than
[1:18:55] they've ever been and God comes on the
[1:18:57] scene and says now is the now is the
[1:19:00] time the worst time possible God says
[1:19:03] this is it time for the impossible to
[1:19:06] happen and wonder of Wonders Church
[1:19:08] there's actually a virgin and she's
[1:19:10] actually a
[1:19:12] Believer this is not luck this is not
[1:19:16] happen stance this is not just an
[1:19:19] opportunity this is God not this is not
[1:19:22] God waiting for somebody this this is
[1:19:25] God preparing somebody at an ordained
[1:19:28] time at an ordained season that she
[1:19:30] would be a virgin that she would be a
[1:19:33] real believer that she'd be able to
[1:19:34] receive the message God spoke his word
[1:19:37] he wrote it down as a record and then
[1:19:40] God knew and for ordained somebody to
[1:19:43] receive it and fulfill it that's the way
[1:19:45] the word works because it's fulfilled in
[1:19:48] people it's not fulfilled in situations
[1:19:50] it's fulfilled in people the word is for
[1:19:53] people amen to is to be made flesh amen
[1:19:56] and so God's word went out and it
[1:19:58] prepared a person to receive the word
[1:20:02] that's what it did he prepared somebody
[1:20:05] to fulfill his word it wasn't just lucky
[1:20:08] it didn't take 700 years for a
[1:20:10] virgin there were plenty of virgins but
[1:20:13] God in the right time and in the right
[1:20:15] season said here it is it's time to
[1:20:17] go Abraham says this he says how but did
[1:20:20] you know God's more obligated to keep
[1:20:22] his promise than you are when God makes
[1:20:25] a promise he's got to keep it in order
[1:20:27] to be God every promise he makes is true
[1:20:30] and he's obligated to that promise if
[1:20:32] you'll keep that in mind while you're
[1:20:34] Crossing through this prayer line
[1:20:35] tonight something will happen to you to
[1:20:37] know that God cannot make a promise and
[1:20:39] not stick to it he's got to now catch
[1:20:42] this he says and he knows all things so
[1:20:45] he's infinite we're finite and can make
[1:20:48] a promise and have to take it back but
[1:20:50] he can't because he's perfect he knows
[1:20:53] everything the end from the beginning
[1:20:55] so he has to keep his promise and how
[1:20:58] does he do it church and he's always got
[1:21:01] somebody who will believe that he gives
[1:21:06] it and then he prepares a vessel to
[1:21:07] receive it he says God let me be one of
[1:21:10] those no matter how much you have to be
[1:21:12] criticized and laughed at let me believe
[1:21:15] God's promise and stay with that catch
[1:21:17] that thought he says he's infinite he
[1:21:19] knows the end from the beginning he
[1:21:21] gives a promise so that he can fulfill
[1:21:23] it and that means there has to be
[1:21:24] somebody to believe the promise and
[1:21:26] receive the promise to produce the
[1:21:30] promise church that ought to make us
[1:21:32] happy this
[1:21:32] evening that there are promises
[1:21:35] unfulfilled and we're in the season of
[1:21:37] those promises therefore there's got to
[1:21:39] be at least one person that's here
[1:21:41] that's going to receive it amen somebody
[1:21:43] that's going to fulfill the word amen we
[1:21:45] weren't born into Christian families we
[1:21:47] weren't born into families that believe
[1:21:48] this end time message uh by chance we
[1:21:50] don't hear the word of God by chance we
[1:21:52] didn't come out from under our mushroom
[1:21:54] brother Mark by chance but there is
[1:21:56] something that went out and prepared Us
[1:21:58] by predestination by for ordination that
[1:22:01] prepared a people that would take that
[1:22:03] word and receive it and make it live in
[1:22:05] their lives that's the way that God
[1:22:07] works amen there's always somebody
[1:22:10] ordained to believe it and to receive it
[1:22:13] and we read this scripture last service
[1:22:14] but I want to touch it again because it
[1:22:16] confirms this idea in Romans 8 it says
[1:22:18] we know that all things work together
[1:22:20] for good to them that love God to them
[1:22:23] who are not just called the called
[1:22:26] according to his purpose Church there's
[1:22:28] plenty of people that are
[1:22:30] called scripture says many are called
[1:22:33] few are chosen The Chosen are the called
[1:22:38] there's a gospel call that goes out and
[1:22:40] people's consciences are pricked they
[1:22:42] want to live a better life they want to
[1:22:43] do better things as a as a father as a
[1:22:45] mother as a husband as a wife they want
[1:22:48] to be a better citizen whatever that
[1:22:50] might be and that that is that is a
[1:22:52] calling but that is not necessarily the
[1:22:54] calling amen they can they can feel the
[1:22:57] pull of the Gospel but they can't
[1:22:59] surrender to the gospel and they can't
[1:23:02] live it they love the idea of it but
[1:23:04] they can't receive the life of it
[1:23:05] remember what Jesus said he says my
[1:23:07] words are spirit and they are life amen
[1:23:09] but there's a group that is known as the
[1:23:11] called and that's the elected that's the
[1:23:13] predestinated and they have a purpose in
[1:23:15] their calling and it's God's purpose and
[1:23:18] what is God's purpose fulfill his word
[1:23:21] that's our purpose is to fulfill the
[1:23:22] word of God and then he says for whom he
[1:23:24] did for no past tense he also did
[1:23:26] predestinate past tense to be conformed
[1:23:29] future tense he knew you he
[1:23:32] predestinated you and you're going to be
[1:23:33] changed to the image of his son that he
[1:23:36] might be the firstborn among many
[1:23:38] Brethren remember John 1:1 says in the
[1:23:40] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:23:42] God the Word was God and the Word was
[1:23:44] made flesh amen that's Christ in a
[1:23:46] nutshell and he's the first of all of us
[1:23:48] and what was he he was the word made
[1:23:50] flesh what are we the word made flesh
[1:23:53] he's the firstborn amongst men many
[1:23:54] brethren we are supposed to be just like
[1:23:56] him in the same image I'm not him
[1:23:59] completely you're not him completely but
[1:24:01] we're in the image of him we're we're
[1:24:03] we're little micro christs if we want to
[1:24:05] put it that way little anointed ones
[1:24:07] little words made flesh if we want to
[1:24:09] call it that it says morever whom he did
[1:24:12] predestinate past them he also called
[1:24:15] past and whom he called them he also
[1:24:17] Justified past and whom he justified
[1:24:20] then he also glorified past tense what
[1:24:22] shall we then say to these things of God
[1:24:24] before us then who can be against us in
[1:24:26] other words he's saying you're not here
[1:24:28] because of you you're here because of
[1:24:29] him you're not here because you accepted
[1:24:31] you're here because he called he said
[1:24:34] this is what you going to be and so now
[1:24:36] because he said it he's got to produce
[1:24:37] it and that's why we're here today he
[1:24:39] said he was going to do it Church we're
[1:24:42] not here because we're born into the
[1:24:43] right family look in the scriptures a a
[1:24:46] and you see how many horrible ungodly
[1:24:49] people come out of Godly
[1:24:51] homes the Kings had horrible children
[1:24:53] prophet had horrible Sons priests had
[1:24:56] horrible Sons some of the greatest
[1:24:59] Believers in the scriptures had some of
[1:25:00] the most horrible children look at Jacob
[1:25:03] and
[1:25:04] Esau Esau despised the word of
[1:25:07] God came out of the same the same flesh
[1:25:10] that produced Jacob who was a prince
[1:25:12] having power with God once he got
[1:25:13] changed before that he was a
[1:25:16] Shyer amen but but that's not the
[1:25:18] guarantee here is that we're we're here
[1:25:20] because we're raised in it lots of
[1:25:22] people are raised in it lots of people
[1:25:23] are brought up into it and guess what
[1:25:25] lots of them go
[1:25:27] out but there's an elect there's a
[1:25:30] called group that's here because he said
[1:25:32] there was going to be somebody
[1:25:35] here he says this Our God lives and
[1:25:37] Reigns he's a god of power he's the same
[1:25:40] yesterday today and forever he's the god
[1:25:43] that closed the heavens in the Days of
[1:25:44] Elijah he's the god that stilled the
[1:25:46] waters on the Mighty Sea that night he's
[1:25:48] the one that woke up his son from the
[1:25:50] dead after being in the grave for three
[1:25:52] days he's omnipotent he lives and reigns
[1:25:55] forever church that's our God that's my
[1:25:57] God that's your God tonight he says and
[1:25:59] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:01] forever he will always be God He will
[1:26:04] always have somebody who will believe
[1:26:07] him in that way too in that way too that
[1:26:11] he can raise the dead that he can heal
[1:26:13] the sick that he can change the lives
[1:26:15] that he can change the body that he can
[1:26:17] control the elements of this
[1:26:19] Earth that he can have an impact in the
[1:26:22] in the lives that we live that he's not
[1:26:24] just sitting up in a throne somewhere
[1:26:26] and that everything is just kind of
[1:26:27] bumbling along here no he can intervene
[1:26:30] and he has intervened in our lives to
[1:26:31] bring us to where we are today and he's
[1:26:33] doing that to continue to take us to
[1:26:35] where we ought to be tomorrow and the
[1:26:36] day after and the day after and the day
[1:26:38] after he says he will always have
[1:26:40] somebody who will believe him in that
[1:26:42] way too God has never been without a
[1:26:45] testimony I say Amen to that cuz I
[1:26:47] believe I'm one of those and I believe
[1:26:48] I'm talking to other people that are
[1:26:50] just like that cuz I know your
[1:26:52] testimonies I know what God's done I've
[1:26:53] seen the the healings I've seen the
[1:26:55] Deliverance I've seen the lives changed
[1:26:57] I've seen the character being molded
[1:26:59] I've seen people that used to be one way
[1:27:01] and now they're are completely different
[1:27:02] way and this way is like Christ and that
[1:27:04] was like their parents that was like
[1:27:06] their family bloodline but now they've
[1:27:08] been changed into new creatures and we
[1:27:10] may not be perfect but we're moving in
[1:27:12] the direction of Christ amen and that's
[1:27:15] why I believe it amen but let's not stop
[1:27:17] there let's not stop because we have a
[1:27:19] testimony let's go on until we have a
[1:27:21] body change amen let's go until we have
[1:27:23] a resurrection let's go until we can see
[1:27:25] sister coffee sitting around our table
[1:27:28] or sister Dumford sitting around our
[1:27:29] table and we've got some fellowship for
[1:27:31] 30 or 40 days before we go away I look
[1:27:34] forward to the day that we'll see those
[1:27:35] people amen I look forward to that that
[1:27:37] we we that we can be a people that say
[1:27:39] that I know that God is good I've tasted
[1:27:41] and seen it I know he's a Healer I know
[1:27:44] he's a deliverer I know that he speaks
[1:27:46] back to us I know that he's alive and
[1:27:48] well I know that he's a provider I've
[1:27:50] known him in the power of his
[1:27:52] resurrection
[1:27:54] that's when he changed us into a new cre
[1:27:56] creature but there's a literal
[1:27:58] fulfillment of that when he rises us up
[1:28:00] and gives us a glorified body like his
[1:28:03] amen now I want to take us to the
[1:28:05] present day for the last third of this
[1:28:07] service and I want to go to the Book of
[1:28:09] Revelation and we know that the Book of
[1:28:10] Revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[1:28:12] Christ and it's a full picture it's a
[1:28:14] summary picture of who he is what he is
[1:28:16] what he's doing what he will do and we
[1:28:18] read his description in Revelation 1 and
[1:28:20] I want you to catch this as we read this
[1:28:22] it says John to the seven churches which
[1:28:25] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[1:28:28] from him which is and which was and
[1:28:30] which is to come and from the seven
[1:28:32] spirits which are before thrown notice
[1:28:34] John's salutation he says in all that
[1:28:37] you read here he says let peace and
[1:28:40] Grace be what comes with it the Book of
[1:28:44] Revelation remember I it I believe the
[1:28:47] the original word is Apocalypto when it
[1:28:49] talks about the tribulation this is a
[1:28:51] book that has great judgment in it
[1:28:54] great
[1:28:55] destruction lots of blood lots of Mayhem
[1:28:59] lots of
[1:29:00] War but in it all John says hey if
[1:29:04] you'll receive what's here it'll be
[1:29:06] grace and it'll be peace to you no
[1:29:08] matter what the situation is he says and
[1:29:10] from Jesus Christ who is who the
[1:29:13] faithful witness we're speaking on
[1:29:14] faithful and true the faithful witness
[1:29:16] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:29:19] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:29:21] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:29:23] from our sins in his own blood and has
[1:29:25] made us past tense Kings and Priests
[1:29:28] unto God and his father to him be glory
[1:29:31] and Dominion forever and ever amen so we
[1:29:34] see the seven spirits of God which are
[1:29:35] the Seven Stars in his hand which are
[1:29:37] the seven Messengers to the seven
[1:29:39] Gentile Church ages and then we dive
[1:29:41] into Revelation 2 and it starts with the
[1:29:43] church ages with the first one which was
[1:29:45] the Ephesian Church Age and and Ephesian
[1:29:48] Church age was Peak Christianity what we
[1:29:50] call they were at the Apex they were the
[1:29:52] highest order uh of the Christians of
[1:29:54] the Believers why because they were LED
[1:29:57] and controlled completely by the Holy
[1:29:58] Spirit that's what made them great was
[1:30:00] that they were not under the the orders
[1:30:02] of men but what happened was God sent
[1:30:05] them a messenger an angel messenger
[1:30:07] which was Paul the prophet Paul the
[1:30:09] Apostle and Paul laid out the word and
[1:30:11] it set the church in order and everyone
[1:30:14] became subject to that word and what did
[1:30:16] it produce It produced Christ all over
[1:30:18] again that's what they saw remember what
[1:30:20] the scripture says and they looked at at
[1:30:22] at uh uh Paul and John and saw that they
[1:30:25] were ignorant and unted but they knew
[1:30:27] that they had been with
[1:30:28] Jesus amen sometimes we seem ignorant to
[1:30:31] the world but people know we've been
[1:30:34] with Jesus I trust amen but even Peter
[1:30:37] we see the man with the keys to the
[1:30:39] kingdom had to come into alignment with
[1:30:41] what Paul said why because Paul was the
[1:30:44] Ephesian Church age messenger he was the
[1:30:46] first star he was the first Angel
[1:30:49] messenger and and we know that what
[1:30:51] happened after that they those men died
[1:30:53] and things got Progressive worse with
[1:30:54] each age after that but notice how every
[1:30:57] Church age starts with a verse that says
[1:30:59] unto the angel of the Church of whatever
[1:31:02] right and then what is that church that
[1:31:04] angel It's a messenger it's not a
[1:31:06] literal angel from heaven it's an
[1:31:08] Earthly Angel it's a messenger and it's
[1:31:10] one man and that man is inspired by the
[1:31:13] holy spirit because it's God writing to
[1:31:16] the Church of each age and that man is
[1:31:18] inspired by the Holy Spirit he catches
[1:31:20] the inspiration for the age and he
[1:31:22] brings a message to that people and it's
[1:31:25] what they need to overcome in that age
[1:31:28] amen they're not adding to scripture
[1:31:30] they're not taking it away from
[1:31:31] scripture but they're focusing them on
[1:31:34] the scripture that's needful for them
[1:31:36] specifically to overcome in their age
[1:31:38] amen we don't need Noah's message today
[1:31:40] but it's in the Scriptures it it's it's
[1:31:42] for our admonition we can learn from it
[1:31:44] but Noah's message will not get us into
[1:31:46] resurrection and
[1:31:47] Rapture but every Church age has a
[1:31:51] messenger that comes to them and then at
[1:31:53] the end of every Church age it says he
[1:31:55] that have an ear let him hear what the
[1:31:56] spirit saith unto the churches and then
[1:31:58] it gives the reward for overcoming what
[1:32:01] is overcoming mean Church it means to
[1:32:04] hear and act on what the holy spirit is
[1:32:07] saying to the church it's the only way
[1:32:09] to overcome and how is the holy spirit
[1:32:11] speaking by way of the Angel messenger
[1:32:15] it's the messenger to the age it's God's
[1:32:17] chosen man it has nothing to do what we
[1:32:19] think of him his faults his flaws his
[1:32:22] failures his personality his education
[1:32:24] or lack thereof God chooses a man and he
[1:32:27] uses him to bring a message to that
[1:32:29] church age and the first one was
[1:32:31] Paul
[1:32:33] amen now that doesn't mean there isn't a
[1:32:35] five-fold
[1:32:36] Ministry Ephesians 4 tells us there is
[1:32:38] one amen of the the the pastors and the
[1:32:42] teachers and the evangelists and the
[1:32:43] apostles and the prophets and these
[1:32:44] things but there is one man in every age
[1:32:47] that brings a message to that age and to
[1:32:49] those people to overcome and it's not a
[1:32:52] new message amen it doesn't add new
[1:32:54] doctrine but rather it always points
[1:32:56] them back to the scripture because if
[1:32:58] we'll get back to the word we'll get
[1:32:59] restored back to God that's what
[1:33:01] happened in Israel's days remember every
[1:33:03] man did what was right in his own eyes
[1:33:05] and what did they do they veered off and
[1:33:07] they went into judgment and then God
[1:33:08] sends a man back and he brings them back
[1:33:11] shows them the word they repent come
[1:33:12] back and then God's with them again it's
[1:33:14] the same thing happening in the seven
[1:33:15] Church ages amen and that person brings
[1:33:18] that man brings a message that points
[1:33:20] them to their condition points them to
[1:33:22] where they've gotten off the road
[1:33:24] how to get back on the road and then
[1:33:25] what the reward is for getting back on
[1:33:27] the road remember what Paul said this
[1:33:30] the first church age messenger he says
[1:33:32] but though we or an angel from heaven
[1:33:35] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:33:37] that which we have preached unto you let
[1:33:39] him be a curse Paul couldn't preach any
[1:33:41] other gospel than what the the the Holy
[1:33:44] Ghost had given him in the desert in
[1:33:45] Arabia Paul couldn't take it back Paul
[1:33:49] couldn't change it he couldn't add to it
[1:33:52] couldn't take away from it he couldn't
[1:33:54] he couldn't adjust it for societal
[1:33:57] Norms he couldn't bow to political or
[1:34:00] religious pressure what was given was
[1:34:03] what was given and there was no change
[1:34:05] in it why because it was of the Holy
[1:34:07] Ghost it was God's word to the church
[1:34:09] and it's truth and it stands alone it's
[1:34:11] unchanging it's the gold standard of the
[1:34:13] gospel for the for the Gentile church is
[1:34:15] the New
[1:34:17] Testament and so nothing can change so
[1:34:20] if you have a messenger that comes and
[1:34:22] he goes a different direction than Paul
[1:34:24] Paul says let him be accursed and Paul
[1:34:25] says even if I do
[1:34:27] it listen when we go when if if we ever
[1:34:31] go through the church ages we'll see
[1:34:32] that so many of those Messengers they
[1:34:35] still had issues you look at Luther
[1:34:37] Luther brought the the fifth Church age
[1:34:39] message but even he went off into
[1:34:42] fanaticism but he brought the message
[1:34:44] that started them on the justification
[1:34:46] Road and that's all he had to do but he
[1:34:49] needed to go further and he didn't and
[1:34:51] he fell by the wayside he got wrapped up
[1:34:53] in politics and these different things
[1:34:55] fanaticism and so you had to have men
[1:34:57] come behind them to preach
[1:34:58] sanctification and then come behind that
[1:35:00] to preach the Holy Ghost and these
[1:35:01] different things because people either
[1:35:02] stopped or they fell by the wayside but
[1:35:05] nonetheless God used them it was God's
[1:35:08] choosing but I want you to realize one
[1:35:10] major thing is that in all of these
[1:35:12] Church ages there's a great falling away
[1:35:14] every time and they're going further and
[1:35:16] further into darkness but no matter how
[1:35:19] dark it was there was always an
[1:35:22] overcomer no matter what the conditions
[1:35:24] were no matter how bad it looked why
[1:35:27] because God doesn't give a promise and
[1:35:29] not fulfill it and if he says there's a
[1:35:31] reward for the Overcomer that means
[1:35:32] there's got to be an overcomer because
[1:35:34] there's got to be somebody to receive it
[1:35:35] and fulfill it and how did they overcome
[1:35:37] they listen to their angel messenger
[1:35:40] that's it there's a fivefold Ministry
[1:35:43] today but I've got to say the same
[1:35:45] things that our Angel messenger said and
[1:35:47] what did he say he said what Paul said
[1:35:50] that's how I believe him is because he
[1:35:51] said what Paul said but but he focused
[1:35:54] on the things that are needful for us to
[1:35:56] restore us back to where we need to be
[1:35:58] and when we look at the Dark Ages or we
[1:36:00] look at the church ages
[1:36:03] here the seven Church ages remember the
[1:36:06] angel Drew these out on the wall and
[1:36:08] when he drew them out i' I've put it
[1:36:10] here as he drew it and that's that it
[1:36:12] look how it goes in the first church age
[1:36:13] you have all this light that's the word
[1:36:15] the revealing of the word and it gets
[1:36:16] darker darker darker and then there's a
[1:36:19] turnaround at the fifth and into the
[1:36:21] sixth it's getting light and we think
[1:36:23] God's doing doing something and then it
[1:36:24] comes into the seventh and it is total
[1:36:27] darkness things are getting worse and
[1:36:30] worse and worse you look at the Dark
[1:36:31] Ages I don't know how people got saved
[1:36:33] in the Dark
[1:36:35] Ages they couldn't even read the word it
[1:36:37] was it was in Latin they couldn't
[1:36:39] couldn't understand it how do you get
[1:36:41] saved if you can't even read the word
[1:36:43] but God had people in there that were
[1:36:46] saved through those things and we see
[1:36:47] that the Catholic Church killed over 60
[1:36:50] million people for
[1:36:52] disagreeing they gave their lives for
[1:36:54] the gospel 60 more than 60 63 68 million
[1:36:58] 68 million people killed for the Gospel
[1:37:01] of Jesus Christ God had people that
[1:37:04] would stand and they overcame by what
[1:37:07] taking him at his word and refusing to
[1:37:08] back
[1:37:10] away but we look in there and we see
[1:37:12] that no matter how bad it got look at
[1:37:13] that first church age as it transitioned
[1:37:16] and and they went from everything was
[1:37:18] going great and signs and wonders and
[1:37:20] now pretty soon they've got to give
[1:37:21] their lives and the scripture says women
[1:37:23] had their children saw torn apart and
[1:37:26] saw aunder and and people were being
[1:37:28] just destroyed and torn apart and and
[1:37:31] all these horrible things and it looked
[1:37:33] so dark and yet God had people there
[1:37:36] that would receive their message and
[1:37:38] receive the anointing that came with it
[1:37:40] and they go through anything and receive
[1:37:42] an overcomer
[1:37:45] reward we ought to be able to look at
[1:37:47] all six of those and see how difficult
[1:37:49] it was and say but there was still an
[1:37:50] overcomer so that when we come to this
[1:37:52] seventh one
[1:37:54] we say as black as it is there's got to
[1:37:57] be an overcomer
[1:37:59] amen no matter how long things drag on
[1:38:01] no matter how bad things got God was
[1:38:05] always there and then we come to the
[1:38:07] very end the end of all things and this
[1:38:09] ought to be the Golden Age of the
[1:38:11] believer the seventh Church age ought to
[1:38:13] be Peak Christianity it ought to be God
[1:38:15] just showing signs and wonders in his
[1:38:17] church it ought to be the greatest thing
[1:38:18] we've had seven ages to come with it and
[1:38:20] then what does the angel draw total
[1:38:22] darkness and the prophet of God would
[1:38:24] only add in a sliver of light he said to
[1:38:26] represent the bride that gets pulled out
[1:38:28] of that age and goes into resurrection
[1:38:30] and a
[1:38:32] Rapture in the darkest time possible
[1:38:37] when the world is in a Sodom and gomorra
[1:38:39] condition when the world is in
[1:38:42] total total
[1:38:45] perversion God says I'll do the
[1:38:48] impossible I'll pick the worst time to
[1:38:51] do the greatest time
[1:38:54] with a humble people that'll take me at
[1:38:56] my word
[1:38:58] amen before we read that last Church age
[1:39:01] I want to I want to jump to to
[1:39:03] Revelation 10 because Revelation 10
[1:39:05] shows us the events of the seventh
[1:39:07] Church age it's the action that's
[1:39:09] happening in the latan church age we
[1:39:11] look in Revelation 10:1 it says and I
[1:39:13] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:39:15] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:39:17] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:39:19] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:39:20] pillars of fire now if you look at the
[1:39:22] description in Revelation 1 we see this
[1:39:24] is none other than Christ himself Christ
[1:39:27] himself personal presence it says and he
[1:39:30] had in his hand a little book open and
[1:39:32] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[1:39:33] his left foot on the earth and cried
[1:39:35] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[1:39:37] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:39:39] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:39:41] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[1:39:42] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[1:39:45] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:39:46] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[1:39:49] and write them not it says and the angel
[1:39:52] which I saw
[1:39:53] stood upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:39:55] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:39:58] by him that liveth forever and ever now
[1:40:01] remember when he made the Covenant with
[1:40:02] Abraham he swore by himself by himself
[1:40:05] because he could swear by no greater now
[1:40:07] he comes down and he's what is he doing
[1:40:08] he's fulfilling the
[1:40:10] Covenant it's the same Oath by the same
[1:40:13] person he swore by himself it says who
[1:40:15] created heaven and the things that there
[1:40:17] in are and the earth and the things that
[1:40:19] therein are and the Sea and the things
[1:40:21] which are therein that there should be
[1:40:23] time no longer in other words God things
[1:40:25] have gone on long enough and God's
[1:40:27] wrapping up his plan he's wrapping up
[1:40:29] his word purpose God's going into action
[1:40:32] we'll see the seventh seal is an action
[1:40:34] seal it's not about talking now it's
[1:40:36] about doing it says now in verse seven
[1:40:39] so God's comes down Christ comes down
[1:40:41] and he he's here and he's got a little
[1:40:42] book open and it's the book of
[1:40:45] redemption but watch what's happening
[1:40:47] now this is the action of the of the
[1:40:49] leyan church age it says but in the days
[1:40:51] of the voice of the seventh angel what's
[1:40:53] the seventh angel It's the seventh star
[1:40:55] it's the seventh spirit it's the seventh
[1:40:57] Church age messenger so in the v in the
[1:41:00] days of The Voice or the ministry of the
[1:41:02] seventh Church age messenger when he
[1:41:04] shall begin to sound when he shall begin
[1:41:06] to speak well he he shall begin to
[1:41:08] deliver his message it says the mystery
[1:41:10] of God should be finished as he had
[1:41:13] declared to his servants the
[1:41:15] prophets so everything he's been talking
[1:41:18] about the Redemption plan is the mystery
[1:41:21] of God how does does he do it who's he
[1:41:24] going to do it in but what is the
[1:41:25] mystery of God remember brother Brandon
[1:41:27] would preach Christ is the mystery of
[1:41:29] God revealed the Myster of God is Christ
[1:41:32] being revealed so in the seventh Church
[1:41:34] age there's a finishing of the revealing
[1:41:37] of Jesus Christ
[1:41:40] amen where is it I'm looking at it I'm
[1:41:44] looking at it it's the mystery revealing
[1:41:47] of Christ it's the anointing of Christ
[1:41:49] the head is coming down to the body
[1:41:51] they're being joined into one and so the
[1:41:53] finishing revealing of Christ is Christ
[1:41:55] in his bride he did it in the first
[1:41:58] church age he was Alpha and then he said
[1:42:01] I am Alpha and Omega he did not say I am
[1:42:03] Alpha through Omega he said I'm the
[1:42:05] beginning and I'm the end I'm revealed
[1:42:07] in the Beginning church and I'm revealed
[1:42:09] in the end church and it's Christ
[1:42:10] revealing himself and his bride amen and
[1:42:13] what is it it's the word being made
[1:42:15] flesh what's he saying in verse 7 here
[1:42:18] he's saying that the mystery is going to
[1:42:20] be finished the revealing of Christ is
[1:42:22] going to be completed what he started
[1:42:24] 2,000 years ago on the day of Pentecost
[1:42:26] he's finishing in the last Church age
[1:42:28] what's he finishing Church he's
[1:42:30] finishing you he's finishing me that's
[1:42:33] the work that's going on now it's
[1:42:35] finishing changing us as his bride from
[1:42:37] creatures of time into creatures of
[1:42:39] Eternity what's he doing he's molding us
[1:42:41] he's shaping us he's trimming us to
[1:42:43] match the word he's taking out what
[1:42:45] doesn't match and he's putting in what
[1:42:47] will match and he's putting us through
[1:42:49] Tri trials and tribulations and proving
[1:42:51] Us by the word through these things that
[1:42:54] we are Christ again in flesh just little
[1:42:57] bits here and there little
[1:43:00] lights Little Words little
[1:43:03] Messiahs little anointed ones little
[1:43:06] christs that's all Christ means is
[1:43:07] Anointed one he is the Christ the
[1:43:10] anointed one we are Christ we are
[1:43:12] anointed
[1:43:14] ones what's the work that needs to be
[1:43:16] done because we listen to that we say
[1:43:18] whoa wonderful praise the
[1:43:22] Lord this is great I'm the word made
[1:43:25] flesh I'm Christ being revealed to this
[1:43:28] age how does he do it church this is The
[1:43:31] Humbling
[1:43:33] part Revelation
[1:43:35] 3 it says and unto the angel of the
[1:43:38] Church of the leans right this is our
[1:43:40] message this is the voice this is what
[1:43:42] the holy spirit is saying these things
[1:43:44] saith the amen the faithful and true
[1:43:47] witness the beginning of the creation in
[1:43:49] God now we read in Revelation 1 earlier
[1:43:51] it said Jesus Christ who's the Fai ful
[1:43:53] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:43:55] dead and now he's coming back he never
[1:43:57] identifies himself as that until the
[1:43:59] last age why because this is where
[1:44:02] there's going to be another begotten of
[1:44:04] the dead now we've had it spiritually
[1:44:06] because we've been raised as new
[1:44:07] creatures New Creations in Christ but
[1:44:09] there's a literal now raising of the
[1:44:11] dead that's going to happen and it only
[1:44:13] happens in this last Church age didn't
[1:44:15] happen in the first and it didn't happen
[1:44:16] through any of the others that's for
[1:44:17] sure but he comes at the end and he says
[1:44:19] I'm the faithful witness I'm the first
[1:44:21] begotten of the dead and because of that
[1:44:23] now is the time for the rest of the Dead
[1:44:25] to rise now is the rest of the Brethren
[1:44:27] to be revealed because I was the first
[1:44:29] one
[1:44:30] amen he's the first but there's many
[1:44:32] others coming behind he's the first
[1:44:33] begotten among many Brethren and his his
[1:44:36] identity here is amen what is amen so be
[1:44:40] it it's the finishing of the work it's
[1:44:44] time for it all to get wrapped up it's
[1:44:45] time for all to happen here what he's
[1:44:48] doing is he's saying I'm it's the I'm
[1:44:49] the amen it's going to happen I'm the
[1:44:51] faithful and true witness what I
[1:44:53] promised is about to occur I'm going to
[1:44:55] do what I said I'm going to do it
[1:44:56] doesn't look like I'm doing it maybe it
[1:44:58] doesn't look like it's a good time it
[1:45:00] doesn't look like anybody believes but
[1:45:02] regardless I'm going to do
[1:45:04] it I'm going to do it in the darkest of
[1:45:07] The Darkest Hours Church in the most
[1:45:10] horrible conditions possible when people
[1:45:12] are religious but they're not real
[1:45:14] Believers they're warped they're Twisted
[1:45:16] the Earth is going into destruction
[1:45:18] that's when God says I'm faithful and
[1:45:20] true I'm the amen it's going to happen
[1:45:24] in the worst possible time God says here
[1:45:26] I come ready or
[1:45:30] not little bride are you
[1:45:33] ready and he sends a messenger to get
[1:45:36] her ready to receive her
[1:45:40] promise but I want you to look at the
[1:45:42] condition of the people here in verse
[1:45:44] 15 because this is the message to every
[1:45:49] person of this age including me
[1:45:54] including you whether you'll realize it
[1:45:55] or not see we think I raised in the
[1:45:58] message I don't this doesn't apply to me
[1:46:01] this applies to every single one of us
[1:46:04] church
[1:46:06] amen it says I Know Thy works that thou
[1:46:09] art neither cold nor hot I would thou W
[1:46:12] cold or hot he says you're not cold or
[1:46:13] hot I want you to be cold or hot he says
[1:46:16] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:46:18] neither cold nor hot I'll spew thee out
[1:46:20] of my mouth he says I know th sorry he
[1:46:24] says because
[1:46:25] why but catch this out in 16 he says
[1:46:28] because you're lukewarm you're not cold
[1:46:30] or heart God hates it when people are
[1:46:32] half in and half out there's no such
[1:46:34] thing as a half
[1:46:36] Christian you're either in or you're out
[1:46:39] there's no one on the fence God hates
[1:46:41] compromise and God hates lip service
[1:46:43] without a life that will act on what you
[1:46:46] say he spits it out their sacrifice such
[1:46:49] as it is isn't even accepted by him but
[1:46:52] catch the condition now and remember the
[1:46:55] condition for every age is a spiritual
[1:46:57] Condition it's not a natural condition
[1:46:59] they may have it naturally but what
[1:47:00] God's looking at is their spiritual
[1:47:02] condition because that's what he's
[1:47:03] coming to change he says because thou
[1:47:06] sayest Church what I think of myself has
[1:47:11] zero influence on who I really am if I
[1:47:15] think I'm great that don't make me great
[1:47:17] if God says I'm great I'm great but if I
[1:47:20] think I say I'm great and God says I'm
[1:47:21] not guess what I'm not no matter how
[1:47:23] much I might tell myself I'm
[1:47:26] great he says because thou sayest
[1:47:29] because you say I am rich increase with
[1:47:32] goods and have need of nothing and
[1:47:34] knowest not that thou are wretched
[1:47:36] miserable poor blind and naked what a
[1:47:41] contrast think you're rich increase with
[1:47:43] Goods you have you don't need anything
[1:47:45] and he says you're wretched miserable
[1:47:47] poor blind oh and you're naked this is
[1:47:51] their spiritual condition it's a
[1:47:53] religious attitude it's a religious
[1:47:56] attitude that claims to be a Christian
[1:47:58] because of what they have rather than
[1:48:02] what they
[1:48:04] are now church that ought to be a
[1:48:06] warning to this message because we can
[1:48:09] sit here and say I have a message I have
[1:48:13] a
[1:48:15] messenger but that's what you
[1:48:18] have have you become it
[1:48:23] there's there was thousands on thousands
[1:48:26] heard Jesus message when he was here but
[1:48:29] how many received it how many became
[1:48:32] it 120 on the day of Pentecost out of
[1:48:35] the thousands that ate the bread and the
[1:48:38] and the fishes and got healed only 120
[1:48:43] stayed through out of all of those to
[1:48:45] receive the holy ghost that first day
[1:48:48] yes they brought others in but there was
[1:48:49] only 120 that stayed through all the way
[1:48:52] through of this and actually received
[1:48:54] the word and were changed by it amen
[1:48:56] Christ is life he's not just
[1:48:58] Doctrine amen he's overcoming power not
[1:49:01] convincing words remember what Paul said
[1:49:03] I I he said I I I I I wasn't going to
[1:49:05] come to you with enticing words of men
[1:49:07] but in the power of his
[1:49:10] resurrection amen his words are spirit
[1:49:12] and life and if all we've got is a good
[1:49:14] theological argument if all we've got is
[1:49:16] perfect Doctrine Church guess what we're
[1:49:19] right here that's where we sit can I
[1:49:22] live it that's that's what I care about
[1:49:24] I say God give me a revelation that I
[1:49:27] can live rather than just talk about
[1:49:30] help me not to live so far above my
[1:49:32] Revelation so far below it that I look
[1:49:35] like a
[1:49:39] hypocrite remember what Paul said Paul
[1:49:42] said you can have all the
[1:49:43] gifts you can prophesy you can have all
[1:49:46] Faith he says without charity you're
[1:49:48] nothing and that word charity is agape
[1:49:50] which is it is God's love it is the Holy
[1:49:53] Ghost without the Holy Ghost we are
[1:49:56] nothing God says without it you're
[1:49:58] hopeless you're poor spiritually you
[1:50:00] have nothing to
[1:50:01] Value but this is God's way he never
[1:50:04] leaves us without a remedy he says I
[1:50:06] counsel thee here's my advice he says
[1:50:09] here's my way of doing it buy of me gold
[1:50:11] tried in the fire that's Godly character
[1:50:14] and notice it's always through the fire
[1:50:16] it has to be tested it has to be tried
[1:50:18] Paul says that the trial of our faith is
[1:50:20] is what more precious than gold
[1:50:24] because it proves we've got the real
[1:50:27] deal that's why we come through it and
[1:50:29] we say I'm glad I went through it didn't
[1:50:32] enjoy it perhaps but I'm glad I went
[1:50:35] through it because I see now he's
[1:50:37] working in my life and I've got
[1:50:38] something that it doesn't that doesn't
[1:50:39] go away with circumstances he says buy
[1:50:42] me gold tried in the fire get Godly
[1:50:44] character that thou mayest be rich The
[1:50:46] Riches of Christ Our
[1:50:48] character he says I'm white rment which
[1:50:50] is what the righteousness of Christ that
[1:50:52] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:50:54] shame of thy nakedness do not appear see
[1:50:57] remember what they said he said thou
[1:50:59] sayest if I wrap myself in what I think
[1:51:02] of
[1:51:03] myself it doesn't hide
[1:51:05] anything it's hypocritical it's
[1:51:07] see-through the emperor has no clothes
[1:51:10] but if I can wrap myself in what he
[1:51:13] is one it'll keep me
[1:51:16] humble two it'll keep me dependent on
[1:51:19] him
[1:51:24] that's what he's looking for that the
[1:51:26] shame of thy
[1:51:28] nakedness we've all got things we don't
[1:51:30] want seen under these
[1:51:32] clothes amen it's why we need clothes to
[1:51:35] hide the little things so he can work on
[1:51:38] them under the shelter of his blood
[1:51:41] under the shelter of his righteousness
[1:51:44] and it's Pride that would make us take
[1:51:45] those things off amen but if we wrap
[1:51:48] ourselves in him he'll do a work amen he
[1:51:52] says and then anoint thine eyes with
[1:51:54] isav that thou mayest see isav is always
[1:51:56] Revelation and here's the thing that
[1:51:59] only comes from
[1:52:01] him that takes the Holy Ghost to do that
[1:52:04] amen remember what Jesus said Blessed Be
[1:52:06] Your Eyes for they see the things of God
[1:52:08] and they didn't even understand it but
[1:52:11] when they got the Holy Ghost all of a
[1:52:12] sudden things started clicking they
[1:52:14] started to place things in the scripture
[1:52:15] and they started to see where they were
[1:52:17] they started to who were started to see
[1:52:18] who they were but there's a people that
[1:52:20] don't want to see any more than what
[1:52:22] they have
[1:52:23] they're happy with what they're ha what
[1:52:25] they have they're happy with their
[1:52:26] denomination they're happy with their
[1:52:27] Creed they're happy with their Community
[1:52:29] they're happy their soul is satisfied
[1:52:31] with it and they don't want to move any
[1:52:33] further but it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:52:35] put a hunger and a thirst to open our
[1:52:37] eyes to see that there's more than what
[1:52:38] we have right now no matter how much we
[1:52:42] have catch this now he says as many as I
[1:52:44] love I rebuke and chasen so the message
[1:52:47] for this age doesn't coddle us we read
[1:52:49] so much that is encouraging from The
[1:52:51] Prophet's message don't we but I'll tell
[1:52:53] you what he doesn't hold he doesn't pull
[1:52:55] his punches he calls it the way it is
[1:52:58] and he lays it in our lap and now we've
[1:53:00] got a decision to make will we receive
[1:53:01] it or will we not and he says what as
[1:53:04] many as I rebuke I love I rebuke and
[1:53:07] chasen that's his that that that's his
[1:53:10] action but watch the response now of the
[1:53:12] Overcomer be zealous therefore and
[1:53:16] repent the Overcomer response for this
[1:53:19] age is to say I'm not what I thought I
[1:53:21] was I'm not yet what I ought to be no
[1:53:24] matter how great our UPC up coming our
[1:53:28] upbringing how great our ministry how
[1:53:29] great our church how great our family
[1:53:31] amen it's to realize that occasionally
[1:53:34] we get into a place of spiritual
[1:53:35] arrogance and pride and we need to say
[1:53:37] you know
[1:53:38] what I didn't know what I was talking
[1:53:42] about I don't have what I thought I had
[1:53:46] and usually that takes some
[1:53:48] trials to knock us off of our high
[1:53:50] pedestals and our high horses and we see
[1:53:53] that we knew nothing as we ought to or
[1:53:55] we should have known or we thought we
[1:53:56] did for
[1:53:57] sure but watch this now in verse 20 he
[1:54:01] says behold I stand at the door and
[1:54:03] knock Christ is outside of the nominal
[1:54:05] church because they've got so much stuff
[1:54:07] religious and natural they don't need
[1:54:08] him anymore so he's out completely and
[1:54:11] he says if any man hear my voice and
[1:54:13] open the door I will come into him and
[1:54:15] will Su with him and he with me it's an
[1:54:18] individual Affair but I've talked about
[1:54:19] this before so I won't belabor the point
[1:54:21] but no he says If any man hear my voice
[1:54:23] there's only one voice in this age and
[1:54:26] that's the messenger's voice that's the
[1:54:28] Holy Spirit speaking says he that ha an
[1:54:30] ear let him hear what the spirit's
[1:54:32] saying what's he saying he's speaking
[1:54:33] through a messenger and he's telling us
[1:54:36] what our condition is and he's telling
[1:54:37] us what our remedy is and now we get a
[1:54:40] choice do we take it or do we leave it
[1:54:42] he says if any man hear my voice and
[1:54:43] open the door I'll come into him and
[1:54:45] will Su with him and he with me it's an
[1:54:47] individual Affair now here's the reward
[1:54:50] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:54:51] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:54:54] overcame and am set down with my father
[1:54:57] in his throne he that have an ear let
[1:55:00] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:55:02] churches now we talked about he's got a
[1:55:04] a spotless bride he's got a glorious
[1:55:06] bride and and we are Christ revealed in
[1:55:08] this age but look at that condition that
[1:55:10] we just read about that's what we have
[1:55:13] to come out of we've got to come out of
[1:55:15] that condition and come into a Christ
[1:55:16] condition into a work condition amen and
[1:55:19] out of this these are these are horrible
[1:55:23] people we're horrible
[1:55:26] people before we receive Christ we're
[1:55:29] horrible and the most horrible of us are
[1:55:32] the religious
[1:55:34] ones that's the sad
[1:55:36] truth it's the religious ones that think
[1:55:39] we have something and yet we don't and
[1:55:40] yet God comes down he says I'm faithful
[1:55:42] and true and I'm going to bring you out
[1:55:44] of this into a Rapture Ready condition
[1:55:48] Hallelujah that's where we're sitting
[1:55:50] this evening amen he says I'm coming
[1:55:52] down and I'm going to put an end to it
[1:55:53] all you won't stop me your flaws your
[1:55:56] failures I'll put you through the fire
[1:55:59] I'll wrap you in my righteousness I'll
[1:56:00] cover you in my blood I'll wash you with
[1:56:02] my word I'll let you see who you are as
[1:56:06] you see me revealed in you and it'll
[1:56:08] raise your faith until the very end and
[1:56:10] you'll go into Rapture amen he says I'm
[1:56:13] going to come down I'm going to dwell in
[1:56:14] my bride I'm going to give her my life
[1:56:17] and she will be me in this age One Last
[1:56:20] Time Alpha becomes Omega
[1:56:24] he's faithful church this is the age
[1:56:26] where he says I am faithful and I am
[1:56:28] true he says it nowhere else except
[1:56:31] right here this is the time where he's
[1:56:33] revealed as faithful and true the book
[1:56:36] is open and he's here to claim his bride
[1:56:38] and his bride's got to be made ready
[1:56:40] before he can claim her Jesus only asked
[1:56:43] one question of this age do you remember
[1:56:44] what it
[1:56:47] was he says Jesus never asked will I
[1:56:49] find
[1:56:50] righteousness will I find people people
[1:56:52] that's living good Jesus said will I
[1:56:54] find faith when I return somebody oh
[1:56:58] they say I got faith he says well faith
[1:57:00] without works is
[1:57:01] dead what does faith mean he says will I
[1:57:05] find someone who will stand at my word
[1:57:07] and say every words right I'm not scared
[1:57:11] whether this one says so or that one
[1:57:13] says so or nothing I believe in God and
[1:57:15] I'm accepting it and standing right
[1:57:17] there on it he says that's the thing God
[1:57:19] is preparing a church today to be saved
[1:57:22] just as he did in the days of Noah and
[1:57:24] that Ark he says and the body of Christ
[1:57:28] today is that
[1:57:30] Ark do you realize what he's saying
[1:57:32] there we have a lot of people today
[1:57:34] saying I'm
[1:57:36] saved he's saying there's only one
[1:57:38] salvation today and that's to be in the
[1:57:40] body of Christ and how do you get in the
[1:57:42] body of Christ Church it is not saying I
[1:57:45] accept Jesus as my savior it is not
[1:57:48] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:50] Christ Paul said by one Spirit we are
[1:57:55] baptized into that body you can do the
[1:57:58] first two and never go in this age there
[1:58:01] is only one Arc and it is by the baptism
[1:58:04] of the Holy Ghost in our individual
[1:58:05] lives and that joins us to the body of
[1:58:07] Christ everyone else has to go through
[1:58:10] tribulation they have to give their
[1:58:12] lives for it and then they have to come
[1:58:13] up and go through a
[1:58:15] judgment there's only one Ark today and
[1:58:17] it's by the Holy Ghost and that's to be
[1:58:19] baptized into the body of Christ
[1:58:21] otherwise we Face judgment
[1:58:22] judgement what's he finishing his
[1:58:25] Redemption work and his Redemption work
[1:58:28] is you and me it's a body that he's
[1:58:30] prepared it's a glorious church it's a
[1:58:32] glorious bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:58:34] and who's he coming for people that will
[1:58:36] take him at his word that's who he's
[1:58:38] coming for people who will take him at
[1:58:41] his word not perfect in
[1:58:43] themselves but people that will stand on
[1:58:46] the word no matter what happens and it's
[1:58:48] people that will repent of their halfway
[1:58:50] living I say God help me not to be a
[1:58:53] Halfway
[1:58:57] Christian God helped me not to be a 90%
[1:59:01] Christian see most of us won't identify
[1:59:04] with the halfway will we If we're honest
[1:59:06] but how many will say I'm 100%
[1:59:09] in I am completely on board with the
[1:59:13] word of
[1:59:15] God that's what he's looking for not a
[1:59:18] 90 not a 90 hey if we were in school how
[1:59:22] many here be happy with a
[1:59:23] 90%
[1:59:25] 95%
[1:59:27] 98% 99% God says you got to be in all
[1:59:31] the way you need to be
[1:59:32] 100% on board with
[1:59:35] this and that means we got to repent and
[1:59:38] we got to lay things aside we've got to
[1:59:40] keep looking at this word and how many
[1:59:42] times have I told us listen Our Lives go
[1:59:45] through a continuous
[1:59:48] sanctification there are things I used
[1:59:50] to do in my 20s that I didn't do in my
[1:59:52] my 30s there are things that I did in my
[1:59:54] 30s that I don't do in my 40s and no
[1:59:56] doubt there's things in my 40s that I
[1:59:57] won't do if I ever make it to 50 because
[2:00:00] God is continuously pulling us away from
[2:00:02] things not that they're wrong it's that
[2:00:05] they're not
[2:00:06] needful they don't edify us we've got
[2:00:10] better things we can be doing with our
[2:00:11] time we've got better things we can do
[2:00:12] with our money we've got better things
[2:00:14] we can do with our influence we've got
[2:00:15] better things we can do with our gifts
[2:00:17] and so God what does he do he brings us
[2:00:18] down he Narrows our Focus until we're
[2:00:21] walking and living in the word day by
[2:00:26] day I believe the prophet of God said
[2:00:28] something along the lines he said I sin
[2:00:30] a thousand times a day and I Repent
[2:00:32] every
[2:00:34] night I'm not resting in the fact that
[2:00:37] I'm going to be
[2:00:38] perfect but I will live by the word of
[2:00:42] God and every aspect of my life will be
[2:00:44] in line with that word amen this is a
[2:00:48] people that will humble themselves to
[2:00:49] the word and see it's not one big
[2:00:52] movement is we we've understood this and
[2:00:54] we've talked about this before that the
[2:00:56] Rapture is not an event it's a
[2:01:00] process and that process includes people
[2:01:02] that are being built up word upon word
[2:01:05] line upon line here a little there a
[2:01:07] little just a little step a day a little
[2:01:09] step a day a little step a day you can
[2:01:11] go a long ways just going one step a
[2:01:14] day go 10 steps a day you'll get there a
[2:01:17] little quicker but God's just doing a
[2:01:18] work constantly building us up building
[2:01:22] us up and we don't realize it so often
[2:01:24] until we come to those trials and we
[2:01:26] realize oh my goodness I got something I
[2:01:28] didn't have last year I've made progress
[2:01:32] I'm growing in Christ I've got a
[2:01:35] testimony I've got strength I've got
[2:01:37] power I've receive something beyond what
[2:01:39] I've had
[2:01:40] before and we start to realize he's
[2:01:43] working on me I'm going to make
[2:01:46] it cuz he doesn't start a work unless
[2:01:48] he's going to finish it and he doesn't
[2:01:50] give a word unless he's going to fulfill
[2:01:51] it
[2:01:54] he started that work and we have to
[2:01:55] trust that he's come down personally to
[2:01:58] finish it and join himself to us amen
[2:02:00] remember Ruth Ruth had all of her stages
[2:02:02] remember but at the end Ruth after all
[2:02:05] of her faith and all of her Works she
[2:02:07] had to rest in one thing and that's that
[2:02:10] Boaz had promised he'd take her to
[2:02:13] wife remember what the scripture says it
[2:02:15] says this is Naomi speaking to her she
[2:02:17] said sit still my
[2:02:18] daughter Ruth take your rest don't walk
[2:02:22] around don't be fretting don't be
[2:02:24] worrying sit down he's prepared food for
[2:02:27] you he sent you home with enough food to
[2:02:30] take you through sit down and have a
[2:02:33] meal Feast on what he's given you she
[2:02:36] said for until thou know how the matter
[2:02:39] will fall she says for the man will not
[2:02:41] be in rest until he had finished the
[2:02:44] thing this
[2:02:47] day as we close this is our opening
[2:02:50] scripture and we focus more on what he
[2:02:52] does but having heard all
[2:02:55] this when we read Hebrews again it says
[2:02:58] let us hold fast that's our part let us
[2:03:01] hold fast let us lay hold of the word
[2:03:03] let us have faith in it let us trust it
[2:03:05] let us testify of it let us confess it
[2:03:08] let us hold fast the profession of our
[2:03:11] faith without wavering why because he is
[2:03:15] faithful that
[2:03:18] promised he's the faithful one I'm just
[2:03:21] holding on to the faithful one this
[2:03:23] evening
[2:03:25] amen one
[2:03:27] quote three parts my ADV advice to you
[2:03:30] is this don't look at the Modern things
[2:03:32] around you the popularity and the
[2:03:34] glamour you could be but choose rather
[2:03:37] by faith him that gave the promise that
[2:03:39] someday he will come and write all
[2:03:41] wrongs and will give you eternal life
[2:03:43] and raise you up no matter if you take
[2:03:45] the despised way with the Lord's few
[2:03:48] make that
[2:03:49] choice if there are troubles in hand
[2:03:52] if there are troubles in the land if
[2:03:54] there are troubles in the church if
[2:03:55] there are troubles in the home no matter
[2:03:57] where it is make your choice by faith
[2:03:59] I'll serve God I'll humble my heart in
[2:04:02] his presence I'll take the way with
[2:04:04] God's children I see them despised and
[2:04:07] rejected and drove out and made fun of
[2:04:09] but I'll still take my post of Duty I'll
[2:04:12] stay right by and when they cry I'll cry
[2:04:14] with them and when they sorrow I'll
[2:04:16] sorrow with them the way they live I'll
[2:04:18] live like Ruth said to Naomi your ways
[2:04:21] will be my ways my ways will be your
[2:04:24] ways where you live I'll live where you
[2:04:26] go I'll go the god that you serve will
[2:04:29] be my God he says take that choice
[2:04:31] though it pulls the very skin off your
[2:04:33] conscience of thinking that you're
[2:04:37] somebody that's the thing we have to
[2:04:39] lose out of all of this is that we are
[2:04:41] only special because he chose us not
[2:04:44] because of anything we're bringing to
[2:04:46] the
[2:04:46] table he says skin yourself down and
[2:04:50] take your way with the Lord's dis desise
[2:04:52] few and stay loyal on the field of
[2:04:54] service and at the post of Duty amen God
[2:04:59] bless you let's stand if we would as the
[2:05:01] musicians
[2:05:04] come amen he never said it was an easy
[2:05:07] Road never said it wouldn't be dark
[2:05:10] didn't say it wouldn't be difficult
[2:05:11] didn't say we wouldn't face trials
[2:05:13] Temptations hurts offenses
[2:05:17] disappointments but he said I'll be with
[2:05:19] you I'll even be in you
[2:05:22] Till the End of the Age and me that's
[2:05:24] the faithful and true thing I'm holding
[2:05:26] on to I fall every day I disappoint
[2:05:29] myself if I don't disappoint him I
[2:05:30] disappoint myself every single day but
[2:05:33] yet I Look to Him and I say God you
[2:05:35] called me you've placed me you've done a
[2:05:37] work in my life and that's what I'm
[2:05:38] trusting in is that he who started the
[2:05:41] work will be faithful to complete it
[2:05:43] amen that's our rest tonight don't look
[2:05:45] to
[2:05:46] yourself don't get yourself down over
[2:05:49] what you've done over what you've not
[2:05:51] done over over where you're at it's his
[2:05:53] promise that's going to get us through
[2:05:55] to the End Amen it's his faithfulness
[2:05:57] it's the fact that he can't lie that
[2:05:59] he's prepared us to receive his word and
[2:06:02] produce it that's going to get us
[2:06:03] through amen God bless you each one
