[33:50] thankful for that
[34:01] first of all
[34:03] to thank God for this great privilege I
[34:06] have
[34:07] become amen
[34:09] fellowship with this part of the Bride
[34:12] of Christ
[34:13] hey man
[34:16] I think gone for his salvation
[34:18] and we don't have any of our own
[34:22] what is his salvation and
[34:24] it's a great honor to know that we are a
[34:27] part of his bride hey
[34:29] hey man
[34:32] andwho fellowship with such Saints upon
[34:36] the face of the earth
[34:37] because I know you're the apple of his
[34:39] high yeah and
[34:42] it's a great privilege just to be called
[34:46] a brother or a sister in this great
[34:49] endtime message I want to bring
[34:53] greetings from the group in iron Falls
[34:57] as you know we lost our pastor
[35:00] but God see us through you know he said
[35:04] he'd never leave us nor forsake us and
[35:06] he will provide a
[35:09] man because he loves his Rebekah
[35:14] we are in the tent with him
[35:17] getting ready to bring forth the sons of
[35:20] God not on the earth I believe that the
[35:23] bride is sugilite bring forth the sons
[35:26] resurrection as we sang the first course
[35:30] word of God never true changing me and
[35:35] changing you a man and that's what it's
[35:37] all about a change in this hour I
[35:39] believe that God is changing us for
[35:43] mortal dream mortality
[35:46] and the song that I want to sing tonight
[35:48] it's a testimony really it's my personal
[35:52] actually
[35:53] this was me
[35:55] but God
[35:57] delivered me as he delivered you right
[36:01] and has he delivered David David said
[36:04] the Lord is my light he's my strengths
[36:06] and that he's my salvation he's all in
[36:09] all praise the Lord Nene and this song
[36:14] that speaks about sin and if we get away
[36:18] from the Word of God where the devil
[36:21] will take us I believe the brother made
[36:24] reference in this message last night to
[36:26] this
[36:28] brother Karsan told me some of the
[36:31] things he was speaking on so I said this
[36:34] would be a very fitting song to sing
[36:36] that sin will take you further than you
[36:40] want to go
[36:41] amen
[36:44] of course sin is our belief so we must
[36:47] stay with the pure truth
[36:49] because if we disbelieve one word
[36:52] brother Brown said we're insane this
[36:54] kingdom
[36:55] I'm so glad to see you sister combo god

[43:37] eternal house hey
[43:39] why don't we might turn in our Bibles
[43:41] this evening I'd like to
[43:44] just start the Book of Isaiah
[43:47] chapter 53
[43:49] we just like to read verse 1 and
[43:55] we're trying to speak on three words
[44:00] prophecy preeminence and
[44:03] perfection
[44:07] and doesn't seem like we're speaking on
[44:10] it but it last night we tried to
[44:13] approach prophecy as far as a light
[44:17] shining in darkness and and so this
[44:20] evening we just we want to continue with
[44:22] this thought of prophecy but
[44:25] more on the aspect that
[44:28] the prophecy
[44:33] has an effect opponents if it's revealed
[44:35] and so then I want to look at that in
[44:39] the light of these three words so then
[44:42] we'll read right here and
[44:45] I'd like to read also Matthew 11 and
[44:49] verses 25 to 27
[44:53] along with this with this verse here
[45:02] I was listening that brother sing that
[45:04] song tonight and a little bit better
[45:08] than I do
[45:13] I've never been a singer when I was a
[45:15] young boy I remember that my mother sent
[45:20] me and my sister to a Vacation Bible
[45:22] School and of course during Vacation
[45:25] Bible School they're getting ready for
[45:26] their graduation so they get all the
[45:29] children that are that are going to
[45:31] Vacation Bible School and then they kind
[45:34] of like a little choir and you're gonna
[45:36] sing a song when it comes to graduation
[45:37] day for all the parents you know and so
[45:41] then they they had us all lined up when
[45:43] I remember I was up on the on the back
[45:45] tier there and so we were practicing
[45:48] this song and so though the woman that
[45:52] was the Sunday school teacher she said
[45:54] okay wait a minute wait a minute
[45:56] she's
[45:58] Michael
[46:01] would you not sing you're throwing
[46:03] everybody off key in front of you
[46:06] so that was probably my first experience
[46:09] in a Honan and then I always thought I
[46:12] was tone-deaf but I've been told since
[46:14] then I'm not really tone-deaf but I
[46:15] thought when you went lower you knowing
[46:18] the key I would just sing lower and
[46:21] softer and I'd stay right there at the
[46:23] same place the monotone you know and
[46:26] then when to sing higher are just got
[46:27] louder and I thought louder was higher
[46:30] and lower with softer
[46:32] but anyway I got where I thought I could
[46:35] sing you know fairly decent and we had a
[46:38] visiting preacher one time and I don't
[46:40] know you know we get these what we call
[46:42] biorhythms and I don't know if you
[46:44] notice it but sometimes you get up and
[46:46] you go to write and you'd be looking at
[46:48] your hand right and then you say and
[46:51] then you know I could write that good
[46:53] that really looks good and it just seems
[46:56] like it just you know and then you'll
[46:58] get up and then you go to write and its
[47:00] scribbling you can't do nothing with it
[47:02] and you think what what's wrong here it
[47:04] just seems like it's not working right
[47:06] and it's something to do with your
[47:09] bottle rhythms you know I guess but
[47:11] anyway I was up there and and I was I
[47:16] was closing out with a song and as I was
[47:18] singing I thought you know pretty good
[47:24] you know this I'm doing pretty good you
[47:27] know it just sounded like it was really
[47:28] really nice you know so when I got
[47:31] outside the visiting brother he says hmm
[47:34] he says I see you're a little bit like
[47:36] me you can't carry a turn in a bucket
[47:44] so sometimes when we think we're doing
[47:47] pretty good we ain't done all the goods
[47:50] we think we are
[47:51] been in Isaiah 53
[47:54] and we read this
[47:57] who has believed our report and to whom
[48:02] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[48:04] and then also in Matthew 11
[48:08] and
[48:10] in verse 20 and 5 these are the same
[48:16] scriptures that brother Branham used of
[48:18] course when he preached God and
[48:19] simplicity and I just wanted to begin
[48:23] here Matthew 11 verse 25
[48:28] at that time jesus answered and said I
[48:32] think the old Father
[48:34] Florida heaven and earth
[48:36] because thou has hid these things from
[48:40] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[48:43] them unto babes
[48:45] even so father
[48:47] for so it seemed good in thy sight
[48:50] all things are delivered unto me of my
[48:53] father and no man knoweth the son but
[48:58] the father
[48:59] neither North any man the father saved
[49:03] the Son and he to whom the son will
[49:07] reveal him
[49:09] and we bow our heads
[49:11] Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you
[49:14] for your mercy and grace this evening
[49:16] and Lord we thank you for the sense of
[49:20] humor that we might have not to make
[49:23] your house a house of jokes or just
[49:27] laughter but the Lord you want your
[49:30] people to have join their hearts and
[49:32] father I just pray to forgive me for
[49:35] that little comment there of life and
[49:39] how we all go through these things
[49:41] before we seriously in our heart
[49:43] approach the throne of mercies tonight
[49:46] and without you we can do nothing
[49:49] and father I ask that you would just
[49:52] inspire every one of us Lord speaker in
[49:56] here that we might be inspired by you
[49:58] and caught up Lord in the mind of Christ
[50:01] that we might be in one soul one spirit
[50:05] and one Accord and Lord may you anoint
[50:08] us Lord may you pour out your annoying
[50:10] all of your holy spirit
[50:12] father God that you might break any yoke
[50:15] and his federate for that would that
[50:17] would hold us Lord from your presence or
[50:20] from receiving your word
[50:22] father may you bless each one that's
[50:24] come maybe bless our gathering together
[50:27] and may you bless the reading of your
[50:30] word we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[50:35] you all may be seated
[50:38] and we're just talking about
[50:41] prophecy and this is this is one
[50:45] principle that we we learned from the
[50:48] scriptures and that we've been taught in
[50:51] these last days
[50:54] by the holy spirits or a prophet
[50:57] that revelation comes from God it
[51:02] doesn't it doesn't come by man or is the
[51:04] efforts
[51:06] but it comes sovereignly by God as we
[51:09] said last night brother Branham was was
[51:12] talking about in the ever-present water
[51:15] of the rock and how that you and I have
[51:16] enough power to create worlds if we're
[51:19] born again because the life of God is in
[51:21] us and the life of God is gone but he
[51:24] said that power is controlled by law he
[51:28] said there's something restricts that
[51:29] and then he referred to to Jesus Christ
[51:32] and how that when he died he said his
[51:35] body went to the grave he said his
[51:36] spirit went back to God to give it and
[51:38] his soul went down there into hell and
[51:41] he said now he stayed down in there
[51:43] three days and three nights and he said
[51:45] he couldn't rise again because there was
[51:47] a he called it a bar or there was a law
[51:50] and that was the Word of God had held
[51:52] him there three days and three nights
[51:53] because the scripture said it was the
[51:56] sign of Jonah and that he would stay he
[51:59] would stay in hell three days and three
[52:00] nights and on the third day raised again
[52:02] before the corruption set in because he
[52:05] said I not suffer my Holy One to see
[52:07] corruption or soul stay in hell so then
[52:10] the word of God was that limitation or
[52:13] it was that bar that held him not
[52:15] necessarily against his will but to
[52:17] fulfill the word that bar held him so he
[52:20] was talking about that law and that bar
[52:22] and how did it help Christ and it had to
[52:25] come according to the word so then he
[52:27] returns back to this thought oh that
[52:29] you've got enough power now to create
[52:32] worlds but there's a law there's a bar
[52:34] there's something that keeps you from
[52:36] creating that world and doing what you
[52:38] want to do with your human spirit along
[52:40] with the divinity that's in you and the
[52:42] power and the authority that you have so
[52:45] we have authority he said but we don't
[52:47] have power so however much authority you
[52:51] have that's much power that you can
[52:53] exercise or how much faith that you have
[52:56] to use that that power that you have
[52:58] some now the power that's in me now
[53:01] being born again and filled with the
[53:03] Holy Ghost that the limitation of the
[53:06] exercising of that is limited by faith
[53:09] and faith is what operates or releases
[53:12] the power that's within us and he says
[53:15] now God controls that and he said he
[53:19] said now that that's not it's not how
[53:22] obedient you are to the word but he said
[53:25] faith he said it's how much God leads
[53:28] your soul to believe that's how much
[53:31] faith that you have so now God controls
[53:34] the amount of faith and faith is a
[53:36] revelation faith cometh by the hearing
[53:39] of the word now faith is not the hearing
[53:41] of the word but the avenue of the Word
[53:44] of God by an anointed service son of God
[53:47] to bring his word to the people is the
[53:50] Avenue that God can anoint in the heart
[53:53] of an individual to bring faith so faith
[53:56] cometh by the hearing of the word but
[53:58] all it hear the word don't have faith
[54:00] but it's we find it's those that's
[54:03] inspired because the inspiration
[54:05] whatever God leads your soul to believe
[54:08] however much inspiration he brings to
[54:11] you that's how much power that you can
[54:13] have and so then he goes on in the
[54:16] message and he drops back down he says
[54:19] now Israel when she got out there in the
[54:21] wilderness she got her faith got away
[54:23] from her he's there but they didn't lose
[54:25] their covenant but they just they just
[54:27] got away from the faith and then he
[54:29] comes down and then he picks back up
[54:31] where he dropped off and he says now he
[54:34] said you don't need to pray for more
[54:36] power he said but what you need to do is
[54:39] pray for more faith
[54:40] he said what you need to do is live such
[54:44] a godly life that when you pray and your
[54:48] heart doesn't condemn you you can have
[54:49] what you ask
[54:51] so then when I when I'm reading that
[54:53] then faith
[54:55] it releases that power now we're looking
[54:59] for rapturing faith that's a revelation
[55:01] God is going to have to inspire us to
[55:04] bring us to that it's not talking to
[55:07] somebody that's that's resurrected and
[55:09] all of a sudden just a funny feeling but
[55:12] we find that there's faith that's
[55:13] involved into this for God to release
[55:16] that power to change our bodies into a
[55:19] glorified body and so what lies in the
[55:22] key of how much faith that God releases
[55:25] to you and I lays in character because
[55:28] character without power is satanic that
[55:32] doesn't mean that doesn't mean it's
[55:33] going to go out and do devil things and
[55:35] witchcraft things but it means it's
[55:37] going to be operated by that person's
[55:39] self will to achieve what they want in
[55:41] life good bad or ugly doesn't make any
[55:44] difference but character because it's
[55:48] the character of Christ submits itself
[55:50] to the will of God so it doesn't go out
[55:52] here operating power according to its
[55:54] own desires but according to the will of
[55:57] God that's released in that individual
[55:59] and that's what true character is
[56:00] because it's the character of Christ and
[56:03] the character of Christ to be like Jesus
[56:05] it's not just raised them to dead and
[56:07] doing good things but to be like Jesus I
[56:10] come not to do my will but my father's
[56:13] will Paul when he wanted to go a certain
[56:15] direction he had a what maybe he thought
[56:18] was just a leaning of the Spirit he
[56:19] wanted to go a certain way but the Holy
[56:21] Ghost forbade him to go and he didn't
[56:24] keep pushing but he just went the way
[56:25] that God sent him he saw that man over
[56:28] to Macedonia so then he followed the
[56:29] leading of the Lord so there's things
[56:32] that we do we get up we go to work we do
[56:34] things but you know there's times that
[56:35] God intervenes and he tries to inspire
[56:39] us or influence us to do a certain thing
[56:41] and then there's other times that we
[56:44] have the reveal will his reveal will
[56:47] when the Supreme when the scripture says
[56:48] his Commandments you know they that obey
[56:52] His commandments what is that that's his
[56:53] revealed will it's not the Ten
[56:55] Commandments but it's the Word of God
[56:57] it's like the man it's the Word of God
[56:59] in your day the day that you're living
[57:01] and that's the commandments of God when
[57:04] Saul was disobedient to Commandments he
[57:06] said he's left off obeying my
[57:08] Commandments he didn't follow me anymore
[57:09] what was he referring to he was
[57:12] referring to the Word of God that came
[57:14] through Samuel to him to go destroy the
[57:17] Amalekites
[57:18] and so we find it now that when Jesus
[57:21] said he that loves me and obey my
[57:23] Commandments is not obeying in loving
[57:26] the things he wrote here in the Gospels
[57:28] that's part of it but it's what he's
[57:30] speaking today Jesus Christ is saying
[57:32] yesterday today and forever God
[57:35] manifested in his Vail today and
[57:37] speaking to us then that's the
[57:39] commandments that's his revealed will to
[57:41] you and I we have the written wheel we
[57:44] have a
[57:45] reveal will and we have a permissive
[57:48] will but we also have in that a hidden
[57:52] will be finder sometimes in your life
[57:55] God uses natural circumstances to
[57:58] fulfill spiritual circumstances when it
[58:01] came time for Mary and Joseph to go to
[58:04] Jerusalem he didn't he didn't send
[58:07] another angel he didn't send Gabriel and
[58:09] say thou must go to Bethlehem to have
[58:11] this child because so say at the
[58:13] scriptures in the Bible that out of
[58:15] Bethlehem of Judea comes his child he
[58:18] didn't do that what'd he do he caused a
[58:21] tax law and him being from Joseph being
[58:24] from Judea it forced them by the tax law
[58:27] by the government that doesn't seem too
[58:29] divine but it was God bringing to pass a
[58:33] hidden will in a life to put them in a
[58:36] natural circumstance where they could be
[58:39] part of the orchestra of the sheet music
[58:42] to bring forth Jesus Christ from
[58:44] Bethlehem so God has a reveal will he
[58:48] has a permissive will he has a hidden
[58:50] will I remember one time I was I was
[58:53] wanting to in my natural thoughts I was
[58:56] wanting to witness to my to my mother
[58:58] and so I I was supposed to meet her in
[59:00] north of Dallas Texas and that's where
[59:02] my sister and my brother-in-law were
[59:05] living so I got a whole stack of books
[59:06] and I thought this is it I'm going to
[59:08] see my mama and I'm gonna witness to her
[59:11] you know and she said Michael she said I
[59:13] just can't believe that your you're a
[59:14] Christian you're saved she said you
[59:16] least of all the children he said when I
[59:19] oh god save I was just a crude rude
[59:22] atheist just oh my using the Lord's name
[59:25] in vain and just oh I just hate I just
[59:28] sometimes I break out and sweat thinking
[59:30] the things I used to say into them and
[59:33] so I went and when I got out there I
[59:37] heard this voice you know and it was my
[59:41] brother-in-law and we got to talking and
[59:43] he got into it I ended up giving all the
[59:45] books to him now I took the books after
[59:48] from my momma but the Lord wanted me to
[59:51] give the books to my brother-in-law and
[59:53] so sometimes you arrange natural
[59:56] circumstances to put you into a place
[59:58] that you want to use you in a spiritual
[1:00:01] way so then we always have to be
[1:00:03] sensitive to those things are around us
[1:00:05] to feel a little pull feel a little
[1:00:08] little nudge and he don't come to me and
[1:00:10] I've never had him say no Michael I want
[1:00:12] you to do this i I've never heard voices
[1:00:14] that way I have had them speak out of my
[1:00:16] heart and it's just like a different
[1:00:18] voice it's just you know sometimes you
[1:00:21] think you'd be thinking things and then
[1:00:23] then there's all the sudden errs that
[1:00:24] there's a voice that speaks to you and
[1:00:26] you know what's coming out of here but
[1:00:28] yet it's not it's not your own thinking
[1:00:30] and it's another voice I don't know how
[1:00:32] to explain it it's not an audible voice
[1:00:34] but it's a voice is speaking in the
[1:00:36] thoughts of your mind and I'm haven't
[1:00:39] speak that way but so then God's
[1:00:42] commandments is his revealed will to you
[1:00:45] and I there's a written word that's the
[1:00:47] reveal world and there's the voice of
[1:00:49] God to you and I and that's his
[1:00:51] commandment that says that's his
[1:00:53] revealed will and the day that we live
[1:00:55] and so Saul had left off not the Ten
[1:00:58] Commandments he had probably obeying all
[1:00:59] out but he left off following the voice
[1:01:03] of the Prophet and when God accused him
[1:01:06] of that he said he said Samuel Saul has
[1:01:10] left off obeying my Commandments he's
[1:01:12] not following me so in order to follow
[1:01:14] God we've got to follow his Commandments
[1:01:17] jesus said if you love me you'll keep my
[1:01:20] Commandments and if you keep my
[1:01:22] Commandments my father he's going to
[1:01:25] love you and he'll love you and I love
[1:01:29] you and I will manifest myself to you so
[1:01:33] we find that the manifestation of God in
[1:01:37] his veil is hinging or depending upon
[1:01:41] your obedience to His commandments
[1:01:43] but as Commandments it's not it's not
[1:01:46] here in this Bible it says revealed will
[1:01:49] in the day that you're living
[1:01:52] that's what makes prophecy so important
[1:01:55] this Bible how do we know that this is
[1:01:58] God's Bible because in here this book is
[1:02:02] a prophet and the prophecy vindicates
[1:02:06] the book that this is the book from God
[1:02:09] and not man
[1:02:11] because then here is prophecy Israel in
[1:02:14] our homeland it vindicates that this
[1:02:17] book is God's Word because that prophecy
[1:02:20] has come to pass when God said I'm not
[1:02:23] going to speak to you anymore I'm going
[1:02:25] to speak through man and I'll speak
[1:02:27] through my prophets then the first
[1:02:29] question is well how do we know that the
[1:02:33] voice of this prophet is your voice
[1:02:34] because it's false prophets he said when
[1:02:37] that prophet speaks and he speaks a
[1:02:40] vision or dream and it comes to pass
[1:02:44] fear that man
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:47] fear that man because God is with them
[1:02:50] so even the vindication of the Prophet
[1:02:52] is the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:02:55] but then there's also a testing of your
[1:02:59] own hearts and the test of your heart is
[1:03:02] that when a prophet prophecies and it
[1:03:06] comes to pass
[1:03:07] or if he tells a dream and it comes to
[1:03:12] pass
[1:03:13] but he leads you to other gods
[1:03:17] now God is not trying the Prophet he's
[1:03:21] trying your hearts as the Scriptures so
[1:03:25] when he tries your heart is to see
[1:03:28] whether you gonna stay with his word his
[1:03:30] commandments or not or whether you're
[1:03:33] gonna go after the supernatural though
[1:03:35] the voice is a smooth of a stranger and
[1:03:38] not the voice of the word
[1:03:41] and how do we know it's the voice of God
[1:03:43] there's two things he said how do we
[1:03:47] know it's the voice of God he said the
[1:03:49] supernatural always accompanies the
[1:03:52] voice of God to the voice that God will
[1:03:56] always be scriptural so it must be
[1:03:59] scriptural it must be supernatural and
[1:04:03] he tries your heart he's trying to
[1:04:06] hearts of the people that claim to be
[1:04:08] bride today and if a person claims to be
[1:04:11] the church who claims to be the bride
[1:04:13] God will take you at your word but you
[1:04:16] will help be held accountable for the
[1:04:20] position that you take if you say I am
[1:04:22] bride God will hold you accountable for
[1:04:25] the actions of the bride when Saul
[1:04:29] stepped in the position that was not his
[1:04:33] he stepped in the position of a priest
[1:04:36] and that was not his position
[1:04:39] God takes these things very seriously
[1:04:43] that Saul lost the throne and his seed
[1:04:48] after him
[1:04:50] lost all the inheritance of what God had
[1:04:54] taken and that was ripped back from him
[1:04:58] the serpent stepped into a position that
[1:05:03] was not his he stepped into the position
[1:05:06] of Eve's husband and she was he was not
[1:05:09] her husband and he was cursed by that
[1:05:12] now we find men standing in the position
[1:05:16] of a woman and woman trying to stand in
[1:05:19] the position of a man that's a dangerous
[1:05:23] that's a dangerous place to stand in a
[1:05:26] position that's not yours
[1:05:28] ministers people that are called it say
[1:05:31] that through ministers if they're not
[1:05:33] called to be a minister and they've
[1:05:35] taken that position as a minister and
[1:05:38] are not called that's a dangerous
[1:05:40] position to be in
[1:05:42] so the bride must recognize her position
[1:05:45] and you must recognize what God has
[1:05:48] called you to be and that's the position
[1:05:51] that were to be in
[1:05:53] so we don't want to take somebody else's
[1:05:56] position or stand in the position that's
[1:05:58] not ours he said down to the church ages
[1:06:01] he said both the true vine and the false
[1:06:03] vine claimed to be the church so he
[1:06:06] addressed them as the church and held
[1:06:08] them accountable but remember you can
[1:06:11] never be the church without the life of
[1:06:13] God in you you can never fulfill the law
[1:06:16] without the life of the lawgiver in you
[1:06:19] because man cannot fulfill the law in
[1:06:22] his obedience but it takes a sacrifice
[1:06:26] and it takes the life of the law giver
[1:06:29] in you he's not called us to be obedient
[1:06:32] to the law but he has given us the
[1:06:34] FULFILLER of the law and placed his life
[1:06:36] in you and I that thrill life that we
[1:06:39] can fulfill that law
[1:06:42] so now he's going to reveal himself
[1:06:45] he's going to make manifest st. John 14
[1:06:49] he's going to manifest himself or reveal
[1:06:52] himself to those that love him so well I
[1:06:56] love the Lord well how do you know well
[1:06:58] there's a way to test that
[1:07:00] number 1 do you love those that are
[1:07:03] begotten of him
[1:07:04] because if you can't love his children
[1:07:07] you can't love him because the word says
[1:07:09] you can't you say you can't why I love
[1:07:12] him but I don't love you that's not love
[1:07:14] you're in darkness and don't know that
[1:07:16] and your light has become a great
[1:07:19] darkness your revelation has become anti
[1:07:22] word now how do I know that I love him
[1:07:25] how do I know that I have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:28] because the love of God we're talking
[1:07:30] about deity in you we're not talking
[1:07:32] about human affections now we're talking
[1:07:35] about love and the way that Jesus
[1:07:37] discerned he said if you love me he said
[1:07:41] this this is this is the attribute of
[1:07:44] the love of Jesus Christ is that you
[1:07:47] obey my Commandments turn to st. John 14
[1:07:51] so we can read that because this this
[1:07:53] isn't the same thought that we're in
[1:07:57] this list you can see this
[1:08:00] st. John 14
[1:08:05] and look at verse 20 now verse 20
[1:08:09] doesn't seem to be a prophecy but it is
[1:08:12] because brother Branham will be fearing
[1:08:14] that Saint John 14 and 20 said at that
[1:08:17] day he said now that day is this day so
[1:08:20] then that makes that prophecy because
[1:08:22] it's saying that that day when that day
[1:08:24] that he's talking about when this day
[1:08:26] comes that I'm sneaking of so this is
[1:08:29] prophecy
[1:08:30] at that day ye shall know that I'm and
[1:08:35] my father and my father and me and I on
[1:08:38] you and that's different as we were
[1:08:40] saying last night when he says Philip
[1:08:43] have I been so long with me as you don't
[1:08:45] know who I am when you've seen me you've
[1:08:47] seen the father if if your revelation
[1:08:51] had progressed while you walked with me
[1:08:53] you woulda known that I am Jehovah God
[1:08:56] in flesh and you would have known when
[1:09:00] you looked at me you'd be looking at God
[1:09:01] in flesh that revelation is held down
[1:09:04] through the church ages to the True Vine
[1:09:06] but now there comes an evolving of this
[1:09:10] and even though we've had it in an
[1:09:12] earnest because the Holy Ghost has been
[1:09:14] in an earnest bringing man to a
[1:09:17] resurrection but now the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:20] in its fullness now the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:22] not measured in quarts pounds ounces
[1:09:25] it's not it's not measured in anything
[1:09:28] like that it's measured in the amount of
[1:09:30] Revelation you have that's how much Holy
[1:09:34] Ghost that you have
[1:09:35] you're not going to you're not going to
[1:09:38] get more Holy Ghost more quantity wise
[1:09:40] but you will get it more in Revelation
[1:09:44] because the more revelation that you
[1:09:46] have the more faith that you have the
[1:09:48] more power you have the more
[1:09:50] manifestation of the life of God that
[1:09:52] you have in you in character and in
[1:09:55] demonstration according to his desires
[1:09:58] and will now watch verse 21 he that hath
[1:10:03] my Commandments and keepeth him now
[1:10:06] remember his Commandments is not the Ten
[1:10:08] Commandments it's not the law of Moses
[1:10:10] because he said I'm gonna write this in
[1:10:12] your heart we're in a new covenant he's
[1:10:14] not talking about the Old Covenant so
[1:10:17] what is the commandments it's the voice
[1:10:18] of God to you so in this day it's the
[1:10:22] voice of Malachi 4 it's not it's the
[1:10:25] punt it's the voice of Paul it's the
[1:10:27] voice of Peter but now we have a
[1:10:30] commandment because the Lord shall
[1:10:33] descend with a shout that's a message so
[1:10:38] he's not coming to repeat something he's
[1:10:40] coming to tell us something he's he
[1:10:42] going to open up his word it's something
[1:10:45] that he's not said until now so this is
[1:10:47] a new commandment even though there is
[1:10:50] no new Commandments he said I won't do a
[1:10:53] new thing but behold he said everything
[1:10:56] is under the Sun that's already been
[1:10:57] done but before I do a new thing I'm
[1:10:59] going to tell you of that
[1:11:02] so it's new but it's not new you know up
[1:11:06] is not always up up is deemed to be
[1:11:10] exalted you've got to first come down to
[1:11:13] humility and we're not talking about
[1:11:15] pimps and crawling around on steps and
[1:11:18] going up and kissing across we're
[1:11:20] talking about self will when self will
[1:11:23] is put under submission by your own
[1:11:26] desire and love to the will of God that
[1:11:28] you have willingly by loving constraint
[1:11:33] sacrifice your own self will for his
[1:11:36] will that you militant
[1:11:39] it's not it's not if it's me it's not
[1:11:42] wearing plain clothes
[1:11:44] it's not getting on your knees until
[1:11:46] they're bloody
[1:11:51] you know
[1:11:53] we have preconceived ideas I
[1:11:57] was thinking along the line of prophecy
[1:12:00] and we have preconceived revelation and
[1:12:05] we have in our body we have voluntary
[1:12:08] reactions I want to turn this page so I
[1:12:11] I reached down here I turn the page
[1:12:13] that's a voluntary reaction but my heart
[1:12:17] is pumping
[1:12:17] ain't making that heart pump that's an
[1:12:20] involuntary reaction
[1:12:22] so I don't know if you realize it or not
[1:12:24] but there's involuntary reactions in our
[1:12:27] in our spirit
[1:12:29] you pick up the telephone somebody calls
[1:12:32] it's one of these telemarketers you know
[1:12:35] and so I'm a man I just say it's a woman
[1:12:37] I pick it up she says hello you know
[1:12:40] what I automatically do I build a body
[1:12:43] around that voice
[1:12:45] whoever knows that you did that now
[1:12:48] you're not doing it you're not
[1:12:49] fantasizing I'm not talking about lust
[1:12:51] now you pick it up it could be a man you
[1:12:54] listen to him you already got his age
[1:12:56] he's about 55 he's short he's heavy dark
[1:12:59] hair and and then when you meet the guy
[1:13:02] he's tall thin blond hair he's not
[1:13:05] anything like his own that's a
[1:13:06] preconceived conception of what somebody
[1:13:09] is you build a body around that voice I
[1:13:13] remember brother Tim Pruett I don't know
[1:13:14] if y'all know brother tempura little
[1:13:16] short fella I'm short but he's a little
[1:13:18] bit shorter than I am
[1:13:20] and he said he was at a at a convention
[1:13:23] and
[1:13:24] and he met this brother in the hallway
[1:13:27] and he was walking through there and
[1:13:29] this brother stopped and said oh you
[1:13:31] know he said I heard brother Tim
[1:13:33] Pruitt's here he said I sure would like
[1:13:34] to meet him he said oh why don't ya and
[1:13:38] he looked down and on a little short
[1:13:39] power you know and he says no you aren't
[1:13:42] this is ya I am he said I'm brother Tim
[1:13:44] Pruett he says no you're not him he said
[1:13:48] I just listened to him on the tape he's
[1:13:50] about six foot he's got dark hair you
[1:13:53] know I'm big night he said you know him
[1:13:54] he said what my mama called me
[1:13:58] so I find also that when the word of God
[1:14:02] is preached especially when it comes to
[1:14:05] prophecy and we're going to look at this
[1:14:07] in a minute you know you actually you
[1:14:10] actually have a preconceived idea of
[1:14:13] what this prophecy is you don't
[1:14:15] necessarily do it on purpose and some
[1:14:16] people do because they begin to study
[1:14:18] and they begin to sow preconceived when
[1:14:21] I look it up it's something that you can
[1:14:23] see beforehand so before that this
[1:14:26] prophecy is revealed you have a
[1:14:29] preconceived revelation of that prophecy
[1:14:32] and so when that prophecy comes to pass
[1:14:35] you may be like that boy that was in
[1:14:37] that hallway and say that's not if they
[1:14:40] said Jesus you're not him because they
[1:14:43] could not separate his first coming in
[1:14:45] second coming they could not they could
[1:14:48] not understand that how he could be a
[1:14:50] man of sorrow and he could be a king how
[1:14:53] he could retake the throne of David and
[1:14:55] yet be a man that was rejected they
[1:14:57] could not separate the prophecy and the
[1:15:00] church today cannot separate the
[1:15:02] appearing and the coming
[1:15:05] so it's misconceived prophecy so when he
[1:15:09] came they had the prophecy but when they
[1:15:11] looked at him they had a preconceived
[1:15:13] idea brother Brown said they had their
[1:15:15] charts all drawed up and everything and
[1:15:17] he was going to roll out this red rug
[1:15:19] come down the red rug come right down to
[1:15:22] the Sanhedrin and he was going to
[1:15:24] introduce himself because I had a
[1:15:26] preconceived idea of theology of how he
[1:15:29] was coming but when he came in their
[1:15:32] eyes and the illegitimate child I
[1:15:33] thought this can't be God's childish
[1:15:36] cannot be Immanuel they say where'd he
[1:15:38] come from well he comes out of Nazareth
[1:15:41] what and and what's he preaching what's
[1:15:43] he teaching and because the preconceived
[1:15:46] ideas they could not recognize prophecy
[1:15:50] being fulfilled and Jesus said you have
[1:15:53] not recognized your day of visitation he
[1:15:57] said there was a time there was a time
[1:16:00] that God strove with you there was a
[1:16:03] time you could have recognized this but
[1:16:05] now that time has passed and because you
[1:16:09] haven't recognize your damn visitation
[1:16:11] you've rejected it he said there will
[1:16:14] not be one stone laid upon another
[1:16:16] and he refers to that as the rejected
[1:16:20] stone of the builders so as I was
[1:16:24] touching last night if you go to Psalms
[1:16:26] and it talks about that I think it's
[1:16:28] what songs on I forget where I wrote it
[1:16:31] it Psalms 119 that that he refers to
[1:16:34] this stone of stumbling so the stone of
[1:16:37] stumbling is not Jesus Christ the stone
[1:16:40] of stumbling is that word made flesh
[1:16:44] Saint John 1 the subject is not Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ the subject is the word they that
[1:16:52] received him who not Jesus the Word made
[1:16:57] flesh and that day it was Jesus but
[1:17:01] today it's not Jesus people pray in the
[1:17:04] name of Jesus they approach him in the
[1:17:06] name of Jesus and yet they're
[1:17:08] worshipping the devil
[1:17:11] so then it has to be that word made
[1:17:14] manifest so the cornerstone becoming the
[1:17:18] headstone is the word made manifest and
[1:17:21] Jesus Christ was rejected stone but it's
[1:17:26] more than that because Peter come out
[1:17:28] and they said what authority what power
[1:17:30] we did is in he said in the name of
[1:17:33] Jesus he said there's no other name
[1:17:35] under heaven that man might be saved he
[1:17:38] said this is that stone that was
[1:17:41] rejected to the master-builders it
[1:17:44] wasn't just Jesus it was the stone then
[1:17:46] prophecy being made manifest fulfilled
[1:17:50] and then if you go to Peter look at
[1:17:52] first Peter a moment go over the first
[1:17:55] Peter I touched on this last night
[1:18:00] first Peter I think it's first Peter
[1:18:05] first Peter chapter 2 and verse 4 look
[1:18:09] what he says here
[1:18:12] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[1:18:15] now he just got through saying we're
[1:18:18] born again not as a corruptible seed to
[1:18:21] talk about the seed that came from your
[1:18:23] natural father in the womb of your
[1:18:25] natural mother that's a corruptible seed
[1:18:28] but
[1:18:28] being born again
[1:18:31] from above in other words he's now
[1:18:34] bringing to us the same thing that Jesus
[1:18:36] said unless the man be born again from
[1:18:39] above he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:18:42] of God flesh and blood don't enter into
[1:18:44] that
[1:18:45] he ain't talking about a glorified body
[1:18:48] don't have blood in that you and I have
[1:18:50] entered into the kingdom of God because
[1:18:52] we're born again we have been translated
[1:18:56] from the power of darkness into the
[1:18:58] kingdom of his dear son so there's a
[1:19:01] part of me that's already been
[1:19:02] translated and it's dragging my body to
[1:19:06] a translation my theophany or my soul is
[1:19:11] dragging this body it's changing the
[1:19:13] witness's hair they're changing the way
[1:19:16] it does his clothes it's changing the
[1:19:18] way it dresses and the talks and then
[1:19:20] acts that goes to church it sings why
[1:19:22] because there is a life that's dragging
[1:19:26] that body to a body change
[1:19:28] but dressing and whatever changes
[1:19:32] talking will never change it but the
[1:19:35] life that's in there you can talk like
[1:19:37] Jesus you can act like Jesus you can
[1:19:39] dress like Jesus in look like him but
[1:19:42] it's the life of Christ in you that
[1:19:44] makes you Christ a Christian and that
[1:19:47] life is dragging this body to a
[1:19:51] resurrection
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:19:56] so being born again what are the word
[1:19:59] not the word that's preached but the
[1:20:02] Living Word the Word of God that liveth
[1:20:05] and abideth so this word that we're
[1:20:07] talking about is the same one that John
[1:20:10] talks about in in Saint John one as many
[1:20:14] as received him who him the word
[1:20:20] made flesh in this day and
[1:20:23] believed on his name
[1:20:26] not Jesus Christ
[1:20:29] but the word made manifest is the name
[1:20:33] of God
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:35] it's not just believing in Jesus we
[1:20:39] believe in Jesus because there's only
[1:20:40] one approach Jesus Christ the sacrifice
[1:20:45] gave his life for you and I and that's
[1:20:48] the key to our approach to the throne of
[1:20:51] mercy through the blood of Christ that's
[1:20:53] why we pray in the name of the Lord
[1:20:55] Jesus Christ I heard a man preach one
[1:20:58] time he said I pray in the name of the
[1:20:59] son of man he's gonna get nothing
[1:21:01] because the son of man didn't give his
[1:21:04] life Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ gave
[1:21:07] His life and through that name of
[1:21:09] redemption we approach him
[1:21:12] because God Rock redemption in the body
[1:21:16] of Christ a body he had prepared for
[1:21:18] himself and a body is prepared for
[1:21:22] himself today a church a tent the
[1:21:26] tabernacle of David and in there he
[1:21:29] places his his word is Ark no holiest of
[1:21:33] Holies one sacrifice once for all any
[1:21:37] priest could go in there and you were
[1:21:40] made kings and priests and anybody could
[1:21:43] go in the presence of the ark and David
[1:21:46] put recorders in there you know what
[1:21:47] swore because when those priests got in
[1:21:50] there they got anointed they got
[1:21:52] inspired and they sang the Psalms and
[1:21:55] they prophesied and they recorded those
[1:21:57] things and much of the songs is is it
[1:22:00] the priest that entered into that
[1:22:02] sanctuary
[1:22:04] David introduced something else when he
[1:22:08] came down there bringing that Ark they
[1:22:10] were singing they were dancing it was a
[1:22:13] Pentecostal Jubilee and when John saw
[1:22:17] that same Ark
[1:22:19] he began to he began to sing and shout
[1:22:22] till all the heavens was filled and then
[1:22:25] the angels had to come stand back when
[1:22:28] he began to sing read redeemed by the
[1:22:31] blood Allah I am I've been redeemed
[1:22:34] and when the ark came mighty God
[1:22:38] unveiled he said what are they screaming
[1:22:40] about what are they hollered about he
[1:22:43] said they broke through the veils of
[1:22:45] traditions and end his presence
[1:22:49] because the ark
[1:22:52] the word
[1:22:55] the message of the bride
[1:22:58] was coming to his place
[1:23:01] in the belly of John
[1:23:04] hen brother bran said you know why that
[1:23:06] prophet was instructed to read to eat
[1:23:08] that book he said he had to become one
[1:23:11] with him so that is a natural a natural
[1:23:15] allegory to show a spiritual taking
[1:23:19] place so whatever you eat that's what
[1:23:22] you become so whatever that you receive
[1:23:24] my inspiration that's what you are
[1:23:26] you're the word being made manifest
[1:23:32] so when the one that when the tent came
[1:23:35] to perfection when it came to completion
[1:23:38] down at the end of the age down at the
[1:23:40] time that that David looked at it okay
[1:23:44] it's ready let's go get the ark so at
[1:23:48] the end of the age when when the bride
[1:23:50] comes in this day that the last name
[1:23:53] that's on the last on the Lamb's Book of
[1:23:56] Life when it's redeemed the book is shot
[1:24:03] so we're in that dispensation
[1:24:06] so the word now is coming to his place
[1:24:13] the fullness of that word
[1:24:15] so watch what he says here now
[1:24:20] verse four chapter two first Peter to
[1:24:25] whom coming as unto a living stone
[1:24:28] disallowed or rejected indeed of men but
[1:24:32] chosen of God and precious
[1:24:34] ye also as lively
[1:24:38] or living stones
[1:24:40] are built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:24:45] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:24:49] sacrifices
[1:24:50] acceptable to God by Christ so once that
[1:24:54] david offered that sacrifice the only
[1:24:57] sacrifices that was in the tabernacle of
[1:24:59] David was praise and worship and song
[1:25:03] and the lifting up of hands
[1:25:06] gentile dispensation
[1:25:10] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:25:14] scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief
[1:25:17] Cornerstone he lacked precious and he
[1:25:20] that believeth on him shall not be
[1:25:22] confounded shall not be confused shall
[1:25:24] not be ashamed
[1:25:28] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:25:31] precious and who is he the word mate /
[1:25:37] but on to them which misdeal disobedient
[1:25:40] the stone which the builders disallowed
[1:25:44] rejected the same has made the head of
[1:25:47] the corner and a stone of stumbling
[1:25:50] we've come to a time that the
[1:25:52] cornerstone the head stone is coming
[1:25:54] what it's the fulfillment of the
[1:25:56] appearing of Christ that take his bride
[1:25:59] in a resurrection a body change and the
[1:26:03] metre in the air so we're at the
[1:26:05] capstone why because all down to the
[1:26:08] church ages what have we been waiting
[1:26:10] for Paul says he will appear the second
[1:26:14] time
[1:26:15] he has gone into heaven for us what at
[1:26:20] that throne forgiven father our
[1:26:22] intercessor that's Hebrews nine his he
[1:26:27] has gone into heaven to where the true
[1:26:29] Tabernacle the tabernacle that was on
[1:26:32] earth Solomon's Temple was only a shadow
[1:26:35] of the true Tabernacle when Jesus
[1:26:39] ascended he didn't go back to that
[1:26:41] tabernacle that he went to when he was
[1:26:43] 12 years old he went to the true
[1:26:45] tabernacle that was in heaven and there
[1:26:48] on the mercy seat he has appeared for
[1:26:50] you and I down to the church ages what
[1:26:53] for for loozer for Wesley for Pentecost
[1:26:58] for Columba well why was he there for
[1:27:01] them because he wasn't there for the
[1:27:04] sinner
[1:27:05] because the sinner never had claimed the
[1:27:07] sacrifice so then if the sinner he
[1:27:10] doesn't have any blood that's applied
[1:27:12] for him but it's waiting for them if any
[1:27:14] want to take a success today the brother
[1:27:17] Branham said he was sprinkling the blood
[1:27:19] on the mercy seat for the church
[1:27:23] why because Luther was doing what he was
[1:27:27] he had the doctrine of a devil baptizing
[1:27:30] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:27:32] because he had only been released a
[1:27:35] partial restoration of the revelation of
[1:27:39] Paul they could not go any higher than
[1:27:42] the original revelation brought my Paul
[1:27:46] that was the limit that they could go to
[1:27:49] because that's as far as God had
[1:27:51] revealed his word
[1:27:53] and so then when when Luther was killing
[1:27:57] the Anabaptist which they believed they
[1:27:59] disbelieved in child's frequent they
[1:28:02] believed the child went to heaven when
[1:28:04] it died but when you got of age and
[1:28:06] accountability you had to accept Jesus
[1:28:09] Christ as your Savior and be baptized
[1:28:11] they rejected infants wrinkling but
[1:28:14] Luther carried that doctrine from the
[1:28:16] Catholic Church remember the Lutheran
[1:28:18] Church is only the Reformed Catholic
[1:28:20] Church that means that the roots of it
[1:28:23] it's still a Catholic Church because
[1:28:25] it's only the Reformed Catholic Church
[1:28:28] and the Wesleyan Church is only the
[1:28:30] Reformed Lutheran Church the reformed
[1:28:32] Catholic Church because their daughters
[1:28:34] the true vine was never part of the
[1:28:38] Reformed Church our roots does not lay
[1:28:42] in the Reformation
[1:28:45] because the Reformation had children and
[1:28:48] those children were women they was
[1:28:51] harlots and they went back to their mom
[1:28:53] of the but down through the wall
[1:28:56] in these they carried that original
[1:28:58] revelation and the original text which
[1:29:01] became the foundation of the Reformation
[1:29:04] and where that Luther and in the wall in
[1:29:08] these original True Vine when they
[1:29:10] agreed on justification they could come
[1:29:13] together but when Luther failed to
[1:29:16] follow in the opening of the word they
[1:29:18] pulled away they never became we're not
[1:29:21] from the Reformation the reformers was
[1:29:24] only the carrier
[1:29:26] of the life of the team there's been two
[1:29:31] vines they have intermingled but they
[1:29:34] never become one in the same they never
[1:29:36] hybrid
[1:29:38] and so then he was sprinkling for those
[1:29:41] converts under the star of Luther for
[1:29:44] his and father they don't know what they
[1:29:46] do he said he was sprinkling blood on
[1:29:49] the mercy seat interceding for the
[1:29:51] church not the center why would he
[1:29:54] intercede for the center he did that at
[1:29:56] Calvary what they have to do is accept
[1:29:59] the work of Calvary but the church had
[1:30:02] accepted that work but they was in false
[1:30:04] doctrine so Wesley come along penny cuts
[1:30:09] come along he said they were reformers
[1:30:11] they were stars and he called him
[1:30:13] prophets because they spoke by
[1:30:14] inspiration but they were not word
[1:30:16] prophet
[1:30:18] [Applause]
[1:30:22] in your Bible when it talks of the seven
[1:30:26] churches you say it says to the Angel of
[1:30:30] the Church of Ephesus
[1:30:35] but when it comes to Sardis in
[1:30:37] Philadelphia to the Angel of the church
[1:30:40] in
[1:30:40] Philadelphia
[1:30:43] to the Angel of the church in Sardis but
[1:30:47] when it came to lay the sia it says unto
[1:30:50] the Angel of the Church of
[1:30:53] Laodicea
[1:30:56] to word prophets they weren't in the
[1:30:59] church the corrupted church they was of
[1:31:02] the church but they wasn't in that
[1:31:04] church
[1:31:06] you talk about a GPS age oh
[1:31:10] brother Mike I see you just five minutes
[1:31:13] early weren't you what well yeah it was
[1:31:17] and then I can I can stand anywhere and
[1:31:19] if I had the phone setup and I had the
[1:31:21] money I can just say where am i it show
[1:31:24] me the global earth and it showed me a
[1:31:26] Geico where I'm at this is the only age
[1:31:31] that we could recognize
[1:31:34] truly what age we stand in
[1:31:37] because God sent a GPS a prophet the
[1:31:41] shows where we're at in time we talk
[1:31:44] about GPS they haven't got anything but
[1:31:47] what you got through the revelation of
[1:31:49] God's Word in this day and they call it
[1:31:51] paranoia I
[1:31:53] call it revelation
[1:31:56] they call it heretic I call an eternal
[1:32:00] life so watch what he says here verse
[1:32:03] seven on to you therefore which believe
[1:32:06] he is precious but on to them which be
[1:32:10] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:32:12] disallowed the same has made the head of
[1:32:15] the corner a stone of stumbling now this
[1:32:19] stone of stumbling is not Jesus Christ
[1:32:21] the stone of stumbling is the word made
[1:32:25] flesh
[1:32:26] they headstone the capstone coming down
[1:32:28] he said now the capstone is here the
[1:32:31] capstone has become one
[1:32:34] we're not it's not Jesus come down but
[1:32:37] it's a fullness of his word under
[1:32:40] Malachi 4
[1:32:42] revelation 10
[1:32:44] revelation 8 luke 1730 all the
[1:32:47] scriptures that speak of this time it's
[1:32:50] the fullness he said he has poured out
[1:32:52] the fullness of his holy spirit we got
[1:32:55] we ain't got more Holy Spirit than what
[1:32:58] Paul had
[1:32:59] I've had people tell me they didn't have
[1:33:02] the Holy Ghost hey the Holy Ghost is a
[1:33:04] token they said the token couldn't come
[1:33:07] until 63
[1:33:08] well that's funny Paul thought he had
[1:33:12] the token so does that make him a false
[1:33:14] prophet he was circumcised in heart what
[1:33:17] is a circumcision taking out the nature
[1:33:20] of the world taking out the first
[1:33:21] husband taking out the love of the world
[1:33:24] and what comes in the life of God the
[1:33:27] nature we have been become partakers of
[1:33:29] a divine nature
[1:33:31] partakers he wasn't always there but it
[1:33:33] came being born of the incorruptible
[1:33:36] seed which is a Word of God that liveth
[1:33:39] and abideth forever we're talking about
[1:33:41] the anointed inspired Word that lives
[1:33:44] and this headstone is also a living word
[1:33:46] he goes on to say
[1:33:48] the stone of stumbling and a rock of
[1:33:51] offense even to them was stumble at the
[1:33:54] word we're not talking about doctrine
[1:33:57] we're talking about the word knife slash
[1:34:00] what are people stumbling at they're
[1:34:03] stumbling out of God sent a prophet he
[1:34:05] had thus saith the Lord like Paul he
[1:34:08] laid a plumb line he could say any
[1:34:10] revelation he was talking about the
[1:34:13] seals he was talking about the Bible he
[1:34:16] said any revelation that's contrary to
[1:34:20] this revelation is Antichrist
[1:34:24] he said I'm not telling you my thoughts
[1:34:27] about this he said this is what he told
[1:34:30] me he said I'm just telling you what he
[1:34:33] told me to tell you not doing any
[1:34:35] different than isaiah jeremiah throat
[1:34:37] your mind prison that prophet came to
[1:34:41] asia throwed him in prison
[1:34:44] Jeremiah come before handing out
[1:34:47] slapped him in the face
[1:34:48] or Micah slapped him in the face
[1:34:51] he's a word the Spirit of God going it
[1:34:54] left me brother Brad said where at least
[1:34:56] he had that much discernment no he
[1:34:58] didn't have the spirit
[1:35:00] what are they gonna do today same thing
[1:35:04] they rejected the fulfillment of
[1:35:07] prophecy
[1:35:08] now jesus said no man knows the father
[1:35:13] but the son and no man knows the son but
[1:35:15] the father and to whom that he reveals
[1:35:17] himself
[1:35:19] over in isaiah i read to who has
[1:35:23] believed our report
[1:35:25] so the report is a message the report is
[1:35:29] the Word of God and if you go down and
[1:35:32] read it's pertaining to the coming of
[1:35:34] Christ man Asaro rejected what he's done
[1:35:38] but he's talking about Christ he said
[1:35:41] who's believed our report and
[1:35:43] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:35:47] and that word the arm of the Lord means
[1:35:50] the power of God
[1:35:53] it doesn't mean his arm like rope down
[1:35:56] there on days of Babylon but who is the
[1:36:00] power of God revealed to and the only
[1:36:04] way it can be revealed as you have to
[1:36:05] believe the word in other words brother
[1:36:08] Ram said if you believe the report then
[1:36:10] the power of God has been revealed to
[1:36:14] believe this message because he said
[1:36:17] what a resurrection that was what a
[1:36:20] resurrection this is and while we was
[1:36:23] groping in darkness in a denominational
[1:36:26] age he said the great resurrection came
[1:36:29] to you and I in the manifestation of the
[1:36:33] promise of God prophecy being fulfilled
[1:36:36] and to whom has believed our report
[1:36:39] then that the arm of the Lord the power
[1:36:43] of God is revealed to fulfill his word
[1:36:47] we're not talking about praying for the
[1:36:49] sick raising the dead we're talking
[1:36:52] about prophecy
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:55] but he reveals himself to whomsoever he
[1:36:58] will
[1:36:59] and him that believes me and loves me
[1:37:05] second Thessalonians what it said
[1:37:07] because they had not received the love
[1:37:08] of the truth you know what that word you
[1:37:10] read it and he amplified and says they
[1:37:13] didn't they didn't welcome the word they
[1:37:15] didn't welcome the truth they didn't ask
[1:37:18] it into its house they didn't entertain
[1:37:21] it they rejected it and because they had
[1:37:24] not the love of the truth he'll send
[1:37:27] them a strong delusion
[1:37:28] witchcraft he said how can the people be
[1:37:31] we went bewitched because they've
[1:37:35] rejected the word to reject the word and
[1:37:38] so open yourself to him bewitchment an
[1:37:41] imagination that man talks about fantasy
[1:37:44] he is living in a fantasy of darkness
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:48] speaking blasphemous things against God
[1:37:52] like that woman talking to brother
[1:37:55] Brennan said I wouldn't give in my room
[1:37:58] I wouldn't give that religion to my
[1:37:59] account and
[1:38:01] then she laid 9
[1:38:03] send by the Browns in brother Brown when
[1:38:07] he got there she was dead and the
[1:38:09] husband said pray for pray for he said
[1:38:11] well I can't pray for her now she's gone
[1:38:14] now Saints bold
[1:38:17] he'll put it on the television he'll put
[1:38:20] it in the papers like he knows what he's
[1:38:22] doing but I'll take the Word of God
[1:38:25] the headstone prophecy being fulfilled
[1:38:30] now prophecy you and I we we our
[1:38:34] character we we our character our
[1:38:37] conduct is based upon our character
[1:38:41] because the character is what we are
[1:38:44] they call it the personification
[1:38:46] what we are in our characters what we
[1:38:50] are bad man does bad things good man
[1:38:54] does good things you don't expect too
[1:38:57] many good things out of a bad man bad
[1:38:58] character and so out of care here comes
[1:39:02] conduct and conduct is the action or the
[1:39:07] manifestation of what we are in the way
[1:39:09] that we live you
[1:39:12] know I've been in gas stations on on
[1:39:14] trips sometimes and and I'll see a woman
[1:39:17] step out and she'll have long hair and
[1:39:20] the dress and you say hey it might be on
[1:39:24] the message and then here comes her
[1:39:26] husband he's got these little shorts on
[1:39:28] you know long hair he's like no I don't
[1:39:30] guess he is killed or he'll come out he
[1:39:33] said man he looked kind of clean and
[1:39:35] everything I wonder if their message and
[1:39:37] here she comes with her panties they
[1:39:38] know what are you going by you're not
[1:39:41] talking about how nice their and how
[1:39:43] cruel they are but you're looking at the
[1:39:45] way that they express themselves and the
[1:39:47] way that they dress and present
[1:39:49] themselves and God is concerned about
[1:39:51] that we're not Baptists well you know
[1:39:54] just in my heart you know God knows my
[1:39:57] heart listen he knew Judas his heart he
[1:40:00] knew Cain's heart you know I've heard
[1:40:02] people they don't do something and it's
[1:40:04] wrong and they'll say well God knows my
[1:40:07] heart well sure he does the word tells
[1:40:09] me that but do you know because the
[1:40:11] heart is the most deceiving and your own
[1:40:14] heart can deceive you well how do you
[1:40:16] know what's in your heart by the word
[1:40:18] the word is a discerner do you love
[1:40:21] Jesus oh yes I love Jesus what do you
[1:40:24] obey His commandments
[1:40:25] well you get it wrong I don't lie don't
[1:40:29] cheat don't steal I don't have any idol
[1:40:31] no his word his voice the Lord shall
[1:40:34] descend with a shout that was his
[1:40:36] commandment for this done
[1:40:38] and as many as love me will obey my
[1:40:41] Commandments and to him who obeys my
[1:40:44] commandment my father loves and I love
[1:40:47] and he will manifest himself to me
[1:40:51] [Applause]
[1:40:56] so now we find it's manifested word st.
[1:41:00] John 17
[1:41:02] we've really gotten behind her say 17
[1:41:06] verse 2
[1:41:08] as thou has given them power over all
[1:41:12] flesh that he should get
[1:41:16] talking about Christ that he should give
[1:41:19] eternal life to as many as thou has
[1:41:22] given him and this is life eternal
[1:41:27] this is the characteristics of eternal
[1:41:31] life this is what eternal life is this
[1:41:33] is eternal life in other words this is
[1:41:35] the characteristics of eternal life and
[1:41:38] eternal life is what it's God's own life
[1:41:40] and this is life eternal that they might
[1:41:45] know thee the only true God and Jesus
[1:41:49] Christ whom thou has sent so then if I
[1:41:53] have eternal life it reveals to me God
[1:41:57] in his Vail not what he was 2,000 years
[1:42:00] ago hang on a calvary but who he is
[1:42:03] today the holy ghost veiled in human
[1:42:06] vessels
[1:42:07] prophecy being fulfilled and this is
[1:42:12] eternal life he said how do you know you
[1:42:13] have the Holy Ghost he said because you
[1:42:16] receive the word of the hour that's the
[1:42:19] evidence
[1:42:20] so like we were saying last night you
[1:42:23] know we can here's the important thing
[1:42:24] here to me is whether the birth lays
[1:42:28] we find that under brother Brandon's
[1:42:31] ministry there was people that had the
[1:42:34] Holy Ghost and didn't know they had to
[1:42:36] hold a ghost
[1:42:37] so if you have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:42:40] don't have the whole and you don't know
[1:42:41] that you have the Holy Ghost that can be
[1:42:43] detrimental to you because here you are
[1:42:46] seeking for something that you already
[1:42:48] have so you actually open yourself if
[1:42:51] you don't watch out you open yourself to
[1:42:53] a false doctrine
[1:42:56] but at the same time you don't want to
[1:43:00] stop short of being born-again by being
[1:43:04] a Baptist and say when I believe I got
[1:43:06] it you say that's more confusing listen
[1:43:09] when I was trying to find out if I had
[1:43:10] the Holy Ghost I studied everything I
[1:43:13] read the Holy Ghost series I read
[1:43:15] everything he had to say about the Holy
[1:43:17] Ghost and the more I read the more
[1:43:18] confused I got you know what because I
[1:43:21] was looking for something tangible
[1:43:25] but what I found out was that the new
[1:43:29] birth for you knowing that you have the
[1:43:31] new birth that is a birth within itself
[1:43:33] and there's birth pains the only way
[1:43:36] that you can find out is in the word
[1:43:39] you know there's one place in the Bible
[1:43:42] that tells you how to know if you got
[1:43:45] the Holy Ghost you don't even have to
[1:43:47] ask him but you all you got to do is
[1:43:48] open your Bible to read it it's first
[1:43:51] John 5 he said I have written this that
[1:43:56] you might know you have eternal life
[1:43:59] now I've got it written I can turn to it
[1:44:03] anytime have I got eternal life and if
[1:44:05] you got eternal life you're born again
[1:44:06] you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:44:09] Ghost what's it gonna do it's gonna lead
[1:44:11] you into truth so we've got it written
[1:44:15] right here but they want to go to
[1:44:16] something if I got to Holy Ghost you
[1:44:17] speaking to did you shout you believe
[1:44:19] the Prophet you believe the message it
[1:44:22] has to be a revelation
[1:44:24] personally reveal to you by the Holy
[1:44:28] Spirit not some man sitting on a couch
[1:44:30] saying he your seed thus saith the Lord
[1:44:33] that's nothing that's
[1:44:35] nothing
[1:44:37] it's when you read it in the message and
[1:44:39] you find your identity
[1:44:42] without this message you cannot discern
[1:44:46] whether you have the Holy Ghost or not
[1:44:49] because the Holy Spirit said it's the
[1:44:53] receive the message of your hour
[1:44:55] it's not to join a denomination a group
[1:44:58] or a following
[1:44:59] because that's what the word said and he
[1:45:02] reveals himself to whom that he will
[1:45:06] and that lays in his control
[1:45:12] now we was reading last night let's go
[1:45:14] to Psalms
[1:45:16] and we'll just
[1:45:19] go with find a stop in place we still
[1:45:21] got tomorrow I want to bring something
[1:45:23] else to kind of cap this off let's go to
[1:45:26] Psalms
[1:45:28] 36 I
[1:45:30] think brother
[1:45:32] brother
[1:45:36] lush quoted this a referred to it last
[1:45:40] night
[1:45:41] Psalms 36
[1:45:43] and I want to read verse 9
[1:45:46] now last night we read send thy light
[1:45:50] and thy truth
[1:45:53] that it might lead me to thy Tabernacles
[1:45:56] in other words send the light and we
[1:46:01] were talking about prophecy and the
[1:46:03] truth
[1:46:05] but it might lead me and guide me
[1:46:08] to thy thanks work that's for the
[1:46:11] presence of God but now let's look at
[1:46:13] this let's go a little step further here
[1:46:14] in Psalms 36 and verse 9 for with thee
[1:46:19] is the fountain of life now remember the
[1:46:22] scripture said they had done two evils
[1:46:24] that here to themselves cisterns and
[1:46:27] they had left the fountain of life the
[1:46:31] Living Waters so the fountain of life is
[1:46:34] the Spirit of God that's revealing
[1:46:37] himself
[1:46:38] because that's where eternal life is
[1:46:41] you're saved by grace
[1:46:42] through faith so grace tells me why I
[1:46:46] was saved my election by the
[1:46:50] foreknowledge of God now the
[1:46:53] foreknowledge of God is not looking down
[1:46:55] through the tunnel of time and seeing
[1:46:56] you being born and you as a good person
[1:46:59] or a bad person and then one day you
[1:47:00] came to the altar and you repented and
[1:47:03] then you you came to the message and
[1:47:04] then you you believe the message was the
[1:47:07] Word of God and God said I'm gonna
[1:47:09] predestinate that person because that's
[1:47:11] predestinated based upon your actions or
[1:47:14] reactions but predestination lies within
[1:47:17] the sovereignty of God
[1:47:19] so we are predestinated
[1:47:23] through the foreknowledge of God and
[1:47:26] what is the foreknowledge of God
[1:47:28] that he had so many children and he knew
[1:47:33] when those children came forth they was
[1:47:35] in the book of life
[1:47:36] he knew the body he knew the name any of
[1:47:39] the parents near the country he knew the
[1:47:42] day he knew the hour he knew the year he
[1:47:45] knew the minute he knew the second
[1:47:47] and it's like a man said one time a
[1:47:50] preacher and he was talking and he said
[1:47:52] you know say if my son got thrown into
[1:47:54] jail and they called me down there and
[1:47:56] said now we're gonna turn him over into
[1:47:58] your custody well you promised us that
[1:48:00] he won't do anything bad he said well he
[1:48:04] said I can I can place him on curfew and
[1:48:08] I and I can do all these things and
[1:48:11] restrictions and I can do everything I
[1:48:13] can do but he said I can't promise you
[1:48:15] won't do anything bad but he said now if
[1:48:17] I could put my spirit in him then I
[1:48:20] could tell you what he would do
[1:48:23] so God known that the seed was his child
[1:48:27] and when it came into that into that
[1:48:31] person that soul that gene that comes
[1:48:33] from God
[1:48:35] he predestinated
[1:48:38] predestinated what by his foreknowledge
[1:48:42] knowing there was a seed he
[1:48:45] predestinated an event that take place
[1:48:47] in that person's life that the light
[1:48:52] would strike the scene
[1:48:55] he didn't have to predestinate the seed
[1:48:58] it was already part of him he
[1:49:00] predestinated an event because he knew
[1:49:04] that when the light struck that seed and
[1:49:07] when it come to life he knew the kind of
[1:49:10] life that was in there
[1:49:13] so he predestinated us by his
[1:49:16] foreknowledge we didn't become sons at
[1:49:19] the new birth we already were sons how
[1:49:23] did you get the Holy Ghost by
[1:49:25] predestination because you had
[1:49:27] predestinated to an inheritance henkle
[1:49:30] in Galatians that said he sent his
[1:49:32] spirit into you because y-you were sons
[1:49:36] so he was quickening the seed that was
[1:49:39] in you take the seed that sweet it's
[1:49:42] crying for life lay it in there that
[1:49:45] woman he predestinated the light to
[1:49:48] strike the scene
[1:49:50] Cornelius he predestinated the light to
[1:49:53] strike the seed how did you come through
[1:49:56] predestination but it was a free choice
[1:49:59] but he only let the light strike the
[1:50:02] seed and the seed took control of your
[1:50:05] life
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:11] verse nine songs 36
[1:50:14] for with thee is the fountain of life in
[1:50:20] thy light
[1:50:22] in thy light shall we see light
[1:50:29] Wow
[1:50:30] in thy light that belongs to him
[1:50:34] we shall see light light that's set on
[1:50:37] the earth
[1:50:38] prophecy light
[1:50:40] in thy light under thy inspiration he
[1:50:45] reveals to whom he will under his light
[1:50:48] will recognize that light as him but we
[1:50:53] must be in his life to see light in
[1:50:56] thy light will see light
[1:51:00] now what we're speaking of tonight
[1:51:02] didn't sound like it but
[1:51:04] prophecy
[1:51:07] influences your character I'm talking
[1:51:10] about prophecy revealed
[1:51:13] Daniel he was a prophet and God showed
[1:51:17] him a lot of things
[1:51:18] but there was some he had to read this
[1:51:21] in Jeremiah
[1:51:24] why that they were in in captivity
[1:51:27] evidently even though that he was a
[1:51:29] young man he must not have known he must
[1:51:32] even though his whole life was devoted
[1:51:33] to God and he had purposed in his heart
[1:51:36] not to be defiled but yet there was
[1:51:39] lacking a revelation in his life of why
[1:51:42] they were in captivity even though he
[1:51:45] was a prophet because when he read the
[1:51:47] Book of Jeremiah he read the same book
[1:51:51] we read he saw how that how that
[1:51:53] Jerusalem was condemned by God he saw
[1:51:58] exactly why that they were sent to
[1:52:00] Babylon he read it and then he realized
[1:52:04] that there was 70 years there was only
[1:52:07] two years left
[1:52:08] prophecy being revealed to Daniel by the
[1:52:13] Spirit reading the word what did it do
[1:52:16] to his life it affected his actions he
[1:52:21] went into sack cloth and ashes and began
[1:52:23] to repent prophecy revealed has an
[1:52:28] effect upon your character and character
[1:52:30] has an effect upon conduct
[1:52:33] now let's look at preeminence for a
[1:52:36] minute
[1:52:38] in clauses that he might have the
[1:52:41] preeminence
[1:52:42] so brother Brennan said the three-fold
[1:52:45] mystery one God revealing himself in
[1:52:48] Christ
[1:52:49] - he wanted to find a people that he
[1:52:52] could have the preeminence in so now we
[1:52:55] thank preeminence all I want I want him
[1:52:59] to have the preeminence in my life I'm
[1:53:01] just gonna read that Bible and fill my
[1:53:04] mind with his word when I get up in the
[1:53:06] morning the first thing I'm going to do
[1:53:08] is I'm gonna think about Jesus so sure
[1:53:11] enough I get up in the morning I
[1:53:13] stretched and I look and I say the sun's
[1:53:15] out oh
[1:53:16] Jesus Jesus I want to think about Jesus
[1:53:19] you know and after a while it because it
[1:53:21] happened you wake up and you say Jesus
[1:53:23] Jesus is one what we got for breakfast
[1:53:25] Jesus in other words we're trying to
[1:53:27] make him the preeminent thing when I go
[1:53:28] to work I'm gonna keep my mind on him
[1:53:32] and I'm doing some wiring and I'm
[1:53:34] working with 220 and I get to work
[1:53:35] instead of every careful ready Jesus
[1:53:38] Jesus I gotta think about Jesus
[1:53:40] preeminence
[1:53:43] but now let me say this that prophecy
[1:53:48] revealed has an effect upon character
[1:53:52] and character has an effect upon conduct
[1:53:56] and also we find that prophecy revealed
[1:54:01] brings the preeminence of the word in
[1:54:04] your life
[1:54:05] Joe was a prophet
[1:54:08] he received a revelation that revelation
[1:54:12] was prophecy that there was coming a
[1:54:15] lamb but when it was revealed to him it
[1:54:18] was a blood sacrifice
[1:54:20] and so it changed his life we know he
[1:54:24] went to church brother Brown said his
[1:54:25] comforters they were deacon so we just
[1:54:27] say he went to church and they were
[1:54:29] believers in that day but they he was
[1:54:32] living a little bit above the revelation
[1:54:35] at one time he was with them and church
[1:54:38] theology the revelation I think we
[1:54:40] talked about this last time was that
[1:54:42] when you commit sin God judges sin and
[1:54:46] that was true God judges sin so when
[1:54:50] they came his comforters and they came
[1:54:53] to sit down with him now they came with
[1:54:56] the discernment of the wisdom of their
[1:54:58] theology
[1:54:58] and they said you know what we're under
[1:55:03] the hand of judgments of God because
[1:55:05] look at all this taking place this is
[1:55:07] this is certainly the hand of God it's
[1:55:09] just not coincidence and we know that
[1:55:12] God judges sin
[1:55:14] and so they said what have you done
[1:55:17] wrong because I know they're there
[1:55:19] investigating this thing heard me
[1:55:20] learning you committed adultery know
[1:55:22] you've been out smoking no so he went
[1:55:26] through a whole list you know and I said
[1:55:28] hmm can't find anything but we know it
[1:55:32] involves sin so it's a secret sin
[1:55:36] confess it
[1:55:38] Joe looked around he's seen a lot of
[1:55:40] things he doesn't wrong
[1:55:43] but he looked over there at that at the
[1:55:45] ashes
[1:55:47] and he knew that those ashes said that
[1:55:49] he was innocent before God
[1:55:52] and so he looked back and he said I'm
[1:55:56] innocent no sin and
[1:55:59] so then they judged him and LU comes
[1:56:01] along and he says I'm surprised you
[1:56:04] couldn't find anything wrong with him
[1:56:05] unless you and yet you condemn him
[1:56:06] because that's as far as they could go
[1:56:08] but watch there was still something
[1:56:11] lacking in jobs life because he had this
[1:56:15] revelation
[1:56:16] which was actually prophecy but now he's
[1:56:20] sitting in the middle of the ashes
[1:56:22] why do I find him in ashes because
[1:56:25] that's where he offered his sacrifice it
[1:56:27] was the ashes of his sacrifice that I
[1:56:30] believe that he was sitting in I don't
[1:56:32] believe he got in fireplace I don't
[1:56:34] believe he pushed the cooking stove
[1:56:36] aside and got in that but the ashes of
[1:56:39] his sacrifice trying to find the
[1:56:41] presence of God
[1:56:43] and he was scraping the boils skin
[1:56:46] cancer whatever it was leprosy killing
[1:56:49] him and he was looking death right in
[1:56:51] the face now he knew that his sins were
[1:56:54] forgiven but he did not his capstone
[1:56:57] revelation to seal that would be what
[1:57:00] happens after a man dies I see the tree
[1:57:04] fall I see this little branch freak come
[1:57:07] up
[1:57:08] what happens to a man when he dies what
[1:57:10] happens when he goes in the grave and he
[1:57:13] held to that prophecy his conduct was
[1:57:18] controlled by his revelation his
[1:57:21] response to his comforters gave the word
[1:57:24] preeminence that he could say I'm
[1:57:27] innocent
[1:57:27] where'd that come from the preeminence
[1:57:30] of the revelation in his own life in
[1:57:33] reference to that sacrifice that
[1:57:36] sacrifice didn't do nothing for job
[1:57:38] because it couldn't do away with sin but
[1:57:42] it was the revelation that presented him
[1:57:44] blameless and perfect before God perfect
[1:57:48] and we're talking about prophecy
[1:57:51] preeminence and perfection and God said
[1:57:55] he was perfect
[1:57:56] he said before God blameless and perfect
[1:58:00] he was upright he was righteous but he
[1:58:02] was lacking yet a revelation I call it a
[1:58:06] capstone revelation or a completion of
[1:58:09] this revelation of redemption so while
[1:58:11] he's sitting here holding to that
[1:58:14] testimony of that prophecy a
[1:58:19] revelation comes he says all now that I
[1:58:24] had I had a
[1:58:27] steel pin and I had some stone and I
[1:58:31] could write this in stone that man
[1:58:33] forever
[1:58:34] could read this I don't want some ink to
[1:58:37] fade away or some paintings on the wall
[1:58:39] but I want to write it in strong
[1:58:42] and if I die if the skin wounds eat this
[1:58:46] flesh I'll stand in this flesh and I'll
[1:58:50] see my Redeemer and not as a stranger
[1:58:54] redeemed redeemed by the blood of the
[1:58:56] Lamb and it was revealed to him of the
[1:58:59] resurrection
[1:59:04] prophecy
[1:59:07] being revealed
[1:59:09] we go to the Exodus
[1:59:13] preconceived ideas look at the Exodus
[1:59:15] for a moment
[1:59:18] Exodus
[1:59:22] let me find Exodus chapter
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:29] 4
[1:59:31] and look at verse 28 Exodus chapter 4
[1:59:36] verse 28 now we know that this is
[1:59:38] prophecy that God spoke to Abraham that
[1:59:43] what happened to his seat after he
[1:59:44] passed away they'd go into captivity for
[1:59:48] 400 years and then God was going to
[1:59:50] deliver him so now we are in a
[1:59:53] dispensation change we're changing from
[1:59:56] captivity to deliverance
[2:00:00] and he also he changes his name in
[2:00:03] Exodus the sixth chapter he said by my
[2:00:07] name almighty they knew me
[2:00:10] Almighty means help schastye I as shadi
[2:00:14] I means the great breasted one and that
[2:00:17] word refers as covenant keeper and
[2:00:20] provider of that covenant he not only
[2:00:23] promised a child to Abraham and to Sarah
[2:00:25] but he protected Sarah's womb el shaddai
[2:00:28] our brother branham said he draws from
[2:00:31] his breast strength and then when it
[2:00:34] came time to have the child him being
[2:00:37] almighty el shaddai he changed their
[2:00:40] bodies to have that child he was the
[2:00:42] Covenant maker and he was the provider
[2:00:44] that covenant but he said by my name
[2:00:48] Jehovah
[2:00:49] they didn't know me and Jehovah is
[2:00:53] FULFILLER of the promise because this
[2:00:56] what he's speaking up is in relationship
[2:00:59] to the scene so now we're talking about
[2:01:02] prophecy being fulfilled
[2:01:05] now here comes Moses with Aaron with a
[2:01:10] word of the Lord to bring in the
[2:01:11] accidents or deliverance in other words
[2:01:14] them coming down there is prophecy now
[2:01:17] being fulfilled
[2:01:21] and Moses this is verse 28 of chapter 4
[2:01:25] and Moses told Aaron all the words of
[2:01:29] the Lord who had sent him on all the
[2:01:31] signs which he commanded him and Moses
[2:01:34] and Aaron went together
[2:01:37] went and gathered together all the
[2:01:39] elders of the church of Israel and Aaron
[2:01:42] spake spake the words which the Lord had
[2:01:46] spoken unto Moses and did the signs in
[2:01:50] the sight of the people the same signs
[2:01:52] that he did there the serpent the hand
[2:01:55] all the signs and the people believed Oh
[2:01:59] what a service he comes them and he
[2:02:04] preaches the Lord God has come to
[2:02:06] deliver you out of Israel thus saith the
[2:02:10] Prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob and the last
[2:02:14] prophet Joseph when he said thus saith
[2:02:17] the Lord when God visits you and
[2:02:20] delivers you take my bones with you and
[2:02:24] those bones laid up as a memorial of the
[2:02:27] prophecy of the word of God that when it
[2:02:30] came to pass they would be carrying
[2:02:33] those bones out of Egypt
[2:02:36] now the prophecy was being fulfilled
[2:02:39] preach the message with the vines
[2:02:42] indication
[2:02:45] and the people believed and when they
[2:02:49] heard that the Lord had visited the
[2:02:52] children of Israel and he and that he
[2:02:55] had looked upon their affliction then
[2:02:58] they bowed their heads and worshiped
[2:03:00] they believed they saw the vindication
[2:03:04] of the message and they believed and
[2:03:07] they bound her heads and began to
[2:03:09] worship Jehovah God what a meeting
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:15] now is reading one commentary and I
[2:03:18] thought to hell probably was the truth
[2:03:19] now comes in
[2:03:22] preconceived
[2:03:24] revelation
[2:03:26] so they heard the prophecy they saw the
[2:03:29] miracles so he said everybody left the
[2:03:32] church and went home and started packing
[2:03:35] one because it was fixing to get out of
[2:03:37] her right oh
[2:03:39] but it didn't happen right away instead
[2:03:42] they had everything packed the next
[2:03:44] morning and here come the knock of the
[2:03:45] taskmasters how come you ain't on the
[2:03:47] job uh
[2:03:49] well I guess I better get out there
[2:03:52] now we find that Pharaoh is upset over
[2:03:56] this meeting
[2:03:57] and so he says now you've got too much
[2:04:00] time on your hands blah blah blah blah
[2:04:02] blah and so he sends a he sends a
[2:04:05] representative out he beats them and
[2:04:07] sends them out they see Moses and Aaron
[2:04:09] on the way and they just oh man they
[2:04:12] just lay it on my house gods in it now
[2:04:15] we got to work harder now we know strong
[2:04:17] we gotta go find it we gotta make it say
[2:04:19] oh oh you preachers my tailor
[2:04:23] preconceived revelation
[2:04:28] look here in verse verse 9 of
[2:04:32] of chapter 5 I call this the second
[2:04:36] meeting the second service
[2:04:40] Moses comes down from the presence of
[2:04:42] the Lord repeating the prophecy
[2:04:44] and what does it say and Moses spake so
[2:04:47] on to the children of Israel but they
[2:04:50] hearkened not they didn't listen to him
[2:04:52] they sitting in a service they thought
[2:04:54] maybe they was going to pray for him say
[2:04:56] we need some instruction some divine
[2:04:58] revelation how to get this straw and
[2:05:00] make these bricks
[2:05:01] but he didn't preach on bricks he didn't
[2:05:04] preach on strong he didn't preach and
[2:05:07] say all I'm just so sorry you're working
[2:05:09] so hard I'm gonna pray and ask God to
[2:05:10] alleviate this he just comes and he
[2:05:13] gives them prophecy and it said they
[2:05:15] wouldn't even hearken to him they
[2:05:17] wouldn't listen to the message tell us
[2:05:19] sleep want to get out of there we gotta
[2:05:21] make bricks
[2:05:25] but they hearkened not unto Moses for
[2:05:27] anguish and that word anguish means
[2:05:28] actually shortness those spirit in other
[2:05:32] words they were impatient
[2:05:35] now here's a prophet of God bringing
[2:05:38] exactly what they need to get out of
[2:05:40] this but they through preconceived
[2:05:44] revelation have rejected the message now
[2:05:49] Moses himself
[2:05:51] when he comes down and these people just
[2:05:53] lay it on him and walk away you know
[2:05:56] what he does he goes to God he says lord
[2:06:00] I told you not to send me I told you I
[2:06:03] couldn't do this I know preacher and
[2:06:05] they didn't listen to me and God just
[2:06:07] sits there and he listens to them you
[2:06:10] know so now Moses just take courage I
[2:06:12] want you to keep on preaching this
[2:06:14] message for me and you know I tell you
[2:06:16] what I'm gonna I'm gonna do something
[2:06:18] for you and to give you a new robe and
[2:06:20] I'm gonna give you a new car and a
[2:06:21] bigger church he just sit there and
[2:06:23] listen to him read it and he says oh I
[2:06:26] wish you'd never sent me I told you when
[2:06:29] I was down there stood before you I
[2:06:30] couldn't do it and look at see it's
[2:06:32] exactly what I said
[2:06:34] so God let him finish when he got
[2:06:37] through crying and all the noise and
[2:06:38] screaming and sat down on the tree says
[2:06:40] okay now Moses now here's what I want
[2:06:43] you to preach to me this is message
[2:06:45] number two
[2:06:47] you think he sympathizes with us he
[2:06:50] doesn't he doesn't
[2:06:51] you know
[2:06:54] anyway that's another story
[2:06:56] so prophecy now I want you to turn to
[2:06:59] Deuteronomy 29
[2:07:03] Deuteronomy 29 this has become kind of a
[2:07:07] special scripture to me and we're going
[2:07:09] to start at verse 2 Deuteronomy 29
[2:07:12] and Moses called unto all Israel and
[2:07:16] said unto them
[2:07:17] you have seen all that the Lord did
[2:07:21] before your eyes in the land of Egypt on
[2:07:25] to Pharaoh and on to all his servants
[2:07:29] and unto all his land now he's called it
[2:07:33] upon them
[2:07:34] he is appealing to their eyesight he
[2:07:38] appealing to what they heard what they
[2:07:41] touched what they tasted he's appealing
[2:07:44] to their five senses he said you know
[2:07:46] what you saw back to her he's appealing
[2:07:48] to their memory do you remember what
[2:07:51] happened back there you remember you saw
[2:07:53] the church you heard the noise
[2:07:55] you seen all that
[2:07:57] you remember all these things you saw
[2:08:00] you're hurting
[2:08:03] now what is it what is he saying the
[2:08:06] great temptations or trials
[2:08:10] which thine eyes have seen the signs and
[2:08:14] those great miracles now they were
[2:08:17] living in prophecy being fulfilled
[2:08:21] and that prophecy being fulfilled
[2:08:26] it had an effect on their spirit I'm
[2:08:30] saying
[2:08:31] because when they came across
[2:08:34] Miriam danced in the spirit up and down
[2:08:38] with the tambourine and rejoicing and
[2:08:41] praising God for the great deliverance
[2:08:44] prophecy
[2:08:47] but now God says in the scriptures in
[2:08:51] Psalms believe in Psalms 103 he said
[2:08:54] Israel didn't know my Israel didn't know
[2:08:58] the acts of God but Moses knew his ways
[2:09:02] now there's a difference in acts and
[2:09:05] ways
[2:09:05] Jesus said you do err in your heart not
[2:09:10] knowing the power of God and the
[2:09:13] scriptures now to whom is the arm of the
[2:09:16] Lord to whom is the power of God
[2:09:18] revealed to but him that has believed to
[2:09:22] report him that is inspired to that word
[2:09:26] it has an effect upon a character their
[2:09:29] conduct their response and the
[2:09:32] preeminence does the word have the
[2:09:35] preeminence
[2:09:37] now Miriam danced in the spirit but now
[2:09:41] God is saying you've seen all these
[2:09:43] things and you witness these things you
[2:09:46] were affected by them watch what he says
[2:09:49] yet the Lord
[2:09:52] has not given you a heart to perceive or
[2:09:55] understand
[2:09:57] eyes to see now he just said you
[2:10:01] remember all the things you saw but now
[2:10:03] he's saying you don't have eyes to see
[2:10:05] and you don't have a heart to understand
[2:10:09] and the Lord has not given you the Lord
[2:10:13] is not giving you your daddy gave you a
[2:10:16] heart your daddy gave you eyes but now
[2:10:19] the Lord has not given you a heart to
[2:10:21] perceive and eyes to see and ears to
[2:10:25] hear unto this day
[2:10:30] let us see them miserable
[2:10:34] blind naked wretched didn't even know it
[2:10:38] didn't have eyes to see ears to hear
[2:10:42] they were living in the prophecy they
[2:10:45] had responded to it they were affected
[2:10:47] in their spirit by that prophecy they
[2:10:50] benefited by the prophecy they were
[2:10:53] under the blessings of the prophecy
[2:10:55] their clothes in where their shoes
[2:10:58] didn't wear what he says and I have led
[2:11:01] you in the wilderness 40 years your
[2:11:04] clothes not waxing old clothes
[2:11:07] then wax old
[2:11:09] Nathan's clothes didn't wax old Moses
[2:11:12] and Joshua Caleb Miriam Aaron all of
[2:11:17] your clothes didn't wear out they all
[2:11:19] was under the blessing of the prophecy
[2:11:22] by being involved with it
[2:11:25] but yet he says I haven't given you a
[2:11:27] heart
[2:11:29] to understand to perceive
[2:11:32] to discern
[2:11:34] the arm of the Lord had not been
[2:11:36] revealed to them only to to
[2:11:41] Joshua and Caleb because he had given
[2:11:45] them a heart to believe you say how do
[2:11:49] you know that because when they came to
[2:11:51] kadish Bardia watch what he goes on to
[2:11:54] say
[2:11:55] clothes are not waxen old upon you and
[2:11:58] they and the shoe is not waxen old upon
[2:12:00] your feet you have not eaten bread
[2:12:02] neither have you drunk wine or strong
[2:12:05] drink that you might know that I am the
[2:12:08] Lord your God God was trying to unveil
[2:12:11] himself who has believed our report who
[2:12:15] believed the message who actually
[2:12:16] believed the prophecy being fulfilled
[2:12:19] but just when Caleb when it came to
[2:12:22] Katie's marnya what happened they sold
[2:12:25] out because they could not trust God
[2:12:28] because the power of God had not been
[2:12:31] revealed to them so when they came to
[2:12:33] Katie's Bardia and they come back and
[2:12:36] they said yeah well it's fruit it's just
[2:12:38] like the Lord said we saw it flowing
[2:12:40] milk and honey but I tell you what
[2:12:41] there's Giants over there and you ain't
[2:12:44] going to eat too many grapes you ain't
[2:12:47] gonna drink for year you can eat the
[2:12:48] honey because they're going to kill you
[2:12:50] next to them were grasshoppers they did
[2:12:53] not have a heart to believe or perceive
[2:12:57] or to recognize they were in prophecy so
[2:13:01] it could not affect their character they
[2:13:04] rebelled they criticized they grumbled
[2:13:07] they gripe until it accumulated to
[2:13:10] unbelief and because of because of
[2:13:13] unbelief the lack of revelation on
[2:13:16] prophecy they failed to go into God's
[2:13:19] rest
[2:13:23] prophecy revealed
[2:13:26] we can prove by the scriptures that has
[2:13:28] an effect upon your conduct and your
[2:13:32] conduct it is centered around the
[2:13:36] preeminence of Christ when Joshua and
[2:13:39] Caleb got the word had such a
[2:13:41] preeminence I said well their defenses
[2:13:44] has gone from them God has given us a
[2:13:46] lion the last call cross but they did
[2:13:50] not have the faith as it was in the
[2:13:52] cloud he wasn't a cloud it was a rocket
[2:13:54] what I said this they said that they
[2:13:56] said brother Brent said this and said
[2:13:58] that
[2:14:02] why because the corner the headstone was
[2:14:05] rejected and the arm of the Lord the
[2:14:08] power God is not revealed to them do you
[2:14:11] think that man that wrote that article
[2:14:12] that I read you out of the USA News you
[2:14:14] think he knows the power god
[2:14:16] no
[2:14:18] and been revealed to him
[2:14:23] prophecy inspired Miriam was affected by
[2:14:28] it
[2:14:30] but she never made it across
[2:14:32] Joshua and Caleb
[2:14:35] after the resurrection
[2:14:38] after the resurrection
[2:14:41] the two disciples
[2:14:44] they could not recognize prophecy
[2:14:47] being fulfilled
[2:14:51] they were walking along
[2:14:53] modern events
[2:14:55] and the light came
[2:14:58] Jesus coming
[2:15:01] he said I heard one preacher said
[2:15:04] another probably the truth he come
[2:15:07] walking up
[2:15:10] and he was smiling you know he says oh
[2:15:15] he says
[2:15:17] well what's going on what are you
[2:15:19] talking about they looked at him they
[2:15:21] saying he was smiling they said you must
[2:15:24] be a visitor in that church you must be
[2:15:26] a stranger here because you're smiling
[2:15:31] probably what's the truth you know
[2:15:33] somebody comes in the church smiling a
[2:15:35] lot of times I hear the song they're out
[2:15:37] there you love the Lord
[2:15:39] you know everybody said they'll come
[2:15:43] in they're not just old disciplines you
[2:15:46] know maybe you're arguing and fussing on
[2:15:47] the way to church and you're coming down
[2:15:49] here ready for anything these like same
[2:15:51] old message brother loves preaching the
[2:15:53] same old thing he said the problem is
[2:15:56] not with brother Lars he said the
[2:15:57] problem with you
[2:15:59] that's it like somebody volton the
[2:16:01] Bible's that
[2:16:02] same old thing that's the thing I read
[2:16:04] yesterday last year I don't read through
[2:16:06] the Bible that year I don't need to read
[2:16:08] it no more
[2:16:11] they said oh you're a stranger here he
[2:16:13] said yeah he said what what's going on
[2:16:16] he said
[2:16:17] he's that why haven't you heard they
[2:16:21] started you know we we believe Jesus was
[2:16:24] there's gonna be the seed of David and
[2:16:27] take the throne and they crucified him
[2:16:29] they killed him
[2:16:30] so he started talking to him and we
[2:16:33] talked about this last time he started
[2:16:35] unfolding the word to them
[2:16:37] unfolding order and you know by the
[2:16:40] enlightenment of the word
[2:16:42] they became the to rejoice
[2:16:45] and then he he went in there and he
[2:16:47] broke bread and it says their eyes was
[2:16:49] open and they recognized the resurrected
[2:16:53] Christ and then he goes and they gather
[2:16:56] again and then you know what he does he
[2:16:57] prays for them and says Lord open our
[2:17:01] understanding that when they screed
[2:17:03] their scriptures they will understand
[2:17:06] so we just sing this little song at home
[2:17:10] open ears of my heart Lord open
[2:17:15] the eyes of my heart I want to see you I
[2:17:21] want to see you
[2:17:25] open the eyes of my heart Lord open the
[2:17:30] eyes of my heart I want to see you I
[2:17:36] want to see you to see you high and
[2:17:42] lifted up shining
[2:17:45] in the light of your glory pour out your
[2:17:50] power and love as we sing holy holy
[2:17:57] holy holy holy
[2:18:01] I want to see you
[2:18:04] they had a heart to perceive
[2:18:07] perceive what prophesy that they could
[2:18:11] have a bonus to stand and face the
[2:18:13] challenge of the enemy as I said about
[2:18:17] brother lush as I said about Daniel or
[2:18:20] David they stood there and they hollered
[2:18:23] across there to those jacks because hang
[2:18:26] yourself
[2:18:28] alright they wasn't afraid
[2:18:31] they wasn't afraid to announce the
[2:18:33] challenge because it wasn't their battle
[2:18:36] it was God's battle prophecy being
[2:18:39] fulfilled
[2:18:42] David said the god of my strength
[2:18:44] send thy light like truth that will
[2:18:49] guide me
[2:18:50] and the previous song he says
[2:18:53] he's trying to figure out some way of
[2:18:55] how to sell how much did he love God and
[2:18:58] he said
[2:19:00] as a heart penance for the water Brooke
[2:19:04] now you could have said I'd cut off my
[2:19:07] right arm to be a believer you know we
[2:19:09] say that sometime I mean you want a car
[2:19:11] somebody say oh right on to have that
[2:19:13] car now you wouldn't do that but you're
[2:19:15] trying to express something of your
[2:19:16] desperation are you sincerity
[2:19:19] he said as a heart panis for their water
[2:19:22] broke then I thirst for the old God
[2:19:26] then I think he must have stopped said a
[2:19:29] Living God not just to God up there on
[2:19:32] the cloud someplace but a living God
[2:19:34] that he could interact with that was a
[2:19:37] present help in the time of trouble and
[2:19:39] he comes down and he says deep call it
[2:19:42] to the deep and he says the God of my
[2:19:44] life
[2:19:45] God was the center of his life
[2:19:49] send my light like truth and in thy
[2:19:52] light we shall see light
[2:19:57] prophecy
[2:19:59] you can try all you want to have him be
[2:20:02] preeminent in your life but without
[2:20:05] prophecy being revealed and it in return
[2:20:09] affects your conduct
[2:20:12] like that little woman said I'm not what
[2:20:14] I used to be I may not be what I ought
[2:20:17] to be but I ain't what I used to be
[2:20:19] something changed some change that man
[2:20:23] when he got that little thing out of the
[2:20:24] trash can something simple but he wanted
[2:20:28] to know that he know that he knows that
[2:20:30] he had the Holy Ghost
[2:20:32] that woman that came to brother Branham
[2:20:35] she said I just don't know if I got the
[2:20:37] Holy Ghost or not brother Brown I want
[2:20:40] the Holy Ghost he said now here was a
[2:20:42] woman that had the Holy Ghost and didn't
[2:20:44] know it he said I went back to where she
[2:20:46] was born and because of her nature and
[2:20:48] her insecurities I guess the number four
[2:20:50] and all that he said he prayed and said
[2:20:52] Lord let her speak and turn to give her
[2:20:53] something to stand on
[2:20:56] and the Pentecost said well how can you
[2:20:58] have the Holy Ghost how can somebody
[2:21:00] come in the house you not know they're
[2:21:01] living in there
[2:21:03] and I heard a man one time say well if
[2:21:06] you come up and ask me if you got the
[2:21:08] Holy Ghost he said I know one thing's
[2:21:09] for sure you ain't God well that's funny
[2:21:11] that's not what a prophet said to true
[2:21:14] three people
[2:21:16] sister Sheppard enough in the
[2:21:18] blasphemous names and that porn that
[2:21:21] rock she'd fell asleep and had that
[2:21:23] dream crying because you didn't know if
[2:21:25] she had the Holy Ghost
[2:21:27] the Holy Ghost
[2:21:29] it's important that you know that it's
[2:21:32] important that you know your sins are
[2:21:33] forgiven these things are important but
[2:21:36] they come by divine revelation
[2:21:38] not academically but it enters into the
[2:21:42] mind academically but God inspires that
[2:21:44] and gives you a heart to perceive open
[2:21:48] the eyes of my heart Lord that I might
[2:21:50] see you and at the arm of the Lord is
[2:21:54] revealed who has believed our report in
[2:21:57] that lovely obeys my commandment he that
[2:22:00] hears the voice of the angel and
[2:22:02] recognizes him to be the Archangel or
[2:22:05] Malakai for the profit of God the
[2:22:09] fulfillment of prophecy and while we
[2:22:11] were groping in darkness the great
[2:22:14] resurrection came in the promise word
[2:22:17] made manifest prophecy and many people
[2:22:21] are affected by it but there's the
[2:22:24] people that God is opening their hearts
[2:22:26] and perception
[2:22:32] you can never
[2:22:34] Christ can never be preeminent in your
[2:22:36] life
[2:22:37] as a law abiders the legalism
[2:22:42] no matter how much I got to thinking you
[2:22:46] know the closer our relationship with
[2:22:49] God
[2:22:51] then the more revelation we have he said
[2:22:54] I won't call you servant I'll call you
[2:22:57] friend because I haven't kept anything
[2:22:59] from you so now relationship has to do
[2:23:02] with the amount of revelation that he
[2:23:05] releases to us and then comes the bride
[2:23:09] so brother Brennan says you have need of
[2:23:12] Revelation more than anything
[2:23:14] so people go look deep teachers and
[2:23:17] things like that
[2:23:19] when you come up and you raise your hand
[2:23:22] you say I want a closer walk with here
[2:23:26] but that's your spirit saying that
[2:23:29] but you know what your soul is crying
[2:23:31] out for
[2:23:33] revelation
[2:23:34] not information
[2:23:36] revelation faith
[2:23:39] and so the Spirit interprets it and says
[2:23:41] I want a closer walk what closer
[2:23:43] relationship more revelation how are you
[2:23:47] dissing clothes I could probably cold it
[2:24:00] Christ's mystery God revealed why do you
[2:24:04] hunger why do you hunger church
[2:24:07] party a thirst you want more God tonight
[2:24:10] you want to be closer to God usually
[2:24:11] we're looking at our behavior and and
[2:24:13] and what we want to be in what we aren't
[2:24:16] so we I just oh I just need more of you
[2:24:18] Lord I want to walk closer to you I need
[2:24:20] more of the Holy Spirit I want to hold
[2:24:22] it what is it you're thirsting and
[2:24:24] you're hungry for God he's the man he's
[2:24:28] the Living bread he is the embodiment of
[2:24:31] everything that we have need of for
[2:24:33] eternal life in him is Calvary in him as
[2:24:36] a Holy Spirit amen in him as a glorified
[2:24:39] body in him as a resurrection everything
[2:24:43] that we have need of for the rapture is
[2:24:46] in that manner he is a living matter he
[2:24:49] is a word to come to you he is that's
[2:24:51] calling on me
[2:24:53] pause that's crew and the Lord shall be
[2:24:56] sin with a shout
[2:24:58] it wasn't the whole book it was a brides
[2:25:01] message to call a bride
[2:25:04] what bothers agree what powers of
[2:25:07] denominations what power has a world
[2:25:13] and the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[2:25:16] against it you know usually when you
[2:25:19] think about that you think busting into
[2:25:21] a fortress but that ain't it they had
[2:25:24] Sansom locked into that city and the
[2:25:28] gates of Hell cannot prevail he took
[2:25:30] them any put him on his shoulders and
[2:25:32] the gates of hell sin could not hold you
[2:25:36] it could not bind you but you are they
[2:25:40] quickened and made alive and giving you
[2:25:43] our hearts and proceeded many are
[2:25:46] affected by this message but what
[2:25:48] happens when they come to cater smart
[2:25:50] ear
[2:25:51] they did not have a heart to perceive
[2:25:53] they were under the blessings they could
[2:25:56] see what the effect of the message did
[2:25:58] to the Egyptians
[2:25:59] they can see the prayer lines they can
[2:26:02] see it all this cloud but this goes
[2:26:05] beyond the cloud it goes beyond doctrine
[2:26:09] it's eternal life touching eternal life
[2:26:12] [Applause]
[2:26:16] and when they came to Cadiz marnya
[2:26:20] the word had preeminence when it came to
[2:26:24] the comforters it had preeminence
[2:26:27] when it comes in this in time
[2:26:31] it'll have a preeminence
[2:26:34] that's why Satan is trying to neutralize
[2:26:37] and disarm the revelation of prophecy
[2:26:41] he knows that doctrine has no power
[2:26:44] without the revelation of prophecy the
[2:26:47] resurrection the quickening power came
[2:26:49] to us in the manifestation of the
[2:26:52] promised word as it did in the days of
[2:26:55] the Exodus
[2:26:56] but people that wasn't a message or
[2:26:59] preconceived ideas of what it ought to
[2:27:02] be
[2:27:06] when they wouldn't even listen after hot
[2:27:09] even though that God inspired the
[2:27:12] preacher and he come and poured his
[2:27:13] heart out he wouldn't listen to him I
[2:27:16] need more faith hot out he's gonna
[2:27:18] preach on heal and I got cancer I was
[2:27:21] looking for a real good faith message so
[2:27:23] I get healed
[2:27:25] listen you can be healing cancer he's
[2:27:28] still got to get out of here
[2:27:31] [Applause]
[2:27:35] he said you think cancer is ugly he said
[2:27:39] you ought to see a soul
[2:27:41] but that's eating up my see
[2:27:45] I've seen gruesome pictures of cancer
[2:27:48] and
[2:27:49] leprosy
[2:27:51] he sends a soul you'll never see it in
[2:27:54] the microscope
[2:27:56] I've seen it today
[2:27:59] in killing their wives killing the
[2:28:02] children killing their buddies killing
[2:28:05] this killing that killing themselves you
[2:28:07] don't know that that ain't a devil it's
[2:28:10] worse than cancer
[2:28:12] it's cruel this heartless it's selfish a
[2:28:17] drunk driving down the road you talk
[2:28:19] about selfish
[2:28:21] kills an innocent family the epitome of
[2:28:24] selfishness self love self love in the
[2:28:29] church self love in the world self will
[2:28:33] people's rights I got my rights to do
[2:28:36] this and I got my rights to do that if I
[2:28:40] wasn't they don't want to marry that man
[2:28:41] I got my rights
[2:28:43] you got your rights
[2:28:49] why do you hunger Church why do you
[2:28:52] thirst
[2:28:53] it's the father
[2:28:55] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[2:29:00] you so what you're feeling here is
[2:29:02] actually what God is doing in his great
[2:29:04] symphony
[2:29:06] he's actually doing here - called you to
[2:29:08] do something here
[2:29:11] why do you hunger why do you thirst oh
[2:29:14] I'll go to church this morning whose
[2:29:16] freakin brother wash Oh Harvard well hey
[2:29:20] you know brother Mike's gonna be there
[2:29:21] oh
[2:29:22] well let's go see him yeah
[2:29:26] and that's fine
[2:29:28] but James said when you have respective
[2:29:31] persons
[2:29:32] there's sin involved if not
[2:29:36] because now you're only looking at the
[2:29:38] temp all you're doing is looking at the
[2:29:40] veil but you never been behind the veil
[2:29:43] and after the while the voice of the
[2:29:46] high priest becomes the voice of the
[2:29:48] veil to you now you know he's not the
[2:29:50] pillar fire but the pillar fires back
[2:29:52] turn you've never seen him and and then
[2:29:55] you look at the veil you say you know I
[2:29:56] know that veil is not the pillar fire
[2:29:58] but this is as close as I've ever got to
[2:30:01] it and so then that veil becomes a
[2:30:03] pillar fire but a person's has been
[2:30:05] behind there and in the presence of the
[2:30:07] pillar of fire that voice will never be
[2:30:10] the voice of the pillar fire and that
[2:30:12] veil will never be that pillar fire
[2:30:14] because he's done had that experience
[2:30:16] don't tell me you can't get the Holy
[2:30:19] Ghost my man preach says you can't get
[2:30:21] the Holy Ghost Hill brother branham
[2:30:23] comes back I'll tell you one thing he
[2:30:25] does not have the Holy Ghost
[2:30:27] because that's why he's telling you you
[2:30:29] can't get it
[2:30:32] oh you ain't sanctified anybody preach
[2:30:35] that to you auntie exactly where they're
[2:30:37] living
[2:30:38] they've never been sanctified do you
[2:30:41] think a man that's been justified would
[2:30:43] preach that you ain't justified he would
[2:30:45] preach the word that you'd come to the
[2:30:47] same position that he is but he said
[2:30:49] what are they do they stand in the door
[2:30:51] they won't go in and they won't let you
[2:30:54] go in
[2:30:54] [Applause]
[2:30:59] the God knows how to take care of lines
[2:31:06] you're gonna get there and blindness on
[2:31:08] nobody well you know because of my wife
[2:31:13] this is an individual affair and we say
[2:31:17] that and we like to say it to the church
[2:31:19] sometimes into the pastor well this is
[2:31:21] an individual affair he's not speaking
[2:31:24] to a group he's speaking than an
[2:31:25] individual well you brought yourself to
[2:31:28] your own indictment you won't be able to
[2:31:31] blame it on nobody else either you'll
[2:31:33] have to take the responsibility on
[2:31:35] yourself there's nobody gonna stand be
[2:31:37] front of that throne and blame it on
[2:31:39] anybody else because he's giving you as
[2:31:42] a free moral agent to make your own
[2:31:44] choice I read a book one time and a man
[2:31:47] said they can take away your freedom
[2:31:48] they can put you in prison they can
[2:31:51] treat you cruel they can take your
[2:31:52] clothes but one thing they cannot take
[2:31:54] from you and that's your response
[2:31:57] [Applause]
[2:32:01] you can respond to cruelty with love and
[2:32:04] care and concern
[2:32:07] he was in one of those prisons over
[2:32:09] there whole in Germany and there is this
[2:32:13] one one this one guard and he was a
[2:32:16] cruel German all cruel he everybody
[2:32:19] hated him oh they just wish they'd have
[2:32:21] some way to kill him and strangle him
[2:32:23] from beaten to death
[2:32:25] but this man he just treated him he just
[2:32:28] talked college home
[2:32:31] because that man is possessed with a
[2:32:35] devil
[2:32:37] and one day this man comes to him and
[2:32:41] he's got family problems
[2:32:43] he's had a little kind of a fuss with
[2:32:45] his wife and I guess maybe threatened
[2:32:47] Italy and he comes to this prisoner and
[2:32:50] he looks for counsel and comfort
[2:32:53] you have the right to respond in a free
[2:32:57] moral agency to choose how you respond
[2:33:02] but you let so many things
[2:33:07] get it out of you you let
[2:33:12] you let so many things get it out of you
[2:33:16] you let your job
[2:33:18] you let your wife
[2:33:21] you let your husband you let your
[2:33:24] children you let the cares of the world
[2:33:28] you let some pastor you let somebody
[2:33:32] else get that out of you when you know
[2:33:36] that way down in your heart
[2:33:39] you're thirsty you're thirsty and hungry
[2:33:42] it's God trying to reveal it to you see
[2:33:47] the revelation the last day is here
[2:33:54] prophecy prophecy but in his light we
[2:34:00] see light and he strengthened who's man
[2:34:04] when that angel came to Daniel he said
[2:34:07] he put strengthened me jobs at all if I
[2:34:10] knew where he was I'd knock on his door
[2:34:12] and he's not going to condemn me but
[2:34:16] he's going to put strength in me all if
[2:34:19] you could find them
[2:34:22] opening eyes of my heart Lord
[2:34:26] and I might see thee
[2:34:29] as we bow our heads Heavenly Father
[2:34:35] God may you open the eyes of our hearts
[2:34:39] Lord is that man that you prayed for in
[2:34:42] the days of your flesh a blind man and
[2:34:45] you prayed for him and he said what do
[2:34:48] you see now is it well he said I see
[2:34:51] Mena's trees he said let me pray for you
[2:34:53] again
[2:34:54] bored sometimes we need our eyes fully
[2:34:58] opened that we can see clearly
[2:35:01] this day this prophecy Bart not just to
[2:35:06] see if hence what a prophet did in the
[2:35:08] pear line Lord but to look beyond that
[2:35:12] because we're part of your great
[2:35:14] symphony
[2:35:15] or just in that dynamic somewhere
[2:35:19] and Lord it's affected us
[2:35:22] not just in our spirit but down in our
[2:35:25] soul
[2:35:27] who open the eyes of our heart Lord as
[2:35:31] you did to those on the roads on this as
[2:35:34] you did to those it was gathered
[2:35:35] together in that little room and you
[2:35:38] spoke to them the things that you had
[2:35:39] already spoke to them but now it was in
[2:35:42] season and you were opening up the eyes
[2:35:45] of their heart
[2:35:47] Oh
[2:35:48] God
[2:35:50] may we not quench the thirst that sent
[2:35:54] us with the things of the world
[2:35:57] may we not listen to our human spirit
[2:36:01] the Lord may we discern the very desires
[2:36:04] of the soul and that it's you
[2:36:07] are sweetheart
[2:36:09] our lover that we longed for
[2:36:12] not Satan's civilization not these
[2:36:16] things that will lead us into darkness
[2:36:18] and corruption
[2:36:19] not these things that are fayliss
[2:36:22] but Lord don't let us be so spiritual
[2:36:25] that we're of no earthly good
[2:36:28] you sat down with them you went and
[2:36:31] talked to the woman at the well you
[2:36:32] taken time with your people and
[2:36:35] Lord you still take time with your
[2:36:38] people
[2:36:40] Lord may you come
[2:36:43] Lord give us a heart to proceed Lord we
[2:36:48] see
[2:36:48] put Oh God let us see
[2:36:51] give us eyes that our mother and
[2:36:54] father's not giving us with word glasses
[2:36:57] and hearing aids and false teeth and
[2:37:00] toupees and but all God
[2:37:06] Lord you never change you're always
[2:37:10] there
[2:37:11] and I believe as David he stood there I
[2:37:15] think of Peter and hey denied you and
[2:37:18] Kirsten denying it oh how I felt you
[2:37:23] couldn't even go back to church couldn't
[2:37:25] face a church when all by himself
[2:37:29] all he just himself until our guilty and
[2:37:33] I was shamed and I'm bad he felt oh
[2:37:36] god how bad David felt
[2:37:39] killing a man covers on sin and lust and
[2:37:43] how that love in his heart for you
[2:37:45] condemned him
[2:37:46] Lord that he realized you showed him a
[2:37:50] picture of himself not realizing it was
[2:37:52] him a man had taken another man sheep
[2:37:56] and killed it to feed his guests while
[2:37:57] he had under the
[2:37:59] and he said kill the man said David
[2:38:02] you're the man oh he must have felt in
[2:38:05] the presence of that prophet it is hard
[2:38:08] and failed
[2:38:11] God how that woman at the well must have
[2:38:13] felt
[2:38:17] but only
[2:38:19] a savior
[2:38:22] could love me and he said not Mary I
[2:38:29] want you to go tell my disciples oh yes
[2:38:34] make sure
[2:38:36] make sure that you go and tell Peter
[2:38:39] because I want to see him
[2:38:41] he wants to see I don't care how dark it
[2:38:45] might seem
[2:38:46] those things that you hid injure your
[2:38:48] heart
[2:38:50] God no there
[2:38:52] but he's provided around them for you if
[2:38:57] you'll come to him
[2:38:59] and accept him and repent
[2:39:04] well
[2:39:06] he still loves you
[2:39:10] and he's died for you and he's purchased
[2:39:13] your freedom for you
[2:39:14] not to be bound by darkness and fear
[2:39:18] intimidation
[2:39:20] but the liberty of the Holy Spirit the
[2:39:23] truth and life
[2:39:25] not to be bound by the news and evil
[2:39:28] circumstances and stock markets and what
[2:39:32] gas is gonna be tomorrow on how much
[2:39:33] pres is gonna cost but that he might
[2:39:36] have the preeminence
[2:39:38] through the revelation
[2:39:40] God opened the eyes of our heart more
[2:39:44] completely tonight
[2:39:46] Lord we accept the prayer that you
[2:39:49] prayed in that day
[2:39:50] God let us when we read this message
[2:39:54] when we read our Bibles when we listen
[2:39:56] to the tapes when we come to church or
[2:39:58] listen to one another
[2:39:59] open our ears that we might hear in our
[2:40:02] eyes that we might see
[2:40:04] not the ones that our father gave us but
[2:40:08] the ones that my Heavenly Father has
[2:40:09] given me when he birthed me
[2:40:12] all they've rejected you but to you to
[2:40:16] us your beautiful stone your precious
[2:40:18] stone your beautiful branch
[2:40:20] but the vehm its paranoid to them it's
[2:40:23] heresy it's fantasy its disillusionment
[2:40:27] but we see the trap of the enemy closing
[2:40:31] in upon the world Oh
[2:40:33] God we're in our last Exodus for the
[2:40:37] Gentiles
[2:40:38] may you use this Lord to help another
[2:40:43] Lord in life's dream let our footsteps
[2:40:47] Lord may it be footsteps in the sands of
[2:40:50] time that if we would pass that others
[2:40:53] would look at the footprints

[2:40:59] courage
[2:41:00] and move ahead let us not be dumb driven
[2:41:04] cattle
[2:41:05] but Lord let us be willful champions in
[2:41:09] this night
[2:41:10] Lord let us by the spirit not in our own
[2:41:13] strength
[2:41:15] Satan
[2:41:17] prepare to defend yourself because the
[2:41:20] battle is not now
[2:41:22] it's God's

[2:41:55] personal challenge
[2:41:58] from him to you
[2:42:03] that we might know him as a father
[2:42:06] our Father
[2:42:09] but that we might know him as our
[2:42:12] brother in Christ
[2:42:16] they mean
[2:42:17] he is our father
[2:42:21] because we are his sons and his
[2:42:25] daughters
[2:42:27] but he came down
[2:42:29] in the form of a son to identify with us
[2:42:33] as brothers and sisters
[2:42:36] that the relationship become more and
[2:42:39] more intimate

[2:43:32] so tossed about
[2:43:34] [Applause]
[2:43:36] spiritually
[2:43:37] he says because
[2:43:40] he said it's more intellectual than
[2:43:43] spiritual
[2:43:45] to become established in the truth
[2:43:49] is receive the Holy Ghost into soul
[2:43:53] but in your flesh not in your human
[2:43:56] spirit but in your soul

[2:44:06] religious
[2:44:07] [Applause]
[2:44:10] they've experienced God in their flesh

[2:45:11] what my senses declare
[2:45:15] what date
[2:45:17] reveals what God reveals through faith
[2:45:20] is more real to me than what my census
[2:45:23] is telling me

[2:45:32] it's serious
[2:45:36] it is serious
[2:45:40] let's not take it for granted

[2:49:14] where we belong to the Church of the
[2:49:15] firstborn written in heaven
[2:49:19] and the pasture that she would have the
[2:49:22] call would be Jesus
[2:49:24] call chases on the scene
[2:49:28] they
[2:49:30] pray God we're all
[2:49:33] members of the Church of the firstborn
[2:49:37] don't identify with this
[2:49:41] whether it's just this assembly here or
[2:49:43] our brothers sisters here from the
[2:49:45] Estonian central Newfoundland don't
[2:49:47] identify with that you're identifying

[2:50:16] Lord descending from heaven with a shout
[2:50:21] the Lord
[2:50:24] to reveal what John was forbidden to
[2:50:27] right
[2:50:28] [Music]

[2:51:17] son of God a daughter of God and I'm the
[2:51:21] brother/sister of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:51:25] that's right that's what we are
