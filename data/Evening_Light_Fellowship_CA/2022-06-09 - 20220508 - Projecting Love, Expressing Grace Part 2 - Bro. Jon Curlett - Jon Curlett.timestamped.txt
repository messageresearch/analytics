[45:53] lord but lord hopefully our praises have
[45:56] refreshed you this evening lord that
[45:57] it's been a pleasing thing for you
[45:59] heavenly father and so now we invite you
[46:02] to just speak to us lord may you just
[46:04] touch each heart and so lord may you
[46:06] look into each life lord you know the
[46:07] needs that i don't but lord if your holy
[46:10] spirit can open up that little door lord
[46:12] we know that that person can be changed
[46:13] lord that my life can be changed or that
[46:15] that area of my life can be changed the
[46:18] lord will want a changing god here
[46:19] tonight lord we want a god that makes a
[46:21] difference we want a god that's alive
[46:23] and well within us we pray lord so just
[46:26] have your way in this service lord
[46:27] there's many lord of wade tonight lord
[46:29] remembering the colombo and the katuka
[46:30] family especially lord sick at home
[46:32] tonight lord we pray your ministering
[46:34] grace and your healing touch to them
[46:36] lord for the collins family as well we
[46:38] pray lord god may you just be with them
[46:39] we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it
[46:42] amen amen thank you musicians
[46:45] and god bless you if you'll turn your
[46:46] scriptures to first john chapter four
[46:49] and we'll start in verse 18.
[46:51] and then certainly appreciate sister
[46:53] kimberly and brother paul singing that
[46:54] special i kind of put them on the spot
[46:57] and asked them to do it and they were
[46:58] gracious enough to do it so i certainly
[47:00] appreciate it that's uh
[47:02] that song's a prayer amen
[47:04] amen that he would devastate us with his
[47:06] presence that there be nothing left of
[47:08] us and only him that would be left amen
[47:12] that he would saturate us
[47:14] amen that he would draw us closer to him
[47:17] amen first john 14 4 verse 18 says there
[47:21] is no fear in love
[47:23] but perfect love casteth out fear
[47:26] because fear had torment he that feareth
[47:28] is not made perfect in love
[47:31] we love him because he first loved us
[47:34] if a man say i love god and hateth his
[47:36] brother he is a liar for he that loveth
[47:38] not his brother whom he had seen how can
[47:40] he love god whom he had not seen and
[47:43] this commandment have we from him that
[47:45] he who loveth god love his brother also
[47:48] amen god bless you can have your seats
[47:50] may bless the reading of his word we
[47:52] spoke on uh last service on this this uh
[47:56] theme of projecting love and expressing
[47:58] grace and i want to just wrap it up
[47:59] hopefully in a a nice tight little
[48:01] package here this evening and maybe last
[48:03] time we spoke more a bit on what you
[48:05] have to do and then we talked about the
[48:07] the things that are required of a
[48:08] believer to show that love and it was
[48:10] maybe a bit more on the on the telling
[48:12] you what to do but this service we want
[48:13] to get down to the cause and effect now
[48:15] and we want to see what happens when you
[48:16] do what we talked about in that last
[48:18] service when you when you show that love
[48:20] when you have that love the kind of
[48:21] effect it has not only on you and your
[48:23] life and your family and those close to
[48:25] you but also those that you come in
[48:26] contact whether it's human whether it's
[48:28] animal whether it's nature and all these
[48:30] different things we know that the love
[48:31] of god is is going to have an effect and
[48:33] i stopped at verse 17 so we could start
[48:35] on verse 18 the service because honestly
[48:37] you could preach an entire service just
[48:39] on verse 18 that perfect love casteth
[48:41] out all fear but we're going to go into
[48:43] it and we're going to cover it from a
[48:44] different couple different angles this
[48:46] evening and then we'll move on to the
[48:48] grace side as well but that scripture
[48:49] again says there is no fear and love but
[48:52] perfect love casteth out fear because
[48:54] fear had torment he that feareth is not
[48:57] made perfect in love and i want to touch
[48:59] this like i said from from from multiple
[49:01] angles and i want to start with the
[49:02] individual level because you can't give
[49:04] this if you don't have it you can't
[49:06] share with somebody if you haven't
[49:07] experienced it for yourself you can't
[49:09] give what you don't have inside of you
[49:11] so we want to bring this down this
[49:13] portion of perfect love casts out fear
[49:15] to each and every one of us this morning
[49:17] and brother branham would say a man that
[49:19] walks in love walks in life
[49:21] and perfect love casteth out all fear
[49:24] then if you can take him at his word and
[49:27] not fear a bit about it say lord i love
[49:30] you i know you're going to answer
[49:32] because you promised me you would and i
[49:35] just know you're going to do it see and
[49:37] it takes away all fear notice he says a
[49:39] man that walks in love walks in life and
[49:41] for the believer the word of god is life
[49:43] amen he can walk in the word of god
[49:45] without fear because he says lord i love
[49:47] you and i know because i love you i
[49:49] can't love you unless you love me first
[49:51] and that means that you're going to do
[49:52] what you promised you would by your word
[49:55] for my life amen
[49:57] then he would say as long as you're
[49:58] doing what he says do
[50:00] and you know you're directly led well
[50:03] then there's nothing to fear
[50:05] perfect love casts out all fear so
[50:06] there's no fear in god love takes away
[50:09] all fear amen so you have to be led
[50:12] you have to be led to cast out that fear
[50:14] you have to know that god is with you to
[50:16] cast out that fear so you've got to be
[50:18] sure you're led and the first thing you
[50:19] want to do if you're if you're seeking
[50:21] leadership is you check it with the word
[50:23] so often you know what people do is we
[50:24] go to prayer you don't need to go to
[50:26] prayer you need to go to the word first
[50:28] because don't waste your time praying
[50:29] for something that he hasn't promised in
[50:30] his word don't waste your time praying
[50:32] for something that he says don't do in
[50:34] your in his word amen go to the word and
[50:36] see if it lines up with his word and
[50:37] then you go to prayer and say lord your
[50:39] word says i should do it your word says
[50:40] i can do it now what would you have me
[50:42] to do and then you want to be confident
[50:44] that you're where you are and doing what
[50:46] you you're doing because he led you
[50:48] there amen that's what you want to do
[50:49] brother branham would say that he said i
[50:51] have to know that i'm where i am i'm
[50:54] where i'm supposed to be so that i know
[50:55] that god's with me to do whatever i face
[50:58] when i come up to that pulpit and where
[50:59] he goes to these meetings and that
[51:01] minister doesn't just accept any any
[51:02] invitation that he had especially when
[51:04] you're a prophet you've got hundreds
[51:05] maybe thousands of it he says i've got
[51:07] to know that god led me where i'm going
[51:09] so that when i get there anything that i
[51:11] need him to do he'll do for me because
[51:13] he sent me there in the first place
[51:16] he also says god is love perfect love
[51:19] but you don't know what love is that's
[51:21] why today people don't know what faith
[51:23] is he says god is love he has to be in
[51:26] love he's sovereign to his word and he
[51:28] has to keep his word he has to love you
[51:31] and if he loves you he's got to protect
[51:33] you notice he says he has to keep his
[51:35] word he has to love you how does he love
[51:37] you by keeping his word amen he proves
[51:40] his love to you by keeping his word to
[51:42] you personally as an individual amen
[51:44] that's how you can have faith is because
[51:45] he loves you he's going to act through
[51:47] his word to do what he told you he's
[51:49] going to do why because we tend to lose
[51:51] faith when we lose sight that god loves
[51:53] us
[51:53] and then often what happens is we say
[51:55] well this isn't going to happen because
[51:57] what you forget that god has called you
[51:59] he has changed you has placed you where
[52:00] you are and we start to get unsure of
[52:02] that we start to question our experience
[52:04] with god we start to question do we have
[52:06] the holy ghost and all of a sudden we
[52:07] start to doubt his word and it goes back
[52:09] to the very fact that we've forgotten
[52:10] that he loves us above all else he loved
[52:13] us and that's why we responded to him
[52:15] and that's why we love him and that's
[52:16] why we can appreciate his word and
[52:18] that's why we can accept his word is
[52:19] because he loved us but we get these
[52:21] little situations come up in his life in
[52:23] our life and something doesn't quite go
[52:24] the way we thought it should and we say
[52:26] well maybe his word isn't for me
[52:28] you've forgotten above all that he loves
[52:30] you
[52:30] you've forgotten that he's for you he's
[52:32] not against you that he wants to pour
[52:34] out every blessing he can on you and yet
[52:36] you let the circumstances rise up and
[52:38] you say well maybe it's not for me and
[52:39] we've forgotten first and foremost that
[52:41] everything he does is for our good
[52:43] even when we don't realize it you know
[52:45] selena was supposed to have a driving
[52:46] test yesterday
[52:48] and we did everything right
[52:50] we booked it right we made sure she had
[52:52] her license done right we did the
[52:53] lessons we we were there on time we did
[52:55] everything right and yet when she got
[52:57] there they said your license isn't right
[52:58] because they'd forgotten to transfer her
[53:00] license from british columbia
[53:02] now my natural reaction was not
[53:05] you know my natural reaction was anger
[53:08] right
[53:09] because i i forgot that all things work
[53:11] for good after just preaching it just
[53:12] how many times have i said it in the
[53:14] last couple of services or brother joe's
[53:16] saying it i completely forgot that all
[53:18] things work together for good to them
[53:19] who are the cult and so i got angry and
[53:21] i was going through conversations in my
[53:22] head about what i'd say if i was at the
[53:24] dmv with selena right now and da da da
[53:26] da and eventually i had to repent and
[53:28] say lord you've got a reason for it we
[53:30] did everything we did we should have we
[53:32] did everything right and yet it didn't
[53:34] happen so that means you didn't want it
[53:36] to happen for some reason and we don't
[53:37] know what that is maybe there was going
[53:39] to be an accident maybe she'd have had a
[53:40] wreck maybe she'd have got the grumpiest
[53:42] driving test person in the in the
[53:44] building and she wouldn't have passed no
[53:45] matter how well she did we don't know
[53:47] but i had to repent and say lord you do
[53:49] all things well
[53:50] right so it doesn't matter what it looks
[53:52] like or how inconvenient it is or or
[53:54] whatever because what happens as
[53:56] believers is we do everything right and
[53:58] then it doesn't go right
[54:00] has anybody else ever had that happen
[54:02] you do everything right it goes right
[54:04] eventually but it doesn't always go
[54:05] right when you want it to go right and
[54:07] it doesn't always happen the way you
[54:08] thought it should happen but it goes the
[54:10] way it needs to go according to his will
[54:12] and not yours but you do everything
[54:13] right and you stand there and you stand
[54:15] on his promise and you you step out in
[54:17] faith and you confess this and you
[54:18] testify that and then it doesn't happen
[54:20] when you thought it should and you say
[54:21] well maybe it's not for me remember he
[54:23] loves you
[54:24] remember he loves you and hold on and
[54:26] hold on because he loves you he's going
[54:28] to bring it the other thing is sometimes
[54:29] we doubt ourselves don't we
[54:31] we doubt ourselves we doubt our
[54:33] rightness we we doubt that we've done it
[54:34] the right way we we doubt maybe our
[54:36] motive and our objective and sometimes
[54:38] we've got to just have grace for
[54:39] ourselves and say listen he loved me and
[54:41] he called me and he'll work through any
[54:43] of these little issues i might throw up
[54:44] in his way
[54:46] you know
[54:47] amen we've got to remember that it's not
[54:48] us that's living this life in the first
[54:50] place amen it's not us that's living
[54:52] this life it is his life inside of us if
[54:54] jonathan was doing this tonight have
[54:56] failed a long time ago
[54:57] but he's living this life inside of us
[54:59] and so we've got to trust that that life
[55:01] is going to come forth regardless of how
[55:03] much concrete i put on top of it how
[55:05] much i turn off the taps that life's
[55:06] going to come out because it cannot be
[55:08] killed when you have eternal life inside
[55:10] of you it cannot die it cannot die and
[55:12] once it comes to life nothing can do it
[55:14] oh we can quench it and we can we can
[55:16] slow it down and we can put shade on it
[55:18] so it doesn't grow as well but it will
[55:20] continue growing and it will always
[55:21] break forth no matter what amen
[55:24] brother branham would say this he says i
[55:26] love him and i want you to love him i
[55:28] want you to believe him for perfect love
[55:30] casts out all fear if you love him with
[55:32] the right kind of a heart you won't have
[55:34] one speck of fear whether you can keep
[55:37] his word or not
[55:40] because what do we say we look at the
[55:41] word and we say well i've got to do that
[55:44] i've got to prove i'm one in a million i
[55:46] don't like that song so much because i'm
[55:48] not proving that he's proving it through
[55:49] me right i can't hold on
[55:52] i can't hold on i've let go many times
[55:54] but he never let me go yet he says
[55:56] you've got to have the you can't have
[55:58] one speck of fear whether you can keep
[56:00] his word or not why his word keeps his
[56:02] word and his word is inside of you and
[56:04] it's going to bring it out the way that
[56:05] he put it in there
[56:06] he says anything god says you love him
[56:08] so much that you believe it to think
[56:11] that perfect love casts out all fear
[56:13] you're not scared about nothing you're
[56:15] just resting you're not oh i may
[56:18] backslide tomorrow may i may backslide
[56:20] next week i wouldn't worry about that
[56:22] i'm not trying to hold on he held on for
[56:24] me and he put a love in my heart that
[56:27] holds there it's him that's holding me
[56:29] not me holding him and if it was me
[56:32] holding him i'd probably turn loose but
[56:34] as long as he's holding me he will never
[56:36] turn loose he promised he wouldn't i
[56:38] will never leave you i will never
[56:40] forsake you you're engraved in the palms
[56:41] of his hands i'll not lose the one that
[56:43] you've given me sorry that's for you
[56:46] brothers and sisters
[56:47] that's for you he's never going to let
[56:49] you go
[56:51] doesn't matter how far you go
[56:53] the prodigal son could never be anything
[56:54] but the son of his father no matter how
[56:56] far he went prodigal or not he was still
[56:58] the son
[57:00] and you're still the son and you're
[57:01] still the daughter because he's called
[57:02] you and he's going to place you and he's
[57:04] going to fulfill his word in your life
[57:05] amen brother bob says perfect love turns
[57:07] that out
[57:09] turns out all of that fear and he says
[57:11] what you may you may what you may let it
[57:13] go sometimes
[57:15] have you ever let go of him
[57:16] i've let go of him many times we do it
[57:19] we have these little ideas we have these
[57:20] little faults we have these little
[57:21] failings we have these little trips
[57:23] sometimes we have big trips
[57:25] right sometimes we forget that all
[57:27] things work for the good amen and we
[57:29] doubt and we doubt and we fear and we
[57:31] worry and that's torment
[57:33] if you're tormented i can tell you it's
[57:34] not of god whatever is happening your
[57:36] reaction to it cannot be of god if
[57:38] you're in torment because perfect love
[57:40] casts out torment amen
[57:43] sometimes the person you need to be the
[57:44] easiest on is yourself
[57:46] just let yourself relax and say listen
[57:48] he's got this i love him he loves me and
[57:50] he's going to sort it out and he's going
[57:52] to give me the strength he's going to
[57:53] give me whatever it takes to get me
[57:54] through this
[57:56] brother brown says do you want to act
[57:58] like the world and the rest of them then
[58:00] kiss christ goodbye and go back
[58:03] he says if you want it you might as well
[58:04] do it now i'm not advocating that to
[58:06] anybody today if you're not feeling it
[58:08] we want you to stay in the atmosphere in
[58:09] the presence of the holy spirit but what
[58:11] he's saying is if you're professing to
[58:13] believe and you're professing him as
[58:15] your lord and savior and you don't want
[58:16] to kiss the world goodbye get guess what
[58:18] he says you might as well go because
[58:19] your heart's not near him he says but if
[58:21] you want to take your way with the
[58:23] lord's despised few hold on to god's
[58:25] unchanging hand regardless of what the
[58:27] rest of the world says you hold right
[58:29] there god said so it's truth i believe
[58:31] it though i can't make it manifest in my
[58:34] life
[58:37] sometimes that's our problem is we're
[58:38] trying to make it manifest we're trying
[58:41] to make it happen we're trying to do it
[58:43] ourselves and he says listen you can't
[58:45] do anything to bring the word of god to
[58:46] pass in your life
[58:48] as a human as an individual in your
[58:51] carnality you can't do it he says it's
[58:53] true i believe it though i can't make it
[58:54] manifest in my life god said so i
[58:57] believe and i hold right there
[58:59] now i thought you say well i thought
[59:00] brother john you said that he was
[59:02] holding me he is holding you but guess
[59:04] what you've got to make your decision
[59:06] you've got to make a decision are you
[59:07] going to go his way or are you going to
[59:08] go your way are you going to go his way
[59:10] or are you going to go the hard way
[59:11] you're going to go perfect will or
[59:13] you're going to go permissive will guess
[59:14] what you can go permissive will and
[59:16] he'll allow you but you're going to get
[59:17] a spanking to bring him into his perfect
[59:18] will he'll work with you that way but
[59:20] that's not the way you want to go you've
[59:22] got a decision to make is will you go
[59:24] his way will you stay with what the word
[59:26] says amen you decide to stand on the
[59:28] word or you decide to go with the arm of
[59:30] flesh
[59:31] that's where you go that's your decision
[59:33] you can say lord i'm for you or lord i'm
[59:35] going to try it my way
[59:37] permissive perfect
[59:39] right listen the decisions in a
[59:41] believer's life ought to be independent
[59:43] of circumstance or outcome
[59:46] okay
[59:47] what that means is we don't make a
[59:48] decision based on how it could go
[59:51] we make a decision based on what does
[59:53] the word say for us to do in that
[59:55] situation and whether it's brother joe
[59:57] that might possibly lose a client
[59:58] because he stands up for the word
[59:59] whether it's the way you treat your kids
[1:00:01] because you're worried they'll go out in
[1:00:02] the world if you don't slacken up on
[1:00:03] them whether it's where you go whether
[1:00:05] it's where you fellowship whatever it
[1:00:06] might be you never do that based on what
[1:00:08] other people might think or how you
[1:00:10] think things might go bad
[1:00:12] you do it in faith because you're doing
[1:00:14] it based on the word and if you're doing
[1:00:16] it out of worry then you're never going
[1:00:17] to make the right decision because
[1:00:19] perfect love casts out all fear and a
[1:00:21] fearful decision cannot be a word
[1:00:23] decision it cannot be a word decision
[1:00:25] because it'll bring you a place of rest
[1:00:27] and peace regardless of how tough the
[1:00:29] decision might be to make
[1:00:31] what is it
[1:00:32] you gotta know god loves you and if you
[1:00:34] stick with his word he's gonna bring it
[1:00:35] to the right end
[1:00:36] no matter how bad the situation looks no
[1:00:39] matter how tough it is no matter how
[1:00:40] much you think you might lose you've got
[1:00:42] to make that right decision it's got to
[1:00:44] be by love amen
[1:00:45] and then we read last time that were his
[1:00:47] love perfected
[1:00:48] and then it said that his love is
[1:00:50] perfected in us that means we ought to
[1:00:51] have a perfect faith in the word that
[1:00:53] he's going to show his love and and back
[1:00:55] up his word in our lives every time
[1:00:57] john 14 15 says if you love me keep my
[1:01:00] commandments that's how you make
[1:01:02] decisions
[1:01:03] you love him and you do what his word
[1:01:05] says and it's very simple
[1:01:07] do what the word says
[1:01:09] it's very few things that you'll ever
[1:01:10] face in life that the word doesn't
[1:01:12] address in some form or another and
[1:01:14] that's where you have to go to prayer of
[1:01:15] course but if you love me he says keep
[1:01:17] my commandments brother brown would say
[1:01:18] and that's the same thing it is we must
[1:01:20] have love before we can have faith when
[1:01:23] we have genuine love what does it do it
[1:01:25] pushes our faith out on the battlefront
[1:01:27] for god see genuine godly love for god
[1:01:30] and for his word and for his people will
[1:01:33] push faith out there love just takes a
[1:01:35] hold of faith and just come on let's go
[1:01:37] and out it goes because that's what love
[1:01:39] does john 14 23 jesus said if a man
[1:01:42] loves me he'll keep my words now you
[1:01:44] can't keep his words without having
[1:01:46] faith in what he said so you see if he
[1:01:48] loves god then he keeps god's word
[1:01:51] if he said i'm the lord that healed thee
[1:01:52] he believes that love makes him believe
[1:01:55] it because love dominates all though i
[1:01:58] speak with the tongue of men and angels
[1:01:59] and have not love it's nothing see
[1:02:01] though i have faith to move mountains
[1:02:02] and have not love it's nothing love
[1:02:04] dominates all because god is love a god
[1:02:07] of love now yes sir if jesus said if a
[1:02:10] man loves me he'll keep my words
[1:02:12] now i'll give you a simple example and
[1:02:13] i've given you this before and that's
[1:02:15] when i was in university every time i
[1:02:17] had an exam that was coming up after a
[1:02:19] church service i would never skip church
[1:02:22] as far as i know god is my witness i
[1:02:24] never skipped church to stay home and
[1:02:26] study why because the word says forsake
[1:02:28] not the assembling of yourselves
[1:02:30] together all the more as you see the day
[1:02:31] approaching okay so i had a command to
[1:02:34] go to church
[1:02:36] he didn't say don't go to church if
[1:02:37] you've got a business deal going on he
[1:02:39] didn't say don't go to church if you're
[1:02:40] going to be going through a big exam
[1:02:42] tomorrow don't go to church for that no
[1:02:44] he said don't stop assembling yourself
[1:02:46] together and then he gave me a promise
[1:02:48] he said seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:02:50] and his righteousness and all these
[1:02:52] things will be added unto you so i knew
[1:02:54] that if i did my part and i wasn't
[1:02:56] fooling around and playing games and and
[1:02:58] this and that and i did my study
[1:03:00] beforehand and then i went to that exam
[1:03:03] he was going to get me through the exam
[1:03:05] now it's up to him whether i got 100 a
[1:03:06] 90 or a 60. but i never failed a class
[1:03:09] in my entire thing
[1:03:12] never failed it and i always went into a
[1:03:14] test with confidence because i knew that
[1:03:15] i had done my part and i'd obeyed his
[1:03:18] word and i didn't have to worry about it
[1:03:19] and he never failed me in that sort of a
[1:03:21] thing he never failed me now guess what
[1:03:23] satan would come and he would say look
[1:03:25] if you don't get the best marks in your
[1:03:26] class you're not going to get the best
[1:03:28] jobs you're not going to have the
[1:03:29] greatest career this is a cutthroat
[1:03:31] world you're going to have to be the
[1:03:32] best of the best of the best and you're
[1:03:33] going to get the best and everything to
[1:03:35] get anywhere in life let me tell you
[1:03:36] that's flat wrong why because he's
[1:03:38] jehovah jireh he's my provider he owns
[1:03:41] the cattle on a thousand hills guess
[1:03:43] what he can make a job out of nothing
[1:03:44] can't he he can give me a job i didn't
[1:03:46] even have to apply for initially it was
[1:03:48] decided before i even put in my formal
[1:03:50] application pretty much they decided i
[1:03:53] was gonna get that job guess what he can
[1:03:55] provide no matter how well i do and how
[1:03:57] bad i do it doesn't matter if i'm in his
[1:03:59] will and i'm doing things his way i know
[1:04:01] that he's got my back and i don't have
[1:04:03] to worry about these things amen what
[1:04:05] does satan say he says you've got to
[1:04:06] earn your way god says i've already made
[1:04:08] a way isn't that what we're looking at
[1:04:10] we've got to say god has made a way and
[1:04:13] it has nothing to do with my skills my
[1:04:14] education what i bring to the table he
[1:04:17] will bless me and provide with me what i
[1:04:19] have need of amen
[1:04:21] amen i didn't have a single fear that i
[1:04:23] wasn't going to make it through
[1:04:24] engineering school because i didn't go
[1:04:25] to church
[1:04:26] or because i went to church rather
[1:04:28] what silliness is that i'll give up god
[1:04:31] so that i can go through university
[1:04:33] right we ought not to do that amen we
[1:04:35] ought to be committed to him the way
[1:04:36] he's committed to us amen
[1:04:38] amen when we've done all par our part we
[1:04:40] stand
[1:04:41] having done everything you can stand on
[1:04:42] his word and trust him to bring us
[1:04:44] through
[1:04:45] this is brother bram now he's speaking
[1:04:47] of paul when he was on the island
[1:04:48] remember and and the snake came out of
[1:04:49] the wood and bit him he said now the
[1:04:51] very holy spirit that made the heavens
[1:04:53] and earth had that man so charged with
[1:04:55] his power till that death and that fang
[1:04:57] of that serpent wouldn't even go into
[1:04:59] his body because his whole body was full
[1:05:02] of the spirit same as it's full of blood
[1:05:04] see and is that right and every little
[1:05:06] cell of blood is a life and there you
[1:05:09] are all charged full of the holy ghost
[1:05:11] why certainly they walked on water
[1:05:12] they'd done great miracles and so forth
[1:05:14] why they were so perfectly in harmony
[1:05:17] with god that first church
[1:05:19] and christian friend until we can get
[1:05:21] back to that we can argue and quarrel
[1:05:23] and fuss with the denominations and over
[1:05:25] and ever get to it denominations won't
[1:05:27] bring it to us bring us to it it's a
[1:05:29] perfect love and a confidence of god is
[1:05:32] just what brings it amen listen you
[1:05:33] won't get it fussing around with message
[1:05:35] believers either you won't get it
[1:05:36] fussing over doctrine and who said and
[1:05:38] quote battles and all this other stuff
[1:05:40] you won't get about it fighting about it
[1:05:42] on social media it's never going to come
[1:05:44] that way amen it's going to come through
[1:05:45] the word in the simplicity of the holy
[1:05:47] spirit revealing himself to you amen how
[1:05:50] did paul not get hurt by that serpent
[1:05:52] brother brahm said the reason it hurts
[1:05:53] you is because you get scared
[1:05:56] he says don't be scared if you can get a
[1:05:58] perfect love of god in your heart that
[1:06:00] knows that this is the truth and god is
[1:06:02] your father and he's taking care of you
[1:06:04] there's nothing can harm you
[1:06:06] i'll give them power they'll tread on
[1:06:08] serpents and so forth and nothing and no
[1:06:10] i shall harm them so if you want to get
[1:06:12] close to god just get close to love
[1:06:15] he says just love god with all your
[1:06:17] heart all your soul all your mind with
[1:06:20] all your strength now listen to this he
[1:06:21] says just wrap yourself in a bundle of
[1:06:24] love
[1:06:26] don't worry about the guy next to you
[1:06:28] don't worry about the sister next to you
[1:06:30] wrap yourself in a bundle of love and
[1:06:32] watch that man that you didn't like like
[1:06:35] you
[1:06:36] he didn't say wrap them in a bundle up
[1:06:37] he said wrap you in a bundle of love the
[1:06:39] only person you can influence or correct
[1:06:41] is yourself
[1:06:43] that's the only person you can do with
[1:06:44] absolute certainty you can apply to
[1:06:46] yourself you can't force anybody to take
[1:06:48] it but he says watch that man that you
[1:06:50] didn't like like you i love that because
[1:06:52] he's taking us way beyond human love
[1:06:54] he's taken us way beyond a point where
[1:06:56] you say well i'm going to decide to love
[1:06:57] that brother or that sister he's not
[1:06:59] even necessarily talking about a brother
[1:07:00] or sister here he said that man he
[1:07:02] didn't say that christian man he said
[1:07:04] watch that man love you
[1:07:06] that didn't like you come back and love
[1:07:07] you like you all over again why because
[1:07:10] you're so surrounded with the love of
[1:07:11] god that everything that they've got
[1:07:12] just bounces off of you
[1:07:14] why you're not scared that he's going to
[1:07:16] hurt you you're not scared that she's
[1:07:18] going to hurt you you're not scared of
[1:07:20] the words they're going to say that it's
[1:07:21] somehow going to deprive you or take
[1:07:23] away from who you are
[1:07:25] what you're so wrapped up in his love
[1:07:26] that nothing else bothers you amen
[1:07:30] he said the world is dying today for
[1:07:32] love christians today we got fine
[1:07:34] scholarly churches wonderful buildings
[1:07:35] but we've got weak pulpits there's
[1:07:38] something wrong the congregation don't
[1:07:40] feel to one another like they used to
[1:07:42] there's something missing the world is
[1:07:44] looking to that christians what we need
[1:07:45] today is a baptism of love for one
[1:07:47] another by this will all men know that
[1:07:49] you're my disciples when you have love
[1:07:51] one for the other and no man has greater
[1:07:53] love than that he will lay down his life
[1:07:55] for your friends
[1:07:57] he says you're no better than anybody
[1:07:59] else and whenever you think you're
[1:08:00] better than somebody else then you're
[1:08:02] nothing that you ought to be the
[1:08:03] scripture says
[1:08:04] see how come you have faith when you're
[1:08:06] expecting honor one from another
[1:08:10] scorches
[1:08:13] you must prefer one another always
[1:08:15] that's the life of christ to prefer your
[1:08:17] brother and sister
[1:08:19] and if they're wrong that's all right
[1:08:22] write that on your fridge
[1:08:24] and if they're wrong it's all right
[1:08:28] you get to influence you you get to
[1:08:30] change you god gets to change them
[1:08:33] and if they're wrong that's all right
[1:08:35] you'll never make them any better by
[1:08:36] kicking them around
[1:08:38] put an arm around and pick them up i
[1:08:40] like this old time of religion i'll tell
[1:08:42] you what it'll do it'll make a tuxedo
[1:08:44] suit sit by a pair of overalls and put
[1:08:46] an arm around one another and call each
[1:08:48] other brother
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:51] amanda i want to take this idea of
[1:08:52] perfect love casts out fear to another
[1:08:54] angle and brother branham says this he
[1:08:56] says god projects his love and his love
[1:08:58] makes you what you are
[1:09:00] amen you're the product of love
[1:09:03] he says oh there's many things we could
[1:09:05] say about it i'm just going to let my
[1:09:06] collar down as it was for a few minutes
[1:09:08] and tell you my canadian friends some of
[1:09:10] the inside so this is just for us
[1:09:13] if you'll excuse it as a personal
[1:09:14] testimony i want you to know something
[1:09:16] on the inside of my life that i found
[1:09:18] because it seems very fitted right at
[1:09:19] this time many people wonders what takes
[1:09:22] place think it's some sort of a mystic
[1:09:24] he says it isn't it's love he's talking
[1:09:26] about the gift on the platform
[1:09:28] he says that's the main thing is loving
[1:09:30] christ not just saying you do but from
[1:09:32] your heart love him i've seen the
[1:09:34] cruelest of devils conquered i've seen
[1:09:37] wild animals floor themselves in the
[1:09:39] presence of god's love because love
[1:09:41] casted the fear away we read that that
[1:09:44] verse and said perfect love casts out
[1:09:46] fear and you say well it casts out fear
[1:09:47] me brother brown says it doesn't just
[1:09:49] cast out fear and you it casts out fear
[1:09:51] and they'll love it when you project
[1:09:53] love to somebody else
[1:09:55] when you're projecting love to somebody
[1:09:56] else then they don't worry there's no
[1:09:58] torment now guess what you ever have a
[1:10:00] dog or or a cat or a pet and they've got
[1:10:02] something wrong and you're trying to fix
[1:10:04] it maybe they've got a thorn dug into
[1:10:06] them or something and and you have to
[1:10:07] pull it out
[1:10:09] and guess what if that animal knows you
[1:10:10] love them it'll sit there and it'll let
[1:10:12] you pull that thing out even though it
[1:10:13] hurts like the dickens
[1:10:15] why because they trust you and they know
[1:10:17] that you're doing it out of love they
[1:10:18] know that you're doing it to them
[1:10:20] because you have to not because you
[1:10:21] enjoy it right it casts out the fear
[1:10:24] they're sitting there it hurts they
[1:10:25] might be quaking because it doesn't feel
[1:10:27] good but they'll let you do it because
[1:10:28] they know you love them brother brown
[1:10:30] says the same thing he says when you're
[1:10:32] dealing with somebody and they know that
[1:10:34] you love them they'll let you say things
[1:10:35] they wouldn't let anybody say they'll
[1:10:37] let you do things they wouldn't let
[1:10:38] anybody else do because they're trusting
[1:10:40] that whatever you're saying or doing is
[1:10:41] for their good and not for your good
[1:10:43] it's to make their life better it's to
[1:10:45] restore them not to make your life
[1:10:46] better or to lift you up or make you
[1:10:48] some kind of an overseer or anything
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] when you love somebody and they know it
[1:10:52] you can do just about anything to them
[1:10:54] and they'll let you do it if they trust
[1:10:55] you the other thing is this if you love
[1:10:58] somebody then you'll let them do just
[1:11:00] about anything to you as well
[1:11:02] sometimes for their good you'll take the
[1:11:03] hurt and you'll see that in pastors so
[1:11:05] many times as they'll take it from
[1:11:07] people that maybe they are not to take
[1:11:08] it from they'll they'll let somebody be
[1:11:10] wrong and they'll let them go at them
[1:11:12] and they'll let them push them a little
[1:11:13] bit why because they they care for that
[1:11:15] person enough that they'll let them take
[1:11:17] out some of their hurts or offenses on
[1:11:19] them and just absorb it because they
[1:11:20] know that that person just needs to let
[1:11:22] some things out and they need to let
[1:11:24] them do that not because they're in the
[1:11:25] right just because they're human and
[1:11:27] they'll take that sort of a beating i
[1:11:29] remember i sat and literally watched a
[1:11:31] man berate a pastor
[1:11:33] many years ago
[1:11:35] and this man was just angry he was upset
[1:11:37] he was just going going going to this
[1:11:38] pastor and that man i knew without a
[1:11:40] shadowed out was flat wrong in what he
[1:11:42] was talking about he was 100 wrong there
[1:11:44] was not a single iota of truth to what
[1:11:47] he was saying or what he was he was he
[1:11:49] was pointing at that pastor and that
[1:11:50] pastor sat there and sat there and took
[1:11:52] it and took it and took it you know why
[1:11:54] because that man had a family and he
[1:11:56] wanted that man and his family to still
[1:11:57] be able to come to church he didn't want
[1:11:59] that family to pay for what that man was
[1:12:01] saying and doing
[1:12:02] and guess what after that was all said
[1:12:04] and done that pastor even apologized to
[1:12:06] that brother for for causing him any
[1:12:08] offense or hurt
[1:12:09] and that man stayed in church and his
[1:12:11] family stayed in church now i'll tell
[1:12:12] you what that man's still paying for
[1:12:14] what he did because he didn't learn his
[1:12:15] lesson
[1:12:16] and he's still paying today and his
[1:12:17] family has paid a price but the pastor
[1:12:19] was not the one that made him pay the
[1:12:20] price right god takes care of his own
[1:12:23] all he said was he he said brother
[1:12:25] basically what he's saying is i'll take
[1:12:26] the abuse
[1:12:27] i'll take the abuse if it'll keep you in
[1:12:29] fellowship i'll let you think what you
[1:12:30] want i'll let you say what you want
[1:12:32] doesn't matter to me i know i can't
[1:12:33] prove i'm right i can't prove you're
[1:12:35] wrong you won't accept it i'll let you
[1:12:37] say what you want just so you can stay
[1:12:38] in fellowship that's what he told me
[1:12:39] after he says that's why i did it
[1:12:40] because his family needs to stay in
[1:12:42] fellowship he does too he just doesn't
[1:12:43] know it because he was ready to go he's
[1:12:45] ready to go and that pastor took that
[1:12:47] abuse why because he loved the sheep
[1:12:49] and he was willing to take the hits for
[1:12:50] the sheep hey the pastor's got to smell
[1:12:52] like the sheep he's got to be out with
[1:12:53] the sheep he's got to lay in the door
[1:12:55] he's got to block anything from going
[1:12:56] out but guess what he's also got to
[1:12:57] block him in right he's trying to keep
[1:12:59] him in there he's not wanting him to go
[1:13:00] out where the wolves and the bears are
[1:13:02] and whatnot amen what that man did it
[1:13:05] can't go on forever and by no means are
[1:13:06] we saying that you get to abuse the
[1:13:07] ministry but they'll take abuse from
[1:13:09] time to time for the sake of your soul
[1:13:11] rather than for their ego
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] brother brown says if you really love
[1:13:16] and you're if you really in your heart
[1:13:18] love people they know it
[1:13:20] you can't fool people they're not that
[1:13:22] dumb you can make out like you do they
[1:13:25] can tell you're only putting on and
[1:13:27] satan can tell when you're putting on
[1:13:28] but he knows when it's real you might
[1:13:30] impersonate it you might make a whole
[1:13:32] lot of things look like it but you'll
[1:13:33] never get the job done until you come
[1:13:35] into christ that's right perfect
[1:13:37] consecrated godly love sold out lock
[1:13:40] stock and barrel come to christ that's
[1:13:42] it friends look true look it's refreshed
[1:13:46] it's like i said last time remember now
[1:13:47] if you're dealing with a spiritual child
[1:13:49] you're dealing with a child they don't
[1:13:50] know that love has many sides they think
[1:13:52] love is only the hugging and the kissing
[1:13:54] and the tucking them into bed but we
[1:13:55] know love has a whole lot of sides if
[1:13:57] you're a parent amen it includes
[1:13:58] discipline it includes spaking it it
[1:14:00] includes saying no and all these
[1:14:02] different things and they don't
[1:14:03] recognize it until they're usually well
[1:14:05] past their teenage years how much you
[1:14:06] truly love them and how much abuse you
[1:14:08] put up with and how many bad attitudes
[1:14:09] you put up with and how many snarky
[1:14:11] comments you put up with because they
[1:14:13] thought that you weren't loving them but
[1:14:14] all along you were loving them and guess
[1:14:16] what you got to have grace for a
[1:14:18] spiritually immature christian the same
[1:14:19] way you do your own children and that's
[1:14:21] to say look i'm going to look past your
[1:14:23] your attitude i'm going to look past
[1:14:24] your response i'm going to look past the
[1:14:25] way you're doing things because i love
[1:14:27] you and i'm going to let god mature you
[1:14:29] and i'm just going to give you the love
[1:14:30] that i need to it doesn't mean you stop
[1:14:31] doing the spankings
[1:14:33] just because your kid doesn't recognize
[1:14:34] that doesn't recognize that you love
[1:14:36] them when you spank them doesn't mean
[1:14:37] you stop doing spankings amen but you're
[1:14:39] not out there trying to do it all the
[1:14:40] time either you don't enjoy it if you
[1:14:42] enjoy spankings you ought not to be
[1:14:43] spanking your kids
[1:14:45] i know a good friend of mine was talking
[1:14:46] to a preacher and he said he said uh you
[1:14:49] know he's talking about the the preacher
[1:14:50] said well sometimes you've got to be
[1:14:52] hard on the church he said yes but you
[1:14:53] don't have to enjoy it
[1:14:56] and that and the preacher said you're
[1:14:58] right i shouldn't
[1:14:59] we're not supposed to enjoy
[1:15:01] straighten people out or saying things
[1:15:03] hard over the pulpit that's not a joy
[1:15:04] for a minister that's not a joy for a
[1:15:06] minister by any means amen
[1:15:09] and then we might have to give some
[1:15:10] tough love from time to time
[1:15:12] but we can't make a ministry out of
[1:15:13] tough love
[1:15:14] and then we got to have a balanced
[1:15:15] ministry in these things
[1:15:17] he says did you ever sorry did you ever
[1:15:19] go out of the morning like i said that
[1:15:21] refreshing feeling the dew's fallen now
[1:15:24] did you ever go to the rose garden now
[1:15:26] it also puts blossoms out aaron's rod
[1:15:28] did and that aroma that fragrance of the
[1:15:30] flower early in the morning why
[1:15:32] everything is still and every seed that
[1:15:34] goes into the ground the dew is what
[1:15:36] makes it lives again it refreshes the
[1:15:38] dirt he said and you take the seed of
[1:15:40] god and put it into a real good flexible
[1:15:43] heart that's not prejudiced and
[1:15:45] indifferent just a nice humble heart and
[1:15:48] put that seed of god in there and let it
[1:15:49] go to groin going growing and let it get
[1:15:52] alone to itself and the dew drops of
[1:15:54] glory go to falling on the soul you'll
[1:15:57] see the sweetest meekest humblest
[1:15:59] christian in your neighborhood that
[1:16:01] you've ever seen he says that's right
[1:16:03] can i put it this way when you're dry
[1:16:05] people suffer
[1:16:06] when you're dry people suffer and when
[1:16:08] you're not refreshed how in the world
[1:16:09] can you be refreshing and then you've
[1:16:11] got to have to give you've got to
[1:16:12] receive to pass along to somebody else
[1:16:14] amen and that refreshing is what it's
[1:16:16] the overcoming of your stubborn nature
[1:16:18] so that something else can come to life
[1:16:20] amen it's putting aside the carnality
[1:16:22] and letting the spirituality come out
[1:16:23] amen the goodness of god listen i'm in
[1:16:25] grump i'm inclined to grumpiness and
[1:16:27] stubbornness
[1:16:28] that's the way i can be so guess what i
[1:16:31] got to be refreshed on a regular basis
[1:16:32] otherwise i get stubborn and grumpy
[1:16:35] so guess what if john's been stubborn
[1:16:36] and grumpy you know that he probably
[1:16:37] hasn't spent too much time lately with
[1:16:39] god
[1:16:40] right i've got to tell and guess what
[1:16:41] most of us have a tell it's our dry
[1:16:43] thing we go back to carnality that's how
[1:16:45] you know you're dry as you're going back
[1:16:47] to your carnality you go back to the way
[1:16:49] you are you were before you ever got
[1:16:51] saved many times
[1:16:53] brother braham said the bible said that
[1:16:54] he that overcometh i'll give him a new
[1:16:56] name i'll put my spirit in him he says
[1:16:59] watch there's an overcoming first you've
[1:17:01] got to overcome these things in order to
[1:17:03] be in christ that's where the church is
[1:17:05] failing in one place overcoming
[1:17:08] overcoming temper overcoming differences
[1:17:10] overcoming church prejudice overcoming
[1:17:12] hatred many people tonight who shout and
[1:17:15] speak with tongues and run up and down
[1:17:16] the aisle and hate their neighbor he
[1:17:18] says brother you're lost yet that's hard
[1:17:20] to say but that's the truth right
[1:17:22] overcome amen he says you can only
[1:17:25] overcome when you say i'm eating manna
[1:17:27] glory to god yes but look from one day
[1:17:29] to the other you get the missed meal
[1:17:31] cramps come on in where the man is fresh
[1:17:33] all the time in other words he says you
[1:17:35] get cramps because you eat something
[1:17:36] from the day before and man is only good
[1:17:38] for a day and then it spoiled and went
[1:17:40] to worm so if you ate the manna from
[1:17:42] yesterday you were eating worms and
[1:17:43] that's definitely going to cause you
[1:17:44] stomach problems
[1:17:45] he says you've got to come in to where
[1:17:47] the man is fresh he says whether your
[1:17:49] neighbor treats you right or not you'll
[1:17:50] love him anyhow that's how you know
[1:17:52] you're eating fresh manna
[1:17:53] that's right whether he agrees with you
[1:17:55] or not you love him anyhow that's the
[1:17:57] way you got to do it that's the hidden
[1:17:59] life that's that consecrated life and
[1:18:01] you're shut off from the things of the
[1:18:03] world you only live in christ remember
[1:18:04] he talked about the believer has to shut
[1:18:06] off christ
[1:18:07] to get out of his presence he's got to
[1:18:09] willingly walk out and he says this is
[1:18:11] what happens he says when you turn on
[1:18:13] christ it shuts out the things of the
[1:18:14] world it's a tap and you can have good
[1:18:16] or bad come in he wants you he's saying
[1:18:18] turn it on to christ so that you get the
[1:18:19] good things out he says you see what i
[1:18:21] mean church i don't want to hurt your
[1:18:23] feelings but i've got to stand with you
[1:18:25] at judgment someday i'm responsible for
[1:18:27] not telling the truth if i know it
[1:18:28] that's right he says oh i believe in all
[1:18:30] the shouting i believe in speaking in
[1:18:32] tongues and i believe in these things
[1:18:33] but brother that's not all that goes
[1:18:35] with it no it isn't that's just one of
[1:18:37] the attributes of it that's right he
[1:18:39] says
[1:18:40] have the real thing first and it'll
[1:18:43] produce the rest of this
[1:18:44] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:18:46] lord have i not done this and cast out
[1:18:48] devils and done all these things in your
[1:18:50] name he'd say depart from me you workers
[1:18:52] of iniquity i didn't even know you see
[1:18:54] be careful
[1:18:56] remember you try and seek after gifts
[1:18:59] instead of seeking the giver was what
[1:19:01] the problem was i mean he was pulling
[1:19:02] people out of the pentecostal experience
[1:19:04] and saying you got to go beyond it and
[1:19:05] they were happy with the pentecostal
[1:19:06] experience because it's super exciting
[1:19:08] to be a pentecostal
[1:19:09] very exciting to be a pentecostal every
[1:19:12] service is amazing
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:14] and that's what you can seek
[1:19:16] but you'll see later brother brown says
[1:19:17] he gets into a service and everybody's
[1:19:18] at the altar and they're weeping and
[1:19:20] crying he's saying we need more of these
[1:19:22] right we need to get serious we need to
[1:19:23] get real we need to get down to where
[1:19:25] god is working in our lives not just
[1:19:26] hooping and hollering in the church
[1:19:29] now brother branham he's telling this is
[1:19:30] a continuation of this quote and he's
[1:19:31] telling the story of the bull that he
[1:19:33] startled in the field he said notice in
[1:19:35] this bull as he rushed on towards me and
[1:19:37] i'm standing there i said now i won't
[1:19:39] bother you and you go lay down and he
[1:19:42] run with him five feet and he stopped
[1:19:43] and looked so depleted he looked one way
[1:19:46] and then the other turned around and
[1:19:47] walked over and laid down and i walked
[1:19:49] within 10 foot of that bull right across
[1:19:50] the field he never moved again and i
[1:19:52] went over and after i got across the
[1:19:55] field and stood there i come to myself
[1:19:58] and i thought what happened he says then
[1:20:00] i began to weep and raise up my hands
[1:20:02] and praise god what had happened with
[1:20:05] that bull when he says mr bole i'm sorry
[1:20:07] i'm on his i'm on his mission i'm on his
[1:20:10] purpose i didn't mean to bother you that
[1:20:11] wasn't brother branham
[1:20:13] this was beyond the humanity this was
[1:20:15] beyond the carnality this was beyond him
[1:20:17] just being a prophet he says i came to
[1:20:19] myself and i began to weep and praise
[1:20:21] god why because god spoke out of a man
[1:20:23] there and he said i'm sorry
[1:20:25] but he says but you need to go lay down.
[1:20:28] that's what happened there was brother
[1:20:29] branham got raised to a new level of
[1:20:31] love that he'd never experienced before
[1:20:33] because he wasn't mad and he wasn't
[1:20:34] scared
[1:20:35] he was sorry and apologetic but he loved
[1:20:38] that animal he loved it enough to say
[1:20:40] i'm sorry
[1:20:42] but he said but you need to go lay down
[1:20:43] because i'm on his i'm on his mission
[1:20:45] i'm on his will i'm on his purpose so
[1:20:47] you got to get out of my way
[1:20:48] but i'm sorry
[1:20:50] that takes a profit
[1:20:52] that takes a real experience to say
[1:20:55] i'm sorry but you're going to have to
[1:20:57] back down
[1:20:59] to an animal we won't even do it to a
[1:21:00] human half the time and he did it to an
[1:21:02] animal
[1:21:04] he said i was cutting my yard last
[1:21:05] summer and i was going through with the
[1:21:06] power mower how many knows what a horn
[1:21:08] it is then that lays that big nest
[1:21:10] there's a bunch of them that made a nest
[1:21:11] out there in the corner of the fence in
[1:21:12] a little bush like and i was running
[1:21:14] this paramour through there and in the
[1:21:15] backyard nobody seen me i took off my
[1:21:17] shirt and i was just mowing away and i
[1:21:19] hit this fence and all of a sudden i
[1:21:21] forgot those hornets were there and i
[1:21:22] was covered all over in a few minutes
[1:21:24] with hornets and those great big fellows
[1:21:26] and no shirt on he says well at first it
[1:21:29] scared me but then it happened again
[1:21:33] something and i thought poor little
[1:21:35] fellow over there in that nest and here
[1:21:37] i he says they weren't bothering me i
[1:21:40] disturbed them
[1:21:41] he says i wish i know what it was but
[1:21:43] it's something that happens what is it
[1:21:46] this is a new experience for him this is
[1:21:47] beyond anything he's ever experienced
[1:21:49] this is beyond him experiencing things
[1:21:51] in the meetings and great signs and
[1:21:52] wonders this is a whole new experience
[1:21:54] in christ that he's getting here where
[1:21:56] he says i felt sorry for them poor
[1:22:00] little fellas
[1:22:01] how many times would we say to a bee or
[1:22:03] a hornet poor little fella
[1:22:06] i disturbed you and that's why you're
[1:22:07] coming after me
[1:22:09] he says at first i was scared but then i
[1:22:10] thought oh poor little fellas and i
[1:22:12] thought poor little fellas and here's
[1:22:14] what i said i said now you little
[1:22:16] creatures of god god created you i'm
[1:22:18] god's servant and i gotta hurry with
[1:22:19] this yard because he said he keep trying
[1:22:21] to do the lawn and then somebody come to
[1:22:23] be prayed for and any back and forth and
[1:22:24] the lawn would never get done so he was
[1:22:26] rushing out there to just get it done
[1:22:28] finally he says now you're little
[1:22:29] creatures of god god created you i'm
[1:22:32] god's servant i got to hurry with this
[1:22:34] yard and they were just the buzzing
[1:22:35] around and i wasn't afraid of them and i
[1:22:37] said now you run right back into your
[1:22:39] nest in the name of the lord jesus
[1:22:40] because i got to hurry him all this yard
[1:22:42] i won't bother you no more because god's
[1:22:44] servants are waiting to be prayed for
[1:22:46] and brother i'll meet you at the
[1:22:47] judgment they circled around me a few
[1:22:49] times and one took the lead and the
[1:22:51] whole bunch of them went right back into
[1:22:53] the nest and quieted down he said
[1:22:55] atmosphere
[1:22:57] god
[1:22:58] that's right there's something about it
[1:23:00] look at his response now he was fearful
[1:23:03] but he says then something rose up he
[1:23:05] says and then i wasn't scared anymore
[1:23:08] perfect love cast out his fear and it
[1:23:10] caused them to lose their fear and go
[1:23:13] back to where they needed to be
[1:23:15] that's an amazing thing when you think
[1:23:16] about it amen what is it when you do
[1:23:18] that i've said it before when you act in
[1:23:20] love it makes the other person drop
[1:23:22] their sword because they see you're not
[1:23:24] holding a sword of love
[1:23:26] that's not what we're holding with that
[1:23:27] amen love conquers all but it doesn't do
[1:23:29] it by blunt force trauma man doesn't do
[1:23:31] it by beating them over the head
[1:23:33] what does it do it lets them see that
[1:23:35] you're there for them not there for
[1:23:36] yourself because when you go in for
[1:23:38] yourself you're not loving them you're
[1:23:39] loving yourself more than them
[1:23:41] right but when they see that you're not
[1:23:43] in it for you you're in it for them then
[1:23:44] they start to drop their weapon they
[1:23:46] start to lower their guard and they
[1:23:47] start to realize okay this isn't what i
[1:23:49] thought and then their fear drop starts
[1:23:51] to drop and then trust starts to come in
[1:23:53] and then love starts to come in and all
[1:23:54] of a sudden you can sort things out
[1:23:56] right what is it you're just doing what
[1:23:58] you need to do
[1:23:59] and if they're in the way listen
[1:24:01] sometimes we step into people's hearts
[1:24:03] sometimes we step into people's old
[1:24:04] offenses sometimes we step into their
[1:24:06] old history and we don't have a clue
[1:24:08] listen i came from a place where there
[1:24:09] were landmines buried everywhere due to
[1:24:11] church splits and ministerial issues and
[1:24:13] all that guess what i stepped on a lot
[1:24:15] of landmines
[1:24:16] stepped on a lot of landmines and you
[1:24:17] don't even know why people are reacting
[1:24:19] the way you do and you can't take it
[1:24:20] personally
[1:24:22] you stepped on their tail so to speak
[1:24:23] right you step on a dog he's going to
[1:24:25] nip you usually
[1:24:27] sometimes we step on people's tails and
[1:24:29] they nip us and we get all worked up
[1:24:31] but listen if we're walking in love them
[1:24:33] when they get worked up we don't rile
[1:24:34] back we don't get worked up back just
[1:24:36] because they're mad doesn't make us mad
[1:24:38] just because their hurt doesn't make us
[1:24:39] hurt just because they're offended
[1:24:40] doesn't cause us to become offended
[1:24:42] right what is it at first we might be
[1:24:44] hurt at first we might be scared but
[1:24:46] something's supposed to rise up and say
[1:24:47] whoa
[1:24:48] this reaction is way more than what i
[1:24:50] just did
[1:24:51] i have no idea what caused it but this
[1:24:54] isn't obviously isn't about me so i'm
[1:24:56] just gonna back away
[1:24:57] sorry
[1:24:58] didn't mean to do it don't know what i
[1:24:59] did but i love you let's move on right
[1:25:02] and hopefully they'll drop their sword
[1:25:04] amen what is it brother braham said
[1:25:05] atmosphere god
[1:25:07] that's what you're looking for is
[1:25:09] atmosphere god in your situation we need
[1:25:11] oxygen to breathe right atmosphere
[1:25:13] oxygen our atmosphere ought to be the
[1:25:15] love of christ in our lives every single
[1:25:17] day amen what is it we talked about that
[1:25:19] gushing that overflowing and we're going
[1:25:20] to get to it a little bit amen what is
[1:25:22] it that's flowing out and it suppresses
[1:25:24] all of your humanity all of your
[1:25:26] instinct
[1:25:27] they say humans are the only ones that
[1:25:29] can stop and choose their reaction
[1:25:30] animals can't do it animals act out of
[1:25:32] instinct you bite an animal that's going
[1:25:34] to whip around and bite you or charge
[1:25:35] you or do anything but a human if
[1:25:37] brother bob came up and he whacked me on
[1:25:39] the shoulder guess what
[1:25:40] i wouldn't automatically whack him back
[1:25:41] because i'm not an animal
[1:25:43] we have the ability to stop and choose
[1:25:45] our reaction
[1:25:46] and if you're a believer then your
[1:25:47] reaction ought to be love and christ
[1:25:49] every single time amen now listen this
[1:25:52] doesn't happen overnight i'm almost 43
[1:25:54] years old and this is not the way i do
[1:25:56] it every time and i've talked to the
[1:25:57] slightly older people in the church and
[1:25:59] they they assure me that this is not the
[1:26:00] way they react every time
[1:26:03] right this is something that happens
[1:26:04] over time and it's a constant work in
[1:26:06] our life amen this kind of love listen
[1:26:08] the prophet i mean when he's preaching
[1:26:10] that is is 1955 so i mean he's well into
[1:26:13] his ministry and he's just starting to
[1:26:14] experience things like this and that's a
[1:26:16] prophet that's a man that's completely
[1:26:18] set aside dedicated has a specific call
[1:26:20] in his life and then he's not a mere
[1:26:22] christian the way some of us are in
[1:26:23] those things god was doing something in
[1:26:25] him what was it it was a first fruit it
[1:26:26] was a waving of the sheaf so that we
[1:26:28] could see what we were coming to in our
[1:26:29] life as well
[1:26:32] brother braham says he's talking about
[1:26:34] the purifying of gold and he says and
[1:26:35] now they cook that and then they skim it
[1:26:37] all off all the all the dross and they
[1:26:39] just keep cooking it and cooking it
[1:26:41] until it's pure going gold boiled down
[1:26:44] to nothing but 100 gold
[1:26:47] it's not 100 gold the first time you
[1:26:49] don't have 100 of god you're not pure
[1:26:51] christian
[1:26:53] the first time around
[1:26:54] and then there are many many many
[1:26:56] circles around this wagon and then we're
[1:26:58] going to go around and around and around
[1:27:00] him and there's a lot of cooking and
[1:27:01] cooking and cooking that happens for the
[1:27:03] believer he says what and that's the way
[1:27:05] god does it in his church he pours the
[1:27:07] holy spirit on it and cooks down in
[1:27:09] there till he throws out all the
[1:27:11] worldliness and the differences and the
[1:27:13] selfishness and all this until he just
[1:27:15] boils it out of every individual that
[1:27:17] will come to him amen so what does that
[1:27:20] tell me that tells me this isn't a
[1:27:21] church affair
[1:27:22] he doesn't boil it out of a church he
[1:27:24] boils it out of every individual that
[1:27:26] will come to him and submit themselves
[1:27:28] to it now it happens at church it
[1:27:30] happens through the preaching of the
[1:27:31] word it happens under the atmosphere of
[1:27:32] the holy spirit but it happens to
[1:27:34] individuals that will open themselves up
[1:27:36] to it that will willingly submit
[1:27:37] themselves to the working hand of god in
[1:27:39] their lives amen doesn't mean we don't
[1:27:41] have love if you're not 100 doesn't mean
[1:27:43] you have it just means that you're going
[1:27:44] to have it in certain areas of your life
[1:27:46] and you'll be able to handle certain
[1:27:47] situations and as you grow and mature
[1:27:49] then you'll get to a higher and higher
[1:27:51] level to where somebody can do just
[1:27:52] about anything where the scripture says
[1:27:54] that you know if he slaps your face on
[1:27:56] one side then turn the cheek to the
[1:27:57] other not many of us can do that we
[1:27:59] don't get slapped very often but we get
[1:28:00] slapped verbally don't we we get slapped
[1:28:03] by people's emotions we get slapped by
[1:28:04] situations and how many times can we say
[1:28:06] try it on the other side now
[1:28:08] that's what we're looking for man is
[1:28:10] that ability to just stop and say lord
[1:28:12] where's your love going to do what's it
[1:28:14] going to do in this situation i know
[1:28:15] what i want to do in my flesh in my mind
[1:28:18] i know what i want to do but that
[1:28:19] doesn't seem very christian
[1:28:20] let's see what your love can do in this
[1:28:22] situation
[1:28:23] now i want to transition over to grace
[1:28:25] here because
[1:28:26] brother braham said when love projects
[1:28:28] grace goes to work
[1:28:30] i'm paraphrasing but basically god's
[1:28:32] love produces grace that has an effect
[1:28:33] on the believer i would say this that
[1:28:35] god's love produces grace that produces
[1:28:37] a believer right because by faith
[1:28:39] through what grace
[1:28:41] we're saved so that love goes forth and
[1:28:43] then when that love goes forth it
[1:28:45] projects grace and when grace projects
[1:28:47] it produces the object brother branham
[1:28:48] would say we don't exist outside of
[1:28:50] god's grace we're under a grace covenant
[1:28:52] if you go outside of the grace covenant
[1:28:53] now you're under law
[1:28:55] and you don't want to be under law
[1:28:57] there's no covering for law anymore
[1:28:58] law's done law is fulfilled if you
[1:29:00] choose to go back to law all you find is
[1:29:01] judgment there's no grace back there
[1:29:04] but second corinthians 9 this is the
[1:29:05] effect of grace in the believer's life
[1:29:07] and it says and god is able to make all
[1:29:09] grace abound toward you that ye always
[1:29:13] having all sufficiency in all things may
[1:29:15] abound in every good work
[1:29:17] there's a lot of abounding and there's a
[1:29:19] lot of all in there and anytime god says
[1:29:21] all i like to pay attention because all
[1:29:23] is everything
[1:29:24] if he says all then that's a good thing
[1:29:27] there's no limit to what he's talking
[1:29:28] about he's saying i'll give you
[1:29:30] everything when he says all amen so he
[1:29:32] says god extends all of his grace to you
[1:29:34] and it abounds that word abound means
[1:29:36] overflow so if he said he's saying if
[1:29:38] you got the grace of god then it
[1:29:39] overflows your life
[1:29:41] and if it overflows that means it's
[1:29:42] going to have an effect on somebody else
[1:29:44] because it's flowing out of you to
[1:29:45] someplace else it's got to go to
[1:29:47] somebody else so that means if you've
[1:29:48] experienced god's grace if you're
[1:29:50] experiencing god's grace then there
[1:29:52] shall be an overflow in your life of
[1:29:53] that grace and it should go to somebody
[1:29:55] else the scripture says that the grace
[1:29:57] of god gives you all sufficiency in all
[1:29:59] things so that you can abound in every
[1:30:02] good work
[1:30:04] so you have a certain amount all
[1:30:06] and it makes you abound in every good
[1:30:08] work
[1:30:08] amen it's a work of god this grace it's
[1:30:10] all from him there's nothing we've done
[1:30:12] to warrant it as we've covered it before
[1:30:13] there are no performance metrics for a
[1:30:15] christian if you reach you know a 70
[1:30:17] score on your christianity then you get
[1:30:19] to go to heaven that's not what we're
[1:30:20] talking about anymore that is done you
[1:30:22] have christ righteousness you have 100
[1:30:24] on the test regardless of what you do
[1:30:26] you're there because he took your pace
[1:30:28] and he paid your price amen grace is
[1:30:30] undeserved it's unmerited by definition
[1:30:32] therefore you cannot do anything to
[1:30:34] receive it it's given to you regardless
[1:30:37] of what you do
[1:30:38] now listen to this brother brahm says
[1:30:40] sovereign grace is from a sovereign one
[1:30:43] sovereign what can it do sovereign can
[1:30:46] do whatever it wants to
[1:30:49] listen to this now sovereign grace can
[1:30:51] only be given by one that's sovereign
[1:30:53] and god is sovereign so he can give
[1:30:55] sovereign grace therefore being
[1:30:57] sovereign grace don't have to ask
[1:30:59] anybody it doesn't have to it does what
[1:31:02] it wants to isn't that wonderful
[1:31:05] sovereign grace doesn't answer to the
[1:31:07] pastor he doesn't answer to the ministry
[1:31:09] doesn't answer to the laity it doesn't
[1:31:10] answer to the deacons sovereign grace
[1:31:12] answers to no one but the one that gives
[1:31:14] it and he chooses whom he will choose
[1:31:16] the scripture says he'll have mercy who
[1:31:18] will have mercy on
[1:31:19] right it does it and it doesn't have to
[1:31:21] ask questions that's a wonderful kind of
[1:31:23] grace
[1:31:24] listen when you extend grace to somebody
[1:31:27] you don't answer to anybody else
[1:31:29] when you extend god's grace to somebody
[1:31:31] else you don't have to answer to
[1:31:32] somebody else why are you letting them
[1:31:33] get away with it why aren't you doing
[1:31:35] listen i'm extending grace
[1:31:37] i don't have to answer
[1:31:38] there is no reason for grace except to
[1:31:40] give grace
[1:31:42] that's all
[1:31:43] there's no reason you can't explain it
[1:31:44] you're just saying i'm giving it
[1:31:47] it's sovereign to you you get to choose
[1:31:48] just like god does you want to express
[1:31:50] grace you give it you don't have to
[1:31:51] answer to anybody else for it
[1:31:54] he says isn't that wonderful it doesn't
[1:31:55] have to ask can i do this or shall i do
[1:31:58] this can i must i will i doesn't do it
[1:32:01] it does it itself grace is sovereign
[1:32:04] therefore listen the effect of this
[1:32:06] sovereign grace he can save the vilest
[1:32:08] he can save the worst he can save the
[1:32:10] impurist he can save the immoralist he
[1:32:12] can save the sickest hallelujah
[1:32:14] amen amen paul says i was the worst
[1:32:17] among you i was the chiefest of sinners
[1:32:19] and it saved him so it can definitely
[1:32:21] save us he says he can save a wretch
[1:32:23] like me and he did
[1:32:25] what is it it's grace william branham a
[1:32:28] drunkard's son that don't make any
[1:32:30] difference the grace of god saved me me
[1:32:32] i'm a woman's daughter there was no good
[1:32:34] don't make any difference the grace of
[1:32:36] god saved you it's sovereign it has to
[1:32:38] ask nobody nothing amen i'm so glad of
[1:32:41] that hallelujah can take the vilest
[1:32:43] sinner and make him white as snow and
[1:32:45] don't have to ask anybody about it oh it
[1:32:47] can do it because it's sovereign you say
[1:32:49] well i'm completely overcome i'm
[1:32:51] drowning satan's got a hold on me
[1:32:52] doesn't matter his grace is all
[1:32:54] sufficient for you amen you say there's
[1:32:57] you look at your loved ones they're so
[1:32:59] far gone
[1:33:00] sometimes we say what they're too far
[1:33:02] gone
[1:33:03] listen if he can save rahab he can save
[1:33:06] your daughter
[1:33:08] she was as far gone as we'd ever want
[1:33:09] our daughters to go if he could save
[1:33:11] rahab he can save your daughter you say
[1:33:13] well they're stuck in denominations
[1:33:15] they've left the message listen if he
[1:33:17] can save saul and turn him into paul the
[1:33:19] prophet of the age who is stuck in his
[1:33:21] nose and books from a from a youngest
[1:33:23] age and was the greatest of all
[1:33:24] denominational believers he can save our
[1:33:26] lost ones that have gone out into the
[1:33:28] denominations or left the message amen
[1:33:30] grace doesn't answer to anybody except
[1:33:32] the one that gives it and it can do
[1:33:34] anything
[1:33:36] anything there's no limit to grace
[1:33:38] because there's no reason to do it
[1:33:40] so there's no limit to it
[1:33:43] brother branham i didn't put it in here
[1:33:44] for the sake of time but he talked about
[1:33:45] that that that boy that killed the
[1:33:47] king's son remember
[1:33:49] and he went to the boy and he said why'd
[1:33:51] you do it he said i don't know i just
[1:33:52] did it i wasn't in my right mind he says
[1:33:55] i'm so sorry i didn't mean to do it i'm
[1:33:56] sorry for the pain i caused he says i
[1:33:58] know i've got to die and i'm willing to
[1:33:59] die says i just want you to know i'm
[1:34:01] sorry and the king said he opened it up
[1:34:03] he said pardon him put my son's robe on
[1:34:05] him he's my son now and he took him out
[1:34:07] and he presented them to the people
[1:34:09] that's what grace can do
[1:34:11] you're crazy king doesn't matter it's my
[1:34:13] grace to give and i give it to him
[1:34:15] right he was sorry i gave it to him
[1:34:17] doesn't have to answer to anybody amen
[1:34:21] what does this grace look like in our
[1:34:22] life paul says it has an effect and he
[1:34:24] says it gives us all sufficiency in all
[1:34:27] things amen all sufficiency in all
[1:34:30] things that sufficiency means a perfect
[1:34:32] condition of life in which no aid or
[1:34:35] support is needed
[1:34:38] sufficiency of the necessities of life
[1:34:40] and a mind contented with its lot
[1:34:43] that's the sufficiency we're talking
[1:34:45] about brother bryan would say this he
[1:34:46] says i'm just as i said this morning my
[1:34:49] whole makeup is grace a lot of people
[1:34:51] say now you scratch my back and i'll
[1:34:53] scratch yours yeah you do something for
[1:34:55] me and i'll do something for you
[1:34:57] that's not grace grace is if your back
[1:34:59] is itching i'll scratch it anyhow
[1:35:00] whether you scratch mine or not you can
[1:35:02] slap me on the face and say my back
[1:35:04] needs scratching i'll scratch it
[1:35:08] it's one thing to say i'll scratch yours
[1:35:10] even if you don't scratch mine but he
[1:35:12] says if you slap my face and then say i
[1:35:14] have a need he says i'll meet your need
[1:35:16] that's the kind of grace he's talking
[1:35:18] about
[1:35:18] see that's it do something i don't
[1:35:21] believe in works i believe that works is
[1:35:23] love works is the manifestation that
[1:35:25] grace has taken place he says i don't
[1:35:27] live true to my wife because i believe
[1:35:29] she divorced me if i didn't i live true
[1:35:31] to her because i love her i don't preach
[1:35:33] the gospel because i think i go to hell
[1:35:35] if i didn't i preach the gospel because
[1:35:37] i love him certainly
[1:35:39] he says you think i'd cross these stormy
[1:35:41] seas and then planes diving back and
[1:35:42] forth and lightning flashing around and
[1:35:44] everything else and almost any minute
[1:35:46] and everybody's screaming and hail
[1:35:47] mary's going on through the plane and
[1:35:49] everything then people swinging in them
[1:35:51] safety belts and the pilot saying we've
[1:35:52] got enough gas left last 15 minutes
[1:35:55] longer and don't know where we're at he
[1:35:57] says do you think i'd do that just for
[1:35:58] the fun of doing it huh do you think i'd
[1:36:01] get back out there in the jungle where
[1:36:02] german soldiers had to put their arms
[1:36:04] around me like this each night and take
[1:36:05] me in and out of the meeting until the
[1:36:06] holy spirit began to perform miracles he
[1:36:08] had to be surrounded by men so he
[1:36:10] wouldn't get shot
[1:36:11] he says communist setting out there with
[1:36:12] knight scopes to shoot me a mile away do
[1:36:14] you think i do that just for the fun of
[1:36:16] it
[1:36:18] he says it's because something in me
[1:36:20] loves they're humans that christ died
[1:36:23] for paul said i'm not only willing to go
[1:36:25] up to jerusalem but i'm going up there
[1:36:26] to be crucified i'm going up to die i'm
[1:36:29] going up there to die for the cause of
[1:36:30] the lord it's something love that
[1:36:33] constrains you that makes you
[1:36:35] that's exactly right
[1:36:37] he says that you would have all
[1:36:39] sufficiency to abound in all things what
[1:36:41] he's saying is that he'll give you
[1:36:42] everything you need to take you where he
[1:36:44] wants you to go
[1:36:46] amen and it'll take you into places you
[1:36:47] don't want to go
[1:36:49] take you to places you don't want to be
[1:36:51] dealing with situations you don't want
[1:36:52] to deal with and people you don't
[1:36:54] particularly like
[1:36:56] why because you're there to express
[1:36:58] grace
[1:36:59] you're there to express love
[1:37:02] paul says that by this grace you have
[1:37:04] all you need in every aspect of life and
[1:37:07] you're content with what you've been
[1:37:08] given
[1:37:09] so in other words what god has called
[1:37:11] you to do he equips you for it
[1:37:15] whatever you need he says you're going
[1:37:17] to bound to every good work every good
[1:37:18] work can only be the working of the
[1:37:19] kingdom of god everything you need to do
[1:37:21] in the kingdom of god he says god's
[1:37:23] grace has already provided it for you to
[1:37:25] get the job done
[1:37:27] that's what we're talking about here all
[1:37:29] sufficiency in all things man if we'd
[1:37:31] only realized that if we'd only accept
[1:37:33] that what he's called me to do he's
[1:37:35] gonna give me everything i need to get
[1:37:36] to the finish line with it amen
[1:37:38] now that doesn't mean you look at your
[1:37:40] natural traits and say well this is what
[1:37:41] he's equipped me with therefore this is
[1:37:42] what i am
[1:37:44] or this is what i'm supposed to do
[1:37:46] listen just because you can speak
[1:37:47] doesn't make you a minister just because
[1:37:48] you can sing doesn't make you a song
[1:37:49] leader
[1:37:50] right you have to a lot of times learn
[1:37:52] to lay it down and humble yourself and
[1:37:54] get taught and mature a bit and maybe
[1:37:56] he'll use it but guess what maybe he'll
[1:37:58] tell you to lay it down as well
[1:37:59] maybe you have to do something else and
[1:38:01] he's going to have to grow you up in
[1:38:02] those places and you're really going to
[1:38:03] need faith because you don't naturally
[1:38:05] have it you know paul didn't paul wasn't
[1:38:08] a good speaker you know that
[1:38:09] paul wasn't a good speaker they said
[1:38:11] speech is mean it's not it's not he's
[1:38:13] not polished he's not a good speaker
[1:38:14] utica fell asleep listening to paul
[1:38:16] that's how bad he was
[1:38:17] right
[1:38:18] but yet he was the prophet of the age he
[1:38:20] was called the speaker he was called the
[1:38:21] right he was called to do all of these
[1:38:22] things right but don't rest on your
[1:38:24] natural traits and say well that's the
[1:38:25] automatic you know alignment with what
[1:38:27] god wants me to do no no no we don't do
[1:38:30] that
[1:38:31] he said times may be hard god has not
[1:38:33] promised a flowery bed of ease but he
[1:38:35] has promised grace sufficient for every
[1:38:37] trial that can hit you that's right he
[1:38:39] says yes indeed grace is sufficient now
[1:38:42] he's on a flowery bed not he's on a
[1:38:44] flowery bed of ease but he promised
[1:38:46] grace to overcome in every temptation
[1:38:48] and when a cross gets heavy
[1:38:50] christ promised to be with you
[1:38:53] that's what we were talking about paul
[1:38:54] said that we would abound to every good
[1:38:57] work amen we want to live in the
[1:38:59] overflow
[1:39:01] and it starts with grace for ourselves
[1:39:03] so that we can give grace to those that
[1:39:04] come up around us amen we're pouring out
[1:39:06] we're bubbling out we've got a spring of
[1:39:08] living water inside of us like the
[1:39:10] scripture talks about amen so that what
[1:39:12] nothing can quench it and nothing can
[1:39:14] restrain it
[1:39:15] listen you fill a pipe up and you keep
[1:39:17] putting pressure on it it's going to
[1:39:18] blow eventually i don't care how big you
[1:39:20] make it i don't care how strong you make
[1:39:21] it you put enough pressure behind it
[1:39:23] it's going to blow and that's the way
[1:39:24] the christian life is you put enough god
[1:39:26] behind you it's going to overflow
[1:39:27] eventually you can put all sorts of
[1:39:30] of whatever you want on top of it but
[1:39:31] it's going to blow eventually i mean if
[1:39:32] you've got it inside you it's going to
[1:39:34] let go
[1:39:37] he says that's the way people do today
[1:39:38] when fear strikes them when they're
[1:39:40] right in the path of duty listen brother
[1:39:42] let me say this if you're walking in the
[1:39:44] light and having fellowship with god and
[1:39:46] with his people and the holy spirit is
[1:39:48] upon you and you meet an obstacle right
[1:39:50] in the path of duty don't stop just keep
[1:39:53] pressing on god will make a way through
[1:39:55] it that's one of the greatest
[1:39:56] experiences of my life is to see god
[1:39:59] when i can't get over it can't get under
[1:40:01] it can't get around it or anyway god
[1:40:03] opens up a way and i go through it
[1:40:05] somehow or another his grace is
[1:40:08] sufficient to carry us through it
[1:40:10] now for us when we would say sufficient
[1:40:12] you know if i said i want a full glass
[1:40:14] and i was to put it up here we'd say
[1:40:16] sufficient would be to fill it to the
[1:40:17] top
[1:40:18] we'd say that's sufficient
[1:40:20] or we'd say i want enough to quench my
[1:40:22] thirst and so we'd fill it up exactly as
[1:40:23] the deacons had you know what god's
[1:40:25] sufficiency looks like
[1:40:26] overflowing
[1:40:28] more than you need that's what god's
[1:40:30] sufficiency looks like more than you
[1:40:32] could ask more than you could ever need
[1:40:34] it not only meets the need but it goes
[1:40:35] beyond the need and it helps somebody
[1:40:37] else's need as well that's the kind of
[1:40:38] sufficiency we're talking about it's not
[1:40:40] just enough for you but it's enough for
[1:40:42] the people around you as well because
[1:40:43] they're feeding off of the grace and the
[1:40:44] love that's coming out of your life as
[1:40:46] well
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:48] so the question is brother braham says
[1:40:50] what if you're walking in the light
[1:40:52] having fellowship with god the holy
[1:40:53] spirit's upon you
[1:40:55] the question is what kind of work are we
[1:40:56] doing with it if we're supposed to
[1:40:58] abound in every good work are we doing
[1:41:00] good work or are we doing satan's work
[1:41:02] what are we putting our time and energy
[1:41:04] into because if we're doing it it's
[1:41:05] going to be abounding it's going to be
[1:41:07] growing it's going to be expressing
[1:41:08] itself it's going to be coming out into
[1:41:10] good things for the kingdom of god not
[1:41:12] for myself not for my ministry not for
[1:41:14] my ego not for my reputation but it's
[1:41:16] going to be doing good things for the
[1:41:18] kingdom of god and it'll be jonathan
[1:41:19] curlett minimum and it'll be god maximum
[1:41:21] every single time right but it's got to
[1:41:23] abound to a good work amen an overflow
[1:41:26] of god cannot benefit satan's kingdom if
[1:41:28] your overflow is benefiting satan's
[1:41:30] kingdom then you're under a wrong
[1:41:31] anointing and if you're if your overflow
[1:41:33] is leading you to mess around with
[1:41:34] satan's kingdom then you're definitely
[1:41:36] not in the overflow of the holy spirit
[1:41:37] it can't be
[1:41:39] he says brother god gave the holy spirit
[1:41:41] god's love to control the church not
[1:41:43] smart educated but love gifts go in the
[1:41:46] church but it doesn't control the church
[1:41:48] love controls the church
[1:41:50] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:41:52] only begotten son his love constrained
[1:41:54] him to do it and when a love is
[1:41:56] constrained then sovereign grace
[1:41:58] projects its object may i say that again
[1:42:00] when divine love is projected grace
[1:42:03] produces its object and god so loved the
[1:42:06] world so much till sovereign grace
[1:42:07] projected a savior to the world yes
[1:42:10] indeed and when you love god so much
[1:42:12] sovereign grace will project you to the
[1:42:14] baptism of the holy ghost to do what
[1:42:17] make you live and love and be a real
[1:42:20] christian amen amen grace projects when
[1:42:23] you receive god's love is what he says
[1:42:24] he says and god's love will bring you
[1:42:26] right to the holy ghost but then what
[1:42:28] are you going to do after that
[1:42:29] because it's got to be a chain he gives
[1:42:31] it to you so we can't give somebody the
[1:42:32] holy ghost but we can show them the holy
[1:42:34] ghost that they can desire we can show
[1:42:36] them the life of a real christian amen
[1:42:38] like brother branham when he had that
[1:42:39] guy we talked about last service where
[1:42:41] he was talking about that man that that
[1:42:42] just ripped him to shreds but at the end
[1:42:44] the guy said i'll tell you one thing you
[1:42:45] got the spirit of christ
[1:42:47] brother brown says well then which
[1:42:48] spirit am i of if i got the spirit of
[1:42:50] christ then i can't be wrong here
[1:42:52] right
[1:42:53] and people get into a paradox where they
[1:42:55] say yeah it's a real christian but he's
[1:42:56] wrong well you can't have that
[1:42:58] that doesn't make any sense
[1:43:00] right have you got the spirit of christ
[1:43:01] it's going to show around you right amen
[1:43:03] amen but grace doesn't always feel good
[1:43:05] at least god's grace
[1:43:06] god's grace includes conviction god's
[1:43:09] grace includes correction because he
[1:43:10] says you're a bastard if he doesn't do
[1:43:12] it
[1:43:13] right but it also includes what the pat
[1:43:15] on the back the encouragement includes
[1:43:17] the love all of these different things
[1:43:19] amen grace tells us the truth even when
[1:43:21] we don't want to hear it
[1:43:22] right because the world doesn't do that
[1:43:24] they say i'm living my truth or accept
[1:43:27] my truth listen that's not the grace of
[1:43:29] god the grace of god tells you the truth
[1:43:31] regardless of whether or not you want to
[1:43:32] hear it but it's always done in love
[1:43:34] amen that grace is sufficient to meet
[1:43:36] the need amen it has nothing to do with
[1:43:38] where the other person's at
[1:43:40] if you're overflowing it has nothing to
[1:43:41] do with them does it right the overflow
[1:43:43] in you has nothing to do with where
[1:43:44] they're at that's why you can give it is
[1:43:46] because it has nothing to do with them
[1:43:47] it's just coming out of you naturally
[1:43:50] brother brown would say think of it love
[1:43:51] and grace are sisters twin sisters you
[1:43:54] can't have grace without having love
[1:43:56] they're twin sisters exactly right and
[1:43:58] before you can have grace you have to
[1:43:59] have love before you can actually sow
[1:44:01] somebody a favor you love them right or
[1:44:04] wrong you have to love them anyhow or
[1:44:06] you can't see love and grace is the same
[1:44:08] thing they're just twin sisters that's
[1:44:10] all we can't see one without the other
[1:44:12] for god so loved the world he gave his
[1:44:13] only begotten son he shed his grace and
[1:44:16] brought it in our hearts through the
[1:44:17] holy ghost see there's just nothing you
[1:44:20] can do without working one with the
[1:44:21] other the grace the grace of god
[1:44:24] is what saves us amen and that's not
[1:44:27] something you just receive once amen the
[1:44:29] grace of god is every single day
[1:44:31] every single day his mercies are new
[1:44:32] every day that tells me his grace is new
[1:44:34] every day right his goodness is new
[1:44:36] every day and all these things so this
[1:44:37] is grace that's continuously coming out
[1:44:39] of him what to come to us and then it
[1:44:42] goes to us and it comes out and it goes
[1:44:43] and it helps the person next to you and
[1:44:45] helps your neighbor and your your
[1:44:46] brother and your sister in these
[1:44:47] different things amen we see these
[1:44:49] shirts today that say only god can judge
[1:44:51] me has anybody seen those it's very
[1:44:53] popular today only god can judge me it's
[1:44:55] a meme on social media and these
[1:44:57] different things listen you don't want
[1:44:58] to be there
[1:45:00] judgment is takes you out of the ju the
[1:45:02] covenant of grace and it puts you right
[1:45:03] back under the law and guess what every
[1:45:05] single one died under the law except for
[1:45:08] that blood and guess what when you say
[1:45:09] only god can judge me you're saying i
[1:45:11] don't even want his blood you're saying
[1:45:12] i'm going to stand on my merits and i'm
[1:45:14] going to convince him that i'm right you
[1:45:16] can't convince god you're right there's
[1:45:17] only one right
[1:45:19] you can live your entire life right and
[1:45:20] you'll still be wrong because you're
[1:45:22] born and sin shaped in iniquity amen you
[1:45:24] cannot do it yourself amen
[1:45:26] but what is it grace will look at
[1:45:27] somebody and say what i've been down
[1:45:29] that road
[1:45:31] don't go down that road you know they
[1:45:32] have what do they call them gateway
[1:45:33] drugs
[1:45:35] you've heard of gateway drugs great
[1:45:36] gateway drugs are a minor drug that
[1:45:38] leads to a greater dependency and
[1:45:39] heavier drugs you know oftentimes what
[1:45:41] we do is we look at somebody and we say
[1:45:42] what you're doing is a gateway drug
[1:45:44] what you're doing is going to take you
[1:45:46] down a path and it's going to take you
[1:45:47] to here if you don't stop it up front
[1:45:49] you got to stop it now otherwise you're
[1:45:51] not going to help it because guess what
[1:45:52] once you're addicted to a drug there's
[1:45:53] no going back and so they have and i
[1:45:55] don't know anything about these drugs or
[1:45:56] whatever but they say there's gateway
[1:45:58] drugs that are cheaper and easier to get
[1:45:59] and what they do is they get you hooked
[1:46:01] and then you need more and more and more
[1:46:02] and it takes you to the heavier and
[1:46:03] harder stuff until you're completely
[1:46:04] destroyed in your body and in your mind
[1:46:06] and these different things
[1:46:07] grace tells us that's a gateway drug
[1:46:09] brother brother that's a gateway drug
[1:46:11] sister don't go there don't do that i've
[1:46:13] been there i've seen people go there you
[1:46:15] don't want to go down that path that's
[1:46:17] grace when we talk to our brothers and
[1:46:18] sisters like that amen
[1:46:20] what is it otherwise you're saying only
[1:46:22] god can judge me
[1:46:24] that's why we have a body we have a body
[1:46:26] to help that's why we have elders that's
[1:46:27] why you have experienced christians is
[1:46:28] to warn us about these things say you
[1:46:30] don't want to go there you don't want to
[1:46:32] go there because all that's there is
[1:46:33] it's heartache and failure and pain and
[1:46:35] suffering and these different things
[1:46:37] we talked about last time you can never
[1:46:39] lose your soul if you're a child of god
[1:46:40] but you can lose your reward and you'll
[1:46:42] see people do that and they get caught
[1:46:43] up in something and they go all the way
[1:46:44] down they destroy their christian
[1:46:46] reputation and they'll just end up half
[1:46:48] the time nothing
[1:46:49] they end up walking away and god has to
[1:46:50] take them it's a dangerous place to be
[1:46:54] brother says we're walking in the light
[1:46:55] as he is in the light
[1:46:57] see we're moving up the king's highway
[1:46:59] and the farther it comes more grace is
[1:47:02] given praise the lord more power is
[1:47:04] given and more supernatural is given and
[1:47:07] there we are this is the hour where the
[1:47:09] holy spirit has come down in the form of
[1:47:11] a light like he was at the beginning a
[1:47:12] pillar of fire and has manifested
[1:47:14] himself doing the very same things he
[1:47:16] did when he was on earth brother abraham
[1:47:19] says the further you go with god the
[1:47:20] more grace you're going to need
[1:47:22] not only the more grace you're going to
[1:47:23] need the more grace you're going to get
[1:47:25] amen amen praise the lord he didn't just
[1:47:26] say you need it he says there's going to
[1:47:28] be more and with more grace will come
[1:47:29] more power and with that will come more
[1:47:31] supernatural but he says you're going to
[1:47:32] need more grace to move on with god
[1:47:34] so the thing is this if you're further
[1:47:36] with god you ought to be more gracious
[1:47:38] if you've received more than you're
[1:47:39] going to be giving more if you're closer
[1:47:41] to god and you're moving further with
[1:47:43] god and you're getting less gracious
[1:47:44] then guess what chances are you're on
[1:47:45] the wrong path you're not walking as
[1:47:47] closely with god as you think it is
[1:47:48] brother brown says the further you go
[1:47:50] the more grace is given and the more
[1:47:52] you're given the more you'll give
[1:47:54] amen i want to be in that place
[1:47:56] i want to be in that place where more
[1:47:57] grace is given where the natural
[1:47:59] response is grace amen the bride's the
[1:48:02] bride's ministry is mercy because while
[1:48:04] we're here there's mercy there's blood
[1:48:06] on the mercy seat as long as we're here
[1:48:08] but once we go it's gone we take mercy
[1:48:10] with us so we want to be mercy we want
[1:48:12] to be grace we want to be the one
[1:48:14] that'll take the hit for the sake of the
[1:48:15] other person's soul
[1:48:17] amen
[1:48:18] the scripture says if he gives more
[1:48:20] grace what says what he giveth more
[1:48:21] grace we read it last time amen if he
[1:48:23] gives more grace then what ought we to
[1:48:25] do we ought to give more grace the
[1:48:26] further we go the closer we get to the
[1:48:28] rapture the more gracious we ought to be
[1:48:30] as a people amen our attitude ought to
[1:48:32] be more gracious that's for sure amen or
[1:48:34] do we what just sit there we cross our
[1:48:35] arms and we say not me
[1:48:37] not me
[1:48:38] no we ought to be the first one to say
[1:48:40] my brother my sister my friend my
[1:48:42] neighbor
[1:48:43] i'll love you i'll show you the grace
[1:48:45] you need to get you through this amen
[1:48:50] what did the king do to esther
[1:48:52] remember the king he decided all
[1:48:55] if he reached out the scepter it was
[1:48:56] grace and if he didn't reach it it was
[1:48:58] automatic death
[1:49:00] and the king himself only decided who
[1:49:02] that was whether he would reach it out
[1:49:04] and esther went in he was happy to see
[1:49:06] her
[1:49:06] but guess what christ didn't just reach
[1:49:08] out to the ones he was happy to see the
[1:49:10] ones that came in with the right
[1:49:11] attitude and the right spirit the ones
[1:49:13] that came in with the the right approach
[1:49:14] and that looked right and dressed right
[1:49:16] and said the right words listen he gave
[1:49:18] grace to all he offered grace to all
[1:49:20] amen the closer we get that's the kind
[1:49:22] of grace we ought to do is regardless of
[1:49:23] how they come it ought to be grace grace
[1:49:26] grace grace
[1:49:29] romans 5 says for as by one man's
[1:49:31] disobedient many were made sinners so by
[1:49:33] the obedience of one shall many be made
[1:49:35] righteous moreover the law entered that
[1:49:38] the offenses might abound but where sin
[1:49:41] abounded where sin overflowed
[1:49:44] grace did much more abound
[1:49:47] grace did much more overflow remember we
[1:49:49] said that what fervent love covers a
[1:49:51] multitude of sins right what is it it
[1:49:54] extends mercy grace unmerited favor
[1:49:57] beyond the issue and it covers it all
[1:50:00] amen it looks past the fault to the need
[1:50:02] as the song says
[1:50:03] he says that as sin reigneth reigned
[1:50:05] unto death even so grace
[1:50:08] even so my grace reign through
[1:50:10] righteousness unto eternal life by jesus
[1:50:12] christ our lord that grace of his takes
[1:50:14] us all the way to eternal life to the
[1:50:16] experience of it we have it in our souls
[1:50:18] by the holy spirit but it takes us all
[1:50:19] the way to the reality of it beyond this
[1:50:21] curtain of time brother brahms says
[1:50:23] annette and we pray father that as the
[1:50:25] poet said the forlorn and the
[1:50:27] shipwrecked brother seeing our
[1:50:28] steadiness on keel seeing it shall take
[1:50:31] heart again or take courage again and
[1:50:34] try again and know that the
[1:50:36] all-sufficient god if we stumble or fall
[1:50:39] his great hand is there to help us his
[1:50:42] grace is
[1:50:43] sufficient amen that's his attitude to
[1:50:45] us
[1:50:47] if he stumble if we stumble or fall
[1:50:49] he'll pick us up every single time every
[1:50:52] single time
[1:50:53] what will we do to each other will we
[1:50:55] pick each other up every single time
[1:50:57] will we left up somebody that's been
[1:50:58] stepped on or will we just say had that
[1:51:00] coming saw that one coming a mile away
[1:51:03] knew it was coming told him didn't
[1:51:04] listen told her she didn't listen now
[1:51:06] she's there
[1:51:07] no no no that's not where we want to be
[1:51:09] amen
[1:51:10] sir is them right tried to help they
[1:51:12] didn't listen that's a self-righteous
[1:51:14] attitude and we need to repent of it
[1:51:16] and then sometimes our grace runs out
[1:51:17] when we've tried to help and the person
[1:51:19] hasn't listened
[1:51:20] and then they're in the mess
[1:51:22] grace looks beyond the fault
[1:51:24] grace looks beyond the the refused
[1:51:26] message
[1:51:27] beyond the refused advice and says i'll
[1:51:29] help you up regardless and it never says
[1:51:31] i told you so
[1:51:33] never says i told you so amen
[1:51:36] grace keeps you in his presence
[1:51:39] grace ought to restore them to his
[1:51:40] presence as well amen
[1:51:42] and then i want to close with just a
[1:51:43] couple of quotes here and one of them's
[1:51:45] very familiar and it's where brother
[1:51:46] batman's giving his testimony beyond the
[1:51:48] curtain of time and and brother branham
[1:51:49] was changed after he did that
[1:51:51] that was that was back in 1961 sometime
[1:51:54] i think and that changed brother branham
[1:51:56] he just he knew he says you know he
[1:51:58] talked about he says whatever you do
[1:51:59] don't miss it whatever you do don't miss
[1:52:01] he says it's beyond anything you could
[1:52:03] ever imagine it's beyond anything you
[1:52:04] ever think anything you've ever dreamed
[1:52:06] he says what's waiting for us over there
[1:52:08] is greater than anything we could ever
[1:52:09] imagine but i want you to catch this
[1:52:11] because he says after this
[1:52:14] hope my first wife hugged me and said my
[1:52:17] precious brother
[1:52:19] then another young woman hugged me and
[1:52:21] hope turned and hugged the young woman
[1:52:22] and i said i don't understand this this
[1:52:24] is something entirely different from our
[1:52:26] human love
[1:52:28] i don't want to go back to that old body
[1:52:30] on the bed
[1:52:31] then a voice spoke to me
[1:52:33] this is what you preached that the holy
[1:52:36] ghost is
[1:52:37] this is perfect love
[1:52:39] nothing can enter here without it now
[1:52:44] that's one of the deepest things i've
[1:52:45] ever read but guess what i didn't
[1:52:47] realize it until yesterday
[1:52:49] because i've been listening to questions
[1:52:50] and answers
[1:52:52] and at the end of it listen god is
[1:52:53] perfect in his timing
[1:52:55] listen i can study till my eyeballs fall
[1:52:57] out and there'll still be a question
[1:52:58] there or there'll be something lingering
[1:52:59] and he'll come in and out of the middle
[1:53:01] of nowhere he'll drop something in and
[1:53:02] like boom there you go and it's the key
[1:53:04] that unlocks the sermon it's the thing
[1:53:05] that finishes it it's the one that gives
[1:53:07] you the rest that you need about it
[1:53:09] okay so we're talking about this is what
[1:53:11] the holy ghost is this is perfect love
[1:53:13] nothing can enter here without it
[1:53:15] they sent a question they said paul said
[1:53:17] to covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:53:20] and yet show iu a more excellent way
[1:53:23] please explain what the more excellent
[1:53:25] way is
[1:53:26] brother braham says
[1:53:28] love
[1:53:29] first corinthians see
[1:53:31] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:53:34] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:53:37] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:53:39] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:53:41] child but when i became a man i put away
[1:53:44] childish things for now we see through a
[1:53:46] glass darkly but then face to face now i
[1:53:49] know in part but then shall i know even
[1:53:51] as i also as also i am known and now
[1:53:54] abideth faith hope and charity these
[1:53:56] three but the greatest of these is
[1:53:59] charity now you start to tie that
[1:54:01] together where he says this is what you
[1:54:02] preach the holy ghost is this is perfect
[1:54:04] love nothing can enter here without it
[1:54:06] and what's he saying he's saying he went
[1:54:07] beyond the curtain of time and he saw
[1:54:09] people that weren't identified by their
[1:54:10] natural relationships they weren't
[1:54:12] identified by their country of origin
[1:54:14] they weren't identified by their social
[1:54:15] status by the color of their skin by the
[1:54:17] amount of money that was in their bank
[1:54:18] account they weren't identified by the
[1:54:20] ministry they were under they weren't
[1:54:21] identified by the size of the church
[1:54:22] they were in they weren't identified by
[1:54:24] the gifts that they had
[1:54:27] none of that was present when he went
[1:54:28] over there
[1:54:30] those are childish things
[1:54:32] those are things we look to in this
[1:54:33] flesh but that is not the perfection
[1:54:35] we're seeking amen and those are things
[1:54:37] that we fixate on and we we and paul
[1:54:39] said you're seeking the gifts
[1:54:41] but he says that's not where you want to
[1:54:42] go you want to go beyond the gifts
[1:54:44] because there's a more perfect way
[1:54:46] there's a more excellent way for this
[1:54:48] and he says what is it it's love
[1:54:51] love is the more excellent way
[1:54:53] but on the other side he says you'll see
[1:54:54] what love is because the other side is
[1:54:56] grace personified when love projects
[1:54:59] grace produces the object of that love
[1:55:02] right the other side
[1:55:04] is the object
[1:55:06] of what love was going to seek
[1:55:08] that's what he's talking about here
[1:55:09] hebrews 11 says and these all having
[1:55:11] obtained a good report through faith
[1:55:14] remember faith hope charity they had
[1:55:16] hope and faith he says having obtained a
[1:55:18] good report through faith receive not
[1:55:20] the promise
[1:55:22] why because they went to a waiting area
[1:55:25] they didn't receive it
[1:55:27] they went to a waiting area and then
[1:55:28] christ goes and he takes them out of
[1:55:29] prison and he takes them up into a place
[1:55:31] where they could what rest
[1:55:34] but that's not it
[1:55:35] they didn't have it
[1:55:37] he says god having provided some better
[1:55:40] thing for us
[1:55:42] a more excellent way
[1:55:44] that they without us should not be made
[1:55:46] perfect so remember divine love has an
[1:55:48] objective and grace goes out to achieve
[1:55:50] that effective what was brother branham
[1:55:51] seeing on the other side then the
[1:55:53] objectives
[1:55:54] the objects of the love of god amen
[1:55:57] god's love went out and grace abounded
[1:55:59] and it went through the ministry of a
[1:56:00] prophet and it went through the ministry
[1:56:01] of of all these men and women throughout
[1:56:03] throughout the ages and brother branham
[1:56:05] was up there and perhaps he thought it
[1:56:06] was about him perhaps he thought it was
[1:56:08] about his lineage because he's seen hope
[1:56:09] and he's seen sharon rose and all these
[1:56:11] different things right but over there
[1:56:13] they weren't his loved ones
[1:56:15] they were just loved ones
[1:56:17] they weren't his there was no
[1:56:18] relationship there when they hugged him
[1:56:20] he didn't feel a stirring of any sort he
[1:56:22] didn't his hormones didn't kick in this
[1:56:24] wasn't a love like he had for hope when
[1:56:26] she was down here amen that relationship
[1:56:28] with brother branham is not what got
[1:56:30] them there
[1:56:32] what brought them there was way beyond
[1:56:33] brother branham amen maybe brother
[1:56:35] branham thought that he brought them
[1:56:36] there and certainly god used him to do
[1:56:38] these different things but what was it
[1:56:40] god projected grace through love through
[1:56:43] grace and what did it do it helped them
[1:56:45] come to their real family
[1:56:48] because over there it's it's not
[1:56:51] collins and curletts and coffees and
[1:56:54] katukas and colombos and lushes and
[1:56:57] sharps that doesn't exist over there you
[1:56:59] know what exists over there my precious
[1:57:01] brother
[1:57:02] my precious sister my precious brother
[1:57:05] my precious sister he's going over there
[1:57:06] and he's saying this
[1:57:08] and the voice says this is what the holy
[1:57:09] ghost is my precious brother my precious
[1:57:12] sister now it's what by one spirit we're
[1:57:15] baptized into one body and there's the
[1:57:17] body
[1:57:18] there's the body that's what we're going
[1:57:19] for all this for is not to to just do
[1:57:22] signs and wonders here to make people
[1:57:23] look at us but it's to be one in that
[1:57:25] body over there the holy ghost is the
[1:57:28] object personified over there now you're
[1:57:30] in the body of christ now it's not about
[1:57:32] who you're married to now it's not about
[1:57:34] what ministry you're under or what you
[1:57:36] do here it's that you're back in one
[1:57:37] together again this is what the holy
[1:57:40] ghost is is each and every one of us
[1:57:41] with all the humanity stripped away all
[1:57:43] the carnality stripped away and all
[1:57:45] you're left with is the object of his
[1:57:47] perfect love grace personified on the
[1:57:49] other side amen this was a love
[1:57:51] connection that passed anything he'd
[1:57:53] ever experienced here even that with the
[1:57:55] ball and this and that and the other
[1:57:56] thing because it took us out of these
[1:57:57] the the this horrible flesh that we're
[1:58:00] in and it took us into a perfect place
[1:58:01] where it couldn't hold us back amen
[1:58:04] love has that purpose and grace achieved
[1:58:06] that purpose and he got to go see it
[1:58:07] that was the holy ghost personified
[1:58:09] right there was christ in us together in
[1:58:12] a body in a way that we couldn't
[1:58:13] what is it god gives me the holy ghost
[1:58:16] gives you the holy ghost to take us all
[1:58:17] the way to the other side where we can
[1:58:19] finally recognize who and what we really
[1:58:21] are and how we fit into this body amen
[1:58:24] what it takes us out of our worldly
[1:58:25] affiliations it takes us out of our
[1:58:27] carnality takes us out of our way of
[1:58:28] thinking and it brings us to a place
[1:58:30] where we only have the mind and the
[1:58:32] relationship of christ amen over there
[1:58:34] blanca corletta is no more the wife of
[1:58:36] jonathan curlette
[1:58:37] she's my precious sister
[1:58:39] and she's my precious sister to brother
[1:58:40] mark as much as she is to me i have no
[1:58:43] hold on her i have no claim on her
[1:58:45] why because now we're refined now we're
[1:58:46] in the perfect object of the grace that
[1:58:49] comes by love amen
[1:58:51] amen that's what we're fighting for
[1:58:52] today
[1:58:54] is to get past being a coffee to get
[1:58:56] past being a curlette to get past being
[1:58:58] a colombo to get past being a sharp a
[1:59:00] collins a lush
[1:59:02] to get past that and say i'll give you
[1:59:04] grace because i believe that in the end
[1:59:06] we're all one and the same and we're
[1:59:08] going to be over there and we're going
[1:59:09] to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder
[1:59:10] and sing amazing grace
[1:59:13] that's what we're looking for
[1:59:15] why wait over there to sing amazing
[1:59:16] grace with your brothers and sisters
[1:59:19] why wait over there to say amazing grace
[1:59:21] or show amazing grace to our neighbors
[1:59:22] and to those we run into at work and
[1:59:24] these different things amen
[1:59:26] we want to we want to say well i'll
[1:59:28] blame it on the body listen let's not
[1:59:30] use that as an excuse
[1:59:32] brother
[1:59:33] you know paul said i'd die daily
[1:59:35] i'd rather confess i'm dying daily than
[1:59:37] the body's winning
[1:59:39] let that be our confession amen that the
[1:59:41] grace is winning that the love is
[1:59:43] winning and it's not just winning where
[1:59:44] for me it's winning in other people's
[1:59:46] lives as well
[1:59:48] as we close and the musicians come i
[1:59:49] want to read a prayer that brother
[1:59:51] branham is doing and this is in
[1:59:53] questions and answers a different one he
[1:59:54] says i'm only going by the way your word
[1:59:57] said to the best of my knowledge
[1:59:59] and by the witness of the holy spirit
[2:00:01] that lives in my heart to me it's
[2:00:03] perfect and i pray god that it will
[2:00:05] become perfect to this church that this
[2:00:08] church may become perfected in the love
[2:00:10] of christ that this will be a place
[2:00:12] where people will come from around the
[2:00:13] world to come in here and see the
[2:00:16] glorious operation and harmony of the
[2:00:18] spirit for gifts and manifestations till
[2:00:20] when sinners walk in the building the
[2:00:22] holy spirit will be so dominating in
[2:00:25] here till they'll weep and walk up to
[2:00:27] the altar and give their lives to thee
[2:00:31] amen let's stand together if we would
[2:00:34] is that your desire
[2:00:36] that when people listen they don't have
[2:00:38] to come into church
[2:00:40] they just need to be around you
[2:00:43] and not dismissive and not looking down
[2:00:45] your nose
[2:00:46] but your love is there and your grace is
[2:00:48] there and all you're wanting to do is
[2:00:50] show christ
[2:00:51] amen all you're trying to do is get them
[2:00:52] to see him and you right that's all
[2:00:54] you're looking to do and so the judgment
[2:00:56] falls away then the judgment falls away
[2:00:58] whether they're living in sin whether
[2:01:00] the you know alternative lifestyles or
[2:01:02] all the craziness that goes on wrapped
[2:01:03] up in hollywood and that so where they
[2:01:05] talk you talk to them and they're not
[2:01:07] they're not judged because of your
[2:01:08] attitude
[2:01:09] their conscience is pricked because of
[2:01:11] your attitude and then you're not
[2:01:12] putting them down you're not turning
[2:01:14] them into a second-class citizen you're
[2:01:15] not turning them into cannon fodder but
[2:01:17] you're drawing them into what the
[2:01:18] overflow of the grace and love that's in
[2:01:20] your life
[2:01:21] and we ought to be able to do that with
[2:01:22] our blo our brothers and sisters in here
[2:01:24] but it ought to be beyond that amen you
[2:01:26] ought to be able to take the slap in the
[2:01:28] face from time to time and say that's
[2:01:30] not i'm not going to respond the way you
[2:01:31] want me to and that'll get them more
[2:01:33] often than anything you might say or say
[2:01:35] or do say is is when you can respond in
[2:01:37] a way that they're not expecting and you
[2:01:39] look past what they're doing and you're
[2:01:40] looking to the heart and soul them and
[2:01:41] saying what christ died for them
[2:01:43] listen he knows his own we don't know
[2:01:45] his own do we
[2:01:46] we don't know so we got to give it to
[2:01:47] everyone we don't get to pick and choose
[2:01:49] we don't get to say you don't go to our
[2:01:51] ministry you don't go to our church you
[2:01:52] don't no no no we've got to offer it to
[2:01:54] all because we never know it could be
[2:01:56] the the saul that's persecuting us
[2:01:58] that's coming in
[2:01:59] or it could be our own children you know
[2:02:00] we just don't know what it's going to be
[2:02:02] but amen we want him to be able to say
[2:02:04] that's a real christian
[2:02:05] and i want the christ that he has
[2:02:07] right i want what he has i see something
[2:02:09] there i don't see in everybody else and
[2:02:11] that's what i want amen not perfect but
[2:02:14] there's a grace and there's a love there
[2:02:16] that's calling to me and says
[2:02:17] you need to come and get what he's got
[2:02:19] you need to come and get what she's got
[2:02:20] amen let's just bow our heads together
[2:02:25] lord god we are so thankful for your
[2:02:27] grace tonight amen
[2:02:29] lord that we can look back over our
[2:02:31] lives and we can see the many things

[2:02:35] our faults and failures lord our petty
[2:02:37] attitudes our little isms
[2:02:40] lord are huffing and puffing at times
[2:02:41] lord our our fear our disgust
[2:02:44] lord our shame whatever it might be lord
[2:02:46] you look beyond that you always look to
[2:02:48] the need lord and your grace always
[2:02:50] allows us a path to restore us into
[2:02:52] fellowship again and lord we want to be
[2:02:54] able to do that with each other lord
[2:02:55] that if there's any schism lord if
[2:02:57] there's any hindrance in the body if
[2:02:59] there's any breaks lord lord we want
[2:03:01] your grace to overflow out of us lord
[2:03:03] that it would cast out all fear
[2:03:05] lord that we would wrap ourselves in
[2:03:06] love as the prophet said lord so that it
[2:03:09] would let that other person actually
[2:03:10] come around to us again amen lord we ask
[2:03:12] your great sword that we will be
[2:03:14] ministers of that grace lord each and
[2:03:15] every one lord that in our witness and
[2:03:17] testimony of our everyday life lord that
[2:03:20] people would see a christ that would
[2:03:21] draw them to him
[2:03:23] lord we ask your grace to go out with us
[2:03:24] now we pray lord bless this fellowship
