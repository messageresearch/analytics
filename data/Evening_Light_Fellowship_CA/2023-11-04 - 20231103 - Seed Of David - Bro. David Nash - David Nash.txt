don't we sing I want to sing I will sing 1251 and I'm going to turn over to Brother John as he introduces Brother David amen so God uh God bless brother David as you bring the word today brother God bless you amen let's sing it I know I am the bride that you're returning for I know I am the bride that you're returning for dressed in garments white and wrinkle free though I have no earthly love that I am holding to for you're the one who means everything to me and I will sing hallelujah amen I will bow myself down humbly at your thr I will give anything I will give everything to you alone you are the faithful God who keeps your Covenant there's not one thing you said you have not done and someday when I see you standing face to face Hallelujah Hall praise the Lord hallelujah I will sing I Will Worship You I Will bow myself down humbly at your [Music] throne I will give anything Hallelujah I will give everything to you alone you are the faithful God who keeps your Covenant there's not one thing you said you have not done amen and someday when I see you [Music] bless God blessen praise the Lord let's Stand Together oh I will sing I Will Worship You I Will bow myself down humbly at your [Music] throne I will give anything I will give everything to you alone and I will sing I will worship you I will bow myself down humbly at your [Music] throne I will give anything I will give everything to you alone amen God bless you each one that's gathered here on a Friday night and many missing not feeling well but trusting the Lord to be with them but we're here amen and we're trusting that the spirit of God can speak that the Holy Spirit can come down into our lives each one and we brought Brother David Nash all the way up from Louisiana and Texas and by way of South America and all these other places he's been so he's a missionary he's been doing that for well over 20 years preaching for much longer than that and we've supported Brother David in some of his trips and some of his missions and so he's here to just greet the people and kind of put a a face to a name but he's here to preach the word amen he's a missionary he's part of the fivefold ministry and so we want to have everything that God would have for us this weekend and I'm not going to share any stories about Brother David because I want to see what he's going to have to say tonight and over the next few days but I'll tell you this is a this is not a a novice preacher this is a man that by the grace of God has emptied out hospitals has they've seen tremendous signs and wonders in the ministry that he's brought just like the apostles in the book of Acts amen that's the way the fivefold ministry is supposed to be is a book of Acts Ministry and so I've seen that in brother David's life I've seen the humility the Simplicity with which he lives his life and his family and what God's done in their lives so we're we're in good hands tonight amen we've got a servant of God that's come here to to preach the word so Brother David as I said in the office you take your Liberty you can't preach long enough to Tire us out and you you can probably preach short enough to to disappoint us perhaps but uh you take your time and and we want him we just want the Lord to have his way amen and you know he we got in we got to bed about 3:00 last night and we woke up late and had a late breakfast and he's been down in his room most of the day so again he knows nothing about this church he knows nothing about the people and that's the way we like it amen cuz whatever comes over the pulpit then it's the Sovereign goodness and grace of God to speak it so let's just pull on the gift let's trust that he's going to speak to us that God's going to speak to us in amen it's not a man it's not a Ministry but it's the everpresent Jesus Christ in our midst he said where two or three are gathered in my name there will I be in the midst and so let's believe that let's trust that this evening let's sing that song If we would more of you that's that's the one I love for these types of things more of you we just said we'll give anything we'll give everything but it's not just the giving away now we've got to receive we've got to have something to fill that Gap that empty room that we open up for him so let's just sing this as Brother David would come and let's just pull and pull pull and Pull and feed and feed and feed till we can't hold anymore amen let's sing it more of you more of you well I've had it all but what I need is more of you of things I've had my fa but yet I hunger still oh empty and be Lord hear my prayer for more of you oh more of [Music] you is more of you than I've had my f but yet I H still empty and be Lord hear my prayer for more of you more of you as a prayer oh more of you I've had it all but what I need is more of you of things I've had my f yet I hunger still empty and bear Lord hear my prayer for more of you gracious heavenly father to stand here tonight is beyond honor or privilege Lord it is simply the grace of God your grace poured out upon us through our precious Lord Jesus Christ God how you paid the the price Lord and yet it goes even beyond that because now it's the continuation of the life that you gave that resurrected life is now being re resurrected tonight in every heart and life God that's a my prayer tonight resurrect Jesus Christ again that this dying sinful world might see Christ just one more time just once more in the lives of these Believers Lord we think we've come a long way but it's truly it's the grace of God It's Your Grace it's your mercy so fill us tonight Lord more of you oh God just more of you I thank you and I praise you for being here I thank you Lord that they'd give us the offer to come and to stand Lord in your place in this Pulpit tonight so God take this man take every part of me anything Lord that's wrongful or sinful or whatever Lord cuz we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity take all those things away and look at us through the blood of Jesus Christ tonight perfectly totally sinless as you have declared in the name of our Lord Lord Jesus Christ of you thank you sister praise the Lord uh I uh that particular song I there's brother usabo was the brother in Nicaragua used to take us around a lot and that was his favorite song the Lord took him home a little over a year ago and uh I miss him he uh he I spent a lot of time in Nicaragua I used to go there a couple times a year for 3 four weeks at a time and he uh would always take me around and he said and he told me one time before I left he said I wish you'd just come and stay for two or three months I said why is that you Sabio and he said well there's a lot of other churches I'd like to take you to and I'm thinking well maybe you know I don't know maybe we'd already been to about 50 I think and so I thought well maybe there's you know 25 30 more I said well how many and he he said about 200 and I thought wow well we never got to do it but I believe he's probably here tonight we have that scripture to that we can hang on to it says we're encompassed about by so great a cloud of witnesses and don't ever think that just because you look small you could be right here in a grandstand tonight with thousands times thousands listening to the word of God so you thank the Lord for those things and I I don't like to keep you st it so let's turn to Second Timothy the 3rd Chapter and uh greetings from My Wife and from our little home Church there in Kenwick Washington they uh I'd like to think they're a well-taught church they they put up with me for about 10 or 11 years now and they I keep saying well maybe I should you know and they go no you're not going anywhere you're the pastor here as long as you're here and uh we have a really good assistant pastor brother Jose uh Hernandez and uh he's taking care of the flock while we're away so do remember them in prayer we were mentioning in the car and I said well the Apostle Paul had 12 in Ephesus and they said it was a uh a mature church and I said we got 15 so at least we're in the same boat so greetings from them tonight and also from my wife who probably home listening to the message tonight so in second Timothy uh this third chapter and brother Jonathan was uh asking me you know about preaching he likes to ask different preachers how they they do things and I say well I I don't read a lot of quotes but uh because there's so many and you can make quotes say just about anything you want to as we've discovered in this message but uh I tend to preach on Concepts and so uh again tonight that's kind of what we'll be looking at and in second Timothy the third chapter we'll start there I think it's with the I guess they put six or 15 okay 15th verse says and that from a child that H has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ all scripture is given uh by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works gracious Heavenly Father we've read your scripture this evening may you add your blessing to the word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen please be seated and as we think about this he says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God well we believe that in the word or in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the concept I guess tonight if we would begin to look at this I've seen Brothers at times you know in different churches different places I I believe that we've speak spoken now in 30 maybe 31 countries I kind of lost track recently and uh all different you would be amazed if you saw some of the things or eating some of the foods as we talked about that we've eaten along the way but uh and I've seen Brothers sometimes almost get in fights over the word of God and as I'll sit there and listen and pray and I I say you know they're actually using the same quote same script scripture whatever it might be and they're fighting because they're looking at it from different angles or different uh Concepts I I guess in the sense that uh one brother he believes it's only this way and it can't be any other way and this brother he's convinced that way but if we take it for what it says every scripture uh is given by inspiration from God and it's profitable for and then he lists four different things that it's profitable for it's profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so you begin to realize right away that each scripture has more than one application every single scripture has more than one application and if we really believe that this scripture is Jesus Christ that this word is Christ then it becomes apparent very quickly because as a human being if this is Christ in word form then a as Christ being the person of Jesus Christ We're All Made In His Image and we you're looking at an outside flesh that you know it's got its problems I've been nursing a wrist and all the different things that we go through we were talking this morning with the brothers about you know every day you get up you got a new pain that you didn't know was there and and all those kind of things and and and that's that outside flesh but inside that flesh there's a spirit that makes this flesh what it is and makes it act and do the things that it does and if you take that Spirit out then all you got it's a little pile of dust and you know I guess now with inflation it's probably worth you know maybe eight or 10 bucks Canadian I don't know exactly so it's not worth a whole lot if you take the spirit out of it and beyond that that Spirit then that makes this thing alive beyond that and there's things that we could say about this outside flesh well he's not very goodl looking his Beard's too long whatever it might be but beyond that then there's a spirit that brings us and causes us to live a certain life and then beyond that there is the soul realm if you think about Hebrews I think it's the 4th chapter about verse 12 where it says the word of God is sharp and quicker you know like a two-edged sword and it cuts to the Bone and the mar and the and the spirit and the Soul well that Soul that's why we have to be born again because of the fall this Soul came with a a death type nature and so when we get born again and when we receive Jesus Christ that power of the Resurrection comes into this body and it changes brother brandom said the soul is the nature of the spirit so there we begin to look at this and if this scripture represents Jesus Christ every scripture has more than one way we can look at it it has a a fleshly application Doctrine it has a fleshly application instruction unto righteousness it has a fleshly applicate you I mean it has these different applications and each one can lead us into an entirely open room a different room a different direction or a different consideration to how does this apply to me in the last couple of years I've looked at it and we' again we've been to a lot of places heard a lot of other Ministries and stuff and as I go and I see and I look at congregations and as we we were speaking a little bit earlier today about how some of them they're kind of dying they're just going away and you go to another church somewhere and it's like what in the world are they talking about and some of them that call call themselves messagers you know I'm going well they must have heard different tapes than I heard but and it's because that as we look at it if we're only looking at a single singular application we're going to miss the real nature behind it there's a place where brother Bram said uh that he go I don't think we're getting people through to Christ and yet they're preaching more word than has ever been on the planet since the days of all and we're not getting them through to Christ and and I when I look at it I think well it's not it's not just this outside book and it's not just church order as in you know you come in and you sit a certain way and you sing a certain number of songs and no there's a life or there should be a soul or a nature behind that that as we hear the preaching of the word and we hear the song is a wonderful song service tonight God bless you brother it's nice to hear a Holy Ghost Song service we've heard a few that I not a whole lot yeah like uh oh the brother down south said yeah Holy Ghost I'm not sure they had Casper the Friendly Ghost but uh well that's true and I I've been in a few of those but uh there is a life and a nature behind the word of God and if we're not getting through getting people through to Christ it's not that we're not getting them to this written word or even a word that moves maybe into their spirit that causes them to like for the women not to cut their hair or Not to Wear certain things or guys not to you know cheat and kill people or you know whatever it is they're if you get them just that far that's not enough because the the nature behind the word changes lives it it is the nature of Jesus Christ and the power of God should be behind it because God never changed his power as we look at uh I hate to get into that concept this early but uh God is a Creator if you go to the very first of the book it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth that tells us immediately something about the nature or the soul of God it's in God to be a Creator that's in him that's his heart that's his soul that's his desire that's who he is and so if we realize that that power it's never left this Earth it's never left this word so that the pro problem is it's not with God it's we're not getting through to the nature of God that's in this word to where that nature C takes control of us and we allow Jesus Christ to express himself through his creation that he has put into us by the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ it's the nature of God that he wants to express himself expressing through his bride you and I through the means of his word and his Spirit of the Holy Ghost that he gave to us we think of the the example where it said that uh when Mary the angel came to Mary and he tells her you know you're going to have this son and so forth and she asked a very valid question she saidwell uh how can these things be because all she ever knew all that had ever been taught all that she'd ever seen the only way you could have a child was woman and man come together that's just how it happens and she said she asked that how can it be that I can have this son and he said well the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and bring forth and he continues to give her revelation of what that son will be and you think about how the Holy Ghost overshadowed a woman and that word went into her W womb and she said the right thing she said be it unto me according to your word and that word came into her womb and created Jesus Christ it was the creative power of God by the word in that case of an angel that went into her womb that created Jesus Christ you think the Holy Ghost is going to create something different in you or I hello if the Holy Ghost created Christ The First Time In the Womb of a woman what it'll do in the womb of your heart now we won't all be wearing robes we won't have the same kind of hair as Jesus had and and so forth but it will create the nature of God in The Bride of Jesus Christ because it's the same Holy Ghost only now that body if I can use that term has moved from the natural physical body of Jesus Christ into a natural physical body we call the Bride of Jesus Christ that's pretty powerful and it's a concept when you know we've done a lot of Youth Camps along the way and I have uh Young people that'll come up come up and even old people too sometimes Oh Brother David I just don't know if I can make it I said well have you received Christ well yeah I said if you got the Holy Ghost well I I I think so well then what do you fearing because if the word of God in the womb of a woman created Christ what's it going to do in the womb of your heart it's going to create Jesus Christ what a concept it can't and if you go back to the simplest form every seed brings forth of its own kind if uh I saw the sister had a little garden out back and I don't I don't know if she planted corn or not but if she did if she planted corn I'm sure that especially in the climate up here she's not going to get pineapples it's just not going to happen and so if you plant a Christ in your heart what are you expecting to grow only Christ will grow now you might pour some concrete over it but like uh even when they pour you know a sidewalk or something you find out the thickest grass comes up around the edges because that seed that was buried under that concrete is growing to wherever it can find light and so we can make it a tougher struggle with some of the things we do but it's still going to produce Jesus Christ I think of Samson and you know he uh H there's some tremendous things we could look at about Samson but you know he did some things that kind of messed looks like in at least in in my mind he messed a few things up but when he got down to the end he accomplished the task that God sent him into the Earth to do said he killed more in his death than he did in his life life so even in his failure he did a better job because that's how God works so with that in mind let's go to Romans the first chapter and we'll just look at we'll follow this concept through the scripture about whatever God said he's going to bring it to pass he's going to create the circumstance to bring it to pass and in uh Romans first chapter Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God which he had promised a By His prophets in the Holy scriptures concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the Flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of Holiness by the resurrection from the dead again Lord I ask just bring your blessing upon the word in Jesus name amen so as we consider what he's saying here he's saying that God prophesied these things he promised through His prophets and through the holy scriptures concerning his son Jesus Christ that he would be made after the seed of David according to the flesh now we know that David's flesh actually as far as natural bloodline only goes so far it comes up to Joseph because that was following that bloodline of of the tribe of Judah and he gets to Joseph and Joseph has nothing to do with the body of Jesus Christ so what's he talking about when he says that after the flesh after the flesh according to the flesh Jesus Christ came out of the seed of David so what is this seed of David that he's talking about says that he was made of the seed of David well we know that we just mentioned it that God is a Creator and that whatever he speaks as to be creation it comes forth as whatever God thought it should be I don't I don't see a light switch in here tonight but I'd like to tell people that when God said let there be light and the Bible said and there was that creation never stopped it didn't just bang here's light and that's it no the light that's in here tonight is not the same light when you were here last Sunday evening it's continuing even the light that's happening right now is not the same light that it was here when you walked in the door because the light is continuing to be created once God spoke it it's continuing it's going out it's going out it's going out out the same Sun that went down tonight will come back tomorrow but it'll be different light it will be new light created Every Morning by the word of God it's still creating light because that's what God Said and it will create light throughout eternity unless he says stop it'll never stop it will continue by the creative P the creative power of God by his word so as we look at this and and we we see this what's he talking about after the seed of David let's so let's go back and look just a little bit about the seed of David and where it kind of starts in the picture is the 1st Samuel chapter 16 and I know you're familiar with these things and I I love this first scripture and and we know that God has been dealing with Saul and and and Saul just he just didn't have it he was the People's Choice and he was essentially a good King but he had some real Kings he just had some real problems and there came a place where God said you know s Saul I'm done I'm done messing with you you weren't my choice in the first place so I'm going to make a choice so picking it up there as the has it up there and the Lord said unto Samuel how long wil thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel he says fill thine horn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethleem might and watch these words I have provided me a king among his sons who's going to be showing himself in David God God is going to be the king that lives in David David is only going to be the fleshly reaction or the fleshly manifestation of what God is going to prove himself to be as a king God is going to prove himself what he is going to be in David so he is going to provide himself in David and uh and where he even T tells him to go he tells him to go to Jesse and as you I love the the Hebrew language especially because in Hebrew each every letter has a number that's associated with it and they also have a particular meaning that goes with each letter often times and how that uh when you start to read you know from I I like to use the Hebrew dictionary a lot uh not because I I want to be you know a big uh you know a special teacher or something but because when I look at the dictionary then you see a word and it's got four letters in it and you find out it has four different meanings and you go wow how did that happen and in the word jesse there had several different meanings means to I possess and it also not just I possess but it has been substance or existence and it also means I exist I arise or I come to pass wow okay prophet of mine Samuel go down to where I come to pass go to that household go and that household where does it happen to be in Bethlehem go down to Bethlehem and and because Jesse I exist in Bethlehem and we know what that means you you've heard you know why little Bethlehem you've heard the tape it's because Bethlehem means the house of God's bread and there's actually one more letter or one more little thing in there it's the bread for the battle so it has a very special I exist go down with your horn of oil we know that represents the Holy Ghost CU I have S I send thee to I exist in the house of God's bread for the battle and that's how he's going to show you himself because he said I am going to provide me a king so we see the word of God come coming now unto to this Prophet to this prophet Samuel who had to me a special he's one I forgot I think it's in the book of Acts when it mentions the prophets Samuel was one of the ones where he started when he mentioned the prophets and it's when you think about Samuel it's Samuel God was revealed to him by the word of the Lord when God came to Samuel as a little boy he revealed himself by his word wow so he's telling this Prophet okay I reveal myself to you by my word Samuel so now you go down to where I exist in the house of my bread cuz I'm going to give him bread for the battle and I'm going to show me as the king do you understand all of a sudden there was a natural applic ation because there was a natural Samuel and there was a natural uh reaction in Samuel because Samuel's natural reaction is said how can I go CU that's how the next verse starts how can I go Saul's going to kill me that's the natural man that's the natural reaction but God tells him you go I'm going to provide me a king and we know what happens he goes down to the house of Jesse he takes the sacrifice he calls him together and tells them you know I have a job here to do and uh when they get there and all the different Sons they all line up and how that you know the first one he must have looked pretty good he was a soldier in Saul's Army you know fancy uniform whatever they used and wore and oh Samuel's like oh this is going to be easy right no that's not it so then the next one he was in Saul's Army too no no no no no no no and the natural reaction to Samuel is they have prophets have trials just like you and I and he's just gone through what he thinks all the sons are because he doesn't really know Jesse his first time there and he's like don't you got one more because he's standing there with the anointing oil and he's the end of the line you know Jesse I know God sent me here don't you have one more see that's the natural way of looking at this and spiritually he knows he's standing there in that annoying oil cuz God told him to go do this isn't there one more can you imagine just as as people the littlest boy you know the youngest one and in fact he wasn't even invited to the feast there he's the footw flunky basically and they said yeah we got one more but he's out with the Sheep go get him okay so here comes David you know killed the lion killed the bear and he comes in and here he when he gets there can you imagine those all those Brothers he smells cuz he's been with the Sheep he don't look too good and our little brother come on seriously Mr you know prophet Samuel and but that's the one God said that's the one that's the one he has something in him that can show me as a king number one he was a Shepherd Jesus Christ is the true Shepherd and he looks at this little Shepherd and he says that's the one anoint that one we know what happened he gets anointed and the Bible says that the spirit of God came on him from that day forward now just take a step into the next day they've had the feast you know the brothers are all gone doing whatever they're doing and here's David and he goes back out the next day with his staff I'm your new king guys popping him with the stick and his brothers are probably sitting back there they you know some of them are like King huh our little brother is a king and here here is his kingdom is a bunch of sheep but it was God providing himself as a king showing the shepherd and it comes into great play later on in life about David and being a shepherd and how that you know he went right back out to the sheep and he did the things that Shepherds do with the sheep and and all of those things and uh then the others they go off to battle with Saul and I I know you're familiar with the story there how that you know this the brothers and stuff they're all down there to fight the battle and oh they're big and tough right I used to think I was tough I don't feel so tough anymore more do you older fellas feel tough you do you're bet doing better than me but uh they you know and then here this Goliath gets up and they all you know they're down here like this peeking over the rocks and here comes their little brother now Jesse that's the one that I exist told David go down and feed your brothers at the Battle remember what where they lived Bethlehem the house of God spread for the battle and so here he takes this stuff down to see his brothers and Goliath comes up and you know they're all hiding and shivering in their boots as we'd say and uh David gets there and he jumps up on the Rock and goes what are you guys doing this what an uncircumcised Philistine challenging the armies of the Living God what's that in David that's God that's the King of Kings is starting to expose himself in the life of a Shepherd boy now what's he exposing well he's exposing himself to be the king over the battle and David we know what happens he goes uh and they're all going David get down you Troublemaker it says they thought he came there to make trouble get down you're going to get us all killed well no he just doesn't want that Philistine to rule over Israel and so they sent him to Saul and Saul you know said hey I admire your courage here put my armor on did you ever really think about it now Saul's a head taller than every and head and David's a head smaller I personally you don't have to accept this part I think they did it to mock him because they put the coat of mail on him and he can't move and then they put the you know the the breastplate and his arms are hanging out the sides and when they put the helmet on he can't see nothing but he was gracious enough to say we know that's nice stuff Saul but I can't use that and what he went down there with again remember this is God expressing himself through David and it said that when he went to face the Philistine we all think about the sling where did he get the leather for the sling it doesn't grow on trees he had to have made a sacrifice somewhere to get that leather in the first place and when he went to the to face him to face the Philistine he took stopped at the brook of kedron and picked up five it says smooth stones to use in that sling it only took one to kill the Philistine but you know I got this phone that's just ringing like crazy and I thought I had it all shut off but we're just going to excuse me for just a moment off off I don't need to talk to you I don't know who you are so stop sorry I thought I had it off modern technology thank you but uh so he picked up these five smooth stones and I like to use this par that particular part of the scripture because it only took one to kill the Philistine but when we're preaching Divine Healing I don't care what's your uh you know what's your problem is I I I you know I mean I care a as a man but five smooth Stones I am the god that Health all of your diseases he sent his word and healed the people Believers lay hands on the sick and they shall recover uh the prayer of faith shall save the sick and uh yeah I said I am the guy anyway there's five of them uh and how that he picked up you got five Stones friend I don't care what you if you got cancer I don't care what you call it what it is uh with his stripes you healed that's number five you got five Stones go kill that devil but you have to put it into action and the other thing that when he went to face that Philistine with he had the shepherd's staff you know what the prophet of God said that staff represented Calvary The Old Rugged Cross so he goes down with Calvary with it's Christ I mean it's God in David showing himself what he's doing to become king and so he goes and he faces him with The Old Rugged Cross and what do the stones represent a revelation because when Peter came to went to you know Jesus said Peter who do you say that I am and I like to ask that question every service of I can who do you say that he is and Peter said you're the Christ the son of the Living God and he said on this Stone I'll build on this Stone this Revelation I'll build my church for Flesh and Blood hath not Reeve this to you but my Father which is in heaven and so he goes down with the Revelation he has God in his hand and God in the sling and how that when he it says that the the stone hit the the you know Goliath in the forehead and when he fell and let's just pick it up there I think it's in in 17 in chapter 17: 50 it says and David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David so he prevailed he overcame this Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote him and killed him but he didn't have a sword but Watch What Happens because again this comes into play this is God showing us himself in the life or In the Flesh of David and so it said that David R man and he stood upon the Philistine and took his sword he drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead they fled what just happened now David's just killed this guy with the the stone and the sling and now he runs over remember this is a big guy and David's the little drink drink of water and he jumps up on him and he picks up this sword that belongs to Goliath and he slays him cuts his head off it's God showing us himself in the life and In the Flesh of David let's go to Genesis 49 and watch just what happened praise the Lord you said we could do this brother so we'll are you okay every everybody's all right if you get tired you need to go out I it's you're not you know the brother said he put new batteries and they're worth eight hours so thank you brother and so in Genesis 49:8 this is where Jacob has called all his sons together and he's beginning to to speak over them Their Blessings or in some cases curses as far as the word of the Lord concerning their tribes and he comes down to Judah in verse 8 49:8 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise and then there's those two little dots there's things in the message that uh brother Stan price I don't know if you know him he's down in Florida and he was talking about recently we traveled together for a little bit and he he said it really struck him one time because he was going to preach on uh Song of Solomon and he thought he could do it in about you know five or six messages right well he said a year later he finished the last one and he said it was because God told him slow down and then brought to his memory where brother Brandon was hunting with the old Indian guide and he said and the old Indian told him you know white man WTH You know lookth once walketh nine time he said the Indian look nine times walk once and he said if we slow down and really look at things those two dots you know they're all over in the scripture you know brother brandom said that represents a time frame so there's time he said in the one scripture he used in this day the scriptures fulfilled her in uh birth pains he said there was 2,000 years between those two dots now Judah Thou Art he whom thy bre and shall praise time frame thy hand shall be in the neck of the ene of thine enemies time frame thy father's children shall bow down before thee what are we looking at Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise did they praise David when he won the battle after the battle was over they did but there's a more important verse there that he said thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies that's not talking about a nice massage no the neck of the enemy when you break it down it means to cut the head off because it's to sever the headship of the enemy what's the first thing David did when he jumped up on that giant and cut his head off he could have went back and pointed to Genesis 49 and said this day this scripture is fulfilled because he cut the head off of the enemy but it was God showing here is the Fulfillment of a scripture one of the fulfillments of a scripture out of Genesis 49 that came as a blessing from God through the prophet Jacob that has traveled through history yes this prophecy came from forth and God from that moment on began to put all the pieces together to bring it to pass a few hundred years from the time that this prophecy is given this circumstance and this one begat this one and this brother you know he just fell in love with this one sister named Rahab she's so beautiful but what was it it was God setting the stage to bring that scripture right there to pass that he would put his hand in the neck of the enemies and then you can run it again but every has compound meaning compound Revelation brother brandom said and the father's children shall bow down before thee what is it every knee shall bow every tongue confess you see how God begins to weave it together peace by piece to fulfill this portion and sometimes you'll not just fulfill it once he'll fulfill it again and again and again just like the light he continually fulfills it by the creative power of almighty God because he is a Creator and so we see God fulfilling that boy if I get into verse 9 we got a whole another message going because it's three comings of Jesus Christ go home and read it verse 9:49 and so we look at uh David and how that he fulfills that he cut the head off of that enemy and he fulfills Genesis 49 or a piece of Genesis 49:8 and how that that's what are we talking we started with the seed of David what is the seed of David it's Christ it was the word of the Lord is the seed of David because the word came to the prophet who was sent to a certain place to a certain brother's household to anoint himself the king and so it's I don't know why my nose is running all of a sudden excuse me but uh how that it's the word of God being manifested and so here he is he has fulfilled that part of that scripture and we know then that after that his brothers praised him because you know Saul has killed his thousands David has killed his 10 thousands which Paul Saul was not happy about that of course and because he's thinks he's still the king but according to the word of the Lord he wasn't and how so we see this and we continue through the life of David and it's God revealing himself of some part of God that's going to be revealed in the scripture and it can be as that one was past tense and yet it can also be future tense because with God he created time he lives in eternity he can step in and out of it any time he wants to because he's God and so but now he's expressing himself as the king through David and how we know that David you know got chased by by Saul and Saul's armies and how that think about it the king the anointed king this Great and Mighty Warrior that killed Goliath and he's hiding in the back of a cave afraid to go anywhere just him and his one buddy and they're going looking you know peeking out of the cave going what are we going to do and you know come morning they're going to come in here and kill us all or kill us and and you know probably snuck out of the cave that night I mean I somehow they got out of there but what was it well the natural side was they had to get out of the cave because David is Anointed to be the next king but what is it it's Christ brother brand I just was listening to it the other day he said God hid himself in the Tomb by Death from Israel David is hiding himself in the rock as good as Dead from the armies of Israel think about what's going on right now friends see he was hiding himself in that cave he was fulfilling a certain part of scripture that may or that came to pass once when David was in the I mean when Christ was in the Tomb and perhaps is coming to pass again today I don't know I don't have that prophetic Vision that I can tell you but I know this that that word goes on and on and on and so there comes a certain place and I love God's sense of humor because there comes a place where David Goes Down to the one king running from Saul running for his life and he goes down to this one king and can you imagine here's the mighty Goliath killer and he goes to this King and he's asking basically for uh you know not assistance necessarily but uh for like uh help he needs a place to live because he's getting tired of running from Saul and can you imagine this King his guys are standing there looking at isn't this the one that you know they said slew the 10,000s and they're looking at their King and they're ready to draw their swords and kill this guy and here's our next King David in this case throws himself on the ground and starts Thro around like a wild man a crazy man and they're all here they're ready to kill him and now they're backing away from him did you know that country had a law that said they couldn't kill a crazy man he knew exactly what he was doing so sometimes if you're acting crazy I had a friend that worked in a sane Asylum he said the best way to subdue a crazy man is to act crazier than he is he said it really works so if y'all think I'm crazy that's good just depends on what you think crazy is but uh so here he is you know doing this action for the king but he's using it the whole time to his own benefit for the kingdom of God but there comes a certain place actually just before that before he goes down there that the strangest thing happens and we'll turn to 1st Samuel 21 because we're talking about the concept of the word of God expressing himself and in this time through the seed of David and in 1 Samuel chapter 21 we see another strange event in the life of David and in this case Jonathan and David have met for the last time and he says go in peace and they swore a covenant between them and it said that uh Jonathan went back to the city and David takes off because he's afraid Saul's going to kill him in verse in chapter 21 it says then David came to Knob to a himc the priest and a himc was afraid at the meeting of David and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee and David says unto him like the priest the king hath commanded me a business and has said un unto me let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee and what have I commanded Thee I have appointed thee or I have appointed my servants to such and such a place now either David just lied because Saul the king did not command David to go do this or there's that outside guy or on the inside God is saying the king's business hath sent me here because the king's business is to bring David to power as the king do you understand every scripture has compound meaning and compound Revelation and we look at it from the natural aspect David you liar Saul never sent you down there but from the supernatural aspect the king's business the king's business commanded him to do this and so he goes down there and we know we're familiar again with the story I assume that we are uh he asks do you have any bread and again this comes up as a future thing that's going to happen because David is asking for bread and the only bread that the priest has he he said is the shoe bread which was only for the priest to eat and and the priest you know may he said he was a little nervous that David was even there but he said here okay you can have this bread and we fast forward into the future where Jesus when the disciples are out picking the corn on the Sabbath day and the the the scribes and Pharisees they want to uh hey what's with your Apostles they're breaking the law Jesus said is not it written in your prophets that David ate the shoe bread which was unlawful for him to eat see it moving moving through time and so they give him the the shoe bread and there's there's other things we could look at with that and uh in verse 7 there was a man from Saul who saw this and eventually he took the life of that priest because that priest gave David the shoe bread but David's a prophet you believe that sure he was the Psalms are in the book David wrote A lot of them he's a prophet he is God's representative in a man of what God is going to become as the king and it says that after they've eaten and David in verse eight and David said unto the himc is there not here under thy hand a spear or a sword I have neither brought my sword nor my weapon with me because the king's business required haste he had to get on this right away because Saul wanted to kill him wow the types and Shadows Lord and the priest answers and says this when you come to church you expect him you know to get AKs or something here off the wall and you know have all these weapons to fight with but David goes to this priest and says I need a weapon I need a sword and the priest answers in verse 9 the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom th slew in the valley of elaw behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou Wilt take it take that take it for there's no other save that here and David said there's none like it give it to me give it to me now what are we recognizing here okay on the altar they would hang the ephod over the front of the alter and I assume perhaps on this one they had the uran thumb and and stuff they would hang those things there by The Altar and then the altar is behind that and he said that this sword he said is uh it's wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod and so behind the ephod there in the Altar and uh he said it's you know you you took it from Goliath anyway and he said said and so David he said it's the only one I've got and David he the high the priest hands the sword to David and it's wrapped it's all wrapped up and David has just said there's no sword like that one give it to me we know again fast forward book of Acts it says that David was a man after God's Own heart what did he just receive from the priest and the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sh sword dividing aunder from the uh the joints the marrow the spirit the soul and he said there's no sword like that sword he receives as it were the word and you say what are you talking about remember it's God revealing himself in David and he he takes that sword and begins to unravel it from that cloth what is it it's a prophecy of God down through several hundred years to there were in the same country shepherds abiding over their flocks by night and lo the angel of the Lord came upon him and said today is born in the city of Bethlehem a savior who is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling cloth is Christ it's Christ in David it's Christ in the altar it's Christ in the priest it's Christ in the prophecy of the sword praise the lord we mentioned that uh he said you guys aren't very loud not to worry about it and I never worry about it anyway because brother that got me started ministering years ago 197 probably 475 he was a Shepherd boy from Leon Idaho and he said David CU you know as when I first started preaching you always expected you know people to jump up and down and say Amen kick the pews over and I preached a couple of times and nobody said anything and I said brother Sergeant I don't understand he said brother the Sheep never bleed when they're feeding so it's all right y'all be quiet as much as you want praise the Lord and so we see it's Christ manifesting and prophesying through David how he's going to even come as the sword the word what Mary said be it unto me according to your word and how did the word come wrapped in swaddling cloth every word points us to Jesus Christ somehow and we're talking about the seed of David and how it's traveling through history and how it's traveling in his life and through his life as he goes we know that you know eventually he fulfills the scripture I think it's in 1 Chronicles 11 that's the wrong one but it's in Chronicles 11 and 13 it said that Jew Judah and Israel came together and anointed David King over all of Israel what was the first prophecy to Samuel go anoint me a king and so David is Anointed as a king by all of Israel at the Fulfillment of the word of God through a prophet's Ministry you think he's going to leave you un anointed do we really think that God is not going to anoint this bride to bring forth Jesus Christ he can only create that which is in him I love him but there's another in this one I I've heard people say well but David Fell well it looks like it he took a wife that he shouldn't have took and I don't have the information with me about what B sheba's husband was and stuff but I believe the word the name Bas Sheba means the child of the oath God made an oath and David takes her in adultery and I'm not here to uh condone adultery but because of that adultery we know that eventually David winds up going losing his kingdom and he goes up this hill and he sits down on a certain Rock and weeps over Jerusalem as he sees his kingdom being taken away from him 600 years later Jesus Christ walked up the same Hill and we wept over Jerusalem it was Christ or God in David the the word of God in David so what just happened what sent David to that place adultery what sent Jesus Christ to that same place and you can unravel all the way back to the Garden of Eden it was adultery because under the law which was not even written says if a man seduce a woman he shall utterly she shall utterly become his wife and when the serpent took her she became his wife and when Adam took her it actually even though she was part of him it became an act of adultery it was adultery that sent Christ to that same Rock it's all Christ friends but what else there's something else in between when he was on that rock and when he took bath Sheba there's another Prophet on the scene now and he comes to David and what's he do David's the king he's got all this power he's got these armies he's got I don't know how many wives by this time and he's got all this stuff and all and he's this he has become the king over all Israel all Judah and here he's done this heinous act and and this Prophet comes to him and he tells him the story of a shepherd and David think about it his mind going back to those sheep and how important one sheep was that he risked his life to kill a lion and he risked his life to kill a bear and oh the righteous indignation begins to raise up because he knows the value if that man only had one one sheep he understood the value and he said that man should die and have you ever read it closely the very words that the serpent used to deceive Eve Thou shalt not surely die were the same words that the prophet spoke to David to Grant him the grace of God David said that man shall die he said you'll not surely die David do you talk about Grace but it's more than just sparing the life of David there's more to it because remember this is God showing himself as king Hallelujah because if a woman and a man were caught in adultery they were both supposed to be stoned and killed and that Grace that came through our David Jesus Christ stood there to spare that child of the oath who was going to bring the next king of Israel because the bride could not be stoned if the husband was not stoned nobody can get to you without going through Jesus Christ because she was spared through David we are spared through the life of Jesus Christ do we understand every scripture compound meaning compound Revelation there was a natural man a natural woman a natural adultery there was a spiritual adultery from the garden that brought a spiritual King to weep from the same place and he wept for Jerusalem and we know that Jerusalem will be redeemed yet to come so we see the god fulfilling over and over and over and creating all the circumstances and putting the people in the right spots and the right with the right words to say the right thing things to bring to pass the word of God praise the Lord and we know that eventually he was given back his kingdom and how that he retook the throne after much struggles and temptation ations trials and all of that but it was the seed of David that seed of David was the word of God that started when God told the prophet anoint me a king and through that anointing God the word of God took the life of David to show us the life of Jesus Christ over and over and over we think of David at the The Well of Bethlehem and how he just all his his desire was oh if I just if I could just have a drink from The Well of Beth of him and it was Gentiles that fought their way to the well and brought back the water and when I was younger Christian I used to really disturb me because it you know after they did all this the life the B the Bible says they laid their lives in Jeopardy to bring him that drink of water and he gets that drink of water how would you feel in the natural friend if you know maybe you got a few scars on you and you're going to hang on with a bruise for the rest of your life or whatever and and here's your king or you're soon to be king and he dumps it out on the ground it was Christ it was Christ showing that from The Well of Bethlehem comes the water and it was Christ pouring him out himself out for you and I because he said in the 22nd Psalm written by David after he had fallen into the adultery I am poured out like water God showing him himself again he poured himself out for you and I wow praise the Lord I just stand amazed over and over and over let's look at Acts chapter 13 do you love him I just wow Jesus I have 13 let's see verse 22 there we go and here is he's talking there and he starts through the you know the the things that the Lord has done there for the Jews and he comes to verse 21 acts 13 and 21 and after they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed moved him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will and of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus David desired God's heart I have found the son of Jesse the son of the man who exists whose name means existence whose name means to arise or come to pass I have found this man a man after my own heart and he shall fulfill F my will who shall fulfill the will it's that sword David received the sword and we receive the sword as it were the sword of the Lord the word of God every scripture has different strata different layers in which we can look and every scripture Prophet said after the seals every scripture somehow will point us to Jesus Christ I hope tonight you have seen Jesus Christ in this Bible because he's in every word every single word pray for us pray for me uh we could get into the Seed of Abraham tomorrow night if you'd like and uh also an interesting thing or we could look at the seed of job who also had a large part in this Bible uh we love him and it's the house of God 's bread to where we have come tonight and I hope this gives you strength for the battle I like the book of Colossians I believe it's in the second chapter he tells them to have this book read also to the to the ladyo Le oans however you pronounce it brother Bram used to say lady oans and he said because there is let's I'll I'll let's just close with that it's in Colossians the 2 chapter to help us understand when Paul is preaching these things uh is second chapter of Colossians verse one for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at leoda for this for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh have we seen his face in the flesh not Paul never did I've not seen the fleshly man of Jesus face to face but you know what I'm part of that Conflict for I would that ye knew what a great conflict I have for you and for them that are lisans that's us we are in a conf lict we are in a Warfare and this word is the bread for the battle this word is what gives you the power to [Music] overcome so God

have received you in the name of Jesus Christ if there be anything Lord any seed or something said that have not has not pointed them to you Lord I would never do that intentionally I never want anyone to look at me I'm not worthy to even be looked at as the Gentile woman said Lord just give me the crumbs from the table she knew you called her a dog and and she said master all I wants the crumbs so Lord even if all we get is the crumbs Lord just remember the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight and there's enough power in those crumbs to Grant her healing for her daughter to Grant her a position in your word that Jesus said where have I seen such great faith so we give you this word tonight that they might take it and gather Faith around it to realize you are the Creator and you have created a life and a nature in them through your beloved Son Jesus Christ and by this word of God we give this service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen so if it's all right I would praise the Lord thank you sometimes trials are there for a reason and Lord kind of give us this uh song at the end of a trial if I struggle a little bit with the piano part tonight I tore this bone out of my wrist

Savior and let the both live in me once more let's sing it let the Hallelujah dear Lord show me myself within Thy word show me myself and show me my savior and that the F live in me you know as he was speaking there tonight and you know he talked about Christ revealing himself and David and David was a shepherd and not a king yet it was still Christ then David goes and he kills Goliath and it's Christ again and then it's David going and running from his enemies and it's Christ again and is David getting in hard spots in life and it's Christ again and it's David guarding and helping people and they don't know he's there and it's Christ again and then he goes and asks for something something and they reject him and it's Christ again then he gets the kingdom and it's Christ and then he loses the kingdom and it's Christ and it's the ups and downs and the ins and outs and it's all Christ and we think that as the bride of Christ it's all going to be UPS it's all going to be victories but remember it's how we go through the trials that prove what's in us not just the victory but you got to go through the trial you got to go through the battle to come to the Christ that's on the other side the the great Victor the king of kings and Lord of lords so tonight don't just say well I'm down here that's Christ still that's right that's right but remember he didn't stay in the cave he didn't stay in the grave but he rose again he didn't lose his kingdom he came into his kingdom again and man it was God that lifted him set him in a place where he can never be removed so as we go through this I believe you're going to continue this I believe that's the way it's going to go we'll see but but but but understand that as he was just preaching that I thought that he thought of me the same way that he thought of Christ the same way that he thought of David the same way that he thought of Samuel and of Daniel he thought of you the same way you know I was reading in Jeremiah the other morning in devotions and he said it was like a fire in my bones you ever lay a hold of something and you don't know why it's because there's something in you to produce the word that you just read it's in you to produce the message that you just heard it's in you to produce the god that revealing himself to you that's what's going on it's not just a word it's not just a Bible it's not just a message but it is the Life of Christ coming into you and it's producing itself and whether it's a hard time whether it's a good time whether it's a mountain top or whether it's a valley experience there's something in you that's coming out and it's Christ being revealed that's what is happening in these Services that's what's happening when you read the message when you hear the message when you read your your Bible is it's Christ revealing who you are in him and he's living himself through you and you say how can this be I'm just a woman I'm just a wife I'm just a mother I'm just a husband I'm just a father I'm just a mechanic I'm just a engineer I'm just a this I'm just a that but that we ought to say as Mary did be it onto me according to your word Lord if you reveal it to me then it's for me if he reveals to you then that's because it's for you it's for it's for you to live it out amen so as we listen to this weekend it's sounds so simple Brother David that wasn't a shouting and dancing type of service but if you realize what he's talking about I could preach an hour I could preach an hour on what we just heard I could preach a weekend on this but it's his Pulpit this weekend but I'm saying there's more to this you sit there and you think about what he thought of David and the revelation of Christ through David is this the same thing he's doing today in a chosen elected bride of Jesus Christ you are the word made flesh today so when you read that scripture don't say that's not for me say why not me if I can read it and he can reveal it to me then I can live it because it's not I that live but it's Christ that lives Within Me amen amen I was wonderful that was wonderful I might have been quiet but it was wonderful because I didn't know how far he was going to go but it was a beautiful sermon Brother David God bless you for that amen let's see ourselves in the book amen this is given the scripture is given for our admonition it's for us to live it's for us to produce amen this is the only other time aside from the book of Acts that we get to live a full word amen let's not hold ourselves short let's not sell ourselves short if he said it's about us it's for us to live amen amen God bless you let's let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what a beautiful thing you showed us this evening if we could only catch hold of it Lord Lord not for our brother or sister not for someone in history Lord but Lord this day this word is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled Lord and it's in a bride Lord that you chose before the foundation of the world you laid Our lives our names in the Lamb's Book of Life Lord and you called us forth in a time and through situations Lord and then seasons and people Lord and you connected the dots Lord to produce a person that could live this life by the power of almighty God through US Lord I say Lift Our Eyes Lord lift our sights up higher Lord let us see ourselves in the book Lord let us see our name in the book and the exploits of the Holy Spirit written next to it Lord that we could be the word made flesh once again we pray Lord God lord would you just bless your people that have sat here patiently listening Lord Quicken your word to us Lord Make It Personal to us heavenly father I pray Lord there's those that are sick May the Holy Ghost go Lord Lord and heal their bodies Lord Jesus Lord may they cut the head off that demon this evening we pray never more to be bothered Lord and when it comes back again to give him the next Stone and the next Stone and the next Stone until it never comes back again Lord God Lord bless each one restore our brother strength Heavenly Father Lord give him a leadership Lord a wisdom a direction for these Services Lord and we'll hear it and accept it gladly we pray each one Lord just bless us now we pray we thank you for your goodness Lord we thank you for your word Lord we thank you for your promise Lord be with us we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] amen [Music] h [Music]
