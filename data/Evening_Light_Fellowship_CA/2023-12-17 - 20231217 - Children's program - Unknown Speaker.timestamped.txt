[9:20] today it's good to be back in the house
[9:22] of the Lord and you probably saw in your
[9:25] program that that chorus wasn't there
[9:28] but it's also very appropriate as when
[9:31] brother brandham talked about Christmas
[9:33] he said the world celebrates and that
[9:35] implies he said is my words partying and
[9:39] all the stuff that uh that the world
[9:41] does but he said we come to worship he
[9:45] said and Christmas is a Time To Worship
[9:47] right and so that makes that quite
[9:50] appropriate we came today to worship God
[9:53] Amen a little bit of a different uh type
[9:55] of service but uh I believe the Lord is
[9:58] behind it he always always has blessed

[43:19] [Applause]
[43:25] wonderful
[43:55] for
[44:45] [Music]
[44:54] for
[45:05] the youth present a shadow play based on
[45:07] the excerpt from the message on the
[45:09] wings of a snow white dove preached by
[45:12] William brandham on November 28th
[45:17] 1965 and John being a prophet knowing
[45:21] the word had to be fulfilled he suffered
[45:23] that and baptized him
[45:26] and when he was raised up out of the
[45:29] water there came the message from Heaven
[45:32] on the wings of a dove this is my
[45:35] beloved
[45:36] Son he sent the redemp Redemption
[45:39] message of Grace on the wings of a dove
[45:43] come flying down out of the heavens
[45:46] peace on Earth and Good Will toward
[45:50] men the sacrifice was ready right then
[45:53] been raised fed his ministry was ready a
[45:58] word that would redeem the whole world
[46:01] it's
[46:03] over now the dove is used in the Bible
[46:06] as a symbol of
[46:08] peace and also it's used by Nations as a
[46:12] symbol of peace we have Nations like our
[46:16] nation is represented by an
[46:18] eag and there's other birds in other
[46:21] nations Rome has an eagle Germany has an
[46:25] eagle many of them great birds of the
[46:29] sky but in all of them the dove
[46:32] symbolizes peace in all nations it's a
[46:36] universal
[46:38] thing just like brother green said one
[46:41] night brother perig green
[46:44] said the symbol of surrender is raise
[46:47] your hands Any Nation raise up your
[46:51] hands it surrender he said when you sing
[46:55] raise your hands
[46:56] you surrender it
[46:59] all and the dove is the symbol of peace
[47:02] in every nation why is it
[47:05] done because of its gentleness and
[47:08] because of its innocence that's the
[47:10] reason it symbols
[47:13] peace another thing about the dove it is
[47:17] a home loving bird it loves to stay at
[47:20] home and another thing it is it's always
[47:24] loyal to its mate the dove male or
[47:27] female never leave one another that
[47:30] female finds her mate in Mating Season
[47:33] see that's complimentary to God's Great
[47:36] creation she's got a great
[47:39] responsibility the dove is always loyal
[47:41] to his mate always never leaves
[47:45] her and may I stop here just for a
[47:48] minute to say this a true bride a female
[47:50] dove is loyal to her mates too it won't
[47:54] inject any dogmas and any denominational
[47:56] doctrines anything of the world it'll
[48:00] stay loyal to its mate the word always
[48:05] loyal and by this home loving conduct by
[48:09] the conduct of it home loving it's been
[48:12] successfully used for a carrier pigeon
[48:15] because it loves home you turn it loose
[48:18] anywhere it'll always go back home it'll
[48:21] go back
[48:24] home we'd like to stress on that a
[48:26] little while and you Christians would
[48:29] understand what I mean it's always finds
[48:32] its way back home so therefore it's been
[48:35] used for carrier pigeon it's used in
[48:38] time of War used to be they still use
[48:41] the carrier pigeons to carry a message
[48:44] so you see then that makes a dove both
[48:46] by God and man a
[48:49] messenger a dove is a
[48:53] messenger it's a message of not to Noah
[48:56] to tell Noah that there's peace again it
[48:59] was used by God to vindicate that this
[49:02] was his son the sacrifice to bring peace
[49:05] upon the Earth and Good Will to men it
[49:09] was used as a
[49:12] messenger right here I have a little
[49:15] story in my mind I read one time out of
[49:17] a book and now I don't want to say what
[49:21] this for sure it may be the decline of
[49:23] the first world war I'm not positive of
[49:26] that now if you miss seeing it then I'm
[49:29] wrong I either read it in a book it's
[49:31] been many years ago but it was certainly
[49:35] a really dramatic thing that
[49:42] happened the American soldiers are
[49:44] pinned down by German machine gun fire
[49:48] and they were in kind of a pit You
[49:50] Soldiers I guess you understand how they
[49:52] were on a reconnaissance somewhere and
[49:55] they was pinned down and they had just a
[49:57] little bit of ammunition left and the
[49:59] Germans was moving in great units moving
[50:02] in everywhere and they know that unless
[50:04] they'd get some reinforcement some help
[50:07] that they would soon all die they had to
[50:10] the Germans coming right down off the
[50:12] mountains looking right down their neck
[50:14] coming right into them like
[50:17] that and one of them happened to
[50:19] remember that he had a little mascot a
[50:21] little pigeon so he knew that this
[50:24] pigeon if it could get up out there
[50:25] would carry the message to the main
[50:27] headquarters to where they were they'd
[50:29] been
[50:29] stationed and so they sat down and wrote
[50:32] on a note we are pinned down in a
[50:35] certain position at a certain area we're
[50:38] out of ammunition and in a few hours
[50:40] we'll have to surrender or other or
[50:43] either we'll be
[50:44] massacred and they pinned this or tied
[50:46] it to the foot of this little Dove and
[50:48] turned him
[50:50] loose now he's a home loving bird so he
[50:53] what does he do he takes back home to
[50:56] find his mate she was worried about him
[50:59] he'd have to come back home and as he
[51:02] went up the Germans seen what had
[51:03] happened so the thing they' done they
[51:05] started shooting at the Dove and one of
[51:07] them hit him with a 30 caliber machine
[51:10] gun bullet and broke his leg another one
[51:12] tore big honk out of his back his chest
[51:15] was bruised all the way across one of
[51:18] his wings was crippled the end shot of
[51:20] half of it and he flew
[51:22] sideways but he kept climbing
[51:25] and finally he made it crippled wounded
[51:29] broken bruised but he fell in the camp
[51:32] with the
[51:33] message that was a great
[51:37] Dove but oh brother Isaiah 53 tells us
[51:42] of one came down from
[51:44] home and all that was good and he was
[51:47] wounded for our
[51:50] transgressions he was bruised for our
[51:52] iniquity and the chastisement of our
[51:55] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[51:59] we are
[52:01] healed sickness Superstition and Devils
[52:05] had us pinned down there was no way out
[52:08] the church had gone wrong they had went
[52:11] off on denominational things and the
[52:14] Pharisees and the Sadducees and washing
[52:16] of pots and pans and the word of God
[52:19] became of no
[52:20] effect but this little Dove came down
[52:23] and there's only one thing that could
[52:25] tell take place there had to be a
[52:29] redeemer but being wounded broken beaten
[52:35] torn but he knowed his way back home so
[52:39] from calvary's Cross where they bruised
[52:41] him mashed him tore him like a bunch of
[52:44] wolves upon him he made his flight from
[52:47] Calvary and he landed in Heaven's Door
[52:50] saying it's
[52:54] finished
[52:56] it's finished they are
[52:58] free sickness can be healed
[53:05] now Sinners can be saved the captive can
[53:08] be set
[53:12] free though he was bruised and wounded
[53:15] that great battle there when everything

[53:19] him even the poet
[53:22] cried mid mid rendering rocks and
[53:24] darkening
[53:26] disguise My Savior bowed his head and

[1:12:16] and special guests present a reading of
[1:12:19] the Christmas
[1:12:21] story introduction
[1:12:24] at the beginning of time when God
[1:12:26] promised to put em enity between the
[1:12:29] woman's seed and the Serpent's Seed the
[1:12:32] Fallen World longed for a redeemer a
[1:12:35] savior as the years passed God confirmed
[1:12:38] his promise to Abraham Isaac Jacob Judah
[1:12:43] and each successive
[1:12:45] generation he also spoke to David
[1:12:48] through Nathan the prophet
[1:12:51] saying when your days are over and you
[1:12:54] rest with your ancestors I will raise up
[1:12:56] your Offspring to succeed you your own
[1:12:58] flesh and blood and I will establish his
[1:13:01] kingdom he is the one who will build a
[1:13:03] house for my name and I will establish
[1:13:05] the Throne of his kingdom
[1:13:08] forever as the years passed God spoke
[1:13:11] through His prophets and encouraged his
[1:13:13] people again and again for example he
[1:13:16] spoke through Isaiah
[1:13:19] say for to us a child is born to us a
[1:13:23] son of is given and the government shall
[1:13:25] be upon his shoulder and his name shall
[1:13:27] be called the wonderful counselor and
[1:13:29] the Mighty God and the Everlasting
[1:13:31] father and the Prince of Peace of the
[1:13:33] increase of his government and peace
[1:13:36] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[1:13:39] David and upon his kingdom to order
[1:13:43] it and to establish it with judgment and
[1:13:47] with Justice from hence forth even
[1:13:49] forever the Zeal of the Lord of host
[1:13:52] will perform them
[1:13:54] in that day the root of Jesse will stand
[1:13:57] as a banner for the peoples the Nations
[1:14:01] will Valley to him and his resting place
[1:14:04] will be
[1:14:07] glorious after Isaiah's prophecies the
[1:14:10] years continued to pass one by one for
[1:14:12] 400 years almost forgotten the time
[1:14:16] finally came for the promises to be
[1:14:18] fulfilled each would unravel in mystery
[1:14:21] and simplicity the broken world would
[1:14:24] witness a glory so wonderful yet so
[1:14:26] humble it would almost seem hidden if it
[1:14:29] were not for
[1:14:30] Faith by these scriptures being
[1:14:33] fulfilled a way into light and life
[1:14:36] would be opened through great sacrifice
[1:14:38] and undeserved Grace welcoming whosoever
[1:14:41] will into it this is the beginning of
[1:14:44] God's promise to redeem his children

[1:29:00] and Mary arose in those days and went
[1:29:03] into the Hill Country with haste into a
[1:29:05] city of Judah and entered into the house
[1:29:07] of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth it
[1:29:11] came to pass that when Elizabeth had
[1:29:13] heard the salutation of Mary The Babe
[1:29:15] leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was
[1:29:17] filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake
[1:29:19] out with a loud voice and said
[1:29:25] blessed art thou among women and blessed
[1:29:27] is the fruit of thy womb L this is to me
[1:29:30] that the mother of my Lord should come
[1:29:32] to me for for L as soon as I voice of
[1:29:36] solitation sounding in my ears The Babe
[1:29:38] leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is
[1:29:41] she that believeth for thou shal be a
[1:29:43] performance of those things which were
[1:29:45] told her from the Lord and Mary
[1:29:48] said my soul doth magnify the Lord and
[1:29:52] my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior
[1:29:54] for he hath regarded the love state of
[1:29:56] his handmaiden for behold from hence
[1:29:59] forth all generations shall call me
[1:30:02] blessed for he that is mighty hath done
[1:30:05] to me great things and holy is his name
[1:30:08] and his Mercy is in is on them that fear
[1:30:10] Him from generation to generation he has
[1:30:13] shown strength in his arm and has
[1:30:15] scattered the proud in the indignation
[1:30:17] of their hearts for he hath put down the
[1:30:19] mighty from their seats and exalted them
[1:30:22] of low degree for he has filled the
[1:30:24] Hungry with good things and the rich he
[1:30:26] has sent empty away he has helped his
[1:30:29] servant Israel in remembrance of his
[1:30:31] Mercy as he spake to our fathers to
[1:30:34] Abraham and to his seed forever and Mary

[1:31:05] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:31:07] this
[1:31:08] wise when as's mother Mary was
[1:31:14] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:31:18] together she was found with with child
[1:31:22] of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her
[1:31:25] husband being a just man and not willing
[1:31:28] to make her public example was minded to
[1:31:32] put her away PIV
[1:31:37] priv but while he saw on these things
[1:31:41] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:31:43] unto him in a dream
[1:31:46] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[1:31:49] to take thee marry thy wife for that
[1:31:52] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[1:31:58] and thou shalt call him his name Jesus
[1:32:01] for he shall save his people from their
[1:32:05] sins now all this was done that it might
[1:32:08] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[1:32:11] Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[1:32:15] virgin shall be with
[1:32:17] child and shall bring forth a son and
[1:32:20] they shall they shall call his name
[1:32:23] Emmanuel which being interrupted
[1:32:26] interpreted is god with us then Joseph
[1:32:30] being raised from sleep did as the angel
[1:32:33] of the Lord had bitten him had bitten
[1:32:36] him and took unto his wife and now her
[1:32:41] not till she had brought forth her

[1:37:05] there went out a decree from Cesar
[1:37:07] Augustus that all the world should be
[1:37:09] taxed and this taxing was first made
[1:37:11] when cenius was governor of Syria and
[1:37:14] all went to be taxed everyone into his
[1:37:16] own City and Joseph also went up From
[1:37:19] Galilee out of the city of nazare unto
[1:37:21] Judea unto the city of David which is
[1:37:24] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[1:37:26] house and lineage of David to be taxed
[1:37:29] with Mary his espouse wife being great
[1:37:31] with child and so it was that while they
[1:37:34] were there the days were accomplished
[1:37:35] that she should be delivered and she
[1:37:37] brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:37:40] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:37:42] laid him in a Manger because there was
[1:37:44] no room for them in the

[1:48:53] child his name was called Jesus which
[1:48:56] was so named the angel before he was
[1:48:58] conceived in the womb and when the days
[1:49:00] of her purification according to the law
[1:49:02] of Moses were accomplished they brought
[1:49:05] him to Jerusalem to present him to the
[1:49:07] Lord as it is written in the law of the
[1:49:09] Lord every meale that openeth the womb
[1:49:11] Shall be Called holy of the Lord and
[1:49:14] offer a sacrifice according to that
[1:49:15] which is said in the law of the Lord a
[1:49:18] pair of T does or two young pigeons
[1:49:21] and behold there was a man in Jerusalem
[1:49:23] whose name was Simeon and the same was a
[1:49:26] just and devout man waiting for the
[1:49:29] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:49:31] was upon him and it was revealed unto
[1:49:34] him by the holy ghost that he should not
[1:49:36] see death before he had seen the Lord's
[1:49:38] Christ and when he came by the spirit
[1:49:40] into the temple when the parents brought
[1:49:42] in the Child Jesus to do for him after
[1:49:44] the custom of the law then took he up in
[1:49:47] his arms and blessed God and said Lord
[1:49:51] now letest thou thy servant depart in
[1:49:54] peace according to Thy word for mine
[1:49:57] eyes have seen thy
[1:49:59] salvation which thou Hast prepared
[1:50:01] before the face of all people a light to
[1:50:04] lighten the
[1:50:06] Gentiles and the glory of thy People
[1:50:10] Israel and Joseph and his mother mared
[1:50:14] at these at those things were just
[1:50:16] spoken of him and Simeon blessed them
[1:50:18] and said unto his mother Mary's mother
[1:50:21] behold this child is set for the fall
[1:50:24] and Rising again of many in Israel and
[1:50:28] for a sign which shall be spoken against
[1:50:31] yay a sword shall pierce through thy own
[1:50:34] soul also that the thoughts of many
[1:50:36] hearts may be
[1:50:39] revealed and there was one Anna a
[1:50:42] propheus the daughter of punu of the
[1:50:44] tribe of Asher she was of a great age
[1:50:47] and had lived with a husband 7 years
[1:50:49] from from her virginity and she was a
[1:50:52] widow of about 4 score and 4 years which
[1:50:55] departed not from the temple but served
[1:50:58] god with fastings and prayers night and
[1:51:00] day and when she coming in that instant
[1:51:03] gave things likewise unto the Lord and
[1:51:05] spake of him to all that looks for
[1:51:07] redemption in Jerusalem and when they
[1:51:09] had performed all things according to
[1:51:11] the law of the Lord they returned into

[1:52:16] and now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[1:52:19] of Judea and in the days of Herod the
[1:52:20] king behold there came wise men from the
[1:52:23] East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[1:52:26] that is born King of the Jews for we
[1:52:29] have seen his ear in the East and are
[1:52:31] come to worship him when Herod the king
[1:52:34] had heard these things he is troubled
[1:52:36] and all Jerusalem with him and when he
[1:52:38] had gathered all the chief priests and
[1:52:40] scribes of the people together he
[1:52:42] demanded of
[1:52:43] them where should the Christ be
[1:52:47] born and they said unto him
[1:52:51] in Bethlehem of Judea for thus is
[1:52:54] written by the prophet and thou
[1:52:56] Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not
[1:52:58] the least among the princes of Judah for
[1:53:00] out of thee shall come a governor and
[1:53:03] that shall rule My People
[1:53:07] Israel then Herod when he had privily
[1:53:10] called the wise men inquired of them
[1:53:11] diligently what time the star had
[1:53:13] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[1:53:15] and
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:17] said go in search diligent leave for the
[1:53:20] young child and when you have found him
[1:53:22] bring me word again that I may come and
[1:53:24] worship him
[1:53:27] also when they had heard the king they
[1:53:30] departed and though the star which they
[1:53:32] saw in the East went before them till it
[1:53:34] came and stood over where the young
[1:53:35] child was when they saw the star they
[1:53:38] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:53:41] when they were com into the house they
[1:53:42] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[1:53:45] and fell down and worshiped him when
[1:53:48] they had opened their Treasures they
[1:53:49] presented Ed unto him gifts gold and
[1:53:52] frankincense and myrr and being warned
[1:53:55] of God a dream that they should not
[1:53:56] return to Herod they departed into their
[1:53:59] own country another way and when they
[1:54:01] had departed behold the angel of the
[1:54:03] Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream
[1:54:07] saying arise and take thee in child and
[1:54:09] his mother and flee into Egypt and be
[1:54:12] thou there until I bring thee word for
[1:54:14] Herod will seek thee and child to
[1:54:16] destroy
[1:54:18] him
[1:54:20] when he arose he took the young child
[1:54:22] and his mother by night and departed
[1:54:23] into Egypt and there and was there until
[1:54:26] the death of Herod that might be
[1:54:28] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:54:30] by the prophet saying out of Egypt have
[1:54:32] I called my
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:48] son
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:55:01] then Herod when he saw that he is mocked
[1:55:03] of the wise men was exceeding wroth and
[1:55:05] sent forth and slew all the children
[1:55:07] that were in Bethlehem and all the
[1:55:10] coasts thereof from two two years old
[1:55:12] and under according to the time which he
[1:55:15] had diligently inquired of the wise men
[1:55:17] then was fulfilled that which was spoken
[1:55:19] spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying in
[1:55:22] Rama was there a voice heard lamentation
[1:55:26] and weeping great mour Rachel weeping

[2:00:01] but when Herod was dead behold an angel
[2:00:04] of the Lord appear in a dream to Joseph
[2:00:06] in Egypt
[2:00:09] saying arise and take the young child
[2:00:12] and his mother and go into the land of

[2:00:29] afraid to go thither not withstanding

[2:00:37] and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that
[2:00:39] it might be fulfilled which was spoken

[2:08:17] John
[2:08:26] amen you can have your seats if you will
[2:08:28] just a
[2:08:29] moment amen I certainly enjoyed that
[2:08:33] amen a lot of hard work a lot of effort
[2:08:35] went into that and we certainly
[2:08:36] appreciate sister Priscilla doing that
[2:08:38] and those that have come behind and
[2:08:40] helped I know she's not the one that
[2:08:41] built that and she's not the one that's
[2:08:43] sang All the specials but she was
[2:08:45] certainly the the driving force behind
[2:08:46] it so we want to thank her especially
[2:08:49] uh for for the hard work that she put in
[2:08:50] there and each one that willingly came
[2:08:52] and helped out it doesn't happen without
[2:08:54] the sound and the video working together
[2:08:56] and the musicians and sister Morin
[2:08:58] having to figure out 18 songs that we
[2:09:00] sing once a year you know so very
[2:09:03] thankful for that amen but as just
[2:09:05] before service started I was reading in
[2:09:07] Luke and they read it in in in in the
[2:09:10] program here this morning and it was
[2:09:13] remember when the the angel came to Mary
[2:09:15] and she says how is this going to happen
[2:09:18] you know and I think we've got to be
[2:09:19] able to bring what's what's happened
[2:09:21] there into what's happening today and we
[2:09:23] say how does this happen and the angels
[2:09:25] answered and said unto her the Holy
[2:09:27] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[2:09:30] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[2:09:33] it's the only way the word can be
[2:09:36] produced it's the same birth he was the
[2:09:38] first of many Brethren amen his birth
[2:09:40] has to be the same as our birth his way
[2:09:42] has to be our way it has to be a
[2:09:45] supernatural thing it has to be a thing
[2:09:47] that comes from God the power of the
[2:09:49] highest shall overshadow thee therefore
[2:09:51] also that Holy thing which shall be born
[2:09:53] of thee shall be called the Son Of God
[2:09:55] scripture says he was the firstborn
[2:09:57] among many Brethren it wasn't just he
[2:09:59] was the son of God but there were other
[2:10:01] sons of God there were other daughters
[2:10:02] of God that were coming behind and the
[2:10:04] holy thing that comes out of our life is
[2:10:06] not of us but it's the highest the the
[2:10:09] one the the the holy thing that's coming
[2:10:11] out of us is because the highest has
[2:10:12] overshadowed us because the Holy Spirit
[2:10:14] has been made alive inside of us but I
[2:10:17] want you to notice that it wasn't just
[2:10:18] Mary that was having a special birth
[2:10:21] because he said and behold thy cousin
[2:10:22] Elizabeth she had also conceived a son
[2:10:24] in her old age and this is the six month
[2:10:27] with her who is called Barren for with
[2:10:29] God nothing shall be impossible you'll
[2:10:32] find that a birth is surrounded by the
[2:10:34] Supernatural and it's not just me but
[2:10:36] it's you and it's you and it's you and
[2:10:38] it's a great thing that's going on and
[2:10:39] it's the moving of God to produce his
[2:10:41] word and its season amen and Mary said
[2:10:44] this behold the handmade of the Lord be
[2:10:47] it unto me according to Thy word you
[2:10:49] know and she goes and she meets up with
[2:10:52] Elizabeth and Elizabeth starts to talk
[2:10:54] to her and as soon as she hears the name
[2:10:56] we know that the baby John the Baptist
[2:10:58] in her womb comes to life or he he moves
[2:11:00] for the first time amen and Mary says
[2:11:03] and when is this to me or Elizabeth says
[2:11:05] whence is this to me that the mother of
[2:11:07] my Lord should come to me for lo as soon
[2:11:10] as the voice of thy salutation sounded
[2:11:12] in mine ears the Babe leaped in my womb
[2:11:14] for Joy the very presence the very
[2:11:17] thought not even manifested yet but the
[2:11:20] very inspiration the very start of that
[2:11:22] word was enough to bring life before he
[2:11:26] was born Christ was already performing
[2:11:28] Miracles what the presence of the Holy
[2:11:30] Ghost the fullness of God in somebody
[2:11:32] else and watch what she says she says
[2:11:35] blessed is she that
[2:11:39] believed you're blessed because you
[2:11:42] believe that's the only thing you can
[2:11:44] bring to the table Lord I believe she he
[2:11:48] says for there shall be a performance of
[2:11:50] those things which were told unto her
[2:11:52] from the Lord we've had a seventh angel
[2:11:55] come and he's told us what's going to
[2:11:56] happen and he's told us what God has
[2:11:58] promised us and he's pointed us to the
[2:12:00] word and he says the word has to come
[2:12:02] not just as it was 2,000 years ago but
[2:12:05] it has to come in flesh today and it's
[2:12:07] born in brothers and sisters and Sons
[2:12:09] and Daughters of God and it has to come
[2:12:11] because the highest overshadows them and
[2:12:13] the Holy Spirit comes to rest inside of
[2:12:15] them and it produces a life that they
[2:12:17] can't live for and all we can say is we
[2:12:20] believed and then we believed and
[2:12:22] there's a performance then of the things
[2:12:24] that he promised us that he would do and
[2:12:27] as we come into this new year I say
[2:12:29] let's believe that he's going to do what
[2:12:30] he said he was going to do the only one
[2:12:33] thing left for the bride and that's a
[2:12:34] Rapture and a resurrection that's the
[2:12:36] only thing we're looking for amen so
[2:12:38] let's believe that amen this morning
[2:12:40] let's stand if we would and sister
[2:12:41] morning if you can come back to the
[2:12:43] piano the musicians and let's just sing
[2:12:45] that song be it unto me according to Thy
[2:12:49] word amen and then we'll go out and
[2:12:52] we'll have a fellowship and there's food
[2:12:54] and we've got some gifts for the
[2:12:55] different ones that have supported the
[2:12:56] church this year and whatnot so if you
