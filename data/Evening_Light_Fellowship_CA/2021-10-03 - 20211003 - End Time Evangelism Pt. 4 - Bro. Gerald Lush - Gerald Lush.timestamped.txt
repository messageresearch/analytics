[43:28] but we're living in this world you're
[43:30] experiencing this you're experiencing
[43:32] this and that brother i tell you you're
[43:33] getting more and more and more
[43:35] revelation amen and the revelation that
[43:37] god has given and what god has done
[43:39] becomes more and more real and it's
[43:41] getting more and more serious
[43:43] oh yes definitely every hour that we're
[43:46] supposed to do what the scripture said
[43:48] look up and i'll tell you god's going to
[43:50] allow this to happen that to happen
[43:52] we'll experience this and that and
[43:54] brother the end result that god's
[43:55] looking for are you looking up
[43:57] amen your faith is going to look up amen
[44:01] because you know that what you what you
[44:03] need and what you want what god wants
[44:05] you to have brother is is not as a worry
[44:08] here but it's it's look up he wants to
[44:11] almost catch us up into a greater
[44:13] revelation catches up into a greater
[44:16] amen hunger and thirst for what he wants
[44:19] to do and not only that what he's doing
[44:22] amen so we've been we know that there's
[44:24] somebody angry and thirsting for what
[44:26] god's doing
[44:27] amen most definitely but i just trust by
[44:30] the grace of god that it's us
[44:32] amen that you're hungering that you're
[44:34] thirsting that it's just not religion
[44:36] i'm doing this and i'm doing this i go
[44:37] here and all mine and i'm experiencing
[44:40] that more and more and more that the
[44:42] people got religion but they're not
[44:43] spiritual amen very religious
[44:46] why again as i let me emphasize what the
[44:49] prophet said you're in the message but
[44:50] the message is not in you
[44:52] amen because if the message is in us
[44:55] we'll be spiritual
[44:57] if the message is in us we're going to
[44:59] focus mainly morning noon and night on
[45:01] the word of god and on the promise of
[45:03] god
[45:04] amen what god has promised amen and
[45:07] again all we thank them for you what you
[45:09] did lord yes that's good my son but what
[45:11] am i doing
[45:12] amen are you into what i'm doing
[45:15] oh yes there's too many into what god
[45:17] has done
[45:18] but how many are into what god's doing
[45:21] how many are really angry and thirsting
[45:24] for well what is it the resurrection
[45:26] only and thirsting for the rapture amen
[45:30] because there's any anything that god
[45:31] wants wants to see in you and me now
[45:34] it's the hunger and thirst to get out of
[45:36] here
[45:37] amen oh yes
[45:38] but i find that too many too many
[45:40] so-called christians too many so-called
[45:42] believers are too content with this
[45:44] whole world
[45:45] amen oh you're satisfied i'll do this
[45:48] i'll do this i'm doing this and i'm
[45:49] doing that what are you doing for god
[45:51] amen brother i tell you this what does
[45:54] god want us to do god wants us to be
[45:56] hungry and thirsting to get out of here
[45:59] he wants us to be hungry amen why
[46:01] because that's just the same as israel
[46:03] and egypt god came the most he said i
[46:06] have heard the cries of my people
[46:08] amen i have come down to deliver them
[46:11] brother that's why god has been been
[46:13] waiting on all down through the years in
[46:15] every age they cried for luther cried

[46:49] and lord you're waiting on us please
[46:51] don't let us keep you waiting too long
[46:53] amen and i tell you god don't want us to
[46:55] keep him waiting amen

[48:24] greater revelation of god amen and not

[51:14] brother god gave us the faith of the
[51:16] resurrection the faith of the rapture or
[51:19] again oh my lord my lord as our brother
[51:23] jonathan mentioned in his prayer it is
[51:25] finished
[51:27] it is finished
[51:28] brother now that was that was the
[51:31] bridegroom now it's the bride
[51:33] the alpha ministry now the omega
[51:35] ministry praise the lord it is finished
[51:39] amen how many believers finished if they
[51:41] believe it they're really looking out
[51:43] for the resurrection rapture their lives
[51:45] will reflect what they're living for
[51:48] amen oh your testimony is going to be
[51:51] for what god is doing praise the lord
[51:54] hallelujah as luther emphasized oh
[51:56] praise the lord in his testimony
[51:58] witnessing your round of family friends
[52:00] neighbors everywhere oh i'm justified
[52:02] i'm justified i'm justified oh yeah and
[52:05] the church was going to kill him oh yeah
[52:07] because he was putting the emphasis on
[52:08] this not on not on the church not on
[52:11] this and on this religion and so on no
[52:13] brother's the same thing with the bride
[52:15] we're not putting the emphasis on
[52:16] churches not putting themselves on amen
[52:19] on just intellectual doctrine but on the
[52:21] spiritual revelation what god is doing
[52:23] in you and me
[52:25] brother if he's given us any revelation
[52:27] oh yeah justification sanctification yes
[52:29] but he's also given us the revelation
[52:31] that we are the resurrection and the
[52:33] rapture
[52:34] amen
[52:36] amen jesus in luther justified him jesus
[52:39] amen in wesley sanctified him in the
[52:42] pentecostals baptizing with the holy
[52:44] ghost and they experienced god in the
[52:46] gifts but now we got that plus
[52:50] amen now it's the resurrection rapture
[52:53] praise the name of the lord amen as i
[52:56] said that morning noon and night they
[52:58] they dwelt on what god had done and what
[53:00] god was doing in their hearts and souls
[53:02] amen
[53:03] oh yes but brother i pray grace that
[53:05] we're dwelling on what god has done and
[53:07] what god is doing amen and sin in the
[53:10] prophet and the prophet of god
[53:11] highlighted the fact that you know the
[53:13] resurrection was manifested even in his
[53:15] ministry
[53:17] why
[53:17] because these ministers pointing us to
[53:19] the resurrection
[53:21] amen and as he has already said that
[53:23] what god has done what god is doing was
[53:26] to give us rapturing faith
[53:28] oh what god did for luther gave him
[53:30] justification faith
[53:32] you know sanctification faith faith for
[53:34] the gifts of the spirit the baptism of
[53:36] the holy ghost amen but oh brother
[53:39] praise god but now he's coming more and
[53:41] more and more flesh
[53:43] in you and me
[53:44] taking control why because now it's not
[53:47] just to justify it not just to sanctify
[53:49] us amen not just to give us the
[53:51] experience oh hallelujah bring us into a
[53:54] oneness with god yes yet by the baptism
[53:56] of the holy ghost to what for the
[53:58] resurrection

[54:02] this is jesus that i am my father our
[54:04] what
[54:05] amen we've got to recognize that one is
[54:08] with jesus that one is with his word
[54:10] amen and the word was made flesh and the
[54:12] word is made flesh the prophet has
[54:14] highlighted it he said that was
[54:16] that was the word made flesh then to
[54:19] redeem us now the word is made flesh to
[54:20] redeem us again as i said spiritually no
[54:23] physically
[54:24] we're going to be changed god help us
[54:26] amen to believe not religion but to
[54:29] believe
[54:31] what god has done
[54:34] and to believe what god is doing
[54:37] amen
[54:38] brother it's going to influence our
[54:40] lives it's going to influence our
[54:41] actions influence our reactions by the
[54:43] grace of almighty god
[54:45] amen brother is your life reflecting

[55:12] right
[55:13] praise the lord god god's grace to us
[55:15] lord grace to you and me that wonder is
[55:19] control
[55:20] amen not the devil's control
[55:22] amen oh yeah because even even those who
[55:25] are very religious even run the message
[55:27] they're under satan's influence oh yeah
[55:30] they can talk message but what will walk
[55:31] it
[55:33] you're under talking message oh we
[55:35] believe this we believe that thank you
[55:36] lord what you did yeah
[55:38] but you're supposed to be what god is
[55:40] doing
[55:42] yeah
[55:43] amen you're supposed to go there and
[55:45] reflect what god's doing his separation
[55:47] onto his word amen is separation under
[55:49] the promise amen claiming the promise
[55:52] for this hour for this age oh yes
[55:54] brother let's go beyond it i preached it
[55:56] many times before concerning being
[55:58] religious or being spiritual
[56:01] and i've also asked you the question
[56:02] i'll ask you that again uh later this
[56:04] morning
[56:06] concerning who are you
[56:09] who are you
[56:11] and i've i was highlighting the fact
[56:13] going back to the scriptures and showing
[56:15] you the the believer the make-believer
[56:17] the believer the make-believer oh yeah
[56:20] yeah and i said which one are you
[56:22] oh yeah and only that oh this one was
[56:24] religious that one was religious are you
[56:27] adam or eve
[56:29] oh yeah what spirit you got on you
[56:31] what's what's influencing you
[56:33] amen i pray the grace of god that
[56:35] brother we're not being deceived as adam
[56:37] was or not adam but but he
[56:40] oh yeah and like the
[56:42] bible says that adam put himself in sin
[56:45] amen for eve's redemption
[56:49] oh yeah so that adam putting himself in
[56:51] there with eve so that god redeeming
[56:53] adam would redeem her
[56:54] amen as jesus did as god did amen put
[56:58] himself in sin for us
[57:00] amen and of course he redeemed us amen
[57:03] through the death burial and
[57:04] resurrection
[57:06] brother sister it is tremendous
[57:08] let's see amen that's not just going out
[57:10] there intellectually i know god's not a
[57:13] prophet i believe he did this he
[57:14] believed he did that amen but brother is
[57:17] it in you is it controlling you
[57:19] is it controlling your thoughts is it or
[57:21] does it has it giving you the faith
[57:24] that god has ordained for it to give us
[57:27] in these last days
[57:28] amen brother because we know that that
[57:31] faith is going to get less and less and
[57:33] less because people are getting more
[57:35] intellectual less spiritual and that's
[57:37] again that's why he said when the son of
[57:39] man comes will he find faith
[57:42] amen is he finding faith in you this
[57:44] morning
[57:45] amen the faith that he has ordained for
[57:47] us to have in these last days brother by
[57:50] grace are we saved through faith
[57:53] amen
[57:54] amen it's not just grace
[57:56] it's faith
[57:58] amen grace is there to give you the
[58:00] faith that you need amen but think
[58:03] people think of wines i'm saved amen
[58:05] it's the grace of god i say grace grace

[58:18] the will of god the word of god amen
[58:21] praise the lord and brother amen if it's
[58:24] truly god's revelation not the devil if
[58:27] it's god's revelation in the scriptures

[58:51] redeemed it's finished
[58:53] he said it is space
[58:55] brother grace of god to have that faith
[58:57] that our all mind
[58:59] that what what god has required of us
[59:01] here in the earth it is finished brother

[59:30] they believed it went on in that revival
[59:32] but again there's there's times when
[59:33] they when they did what they wanted to
[59:35] do it was their will but now it's coming
[59:37] down to absolutely completely the will
[59:39] of god

[1:12:02] amen praise the lord
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:10] amen lord bless you turn with me again
[1:12:12] to a scripture that we read i think in
[1:12:14] the ministry of the word just before we
[1:12:16] went to central
[1:12:17] in chap luke chapter 18.
[1:12:21] news gospel chapter 18
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:31] praise the lord
[1:12:34] and to continue with some thoughts
[1:12:35] concerning end time evangelism
[1:12:38] praise the lord
[1:12:42] and verse 1 says and e
[1:12:45] speak a parable unto them to this end
[1:12:49] that men ought always to pray
[1:12:52] and not to faint
[1:12:55] saying
[1:12:56] there was in a city a judge which feared
[1:12:59] not god neither regarded man
[1:13:02] and there was a widow in that city and
[1:13:04] she came unto him saying
[1:13:07] avenge me of mine adversary
[1:13:10] and he would not for a while
[1:13:12] but afterward he said within himself
[1:13:15] though i fear not god nor regard man
[1:13:20] yet because this widow troubleth me i
[1:13:23] will avenge her
[1:13:24] lest by her continual coming
[1:13:27] she weary me
[1:13:29] and the lord said
[1:13:30] hear what the unjust judge saith
[1:13:34] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[1:13:38] amen
[1:13:40] which cry
[1:13:41] day and night unto him
[1:13:44] though he bear long with them
[1:13:48] i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:13:50] speedily
[1:13:52] nevertheless
[1:13:53] when the son of man cometh
[1:13:55] shall he find
[1:13:57] faith
[1:13:58] on the earth amen
[1:14:01] to believe what god has done and what
[1:14:03] god is doing yes pointing to what he
[1:14:06] will do
[1:14:07] and he spake this parable unto certain
[1:14:10] which trusted in themselves
[1:14:12] that they were righteous
[1:14:14] and despised others
[1:14:18] two two men went up into the temple to
[1:14:20] pray the one a pharisee and the other
[1:14:23] republican
[1:14:24] the pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[1:14:27] himself
[1:14:28] god i thank thee that i am not as other
[1:14:31] men are
[1:14:33] extortioners unjust adulterers or even
[1:14:37] as this publican
[1:14:39] i fast twice in the week
[1:14:42] i give tithes to all of all that i
[1:14:44] possess
[1:14:46] and the publican standing afar off would
[1:14:49] not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[1:14:52] heaven
[1:14:53] but smote upon his breasts saying god be
[1:14:57] merciful to me
[1:14:59] as sinner
[1:15:00] amen he humbled himself
[1:15:03] i tell you this man went down to his
[1:15:06] house justified
[1:15:08] rather than the other for every one that
[1:15:10] exalted himself shall be abased
[1:15:14] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[1:15:16] exalted god bless his words you may be
[1:15:19] seated
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:23] with me to second corinthians chapter
[1:15:25] four
[1:15:28] ii corinthians chapter four
[1:15:33] and all the men already ministered
[1:15:36] well i'll try to maybe narrow it down
[1:15:39] amen the lord bless us
[1:15:42] and again to say that the saints are
[1:15:44] sending greetings to all of you the
[1:15:46] saints we met across the island
[1:15:49] in central and in western newfoundland
[1:15:51] they surely wanted us to say hello to
[1:15:53] everybody
[1:15:54] and uh
[1:15:56] they
[1:15:57] have expressed also a
[1:15:59] appreciation for our brother jonathan's
[1:16:01] ministry
[1:16:02] and they they've been blessed by the
[1:16:04] going forth of the word amen
[1:16:06] but also to encourage our brothers
[1:16:08] our sister there now during the
[1:16:10] recording that a couple of the saints
[1:16:12] have expressed
[1:16:14] that
[1:16:15] they have
[1:16:16] failed in the recording
[1:16:18] it just wasn't coming through right and
[1:16:20] that brother gerald was men started
[1:16:22] ministering but eventually i was jumping
[1:16:25] all around the screen so i don't know
[1:16:27] what the problem is there
[1:16:29] but uh i think it was a couple in
[1:16:31] central in central newfoundland and
[1:16:33] again our brother and sister in western
[1:16:35] newfoundland were expressing
[1:16:37] their concerns and so on so we pray the
[1:16:40] grace of god that he's going to help us
[1:16:42] to
[1:16:43] project it right amen so that they can
[1:16:46] receive it all because they've they've
[1:16:48] had to a number of times to
[1:16:51] shut it down
[1:16:52] and because it was just wasn't working
[1:16:54] right so we pray the grace of god it
[1:16:56] will work right
[1:16:58] and
[1:16:59] as i said the times that they did hear
[1:17:01] it and they did hear our brother
[1:17:03] jonathan minister it was a blessing to
[1:17:04] them and so we and we're asked to pass
[1:17:07] our greetings to our brother jonathan
[1:17:09] and so on and to thank the lord for his
[1:17:11] ministry amen so pray the grace of god
[1:17:15] to us because brother sisters we're in
[1:17:17] the last time
[1:17:20] and brother
[1:17:21] i trust that that none of the hearing of
[1:17:23] the word or the ministry is going to be
[1:17:25] you know just religious and oh i thank
[1:17:27] god
[1:17:28] it was nice brother it's nice yeah but
[1:17:30] we got it's got to become a part of us
[1:17:33] we got to become a part of it amen that
[1:17:35] we're ministering to you
[1:17:37] the word and you are the word amen so
[1:17:40] you can identify with the word praise
[1:17:42] the lord oh that's me that's what god
[1:17:44] has ordained for us in these last days
[1:17:46] that's what god is doing in me that's
[1:17:48] what god is doing through me in these
[1:17:49] last days so lord i pray that you'll
[1:17:51] keep strengthening me and encouraging me
[1:17:53] with the going forth of the word lord
[1:17:55] that i'm going to focus more and more
[1:17:57] and more on what you're doing
[1:17:59] focus more and more lord on on on
[1:18:02] the prophecy thus saith the lord for the
[1:18:05] hour that i'm living that will go forth
[1:18:07] living the word go forth and walk the
[1:18:10] word amen not just talk it let's walk it
[1:18:13] amen so i pray the grace of god to help
[1:18:16] us amen that brother the back in
[1:18:19] luther's day they went forward preaching
[1:18:20] justification wesley went about
[1:18:22] preaching sanctification and as i said
[1:18:25] wesley preached so much and he had so
[1:18:27] many that their the church wasn't big
[1:18:29] enough to receive everybody so there was
[1:18:31] a time when when when martin luther or
[1:18:33] john wesley he would go out into the
[1:18:35] cemetery
[1:18:37] amen and and he would stay he would
[1:18:39] stand up on up on a pulp another pulpit
[1:18:42] but i stand up on a
[1:18:43] what i call it
[1:18:45] yeah the headstones that were in the
[1:18:47] cemetery he find their stone that he
[1:18:48] could stand on and he would get up on
[1:18:50] that headstone and he would preach amen
[1:18:53] and he certainly wasn't preaching to the
[1:18:54] dead
[1:18:55] he was preaching to the to the living
[1:18:57] saints who were all over the graves
[1:18:59] everywhere amen by the grace of god amen
[1:19:03] truly oh my
[1:19:05] oh my we need a revelation that what
[1:19:08] that of the reserve resurrection and the
[1:19:10] rapture by the grace of god amen so i
[1:19:13] pray grace of god that we're going to
[1:19:15] focus on what god is doing amen and
[1:19:18] brother we don't go down just back to
[1:19:21] luther back to wesley back to the
[1:19:22] pentecostals amen or even the first and
[1:19:25] second pool of william branham's
[1:19:27] ministry brother that's what god did was
[1:19:29] god doing the third paul amen and when
[1:19:32] he got into the third pool and the
[1:19:34] revelation of the word god took them
[1:19:36] took william branham off the scene amen
[1:19:38] because it was in the in the latter part
[1:19:40] in december i believe 1963 it was after
[1:19:43] going for the word and he preached a few
[1:19:45] other messages and he said this is
[1:19:47] another revelation of the of the seals
[1:19:50] and so on but then it was finished and
[1:19:53] the lord took him home amen and he said
[1:19:56] at one point there in 1963 he said here
[1:19:59] i go back into evangelism but when he
[1:20:02] reached his 56th birthday in 1965
[1:20:06] he knew his time had come god was going
[1:20:08] to take him
[1:20:10] and he said here i at and when he
[1:20:11] celebrated his 56th birthday he said
[1:20:14] here i stand he said he said see my own
[1:20:16] end now oh yeah he saw his own end
[1:20:19] coming
[1:20:19] and he and god took him home amen
[1:20:22] because now the prophet was taken off
[1:20:24] the scene now god was moving on the
[1:20:26] scene through the ministry amen what for
[1:20:29] to lay in the word to lay in the
[1:20:30] revelation what god had done and what
[1:20:33] god was doing because again the prophet
[1:20:35] of god did say he said you young
[1:20:37] ministers back there in 1965 he said
[1:20:40] you're going to take this message on to
[1:20:42] the coming of the lord amen he knew that
[1:20:45] he wasn't going to do it amen but there
[1:20:47] were there would rise a ministry that
[1:20:49] would do it amen and he said you're
[1:20:51] going to dig he said deeper
[1:20:54] amen into what god had done and what god
[1:20:56] was doing and now and he and he preached
[1:20:58] the other revelations and he preached
[1:21:00] again another revelation of the mystery
[1:21:02] of god and and he he said himself in
[1:21:05] that message and he was nearing the end
[1:21:06] of the message now he said i know he
[1:21:08] says not striking you the way that it
[1:21:10] should and he says not striking me he
[1:21:12] said the way that it should amen why how
[1:21:15] did he know that because why because it
[1:21:17] was ordained to give us resurrection and
[1:21:20] rapturing faith amen but that wasn't the
[1:21:23] hour that they were living in back then
[1:21:25] and that's why it wasn't striking them
[1:21:27] that way he knew it was this he knew it
[1:21:29] was that amen they believed it amen but
[1:21:32] still god wasn't wasn't making it as it
[1:21:34] were flesh in them to bring forth the
[1:21:36] resurrection and rapture no he said it's
[1:21:38] not striking you and he said it's not
[1:21:40] striking me easily the way that it
[1:21:42] should 1965.
[1:21:44] but brother there's another generation
[1:21:47] rising that brother this revelation
[1:21:49] ought to be striking us the way it
[1:21:50] should
[1:21:51] amen and the ministry of the word oh
[1:21:53] yeah thank god for what he did but now
[1:21:56] god is focusing on what he's doing amen
[1:21:59] oh yeah the revelation was back there in
[1:22:01] the ministry of malachi 4 in the first
[1:22:03] poll second book third paul amen but now
[1:22:07] there is there's been a ministry ongoing
[1:22:09] and brother and when really did it start
[1:22:11] when it comes to getting into the word
[1:22:13] when it comes to getting into the
[1:22:14] message not not just preaching the
[1:22:17] message preaching the message no it's to
[1:22:19] get into the message and to get the
[1:22:20] faith that god wants us to have
[1:22:23] and brother when did it start as far as
[1:22:25] i know and looking back over over time
[1:22:27] and not over the years it was around
[1:22:30] 1971 amen around there that god began to
[1:22:34] get the ministry into the word amen not
[1:22:37] just preaching god has sent a prophet
[1:22:39] god has sent a prophet and brother for
[1:22:41] years and years and years that that was
[1:22:44] the basically the ministry to the bride
[1:22:46] that was basically the ministry around
[1:22:47] the world amen god has sent a prophet
[1:22:50] god has sent a prophet amen but then in
[1:22:53] 1971 amen the ministry began to change
[1:22:56] from the prophet to the message amen
[1:22:59] thank god for the prophet but now let's
[1:23:01] get into the message that the prophet
[1:23:03] brought us amen amen why because we need
[1:23:07] it now to give us the faith that pleases
[1:23:09] god praise the name of the sea god i'll
[1:23:12] praise the lord god does it his way
[1:23:15] brother it's not your way not my way and
[1:23:17] there's too many that got into the
[1:23:18] message oh yeah thank god for the
[1:23:19] message thank god for the message amen
[1:23:21] praise the lord brought us out of
[1:23:23] denominations as i said one time as i
[1:23:25] was praying in a church and there was
[1:23:28] another believer kneeling down at the
[1:23:30] altar next to me and then oh lord thank
[1:23:32] you thank you for the message thank you
[1:23:35] for bringing us out of denominations and
[1:23:38] now we don't have to be under any man
[1:23:40] anymore oh i said lord i said they need
[1:23:43] a revelation
[1:23:44] amen because your brother your brother's
[1:23:46] life went under those ministries and you
[1:23:48] brought us under the ministry of the
[1:23:49] bride and then again there was the
[1:23:52] questions and answers in the seals does
[1:23:54] the bride have a ministry and the
[1:23:56] prophet of god said yes yes and he said
[1:23:58] it's been in the bride he said right
[1:24:00] from the beginning amen and he says the
[1:24:03] five full ministry
[1:24:05] oh he said that in the seals yes he did
[1:24:07] because they asked the question in the
[1:24:09] seals and he answered it amen so
[1:24:11] brothers said amen and yet there's too
[1:24:13] many believers on mine they're doing
[1:24:15] this they're doing that to run their own
[1:24:16] way doing their own thing amen not
[1:24:19] subject to any ministry not recognizing
[1:24:21] any ministry brother sister amen without
[1:24:24] the ministry you're going to make it
[1:24:26] without the minister you're not going to
[1:24:27] get the word that is ordained to give us
[1:24:30] the faith that god wants us to have
[1:24:33] and then again there's too many
[1:24:35] believers that are doing their own thing
[1:24:37] amen doing it their own way oh i'm a
[1:24:39] believer oh yeah
[1:24:41] but again oh praise the lord it comes

[1:31:51] for the resurrection the rapture oh my
[1:31:54] grace oh my how many are longing to er
[1:31:57] to get back in fellowship with sister

[1:32:27] this covet issue oh my it's around the
[1:32:30] world
[1:32:32] but still
[1:32:34] the people are just caught up with the
[1:32:36] world
[1:32:37] they're caught up with what's going on
[1:32:38] in the world but i wonder how many

[1:54:20] dreamed the dream and i saw this and i

[1:54:24] the next morning i told it to them to
[1:54:26] the the brother and his wife and as i
[1:54:27] said the sister got up and she moved her
[1:54:30] chair around the corner so that i
[1:54:32] couldn't see her no more and that she
[1:54:33] was just set over the corner around the
[1:54:36] corners
[1:54:37] and just knitting
[1:54:38] and the brother was sitting in a chest
[1:54:40] of hill across from me and i was
[1:54:42] explaining what i seen and so on what i
[1:54:44] experienced

[1:54:48] until
[1:54:50] the day he took me to get the bus
[1:54:53] the public bus back home
[1:54:56] and he said brother

[1:56:02] so brother
[1:56:03] for it all and i've been condemned even
[1:56:05] by certain family members one time
[1:56:07] because i was always fellowshipping with
[1:56:09] these fellowshipping with them
[1:56:11] but
[1:56:12] they were just
[1:56:15] discouraged in a sense that i didn't
[1:56:17] fellowship with them that i will only
[1:56:19] drop in to see them and say hello and
[1:56:21] and so on and see how they were doing
[1:56:23] and then i move on to fellowship with
[1:56:25] the saints
[1:56:26] oh yeah to god be the glory
[1:56:29] brother we're not living for natural
[1:56:31] family we're living for the spiritual
[1:56:33] family

[1:56:36] who are my brothers and sisters
[1:56:38] there's those in the gospel
[1:56:40] that's my brothers and sisters amen
[1:56:44] so brother
[1:56:46] we're always bearing about in the body
[1:56:48] the dying of the lord jesus
[1:56:51] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:56:53] made manifest in our body amen
[1:56:57] brother that christ could take control
[1:57:01] of your spirit and your attitude
[1:57:04] amen
[1:57:07] for we which live are always delivered
[1:57:09] unto death
[1:57:11] for jesus sake amen
[1:57:13] dying to ourselves
[1:57:15] die to the flesh
[1:57:17] amen
[1:57:19] don't be controlled by your thoughts
[1:57:20] your words your deeds naturally just be
[1:57:23] controlled by the holy spirit
[1:57:26] grace
[1:57:30] for he said we which live are always
[1:57:32] delivered unto death for jesus sake
[1:57:35] amen
[1:57:36] what life are you living for jesus sake
[1:57:39] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:57:42] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:57:45] oh praise the lord
[1:57:47] amen who's not you that lives is christ
[1:57:49] living in you
[1:57:51] amen
[1:57:54] so then death worker than us but life in
[1:57:56] you
[1:57:58] paul referring to the ministry
[1:58:00] and we having the same spirit of faith
[1:58:03] according as it is written i believed
[1:58:06] and therefore have i spoken that's right
[1:58:08] amen amen
[1:58:10] praise the lord your life your
[1:58:12] conversation reflects your faith
[1:58:15] we also believe and therefore speak
[1:58:19] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[1:58:21] jesus from the dead
[1:58:23] or raised
[1:58:24] up the lord jesus shall raise up us also
[1:58:28] by jesus
[1:58:29] oh i pray jesus is in control
[1:58:34] jesus is in control of your thoughts
[1:58:36] jesus said control your words and your
[1:58:38] deeds
[1:58:39] so how many can really truly say it's
[1:58:41] not me that lives is christ that liveth
[1:58:44] in me
[1:58:46] soul body and spirit
[1:58:50] amazing
[1:58:55] and again verse 14 knowing that he which
[1:58:57] raised up the lord jesus shall raise up
[1:58:59] us also by jesus and shall present us
[1:59:03] with you
[1:59:04] for all things are for your sakes
[1:59:07] that the abundant grace might through
[1:59:09] the thanksgiving of many
[1:59:11] redound to the glory of god
[1:59:15] amen
[1:59:16] for which cause we faint not
[1:59:18] but though our outward men perish
[1:59:21] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:59:26] oh i pray grace
[1:59:28] amen for our light affliction which is
[1:59:30] but for a moment
[1:59:32] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:59:35] eternal weight of glory
[1:59:38] amen trusting by grace that god has
[1:59:41] control of your life
[1:59:44] your thoughts your words your deeds
[1:59:46] amen
[1:59:49] for our light affliction which is but
[1:59:51] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[1:59:54] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[1:59:56] hallelujah while we look not at the
[2:00:00] things which are seen
[2:00:02] amen but there's too many looking at the
[2:00:04] natural things but not the spiritual
[2:00:07] but at the things which are not seen for
[2:00:10] the things which are seen are temporal
[2:00:12] but the things which are not seen are
[2:00:14] eternal
[2:00:15] so we're not putting our emphasis on the
[2:00:17] natural we're putting our emphasis on
[2:00:18] the spiritual
[2:00:20] by the grace of god amen
[2:00:24] so that god
[2:00:26] by the ministry of evangelism amen is
[2:00:29] taking control
[2:00:31] of us
[2:00:32] amen
[2:00:34] again
[2:00:38] maybe bring it to a close
[2:00:42] again i thought i would finish it here
[2:00:45] concerning these thoughts on end time
[2:00:46] evangelism no
[2:00:49] but let me conclude
[2:00:52] when it comes to the results of
[2:00:53] evangelism in your life
[2:00:56] end time evangelism
[2:00:59] brother their end time evangelism is
[2:01:02] focusing on the redemption of our bodies
[2:01:07] we've amen
[2:01:07] been redeemed in our souls
[2:01:09] but now god is ministering the word
[2:01:11] through the ministry
[2:01:13] for to redeem our bodies
[2:01:15] to amen we believe that jesus laid down
[2:01:17] his life and picked it up again to
[2:01:19] redeem us
[2:01:20] yeah spiritually but now brother god
[2:01:24] wants us to believe
[2:01:25] that he also laid down his life picked
[2:01:27] it up again
[2:01:29] to bring us to
[2:01:30] the redemption of our bodies
[2:01:32] amen
[2:01:35] and brother sufficient has been said to
[2:01:37] help us distinguish between
[2:01:39] beginning evangelism
[2:01:41] middle of the day evangelism ending
[2:01:44] evangelism
[2:01:45] it progressed from prophets into the god
[2:01:47] prophets for the redemption of our souls
[2:01:51] and since the day of pentecost it has
[2:01:53] progressed from the god prophet into the
[2:01:55] church age messengers
[2:01:57] forming
[2:01:58] into the body of the logos word bride
[2:02:01] for the redemption of our bodies
[2:02:05] we believe that he has redeemed us
[2:02:07] spiritually brother now god is
[2:02:10] challenging our faith physically
[2:02:12] are you redeemed physically
[2:02:16] grace
[2:02:19] it's hard to get the people to change
[2:02:21] from the old expectations to the new
[2:02:24] expectations
[2:02:25] and we're not ordained to have lutheran
[2:02:28] methodist pentecostal expectations but
[2:02:31] brother were ordained with bright
[2:02:34] expectations
[2:02:36] the lutherans look for this
[2:02:38] the meth or the
[2:02:40] methodists look for that the
[2:02:41] pentecostals were looking for this but
[2:02:43] what is the bride looking for amen we
[2:02:46] thank god for the other
[2:02:48] but now
[2:02:49] what are we looking for
[2:02:51] what are you living for what expecting
[2:02:53] morning noon and night
[2:02:56] brother
[2:02:58] jesus
[2:03:01] morning noon and night he focused on the
[2:03:03] word of god
[2:03:04] morning noon and night he focused on
[2:03:05] what god was doing
[2:03:07] oh yeah the disciples oh what god did
[2:03:10] what god would do well they were they
[2:03:12] they failed to recognize what he was
[2:03:14] doing
[2:03:15] yeah and that's why many misunderstood
[2:03:17] jesus
[2:03:18] because why because too much of the
[2:03:20] ministry is looking back looking forward
[2:03:23] but not not recognizing what was going
[2:03:26] on
[2:03:27] in the ministry of jesus oh yes
[2:03:30] oh god did this god god did that god
[2:03:33] will do this and so on yeah but what's
[2:03:35] he doing
[2:03:39] unfortunately many have lost
[2:03:41] their faith
[2:03:42] because they failed to recognize what
[2:03:44] god was doing
[2:03:46] amen
[2:03:50] and again it says as the bride we don't
[2:03:52] come to the table
[2:03:54] looking for a great meal on
[2:03:56] justification
[2:03:58] we're not looking for a great meal on
[2:04:00] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[2:04:02] ghost and spiritual gifts
[2:04:05] and sometimes we might reach out to get
[2:04:07] a little handful of it but because of
[2:04:09] the type of the evangelism we're hearing
[2:04:12] our expectations are greater
[2:04:14] oh yeah
[2:04:16] we're looking for something greater than
[2:04:17] what they had in previous ages
[2:04:19] amen
[2:04:21] our expectations center on nothing less
[2:04:24] than the second coming of our lord jesus
[2:04:26] christ
[2:04:27] our expectations are focusing on our
[2:04:30] union with him
[2:04:32] amen
[2:04:33] our expectations our faith is focusing
[2:04:36] on the resurrection of the dead in
[2:04:38] christ and the rapture of the living
[2:04:40] saints
[2:04:41] amen if we fail to focus on the mystery
[2:04:44] of these revelations then we're not
[2:04:47] hearing the voice
[2:04:48] of the evening time evangelism
[2:04:51] amen
[2:04:52] evening time evangelism is pointing to
[2:04:55] the resurrection and the rapture
[2:04:57] amen
[2:04:59] grace of god
[2:05:02] remember it is written
[2:05:04] unto them
[2:05:05] unto them that look
[2:05:07] for him
[2:05:08] shall he appear the second time
[2:05:11] without sin unto salvation
[2:05:14] amen
[2:05:16] unto full salvation
[2:05:19] soul body and spirit
[2:05:22] hallelujah amen
[2:05:25] that's a promise he will with full
[2:05:28] salvation
[2:05:29] appear to those who are eagerly and
[2:05:32] constantly looking for him
[2:05:35] and how do we look for him to appear we
[2:05:37] look in the word and watch as god
[2:05:39] interprets the promise of his appearing
[2:05:42] god interprets the promise of his coming
[2:05:45] by bringing it to pass in our day amen
[2:05:48] and brother what god has done is a
[2:05:50] revelation of his appearing and coming
[2:05:53] amen
[2:05:55] for the right
[2:05:56] amen he came to redeem the bride now
[2:05:58] he's come for the bright
[2:06:00] amen by the grace of god
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:06] so brother we look in the word and watch
[2:06:08] as god interprets the promise of his
[2:06:10] appearing is coming by bringing it to
[2:06:12] pass in our day the days of the voice of
[2:06:15] the seventh angel declares is appearing
[2:06:18] and is coming for the bright amen
[2:06:22] praise the lord
[2:06:25] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[2:06:28] and his bride has made herself ready
[2:06:31] brother end time evangelism is focusing
[2:06:34] on the marriage of the lamb
[2:06:36] amen
[2:06:37] and the bride making herself ready
[2:06:40] and before she can make herself ready
[2:06:42] she's got to recognize by the scriptures
[2:06:44] that she's the bride spoken off in the
[2:06:47] word
[2:06:48] amen
[2:06:49] recognizing himself in the scriptures
[2:06:52] jesus knew that he was the lamb of god
[2:06:55] sent to redeem the bride
[2:06:57] amen therefore jesus prepared himself
[2:07:00] for sacrifice
[2:07:02] the bride
[2:07:03] recognizing who she is is preparing
[2:07:05] herself for the resurrection
[2:07:07] and the rapture
[2:07:09] amen
[2:07:14] finish with these this thought
[2:07:18] evening time evangelism is showing the
[2:07:20] bride oh she is
[2:07:22] a man
[2:07:24] you are the bride of the lord jesus
[2:07:26] christ
[2:07:27] you are making yourself ready by lining
[2:07:31] up with the word
[2:07:32] and you are personally uniting in an
[2:07:36] intimate relationship with jesus
[2:07:38] and you are looking with great
[2:07:40] expectations
[2:07:42] to gather with the saints of all ages
[2:07:45] for the marriage supper
[2:07:47] of the lamb
[2:07:50] as the bride you are living for jesus
[2:07:52] christ not your wife
[2:07:55] not your husband not your
[2:07:58] natural family
[2:07:59] not your job but you're living for jesus
[2:08:02] amen
[2:08:04] and pleading the token
[2:08:05] for your family pleading the token for
[2:08:08] your friends your neighbors but living
[2:08:10] for jesus
[2:08:12] amen
[2:08:13] the bright men bride members not able to
[2:08:16] enter into this will go by way of the
[2:08:18] grave amen
[2:08:20] well the prophet of god said that after
[2:08:23] his going
[2:08:24] most of us most of the old people he
[2:08:26] said lived in that day he said they're
[2:08:28] going to are all the old people he told
[2:08:30] brother lee vale he said they're going
[2:08:32] to go by way of the grave
[2:08:34] he said because they won't
[2:08:36] they won't
[2:08:37] have that
[2:08:39] resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:08:41] so oh yeah
[2:08:43] they're they're going by way of degree
[2:08:45] god honoring their faith to take them
[2:08:46] into that dimension
[2:08:48] but there's gonna god is gonna raise up
[2:08:50] a bride that will have that faith for
[2:08:53] the resurrection the faith for the
[2:08:55] rapture to save the faith that jesus had
[2:08:58] to lay down his life and pick it up
[2:09:00] again
[2:09:01] well we laid on our lives
[2:09:03] for the lord
[2:09:05] amen and we pick up a spiritual life by
[2:09:07] the grace of god
[2:09:10] amen we are living as the prophet of god
[2:09:13] said we are living in a changing
[2:09:16] time so i pray grace
[2:09:19] that our lives reflect the change
[2:09:22] amen that god is working in the right
[2:09:26] from time to eternity
[2:09:30] so let me ask you again
[2:09:35] these questions
[2:09:37] who
[2:09:38] who are you
[2:09:41] are you adam
[2:09:44] or are you eve
[2:09:47] are you able
[2:09:49] or are you cain
[2:09:51] oh yeah they're both religious
[2:09:54] yeah
[2:09:56] and look at the
[2:09:57] the sacrifice that that cain made and
[2:09:59] look at the sacrifice that abel made
[2:10:03] amen see one was religious genuine
[2:10:04] spiritual
[2:10:06] just think
[2:10:08] cain made a religious sacrifice
[2:10:12] but abel made a spiritual one
[2:10:14] what
[2:10:16] my
[2:10:17] look at the difference between cain's
[2:10:19] sacrifice and abel's
[2:10:22] oh cain sacrificed all the natural
[2:10:24] things of life that he went and he grew
[2:10:26] this and he grew this he did this did
[2:10:28] this and he put that on the altar for
[2:10:29] the lord
[2:10:30] well what did abel do people went out
[2:10:33] and he was looking after he was he was
[2:10:35] keeping sheep looking after sheep and he
[2:10:37] went got the lamb laid the lamb down and
[2:10:39] killed it and
[2:10:41] sliced its neck and so on and all the
[2:10:43] blood came out
[2:10:47] abel
[2:10:48] what in the world you do that for
[2:10:50] you killed the lamb
[2:10:52] shed his blood
[2:10:54] wouldn't didn't you why didn't you offer
[2:10:56] the lord this offer the lord that no
[2:10:59] well able knew
[2:11:00] he had a spiritual revelation he had a
[2:11:02] faith
[2:11:03] it was by grace through faith
[2:11:06] that abel was
[2:11:08] saved amen
[2:11:11] but it's hard to believe oh that was his
[2:11:13] faith that was his faith what cain had
[2:11:15] faith kate did cain did this oh yes he
[2:11:18] believed in god
[2:11:20] oh yeah again that's why the prophet god
[2:11:22] warned us concerning believers
[2:11:25] make believers and unbelievers
[2:11:28] he said there's three kinds of believers
[2:11:31] again that's why i explained to that
[2:11:33] brother that the gentleman that emailed
[2:11:35] me and told me that he read the bible
[2:11:37] three times and he didn't believe it
[2:11:39] he said oh he said there's this there's
[2:11:41] this there's so many mistakes in the
[2:11:42] bible and that
[2:11:44] and i said brother i said there's
[2:11:46] something you failed to understand when
[2:11:48] you read the bible
[2:11:49] i said god i said it wrote it in such a
[2:11:52] way
[2:11:53] i said so as to give the faith to the
[2:11:55] true believer amen
[2:11:57] i said to cause the
[2:11:59] make believer to stumble
[2:12:01] and i said to cause the unbeliever to
[2:12:03] walk away
[2:12:04] oh i said god did this god did that i
[2:12:06] said to bring out the spirit that's in
[2:12:09] the human right
[2:12:10] god did it to bring the spirits in you
[2:12:12] so do you have the faith
[2:12:14] amen to believe god stay with god
[2:12:16] believe his word and so on or is it just
[2:12:19] a make-believer that you'll go so far
[2:12:21] uh yeah well i don't think i don't think
[2:12:23] that's necessary i don't think god would
[2:12:25] want to worry about that no no okay yes
[2:12:28] lord i believe that there no you gotta
[2:12:30] believe it from genesis to revelation
[2:12:32] alpha and omega
[2:12:34] now
[2:12:36] brother sister god have mercy on us
[2:12:40] so are we are we
[2:12:42] with adam's spirit or eve spirit
[2:12:46] yeah
[2:12:47] we could explain that and go on and on
[2:12:49] for another few hours to explain
[2:12:52] the spirit
[2:12:53] that adam ahead
[2:12:55] versus the spirit that even
[2:12:58] yeah
[2:12:59] well see adam had a greater revelation
[2:13:00] than eve
[2:13:02] oh yeah and that he put himself in sin
[2:13:06] knowing what he was doing what for so
[2:13:08] that god redeeming him would redeem eve
[2:13:12] oh my praise the lord god redeeming you
[2:13:15] is going to redeem this one and that
[2:13:17] because you're there to plead to plead
[2:13:19] the blood of jesus for your family
[2:13:21] friends and neighbors
[2:13:22] oh yeah plead the grace of god for
[2:13:24] family friends and neighbors
[2:13:26] and let's understand again
[2:13:28] that brother who earth those who are
[2:13:31] saved
[2:13:32] are those who have a right attitude and
[2:13:34] a right spirit
[2:13:35] oh yeah
[2:13:38] and brother but then god requires more
[2:13:41] of the bride more of the elect more of
[2:13:43] the chosen
[2:13:44] to believe this to believe this to
[2:13:45] believe that but brother actually one
[2:13:47] thing god does require is a right
[2:13:49] attitude
[2:13:50] and a right spirit
[2:13:52] and there are people out there
[2:13:54] oh but god sees the heart
[2:13:57] oh we think that was nice that was nice
[2:13:59] that was nice but god looks down into
[2:14:00] the heart
[2:14:01] oh
[2:14:03] he knows the heart is not right
[2:14:06] yep
[2:14:07] the attitude in their heart he knows
[2:14:10] so are you adam or eve are you able or
[2:14:13] cain
[2:14:16] what is your sacrifice
[2:14:18] what are you putting the emphasis on
[2:14:20] cain the natural things of life but evil
[2:14:22] the spiritual
[2:14:26] are you enoch
[2:14:28] or noah
[2:14:31] oh
[2:14:32] surely it'd be good if we're noah
[2:14:35] yes but be better if you're enoch
[2:14:38] because enoch was raptured
[2:14:41] enoch was not he walked with god and was
[2:14:44] not because god took him
[2:14:46] praise the lord
[2:14:47] amen
[2:14:49] so are you abraham or lot
[2:14:52] hmm
[2:14:54] as you're putting yourself first
[2:14:56] and your own desires because god
[2:14:58] delivered because of abraham's prayer
[2:15:00] god delivered lot out of sodom and
[2:15:02] gomorrah but told him to go here but no
[2:15:05] he didn't want to go there he said lord
[2:15:07] let me go here
[2:15:08] so god let him go on up there
[2:15:11] yeah
[2:15:13] he got he got into sin
[2:15:16] more and more oh yeah with his family
[2:15:20] show every abram just stay with the word
[2:15:23] stay with the lord believe god stay with
[2:15:26] it

[2:16:24] he says i want you to decide which one
[2:16:26] you are
[2:16:28] could no doubt the prouder god knew that
