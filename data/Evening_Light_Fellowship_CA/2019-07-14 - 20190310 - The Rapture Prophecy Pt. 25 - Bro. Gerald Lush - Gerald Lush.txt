sick the past three weeks and I thought I was over it and then I kind of plunged down again and got pretty sick and you guys know my grandfather is a prayer warrior and I I try not to depend on him because I want to pray and have that faith myself and I was really sick of the other way and I was thinking about him and he called me I wasn't gonna call him he called me when I answered he immediately started rebuking the devil you know I was sick I think my family told them but um and I just heard a ball and I said I was just thinking about you and he called me and so he he prayed with me I had a coffin was feelin sick all day and that nausea left me immediately but I was still coughing really hard night I can ask Paul I've kept him up a lot at night but I felt like I couldn't take a breath I was coughing so hard and so I was laying in bed and I leaned over to text him and he called me again I hadn't even texted him yet and he called me and he started crying and he said that for the past hour this was an hour later he said for the past hour that the Lord had been pressing it on his heart and he pushed it away and the Lord would press it on his heart and he would push it away and he said the Lord told me to tell you though say Lord Jesus Christ makes you well and after that my cough left and so this song came on my heart the next day and I really wanted to sing it I was listening to brother Burley Williams and he was saying that when you testify a trial hits you right after to test your faith and today I'm coughing a lot more than I have but I'm gonna sing it anyway because I was gonna sing it Wednesday and Church got cancelled and I wasn't gonna sing it today because I hadn't practiced but I felt really pressed to sing it so it may not be one for the CDs dad but I'm gonna sing it anyway I think all of you know it so just join with me cuz it's just a testimony it said it's to worship Him and I asked my grandfather cuz I was feeling pretty low that night I said how do you pray the way that you do God hears them every time I said how do you do it cuz I had been prayin all day and nothing came to me until he called me and prayed for me and he said honey I just believe it's as simple as I just believe and he said that God told him a long time ago that if he would pray for people that God would heal them and I believe that that he started quoting scripture to me and it's all Scripture that we know if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover and my name they will cast out devils that he's quoted all those scriptures and they're for us too and I want to be as much consecrated to the Lord and in tune with the Lord as my grandfather is because that's not just for him that's for all of us so this is the song is just to praise the Lord and you'll have to excuse me if I cry through it or anything but you guys sing with me if you would cuz it's um we all know it I am fine oh Lord I have heard thy voice and it told I love to me but I long to rise in the faith and be clothed third run to the draw me nearer nearer blessed Lord to the cross where thou hast draw me nearer nearer blessed to thy precious bleeding side consecrate beef no to thy service by

[Music] like me amen praise the Lord god bless yes it's lesbian prayer for they're going for the word thank God for the specials thank God for our brothers prayer amen thank God for the moving of the Spirit because without the Holy Ghost it's all in vain we thank God for that anointing of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord we need it not just in our singing and in the music we do but we need it yesterday going further the word but we need it in everyday living by the grace of Almighty God so I pray that grace in our lives that we've got an experience with God not just in our heads but we've got an experience with God in our hearts and we fellowship with God on the inside of the inside a man ie box with me and talks with me by the grace of God how many are conscious of God conscious of Jesus and in your home I mean they're conscious of Jesus and your jobs in your school a mad how many are conscious of Jesus when you're just with friends a man I tell you this if you're born again you never forget Jesus that's the truth and I have seen it you know the the false anointings and all of that and I remember one time I'll never forget it and in when I was attending the Pentecostal church and oh you know the people would praise God worship God those that didn't experience and intensify and when you when they testified you heard them when they says divided you know what they were saying but there was one brother there I noticed I said Lord I said II professing to be saved but where's the anointing in May because he was so quiet when it comes to singing he was so quiet when it comes to responding to the word he was so quiet in in just worship period when people worship he was English personally but he was it wasn't far away and it was just a mumbling and but this was the first and last time I went to hockey in in the stadium it's gone now but the building is there I think but it's used for something else and well this brother some brother would you go I'd like to go there I say okay I'll see I'll see what it's like and I never went after and but I noticed that this brother was about three seats or four-season if in front of me well I'll tell you this there was no problem to here oh he was really excited he was really into the end of the hockey game and he was screaming and shouting there was times he would stand up on his feet because he was so so excited and so glad that maybe is favorite team or his team was winning I said Lord I said he got the anointing here he got the spirit here where where is it in the church hey man and there's a lot of people like that they're very active when it comes to out there in the world but the not so active when it comes to the church and the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ well he ought to be more exciting a man and a greater blessing than what's going on in that world over there a man so the grace of God help us something is listening Saints ever an hour we should have it we should have it now a man but we're going to see it less and less and less because people are getting out of the Spirit the Holy Spirit and to get into the spirit more more the spirit of the world that's the truth and I guess a then I just that brother excited over that honky tonk a game but and not excited in church by there was many many others that are excited over anything that's going on in the world amen oh I pray grace it shows what shows are not born again but you're born again you're giving the pre evidence to Jesus amen brother it's serious again this is why their prophecies are going to be surprised who made it who didn't make it amen so the grace of God be with us as we go into the word and trying to conclude the message on the rapture we'll see what the Lord will do and but just to highlight some things that I have said before and I have made reference to it even just recently only to discover that the world is also being highlighted with these fact the prophet of God told us 50 60 years ago concerning the as I mentioned the brother that asked a prophet are there is there anyone else in the universe other than other than us on the earth and the Providence say back then almost 60 years ago he said well he said brother he said we we I think we'd be foolish to think were the only ones there are others are there as well he said well I think there was a science magazine in an in a grocery store of the week and and science was highlighting the fact that we are not the only ones in the universe as science is only now discovering it they thought it was only the earth they thought it was this universe whether it's discovering that there are others they believe with all their hearts they believe with all their knowledge that there are others in the universe amen and their eye lighting that so brother we know were in the end when all these things are coming out whether it came out for you and me the revelation by the Holy Ghost but now they're they're there with their knowledge that's getting into it and the prophet of God said they will get so close he said he said buddy God is going to stop it before they do he said that they could break into eternity and that's true the knowledge of science and all this technology and everything either getting close to breaking into eternity but he said before they do God is going to shut it down a man that is the truth so do brother I I've seen it you know and then when it comes to all these different magazines there and all my more and more it vindicates what God has done and it vindicates what God is doing because again it's not just a Christian that knows that the devil knows a man he does eat any and he knows he got his time is short so how many believers really feel that we have a short time you know and because of what God has done and what God is doing science would rise in judgment against a lot of believers and right because there's the effect on them a greater effect on them their knowledge then the Holy Ghost revelation has on many a believer and many a Christian so I pray the grace of God help us brother it's late so God see God requires something of you not just for you to say I believe this I believe that you know when it comes to walking in the spirit is more than saying I believe the devil does to a man you know I'm this and I'm that no no no you got to have more than that amen see what God is looking for is not just the knowledge of Jesus in you it's the it's the life of Jesus a man it is the token life of the blood of Jesus that has come back to you amen not just Lord I believe the later of the word as I already highlighted the quote with a promise of what we need is the dynamics amen it not not the road now the mechanics but the dynamics of the word brother to get into that we're going to have to dig deeper as the Prophet said right here just keep praying keep digging and he said don't stop and he said dig ditches out there and when you get down you hit an old tin can I'm to Todd's say I'm too tired throw it out of the way and keep digging just keep digging because we got to dig there many are digging into the world the things of the world the foolishness of the world that how many are digging into the revelation of God a man and I just taking the form of godliness and religion and being a churchgoer but your your yearning your perfect representation of a son and daughter of God amen and remember he said if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start digging amen and in the tribulation a brother it's the spirit of it is already on the earth a man knows that I I'm preaching to myself there he said I'm going to start digging deeper than I ever dug because I feel like the nation around the world that this ministry will again as it is known now about everywhere over the world and it and it has gone around the world a man so I pray God that by the grace of God that were closer to the rapture amen and the reality of it in our hearts and in our souls there with me in it again I don't know if you read it some of you do but when it comes to the devotionals by our brother Tim Dodd and the the devotional on March the 4th was very highlighting a man that God's requiring more of just church-going God's requiring more sometimes even of prayer and you know yes you can pray but there's many of their prayed but but again cause requiring the life he's requiring Christ made flesh in you and he said no matter and he said how much that you pray you'll never be forgiven until you believe you're forgiven you gotta exercise your faith a man then you confess that you are then live like you are forgiven amen and he said and and no one will still know no matter how much you cry how much you pray how much you shout how many times you speak with tongues or whatever you do you're still not until the fruits of the spirit bear record in you a mate because by their fruits you shall know them a man by the grace of God sews diantha and it goes beyond just going to church oh yes there's a life there's an attitude there's a spirit a man there's an anointing on you morning new tonight a man you just if you're born again you're a new creature a man you're born again its Christ in you if you're born again it's just the word and say it's God it's God's plan and it's god that's all you're cut off with amen and people may wonder say why there you're not interested in this not interested in and you know I'm I'm getting out of here a man you're if you want it you can stay he meant but I I'm leaving it all behind by the grace of Almighty God so god help us brother is my prayer father it may be because by the grace of God if we're looking for a rapture we've got to be living in expectation of it 24 hours a day oh yeah as I said you know a Luther just talked just Legation morning to the night and and the others what God revealed to them they talked at morning new tonight Pentecost this morning noon and night and as I told you about the old fashioned Salvation Army that the officer missed somebody on down the road and just laid his hands on him and prayed for them a man not many would do that not this day and age no no no it would bear that reproach but I pray the grace of God help us to be spiritual amen the world would think oh you're a fanatic good we need to be a man we certainly need to be more fanatical than we are cut off in to the revelation that we are being a being the witness that God is required of us amen so that we are reflecting Jesus now morning noon and night oh there in the world among family among friends a mayor oh yes they'll recognize that is Jesus that is that you're a Christian you're different from the from the rest a man so the grace of God brother be with us to help us it's my prayer and just to I like that the Lord willing I was hoping to be able to get our brother Mark to minister on a and exhort us on maybe on a Wednesday Wednesday if he if he can do that event as the Lord leaves and then we're also going to get our brother Alec also because and brother Holly give me some quote or scriptures and [Music] it's a lot of scriptures it's all scripture a man and concerning the believers walk and it's not just the believers talk if the believers walk a man and the scriptures highlight the believers walk why because we got to we got to not come into the light we got to walk in the light amen and I just come in there round and we round the anointing and the spirit we got a walk in the spirit amen by the grace of God not the spirit of the world but you got to walk in the Holy Spirit amen and that's why there's so few that they got that anointing on them got that conversation and you know in them and that spirit why because they don't have the Holy Spirit you repent get baptized and every and have you really got faith God gives you the Holy Ghost oh yeah God gives you the Holy Ghost amen and oh and he's in control and he's the one he's the one that's praising the Lord he's the one that's worse for me amen hallelujah that anointing brings out that praise and worship every man is giving Christ the leadership not my will father thy be done sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God so Lord willing I'll get some copies of this of these scriptures concerning the believers walk amen because unfortunately there's there's many don't consider the walk there's a there's a there's talk but they don't consider the law amen so I pray grace help us the Lord bless you let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible [Music]

[Music] [Music] Hey [Music] a man praise the lord god bless you come with me to Matthew chapter 24 and we read just four verses in Matthew chapter 24 a man let's give attention to the Lord a man because he's the one we come to worship and we come to hear his word praise the name of the Lord we want Jesus to speak to us today amen maybe you'll touch on something that that you know about iNOS about no maybe nobody else knows about but he does so let's say or the Word of God it seemed we gotta be personal very personal it's God that worketh in me willing to do of his good pleasure I pray grace grace in Matthew chapter 24 and verse 1 and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show the disciples or came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them seeing not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down a man and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world we're there and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name see how close it's going to be many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many god bless his words you may be seated let's go with me to verse 42 of Matthew 24 and Saints another article choose a magazine that's in the inn it was in a grocery store and they got an article on the best and book in the world and it's the Bible it's just a regular Megas type magazine and there were no warning about the Bible why is it the best book in the world and a very mysterious how was it written you know why was it written where did they get all this information and these things and so they're there they take to almost the entire magazine and discuss the Bible a man and they I like this in the Bible and that in the Bible something else in the Bible well where where did man get these ideas that's what they're wondering about say but again we know it's God praise the name of the Lord in Matthew 24 again and verse 42 Jesus and the disciples concerning is coming and brother's sister he said there shall not be left here one stone upon another and I'll tell you this that I got the pictures of course when we were in Israel and we got our brother George Smith and I and a brother Andrew Moin an Indian brother from India and originally and he's East there he's on one end but the George is on the other end and and you see the the lamp and the size of one block of stone in the original foundation of the temple of the original temple yeah it's absolutely amazing the size of one block but he said they're coming in an hour when there won't be left here one stone upon another and speaking with a Jew concerning that prophecy speaking with a Jew concerning what's going to happen on on that on that mountain because because the we know the Muslims got there's their their church their and so on and he said well listen brother it's like this he said it won't take much for God he said just ISA just to move that old thing and it'll be gone he said one of these days there's gonna be an earthquake strike and he said that all be gone a man and there won't be won't left there one stone about another he man whether the Jewish one on the bottom or whether it's the Muslim one on the top it's oh it's going to be gone and the prophet of God in this hour in this age he did say that there's coming up there's coming an earthquake hallelujah praise the name of the Lord was coming an earthquake in Israel and he said it is going to separate he said the north from the south praise the Lord and he would interview Brett made reference to the to the New Jerusalem and he said the New Jerusalem is none up there he says that's the bride she typed the New Jerusalem a man but he said the New Jerusalem itself he says gonna come because people thought it was going to be in jeffersonville people thought it was going to be snow 1,500 miles this way 1,500 miles that way the only going going from Jeffersonville oh no no no he said it's going to be in Israel and he said there's going to be a tremendous earthquake and he said the city is going to come up praise the name of the Lord and he said God's going to going to separate the mountains there and he said we'll go north it'll go south and he said finally this great city comes up and it'll be 1,500 miles a man praise the name of the Lord and that's the one that the bride and the bridegroom is going to be in a man and it's gonna gonna Iranian by grace so I pray God Alva's and then no wonder there's dirt there a mace over this word there are maize over the things that are written there you know because they don't have revelation but to them it's a mystery but to us is the Rizla is revealed amen because we recognize God we recognize the plan of God the purpose of God and the pattern of God and that's what they're trying to figure out in that magazine why this why that and and they highlight this character and that character the I laid this profit of that profit a man then they come down to the who and the world they said is Matthew Mark Luke and John and and so on they said they said this they said this they said that and so on so that they're absolutely amazed but again what is it it is is that fulfilling the prophecy that the word is going to all the world it is fulfilling the prophecy that the whole world is going to bear witness going to hear about God and about his word a man now he said we King we're not going to get to everybody with this message but I tell you this God God God got the gun all in his plan that in there they're going to know about God they're gonna know about his word because he's gonna bear witness of the truth and he's gonna be a winner and of their witness of him amen so the world's gonna be without excuse brother because they're not because I testified to them or you testify to them but because that God testified to them God lated on this man's heart God laid on their hearts God laid on their arts and the ending winner that published this and they published that and they when they said this and they say there may be on on radio maybe on television maybe on the Internet see oh my hallelujah God uses that at all for his glory for the glory of God's for the there's not gonna be anybody without a witness of God without a testimony of God without a witness of the Word of God a man and again brother buddy when it comes to you and me with brother don't don't expect don't condemn them because they don't believe what you and I believe because what you and I believe was predestinated foreordained before the foundation of the world for the elect of God it is say many are called for the few that are chosen a man for the Bride of Christ down and down through the ages a man but again we just leave the others in the in Gaza and well yeah we're going we're going to be there and like in the judgment and then this one and that one is gonna be given away robe and the others are gonna be cast into the lake of fire and I just have their part in the lake of fire but they have their time in the lake of fire because that we know that is not going to be eternal because it is the second death a mayor it is the second death but a game by the grace of God God as God has given us the eternal life so the worth we're not gonna be affected by the second death and then there's come in a day in an hour when we when Christ and the bride are yeah it's gonna be given this one in this one in this one way robes a main because of their testimony and their faith in God remember again the Bible says that the book was open and hallelujah this this book a man it is the Word of God and the books and that is the book of books of their lives a man see the see the attitude of their lives to spirit of their lives the motives of the objections of their lives a man and we will say oh they belong to that church that church well God's looking beyond that into their hearts a million buying others looking beyond us into our hearts and our souls of fear we are bright not just such as men among the many that are called but by the grace of God we're not we're among the few that are chosen and we're among that we're among the very elect a main the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my oh my brother for ages and for four years they that people believe that where God called that's it we're going to go to heaven rest going to hell no no that's in God's hands oh yeah I think I we leave that with the Lord God is righteous God is God is good alright he's not willing that any should perish a man then and like I told that that woman before that I said God is not going to send him to hell I said they choose to go to hell a man they they reject the word they reject this whatever God wants to show them and reveal to them they rejected and and they condemning themselves a man that is that is the truth brother but listen is not going to judge them by what God has revealed to us what is God revealed to them a man so because with us is to give us resurrection and rupturing faint Amy is to give us the faith to recognize the coming of the Lord is to give us the faith for the for the resurrection the rapture the new body and the marriage supper of the Lamb and not all are not all are going to the marriage supper of the Lamb Amen ply trust whether we're going to recognize who we are see see God's requiring a lot more of us than he doing any will of them most definitely but I pray the grace of God elbows brother that we're going we're going to be sincere and true to what God has revealed to us you're going to answer for it oh yeah I know that the life that what God has revealed is that it is going to produce a resurrection and a rapture in faith and it's going to produce a life that got that resurrection are controlled by that resurrection and rapturing faith amen so my God have mercy on us Sara are we just kids controlled you know by this anointing that meant that caused us to go to church and and it caused us to do this and do that oh yeah yeah I'm a Christian so I won't do this and I won't do that I want to have this and I won't have that no God looking for more than that anyway God looking for the resurrection God looking for the rapture God looking for a people sons and daughters a man they got their faith and their living basically their lives are based on their faith resurrection a rapture amen by the grace of God the same you know as I said Luther's life was based on the justification by faith amen oh he was a different man he was a new creature in Christ amen and those that really believed that in the hearts were new creatures in Christ and there's many today there's a few today that I believe it in their hearts but most don't they God has gone on and on now it's coming down to the message of the hour a man there was there were many that believe what God had done what God was doing a man back in their day an hour but rather there there are a few that really believe it now as the truth brother and because there's a lot of people are getting into a doctrine and this doctrine and this doctrine and this revelation that revelation the devil perverting the message the devil is perverting the word and they what to get them off the street in narrow way that's leading to the resurrection and leading to the rapture the change of our bodies so easy is distracting them and the many are going this way many are going that way see it's like when the prophet of God went from Jeffersonville to Tucson and a lot of believers quit their jobs a lot of believers had sold their homes and what they do they moved to Tucson because they believed God was going to do this you know because arrival of God said don't do that don't do that a man see they said they were they were caught up with religion they were caught up with a religious spirit they were caught up with the Ministry of the other prophet and the signs and the wonders a man but they still never follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen because their eras believers are there in Tucson and in 1963 the angel comes down and say in the in the cloud of angels a man comes down and any men he noticed that seventh angel and it was attracted to him and what do they say they said go back to Jeffersonville for the old Mia Lord the old me of the seven seals a man so brother or what is one of those believers do did they stay in Tucson some day did they sell the house that moved back to Jefferson Villa Gant see they should follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost and there's many a so-called believer today that's not following the leadership of the oligos in their lives no they they they got an intellectual belief in the message a male I believe the message I believe God did this I believe God did that but brother what's he what's he doing in you what what does he want to accomplish in you what's he expecting in you a man not just come to the what we call a message church no no but it's coming to the message more amore to the word more and more into the revelation of Christ and we get more and more into the revelation of Christ listen Saints hallelujah the revelation of Christ in him is the revelations the faith with the resurrection it is the faith for the rapture amen he said I got power to lay my life down and I've got power to pick it up again now he's got that power that anointing in his bride and she got power to lay down her life and pick it up again a man is Christ in her the hope of glory amen her brother is not following our our feelings religious feelings and so on is following the Holy Ghost leadership amen what does God want me to do what does God want me to say and how does God want me to live and so on where does God want me to live a million then again like I said there are people who have left his church over the years and they moved to this church moving to that church why bigger churches because why because they wanted to hide among the trees of the garden amen as it was in the first Garden of Eden so saying the last Garden of Eden and then there hiding among the trees of the garden amen but not the brain not by any means brother sister so I pray grace in the name of Jesus Alba's that we're going to stay with the word amen and that God is going to find resurrection and RAM stirring faith in us and he's going to find that we're caught up with it and and we just we just can't get it out of our minds he may have any time sometimes that all I'll stand up and I'll say Lord the resurrection the rapture I said I'm looking for it I'm out waiting for it I'm thirsting for Lord I want it I want to get out of here Lord I'll think about this brother and think about that sister I said Lord they're right there they're gone on but as they're right there and so on as old my lord I celibate still live for the resurrection live for the rapture pray for the resurrection pray mother answer hunger and thirst shorten and many of us got that hunger and thirst I Luther head for justification and then I got that hunger thirst that Wesley had for sanctification and how many got the hunger and thirst of the Pentecostals and for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit a made morning noon and night hungry hungry thirsty thirsty a man there was the power of God there was the anointing of the Holy Ghost moving on the earth a man to bring everything to a climax fling bring it everything do it in anybody others are just caught up in religion and God is going to do this God is going to do that yeah but he's gonna do it eat you he's gonna do it in me amen God always did he did it in Logar he did it in the lutheran he did it in the reference he did it in the old-fashioned Salvation Army and other churches and he did it better consoles now he's doing something in you and me by grace ain't 9:00 and alternative show we got the Holy Ghost we're not going to be able to get it out of our mind the devil won't be able to get it out of our minds that ever won't be able to get it away from from from the elect of God but I tell you this the devil he is deceiving a lot of believers and again that's what he said Jesus said there in a in Matthew he said take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many a man they're going to deceive many and he said they'll show great signs and wonders insomuch that ever were possible they should deceive the very elect a mayor and they've had articles of magazine there and there is their day and one is still there now and they bring in about all robbers they bring it about this brother this brother that brother and the last magazine that I saw there this week was one it was a Billy Graham hey man the pastor the pastor of the United States so they're bringing in about him and his ministry and well anyway what was the significance of his ministry a man but as it was in the days of Noah yes but as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah because that was two messengers to Sodom and Gomorrah was Billy Graham and all Roberts a man to Messer's went down the law two messengers have been out there in my my my lord how they're in Sodom and Gomorrah brother and the messages are gone anybody the messages are gone but where's locked but brother I tell you this where is Abraham and Sarah they were the presence of God they were Abraham at the hallelujah Abraham had the revelation that that really they didn't have in Sodom and Gomorrah that lot really never had ever had a revelation of one of those angels it was he was the he was God and Abraham by before they called him Lord a man without a guy got a girl and the sacrifices a man he had the revelation of God here the revelation out of the son of man that had come down to minister to Abraham and remind him of the promise of God amen no he didn't remind them of the promise but to bring it to pass any man he was reminding Abraham of the judgment of struggling tomorrow but it was reminding Abraham of the promise that God had given him years before hallelujah amen they wait a year after year after year until I got to the place where it seemed impossible for for them for good for them to have an avatar why because they were around a hundred years old and so a Jemez amazing grace brother and God let it go on and on and on and on in this hour hey man tell me we feel Oh Lord there's no rapture no resurrection although we believe God anyway we recognize what God has done we recognize what God is doing we recognize the messenger to the bride we recognize the messengers to the to Sodom and Gomorrah where's William Branham or Roberts Billy Graham amen as I say that that brother that wrote that book that professor in the university and he and he did he did I like the fact that it was with a brain of their spirited the revival it wasn't all Robertson at night like most think it wasn't Billy Graham no it was William Branham but but a man it was gone in simplicity any man God in the garden England simplicity even to Abraham but they been recognised God in flesh and the bride has recognized God in flesh today by the grace of God anyway and he revealed to her brain was what was going on in that day an hour concerning him and the promise to him and concerning Sodom and Gomorrah and lot because Abraham was have been looking concerned over a lot as we're concerned over those that are going to be left for the Great Tribulation amen my brother and sister guys got got messengers to prepare them I had messengers and God guide a messenger to prepare the bride for the rapture any man now they are come wind why they are come for the fulfillment amen the grace of God to help us brother a maid to stay with the revelation of the word amen the grace of God to help us to really believe the revelation of the word grace of God to help us brother really believe that what God promised he's doing in you and me he meant and again like any God was talking to Abraham where Sarah or she said attempt me on you hey man the tent I trust this the tent of the reveal word any man well he says she's going to have a child she laughed but a bird didn't think she did a and God and the Lord said devar and what is Sarah laughs a man but shoot she was going to deny it because she felt she you know at her age out of the world can I have a trial amen God was gonna God was gonna young any minute and what we're looking for you and I are looking for this edge we're looking for the anointing that makes us young again Amen hallelujah so that time doesn't have time doesn't have the effect on us that the word does anyway the word is making us young they may praise the name of the Lord hallelujah there's no more old age they gods were going weren't wearing in touch with eternity any man let's believe that brother sister with all of our hearts amen and in verse 42 again so there's so much scripture he said watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come you know not but you'll write if your elect you gonna recognize it and he said know this that if the Goodman of the house had known what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up and he a and here's Christ I lighting about a thief and again you'll find it that's the lorry as he comes as a thief in the night amen but he said you're not children of the night you're children of the day and you're gonna recognize the way it's in the eyes of the world he's a thief he's coming in this hour he's coming in that hour but the bride's gonna recognize him and go with him any man he's going to take them right she's the missing ones by the grace of God and he said therefore be also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh Oh a lot of people looking for Jesus they're looking for the man called Jesus but no it's the son of me it's the revelation of the word made flesh praise the Lord revealed himself through flesh again that's whether probably God said I said I am NOT I said I am a son of man and I say said revealing the son of man hey he has Karen but how many of us are conscious of his presence that's right so that it brings conviction in our hearts our souls our minds our spirits a man and no matter what we're doing oh lord help me and be with me Lord help me keep looking up Jesus a man for the resident looking up for the change science is looking up where's the bride looking up science is looking up and recognizing that there are others in in the universe out there are we looking up oh praise the Lord and recognizing that there are others right there science is recognizing them are we recognizing these that have gone on before us any man brother there's a see sciences breaking into eternity brother how much the bride ought to break into eternity science has seen that what aren't you and I to see we got to get out of the human spirit get into the Holy Spirit hallelujah so the Holy Ghost has got control by the grace of God so it's not me that lives as the resident prayers Christ that liveth in us and so on and ever and again verse 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh and he comes and he's revealed as the son of man other than looking for Jesus to come they're looking for the look see what they're looking for they're looking for the picture of Jesus yeah that's what they're looking for but the bride he's looking for the revelation of the son of man because he came back and he's revealed as the Son of Man down to the church ages the revelation of the word of God a man to be made flesh and now he's revealed in the last hours as son of man but he comes Alleluia hallelujah this coming is as a thief no wonder their wonder derned are amazed about this book a man because you go over in 2 Thessalonians any man what Paul said this is what Matthew said this is what Paul Loney ins he comes in the thief in the night hey man but it but again it were warned we're warned Paul Paul is warning us even even though he's coming as a thief in the night even though that we are not children of the night but other day another load he said be sober and be vigilant hey man this and Jesus expressed the same thing we gotta be sober we gotta vigilant we got to be on our guard amen and if you are the elect of god you're gonna be sober you're gonna be vigilant you gonna be on your guard because Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bodily in flesh and brother he was sober a man he was on his guard he was he was watching this he was watching that amen that a southern wonder why Jesus did this why Jesus did that any man he was mean sober and he was being on his guard because he knew what spirits he was dealing with and brother we had the sober and we had to be on our guard because to know what spirits were dealing with deceit in spirits amen brother sister and like Jesus said I've chose twelve of you and one of yous a demo and brother there and there's Devils around the message that is absolute truth and they're deceiving their seed deceiving the people they're deceiving the people there any man delayed to get the people off track you know they believe that is to believe that all my brothers sister as I've drawn on the board a number of times that God is gods goes right down straight down from time to eternity a man down trip with his word amen but the enemy will cause the people to divert it and go off and go off here and go off there any man well he's great he's grafting in here grafting this limb you've grafted that name ago off and he'll walk he meant yet but once it's the life cord off into that limit the life of the original tree going off into that limb and that's deceiving many but the bride goes on until she brings forth the fruit oh yeah it's like the main one time yeah it was real and then one time went into a certain guard and did this other man there he had he had a tree and we looked at the tree he saw all different kinds of fruit on the tree and he said what what is this he said what kind of a tree is this he always said you want to know what kind of a tree is he look at the top and he said the fruit that went forth on the tongue amen he said these other things that you're seen he said was grafted in anyway grafted in but it was bringing forth different fruit but a man it was drawing on the life drinking the light it was satisfying their hunger for the you know with the life coming out of the original seed that was praying oh thank God for the revelation brother thank God for these I understand this understanding so that we're not deceived a man that we're not good if it is saved by religion no no we're gonna stay with the revelation of the word by the grace of Almighty God just think of that I prefer I pray God that we're not grafted in no no we're an original branch amen because that tree is gonna put for the original branches and the devil is going to graft in branches amen the try to distract the elect on off on that one just track the Elector this one note the electrical to stay in the middle of the road anywhere and bring forth the fruit of the revealed word amen and the fruit of the reveal where is Amen brother goes on for justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now it's the resurrection rapture amen and it's going to go on in the rest of the world and do tribulation don't try to cut down the tree god help us brother God's going to get the fruit brings it out in Matthew 13 there it's absolutely amazing because then it represents seven church ages in all the parables that Jesus was giving any man and any speaks of all the seven mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and the soul and so on from the first age right our down to the last page and brother I got it marked here the first second third form around down to the last and what's happening in the last parable it's the catching its throwing out the net bringing it all in but that's not it it doesn't stop there cool good a duster I seen that oh my understand what's going on now understand that last parable the last part of that panel brother it's the separation yeah oh they bring that they throw the net and they bring them all in oh they're all see they're all but message believers oh no no it's a separation they're going to take out the real fish and lay that aside and they're gonna look at that throw it back into the ocean yeah separation that's why God's do a brother separating the bride onto himself a man and just say that Matt Matthew 13 7 Church ages Matthew 24 is is the seven seals a man Olivia seven seals yes again I got it I lighted here there from the first right on down to the fourth the fifth to sixth and on to the seventh seal in Matthew 24 amen the Prophet I lighted the fact is this all Jesus revealing his mystery down through seven seals in Matthew 24 hallelujah praise the name of the Lord brother God Alba's that will not be deceived a man the grace of God turn with me to Luke chapter 17 I understand one of the Brethren that mentioned it after I finished ministering one time recently not only eight locating concerning evil events and speedily nevertheless when the Son of Man comes will he find faith or belief in the whole body of revealed truth no he's not gonna find very much that I paid no do we believe in the whole body of revealed truth amen sweet Luke chapter 17 and verse wedding and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observations it's a revelation to many are looking they want to see it with the natural eyes whether what's important is what you see what your spiritual eyes not we just see in your head what do you see in your heart a man see some would look at Jesus and first coming and they saw this all this all that others looked at him and just saw him surely he's not he's not the Messiah you know oh yeah you they'd say they say was born this way he was born that way they say this they say that but they never believed it because they had their own ideas about the birth of the Messiah how when we're so on they thought it was this God Elvis brother we're not going to take our ideas regarding the resurrection rapture and the road we're going to take the revelation of the word but I'll tell you what is what is the beginning of the of the resurrection rapture what is it yeah the the climax it's the revelation of the son of man any man as Jesus again told concerning the the Son of Man in Matthew 24 any man now in Luke 18 17 he's again referring to the revelation salamander and the kingdom of God the kingdom of God come in not with observation with you with your natural eyes it is by faith god help us amen and neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you Amen the kingdom of God is within you god of us to recognize it it's Christ in you the hope of glory and it's the hope with expectation of fulfillment amen so should the kingdom of God is within you and he said unto the disciples see the kingdom of God doesn't have an outward show its inward revelation but too many are looking for the outward God out brother it'll come and all these things we made flesh but first it starts in your soul a man and as a thief in the night is taking us on out and we become flesh in a glorified body that the world is not going to recognize the world's not going to see but we're gonna see one another every man brother listen if science is breaking into that other dimension and they're seeing this and seeing that now what about you and I to see by faith god help us and in verse 22 he said either said on to his disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and ye shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here see there go not after them nor follow them for as the Lightning that lighteth out of the one part of under heaven and shine it out of the other part under heaven so shall also the Son of Man be hallelujah and brother is a testimony to the world but they didn't recognize it as I said I got Life magazine and they're testifying of this and they and they're explaining the mystery of it they said it's they thought first it was a plane they said it was just a jet or something that was flying over but they discovered number one there was no jet flew over and number two they said even if it was he said that cloud he said is too high he said for it to leave any any any thing that you could see it was - I they they were giving the the the height of it from the earth and they said - - I for that for anything to exist in that in data in that area yes Life magazine is explaining it the mystery of it and to them and that was in June 1963 and four five months after that after it happened and the end but to them it was still a mystery even in June amen and the prophet of God did to show the people the magazine or highlight the fact that it was on on a bulletin board outside the picture of it that man had taken yeah and he talked and he mentioned the magazine like magazine and what they were saying and like I told you before that on the other side of that page is a rainbow not only that not just a rainbow period is a rainbow at midnight see they had the mystery of the cloud on one side and on the other side it was the mystery of the rainbow at midnight in Mexico they said we don't understand this how did this happen rain what midnight hallelujah a man we're children of the day not on the night we recognize what God has then we recognize what God is doing and the rainbow represented the Covenant a token of the Covenant that God gave it gate to Noah and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man amen as it wasn't days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man - message to Sodom in the days of Noah there was a messenger Amen but hallelujah before we got into the fullness of that well what happened a rapture Enoch was rhetoric god help us brother sister please just give this give him the priests a man for what God has been and what God is doing business tremendous that that it's a it's a message of the world but it's a revelation to you and me we know it any man knowing that takes us back to the best book in the world they meant so he said the days will come when you shall desire to see the days of the Son of Man and you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lighten to that of one part under heaven shine it under the other part under heaven so shall also the Son of Man be in his day brother the whole world saw it but didn't recognize it god help us and he said but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation amen so he suffered many things and was rejected they and one preacher after another come to brother Branham says brother you got to stop preaching this oh yeah you got to stop preaching that don't say that don't say this the people were coming for the signs and wonders but not for the word and for Jesus they were coming for the signs and wonders but not the word any man they wanted Jesus to line up with them exactly Jesus wanted them to line up with him praise the Lord as it was in that day so it is in this hour let's line up with Jesus any man not Jesus lining up with you just to make you religious no no no it's oscillating out with James us together they give us a faith of what Jesus is doing amen what's Jesus focusing on not religion not just a tension of the world get the world to attract it to them and to to him through you no no he wants to hide himself from the world hi from the from the religions of the world and the things of the world oh yeah just think it is Christ I D mean you now the people they know you're a different person but they and they but they don't know why they don't didn't understand the revelation that's Christ in you oh you don't you don't go to church you don't believe it you know and so on well you want me to go you want me to go your church well we'll leave that between you and Lord but there's people out there trying to convert people to brick get them into their church you better be led by the spirit that's right and again this let me maybe the Lord allowed me this to happen so I could explain that when I was doing something down in the basement where I live and in the cage there and I had some things that I wanted to put in my van but I just laid it on somebody I laid it on a person's vehicle that was parked in front of my cage and it was a calendar I received from brother our home and it was a religious calendar spiritual calendar and there was a couple other things too but when I when I finished there I forgot it they left it there and they they found it when they got into the vehicle to go somewhere his wife noticed that she reached out took it in and when they noticed the calendar was religious oh the man said oh he did that to to to convert us if he's just trying to convert us because they knew they know I'm a pastor and they were and they respect my ministry and sister Betty because because we're into the ministry and so on and I didn't know they were thinking that but his wife told me after and I and when I went to see him again to get the to get the calendar back and they get the other things back and I always said I thought you just did that to convert us I said no I said we don't do that I said we leave that between the individual and God all we said so he said if we if we showed up in your church I guess you'd fall out of the pulpit yeah I said maybe really oh yeah and I've seen somebody else too was confessing driving by our church here and going to another Church and and they looked at the church here one time and then looked into the parking lot they said oh my Jerell got a lot of people in there today because they saw so many vehicles parked in front Amen they see it they recognized the church but they don't recognize the word anybody I trust we're here because we recognize the word of God and what God has done and what God is doing amen and that you won't you believe that you're part of what God is doing that you're part of the resurrection you're part of the rapture you have been predestinated and elected to be resurrected raptured a man God is putting us in contact more and more less and less with this this dimension more and more with the other dimension Jesus was he was in contact with that dimension yeah as I said look what he look what happened when he went up but up on them out and Moseley Elijah came to him he was more conscious of them that he was of the disciples a man knowing that he talked about the word the three of the Moses the Elijah and Jesus was talking about the word for that day the word for that hour what was going to happen what was going to come to pass amen they were looking down to Jerusalem and talking about what what Jesus was what God's going to happen to Jesus their brother is he is God talking to you and revealing to you and me what's going to happen to us you don't want to think about it well Jesus thought about it amen he thought about it for the extent that he controlled his life what he did when he did it where he did it he just followed the leadership with the whole ego anybody until I had mentioned before it got to the place where they he wouldn't he wouldn't talk to anybody just he went to and they talked to that woman at the well and he talked to this one that one that the others wouldn't talk to no no the disciples wouldn't talk to that one others wouldn't talk to this one of that one would Jesus did cuz they were they were the seed of God you talk about God hidden and revealed is a visiting but this is Saints where sinners saved by grace hey man we are sinners saved by the grace of the revealed word we're saying saved by the grace of the revelation of the Son of Man amen because it was as a sort of man that he came the god prophet to redeem us Alleluia so he said as it was in the days of Noah he says there number one he said first the Son of man must love suffer many things not few things he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man see son of man son of man son of man but the world in general for the son of God but the son of man is the revelation of the word in flesh hallelujah because he's going to take a bride out of the flesh so he's going to be revealed to her in flesh he's going to identify with her amen he's gonna give her a resurrection a rapture in faith thank God hallelujah God Elvis true believers is the our serious God I literally where we're at that time with the change many times I've said Oh Lord I trust we haven't missed it you better be on your guard so he said even the sotius so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all yeah but what about that does it mean it means that there was no separation there was total mixture marrying giving him marriage doing this doing this there there was no separation on the Lord it was just Noah and his family but the rest were all mixed up that's right god help us brother God calls to God comforts to separation but no they just went and got mixed up the the seed of Cain the seed of Abel and everything got all mixed up that's what it means as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah listen he said likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold Oh going from natural relationships to natural living and the things of the world he that loves the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in him and the oldest focus today that Sanda were on the world and on the things of the world the eat drink bought sold they planted and they build it well that's the world we live how many it's gonna be we'll be satisfied with Jesus testimony and like he said to the disciples why you following me for when I got nowhere to lay my head what about John the Baptist and how he was clothed and the food that he not many that's why there's many are called few are chosen pres the bride we're talking about bride now not just Christians bride totally separate under the Lord totally as in the natural that the bride subject to the husband now that the pilot of Gaza were living in a woman's world and the women never had control in the in the world like she has control today politicians one time to it never a woman that was a politician one man one would never did this never did that no she's just she's just a woman she was a mother she was a wife and so on not today absolutely amazing grace of God as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold and they planted and they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all brother not far away even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed her brother the fire from heaven has fallen and it's destroying the world god help us by grace to recognize the revelation of the Son of Man and through the revelation is giving us the faith that peace is God faith that's taking us out of time and putting us into eternity really sincerely honestly you think different you act different you're just and there's no way that people of the world it's very few will respect you and and and tell us it with you associate with you but most they just can't identify with you and as we go on there be fewer and fewer to be able to identify with us yeah what God has done is to give us an endtime faith Bri the son of man the revelation of the Son of man to give us resurrection and a rapturing faith not a personal faith or belief in God but belief in the whole body of revealed truth the climax of their climax of that revelation for the elect is the resurrection and the rapture not many professing Christians or Messi's believers are being caught up in the faith not many not many are being caught up in the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture they're focusing more and more on this whole world they're there enjoy I tell be honest I'm surprised that the number of believers that are enjoying this world I'm surprised that the non-believers that are that are focusing on the things that you know make them happily happy naturally public spiritual well voting in the heart what about in the soul is there any hunger for any thirst people today are hungry and thirsty for more for the natural things in the air spiritual that's the truth that's the absolute truth not many are being caught up in the faith I thought comment believed us again a confirmation of the end confirmation faith the effects of faith so that you're caught up with with the spiritual with God not with the natural no no no you leave the natural in the hands of God you follow his leadership not my will father time be done yeah so there's not many professing Christians or message believers are being cut up in the faith the revelation of the resurrection of the rapture day and night Martin Luther was rejoicing in the faith the revealed truth day and night John Wesley was rejoicing in the faith the revelation of being sanctified in our Lord Jesus Christ he lived for it he died for it and knowing that at one point in John Wesley's life the government of England came to his house because they had some idea about the money that he was taking in that was being given him and by the way when John Wesley died and they went and searched his house and searched him you know they only found a few pennies or something in his pocket they couldn't understand it where did it all go he gave it to the Lord and the government when they came and he was living and they came to his house and and they they talked to him and they looked around and they said you're John Wesley yes sir yeah you get a lot of money where's where is it well I don't have it and they said well you you you only got this having one bed or one Chesterfield one this one table one chair and you only got one bowl you got one plate one cup where's world what do you done with it all he said why this he said that's all I need he said I don't need one call each only need one plate but this world wants at all they want they want their coverage full and they'll never use it he's like I've been evening one of my sisters-in-law now they're so upset because they got so much there and some of it is from their from their their parents their grandparents the great-grandparents some of it they told that's almost 200 years old so what yeah who wants it Oh family don't want it Tami's not interested no more those things yeah brother they Wesley didn't want this didn't want that he said don't need it why he said cuz I'm just living heir he said not and when I get up he said I'll have something to eat now gwaan don't start preaching seven days a week he preached but today we focus on what we have our worldly possessions we want this we want that and so on ah for crying out loud where's our focus in glory we got us all gonna be burned it's like one time listen it's like when John Wesley was walking down the street one time Oh fill of the filled with the Holy Ghost and and this man was was in front of him and John was hello excuse me always said I don't get out of the way for a fool and John Wesley turned and walked around him he said I always do amen he had he had revelation he wasn't the fool the man was so he said I always do he said I'll excuse me and he walked her out of a man and got out of the way brother god help us brother she why because John Wesley was caught up in the revelation I'm sanctified amen sanctified by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ that aim it wasn't his works it was his faith and brother listen it's not our works it's our faith that's compelling as in the resurrection and in the rapture is our faith do you believe and are you looking for the resurrection are you looking for the rapture it's gonna be a listen it's gonna be a lot better than this old body yeah you young people I pray grace in the name of Jesus you're looking for a new body gosh sister Lydia she's gone nine years old no she'd be more like 19 or 20 years old in that new body yeah and you other sisters here you're gonna be around 19 20 21 years old me mean that new body oh yeah so it's like someone said oh you know certainly evangelist printed in his magazine that sister Barton said brother Byrne said and and and they said all this woman had a vision and she had a dream or whatever and she went here to heaven and and the children were kept here and and the teenagers were kept there and the adults were there and she said all the children were there until they matured and then they went on into another dimension and down till they matured then he went into the dimension with with the others and this evangelist said well he said I don't agree he said all due respect but he said I don't read with the sister and her dream he said I I got to admit though they disagree doctrinally he's I got to admit he said I agree with brother William Branham he put that in his magazine and he said because brother William Branham when he when he went beyond the curtain of time they said his daughter that he buried as a baby he said his daughter was there standing as a young woman and talking to him and he and he gave brother man he putting their portions for brother Browns testimony he said I believe what what brother BAM said he said he's right he said there's no babies in heaven amen that's right you know this one lost the baby that we lost the baby well praise the Lord in glory she's a young woman or he's a young man thank God thank God for the best book in the world but I tell you this it's only and only the elected predestinated see that understand they can catch the revelation that there is a plan there is a purpose but they're trying to in that book magazine they're trying to figure it all out why that's why this that's this where did that all come from we're deported that where did this one get that where does this one get that and so on they didn't understand the plan and the purpose but thank God we had the plan and the purpose listen verse 26 said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of name let's recognize the hour of the Son of man were united with the son of man by the grace of Almighty God the bride and the bridegroom amen he's united as one brother that we have the we have the hunger and thirst that Luther had and we have hallelujah the rejoicing now because we got the revelation and that even that when Martin Luther had Wesley had and day and night the Pentecostals were rejoicing in the faith and they were the revealed truth the revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit oh they walked in it and they lived in it all praise the Lord morning noon and night do we think about the hour we are living and thinking about the resurrection and rapture could happen any minute now the whole body of the revealed truth in this age is a sign that the resurrection and rapture is about to climax all that God did was to give us resurrection and robbery faith it was to bring us into oneness with the son of man amen and giving us the resurrection rapturing faith because the son of man had the faith he said I got power here the word he said I got power oh you can do anything yes he said but I got power to lay my life down and to pick it up again well the bride's got power for the resurrection rapture and the change of the body because it's the son of man and the bride United is one but listen here not long ago when this first astronaut went up he come back and he hadn't seen nothing of God now they're seeing God they're seeing another creature they believe scientists are beginning to believe there is there was a creator science believed beginning to believe now that there's there's a power in control of the universe so is now believing that there's more in the in the universe than just us just think the prophet of God said it years ago and they're just getting to that now amen he said what the astronaut said about he's seen nothing of God he said that even turned ministers around are they gonna go back now based on what science is saying brother that's no salvation in that salvation is in what God said amen praise the Lord and he said education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of rain weeds that's true a lot of message believers are rain weeds education the educational system science civilization is of the devil and he said our civilization is coming on we'll have nothing to do with this civilization he said it's nothing at all it'll be a different civilization and he said more science scientific we get further we go into death and he said they traps to kill so he said this civilization will had to be destroyed because it's of the devil we're going into God's what our civilization that's going to be I want you to do you just think about it take time sit down in meditation and pray and think about the civilization we're going into what it's going to be like you know we're not gonna have this clothes no gray hair no old men and women no young babies and so on just think about civilization the atmosphere what you're going we're gonna be doing something it's gonna be real talk you're gonna talk by the grace of God amen you talk about no one other thoughts there was there was a TV a television show on some years ago and in that show I want to say what it was but there was a couple of creatures that came out of space like they got from space and they didn't have to talk to one another they could communicate by thought now the earthly ones that were with them they had to talk to them for them to understand them but they didn't need but they knew what that what that earthly person people were talking about and they were that's something to do with going to space and all of that that's really meant this man and others and that you were just communicating back and forth thoughts and the others didn't know what they were communicating but we're getting it will communicate when we talk we're getting into the into that dimension just rig that just like that you Shrek travel as the thought oh yeah grace of God he said this civilization would be destroyed because it is of the devil we're going to God civilization and he said we find out in Genesis 4 that Cain's people started civilization Cain's they started building towns cities they said and so forth instruments of music and become insane and the people got further away from God yet religious and when Seth's people came out come on they begin to call on the name of the Lord because Seth oh yes people come on they call on the name of the Lord God sent Seth to replace Cain and we see where they are coming together now and I had the greater Kinetico council and so forth exactly fulfilling what the Bible said they would do they said it was the church not the Bible and the Bible is just a history of what the church did what a sub to lie that is it is a subtle thing of the devil brother but now they're beginning to realize that there's more to it than just the history of the church they said this this this is just too much dirt it's amazing the way it's written and what's written and so this day they said it's it's not not just a history book there's gotta be more to it we don't understand they said but it got any more to it God that God had mercy and he said God is going to judge the church judge the people someday we know that there's a judgement coming well that gentleman is here he's judging the world by his word and what's he going to judge it by he said he was judged by Christ and Christ is the word hallelujah so it's the Word of God that God will judge in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God the Word was made flesh and he'll judge it someday by His Word he said when I was speaking the other night at Shreveport and he said the communion when they killed the sacrificial lamb he said there was to be no leaven among them through the entire seven days no leaven no leaven bread everything had to be on eleven and that represented the seven church ages and he said that we get in the book here and they had to have the unleavened Word of God down to seven ages not mix with the thoughts of man grace brother that we have the on eleven Word of God for this hour and even what is eat today don't try to keep it for tomorrow burn it with fire before the daylight comes for there's a new message coming forth and a new thing and the public are highlighting the fact that everything is going is moving into the rapture the emphasis is the rapture he said you have no but you have noticed this has been a sweeping for twenty years now and there's no organization there never will be this is the end and he said the wheats come back to the wheat again and he said that we come back to its grain the shuck has pulled away from it and the wheat must lay in the presence of the Sun to be ripened and God is as what we're doing now we're laying in the president sunny God is ripening us for the resurrection and the rapture that's right there's nothing left now because the seed that was sown he's at the top what was sown is now at the top Amen so that you got a he's got to reap it he got to cut it down and he's got to let he kind of let let the stock and all the branches and all the limbs dad they got they got a decay but he's gonna he's going to gather the wheat into his garner I trust her that wheat praise the Lord he said don't you know he said the nation's are breaking and Israel is in her homeland and these signs are indicating that we are at the end but there shall be the light about the evening time and he said there will be a light come forth in the evening time when the blackout's and the things are going the way they are look at just now it blacked out and not only that spiritual but there were they were having natural blackouts electrically in America a man it was a typing the spiritual blackout but God was revealing the light of his word there's no blackout a man and it was in this area in this time when the prophet of God preached the rapture message in 1965 he said the Pope he said just come here and he should remember at the Tabernacle he said when you got them tapes I guess all of you take them know that the Lord showed there that day in the tabernacle exactly where those church ages would be and how they would be and I had them drawed it on the board up here them Church ages which you see trotted out in the book and if that only spirit didn't come down in a big pillar of fire and went right back there on he said on the wall and draw them out and they did after brother round finished the church ages the pillar fire came into venom tabernacle and went over and draught it on the wall the church ages amen there they are right there no radiator and the church and and the angel trotted it on the wall but this was all black and the proud of God said he said I put that wait there he said to represent the right amen but he said in in division he said it was all black grace of God brother and it is it is because as the problem brings that out and that our brother Andre brought it out that we are not in the church ages were in the bride age Amen there with me he said just says the Pope started over here he said the moon blacked out a man he said they took pictures the same way was draw tear upon the platform and he's made his trip over here on the 13th he said walked thirteen steps he said serve communion to certain people to a nation that's number thirteen and blackouts coming everywhere don't you see where we're at we are at the end time amen skip some of these things here and he said listen to the church the bride he said the rapture is a revelation it is revealed to her that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation the revelation is faith and you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you and faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham and the church is built upon revelation a man the church goes by what God reveals to her not by what she's getting intellectually but by the Holy Ghost in her heart and soul amen so he's pointing to the rapture everything God did is pointing is giving us resurrection and rapturing faith because that's the climax of this bride age he said the book of the revelation is the last book of the Bible and it's sealed to unbelievers whosoever shall take one word or had one word is part of it take it out of the book of life he said it was altogether given for believers and it opens the book of Revelation and reveals who the author of this entire book is he is to look upon as Alpha and Omega from Genesis to Revelation Jesus Christ the same right straight through and reveals his complete mystery of himself and his plans for his church ages that is to come and will sealed in by seven seals but he said these seven seals was not to be opened revelation 10 until the sounding of the last earthly angel on earth revelation 10 and 7 amen and he said that's the age we are living in and God has what God has come down Christ came down the mighty angel with the rainbow over Zedd came down and through the messenger of revelation 10 he revealed the mystery of the seven seals and was to give the bride rapturing faith I've already shared with you the Revel the the quotes on the seven seals where the bride I'll the the prophet I lighted that it was to give us rapturing faith because that's what God's doing that's what God wants to bring back there's nothing else in this book there's nothing else for the Gentiles at the end of the Gentiles dispensation is the rapture and the Great Tribulation grace that were not here for the Great Tribulation grace that he's taking us out and he is giving us the resurrection and rapture in faith now and if you got it you won't forget it and you got it you won't ignore it you got it you won't be able to get away from it why because God is right there with you the Holy Ghost is right there to make you at the revelation one and you're gone but as many believers God sent a prophet and the mystery of the seals was opened but the reality of it is not in them they got thoughts in their heads but they don't have revelation in their heart he said the revelation is to reveal the truth it is to make it fit with the rest of the scriptures so he said God don't need no one to interpret it he said God is his own interpreter and he interprets it he said by bringing it to pass so he's he bring them the resurrection and rapture the past in your life amen because everything that God has done is all coming down to the resurrection rapture all that God was doing in Luther's day came down to justification by faith sanctification by faith the baptism of the Holy Ghost by faith the gifts of the Spirit by all by faith now it's the rat resurrection of rapture by faith when the bride is being called out are you going to put it it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true and we're living in that day praise be to God he said the revelation of the mystery of himself now he said the rapture is only this rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride if there's not a rapture friends where are we at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a rapture amen he said the bride is the one that's going to be raptured that alone nothing but the bride the elected four known by God from the beginning of the father's spiritual gene it's the bride that's going in the rapture the question is are you bride or just a religious figure I trust that we are bright and they meant and and the evidence of the bride is separation you're separate under the Lord you mean the body of Jesus Christ the bride will be part of his body he was the word and the bride will have to be the word word added to word added to word and he said Luther Wesley Pentecost it's got to be the word on top of word germ on top of germ and he said life on top of life to bring the full stature of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now he said the question is how do we get into that right many say join our congregation one of the ones a certain type of baptism one wants to do this or that one said you must speak with tongues the other said you have to do this this one says that you must dance in the spirit and he said this one says you you you must do this this is this has got a sensation all right and then still it's all wrong how could a man or a woman or a child of God that's born to the Spirit of God deny the word of God you want to neither work definitely not amen Jesus wants the fruit of himself his wife must bring forth the fruit of a kind of children that he is amen bride children word children not denominational amen grace of God to highlight something right here and try to bring it to a conclusion listen to what he said it might cause some to question whether or not he was a problem whether or not it was God he said we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah that's what he said and he said it all the way through time and time and time again I'm defining in the next message or second or third message after he corrected himself he said I said Noah but he saw it meant Enoch with the salmon from the had a first Adam but here he said Noah so I'll just insert Adam in the quote he said find that he not was a seventh from Adam the first Adam which was a type of the church ages and now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh showing that it is the seventh church age that takes the rapture now there is no doubt we're in the seventh church age now it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture and all the other six died Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him God raptured him amen a type of the rest of them dying the end time bride will be called out of the rapturing without death will be called out of the seven churches which are now bearing record of that age amen let's dig in real deep amen how many are digging into the message if you are it's gonna reflect in your life amen so revelation 10 that great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh angels message amen so what God has done was for the purpose to bring it to a climax of the resurrection in the rapture we recognize the theme of Luther's message Westridge message the Pentecostal message do we recognize the theme of the message of Malachi 4 and the revelation of the Son of Man brother is the coming of the son of man for the bride and history and their opening of the seals the mystery of God is to give the bride rapturing faith well I was he giving eruption faith it's going from the beginning to the end and you see in the end you see that God did this God did this to earth he gave them faith faith faith faith no he's at the end he's giving us a resurrection rupturing paint amen praise the Lord God's not just looking for justification faith sanctification faith or the baptism of the Holy Ghost Face you we got a habit and the bright will have it but now he's looking for rapture in faith grace I'll finish in a few moments here he said there was three watches the first watch 9:00 to 12:00 the second 12:00 to 3:00 the third three to six now he said we got three there's three es which is a nine an imperfect number then we come back to the seven for the rapture which will take place I believe between six and seven o'clock or he said six and nine o'clock some morning for the trumpet shall sound Amen the trumpet is sounded I believe that but he mentioned with the trumpet sounding just bear with me here praise the Lord Peola show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen and tehsil that was first Corinthians 15 and in first Thessalonians the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible praise the Lord thank God for the revelation of what he is doing and we pray by grace through faith that we're part of what he's doing that we are on our way to eternity that we are on our way to into the change of our bodies by the grace of God he said three things happen reading that 1st Thessalonians 4 he said a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears Jesus does all three of them he said when he's descending a shout he said it's the message going forth and he said the living bread of life bringing forth the bride amen we are here because of the shout amen and we're entering in to the trumpet for the rapture he said in Amos 3 he said he would do nothing on earth until he revealed at first to his servants the prophets and just as certain as he promised it he'll do it and we have come to the church ages but were promised in the last days Malachi 4 that there would be to return again a prophet in the land and God uses the spirit five time once in Elijah Elijah John the Baptist's he said called out the church the remnant of the Jews five times grace he said Jesus Jes us five if a ith five not letters it's the number of grace a man praise the name of the Lord and he uses the Elijah ministry five times that's the grace of God the Elijah ministry represents deliverance and he said he would send the Prophet raised him up from nowhere and he's to belong to none other situations and speak his word he said call off the scene and God just rugged man of the truth of God amen God has ordained these things to be he must send this the first thing come when he starts descending from heaven is a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together and message comes forth and he said I am trimming time rise trim your lamps watch what happens he said the seventh the sixth the seventh and he said behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamps but its lamp trimming time it's Malachi four time when you come its Luke 17 amen brother let's make sure we got the extra oil to trim our lamps this is why the prophet of God said it's going to take a double portion of the Holy Ghost to get us into the rapture why because the the original portion in our lamps is keeping us going separating us onto the Lord but then comes the hour of the resurrection of the rapture we need that extra L to get in through the door a man that foolish virgin never added that's why she goes through the Great Tribulation but the wise version had the extra oil a man and the foolish virgin came assist give us some of your old Oh so we only got enough for ourselves to get him see it's between you and God do you have rapture in faith a man yeah and that that brother that sister can't share that faith with you God gives us the word to give us all that faith so it's according to its the way you're receiving the word the way you're treating the worst your attitude toward the word amen and I tell you if you've got that faith or you you're short in your attitude your spirit your testimony you're sure you have that faith a man he said the main articles or the main heart of what God has done is the message and so on I'll let the finish with this each there's a shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection calling the dead fourth and he said John 11 that called Lazarus from the grave gave the bride together then the resurrection of the dead to be caught up and he said watch the three things taking place now he's the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of Trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that will be the marriage supper hallelujah he said the lamb suffered with the bride in the sky see the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride and the one that's died back in the other ages were cut up together and we are right there ready now and the only thing the church come he asked to lay before the Sun to ripen oh I pray God we are getting more and more ripe in our faith all the time he said knowing back there under healing and so forth was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is them seven seals open those mysteries showing the things what's happened a man it's giving the bride rapturing faith because the bride knows that's the only thing left to come to pass in the sight of God the bride is justified she never done it in the first place a man standing there married to the virtuous son of God never sinned in the first place she was foreordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous and there's no sin at all the message caused the bride together the voice wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead a man grace of God we have had three witnesses there is a witness we've already had three witnesses in the Old Testament now watch Enoch Elijah Jesus Jesus being the keystone between the old and new Testament he was the keystone that ties two together and he read Matthew 27 and it says and the graves were open and many many of the saints that slept the rose and he said that came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many well brother in this hour there's a resurrection and a rapture but it's going to be as a thief in the night 1 rapturous past and he said there's he's three threes happened in the Old Testament Enoch raptured Elijah raptured jesus raptured he's who watched the Old Testament them Old Testament Saints and he said now when this rapture first taken place notice verse 50 his loud voice awaken the Old Testament Saints just exactly the loud voice awakened Jesus or wake wake Lazarus rather he said the loud voice awakened and the second is fulfilled in think in Thessalonians 4 he said that will be the second rapture will be the catching away of the bright and brother all that God has done is to give us that faith is not just a correct us in this doctrine that doctrine that's something else not yes it that's all part of it but it is there the end result is faith for the rapture when we see what God has done what God is doing giving us wrapping faith oh Lord it's finished it's the end yes it's over get ready look up look up we're going to the marriage supper praise the Lord thank God and he said there's one rap should already pass and we're looking for that last rapture of the Rite of Christ their bridegroom was raptured now the brightest being raptured amen and he talked about his last vision of the elect of God of the bride and what was the last thing he said to her in his last vision stay in light because he did see in the end he saw a couple stepping out of line and that's when he screamed and he said stay in line and there's many getting at a line when it comes to the message and that's why the true ministry is gonna be screaming stay in line he said the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming he said stay in line I wonder could it be already past could the bride already be called and is that what we're going through today she has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word a man thank God Christ is the word he said the bride is a part of the bridegroom the woman is a part of her husband because she's taken out of out of the husband he was part of Adam from his sight and so is the bride not taken from denomination but taken from the bosom of the Word of God for this day he said god bless you it's been spoken it has to come to pass he said and little people no one wants to die no one wants to be lost let me tell you whatever you do I don't care I well you go to church Royal you are to church he said that's fine nothing against that you should go to church you should do that keep on going to church but whatever it is throw away your traditions and move right on up into Christ amen remember we are in the last hours it is it is the time of the resurrection it is the time of the rapture we live in a tremendous day tremendous age what we're not just rejoicing over this this doctrine that doctrine this one but something God is doing just think
