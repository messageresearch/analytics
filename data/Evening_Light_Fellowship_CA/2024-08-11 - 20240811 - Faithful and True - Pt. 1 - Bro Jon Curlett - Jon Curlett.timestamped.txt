[56:17] Lord amen so he's a firecracker he's a
[56:19] real evangelist a young man that's been
[56:21] preaching for quite a while now and
[56:23] we're just trusting the Lord to bring
[56:24] him up and and give a blessing to the

[56:36] expectation amen God bless you Isaiah 55
[56:39] and verse
[56:40] 6 says seek ye the Lord while he may be
[56:44] found call upon him while he is near you
[56:47] know there's a time and a season for
[56:48] God's mercy amen it's it's not all the
[56:51] time but there's a time for it and the
[56:53] time to take it is right now amen the
[56:55] scripture says today is the day of
[56:58] salvation you know they watched Noah's
[57:00] Ministry and they saw that door the ark
[57:01] was open until one day it wasn't and it
[57:04] wasn't Noah that closed it cuz our
[57:06] Humanity we keep it open forever but God
[57:09] has a time and a season and when he says
[57:11] it's open it's open and that's the time
[57:12] to get in and when he closes it it's too
[57:14] late and he can't open it it's done it's
[57:16] a finished work then he says let the
[57:19] wicked forsake his way and the
[57:21] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[57:24] return unto the Lord
[57:27] you know it says return you used to but
[57:30] you're not
[57:31] now he says and he will have mercy upon
[57:34] Him Praise the Lord and to our God for
[57:37] he will abundantly pardon for my
[57:39] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[57:41] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[57:44] for as the heavens are higher than the
[57:46] earth so are my ways higher than your
[57:48] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[57:50] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[57:52] from heaven and returneth not thither
[57:54] but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring
[57:57] forth fruit and maketh it bring forth
[57:59] and Bud that it may give seed to the S
[58:03] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[58:06] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[58:09] shall not return unto me void but it
[58:11] shall accomplish that which I please and
[58:14] it shall prosper in the thing whet I
[58:17] sent it amen God bless you you can have
[58:19] your seats this morning and as you might
[58:21] imagine we are not continuing on our
[58:23] series on the Holy Ghost we started one
[58:25] and you know me I'm I like to get in a
[58:26] Groove and just go but the Lord has led
[58:28] me in a different direction this morning
[58:30] this is actually something I've I've
[58:32] studied for quite some time it's been
[58:34] sitting in my notes notes folder for
[58:36] three years and it was something brother
[58:37] Lonnie Jenkins spoke on and it just kind
[58:39] of opened up to me and I felt that I
[58:41] would take that this morning so I just
[58:43] want to take a service this morning
[58:44] maybe on Wednesday as well on this
[58:46] thought faithful and true amen faithful
[58:49] and true and we'll go back to our
[58:51] opening scripture where he says and this
[58:53] is God speaking now he says for my
[58:55] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[58:57] are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord
[59:00] now catch something here cuz God's
[59:01] trying to show us something that's what
[59:04] I love about the word is God's Not
[59:05] trying to hide something he's trying to
[59:07] show us something he's trying to open
[59:09] our eyes and he's trying to show how his
[59:11] thoughts are different than our thoughts
[59:12] and how his ways are different than our
[59:15] ways see we want God to do it the way we
[59:17] do it but God says I can't do it your
[59:19] way because your way doesn't work I've
[59:21] got my way and my ways are different
[59:23] than yours so he's trying to get us to
[59:25] catch the way he does it so we can get
[59:26] in line with it so we can see it so we
[59:29] can receive it rather than be stuck in
[59:31] our own stinking thinking amen he says
[59:34] for as the heavens are higher than the
[59:36] earth so are my ways higher than your
[59:39] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[59:41] I don't care if you take the highest
[59:42] peak on this Earth you go to Mount
[59:44] Everest that's the highest point of
[59:45] Earth directly above that is the heavens
[59:48] no matter how high we get God's always
[59:50] higher no matter how spiritual we get no
[59:53] matter how great our Revelation is our
[59:54] education our learning learning our
[59:56] experience we can never attain to what
[59:59] God thinks and the way God does things
[1:00:01] his ways are beyond our understanding
[1:00:03] they're beyond our searching but he's
[1:00:05] trying to get us to grasp it in some way
[1:00:07] to this morning amen but we cannot
[1:00:09] attain to them by anything that we do or
[1:00:11] think amen we can't even approach the
[1:00:13] word of God with our thoughts my wife
[1:00:16] and I were talking about this on our
[1:00:17] walk yesterday and I I I was I was um
[1:00:20] watching a guy that said you know if if
[1:00:21] you want to study the word you've got to
[1:00:23] know I think the word is human etics
[1:00:27] and the first thing that came to me is I
[1:00:28] wonder what PE Peter thought about human
[1:00:30] etics when he was preaching on the day
[1:00:32] of
[1:00:33] Pentecost Paul had to forget his human
[1:00:35] etics he had to forget everything
[1:00:38] because it's man's thinking we think
[1:00:40] we're trying to we're trying by by
[1:00:42] sincerity we're trying to understand the
[1:00:44] word of God but one thing I found is you
[1:00:47] cannot preach this word without
[1:00:48] Revelation you can study till you're
[1:00:51] blue in the face and don't ever stop
[1:00:53] studying but it takes God to Quicken
[1:00:55] this word and open it up to the reality
[1:00:58] and the prophet of God said God
[1:01:00] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:01:02] pass and let me show you where human
[1:01:04] etics has gotten them denomination that
[1:01:06] means it ain't found in human etics
[1:01:08] doesn't mean it's wrong doesn't mean it
[1:01:09] doesn't have its place but the study of
[1:01:11] the scriptures comes through the opening
[1:01:14] of the word to the person by the Holy
[1:01:16] Spirit and that's the way that God works
[1:01:18] in these things the the great mystery of
[1:01:20] the word is how God does it and
[1:01:23] everybody misses it for all their study
[1:01:25] for all their expectation for all their
[1:01:27] believing for all their teaching yet
[1:01:30] people miss it every single time and let
[1:01:32] me tell you we're in the season where we
[1:01:34] cannot miss it and here's the thing I'm
[1:01:36] here to tell you today we will not miss
[1:01:38] it praise the Lord he's faithful and
[1:01:40] true he won't let us miss it but even in
[1:01:42] Jesus day the disciples are there and
[1:01:45] they're seeing the word fulfilled
[1:01:46] they're seeing the word in flesh and
[1:01:49] they don't have a clue of what's going
[1:01:50] on and the scripture says he told them
[1:01:53] everything was going to happen and yet
[1:01:54] they understood it not and it's only
[1:01:56] after it's happened that they start to
[1:01:58] place the events of their life the
[1:02:00] events of Jesus into the scriptures and
[1:02:03] they start to realize it's already
[1:02:05] happened but that awakened them to the
[1:02:07] season they were in now praise the lord
[1:02:09] we might miss it but it won't hold us
[1:02:11] back we'll catch up eventually and we
[1:02:13] see that as soon as they catch where
[1:02:15] they are then they realize that there's
[1:02:16] more ahead and they put themselves in
[1:02:18] the season in the time of God and they
[1:02:20] step into it and they become a part of
[1:02:22] it but God help us set aside our
[1:02:24] preconceived notions this evening there
[1:02:25] this morning amen about the way that
[1:02:27] God's got to do things or the way God's
[1:02:29] going to do things listen I can't ever
[1:02:31] presume to know how he's going to do it
[1:02:34] but I am learning to trust amen and to
[1:02:37] see the glimpses and in those glimpses
[1:02:40] to have faith that picks up and says
[1:02:42] he's working I'm seeing just a little
[1:02:44] bit here I'm just seeing a little bit
[1:02:45] there but that's enough for Faith to
[1:02:47] spark up and I say he's moving God's on
[1:02:49] the Move God's doing something brother
[1:02:52] bam says it this way he says God has two
[1:02:54] ways in all things and that's the right
[1:02:56] way and a wrong way and your way and my
[1:03:00] way is the wrong way prophet of God says
[1:03:04] this he says my way is the wrong way and
[1:03:06] your way is the wrong way he says God's
[1:03:08] way is always the right way no matter
[1:03:10] how unright it seems to us yet God's
[1:03:13] ways are true and right and then he says
[1:03:16] these words their past understanding go
[1:03:21] explain job's experience to me how that
[1:03:23] would ever make sense to us why did
[1:03:25] Abraham and Sarah have to wait 255 years
[1:03:28] why did women have to have their
[1:03:29] children torn from them and people saw
[1:03:31] an aunder like Isaiah why it's all past
[1:03:34] our understanding but he knows all
[1:03:36] things he says they're past
[1:03:38] understanding but God works in
[1:03:40] mysterious ways his wonders to perform
[1:03:44] now I say that and we just got a bunch
[1:03:45] of amens but I want to ask you this
[1:03:47] morning when we think about it that way
[1:03:50] the question I've got to ask myself and
[1:03:52] you've got to ask yourself is am I
[1:03:53] trying to tell God how to do things
[1:03:56] because remember my ways are always
[1:03:59] wrong and his ways are always right the
[1:04:03] only time my ways are right is when my
[1:04:05] way becomes his way so the answer is not
[1:04:08] should I tell him what to do my answer
[1:04:09] ought to be Lord show me what you want
[1:04:11] done so I can get in line so I can get
[1:04:14] out of your way so I can get in the
[1:04:16] channel I can put my shoulder to the
[1:04:17] wheel and be a help rather than a
[1:04:19] hindrance in my daily life
[1:04:21] amen it's so spiritual in church we say
[1:04:25] amens one wonderfully in church don't we
[1:04:27] but we walk out the door and then the
[1:04:28] question is will we be as spiritual
[1:04:30] there as we are here this morning amen
[1:04:32] will we tell God what to do cuz he does
[1:04:35] all things well you and I not so much
[1:04:38] not so much amen we make a hash out of
[1:04:40] things it's a dog's breakfast when we're
[1:04:41] done brother Bob shared a quote with me
[1:04:43] this this week and and it was right in
[1:04:45] it slid right into these notes that I
[1:04:47] have perfectly you know don't ever be
[1:04:49] scared to share a scripture or quote
[1:04:51] with me you know why I love it one it
[1:04:54] helps me it encourages me but two it
[1:04:57] lets me know that you're reading and
[1:04:59] you're listening yourself because the
[1:05:01] growth that you get in these services
[1:05:02] for a couple of hours a week is not your
[1:05:05] major growth this is just little points
[1:05:07] to help get you along the way but that
[1:05:09] daytoday relationship with Christ that
[1:05:11] day-to-day reading and feeding on the
[1:05:12] word that's where the greatest growth is
[1:05:14] going to come dayto day that's where
[1:05:16] your Victory comes is that day-to-day
[1:05:17] relationship with Christ that you have
[1:05:20] don't ever think you're trying to
[1:05:21] influence me I love it I love it when
[1:05:23] somebody comes up and says Hey Brother
[1:05:24] John look at what a look at what I read
[1:05:26] this morning look at this just jumped
[1:05:27] out of me and I say praise the Lord
[1:05:29] praise the Lord but he sent me this
[1:05:31] quote and it says this we were speaking
[1:05:33] the other night on how the seed must die
[1:05:36] and everything around that germ of Life
[1:05:38] must not only die but
[1:05:42] rot but rot he says if it doesn't rot it
[1:05:46] cannot live see when you look at a seed
[1:05:50] it's there and it's in this nice tight
[1:05:52] sealed package and nothing can get in
[1:05:55] but the process of Life requires rotting
[1:05:58] first because the rot of that seed gives
[1:06:01] it the first bit of nutrients to grow
[1:06:03] into what it's supposed to be he says it
[1:06:06] it if it doesn't rot it cannot rot live
[1:06:08] and rot is completely done away with
[1:06:12] it's finished and until we get to the
[1:06:14] place that our own ideas and our own
[1:06:16] thinking are completely gone and it's
[1:06:20] rotted away from us then the germ of
[1:06:23] Life can begin to live amen we've got to
[1:06:28] completely lay aside the mind that we
[1:06:31] have the thoughts that we have the
[1:06:32] opinions that we have the ways that we
[1:06:34] would do it completely because God's got
[1:06:37] a different plan than ours guaranteed
[1:06:39] guaranteed he says the same thing as
[1:06:41] arrived again and Men won't believe
[1:06:44] people won't believe churches won't
[1:06:46] believe no wonder he says you can't be
[1:06:48] disappointed in it because the Bible
[1:06:49] said they wouldn't do it but it's you
[1:06:52] individuals you that's ordained to life
[1:06:55] he says look upon the fields now and see
[1:06:58] what hour we're living in he says come
[1:07:00] to life let the life that was in Christ
[1:07:03] come to you come in you he says the mind
[1:07:06] you said oh I think this I think this
[1:07:09] you ain't got no thought coming you let
[1:07:11] the thoughts that were in Christ be in
[1:07:13] you and what are those thoughts he says
[1:07:16] that's the word he says that's right
[1:07:19] think the thoughts that he thought he
[1:07:21] continues again he says you haven't got
[1:07:23] no thought coming are we getting in the
[1:07:25] picture this morning lay aside
[1:07:27] everything those are the things that
[1:07:29] easily beset us I think is our own
[1:07:31] thoughts and our own ideas he says you
[1:07:33] ain't got no thought coming it's what he
[1:07:35] said you deny your
[1:07:39] thinking he says you just say what he
[1:07:42] says that's really confession confession
[1:07:45] means to say the same thing he says if I
[1:07:47] confess that a certain thing taken place
[1:07:49] I say the same thing that took place
[1:07:51] that's what real confession is and he
[1:07:53] says he's the high priest of our
[1:07:54] confessions see saying the same thing
[1:07:57] God said see that makes it right cuz
[1:08:00] you're just repeating God's word amen
[1:08:03] remember we've read we've said this
[1:08:05] scripture so many times that they
[1:08:06] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[1:08:08] the word of their testimony when our
[1:08:10] testimony lines up with the word of God
[1:08:12] then that's something that's going to
[1:08:13] happen and mean that's something that's
[1:08:14] real that's something that's truth
[1:08:16] that's something that's life is when we
[1:08:17] say what he's already said it's prophecy
[1:08:20] when it comes out of our mouth because
[1:08:22] it's his and it comes into us now and
[1:08:24] we're saying the same thing that he said
[1:08:26] I say God help us to think his thoughts
[1:08:28] this morning amen God and he says the
[1:08:31] only way we can do that is that we
[1:08:33] repeat the word of God too often we're
[1:08:36] sitting there trying to Hash through the
[1:08:38] situation rather than say what does the
[1:08:41] word of God say about my situation
[1:08:44] because if we focus on the word it'll
[1:08:46] give us faith if we focus on the
[1:08:47] circumstances it'll rear up our mind and
[1:08:50] our education and our logic and our
[1:08:52] reason and it'll put Faith completely
[1:08:54] aside and replace it with what the tree
[1:08:56] of knowledge of Good and Evil and it
[1:08:58] never takes us anywhere good but God
[1:09:00] says here my ways are not your ways they
[1:09:02] way higher my thoughts are your not your
[1:09:03] thoughts they're way higher too and if
[1:09:05] we look in Isaiah and we continue here
[1:09:07] he shows us how his thoughts work and
[1:09:10] how his ways work so what he's trying to
[1:09:11] do is show us how the word Works he says
[1:09:15] for as the rain he's he's doing a simile
[1:09:18] here he's making a comparison for as the
[1:09:20] rain cometh down and the snow from
[1:09:23] heaven and returneth not thither so in
[1:09:25] other words the rain and the snow come
[1:09:27] down in one form and they don't go up as
[1:09:29] rain and snow they come down and they
[1:09:31] stay down now we know today we have
[1:09:32] evaporation but he's saying God doesn't
[1:09:34] send it down and then just take it away
[1:09:36] he says it comes down and it stays there
[1:09:39] and it soaks the
[1:09:41] Earth he says it returns not thither but
[1:09:44] it WTH the Earth and maketh it bring
[1:09:47] forth and Bud that it may give seed to
[1:09:49] the S and bread to the eater he says as
[1:09:52] the rain does that and it does this
[1:09:54] process so shall my word be that goeth
[1:09:57] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:09:59] return unto me void but it shall
[1:10:01] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:10:03] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:10:06] sent it so this is the cycle of the word
[1:10:08] of God being revealed here God's trying
[1:10:10] to show us so we can see in our lives
[1:10:13] now when we take the word how that's
[1:10:15] going to work because we think today
[1:10:18] that everything's got to be immediate I
[1:10:20] take the word and it happens no he says
[1:10:22] the word is a cycle there's a proc
[1:10:25] process that goes with this so many
[1:10:27] times and there's a mystery and he says
[1:10:29] the word is like as rain and snow that
[1:10:31] come down from
[1:10:32] heaven we talk about washing of Water by
[1:10:35] the word the water is the word of God
[1:10:38] and we know that water is life water is
[1:10:41] life and when it comes to plants which
[1:10:42] is what he's comparing us to without
[1:10:45] water the plants will perish and with
[1:10:48] little water what do plants
[1:10:50] become
[1:10:52] spiky spiky
[1:10:55] you tell if you're around people that
[1:10:57] are grumpy all the time that have no joy
[1:11:00] that have no peace that can't say a good
[1:11:02] thing you know what the problem is
[1:11:03] church they haven't been sitting under a
[1:11:06] raincloud they haven't gotten any water
[1:11:09] they haven't gotten into the presence of
[1:11:10] God and it's just a little bit but
[1:11:12] you'll notice even a cactus blooms
[1:11:14] occasionally but it's spiky the rest of
[1:11:16] the time we ought not to be cacti this
[1:11:18] morning amen we ought to be getting into
[1:11:20] the presence of God but notice the
[1:11:22] presence of God the word of God is like
[1:11:24] rain and snow but here's the thing
[1:11:26] you've got to have something good in you
[1:11:28] for it to do any good for
[1:11:30] you remember brother Bram he he was
[1:11:33] wondering about false anointed ones and
[1:11:35] he that that man that had a gift of of
[1:11:37] tongues and another one that had
[1:11:39] interpretation and one of them lived a
[1:11:40] good cream clean Christian Life and the
[1:11:42] other one was cheating on his wife and
[1:11:44] he said God how does that work and he
[1:11:46] says in this scripture Kingdom that the
[1:11:48] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:11:50] unjust the weeds love the presence of
[1:11:52] God just as much as the fruit tree does
[1:11:55] but what's the what what is it doing in
[1:11:57] one it's bringing in both of them it's
[1:11:59] bringing forth what they are but the
[1:12:01] presence doesn't change the weed into a
[1:12:02] fruit tree it's still a weed and it
[1:12:05] still enjoys the rain but it doesn't
[1:12:06] change it what is it doing it's bringing
[1:12:09] out what's in you already that's what
[1:12:12] the word does and because some people
[1:12:14] read this and they reject it and what
[1:12:15] does it do it brings out damnation and
[1:12:18] judgment and there others will read it
[1:12:20] and it brings forth life eternal life
[1:12:22] and joy and love abundantly it's the
[1:12:24] same it has a completely different thing
[1:12:27] that it brings out but what's the
[1:12:29] intended purpose of
[1:12:31] this cuz remember the rain doesn't
[1:12:33] change who you are the presence of God
[1:12:35] doesn't change who you are you either
[1:12:37] are a child of God or you are not a
[1:12:39] child of God it's that simple but the
[1:12:41] purpose of the rain and snow is to water
[1:12:43] the Earth and what does that represent
[1:12:46] the Earth represents us you go to
[1:12:47] Matthew 13 the two Parables there we are
[1:12:50] the good ground and we are the good seed
[1:12:52] amen the water of the thoughts of God of
[1:12:54] the ways of God which is his word is now
[1:12:57] poured out on on Flesh on Earth to make
[1:13:00] it do what what does this do it makes it
[1:13:04] bring forth and Bud in other words it
[1:13:07] produces the conditions to bring out
[1:13:11] what's already there like we said the
[1:13:13] rain doesn't change you but it brings
[1:13:16] out what's in each and every one of us
[1:13:18] amen it'll produce what's inside that
[1:13:20] plant you'll find that plants that have
[1:13:23] lots of water produce lots of fruit
[1:13:25] lots of Blossom lots of blooms you go
[1:13:27] down into the into the
[1:13:29] rainforest those things they never stop
[1:13:32] blooming they've got so much nutrition
[1:13:34] so much water they just give and give
[1:13:37] and give and Blossom and Blossom and the
[1:13:40] trees go massively if you've been to
[1:13:41] British Columbia it's the same thing it
[1:13:44] it's a northern uh rainforest they have
[1:13:47] there and the trees will goow grow a
[1:13:49] foot foot and a half two foot a year in
[1:13:52] Newland we get about three inches a year
[1:13:55] why cuz we don't have the soil but we
[1:13:56] did we got the rain something else is
[1:13:58] wrong but BC they've got perfect
[1:14:00] conditions they have all that rain and
[1:14:01] these trees just grow massively
[1:14:04] massively why because they don't have to
[1:14:06] hold back they don't have to worry they
[1:14:09] don't have to wonder where their next
[1:14:10] meal is coming from they just drink in
[1:14:12] everything they've got every day and
[1:14:13] they just push it out push it out push
[1:14:15] it out amen why do they do it because
[1:14:19] there's no lack in
[1:14:21] them people that don't give you know
[1:14:23] what the problem is they don't have
[1:14:25] anything in them to give they're too
[1:14:26] worried about where their next meal's
[1:14:28] coming from where their next Revival's
[1:14:30] coming from and dayto day they're
[1:14:31] missing that day to-day watering that's
[1:14:33] supposed to be happening as as Believers
[1:14:36] amen but you run into people and they
[1:14:38] just give of themselves and give of
[1:14:39] themselves and it seems like they can
[1:14:40] absorb punishment they can handle this
[1:14:42] and they can handle that why they're
[1:14:44] drinking from an inexhaustible Fountain
[1:14:46] they've tapped into the River of Life
[1:14:49] amen why they know it's never going to
[1:14:51] go away remember what Jesus said we read
[1:14:53] this in a couple services go but
[1:14:55] whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[1:14:57] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:14:59] the water that I give him shall be
[1:15:02] where in him it's inside of you he says
[1:15:07] it shall be in him a well of water
[1:15:09] springing up unto everlasting life we go
[1:15:12] to David in Psalms 34 he says the angel
[1:15:15] of the Lord encampeth round about them
[1:15:17] that fear Him and deliver them he says
[1:15:19] oh taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:15:22] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:15:25] oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there
[1:15:27] is no want that means there's lacking
[1:15:29] they're lacking nothing there's no want
[1:15:31] to them that fear Him the Young Lions do
[1:15:34] lack and suffer hunger but they that
[1:15:36] seek the Lord shall not want they shall
[1:15:38] not lack any good thing you need
[1:15:41] something good from God you've got
[1:15:42] access to it this morning
[1:15:44] amen if you seek Him
[1:15:49] First David says this Psalms 1 blessed
[1:15:52] is the man that walketh not in the
[1:15:53] counsel of the ungodly
[1:15:55] nor standeth in the way of Sinners and
[1:15:57] we all
[1:15:59] said three
[1:16:02] amens my wife and I were talking about
[1:16:04] this scripture yesterday on our walk we
[1:16:07] say Amen to those first two portions but
[1:16:09] then he says nor sth in the seat of the
[1:16:13] scornful you know what's scornful pride
[1:16:17] pride I'm better than he is I'm better
[1:16:20] than she is I got more than they do what
[1:16:22] are they going on about they don't have
[1:16:25] anything remember when brother Bram
[1:16:27] tells that story about those I believe
[1:16:28] it was two sisters I'm paraphrasing here
[1:16:30] forgive me if I get the details uh not
[1:16:32] quite right but I believe it it was
[1:16:34] early in his in his in his Christian
[1:16:36] experience and he's at that meeting and
[1:16:37] I believe it was two sisters started
[1:16:39] dancing in the aisle and you know where
[1:16:41] brother brandham sat in the seed of the
[1:16:43] scornful and he was in his mind he was
[1:16:46] putting him down and what did the Lord
[1:16:48] say to him he says if you had what they
[1:16:51] had you'd do what they do you know what
[1:16:54] we'll sit here here and somebody might
[1:16:56] start shouting somebody might start
[1:16:57] praising and we look into their lives
[1:16:59] and say but they're barely a Christian
[1:17:01] well if they can Shout with the little
[1:17:03] they have what's keeping us in our seats
[1:17:05] this morning amen if they can Shout with
[1:17:07] what the little that they've got what's
[1:17:09] holding us back it's we're sitting in
[1:17:10] the seat of the scornful amen we ought
[1:17:13] to be free and when somebody gets any
[1:17:15] lick of freedom and they express it we
[1:17:17] ought to be right there you know I've
[1:17:19] been watching clips of the
[1:17:21] Olympics and last night the United
[1:17:23] States basketball W gold and they're
[1:17:26] about 15 seconds from the
[1:17:29] end and it was at that point that that
[1:17:32] the player that had made the most impact
[1:17:34] that game he did this symbol where he
[1:17:36] said this and it was nighty night as in
[1:17:38] it's all over and he started shouting
[1:17:41] and he started dancing around and he
[1:17:43] started screaming because he knew it was
[1:17:47] finished and yet we can sit in our seats
[1:17:50] and nothing nothing expressed and we've
[1:17:53] got the liberty of the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:17:55] in our midst
[1:17:57] amen if they can do it over a stupid
[1:18:01] basketball game that everybody's going
[1:18:04] to forget within the next couple of
[1:18:06] months what are we to do with eternal
[1:18:08] life flowing through our bodies freeing
[1:18:10] us from our flesh freeing us from our
[1:18:12] past freeing us from family traditions
[1:18:14] free freeing us from our own thinking
[1:18:17] anden we ought to be able to worship him
[1:18:19] this morning I'm not giving you a hard
[1:18:20] time I'm saying we ought to be able to
[1:18:23] amen not sitting in the seat of the
[1:18:25] scornful let the Holy Spirit have its
[1:18:28] freedom in your life he says but his
[1:18:30] Delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:18:32] his law do he meditate day and night and
[1:18:35] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:18:37] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:18:40] fruit in his season now catch this he
[1:18:43] says his Leaf shall not wither when
[1:18:45] we're planted we don't have to go
[1:18:47] through Seasons where the fruit of the
[1:18:49] holy spirit is not there if we're
[1:18:51] drinking every single day his Leaf shall
[1:18:55] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:18:59] prosper coming back to Isaiah he says
[1:19:01] for he's talking about the effect of
[1:19:03] this now as the rain comes down the snow
[1:19:05] from Heavens returns not thither it
[1:19:07] Waters the Earth and makes it bring
[1:19:08] forth in Bud what is the purpose of it
[1:19:11] bringing forth and giving Bud he says
[1:19:13] that it may give seed to the S and bread
[1:19:17] to the eater now who is the
[1:19:20] S it's Christ that's the son of man
[1:19:22] again you go back to Matthew 13 what's
[1:19:25] he doing why is God blessing us why is
[1:19:27] God producing something in us why is God
[1:19:30] giving us the word and then manifesting
[1:19:32] the word in our life first of all to
[1:19:34] give back to him to give back to him he
[1:19:37] said freely you've received now freely
[1:19:40] give but catch this now it's not just
[1:19:43] it's not just to take his blessings or
[1:19:45] his Mercy or his grace or his promises
[1:19:47] but as we've received them now we give
[1:19:49] them to somebody else if God has healed
[1:19:51] you you know what you do you give a
[1:19:53] testimony so somebody else can grab onto
[1:19:55] that faith and get a healing themselves
[1:19:57] if you've been provided for then you can
[1:19:59] say you can go around and say God
[1:20:00] provides he's Jehovah Gyra so somebody
[1:20:02] else can get that man I so appreciate
[1:20:05] our visitors coming in and they sing a
[1:20:07] song and it's right in line with the
[1:20:08] service this morning God bless you God
[1:20:10] bless you richly for that they took
[1:20:12] because it's not just it's not just
[1:20:14] healings and Gifts it's not just
[1:20:16] money it's taking everything that God
[1:20:19] has given you for his glory and now
[1:20:22] using it for his glory and giving it
[1:20:23] back to him whether you're on vacation
[1:20:25] or whether you're at your post of Duty
[1:20:26] at home God bless you each one for doing
[1:20:30] that we don't have to preach to share
[1:20:32] this gospel amen the gospel is not a
[1:20:35] Doctrine the gospel is a life and every
[1:20:38] single one of us has a Life by the Holy
[1:20:40] Spirit that's in us and when that word
[1:20:42] is alive in us it can't help but produce
[1:20:44] something the fruit of the spirit is
[1:20:47] life it is love and joy and peace and
[1:20:50] patience in these things and so as we're
[1:20:52] walking through life the problem so many
[1:20:54] times times churches that were trying to
[1:20:56] explain it rather than just be
[1:20:59] it I saw sister Rebecca LaFontaine
[1:21:01] posted this thinging that said the
[1:21:03] world's not reading their Bibles they're
[1:21:04] reading you we're the only word that
[1:21:07] they're ever going to see and so we
[1:21:09] don't have to sit there explain it cuz
[1:21:11] they won't understand the explanation
[1:21:14] but they'll understand the
[1:21:16] impact cuz they may not understand why
[1:21:19] it works but they see in our life that
[1:21:21] it does work and then by God's grace
[1:21:23] they might say I want some of that
[1:21:25] God help me to have that amen our job is
[1:21:27] to produce fruit not explain how it
[1:21:30] happens cuz we can't we can't explain
[1:21:33] how it happens Church you tell me how
[1:21:35] you got delivered you tell me how you
[1:21:36] broke a family cycle you tell me how you
[1:21:38] came out from under a Catholic mushroom
[1:21:40] brother Mark you can't do it it just
[1:21:42] happened the third poll can't be
[1:21:44] explained remember they're in that
[1:21:46] little room and one goes in and he's got
[1:21:48] a short leg and he comes out and his leg
[1:21:49] is the same size the other one what
[1:21:51] happened I don't know all I know is it
[1:21:53] happened we're here to say it
[1:21:57] works taste and see I've tasted I can
[1:22:01] see you can see now it's time for you to
[1:22:03] taste and see if it works for you as
[1:22:05] well amen our our our lives are here to
[1:22:08] show what happens when you drink from an
[1:22:10] inexhaustible Fountain of the Living
[1:22:12] Word of God Amen seed to the sewer and
[1:22:15] bread to the eater it's to feed those
[1:22:16] around us it's to not it's not to serve
[1:22:19] or to to be served it's to serve amen
[1:22:22] it's not to receive you've already
[1:22:24] received you got your portion you're
[1:22:26] sealed to the day of your Redemption you
[1:22:28] have the the eternal life of God the
[1:22:30] Zoey life of God on the inside you have
[1:22:32] your reward now it's time for you to
[1:22:34] give to
[1:22:35] others remember the fruit on the tree is
[1:22:38] not for the tree it's for the the one
[1:22:39] that passes
[1:22:41] by and then we we we begrudge people
[1:22:44] when they take our fruit of patience
[1:22:46] that's what it's there for is to be used
[1:22:48] not to be looked at to be used when
[1:22:52] somebody tries to take joy from us guess
[1:22:54] what we to say it's okay I got more
[1:22:56] where that came from I've got something
[1:22:58] the world can't give and the world can't
[1:22:59] take it away I've got an inexhaustible
[1:23:01] Fountain springing up within me that'll
[1:23:03] produce some more tomorrow amen
[1:23:07] hallelujah can I say it this way you
[1:23:09] want to know what's in somebody give
[1:23:11] them everything they have need of and
[1:23:12] see what they do with
[1:23:14] it give them a blessing give them a gift
[1:23:18] give them a calling give them a position
[1:23:20] give them all the money they need and
[1:23:23] see what they do with it because if what
[1:23:25] they turn to is themselves there's a
[1:23:28] problem but if they can take that and
[1:23:29] they can put it back into the kingdom of
[1:23:32] God not to raise up their image not to
[1:23:35] make life the easiest but rather take it
[1:23:37] and say Lord what would you have your
[1:23:39] servant to do and then use it for its
[1:23:41] Kingdom Purpose that's when you know
[1:23:42] that God will keep blessing them it's
[1:23:44] really hard to be rich and serve
[1:23:47] God I think that's the reason why most
[1:23:49] of us aren't Rich It's Not Meant For Us
[1:23:52] amen our wealth is waiting for us
[1:23:58] you want to know what's on the inside
[1:23:59] give somebody a lot and see what they do
[1:24:01] with it because if they keep giving you
[1:24:03] know there's a reality there if they
[1:24:05] keep holding on to it that's not God I
[1:24:08] was reading in Ezekiel 34 the other day
[1:24:11] in my devotions and God was just
[1:24:13] blasting the pastors of that day the
[1:24:14] Shepherds of that day because they were
[1:24:16] taking everything they needed and the
[1:24:19] only thing they give back he said listen
[1:24:21] you you you don't just take everything
[1:24:23] but you don't go seek the lost you don't
[1:24:25] help the diseased you don't fix the ones
[1:24:27] that are broken you're not doing
[1:24:28] anything you're just take take Taking he
[1:24:30] said and then what you give them is the
[1:24:33] grass that you've trod under your feet
[1:24:35] into the mud and the water you give them
[1:24:37] has been soiled from you walking around
[1:24:38] in it and getting your good out of it
[1:24:40] and he says I'll destroy you and I'll
[1:24:42] make them sheep of my pasture and I'll
[1:24:44] feed them what they
[1:24:46] need they were 100% selfish seeking only
[1:24:49] their own benefit but if you're planted
[1:24:51] by the rivers of God if you're planted
[1:24:53] by the the living word when he sends
[1:24:55] something to you you'll produce
[1:24:57] something that is meant for somebody
[1:24:59] else amen your provision is in
[1:25:01] God I ain't providing for myself sure
[1:25:04] I've got a degree I've got an education
[1:25:06] I've got all these things but hey like I
[1:25:08] said before God has given me Grace where
[1:25:10] I didn't deserve it where others were
[1:25:11] more deserving but he gave to me because
[1:25:14] he knew that he could trust me with it
[1:25:15] it's the same thing for you if God can
[1:25:17] trust you with it he'll give it to you
[1:25:19] that's just the way he
[1:25:21] works Ecclesiastes 11 says cast thy
[1:25:24] breath bread upon the waters for Thou
[1:25:26] shalt find it after many days you go to
[1:25:27] the Amplified it says freely give your
[1:25:29] things to other people if you do that
[1:25:32] one day you will receive your things
[1:25:34] back now he's talking about this is
[1:25:36] really the law of the Harvest in one big
[1:25:38] sc one little scripture and that's that
[1:25:40] the word must be fulfilled because what
[1:25:42] we're giving out is not things what
[1:25:44] we're giving out is the word life that
[1:25:45] we have we're offering it to every
[1:25:47] single one that's going by so if you
[1:25:49] give out bad things you'll get bad
[1:25:51] things back you give out good things
[1:25:52] you'll get good things back you give a
[1:25:54] good testimony out you'll get a good
[1:25:56] testimony back you give a bad testimony
[1:25:57] out you'll get a bad testimony back but
[1:26:00] you got to see this he says he cast it
[1:26:02] upon the Water a a and and it'll produce
[1:26:06] something one
[1:26:08] day many days it says see we're talking
[1:26:11] about
[1:26:12] Cycles it's not I'm going to put it out
[1:26:14] today and tomorrow I get it oh I'm going
[1:26:16] to give a witness to my coworker and
[1:26:18] tomorrow they'll come in no no no no no
[1:26:20] this is a cycle it's many days it's a
[1:26:23] long game God's in it for the long game
[1:26:27] amen he says Thou shalt find it after
[1:26:29] many days you'll get back what you gave
[1:26:31] out why because the word cannot return
[1:26:33] void now you look in the scriptures and
[1:26:35] Waters always represents people notice
[1:26:37] it doesn't say water
[1:26:40] Waters
[1:26:42] everyone not just the people that like
[1:26:44] you not just the people in the church
[1:26:46] not just the ones that treat you nice
[1:26:49] those aren't the ones that need it the
[1:26:50] most they've got their own Supply by
[1:26:52] God's grace but it's the ones that don't
[1:26:54] don't have anything that are coming to
[1:26:55] eat from you that's why they eat from
[1:26:56] you is because they don't have any
[1:26:58] themselves those are the ones amen
[1:27:00] listen we had to be converted to serve
[1:27:03] Christ and everyone that's taking of our
[1:27:05] fruit needs to be converted the same way
[1:27:07] we do somebody had to be kind to us
[1:27:10] somebody had to be loving to us somebody
[1:27:11] had to give us time and patience and all
[1:27:13] of these things so that we could come to
[1:27:15] Christ somebody had to have
[1:27:16] consideration for us above their own
[1:27:18] needs and we've got to be able to do the
[1:27:20] same thing these people that are taking
[1:27:22] our fruit aren't necessarily going to be
[1:27:23] loving
[1:27:25] perfect
[1:27:26] appreciative come on people don't
[1:27:29] appreciate it much when Christians do
[1:27:30] stuff they just take it and run a lot of
[1:27:32] times and we've got to be okay with that
[1:27:35] because we've got more fruit to give
[1:27:36] every single day because we're in the
[1:27:38] presence of God feeding from the word of
[1:27:40] God Amen that never stops US people's
[1:27:44] response ought never to stop us from
[1:27:46] keeping on giving but we get burned and
[1:27:48] our our emotions flare up and we get
[1:27:50] offended and we get hurt but that's not
[1:27:52] the way it's supposed to work
[1:27:55] Braham says this he says that's why I
[1:27:57] want to put all my life for the Lord
[1:27:59] Jesus everything that I can do for him
[1:28:02] and I can only serve him as I serve his
[1:28:04] people you can only love him as you love
[1:28:06] each other I can only love him as I love
[1:28:09] you and you love me and together we love
[1:28:11] God and we become his children in that I
[1:28:13] serve you you serve me and that's we're
[1:28:16] serving God Jesus said in so much as you
[1:28:19] have done it unto the least of these
[1:28:20] little ones you've did it to me he says
[1:28:23] so if we want want a
[1:28:25] blessing let's be a blessing to someone
[1:28:28] else and a blessing will
[1:28:31] return anybody needing a blessing this
[1:28:35] morning another
[1:28:37] four you guys are doing good only four
[1:28:40] of you need a
[1:28:41] blessing for you
[1:28:43] four be a blessing you want your
[1:28:46] blessing go be a blessing see two any
[1:28:48] times when we're in need Our intention
[1:28:51] is let's go for me let's do everything
[1:28:53] to satisfy my need and he's saying no no
[1:28:55] no somebody out there is casting your
[1:28:57] need out on the waters you wait it'll
[1:28:59] come right to you you give remember that
[1:29:01] wi old woman came up and she gave those
[1:29:03] two mites we've read the quote a and in
[1:29:07] our hearts every one of us if we knew
[1:29:09] that that was her we didn't know Jesus
[1:29:11] knew it was her last two bit two pieces
[1:29:13] of money we wouldn't know that but even
[1:29:16] in not knowing that if a widow woman
[1:29:18] came up this morning a single sister
[1:29:21] came up and said here's everything I
[1:29:23] have I want to give it for me misss we'd
[1:29:24] say sister we don't need it we don't
[1:29:28] need it you hold on to it and God bless
[1:29:31] you for your willing heart and brother
[1:29:33] Braham says Jesus didn't stop her why
[1:29:36] because he knew what was coming down the
[1:29:38] road for her in response to the faith
[1:29:41] and the Willing heart that she had
[1:29:43] Hallelujah she cast her bread upon the
[1:29:46] water and something came back and I
[1:29:48] believe we'll find out in eternity what
[1:29:50] that was I think she's going to have a
[1:29:51] wonderful testimony in my one want I
[1:29:54] gave anyways and he supplied my every
[1:29:57] need if you want a blessing let's be a
[1:30:00] blessing to someone else and a blessing
[1:30:02] will return like casting your bread upon
[1:30:04] the Water it'll return that's true in
[1:30:06] all walks of life you'll find that he
[1:30:09] doesn't just say Christian he doesn't
[1:30:12] just say in the church he says in every
[1:30:14] aspect do this and you'll find you get
[1:30:17] something back he says you usually reap
[1:30:19] just as you sow so let's do good talk
[1:30:21] good and be kind and he says and people
[1:30:23] talk about us we'll say good things and
[1:30:25] kind things and good things will come
[1:30:27] our way if we give them
[1:30:29] out can we say Amen to that but can we
[1:30:32] say Amen when we walk out the doors
[1:30:35] because guess what not everybody's kind
[1:30:36] to us even professing Believers aren't
[1:30:38] always kind to us and what are we going
[1:30:41] to do are we going to stand back and say
[1:30:43] they ought to know better they ought to
[1:30:44] be more mature than that they ought to
[1:30:45] be further ahead or ought we to say kind
[1:30:47] things about that brother and sister and
[1:30:49] go into our prayer closet and say Lord
[1:30:51] help them Lord forgive them and Lord
[1:30:53] keep my attitude right in their
[1:30:54] shallowness right now maybe they're in a
[1:30:57] spot where they're a bit dried out that
[1:30:59] ought to put us in prayer on our knees
[1:31:01] not in offense Before the Throne of God
[1:31:03] saying Smite them
[1:31:04] Lord amen listen people get
[1:31:08] jealous people don't like it when we
[1:31:10] stand up and we refuse to compromise
[1:31:14] even within this
[1:31:17] message listen there's some things
[1:31:19] people do that I don't agree with in
[1:31:20] this
[1:31:21] message and they don't like it if I say
[1:31:23] I don't agree with with it but that
[1:31:25] doesn't mean I just give in and they
[1:31:28] might say things they might call me
[1:31:29] legalistic they might call me you know
[1:31:31] stick in the mud whatever it is young
[1:31:33] people you know what it's like you go
[1:31:35] off and you're on your phones and
[1:31:36] somebody wants to show you this and show
[1:31:38] you that we ought to be able to say we
[1:31:41] ought not to be looking at this kind of
[1:31:43] stuff what are you doing I don't want to
[1:31:45] see that what makes you think I want to
[1:31:46] see that and people will get offended
[1:31:49] because we stand up for our conscience
[1:31:53] for what the Holy Ghost would prick us
[1:31:55] there
[1:31:58] amen our chance our opportunity is in
[1:32:01] those
[1:32:02] moments when it's not going the way we
[1:32:04] like when people don't like it that's
[1:32:06] our chance in love in humility in
[1:32:08] meekness to express the hope that lies
[1:32:11] within
[1:32:12] us that's our
[1:32:17] opportunity he says so shall my word be
[1:32:19] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[1:32:20] shall not return unto me void
[1:32:25] we ought to be able to shout over that
[1:32:26] scripture this morning if you're
[1:32:28] believing if you're resting in the word
[1:32:29] of God he says it shall not return unto
[1:32:33] me void he says remember my words
[1:32:35] they're not like yours my thoughts
[1:32:36] aren't your ways my ways are not your
[1:32:37] ways it's in a cycle amen they start
[1:32:40] with rain coming down and then that rain
[1:32:42] has an effect that causes things to come
[1:32:44] out inside of people and then it
[1:32:46] produces something that benefits others
[1:32:48] but here's the thing church he says it
[1:32:50] always works it always works he did not
[1:32:54] give us a time on this but he says it
[1:32:56] shall not return unto me void he's
[1:32:58] saying here's the promise behind
[1:33:00] everything when I think it and then I
[1:33:02] say it it will happen it has to happen
[1:33:05] it's going to happen though it seems
[1:33:07] like it's not happening it is going to
[1:33:09] happen that's the promise we're resting
[1:33:11] on this morning he says it shall not
[1:33:13] return to me void that word void means
[1:33:15] it shall not be without effect it shall
[1:33:17] not be empty it shall not be pointless
[1:33:21] you know what as humans we say a lot of
[1:33:23] empty pointless ineffective things God
[1:33:27] says I don't talk like that I don't
[1:33:28] think like that I don't do like that
[1:33:31] everything I say comes with purpose and
[1:33:33] behind that purpose is power to make it
[1:33:37] happen he says so shall my word be that
[1:33:40] go forth out of my Mo mouth it shall not
[1:33:41] return to me void but it shall
[1:33:44] accomplish that word accomplish it shall
[1:33:46] do it shall make it shall produce it
[1:33:50] shall deal with Hallelujah it shall deal
[1:33:53] with your situation it'll deal with that
[1:33:55] person it says it'll
[1:33:58] prepare it'll
[1:34:00] acquire it'll appoint it'll bring about
[1:34:04] it will
[1:34:06] work that's what his word is amen how is
[1:34:09] it going to accomplish it we want
[1:34:12] immediacy that's the nature of humanity
[1:34:14] right now we want everything B right now
[1:34:16] but it accomplishes it in a cycle he
[1:34:18] says it's going to accomplish it but
[1:34:20] remember it comes down as rain it Waters
[1:34:23] it C causes growth it growth brings
[1:34:25] fruit and the fruit is what we need for
[1:34:27] every situation but it's a cycle of
[1:34:30] times and Seasons but it doesn't mean
[1:34:32] God's not in it if you don't see
[1:34:34] fruit there's a cycle that's happening
[1:34:37] through all these things that's how God
[1:34:39] works see so often we look at the
[1:34:41] supernatural that happens that gives us
[1:34:43] our testimony but we forget all of the
[1:34:45] long hours we forget all of the prayer
[1:34:48] we forget all of the seeking we forget
[1:34:50] all of the battle all of the rotting all
[1:34:52] of the dying out that happens before
[1:34:54] that and we say it was God at the end
[1:34:57] and we don't realize it's been God from
[1:34:59] start to end it was God that started the
[1:35:01] work it was God that sent the word it
[1:35:03] was God that helped you to catch it it
[1:35:05] was God that helped you to rot it was
[1:35:06] God that helped it to grow and then it
[1:35:08] was God that helped it to come into its
[1:35:09] fruition it was God from the beginning
[1:35:12] to the end and we want to put our
[1:35:13] testimony at the end he's saying catch
[1:35:15] this I'm there from start to finish I'm
[1:35:17] there at the beginning I'm there in my
[1:35:19] trial sister Nikki as you were saying
[1:35:21] when I'm down in the valley I'm there
[1:35:24] and we think the mountain is a
[1:35:25] supernatural experience no the M the the
[1:35:28] supernatural experience is that he takes
[1:35:29] you through every bit of those things
[1:35:31] and brings you into a manifested word in
[1:35:32] your life
[1:35:35] Hallelujah you ever notice you plant
[1:35:40] something a and it it takes
[1:35:43] weeks sometimes for something to pop out
[1:35:45] of the ground and then it takes weeks
[1:35:46] more for it to grow up and then in one
[1:35:49] night you go to bed and you come back
[1:35:51] the next morning then there's a little
[1:35:52] tomato there and you say it's a
[1:35:54] miracle no the miracle was that it grew
[1:35:57] in the first place that it survived
[1:35:59] through all of the weather and all of
[1:36:00] the seasons and all of the difficulties
[1:36:03] and the kids knocking it over and then
[1:36:04] it finally produces fruit then we're
[1:36:06] saying that's the miracle no the miracle
[1:36:08] was life all the way through it was life
[1:36:10] that started it and it was life that
[1:36:12] produced the the Tomato at the end the
[1:36:14] tomato is not Supernatural the whole
[1:36:16] thing is
[1:36:17] Supernatural
[1:36:19] amen think of that great woman that
[1:36:21] helped Elisha remember she built the the
[1:36:23] house on or or the room on top of the
[1:36:25] house so that he would have a place to
[1:36:27] rest and
[1:36:28] relax that was the supernatural portion
[1:36:31] for that woman and she had no clue what
[1:36:34] she was doing because what it did was it
[1:36:36] set a foundation for Fellowship she
[1:36:38] became a friend of the prophet and then
[1:36:40] from that friendship came a cry of her
[1:36:42] heart to have a son and he gave her the
[1:36:45] son by God's Will and then so she's now
[1:36:47] got this wonderful blessing and we say
[1:36:49] there's the supernatural but God knew
[1:36:52] what she would need all
[1:36:54] long amen we say the testimony is the
[1:36:57] child the testimony is that she started
[1:36:59] the work she cast her bread upon the
[1:37:01] water and it came back in the form of a
[1:37:03] son God has no unpaid debts as I've said
[1:37:06] so many times but then that continues
[1:37:09] and he's Jehovah Gyra he sees the need
[1:37:12] and the relationship is still there and
[1:37:13] so when her son dies she knows where to
[1:37:16] go she knows who to talk to and she
[1:37:18] knows there's a power to provide for the
[1:37:20] need of her dead son and she goes there
[1:37:23] there and she gets him back to life
[1:37:25] again the testimony was God from the
[1:37:28] room to the Risen child every bit of it
[1:37:32] it's a cycle
[1:37:33] amen being faithful to produce good
[1:37:36] fruit brother Bram says this about that
[1:37:38] shunamite woman he says that woman came
[1:37:40] to the door then all the good things she
[1:37:42] had done little did she know when she
[1:37:45] had that bed made in there for Elisha
[1:37:47] and made his bed with her own Dan that
[1:37:50] someday her dead baby will be laying
[1:37:52] there and the body of that Prophet
[1:37:54] through the Christ would bring that baby
[1:37:57] back to life again he says you don't
[1:38:00] know what's happening when you try to do
[1:38:02] something for one another see she's
[1:38:05] planted she's cast her bread upon the
[1:38:07] Water she's stepped out she's done
[1:38:09] something with what she has and he says
[1:38:12] you have no clue what you just
[1:38:16] did you have no idea sometimes the words
[1:38:19] we speak the kindness the goodness the
[1:38:22] graciousness the Forgiveness the
[1:38:23] longsuffering we have for people what
[1:38:25] that's going to turn out to in later in
[1:38:27] our life and later in their life he says
[1:38:30] you don't know what's happening when you
[1:38:31] try to do something for one another try
[1:38:33] to help one another that's right like
[1:38:35] bread upon the Water it'll Return To You
[1:38:39] Someday so many of us are here and we've
[1:38:41] got children that are away we've got
[1:38:43] family that are away from God we've got
[1:38:45] uh young people that are away from God
[1:38:46] we've got members of this church we've
[1:38:48] got people we know that are sick that
[1:38:50] are fighting for their lives that are
[1:38:52] fighting an Affliction they've had all
[1:38:53] their life and we're sitting there and
[1:38:55] we're looking for God to do a mighty
[1:38:57] work but let me tell you the mighty work
[1:38:59] is the end it is not the beginning but
[1:39:01] it starts in something so little and it
[1:39:04] can be encouragement it can be the right
[1:39:07] special at the right time sisters and
[1:39:09] brothers it can be a word in due season
[1:39:13] it can be a kindness it can be an
[1:39:15] accommodation it can be a
[1:39:18] forgiveness when you don't think they
[1:39:20] deserve it and you cast it upon the
[1:39:22] Water
[1:39:23] and you realize that's what we're trying
[1:39:25] to realize here it's God's Great cycle
[1:39:28] there's a rain there's a seed that's
[1:39:31] there there's a rotting there's a growth
[1:39:32] and then there's a fruit and it's just
[1:39:34] God doing it over and over and over
[1:39:38] again he says it shall accomplish what
[1:39:41] that which I
[1:39:44] please that word please it says that
[1:39:46] which I Delight in take pleasure in that
[1:39:49] which I desire so it's not what I want
[1:39:52] it's not what you want it'll produce
[1:39:54] what God wants and it's by his Good Will
[1:39:56] and it's by his good pleasure and it's
[1:39:58] by his thinking not our thinking amen he
[1:40:02] says and it shall prosper it shall
[1:40:05] prosper not it might
[1:40:08] maybe it shall it's a declaration it's a
[1:40:12] guarantee it's a promise it's a promise
[1:40:16] you can hang your soul on it he says it
[1:40:18] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:40:20] sent it this is where this thought of
[1:40:22] faithful and true comes from from this
[1:40:23] morning he says it shall prosper that
[1:40:25] means it will make
[1:40:27] progress see we think Prosperity is at
[1:40:30] the end no there's a path he says it'll
[1:40:33] make progress it will advance it will be
[1:40:36] profitable and then it will
[1:40:39] succeed prosperity in this case is a is
[1:40:43] a journey of getting better and better
[1:40:46] and better until it comes into
[1:40:47] Perfection Hallelujah see the word of
[1:40:50] God he says won't fall short it won't
[1:40:52] fail too often we look at the
[1:40:54] circumstances we look at the struggles
[1:40:56] we look at the barriers we see nothing
[1:40:59] of barriers here all we see is the word
[1:41:02] will come to pass that's all we see he
[1:41:05] doesn't look at those things he's not
[1:41:06] dwelling on those things and if he's not
[1:41:08] dwelling on it then why are we dwelling
[1:41:10] on it he never tells us to look at the
[1:41:12] circumstances he says only believe if
[1:41:14] thou cast believe all things are
[1:41:17] possible situations have no power except
[1:41:19] God gives them it's what Jesus said to
[1:41:22] pilate he saids you have no power except
[1:41:23] it was given you from above people have
[1:41:25] no power over us the word is where the
[1:41:28] power is the word is what has the
[1:41:30] promise behind it brother says this he
[1:41:32] says oh the blessedness of believing the
[1:41:35] blessing of not trying to figure it out
[1:41:37] church are you trying to figure out why
[1:41:40] and how and when and what's going on he
[1:41:43] says don't do that he says the blessing
[1:41:45] of just resting on God's word and say
[1:41:48] it's true and go on he says it's life
[1:41:51] it's real living
[1:41:54] oh my Hallelujah I want you to see
[1:41:57] something Church the unfailing part is
[1:41:59] not you the unfailing part is the word
[1:42:02] inside of you amen it's not me that's
[1:42:05] holding me up this flesh will fall this
[1:42:07] flesh will trip this mind will give out
[1:42:09] our emotions get the better of us but
[1:42:11] you'll never see God acknowledging those
[1:42:13] things except to say I'm a high priest
[1:42:15] that can be touched by your the feeling
[1:42:16] of your infirmities he says I know what
[1:42:18] it's like but that doesn't matter he
[1:42:21] never said it would hold him back he
[1:42:23] never said it would hold us back he
[1:42:25] never said it would stop the word he
[1:42:26] said my word will prosper it will
[1:42:29] accomplish that which I've sent it to
[1:42:32] do he said it will never hold you back
[1:42:35] ultimately we fight it's a battle we
[1:42:38] know that but it will not have our lives
[1:42:40] it will not take us it will not hold us
[1:42:42] back he conquered everything at Calvary
[1:42:44] Church he lived a sinless life and then
[1:42:46] he gave that sinless life for us so that
[1:42:49] we could have the victory this morning
[1:42:51] brother BR says this brother one day
[1:42:52] when I was lost worse than that I Heard
[1:42:54] a Voice say I'm still the mighty
[1:42:56] conqueror and he cleared away my sins
[1:42:59] and I laid my hand on the power of
[1:43:00] almighty God That Shook Me from the top
[1:43:03] of my head to the bottom of my feet and
[1:43:05] I've had my hand on that ever since at
[1:43:07] the end of this road My Savior Waits my
[1:43:10] loved ones wait and someday he says I
[1:43:13] hope to see them he says I'll hold to
[1:43:15] the road I'll hold to the wire of his
[1:43:17] glory remember he was talking about
[1:43:19] being lost in that
[1:43:21] snowstorm and his wife and his and his
[1:43:23] son I believe were down in the cabin and
[1:43:25] it was a storm that came in he was
[1:43:27] worried about their safety and he was
[1:43:29] all caught up in what a great Hunter and
[1:43:31] Outdoorsman he was and he says I'll find
[1:43:33] my way back and he realized he got into
[1:43:35] a circle uh uh what they call the march
[1:43:37] of
[1:43:38] death and he started going in circles
[1:43:41] going in
[1:43:42] circles and remember what happened he
[1:43:44] said he stopped and he prayed and he
[1:43:47] said Lord help me and he started walking
[1:43:49] with his hand up cuz there was a
[1:43:50] telephone line I believe that came down
[1:43:52] off the mountain that was a round hand
[1:43:54] height up here and he says if I can grab
[1:43:55] onto that I can follow it all the way
[1:43:57] down and he's saying I was lost wor and
[1:44:01] that he says I'll hold to the wire of
[1:44:02] his glory not rest on my own skill not
[1:44:05] rest on my own experience even my own
[1:44:07] Revelation I'll hold to the wire of his
[1:44:10] glory that leads from the cross to glory
[1:44:12] and trust him till I die for he has
[1:44:15] conquered what all my
[1:44:19] enemies church we cannot read this to
[1:44:22] say he has conquered all of your enemies
[1:44:25] he's conquered all of my
[1:44:29] enemies you have to say he's conquered
[1:44:32] my enemies for you personally he says
[1:44:35] he's conquered my sickness he's
[1:44:37] conquered my sins he's conquered my
[1:44:40] selfishness he conquered my ways and
[1:44:44] today I'm more than a conqueror in
[1:44:46] Christ Jesus who conquered for me for me
[1:44:50] this is not somebody else's relationship
[1:44:52] this is not somebody else's word this is
[1:44:54] my word and youve got to say it's my
[1:44:56] word as well it's your word it's for you
[1:44:58] amen it's got to be personal you know we
[1:45:00] look at the faith chapter in Hebrews 11
[1:45:02] and it seems there like the people are
[1:45:04] the faithful and true ones I was reading
[1:45:06] it last night Abel and Enoch and Noah
[1:45:08] and Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob Joseph
[1:45:10] Moses Rahab are all declared as Heroes
[1:45:13] of the faith but yet we know the reality
[1:45:16] of their stories we know they were not
[1:45:19] perfect we knew they slipped and fell we
[1:45:21] knew that they had shortcomings and
[1:45:23] failures and I'm not saying that to tear
[1:45:25] them down church I'm saying that to
[1:45:26] encourage you this morning because
[1:45:28] something else kept them going when they
[1:45:30] couldn't go themselves what was it it
[1:45:33] was a word promise that they laid hold
[1:45:35] of that was personal that was personal
[1:45:37] to them that's what kept them going when
[1:45:39] they didn't want to get up listen Joseph
[1:45:42] went from a pit to slavery to prison you
[1:45:45] telling me that he didn't have some some
[1:45:47] tough
[1:45:48] Ms and yet he served God in every
[1:45:52] situation he found himself in and he was
[1:45:55] found in abundance in all of those
[1:45:57] things what kept them going the word
[1:46:00] promised for their life and they laid
[1:46:02] hold of it and they believed it amen and
[1:46:04] that's what made the
[1:46:06] difference let me say it this way we've
[1:46:08] all
[1:46:08] failed we've all fallen short and that
[1:46:12] doesn't make a lick of difference to God
[1:46:15] hallelujah he doesn't
[1:46:17] care he doesn't care cuz he's already
[1:46:21] conquered he's already lived a sinful
[1:46:23] life he's already what given us a
[1:46:26] promise he swore an oath by himself he
[1:46:30] did not swear it based on your
[1:46:31] performance he did not swear it based on
[1:46:34] your Christianity he did not swear it
[1:46:36] based on your faithfulness but he said I
[1:46:38] am the only one I can trust and so I'll
[1:46:40] swear by myself they're going to make it
[1:46:44] Hallelujah that's where you're standing
[1:46:45] this morning is on his oath not on your
[1:46:47] oath we're oath Breakers if we're
[1:46:50] serious we're oath Breakers but his oath
[1:46:53] cannot fail because he swore by himself
[1:46:55] and he cannot lie he cannot fail
[1:46:59] amen his word is for us his word is to
[1:47:02] us but is not dependent on our
[1:47:04] Perfection or performance
[1:47:07] ever ever we're wrapped in Robes of his
[1:47:10] righteousness not our own amen he
[1:47:13] conquered and because he conquers we can
[1:47:15] do all things through Christ amen that's
[1:47:17] the power that keeps us going ahead it's
[1:47:19] him and us it's not me it's not my IPL
[1:47:23] it's not my power it's not my strength
[1:47:24] it's not my commitment it's the word
[1:47:26] inside of me that keeps pushing us even
[1:47:28] when I don't want to when you want to
[1:47:30] stop when you want to sit down by the
[1:47:32] side of the road when you just want to
[1:47:33] get away from it all there's something
[1:47:35] that keeps picking you up again and it's
[1:47:37] nothing less than the word of God inside
[1:47:40] of you by the power of the holy spirit
[1:47:42] amen he's faithful and
[1:47:45] true that's where our rest is Amen
[1:47:48] brother Bram said I'm not holding him
[1:47:50] he's holding me Hallelujah
[1:47:53] let me take it a bit further as we start
[1:47:56] to
[1:47:57] close we walk by faith amen we walk by
[1:48:00] faith and I think sometimes we can get
[1:48:03] this mentality that God doesn't
[1:48:05] understand the kind of pressure and the
[1:48:08] kind of struggle that comes with walking
[1:48:09] by faith why would God need
[1:48:13] Faith he's God all power all knowing
[1:48:18] knows the end from the beginning why
[1:48:19] does God need Faith but let me tell you
[1:48:22] God knows about faith because we see
[1:48:25] that Christ was willing to die because
[1:48:29] he had a promise that he would rise
[1:48:31] again remember it was God in Christ
[1:48:34] reconciling the world to himself God is
[1:48:36] in Christ God had to have faith Christ
[1:48:39] had to have faith on one scripture and
[1:48:42] he rested his entire Ministry his entire
[1:48:45] testimony on one scripture and it was
[1:48:48] this in Psalms it says for thou wil not
[1:48:50] leave my soul in hell and neither wil
[1:48:52] thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[1:48:54] corruption NOW Watch What Happens CU
[1:48:56] jesus takes this one scripture Church
[1:48:58] two lines and he bases his entire
[1:49:02] Ministry and testimony on that one
[1:49:05] scripture he hangs his soul he hangs his
[1:49:08] resurrection he hangs his future Kingdom
[1:49:11] on one
[1:49:12] scripture cuz if every one of them's
[1:49:15] right except that one he's
[1:49:18] toast based on one scripture on that
[1:49:21] scripture Jesus says this Jesus answered
[1:49:23] and said unto them destroy this Temple
[1:49:25] and in 3 days I will raise it up then
[1:49:28] said the Jews 46 years was this temple
[1:49:30] in building and you will rear it up in
[1:49:32] three days it says but he spoke of the
[1:49:34] Temple of his body so you will never
[1:49:37] find anywhere in scripture prior to this
[1:49:40] that the scripture promises that Jesus
[1:49:42] would raise in three days this is his
[1:49:44] prophecy it is not a scriptural prophecy
[1:49:48] but Jesus now knowing the science of the
[1:49:50] day if I could put it that way he knows
[1:49:52] that after after 72 hours corruption
[1:49:54] sets in and he says I know that
[1:49:56] corruption won't set in because I've got
[1:49:58] a word promised for it so therefore I
[1:50:01] can declare I will raise up within that
[1:50:03] three-day
[1:50:05] window that's where he gets it
[1:50:08] from he says I'm going to rise from the
[1:50:10] dead in three days because the scripture
[1:50:11] says I can't see
[1:50:13] corruption amen stop and think about
[1:50:16] that he came up with his own testimony
[1:50:19] his own proof his own challenge based on
[1:50:22] the word of God and he spoke those words
[1:50:24] he took the word promise of his body not
[1:50:26] seing corruption and said I'll rise
[1:50:27] again on the third day that took faith
[1:50:30] that took faith and then he went to
[1:50:32] Calvary laid aside his righteousness
[1:50:34] took a beating a whipping like no other
[1:50:36] man had then he went to the cross and
[1:50:38] purely based on psalm 16 he gave his
[1:50:43] life gave his life he did not lose it
[1:50:45] they did not take it the scripture says
[1:50:47] he gave it he laid it down on the
[1:50:50] promise that it would be picked up again
[1:50:53] amen he laid it down of his own free
[1:50:56] will in total faith that the word that
[1:50:58] he had lived by so far was the word that
[1:51:01] he would raise by we're under the same
[1:51:03] promise Church the word we live by is
[1:51:05] the word that's going to raise us up at
[1:51:06] the end he didn't just give his life
[1:51:09] church he gave his life knowing he was
[1:51:11] going to
[1:51:13] hell it's one thing if we could say I'm
[1:51:16] just going to go into a state of
[1:51:17] nothingness and I won't know anything
[1:51:18] and then but no he had to go to hell the
[1:51:22] promise was you'll go to hell but I
[1:51:23] won't let you see corruption he gave his
[1:51:25] life knowing what he was going
[1:51:28] into can you wrap your head around that
[1:51:30] kind of Faith you better because it's no
[1:51:33] less than the faith that you have
[1:51:35] today because we give our lives we give
[1:51:37] everything to this word we live by this
[1:51:40] word though it seems to hurt though it
[1:51:41] seems to cause us trouble and
[1:51:43] distraction and all these different
[1:51:44] things we give it because we have faith
[1:51:46] that in the end it will accomplish and
[1:51:49] prosper what God has sent it for
[1:51:52] but BR says this the great triumphant
[1:51:54] General who came down and the word made
[1:51:57] flesh took the word and defeated Satan
[1:51:59] on every ground and said you destroy
[1:52:01] this Temple I'll raise it up in the
[1:52:02] third day why David and the word said
[1:52:05] that I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:52:06] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:52:08] in hell and he knew that that was one
[1:52:11] promise of God that he'd be raised up
[1:52:13] and he took that word and went to death
[1:52:16] with it and knowing that word had to
[1:52:19] come to pass he says there's not one
[1:52:22] word word of God's promise that but what
[1:52:25] will come to pass he said heavens and
[1:52:27] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:52:29] not fail every promise is perfect he
[1:52:33] says and on that one promise in the
[1:52:35] scripture I'll not leave my Holy One to
[1:52:37] see corruption nor suffer him to see
[1:52:39] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:52:40] in hell he says now Jesus knew that
[1:52:42] corruption sets in the body after 72
[1:52:45] hours the nose falls in now the
[1:52:47] corruption sets in the body and David
[1:52:48] said by the Holy Ghost a man inspired
[1:52:51] the word of God coming to this Prophet
[1:52:53] said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:52:56] corruption he says and he knew before
[1:52:59] one cell would could would corrupt he'd
[1:53:01] be up out of the Grave he says why he
[1:53:05] was the word fortified by the word you
[1:53:09] say I'm the word what are you standing
[1:53:11] behind then if you're the word you'll
[1:53:14] get behind the word you'll be built on
[1:53:16] the word you'll be built up in the word
[1:53:18] the word comes to the word he says and
[1:53:20] he rose up he conquered death hell and
[1:53:22] the grave and himself come back in the
[1:53:24] form of the Holy Ghost to fortify the
[1:53:26] for this last day in this big ins
[1:53:28] slaught Onslaught where these great
[1:53:30] intellectual Giants are rising up and
[1:53:32] reasoning against the word he said but
[1:53:34] I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come
[1:53:36] again and be with you and I'll be in you
[1:53:39] again he said I'll pray the father he'll
[1:53:40] send you another comforter which is the
[1:53:42] Holy Ghost he will abide with you
[1:53:47] forever Hallelujah he says what is it
[1:53:50] the word gods are artillery in the human
[1:53:54] being Church you take the word in and
[1:53:57] it's quickened by the Holy Spirit and
[1:53:59] faith comes behind it he says it's God's
[1:54:01] artillery in the human being you are
[1:54:04] God's weapon against the kingdom of
[1:54:09] Satan think of it he says that great
[1:54:11] conqueror who conquered every sickness
[1:54:14] conquered every Superstition conquered
[1:54:16] every giant conquered everything there
[1:54:17] was to be conquered on Earth he died
[1:54:20] then and conquered hell conquered death
[1:54:22] conquered the grave conquered the
[1:54:23] atmospheres ascended up on high and come
[1:54:26] back in the form of the Holy Ghost he
[1:54:28] says and we are more than a conqueror
[1:54:30] through him that loved us church if
[1:54:32] that's what the power did then then what
[1:54:34] will the power do now it's the same
[1:54:37] power it's got the same overcoming
[1:54:39] elements in it I don't care what we're
[1:54:42] facing this is faithful and
[1:54:45] true he says what an
[1:54:48] army he's talking about you what an army
[1:54:52] what an army do you feel like an army
[1:54:54] this
[1:54:56] morning I've got some grins but do we
[1:54:59] feel like an army because this is what
[1:55:01] the Holy Ghost does is it turns you into
[1:55:03] a supernatural Army where the gates of
[1:55:06] hell can't Prevail against you you're an
[1:55:08] army says what an army like a mighty
[1:55:11] Army marches the Christian Soldier amen
[1:55:13] great Triumph he's in us not me he's
[1:55:17] already conquered it I don't have to do
[1:55:19] a thing but just believe him and walk on
[1:55:22] for He Is Risen he says the spirit is in
[1:55:25] us the great Victor the resurrection
[1:55:28] presence is in us we've raised from the
[1:55:30] things of the world from unbelief and
[1:55:32] Creeds to a living Christ with every
[1:55:35] Power of the enemy defeated you say
[1:55:36] brother I've been raised in the message
[1:55:38] it's still a Creed until Christ comes
[1:55:40] and lives in your heart and makes it
[1:55:41] live it's just an idea it's just a a
[1:55:44] fanciful thought but when he lives in
[1:55:47] you and makes it live in your life
[1:55:48] that's when it becomes a Living Word and
[1:55:51] it's a Creed otherwise
[1:55:52] he says even death itself is defeated
[1:55:54] hell's defeated the Grave's defeated
[1:55:57] every sickness is defeated amen he says
[1:55:59] it's not me a conquer he conquered it's
[1:56:01] not what I am it's what he is amen he
[1:56:04] says where is he at in me I've crossed
[1:56:07] from Death unto life Hallelujah ye who
[1:56:11] were dead in trespasses and sins hath he
[1:56:14] quickened and there's only one
[1:56:16] quickening power and it's the Holy Ghost
[1:56:18] amen Jesus risked his whole testimony
[1:56:21] his own
[1:56:23] his own Ministry on one scripture and
[1:56:25] said in 3 days I'll raise up you know in
[1:56:29] another portion of Matthew he says for
[1:56:30] as Jonas was three days and three nights
[1:56:32] in the whale's belly so shall the son of
[1:56:34] man be three days and three nights in
[1:56:35] the heart of the earth he said that but
[1:56:37] that was never said anywhere else he
[1:56:39] took psalm 16 and he turned it into his
[1:56:41] own
[1:56:43] prophecy it wasn't a new word it was him
[1:56:47] speaking his testimony based on the word
[1:56:49] that was already given amen I want to
[1:56:52] bring it down to where we're at living
[1:56:54] today because we're in the harvest
[1:56:55] season amen we're at the end of all
[1:56:57] things we're at the harvest season we're
[1:56:59] in the maturing season we're at the the
[1:57:01] final age the final group and it's the
[1:57:03] alpha becoming the Omega again Jesus
[1:57:05] said this verily verily I say unto you
[1:57:08] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:57:09] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:57:11] it die it abideth and bringeth forth
[1:57:14] much fruit Christ died he says I've got
[1:57:17] to die I've got to die if I don't die
[1:57:20] you can't rise so he died died and he
[1:57:22] rose again but he didn't just come as
[1:57:24] one person but he came back in the form
[1:57:26] of the Holy Spirit The Same Spirit that
[1:57:28] raised him from the dead and now that
[1:57:30] indwells every son and daughter of God
[1:57:33] the same power the same wheat the same
[1:57:36] Life Source the same DNA it's all within
[1:57:38] us amen and we're in the final age now
[1:57:40] where he's Gathering all of us in all of
[1:57:42] the mature weat into the
[1:57:44] Garners and he says it's time to go home
[1:57:47] and we're at the end of it all but Paul
[1:57:49] says this in Romans he says we know that
[1:57:51] all things work together for good to
[1:57:54] them that love God to them who are the
[1:57:57] called according to his purpose it's his
[1:57:59] calling it's his choosing not
[1:58:03] ours you've got to be
[1:58:06] called he says for whom he did Forno he
[1:58:09] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:58:12] the image of his son that he might be
[1:58:14] the firstborn among many Brethren we're
[1:58:16] talking faithful and true we're talking
[1:58:17] about the word will accomplish what it's
[1:58:19] set out to do he says says moreover whom
[1:58:22] he did predestinate them he also called
[1:58:25] and whom he called them he also
[1:58:26] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:58:29] also glorified church I don't care about
[1:58:32] the first two if I don't get to the last
[1:58:33] one I want to get all the way to
[1:58:35] glorification amen I want to get to a
[1:58:37] body change I want to get to a
[1:58:39] resurrection and a Rapture now brother
[1:58:41] Lonnie Jenkins spoke on this and I I
[1:58:43] hope it's okay this morning if I read
[1:58:44] his words because he says it better than
[1:58:46] I ever could but I want you to see how
[1:58:49] he grasped this thought on he whom he
[1:58:50] justified them he also glorified he says
[1:58:54] Jesus knew that the word of God was
[1:58:56] perfect and here we see whom he
[1:58:58] justified them he also glorified is all
[1:59:01] one sentence he says it's not whom he
[1:59:05] justified and will'll see how they do
[1:59:08] and put them to the test and if they
[1:59:10] really work out then we'll glorify
[1:59:12] them that's how we feel if we're honest
[1:59:16] sometimes he says it didn't say that
[1:59:18] it's the ones that he's called of course
[1:59:20] we know that many churches have people
[1:59:22] there that God didn't call they got
[1:59:24] there somehow but God didn't call them
[1:59:25] there he says but to all that God Called
[1:59:28] to the word to the revelation of their
[1:59:30] hour whom he justified he's already
[1:59:33] glorified he says so just rest in that
[1:59:36] and the word will do the work Church
[1:59:39] what an encouragement that ought to be
[1:59:41] this morning to the bride of Christ has
[1:59:44] anybody Fallen this week has anybody
[1:59:46] been in a battle and felt like they've
[1:59:48] made no progress maybe it feels like
[1:59:50] we've stepped back and we're sitting
[1:59:52] there saying I can't even win a battle I
[1:59:54] can't get past this I can't get past
[1:59:56] this situation I can't get past this
[1:59:58] habit I can't get past this complex
[2:00:01] whatever it is but what is he saying
[2:00:03] he's saying it doesn't matter where
[2:00:05] you're at you've already been glorified
[2:00:08] it's not resting on your performance
[2:00:10] it's resting on the fact that he said
[2:00:12] you're already glorified you are sitting
[2:00:15] in Heavenly places right now in Christ
[2:00:17] Jesus you're wrapped in the robe of
[2:00:19] righteousness you're under the blood of
[2:00:21] Christ you are sinless you are
[2:00:24] spotless you have already got a
[2:00:26] glorified body waiting for you he's not
[2:00:30] waiting for our performance to glorify
[2:00:32] us but he already has a body prepared
[2:00:36] waiting for you and God doesn't prepare
[2:00:38] a body if there's not somebody coming
[2:00:40] for it amen so he's not saying well then
[2:00:43] they pass the test then I'll decide if
[2:00:44] they're going to have a Heavenly Body
[2:00:46] there's a body already waiting Paul said
[2:00:48] there's a one already waiting for us if
[2:00:50] we pass from this place
[2:00:53] amen we've got a new body prepared for
[2:00:55] us why because he's seen the end from
[2:00:58] the beginning his word is in us and it's
[2:01:00] going to produce it it's the Faithful
[2:01:03] and True Word but where are we now we're
[2:01:05] in the cycle of the word of God and if
[2:01:08] we're honest and and we think about it
[2:01:10] see God's thoughts and God's ways are
[2:01:12] down and they're here with us and we've
[2:01:14] got an open book and we've got an open
[2:01:16] Word and the seals are open and we
[2:01:18] understand these things but the
[2:01:20] understanding is not what makes it
[2:01:22] happen it's the cycle of the word of God
[2:01:24] coming down the presence of God
[2:01:26] quickening life and then there's a
[2:01:28] rotting away and then after the rotting
[2:01:30] comes some growth and after the growth
[2:01:32] comes almost full maturity but when full
[2:01:34] maturity comes then the fruit produces
[2:01:37] and it's the same thing that Christ
[2:01:39] produced but the thing is I have
[2:01:41] portions in my life that are fully
[2:01:43] mature by God's
[2:01:45] grace they reflect Christ but guess what
[2:01:49] I've got spots that are still rotting
[2:01:51] and that's where the battle is as we
[2:01:53] look at the rotting rather than the
[2:01:54] fruit that's already there and we wonder
[2:01:57] how can we do it but the glorification
[2:01:59] is going on because I'm already
[2:02:00] reflecting the mirror of the word and
[2:02:02] the life of the word in my life in part
[2:02:05] but remember what Paul says in the end
[2:02:07] we're not just going to see it in part
[2:02:08] but we'll see him as he is for we will
[2:02:11] be as he is but they're still rotting
[2:02:14] because there's a cycle they're still
[2:02:16] watering they're still growing there's
[2:02:18] still a breaking forth
[2:02:22] and it's all God it's all Supernatural
[2:02:26] it's all his will it's all his way it's
[2:02:29] all his purpose there's nothing out of
[2:02:32] kilter every single portion listen we
[2:02:36] got some messy situations in our past we
[2:02:39] got some SI messy situations in our
[2:02:41] present I think of some of the ones
[2:02:43] we're praying for that have left the
[2:02:44] Lord it looks
[2:02:45] messy Rahab was really messy
[2:02:49] Church Ruth was messy
[2:02:53] Joseph was
[2:02:55] messy but God was in it
[2:02:58] nonetheless
[2:03:00] amen see there's a start and God chooses
[2:03:05] the start church I don't choose it and
[2:03:07] you don't choose it we would say why
[2:03:09] would God wait listen I I started
[2:03:11] preaching at 35 years old why did he
[2:03:14] wait so long I could have done so much
[2:03:16] more if he'd done like so many others
[2:03:17] and started me in my 20s but this his
[2:03:20] choosing it's his calling it's his
[2:03:22] placing it's his working I clearly
[2:03:25] needed more work than most men
[2:03:27] do but that's God and God has a way of
[2:03:30] doing these things amen Jesus himself
[2:03:33] had to go through the things that we go
[2:03:34] through the scripture says that he
[2:03:36] increased in stature and favor with God
[2:03:39] and man he increased he did not start at
[2:03:42] the peak he started down here like the
[2:03:44] rest of us and he grew in it all and he
[2:03:46] produced a mature fruit in his life Paul
[2:03:49] continues he says what shall we then say
[2:03:51] to these things
[2:03:52] if God be for us who can be against
[2:03:56] us let me put it this way if the word
[2:03:59] says we're in we're
[2:04:01] in Hallelujah if the word says I'm a
[2:04:04] part of him then I'm there if the word
[2:04:06] says my name was written in the Lamb's
[2:04:08] Book of Life before the foundation of
[2:04:09] the world I'm in whether I see it or not
[2:04:12] whether I feel it or not even whether I
[2:04:14] believe it or not in this present moment
[2:04:17] you know the scripture says though we
[2:04:19] deny him he cannot deny himself why
[2:04:22] because we are a part of him we're a
[2:04:24] portion of him there's a word seed being
[2:04:26] expressed out of our lives and he cannot
[2:04:28] deny us cuz our names are written in the
[2:04:30] Lamb's Book of Life by the blood of
[2:04:31] Jesus Christ and they cannot be erased
[2:04:34] they cannot be erased amen if the word
[2:04:36] says I'm the elect bride of Christ who
[2:04:38] am I to argue the word says I'm the
[2:04:40] predestinated seed if I'm a part of the
[2:04:42] royal seed who am I to argue I say let
[2:04:45] God's word be truth and everything else
[2:04:47] be a lie amen Church don't fight it rest
[2:04:50] in it rest rest in it rest in the work
[2:04:53] amen take power take encouragement from
[2:04:55] the fact that he says you're not just
[2:04:57] Justified you're not just Sanctified
[2:04:59] you're already glorified it's a finished
[2:05:01] work from his standpoint and all we are
[2:05:03] is in the cycle of time but it's a
[2:05:06] faithful and true word and it's a
[2:05:08] faithful and true cycle
[2:05:10] amen and we've got to go through the
[2:05:13] cycle there's going to be
[2:05:15] rain Hallelujah we enjoy the rain don't
[2:05:17] we but after the rain comes rotting
[2:05:22] and that's the part we don't like but
[2:05:24] I'll tell you this if you've got rot in
[2:05:26] your life it's proof that you've
[2:05:27] received the word the way it was meant
[2:05:29] to be given CU it'll tear down this
[2:05:32] flesh it'll kill it it'll rot it and
[2:05:35] then it'll produce the Life of Christ
[2:05:36] amen then we're in seasons of growth now
[2:05:40] you look at these young boys that are
[2:05:41] growing a foot every week it seems like
[2:05:43] and what comes with growth Growing Pains
[2:05:47] things change real
[2:05:49] quick we like the fact that we're
[2:05:51] growing but often the growth doesn't
[2:05:53] feel so
[2:05:54] good but then you come now to the fruit
[2:05:57] bearing
[2:05:58] time and that brother Bram says is just
[2:06:00] laying in the presence of the sun that's
[2:06:03] getting in front of God and saying God
[2:06:06] let your word come
[2:06:08] forth amen and that's the resting you'll
[2:06:11] find that in that maturing with the
[2:06:13] wheat there's no more water going up to
[2:06:15] it it's already done it's a finished
[2:06:17] work and it just takes the presence of
[2:06:19] God takes the presence of the sun to
[2:06:21] bring that thing out completely he says
[2:06:23] he that spared not his own son but
[2:06:25] delivered him up for us how shall he not
[2:06:27] with him also freely give us all things
[2:06:29] he says who shall lay anything to the
[2:06:31] charge of God's elect it is God that
[2:06:33] justifieth we've already said he has
[2:06:35] already Justified it's a finished work
[2:06:37] amen church we don't have to answer
[2:06:39] Satan's accusations this morning if he's
[2:06:41] got it listen if you got something on
[2:06:43] your conscience repent turn around and
[2:06:47] walk the other way and that's all you
[2:06:49] have to do you don't have to explain it
[2:06:52] you don't have to answer for
[2:06:54] it it's God that justifies it's not
[2:06:57] Satan I don't have to answer Satan I
[2:06:59] don't have to give him satisfaction amen
[2:07:01] we claim the blood of Christ and we move
[2:07:03] forward he says who is he that
[2:07:05] condemneth it's Christ that died y
[2:07:07] rather that is risen again who's even at
[2:07:09] the right hand of God who also maketh
[2:07:11] intercession for us who who shall
[2:07:15] separate us from the love of Christ that
[2:07:17] word who means who or what he's saying
[2:07:21] nothing what is it out there who what
[2:07:24] circumstances whatever it might be it
[2:07:26] doesn't matter nothing's going to stop
[2:07:29] us he says shall tribulation distress
[2:07:33] persecution famine nakedness Peril or
[2:07:37] sword as it as is written for thy sake
[2:07:40] we are killed all the day long we're
[2:07:41] accounted as sheep for the slaughter he
[2:07:44] says nay in all these things we are more
[2:07:47] than conquerors how through him that
[2:07:50] loved us
[2:07:52] he says for I am persuaded church that's
[2:07:55] what the preaching of the word's
[2:07:56] supposed to do it's supposed to persuade
[2:07:58] you to let you see where you're standing
[2:08:00] this morning to let you see that your
[2:08:02] name's written there he says for I am
[2:08:04] persuaded can we say this morning I am
[2:08:08] persuaded amen I am persuaded that
[2:08:10] neither death nor life sometimes we'd
[2:08:14] almost wish we were dead that's why he's
[2:08:16] saying life won't stop us the the the
[2:08:18] cares of Life the situations of life and
[2:08:21] if if we pass on he says that won't stop
[2:08:23] it either nor angels nor principalities
[2:08:26] nor powers nor things present nor things
[2:08:27] to come nor height nor dep nor any other
[2:08:30] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:08:33] from the love of God which is in Christ
[2:08:35] Jesus our lord Hallelujah church that's
[2:08:39] where you stand today not you will stand
[2:08:43] where you stand today as we close he
[2:08:47] says when you find anything in the Bible
[2:08:49] hang your soul on it
[2:08:51] Jesus
[2:08:53] did he says it's the truth just stay
[2:08:56] right with what God promised God will do
[2:09:00] it amen God bless you let's stand each
[2:09:03] one amen can you say praise the Lord
[2:09:06] this morning amen I'm so thankful I'm so
[2:09:10] thankful for his goodness I'm thankful
[2:09:12] that he's faithful when I'm not faithful
[2:09:15] I'm thankful he's got answers when I
[2:09:17] don't have answers he meets the needs
[2:09:19] when I don't see the way I'm thankful he
[2:09:21] overrides me church that he does what he
[2:09:24] thinks best even when I've got an idea
[2:09:26] anden I'm thankful that he's faithful to
[2:09:28] his word you know we can get caught up
[2:09:31] in that idea that he's faithful to us
[2:09:32] but he's not faithful to us he's
[2:09:34] faithful to the word that's in us
[2:09:36] because this is all going away he's not
[2:09:40] saving that he's saving the soul that's
[2:09:41] on the inside that word that seed Gene
[2:09:43] of God that's in there that's what he's
[2:09:45] doing and he's preserving the life that
[2:09:47] he placed there before the foundation of
[2:09:49] the world Paul says nothing can separate
[2:09:51] us
[2:09:52] but what's our part our part is to
[2:09:55] believe and walk forward that's all he
[2:09:58] ever asked us to do believe and walk
[2:10:01] forward day by day listen we choose what
[2:10:04] we drink and we choose what we eat don't
[2:10:06] we that's a day byday choice and that's
[2:10:09] going to determine whether you bring
[2:10:11] fruit or whether you get prickly like a
[2:10:13] cactus it's going to determine whether
[2:10:15] you bring forth beautiful blooms or
[2:10:16] whether you sit there and Wilt and
[2:10:18] everything Fades away and you're no good
[2:10:19] for anything that's the choice we we
[2:10:21] have our feeding is the choice we have
[2:10:24] but it's up to God to give the increase
[2:10:26] it's up to God to produce it inside of
