congregation but I was going to say we've got people from out west but everything's West from here pretty much so all the way from the west coast of Canada brother Jim duly to the western coast of Newland and into New Brunswick and all these ones and down into Arizona you know each one I'm not going to name names because I'll forget one I know but I just want to welcome each one of you personally here we sure appreciate the fellowship we appreciate the support amen and we're here to have a wonderful time in his presence amen these are our dedication meetings to thank the Lord for this building amen but what matters most is where he dwells day by day and it is not in buildings made of stone and brick and wood but it's in the hearts of souls that are dedicated to him so we're here to just enjoy ourselves and you know I was reading in devotions in John 8 where Jesus said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life this is the darkest of darkest ages remember when that angel showed the seven Church ages there was no light in that last age and brother Brandon by permission put in that little bit of light to represent you and I that's how dark it is but Christ promised us you'll have the light of life and he would say that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and he said if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed we've got all sorts of people offering us things these days but he says when I set you free you're truly free now I have no idea what brother Jerry's going to preach this evening but I'm so glad he came this way and brother Jerry's a pastor in in Edmonton Alberta and if you know anything about brother Jerry he only travels to Africa or he stays home but he's here so I think we're the Africa of Canada perhaps but he graciously came out here all the way the last English-speaking Nation you know and then once you cross over they start to speak other languages but I'm so thankful to have him here this evening we want to welcome him we want to welcome the presence of the Lord we want to pull on the gift uh he told me it's going to be something pastoral that's all I know uh we met him at the airport yesterday exchanged pleasantries gave him some food and sent him on his way so I haven't talked to him about anything um he knows nothing about anything in anybody's life here so if he hits you hard today it's the presence of the Lord speaking to hearts and souls and I pray he hits me hard amen I pray that I know without a shadow of doubt that the Holy Spirit has been here to minister to my need this evening amen let's not get offended let's not get hurt let's get encouraged and say Lord It's the light of your life that's coming my way to help me along in this darkness that he that that we're we're walking through these days and when you Set Me Free Lord I'll be truly free then that's what I want I want to be set free by the sun this evening amen I want whatever he'd have for me that would encourage me that would correct me that would direct me that would heal me that would change me more and more into his likeness this evening amen so let's sing that song 12:15 draw me draw me Lord and I'll come running back to you amen and let's just welcome the Lord Jesus Christ into our service this evening as brother Jerry would come I said take your Liberty we're well trained he asked me how long I normally preach I said it varies wildly so he's in he's in good company tonight however long he would want to go he'll take the service tomorrow night as well Lord willing but we just want to pull on that gift let him know you're here let the devil know whose side you're on Amen we're here let's make the most of it and let's let the Lord have a work in our lives this evening amen God bless you each one let's sing this as he [Music] comes you alone are all I [Music] need for you hold my Destin you alone are all I need in you alone I am complete [Music] draw amen amen God bless you Saints amen it's good to be here just want to say that I'm thankful brother Jonathan uh actually invited me I was kind of surprised when he invited me here about 3 or four months ago or maybe it was January but anyways I said I'll pray about it and prayed about it and here I am and I just want to say that I thank the Lord for what he's done for us in this day and age that how he's opened up the revealed word to us because without Christ in our life we have nothing friends and when when brother Jonathan uh said that he'll make you a new creation make you means creation I'm a new creation here tonight I'm not just passed over but I'm just waiting for my body change and I want to go in the Rapture do you not friends the thing is that we're not here just to play Church we're here to actually become the word the see the word is based off manifestation it's not based on discussion it's not based on debate it's based on manifestation and we want to manifest the word in this day see when we actually really know who we are then all of a sudden everything else goes away we are the word made flesh in this day we are the broadc coming of Christ amen I want to welcome or I want to say to to brother uh Jonathan too and for sister Marine that they met us at the airport last night and got some goodies I sister maren gave us some goodies there and it was really nice uh I like those things because I like food as you probably see amen amen you ready for some preaching gu turn to First John 4:16 I'll get out of the way and just let God have his way because I've been praying about these meetings and I've been praying about thank you musicians I've been praying about these meetings I'm just because when you start coming down this line of thought and you're trying to get the mind of God it's not that you don't have uh know what you're going to pre or have uh subject to preach on it's just what to preach on see because the thing is there's so many things in the message and so many things in the scripture to preach on but you have to get to a place where the mind of God actually comes on the scene and I Pray by God's grace I can have the mind of God here tonight and speak something to you God bless you brother Dale it's good to see you amen uh used to live right by us but God bless him he went to the other side of the world I was talking to a brother from Africa and he and I told him I'm going to dedication means he said where is that I new land he how far it is it away and I said 61 100 km he says what country is that in I said it's still in Canada amen amen let's read from verse 46 here and we have known and believe the love of God and ha to that God have to us God is Agy love now we know there's several different meanings to this word love one of them is brotherly love and he goes on God is love and he that that dwelleth in love now it's not just separate from love but God is love and the believer or the Born Again believer dwelleth in love and so he dwelleth in Love Actually dwelleth in God so it's not just a in and out in and out you dwell in the love as a saint of God I call it the inner sanctum Sanctuary inside not just you come in and come out you're in at all the time he that dwelleth in go in love and God in him and here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so just a second here okay there it is there is no fear in love but perfect love castes out fear now fear it can be tormenting but perfect love moves in and casts that out because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love let's just just have a word of prayer heavenly father as Lord Jesus as we look at this word tonight father we want you Lord Jesus to come on the scene father we come Father Here Lord expecting and Lord we're going to get what we expect and father we want more of you Lord Jesus than we've ever had before father I just want to yield myself get myself out of the way let you Lord take over granted I pray I ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats So speaking on this and looking at some of these things and love is not something that you just project but actually the believer of this day and age because you know the everything that was in the bridegroom is in the bride in the last days we not just project love we are love because God is love so if you're in God you're actually dwelling in love so we got to understand is that love is actually you here tonight as a as a Believer love is actually you here as a Believer and I want to get these point at across to you because to understand it's about it's about perfect love not perfect Doctrine perfect love because every because we can emphasize many things in this message we emphasize things that we like we emphasize Doctrine we emphasize maybe you know gifts we emphasize this we we can emphasize a lot of things in this in this message because we can pull our quotes out the quotes that we actually like but if we don't have perfect love it doesn't do you no good see it's not about having the perfect Doctrine because you can have perfect Doctrine and not have perfect love you can have an understanding and you know of knowledge and Mysteries and we'll get into that tonight but I just want you to understand see fear is not cast out by death fear is cast out by perfect love see we can and I'm not talking about just natural fear when you you know you might be scared of spiders or scared of snakes and stuff like that and you have fear of that but I'm talking about tormenting fear fear that actually torments you you come to church and you're tormented by by things that that you may be gone through and it's just tormenting and the fear is not just cast out by just putting on your message uniform and coming to church and sitting there and say I'm a message believer see it's not about just believing something it's actually about having C having perfect love and cast out that fear see the only way fear is cast out is by perfect love he realized when job lost everything the Bible says and he says what I feared Came Upon me so it was actually something that was actually became a part of him he dwell on those things and they actually he feared those things and they came upon him it's just like Peter when when Jesus talked about you know or the scripture talks about when he got out of the boat and walked on water see he lost substance after he begin to sink something actually took a hold of him and he feared now brother bam tells us the thing is is that what the church can't move on without getting rid of this fear and he says the greatest curse I'm going might get into it tonight but the greatest curse to the church is that reason why they can't operate is because they fear you say well I I I don't fear I believe the word see it's not about just believing the word it's just it's about casting out fear through perfect love see because fear can't enter in if you have perfect love it cannot actually trespass into perfect love if you have you know if you have perfect love so to have the understanding it's actually a mature love now you know the realm that we're talking about here is a realm that you cannot get by just coming to church and hearing the word it's not just by something that you can just believe on it it's something out of this world because we all have human love we got a certain standard of human love but when we're talking about perfect love we're talking about God's love it's something that is you know because you're sitting here tonight because you've been influenced by something something actually took place in your life that you influenced you and Drew you close to the word see but the thing is is that this type of love that I'm speaking of comes in different degrees see it's just like if you if you type it naturally and you type it to the spiritual side see friends the thing is is that when you're born again and birth in the word you have baby love you begin to start out in the spiritual walk and then you move up maybe to adolescence or Teenage Love and then you come to an adult love and what is it it's a mature grownup love it's a love that friends the thing is is that it matures you it has gives you understanding it gives you knowledge our problem is and and I'll tell you what you know brother brother R say and we'll get into this but our problem is we don't trust enough we don't have confidence enough in the word you say I believe the word I believe the word all those things but understand this how much trust or confidence do we actually have in the word we say I got all the confidence until something happens something happens in your life and all of a sudden you start to try to sort out you try to put things together work your problems out and and still we have the testimony I believe the word and we have and I thing is Jesus says oh oh ye of little faith and what is he saying you have little trust so what we have to understand here is that the emphasis that we should have an understanding this because before we can have a body change you have to have mature love you have to have this perfect love I love a grown up type of Love here's what brother Bram says and I'll and and we'll quote this a couple times here but to understand is that he this is after he went uh into the sixth Dimension and uh and he came back and he and he begin to say what it was like over there he says that he says thus sayith the Lord he said it will take perfect love to put you in that place he said for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religious demonstrations message uniforms hey friends I'm a Holiness preacher don't get me wrong I believe that but you can have all that and not have perfect love you can be bitter and be dressed right and you can even have quotes and speak right and have scripture right but if you don't have perfect love you're not going to go anywhere he says he says no matter how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you done or whatever You' done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do whatever you do you lay a beside everything else and I know we know this quote off by heart but I just want to get us on the same page here until you are so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you now we're a church body here right can you love everybody on this degree come on friends we we we we say we're message Believers like told brother Jonathan it's going to be pastorial here because it's going to go get down to the nitty-gritty where we're actually at we can sing the nice songs great wonderful we can praise the Lord raise our hands and all the stuff but we can't stand our brother next to us you can't go in without perfect love I don't care how much perfect Doctrine you have you can't go in on perfect love now watch again in first John and we'll go over the scripture here just just to understand this herein is our love made perfect now friends the thing is we know these words and the words were actually you know a translat from Greek from Hebrew into English King James version that we read right it was it was translated in 1611 but the thing is it's not about catching the letter it's actually about catching the spirit of it what God is trying to convey to the church what God is trying to tell us here because the English language is quite descriptive or is not as descriptive as other languages right now some of you might know different languages here I don't know where you're from some of you probably from Africa if you're from east side of Africa bana aab bur means God bless you and Swahili that's about as much African I know but I understand this is that the thing is is you know the languages that we take we we take a word but it doesn't really give the context to it see but we want to understand the context to it because now when the word is used perfect verse 17 and verse 18 they have two different means see because the same word but has different means so hear in is our love made perfect which means finished fulfilled to make perfect to complete to carry through completely add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full so it's got to be a full perfect love a fullness not just your third Doctrine understanding not just the Mysteries let me we'll get into something here friends watch here it is our love made perfect he said that we may have boldness in the day of judgment your your life your the the the dwth of perfect love that you have you will have boldness on the day of judgment why you have the same love as Jesus Christ not a different love the same actual love that he has when he was hanging on the cross when he was being crucified and he said forgive them for they know no what they do that type of love he had perfect love and remember friends Jesus was just as flesh as you and I were he was virgin born but friends the thing is is that he died as a man he had emotions in tied into him he had all things tied into him even though he's virgin born but friends the thing he felt the same way you felt so have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world now not in the future not the not not in the you know not in the future home not in the Millennium right now as he is so are we where are we in the scale like I said teenage love baby love adult love we can actually look on a scale of our lives and see where we're actually love now in verse 18 He says there is no fear in love but perfect same English word but look at the word perfect in this one it says man of full age it's grown up it's adult not baby form not teen form not adolesence form but a grownup form brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness full grown adult full age mature so John is actually writing this in a degree of different you know degrees of love and he finishes up with a adult love a grownup love so not a baby love not a teenageer but a full mature love so let's look at this a little bit so you know which where I'm going here he said there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out out fear same word you used for casting out Devils so we need to be cast out of our fear amen we need to be cast because it says cast out to throw or let go of a thing without caring where it falls in other words perfect love has an aggressive attribute it casts out fear it doesn't play around with it it doesn't think about it it just takes it and throws it out it don't care where it lands see because because it's your enemy is fear is not your friend in any way shape or form that's why brother Bram can say the things he said he said the church won't move on it's because they have fear now listen now perfect love friends when we look at perfect love we think well you know I'm just going to be right in because I believe this message but friends the thing is there's got to be an out perfect love in you before we get out of here because we talk about rapturing faith but that we have an understanding what rapturing faith actually involves see because perfect love actually gets rid of fear so it casts us out so we got to get to a place where we have an understanding of what we need to do because the word has been the message has been here for many many years 60 some years but how come we still don't understand what fear actually does to us is because we don't understand perfect love to understand where we need to get to we got to understand what love is God is love we need to be taught love you got human love that's not I'm talking about we're talking about the God's love so this fear is opposite of perfect Faith or perfect love so this perfect love cast out fear so this fear don't want nothing nothing to do with it I don't want nothing to do with fear I want fear in my life he says where there is there is no fear in love but perfect love cast fear because fear hath torment perfect love doesn't have it if you're tormented here right here tonight it's because you fear something you fear something I fear I'm going to miss the Rapture I'm fear I'm going to have a not have a B I fear this I fear that I Fe some people even fear coming to church because what the preacher is going to preach but they don't understand that's why you don't have to understand what love is God will always reach out to you and show you what these things are because perfect love does not have torment love is Cap love is only capable of growing and growing in God's love see it's the same Principle as Faith understanding trust with many of the Divine Natures of God see friends it's having trust in God having confidence in God now God is the essence of perfection there's nothing more perfect than God himself now can I say this to you so you you can grasp this you realize you're the second coming of Jesus Christ you realize friends the thing is you are the very Rapture and what God does with his church with his bride he shows you something so you can grow into it he doesn't waste his time there's nothing more perfect than God God's it God is love that's why he will take time and he'll bring you to imp Perfection that's why he's involved in our lives see he doesn't separate himself from you see it's not just about your testimony but he'll show you how show you how you should grow see what it is for as he you know brother bam talks it starts out with a small button let me just say it this way God's you know brother man explains he said love is like a is a big ocean and it goes down to a river then it goes down to a creek then it goes down to a stream and then it goes even to a capful so if you had an experience with God friends the thing is there was God's love reaching out to you and it might want any capful but it grows from there it might grow from a to a creek or to a stream or to a river or you know I I don't think I'll ever get to an ocean but I'm still a part of God so I have the love of God see but the problem is we don't have trust and confidence in his word we say we do until something happens all of a sudden something happens your spouse dies your brother dies your sister dies your child dies and all of a sudden things happen in your life and what it does it just destroy you put you flat in your back what is it God's trying to prove to us we need to trust and have confidence in him see that's why people they whine and complain they murmur they come to church it's too cold it's too warm it's on this and on what is it because they're still in baby form I believe I believe that the bride of Christ are going to fulfill the scripture of a body change I don't believe they're going to be murmuring complaining I don't believe they're going to have any fear in them I do believe they're going to have perfect love see because the thing is a baby they'll stop their feet when they don't get their way when they don't get their way in church everybody with me see what it is and God might you might be I've been there for years and years years but God might rebuke you because it's been a long time because you got little faith you got little love you got little trust and you got a little confidence in his word yeah I need to grow up how do you grow up brother Jerry consecrate your life more consecrate your life more to the things of God see because it comes in various degrees if we could take your life and put it up here on a chart what would it look like what would it be what what would it be would it be up and down I love this time but I hate the next time that's just filial love you know the thing is that little faith or little trust little coment be God wants to achieve this perfect love in us he already has it because he is love but he wants to achieve it into his church into his bride he wants to achieve these things our problem is that we compare one another we compare to one another we compare ourselves how's this brother doing how's this sister doing you realize the Bible says don't do that don't compare yourselves to one another see be what God Made You see friends the thing is I'm not your example brother Jonathan's not your example see one another is not your example Christ is our example that's who we depend on our desire is to be what God wants for us to be you know when brother bam gave us description of the different Apostles they had different attributes to them you have Andrew who was a prayer War he had Peter that was you know a man of Faith you know so to speak but John here he has a real understanding of what love is and and and it went so deep and you know if you looked at the other disciples you would look like they're not even Christians but John had a deepness of love and understanding what was actually about and the thing is that you look at look at the different disciples and different ones but even today when you look at yourselves there's certain attributes in us that we're strong in but there's certain attributes that we're not strong in I want to be strong in the love of God because I know friends the thing is is that God will equip us and be content to one another as a body Believers here we're a church see compliment one another you know not you know just not talking against each other not just putting other each other down and not being jealous where there's Strife strife and jealousy will not excel in in the kingdom of God only love for one another I'm talking about this perfect love see it's god-given see I you know friends the thing is I didn't give it you didn't give it God Alone can only give it this what brother Bram says perfect love castes out fear the reason you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet you've never entered in to that right Temperance of Love see the right Temperance of love has never entered it so this is the key to me we can say we love the Lord and yet we're so fearful about so many things and the reason why that is is because we don't have the right temp of love and you try to replace it maybe you say well I'm going to believe a certain doctor maybe you're going to listen to more tapes and and read more books nothing wrong with any of that but the thing is that still doesn't give you the right amount of temperance you might even have the right theology you might have the right understanding of the third pole but we're talking about perfect love not perfect Doctrine you might be a theologian here tonight I don't know I I've been serving the lord for 40 years now I've read the message over and over I've read the church ages you know thoughtfully over over in easily 20 times I study this message but that does not give me perfect love see the thing is is that there's nothing like it you know you know you may come to church and somebody might do something against you how do you react how are you to one another see because that's why people they can sit under a great ministry a third pole Ministry a Ministry that so so move you and you still might not have the right Temperance of love can you shake a Brother's hand can you say God bless you Sister you can't do that this this what is that you don't have the right right right Temperance of Love see what it is friends we need to enter a place that where he dwell and then only dwells in perfect love see because friends we got to be willing to do these things that's why people go in the prayer closet and feel religious over it I said my prayers today okay Catholics I know there are some Catholics here I was raised a Catholic too we said our prayers but I wanted to know what time the hockey game was on after I had the rosary down pat I know we would have pray me means at my my home when I grew up it was 6 minutes to 8 and the hockey game started at 8:00 I knew the rosary took 7 minutes I knew that but people can go in their prayer closet they can have all kinds of you know outward things that happen all those things but never change in that place of perfect love where actually dwell and they'll feel religious but God isn't hard up he's not going to compromise on his word in the end time he demands perfect love because he is love I want to be like God I want to be because friend Hugh said there's going to be a bride in the last days everything that happens to the bridegroom is going to happen to the bride she's going to have perfect love just like Jesus Christ said he doesn't want quality I mean quantity he wants quality so people think that they can get away with everything just by believing the message it's more than that friends it comes in degrees it grows in you now watch this we go over this real quick here he said wherefore if God so close the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast in the oven shall he not not much more clothe you o e of little faith OE of little trust that's what that means I don't have the confidence I got to do it myself so they so they move away from church and go somewhere there's no church nothing to feed their soul what is it they have little faith they trusting is so small see this so it's not just believing it's trusting Jesus never said Do you believe me they believed them you have to believe you have to have trust in him confidence in his word what he's actually giving you see it's saying you don't trust me so he's talking about us he's telling the church you don't really trust me so therefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which is today is tomorrow is casting into the oven shall he not much more clothe you so God asks us trust me have confidence in me watch this this is Peter of course he said immediately and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of trusting little faith trusting he trust him a little only trust God a little wherefor didst thou doubt now Peter's been with Jesus for a while here for three years and Jesus saying you have little trust in me you have little confidence in me goes on again when Jesus heard he Marvel and said unto them he Marvin said unto them that F that follow verily I say unto you I have not found so great a faith which means large abundant intense so what is what's what I'm showing here it's growing it grows in degrees it grows and gets larger and larger you might have started out with a little faith but I you might believe God more than you've ever believed him now friends I've been serving the lord I believe God more than I've ever believed him now before I have trusted him more I have confence it more see because it's not so only so far it's all the way the full we all believe the fullness of the word came back in this day right we can show you the man oh God sent a prophet fullness of the word came back but it's the fullness of the word on display on your life where you have trust in him friends the thing is that if you have trust trust in him you will have full Victory if you have confidence in the word you will have full you will have victory in your life but it's our trust Factor see people just stay in the status quo come to church be a message believer hear the quotes go home get in the regular life that's status quo there's a lot of message people like that but understand this friend God wants us to grow up farther than that he doesn't want us just to be a church goers he doesn't want us just be church members he doesn't want us just to be message Believers he wants to grow up in US amen he said that Jesus answered said un unto her a oh woman great is thy faith he said be it unto thee even thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so it comes in degrees so the love can come the same degree now watch and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered in thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet but sheath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of the head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou did not anoint but this woman haveth no anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I said unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loveth much but to whom little is for given the same loveth little now who are these people that Jesus is talking about they're Pharisees we all know that but they're Prophet quoting people they could quote Moses inside out but what do they miss the word made flesh that's what they miss we can miss the same thing we' be proph quing people and Jesus can walking in here right and sit right by us but missed the whole picture of it see understand this is that this is why they were looking at themselves I'm a pretty good guy I go to church I don't drink I don't steal I don't lie they thought they were pretty good this woman didn't think she was good she knew something had to be changed in her life she knew God how to get in in her life see because understand this see a person that thinks they're a pretty good person will never love much legalization legalization can only go so far you can legalize yourself to death but it can only go so far your self-righteous becomes greater than the love of God and that's what I don't want I don't want my self-righteous to become greater than the word of God I want the love of God to come out of my life see because the thing is I'm a person that was born lost I needed to be saved I wasn't a good guy I know that I know I God had an influence my I know God had to come down and do something in my life I know that so it went beyond my self-righteous I needed God and until you know you truly truly need him and go beyond your self-righteousness I dress right I have the message uniform I come to church I hear the word but what about the love of God what about the per perfect love of God because the thing is is that we need to understand God is full of Mercy he still delivers amen he still delivers you look at this woman see what is she doing she's actually recognizing what she needed friends a Believer who can experience God's love toward you can actually understand the love of God and you can grow in that see he can go beyond just John 3:16 and go beyond just believing that God said a prophet it can go beyond that because what it's happened is that you can actually enter into a place where God is in the inner sanct but some people friends just like coming to church and hearing the quotes I want more I want more I don't know about you but I want more than that see I want to Ender in that place where friends it's just him and me see because naturally you can do good things and the thing is that you you can be a good person person sitting here tonight you might never smoke you might never swore you might never drink but if you don't know you need more of God then you're in a bad shape I need more God see I need more than just this friendship I just don't have a friendship love with him it's an Earnest it's a love for him a deep Earnest that I need more of him that friends the think is I'm just not come to church just to you know see other people I'm coming to church to for him to feed me to tell me some something that I actually need that's why love can actually go and and and the perfect love of God can actually do something in my heart where I can love my brother more than anything back to that quote again thus sayeth the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done whatever you've done he said thou won't count for nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so what whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you now these are dedication meetings right the true character of any church is the people right so Paul here in Corinthians he cast catches the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and he catches from the Divine Fountain of the Divine love and remember friends when Paul went to the Corinthians see they were people that were Harlot from the Harlot system you know all kinds of sexual sins all kinds of garbage in them Paul didn't even want to go to Corinthian but the Holy Ghost told him I have seed down there see but you know friends the thing is Paul's going to write to the Church of Corinth and the church has a lot of problems in the Corinth see they have good points but they also have good bad points their bad points they ran each other down they gossip about each other they had the Christian spot in church but they go back to their homes and they ran each other down read the read read what brother B talks about when about the Corinthian Church and he said they had gifts but gifts never helped them in their perfect love issues they had issues in the church now friends I've been pastoring for 20 years now and I know churches and you're still human here tonight I don't see angel wings I don't see Halos over you I don't see that if you got a Halo on you God bless you but remember friends there's things that happen in churches and friends the thing is people can act so holy but I'm just trying to tell you when Paul begin to write to the Corinthian Church because they had Miracles they had signs they had tongues they had wonders they had all those things and Paul's inspired to bring the view of what perfect love is so we can all sit here we can say how spiritual we are how grown up we are but watch what Paul writes about let's re look at this Expos Exposition he said though I speak with the tong of men and angels and have not which is the same word John uses about goel love and I have not God's love charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol now let me ask you something Have you ever talked in angels tongues have you ever heard Angel's tongues besides on tape brother Braham my my wife has but she would never say that's that that that that's the love of God in her room one night praying for one of her boys God came down this the way way brother bam displays it and begins to speak through her and she's speaking in another tongue that she doesn't even know and the thing is but after that she would never say I have the perfect love of God because it was the years ago thank God that God got a hold of their lives but understand this is that Paul is stress addressing to the church according to their needs see because the real because people were saying well we got the gifts we're more spiritual we're done speak with tongues of men all these different things and and it fall among and would actually happened to them but Paul's trying to tell them you're nothing remember they're a poor City they got heartest coming they got all the different all kinds of different languages coming into the through through them and the thing is very Supernatural they see tongues of angels they got tongues of man they got all these things happening and Paul's telling them you know we would look at this and say this person is a spiritual spiritual person will we not but Paul's saying no they're not what's he trying to show us what actually the true love of God is because the thing is is that what the thing is that they we got to check our emphasis what their emphasis was was the gifts in that day but what's our emphasis now our emphasis is not the gifts but our emphasis is how deep we actually are and we think that is going to get us in the Rapture but that's not the requirement it's not the requirement brother Bram never said that the Bible doesn't say that but the thing is people can be so spiritual and can't even talk to their brothers they can't even love their brother can't love their sister properly and the thing is we think we're so spiritual but imagine there's the these gifts going on and Paul comes along see you become nothing but a sounding brass or a tickling symbol see what is a symbol a symbol is just an instrument in a in a band or drum set and the thing is that it makes all kinds of sound they say the symbol is really hard to make I don't know much about it but I looked it up real quick here but it has to give a certain sound see but symbols can't say words symbols can just beat on and sometimes that's the way we are talk this quote talk that quote talk this quote but when something comes against us something comes against us we change see because friends the thing is many of us need to have trained of what the spirit of God is saying to us because he who has an ear and a spiritual ear that actually hears what the spirit is saying is a blessing that's not saying well you heard the quotes you hear the grammar you hear all those things that's not what it's say friends it's actually having an understanding of what the spirit of God is trying to say to us so Paul's here he's telling them that's not perfect love and you go down to verse two and said though I have the gift of Prophecy now we know balum prophesied right and we know cus prophesied C keesus actually called for called forth the death of Jesus and Paul saying though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries now we all believe all the Mysteries been revealed have we not but does that make you have perfect love not according to what Paul said here you going understand all the ministry you can understand all third pole you can understand this you can understand Seven Seals Church eight you can understand all those things but if you don't have the perfect love of God you have nothing remember I just read you that quote we believe that's a Vindicated Prophet don't we not put all things aside put all things aside so here all I understand all men iies so we can stick out our chest and say how spiritual we are rattle off this and rattle off that and rattle off this and know this and understand this and understand this s and Paul says if you don't have charity or you don't have perfect love if you don't have that gopel of love you're absolutely nothing I know this is simple that word Mysteries hidden things Secrets only given to the initiate not ordinary Mortals hidden purpose or a secret will miss refer to the Deep counsel of God through the secrets but now reveal with Supernatural wisdom to understand all secrets of God so you can be endowed with all the mysteries of God here tonight but you can't stand people something wrong it's where we put the emphasis on our life because the thing is people just rattle things off but the thing is is that they don't they don't have what God requires because we think God requires certain things but I just read you the quote it's perfect love that's what he requires that's why friends the thing is when I speak about these things you know understand all Mysteries a man could be one of the best preachers in the message and I've met people of course things go on behind closed doors I know about preachers I know tons about preachers some preachers are so bitter against other preachers so bitter against people and I'm how does that match and these people can preach they can preach like you've never heard anybody else and they stand up here not here but Stand Up In a Pulpit and you say wow they know their stuff but behind the scenes they hate people they can't stand people and the thing is they can solve everybody's problem in the message if you're just giving them M if I go through this P I'll solve all the problems friends the thing is that they're full of themselves that's why preacher can focus on these things and go down certain Avenues but be so bitter and we think it's so trival if a preacher comes in and it's so surface but I say does that person have perfect love to love people remember brother Braham loved people remember I want the same spirit that was in that man because the thing is they said he'd walk up and down the streets and nobody would know who his enemy was because he treated everybody the same I want to be that type of person don't you I might hate brother Bob's guts but he'll never know it I'm just kidding amen I can pick on him but we can get so deep and so besides ourselves so and and we know all things but understand this understand all Mysteries all Mysteries and and and all and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge so these are the deeper things of God we understand the Mysteries but guess what friends the thing is God might show you those things but he can show you those things without you have perfect love it's amazing to me imagine a person can prophesy person speak in tongues a person that knows the Mysteries a person that knows prophets all these different things all the knowledge and Spell bound the people and still don't have Godly love and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains I have not charity copy I'm nothing because most people think of Charity soup suppers good will coffee to the homeless feeding the poor donations to Charities nothing wrong with any of that but you can do that without perfect love you can do that without God's love see because when Paul's talking about he's talking about the manifestation of the word in a person's heart coming out from a person see because like I said the word is based on manifestation it's not based on what we know it's got to manifest the love of God in the bride remember brother Bon says the world is starving for love he said there will be nobody like the Bride of Jesus Christ they'll actually have the love of God see I met so-called spiritual people they might have some gift of uh of discerning so somewhat and they'll discern prophesy all these different things but they get to a place where there's something and the thing is that friends the thing is people they get jealous of one another they look down at one another and the thing is they're not even in Christ because they love to emphasize how spiritual they are how wonderful they are how great they are if you're that type of person friends you you need to get out of your baby stage and grow up a little bit see we love to emphasize certain parts of the word certain quotes certain doctrines certain scriptures because much of it goes with their makeup a person that's not emotional they like the scripture be still and know I'm God they love those then the other one is about raise your hands give him a hand clap Rejoice we pick our quotes because it's according to our makeup I'm not an emotional person so they pick the ones that are un emotional then the ones that are emotional pick up the emotional quotes which quotes are right both are right but we do those things because we think that's spiritual but friends the thing is if you don't have perfect love then you have nothing let me just say it this way if you don't have perfect love to towards your wife oh we should have a marry seminar here is if you don't have perfect love towards your wife you don't have perfect love towards your husband there's a problem listen friends husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church he doesn't say that the other way around he says there only one way don't be bitter against them you know why they're the weaker vessel amen oh we can really pound on our wives sometimes with our words just Yap away and away because you know but friends the thing is they're a weaker vessel in us so maybe you got signs maybe you got prophets I'll get off that see you look at the cian Church they were actually mean to one another read brother brother BR said they're actually mean they were actually uncaring to one another but they they thought they were spiritual they thought they knew things they're arrogant they're indifferent so Paul how to speak them on a level of perfect love though I have the gift of Prophecy though I understand all mystery all the knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountain and not and have not charity I am am nothing charity means Love In Action we might love certain things but love is action not simply emotion it's the heart reaching out to others out to who even the Lost not everybody who accept it he goes on in verse three he said and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor you think that person would have some perfect love here remember perfect love cast out all fear so though I bestow all my goods now friends if you just give things away that you're going to throw out anyways it's not much of a sacrifice right we do that oh let this person have it I'm going to throw it out anyways well it's not much of a sacrifice we're talking about sacrific here see people do things for Honor and why do they do forarm to think that they're a great person that other people look at them and think they're a great person okay church I know we're spiritual here I I understand I maybe somebody's streaming here that needs this I know you don't need it I I I know that but understand this people are looking for rewards if you know other people are going to give you a reward you already got your reward as Jesus said Remember the the Pharisees the publicans he said they already got the reward he said though I so Goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned what's amazing about this scripture is that this is before the burning of bodies there was no burning at this time it was narrow that brought in burning bodies and then bringing people to the gift but he said even if I give myself they don't have to come and even give get you even if I give myself and you don't have perfect love friends there's the thing is is that it's not a sacrifice that's why self- sacrifice can still be self-centered self-sacrifice can be self-centered because what you realize people can conso themselves by doing things for others what's the motive what's the reason why people do things for others is because they can be honored they can be worshiped what's the motive what's the objective see because the thing is a heart filled with the love of God goes beyond human compassion nothing wrong with human compassion but that's not perfect love that's not what Paul's speaking about here because it comes from the Divine love which goes beyond feeling sorry for people I've said to people in our church I feel bad because I feel sorry for people and I might be getting in a way of God's plan by doing something for that person that God doesn't want me to I'm just being honest here I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my my body to be burned I have not charity it proth me nothing so zero doesn't profit me nothing so understand this friends you can give yourself give to the poor give yourself to the stake to be burned you can do all those different things but at the white Throne judgment you're going to come up in the resurrection and God says I have not recorded because I didn't lead you to do that this this is this is different than human compassion this is different than your Humanity because you can't get it from your Humanity because they do all kinds of Charity things in the world they do all those type of things but friends the thing is it's got to be recorded on God's God's God's records it's got to be recorded on his book but he's going to say depart from me workers of iniquity I did not know you because I didn't lead you to do those things this is why we got to be led by the Holy Ghost not led by a church led by the Holy Ghost because what people do they do things because they want to be recognized see if you getting led to the stake or give yourself to the stake people wanted to be on the book of Martyrs I don't know I don't know what the mor objective people see so you can give and you can do with a Divine love it means nothing to God remember the Widow that gave money or might in the in the synagogue and these other publicans come in and they give all kinds of money but God had it so it be written in his word so it be reminded to us for thousands of years that this woman cuz she sacrificed everything she got but these other ones they had all kinds of money oh I give so much I give so much friends the thing is that if it's not divinely LED God don't recognize those things that's why we got to understand it's got to become from the soul God don't even look at it if it doesn't come from the soul it's God's love it's his perfect love so understand this is that sacri self- sacrifice can be self centered so if a person is still getting something out of it see it's not God asking you it's not recorded now I'm going to step on some toes here not really but now for a preacher it's not what you can do for God and how many meetings you can hold or how often you can preach or where you can travel to because preachers think that's the way it is but if it's not God L it doesn't mean nothing if it's not his will and I you know friends I I've been around this message for for quite a few years and seen a lot of things see people will preach so many times you know in a in a year time and think they'll go here go there go nothing wrong with that if it's God L but they're just doing it to get their name out there God doesn't recognize it I'm a big name in the preacher I'm what is it friend is what is it doing is that there they they're trying to you know use what God's Gift gave to them for their own for their own means and we're not supposed to do that I want to be a blessing I want to be in his will I want to be in his will here tonight and the thing is that what what am I what are people trying to prove what preacher trying to prove they actually are trying to prove their vanity preachers are vain too absolutely because it's the way we think more is better so Paul goes a little deeper what the charity is Charity suffer long you realize a Corinthian Church they had little tolerance for one another they couldn't stand in you read read the book of Corinthians and read what brother R says about them see God wants to see his as reflected in love or reflected in charity charity suffer long so it was necess NE for them to understand what the love of God was there was a lot of contention going on in the Corinthian Church at this time so Paul brings this in because there was jealousy in the church there was Envy in the church there was complaining in the church there was muring in the church but suffereth long slowness to anger p and passion patience oppos to haste it Den notes the state of mind which can bear long when one is provoked a accommodated by someone who seeks to injure us you realize this isn't this isn't for a natural man a natural man doesn't think this way every one of us has a spot where our human love will run out we will stop forbearing for one another we will stop enduring for one another longsuffering people come along push your buttons in church push your buttons you're like an elevator going up and down push it push it up down B and God has it that way but the thing is is that the cost is or or or or or or what you can uh actually manifest in your life that you still love that person no matter what and you don't know why but God knows God knows because the thing is the love of God has no Li limits see it's adult love it's not teenage love it's not baby love it's an adult of full maturity so charity suffer long you might be thinking what does it have to do with fear the reason you have so much fear is you don't know how to love right quiet why is that we lack the perfect love attribute see before you can get rid of fear you got to find out what love is because charity suffereth long and is kind to be a good nature tender affectionate it wishes well it is not harsh or ill natur it is gentle mild manner so this is what you know this is what God's asking of us these aren't my words this is your Bible this is what we say we believe in see the thing is you can have a wife that overdoes your steak you can have a wife that burns your toast just get the old don't say nothing be kind rake the the burnt toast burnt off the toast he just all she's doing is acting you like a god she's worshiping you she's burning you food for you listen friends charity is kind I know we don't think these things are important but these are things that are important this is what Paul's letting know to the Corinthian Church because we emphasize certain things because perfect love is who we actually really are what we actually are is what our love that portrays out of us that's who we are he said charity is kind charity envieth not envieth jealous of any person or thing not to Envy Envy others for the happiness that they enjoy can you actually be happy for others come on friends we're all humans here see we're talking about the spirit of God here the perfect love the because God dwell in love God is love and we need to dwell in there too so can we actually be happy for others see because we they may have more domestic Comforts than we have they might make more money than you they might have a better job they might have a good family life they might and we get jealous and we envy people can we actually be happy for others because real charity is being happy for others realize that brother bam tells us that you should be the happiest people on this face of the Earth see because Envy always comes in its ranks you got Ministry you got deacons you got office of the church you got music song leaders specials Ministry envies other ministers they don't envy song leaders especially me they don't man they don't envy uh uh musicians see what it is they they envy people that are in their rank it's they're in their own class because what it is that they see somebody else doing what they're doing and they envy that person say oh I wish I had had a gift like that I wish well friends the thing it's what God's made you just like in church when your singer gets up and sings and gets a you know gets oh wow I really enjoyed that special then somebody else gets up you don't really enjoy that special and because you don't like that person are we carnal here how spiritual are we see perfect love isn't jealous perfect love isn't jealous Church isn't a competition preach is not a competition song leading is not a competition musicians is not a competition offic of the church it's not a competition friends it's us that makes it a competition but it's God that does it see if God wants that person in that position he's the one that placed them see being a Christian isn't a competition we're talking about maturity a perfect love here tonight see that's why we need a judge yourselves where we are out spiritually are we in a baby stage are we in a teenage stage or are we in a full age out those stage see what's going through us how are we actually being a blessing to people you realize friends brother Brown says this I get up every morning to be a blessing to someone thinking that way that's what he said see friends the thing is I want to be a blessing to people I want to be a bless I get up in the morning I want to be a blessing to that person you know just even God bless them or say be a kind uh kind to a person that you work with that you can't stand it's hard on you I know you say these things are trivial but I'm talking about perfect love here see because the thing is that you know God is one that gives out gifts but we look for The Faults we look for Flaws we look for those things cuz our Humanity part we're we're born in a negative body we're on the negative side but God can grow this love in these vessels in these bodies so charity charity uh fath not itself is not puffed up now think about this I don't know if I'm talking to anybody see if I put a graph up what would it say where would it be on this scale of all these things I read about see because the thing is when we look at some of these things and have an understanding of some of these things I need to grow up some more can we confess that can we say that can we actually sit there and say Lord because God wants us to be honest that's what God wants us to be honest with ourselves he said do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own feminist Spirit why didn't he say him why did he say her see because why the bride it's the bride Age The Bride is going to be this love remember when brother bran was aino Canyon and the thing is is that he lifts up his hand and the sword came down what was happening the transferring of the kingdom of God was transferring down to the Earth comes with a word and begins to speak the word speak the word perfect love castes out all fear speak the word perfect love cast out fear do we understand it's not easy to provoke think of no evil so this perfect love has actually been transferred to us we we got a mission here I've been commissioned see I'm not commissioned just to know the doctrines because it's not perfect Doctrine it's perfect love see mature love see perfect love this is where God wants to get us to now we can say well is this attainable I say yes it is am I is this able can I able to get yes it is because he never would have put in his word it's got to be attainable see or it's just a subject matter where we can just sit around and just discuss and discuss this and discuss that see now we want to get rid of our fears but how can we move on how does it happen see that's why brother B told us the reason why the church can't move on is because it's got so much fear there's only one way to remove fear is allow mature perfect love to come in now this perfect love consists all kinds of attributes now I don't know what you drive here but most of us have spare tires will we not in our vehicles a spare tire can come in handy most of us though as Humanity part of us we don't want to be a spare tire we want to be the main Tire amen but spare tires can be handy they're designed to be handy they're designed to be in your view you get a flat tire and the thing is they come in handy when you get in trouble and the thing is now now if we can ask ourselves where am I on the scale do I have adult love remember brother bam says I'm you know when they ask him the question are you the main preacher you know what he said he says no I'm just a pebble on the beach that's what he said now do we actually believe that I think he actually believed that about himself because he was so humble about who he was because God knows how to Humble us right so understand this is that we don't want just to be you know capful I don't want just to be a creek full I want to be a river full I want something to flow through me I don't want to be self-centered I just want to be satisfied of going to church I want something more in my life but how often does Satan Rob us see because brother Bown tells us that the bride actually ministers to Christ how do we minister to him not through tapes not through books but it's actually the Bride made flesh it's the bride coming of Christ see the Bible doesn't minister to him tapes don't minister to them books don't minister to them it's actually the word made flesh so what is it friends many of many of us can sit right here just tonight we can sit in a message church and we can pretend I believe this message because remember friends you can pretend that you're a message believer you can all the quotes but have an understanding that you have not this manifestation of what I'm preaching about tonight because how patient how God has been patient with me this is what I look at how God has been patient with me as long as he says as long as you're doing what he says to do and you know you're directly LED well that there's nothing to fear he said perfect love castes out all fear there's no fear in God love takes away fear amen now watch perfect love CES out all fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect but look at the problem you're scared he won't keep his word that's the problem we're scared he won't keep his word because we try to sort everything out we categorize we think everything out we sit there and get so deep we categorize and we think that we know it and but no we don't know it we have to have confidence in his word because he goes on he says perfect love cast out of fear and as long as you got fear you can have faith so you got to have love first you got to have love first you got to have love first it drives all fear out and then faith comes in and takes the place of fear now you can have little faith and still have fear or you can have great faith and no fear but you can't have a lot of fear and have a lot of faith he can't have it that way now listen to what brother Bram says here that's where the church is you're always scared it's not going to happen that's the reason it don't happen love cast out fear when you got love fear is gone but as long as you got fear love cannot operate so you have Fe now brother bam tells us I mean I'm just touching the surface of this but you come to church and he says many people have fear that's why things don't operate like it should in a church is because you don't allow the love of God to come in amongst you and operate among you that's why brother bam when he says things like this he says I rather have the love of God than all the gifts operating he'll say statements like that see because why what is he trying to get to he's trying to drive that fear fear out of the church and trying to show us he said love has no fear he said love cast out fear and I know it's in my meaning so much that when I come into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear what makes fear is lack of confidence oh you little faith oh we have little trust little confidence if you lack confidence it will make you fear but if you love it Cast Away fear so when Peter got out of that boat he lost confidence he lost that substance because substance fear is a substance love is a substance and when you lose that substance of love you get that substance of fear and that's why you begin to sing that's why friends the thing is when he got terrified it actually overtook him just like job it overtook him now watch this he said I find out that one of the greatest hindrances that the Church of God today is that they're scared to death what are you scared about that's only what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize that who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who that is sitting next to you I'm talking about church body dedication meetings you don't know who's beside you watch oh you say yeah that's my neighbor I know I know him all right that but he's a Son of God see that's right adopted by Jesus Christ into the the family that's a daughter of God sitting next to you he said and who are you if you're a Christian believer you're a son or daughter of God what are you scared about no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then so we emphasize so many things in the message we come to church we have emphasis what's brother Jonathan going to preach to tonight oh he really did rotten tonight he really did a bad job tonight but understand friends don't miss this because under we're under the order of mzc I'm closing here we're under the order of mzc remember when MZ made Abraham and served him communion he had a body change when Jesus had a communion with his Apostles he had a resurrection and a body change last message brother B preached was communion what was he showing the church you going to have perfect love you get this perfect love I'm giving you communion not just natural communion which is one of the Orin but but spiritual communion so why he for a body change malz is here friends the thing is have you heard from your theophany I have you got to understand what your theophany is your theophany is this message brother Jerry absolutely it is because if you hear the message of the hour you hear from your th because it's only your th is your word body your word body is the thing that only hears it right remember I'm only onethird done here I got a soul that's born again but I can need my body change I need my human Spirit change I'm waiting for my body change so massic is here right now to give me a body change he's serving me communion here tonight to give me a body change listen friends the thing is that he's not here just playing with the church and you just sit around and discuss these things he's here to actually serve your communion if I passed away right here right now my soul would go out of me and go to go to my theophany but my the offering be 2/3 done it's got to be full so it's going to come back and get my glorified body but if I don't have if I don't die here and I get my body changed my theophany comes to me my soul comes to me then I'm fully done it's a full word then word walking body that's what we that's what God's trying to shoot for but he knows my sheep hear my voice he won't follow no others that's why friends the thing is every time we uh the mezc came there was a change and mzza came in this day and age to show us the way it wasn't brother brother Bram it was Christ see brother brandham wasn't our messenger it was Christ Our messenger he just used a body named brother brandom that's all it is and we hear those words and what those the words do it does something for us it changes us it does and we embrace it because why it it's a calling out who's going to have this perfect love I am I am cuz I'm going to be an adult in this a spiritual adult I'm not is going to sit around and complain and murmur I'm not going to complain in the church I'm not going to love my brother I'm going to love my sisters psalms 27 closing what is Psalms 27:1 though my enemies come against me right they'll fall see your flesh is your enemy your human spirit is your enemy it's contaminated you need you you what it is Friends really your theophany will will replace your replace your human Spirit your human spirit's already cont brother B talks about that in 56 57 58 your human Spirit your human spirit will be gone and what do you need you need a theophany a word body and what is it you because God's perfected in threes flesh glorified flesh theophany that's going to be your new spirit and your soul which is already born again but don't um I'm put a thing around I'm under construction God's still working on me amen God God's still working on me amen God bless you Saints let's stand hallelujah thank you Jesus for some that's the best part of the service closing I love you friends I want to see the Bride of Jesus Christ on display the vision brother bam had she was on full display that's what I want to see I want to see Christ and every one of you how do we do it by removing that fear from us and letting the perfect love come into us and come into us and actually just not sit back and say well I'm a message believer everybody has those breing rights message believer so the Pharisees I'm a I'm a I'm a message you know I'm a message Pharisee believer they quoted they quoted Moses Jesus quoted Moses the difference was Jesus was the word made flesh those Pharisees missed what the word was made flesh because in this end time the bride is going to be the word made flesh so if that bride's going to be the word made flesh and we come to church and we miss that we're we're no different than the Pharisees are amen you understand that because they quoted Moses Jesus quoted Moses only thing Jesus why he quoted because he was that word he came walking out of the volume of the book we come walking out of this message in the volume of the book Jesus came out of the walking out of the volume of the Old Testament we come walking out in the new T of the volume of the book here I am I'm the word made flesh amen let's have a word prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I just thank you dear God for your grace in our lives father I know Lord Jesus sometimes we read these words and sometimes we sit there and we begin to measure ourselves but father all we need to do is yield ourselves submit ourselves consecrate ourselves more to you Lord God and show us the way show us the path because father you're the great one you're the perfect one you're the one that came in this day and age you put your foot on land you put your foot on sea and Lord you gave us an affidavit and you became our priest our high priest your judgment to the world but to the bride you were mercy and Grace father we just thankful God for your mercy in our lives and your grace in our lives father Lord Jesus we we needed a priest we needed a high priest and right now I can confess to you right now that you are my Lord You're my God you're my everything Lord Jesus I confess father that Lord Jesus I want to be a a vessel that you can freely reign in Lord that's what I want father forgive me for my wrongdoings forgive me of my shortcomings cover me in the blood of Jesus wash me dear God father I pray for the congregation here as we are going in these dedication means father that you just father give them an understanding a greater appreciation for what you've done for them in this day and age it's not something that we just wait around because we are the Rapture the Rapture is in US father it's going to be an eventful day but Lord God as we grow as Enoch walked day by day for 365 years while he left his wife and kids brother BR says and kissed them and went out and walked and and God took them oh father I pray Lord Jesus let me just be yielded Lord more than I've ever been yielded granted I pray I ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen I want to live the way he wants me to live amen I'll give it over to brother Jonathan amen go ahead brother come you [Music] brother I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever out love the Lord will I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever I love the Lord amen did you enjoy that this evening amen what a wonderful way to start a look in the mirror does us a lot of good amen I had so many notes there but I loved how we started with the reason you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has not entered yet we need more of him amen we need more of his love we need to spend more time in his presence love how he said it's a question of trust not belief because that's the challenge isn't it the challenge is to put the word into action that shows trust we believe it our soul says I believe it but now this flesh has to become subject because remember what is the manifestation in it's in flesh the soul agrees but the flesh has to be brought subject I love how he said the word is here for manifestation that's his purpose is to produce itself the word Goes Forth in power and the Holy Spirit quickens it to make it a reality in each and every one of our lives and that's when trust turns into reality what a beautiful thought and it struck me as he was saying that that if the fullness of the word has been given what does that mean for you and I the fullness of the word is to be manifested am what limit is there on the bride of Christ tonight if the full word has been open then what holds us back trust it's the only thing we're scared you know there's things I prayed about in my life life that I've never gotten healed for yet and you get to the point brother Jerry like he said you don't even want to pray about it anymore cuz you're scared it's never going to happen exactly been there done that doing it at times church right amen let's let's get honest tonight amen are we scared it's never going to happen amen because if we can't have our healing if we can't have our deliverance how are we ever going to get a Rapture yeah really anden we talk about grades of love we we talked about grades of Faith last service if you remember we're looking for rapturing Faith but we need healing faith we don't just need saving faith we need delivering faith we need guiding Faith that's right amen we need to step into a higher place and where does it come in his presence in his presence in that prayer closet I like the good Catholic comment you were vindicating some of my service from last time where I was talking about we get to the place where we check off everything a Believer does and we say that makes us a believer and what do we hear tonight what makes us a Believer is the love of God in our life it's the Holy Ghost In Action not just in me but working now for your benefit and your brothers and your sisters and these different ones amen he says love drives out fear and then faith comes in can I share a testimony this evening last service you saw people come up and be prayed for little Mary Beth came up for prayer because of a th of an issue in the glands in her throat and her throat was in such pain she was healed before she got back to her Pew because she trusted Hallelujah she took the belief amen if you have faith like a little Mustard Seed yeah how old are you Sister Mary Beth 10 if a 10-year-old can trust in childlike Faith what up mature Sons and Daughters to be doing tonight I say Lord lift up my faith lift up my trust Lord take me to a higher plane Lord help me to put the word into action to rest my very life and Soul on it day by day right amen what a word we heard tonight God bless you brother Jerry all I could think of was that song More of You Can we sing that not because brother Jerry told us we needed more of him yeah but because we recognized more of him yeah I was sharing with brother Jerry in the office that God had to take the arrogance out of me and he's still taking it out sometimes but that's what he did in the 16 years that I left this church and went and traveled around and sat under Ministries and went through many things in my life was he was beat that arrogance out and it comes from a self-righteous attitude big fish in a little Pond and we think because of something that's in there family name I know more than this one I'm smarter than that one I whatever it is we go out and what happens is we limit what God can do in our life because we think we're good enough already he talked about that God had to knock me off my feet to bring me to a place where he could use me where he could fulfill his word in my life in a greater way and it came to a place where I said God I need more of you than what I have right now because what I'm facing is greater than what I have to face it with and it's going to take a supernatural event it's going to take a supernatural experience it's going to take a greater Faith than what I've got a greater love than what I've got to pass through this journey and when I humbled myself guess what all of a sudden God became magnified and all of a sudden the battle started being won instead of Lost and all of a sudden we started to grow and mature in ways that we hadn't before why because we got out of our self-righteousness that's what he was talking about tonight the check marks are not what make us Believers exactly it's the love of God the Holy Spirit In Action that is the difference between a true son and daughter of God and someone that merely says it amen we need more of him tonight Church let's say it as a prayer let's say it as a revelation tonight Lord I need more you and let that love flow in for your situation for your body for your marriage for your job whatever it might be wherever you're going whatever you're doing saying Lord if you can have the preeminence if it can be all you and none of me then I know the victory is on the way I know the way it comes out will be your way then we can have trust amen as he said when we know who we are when we know our direct leadership we can have faith and stand amen amen let's sing it tonight let's sing it tonight raise your hands worship him say Lord I need more of you say it as a prayer express your need and if you don't think you need anything then raise your hand a little higher and say Lord because I don't think I need anything I need even more of you than anyone else here amen let's sing it out to him let's raise our hearts let's raise our souls to him and say

the series was but you know what it's like when you go to another church sometimes you're go you're looking forward to maybe something different cuz I know one of his series that he preached one time is 69 was was 69 sermons on Oneness but um so anyway I I figured I'm going to hear something different and that Sunday morning I went to church and he picks up right where brother J left off and so one when I said oh I didn't get a break at all God God must have figured I really needed this you know I needed this tonight and I just wanted to say that God is moving into the ministry just
