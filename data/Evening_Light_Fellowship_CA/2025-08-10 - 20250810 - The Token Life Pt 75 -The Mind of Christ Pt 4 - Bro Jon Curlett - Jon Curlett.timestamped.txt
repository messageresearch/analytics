[43:27] You change my life in so many ways.
[43:33] You cradle me in your sweet grace.
[43:39] You'll fill me.
[43:44] And yesterday,
[43:46] today, forever more.
[43:52] There's one thing I know for sure.
[43:59] Fresh as a morning dew,
[44:03] you make your mercy new.
[44:11] Every morning.
[44:15] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, how thankful we
[44:17] are, Lord, that that mercy renews every
[44:20] morning, Lord. It's inexhaustible, Lord.
[44:22] It's a fountain of mercy and grace,
[44:24] Lord, flowing down to those that will
[44:26] accept it. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[44:28] know your grace comes by your word,
[44:31] Lord. Your mercy is through the blood.
[44:33] Your grace is through the word, Lord,
[44:34] that lifts us up out of the muck and the
[44:36] the mire that we're stuck in, Lord, out
[44:38] of life situations, Lord, our own
[44:40] decisions and failures, Lord. But you
[44:42] lift us up and Lord, you're trying to
[44:43] get us into heavenly places, Lord, to
[44:46] see our position in you this morning.
[44:48] Lord, you're trying to get us to see
[44:50] that there's an overcomer's way. Lord,
[44:52] there's a holiness way. There's a
[44:54] highway, Lord, to eternal life, Lord, of
[44:56] walking together with you, Lord. And we
[44:58] want to walk there with you this
[44:59] morning, heavenly father. Lord, we want
[45:01] to surrender our lives to you a new,
[45:03] Lord. We want a rebaptism of your Holy
[45:05] Spirit, Lord, to fill these vessels,
[45:07] Lord, that it could overflow, Lord, that
[45:10] it could show the world a Jesus Christ
[45:11] that's alive today as he was yesterday,
[45:14] Lord. And the same thing tomorrow, Lord
[45:16] God. Lord, just just fill us, Lord. I
[45:19] pray touch us a new, Lord. Help us to
[45:22] surrender daily to you, Lord. Help us to
[45:24] draw close to you as you draw close to
[45:26] us, Lord. Let us not turn you away,
[45:29] Lord, but let us receive you into the
[45:30] home of our lives and hearts and souls
[45:32] day by day, Lord, to have sweet
[45:34] fellowship with you. We pray, Lord,
[45:37] remembering the many prayer requests
[45:38] been brought forth, Lord. Those that are
[45:40] in the path of the wildfires, Lord, you
[45:42] see the impact it's potentially having
[45:44] on camp. Lord, we commit it all into
[45:46] your hands, Lord. You know the perfect
[45:48] will. you know the perfect way, Lord.
[45:50] But we're asking grace that you would
[45:51] help us in our fellowship each one. We
[45:53] pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking
[45:55] it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if
[45:58] you would to Second Timothy chapter 1.
[46:01] Second Timothy chapter 1. We want to
[46:02] keep remembering the Wim family, of
[46:04] course, and they're on an evacuation
[46:06] alert there in Victoria. Just trusting
[46:08] the Lord to be with them. We want to
[46:10] remember brother Matt and Sister Amber
[46:11] and Selena. I think they come home
[46:13] tomorrow
[46:15] early morning. Yeah. So we want to
[46:18] remember them as well as they travel.
[46:20] God's grace to them. Each one
[46:23] different ones that are away. Brother
[46:24] Kingsley and his family on vacation.
[46:27] Amen. Praying God's grace to each one of
[46:29] us. Amen. Second Timothy chapter 1 verse
[46:32] 7. We're going to read through verse 9.
[46:33] I only had seven here but just in my
[46:35] office felt led to go all the way to
[46:37] verse 9. So 1 Timothy 2 Timothy sorry 1
[46:40] and verse 7 says this. For God had not
[46:43] given us the spirit of fear,
[46:47] but it doesn't say the spirit of, but it
[46:49] means the spirit of power and of love
[46:52] and of a sound mind. He says, "Be not
[46:55] thou therefore ashamed of the testimony
[46:57] of our Lord, nor me his prisoner, but be
[47:00] thou partaker of the afflictions of the
[47:03] gospel according to the power of God."
[47:06] He says, "Who has saved us and called us
[47:08] with an holy calling, not according to
[47:11] our works, but according to his own
[47:13] purpose and grace which was given us in
[47:16] Christ Jesus before the world began."
[47:20] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[47:21] seats this morning. We're continuing on
[47:23] our series on the Holy Ghost. We want to
[47:25] take another series on the mind of
[47:27] Christ. And last service, we spoke on
[47:30] being in the right channel to receive
[47:32] the word of God. Amen. That's what the
[47:34] mind of Christ is. It's the the mind
[47:36] that will receive the word. It will
[47:37] receive the will of God. And we're like
[47:39] a radio that's tuned to a frequency. And
[47:41] that frequency is the word. Amen. That's
[47:43] what we're built to receive. Amen. That
[47:45] comes with prayer. It comes with
[47:47] spending time with God. It comes with
[47:48] reading his word. It comes with
[47:50] meditating on the things to God. And you
[47:52] know, even before we get into this
[47:53] service this morning, I'm always amazed
[47:55] how if you'll give God some quiet time,
[47:57] he starts talking. I know I've said this
[47:59] before, but if I'm out walking, if I'm
[48:01] driving, even if I just take a moment to
[48:03] just sit for a while and just start to
[48:05] meditate on the things of God, just turn
[48:08] everything else off, turn the phone off,
[48:10] tune the family out, just get someplace
[48:12] quiet, and just give him a moment, he
[48:15] starts to speak. Prophet of God says,
[48:17] you talk about him, he draws near. You
[48:19] start to dwell on the things of God.
[48:20] Amen. And so, I'm amazed at what at what
[48:23] he will do if we'll just give him the
[48:25] time and the opportunity to do it. So
[48:28] many times, remember the prophet of God
[48:29] said, he said, "God is a gentleman. He
[48:31] won't force himself in. But if you
[48:33] invite him in, a gentleman doesn't turn
[48:35] down an invitation, does he?" So if
[48:37] we'll invite him in, if we'll give him
[48:39] that opportunity. Amen. And I was even
[48:41] studying for this service yesterday, and
[48:42] I was down in my office for two hours.
[48:44] And I was completely overwhelmed with
[48:46] it. I had so much in front of me, so
[48:48] many so many things that had crossed my
[48:50] mind, so many directions I could go. And
[48:52] I spent two hours, and I had no
[48:54] direction. And so I just came up out of
[48:56] the basement. And I just said, "Lord, I
[48:58] don't know where to go. There's just too
[48:59] much here. And I don't know what thought
[49:01] you'd have for me or what direction
[49:02] you'd have me." And just a few minutes
[49:04] later, just not studying, not not
[49:06] anything, just waiting, he gave me that
[49:08] scripture that we started with, and I
[49:09] said, "I'll take that." And away we
[49:10] went. See, church, I'm not I'm not
[49:12] looking for an idea. I'm not looking for
[49:14] for just a something that I can preach
[49:16] on. I'm looking for inspiration. Amen.
[49:18] I'm looking for what he wants for the
[49:20] people. I don't want to come up here and
[49:22] preach my thoughts or my ideas or what I
[49:24] think. Amen. But I'm not up here to
[49:26] force it. Amen. What I want to do is
[49:29] catch his mind and his thought and let
[49:31] him do the talking. Then it's his
[49:32] message, not my message. It's it's him
[49:34] preaching to the people, not me
[49:36] preaching to the people. And so
[49:37] sometimes we need to just lay everything
[49:39] down and sit still a while. You think,
[49:42] you know, there's nothing wrong with me
[49:43] studying. I've got to study. But it's
[49:46] not by studying I'm going to catch it.
[49:49] It's by catching it I'm going to catch
[49:51] it. And I've got to give him time to to
[49:53] to open up the the channel and so I can
[49:56] receive because if what I'm doing is I'm
[49:58] filling my channel all the time, he
[50:00] doesn't have a chance to step in. So
[50:02] I've got to just lay it down sometimes
[50:04] and say, "Lord, you see what I've got?
[50:06] You see my 49 pages of notes in front of
[50:09] me. What portion do you want me to
[50:11] preach on?" Or do you want me to preach
[50:13] on something completely different? I've
[50:15] got to lay everything I've got aside as
[50:17] much as I feel that's the direction God
[50:19] wants me. If he wants me to take a
[50:20] service or five or 10 that's not on this
[50:22] topic, I've got to be able to do it.
[50:24] Amen. But you you will you'll find so
[50:27] many times that Satan is keeping us so
[50:29] busy with our lives that when we're not
[50:32] busy, we're just trying to relax. And
[50:34] when we're trying to relax, that's
[50:35] rarely the things of God. And so we get
[50:37] into this cycle. Amen. We're so busy
[50:39] winding ourselves up and then unwinding
[50:42] ourselves
[50:43] that God's got no place in our life.
[50:46] Amen. You notice when they came out of
[50:47] Egypt before they did, Satan got them
[50:49] real busy. Bricks without straw and
[50:51] you've got to meet your quota and you've
[50:53] got to do this and you've got to do
[50:54] that. And we've got so many things in
[50:55] our life that we got to do. Church, go
[50:58] travel to a third world country and
[50:59] you'll find out how quick you can get
[51:00] away with not having a whole lot of
[51:02] things that we think we've got to have
[51:03] today. Amen. There's so much Amen. God's
[51:06] left sitting outside and all he gets is
[51:08] a little bit of time at church with us.
[51:11] That's sad how sometimes we get there.
[51:13] We can get so busy that the only time
[51:15] God gets us is in church. And half the
[51:17] time we're so busy unwinding from
[51:18] everything we wound oursel up that he
[51:20] doesn't really get a whole lot of time
[51:21] in it in the first place. Amen. That's a
[51:23] sad state of affairs for us. But
[51:25] sometimes we're just that busy. Amen.
[51:27] I'll tell you what, that's not going to
[51:28] produce rapturing faith. A life that's
[51:31] so busy that we're giving God the the
[51:32] dregs of of what's left of our life is
[51:35] not going to produce a closeness with
[51:36] God by any means. Amen. We've got to
[51:38] give him some time. We're up against an
[51:39] enemy. And I'll tell you that enemy is
[51:42] using busyiness these days to keep us
[51:44] wound up. And he's had thousands of
[51:45] years of thousands of years of practice
[51:47] to get us wound up in these things.
[51:49] Brother Brown would say it this way. He
[51:50] says, "You see the trouble today. We
[51:52] have so much money and stuff on our
[51:54] mind. God can't have a place to get in
[51:56] our thinking." He says, "We want to go
[51:58] downtown, shop for new dresses or
[52:00] something or another. We have to see
[52:02] Susie and John. We're going to play
[52:03] cards tonight. We can't go to church
[52:05] tonight." He says, "We have everything
[52:07] else on our mind." Now, I'm pretty sure
[52:09] we're not at home playing cards,
[52:11] but what are we at home doing? Or what
[52:13] are we not at church doing?
[52:15] It's amazing to me how we can we can't
[52:18] give God eight out of 168 hours to go to
[52:20] church.
[52:22] Those only those those four hours on a
[52:25] Wednesday night and four hours on a
[52:26] Sunday morning. Somehow those seem to
[52:28] get blocked up the first, not the last.
[52:31] We won't stay up late on Monday night,
[52:33] Tuesday night, so that we're free
[52:34] Wednesday night.
[52:36] And we won't block off our Sundays. You
[52:39] know, my son plays soccer. He plays at a
[52:41] high level. Somebody asked me the other
[52:43] day, they said, "John, how how long are
[52:45] you going to let him play?" I said,
[52:46] "Until they kick us out because we don't
[52:48] show up." Cuz I said, "We don't play
[52:50] Wednesday nights and we don't play
[52:51] Sundays." End of story. It's not
[52:53] negotiable. It's not negotiable. Why? We
[52:56] blocked out time for God. We're showing
[52:58] our kids what matters. We're showing our
[53:00] family what matters. Amen. I'm not here
[53:03] to preach this morning to those aren't
[53:04] here. I'm here to preach to those that
[53:05] are here. I'm saying, "Hold the line.
[53:07] Hold the line." Because Satan's trying
[53:08] to push the line. He's trying to push
[53:11] the line. When God gives us ground,
[53:13] church, let's not give it back. Let's
[53:15] not give it back. When God shows us
[53:17] something, he never takes it back. We've
[53:19] got to hold our ground when God puts
[53:21] something into our lives. Amen. He says
[53:23] the church has got so many orders and
[53:24] things to keep us so busy. He says
[53:27] prayer meetings are left out. Now, he's
[53:28] talking more about denominational
[53:29] systems where they have so many programs
[53:31] and so many things going on. But he
[53:32] says, "What you've left out is one of
[53:34] the most critical, which is prayer
[53:35] meetings." We're going to start prayer
[53:37] meetings up again in the fall. Now, we
[53:39] had those last year. They kind of tailed
[53:41] off, and it was mostly the the the the
[53:43] fathers and their sons coming, but it's
[53:45] open to everyone. And I hope that we'll
[53:47] have more people there. It's usually on
[53:49] Saturday nights in preparation for
[53:52] Sunday morning service. It's to get us
[53:54] in a mindset. Amen. And we're going to
[53:56] be running the prayer meetings a little
[53:57] differently, and I'll share what that's
[53:59] going to look like as we get closer to
[54:01] that opening. Amen. But prayer is
[54:04] critical to our walk with God. And
[54:06] prayer for each other is critical for
[54:08] this body. There's nothing you'll find
[54:10] more satisfying than have your brother
[54:11] and sister pray for you. It's a
[54:13] wonderful thing. It draws you closer. It
[54:16] gets us over the bumps and the rubs that
[54:18] we have. Amen. When I can pray for you
[54:20] and you can pray for me and we can be
[54:22] honest about where we're at and what
[54:24] needs we have and what God's doing in
[54:25] our life and our struggles and our pains
[54:27] and our hurts. When we can get together
[54:29] and pray about that, good things happen
[54:30] in the body of Christ. That's what it
[54:32] takes. Amen. We're in a showdown, in
[54:35] case you didn't know it, church. We're
[54:37] in a showdown. Amen. A bount Zion
[54:38] showdown. And it's a showdown whether
[54:40] we're going to give God everything that
[54:42] he wants or we're going to let Satan
[54:44] start pressing in cuz the enemy is
[54:47] trying to come in like a flood. I did.
[54:50] We uh we talked about that earthquake
[54:52] over in Russia. And I did look it up and
[54:54] it was the one in uh in uh Cal or in in
[54:58] Alaska was still bigger. I believe it
[54:59] was a 92 or a 91. It was huge. That was
[55:02] judgment. But this is just a warning
[55:05] that there's judgment coming. But
[55:06] Kamchchateka province on in Russia
[55:08] there. They show that tsunami come in
[55:10] and this guy was up on a hill that was
[55:12] 100 ft high and he thought he was safe
[55:14] and he had his dog running around and
[55:16] his dog went down in a dip that was
[55:18] about 20 feet below him and almost got
[55:19] swept away by that tsunami. 75 ft up
[55:22] into the hills. We're in a showdown,
[55:25] church. Everything's coming to a head.
[55:27] Amen. And like I said before, we're
[55:30] we're we're so caught up in so many
[55:32] things in busyiness. And Satan's tying
[55:35] us up in busyiness that when we can get
[55:37] away from that, we're just trying to
[55:38] untie ourselves from the busyiness.
[55:41] And it rarely works in God's favor when
[55:42] we do that. Satan's trying to get us so
[55:44] worn out, so committed that we've got a
[55:47] half-hearted prayer for God just before
[55:49] we go to bed.
[55:51] It's exactly the truth. It's exactly the
[55:53] truth. We only have to look around. Look
[55:54] at your brothers. We're We're all mostly
[55:57] single inome families. Listen, we've
[55:59] Some of you are are by God's grace
[56:01] retired.
[56:03] But for those of us that aren't retired,
[56:05] we're working. We get up in the morning
[56:07] and we work, work, work. And guess what?
[56:09] And then we've got commitments to our
[56:10] family. We've got commitments church. We
[56:11] can get so busy in our commitments that
[56:15] we forget that it's God that takes the
[56:16] priority in all of that.
[56:19] We've got to be able to commit
[56:20] everything to him. Commit everything to
[56:22] him and just let him come in and start
[56:24] to do these works in our lives. Amen.
[56:26] I'll tell you one thing. If we
[56:27] approached our time with God with the
[56:29] same commitment we have for work, we'd
[56:31] get a whole lot further with God. If we
[56:34] said, guess what? I can only take two
[56:36] weeks off or 3 weeks or four weeks off a
[56:37] year from God. Can you imagine where
[56:39] we'd be if we said, "Every day I've got
[56:41] to go to God. Every day I've got to talk
[56:43] with God. Every day I've got to spend
[56:45] time with God." This is pastoral this
[56:47] morning. And I know it's not the main
[56:49] theme of our service this morning, but I
[56:50] just wanted to talk about that this idea
[56:52] of us getting so caught up in things
[56:54] that we can't even receive what God has
[56:55] for us cuz we're so tired out. We're so
[56:58] worn out. You know, I was talking to my
[57:00] daughter yesterday about the the
[57:02] meetings that they're down with brother
[57:03] Matt and sister Amber and their family
[57:04] and my daughter's there as well. And she
[57:06] was talking, she said, there was one
[57:07] theme that came out yesterday. She said
[57:09] that I so enjoyed and the preacher said,
[57:11] "We don't have to wait for the
[57:12] millennium to take away Satan's
[57:14] opportunity." I thought that was a
[57:16] wonderful thought because remember in
[57:17] the millennium, Satan is bound by chains
[57:20] of circumstance. In other words, he has
[57:22] no one that he can work with, no one he
[57:24] can work through. There's no one yielded
[57:26] to him. The and the preacher was saying,
[57:27] "Listen, we don't have to wait till the
[57:29] millennium to take away Satan's
[57:30] opportunity." Remember, we preached not
[57:32] too long ago that that we get to reign
[57:34] with Christ in our hearts over sin and
[57:37] the devil right now, today, by the Holy
[57:40] Spirit. That's our throne that we're in
[57:42] is that we are supposed to have
[57:44] authority over Satan inside of our life.
[57:46] Amen. And it's a beautiful thought that
[57:48] we don't have to wait till the
[57:49] millennium to defeat Satan. That we can
[57:51] rule and reign over him even this
[57:53] morning. Amen. He says we need to draw
[57:55] nigh unto God so he will draw nigh unto
[57:58] us, friends. That's right. He says, "But
[58:00] everything else has taken the place of
[58:01] the prayer meeting. Everything else has
[58:03] taken the place of the real spiritual
[58:06] worship." He says, "Oh, maybe two or
[58:08] three minutes in church." He says, "But
[58:11] I just love to lay and bathe before him
[58:14] in his presence." Don't you love that?
[58:16] Oh, he says, "Just lift up your hands
[58:18] and drink from the fountain until you
[58:20] just can't drink no more. Just bubbling
[58:23] over in his sweetness and his goodness."
[58:26] We sing that song, Sweet Hour of Prayer.
[58:29] Let me ask us this morning, how many of
[58:30] us have had an hour of sweet prayer in
[58:32] the last month?
[58:35] where you could go in, and I'm not
[58:36] talking about coming into church, but
[58:38] you could come into the presence of God
[58:40] in your home, in your car, wherever it
[58:42] would be, and you come out and you say,
[58:44] "I met with Jesus." That I came out
[58:46] refreshed. I came out strengthened. I
[58:48] came out encouraged. I came out
[58:50] corrected. I came out different than I
[58:53] went in. That's a sweet hour of prayer
[58:56] is not just going in and talking the
[58:58] whole time, but laying yourself before
[59:00] him in his presence and just letting him
[59:02] administer something to you.
[59:08] How long has it been since we waited for
[59:10] him to speak?
[59:12] David would say this. He says, "Wait on
[59:14] the Lord." And then he puts a colon
[59:17] there. That means give it some time.
[59:21] He says, "Be of good courage while
[59:23] you're waiting, and he shall strengthen
[59:25] thine heart." He says, "Wait, I say on
[59:28] the Lord." The prophet of God says, "The
[59:29] trouble of it is we don't stay long
[59:31] enough. We're not convinced." He says,
[59:34] "That's the reason our concern has left
[59:36] us. That's the reason we're so busy in
[59:38] the things of the world. That's the
[59:40] reason we're so unrestful." He says,
[59:42] "We're not yet thoroughly convinced." We
[59:45] think we are, but when you're thoroughly
[59:48] convinced, like the old brother said a
[59:49] while ago, something takes place. He
[59:52] says, "When you're really convinced,
[59:54] then you're concerned."
[59:57] Let me put it this way, church. Your
[59:59] concern is shown by where you put your
[1:00:01] energy, where you put your time, where
[1:00:03] you put your energy, your your efforts,
[1:00:05] where you put your thought. And if we're
[1:00:07] giving God the drags of our time, I'll
[1:00:09] tell you what, we're not convinced of
[1:00:10] the benefit of our relationship with
[1:00:11] Christ this morning. Remember church, a
[1:00:14] tithe was always given first.
[1:00:18] It didn't matter if you got 30fold one
[1:00:20] year or 100fold year. You always gave
[1:00:22] God first. And then whatever was left,
[1:00:24] you said, "Lord, I'm going to trust that
[1:00:26] that's enough for me and my family.
[1:00:28] Tithe was not an option. We're not I'm
[1:00:30] not preaching about tithes this morning.
[1:00:32] I'm talking about time. I'm talking
[1:00:34] about energy. I'm talking about where
[1:00:35] we're giving our focus. Is a tenth going
[1:00:37] to Christ?
[1:00:39] And is it going first? And then we say,
[1:00:42] "Lord, I'll take whatever's left and
[1:00:43] I'll put that into all these other
[1:00:45] things." We do that, church, I guarantee
[1:00:48] you we'd see some bigger results in our
[1:00:49] life. We'd see a closeness. Amen. Tell
[1:00:53] you what,
[1:00:55] go try and marry somebody that you're
[1:00:58] only giving time to when you're tired at
[1:01:00] the end of your day.
[1:01:04] We got a couple singles here this
[1:01:05] morning. Can you imagine if somebody was
[1:01:08] trying to marry Sister Becky
[1:01:11] and he says, "I love you, Sister Becky.
[1:01:14] I want to marry you." And all he does is
[1:01:17] he talks to her at 11:35 at night, 5
[1:01:20] minutes before he goes to bed when he's
[1:01:22] completely worn out. Do you think Sister
[1:01:24] Bettyy's going to fall in love with
[1:01:25] that? Becky's going to fall in love with
[1:01:26] that guy. Ain't no way. Ain't no way.
[1:01:31] She's not even going to know him. He's
[1:01:32] not going to know her. Why? There's no
[1:01:35] relationship.
[1:01:36] He might say he wants to, but his
[1:01:39] actions demonstrate something completely
[1:01:40] different. It's not going to work out.
[1:01:43] Amen. Remember the scripture says Jesus
[1:01:45] said, "What does it profit a man if he
[1:01:47] gain the whole world but lose his own
[1:01:50] soul?" Amen.
[1:01:53] If we want to have a relationship, if we
[1:01:55] want to have a marriage, church, there's
[1:01:56] got to be a relationship first. There's
[1:01:58] got to be a closeness that comes with
[1:01:59] it. Amen. That's your pastoral word for
[1:02:01] this morning. Last service, we talked
[1:02:03] about discernment. How that anything
[1:02:05] other than the word causes red flags to
[1:02:07] rise up. I was talking to some people
[1:02:09] after service about this idea of of when
[1:02:12] the spirit of God moves because the
[1:02:13] discerner is always the spirit.
[1:02:15] Remember, it's not me. It's not me that
[1:02:17] discerns. It's the spirit of God inside
[1:02:19] of us. Amen. And but it what does it do?
[1:02:21] It throws up those red flags and it just
[1:02:23] says, "Hold on a second. Just hold on a
[1:02:26] second." And if we'll just hold on a
[1:02:28] moment and give him some time to show us
[1:02:30] what's going on, he'll reveal what's
[1:02:33] happening. But remember, the discerner
[1:02:35] is the spirit. And and it's like a it's
[1:02:38] like a a radio where anything other than
[1:02:40] the perfect frequency causes a squealing
[1:02:42] or a patchiness. Now, we don't really
[1:02:44] deal with this anymore cuz everything's
[1:02:45] digital. It tunes itself digitally. But
[1:02:47] in the old days, do you remember we used
[1:02:48] to have the radio and you could turn the
[1:02:50] dial and you had to have this steady
[1:02:52] hand and you get to this point where you
[1:02:54] just get close and you could hear what
[1:02:57] was coming over the radio, but it wasn't
[1:02:59] perfect.
[1:03:00] The words might be a bit scrambled. It
[1:03:03] might squeal a little bit. It might be a
[1:03:05] little bit patchy. You could get most of
[1:03:07] the message or the idea, but you
[1:03:08] couldn't get the whole thing. And what
[1:03:10] you're looking to do is just get that
[1:03:12] perfect little adjustment that get and
[1:03:14] it lock right into that signal and all
[1:03:15] of a sudden you get it all clear. Now,
[1:03:18] see, the thing is, if you're out in the
[1:03:19] middle of nowhere, you're satisfied
[1:03:21] maybe if you can get almost all of it.
[1:03:23] But remember, the the scripture says
[1:03:24] we're supposed to live by every word.
[1:03:26] Amen. We've got to have a clear signal
[1:03:28] that's coming in. Amen. And so the
[1:03:29] spirit of God inside of us, if things
[1:03:31] aren't clear, if things are unsure, then
[1:03:34] it throws up a flag and it says, "Hold
[1:03:35] on a second. We've got to wait and see
[1:03:36] what this is. We've got to look at this
[1:03:38] a little more closely. Let's not say
[1:03:40] amen just yet. Let's see where this is
[1:03:43] going to go." Amen. And so we've got to
[1:03:44] have the Holy Spirit to raise those
[1:03:46] warnings because it's the Holy Spirit
[1:03:48] catching your attention. Saying,
[1:03:50] "There's more to this than you're
[1:03:52] realizing." There's more to this than
[1:03:54] you're realizing. We're speaking on the
[1:03:56] mind of Christ. And we see from our
[1:03:57] opening scripture what Paul said to
[1:03:59] Timothy. He says, "For God has not given
[1:04:00] us a spirit of fear, but he's given us a
[1:04:03] spirit of power and of love and of a
[1:04:06] sound mind." So the Holy Spirit is the
[1:04:09] spirit of a sound mind. We're preaching
[1:04:12] on the mind of Christ. We know it's the
[1:04:14] mind of Christ, this sound mind. But
[1:04:16] this word sound has a very special
[1:04:18] meaning. It means it is a disciplined
[1:04:21] mind, self-controlled. It is sensible
[1:04:24] having wise discretion. And now catch
[1:04:27] this last one. It says driving behavior
[1:04:30] that is suitable for the situation.
[1:04:34] Driving behavior that is suitable for
[1:04:36] the situation. In other words, the mind
[1:04:38] of Christ, this Holy Spirit will give us
[1:04:41] the appropriate response or reaction or
[1:04:44] action for every situation we're facing.
[1:04:49] Remember what Jesus said? He said,
[1:04:50] "Listen, you can't judge me because I'm
[1:04:52] only doing what I'm told to do. You
[1:04:54] don't get to judge me because it's the
[1:04:56] father telling me to do it. And you
[1:04:57] can't judge the judge." And that's what
[1:04:59] the spirit of Christ in us, the sound
[1:05:01] mind that we're talking about. Amen. It
[1:05:04] will cause us to live a life that
[1:05:05] reflects the word day by day in every
[1:05:09] aspect of our life. Amen. It's the
[1:05:11] living expression of Christ in his
[1:05:13] people. Brother says it this way. He
[1:05:15] says, "If you have the mind of Christ,
[1:05:17] Christ expresses himself through you and
[1:05:20] shows that it's him." He says, "Now some
[1:05:23] people under illusions of things go out
[1:05:25] and become insane." He says, "Well, we
[1:05:27] know that's wrong. That's the devil
[1:05:28] trying to impersonate the real thing
[1:05:30] before it gets here. See, always a
[1:05:32] bogus." He says, "But a real man is to
[1:05:34] lose his own thoughts and his own
[1:05:36] thinking, not come up blindly like
[1:05:39] that." We've seen that that many times
[1:05:41] where people will take something from
[1:05:43] the word. They'll they'll come up with a
[1:05:44] new doctrine of their own making or
[1:05:46] they'll build a church and a movement
[1:05:47] around it. They'll they'll go play with
[1:05:49] rattlesnakes in a church cuz Mark 16
[1:05:52] says if they pick up a serpent or any
[1:05:54] deadly thing, it won't harm them. But we
[1:05:56] know that's insanity because Paul
[1:05:58] interpreted that scripture by a life
[1:06:00] experience. And Paul was walking around
[1:06:02] on an island that he'd been shipwrecked
[1:06:04] on, picked up some sticks, there was a
[1:06:06] snake in it, the snake bit him, and he
[1:06:08] just shook it off into the fire. And
[1:06:09] everyone was waiting for him to die.
[1:06:12] They said, "Well, he must be a bad
[1:06:13] person. He must be a real criminal cuz
[1:06:15] God's judged him by biting him." Then he
[1:06:17] shook the snake off into the fire. I
[1:06:18] just read this in my in my devotion, so
[1:06:20] I know I know the story very well. And
[1:06:22] they said, "Well, obviously he's a bad
[1:06:23] guy." And he shook it off. They're
[1:06:24] waiting for him to fall over. He doesn't
[1:06:26] fall over. And then they say, "He must
[1:06:28] be a god."
[1:06:30] Went from a criminal to a god. He says,
[1:06:33] "No, no, no. I'm just a man. I'm just a
[1:06:35] man."
[1:06:36] But that's the interpretation is that
[1:06:38] you don't go around inventing a
[1:06:40] situation for God to get you out of. You
[1:06:43] are not here to prove the word by making
[1:06:45] mistakes.
[1:06:46] Amen. That's we don't we don't tempt God
[1:06:49] by creating a situation then saying,
[1:06:51] "God, now get me out by your word."
[1:06:53] That's what Satan tempted Jesus with. He
[1:06:55] said, "Listen, do something that will
[1:06:57] require the word to be a reality in your
[1:06:59] life." Church, you know what you're
[1:07:00] supposed to do? You're supposed to live
[1:07:02] by the word to keep you out of those
[1:07:04] situations in the first place. And then
[1:07:06] if you stumble, if you fall, if you make
[1:07:09] a mistake, then that's where the word
[1:07:10] catches you. But we're not going around
[1:07:12] tempting God, saying, "God, I'm going to
[1:07:14] prove I'm a child of God by doing
[1:07:15] something I ought not to do and then
[1:07:17] trusting you to get me out." You know
[1:07:18] what he'll do? He'll let you learn your
[1:07:19] lesson and stay in there a while. We're
[1:07:21] not here to tempt God. Amen. People will
[1:07:23] go off the deep end on a single verse
[1:07:26] and not do the basics. And it's just a
[1:07:28] religious insanity.
[1:07:30] He says, "You come with your right
[1:07:32] senses.
[1:07:35] You come with your right senses." And
[1:07:36] Christ takes you over and expresses
[1:07:39] himself. He says, "And now when that
[1:07:41] happens," he says to the world, you're
[1:07:44] an insane person. And the church said,
[1:07:47] "Amen. We are insane to the world." He
[1:07:50] says, "But when Christ takes you over,
[1:07:51] he'll express that word right through
[1:07:54] you because it's who? It's him. He is
[1:07:57] the word." See, and then you can exceed
[1:07:59] the expression of Christ. He says, not
[1:08:01] some illusion of some sort, but a real
[1:08:04] genuine Christ expressing himself right
[1:08:07] through you. How beautiful. Let me put
[1:08:10] it this way. If it makes sense to the
[1:08:12] world, the life that we're living, then
[1:08:14] we're not living the Christian life.
[1:08:16] It's that simple. If uh if what we're
[1:08:18] doing and why we're doing it and how
[1:08:20] we're doing it makes sense to the world,
[1:08:21] church, we miss something somewhere
[1:08:23] because it's not the same. Amen. It's
[1:08:25] two very different things. We don't act
[1:08:27] by the same logic. We don't act by the
[1:08:28] same reason. We don't have the same
[1:08:30] drivers, the same forces in our life
[1:08:32] that get us to do things. Amen. And so
[1:08:34] our beliefs according to the world, they
[1:08:36] limit our opportunities. They limit our
[1:08:39] careers. They limit our fun. They limit
[1:08:41] our entertainment. They they limit just
[1:08:43] about everything. They look at what we
[1:08:44] believe as a limiting factor. And you
[1:08:47] know what, church? They're right. Praise
[1:08:49] the Lord. They're right. You know what
[1:08:51] it does? Because it limits pain.
[1:08:54] Unnecessary pain. It limits unnecessary
[1:08:57] scars. It limits unnecessary bruises and
[1:09:00] bumps. Amen. It limits unnecessary
[1:09:02] hardship. It doesn't put us into
[1:09:04] something of our own making. And it
[1:09:06] doesn't leave us there. That's what it
[1:09:08] limits. I've talked with many people in
[1:09:10] the church about the benefits of just
[1:09:12] doing what the word says. Even if you
[1:09:14] never get the Holy Ghost, just living
[1:09:15] according to the Bible will save you so
[1:09:18] much. It limits the damage.
[1:09:21] Doesn't put you into heaven,
[1:09:23] but it limits the damage. You'll live a
[1:09:25] better life down here if you live by the
[1:09:27] word, even if you don't have the Holy
[1:09:29] Spirit. Amen. Listen to what Paul said.
[1:09:32] We've read this before not too long ago.
[1:09:33] He says, "For they that are after the
[1:09:35] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[1:09:37] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:09:39] things of the spirit." He says, "For to
[1:09:41] be carnally minded is one thing, death."
[1:09:45] He says, "But to be spiritually minded
[1:09:47] is life and peace." See, they think it's
[1:09:51] limiting, but to us, it's life and
[1:09:54] peace. What a rest to know that you're
[1:09:56] secure in the arms of Christ because
[1:09:59] you're living under his word. You're
[1:10:00] living by his spirit. What a rest that
[1:10:03] ought to be when everything comes up.
[1:10:05] When all around my soul gives way, he
[1:10:07] then is my hope and stay. On Christ, the
[1:10:10] solid rock I stand. If you're walking
[1:10:13] with him, church, it's life and peace no
[1:10:15] matter what. Christians don't die. They
[1:10:19] just go from one place to another. We're
[1:10:22] not worried about these things.
[1:10:25] Paul said, "I've learned and whatsoever
[1:10:27] I have, therewith to be content."
[1:10:30] We're going to preach on that maybe next
[1:10:32] service to take that in. That's the
[1:10:34] mindset he talked about. He says, "But
[1:10:36] he says, because why does this work this
[1:10:37] way? Why is it death and life and
[1:10:39] peace?" He says, "Because the carnal
[1:10:41] mind is enmity against God, for it is
[1:10:44] not subject to the law of God, neither
[1:10:47] indeed can be." Now that notice this
[1:10:49] sound mind is contrary to the carnal
[1:10:52] mind or the mind of the world. The
[1:10:53] scripture says the natural mind, the
[1:10:55] carnal mind is enmity against God. That
[1:10:57] word enmity means hatred, hostility, in
[1:11:01] opposition or an enemy. In other words,
[1:11:04] it will never completely agree with the
[1:11:07] mind of Christ.
[1:11:09] See, it may seem like it agrees,
[1:11:13] but it only agrees to a certain point.
[1:11:16] It may agree on what's to be done, but
[1:11:18] it'll do it with the wrong motive and
[1:11:19] the wrong objective. Because the carnal
[1:11:21] mind is always self- serving. It's about
[1:11:23] gratification. Amen. So, it will only go
[1:11:26] so far before there's a division in the
[1:11:28] road and you realize, oh, it's not the
[1:11:30] same as the mind of Christ. Amen. That's
[1:11:32] just the way it works. They can't work
[1:11:34] together. Listen to this. Brother says,
[1:11:37] "The church needs tonight not a soft
[1:11:39] hybrid something. Soft and flabby like
[1:11:42] the church is just make a confession, be
[1:11:45] baptized, and you're a Christian." Now,
[1:11:47] church, that's what pretty much
[1:11:48] everybody's preaching. He says, "To be a
[1:11:52] Christian is selfdenial."
[1:11:56] Self-denial. Deny yourself. Take up your
[1:11:58] cross. Follow me daily. He says, "Today
[1:12:01] it's so soft and people call themselves
[1:12:03] Christian when it used to mean death to
[1:12:06] confess Christ." He says, "And you had
[1:12:08] to depend on him daily for everything
[1:12:11] you had need of." See, the mind of
[1:12:15] Christ brings control to me. Sorry, the
[1:12:18] mind of the world, the carnal mind
[1:12:19] brings control to me. He says, "You
[1:12:22] don't realize back when it first
[1:12:24] started," he says they had to rely on
[1:12:25] him for everything. They're living in
[1:12:27] caves. They were living meeting in
[1:12:28] tombs.
[1:12:30] being killed for what they believed and
[1:12:32] the a and the church flourished under
[1:12:35] those conditions because the hardship
[1:12:37] weeded out those that weren't real. But
[1:12:40] now it's so comfortable that anyone can
[1:12:42] sit in a church and say, "I'm a
[1:12:44] Christian."
[1:12:46] He's saying it's about self-denial.
[1:12:51] Church, when's the last time we prayed
[1:12:52] for something and God said no. And we
[1:12:54] said, "Praise the Lord."
[1:12:57] When's the last time God said no,
[1:13:02] self-denial,
[1:13:04] not my will, but thine be done? We read
[1:13:07] this quote last service, but just to
[1:13:09] refresh our minds, Brother Bram said, I
[1:13:11] want the mind of Christ. That's what I
[1:13:12] want. He says, and it's very always
[1:13:16] contrary to the world. In other words,
[1:13:19] what the world thinks is appropriate is
[1:13:21] never going to be appropriate for us.
[1:13:23] What's the what's appropriate for the
[1:13:24] religious world is not going to be
[1:13:26] appropriate for us because this believer
[1:13:28] is led by the spirit of God and the
[1:13:30] world is led by Satan and that's it.
[1:13:33] There's only two forces. Jesus said
[1:13:35] either you are if you are not for us
[1:13:37] then you are against us. There is no
[1:13:39] neutral ground. There is no neutral
[1:13:40] party. There is no Switzerland.
[1:13:43] If you're not for us you are
[1:13:45] automatically against us. We're seeing
[1:13:47] what's happening with Israel. Are you
[1:13:49] watching what's happening? Israel's
[1:13:50] God's time clock church.
[1:13:52] Now we've got Canada saying we're going
[1:13:56] to recognize a Palestinian state.
[1:13:59] France, the UK, all that's left is the
[1:14:02] Americans.
[1:14:04] And we've seen what they'll do to their
[1:14:05] allies if they don't do what they want.
[1:14:08] I'm not here to preach politics. I'm
[1:14:10] saying it's later than we think. They
[1:14:13] are so close. They're down to one ally
[1:14:15] in this world that supplies them with a
[1:14:18] ton of weapons. Without the US church,
[1:14:20] they've got nothing but God.
[1:14:23] That's it. That's all they have. We are
[1:14:26] so close. Amen. We have no alliances in
[1:14:29] this world. We don't alliance with the
[1:14:32] we don't ally ourselves with the
[1:14:34] community or with the government or
[1:14:35] anything like that. And listen, church,
[1:14:37] there may be common points of agreement.
[1:14:39] I'm not saying they don't exist. Amen.
[1:14:42] But be I'm not saying that that there
[1:14:44] aren't even things that we could maybe
[1:14:45] do. But the simple fact is in the end
[1:14:47] they are not led by the mind of Christ.
[1:14:50] They're not led by the spirit. They are
[1:14:51] not. And so there's going to come a
[1:14:53] point where we might agree on something
[1:14:54] up front, but then there's going to be a
[1:14:56] divergence that always happy. And so we
[1:14:57] stay apart from it. We're pilgrims and
[1:14:59] strangers. Amen. We're not a part of
[1:15:01] these things. We're under a different
[1:15:02] mind. We have a different purpose. We
[1:15:04] don't partner with another church or
[1:15:05] another group of professing Christians
[1:15:07] just because they call themselves
[1:15:08] Christians. We don't do that.
[1:15:12] That's one of the hardest things. It's
[1:15:13] one of the most difficult things to do
[1:15:14] is work with a professing Christian.
[1:15:17] It's not that it's not what we call us
[1:15:20] that makes us Christians.
[1:15:22] The word Christian is so abused at this
[1:15:25] point it has no meaning. Unfortunately,
[1:15:27] somebody say, "Hey, I'm a Christian.
[1:15:28] You're a Christian. We can get along."
[1:15:31] No, that's not what's going to make us
[1:15:32] get along. Never works that way. It
[1:15:35] never works that way. It's the Holy
[1:15:37] Spirit that makes us Christians. It's
[1:15:39] the Holy Spirit that makes us sons and
[1:15:41] daughters of God. It's not going to
[1:15:42] church. It's not being affiliated with
[1:15:44] something biblical. That's not what
[1:15:45] makes us Christians and that's not what
[1:15:47] makes other people Christians. It's the
[1:15:48] Holy Spirit inside of us that makes us a
[1:15:51] Christian. It takes Christ to be a
[1:15:52] Christian. That's the test we apply.
[1:15:54] Listen to what brother Brandham says
[1:15:55] here now.
[1:15:57] He says, "What if I come to you and say,
[1:15:59] say congregation, who is your friend?
[1:16:02] Who shows the fruit of the spirit?" He
[1:16:04] says, "Your kind old priest." Who comes
[1:16:06] to you in the hospital when you're sick?
[1:16:08] Your gentle old priest. That's right.
[1:16:10] Who is it that always loans you some
[1:16:11] money when you're up against it in a
[1:16:12] tight place? He says, "You members of
[1:16:14] his congregation, don't you go to your
[1:16:16] kind old priest and he loans you money?"
[1:16:18] He said, "See, who is it that's always
[1:16:20] loving and kind and showing the fruit of
[1:16:22] the spirit?" He says, "Your kind old
[1:16:23] priest." We're talking about the mind of
[1:16:25] Christ now. And for the sake of time
[1:16:27] today, I didn't read the next I'm not
[1:16:29] going to read the next few quotes, but
[1:16:31] he would he would take a contrast now.
[1:16:32] And then he says, "But let's compare
[1:16:34] that with Jesus Christ." And he says,
[1:16:37] "And he goes in and he takes a whip and
[1:16:40] he cleans out the tabernacle. He cleans
[1:16:42] out the money changers. He cleans out
[1:16:44] people that have turned it into a place
[1:16:45] of business." He goes and he rebukes the
[1:16:47] ministry. He rebukes the people for
[1:16:49] their unbelief.
[1:16:52] He draws them to a place of repentance.
[1:16:56] He says, "Compare that to your kind old
[1:16:57] priest." He says, "But you would say
[1:16:59] that priest has the fruit of the
[1:17:00] spirit." He says, "Now where is the
[1:17:03] fruit of the spirit?" He says, "It's not
[1:17:05] by speaking in tongues. is not by
[1:17:06] dancing in the spirit, not by joining
[1:17:08] church. He says Christian signs can out
[1:17:10] smother any of you on that sea and deny
[1:17:12] even Jesus Christ was divine.
[1:17:17] He says it's not that. He says, but it's
[1:17:19] the word living. He says there it is. If
[1:17:22] they'd have only looked, he was Messiah.
[1:17:24] He was the living word made manifest.
[1:17:28] See, we we made it so that if someone is
[1:17:30] like-minded, we can work with them.
[1:17:34] We can join an allegiance. We can be in
[1:17:35] business with them, business with them,
[1:17:37] whatever it might be. If they say
[1:17:38] they're a Christian, we can say that's
[1:17:39] good enough for me.
[1:17:41] Amen. At least they recognize Christ, we
[1:17:43] would say. But church, to be
[1:17:44] like-minded, we have to have the same
[1:17:46] mind. And that's the mind of Christ,
[1:17:48] which means we have to have the spirit
[1:17:50] of Christ as well. To be like-minded,
[1:17:52] church, we have to be spiritfilled.
[1:17:55] That's the only way it works. It's the
[1:17:57] only way that it works. Otherwise, it's
[1:17:58] not like-minded. The Holy Spirit gives
[1:18:00] us the mind of Christ, which yields us
[1:18:02] to the word, and that's the way that it
[1:18:03] has to work. Jesus said, "How can two
[1:18:05] walk together unless they agree?" And
[1:18:07] the thing is, okay, we agree on on who
[1:18:09] Christ was, and we might agree on water
[1:18:10] baptism. We might agree on this, that or
[1:18:12] the other. The basics of salvation, but
[1:18:14] church, usually the basics of salvation
[1:18:16] aren't even all the way. They don't even
[1:18:19] understand what the Holy Ghost is. They
[1:18:21] don't even understand what it means to
[1:18:22] have the Holy Ghost. And so, you can
[1:18:23] only go so far. And then you come up
[1:18:25] against a block. And then, what do you
[1:18:27] have to do? Do you have to choose
[1:18:29] relationship with Christ or relationship
[1:18:31] with that person?
[1:18:33] Not that you turn them away, but you can
[1:18:35] only go so far in your fellowship.
[1:18:38] And how many of us have h have friends
[1:18:39] that are in denominations and these
[1:18:41] different things and the thing is you
[1:18:43] come up against the point and then you
[1:18:44] got to stop and you keep trying to go
[1:18:47] forward and they've got a block there, a
[1:18:49] denominational block, a doctrinal block
[1:18:51] cuz they've believed everything they're
[1:18:53] going to believe. And so you have to
[1:18:55] keep moving on. Now you can have
[1:18:57] fellowship about those things. I heard a
[1:18:59] guy say not too long ago, he says,
[1:19:00] "Listen, if you love somebody and
[1:19:03] somebody else is talking about that same
[1:19:05] person, you're okay with listening to
[1:19:06] them talk about that person you love.
[1:19:09] I can listen to somebody preach on
[1:19:11] justification that's not in this
[1:19:12] message. It's a simple message. Nothing
[1:19:15] wrong with it, but they're not going to
[1:19:17] get me in a rapture." There's a word
[1:19:19] that keeps moving. There's a
[1:19:20] relationship. There's a revealing that's
[1:19:22] keeping on happening. Amen. You go
[1:19:24] listen, I think it was Alistister Beg uh
[1:19:27] did uh did that that uh that sermon
[1:19:29] about the thief and he and he goes up
[1:19:31] to, you know, that died on next to Jesus
[1:19:33] and he went up to the gates of heaven.
[1:19:35] They said, "Where are you from? Your
[1:19:36] name's not here. What makes you think
[1:19:38] you can get in?" He says, "The man in
[1:19:39] the middle told me I could get here."
[1:19:40] Tremendous sermon, tremendous servant on
[1:19:43] the salvational aspects of the Bible.
[1:19:46] What a wonderful ministry, but he can
[1:19:49] only take you so far. Can only take you
[1:19:51] so far. Amen.
[1:19:54] What's going to happen eventually is
[1:19:56] that their mind's going to butt up
[1:19:58] against your mind. Yours the mind of
[1:20:00] Christ and theirs is a different
[1:20:02] mindset. It's not the mind of Christ.
[1:20:04] It's not going all the way with God.
[1:20:06] Brother Ram says it very clearly. He
[1:20:07] says, "We are not the same." You are a
[1:20:11] separated people, holy unto the Lord,
[1:20:13] dedicated to the word and the spirit of
[1:20:16] God to do what? To bear fruit of his
[1:20:18] promise of this day.
[1:20:22] Usually what they're doing is they're
[1:20:23] dwelling on the promise of a latter day.
[1:20:27] And it wasn't that God wasn't in it. He
[1:20:29] was. You go read through your church
[1:20:31] ages. God working in Martin Luther, God
[1:20:34] working in Wesley. Spiritfilled men of
[1:20:38] God.
[1:20:39] Nothing wrong with it. But it kept
[1:20:41] moving. It kept moving. He says, "And
[1:20:44] you're not of them." He says, "I know
[1:20:46] that's awful strong, but that's the
[1:20:47] truth just the same. you're dedicated to
[1:20:49] a service in this last days, come out
[1:20:52] from amongst it. Like I said, that's one
[1:20:54] of the stickiest traps for for a
[1:20:56] believer today is working with a
[1:20:57] professing Christian because they'll
[1:20:59] say, "Well, I don't do that and I don't
[1:21:01] do that, but I do this and I do that."
[1:21:03] And what are you led into? Immediate
[1:21:05] conflict. Because there's a disagreement
[1:21:07] on the word.
[1:21:09] Two can't walk together unless they
[1:21:11] agree. That makes us stand out to
[1:21:14] people, not just church people, but
[1:21:16] everyone. I remember when I was in
[1:21:17] Dallas and we've been there for about a
[1:21:19] year and a half and and uh we felt led
[1:21:21] to go help with a church that was being
[1:21:23] uh set up there in in East Texas and and
[1:21:26] uh the job where I was, I was working uh
[1:21:30] with the chief engineer. He was he he
[1:21:32] had taken me under his wing. He was
[1:21:34] mentoring me for his position. He was
[1:21:35] going to retire in a few years. And so I
[1:21:37] was going to be the chief engineer of
[1:21:38] that firm, a big firm, big dollars, big
[1:21:41] bonuses every year, all of these
[1:21:43] different things. And I was talking to
[1:21:44] him and he said, ' Listen, I don't
[1:21:46] understand why you're doing this. He
[1:21:48] says, 'You've got an opportunity here.
[1:21:50] That company later sold for $228 million
[1:21:53] if I'm not mistaken. Big exit.
[1:21:57] He says, "I don't understand this.
[1:21:59] You're throwing away a big opportunity."
[1:22:00] And I says, "I've got to serve God while
[1:22:02] I can."
[1:22:04] I said, "And I feel led to do this.
[1:22:06] We're going to help with the church."
[1:22:08] And we probably talked for 15 or 20
[1:22:10] minutes. and we had gone on a road trip
[1:22:12] and we were we were kind of walking back
[1:22:13] from where we were in out in the field
[1:22:15] and he was just walking real slow. He
[1:22:17] wasn't walking fast. Get the car. He was
[1:22:18] just real slow cuz he wanted to talk
[1:22:20] this out with me. He wanted to convince
[1:22:21] me to stay. And I just said, "Listen,
[1:22:23] we're doing this. We're doing this. It's
[1:22:26] the way it's going to happen." But he
[1:22:27] couldn't wrap his head about that. And I
[1:22:29] know that God used that opportunity for
[1:22:31] me to heavily prepare me for ministry.
[1:22:34] That was a hard hard time of my life.
[1:22:37] But I'll tell you, church, the
[1:22:38] principles that God anchored in my soul
[1:22:40] there have kept me through so many
[1:22:41] storms ever since. If I didn't go there,
[1:22:44] I couldn't be a pastor today. That's the
[1:22:46] way God's got to work in those things.
[1:22:48] Amen. See, a sound mind is a crazy mind
[1:22:52] to the world. It's a crazy mind to the
[1:22:54] world. I told you before working in BC
[1:22:57] there, that company I left, I was in
[1:22:59] line to be the president, hundred
[1:23:00] million dollar company.
[1:23:02] I was a chosen one, literally picked for
[1:23:05] that role. And then God called me to
[1:23:07] come here. And guess what? I don't get
[1:23:10] to run a $100 million company anymore,
[1:23:13] but I get to preach his word. I get to
[1:23:15] serve in the kingdom of heaven. That's a
[1:23:17] wonderful thing. There's great
[1:23:19] contentment in that. Great contentment.
[1:23:21] The amazing thing, church, is you can
[1:23:22] make all the money in the world and have
[1:23:23] all the opportunity in your career, and
[1:23:25] it won't satisfy you if God's got
[1:23:26] something better. It won't do it. You'll
[1:23:28] find yourself absolutely wondering where
[1:23:31] your where your contentment is and where
[1:23:32] your rest is. It doesn't work. I'm a
[1:23:34] witness of that. Sound mind by the
[1:23:37] scriptures crazy to the world. Brother
[1:23:39] Brandon here, he's speaking of Abraham
[1:23:40] and Sarah about God trusting them to
[1:23:42] give them a baby even in their old age.
[1:23:44] He said, "What do you think a doctor
[1:23:45] would say today if an old man 100 years
[1:23:49] old and his wife 90 went down to the
[1:23:50] doctor's office and said, "Doctor, I
[1:23:52] want you to make arrangements at the
[1:23:54] hospital for my wife's going to have a
[1:23:56] baby." He says, "Why? You know that you
[1:23:58] know what they do to that man? They'd
[1:24:00] say he was crazy." He says, "That's the
[1:24:03] same thing they say about anybody who
[1:24:05] takes God at his word. They say they're
[1:24:09] crazy when they're led by the spirit,
[1:24:12] but sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:24:15] God." He said, "And the spirit of God
[1:24:16] will always bear witness of the word
[1:24:19] being the truth." No matter what people
[1:24:21] say, the word's right. He says, you see
[1:24:24] it, he says, "Oh, I love the word."
[1:24:25] Faith has to anchor on the word what God
[1:24:28] says.
[1:24:30] That means we're going to be open to
[1:24:32] criticism, wagging heads, wagging
[1:24:35] tongues,
[1:24:37] all sorts of things said about us behind
[1:24:39] our back, sometimes to our face, as the
[1:24:41] case may be. Amen. But like I said
[1:24:43] earlier, if our life makes sense to the
[1:24:45] world, we're not living a Christian
[1:24:46] life. We're not living a Christian life.
[1:24:49] People love our results so many times.
[1:24:52] I've shared with you and you've shared
[1:24:53] with me how you talk to people at work
[1:24:55] or clients or these different things and
[1:24:57] people love the the things you have
[1:24:59] going on. Somebody told me the other day
[1:25:01] his neighbor came up and he said, "Boy,
[1:25:02] you got such a wonderful thing happening
[1:25:04] with your family and your kids." Church,
[1:25:06] that's a great testimony to have cuz
[1:25:09] that man's had trouble in his life. And
[1:25:11] he's looking at what you have and he's
[1:25:12] looking what he has and he says, "Boy, I
[1:25:14] wish I had that." That's a testimony
[1:25:17] that we ought to have. Amen. But they
[1:25:19] can't grasp the idea that you can't get
[1:25:22] godly results without God. They don't
[1:25:25] think it's God. See, they just think
[1:25:26] you're doing it different. But it's God.
[1:25:29] It's the grace of God. It's the word of
[1:25:30] God being right, showing itself in our
[1:25:32] life that gives us these things inside
[1:25:34] of our lives. And it's us staying with
[1:25:36] it that keeps the results coming. It's
[1:25:39] us staying with it that keeps the
[1:25:40] results coming. Amen. It's amazing
[1:25:42] though how no matter what we do, we face
[1:25:45] criticism.
[1:25:46] Amen. spiritfilled, spirit-ledd people
[1:25:49] are always going to face criticism. It's
[1:25:51] the way that it works. Amen. Both from
[1:25:53] the world and from the religious realms.
[1:25:55] Look at Jesus now. He was dealing with
[1:25:56] this and he says, "For John the Baptist
[1:25:58] came neither eating bread nor drinking
[1:26:00] wine." And you say he had a devil. So
[1:26:03] John limited himself. He he kept himself
[1:26:05] back from certain things. And they said,
[1:26:07] "Well, John's got a devil." He says,
[1:26:09] "And then the son of man comes. Jesus
[1:26:11] comes eating and drinking. And you say,
[1:26:12] "Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine
[1:26:14] bber, a friend of publicans and
[1:26:16] sinners." So Jesus comes and starts to
[1:26:18] lives a normal life, we would say.
[1:26:22] And they say, "Well, he's got a devil,
[1:26:23] too. You can't win. If you don't do it,
[1:26:26] they call you devil. If you do it, they
[1:26:27] call you devil." He says, "But wisdom is
[1:26:31] justified of
[1:26:34] all
[1:26:36] all her children."
[1:26:39] That word justified means wisdom is
[1:26:41] acquitted. She is rendered innocent. She
[1:26:44] is proved and approved by all of her
[1:26:48] children. In other words, the results
[1:26:50] prove whether what you said was wisdom
[1:26:52] was really wisdom. Like I said, today
[1:26:55] they keep changing the idea of how we
[1:26:56] should raise our kids. They're changing
[1:26:59] it constantly. And guess what? The fruit
[1:27:01] show none of it is wisdom.
[1:27:04] But we raise our kids in a certain way.
[1:27:05] And people call it old school. They say
[1:27:07] it's too much. It's overbearing. But
[1:27:09] guess what? It has results. Cuz wisdom
[1:27:12] is proven of all her children. We've got
[1:27:14] a lot of people selling, and that's
[1:27:16] usually what it is, selling ministries
[1:27:18] and programs and ideas, and they're
[1:27:20] always promising a result, right? We've
[1:27:22] got a three-step program to get slim. I
[1:27:25] saw one the other day, a a 40-day
[1:27:27] program to get away from pornography. We
[1:27:29] got Dave Ramsey selling a a sevenstep
[1:27:31] plan to financial peace.
[1:27:34] We've got 30-day programs to build
[1:27:36] muscle. And everyone is selling
[1:27:38] something and their proof is it worked
[1:27:39] for me. Isn't that what they say?
[1:27:43] Nobody selling fitness is doing it as a
[1:27:45] chubby person. They're all ripped and
[1:27:48] muscular and lean or whatever it is,
[1:27:50] right?
[1:27:53] But the reality is they aren't usually
[1:27:55] doing what they told you. They're doing
[1:27:56] way more.
[1:27:58] If it's in the fitness world, it's
[1:28:00] usually heavily medicated. They're doing
[1:28:02] all sorts of things to keep themselves
[1:28:04] in a certain condition. They're not
[1:28:06] doing their program. They're doing their
[1:28:07] program plus a whole lot of other things
[1:28:09] to stay in a way that makes you think
[1:28:11] that what they're doing will work. But
[1:28:13] one thing I've learned, some of it by
[1:28:14] personal experience is that results vary
[1:28:16] and sometimes don't happen at all. Amen.
[1:28:19] We're all built different. Our bodies
[1:28:20] aren't the same. Our situations aren't
[1:28:22] the same. Our options aren't the same.
[1:28:23] And as much as we'd like to believe we
[1:28:25] can look like that person, get what that
[1:28:26] person has, the simple truth is most of
[1:28:28] the time we don't. We don't. Anybody
[1:28:31] ever gone on a diet and didn't become as
[1:28:33] slim as the person that was that was
[1:28:35] advertising it? Sisters, don't raise
[1:28:37] your hands.
[1:28:39] Men ever go to the gym and think that
[1:28:40] you were going to come out at the end of
[1:28:41] it looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[1:28:43] No.
[1:28:45] None of us have. It doesn't happen that
[1:28:48] way cuz they're doing way more than
[1:28:49] we're doing. They're doing way more than
[1:28:51] we're doing. And a lot of them are built
[1:28:53] special. They're freaks of nature. And
[1:28:56] I'm saying that in a good way. They're
[1:28:58] blessed with great genes and a body that
[1:28:59] works really well. Amen. So what do we
[1:29:01] do? We'll get some results, but we won't
[1:29:03] get their results. We'll get most of the
[1:29:05] way, but not all the way. We'll get
[1:29:06] better, but we won't get what? A
[1:29:10] complete change.
[1:29:12] But there's one thing that always works.
[1:29:15] There's one thing that always works, and
[1:29:16] it's the word of God quickened by the
[1:29:18] spirit. It always works. Scripture says
[1:29:22] that some bring 30fold, some bring
[1:29:24] 60fold, some bring 100fold, but it
[1:29:26] always works.
[1:29:28] Some of us have a little more. Some of
[1:29:29] us have a little less. But it always
[1:29:31] works. It always produces itself. True
[1:29:34] wisdom works all of its time. Jesus
[1:29:36] said, "All of wisdom's children are
[1:29:38] proof that it was wisdom in the first
[1:29:40] place." Amen. We're not here to sell
[1:29:42] this word. It's free.
[1:29:45] It's free.
[1:29:47] You don't have to pay tithe to me to get
[1:29:48] the word.
[1:29:50] We'll give you whatever we have, but you
[1:29:53] got to accept it. You've got to accept
[1:29:55] it. And the thing is, nobody trusts a
[1:29:57] free gift these days. Nothing's free,
[1:30:00] but the word is free. It's free to you.
[1:30:03] Now, there's a price to pay after you
[1:30:04] take it.
[1:30:06] But the reward is always worth it.
[1:30:09] People that day, they looked at John the
[1:30:10] Baptist, they said, "He's got a devil."
[1:30:12] They looked at Jesus, said, "He's got a
[1:30:13] devil." And what' they do? They turned
[1:30:14] back to their synagogues. They turned
[1:30:15] back to their scrolls. They turned back
[1:30:16] to their priesthood. And it took them
[1:30:18] down a road to religious hell because
[1:30:20] they didn't recognize what was in the
[1:30:22] middle of them. Remember how we said a
[1:30:24] couple services ago that the church is
[1:30:26] built on the revelation of Jesus Christ?
[1:30:28] It's not just built on Christ. It's
[1:30:29] built on the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:32] Why? Because Jesus Christ is God
[1:30:34] revealing himself in many ways through
[1:30:36] time and history. We see Jesus 2,000
[1:30:39] years ago, but we miss him today.
[1:30:42] If we do that, we're building on
[1:30:43] something that's done and gone. Amen.
[1:30:46] We're not building on the present. We're
[1:30:48] building on the past. If I can put it
[1:30:49] this way, we're building on the I was,
[1:30:51] not the I am.
[1:30:54] You can't build on yesterday's
[1:30:56] experience, church. Can't build just on
[1:30:59] yesterday's revelation. You got to keep
[1:31:01] building. You got to keep going. Amen.
[1:31:02] And that's always the challenge for
[1:31:04] every age is can you catch God revealing
[1:31:06] himself right then rather than catching
[1:31:09] it in hindsight. Amen. Will you catch
[1:31:11] his word? Will you catch it while it's
[1:31:13] happening rather than after it's said
[1:31:15] and done? church. I don't want to
[1:31:17] realize the rapture's happened after
[1:31:19] it's happened. I want to be the rapture.
[1:31:22] I want to be the the witness and the
[1:31:24] testimony that God has had a bride that
[1:31:26] will come out of this age that will
[1:31:27] overcome and sit with him in his throne.
[1:31:30] I want to be in it. Amen. We read that
[1:31:31] quote about the fruit of the spirit and
[1:31:33] people think it's the kindly old priest
[1:31:35] or the lovely little person, but the
[1:31:37] answer is the fruit of the spirit is
[1:31:38] where the word of the hour is being
[1:31:40] produced.
[1:31:42] And it'll do it with the right attitude.
[1:31:44] It'll do it with a right response. Amen.
[1:31:48] Lots of people can be nice and can be
[1:31:51] observed as the fruit of the spirit, but
[1:31:53] you'll find when the word of God comes
[1:31:55] along, suddenly the attitude changes.
[1:31:58] Suddenly they aren't so nice. They
[1:32:00] aren't so willing. They aren't so
[1:32:01] gracious. Why? Because the word puts
[1:32:03] them in an uncomfortable position
[1:32:06] and they react poorly.
[1:32:09] What do they do? They persecute the real
[1:32:11] church. They look down at us.
[1:32:14] Amen. The fruit of the spirit is the
[1:32:16] result of the life of Christ in us. It's
[1:32:19] the result of the Holy Spirit and it
[1:32:21] absolutely is shown in our life. Amen.
[1:32:24] We read that that that that sound mind
[1:32:26] is is the one that is approved and
[1:32:28] accepted with behavior suitable for the
[1:32:30] situation. But we think so many times
[1:32:32] that means we've always got to be soft
[1:32:34] and gentle and loving. Amen. But other
[1:32:37] times we know that it is straight and it
[1:32:39] is hard. Amen. It is it cuts to the core
[1:32:42] because the mind of Christ remember it
[1:32:44] not only blessed the little children and
[1:32:46] had this beautiful uh sermon on the
[1:32:48] mount and the biatitudes but it also
[1:32:50] went in and it called the priests vipers
[1:32:52] and snakes and it whipped the people out
[1:32:54] of the temple and it was all the love of
[1:32:56] God. It was all the fruit of the spirit.
[1:32:59] Amen church. Did Jesus have the fruit of
[1:33:01] the spirit?
[1:33:02] He was the fruit of the spirit. Amen. He
[1:33:06] he he was the the very production of the
[1:33:08] word itself. Amen. But love doesn't
[1:33:10] God's love doesn't always look like love
[1:33:12] to the carnal mind. And that's the
[1:33:14] rejection that we face so many times.
[1:33:17] Amen. That that he can preach the
[1:33:19] beautiful sermon one day and heal the
[1:33:21] entire crowd one day and he can bless
[1:33:23] the children and the next he can come in
[1:33:24] and he can cut us to the core because
[1:33:26] we're not where we ought to be. Because
[1:33:28] we're not feeding our faith. Because
[1:33:30] we're not doing what he asked us to do.
[1:33:32] Amen. Remember, love means love of God.
[1:33:36] And the love of God is not the same as
[1:33:37] everything else. The love of God is the
[1:33:39] only thing that will help us love people
[1:33:40] the right way. And it comes with the
[1:33:43] mind of Christ to do what is acceptable
[1:33:45] in God's eyes in every situation.
[1:33:48] Now, that's the scripture speaking of
[1:33:51] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago. And most
[1:33:53] people can recognize him 2,000 years
[1:33:55] ago, but let me tell you, many of them
[1:33:57] still don't recognize truly who he was
[1:33:58] then. They didn't. And if you can't
[1:34:01] recognize them then, church, you're not
[1:34:02] going to recognize them today. If if you
[1:34:05] know they say hindsight's 2020, but if
[1:34:07] you can't see in hindsight, what's the
[1:34:09] opp what's the chances you're going to
[1:34:10] see today? If you can't see what God's
[1:34:12] done, if you can't see the pattern, then
[1:34:14] you're not going to see the pattern
[1:34:15] today except God by grace would open
[1:34:17] your eyes. Amen. They see a man, they
[1:34:20] see a prophet, they see a a second
[1:34:22] person of the Trinity, but they don't
[1:34:24] see the word made flesh. And church,
[1:34:27] I've heard it and seen it. Amen.
[1:34:31] And they can't even recognize that he
[1:34:32] was the literal word. And so they will
[1:34:34] criticize Jesus. I'm telling you, I've
[1:34:37] seen it and I've heard it. Not in this
[1:34:38] message, by God's grace. But they call
[1:34:41] him misogynistic.
[1:34:42] They call him racist. They call him
[1:34:44] sexist and all sorts of things. I have
[1:34:46] heard so-called preachers correct Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ from the pulpit.
[1:34:53] Church, if you're going to correct him
[1:34:54] back then, what are the chances you're
[1:34:56] going to receive him today? It's not
[1:34:58] going to happen. Amen. Remember, Christ
[1:35:01] means what? the anointed one. It means
[1:35:04] the anointed one. Christ was the
[1:35:05] anointed word for that time and season.
[1:35:08] Watch what the Bible says now and we're
[1:35:10] starting to close.
[1:35:11] He says, "In the beginning was the word
[1:35:15] and the word was with God and the word
[1:35:18] was God." Church, that's the pattern.
[1:35:22] What? This is a beautiful pattern. And
[1:35:25] we're not going to get there today,
[1:35:26] Brother Grant. We're going to get there
[1:35:27] a little bit away, but you stay with me.
[1:35:29] You come back Wednesday, we'll get
[1:35:30] there. The pattern is the word is with
[1:35:33] him and then the pattern is the word
[1:35:35] becomes him.
[1:35:37] Oh, I could run. I could run.
[1:35:43] When the word was with him,
[1:35:47] that's when time started
[1:35:49] because it was a thought and then it was
[1:35:52] spoken and it became the word. And when
[1:35:54] he spoke the word, time began. Okay?
[1:35:58] Before that was eternity. But he spoke
[1:36:00] the word and it came into existence. It
[1:36:03] was with God. It was in his mind. And
[1:36:05] then he spoke it and it became a
[1:36:07] reality. Reality. And God stepped into
[1:36:09] the reality of his own word. He wrapped
[1:36:12] himself with his word reality.
[1:36:15] That's what happened there. Okay. But
[1:36:17] now we're going to skip for the sake of
[1:36:19] time all the things he says next. But
[1:36:20] then we're going to go to twe 12. And
[1:36:22] now he says, "As many as received him,
[1:36:25] who the word
[1:36:28] as many as received the living word, to
[1:36:31] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:36:33] God, even to them that believe on his
[1:36:36] name." So it's receiving the word that
[1:36:39] shows that we are sons and daughters of
[1:36:41] God. And it's the spirit of God that
[1:36:44] confirms that we are sons and god, sons
[1:36:47] and daughters of God, and that we
[1:36:48] actually receive the word for our day.
[1:36:51] If you if you believe the word and you
[1:36:54] don't receive the spirit, you haven't
[1:36:55] believed the word. You haven't received
[1:36:57] it. Because when you receive it, it will
[1:36:59] come in. The spirit of it will follow
[1:37:01] behind it. Amen. That's what shows that
[1:37:03] we've truly received and accepted the
[1:37:05] word of God. We receive it. That shows
[1:37:07] that we're a son of God. And then God
[1:37:09] confirms it by the spirit in our life.
[1:37:11] He says, "Now which were born, we were
[1:37:13] born not of blood, nor of the will of
[1:37:15] the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[1:37:17] of God." We're not here by chance, by
[1:37:19] luck, by happen stance. We're here by
[1:37:20] the will of God. He says, "And the word
[1:37:23] was made flesh and dwelt among us." So,
[1:37:26] we got a pattern. The word is with God.
[1:37:28] The word was God. The word is made
[1:37:29] flesh. He says, "And dwelt among us, and
[1:37:32] we beheld his glory, the glory as of the
[1:37:35] only begotten of the father, full of
[1:37:37] grace and truth." So, see, we can look
[1:37:40] 2,000 years ago and we can see that the
[1:37:42] word was made flesh in Jesus Christ.
[1:37:44] It's the living word anointed by the
[1:37:46] spirit of God. That's what what and who
[1:37:48] Christ was. Amen. So that means if the
[1:37:52] pattern holds true that Christ is the
[1:37:54] anointed word today. Can we say amen to
[1:37:57] that? The pattern is that Christ is the
[1:38:00] anointed word. The pattern can't change
[1:38:03] but the manifestation can change. The
[1:38:06] pattern can can't. The manifestation can
[1:38:09] remember what Jesus said. He said they
[1:38:11] said we are Abraham's seed. He says
[1:38:14] before Abraham was I am. and they tried
[1:38:18] to stone him.
[1:38:20] Why? Because before Christ came 2,000
[1:38:23] years ago, there was a mazdc.
[1:38:26] There was a pillar of fire. There was a
[1:38:27] pillar of cloud. There was a wheel in
[1:38:29] the middle of the wheel. There was a
[1:38:30] stone that the builders have rejected.
[1:38:32] There was a burning bush. There was an
[1:38:34] angel of the Lord. And it was all God
[1:38:36] revealing himself.
[1:38:38] Amen.
[1:38:40] And what? Only a few people caught it.
[1:38:43] Abraham caught it on the plains of
[1:38:44] memory. Lord,
[1:38:47] Lord. Just a man walking in flesh.
[1:38:51] And he says,"Lord." And the Lord said,
[1:38:54] "Shall I reveal to Abraham what I'm
[1:38:55] about to do? I personal pronoun God in
[1:38:59] flesh.
[1:39:01] See the pattern. See the manifestation.
[1:39:05] Don't look on the outside. You got to
[1:39:07] look what it produces. You got to look
[1:39:09] what it produces." Church, the shell
[1:39:11] fools everyone. It fooled everyone in
[1:39:13] Jesus day. Don't look at the shell. Look
[1:39:16] at the fruit. Buy the word. Judge it
[1:39:18] accordingly. Amen.
[1:39:20] Let's bring it down to our selves
[1:39:22] tonight as we start to this morning as
[1:39:24] we start to close. Listen to what Paul
[1:39:26] says. He says, "Ye are our epistle
[1:39:29] written in our hearts, known and read of
[1:39:31] all men." In other words, Paul's saying,
[1:39:33] "You are the word that I've been
[1:39:34] preaching."
[1:39:36] Church, this is such a beautiful thing.
[1:39:39] We've talked about this before, how that
[1:39:41] the Corinthian has to become the
[1:39:43] Ephesians.
[1:39:45] First Corinthians is all judgment, isn't
[1:39:47] it? You guys are messed up. You're doing
[1:39:49] this. You're doing that. I hear this is
[1:39:50] among you. I hear that's among you. Find
[1:39:52] it hard to believe. Here's how you fix
[1:39:53] it. But then he comes back in second
[1:39:55] Corinthians. He says, "You're the word
[1:39:56] I've been preaching about."
[1:39:59] That shows there's hope. Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] There's hope for every one of us. I
[1:40:03] don't care how backsliden we are, how
[1:40:05] fallen we are, how messed up we are.
[1:40:07] There's hope that we can go from a first
[1:40:08] Corinthians to a second Corinthians and
[1:40:10] into an Ephesians. Amen. He says, "For
[1:40:13] as much as ye are," this is a beautiful
[1:40:16] phrase, "m manifestly declared to be the
[1:40:19] epistle of Christ minister by us,
[1:40:22] written not with ink, but with the
[1:40:25] spirit of the living God, not in tables
[1:40:28] of stone, but in fleshy tables of the
[1:40:32] heart." What's writing this story,
[1:40:34] church? Hallelujah. What's writing the
[1:40:37] story? It's not me. It's the spirit of
[1:40:39] God inside of me. And it's writing the
[1:40:41] word out in our lives. Paul says, "Ye
[1:40:44] are manifestly declared." That that
[1:40:46] phrase literally means, "You are the
[1:40:49] revelation.
[1:40:51] You are the evidence. You are the
[1:40:54] appearance."
[1:40:58] Church, what are we this morning?
[1:41:01] Paul's saying, "You are the revelation,
[1:41:03] the evidence, the appearance of the
[1:41:05] gospel of Jesus Christ."
[1:41:09] Paul said, "You're it. We don't need to
[1:41:11] give letters of commendation. We don't
[1:41:13] need to to show who we're affiliated
[1:41:15] with. All they have to do is look at you
[1:41:16] as proof of our ministry." Wisdom is
[1:41:19] known of all her children.
[1:41:22] When you preach the word, it produces
[1:41:24] word children.
[1:41:26] He says, "You people are proof. You're
[1:41:28] what I preach. You become the word that
[1:41:31] you received,
[1:41:34] church. This wasn't over the period of
[1:41:36] 15, 20 years. This was quick within a
[1:41:39] year that they received the word of
[1:41:42] correction from Paul. And he says, "Now
[1:41:44] you've become the word."
[1:41:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He says, "And a
[1:41:50] man that's got the spirit of God in him
[1:41:52] or a woman," I love how he adds it in.
[1:41:54] Sisters, you're not left out. lives that
[1:41:57] word lives right out in them. There's
[1:41:59] your evidence of the spirit. You live
[1:42:01] the word. You produce the word. He says
[1:42:04] that's the heartbeat, the predestinated
[1:42:06] for the word of the Lord comes to them.
[1:42:08] And he says they are the word to the
[1:42:12] people. They're written epistles read of
[1:42:15] all men. See, church, our our our
[1:42:18] confession, our testimony, our witness
[1:42:21] is that we are the word, not just that
[1:42:23] we believe the word. You see the
[1:42:25] difference? Cuz remember what Paul said.
[1:42:28] He says, "Have you received the Holy
[1:42:30] Ghost since you believed?"
[1:42:33] The believing is essential. Without
[1:42:35] belief, you can't receive it. But once
[1:42:36] you believe it, has he come in and
[1:42:38] confirmed it in your life and started
[1:42:40] producing the very thing that you're
[1:42:42] talking about.
[1:42:43] Everyone's saying they believe it. But
[1:42:46] how many are it? Let's look in the
[1:42:48] mirror of the word this morning. Say,
[1:42:49] "Lord, am I your word this morning, or
[1:42:52] am I just believing it?"
[1:42:55] If you're believing it, don't stop. Keep
[1:42:57] believing, but don't let it just stay at
[1:42:59] believing. Say, "Lord, let it become a
[1:43:01] reality inside of my life."
[1:43:03] Amen. It's not just good people. It's
[1:43:06] not just nice people or wouldn't harm a
[1:43:08] soul people, but it's people that are
[1:43:10] living out the word for their day. It's
[1:43:12] the word of God revealed. It's the
[1:43:14] evidence. It's the appearance of Jesus
[1:43:16] Christ today. That's who we are. That's
[1:43:19] who we are. That's what we're preaching.
[1:43:22] That's what this whole series on the
[1:43:23] Holy Ghost is about is to bring us to
[1:43:25] this point
[1:43:27] and not just say we've received it, but
[1:43:29] we've become it.
[1:43:32] We're going to get into this. Brother
[1:43:33] Bram said when he looked at that end
[1:43:34] time bride walking up, he said she was
[1:43:38] the
[1:43:40] word.
[1:43:42] Not just she believed it. Not just she
[1:43:45] went to a message church. She was the
[1:43:48] word. That's the transformation, church.
[1:43:51] That's the transformation we're talking
[1:43:52] about. Paul says this, "Whereof I am
[1:43:56] made a minister according to the
[1:43:58] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:44:00] for you to fulfill the word of God, even
[1:44:03] the mystery which had been hid from ages
[1:44:06] and from generations." This is the
[1:44:08] hidden mystery all through scripture.
[1:44:10] See, Christ was hidden there, but so was
[1:44:13] the bride. He says, "But now is made
[1:44:16] manifest to who?" His saints. Remember,
[1:44:20] we talked about this before. There's a
[1:44:21] mystery of godliness and there's a
[1:44:23] mystery of iniquity. And both of them
[1:44:25] are revealed in the so-called church.
[1:44:28] Amen. They're both within the confines
[1:44:29] of professioning Christianity. But
[1:44:31] here's Paul says this beautiful mystery,
[1:44:33] the good mystery is being revealed and
[1:44:36] it's happening now to the true
[1:44:37] believers. He says to whom God would
[1:44:39] make known what is the riches of the
[1:44:42] glory of this mystery among the
[1:44:45] Gentiles. Church, here's our heritage.
[1:44:47] This is our birthright right here. This
[1:44:48] is our promise. This is our word. It is
[1:44:50] which is Christ in you. The hope of
[1:44:54] glory. The hope of glory means the
[1:44:56] expectation of glorification.
[1:45:00] That's a sermon in itself. Remember what
[1:45:02] Jesus said. He said, "Father, glorify me
[1:45:05] with the glory that I had before."
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; What was it? The word was with God. The
[1:45:12] word was God. God stepping down into his
[1:45:16] word.
[1:45:18] stepping down into his word. That is our
[1:45:20] glorification.
[1:45:23] Amen. God doing what? Stepping into his
[1:45:26] word bride to restore her back to her
[1:45:30] original condition that she had before
[1:45:34] the foundation of the world. Because the
[1:45:37] word was with God. The word was God. The
[1:45:40] word was made flesh. Amen.
[1:45:44] He says this. So believers of the word
[1:45:46] and the spirit must be one. Believers,
[1:45:49] the word and the spirit are absolutely
[1:45:50] one. You don't do your own thinking. You
[1:45:52] don't use your own mind. He says, "Isn't
[1:45:54] that wonderful? The mind that was in
[1:45:56] Christ is in you. The mind is in Christ.
[1:45:58] And you'll take the word just like he
[1:46:00] did because he was the word." Now catch
[1:46:02] this. He says, "And the mind of Christ
[1:46:04] in you. You are the word. You're God's
[1:46:09] living word, representatives of him here
[1:46:12] on earth." That's right. continuing the
[1:46:15] work. He says the church should be that
[1:46:17] way. And when so the Bible is manifested
[1:46:20] again like in the early days of the
[1:46:22] disciples, he says just like the
[1:46:25] disciple, the Bible is living again in
[1:46:29] you,
[1:46:30] church. We're getting to some heavy
[1:46:32] stuff now. Deep waters.
[1:46:35] We got to let go of the shoreline.
[1:46:38] Say, Lord, let your word be born. Lord,
[1:46:40] let it grow. let it rise up into this.
[1:46:44] But the thing is, church, it is so
[1:46:46] simple.
[1:46:48] It's not a show. It's not a public show.
[1:46:51] It's a humble, victorious Christian
[1:46:54] walk. It's the overcomer. It's the
[1:46:57] overcomer. Amen. This isn't just a
[1:47:00] lifestyle. This isn't just a community.
[1:47:03] This isn't just a church body. It's not
[1:47:05] just a group of of really good people.
[1:47:07] We have those and we're thankful for
[1:47:09] church, but we're moving way beyond
[1:47:11] that. Amen. In this final age, we're so
[1:47:13] far beyond a nice community. We're so
[1:47:16] far beyond it. We are the word. We are
[1:47:19] the word. Amen. That's not our identity.
[1:47:22] All those other things. Watch this now
[1:47:24] as we close this out. And this is where
[1:47:25] we'll pick up on Wednesday evening, Lord
[1:47:27] willing.
[1:47:29] Revelation 1 says, I am.
[1:47:32] We're speaking of the I am. I am alpha
[1:47:35] and omega. the beginning and the ending,
[1:47:39] sayeth the Lord, which is, which was,
[1:47:42] and which is to come, the Almighty. Now
[1:47:45] remember, the church is built on the
[1:47:47] revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[1:47:50] book of Revelation is the final
[1:47:52] revealing of Christ from start to
[1:47:53] finish. Amen. It's the whole thing. He
[1:47:56] says, now notice when and where he
[1:47:58] identifies himself. He doesn't say, "I'm
[1:48:00] the beginning to the ending." He says,
[1:48:02] "I am I am the beginning and I am the
[1:48:07] ending.
[1:48:09] Not everything in between." Amen. It's
[1:48:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:48:14] and forever. And he only fully
[1:48:16] identifies himself as the I am at the
[1:48:19] beginning and at the end and not in
[1:48:21] between. His full identification is at
[1:48:25] the beginning and it's at the end. Amen.
[1:48:27] So the beginning is the first church age
[1:48:28] under Paul.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what do we have then at the
[1:48:32] end? We have a further what a a a a
[1:48:36] restoration that comes under that Elijah
[1:48:38] message in the final church age. And
[1:48:41] that is the last revealing of Christ.
[1:48:43] She is the last voice to the last age.
[1:48:45] Amen. He only says I am to those two
[1:48:49] groups.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the word. Amen.
[1:48:52] Doesn't mean he wasn't shown in the
[1:48:54] others. Doesn't mean there weren't
[1:48:55] reflections of him there. Church, you
[1:48:57] look at those those uh messengers to the
[1:48:59] church ages. They were powerful men in
[1:49:01] many cases. My wife and I were talking
[1:49:03] about Martin the other day and so I went
[1:49:04] and looked at the works that he did.
[1:49:06] Raised people from the dead three
[1:49:07] different times. Came up to a castle.
[1:49:09] They wouldn't let him in. And the the
[1:49:11] spirit told him to lay down and pray.
[1:49:12] And he did. And the doors came open.
[1:49:14] Tied himself to a He said, "I'll tie
[1:49:16] myself to a tree to the heathens and
[1:49:18] said, "You chop it down, and if it
[1:49:20] doesn't crush me, then you'll listen to
[1:49:21] my message." They said, "We've got you
[1:49:23] now." They tied him to a tree that was
[1:49:24] on a hill that was leaning. And they
[1:49:26] tied him on the downside. They chopped
[1:49:28] the tree down and it fell up the hill
[1:49:29] and crushed them the heathens.
[1:49:31] Oh, it's not that God God's always had a
[1:49:33] witness, but his identification is the
[1:49:36] first and the last, the beginning and
[1:49:38] the ending. Amen. But in the end,
[1:49:40] there's a restoration that happens.
[1:49:41] That's Malachi 4:6. It's Matthew 17:11.
[1:49:44] It's Revelation 10:7. And Jesus Christ
[1:49:47] is identified and revealed one last
[1:49:50] time. Now, here's the thing. He did it
[1:49:52] through a prophet. And we all say,
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; "Amen." But it didn't end with a
[1:49:57] prophet. The prophet is not the bride
[1:49:59] entire.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, according to the word, there has
[1:50:04] to be at least four other people in the
[1:50:05] bride because he's got a five-fold
[1:50:06] ministry.
[1:50:09] But we Paul Paul's talking to the leoty.
[1:50:12] And he says, "Ye are our epistle. You
[1:50:14] are the mystery of God being revealed.
[1:50:16] you,
[1:50:18] not just me, praise the Lord, not just
[1:50:20] brother Grant as a minister, not just
[1:50:22] brother Jill, but the whole group of the
[1:50:24] bride is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:50:26] for this day. Burbam says it this way,
[1:50:29] and it's our final quote. He says, "And
[1:50:31] the real church is what we have real
[1:50:34] this morning." Is it real? He says, "The
[1:50:38] real bornagain people of this age,
[1:50:41] they're filled with the Holy Ghost. They
[1:50:43] are the typost of this scripture that's
[1:50:46] got to be fulfilled in these last days.
[1:50:49] Church, let me before I get to that
[1:50:51] great line. What is a typost? It is that
[1:50:54] which does not move no matter what. We
[1:50:58] are the typost because we will not leave
[1:51:01] the word.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; We will not leave the word. He says,
[1:51:05] "And when they do that," he says they
[1:51:07] are the ultimate.
[1:51:10] I don't even know how he said that
[1:51:13] about little old you and I. But he says
[1:51:15] they are the ultimate. Why? Because it's
[1:51:19] God's ultimate because it's his word and
[1:51:22] the word is Christ the type. He says
[1:51:25] there's no way to get away from it. It's
[1:51:27] something that holds you.
[1:51:30] Something holds you. So you won't move.
[1:51:34] It's not me that's holding on. It's him
[1:51:35] that's holding on. It's Christ anchored
[1:51:38] in my soul. the engrafted word. When
[1:51:40] it's engrafted, that means you can't get
[1:51:42] it out. Paul says it's written in your
[1:51:44] heart by the spirit. When it's engraved
[1:51:47] in, church, when something's engraved,
[1:51:49] you can't get it out. It's there. It's
[1:51:51] there. It's written in something that
[1:51:53] cannot be changed. Amen. He says the
[1:51:56] real bornagain people filled with the
[1:51:59] Holy Ghost are the typost of the
[1:52:01] scripture. They are the fulfillment.
[1:52:03] They are the ultimate because the word
[1:52:06] speaks through their life. Amen. Can we
[1:52:10] say praise the Lord this morning?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. Amen. It's
[1:52:14] not me. It's not you. He says it's the
[1:52:16] living word. It's the living word in us.
[1:52:19] It's the spirit of God working through
[1:52:20] us. And we're not taking anything to
[1:52:22] ourselves. That's the beauty of this. I
[1:52:24] could not say this of myself. I would
[1:52:26] not dare to say this about myself.
[1:52:28] That's why I needed a prophet to say,
[1:52:29] "You are the word made flesh."
[1:52:32] Because people won't do it today. They
[1:52:34] won't do it. They'll put it all on
[1:52:35] Christ, but they forget that Christ has
[1:52:37] come down. The word was with God. The
[1:52:38] word was God. The word was made flesh,
[1:52:40] and they can't see him coming down and
[1:52:41] being flesh all over again. That they
[1:52:43] could be the word for their day. We're
[1:52:45] just yielding ourselves. Remember, he
[1:52:47] said that the Christian life is
[1:52:49] self-denial. We're dying out. We're
[1:52:52] laying it down. Amen. And letting the
[1:52:53] spirit of God work through us. What's it
[1:52:56] going to do? It's going to produce a
[1:52:57] bride. That is the word. That's what she
[1:53:00] is. Amen. Listen, what was Christ? He
[1:53:03] was the word fulfilled.
[1:53:06] And if we are bone of his bone and flesh
[1:53:08] of his flesh, Brother Grant, we've got
[1:53:09] to be the word. You can't come out of
[1:53:12] the word and be anything else but the
[1:53:13] word. But there's got to be a
[1:53:15] restoration to bring us back and join us
[1:53:17] together. Amen. It's the spirit of the
[1:53:19] living God quickening this message for
[1:53:21] our age. Amen. What do we do, church?
[1:53:24] Receive it, believe it, wrap yourself in
[1:53:27] it, and let the spirit of God go to
[1:53:29] work. That's all it is. It's so simple.
[1:53:33] Let me tell you this.
[1:53:36] How you going to get dressed in the
[1:53:37] word?
[1:53:40] The bride has made herself ready. We
[1:53:43] talked about this. How long does it take
[1:53:44] a bride to get ready? Oh, she's not
[1:53:47] ready in in 15 minutes. That's for sure.
[1:53:50] No, sir. That's just the toenails.
[1:53:54] It takes a while to get the bride ready
[1:53:56] cuz everything's got to be perfectly in
[1:53:57] place. The hair's got to be right. The
[1:54:00] dress got to be right. The veil's got to
[1:54:01] be right. The nails got to be right. The
[1:54:03] clothing has to be right. The smell has
[1:54:05] to be right. Everything has to be right.
[1:54:08] But what's she doing? She's just adding
[1:54:09] it bit by bit by bit. And it produces
[1:54:12] this beautiful bride. Amen.
[1:54:16] We're just getting dressed a little bit
[1:54:17] every day. Amen. And it's doing a work
[1:54:20] inside of our lives. I want to encourage
[1:54:22] you, make it a daily effort.
[1:54:26] That's our portion. We've got to make
[1:54:27] ourselves ready. He has provided
[1:54:29] everything we have need of, but we're
[1:54:31] the ones that have to choose to wrap
[1:54:33] ourselves in it. Amen. I pray God help
[1:54:35] us to wrap ourselves in his word day by
[1:54:38] day. That people could look at us and
[1:54:39] they can see Christ.
[1:54:42] They can see Christ.
[1:54:44] Amen. That's that's our goal, isn't it?
[1:54:46] That they'd see Christ in us. Amen.
[1:54:49] Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus.
[1:54:52] Lord, this message. What a wonderful
[1:54:54] thing we've received.
[1:54:56] Lord God, there's things that your
[1:54:57] prophet said that I just can't barely
[1:54:59] fathom.
[1:55:01] Lord, that we would think we have some
[1:55:03] sort of audacity to say these things,
[1:55:06] but Lord, it's not us. Lord, it's what
[1:55:08] you said about us. It's what Paul said
[1:55:10] about us, Lord. And we're not preaching
[1:55:12] these things because William Brandham
[1:55:13] came. We're preaching them because Paul
[1:55:15] came. And William Brham by the spirit
[1:55:18] pointed us back to Paul's full message,
[1:55:20] Lord God. Lord. So, we're not just
[1:55:22] preaching a prophet's message from
[1:55:24] today, but we're preaching the eternal
[1:55:26] word of Jesus Christ, the gospel of
[1:55:28] Jesus Christ, Lord, with power to change
[1:55:30] us, to make us into little Jesus Christ.
[1:55:33] It's a bride, Lord, that's wrapped in
[1:55:35] your word. Lord, we are so thankful for
[1:55:38] what we've got today. Lord, I pray you
[1:55:40] help us not to, Lord, just disdain it or
[1:55:43] or or to in any way minimize it, Lord.
[1:55:46] But, Lord, that we take full stock of
[1:55:48] what you've given us, Lord. that you've
[1:55:50] given us a rapturing message. Lord,
[1:55:52] you've given us a rapturing spirit.
[1:55:55] Lord, we've just got to surrender to it.
[1:55:58] Lord, I pray you lift our eyes higher,
[1:56:00] Lord. That when Satan comes in like a
[1:56:02] flood, when Satan throws these
[1:56:03] temptations our ways, Lord, that we
[1:56:05] would say, "Not today.
[1:56:07] My eyes are set a little higher. I'm
[1:56:09] headed to a higher plane, I'm living in
[1:56:11] a different place now." Lord, I pray you
[1:56:13] give us strength to resist. Lord, your
[1:56:16] word says if we resist the devil, he'll
[1:56:17] flee. Lord, I pray you give us strength
[1:56:20] and courage to resist day by day. Lord,
[1:56:22] to keep our eyes set on you, Lord, grant
[1:56:25] us grace. We pray, remembering these
[1:56:26] many prayer requests, Lord, for the Wiff
[1:56:29] family in Victoria, Lord, little Jack
[1:56:30] going in for surgery tomorrow. Lord,
[1:56:33] those that are traveling, Lord, praying
[1:56:34] your mercy and grace to them, each one,
[1:56:36] Lord, we take our camp, Lord. You know
[1:56:38] our heart's desire. We put so much time
[1:56:40] and effort into it, Lord. Brother Paul
[1:56:42] and Sister Kimberly in particular, but
[1:56:44] Lord, we commit it into your hands. You
[1:56:46] do all things well, Lord. We're asking
[1:56:48] for your grace, Lord, that regardless,
[1:56:49] we'd have a wonderful fellowship in your
[1:56:51] presence, Lord, and under the hearing of
[1:56:53] your word, Lord. Grant it now. We pray
[1:56:55] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:57:02] Make me more like thee. 98.
[1:57:08] Make
[1:57:10] me more
[1:57:13] like thee,
[1:57:16] Jesus.
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:19] Make
[1:57:21] me more
[1:57:24] like thee.
[1:57:30] Oh, give me a heart
[1:57:35] that's filled
[1:57:37] with love
[1:57:40] and make
[1:57:43] me more
[1:57:45] like thee
[1:57:51] and show
[1:57:53] me Calary.
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:58:00] Jesus
[1:58:03] show
[1:58:04] me calary.
[1:58:14] Open my eyes
[1:58:18] and mold
[1:58:20] my heart
[1:58:23] and show
[1:58:26] me calary.
[1:58:34] Oh, make
[1:58:36] me more
[1:58:39] like thee,
[1:58:43] Jesus.
[1:58:46] Make
[1:58:47] me more
[1:58:50] like thee.
[1:58:56] Just give me a heart
[1:59:01] that's filled
[1:59:03] with love
[1:59:06] and make
[1:59:09] me more
[1:59:11] like thee.
[1:59:17] Show

[2:08:41] for your presence, Lord God, that was
[2:08:43] felt
[2:08:46] on the hotterance of your word, oh God,
[2:08:48] that you have sent,
[2:08:51] Lord God, we're grateful for the grace
[2:08:53] that you have given us in this end time,
[2:08:55] Lord.
[2:08:57] [Music]
[2:08:58] Lord God, we know this morning, Lord
[2:09:00] God, that
[2:09:02] as we are being identified by the
[2:09:05] scripture,
[2:09:07] the word, Lord God, in our hearts
[2:09:11] inflaming us, Lord God, and we're
[2:09:14] feeling
[2:09:16] a touch, Lord, a call resonating from
[2:09:20] our soul,
[2:09:22] a reality that has been formed by the
[2:09:25] scriptures,
[2:09:27] something inside, Lord, telling us of
[2:09:29] our position in you, Lord.
[2:09:33] An affirming, Lord God, of what you have
[2:09:36] spoken, Lord.
[2:09:39] Lord, it makes us so humble, Lord God,
[2:09:42] to know
[2:09:44] that a sinner such as high, Lord,
[2:09:48] oh God, and it make us want to just love
[2:09:50] you more, oh God.
[2:09:54] Because Lord on one side there's so many
[2:09:56] weakness and failure. There's so many
[2:09:58] besetting. There's so many things that
[2:10:01] are there oh God. But
[2:10:04] constantly whispering say we're not
[2:10:05] worthy and surely we are not worthy of
[2:10:07] this blessing Lord.
[2:10:10] But Lord God, but because Lord of your
[2:10:13] grace this morning, we accept your word
[2:10:16] and we believe it Lord God with all our
[2:10:18] hearts Lord and Lord God and we accept
[2:10:22] it oh God upon the base of faith
[2:10:24] believing Lord God that every word that
[2:10:27] you have declared that it is thus said
[2:10:30] the Lord and it is the truth Lord
[2:10:33] and so God as we come in your presence
[2:10:36] Lord God we come with humble hearts
[2:10:38] We ask for this grace Lord God that will
[2:10:41] amount and it will unfold us Lord God to
[2:10:44] the position to which we are called
[2:10:47] Lord and all that stands Lord God Lord
[2:10:50] as an obstacle before us whether there
[2:10:53] be sickness Lord whether they oh God the
[2:10:56] weaknesses Lord God because there are so
[2:10:58] many things oh God that are in our lives
[2:11:01] Lord God that will take us away oh God
[2:11:04] from this objective for the the promises
[2:11:07] Lord God
[2:11:08] But this morning, God, we ask, Lord God,
[2:11:10] that you will help us, Lord God, to rise
[2:11:13] above these things, Lord.
[2:11:15] Lord God, and that you will bless us,
[2:11:17] Lord God. Lord God, for those Lord God,
