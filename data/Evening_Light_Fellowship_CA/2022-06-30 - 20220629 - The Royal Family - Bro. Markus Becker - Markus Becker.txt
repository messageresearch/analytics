conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and whereby nature the children of wrath even as others but by the grace of god we have been changed we have been resurrected and says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us thank god even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ oh lord thank god that we're not we're going to not will identify with jesus and his resurrection we have identified with jesus and the resurrection amen praise the lord we were dead in sins but he's

becker comes with the word amen portions of the scripture in the book of hebrews chapter 2 verse 11 and i would like to title the subject for this evening the royal family and the the the verse that i'm reading i would like to take to believe what the bible says it seems to be a little bit spectacular for us it's thank you very much to the musicians god bless you brothers and sisters let us read two portions of the scripture in the book of hebrews chapter 2 verse 11 and i would like to title the subject for this evening the royal family and the the the verse that i'm reading i would like to take to believe what the bible says it it seems to be a little bit spectacular for us it's not ecclesiastical thinking but this is what the bible says you know chapter 2 verse 11 for both i'm speaking about you and me he that sanctifiers that's christ and they who are sanctified that's us are all of one having the same father coming from the same source for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers that means a lot that means a lot and let us read in the book of esther esther chapter 2 uh chapter 2 verse 5. and by my accent you understand that you have to take what i want to say not what i'm saying okay verse 5. now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimay the son of kish a benjamite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the cap captivity which have been carried away with joconia king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither neither father nor mother and the mate was fair and beautiful who mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated now i'm very very thankful to be here and i think brother paul my good friend my great example to grant me to speak to you my name is marcus becker i come from germany my pastor is pastor his brother rodeowald he sends his greetings to all of you especially to our most noble brother i'm here right in the u.s for some days for two weeks and yeah i had a reason to come by i told brother paul we knew us for many many years and we lost a little bit track and if i could say a great compliment i remember that him to be a good preacher i was his interpreter blessed services but preaching is a gift but character is something different you know so i remember when we were watching a little bit what's going on at bcf you know when our brother jeff resigned and there was some kind like a vacuum and um brother brother paul entered into preach there and i was impressed i was very very impressed you know not many people will do this you know to step into something there where you can lose nothing where you can gain nothing but lose everything because people surely will misunderstand that you know and i would say that that that that impressed me and uh i always said when whenever i would meet him i would let him know that that changed that that formed my life in a certain way you know to have that kind of a character and i was really blessed but i'm i'm really honored to say this to be part of the family look if if somebody is young and he's new he makes a lot of mistakes we have to live buddy but he needs somebody who's standing in the gap because we have a message mentality whenever when somebody makes a big mistakes we try to to to be distant you take it to to let me say to not to unquestion but then put him out of a brotherhood i always call it the message cold war you know the cold war then we have our democrat you know we have the east and the west and we ignore and we isolate and we put in the circle and we put out of the circle and this is not a very much of a mature attitude young people need they need somebody standing in the gap taking the shame because because and and that i've seen this in brother paul and i thought really brother paul that that how you could say that um it it blessed my life and it it changed my vision a couple of weeks ago i was in peru and there was a church big split because the pastor passed away and a lot of hard feelings and things people say foolish things out of wrong emotions yeah and i'm i'm happy that many things that we said over all these years are under the blood because it was not always the holy spirit speaking to us sometimes it was our frustration speaking to us and and if everybody takes let me say it takes these things let me say serious and makes a story and he said and he said i mean we are right but the question today is not is uh who is right the question is we have people we have young people they are watching us we have families we have children they they want to see the character behind our preaching so when i went there i knew and and they asked several ministers and they refused to go because this is a situation where you can only lose you know but i told them i said i will come because i have nothing to lose anyhow so so i was and i when i went there i had to think twice but i thought about brother paul i said we have to do sometimes you have to stand in the gap if people understand or do not understand no matter we are brothers we are friends and so i could be over help and so god blessed influence that is what i was searching brother branham speaks about uziah and he said on the other side of eternity i will tell him you say you influenced my life exactly so and brother paul i want to say you influenced my life in a very good way so god bless our noble brother i'm a gallant man of god i mean absolutely so and so i'm very happy i always try to when i i always thought by myself if i see him next time i would let him know you know really god bless you so uh i know it's the one so let me go directly into the word of the lord i left all the greetings and all these things i'm really blessed the royal family and let me be myself okay i'm traveling a lot around so i learned how to respect people i learned how to respect cultures the more you the more older you get the more you learn to respect people their mentality their background sometimes when we first traveled we traveled as germans and germany is a many germs therefore you know there's a lot of problems you're in trouble already when you arrive but but we learnt really to understand cultures and let people stand the way they are we cannot germanize everybody yeah we want to dramatize them with the word of the lord but not germanize them man so so also i hope i can say i can start with a sentence not offending you but the message that we believe does not come from america it comes from the presence of our father amen amen it does not come from jefferson well no it is not brother branham's message brother brennan was the voice the voice and and what we listen is the voice behind the voice the message of the hour is not a doctrine the message of the hour is our father talking to us when we gave our heart to the lord our our attribute god laid laid part of himself into our lives and and it is written in psalm it was said he even laid eternity into our hearts there's only one who is eternal that's god himself so when we answer to the altar called it was not our brain our brain was not fast enough it was the attribute answering to that call so so so so and then brother brahm said this bible became a new bible it's not that we should that we should throw the bible away because the prophet said the bible is the book of the year he said it will always be the book of the year till the end so so but it is a new bible and we understand that's our story this is our book that's our identification and and here we have that little girl by the name of esther by the way i want to greet the family of brother paul the boys that i met over there in brother ron peterson have very good memories still so esther the the story starts with a king who had a had a wife who was not very much obedient and the king the princes around the king he gave him a principle he said look if your wife is not obedient to your command all of our wives will do whatever they want they understood that we are examples do we understand that we are an example for our children for the people they watch us they observe us and we have a young generation especially preachers kids they they can detect uh they can even see body languages they can detect tensions you try to to to to to to to smile and to smile things away but they can detect already some vibes so it's so important that that we for all problems that we have that we find solutions if not it is a powerless church they have just a doctrine or some pictures of brother branham but we need solutions to go on you know so so we see that that this little girl esther her life story starts with two names one is esther which means star the other one is hadassah some translations say bright other translations say mer and you have to understand that we have two names amen on one hand side you are just an american on the other hand side on the inner man you come from god brother royal family is a privilege nobody can preach you in and nobody can preach you out of this no sir amen therefore this message that we believe is not a cult and a cult uh as long as you're a good brother people come to you and say oh it's our brother from the before the foundation of the world and we were eager and somehow you left and from that moment and the same people would say okay he left us because he was never part of us so you come back and you repent oh our brother from eternity we know us already okay who who wants to believe this if somebody's a brother he's a brother he's even if he's in spiritual amnesia but if he's a brother he's a brother if somebody's an eagle he's an eagle sometimes he forgets what he is but he still is what he is amen therefore this message is not a cult amen and and and and you are just a simple man uh over there in the us i'm just a simple brother from from germany i tell you one thing i'm a very very sympathetic man if you only would knew me because i i i this is now marcus this is my vision brother bram speaks about the tent vision and people say where is the tent is it in costa rica is it in germany is it in the u.s i said maybe this is my own interpretation of it and you don't have to accept it but i believe the bride is the tent because because we live in a tent if this earthly tabernacle in that tabernacle is nothing else in a tent if this earthly tabernacle will be dissolved we have a building from god which is eternal and then paul continues in romans he said we're now living in a tent in a tabernacle remember the vision that that that moses who was the first one having a tint vision that was moses going up and when he came down he built up the tabernacle according the vision that he saw and this was brother brandon revealing that his body soul and spirits and brother ben even said the curtain between the only supporters in the and in that place is our self-will the the the temple in jerusalem is a shadow on a human being and we're living in it this is no marcus we live in it for 70 80 years and then we go to our real death in our true body therefore i said i'm a very very sympathetic man but i'm just living in a german tent for 70 80 years standing in my own way having my complexes having my genes having having my story having my childhood but in me there is something of god and in you exactly the same thing so so that question of our esther who comes into view she is she she she is a she is a she does not have a father and doesn't have a mother she is part of the jewish group taken away in captivity captivity so our great king has veros he is king over 127 countries now he wants to marry again and we are not preaching this evening about marriage in divorce no centimeter okay i wouldn't dare to do it behind another pulpit but we speak about a spiritual application nothing else okay please don't misinterpret it so he's searching now for a new wife a girl that he can marry and she is that woman is a nice girl but she has a special qualifications the bible makes it very sure she has no father and she has no mother now that reminds us to melchizedek amen we had no father and we had no mother remember he who sanctifies and he who's who is sanctified comes of one the same family so so let us see a little bit her background and i would ask uh the brothers and sisters to to to just i'm a german but when it comes to technique i get a little bit nervous can you just put some of this lights yeah and i will tell it in in some kind like a story because this is now the time of the roman empire we are in the fourth century and we have uh an eastern part in the western part uh this is now 300 around 320 after christ in the roman empire we have different caesars emperors now in human nature many if somebody is a human leader he cannot see somebody besides him okay so we cannot have two caesars uh we cannot have two emperors so on one day we have our most noble friend by the name of constantine who decided now go into war with the other caesar to find out if we are two is one too much okay this is tombstone this is billy the kid against against the daltons so this saloon only needs one okay this is human nature brother brahm said if you have a gift watch what you will do with the gift will you help your brothers or would you pull them down would you make a name for themselves for yourself like like nimrod or will you help your brothers to come into their position but human nature brother i tell you is is selfish nature i mean can you please go back again brother so we see that now war starts and uh what happens is god is in control because he wanted to propagate christianity over the roman empire at that time it is god's plan what happens is that right before the night or the day there's different legions about it we see that constantine he sees a light over the sun and a cross and he hears these noble words in hick in hawk signo vince's that means you will win with this sign so he believes in a god that he that he doesn't know and his group will have now a sign of a cross on their shields and he's fighting on the milivian bridge in rome against marcenzius and constantine wins the wins the battle and from now on constantine he is the leader over the whole roman empire that question is settled at the same time we have different opinions in the church great opinions because we have different schools of churches in the eastern part and in the western part the question is this is jesus created or is he part of god that is not a problem for them as long as there are two different emperors but now it becomes into one state and this question have to be solved in other that means let me read it like this one purpose of the that is wikipedia one purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements arising from within the church of alexandria over the nature of jesus in his relationship to the father in particular whether the son had been begotten by the father from his own being and therefore having no beginning or else created out of nothing or therefore having a beginning so we have two big schools and they are one against the other one is arias one is okay the question is clear constantine was an unbeliever he wants to make deals i mean tremendous something like this unbelievable okay i mean he wants to make deals and maxencious he's a loser he's a total disaster you know something like this so what happens he makes a deal because he understands the god that i don't know is very very strong because i saw the vision but i don't understand the doctrine so we now have to make this as a state religion but you cannot have a state religion if the religious leaders don't understand their own doctrine you understand so he brought them together on the council of nicaea to say look brother i'm not interested in the solution because i'm not believing anyhow but when we come out of this we have one doctrine okay it's true because he wanted to make a deal he now wants to make this god they call it christian christian cristianos christians but i cannot make it state religion when they don't know their own doctrine so first we come together you make you make a deal you make an agreement no matter what i believe everything because he was a believer and he wasn't a believer anyhow and they found out that they believed in jesus to be part of god not just somebody who was created like an angel but part of god this was the birth of the trinity idea now i will not go into it sir it's not my place on the wednesday because i'd like to like to tell a story about esther but brother brandon makes sure jesus was completely god and completely man that that's what he says but it is an important question they call it a question of being homo homo homo uzios of one substance so there is a big difference between something which is created and something which is burst now if i'm creating something i'm building something up but if i'm birthing something that means part of me is in this i created many things but i burst only one daughter and the difference between the things i created in the birth part of me is in my daughter my own genes she is not just created she's she's begotten part of me is in her that's the difference between a birth and just a membership it's a big difference once your birth part of god is in you blessed be the name of the lord so we see this and please make the next one it was an essential question of that time and brother branham says and that is what constantine and his successes did at nicaea and after nicaea they invented the people of god to the convention and when the church sat down and eat and rose up to play partaking of church from ceremonies pagan feasts named after christian rites she was trapped she had a committed fornication and god walked out brother maim said the true believers should not have gone there and he he parallels it with with with the more bites they said we are all one but brother we are not all one we are not all one we are this message was not based on william branham this message was based on the pillar of fire that's a difference okay so we see it was a very important question and now the question is now where's the bride in it and let's have let's see it brother for the next one okay so here's what brother brahma said so he first was god jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get us let's see come out of space there was nothing let's make a little white light like a mystic light like a halo and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was god and then out of god came the logos a part of god that went out of god you remember that brother abraham said the first thing that i see is uh a little white light and he calls it like a child playing in the in in the garden but then brother brahma said this and i was puzzled over it he said the first thing that god created was angels another quote how to bring it together sure he created angels creation but that logos was not created it came out of him do you understand that we don't have two gods it's one person amen because that logos came out of him it was not created like the angels it was part of him now we learned through the message of the hour and here you see the royal family and remember this is what just one service please know there's much more to say and i don't know if i have all the balance in it but it's not a question for this evening but brother braham taught us the bride was in christ even on calvary as eve was in adam in what form ever but she's part of him we were reading it in in in in hebrew but if the bride was in christ and christ was melchizedek before then the bride must have been in him or too i don't speak about the church the bride i mean piled eve part of adam they call it the family of god so if the bride was in melchizedek i mean in some form in his thoughts whatever be sure she must have been in the logos because mckenzie came out of that logos amen so if she was in that logos she must have been on god nobody can preach you into it therefore brother brahman said if you have eternal life you always hear it but there will be people that will get eternal life that's true they will be safe not even at the white stone judgment but here we speak about a family a royal family that's different i'm a royal family so so in whatever form i cannot tell you but here is a picture amen next one please here's what brother brahm said the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you will see many things god is unchangeable both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he is god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge that he's not omniscient the best way we could say is that sometimes he will be but this is not spirit scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's god and now now you're coming in does the thoughts of god are eternal they are real and here's the difference between our thoughts our thoughts we think about things but he thought is substance they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of gods so when we say we were in the mind of god it was not just god was just thinking about us we were part of him part of his being blessed be i don't know who else was in that thought but we're just speaking about the bride you understand esther she had no father and she had no mother hallelujah bless blessed be the long so one thing is sure and i i'm always like to make that little demonstration that that brother beckett was making with some years ago this is just a demonstration it's not a doctrine just a demonstration to make things tangible now god before the foundation he made a picture of his family and here we were i mean therefore we are not arrogant but we are proud of our father we are proud who we are not arrogant but proud who we are amen so god took our souls and throwed it in seven church ages on seven countries some in america some in germany some in luther's time some in wesley some impulse some some in our time and god knows one thing my sheep will hear my voice i will i place the receiver in their hearts amen and god knows one thing when time is over the whole the family will be back together and brother branham explains it brother blame said this and the prophet was the first one who said in the time in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god not mysteries scofield already revealed mysteries but they were big mysteries the mystery brother brain was the first man ever on this earth who said without you god is not complete anymore amen yet we were in his mind we could not have fellowship we should have been expressed but we were already part of him as my daughter was always in me he was not created she needed her time to be expressed so we wanted to come directly in our in our theophany amen and we landed in ohio and we came into families god never asked us do you want to be bro do you want to be male or female you want to be american or german i mean god never asked us do you want to be black or white sometimes we came into families that we were not choosing um i came from a family which was divorced and i hated myself in that situation but god there's a quote that brother blame said he said god planned our birth for many generations god did not only knew that we were that will come he planned our coming so in second world war all these hitler boys could not kill your father or your grandfather because you must have been expressed so you could just send them right into this secret line all these hitler boys come but god had to protect your father because he knew you had to come blessed be the name of the lord and if god planned my birth surely god planned my death therefore he came to marilyn monroe and said there's a young girl she will dying at this in this minute god knows the minute when we will die when we are born god knows already this is the end of his life what what a thing how we are in the hands of the lord can you say amen that's very special nobody can preach you into the family and nobody can preach you out when we were younger we would like to bring we give people if we have problems with people we like to to to give them over to satan because we did not have any remedy we didn't have a solution so it was easy to just unchristianize him it was the most easy way for unmatured people to to just say this is not a real brother so because today we learned we have to give them into god's hands he said heavenly father my my brother is as long as wrong as he can be but i believe it's my brother so so you had a lot of patience with me lord have patience with my brother amen can you say amen so so when i in in south america suddenly they are varied they are much more much more of guerrero fighters so one comes to the other and he says now now i will send you over to hell i said if he comes next time you say you cannot send me to hell because you didn't pay my price i mean you didn't pay my price you will send me nowhere i'm i have a father can you say amen next one please i mean i mean so therefore we we came on this earth and we came into a body that we didn't like i mean when we were teenagers we hated ourselves amen you remember the freckles i still remember that the preaching about the freckles i hated my freckles i see now my daughter hates the freckles i learned from you brother paul i tell you honey you will get a husband who loves your freckles one day exactly so but we hated us i mean do you know one thing brother most of our problems we're staying in our own way and and brother brahm himself he says i'm a melancholic and and even in the message uh on the wings of a snow white dove i mean that is 1965 he said all my life i was a neurotic so we thought as pentecostals the holy ghost come and everything is so it's not is not because we still have owner our human nature but we have enough grace and enough power to bring that human nature under his control but it's there it's there brother bram said i'm a nor and here is 1963 he brother brain received the holy ghost it was not a question of the new birth that that is where we outmade our mistakes we we we come in the flesh and then we ask ourselves if we are born again so another prayer line another prayer line another laying on our hands i said brother you can go so much in prayer lines that at the end you don't know if you are saved or not more prayer lines and more doubts come amen you have to make a star but from there you have to grow and you have to understand you have still that nature it's a process a person says yeah there's prayer and i was great i'm i i do prayers myself that's fine but the main thing is is is a process people sometimes think a minister comes like santa claus and and preaches things it cannot be because growth comes by god show me the prayer line for rapturing faith it will not be rapturing phrases in the word so if this answers in the word all my answers are in the word if young people need a prayer line let's go on but don't make it make a tradition of if if i wasn't at the altar it wasn't spiritual no take take your blessing wherever you are let's blessed be the name on hearer of the prophet look look look and he comes in the flesh and he says i build up a complex because he listened to people brother has two things for ministers that is difficult and if the younger you are the more you are affected to it the first thing is eat perpetual critics because this discourages you but the other thing is perpetual applause we need a balance in both things we need it but we need the critics and we need the applause but everything which is out of balance brings us out of balance can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so so here he comes he listens to to these voices now i always tell the young people i said you are wednesday for example and we don't feel well we have a little cuff like and then we hear a voice no today you cannot go to church no no no but you you will bring a pandemia over the whole church no you have to sleep have you ever heard that voice you can say amen so in other words that voice speaks german and english because i hear it in german you hear it in english and and i always say this if satan tells you not to come to church you tell him no you stay at home [Applause] amen you say no you stay at home blessed be blessed be the name of the lord but we come into the flesh and once you meant to come into the flesh don't doubt your salvation don't don't doubt your family but come back and know the potential lays in me and let god again touch that eternal pardon you and you're coming back on track so whenever god came and and the prophet had his wings moved it's a swing moves okay he was a melancholic so god always brought him up on a higher level amen amen here he comes in another dimension will it help you to see the other dimension yes amen here he has again he is down and somebody comes in clifton cafeterias he said because thou has chosen brother brahman said i'm i'm never the same woman in brandon again and two years later he preaches the present stage of my ministry he's completely depressed that's how we go sometimes we forget who we are and then god comes and reminds us who we are brother i'm i'm dealing some time with people with with some kind like like like hell mental health issues and and it will occur more and more in our church because this is a very difficult time to live and one of the sisters she gave me a great compliment she said brother marcus one thing is so my psyche is not my faith my faith is here my psyche is here if you're a menopause your psyche is upside down but your faith always holds you don't feel it but god doesn't go after feeling god goes after his his eternal plan can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so so so so so god says to brother ben look to the right this is your life i ask you the question when did these mountains appear 1963 when god created the earth he made already that ridge of mountains knowing that in millions of years i have a seventh angel he will be a melancholic so we are he he was already portraying his life right when he created the earth don't you think that god knows about everything about us and we we start in our prayer line um heavenly father you know and you know and god says i know i'm in you know you know you know my life and you know and god says i know amen so so so he was building up he was showing the end from the beginning i always say this now the voice says to brother branham this is your life and i want to tell to you this is your life so brother if you are on the mountaintop don't become arrogant oh if i see this family and their children i i they should only believe they should only believe and god says okay i will bring the same thing to you and then if you're on the mountaintop never forget that the next valley will come there's no reason to be arrogant because we are not having now a good time but one thing is sure if you're in the valley don't give up if in the valley never give up because one thing is sure the next mountaintop comes [Applause] can you say amen but it doesn't come by nice bible slogans it comes by an understanding from where we come from we come from the mind of god and nobody will stop us even we will not stop ourselves we will pay for our nonsense but it will not throw us out of the family of god i talk about the bride okay this would be the name of the lord can you say amen so so therefore the the voice says to brother abraham here god understands people god understands human being and i i repeated what i'm doing from time to time a young boy he wanted to to buy some dogs okay and he goes and he sees one handicapped dog and the owner of the dogs he comes down the staircase and he says why do you want to have that dog i mean he's handicapped he cannot walk like the rest he cannot and the boy is putting up his trousers and from his knee down he has a protease an artificial leg and the boy says this i want to have this dog because when we go out i understand him and he understands me and brother brandon quote brother branham god became man to understand man quote brother branham but god became teenager to understand teenagers that's our father so when you pray even you you you pray about immoral thoughts god knows what you talk about it i mean he understands that we are human beings can you say amen that makes our message so sympathetic that makes the gospel the good news that brings relationship this message is not a doctrine this message is a relationship to our father because we come from the same family but we did not know who we were until we heard a voice we came to the lord and we were just uh somebody brought us under conviction and you're this and you're this and you listen christ died for me yes and we have to start like this but you cannot live your whole christian life under convictions once you must find out i'm a son of god i was trapped into the things of this world but the judge is my attorney can you say amen and brother i tell you this if somebody believes this from all his heart he will not become a worldly person no he will not he will do everything to serve the lord because he understands who he is blessed be the name of the lord make the next one amen this is the last one before yes this is the nice again therefore i i showed you in the bible in in the message of the hour we do not live by slogans have you ever heard when the young people that come out brother marcus we want a convention i tell you brother that was deep and we never heard it that way i always say yeah yeah you never heard it that way because the prophet never said it that way therefore you never heard it that way okay that was that was how do you say tremendous it was unbelievable fine then i said to the young person what did you get what did you understand nothing nothing okay if nothing i mean what is tremendous about nothing amen then then i say to him total disaster amen because you must we are not here to impress people we are here to help people to find their position in christ to find a relationship i don't understand all the doctrine of william brennan but i have a father what is your doctrine i have a father he called me his own long before even time began do we believe that my life was in his hands so you see by the point you're not the only one who can sing so look this is a picture of of this is an unbeliever this is just uh how you call it uh a filmer of of animals i think it's on youtube or whatever but a boy gave it to me this is an eagle and a crow national geographic some of these film of national geographic so the the eagle uh he had a crow sitting on his back and that crow was attacking the eagle right on the neck and this is the report of the unbeliever he knows nothing about the message and eagles and so forth and he said this the eagle when he recognized there's an enemy right on his back he did nothing and the crow was just picking on the head but at a certain moment the eagle just started to rise goes up and up and up and up and the eagle knows one thing hey friend you better go or you explode you see he does he does not fight the enemy he just goes up in another dimension they say amen and he said okay sports friends okay you can try but uh are you still there [Applause] brother we have something this message gives us a vision this message is not law and order this message comes from our father this message shows who we are really this message makes makes us to stand up harley i always love that picture sometimes sometimes we are boxers and we and we get it and then and then you can one two three four five and we're just six seven eight nine ten and we're coming back brother to fall is human to stand up as godly you will find out if you're a family of god there's something in you that stands up it is not your capacity is god in you standing up blessed be the name of the lord once you find out who you are you can have patience with others you can even have patience with unbelievers because you say if god doesn't reveal what can the person do about that we understand we live by god's grace and we understand even growth is god's grace so we can we understand we have to have patience with the family of god because god has much patience with us we're not judgmental anymore it's not that we don't call sin sin that's fine but but we are not judgment about brothers sisters we just say lord have a way for them so that is the background for our sister esther thank you very much for the technicians so what happens is this and i'm finishing by that by the little drama so we cannot read the bible in a western in a western understanding but this king he was inviting all these girls for one night into his room what happened was clear they played card okay exactly so so this was for the for the for the for the teenagers and 40 okay right so when the night was over of playing memory he was just sending the girl away and he was just asking her if he wants to play memory again so he had a full a full house of girls and esther she was made ready and she came under the care of a great servant it is always a main servant introducing the bride to the bridegroom remember the story of ruth and boaz came who is that girl it was the servant explaining who the girl is remember eliezer presenting the bride to isaac it's always it's always a servant presenting the bridegroom to the right and she came under the care of the main servant and she asked nothing now one thing it was clear all these girls knew one thing that king he will marry one of us our girls one of us girls so they tried to make a individual feature special earrings special deals special so that the king will remind them so that they might become the right but esther did not ask for nothing only what hey guy told her now esther was a wise girl because she understood one thing if somebody knows the taste of the king then it's higa and we have to understand that brother there was nobody living as close to the king as our prophet and you say amen none of the prophets could live could see as as far as william branham moses could just see in the beginning john could say in the beginning was but this prophet brought us before the beginning a little white light comes out of him blessed be the name of the lord that means he he knew higa knew the taste amen i mean and brother branham knew the taste of christ for our age so it's good to take him as an example and whatever you honor god by many things i remember i know this is wednesday but just just let me let me let me but by many things we honor god so many things how brother branham handled things especially in the church look how he went when he goes to hunt look how he goes to church it wasn't it was a reflection of he felt that would that would be pleasing unto god so i can take him as an example without idolizing the men but what happened is that she was under his care and the bible says this esther was taken unto king ahaz into his royal in the tenth months which is the month tibet in the seventh year of the reign so esther came into the palace of the king on the tenth month of the seventh year here we have our prophet amen remember remember one thing there were three magicians or three astronomers and they saw the star and they were just following the star and that star led them to the king so the three astronomers didn't say oh this tremendous three stars in one line let's make a picture like let's make a doctrine of three stars in one line and we are the leaders of that new movement the three-star lion movement exactly we become the high priest of that whole that that star led them to a person to the king and and and they and they had every evening they had search service that's marcus okay they had family altar and they had a they had they were preaching to one another but they had nothing to say the only thing that they were preaching was we have seen the star be the name of the lord they had no doctrine but they have seen the star and look and we have seen the star the seventh star we have seen the star but this star did not lead us to branham tabernacle but led us to the king to the person can you say amen he did not lead us to himself it led us to the king therefore i'm in sunset mountain brother brahma said the son is the king of all lights he says shalom good morning church the night is over shalom who appeared the king the light blessed be the name of the lord so we are not branhamites we're not brandonites no but we are christians but we understand the bible so what happened is this is on the 10th months of the seventh year she now came to the was presented to the king amen so all these girls wanted to impress the king by something outstanding i just give this as an example because i'm lacking i like singing though brother brahm said only those who are gifted should sing so i find my i i found my limitation about it as an example a person say uh i i'm impressing god because i can sing then you see jimmy swaggart jesus [Music] sing it again brothers and it's wonderful if you can sing but god has angels who can sing better than us somebody says i'm you know i know the message and i have a lot of wisdom that's wonderful but god is the source of all wisdom who wants to impress god amen we only impress him in this loudly seen age with humble hearts serving the lord and if we sing or preach or whatever we do it for the glory of god amen but we cannot impress god with our human abilities we cannot mix them together but doing everything for its purpose and now here comes that little little little girl and brother brian said this she was not adorned with nothing because they thought the king is just looking for female attraction you understand what i want to say but she knew that king has character and brother raymond said this the story of esther jesus never mentioned it in the bible paul never mentions the story of esther martin luther said we should throw the book of esther into the river he he really thought it's not part of the bible and martin luther was asked the question why is the book of esther not mention the bible or why does it belong to the bible he said first it's to jewish second is a feminist book third the name of jehovah is not even mentioned in the whole book of esther so it has no place but here comes the seventh angel taking that whole story for after 2000 years and preaches the marriage of the lamb [Applause] making sense to the story of esther because we are that esther and then brother brahm said this he said when esther came into the presence of that king he said she was just adorned with the holy spirit with the holy spirit not with knowledge about the seventh seal this is part of the holy spirit very important part but that's not all because you can have a very nice understanding and an arrogant spirit you can have a very modest appeal but a very bad character behind the moorish appeal a person said we are better than others because you know and we have longer discipline the muslims have longer hair than us that's not what is imp that's part of the gospel but that's not the center of the whole thing the center is a heart it's a character it's a love blessed be the name so when he came remember that king was king of 127 countries esther had nothing to bring she was just a girl without father and her mother but when she came in and and brother brandon makes the drama he said when she came in the king was so impressed the only adoration that she had our or jewelry let me call it like this was the holy spirit and the king directly found out this girl is not a barbie this is not barbie i always tell the sisters if you want to make up yourself as barbie you get you get ken as husband if you want to have ken as harvard go but if you want to have somebody with value i mean be a woman of value and the bible says god puts together blessed be don't make yourself cheap please not don't make yourself be know who you are i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god may i'm at home i'm just a janitor so while i'm preaching i'm looking if all the lights are fine the fire extinguishers everything is because it's part of my job but in me i'm a son of god no it means different this is just a tent in which i'm living but one day i would step out of it and go into my theophany and you do exactly the same so the king was so impressed amen we are not going into all these details but what happens is this when haman when haman was rised up remember haman and esther i know i've omitting all these things because i know the story is well known but haman and esther were both on the one roof and they were both blessed under king ahasberos and brother branham explains in the church book there is the two wines and they grow together and god lets to grow both god blesses both but the moments that haman tries to touch esther then the king comes on the planet so so so here we have the plan esther becomes an intercessor i don't mean brother bram didn't save anyone they're all safe by calvary i asked a brother i said brother uh we believe we believe the bride is the final voice for the final age all these things we believe all this but i said that somebody goes into federal prison he never was in the message he wasn't never was in a christian church so he reads the bible and is so impressed and he gives his heart to the lord he never read the message he doesn't know brother bran no it doesn't is he saved or not i said surely he saved on what basis on calvary on calvary if not we end up in a sect in a cult you have to have so much message to be saved i mean if you if you start by this you are back in the mormon church god help us okay so so so so we are intercessors but not in that thing as that as as if we we can make a connection to god but we help we go for our brother we go for our sister we are in the plan of god have you ever thought about this he was in a finish nearly i mean but i have i have no no notes i'm just saying why don't we from from from wikipedia but you see have i thought about this here is jesus coming to mary and martha and martha she was running to jesus and said if you would have been here lazarus would not even would not have beaten or died okay so she knows she stops mourning because he knows jesus is here at the same time maria was still mourning because she doesn't know that jesus is here so martha goes to maria and says the master calls you that's the story now who makes the calling jesus but who is the voice martyr you understand jesus calls today but who is his voice who are his hands who are his feet you it's the voice of god you are the voice of god amen amen blessed be the name of the lord therefore every father is the head of his own home every pastor is the head of his church every messenger is the head of a church age and christ is the head of all seven messengers therefore there will be another people who will be the final voice for the final age under their messenger yes that's what it is not with their own message under their messenger so what happens i mean i mean heyman wants to kill the jews and here's the plan she becomes an intercessor she's now before the throne and and and and she she is timely there that's what mordecai says now is is not right the right time that you came into this position and remember your life is a blessing to somebody who brother paul and we cannot reach you have a ministry your life is the ministry sometimes i think i see many things but brother brahm said you mothers you are the fifth gospel it's an honor to take care of the children you don't have to go in another country to say i'm a missionary you are a missionary in your own home and god honors this blessed be the name of the lord and you see hey he she invites haman next time the king is still in love it's not just sexual love no he loves that character you can reach the story of the of esther the king doesn't even touch the girl because she said the king didn't touch me for 30 days she was not she was not barbie this was different this was different i mean for him she had a lot of value okay so she invites him for the first time and the king leaves the throne and comes into the house of in the female palace and the king says half of my kingdom will be for you esther amen and esther says if you would come tomorrow again and i wondered myself i said esther why didn't you now react it's not possible now here's the situation hang him up and it's time to do something with haman but god doesn't make mistakes god doesn't because the next day he came again the king was human and the bible said in the night the king couldn't sleep in that night the king couldn't sleep and the book was brought unto him and the book was opened do you see between the first and the coming second coming of christ there's a book to be opened and here are the names right in and our names are right in it brother and said what a happy day for john when these seals were open and he saw himself or saw his name however you want to bring it and he said there is john i saw my name right in the book blessed be the name of the lord and the king was so thrilled about the jews and about mother cry so when esther said i mean marduk i want a haman wants to kill us the king was a hundred percent that was nitro and glitzerine coming together god doesn't make mistakes can you say amen so the family of god brother and sister this message that we believe is red bull this red bull if you need energy for your life this message is red bull it's different it's more than just i go to church i mean this message is our father talking to us you find yourself hey i'm ruth you find yourself i'm esther that's me that was my story do you do you see how esther from a little girl from a hillbilly a hillbilly girl now came into the position of a queen do you understand that god is not bringing us now always to a new birth that's fine for youngsters but god is now molding us to take over the throne so god sends problems and things and and he wants to see our reaction we ask for an easy life god calls for troubles because he says i want that character to be built in you can you see amen god brings problems even problematic brothers we want to shoot them on the moon god says i sent them again because he wants us to grow with all these problems because one day that's rapture will we don't believe in the rapture in in some kind of a uh denominational way the rapture will be just one step for us we are already in the brotherhood called it raptured condition this is already the preparation for everything we're in the cycle already can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord amen do you love the lord i mean what a father we have if the musician said fine if the musicians would come brother paul he said okay i mean if they would call and come and let me finish buddhis i may put everything aside hallelujah i mean what a father we have brother for me to preach the message is a great honor to live the message is a great honor to be part of that movement i'm not ashamed of my father we know in the framework of this message there's a lot of childish things we know this there's a lot of scandals there's nothing wrong about it look the first exodus and you will see the parallel and the third but you have to see the core of that whole thing i mean maybe you have the song i have a father a man and would be singing because this is brother mark is what is what is your doctrine amen as for me and my house we serve the lord that is my doctrine there was a brother between esther and that king there was a true love love is not a feeling love is more than butterflies love is his substance if brothers love one another you cannot let let him go you cannot you cannot make cold war and says okay let him do no there's something in you like you know and then say income do are you responsible for your brother and you say yes i'm responsible for my brother and for my sister i am amen because i'm not cain who told god uh my brother my husband brother no no we're family do you agree with everything no i don't agree no not at all but my brother is my brother if he wants to list me that's fine if not i come back [Music] that's the way how god was dealing with us brother brandon one time and the finishing buddies really finishing [Music] he speaks about the gallant man of david i honestly say i don't say it because i'm here i believe our brother paul is one of these gallant soldiers gallant man and brother brain preaches in the message um there's a man who can turn on the light he speaks about this mighty man about david gallant man man of valor character man of caliber the prophet said the woman of sraptor had the same caliber like the prophet elijah that's what he says the same caliber that's family of god brother branham was our brother sometimes he would say branham said and brandon said he said hey that's my brother this is my brother i have another ministry but it's my brother it's part of my family therefore we cried all when we were reading his life story germans never cry only in football only in soccer germans only cry in soccer but when we were reading the story of brother we were crying because it was our story that was closer to our family story than our family story in the flesh and and these people there's so much love david love is is mortar love is is is substance between people i mean love is more than just okay let him go and david just said i would like to have a drink from the well injured in bethlehem and here's what brother blame said he said these men i mean they were fighters [Music] they were real fighters but when it comes to david they love the man so much brother brahm said this the least of his com least of his wishes were command for these men david didn't say you you you go i'm the king here you no no he just felt and these men said let's do it for our brother and for 14 miles two took the sword and one took the bucket at them [Music] amen and they came back and david was so touched by this amen and he poured it out to god he said i will not drink this this man this is the blood of this man you see how the water becomes blood even in the gospel i mean the bloody word becomes the word for the age amen this is the blood of this man and brother blame said this and you have to find out that is you brother blame said these men had a revelation that david will become king one day you are not interested what the world says about this message you know what it is [Music] amen and when david became king he remembered these mighty men and they came into their positions some over cities and some other countries brother when our king will be crowned we come into our positions who we really are rather it matters to serve the lord sister it matters to serve the lord blessed be the name of the lord what a family we are nobody preaches you in nobody can preach you out god made the choosing
