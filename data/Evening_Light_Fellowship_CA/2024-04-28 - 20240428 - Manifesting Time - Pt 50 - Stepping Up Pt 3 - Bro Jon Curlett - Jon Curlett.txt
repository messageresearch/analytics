Simplicity as well Lord Lord we're just a little humble group just a few here a few there but Lord we're praying that we'll Rise Up On Wings of Faith Lord not just in this service Not Just In This Moment Lord by by day by day Lord that we would live our lives by Faith Lord that's the Walk of the Believers when we can take your word Lord we can put it in our mind we can put it on our lips Lord we can live it we can breathe it Lord it would produce itself through our very lives Lord and it's by Faith Lord It's your faith it's the Faith of Christ Lord that lives within us Lord we're so thankful this morning Lord for a call in our hearts Lord for a desire Lord that brings us to this place to hear your word Lord that seeks after you Lord we're thankful for a spirit that causes us to call on our father Lord a spirit that's not fear but of love and of a sound mind Lord you're so good to us Lord you're so good to [Music] us Lord just speak now this morning Lord encourage us with this simple message Lord may we lay hold of what it is to live a life before you Lord that others could see you in our lives or grant us Grace now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless you this morning turn if you would to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to have brother Bob and sister Brenda back with us from their time away a time of hopefully rest and relaxation amen and then brother Joe back with us as well it's good to see him brother Emanuel I see you sitting back there God bless you this morning brother it's good to see you amen I know it's not always we can make it amen God is good amen amen God is good 1 Corinthians 15 verse 57 Paul says but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ if you if you have a skull field Bible it as it switches to verse 58 it says it's the ultimate Victory here it says a motive to service he says therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our series on manifesting time and I want to take a third service on this title of stepping up and we spoke last service and we really focused on the sisters how that God had placed them in their roles and he'd specifically built them and fashioned them and put them together in a way that was best for their family for their husband and for their children and we saw great power in that we saw that with Hannah we saw it with Tabitha and these different ones and you know even as you could hear my prayer this morning I don't ever want us to miss the Simplicity of that humble Victorious Christian walk amen it is so often is we talked about this last service how we've got to let God be God and let you be you and trust that as he's made you he's working in you with the way that we are amen and we're not trying to raise ourselves up to be something amen but the great trial is the great test is not to let sat us beat us down from what we are either but to stay right in the middle of the road and and to stay right where God places Us in that thing that he's called us to to be faithful to that amen it's not to to to be here to to make money or to make a name for ourselves but it's to be in his timing in his season in his will and in his purpose and if we can wake up every morning and do that then we're going to find ourselves living a life that's overcoming amen amen that perfect walk of the Believers to walk as he's in the in the light amen where he shows us what he wants us to do that's where we want to be and I I just want to open with this little short quote here that brother brandham says he says men who walk with God don't care where they're going as long as they're following the holy spirit amen I was sharing with a a couple Brothers this week and I got a notice in my LinkedIn page of my old boss back in BC and and when I was in BC many of you know I was in a job and and uh I was very persecuted there and it came to the point where I couldn't stay anymore and so I left and I just wanted to take time off to kind of recover and see what the Lord would have me to do and I never got that brother Jonah Emy called me up he said I want to go elk hunting come preach for me while I'm gone and so I went to do that and I wanted to go hunting just get outside get away from it all and in the end I didn't get that I got a day and a half of hunting and then I got this job offer to go work for a company and and and the president had had picked me to take his place he knew that things were going to be changing in the in the near future and so this week he got his big promotion and he was made the CEO of now this multinational corporation and so this would have been the week if God had continued to bless me that I would have been the president of aund million Corporation in Canada the ep the the epitome of what a person would generally want in their career and you know what I'd have been miserable you know I was talking with brother Joe about it and he was talking about a sacrifice I said I don't look at it as a sacrifice not at all what's the sacrifice the sacrifice is just to stay in God's will amen and so you can have it all and you'll never be content and you can have less and be more content with that less than you ever would have had the other way and so I look at that and I just say praise the Lord for where he's brought me that I am content with what I have that I am content with where I am that I'm content in the ministry of his service above all else and that's where contentment is found is finding yourself in God's will anden I learned it back a long long time ago that when it comes to careers when it comes to business when it comes to making money so often it can be at the whims of men and women and these different things and and you can come in and out of favor and you can have lots of money you can have little money you can have a big house you can have a you can have to rent you can have great cars you can have poor cars it can be all sorts of things but there is nothing greater than to find that you're following the Holy Spirit and when you find that place everything else just Fades away and there's great contentment Paul talked about he says I've learned he says I've had a lot and I've had a little but wherever I am he says I've learned to be content with where where what I have and I just want to thank God for that this morning that when I saw that announcement there wasn't a single lick of regret not at all not at all not not one little bit I said I and I talked to a CO a colleague about it he's over in BC and he manages his client and he sent me the news I said yes I saw that I said but I'm glad I am where I am doing what I'm doing amen and I believe that's the grace of God that we can find where we are and say I'm happy to be where I am why because I know I'm following the Holy Spirit Church if we're discontent where we're at there's a problem amen because either we're led by the Holy Spirit or we're not and if he leads us then we need to be be able to find that contentment we in whatever we're doing and and whatever position he's placed us we've got to find this now not just in a in a general sense but a day byday sense to say the holy spirit is leading me today amen that what I'm doing today where I am and and what I'm going through is all of his purpose and plan I I've talked about this before and I know I keep repeating it but I I'm trying to get us to a point where we'll say today I'm LED not just big picture but to stay say in everything that I go through today I want to be led by the Holy Spirit to recognize that whatever we Face whatever situation it is whatever person it is whatever conversation it has we have it's not just life it is God leading us and guiding us into situations and into people's lives and these different things and I've talked about it how how in the mornings when brother Dwayne fair was here I took a real correction from that Pulpit where he said don't pick up your phone first thing in the morning don't go look at the news don't go look at sports give that time to God first thing and that's what I've done since then faithfully and what do I do I pray over my life I pray over my day I pray over my wife my family whatever it may be and I said Lord let us witness of you today and whatever it is let us be a testimony for you today and you know what happens church is when you pray for something you get an expectation for that something because it sets you up now to step into whatever God would bring your way and now when things come your way whether they're good or whether they're bad you can say God's in it and you can approach it with a different thing it's put me in expectation to be used and it's exciting to know that God is going to use you in a day that you're not just walking through that you're not just going to go to work from 8:30 to 4:30 and then come home and and rest for a while and go to sleep and live for the weekend that's Satan's kingdom that's Satan's mindset is to put in the work and then try and relax so that you can get to the weekend and just have a good time off no everything that we do is ordered of the Lord amen we're pre preaching on stepping up this morning and I want to preach this morning from a from an attitude of of faithfulness amen we've talked about coming into a higher understanding and a an awareness of how our lives are ordered by the Lord amen but as we talked about our sisters last we last last service it's it's sometimes hard to wake up and think that cleaning the house and making the meals and watching over your children is your adopted position and why is that it's because we forget that we're about the Lord's business amen that he is trying to do something through Us in those little things day by day and if we can see that then we can see the influence we have and we can see the power and the authority that God has put behind us in that role to produce his word and to produce his will so as I said I want to talk about stepping up in terms of faithfulness this morning in the day-to-day Simplicity of our lives and recognizing how God moves and how he sets things up anden as I said these these things that happen are not happenstance it's not just just uh Co incidence but amen the the the order the the the things that happen in our life were ordered of the Lord and Paul David would say this in the Psalms he says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Delights in his way and I've got the Amplified there and you can see that that that phrase order by the Lord means that they are established they're directed they're prepared and they're settled and when we put it all together we see that everything that we face as long as we are in the will of God is ordained of God and in other words it is there for a purpose it is there for a purpose amen and it says there that God Delights in our path God Delights in what comes our way so when we're on the Mountaintop experience it pleases God but when we're in the valley experience it pleases God equally as well so whether it's a great time whether it's a struggle time whether it's a victory time whether it's a battle time through it all God is pleased why because he can see the beginning to to the end he knows what it's bringing us to and so he's sitting there and he's saying she's going through it but watch what comes afterwards she's going to stick with it she's going to make it through and look at the victory that's coming out amen so often we want to be on that Mountaintop we want to be in that place where we're praising and we're worshiping but you've got to understand that praise and worship is a life lived in his word it is not the words we say after the victory it's the life we live in the battle that matters the most amen whether we're working whether we're resting whether we're playing whatever it might be if we're in the will of God then that's what pleases him is because he sees what it's bringing us to life's not a continuous Victory anybody that's a Believer knows that life is more of a continuous battle with brief moments of Victory before you go on to the next battle amen this is not a life of ease it is not a a life of pleasure but it is a life to stay with the word of God no matter what the situation is amen what is the great revelation we need that if we're in a battle and we're in his will then he has brought us to the battle to defeat whatever lies in front of us and we're built to take that battle we're built to take the victory in that battle brother Bram says this he says and I find out here in the seventh Church age we find out we've missed something when a prophet says we've missed something that means we've got to make sure that we're not missing it today he says there's something wrong we find we got into a desert and all the fruits is dried up we don't have no more love peace Joy long-suffering Fellowship that we ought to have like they had at the beginning he says the fruits have all dried up in the deserts he says seven days he's talking about the church ages really means seven Church ages going without finding the real living God we've run off on little isms God gave Luther justification he run off with it he gave Wesley sanctification he run off with it Pentecostals speak in tongue people speak tongues and they all run off with it he says God wants to call us together in a Unity of power to bring back the fullness of the Holy Ghost into the church again with all the spiritual gifts in operation in every local body he's saying it's supposed to be there he says yes seven days without God LED them into a desert it's the same thing now his fruits dried up I imagine as they moved out over the hill from the green valleys and things they begin to see the place is kind of drying off he says you know everybody wants a Hilltop experience but they never want to take the valley well that's human nature we want the good times we want the good feelings we want the good emotions we want the the the Plenty rather than the lack that's what we want but if you see somebody that has had everything all the time you know what they are they of all men most miserable he says every night if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues running around over the floor something another you didn't have any kind of a meeting we can get into this mindset that special meetings mean that we're shouting and jumping around how carnal I'll say it again how carnal he says well you know it's all right to be up on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night and when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit that's what happened now what's he saying he's saying you need real valleys before you can have real mountaintops what he's saying is what you call Mountaintop experiences probably aren't Mountaintop experiences they're just what the rain falling that's not a Mountaintop experience a Mountaintop experience is Victory it's not emotion it's not sensation it's not a good time we love the good times I'm not saying let's not have good times but he's saying that is not where the victory is that's not the Mountaintop experience and he says what we find out that it's not because when the cold time comes we've got nothing left if we really had a victory we'd have something left after those Mountaintop experiences he says we put too much on mountaintop experiences of dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of all night prayer meetings down in the valley of decision what he's saying is you need to have some Val experiences at home before you get some Mountaintop experiences at church amen this is an all day thing this is an all week thing this is not just come to church and have an experience in the holy spirit because that's all it might be it's just an experience he says where you have to come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place we grew fruits up there but the fruit kills it that's right and every time there comes a little cool spell you've got nothing to rest upon he says when the emotion dies down then the shouts all gone the noises cease then where are you at what does it look like he says the Temptation comes along and then you can't take it what we need is to get down to that grinding place down there in the valley and dig out he says that's exactly right it's where the church needs to be tonight listen where did Israel have the greatest peace it wasn't in Egypt cuz there their task Masters worked them so hard they had no peace and it wasn't in Canaan because in Canaan it was constant fighting wasn't it do you know where they had the greatest peace in the desert you know why cuz nobody wants the desert there was nothing good in the desert you'll find that if you seek natural peace it's always a place of compromise there's no promise there cuz there's no there's no enemies there cuz there's no promise there there's nothing worth having there you want to have a life where nobody's bugging you you got to go someplace nobody wants to be that's right brother Bram says this he says stay in good standing with God let the rest of them go if they want to follow let them follow if they don't let them stay where they're at you're bound for the promised land like God said to Joshua he says it's a very type of them new ones coming out he said you've been on this mountain for 40 years wandering around what did they do out there them 40 years he says did God curse them no he blessed them in what he took care of their needs that's all church if we ever get to the place where it's just about our needs being met we've missed it we've missed it as was reading where Paul said you know when they were out and and and he says we we were scared we were in fear for our very lives things get tough for the Believers at times he says did God curse them out there he says no he blessed them oh they married wives and grow good crops and rais babies oh they had a wonderful time God was with them but it still wasn't the promise we can sit there and we can say I have all that I need I'm good but do you have the promise of this age do you have a resurrection and a Rapture coming up inside of you is there a Fountain of Life producing the word in your life are you just sitting here saying I have what I need that's what he's getting at it's a spirit of compromise it's a spirit that's willing to be to settle for far less than what God has told us what we what we own our inheritance inside of us we ought to be after peace Romans says that you know live peaceably with all men as much as lies within you as much as you can seek after peace but the thing is is that we're in a world where there's two kingdoms and we're with one of those kingdoms and guess what the other Kingdom doesn't want us to live doesn't want us to thrive it doesn't want us to prosper in the word and Satan's only goal is to destroy us which means we're not going to have peace while we're here well we get three and a half years of Peace when we go to the marriage supper of the lamb and then it's War for a while and then it's more peace and then it's the end then it's another war and then it's all done we're not going to get peace here Jesus said in John 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and destroy this is Satan's Satan's purpose but Jesus says I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly so our peace is in Christ Our peace is in the Holy Spirit it is not in the the fact that we're not battling that we're not fighting that things are going our way no our peace is in that he has called us he has chosen us and we are walking Our Lives according to his will amen we're in a place of spiritual Victory which means we're also in a place of spiritual battle every single day why because Satan's goal is to steal kill and destroy and God's goal is that we would have life in that more abundantly there's a disconnect between those two they're at completely opposite purposes and so Satan's trying to steal what belongs to us us he'll steal your joy he'll steal your peace he'll try and steal the fruits of the spirit he'll try and steal your family he'll steal your children whatever it might be and failing that he'll try and kill you take the life of God out of you praise the Lord he can't that in the end something keeps holding me that The Anchor Holds as we've sung so many times but then after that what's he looking to do is destroy the effect of the word in your life destroy the work that God's been using you for all of this time Satan's trying to hold back everything that belongs to the child of God and we've got to take it we've got to hold on to it and we read it in our opening scripture where Paul said but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I want to talk about what that Victory does in our daily lives because Paul doesn't just leave this as some ethereal spiritual thing this is not just a spiritual Victory this is not just something we're going to have in the resurrection and the Rapture but this is something that comes down to to our very day-to-day lives as we'll see amen Paul says this is what victory looks like in 58 in verse 58 he's saying this is what this Victory ought to do in each and every one of our Lives it's not just a future Victory it's a right now Victory amen I'm interested in Victory right now there is a last victory that's over death hell in the grave and that's what he's talking about before this but there's a victory in the love divine that happens in our life day by day amen and he says in verse 58 therefore he says because of this Victory through Christ he says my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord why for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord he's saying you need to be this way this Victory ought to do something for you it ought to hold you steadfast in the calling where with God has placed you why because you know it's going to have an effect it's going to have impact there's a purpose behind all of these things and so what's Satan trying to do get us distracted from that daily steadfast immovable always abounding he's trying to get us to turn our derer off to understand what's happening in our day-to-day lives right Paul says always abounding because Satan's trying to get us to be Duty bound rather than spirit-led come on that's that's that I'm German I can go long time on duty but what happens is when you run on duty is eventually you just get worn out and you can't take it anymore and you're tired and you don't you know you ought to be more satisfied than you are but you're not why because you've lost the vision your discernment has been turned off it's gone offline and you don't realize that your day today is not Duty it is will it is God's will it is God's life for you amen Duty driven rather than spirit-led day by day Spirit Le Moment by moment to recognize that there is something going on all the time and God's trying to bring us to a place where we'll recognize these things what happens is we lose the idea of our purpose of what God's trying to do and we drop back into duty rather than than being spirit-led and what do we do we get tired we get worn we get brittle we get fractured we've got to see where where we are because God has placed us there this is the effect of the victory that Paul says in verse 58 he says be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding that word steadfast means firm and settled now unmovable is an interesting one because we think that means it cannot be moved but when you go to the original word it means firmly persistent remember like that woman that was going to the unjust judge and she kept knocking and she kept bothering him until she got her need met that's what unmovable means I won't let go I'll take you at your word I'll take you at your word I'll remind you of your word I'll remind you of your word I'm not moving from the promises and the word of God I'm not going to do it that's what he means here unmovable unable to be moved from your place and your position in Christ then he says always abounding I love this it's it means exceeding increasing overflowing so rich that there is an abundance so this victory that Paul's talking about in our lives ought to make us all of those three things you know what that means Church it means give it all you've got don't hold back don't just give it a halfway effort I was reading a quote there brother bam said a halfway chrisan is the most miserable Christian listen Church a halfway mother's the most miserable mother a halfway father's the most miserable father a halfway employees the most miserable employee because they're not getting anywhere there's nothing good coming out of what they're doing but if we give it our all that's when we start to see the results because why we're doing it with purpose we're doing it with purpose we've got a revelation amen we're not living for the weekend as we are talking about but we're living every moment what under the revelation that we're doing these things for purpose it's not about energy it's about faithfulness it's about saying Lord keep me true to your work it's that steady Christian Life that consistency amen but that consistency needs to be fed our Revelation has to be be be fed we have to be reminded Peter would say stir up your P pure Minds by way of remembrance that's why we read our Bibles in the morning that's why we pray to the Lord that's why we spend time listening to worshipful music it's to remind us of our purpose to remind us of who we are on a regular basis you know we can get caught up in the Simplicity of our lives but Moses when he came to that great meeting in the with with the the the the burning bush you know what he brought with him he brought with him a Shepherd staff he brought the tools of his day-to-day work with him and what did God say he says what do you have in your hand Moses says how am I going to do this Lord how am I going to bring these children out and God says what's that in your hand Moses God how am I going to bring people to you God how am I going to be a witness for you what's that in your hand son what's that in your hand daughter and he used Moses what training his career to go and deliver Israel he put Power into that staff it was a symbol of God's Authority and power and when Moses would raise that staff when he would point it things would happen and things would change and we even know it would transform into a a snake and then it would come back into a rod again God would use those little things day by day to what produce the Supernatural and we can sit here and we can say I'm nothing I'm little I'm just a mom at home I'm just a kid at school I'm just a young sister at work how is he going to use God saying what do you have in your hand what have I given you where have I placed you let me use whatever it is you have and you'll see the Supernatural start to work the nobodies are the ones God's coming to use anyways Jesus would say this in Luke he says and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God poor there does not mean lacking in in money your wealth that word poor means devoid of spiritual arrogance nobody's people that say what am I in the kingdom of God am I anything that matters it means those who regard themselves as spiritually insignificant it doesn't mean they are insignificant it means they consider themselves to be insignificant that's the ones that Jesus said listen the kingdom of God is for you that's who the Holy Ghost is for that's who the working of God is for as the ones that think they're nobody's cuz that's the only ones he can use and the ones that thought they were somebody he had to beat them down and break them apart we've got to start out as nobody's but this message came in this in this time and in this season and in this age to take us out from nobody's to say you are actually somebody though you're a child of God you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you are in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and there's only a few that are that way so rise up as we saw as we sang this morning Rise Up On Wings of Faith recognize who you are you're an eagle in a chicken yard and start living and start producing what is in you to be amen it's the common people that heard Christ gladly but what does this word do it opens our eyes of understanding to recognize who we are to recognize what's going on around us and it's Christ revealing himself to us that's what the new birth is is Christ revealing himself to us that we're a part of him that we have a place in him that we have a purpose in him amen that means we're a manifestation of the word the same as Christ was and that's a heady thought to somebody that thinks there are nobody that I'm a part of God that Christ is revealed through me that we're not just here to use up our share of oxygen that's allotted to each person in this earth and then we go off and that's it it's said and done no but there's this day byday thing and I think it's one of the greatest things missing from us is that we're looking for God only in the big things and we're not seeing him in the day-to-day little things we've talked about that mountain being removed Pebble by Pebble Pebble but can we see God moving in our lives Pebble by Pebble you got to we have to realize and I know this is when they when they preach the the Rapture so often it was preached as an instantaneous thing because that's the finish of the Rapture but as we've grown in the ministry and in this message we've realized that the Rapture is an ongoing process that brings us to an instantaneous moment there are things that are happening every single day that are bringing us to that certain end and if we can see the little things that are happening it gives us face for the big thing that we're looking for at the end because the big things are just a bunch of little things that are built that's it that's it as I've said before if we're waiting for this big bang to happen at the end we probably going to miss it because God is moving all the way through to build us up line upon line word upon word here a little there a little just building up that bride into his Perfection amen Small Things always lead us to the big things brother bam says this in adore and adore he says and God does it that way he's very unusual unusual times unusual ways and sometimes little things he says we fail to find God many times because it's we think too small now we look at that as an external thing it's too small but we're talking about us this morning about us that think we're too small he says well you say all I ever done was haral out these old clouds he's talking about a farmer he says I'd take out early in the evening I didn't know how to make my kids a living I looked at the poor fellas with no shoes on I've sat and cried I've got an old buggy and me and ma went to church brother saying I barely have provided for my family and I'm just doing what I know how to do he says don't you worry brother you just keep loving him he's got a purpose for you you just stay right where you are and just go right on see you might never preach a sermon but you might be the great-grandfather of one that'll do it did you know that God credited Levi to pay ties when he was in the loins of Abraham when melkisedek met him in other words Abraham's work Abraham's Faith was to produce something that would benefit Levi in the future and he never knew it he never knew it as we said last service we talked about that mountain that's moved Pebble by Pebble and if we're waiting to see the mountain move our faith will usually fail if we're to be honest amen been there done that got the T-shirt but if we can see the little Pebbles moving what does it do it sustains our faith it sustains our faith and so what we've got to be doing is saying Lord where are you moving Lord help me to see it brother bman has said this many times people can see what God did and people can look forward for what God's doing and they miss what he's doing right now we're talking about seeing what he's doing right now in the little things that we do day by day when it comes to our adoption our position in Christ all these things if we're waiting for the big things it's because we're missing out on the little things we'll see that adoption comes by a series of small things we see it in David's life where God started with him he comes out and he's anointed by the prophet the spirit of God drops on him he's got a king anointing and where does he go he's maybe 14 years old 13 years old he goes right back out to the sheep and what does David do he stays faithful as a Shepherd that's all what an anointing was on him and he goes right back and he proves his faithfulness in the shepherd business kills a bear kills a lion and then God says okay David you proven faithful net let's step it up a bit and he takes him over and he meets Goliath David's got a king anointing what's a king anointing Victory always Victory he sees Goliath he says how come this guy's still standing and the spirit of God is on him and he goes out and he kills Goliath and then what happens is he becomes a captain in the Army and he's faithful in all of those little things and so that by the time he gets to the big seat he's faithful in it because he's been proven in the little things now he's been proven to take the big things Jesus said this he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in the much whatever you're doing with the little things is what you'll do with the big things I have a funny story to tell on myself when I was in Texas I had this great idea that I wanted to patent and then see if I could develop it but I was worried because it was going to make me a multi-millionaire okay but I was worried because it was going to make me a multi-millionaire and you know what my worry was that it would change me and so I went and I talked with my pastor Brother David mcgi and my wife was there and and I told him about this idea and I said but Brother David I said I I don't know if I should do this I said I'm worried that that kind of money would change me and you know what he did he burst out laughing he said John he says the way you are with money now is the way you'll be with money if you get a lot more the way you are now is the way you're going to be and we see it in our lives you see it with people that don't have much but they've got the latest phone they've got the latest sneakers and they've got the latest gadgets and they've got nothing else and you give them a bunch of money and they'll just waste it on more toys and you got people that don't have much but what they do they use very Faithfully they're very conservative and you give them a bunch of money and they'll do the same thing Jesus said listen whatever you're doing in the small things that's what you're going to do in the big things and you can pretend all day long that you would change when the big time comes up but it's not why because the little things are proving your nature they're proving your character they're proving what's inside of you and so if you're not going to be faithful in the little things then the big things aren't going to come your way we're talking about stepping up we're talking about faithfulness this morning and we've got to have that same vision that Christ has that same understanding that I'm here to do the will of my father and in everything I do I I was reading a quote where brother bam says that a a real Christian they will do the the right thing whether anybody's watching or not that's a test of character see just just simple human Pride will tell make us do the right thing when other people are watching but what holds us when nobody's watching that's got to be the Holy Ghost that's got to be something inside of us he says this he says I said as I said about Arnold van winkl that was the one that R ran and and threw himself on the spears to save Switzerland he says do all you can with what you have so just be faithful in the office that's given you you know what faithful means it's two words faithful full of faith no doubt no doubt believing that where you are has purpose has meaning has impact has value that it's for a reason and with that come rights with that comes god-given position with it comes Authority don't doubt where you're at but trust and be faithful in those little things I want to walk us through some some things this morning and I want to start with two seemingly unrelated ideas almost Polar Opposites to see how it fits into faithfulness now brother brandom I want to start with quote before we go to the scriptures he says now Moses being called for this purpose but he was a man God trained him 80 years before he was ever able to use him 40 years in the palace 40 years in the wilderness he says God can train a man take him a hundred years for 30 minutes of work God knows how to train so it's a the way we can read this is that it's a bunch of work for just one moment of time where God has ordained them to do something so they spend all this time and it all comes down to that 30-minute window now that might seem excessive that might seem excessive that we're working for a 100 years to do 30 minutes of work but how does that look in real life see it's not like we're just going to be walking through life and then boom something's going to happen and we do it it's that faithful day byday humble Victorious Christian walk that leads up to that 30 minutes because what happens is we can sit here and dream up all these kinds of ways that God's going to use us but the fact is most of us it's just going to be simple humble ways when you read the Bible you don't have 50,000 people doing Mighty works you know what you have you have 50,000 people living simple humble Victorian Victorious Christian lives not Victorian lives right and then you have certain ones that the spirit of God will drop down and use in a very special way we see in the scriptures people in there and they just have one mention One Moment One event but what we don't see is everything before it and everything after it and that's what we want to talk about amen they might not have even known that what they did was going to have the effected head Abraham certain didn't certainly didn't know he was paying Levi's tithes did he we can s a seed and not even realize we've done it and we don't realize so many times that we've even passed that that that point in our lives we can look in the scriptures we want to talk about somebody that's that's just got a moment where they've got to stand up and we look at non the Syrian captain and he had leprosy and he was doomed to a life of Separation back then if you were a leper you couldn't be around Society you couldn't be around people and it was a life where you would slowly just lose your fingers and your toes and these things and it would slowly creep into the rest of your body and then you'd die in agonizing death and that's what he had in front of him but we see God had prepared somebody for non we're talking about stepping up faithfulness wherever you are he says now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria oh non was a tool in the hands of God he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away a captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on non's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he will recover him of his leprosy so we've got a little believing girl raised right around Christian Home raised in a believing home and she had faith in the promises of God she was raised right you know sometimes we look at our kids that have gone out and we say what's gone wrong you know sometimes they're a witness even in their fallen condition because they won't go certain places they won't do certain things there's still something in them that holds them scripture says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he'll not turn away from it and there's things that are locked in when we teach and Tra raise our kids in the admonition and fear of the Lord that'll hold them even in times when they don't even think about it it's just built into them in these things but this this young woman this young girl we look at her life and we'd say how unfair how unfair that she's taken away from family she can't go to church she can't worship the way the rest of them she can't even give a sacrifice she can't be under the blood everything that she would be crying out for she can't have it and yet she's here in the household of her master and she's sitting there and she's got to make a decision do I testify or do I not do I say this is God's judgment on him for for taking a child of God and putting them under servitude this is a man that owns me as a slave why would I do anything good for him but we see something in her and whatever it was she says I just wish that he could be where the Prophet is cuz if he was with the Prophet The Prophet would heal him and she gives his testimony she could sit there and in her bitterness decide no I'm not going to say a thing or she could say there's a need and I know how the need can be met we can lead a horse to water we can't make it drink she couldn't Force non to go but she could tell him there's a remedy there's a remedy there's an answer to what you're dealing with how many times do we sit quiet because we're worried about the response we're going to get because you know what they'll label us Fanatics Holy Rollers right-wing nuts these days everything Christian is associated with the extreme right my wife was sharing something about how you know she was with a a Homeschool Group and they said a certain thing and she was just going to let it go and then but she said you know what I'm not going to let it go and she said I am not that I am not this and I am not this and by the way I'm not this either because what they're doing is when they hear Christian or where when they see Holiness they automatically assume you're a certain way and they put you into a box with a bunch of other people and she said no I'm not going to be that way I'm not that way I'm not one of them I'm different I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God we've got to be able to stand up and be branded but let's be branded by the word not by what they think about us amen what was the end result of this this little girl speaks up non finally decides that he's going to do it he goes there he goes through his little trial he finally goes and dips in the Jordan seven times he didn't just get healed church he gave his life to serve Jehovah after that he said I'm going to go back and I won't sacrifice to any more Gods he says I'm going to be forced to go into temple with my master he says and I'm going to be forced to Bow he says but I won't pray to that God he gave his heart to the Lord because that little girl in her little position testified of a living God we read that quote where brother Bram says God can train a person for 30 minutes of work but like I said we don't see what leads up to that 30 minutes of work and how God is working and building us up to that and we say that it's just a moment but there's a lot of little moments leading up to the big moment amen it's a life's work to get to that you know what sometimes we don't even realize we've done our 30 minutes of work we don't realize the seeds we planted we don't realize the impact we've had until much further down the road and we've been in that ordained adopted position and we've literally done the work that God has required us to do and we don't even know it yet because what we're waiting for the results but as soon as you did the action the results were guaranteed because you were doing the work of God that's why we never stop working we never stop believing we never know when we' finished our work we never know often when we're actually doing the work that's why we need to be Spirit L is to trust that everything we're going through is Led of god listen to this Ecclesiastes 11 says cast your bread upon the waters for you will find it after many days what is bread represent in the Scripture it represents the word of God what's he saying he's saying take God at his word and put it into action put it on your lips put it on your mouth talk it live it put it out there don't hold it to yourself but put it out there amen and what after many days you'll see the results not the day you give it is the day you get the results there's people that I've been witnessing to now for over a year year and a half there's people I've witnessed to for decades now and they keep coming back from time to time and I don't know if they're going to come in or not so what do I do stay faithful keep witnessing keep encouraging keep pointing them to the word that's what we do day in and day out and day in and day out keeping that word in my mouth keeping it in my mind so that I'm ready to give an answer so that I'm ready to be used in these things why cuz there's Souls out out there that are trusting that are waiting that are needing us to be in our position as Sons and Daughters of God brother Braham says this he says until the burden gets on the Christian church for lost souls we're fighting the air you know what fighting the air is Shadow Boxing where you're practicing practicing is good but it doesn't achieve anything in the end you got to get in the ring you got to put it to use you got to start fighting it looks good but you've got no opponent you've got no purpose in it your training he says we got to get past the training we've got to get to actually doing he says I believe in gifts and signs and wonders why certainly that goes with the body but let's not put that ahead of love and lost souls let's get a burden on our hearts he says nothing but lost souls it's the only thing that's got any value in it it's the only thing we get to take over is our soul amen money passes away homes Decay and go away everything in the Earth moves away the only value lasting value I'd rather have one soul in glory that I want to Christ to know and see that that light of God circles around that Soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that then to have every penny of money in the whole earth because I'd have to lose it all he says but what you send up there is eternal that's the reason we're trying that's the reason we live the lives we live that's the reason we say the things we say that's the reason we don't say the things we don't say Amen we keep still as much as we talk many times and we've got to be led in those things amen we've got it and we've got to let other people have it as well that's the reason why we're here Church mothers that's why you mother fathers that's why you father employees that's why you work bosses that's why you manage is to find Souls is to be a witness and a testimony we're here to gather souls to Christ amen for some it will only be our children and I'm not saying only as if that's somehow a a low thing or a poor thing that is our lot in life is to take our children to Christ and for mothers that may very well be the ones that you bring in but fathers we interact with people on a greater basis and I believe we're not just here to bring our kids to the Lord I believe we're here to bring people around us to the Lord as well everywhere we go we're supposed to be testifying of a living Christ not a dead work not a dead denomination not just forms and Creeds but what it's Christ that's living inside of me what is it it's that steadfast unmovable always abounding life that Paul talked about that's Victory that's Victory on a daily basis amen it's not that we won't have great signs and wonders but it's sometimes we miss the great sign and wonder of a people that can live above this world that people that can have the same mind that don't get caught up in the politics and the the new societal norms and man's ideas and these different things you know I've been going through the church age book with with brother Kingsley and as we read in there we see that the great unification of Satan's power was politics and religion you know what that tells me when we bring politics in here we've lost it has no place I can talk about current events but I am not here to endorse any party any person any system because every single one of them every single one of them is under Satan's control rightwing left wing Center doesn't matter they're all under Satan's control and yet we have preachers that'll come up and and endorse one or the other they haven't read their Bibles they've gotten caught up in their own flesh it may be our gracious attitude it may be our willingness to sacrifice oursel for somebody else that brings them to Christ it's not always the words we say there's people watching us all the time that we have no no clue about brother says this way many times we think just because anything is small that it's not noticeable but Jesus said that even a sparrow who was two of them sold for the fourth of a penny not one of those little birds could fall to the ground without God knowing it God notices little things now let's take ourselves here he says now many times you say I can't do very much about at the conditions today we look around it is a messed up world it is messed up Church there's no coming back there's no saving it it has to be destroyed and a new one brought down and we can look at this and we can say what in the world can I do about this it's just little old me and I don't care if we're the greatest preacher in the world or we're just a a little little kid sitting on the bench today what he says I can't do very much about it the conditions today he says but just a little kind word to someone an invitation a little testimony a little kind smile or a greeting to a passor by might mean more than you think it does it's little my wife and I when we celebrated our anniversary a week or two ago we went to a restaurant to get a quick treat and and the the clerk there at the at the front was very harried she was just there were so many people there they weren't keeping up and so we had to stand around for about 10 minutes and she was just back and forth back and forth she knew that we were waiting there was people behind us as well and so when time finally came for for us to order she came there and she was braced for what we were going to say and you know what I did I said how are you doing and I just gave her a small smile and as soon as that happened she completely changed and my wife commented after she said did you notice how she changed when you spoke to her like that why cuz I had a right perhaps certainly Leo DEA would say I had a right to be mad we're here and we're waiting 10 minutes for somebody to take our order but I'm not there to claim my rights I'm there to be a witness even in something as simple as ordering at a Dairy Queen she figured I had a right to be frustrated and perhaps I did but who cares who cares it's certainly not worth taking it out on a poor little lady that's just trying to make a living amen we don't see so often how those little things can build up to where somebody can trust us to open up about something I've shared what's happened at work and and getting these emails and getting people reach out to me and what is it it's just a little bit by little bit it's a little word here little testimony there little encouragement there a little right attitude there and what happens is people start to put together that there's something different and you'll never mention the scriptures perhaps but just that simple consistency of being something that has Christ someone that has Christ living through them it draws people to you that have needs arrogant people don't need Christ they're not looking for him but people with needs are drawn to Believers I found real Believers brother BR says this he says and many there will be many there that we didn't even think would be there he says for you know at that that that time that I believe that the bread that we've cast upon the human Troubled Waters will return to us on that day I didn't say that when we were speaking but in in the scripture Waters is always people cast the word upon the people and so often we want to make it about the word that we say and forget that the word that we live is just as important he says when we see the effects of Our Testimony on people that we didn't understand their action towards it will probably be there things that we did that we didn't realize that's what brought people to Christ that opened the door that brought them to a place where they could accept what we believe now there's people that hear what we believe and they walk away because it's too different they like the results but they can't they can't go the way that we've gone but there's people that see the results and they say I want the results no matter what and they'll go with what we believe he says we didn't understand their actions toward it we'll probably be there what a day that will be he says then also the seeds that we SED not even thinking that what they would do but here they are that's why I said you may have done your 30 minutes of work and not known it because you solded a seed that was going to bring eternal life he says they brought forth precious fruits and will see them on that day he says the way Wayward loved ones and relatives there are people I see on a regular basis and whether you go to the Post Office you go to the gym you go to the hardware store you go to the grocery store and I don't know their name but I know their face and you might have just those little interactions with them on a daily basis but as you do and as you smile and as you make yourself open to that person you'll find that conversations happen whether it's in the locker room whether it's just standing in line whatever it might be and conversations happen and what are what we need to say is Lord is there an opportunity here Lord help build these little interactions into an opportunity I say Lord help me be ready when the moment comes because what happens so often is we're so busy trying to separate from the world that we can't actually give the word to that person we're trying to stay so separate that we can't be a witness and we say well I'll let my life do it Church there has to come a time where we're our words are going to have to come out of our mouth and we're going to have to interact with an unbeliever rather than walk away from it I can't do it we've got to be able to do it we need to be able to do it I had another incident at work the other day and we were talking about something and I made a a witty joke that was pushing against this agenda that's out there these days and and there is nothing wrong with the joke in itself but it could be misconstrued by a certain group one of whom is my boss and I have that trouble sometimes my my mouth runs ahead of my discernment and as soon as I said it I was checked I was checked cuz everybody laughed she even laughed I think I wasn't facing her but I was checked and so I had a meeting W with my boss and I said I need to apologize for something I said I said such and such when when we were in the the meeting the other day and my boss said oh I don't even remember that but here's the Church she didn't know what to do with the apology because it didn't make anything she did hear it because when I said it she said I heard that but she'd forgotten it it was no big deal to her but here's now somebody apologizing to her for something that's no big deal to her why because it's on my conscience and so I made that right with her and I said I'll try not to to do that again because sometimes what we're looking at is is is we're trying to live that perfect life to be a witness and sometimes it's in the mistakes that we make that the Great witness comes amen when we can humble ourselves when we can apologize when we can put ourselves below the other person when we can even give up our rights at times for the sake of somebody else's benefit you know I remember brother Mark talking about this I hope you don't mind brother Mark he doesn't know what I'm going to say so he can't say yes or no but when he was when he was looking at at potentially leaving um uh newel or you know Bell align these things and they're looking to move him out or changed somebody's position and it was between he and another person and he said let her have it I've got what I need I can make it I can get another job if I have to she needs it more and so he said you can you can let her take this position and I'll step aside that's a greater testimony to many people than if you could quote them uh the entire scriptures because they see something there that no sane person would do which is give up gameful employment at a good company sometimes it's the fact that we'll make something right that wouldn't even twinge their conscience and they're like that's nothing why are you apologizing for that but it lets them know there's a higher plane there's a different life than the one that they're living especially if they're professing Christians especially if they're professing Christians but it's how we humble ourselves how we can do restitution or apology sometimes that is the greater witness than everything else we've done to that point why you know what that shows Church it shows we've overcome ourselves that's the victory that most people don't have is they haven't overcome themselves and when a Believer can humble themselves when they can put somebody else ahead of them that shows we've overcome ourselves there's no fear in our lives there's no worry about the outcome of these things but says this he says make the little housewife so sweet and humble that she'll be able to lead others to you simple life he says the gift that you give her that feminine little lady may she be so ladylike till the neighbors will see her and want to be like her church we need feminine women these days do we ever need real women real ladies real ladies that can be Christlike in their nature and not this forceful arrogant pushy bold amen God bless you sisters God bless you for the way that you can you know we've got the ones that are in the workforce the way that you can stay in your position and represent Christ to that entire workplace he says make the man the shop worker whoever he is Lord make him a humble life like Christ that others might see we'd rather walk in with great signs and wonders he says make him a humble life that others might see we don't know where those people people are standing out there father and we never want to leave the grandle highway he says we don't leave the word ever for anyone he says but we'll lean backwards we'll lean forward we'll reach out way out anywhere to get a soul he says put that within our reach Lord we pray and give us the life that would cause people to want to live like that as we consecrate ourselves to you tonight what's he saying we all have our place we all have a thing of uh to do in our lives and some of us are better talkers some of us are better listeners some of us are more empathetic and some of us are problem solvers we've all got something to bring to people and we approach people in situations differently but one thing that has to be constant is the Life of Christ amen we can approach and we can be different people but the Life of Christ is what matters in all of these things I don't care if you're a big talker or not a talker at all as long as I see the Life of Christ in you and guess what the world looks at it the same way everybody's talking everybody's got a podcast everybody's got a YouTube channel everybody's on Tik Tok everybody's on Instagram everybody's talking but how many are living it's amazing how often it seems like those that are professing to have something to offer to us usually fail in that exact area you know sometimes my wife will come to me and she'll say oh so and so is getting a divorce and it's this family on YouTube that had presented themselves as Perfection and what is it they got so caught up in Perfection that they lost the life they lost the purpose they lost the vision and people end up becoming self they get focused on something that's not family and the whole thing falls apart the world's wanting to see Christ not just here Amen brother B would make this statement and it brings us to the last portion of our message this morning he says but this is my Ministry to declare him that he's here and we know that he would constantly repeat Hebrews 13:8 and he would always remind us that God doesn't change and so when people say I literally share this with my wife I heard a a preacher from this this very month say God no longer sends Gifts of healing flat out and apparently he doesn't read Mark 16 he says that was only for that day God doesn't do it now God uses medicine and science he says and yes our prayers matter but God uses science to heal now what a shame what a shame you know what happened there is people pointed him to Mark 16 but you know what nobody said I've been healed that's the life we're talking about that's the life is that we've not just got a word but we've got a word amen we've got a body word we've got a Living Word we've got a spirit and a life inside of us that produces this word so that when somebody says oh you believe in Divine Healing yes I do because because I've got it because my wife has it because my daughter has it because my sons have it because people in my church have it where no doctor ever touch them yes God can use science yes God can use doctors yes God can use medicine but I've seen him where the almighty power of the Holy Spirit swept over somebody and they were completely healed completely healed so you can't tell me God doesn't heal but what a shame with that man that because he doesn't have it he says it doesn't exist the word says it and where where the word says it ought to be and we don't have it we need to say Lord I don't have it but I want it cuz your word says it's there it's there for me to have amen he says it's my Ministry to declare him what that he's here but where is the reality of Christ found it is not up in the atmosphere and I've talked about this so many times but Hebrews 13:7 is what produces Hebrews 138 the validation of Hebrews 138 is in Hebrews 13:7 I want to read it in the Amplified this morning it says remember your leaders and superiors in Authority for it was they who brought you the word of God he saying men of God came to you he says but observe attentively and consider their manner of living which means the outcome of their Wells spent lives you want to know if you should sit under a Ministry look at their past look at their present see what God has done in their life because if you don't see Christ there then what's coming over that Pulpit won't be Christ it'll be a man every single time look at their family look at their personal life see if Christ is reflected in all of it he says observe and consider their manner of living look at the outcome of their Wells spent lives and imitate their faith their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and ruler of all things and their leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in his power wisdom and goodness and what does that look like it looks like Hebrews 138 it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what we're looking for is Christ revealed in us remember the revealing of God the mystery of God is in three phases or in three ways remember it was God the Father above us that's the Old Testament Jehovah and what was it it was God in the pillar of fire and the thing about that God was that he we could not go to him he could only come to us you'll see in the scriptures that the pillar of fire was always above the children of Israel and then in select times that Pillar of Fire that pillar of cloud would drop down in their midst to do something but then it would pull back up that was the first revealing of God in the father but now it comes down into Christ and now we've got a God that not only can come to us but we can go to him and we can touch him and we can feel him in these things what was it God poured everything he was into Christ and that was God revealed to us but remember there's a third phase there's a third revealing of that mystery and it's Christ in you and it's Christ in me because all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church when he poured it out on the day of Pentecost when that Pillar of Fire was separated out amongst the Believers and it kept separating and it kept filling all the way through what was it it's Christ revealed in each and every one of us amen we're down to where we live and that's the hardest thing for us to recognize that's the hardest thing for us to to to acknowledge is that it's Christ in me now in portion but no less Christ in me Paul would say this in Colossians he says to whom God would make no what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you Christ in you that's the mystery being revealed he says it's the hope of glory the mystery of God is now being revealed in a bride and it's in just little people little nobodies and the thing is will anybody recognize it they will by the lives that you live in the love for one another then Peter comes right behind us and he says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always every day be ready to go to to to what to answer to give an answer to every man that askthe a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear if I were to break that down he says that asketh you a reason of Christ in you because the hope is Christ remember the scripture we read last before that was Christ in you the hope of glory so what they're saying is what's The Hope in you what is it that makes you the way you are why do you have a different attitude why do you differ a different life why do you speak things differently why do you hold back when we press forward and you say it's Christ in me it's Christ revealed in me it's a Living Hope amen we've got to be ready to answer Peter says be ready always be ready to give an answer for why you are the way you are if he says we've got to be ready it's because somebody's going to ask amen the question's going to come why do you do do that why don't you do that you're always going to church why do you dress like that your hair would look so much better when it's cut you don't wear makeup how come I never see you wearing shorts I notice you don't drink be ready to give an answer we ought to know why we live the lives we do and it ought not to be that I'm just a Christian if we're Christlike we got to have a word basis for what we're doing and what we're not doing as well we've got to be ready to step up and give an answer brother BR says that every jot every little jot everything he says You must be faithful in it's always the little fox that spoils the vine it's not the big things you do see our human nature is to focus on the big things we're doing he says it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only its strongest at its weakest link he says blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have a right to enter in do all that God said what does that do when we can live a life by the word it produces Christ and it brings him to those that are in need of him it's not something we're supposed to be holding back it's not something we're supposed to be hiding it's not something we're supposed to be Sheltering it's something we're supposed to be openly showing on our day-to-day lives amen sometimes it's the work is with the people in the church because we're part of a body but some sometimes it's with people outside of it because we're part of a kingdom amen we've got to see that it can't all be with Believers we've got to be able to interact with those that are outside of the Kingdom that need to come in we've got to be spirit-led amen your faithfulness May mean Deliverance for somebody tomorrow it might mean salvation it might mean sanity it might mean support it might mean help in a way that they can't get from anybody else it might be encouragement we don't know the effect we have so many times and we don't know what answer we're going to have to give but we ought to have an answer for why we live and where we're living at and why we want to do it I want to share this little story just as we start to close to what's possible with little people because simple Christians are all God needs you'll see in the scriptures it's not many mighty not many wise not many rich not many great it's just simple humble Believers that he's looking for we don't have to be Big Shots by no means do we have to do that but he's looking for sincere Believers he's looking for sincere Believers and these are the last two quotes before we close this morning he says brother chce one of our Brethren here Satan after him just recently he hit a culvert oh it just cut him up completely I don't see how he ever got out of it alive and so he was laying out there in the hospital church when somebody's laying in the hospital who do we call Ministry call the pastor call that that that that that man that's got a gift of faith call that man that's got a gift of laying on of hands of healing listen to this story he says and there was a little brother come in from New Albany named megf and this is what he said brother chce I'm not worthy to come pray for you he says but the Lord just put it on my heart so I couldn't help it he says and just come out and knelt down and said a little prayer and went out he says God healed brother chce right there see little things Little nudges Spirit Le people you can't fake it you can't pretend it it'll fall flat but if you're led by the spirit of God then something's going to happen it doesn't always happen immediately but it'll happen because what are you doing you're casting your word you're casting the bread upon the Water of the people he says see it's the gift of healing in a man no he says it's the gift of healing in the body of Christ you see one member to another don't think because you're just a lay member you're just as much a member as anybody else he says that's just as much my finger as this arm is my armor this ear is my ear see it's just a member of the body if one member suffers all members suffers with it he says it's a Unity how a blessed Unity God bless you let's Stand Together these days it just seems like I'm always looking for something to happen and I believe that's God working I believe that's God working in a pastor's heart I believe that's God giving me a pastor's heart but I don't just believe it's for me I I've shared the story how Selena one time she was at an appointment and she came home and she says I don't know what happened we just talked about the Lord for an hour and a half and I said I had prayed specifically for you this is not about me praying but I said I had prayed specifically that you would be a witness today this morning not that it would have to happen today but that it would make her witness because she's been so so good with with with dealing with the people that are working these different things and so I say Lord I believe there's a reason for it help her to be a witness and so each of us we come into these situations and we we're around people and we are different we are different and they see it and the question is can we be faithful and step up and share what is that makes us different not that every time we go out we want to tell somebody what's going on but to build up those relationships to build up those moments to a place where they've got the courage maybe to ask or where we've got the courage to tell but it starts with that morning by morning day by day saying Lord keep me in your will help me to open my mouth when I need to open it and help me to keep it quiet when it needs to be quiet and just simply say Lord would you use me Lord Make Me A Witness make me a testimony Lord help me to show your love you may never walk out outside of your house but your children are watching you every day your children are watching you every day how you spend your time what matters to you what doesn't matter to you these different things it's all these little things building up by faithfulness to help somebody else come to Christ amen why am I an expectation because I'm seeing God work I'm seeing God move I'm seeing God change situations I'm seeing God save to to to bring people to him and these different things and everyone out there we don't know which one it is we interact with so many people we don't know who's going to be in or out we may be it but we'll never stop working until we're gone because we don't know when the last one's going to come in brother Braham says the thing that's lacking he says is a desire for Souls God put Souls on our hearts we sing that song Lord lay some soul upon my heart and love that Soul through me and let me nobly do my part to win that soul for thee I pray God will help us to have a burden for Souls anden that in that faithful daytoday simple humble Victorious Christian Life we would say Lord keep me faithful blon and I were we walked into Costco the other day and she saw a sister that was dressed you know very very Holiness and so she went up to her and she she greeted her and she said you know it's lovely to see a woman dressed right and the lady said I know you we've watched some of your services don't know the lady from anybody but she knows us sister Betty was sharing with me of somebody that I've never even heard of that listens to us on a regular basis not a Bel not a message believer people are watching people are looking people are listening and we have no clue no clue how often the impact that we have and God will give us Grace in the eyes of the people and what happens too many times as we think that's just God giving me Grace he's giving you Grace so you can be a witness he's giving you Grace so you can be a testimony he's giving you Grace so you can have an impact that has Eternal value rather than just natural value amen God help us God help me is my prayer Lord Make Me A Witness day by day that I could be faithful that I could step up to the challenge that I'm ready to give an answer for the hope that lies within me amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you see the burdens on My Heart Lord and we look around and we see families we see friends we see children Lord we see situations where they need you Lord but you use people you use our hands you use our feet you use our mouths Lord you use our will Lord you use everything you've given to us Lord as Tools in your kingdom Lord I pray you help us to see we're not just little nobodies Lord but we are ordained and appointed Sons and Daughters of God lord and you're here in our midst Lord in the little things and in the big things Lord in the Great Moments in the valley and the Great Moments in the Mountaintop Lord I pray you help us to not live by Duty Lord but help us to be spirit-led Lord that we could live with purpose every single day Lord not some raw raw Lord cheerleading exercise Lord but a real Revelation Lord of where you placed us and what our purpose is in this great body of Christ Lord would you use us I pray Lord I don't believe you've laid this mage message on My Heart Lord because we don't need it Lord but I believe in the days and weeks and months ahead Lord we're going to each one need to give an answer Lord I pray that you prepare us Lord prepare our hearts prepare our attitudes Lord help us to be quick gracious Lord loving in the things that we say and do that people would be able to listen to what we have to say Lord that they would see the light that's shining through us because of the spirit that lives within us we pray Lord would you grant it we
