process right for the for the service right and the song service is is very much a part of that so we've come to worship him which is what we're doing but we also come for this purpose here to god would by by grace open our eyes that we might see more and more of him because we want to walk out of here with our hearts burning within us right i mean i do for sure and i've come for that purpose and i trust everybody has on a friday night when the world is doing what they're doing and we're in here god will bless us for that by grace amen you come with the right attitude with the right spirit

we keep fellowshipping why because we want to see jesus because why he gave the promise why why come here and why fellowship because he said where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst amen and if we want to go back to the to yeah actually what he said he said where i have gathered two or three amen he said there am i because again there's a lot of gatherings in his name but he didn't gather them here tonight not here tonight here but around the world oh yes there's there's groups here and there's groups there and there's groups somewhere else all around the world amen and they're professing to be christians but he didn't gather them amen because they deny him and they deny his name the deny is his word amen but we're so glad to be here to hear the word amen brother hallelujah what a test of our faith he's going to lay it in and lay it in and lay it in amen brother he's testing see if you're going to receive it see if you're going to believe it amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so brother he's done it all down through what he said that he said his servants he's had his prophets he's had his messengers amen going forward with the word amen to bring up the faith of the s of his sons and daughters amen because they're going to believe it they're going to hear it they're going to listen to the word amen others will get up and walk away but but his seed is going to stay so thank god for the word and thank god for the grace of our relationship with him amen praise the lord hallelujah oh just think oh we're not just christians oh because christ is christ is christian and he's christ-like and we're christ-like no no we're we are the seed of god amen we are the sons and daughters of god amen and he's bringing that out in by the going forth of his word amen because his seed his sons and daughters are going to feed on his word amen they respond to his word they love his word amen praise the name of the lord so brother we when it comes to the natural relationship between us and and natural family oh brother thank god for the relationship between house and our spiritual family amen the relationship between us and our lord jesus christ praise the name of the lord so again just to say that i i just come to the pulpit not to preach i'll try not to amen and uh and i wouldn't surprise you if i did but again we'll we'll leave it to our brother steve and i just want to welcome our brother steve and sister anna amen clara amen from british columbia from alberta amen to newfoundland amen the new found land praise the lord so and uh we brought it that before concerning maybe you know god ordained it god god also put newfoundland here for a reason amen exactly because why because some years ago when when the plane could have flashed out in the ocean the power of god then the plane of the landing gander in in here in newfoundland oh he did yes he did yeah so the the father god was was familiar with newfoundland he knew where it was amen and not only that for that reason because of the plane but because of the of uh of a dog that he had amen and like i said i got a picture of that dog it comes up on my computer and uh it's part newfoundland and part airshire but it's more like a newfoundland we would we'd recognize it as being like a newfoundland dog amen so for the proud of god identified with newfoundland amen and i guess some newfoundlanders and only that i don't know if you're aware of it but there were a number of people from newfoundland that did write william branham letters requesting prayer and in fact in just in in the basement here there are some old papers from another pastor that's going on for a number of years and part of those papers is a letter that his mother wrote years ago requesting prayer for from brother william branham and there's a response to that letter amen and uh saying that uh we'll we'll put you on the prayer list we're going to pray for you and we're encouraging you to believe this way and we want you to do this and they said also send a prayer cloth and and according to the instructions on the letter that they received from brother branham that they had to take the prayer cloth and apply it to where they they feel they need healing in their body he said apply it there amen and so i assume that's what she did many many many years ago that was like i said brother manuel's mother and also also brother manuel did write brother branham many years ago now inviting him to come to newfoundland for services and and he acknowledged it and he said brother uh we're we're putting it on the prayer list on on the prayer list and we we pray the lord give us the leadership he said when he would want us to come to newfoundland amen so of course he didn't come for services i don't know how much longer after that the lord called him home so we thank god that the prophet identified with newfoundland he had connection with newfoundland amen and with with uh yes believers in newfoundland so thank god and we're so glad amen well again for for where where that led us to the word to the message amen that he would leave what through his servant the prophet thank god it's wonderful to god be the glory and as i said they were listening to william branham's sermons and in fact i do know that there was a certain sister the wife of a certain pastor back there that she used to receive brother obama's tapes and uh did on a regular basis and they they did that back back years ago that when brother brown preached and they taped it and then they sent the tapes out to those that that were on the on the list wanting to receive his tapes and at the time it was sister emanuel uh in uh in central newfoundland that was receiving the tapes to and she would give them to brother emanuel she wanted him to hear the word amen praise the lord so thank god brother see that's that's what god does and that's how god does it but by grace amen so and again that was brother manuel uh the main pastor that god used to highlight the message in newfoundland and to introduce the message introduce the prophet amen so we thank the lord for that so god moves in mysterious ways is wonders to perform so we thank the lord again for brother brown's association with newfoundland and again like it's not only not only his dog but but better the the believers our brother emanuel back then for many many years amen to god be the glory amen so let's keep pressing on in the word amen just think after all these years and we're here prophet is gone amen and many of those ministries are gone amen but god got another ministry and we welcome him our brother steve amen uh clara british columbia i understand he said he was in alberta a man and again we might have met in alberta many years ago yeah and uh because i i remember being in brother arrow hildebrand's church many years ago and ministered for him several times there and in other churches there as well so we might have met back then so we we welcome our certainly welcome our brother steve clark and we welcome of course our sister and his wife amen so god bless them during their their visits with us in the next few days amen so keep it keep them in prayer amen and keep the ministry of the word in prayer amen and again keep not just going forth of the word keep the receiving of the word amen if we don't we pray grace that it's not going to be in vain amen but it's going to accomplish what god pleases in your heart amen don't let it just be in your head let it go from here to here in your heart as the prophet god said he's a minute too many he said this is the only years the the years they got to hear the word here there in there out there but he said you got to go into the heart you got to got to hear it with the with that ear in the heart in the soul let them that have an ear not ears let them as an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the church by the grace of god amen so the lord bless us and i'm going to turn it to our brother jonathan thank brother jonathan for his uh association with our brother steve and because our brother johnson also had fellowship with him i guess in british columbia alberta of alberta oh okay amen oh he's not as old as we are okay so anyway the lord lord bless our brother jonathan and i'm going to ask him to come forward and introduce our brother steve and and sing only believe and turn the service over to our brother steve to bring forth the word god bless us amen praise the lord and may god bless you let's stand together as we invite brother steve to come steve if you don't know him stands six foot five 642 pounds and then we've got a big microphone here tonight amen brother steve's got 25 years of ministry behind him he's been a pastor he's been an evangelist he's been a missionary he's been overseas he's done a lot of different works he's done a lot of different things he's a proven man we don't have a novice here tonight we've got a man that's been proven in his ministry and in his calling in his church the lord so we want to pull on those gifts amen he's proven himself in all of those so we want to say lord here's my need and just trust him to come and speak amen we have a rare opportunity when we get somebody in that doesn't know us because when he speaks then we know that it's the lord it's not somebody knowing this or talking to this one or that one but he comes in and the holy spirit can move in them so let's pull on that gift amen let's just open up our lives and let's just rest and trust that the lord's going to speak to us here tonight amen let's sing only believe if we would leave [Music] all things are possible [Music] [Music] [Applause] all things are possible [Music] jesus

blood is still as fresh as it ever was amen so today lord we believe in the impossibilities for all things are possible in you amen father we come today as our brother has already said many things we could be doing oh god but we've come today to to visit with you to fellowship with you when i pray oh god where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst of us lord and so you

brother brandon kesser amen he came and preached here before and uh you know he when he came back to edmonton he shared all the the wonderful things that had happened here in the time we had fellowshipped with you all and i said you know privately lord lord i wonder if i'll ever get a chance to go see those folks and here i am standing today and i i really appreciate brother gerald that

lord how we give you praise glory to your name glory to your we name you this evening o god would you accept our praise this evening father has a sweet offering before you lord oh glory to your name amen oh we worship you lord for the god of the day is still called in the night oh we have trials and struggles oh god we have disappointments but you are still our god oh no matter what lord you're still on the scene how we worship you lord hallelujah how we praise you this this evening lord we give you praise hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus amen praise the lord and the church said amen praise the lord hallelujah why don't you stand with me and we'll go to the word of god and this evening and amen let's turn in our bibles if if we would to romans chapter 14 romans chapter 14 and uh we're just going to just read one verse there and and preach there for just a little time this evening amen praise the lord romans chapter 14 verse 17. amen for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost amen praise the lord righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost amen let's have our seats this evening amen praise the lord hallelujah i'd like to speak to you this this evening on a little thought that i i was praying about and it's a little word on joy you know something we need joy the the world that we're living in is full of darkness and there's peril and there's strife and we're just saying he's the god of the day as well as the god of the night and that brings me great joy and so we want to speak on joy because in a time that we're living in and it's a lady of sia time it's time of luke warmness it's a time where people have cooled off and and you know in our season and a time that we're living with all this this is going on in our in the in the world today there's people that have seemingly uh did not have joy uh because i believe joy comes from the holy ghost and if you have the holy ghost you have joy and so too many today have not received the holy ghost they have had joy which is it's just a season of earthly joy but they've never received the joy that comes from the holy ghost and so today i just want to speak on a word of joy i want to start off and now you've never seen me before and brother jonathan was way too kind amen i felt like shrinking in the back after he said all those words amen i didn't come with a resume to get a job amen i came to preach the gospel amen and so tonight that's what i'm going to do and and i appreciate brother jonathan for saying all those kind of words god bless you but you don't know me and i just want to establish in your hearts as i preach to you these three services that that i believe the message of the hour with all my heart amen uh it's it's the only thing that's going to get us into a rapture and i heard our brother gerald he's speaking about brother branham and and how that he did not get the opportunity to come to newfoundland but the word surely did get to newfoundland and this evening we're we're here in this building and you are a living proof of the word of this hour that's still as real as it ever was and so this evening i want to start off like this just to make sure that we're all on the same page and brother brown speaks a message from jesus on the authority of the word he says the authority of god's word now every word of god is written sworn authority so what we're reading and what we're believing here today is under the authority of the word of god it's god's word to us in this time and this season and brother branham says it's the absolute right on uh right of the believer to accept this as the infallible truth and i say i do because it's god's word heavens and earth will pass away but my word friends this evening my word will never pass away that's the word of our lord jesus and that's the word that was spoken through the voice of our prophet god's word will never pass away saith the lord it must be fulfilled in its season and this hour we are in the season of the rapture we're in the seizing it's the culmination of all times and where all the mystery truths have revealed to the bride and it's an elisha ministry amen we've had an elijah but there's an elisha ministry and you the people of god sitting before me you are that bride's ministry that elisha ministry that's speaking the truth of god in its season we are living in bible times we're living in a time where bible is fulfilled and we're standing upon that word of god that liveth and abideth forever you know the prophet god would often quote a song that he appreciated that he loved and i love this song my my hope is built on nothing less then jesus blood and his righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame this evening we cannot trust upon man you can't trust upon me yet i will do the very best that i can do but you don't cannot trust on the sweetest frame but holy lean on jesus jesus name oh christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is seeking sand all other ground is sinking sand oh let me read one more verse because i love it so dearly when darkness hides his face i rest on his unchanging grace oh friends this evening i got an absolute how many's got an absolute it's his unchanging grace what he said will always be he said i am the same yesterday today and forever he's also said to his people i am god and i change not and so i hold on to that absolute that unchanging grace in every hide and stormy gale oh friends i was just tell brother jonathan took me and i we were looking there and we were seeing some of those star those winds blowing the waters and how they were building and splashing against the rocks sometimes it feels like our lives are in turmoil and there's a struggle and the gales of life are just pounding against but friends this evening no matter how high the stormy gale our anchor holds how many's got an anchor here tonight our anchor holds within the veil and the message brother branham says in satan's eden he says that's all i know to tell that's this bible i believe it with all my heart and you know all my heart it to be perfect unadulterated word of god by this i live and the church said we live by the word of god by this we live by this we stand on the infallible word of god and so this brings me to my thought this evening the infallible word of god says that we need to have righteousness we need to have peace and we need to have joy not just in this temporal life not just this life that we're kind of living and groping in and you know we're raising families then that's what god wants us to do we're working that's what god wants to do we come and we we we fellowship together but friends we need to have that righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost in christ jesus the word in the zoe life in the logos of god that's where we find this righteousness we cannot be righteous on our own try it we cannot be but we need righteousness in the word of god and so we're going to look at this now this word on joy because i believe more than ever we need to have joy joy in the holy ghost the lamb's book of life now i'm going to quote a little bit tonight and i hope you don't mind that i do praise the lord because i can say it but if the prophet says it sounds even better and so the lamb's book of life in 1956 our prophet said he says now watch the bible said that jesus the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world was ever laid oh i know i act funny up here but i feel glorious now i like that because i kind of feel in that stimulation of revelation just right now and you know something you know when when we get around god's word you know i feel like that little mouse story brother branham talks the cat is always chasing the mouse and you know i was a little felon and my parents they allow us to to look at some things called tom and jerry how many of us ever heard that and we see that you know that that tom and jerry was a cat in a mouse game all the time the cat chasing the mouse and there was tests and there's struggles and but you know something that i want to know the end of the book and then a book says the cap okay the cat is defeated and you know something i think about that that mouse cat and mouse game and how that that mouse is running and and you know he runs and runs and he runs on top of that vat you know the van of wine and he spins around there and he happens to fall into that wine how many remembers the story and he falls into that wine and you know he's been chased by that cat he's been a place of turmoil by that cat but when he falls into that wine and he picks himself up he looks around and now he's got a different opinion he's no longer thinking about how that cat's going to eat him for lunch finally he gets some some strength some some muscles something within him some stimulation of revelation with inside of him no matter how small he is he's willing to look at that cat and he's willing to say boo devil you've chased me long enough and he looked up and he looked and said now where is that cat and you know something believers with the joy of the holy ghost with the inside of them they come to that stimulation not of just some earthly something another wind or or something that they stingle and feel but it's the joy of the holy ghost that's down in the depths of our lives now brother branham says now i may look funny funny up here but i feel glorious he says jesus was slain before the world had a first speck of dirt laid jesus already was slain and i think about that for a moment because i look over at my life now did you know there's no perfect people that come to church we come to church so that we might become perfected and so we look at this and i think it's grand because jesus was slain before the foundation of the world for my sin for my affliction for what i've already done and here i'm thankful and this brings me great joy because you know friends our lord knows and took a picture of my beginning and he sees my ending and in between there his blood suffices for everything it emits every sin every shortcoming everything that i have ever done oh i'm thankful for the blood of jesus christ jesus was slain the very minute god spoke the word you were in his thoughts friends you're sitting here tonight listening to an insignificant preacher but through the mind of god he knew exactly that you would be here today on november 12th to worship god with spirit and truth and then brother branham makes a statement and he says and many have spoken this before but brother brown says god already spoke it he says to the believer he says have you got your joy shoes on have you heard that before have you got your joy you know brother dwayne lawson he was preaching up in edmonton and he kind of read this quote and he coined the phrase for all of us you say have you got your joy shoes on and today we want to worship him in joy we've got our shoes on you know a a basketball player or a volleyball player or somebody like that they put a lot of confidence in their shoes did you know that how they've got all kinds of shoes and all kinds of things and they think that it makes them play better you know i have a daughter who who likes volleyball quite a bit and she's very good at it and and uh you know something she played at a very high level and and not to give any glory to the sport but to the glory of god she would like these shoes and she she thought her shoes did a good job in her playing and she'd buy all kinds of expensive shoes but friends this evening it's it's not about natural shoes it's about our spiritual and our feet are shod with the joy of the lord that wherever we go that we show forth the grace of jesus christ the joy of the lord how many knows that the joy of the lord is higher come on you can do that better the joy of the lord is our amenity truly is our strength we're not looking at our muscles ourselves boy somewhere you're pretty muscular around your brothers and that young fella sitting on his daddy's knee tonight you're a pretty strong muscular boy yeah take a look all right you need to get in that vat and realize what you've got amen the joy amen the joy of the lord amen our feet are running friends we are free if you would recognize who you are that you are free now friends we live in satan's zealand but we're not part of satan's eden the taskmaster has whipped us he has tried to put us in bondage but friends there has become a voice in our age a trumpet has sounded and it's a time of jubilee it is the rising of the sun johnny crow you are no longer tied down but you're free the word has made you free oh friends i'm so happy that i serve a god that that gave us dynamics and mechanics together i'm a god that just didn't want to just let's live by intellectualism and i'm glad that he just didn't want us to live by every sort of move of wind but he wanted us to have the full package he want us to live in spirit and in truth hallelujah spirit and truth and so this is the year of jubilee we are saved we are free and we are secured we're secured in christ jesus now i'm giving you reasons for you to express your joy this evening and i'm not afraid if you get up and wave your arms and shout hallelujah because we have a reason to praise him hallelujah you know one time i remember the prophet he was testifying there of a sister who who was he was preaching and she she just felt the anointing of the word and felt so happy and she came to brother branham after and said brother i just felt like getting up and shouting hallelujah and brother branham said why didn't you do it friends we got the opportunity we take in this time aside to give god all the praise so we're secured in christ i want you to notice when the word came and and and came into the womb of your being into the womb of your heart your womb is sealed and there is nothing that satan can do to destroy it to ruin it friends you are sealed god has a there's an eternal security in christ jesus if the word is planted in the womb of your being amen in blasphemous names brother branham said in 1962 he said and god has adopted you and sealed you by the holy ghost into his kingdom and there's no getting out of it i say hallelujah you are eternally secure hallelujah and they ask the people do you believe it and we see we believe and so we can say with brother adams yes i look funny and i am willing to be an audible for jesus christ hallelujah i'm willing just like you to come to church regardless of what happens or what people say or the feeling that people might have in this time of the season under all this medical problem i am willing to say i will stand out for jesus christ i'll come to the house of god i will give him praise i will honor what is to caesar but to god what is god and god deserves god deserves my praise oh now we tend to think of happiness when we think about happiness and we we think and tend to equate and put those things happiness and joy together oh i'm so happy or i i and we say i am so joyful and i want you to notice that there they're two different ideas because they they spring up from different sources one says i'm happy and the other says i'm joyful. one comes from the world around us you know and the and there's another one that you see the others originately directly from the spirit of god so the world around us says i am so happy kind of like you know it's my birthday right and and and my wife you know gave me a wonderful present now now my wife and i have been married now 25 years and it's not been very long comparing to some and praise the lord but but i think it's a milestone she she got to live with me for all these years and she made it through praise the lord but you know funny thing is uh she gave me a gift and i shamefully uh took her to costco we've got costco there and i told her to hold a bunch of flowers and i took a picture and i said well there honey i gave you flowers uh you know something uh but she deserves more than that but she was so kind and she gave me are you coping and they say well i i'm so thankful that my husband my wife my child my grandparent they're on the other side and they say well are you are you coping with your sadness and you say no i have a joy now the world doesn't understand that they have no understanding of that because they're depending their happiness or their joy on the things that are surrounding us we are depending our joy upon a supernatural word that comes from the god that says we have an eternal rest right and so there is a great big difference between it all my soul leaps within me my heart spins with gladness the new testament word of gladness means a bliss of celebration my heart is overwhelmed with joy and pleasure why because the holy ghost that life god's very own life is in my being bubbling up to make me joyful now let me give you an example from the prophet the prophet god said about the stream of water and he and he got next to that water he says water what makes you so happy why are you so joyful he said because the rabbit comes and drinks from you oh that is wonderful no it's not the rabbit is it because the deer comes no that's not is it because no it's because something is pushing and bubbling on the inside of me and this word that we're believing that's right this part of god that we're believing is what brings joy within outside our lives now i've sat many times just like you and and the pastor's been preaching and i'm listening to the word of god and it's coming and it's coming so fresh and i begin to experience something that comes down on the inside of me now i can't explain it but you understand because you're believers if we were trying to explain this outside to the world around us they would call us crazy and i say i'm acting funny yes but i i am doing it because of jesus christ and so i sit there and i listen to the words of the pastors he's beginning to bring the word and all of a sudden something begins to churn inside me and it begins to move inside of me and and this stirring begins to develop in such a way that i can't help but express myself now it's not just my natural feelings and the person who i am and my boisterous nature that's calling up no something on the inside of the inside is moving me now there's one thing when the music plays like today and we clap and rejoice and we praise and we get joyful and but there's something else when the inside of the inside begins to rejoice and you don't know why you're crying oh one time i sat in a meeting it was so strong i don't know if you know our brother stephen francis i believe he's went on to be with the lord but he was preaching daryl's in toronto and he was preaching special meetings there for brother danko and i and i was sitting and i had led some songs for the meeting and i was sitting there in the pew and he began to preach now it was a good message but it wasn't a message where we would click our heels and shout out and you know and all this kind of wonderful expressions we like in the psalm it was a solemn a word of god to the people but exactly what i'm expressing you today something on the inside begin to erupt and i begin to and that you can identify with them tonight my experience is your experience we all have come to this place where the word of god is moving within our being and before you know it tears are flowing and the joy comes out and i'm shouting hallelujah beyond what i would do even as a natural person it's because the word of god become a reality within my being and i could not contain the joy of the holy ghost that's coming out of my very being you know i want you to notice now joy joy of the holy ghost takes a journey now when you're born by the spirit of god into the family of god you're born with all the the characteristics of god you're born with the full patch i've seen i love this i see the statue of the perfect man standing behind me but i want you know all those things all those faith and virtue and knowledge and all those things of god those seven virtues of god they were given to you at your birth but you have to come into the understanding into the knowledge not by now intellectualism but by the knowledge of the holy ghost that you have faith within your life that you have dunamis power in your life that you have knowledge not earthly knowledge but you have the knowledge and the wisdom that comes from god you've got temperance not just you know temperate for one another that allows you to stand at the bank and wait with patience for within the teller no a godly temperance with inside of you you have those virtues already you have a god beloved with inside it's capstone ministry this is the word we're preaching tonight that's right this is the word in its fullness and the capstone ministry of is amongst the people the gopis love of god the joy of god in your being he's here tonight but you have to recognize that you got that all at your birth and it takes a journey amen amen i like to say it like this when you're when you're uh born into the kingdom of god you're a baby okay you're just a little infant in the arm and you before you know it god feeds you and god waters you so to speak and god revelates you gives you of his word and you begin to grow and as you begin to grow it's a journey it's not always easy and god allows temptation to come your way trials to come away what it's all for your perfection so joy it takes a journey to receive all that has god has for you but you've received it already at your birth in psalms chapter 30 are you still okay jesus amen in psalms chapter 30 verse 5 the psalmist he writes weeping may endure for a night but joy amen cometh in the morning so there are seasons there's things that were going in our life but i want you to know the joy of the lord never leaves you just the same as the word of god never leaves you it's always there it's persistence because it is zoe's life it is joy of the holy ghost joy comes in the morning suggesting that after all our struggles all of our tests there are it's a new day it's a new dawn it's a new spring praise the name of the lord i am thankful for newness oh i'm thankful for newness now i i don't i don't grow i'm not a farmer i'm not a vine keeper but i understand that there's special attention that needs to be taken when you grow grapes it takes time it takes diligence it takes patience it takes hard work to make a grapevine produce fruit so fruit is not instantaneous okay uh you know there's a lot of something that that goes on with it it's it's it's just not oh i plant it walk away and and to and to you know the next few months all of a sudden i'll have a bushel of grapes it takes time okay it takes diligence you know where i'm going with this it takes patience and so for you to receive more of the word which we've already established is our joy it in order to receive more revelation from god it takes us as believers time time how time in the word of god time to meditate upon the word of god not just reading a a portion of scripture as we fly out of the house in the morning and return in the evening it takes us to have a thought a meditation around the word of god it takes diligence it you know you you've got to be diligent you have to be you have to have a routine you have to have a a habit amen amen around the word of god okay you you have to subject this flesh to the will of god you see you have a part to play in this if you want the joy of the holy ghost you want the peace that passes all understanding you want to have righteousness live out in your life friends you need to have some diligence and you need to wait upon the lord they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with eagles we know we like to fly in the heavenlies we like to soar our wing the wings of the eagles but friends it takes us learning patience humbling ourself before the lord to make this fruit come about but now you're going to get some weather in your life some undesirable weather brother geralt and it's going to flow into our and we're and we're saying whoa hold back the snow the storms okay we were talking with brother jonathan about a great big snowstorm that happened some years ago here and you think he called it snow storm snow snowmageddon you might have a snowmageddon in your life you might feel like your truck has got six feet of snow on top like we talked to this you might feel like you're never going to get out of this situation i want to tell you we believe in a god of the impossibilities he'll get you out of that storm if you'll hold on bad weather does not cause a christian to move away out of the presence of god bad weather in our life causes us to move closer closer to god brother brandon preached a whole message on desperation yes think about that now for a sense friends if we could come to a place where we didn't have to go through desperations and we were just yielding to god we would live these amazing year victorious lives but being in this human life being in this human body god already knew he had to put us in situations where there's weather and there's bugs and there's weeds and there's poor and there's a neglect of spirit there's all this coming in your way to cause you some hindrances why to get you closer to him the whole purpose of all of this is that we come back into fellowship with god you are no longer called church you are called bride and the bride of jesus christ walks with christ in the cool of the evening speaking with him in fellowship like they had back at the garden of eden there is no other place that fulfills the joy like that place in the cool of the evening with almighty god so tests are inevitable bugs in our life how we don't like them they're inevitable but we are overcomers through christ jesus we can face it we can face the storms listen covet this season of code for the last two years has put a lot of pressure on people oh i understand that this is meetings that you haven't had for two years to gather and have a special meeting and so forth that's pressure amen and then not knowing from sunday to sunday whether or not you're able to gather that is pressure then looking at our friends and even some of our loved ones that have sort of turned their back on the truth because of the pressures or people fighting against one another because they're vaccinated or not vaccinated this is precious but the children of god do not buckle under these pressures because they're hidden in the rock [Music] these are not just cliche words that we use all the time friends this is a fact we are hidden in the rock which is christ jesus but i want you to notice you cannot manifest manufacture any of the joy of the lord on your own you cannot manifest any peace or anything of this nature you need to rely upon god you can't do it by yourself so if we want to see his fruit ripen in our lives then what we need to do is press in to the holy spirit when i say press into the holy spirit we're not pressing saying the holy spirit and then we're pressing into god the father and then we're pressing it no he's the same person he is the word so don't get confused when we say the holy ghost and say while i'm pressing the holy ghost and i'm believing the word and trying to make him two separate things it is the same one amen and we're pressing into his word and we're pruning away all the things that are hindering us now you look at our lives and you look at individually in your life and you see all these things are before you we need to prune away all the excess that does not belong in our christian life i want you to notice when elijah when he went up in the chariot and his and his garment fell down elisha had to pick up that garment and he had to put it on isn't that right it had to fit him correctly now elisha couldn't go to the tailor and say you know something i need it taken in over here or i've expanded i'm a little bit larger than elijah so i i i need in my ministry i need it to be tailored it was not the way he had to wear the garment as the garment fit and the word of god has to fit us this holy ghost life in order to bring us this joy that we're talking about that gives us strength has to fit us exactly as god intended for us to have it fit so you can't trim it here a little and a little bit there and make it fit where you think you like it to fit and live the gospel of here the way you like it god has said take the book eat the book let it become part of you and then when it becomes part of you then it becomes your strength to war against the enemy so don't try to snip the word off here there snip away the worlds take those things out out of you that's with you in their life get them out of your life now i i want to speak in just a moment here about things that that cause our joy to to to be lessened and i'd like them to to speak of it as they're called joy busters okay they they destroy your joy now in galatians chapter 4 verse 5 15 a portion of scripture it says where is the blessedness of the blessedness yes you speak of so the question is is where is this blessedness where is the joy that you're talking about where's this fulfillment of god's life with inside of you and that's the question i want to ask you today where is your joy because it should be oh as first fruits before you your life should thunder with the holy ghost in it when you go down to the supermarket okay your life should express the joy of christ your life should express the word in fact people should look at you and say who is that person they walk with that head hive remember remembers the story of of that that that that plantation there and they were looking there a man was wanting to buy another fellow in that time you know with slavery and there was that man that walked with his head higher than the rest and he said i'd like to buy that felon and he said well he's not for sale well why i'd like why is he not for sale i look how he walks and how he presents himself is he somebody special and he said no he's just like everybody else but he's a son of a king where he comes from and friends that's how we ought to walk okay we're doing our jobs and we're out there and in the industrial world or wherever you you look for for a job you should walk as christ walk hallelujah you should walk with this extra click in your heel you should come on the job ready to work right men we work the bible says learn from the aunt jesus sluggard and we work with the sweat of our brow right to bring a a loaf back home for our families when we do it in joy enjoy this world so we can buy christmas gifts and we can buy thanksgiving presents and one birthday no that's not his we want to present ourselves with the joy of the lord come on friends we are testimonies and when we walk in this world our lives are preaching your life is thundering what do you want us you want to get that last soul let your life speak of the joy of the lord so where is this joy it's in our hearts but there's friends there's things in our lives that cause us to to lack in the joy that we really should have unfold in our lives amen and so i hope you bear with me just a moment now i'm not made to pinch anybody or prick anybody hurt anybody today but hold on to your seat now i believe in a positive gospel [Music] all right and so now remember when god speaks to us it's positive now if god meant negativity towards us he would say as he did with jacob and esau he would say jacob have i loved and esau have i hated you see god doesn't mince his words he just says it i hate esau so if we're going to preach a negative gospel gospel we'd say god just hates you right but we're preaching the gospel that says god loves you and god says those that are my children i chasten you know i hated getting a spanking when i was like you know young people you listen to this i hated it so what i did often times and sorry for deviating but this is just for the young people just a moment you know what i did i i i went and i put on like ten pairs of underpants and then i went and obviously i thought my dad would never recognize my backside was twice the size it ever was but hang on a second that was that was all right because i thought i was going to cheat okay the experience of the fifa ministry on the seat of understanding right but nevertheless my father's spanking okay it was good for me believe it or not i never played with fire again and when those trees were high and the wind was going i never climbed to the top because i received some chastening i do see some understanding that that was not good for the person i was going to become and so the positive gospel we believe god chastens he says things to us and he tells us it's not legalism it is the word of god to us and we say yes lord because we want to walk in your fulfillment of joy amen so here we go what destroys your joy what causes you to have a a lack of joy now i'm now friends remember you cannot lose the the life of god with inside you what causes you to get to a place where you're cooled off shall to speak or backslidden you always have the holy spirit inside of you if you're sealed then you have it but how many has ever felt that place of their life was just cool you go to pray and you pray and it seems like the heavens are brass hello is anybody is everybody hello are you there come on that's where we are so sometimes there are things in our lives that cause us to to be in this situation and i want you to tell you it's one of them is unsatisfied expectations and i like to call it discontentment now think about just for a moment if you're discontent you see the spirit of discontentment robs us believers today to receive real joy we get discontent we get discontent around us the things that are in our life now i want you to notice ever since from the beginning of time there's been always someone and somebody somewhere that's been unhappy well looking for a moment let's start in heaven lucifer curated amongst all the angelic beings to be the brightest to be the song leader of heaven with the most beautiful voice everybody looked oh lucifer's son of the morning but what was his problem discontentment and pride that's right he was discontent to be the very thing god created him to be he wanted to be equal with god and his discontentment caused him to lead rebellion in heaven it caused discord amongst all the under other angels he was he was discontent that he was made the way he was he wanted to be equal with god amen now think in your life the places you've been the things that you've done and all of a sudden you get discontent we see also then we see in the heart of eve you know eve was walking and with adam and they were content walking and walking and as they walked you know we see that serpent influenced by the enemy he he gets her aside and he begins to preach to her now he he doesn't leave the word of god out as we know it he twists the truth of the word of god and he begins to talk to her and you know no doubt now we don't read this from scripture but just take an imagination trip with me for just a moment no doubt there were other animals in the garden that were producing life and she saw it and she had these instincts okay to be a mother but how it was to come was by perfection by the spoken word of god that was god's provided way that was the perfect will of god god loudout permissive will but there was a perfect will of god but you know what got her thinking was the word that was sown from the serpent through from the voice of satan to discontent her amen in the position that she was in now i want you to notice friends these are seeds seeds that are sown and amongst the people the bride of christ we are people that know that we are we're moving towards a celestial city where our builder and maker is god but yet we get tied up amongst ourselves and we start talking and we start bickering and we and before you know it we begin to sow words seeds words our seeds and we sow them and sow them and we don't even mean to sow them in the way we do we want it to be to be positive creatures but yet they come out negative and before you know it what happens discontentment begins to breed amongst believers [Music] humanly i want you to notice this humanly we often say you know i want how many has ever heard this as young people i wish i was older right you're discontent to be young and then the older people say you know what i just wish i was younger how many knows that you know if it's something small we're saying you know i wish it was bigger you know i well i like boats and so we were driving and it's in all these boats you know and uh and and when i was a youngster you know my daddy was so nice he bought me a four foot a 14 foot aluminum boat with a small seven horse engine on the back and i would drive that thing around and i had such happiness but you know what broad bridge begin to breed uh uh discontentment is when my friends showed up in something a little bit larger and a lot bigger and a lot of happier and you know what we do we begin like the prophets of god says we begin to compare with one another like the joneses oh if we just had a bigger church oh if we just had more musicians oh if we could just have more money we could do more outreach and before you know it it's more and more and more and more and it begins to breed discontent amongst the people of god where we ought to be fully content with the now the hear and the presence of what god is doing in our midst because he's in our midst right we come to church to meet with him we we fellowship in our homes to meet with him when we fellowship with one another it's to meet with him we're meeting with god amen oh so we have this in the natural we have these things where we get in a place of discontentment and we let them float into our spiritual lives we are foolish that way as natural creatures but let us not be foolish that way as spiritual christians jesus you know it's good in our lives now i want to point this a balance it's good to want to strive you know you you want to do well in school okay and sometimes you get a bad mark on your examination or you get a on your job you get a a review that's not so good and you're a little bit discontent about what happened those things in the natural are good they push you forward and those are like trials and tests don't be discontented in what god gives you be happy in what god gives you it might be for your edification for your building up for you to become a greater son and daughter of god which he intended so there is a balance in all things but yet we are not allow satan to breed in our minds with discontentment i want you to notice that we are we are this being that's got a mind a body all right a spirit and a soul and on the inside of the inside is where god lives and that is the purity of god now we have to put our our spirit and our soul into subjection to god's word when we do that then satan can't come in and disrupt disrupt disrupt us with these discontentments that tried to easily beset us how many has ever heard of the word envy uh envy breeds discontentment the inability to rejoice at the success of others you know many times we look at somebody gets something bigger better shinier and we look and we say oh i wish i had that and we may not be silly enough to say that with our with our natural voices right but the inside goes man i really wish but you should be on the other hand thanking god for the blessings that's bestowed upon your friend your brother your sister in christ jesus you should be thank you lord that my brother is succeeding and now we know that natural blessings has nothing to do with spiritual blessings but thank you lord that you're you're blessing him that you're looking after him that brings joy in your life right uncontrollable ambition it's a buster it destroys you know a critical spirit oh my okay none of us ever had a critical spirit right critical spirit the tendency to make negative or hurtful are cutting remarks about others these things destroy our happiness in the lord you know if you have a concern i've had many concerns i've had critical thoughts come through my mind but i don't we ought not to allow the dead off to roost in our minds you know what we do we take it to the lord we find our needs we say lord these are things are my concerns when you express them to the lord your situation changes complaining spirits you know the dispos uh disposition to make excuses and then to blame others or bad circumstances for your problem uh a lot of people don't want is this okay a lot of people friends they don't want to take ownership for their own troubles and their old problems it's always somebody else's problem so you come into church and you've got this big chip on your shoulder man and listen i'm preaching from experience i i i've had a hey i've had a chip on my shoulder before and god had to fix me real good and you come into church and you've got an issue right hey got a critical spirit on you and you got this complaining spirit on you and you sit down on the bench and you look over to somebody who is pure as nothing's ever they've never done nothing to you and they they're just completely whatever else but you know what it makes you miserable to see them so happy and you look at them from the corner of that seat and all of a sudden you begin to think of everything possible from the hairdo right down to the bottom of the shoes that wasn't clean and maybe their car wasn't even washed but you find something to complain about them to blame them for your own problem the problem is you now let me tell you a little story i like stories let me tell you the story there is a couple boys and they had a grandfather and they wanted to play a trick on granddad and he had this this this terrible mustache you know those ones that come up and curl at the ends and he had it all waxed up and these boys wanted to play a little trick on grandfather so what they did was they went to the fridge and and they had some old limburger cheese you know what it's just awful stinky stinky stuff how many has ever eaten lemon cheese do you like it you hated it god bless you it's awful it stinks it's awful okay blue cheese is almost there but it's terrible so they went and they just smeared it took it in their hands and they it was he sniffed he stuck it on his mustache like this you know and he began to wake up and smelling this off and ah stinks right so i like everybody does first thing today how come it stinks that's our first you know first resolve and oh he it went into the next room it stinks went to the next chip sticks he finally went outside and he smelled outside and before you know it the first thing that came in his mouth he says this whole world stinks but really it's him that stunk right and that's exactly our position when we have these critical these complaining spirits on us that that become we were just problem in ourselves but we want to make the world the problem and everything the church stinks the job stinks your family sticks you love your wife and she stings all right everything is awful well it's then for you to clue in hello maybe you got the problem maybe you need to get on your knees and ask the minister the pastor to come and pray with you and anoint you with oil to remove this spirit that's causing the joy to be waning out of your life angry outbursts how many's ever got angry oh my don't preach on anger brother steve that's so natural yes anger outbursts not only are they embarrassing but they take away the joy out of your life you know i witnessed one time when we all have problems but i witnessed one time a wonderful lovely sister and she must have had a lot of pressure she had a bunch of sisters and brothers over you know she just a little ass straw the last straw have you ever been the last draw and i've never seen this before and i've never seen it since but she was taking that hot potato out of the oven and something just was the last straw and that sister she took that potato like it was a baseball and she whipped it and it went sailing through the air and it it hit her it it hit her like in the backsplash of her thing and then you know now did that make her feel better likely not because we're all watching her do it and she probably felt inches high and very silly and hoping that no but we're all watching and you know what it didn't make her feel joyful now think about all the angry outbursts that you've had in your life not only is it the old man rising right because that's the old flesh we're supposed to take all of that and bury it and put a new mind on us the mind of christ the new attributes of christ so we're not making any excuses today for our tendencies of the old flesh i say today in the name of the lord bury those things put them six feet under and when the little hand comes up and tries to steal your joy bury that hand step it down do what you need to do because it cannot ride out of your life control yourself by the holy ghost which is in the soul in that place of your being oh friends we need the lord philippians chapter 4 verse 12 speaks like this in the in the niv it says like this i know what is to be in uh be needed i know what it is to have plenty i learned the secret of being content we need to learn we've had nothing and we've had a lot and that's what has spoken but we need to find the place of contentment now let me read from the prophet in his life story in 1953 he says happiness doesn't consist of how much of the world's goods you own but how contented you are with the portion that has been allotted to you that's why you can be happy for your neighbor that's why you don't have to be critical about the other person that's why you don't have to try to talk badly about something be happy with the portion god gave you just make yourself content as long as one thing that brings contentment and that alone is jesus christ so get to the foot of christ get to god's prayer into god's presence and find joy and happiness there forever and brother brown said in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says he promised us joy and happiness and contentment which is the earnest of our salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance oh but i'm not i just don't feel like it brother this chief i'm just not happy tonight is your night to get the joy of the holy ghost if you don't don't have it uh christ among the people that they see the christ is not subdued hanging in the building but he's living in being formed by the holy spirit so we're not just looking at a pillar of fire of of the brother branham had hanging over him but we're seeing that life amen amen and overcoming love that that destroys all these these things that try to hinder your life out of joy how about another one can we go through another one another one that busts the joy out of our lives is unresolved conflict wow unresolved joy it begins to evaporate it just goes away when we allow conflict between ourselves and other person to go on a little while a little while before you know it starts off a little something before you know it gets to be this great big thing i used to work in the hospital in the surgical department i was a operating room nurse you know there's a little there's a fella that developed a little skin cancer on his face and you know that little skin cancer thing on his face was just like in babe form you know and he could have come in and and this isn't the natural now he could have come in and we could have cut that thing off and sewed it up and chances are he probably nothing would ever happen to him but you know what happened he let it grow when british gold let it grow a little growth pretty soon it was so large that we had to take his entire face off and when he came to the place of time he could not see no more he couldn't speak anymore we had to do a skin flop that came all over his face like this all he could do is hear his ears but it all started out friends with one little bittle thing of skin cancer on his face he could have taken care of it but i want you to notice and that's the same in the spiritual we sometimes have these just little conflicts between husband and wife they just start off really small before you know it they grow and pretty far they grow and pretty soon they're way so big that it takes a lot of time and a lot of energy with the ministry trying to put the family back together again when you could take the solid truth of the word that says don't let your anger go down down don't have this anger let and let the sun go down upon it that's what i'm trying to say allow forgive one another don't go to bed angry okay and be honest about it you know give one another a hug and say i'm sorry for the way i treated you isn't that true come on for us married ones you know i at one time in our marriage you know we had a disagreement and i said to my wife and jokingly but it was nevertheless i was trying to make a point i said if i would agree with you both of us would be wrong that's not how you apologize okay don't go to bed with that kind of apology she's gonna be madder than a buzz saw in the morning and i like my age hard but i don't like them real hard see we got to love one another right right and that stumbles all the way in your work life and in your home life in your church life everything resolve the conflict that's in your life don't let someone's offenses come against you and let it occupy your mind i don't know about you but when when somebody's done me wrong or i'm holding an offense that i should not be holding and the lord is working on me but i want you to notice what happens i can't pray it's the first thing that happens i can't pray i get before the lord and i'm like lord and it's like no i just can't even do and then i get to the bible and i love reading and i love to study the god's word and i become more disciplined as my life is gone to read the word and of love but you know when i look at that it's just words and then everything starts to go falling down friends let's get to the point and let's not just let it occupy your mind if you're not letting it occupy in your mind you're just giving god the leftovers right we don't want to give god the leftovers we want to give god the first fruits of our lives so don't give god the leftovers cast that thing out make things right don't just wait till communion how many people they don't want to be embarrassed by the church and not come up that sunday evening you know to have communion so they waltz over to their family members say you know i'm i'm sorry now don't wait till then when the lord is calling and you know you weren't right yeah we're not silly people we know when we made a boo-boo we know when we cross the line god convicts us we have the holy ghost in our life god convicts us at the time of conviction go to that one and say look let's at least pray together and and establish ourselves around the word and say we're sorry to one another and then let's work together amen oh let's not allow these things to cloud our mind make the hebrews it says make every effort to live in peace with all men and be holy without holiness no one will see the lord can we understand that without holiness without godliness none of us are going to see the lord without a ref getting forgiveness without coming to the lord and between one another say father be between us and forgive us of our troubles we are not going to see the lord i see that too many times today unresolved conflict and you know what happens you're cheating yourself you're cheating yourself on what god has for us number three anybody know what it would be number three is unconfessed sin now friends we're children of god here filled with the holy ghost most of us i'm sure we're not talking about now sin that we remember sin is unbelief to god's word so when i talk about unconfessed sin i'm not talking about grossities i'm not talking about fornication and adultery because that should never be named even amongst us that's and theft and stealing all right and lustful living and all those things should not be named amongst us yes but when i'm talking to us about sin that robs our joy it's unconfessed sin that's doubt according to of doubting of the word of god so you know something when you have a doubt and when you have something in the way i don't know about you but guilt sets in you know you shouldn't have this right you should have faith to believe but i got this guilt and it becomes and it begins to grow faster and faster before you know it the guilt overwhelms you and your joy begins to wane off amen how many knows you've ever been been sick before and you know that god is your healer even a simple headache or if i've had a toothache and i'm like i know god's my healer and god can take care of this pain and i'll go the dentist and he'll get it sealed up and we'll be good but you know someone i i might find a little bit more doubt in there and i might find a little then i begin to think and you know what begins to happen to me as a christian i begin to get guilty well why don't i believe and why can't this happen and before you know it it over it consumes us so let me can i give you another example this is a little bit closer closer to home to me i i have a son he's 21 years old he's a wonderful christian fella loves the lord and loves to sing and very gifted young man but the devil has come against him and he he has in his body something we call spontaneous pneumothorax and as he was growing his lung would separate from and would make a little hole and his lung would collapse and it would cost he's had five surgeries on uh two uh two and three so two on one side and three on the other and each time they'll take out a piece of his lung and it's just a big surgery and so forth and you know what you know all of a sudden i believe for without a shadow of a doubt that the lords are healing but after his lung had collapsed 15 times and five surgeries i got a little bit weak now i'm preaching for my heart i got to this place where lord i i know you are our healer your word says but i i'm not seeing this and i'm praying and i'm calling out to you and that's not lord what's happen you know what happened to me i started feeling guilty guilt came him out and brothers would ask me you know hey brother steve how's your son doing and usually i would testify god is good god is wonderful these are overcome here but you know what happened to me i would just say he's fine he's fine he's fine and you know why because this guilt began to push over in my life until i got a revelation it didn't matter whether god would allow my son to be taken from me through death or he would have life god is still stays and remains the same when i got that revelation then all of a sudden all that guilt was gone all that what i would like to say unconfessed sin that all that that disbelieve of god's word it was taken from me all of a sudden then once it was gone for me i now could once again have the joy of the word in my life because now it made no difference it has no bearing upon who i am or what it is yes it's my son yes i love him but he giveth and he taketh away so blessed be the name of the lord and inside of that i once again found joy amen but if i would keep on in the path i was if i would keep in this this place of unconfessed unbelief you know where we'd be today in a very bad spot but thanks be to god by the holy spirit that he breaks this thing and he can break it in your life now i'm i spoke very personally to you but i want you to know if you're going through something don't let this unconfessed unbelief this unconfessed sin we're not talking about lust now we're talking about things that come against the believer that cause us not to live victorious lives so some things come against you friends just call unto god and say lord remove this thing out of my life brother braham says now he says now you remember if you've got unconfessed sin in your heart i'm placing it back on your lap worse sorry yeah worse then this will come upon you if you've got unconfessed sin step out of the prayer line he says and make it right before god so here we are we've got to confess it say lord i've been foolish i got this deal going on it's not of you forgive me brother brown says step on the line and make it right with god and then come back in the prayer line and guess what your prayers will be answered so i'm challenging you here tonight amen you may have had transgressions but they are forgiven those sins are covered under the blessed blood of jesus christ no matter how big no matter how small whatever it be confess your sin unto god and believe me friends he'll come on the scene for us amen and your joy will be restored david said rejoice in the lord and be glad you righteous sing all of you who's who are upright in heart amen i think i heard some of that singing today those that are operating heart that are allowing god to take full control in their lives david said you know he was in a real bad spot kind of like some of us are sometimes he said cleanse me with his sip and i will be clean and wash me and i'll be whiter than snow let me hear joy and gladness let let the bones you have crushed rejoice amen these are our prayers oh we want joy builders in our lives now we talk now just about ones that bust us up and cause us problems well friends there are things in our life that cause us to have more joy so one of those things is you got to recognize that god is the joy-giver amen the joy of all joy you've got to delight in the lord you've got to speak of the lord you've got to praise of the lord you've got to come with thanksgiving rejoice in his works you have a job to do you come before the lord and rejoice you see something even a little bit little little in your life rejoice about it give god thank you in life the more you speak about it the more you praise about it the more the more joy overcoming joy comes in your life remember that you are his workmanship created in his image isaiah 65 verse 18 and 19 says be glad and rejoice forever in what i have created for i will create jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy i will rejoice over jerusalem and make a delight in my people he remember you were created for his delight confess it say lord i be created for your joy use me lord for your honor for your glory i'm gonna rejoice in you because joy is one of your characteristics and i want to reflect all of your characteristics you need to rehearse god's attribute of worship in your life you want more joy you've got to worship over the steve all my days this day you know i got i worship in church no no there's other times to worship there's other times to pray there's other times to get involved you know brother brandon i love it when he says you know i was working and and he says i had to i got away from the workmen and i went down by the water's edge and i began to fellowship with the lord and over lunch and man i just i didn't want to leave his presence but i had to go back to work so off he went back to work and he worked and he said i can hardly wait to get back and worship with god see that's our joy that's our desire that that's our worship we we got to completely surrender ourselves in such a way that our entire life is worship amen some of us are singers yeah but that not all of us are singers but some of us are prayers some are real warriors in prayer some are testifiers it's worship some of us you know you know we ought to pray without ceasing well everybody pray some people pray with every opportunity stop at a red light and they pray they drive down the road they're standing at the bank they pray they look for every opportunity they're standing for the coffee to work to to be to be made they pray why is it because they're worshiping you've got to keep over you know angels of heaven they worship they're not just robots some people think wow holy holy holy only know this holy holy is the lord they're not robots they worship him gladly they worship with all their being now friends we are made in the image of god oh the angels they all looked at us and they think my those are redeemed creatures they're there to watch after us and look after us we are we are there to be the lamb's wife what a position you hold we're not machines we worship him it's spirit and truth we give ourselves we come to the building tonight we wear a ship amen right well i'm not going to worship because nobody else worship you know what it's an individual walk between you and god more than ever in this last little bit i realized when i go to church wherever i am it's not about other people how many is looking for a revival what were promised a bride's revival but guess where the revival is it's an individual people amen we're not gathering the the football stadiums anymore if you obviously notice there's not this great big gathering of all the people that want to hear the message any longer there's a revival and that's in the individual lives the revival starts with you and i begin to notice when i begin to praise god for the individual walk not for my wife's walk not for my children my children not for me it's god has no grandchildren we're worshiping god we receive something special at the moment for the moment for ourselves and that's how we ought to come to church we walk in those doors through those wise nice doors with those brass knobs we pull them open and we say lord i'm here to worship amen okay now listen we're worshiping him he's not worshiping us a lot of us stand there and say okay put on a show up for us god we want to see something happen let the preacher preach us happy today lord you gave no no we're it's we're to worship him we're here to fellowship here with him that is what god has for us so we need to rehearse it we need to come before him joy comes by the attitude of joy you are a creator of your own atmosphere wherever you are in whatever situation i've been in the most awfulest seems in my own little puny life situation i've been since atmospheres i'm thinking oh man how can i ever possible have a good attitude here but you know something with that bubbling inside of me like i said of the stream on the inside you could be in the worst place i'm talking about like a situation like at work when everybody likes you you know it makes no difference you still are representing christ in such a way that the attitude of joy comes out of your life rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice real joy real character okay i'm closing right now right away but real character rejoice in that real character of christ jesus worship him with all your heart my last note to reinstating your joy is this how many has ever witnessed to somebody and as you're witnessing to them you don't even know where the words come from right and god begins to use you and things that were in the backward parts of your mind come forward and you're telling them all about the wonderfulness of god amen then you're finished you're witnessing they go their way now do you remember the joy that's right that's within your being i'm not just saying it's such a joy and i go home and i say to my wife you know i met this person i started telling her all about it and that whole evening even sometimes a whole week as i testify in church and everywhere i go i'm telling everybody about what god has done it through my life a witness [Music] you want to have your joy come out of you start witnessing oh brother steve we're just looking for that last soul it's gleaning time i hear this whole time it's cleaning time yes it's cleaning time but i want you to notice boa has always dropped a few grains on the ground okay during the and it sustained their lives and this long this journey of cleaning because we use those words cleaning time in the sustaining time of gleaning time god allows little ones yet to be saved even here in saint john newfoundland praise the lord there is still someone there out there on this mighty rock there's somebody that needs the gospel amen they may be stuck in some denomination somewhere or they might be on a street corner someplace or their life might be so destroyed with drugs friends there's still somebody out there that needs the gospel amen so don't just take all the stored food that you've got and just keep it to yourself share it go to your places and say this is what god has done this is how my candle got lit this is why god the joy of the lord is my strength in this hurting world that we knew people need love people need to be shown truth and there are some still that can be picked and plucked off the ground for the kingdom of god and just who knows when that last seed is going to come in and when it is friends if it happens here in newfoundland me and bc all the way on the other side it seems like the world will be fantastic rejoicing happy because we can all leave [Music] together the dead in christ shall rise amen and those that you know will be called and we'll go together to meet our lord in the air but somebody's got to do the work can i challenge you this evening yeah hey ben don't just leave it to our brother gerald and her brother jonathan sheep reproduce sheep right shepherds feed sheep but sheep go and witness joyfully to reproduce fruits unto the lord amen so we're rejoicing in the lord let's stay in the word of god let's recognize in our lives that it's a necessity for ourselves to have joy because it's strength we can't battle the devil without strength amen if we're weak we need to bind together and send the devil to flee we need one another we can't have critical spirits we can't have these angers we can't have all these things that come to the church no we cannot allow it no longer satan you come the last mile and we may be weak christians but we say that the prophet said boo devil get out of here right we take back what is ours and what is ours his righteousness peace and joy amen where in the holy ghost and friends he's here this evening god himself the life of god zoe life is amongst us let's take back with ours the joy of the lord let's close our eyes hallelujah father oh praise the lord i spoke lord this evening we desire more joy lord we're believers here i look around the room today and lord i believe the believers here have your nature your life inside of them they have your word sometimes the enemy comes by and cools us off a little we live in this leia see a word when we're not part of it no i refuse to be part of it we're called out of this leosia world but father sometimes we get distracted and we get influenced by things that's so easily beset then we get cooled off and the first thing that begins to leave our lives is the joy of serving you so i want to ask the people tonight lord if you would speak to their hearts just now i would like to ask them if there's anyone here today that just needs a special touch for god to come in and restore the joy in their heart maybe something i've said touched their lives something that they've maybe got a little dote or something that's in there that shouldn't be there i pray father that they would just acknowledge it before you today amen father now that we've recognized lord that those things are in our way i pray lord now that we begin to speak to you and talk to you about it for just a moment lord i could say a lot of things and i can pray and but unless oh god they find their position in you and find their way back to you lord i can say a million words but it'll never help they have to come before you say lord forgive me so i'd like to leave this opportunity just now lord i'd like to encourage you saints one to another don't worry about the next person that's next to you this might be like time like no other but i wonder if you could take a moment and just begin to pray individually don't think about the next person next to you just pray you have an issue in your life you know maybe you had a fight or something with your husband your wife or your children you saw that wasn't right and you want to say lord forgive me i want joy maybe you had adults somewhere like brother steve i i confessed to you i told you how i felt but i thank god for restoring joy in my life when it was very dark why don't you just give it to him just just call upon his neck don't be shy yes gracious you're your father and we thank you god hallelujah to your name you hear the voice of these your children this is this is your bride lord it's the first meeting and i just felt in my heart to speak oh god on something that would bring them to a place to have joy restored in their hearts i i don't know situation i have no idea what's what what the church needs lord but you do i just spoke from my heart today so if there's something lord that i spoke that touched people's hearts today would they rejoice over it lord and father may

brother for tomorrow right that's okay you can take it right amen so remember brother steve and remember also the needs were mentioned already earlier and of course those that are sick and need a touch from the lord tonight and may god just be with us all tomorrow bless our fellowship tomorrow in the various places and just come expecting tomorrow night amen i'm greedy i want more every time i

[Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] praise the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord just keep playing just to say what struck me about this song is that if you look at the three the three verses together my joy uh my sorry my peace my joy and my love we're that's god giving that to us he said i'll be with you and i'll be in you right so god is god is in his people he's given us that peace and he's given us that joy he was preached about tonight and he's given us that love so because god is in all of us shouldn't we be showing all those three to each other right that's what the body of christ does right that's what believers do so there's no room for hurt just there'll be that there'll be mistakes and all of that sort of thing but there's a love there's a joy and there's a peace that it that expresses itself through through that true forgiveness by the holy ghost in all of us right so i just i just wanted to focus on that for a second this is god giving of himself to each and every one of us it's that peace that love and that joy so let's just sing that love the third verse and brother josh can close in prayer but i just wanted to point that out it's sometimes we just sing it because it's nice words and brother brandon said that at one point he said that we don't have this problem here by the grace of god but he said he said people in the church that he said they sing and they worship and they jump and they dance and they shout and they do all that stuff and he said when the music stops that stops but that's just a precursor that's just a preliminary to the word going forth where where the response is greater right because there's god speaking to our hearts right and he's increasing our faith and he's he's given us what he knows we have need of through the ministry you know we're very privileged people we just need to realize it sometimes amen let's just sing it and brother joshua calls right my [Music] i life unto you [Music] is [Music] let's just sing my joy hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] thank you heavenly father lord we are so glad and so thankful for the joy and peace lord that you've given unto us father something lord that satan cannot take away from us thank you lord jesus christ for your grace and love and for the words that we've heard this evening father surely within us father god something is bubbling up lord i pray lord jesus that we would continue to feed on that word law that you would restore the joy lord father of thy salvation father god thank you lord jesus christ for this time in your presence so glad father god and thankful for our brother i
