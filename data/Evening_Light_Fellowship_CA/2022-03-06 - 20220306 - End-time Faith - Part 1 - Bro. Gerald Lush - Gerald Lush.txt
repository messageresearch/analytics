but alive to god amen alive to jesus sensitive to jesus amen praise the name of the lord so grace oh god that we would have that ah oh yes holy ghost faith that we would have that real genuine word faith amen father not just the letter of the word but the spiritual revelation amen so that it is not me not my brother not my sisters that are living but it's jesus living in us oh what a tremendous testimony what a tremendous faith lord that we have jesus living in us that we have jesus using our thoughts our minds our motives objectives amen it is jesus using our entire beings hallelujah lord that you would live in us that you would manifest yourself in us as you did in the not yet but yet just consider his reaction yeah the time of the figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever amen and his disciples heard it well it wasn't the time but he rebuked and cursed the tree amen why he was there amen he was god he made the tree yeah grace and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves yeah and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and and he taught saying unto them it is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer amen but ye have made it a den of thieves amen so god elvis that we're going to amen keep it the way that god ordained it to be amen amen spiritual praise the lord and the scribes and the chief priests urge it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots amazing and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curseth is withered away god help us amen speak the word god help us whatever your need is speak the word praise the name of the lord if it's with the glory of god speak the word yeah amen with faith oh my god help us to have that faith god elvis to believe amen praise the name of the lord we believe not just believe in god that we believe god amen so the grace of god be with us amen that we have the faith that pleases god because without faith it is impossible to please him amen and i want to talk to you about this morning concerning that faith what kind of faith is he looking for what kind of faith should we have amen even in coming into this service amen to hear the word of god amen we're hearing the word what for to increase our faith amen because faith comes by hearing the word amen oh my lord i pray grace that we'll we'll have this revelation god is judging us by faith amen god's looking for faith in you faith in me amen because that's what brings god on the scene hallelujah that's what puts god into action is faith praise the lord do you believe me do you trust me amen so god help us amen we're not looking for this now looking for that oh here we come to hear this come to hear that amen we come amen to strengthen our faith amen because faith comes again by hearing the word and the more word we hear the greater faith the more word we hear the stronger our faith amen amen amen god help us brother sister to know and to believe that faith is just not oh i believe in god so does the devil amen uh and i believe this and i believe that so does the devil amen well brother we've got to have something out of our hearts amen really truly honestly sincerely amen in our relationship with god amen a true relationship with god amen and it says in verse 22 and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god or the faith of god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou casted of the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass amen he shall have whatsoever he saith amen but this is absolute faith this is perfect faith amen we believe we believe god we believe the will of god we believe the word of god we believe we are in relationship with god oh yes amen i know him and oh thank god he knows me well that's important does he know you amen because there are those that came to him two thousand years ago who are you he didn't know them amen but brother i pray the grace of god we know him and that he knows us amen god elvis that he's got a relationship with us by grace of god amen and again verse 23 said for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart amen not your head your heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass amen he shall have whatsoever he saith amen amen just think the fig tree that jesus cursed it did it amen it was destroyed the life was gone out of it even though amen if the straight tree wanted to argue and could argue it could say well i'm not in that season yet i'm not in that time yet oh yeah because it says right there it wasn't the time for the figs amen but jesus cursed it amen why amen just think of the atmosphere that he would create amen think that all creation should have recognized him who he was amen and honored him who he was brother he required that of a fig tree what does it require of you and me amen so i pray that oh brother it is a lesson right here it's a revelation right here for you and me to be sincere amen to be up and and respond amen to the word to respond to jesus respond to amen to his his thoughts his motives his objectives his attitude his spirit his actions and reactions respond amen reflecting jesus amen brother if you curse the tree you'll cur oh yes most definitely is by the word we are justified oh yeah and by the word we're condemned the bible says that that's right yeah amen so the grace of god we believe we believe amen and we believe with a complete belief amen amen no question no doubt because we believe god amen amen the lord help us is my prayer amen but whether it's not religion it's not not just doctrines and theology amen no it is christ amen amen it is christ in me therefore i say unto you verse 24 what things whoever ye desire when ye pray oh my this is tremendous believe that you receive them and ye shall have them brother what a promise what love that god got for you and me amen that he would give us such a promise amen whatever you believe that's it i'll do it amen by the grace of god praise the lord but he said again verse 25 when you stand praying forgive me see we've got to have a right attitude and we've got to have a right spirit almost definitely amen brother i thank god that he had that right attitude right motivate objection towards you and me amen and now he's looking for the same thing in you toward brothers and sisters toward family and friends and neighbors amen keep your spirit right and keep your attitude right amen because he said when you stand praying forgive you're not here to condemn he's forgiving us we're forgiving you or rather we're forgiving others oh yeah lord at many a time i've seen this and seen this and i said lord there's grace for me it's grace for that one oh yeah grace there's grace for that that that woman is grace for that man oh yes most definitely amen don't think oh no condemned condemned no remember again whether god had to rebuke the prophet amen because looking at this person going down there and the way they were dressed and how they were doing this and that and and the and the lord said don't you do that he said because he said some of them are my children amen as i say they're not bright but i'll tell you this they're going to be outside the city i pray the grace of god amen god help us to keep our attitude right our spirit is right amen brother create grace for us lord i pray grace for that brother i pray grace for that sister amen whom they are oh well they they're they sir that brother you leave that with god amen we're going to call them to the word by the grace of god amen so he said when you stand praying forgive and if you have ought against any and it says that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses amen verse 26 but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses god bless this word you may be seated this is a tremendous testimony father brother but i'll tell you this if we have the faith that pleases god amen we have that attitude amen we have the faith that pleases god we have a forgiving spirit for others amen because brothers we're thankful for what god has done for us and we're praying praying that god do it for that person that brother that sister amen amen it might be family might be friends might be neighbors we leave it with god oh we're going to judge them we'll judge them later oh yeah but we leave it with the lord we'll judge them in another dimension by the grace of god so god help us brother say with the word and have the faith that comes by hearing the word amen faith oh it's a revelation oh brothers is greater than that because i believe that let me share some of this thought with you when it comes to faith oh it's a revelation all right oh yeah oh it's a revelation of the word what yeah but it's a revelation that controls it's a revelation that controls your thoughts it's a revelation that controls your words it's a revelation that controls your deeds amen it's basically it's a revelation that's controlling your actions and your reactions amen if you got that true genuine faith that pleases god you got that amen it's a faith that you have has got these characteristics the faith that you have has got you got these addi this attitude oh yes my brother because that faith is not there just to look down at somebody and condemn somebody no there goes you but for the grace of god amen and while we're here i believe it again pray we're praying grace to that brother grace to that sister great it might be a family might be friends might be neighbors we don't know amen but we're not there to condemn it no no oh well our life is going to judge them oh yes it will but you got me remember you've got to go forward with the right attitude too amen amen because god god's going to show again show that in in glory and say he required this required that because this person never had a right attitude that would never had a right attitude and oh lord what do you mean there are those that were professionally believers they never had a good attitude and j and he i trust he'd be able to ring you up on the screen amen and show them you and say well there's my attitude in them amen they that brother that sister they had a good attitude they were right there to help you amen there were there to be witnesses to you amen amen by the grace of god and for the glory of god amen again as i said before when we had those storms in there one time and brother david was out helping neighbors and he was there with us and shoveling and there's no air snow there and they noticed that there was no snow in my driveway oh he says he must he must be a preacher they didn't know that brother david said you're right he is oh is that right he was just joking oh yeah but again it struck him that i was the pastor oh he said i didn't know that amen but brother david was driving along to him amen but again i i just leave that with the lord because maybe the lord permitted it that way amen so that it will bring up the witness that brother david was going to be amen to that gentleman so the grace of god be with us brother amen to believe oh my lord elves have faith faith that pleases god is a faith that believes god amen that faith that that that believes that god is in control of your thoughts god's control of your words and god is in control of your deeds amen brother i tell you this is the only way amen they can be said that it's not me lives it's christ living in me amen and if christ is living in you christ living in me whether it's whether in your home in your church or at your job brother whatever it is it will con there he's going to control your thoughts your words and your dates and it's not you that lives is christ living in you amen brother and again oh my lord help us to be spiritual not carnal and again as when i was working in the department stores one time and there was a certain issue came up and they were going around looking for this looking for that where is it where is this where is that and i remember that that one time one of the management came to where i was in in in that vehicle in that store there and i was sort of a management of a certain number of departments and he said mr gosh he said where is this where is that i said don't worry i said god knows where it is and i say i said you you you'll lead us to it oh they took it lately and i said don't worry about it move on okay and so just not just a few minutes after that they found it why i said right there oh he said there yeah check there and they said oh he said that's right you're right i said i told you i said lord the lord will find it amen because amen because i wanted to be a witness not from not for me but for god amen let them know that god was alive god was living god was not dead amen praise the name of the lord and he was living with me living in me amen and amen who's using me to be a witness there witness there even in the stores that i worked in oh yeah oh yeah and they knew it they knew it they said oh yeah we know you're a christian i said okay no that's grace of god i said he said amen and and then after that and number of times anything going on they would come and ask well what do you think of this what do you feel by this amen why because they sense that i was christian i was giving preeminence to god amen even in my job by the grace of almighty god amen so what about you what sort of testimony are you giving what sort of witness are you giving amen are you just doing it as an unbeliever are you just doing it as a sinner are you are you doing it as a christian brother sister once once you come into a relationship with god into a relationship with christ amen brother i tell you this you're going to go forth revealing christ amen in your job oh yeah that doesn't mean you have to be over you've got to be telling them give be a witness to them tell them about jesus telling me no no you've got to live it amen it's not telling about jesus amen because praise the lord it is you christ is in you amen by the grace of almighty god and there are those that think of well maybe i got to tell them of jesus i got to be a witness for this a witness for that amen no no you've got to go forth and live the life of the christian amen go for reflecting the attitude of jesus the thoughts of jesus and the words of jesus and and the deeds of jesus the way jesus would do it amen so and again there are those that think well i just got to be talking about jesus no you don't you got to live jesus amen he's not talking to you you can talk him but what about walking amen and the prophet probably doesn't i like the fact that you've got to walk jesus you're going to walk your christian life amen and it's not talking it it's walking it and amen and they'll see you acting this way they'll see you reacting this way that way they'll know what that person is different what makes them different amen oh yeah well they they as i said in where i worked there at those times and they go ask somebody else oh why is he so different well he's a christian he's a christian oh he's a christian they've wondered that why because they met many christians that weren't like it they met many so-called christians amen that didn't reflect jesus that way amen they're religious but not spiritual amen they're reflecting you know doctrines and theology reflecting this church and that church amen but that many is reflecting jesus not the bible believers association but jesus amen brother we're here to worship jesus we're here not to promote the bible believers association we're not here to promote this church or that church amen we're here to promote jesus amen praise the name of the lord brother all down through right from the beginning whether there is abel brother in genesis right down through to the end time believers brother what are we reflecting jesus by the grace of almighty god brother even in revelations oh my praise the lord the the emphasis is on jesus the emphasis is on god the emphasis on what god has done what god is doing amen and and and the effect that he's having in you and in me amen as he said right there in the book of revelation this is amazing he was testifying these things say surely i come quickly amen jesus and it says even so come lord jesus amen praise the name of the lord brother it begins with god giving the giving premise of god and it ends with god because why because brother in genesis man comes from eternity into time amen and now in revelation we're going from time back into eternity praise the name of the lord hallelujah because again this is where we come from no manners has ended up but he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven and brother he came down to redeem those others who are in heaven that your your theophanies are there amen you're amen yes your theologies are in heaven he came down to redeem every one of us amen so we're going to enter into a oneness with our theophany into a glorified condition amen exactly like jesus did amen he laid the body down he raised it up in a glorified condition amen and he said oh yeah he said and he ascended and we he promised the same thing to you and me praise the name of the lord hallelujah and brother again not just a spiritual body but a real real real body oh yeah because when he appeared to the disciples and oh it's jesus yes he said and and of course judas or the other brother didn't believe it jesus jesus yes he said touch touch my hands the wounds in his hand touch my side where they put the sword in his side and so on and oh and he rolls up praise the name of the lord amen so brother sister god of us to have faith god help us to believe brother god he required it then if there's anything jesus was looking for when he came back from the dead it was faith brother it was faith before he went faith after he come back amen and his faith brother that he's looking for now but it's a real genuine holy ghost faith amen oh well and too often there's too many believers now they think oh the what is faith oh it's a revelation a revelation oh yeah god revealed this to us god revealed that to us and and that's what we believe that so that's our faith yeah but no it's it's life no no it's more than just revealing the word it's it's the person of the word amen amen hallelujah because in the beginning was the word where with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen so brother that's the faith that god is looking for in you and me the faith amen that is the word made flesh oh yeah not not thoughts in your head or well i i believe this doctrine i believe this i believe that that's your faith that's my faith no god's looking for faith in the heart that controls your thoughts your words and your deeds amen god's looking for the faith on the inside of the inside brother that's going to reflect in you the absolute character of jesus christ amen you go forth revealing christ to the world in the life you live in your attitude in your words in your deeds and your thoughts amen you may not say oh jesus lord jesus i want to tell you about jesus tell me jesus no you're going to show them jesus amen oh yes you can tell them about it mean nothing why because they don't see it in you amen but he wants to come in you and reflect his nature and his life in you to prove he's not dead he's alive amen he's not dead he's the lord and he come back and he's he's sharing that life with you he's sharing that character with you amen he's revealing to the world amen his character through you and through me what a testimony i pray the grace of god to help us amen brother are you a real true sincere amen revelation of jesus to the world do you are you are you going out in that world and you're living like jesus and you're acting like jesus you're talking like jesus oh god help us there's a lot of believers brother i tell you this they're not living like jesus they're not talking like jesus amen they don't act like jesus amen oh yes we're believers oh yeah the sisters believe this and they you know they wear they dress this way and they have long hair and so on the brother takes more than that what is the life that produced it amen amen what is the anointing that produces it why are you doing it because why by the letter of the word by the spiritual revelation amen that it was a conviction in your heart amen amen you're just not going by the letter of the word you're not going by all this or that because i would a preacher so hard when he preaches so i gotta i gotta line up with this line with it know if it's if you're a christian you got the holy ghost in you it's christ in you and and he's he's the one that's convicting you and he wants you to do this he wants you to do that you're going you're going to just just do it you won't question it amen you just make sure if it's the word no worries amen i don't care you know what my family thinks about my friends think my neighbors think no no it's jesus praise the lord hallelujah oh yes most definitely just too often you know with people there's believers that allow family or friends or neighbors to influence what they do and what they don't do you know and they're they're afraid to do this and no no we don't want to do this to want to know we might leave this impression well brother just go and live the life and you'll leave the right impression amen you believe amen have the right attitude and the right spirit amen by the holy ghost again again proving that it's not me living this christ living in me and it's christ's in you amen not just here in the church but brother out there outside the church is still christ christ in us here christ in us out there christ is in our homes christ in us and are in our jobs amen brother in in in fellowshipping with family friends or neighbors amen it's still christ amen jesus wasn't going to be one thing to this one another thing to that one amen what he was to that one he was to them he was the word he was the word he was the word amen his attitude is spirit his motives objectives was the same amen what they saw this one scene well this one's seen they saw jesus who is he always he's to a lot of the people back in that day no doubt jesus well he's he's he's really religious no he was spiritual but if the colonel might think he's just religious no no but there are those that would recognize his spirituality he was spiritual with a right motive right objective amen he had right thoughts right words his action was right his reaction was right amen amen and brother is not just put on by religion just come out of his heart if his religion comes out of your head amen but it amen but if it's spiritual coming out of your heart brother you don't have to force it you don't have to say i got to do this no no no you just it's just nate not your nature now as i said when you're born naturally you go and do this gluten do that why because you're got the nature of your mother your father your grandmother grandfather all done through the ages god the nature of that person yeah but when you're born again you got a new nature and it controls from the heart not the head amen and brother branham one time when they brought a young boy or or child into the prayer line and they were wondering about this wondering about this this problem with the job this problem and the father god just stood there oh he said i see he said this is not you referring to her the mother or the father no no he said this came from grandparents and he went back he said it's the grandparents and he told who it was and so on and he said they passed that on the way down and she and i think she was a young girl or young boy and they said they got it amen it was another spirit influencing them amen and the prophet said that's okay he said we're going to pray and the lord is going to take it away amen so he prayed amen and the nature of god the nature of jesus overtook amen and did away with the old nature of the flesh amen praise the lord and bothered by the grace of god when we're born again we're not being lit we're not living by this we're living by the heart now it's amazing but it's a miracle it is a miracle amen again that's what you can say it's not me that lives anymore it's jesus living in me amen we are spiritual by the grace of almighty god i or what why do you do this why do you do that well just by nature what it's not your nature your mother wouldn't do it that way your father or your grandparents no what do you mean your nature i got the nature of jesus oh yes that is this you are they would again some would say oh you are religious no more spiritual please make sure you're spiritual not religious amen because religion is in the head spiritual is in the heart amen oh it's just amen it just comes out of the heart hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen brother it's hard to explain sometimes yes but that's the way god moves you can't explain god experience god reflect god but you can't explain it no no no not by any means but it's why he kept saying when he would say this he said believeth thou this not do you understand it do you believe it amen even when when they were saying that lazarus was dead and he was buried and he was going to wait so many years for the resurrection he said i am the resurrection believers thou this that's tremendous why because they think the resurrection is going to be some experience up the road he was and is the resurrection amen and if you if he is in you you are the resurrection and the rapture that's right by the grace of god oh god help us amen to make sure make our calling election sure that we are in such a relationship with our lord jesus christ that we have the faith that jesus had that we're manifesting the faith that jesus manifested amen the faith that controlled jesus govern jesus christ amen thought word and day is now the faith that controls you and me amen praise the name of the lord he come down knowing where he come from and he did did what god wanted what he was supposed to do according to the word and went back amen that's right praise the lord where where is where is he where's jesus now well the body that he was in the prophecy is in glory he said he what did he do he said he laid his life down picked it up again he said he ascended up in that body and he said what did he do with that body he said he went and he put the bot that body he said by the throne by the throne of god as a testimony the price has been paid amen and he said then he said the life of that body come back down in the holy ghost to you and me amen what an explanation praise the name of the lord we to for one time that's why people believe do even now believe in a trinity you know because they believe that this person did this this person did that that person is here that bird is there the other person is up there and so on no no he just came down in that body god amen he did what he wanted to do in that body amen to redeem us amen and not only to conquer the conqueror seeing conquer death hell and the grave amen conquered death and he ascended up and the prophet said he put that body there and he's standing there before the throne he said but there's no life in it he says the life is down here the life is in you the life is in me praise the lord the baptism of the holy ghost amen what for he's here to share that life he paid the price for our sins amen praise the lord so that we could have that life thank god hallelujah do we do you have that faith and again it's amazing oh because i just wanted to talk about faith do what faith do you have is it the faith that they got out there in other churches denominations or or evangelical groups the or the faith that there's believing god for this we have faith of believing god for that but what do you have the faith that makes you god makes you the word amen that the word is made flesh in you amen not faith or just be just too many or faith is is believing in god or believing god yeah i believe this and i believe that that's the faith i have i got faith i believe you do but do you believe are you believing in your but too often they're believing in their head but they're not believing in the heart and there there's many so-called message believers they're believing in their heads but not in their heart brother just to share this with you to it the word was made flesh and was crucified i gotta share with you the word is me is made flesh today and is being crucified i don't know if you've seen it or noticed it online there's many i think it's youtube i think and you go in there and there's many uh a link and there's even the many a link about william branham and just recently i noticed that there was many a negative link regarding william branham amen oh yeah they're trying to highlight the fact that oh yeah but what he's preaching what he's teaching this is no it's not scripture and it's just this it's just this it's just this and it's amazing i said lord i said this indeed is the crucifixion of the word that's right oh yeah and they're just disagreeing with what brother brown did and how brother brown did it and so on and his spirit and his attitude and so on and they felt that he that he deliberately tried to deceive the people and oh yeah they're leaving that impression i said this is amazing so brother what where are we the crucifixion of the word yeah the power of god did i like the fact that that their their judas tyrion or pretended brothers he said in the message and they're there to betray the word oh yeah they'll take this but not this they'll take that but not that oh yeah they'll add a word take away a word in the message yes in the message so we better make our calling election sure stay with the word that's right amen so i'm sure again i don't know if anybody else has noticed it but i have maybe the lord just let me see it for a reason to share it with you amen the crucifixion of the word and god he said again the prophetess say he said god has allowed he said judasitarians he said pretended brothers to be a part of us what for he said to betray the word betray the message and they are so god help us we're in that hour stay with the word amen make sure you're with the word make sure the word is in you and you're in the word yes sir make sure amen that amen what god is doing he's doing it in you and me that you believe amen with a complete belief and you have no room for questions or doubt but brother now there's coming up a lot of questions and a lot of doubt regarding the message and regarding william branham that's right amen god help us now we're going to go for god help us amen to go forth as true genuine believers true and sincere believers amen that we love the lord we love his word and we lord we don't want to reflect ourselves we want to reflect you we don't want to live for ourselves we want to live for you amen we don't want to show the world who we are who comes to physically oh i'm this and i'm that no we want to show the world jesus jesus yes sir amen amen go forth whether you're again in your home in your job among family or friends or neighbors that you're going to have the attitude of jesus reflect jesus they're going to see jesus amen in you by the grace of god spiritual not religious amen they're going to know they're going to see the difference so grace of god brother sister this oh i pray the conviction of the holy ghost in your heart amen to get you to line up the way that god wants you to line up with his will and his word don't go there with still yielding to some of the old nature you got here no no that the holy ghost control i'm a new creature in christ amen why because we have the true real genuine faith that pleases god without faith it is impossible to please him and brother not just any faith it's got to be a spiritual holy ghost faith in the word people got faith when it comes to the letter of the word but do they have the faith of the spiritual revelation of the word in their hearts in their souls god help us are you jesus are you going to live the life of jesus today did you live the life of jesus yesterday when you walk in the morning you walk with jesus nature when you went to sleep with jesus nature god help us there's too many still got the old nature the old nature's in control yeah oh i've been born again yeah the only evidence that they can give you they're being born again because maybe they changed churches or or now they were believing this but now they're believing that no brother you're gonna you're gonna live a greater life by the grace of god faith believes god not just believing in god faith believes what god has said amen the bible does exhort except you believe you shall all likewise perish but believing in your heart just too many believing in their heads as i've said i've experienced that over the years in fellowshipping with so many believers oh my whether it's here newfoundland canada united states oh my lord they don't have that right spirit they don't have that right attitude they're not really true believers you know god help us again faith believes god not just believing in god believes god believes the word of god amen and faith trusts god amen amen that's right sister faith trusts god not what you're not you're not trying to figure this out and figure that out you just take god at his word amen you've got christ in you the hope of glory you just follow his leadership amen and not that we we want to understand or need to understand you need to believe amen and trust and just go do it i believe god wants me to do this god want me to do that amen so brother faith trusts god in all circumstances in all situations no matter what it is amen you trust god if god changed this for you change that for you say okay lord i'll follow your leadership i believe that's what you want me to do and again are you doing what god wants you to do are you in the job that god wants you to be in and are you doing it the way god wants you to do it are you doing the way jesus would do it god help us again faith believes god not just believing god in in god but believes god believes it is written believes thus said the lord amen oh yeah brother brown said to what is faith he says faith is the atomic bomb amen oh yeah he said faith is god's atomic bomb that's right it is yeah he said that's that's that's what that's what god looks at and what god sends us this faith praise the lord i got it here somewhere but again it's a quote and it might be 1962 he said it he said faith is god's atomic bomb he said the world got atomic bomb here tommy bomb there and he said they're all afraid of the tommy bombs he said but he said god's atomic bomb is faith amen that god is able to do this do this do this do this amen faith do you have god's atomic bomb that gives us the victory over the world the flesh the devil amen it's going to blow the devil out and blow the devil away amen so brother let's tr let's believe god let's trust god and let's obey god no matter what he wants you to do do it amen and not just hearing the bible says oh well i've got to repent i can be baptized this way and so on and take the communion and so on yeah i'll obey god yes but he wants you to obey him in your everyday living what is the will of god are you in the will of god today what you do how you do it where you do it when you do it are you in the will of god amen pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go yeah but by the time that god was finished with egypt pharaoh wished he had obeyed god amen and by the time that god is finished with this world today they will wish that they had obeyed god but no they don't believe god know that god is now if you want to believe god that's fine but the world doesn't take it serious most in the world today is not really serious when it comes to their faith not serious when it comes to god no no they feel more more in general today they just feel all i got to do is believe in god you know no believe god and he believed what he says believe what he reveals in this day and in this hour why you got to believe what he's doing in your day because he's going to give you the you know it'll give you the faith that he wants you to have today amen not just the faith that they had in previous ages or they believe this they believe this is oh they believe god they believe god yeah but look what they did proving their faith in god what are you doing proving your faith in god what kind of life are you living proving your faith in god and sometimes the faith of god in you is going to make you do things that's totally contrary to religion and what the churches teach oh yeah grace so brother sister grace this world is believing god less and less and less and they're becoming less and less tolerant of christians and the christian life and that's why jesus said when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth because the more and more powerful the world gets and the more and more influence the world has got on the people the less that they they're going to confess regarding jesus regarding the lord regarding the word no no they don't mind you being religious and going to a church but that's it when you leave the church you leave your religion there you know but the world is not impressed with everyday experience with god no they think they think it's something that you only exercise on a sunday or on a wednesday or when the church is doing this church you're doing that maybe on a christmas or an easter that's it amen god help us that we're going to be jesus every day reflect jesus every day he's the same yesterday today and so you're going to be the christian today the christian tomorrow the christian next day amen you're going to reflect jesus love jesus amen live the life of jesus every day give jesus preeminence every day this is the faith that pleases god amen brother i've thought about i said lord when is this going to be when the son of man comes well we believe he has come and he's revealed to the bride and there's an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride yes sir yeah amen and says will he find faith well true believers are experiencing less and less faith as more we go on the less faith we're seeing people are getting more and more yeah they can get more and more religious eating around the message but where's faith the bible says be all i set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey god's the commandment of the lord yes which i command you this day amen and a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day go after other gods which ye have not known god help us faith without works is dead amen faith works only when the individual possesses a for forgiving spirit a right attitude and a right spirit amen faith is in action but if you don't have a forgiving spirit a forgiving attitude no you've got a dead faith because if you've got a living faith you've got a forgiving spirit you've got a living faith it's jesus christ in you and the attitude that he had you laugh amazing so do you have jesus attitude toward your brothers and sisters do you have jesus attitude the woman at the well oh the disciples never had the same attitude not until they got the holy ghost christ in them oh jesus went up to the well and and there was a time when when those women would go to the well and and that's that's the time when others the ordinary people wouldn't wouldn't go to the well they would wait till after another another time of the day or they look at you know what time is it oh we can't go to the well because the prostitutes are going to go there at this hour yeah they wouldn't go but jesus did amen oh the disciples didn't like it because he was talking to this woman praise the lord but oh hallelujah we just think she went and she she give her testimony she said come see a man who told me all i've done she said is not this the very messiah amen so somewhere she must have been a predestinated seed jesus knew her amen and the other would have nothing to do with her so brother let's keep our attitude right in our spirit right yeah the disciples say oh lord what are you going over and talking with her for amen but thank god for the testimony she gave praise the name of the lord oh yeah the disciples would wouldn't do this wouldn't do that but jesus with the right attitude and right spirit he was he was encouraging him yes keep your attitude right amen that's right sister keep your attitude right do you have a right attitude do you have the right spirit toward your brothers and sisters in the faith family friends neighbors oh yeah keep your attitude right keep your spirit right even towards those that you're working with you go to school with yeah grace of god they'll recognize it and it's for the glory of god that i would give you the testimony of the experience that i had in attending school now again as i said one time in questions and the teacher was asking questions and what's your thoughts what's your thoughts what's your thoughts that he got to me and i give my answer and one point there he said oh he said oh he said mr lush she said do you know he said you're going to be a judge i said no i said i don't know oh yes he said i think you'll be a judge because of the because how i answered the question and how i explained it and again at the same time when as i said and i can see it now in that school there and i and i can see that position see that time see the other students and see this the teacher that was there and he said to me he said excuse me mr lush he said do you know he said that you are going to be a pastor i said me yes yes i believe you're going to be a pastor oh i said i don't know i said well will the lord be done well he said good he said but i believe it i said okay and as i've said let me say it again but it was many many years later maybe 30 years later that i met him in the mall you know he came to me yeah i wanted to know what i was doing and i told him always that i knew i knew that he said yeah oh yeah and he's from a certain denominational church and again i was a witness to him then and even my witness struck him it really struck him because i could see that his countenance changed amen god knows grace brother the faith we begin with is the faith we end with the only thing is is the faith the faith matures and grows and gets stronger and stronger and stronger amen and with the more and more faith got what's god doing god's revealing more and more of the word he's giving you more and more revelation more and more understanding amen amen hallelujah and the more he gives you the more he can use you so i pray god that we're there for him to use us and again even our young brothers and sisters oh lord that you you will be a witness in school even as i was a witness in school oh yeah and not not talking a lot no no i didn't talk a lot not by any means no by any means as they approached me one time they were doing this doing this doing that and they said other students they said oh gerald they said you don't do very much and you're not involved in much but would you mind getting involved in this would you mind helping us with this they said we think we you should it should help us here because many times they would they would just leave because they knew that maybe in my faith i wouldn't do this wouldn't do that but there's things that they still believe that even though i had this faith they still believed i would help them i said okay amen yeah praise the lord i pray god make you that kind of a witness in school in your job you know in university whatever making that kind of a witness reflecting jesus amen so that they're going to not concede your nature your attitude your actions your reactions his jesus well they may not recognize it as jesus but they know you're different amen again understand the true faith of god that pleases god is a faith that possesses a forgiving spirit amen he forgave you and you forgive them oh yes as i've said to somebody on the phone i don't know who was my brother ed cater was talking to her some other brother here and i was saying brother i said when it comes to others i said i i go here and i go there i see this see that i said lord i said you forgive me you forgive them i said lord the grace you gave me i trust you'll give them amen and the grace is there to save me i said lord save that that that that person there oh yeah don't look down your noses and cr criticize them and condemn them no just pray grace to them say again this is why the angel came to the prophet of god and said don't you have that attitude toward that person he said because he said some of them are my children and he said there goes you but for the grace of god yeah amen we're saved by grace through faith so brother the more faith the more humble you get real genuine faith the more humble you get yeah i believe that jesus said jesus said when you stand praying forgive for if you have heart against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses see the only way you're forgiven is when you forgive you forgive others you've got a forgiving attitude forgiving spirit god will forgive you if you don't forget it you're not forgiven so do you have the right attitude do you have the right spirit do you have right models right objectives i tell you you're looking for evidence of the holy ghost i'll tell you you have the holy ghost you've got the you got the right attitude you got the holy ghost you got the right spirit right mode right objective amen you got the holy ghost you've got a humble spirit god help us i pray the grace of god to grant us this kind of a faith a forgiving faith a forgiving spirit amen a faith yes that believes god a faith that trusts god a faith that obeys god a faith that stays with his word and gives him the preeminence amen for the glory of god amen a couple of verses to share with you in deuteronomy he said be all i set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey the commandments of the lord which i command you this day but a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the lord your god amen and you turn aside to go after other gods well what are the other gods it could be your education it could be your job it could be your family it could be friends they become gods oh yeah i know situations even among believers we're unbelieving members of family are their gods they're more cut out with the unbelieving family members than they are with the believer believers they are there's many a believer out there like that oh i've met them many many many over the years but the true believers that i have had fellowship with over the years real true believers oh yeah they're just they're interested only in the family of god brothers and sisters in the faith oh they live for it the whole mind morning noon and night and you know that's they wanted to fellowship with them morning noon and night yeah family believers believers believers oh yes but now it's getting to the place where there's a lot of believers but they're just caught up with oh well we'll see you sunday or wednesday yeah and but in the meantime they're caught up with their natural family who are unbelievers and they're trying to justify natural family who are sinners i was shocked when a certain believer was i was talking to about certain issues and he oh he said brother he said i don't believe that's a sin anymore he says this is not saying that's not sin although his family many and his family were guilty of it but he said no no that's not sin he said because he said this isn't the bible doesn't it but but he's misinterpreting it to justify himself and to justify his family it's sick you see brother your spiritual family is more important than your natural amen oh yeah why because we come from eternity we now oh we get fellowship in time oh wonderful praise the lord we know them from eternity and we're going back to eternity the natural it's not the natural family no no no no not by any means come on let's get into the word and find the right attitude right spirit regarding your natural family you're there you're there to help them there to encourage them and there to be a witness for them amen the god that saved you saved will save them if they're predestinated but other than that well you treat them right treat them good and so on and but again give preemies to the spiritual not the natural grace grace as believers we are moved by faith we're controlled by faith not by sight or feelings or emotions not by any means we're controlled by spiritual revelations and as believers our actions and reactions are based on faith not sight feelings or emotions amen the bible says as thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in that e which in that thing which ye allow oh yeah and they're allowing a lot of things among natural families today you're gonna take your stand against it keep your attitude right in your spirit right but still let them know that you know we don't agree with this we don't agree with that and that we believe this is sin according to the bible but you leave the choice is theirs but you've got a choice too amen definitely so as he that doubteth is damn defeat because he is not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin amazing whatever you do let it be according to the faith of the revelation of god or christ in you the hope of glory let's live we live by faith walk by faith if you're not going to live by faith you're living by sin unbelief doubt god help us remember that the outside man is controlled by its instincts of survival naturally feelings reasoning rationale and waits until it senses and declares this and then it moves and acts and reacts according to its feelings but if you're a christian you remove and act and react according to your faith amen faith controls you yeah oh yeah faith governs your life that's right yeah and i know as one time i said i met some natural family and one of them got really nasty with me because i spent so much time with certain ones there in the same town but they were believers and i would only just drop by natural family say hello to them and so on and this time when i went by and one of the individuals of the family natural got really nasty oh you do this you do this you do that because this because well i said well i thank the lord that another member of the family stood up and defended me and they said oh no you're not right they said we know that gerald is right we know that gerald is this he does this and he's right in his attitude he's right in his spirit and so on so they defended me and said thank you lord amen oh yeah so god help us let's identify more with the family of god than with natural family what about natural family but again just leaving with the lord say lord i just i pray that you you'll grant them the same anointing you gave me and lord it's according to their decision you had a choice they got a choice leave it with the lord and move on amen grace listen faith being a revelation in our hearts we move we talk and we act and react according to what's revealed to us in our hearts living from the inside out and remember when it comes to what's on the inside of the inside and it's going to control your your actions and reactions it's not that you've got to force yourself to do it it's just it's just the nature but you've got the power and the anointing of the holy ghost there that's your nature now it's not the nature of mom and dad the old nature and the old anointing the old spirit no no that's that's gone and and the new nature's got control the holy ghost has got control now and so you just go automatically you don't have to god don't have to force you to do it it's just there you've been born again amen that's that's why god predestinated the new birth to be born again why why to overcome and control the old birth there's too many still governed by the nature of the the old birth i pray grace that the new birth takes control amen amen i could do some drawings here on the board i won't do that i've done before to show you the the nature of a man the old nature the new nature amen and to determine what's controlling you what nature is controlling you now what nature controls you when you go out of here what nature will control you tomorrow or at your job just the old family nature or the new nature of god the baptism of the holy ghost oh my are we born again if you're born again you're your new creature in christ you're born again oh yeah you're totally different in your thoughts your words and your deeds yeah oh yeah this brother you don't compare with the sinner no more no no sinners are going that's the way they were born naturally so they're going to go and live naturally but you're born spiritually and with the spiritual nature you know you're different now it's like one time the man went into the church and they made an altar call and there was this gentleman there on the on one side and on the other side was a sister and she was she had her hands raised and she was praising the lord and he knew her what she used to be but she was a new creature and he said lord he said would you make me like like her he said i want that new nature he said i want that new attitude a new spirit because she was totally different yeah and he got out of his when he made the altar go he went up to the altar praying lord i need that new nature change me amen brother sister so that when when when the life goes out of this body the nature's got to go into another body it's right there if you're born again you come in contact with your theophany body and as i've said the prophet said he said it's not 12 feet from you at any given time yeah and he said in times of you know you're you're you're tired and weary and warm and so on you see your theophany will draw near you to give you strength and encourage you amazing yeah oh that's the holy ghost yeah but again it's it's it's your it's your part of you that's in eternity amen and we're gonna and oh yeah during the resurrection he said the prophet said the dead and christ are going to rise first and the glorified bodies and they're going to appear to the living saints amen and he said then the living saints are going to come in contact with their theophany bodies and he said enter into a glorified body amen because he said in our theophany bodies he said we we can see each other we know each other we recognize each other but he said but we we can't touch one another he said because it's only a theophany bodies spirit bodies and so on he said we can fellowship and talk but not not touch but now he said in the resurrection we move into glorified bodies he said now we can shake hands and touch one another oh yeah so brother i pray the grace of god that you're the only body is not dwell feed from you now amen amen amen and it's waiting for you the prophet of god said when when the dead in christ rise and he's entering two glorified bodies then he said our theophany bodies comes and we enter into a glorified body we enter into that theophany into and is glorified by the grace of god and he said then oh yeah and we have fellowship he said we're going to fellowship he said oh yeah i think he mentioned it somewhere in 30 to 40 days when you're referring to time he just want to let you know that there's going to be a space there that we're going to fellowship with one another yeah and he said then we look up oh he said there's jesus amen we're going to go into this body and jesus is going to go into that that body as i said he's that gut next to the throne amen but he's down here in the form of the holy ghost in you in me in all of his seed gathering us together unto himself again and then he said during that time he'll go back and get that body again and come down there he is that's what the other prophet said that yeah and we look up he said there he is praise the lord and he said in glory right now he said all the saints that are going on they're not we're not going to fellowship with those in previous ages he said he said they're going to fellowship with with all the believers in in that age they're over there they're over there they're there the lutherans the methodists and this one and this group and so on but he said when we in in the resurrection rapture he said we're all going to come together by the grace of god god help us amen praise the lord listen god helps to believe in the resurrection god help us to believe in the rapture god of us to believe in yes in glorified bodies amen god allows us to believe that we're getting closer and closer and closer to those bodies amen god's grace many things there could say on faith we'll see i mentioned that abraham his actions and his reactions wasn't based on sight it wasn't based on feelings or reasoning it was based on faith what god had revealed amen and faith told him that out there somewhere there was a city whose builder and maker was god and he believed it he went looking for the city amen it's one thing to say i believe it but it's another thing to allow it to control your actions and your reactions it's another thing to allow it to control your relationship with the people around you but abraham in his faith-based actions and reactions he showed that he believed there was such a city that god had promised he was so in union and so one with god and what god revealed to him that he obeyed even though it meant leaving the land of his birth and total separation from his kindred the problem today is that people choose not to walk the talk there is a lack of the life of the holy ghost that motivates the walk indicating a great lack of faith where there is a lack of faith there is a lack of union and oneness with the bridegroom because the food the drink the pleasure weddings and social life that preoccupied those in the noah's day also pre occupied this generation no you don't know as they they got caught up with the natural part of life the natural things in life not the spiritual but brother i pray we're getting more and more caught up with the spiritual and less with the natural amen grace yeah what are we looking for grace i pray that brother there are thoughts and motives and objectives is more and more and more on the resurrection and the rapture our faith is concentrating more and more on the resurrection and the rapture whether whatever god has done and what god is doing is to increase our faith regarding the resurrection and the rapture amen he got all done previous ages he got him to focus on on the revelation of what he want what he was revealing whether it's justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit well now he's getting us to focus on the resurrection and the rapture yeah god help us if we are in perfect union and oneness the word bride body with the word bridegroom we will manifest a pilgrim's actions and reactions we will walk the talk a pilgrim is not a resident he's just passing through and that's why he doesn't become preoccupied with the natural things of life he never settles down in this world amen grace of god and there's a lot more quotes regarding the rapture and faith amen god help us 1953 he said well if we can't have enough faith enough for divine healing how are we going to have a rapturing faith that's right oh i believe there's a great call coming forth amen i truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have a rapturing faith and we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone rapturing faith god or rather we've got to have a faith that'll change and quicken this body and be taken away by the grace of god believe there's a church on this road tonight a power of the living god that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning amen brother speak the word that's right and a church is coming out not a psychological psychologist not some of this put on make believe but a real true genuine anointed holy ghost called out church amen amen amen rather what a tremendous hour we're living i pray grace lord elvis let go let god have his way lord help us to let go father of the natural things of life let us get into the spiritual amen lord that we're going not by sight but by faith is faith controlling you amen listen god's grace he said to now he said we're moving right on into another great age coming for the rapture of the church amen and in this he said we're living in the time he's of the restoration of the gifts and he said it stumbled many of the big fine churches it sent nazarene backwards it made fanatics out of a lot of pentecost but just the same god's moving right on and bringing in the rapturing faith for his church amen so tonight i represent that faith amen that was once delivered to the saints amen grace brother god sent the prophet with the word with the message to give us rapturing faith amen after you have trusted him watched him do so many things till becomes like just a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god amen for that's what god wants us to do is to recognize one another as brothers and sisters and rallying around this great gift of god which is the holy ghost we'd all be one in one great bundle of godly love he said that's what it's going to take for the church to go in the rapture amen that we be one great bundle of godly love praise the lord amen thank you jesus praise the lord eddie wright the other day she didn't ask for anything she was just sitting there but she said the right thing which please she pleased the holy spirit and the holy spirit spoke back and said hattie ask anything that you will and whatever you got you want and you want find out whether this is real or not he said whatever you want ask right now amen and he said if it don't come and give it to you right now then i'm a false prophet he said believe he said that's something isn't it yeah remember jesus said say to this mountain amen and you've heard about what's been taken place that's the ministry that we are entering into yes sir we are way up the road now and soon the coming of the lord jesus and he said we've got to have rapturing faith in a church he said that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry it'll be there yeah because god has given the word to give us that faith by grace amen glory he said how can the evening light be anything but back to acts again right when he said before the day comes they'll burn the earth like an oven and the righteous will walk it up on the ashes amen oh brother we are looking for a light to come it's here amen the light is here glory and remember when elijah comes that's the messenger to the laodicean church age elijah was the one that went up on a chariot never tasted death and he said the message of this great messenger that'll come in this closing day amen in the laodicean church age the pentecostal age will be the one that will take the church to rapture he was raptured himself and he will come with the church to the rapture the ministry of elijah yes sir amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise the lord he said i believe the churches begin to hear the message and begin to understand but friends listen we have got to lay in the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that god has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the bible and he said but all he said out of the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up and he said you know gets sweet in the spirit amen and he says sometimes in speaking the message you get harsh and have to break it in like that because you've got to clench the nail to make it hold amen yeah you just don't drive the nail in turn it over and clinch it amen clenching the nails oh yes i've seen that done for years and years and years and years to see what the the the old folks you know building this building that and they're using the nails and then they turn it over and bend the nail to make sure the nail's not going to fall out yeah so we got we got to drive the nails in and then we got to clench them and a lot of so-called believers don't want you to do the clutching the collection gets a little bit more rough yeah god help us we got to clench the nails we got to clench amen the faith that god has given us amen listen grace brother this third pool rapturing faith is to be used only for the purpose of fulfilling the promise for this age and the promise for this age is resurrection and rapture but again he said our faith isn't ripe amen grace of god amen amen and it was the rapture of message 1965 and he said to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her oh yeah we got the message and we think the rapture the message is the revel this revelation that revelation this revelation that revelation but do you have the revelation of the rapture because that's what god's doing there was justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but don't put the emphasis on that now we thank god for it move on because the emphasis now is the rapture resurrection amen and he said the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture amen and it is a revelation for revelation is faith and you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you and faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to abraham and that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so god alphas amen it says in joel god is going to restore the lutheran age did not restore the church it started a reformation the western age did not restore he said the pentecostal age did not restore but he said god has to restore for he cannot deny his word and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church he is going to bring his original planting back to the original seed amen and he is going to he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by teaching or former rain next will come the harvest rain the teaching rain right brother you got it rightering faith amen so he said he's doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former rain next will come the harvest rain teaching rain or rapturing faith that's right anything that god has given us and is giving us in these last days is wrap is to give us rapturing faith by the grace of god amen and amen and amen praise the lord to god be the glory there's many many other quotes so we'll leave that by the grace of god brother to encourage you to understand and believe that what god has done has been predestinated to give us the faith that we need in these last days and it's not just to say i believe in god but it's to believe god concerning the resurrection and the rapture are we ready for the resurrection are we ready for the rapture and again bear in mind and remember as the prophet said that the dead in christ are waiting on us amen and he said and god is waiting on us amen for the rapture for rapturing faith but there's too many and i know it just too many so-called believers are waiting on god no we wait on god for we want god for the resurrection well he's he's already done this he gave us the the revelation of it he'd give us for to give us the faith of it and so on for the resurrection and the rapture do you believe let's go let's go into resurrection let's go in the rapture come on look up praise the lord god help us my prayer brother i trust by the grace of god that it's striking us right again the prophet of god said in 1965 november the 27th just before the lord took him home he preached the message i have heard but now i see amen he said we see him meeting after meeting and sometimes we sit just as cold and indifferent yes i know the scripture says it oh i have seen it done but he said we have no enthusiasm and it doesn't seem to strike us right well it's trump luther right struck wesley they struck the pentecostals when they went around the world preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and so on oh yeah what about the message of the hour to give us rapturing faith is that striking is right if it strikes us right it's going to give us rapturing faith amen we're not going to it ought to have given us rapturing faith now look up your redemption draws near look up how many are looking up and especially considering what's going on in the world right now in russia yeah that's right in america around the world remember the prophet of god said that oh if this is recorded i bet be careful that there was a certain country you know he said they got a bomb and he's got our name on it what name the name of america be on your guard it's serious and if brother if there's anything that ought to help us look up more and more and more with what's going on in the world now not no don't look out over there don't look out there don't look there look up amen we're in the hour of the change we're in the hour of the resurrection and the rapture it's serious what's going on in russia what's going on with america and russia and other other nations and so on it is serious and surely after all that we've heard the prophet say it ought to put us more on our toes more on our guard yeah god help us brother don't wait till that all this happens no no it'll be too late then because that's that's brother that's what's going to cause those to to ask that question they're going to see this see this see this this is going to happen that's going to happen and finally they're going to say oh i thought it was to be a rapture oh it's already happened and you didn't know it didn't know it it already happened oh yeah god sent the messenger god sent the message to to give us the resurrection and rapturing faith amen he took the messenger off the scene he left us with the message and he raised up the ministry to take it on to the coming of the lord amen so brother sister i pray grace that we're not here to say oh i thought there's to be a rapture i pray grace that we're experiencing the resurrection and the rapture that's get brother we need to get out of here amen that's right brother brother it's not loving this and loving that it's loving the promise of the resurrection loving the rapture amen well jesus loved it so much and jesus was put so much chances on the resurrection rapture and finally he said he said how long shall i be with you he didn't want he didn't want to stay here no longer but yet knowing what he had to do to get out amen yeah how many of us how many of us are pressing on as jesus did knowing what he would experience knowing what they were going to do to him but he kept pressing on he want to keep going to jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem and peter was there to stop him no no no if you're going to kill you in jerusalem you're going to do this going to do that no no no don't go to jerusalem and got to the place eventually where the lord rebuked peter and he said get there behind me satan because thou savers not the things that be of god amen because jesus knew that he had to do this he had to experience this he had experienced that amen what for to experience the resurrection and the rapture and brother we've gone through it all these things and now the hours come for the resurrection rapture let's get let's get out of here amen brother let's not not enter or stop believers from getting more and more into the revelation of the resurrection revelation the rapture let's get in let's get it out into it let you encourage more and more to come with us come on where are we going we're going to the resurrection rapture the resurrection and the rapture is on it's already in progress amen oh i trust we're numbered with the bride that is being caught up too many think it's all future we will be
