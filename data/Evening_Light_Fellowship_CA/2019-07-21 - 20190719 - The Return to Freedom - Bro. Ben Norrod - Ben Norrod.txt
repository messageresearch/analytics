Lord happy to be a Christian a man happy to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen without it you know brother we don't have much hope laying ahead of us I hope you realize that we're not born again we're in trouble amen but us this got the token applied let the death angel pass God's Brides safe at last Amen absolutely right amen I want to I want to try to go a couple places here this evening just as we get started into the thoughts that I won't try to if it'll will help us lay a foundation for the entire weekend I'm gonna start Leviticus chapter 25 amen pick up on verse 39 well speak to you tonight on the return to freedom return to freedom vitals probably heard some of this already in Edmondson but believe me when I tell you I may read the same scriptures but it ain't the same message amen amen I guarantee every time you preach something that ends up being a little different amen but with evangelism you know that's something you you kind of abide by a theme when you preach and the theme or the message you're trying to get across is not really the message here but it's what you're trying to use to get across and I've noticed many times that you can take the same sermon preached at different places and depending on you depending on you now you're the one that works that depending on what you need that's where the message will go tonight amen and so we don't try to get any preconceived idea I just got my notes laying here and if Lord wants to use them he can use them but not then we go wherever he wants a mess it's the way it works Leviticus 25 and let's pick up verse 39 and if thy brother that dwelleth mighty beewax and poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant but as a hired servant and as a Sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of Jubilee I watch here in verse 39 again thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant and I watch this verse 40 but as a hired servant now here's the reason why God had its place just this way one reason that you have to remember about the people that you're talking about is these are covenant people these are people that have been circumcised on the eighth day they're following the lineage of Abraham they're the called out the church the chosen the predestinated the cold you can't treat such people like slaves they already had a birthright so God said treat them as a hired servant if a man falls into debt treat him as a hired servant but don't you treat him as a slave why because he's already got a covenant he's already in his for life right now watch and he shall serve thee unto the year of Jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and under the possession of his father's shall he return I tell you what let's pray ask the Lord to help us I'll let you be seated we'll catch these other texts in just a moment father we thank you tonight for the word Lord Jesus what a privilege it is for us to be gathered here tonight old God in the auspice of the presence of the king we love you Lord and as we've got an audience before you tonight we're asking that you'll come and take your word and that you'll anoint me as a speaker them as a listener anoint the pages of what will be read and said and God may you just come down tonight and do whatever it is you want to do Lord we yield ourselves completely to the mind and the hand of great Jehovah God give us thy favour tonight Lord Jesus as we look into your word in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen and the church said amen amen you may be seated that's a rule in a Pentecostal church did you know that you had to say a good hearty Amen for you loud to be seated that's a rule in Pentecostal churches amen you need no hot done by the Chatterley today man I guarantee hey man don't feel bad boy that's the way I do it you may ever hear me and pull an I yeah you thank you something hey listen I almost get hoarse so I get more hoarse and the preacher dad's pulling on the word hey man I like it I like I like a good worshipful a man and a praise the Lord I think God deserves it I mean I think he deserves it he absolutely deserves all of it now I want to direct your attention now to Exodus chapter 21 and I want to look at verse 2 and kind of come on down just a few verses now mind you you brethren in Edmonton out that I you you'll hear similar things but it ain't gonna be the same message I promise there's a lot of different things that you can bring into this and sometimes I might have 40 messages wrapped up into one context and I like to keep my messages real full and thick and just keep everything packed in there because I never know what time that the devil is gonna pull something and I'll need a new piece of Arsenal to go after him a man so I like to keep it nice and packed in there and I've got so much material tonight I'll be honest with you three services would never cover what it is I want to try to get to you this weekend but God helping us I'm going to try to hit the high spots of my thoughts and then that way we got different preachers sitting here tonight they'll be able to dig into these things and be able to break it down and bring the messages in the coming weeks which i think is one of the benefits of being an evangelist that you can bring and just lay it out there and then the other ministries can grab it and keep running with it in the coming weeks I've always said that Impe reaching I like to build a platform so the one I leave there everybody can take one step up and come up a little bit higher than what there was the time before and I feel like if we can't come higher then really the preaching is no benefit and it doesn't do us any good just to get up here and read a bunch of statements and put some words together except it benefit us and edify us it's not really even fulfilling what jesus promised that we do when he would send these gifts back to the earth and that was to edify or perfect the body of Jesus Christ that comes by the word that comes by your revelation in the word that comes by the blood of Jesus Christ cleansing you from all sin and preaching is important because what we need to understand is that part of the way that the Bride of Christ is ever going to hear truth is going to come by the preaching of the gospel I've said this a million times allow me to say two million and on one reason that people they say they're against preachers are never going to make the rapture if they're against a preacher is because the very one Jesus Christ who's bringing us into a rapture is a preacher himself amen and you got to hear him you've got to hear his message in order to get yourself in a condition to get rapture ready or resurrection ready everywhere the Lord would take you now preaching is important because as we're going to read in just a moment that these that were out working in the field now from a natural perspective you look at this from maybe the outside looking in we would say it doesn't really look like it's that big of a deal here you got a man that's falling into debt he owes some money and he can't pay the thing off maybe his farms went belly-up and he has a rich uncle so he goes to his uncle and he says hey buddy I need some help he says alright I'll help you with your debt but I can't just give you everything I got and be left penniless I need help I need you to help me work and do things maybe around the farm so he would hire himself out as a hired servant he'd go out into the field he'd milk cows he raised corn crops everybody does and he would work himself you remember the story with Jacob how that he worked seven years to get Rachel and then he ended up getting the ugly one Leah I mean sorry for the LEAs it might be hiding in here somewhere amen but then he gets the pretty one that he loved at the very beginning on down the road and of course his working it out was because he was in a debt of needing the money for the dowry and for the arrangement of the marriage and so as a hired servant he would go into working now from the outside looking in that ain't that big of a deal most of us that are living in someway of debt whether it's a house payment or some car payment or something like that we go to work every single day or we go to work five days a week every how you work and you work and work and work and work you don't let sleep come to your eyes until you knock the thing out and you're done with it that's the same principle as what it was in Israel now you and you're on your job you can either walk in or you can walk out you have the freedom to do whatever you want I like what a guy said to me many many years ago when I was working as a as just a young teenage boy and in the factory and he said I would want to do that I'd get fired he said hey pal I was looking for a job when I found this one he said amen so see we're hired servants not slavery now if this was a slave time you wouldn't be able to have permission to come and go as you please but a hired servant has rights to have freedoms that they can exercise at any time they desired now there was penalties for a man that would have a debt and not pay his debt and many of the children of Israel knew what that penalty would be not only would it bring a slander against the names of the family and the people associated there but it would also bring a shame upon all the future generations so these men they knew the magnitude of what it would take to be able to go out there and take care of their own business so they would work and they work as a hired servant and listen friend there was no shame and then working as a hired servant nobody would look down on them nobody would call them scum or good we're good for nothing or ever what am I say but they were doing what they had to do as a requirement of paying off the debt so the law made a provision and remember friends there were ten commandments given in the original book ten commandments that Moses come on off the mountain but as you're dealing with people and as always people are it's going to take a whole lot more intend to solve their problems so there's all kinds of amendments that was made not so much amendments but addendums if you will or additions made to the ten commandments for example if a man was out chopping wood in the woods and his axe handle flew off and hit another guy and killed him there had to be a provision made for that individual because of this accidental death he couldn't just say thou shalt not kill and then here is he's dead and you've killed him and we're gonna stone you without mercy so they would make all of these provisions in the law in order to give the person an opportunity to be able to do things justly I for an eye tooth for a tooth year for an ear and every what it might be now when this man would be working in this field trying to pay off his debt there was another law placed in there the law of Jubilee and at the Jubilee sounding or the trumpet sounding of Jubilee there was a certain set time every fifty days or every fifty years of water of his 50th excuse me 50 days pardon me years months knees I'm all mixed up see Bob this is why I need you keep me straight boy I get all mixed up now the 50th day which would be Pentecost or the year of Jubilee that 50th time no matter how small the debt no matter how great the dead no matter what kind of burden the man might have been under if he was out in the field he had a hole or a plough or whatever you had his hands on he could just walk away from it throw it down for Moses said his debt will be completely cleared off now we understand looking at this from a natural perspective hey this ain't no big deal but remember by the brother Ben taught us that the Spirit of God was hiding himself in all of these little scenarios in the Bible when you'd see an individual come such as Ruth when you look at the Book of Ruth then four little chapters in there you don't think a whole lot about it oh my you know just a woman that fell in love with a man and as man the man's name was Boaz and she just fell in love with Boaz Hey ain't no big deal but God was hiding in the life of Ruth to play out a spiritual type that when it was happening the devil couldn't recognize it how many women were falling in love with men in that day there might have been many Ruth's there might have been many Boaz's come on somebody amen but God was hiding himself down in the lives of these individuals so that he might take a whole mystery and put it together with the parts of these individuals lives so here this individual he's working as dead he's out there paying off his debt now to the devil or to anybody else might not have been no big thing he's working this dead out praise God and hallelujah he's being an honest man but in a spiritual sense of this God was absolutely showing that no matter how much we fall into spiritual dead at the sounding of the jubilee trumpet we could go free can you say Amen amen now let's turn in the Bible for just a moment hold your place there in Exodus for just a moment and let's go to the Book of Luke for just a moment I just got a scripture coming on my mind I want to bring in right now Luke chapter 4 verses 18 and 19 now this is Jesus who is going to preach what he says the acceptable year of the Lord now you know what the acceptable years that's the year of Jubilee if you want to find that brother Bream tells us that in this day the scripture fulfilled he tells us about how that the one who preached there in jeffersonville in 65 this states in Part B junior high school if you're trying to find it or look it up and brother Brahim is preaching image join him two congregations is on a split side either way it could go this school of thought or that school of thought a man here's brother Bram standing in the gap giving us this day the scripture fulfilled it's a beautiful message I love it amen but he says in there that the year of the acceptable year was the year of Jubilee now watch her Luke 4:18 the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor see there Jesus was a preacher hey man Jesus didn't just push play and obey he wasn't just reading the scrolls come on somebody he was preaching the gospel that's how God does it amen anytime the elect is help it comes through preaching that's God's Way I'm going to show you that in just a moment help the Lord now watch yes anointed me to preach he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised and here comes to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now notice that if they're poor if they're brokenhearted if their captives if they're blind if they're absolutely bruised in spirit or in heart he come to pay off whatever debt or whatever bondage would be holding them whatever debt that need to be paid off after year of Jubilee Jesus come to take care of every bit of that and then you realize what he was speaking of he was speaking of the atonement where his blood would be shed for all the humanity for all of the world and by shedding his blood if you're sick if you're halt you're withered you're blind or whatever it is he would pay off the sin debt that was created in the Garden of Eden and everything that followed us down to this time will be stricken off our record where we can be set free amen but you say I still get headaches I still get back aches I still get too excited heartaches yes but the payments already been made your debt has been paid off just give it a little time child and when that body change and resurrection takes place Amen you'll see it's been paid in full hallelujah because you'll see the Dead has absolutely been paid amen stay with me just a little while now go to Exodus 21 you got your place there and I want you to look at this other type of this son of this Jubilee time now watch if they're by a Hebrew servant this is verse 2 6 years shall you serve and in the seventh church age I mean I mean in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing now he's showing us here a Titans these numbers you go watch the numerology the Bible it all means something six years he shall serve but in the seventh he shall go out free or in the time of releasing or the time of freedom would be applied to the seventh hour now I want you to understand something friends the year of Jubilee for the Lady of seein people did not take place at 1906 Pentecost no no that what exactly they're not at all no no that was only the restoration of the gifts Amen that's all God did was restored the gifts because that brother man tells us in the church age book he said what was thought to be the long-awaited restoration was nothing more than just the restoration of the gifts our Jubilee sounded at the opening of the seven seals Amen that's where the lamb takes the book remember there was no man worthy not in heaven not an earth not beneath not around that was able to take that book why because he had sin debt upon sin debt upon sin debt he did not have the ability to pay himself out to make himself worthy enough to be able to take that book and John got to crying a member on a sudden he hears a voice come don't you weep John for the line have prevailed to take the road and when he turns to see a lie and he sees a bloody lamb that blood was the purchase the token power to be able to set at liberty anybody that had their name on that Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world amen because when was your name put there not the night you got saved one of the nights you come running to the altar you didn't get eternal life the day you received the Holy Ghost you always were eternal that's why you could receive eternal life that's why you could receive salvation is because God saw fit Amen to put your name in that eternal book I mean at one thing we have to understand is that the sounding of the seven thunders at the breaking of the seventh seal at the opening of the message of the hour the real true mysteries of God coming open all of that was the sounding of jubilee for the elect of God we were not set free by the restoration of gifts the church was still in bondage then if you don't think so just go look and see after the restoration of gifts how many splinters the Pentecost showed up after that if they were free how come they didn't understand the message yet how come many I'm was looking at oil running out the hands and blood out of the forehead and still believe in the initial tongues of the evidence of the Holy Ghost or initial evidence was tongues how come they were still believing a lot of nonsense about about water baptism being regeneration and women preachers and everything yes what you could say man and ain't gonna hurt me come on somebody it was not freedom to them it was only the restoration of the nine spiritual gifts but at the sounding of the seventh angels message we received our Jubilee the revelation opened up to a we could receive true freedom I've said this a million times I'm going to say the million in one one thing we've got to understand is that as believers of the last day message there ain't no gift in this world that can fool us I don't care be a preaching gift a tongue gift a prophecy gift a healing gift we've got the devil's answer for every moving of the supernatural love on this planet somebody said to me while I dream dreams I said I'm glad about it I've got a little template I can use to see if your dreams of God or non one man said to me well it's a spiritual dream I said all right if it is and you'll follow what he's said in God amen God God always a man he talks about God's gifts finding their places I know this is gonna pinch that's why I'm hesitating a little bit here it comes amen but he talks about he said if it's a spiritual dream it won't have a bunch of symbols in it he said there's no prophet on the earth to interpret well go look it up in 1963 he said without a prophet here to interpret he said when the Prophet interprets it he sees the dream as though you're dreaming yourself and will even tell you the parts that you left out that's just what he said I can't help it I meant and he said if it's a spiritual dream God will speak in this hour like he did to Joseph of Arimathea and say fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife as such as the movement of the Holy Ghost so whatever I'm out on the field and somebody says ho I had this dream I go I pulled my meter out he said we'll tell me about your dream well you know the Lord spoke to me and told me to do such and such thing that your dream was a spiritual dream one preacher estimate I said how can you discern that how do you know I said because it fits the template Amen it fits the outline of what's been given to us in this hour I had an individual call me about a year ago ins had this big convoluted spiritual thing I mean the Eagles were flying down on white sand and all this kind of stuff and he said what do you think it means I said I think it means you need to stop eating at five o'clock before you go to bed stay with me a little bit amen amen we have the answer for all of these things that brings the elect of God freedom at watch in verse three if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married than his wife shall go out with him if his master if give him a wife and she had borne him sons and daughters the wife and her children shall be our masters and she shall go out by or he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife my children I will not go out free now I want you to think about some for a moment why would this be a problem if you were this man now no think spirits are now just thank the weights wrote this man who falls into debt he's under his masters home his master treats him well gives him three square meals a day he takes gives him hot water we would say or gives him a nice bed to sleep in and he's got a daughter he falls in love with this girl he gets married they have kids from a natural perspective brother mark I don't blame the guy I wouldn't want to leave either now far as being in love with her if it was Samantha Kay I wouldn't want to leave either I'll butcher in slavery yeah but this is Samantha Kay we talking about a man that's a big deal and I love her so much I wouldn't want to leave out of that situation now from the natural perspective of it you couldn't have told by looking at it if there was any kind of a thing spiritual going on at all well that's a big deal he got a wife and kids he wants to stay with his family but launched the type that Jesus picks up when he uses this I love my master my wife and so on and so forth Jesus picks this up in the New Testament when he said if you'll put father or mother or cousins or aunt or anybody else above me you're not even worthy to serve me in any way whatsoever see these things were done to hide from the devil what the real plan of God is a man you're writing things down I'm going to three things to write down I want you all to remember the theme of Christianity has three parts to it reconciliation Redemption and restoration there's the three main principle themes of the Bible if you're a Christian those three themes will follow in everything that you do when you see somebody fall into travel a trouble into traps and things you don't want to just shove them down so I knew you didn't have nothing anyways you want to reconcile them that's what the Bible said in Galatians right he said you see a brother falling you who are spiritual go back and try to restore such a one amen the theme of reconciliation look what he's said in second Corinthians five he said that we are ambassadors to Jesus Christ to do what work the work of reconciliation to bring others back to Jesus Christ those that have fallen those that are halt blind weary whatever they are to bring them back and then the femur Redemption but the RAM tells us Christ the mystery that scarlet theme of redemption goes all the way up and down through the Bible so there are three main themes to Christianity reconciliation Redemption and restoration what was Malachi fleurs job in the first place behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and he shall restore or turn your hearts back to the faith of the original fathers in that same message he tells us in the church age book that Elijah had two missions his first mission was to restore and his next one was to reveal what is that the book of redemption coming open to reveal the election of God their position in Jesus Christ amen my preaching that fast are you listening that slow which won't happen Amen but these themes brother they all lay right in the Word of God and this one theme after another that you'll see all the way down through the scripture reconciliation restoration and redemption again and again and again and again again now once you notice how in verse six that he takes this into a different category now of how that if a person would be in this condition how that they would behave now watch then his master shall bring him unto the judges and he shall also bring him to the door or under the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him for ever now this this all were talking about it was like a great big drill and it's like a big stab looking type a deal like that and what they would do is they would take this individual that refused to be set free they were giving up their own rights to the freedom that come with the Jubilee trumpet and they would take this person and bring them to the judges because you realize at the City of Refuge before every door there was a judge standing at the City of Refuge to judge whether your case was worthy to come in or not we called him preachers today not just pastors now not just evangelist but all fivefold ministry I was in Chicago a couple weeks ago and I was telling them brethren about how the prophet of God talked about when he was there and they laid the trap for him and he had the vision you remember and oh we're not going to get this room we're gonna get this room and everybody's going to be set in a certain place and if they thought for sure they was going to get a certain room and and the brother said now this and brother branham told me about this two days ago and he said he told us where all of you is going to be sitting and he said here we are today and brother BAM walked up to the platform and he said now you come take your Bible and stand by me he said and then prove me wrong on the serpent seed and water baptism you remember the story well he tells Billy Paul and you can find it the message right before he goes out there he said Billy he said I've got to take a word to go down there and guard the Tree of Life to guard the Tree of Life remember around the book of Acts there are four guards that are set there Matthew Mark Luke and John are guards to eternal life so before a man or woman can enter into eternal life they gotta cross preachers to do it oh god I'm glad y'all believe it I'd be in trouble right now I'd be out there with the Titanic came in hallelujah exactly right now watch now he shall bring him if his master shall say bring him out of the judge he shall bring him to the door under the doorpost his master will bore is ear through with an awl now we know what the door is the door is Jesus Christ in John 10 I am the door now if he is the door and he is the way and he is the truth and he is the life then I want somebody to find me one scripture that shows who the judges are going to be in the last day it's very simple the saints of God shall judge the earth amen and in those that that grouping of the saints of God there's fivefold ministry and those ministerial gifts are there to do what to guard the the wicked doers and the evil doers and all of those to keep them out do you realize part of the job of a preacher isn't just to swing the door open and let you in if you want to turn a life but part of our job is to deafen those that can't hear it that's part of my responsibility to to preach it away that if you're not gonna receive it it'll shut you up the rest of your days you'll never be able to hear it again oh don't misunderstand I don't mean to leave Church we'll come on now that's it right here in the house of God and there's no you know though hey come on I don't mean I leave Church there been plenty of people occupy pews and message churches that still can't hear nothing is being preached they hear what you're trying to say they they got ears as brother Gerald said today it's not it not Erie's they're not ears to hear but ears singular they got plenty of ears and like brother Gerald said the ears are connected to this but the ear is connected to that amen and that's the thing if the gospel blinds remember Billy Graham blinded all them people out there with this preaching if the gospel is to let them in remember the same water that saved Noah in his household was the exact same water the exact same preaching that shut the rest of them out that's why preaching is such a valuable thing I don't mean no harm when I say this and I realize this is going to get out on the internet and people are going to say old brother bins just trying to throw off on somebody but I'm not trying to throw off on somebody I don't care if their name is Branham or Smith or lessor nor odd or Regan or bisque I don't care what their name our coffee or whatever the name is I don't care who they are any man that tells you that the only way that you can figure out how to become a Christian and get right with God is push play and obey that man's got an antichrist spirit on him I don't care what his name is amen because if you don't have a gift to be able to break down that word you can listen them tapes every day of your life but it takes somebody gifted to break it down for you you can't just listen to the word and understand it yourself you need somebody to preach it to you amen you remember here last year we took the little fella riding in the chariot remember we talked about in just a few minutes and he talked about how he was reading the scroll in Isaiah and he said understand what you read he had more common sense and half the people in this message he said how can I say somebody some men guide me some men teach me a mint you've got to have a judge to be able to say come in or go out it doesn't work any other way brother this is God's program Amen brother sister and I don't mean no harm I'm not throwing off on BGR I'm not throwing off on tape churches I'm just saying they got a wrong spirit on them because they don't line up with the word it's not what the Prophet said it's not what brother Branham taught us it's showing what Paul said amen because Paul said keep joining yourselves together to do what not just set down here because I read the skull of Moses could you imagine Paul and him guys and we're gonna read from chapter four today that ain't the way they operated they preach the gospel and as the Holy Spirit used a gift a gift that would come from Jesus Christ that gift was placed in the body of Christ amen for your edification come on for your perfection how do you become mature preaching it brings you to the maturity of Jesus Christ you know what else it does it lets you know you can be free not just free from sin not just born again there are many things after you're born again you still need to be freed from you get quiet on me now now listen you told me to be ready I'm telling you the same thing come on out now brother this is exactly gospel preaching this is why when the jubilee trumpet has sounded if you don't have ears to hear you will never hear it again if you've ever been deaf into that sound and the judges would be the one that does it it won't be just like folk common Lefou but remember I'm told us that the third pole there would be a group of people in the churches that would be absolutely eternally lost could never be saved and they'll be in the churches oh you say well how do you know that indictment message read BAM said where is Jesus Christ get as hard as Speirs from where did he get his crown of thorns from today where's the second Calvary he said right there from them pulpits well if they can crucify him from the pulpit can't they also resurrect him in the same place Amen and if they can kill the effect of Christ on the congregation's can't we also resurrect the effect on the congregation it goes to prove they're the judges they're standing at the door even Jesus spoke about it he said why are you lawyers that stand in the door keeping people from coming in amen no matter how we like to think of it you can't get past these gospel men they're anointed by the Holy Spirit to do the job that they're doing and you cannot get past them now remember if the servant shall say I don't want to be free I want to stay with my family then he shall be deaf and then never hear the sounding of the jubilee trumpet again now I want to just take for just a moment a couple little pieces here about New Testament Christianity if you will and listeners pick up Galatians chapter 5 verse 13 now is your turn and I just want to give you a little a little background of what I'm going to try to talk about for just a moment and and one thing I want you to keep in your mind is that every Christian no matter who they are no matter how a brand new or how many years you've been in it every Christian has a sovereign responsibility to keep their hearts right before God remember that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a free gift but character ain't character is a victory it's not a free gift you don't work to get the Holy Ghost there's nothing you can do yourself as far as salvation is concerned there's nothing you can do to earn salvation and all the legalists holiday man come on now oh my god I live right after you got saved that's true oh I do the right things after you got saved but nothing you did brought you to salvation salvation is a free gift that's a scripture that's just the Bible I can't I can't say only and nothing but only but what the Bible said salvation is a free gift but character ain't that way character is not something that God just gives to you you have to obtain victory after victory after victory huh you got to go through things rather to get there and I promise you you think it's easy as some of these young girls up here with their long hair and dresses if it's easy in this day and age you you you boys you know what I'm talking about when you see men running around their wives and this that and the other and then they say well how long you been married 21 years to each other it's just hard to believe sometimes that people can have a an honesty about them can have a true cuz the world is so corrupted and so wicked and they hate you for your stand because you represent everything that they hate about themselves they know you're the opposite and they they hate that about themselves but the bottom line it comes down to one thing that if we are going to obtain victory in Jesus Christ obtained character in Jesus Christ there are certain things that God will do for us and we don't even have to ask for it he just does it and then there are certain things we got to do ourselves now what I'm get ready to show you is some of our responsibility as believers all right Galatians chapter 5 verse 1 now I want you to pay attention to the way Paul words is he says for stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free all right stop a minute aren't you look in your Bible and I want you to notice that word 1/2 it's not present tense that's not futuristic it's past tense something I want you to get in your mind right now you're not waiting on freedom you've already been given freedom that's the problem with a lot of people in this day and age they're trying to work themselves in the spiritual freedom it's already been given to you as a believer Jesus Christ on Calvary gave himself for the sins of the world that's my sense that's your sins that's foolish virgin sins that souls under the altar sins that's ah that's everybody that's why babies go to heaven little baby comes to this earth it lives 11 hours and it dies and somebody say well he wasn't bribed he didn't go to heaven that ain't what the Bible said the Bible said the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world he said until mother man said until a baby comes to the age of accountability he said that child is covered under ignorance by the blood of Jesus Christ babies go to heaven where they wind up it in our business whether they're a bride or ever who they are but I don't believe that God would be just to send a baby that can't even decide right from wrong to send it to hell amen there's a place reserved there'll be millions of children that'll be may be walking outside the streets of New Jerusalem they won't be bribed necessarily maybe they wouldn't be elected of God maybe they wouldn't be those that we would say this is the wife of God walking the streets but I don't believe that are lost either well friends that's what brother Branham said we can get all kinds of funny ideas as message people because we've got this elitism mentality if it ain't bribed it ain't nothing hey brother I Got News for you there's all kinds of categories that God's gonna let me save amen I got three girls I'd love to see them be bride I'd love to see them receive the Holy Ghost but if they're not bride and they're not gonna receive the Holy Ghost that ain't up to me I can't I can't set him down with a message book every day and say you're gonna be bride that ain't up to me I couldn't set myself down with the message book every day and make myself bride well come on preach to me now amen I can't do that for myself it is God that show up the mercy to make me bride that silver reason I am bride because I wanted to be in because I asked to be it's because he chose me but there'll be million saved he said well the earth is an awful little place don't forget we got Jupiter Mars and Saturn and all them spots out there amen there's all kinds of galaxies and planets who knows how many millions of millions upon millions of people a man might be living in other dimensions you say well we can't get in a rocket ship no but we got to travel like a thought we have thought Rockets even a man we have the ability if we want to think I'd like to be on Jupiter poof there you are amen you'll travel like a thought Allah brother brems said Amen lightyears what's light-years to a god the kids got a control of light in time and space and matter amen and will be like him we'll have a body like his own glorious body amen will they live on the city where they live on the outside of the city sure they will amen they'll be plowers just like Adam was to till the soil but the man taught us that those people will have the ability I'll have they'll have son they'll have moon they'll have all of these type of things on the outside of the city why because that's the way they lived here in this life but the elected lives by the light of the Lamb why because that's how she lived on this side and then we're not living by the light of one revival to another we are always in that light that's why we're doing what we're doing today by worshiping the Lord like we worship we're living in the Esso in light the Esso in light of God amen now watch Paul said you have already been made free now if we can understand that if we can grasp that then anything you're struggling with I don't care how little or how big it is you need to understand Jubilee has already been sounded for you and you can be set free no matter what it is now watch this now and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage wow that's quite a remark so Paul is showing us now that we as believers now remember he's talking to brethren here you don't think so skip down to verse 13 where I'm getting ready to read from looking them first couple words for ye brethren they're not talking to us he's talking to believers so as believers we with the Holy Ghost have the potential of building up a sin debt well glory thought y'all said you was ready for me hey man now you said I'm a believer yes but there's the law of sowing and reaping so once an you'll reap a whole washtub full they just don't think this because you're a believer don't mean that you can amass debt against your life I'll give you an example of what I mean you remember when the prophet of God had got up under that tax case and they got nervous and it meet II was on the phone and said well you want me to do business tell him I'm not here and he ran out the back door real quick well he went to go pray for a baby right after that member story anyone to go pray for that little baby in the Holy Spirit said yeah fit to touch that child even pray for it why God tell him at not because he wanted to believe or not because he didn't have the Holy Ghost he had a master sin-debt in his life and that debt God was making him pay for his dead get a little message one time I think it's in he's in you I think 63 64 and I can't remember the exact spot but anyhow I'll wake you up 2:30 in the morning when I remembered okay but I remember brother Brennan talking this much he said that every time he come into the city and the Jefferson Lily get hives and break out and get a cold you know what he said he said it's God making me pay for not going out and listening to him the very first time he said when I listened to my mother-in-law God was still making him pay he had a debt and that debt followed by the brim all the way up to the very last years of his life he had stomach trouble and all kinds of little things and he stood there in and on the wings of a snow right dub and he said as of today he said I believe I'll ride this trail again he said I'm God give him brand new life rail he wrote it all right and just a little bit from that he was riding on the trail I guarantee it mm but no natural trail with no tent set up around him a man he was in in rolling fields of bluegrass in just a little bit hallelujah but the Prophet had to pay all these little debts and things in his life because remember you can become entangled again usually I don't believe that well then you don't believe the Bible because I just read it together this is what scripture said is it or isn't I maybe am i reading something in your Bible hey man well glory to God I'm the elected uh-huh sure you are I'm predestinated sure you are oh I'm a child of God I know that yes I know that but what about this guy in the book of Corinthians living with his father's wife Paul said turn him over to the destruction of the flesh but the saving of the soul you know to having that guy he repented and got right with God at the very end of second Corinthians mmm-hmm but what if Paul would have been like some of us today in the message all there ain't no way a Christian can backslide or get little things wrong or do something wrong you see our biggest problem is as human being is much less Christian human beings is we think that we can't really mess up and really that's our cowardice speaking because at the end of the day what we're really trying to hide is our inferiority when we should be throwing that at the feet of Jesus Christ and telling him I am inferior I am weak I can't hold on you got to hold on to me right out we cut it up with some kind of a veil trying to pretend like we're more spiritual what we really are well I'm a believer therefore I can't lust I don't believe it I can't lie your silly is what you are you're just not thinking about what real Christianity looks like because we've painted this beautiful picture of what Christianity is and that's casting out Devils and slaying lions and knocking goliaths over and all this kind of stuff and really Christianity comes down to two things wins and losses and you're going to have both of them in your life every day of your life so Paul is telling us don't become entangled again with the yoke of bondage now watch this verse 13 for breath again what a potent believe Christians could get into this why is he calling these guys brothers because Paul knew this listen he tells us in Romans chapter 7 the good I want to do that's the stuff ain't doing the stuff I don't want to be doing this to sever keep doing anybody a relate with what Paul said what was he talking about the ability to become entangled or build up a sin debt in your life that you've got to pay it all you say but it's too much I cannot er comment but thank god we've got a checkbook with Jesus's name sign at the bottom of every one of them all we got to do is fill out and send it up to heaven amen and I don't care if it's a complex I don't care if it's a fear huh I don't care just sign your name Jesus's name is attached to it and you can have your freedom remember you're not waiting to be free you're already free you're already free you just got to recognize it now watch here again oh I like I says this he said for you have been called under Liberty amen that's why you're sitting here tonight you've not been called under bondage under this and illegal ism of these things but you've been called unto Liberty that's your calling Amen somebody I wish I was called to something you are called to Liberty amen only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another now we all recognize this Paul the word he uses here for occasion is actually the word resources we all know this little part of living because you know being believers being elect you know seal on my soul I can't never be broken I can't never go to hell I can't never be lost you know God God can't send me to hell you know so he probably wouldn't mind y'all look at me like a bunch of Methodist and you know exactly what I'm talking about little things we try to get back oh come on don't look at me that way now little things we try to slide by because in our heart were comfortable I know I'm saved I know I've got to hold a ghost I know I'm not going to help I'm at a lot o you know you know how did you know God understands Paul said don't you use your Liberty for an occasion don't you don't look for resources well you know you know the prophet of God you know he had a Christmas tree and he gave presents to his kids yes that's true but when I go by your house and I see Santa Claus on the roof and I see him in the driveway and I see you dressed up like a reindeer I think you've carried it too far come on outreach to me well you know sister Rebecca she had little riding scored so on to be able to ride a horse yes but that don't give you a right to wear breeches every other day of the week don't use Liberty for resources well I'm a Christian therefore I can get away with such-and-such and so-and-so listen I understand one that when the believe the sign bunch bergen's and all these guys got in there and they took that little picture brother branham in the little African garb with the shorts on I don't believe brother friend practice wearing shorts he done it as a joke for his children like many of us has done the very same thing but brother Branham also wasn't a people-pleaser he wasn't looking around waiting to see who he was gonna offend he just wanted it something funny for his children because he loved his children and he wanted to do something but malodorous a lot I am preaching against shorts and then there isn't a pair of shorts see how the devil does you got to be careful you cannot use your liberty for resources I had a fella tell me some time ago you said you know cuz if there's anything I'm hard on I'm harder on Halloween than damn Christmas I promise you that I'll never understand how Bible believing God called people can go out there and let your kids dress like a bunch of ghouls and goblins with butcher knives in their head and scary faces and the whole thing and say and then one fella told me well brother branham let his kids dress up in Bible characters I said yes but Freddy Krueger is a far cry from Esther or from Abraham or from Moses not trying to be funny forget me but brother this is what the Bible said don't use it your liberty as a resource well brother better watch Gunsmoke yes but I don't think that gives you the right to watch all of the big trilogies of everything that there is to watch brother man I went to a movie house and watch the river runs do it to see Marilyn Monroe glory to God that's using your liberty for resources so well hallelujah you can't go watch every shoot-'em-up and every r-rated thing in everything hey man that's using your liberty we had a girl many years back in in Manchester and I don't mind saying this out loud I said it to her in her face and at the pulpit and everywhere else I thought was wrong what she did she said well you know brother Ben she said we get dead ends us girls I said huh huh she said well you know I don't look good uh-huh I knew her she was heading but I just don't know how she's gonna get there you know she said so what I figured out to do she said you grip your hair like this and you rip like that so you rip all them dead ends out there and it makes it nice and even and I said sister I got one thing I want to tell you I said any spirit that would cause you to rip it your glory it's a wrong spirit if it's got a pair of scissors in his hand or it don't you years ago and in Lima when when I used to go up that direction there were some girls out there that said well the Bible said you can't cut your hair so they would take a curling iron and get it so hot that they'd burn the ends of their bangs off to make them nice even and straight don't you see if that is using your Liberty for an occasion an occasion to the flesh and people look for excuses to do all kinds of things I'm not cutting it yeah but this thing you're doing it you're achieving the same thing no matter how you doing amen we used to tell some of those women like that they said well or to God you know we're abiding by the scripture I said mate maybe you think you are but it doesn't make sense to me I'll never understand I'm just gonna hate to say something right now and it's gonna sound hateful but I don't mean for designed hateful it's just the truth but a lot of the girls they read this thing about nail polish you know tell them how they realize that they don't put pink and blue and purple and all this on her fingernails and toes so what do they do they go get a French manicure thing and put clear note in that nail polish on it and you know what people look at when they see you like that they see you like you got painted toes and painted bangers but you know the message you're using your Liberty for an occasion to your flesh is what you're doing hallelujah it's the truth I listen y'all know me I'm not a legalist I've got Facebook I don't believe these things send people to hell what sends them to hell is the attitude and the way that they operate when they do many of the things they do hey listen I was telling about the Matthew the other night I said many of these people that carry on about Facebook being I said these are the same people whether they're parents that we had to carry on about them laying on the phone gossiping 24 hours a day anyhow god bless you stay with me hey man is that Alright don't use your Liberty as an occasion let me give you an example of this word occasion in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 14 Paul said I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully now remember he's saying to these two these young women don't give an occasion or don't give the devil resources to do anything amen against your testimony for Christ now I want to say something to you you realize that the majority of where the devil gets resources against us you know where it comes from us we're the ones that give him a lot of resources we wake up on Monday morning oh I hate this job I hated church last night I hate the bad this is too hard and the devil sitting there going whoa glory preach it preach preach what was how to get him cut on our pleasure Jimmy and then Friday rolls around and you wonder why you've had such a miserable week it's because you give him resources you give him enough time you give him enough work amen that he understands how to approach you that's why I tell people sometimes I learned a lesson from my pastor for the keira before he retired brother Carol used to tell everybody he said I never let the devil know what I'm thinking cuz he can't discern my thoughts of my intents he said so I never let the devil know what I'm thinking somebody asked me how I'm doing this I feel so good take to me to handle it amen and that's true that's true if you live your life in such a way so whether when Satan is attacking you and you just keep smiling and you just keep praising the Lord well glory to God and hallelujah the definitely what is a matter with this guy we've hit him with our best stuff I don't want to give him any resources nothing to work on he can sure do it all he has to do is watch somebody cut you off in traffic and he's watching your expression to see what you're gonna do that's why I know I can't hide it if somebody cuts me off I get mad about it so I just speak it out man why do you guys do this stuff Oh hallelujah anyhow hey man I just figured I can't hide it from the devil no houses sometimes I just use a little honesty and then I do what I'm supposed to do I just commit the thing to the Lord and I'll sweat it walk off and leave it alone some people can't do that some people have got it in their mind they got to do certain certain ways and certain certain things and you know they got a they got to operate when you say well how are you feeling today come over to God I am on the up side of the mountain well but you're not you die in you're sicker than you've ever been you know go to the devil you're just telling the truth so somebody knows how to pray for you there's a difference in being honest and given the devil resources the difference of it is is whenever you start complaining grumbling and murmuring about the different things oh you know God don't listen and they pray for me 12 times and then ain't happening all that and the devil just saying huh huh got you right where I want you Amen there's nothing wrong with being honest sometimes you got to be honest if you're hurting you just got to say I'm hurting something ain't right with me I need help somebody pray for me somebody you know get me to the doctor or something like that I was I was laughing I was teasing today and I made a remark and I taught my how people you know brother Carroll used to say to him and it they not going to the doctor or something kind of remark like that or I'm not going to take my medicine or something like that brother Carroll say well there's one two things wrong with you he said either you got a lot of faith or you ain't got no brains you said how shall I pray [Laughter] amen but you got to be honest sometimes sometimes that's the reason marriages fail because there's no honesty in it that's the reason why parents and children have so many opposition's and adversarial things there's no honesty in the thing you know what I can't I can't yes you can if you're not careful you'll give the devil resources to work on that you should have never give him in the first place amen so don't give an occasion don't give the devil a reason to come against you now let's turn to first Peter chapter 2 verse 15 15 and 16 a man and a man well I hope this is all right amen because if it's not it's too late now hey man I could have you standing we could start all over again but I don't know if you'd like it alright first Peter chapter 2 verse 15 now watch again how Peter brings this for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men so a lot of times brother you don't even have to defend yourself you just have to live right your life will put the ignant put to silence the ignorance of foolish man amen now watch what you said as free not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God now you all know how this looks you know you've had them guys to come and debate you and they start out something like this now my precious friend and brother we love this message don't we oh look out here comes that old boys getting ready to get you high guarantee that don't use it as a cloak if you've got a disagreement just say I don't understand help me understand it seems odd to me I hear you're talking but I don't get it can you explain it to me but often we try to use things as a cloak and what we've done is we've amassed a sin debt in our life and if we're not careful those debts will mount up if you ever tried to pray and it feels like a church is sitting on you you know why that's there dad you've got debts you need to pay you've amassed some sort of cinder that's why you need to realize the Jubilee has sounded and brought you freedom and you can be free but you've just got to keep writing checks every time some little thing comes up that's why the prophet of God said if you can get a little spot of bitterness in your heart get it right quick because he said it'll grow into something big don't let little debts start compounding I mean because I'll tell you when it comes to sin and little things in our life they have compound interest on them something you start today will triple by six months from now amen the dividends have it'll be so great you were getting a mess you won't be able to pay the thing and the only way you can get out of it many times is just say God I need your help if you don't pay this off if you don't get me out of this debt I'm gonna be in a mess forever that's why when something comes up don't wait on it get it right then don't wait around for some little thing to fester or some little thing to grow because it'll grow interest mm-hmm sure will and before long we're brother Evan said take the Christ right out of your heart you don't want those things in your life because how are you going to be able to live as free live as a free individual a servant of Jesus Christ how are you gonna live in such a manner if you allow a little things to build up if you got something against a brother don't let it just bill you don't talk about go to him and say listen buddy I don't understand all this I maybe it's me maybe it's you maybe it's us maybe it's something else I don't know but I need to talk to you I mean we don't do that a whole lot because we really don't trust the person we're trying to talk to we don't know exactly what kind of thing they're gonna pull off but I guarantee you one thing as long as you've got something in your heart toward them they've got more power over you than you've got over yourself and so you can either let it affect you or you can go to Jesus Christ and say god I'm writing me a check today I need to get this thing cleaned out of my life Amen that's right that's exactly right Peter said don't use your Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness a lot of people will try to use the message as a cover-up for them live in any old life they want to live somebody said to me one time well brother BAE and I do these things because I'm predestinated to make it I said hold on a minute I said predestination is a generic term generalized term I suggest because you use the word predestinated doesn't mean that you're actually predestinated to eternal life I said predestinate it could be a lot of things this bench right here tonight's been predestiny that wood was predestinated by God to be a bench sitting here in this church house amen that's true that suit of clothes you're wearing it was predestinated to be around your back the tree was predestinated to put forth its bloom those clouds were predestinated to be clouds lots of stuff is predestinated the question is what's it predestinated to the devil is predestinated demons were predestinated well just look at in the Bible there's certain are angels that God called elect angels that's predestination and there are other angels that were elected to be just like what they are today demons because that's where Devils came from they fell from heaven and they fell to the earth and now they influence man and influence everything around us in elected predestinated to do that very thing then I felt I said to me here's some time ago he said you know Paul said take a little wine for the stomach's sake so I can drink a little I'm predestinated I said I don't think that's what Paul was getting that boy he was trying to tell him because of the pollution of the system and things like that remember Timothy done the work of an evangelist and when he traveled different places he come up against all kinds of different foods and all kinds of different to the drinking's conditions and no doubt might have been involved in all kinds of things where it took bad water drank something that wasn't agreeable like that and Paul said take a little wine for the stomach's sake in other words Paul telling Timothy used a little wisdom when you travel so that way you don't catch an amoeba and die hey man but the cloak of maliciousness you know how that goes usually that's what we call down south being sneaky you know robbing Peter to get Paul you know I'm talking about how they say one thing to you oh I'm glory to God a brother told me here just said today in a certain country he said you got to be careful when you're preaching to him because as you're preaching to him he said they'll pat you on the back and say what a great job that was and said the minute you get out there sight they call the government on you and have you deported out of the country cloak of maliciousness you know oh I love you my precious brother and then when your back is turned they start talking all kinds of little things is that or the other that's the cloak of maliciousness lujah Peter and Paul both said don't do this Peter was a man who had the keys to heaven right open up the door to heaven Paul was the pattern of every messenger and every believer in that first church age and all these other Church ages Paul was a guy you got to listen to if you want to understand a message today and both of these men said that a Christian could become entangled in all kinds of little things see the problem is we throw people in hell when we see them entangled instead of trying to redeem him reconcile I'm in restoring a man hey man that's right now watch his brother Brahim says the hand of the Lord he said God doesn't want you being just a professor but he wants you to be a possessor amen now let's turn it up numbers chapter 19 verse 1 now I want you to notice this for just a moment how that there's another little type here in the Old Testament that applies to the Lord Jesus but it also applies to the church as well using the red heifer now I'm just going to use this as a kind of a to bring in more of my theme of what I'm preaching tonight but notice this numbers 19 at first 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded now watch saying speak unto the children of Israel that they may bring the riddler without spot where it is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke blood Ram said this has a great meaning since you had to be a red one and he said wish we had time to go in all this but they said the yoke meant that Christ was not yoked up with anything on this earth a man he wasn't yoked up with an affiliation an organization Jesus what need a part of the boys club and you know the message has got plenty of them little circles you know they preached for this one and that one and preached for that one but God helped if anybody from the outside tries to preach for him if you're not in the circle if you're not in the club you might as well forget I'll remember you look clicks and things getting churches - oh come on preach to me I don't use excuse you listen you're doing more and listening you about half way huh ah I don't like this kind of preacher well it's where the rubber meets the road and if we're gonna get the car down the road this is the kind of preaching we need to hear I don't want to say you're pouting but you might be a little but if Jesus Christ refused to be yoked up with anything then why would the elect of God want to become bound to any kind of a system whenever you find yourself trying to please somebody else in order to be a servant of Christ in any way any capacity your honor you're living with a yoke on your neck and you shouldn't have to live that way if I have to worship in a way to please you or I have to preach in a way to please you then I'm not sure my yoke amen and remember we're supposed to be yoked up to Jesus Christ that's the only thing he was ever yoked to brother Gerald that was his church his body right but if you have to behave in a certain way this happens in families a lot of times one family member will think that Christ looks this way and wants everybody else to holler that same way hey listen boy your interpretation of Christianity and your family is not in your minds reputation in mine keep yours and yours and I'll keep mine in mind you worry about sweeping your steps and I'll worry about sweep in mind the people get under yoke you're gonna tell me brother Ben's got Facebook yeah and I'm still a Christian imagine that I'm still a believer imagine that you think that the waters on Facebook the world is in Burger King so quit going there what I'm trying to say to you as many times we get too excited about things that really don't have any effect on our Christianity at all whatsoever now if you find people getting hooked up on things in the internet and it's taking them to all kinds of deep dark places that might be one thing but as a general rule somebody using email can get in trouble as much as somebody on Twitter amen all it takes is for somebody to ring up a video chat out of their email system gmail has got a system where you can ring up a video I was in New Zealand my wife was calling me on video chat right through email and I thought to myself after we hung up I thought now how the devil could use that very thing writing an email don't need social media do it hey man come on preach to me what I'm trying to tell you brother I'm not trying to take up for Facebook what I'm trying to say is we get so excited about all of these little specific things because in our mind we feel like we have to make people Christians there's no such thing listen as parents we cannot make our children Christians as a pastor you cannot make the congregation Christians as the teachers and avenges we cannot make the people do anything if it's not in their heart I don't care what you tell them they'll never do what you preach it in unless it's in their heart I know people in this message I mean to tell you what's the truth you see them a beard it's red right I get that from my mama you don't know nothing about red oh do you and and we was talking the other day and somebody said even a preacher having facial hair they said well first of all brother BAM said if Jesus was here he'd be clean-shaven with a three-piece suit on I said I asked you a question where's your three-piece suit the point I'm trying to make brothers many times we try to yoke people up into things do it our way do it my way and if you don't impeach us are bad for that we try to preach to people our convictions do it that way cuz I'm the preacher if it don't come from the word then your convictions not gonna get me ready for the rapture I don't care who he is awakened from just like a certain place mention any names but whenever I've been told different places all you know we like the Prophet wonderful but God's got all kinds of preachers all kinds of people that can help in the body of Christ not just preachers but how about all these musicians sitting out here that bring on the Spirit of God you don't think we have these lovely services like we have over here in st. John's just because I walk out here and preach it do y'all this is yourself saying before I come out you're 90% of the reason we have such good services but you imagine what the meeting would be like if we got out here and nobody even trying to enter into worship in the first place it's a body move friends and we work together but we work as free not binding each other to one another's philosophies of life there's a certain church I know and I'm not just picking on people I'm trying to give you examples of what I'm talking about and and and this man said that a preacher cannot wear a colored shirt like yes I said oh god I'm in trouble because that's all I God just kind of shirts now that fella told me preacher shut and preach for the tamanna pulpit this is what I'm trying to tell you Jesus Christ wasn't yoked to anything he lived as a free man and we should live as free people if we're not careful what we end up doing is we use our convictions as a pattern of what we think Christianity looks like and all it does is puts people under bondage all the way through the church that's right now I want you to listen to this brother time talks about you said being you know full way Christians instead of halfway I like this remark you said Jesus Christ he said bears record with your spirit that you're a son and daughter of God if old things have passed away and all things become new he said so the salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope so but it is a know so you know it when you are Christ now he said not a borderline minister not a borderline Christian he said if the crowds going this way you go with it or if they go that way you go with it he said and be not entangled again or halfway God said it makes him sick in other words he said it's a lukewarm so living a half way life is a lukewarm type of life this is why if we become entangled we should repent write some checks say God forgive me God have mercy on me because if you ain't careful you become lukewarm and if you want to live a lukewarm life the devil will absolutely allow you to live it he'll bother you just enough to keep you lukewarm praise the Lord right now watch this in questions and answers now I'm gonna try to close with this remark but I want you to listen at this way brother Brennan uses this and when I read this statement to you I want you to remember one thing first of all we no if this is a man or a woman they never identify themselves and I want you to pay attention to how the prophet of God discerns this case how he how he actually gets the meaning out of what's going on here now I'll call your attention to the fact that he does not use a vision he doesn't use discernment he doesn't go in our you live at such-and-such a house now these other things but I want you to see exactly how this comes about and let's read the question together he said now I live many years in December the rent until I found the Lord please I've sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored holy that's whil a while all the person holy again please but he said please help me brother Brown I have a devil in me he said will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again now I mind your friend if somebody come to you and ask you this kind of question like this you'd want to give them the very best answer you could possibly give them wouldn't you and here this individual now is ask him brother Branham for the help that they need now you would think Malachi for revelation 10 he's going to break into a supernatural vision of God oh I see you when yours a little child and the dog chased you on the porch and made you nervous he's going to break into some kind of a vision type thing or somehow to discernment you let it so and so on your house is so and so and such once you listen how brother Brenda's earns this case he said yes you have sinned but not so far but what you could be restored well how do you know brother Branham if you had sinned so far that you couldn't be restored you'd never want to be restored so brother Branham is deserting this case based on what the guy's desire or a gals desire to want to be restored back to Christ again oh my Lissa this he said you'd never want to be restored he said but see as long as there is something dealing with your heart you are still in the line of restoration that's a capital S that he uses there that's something he said guilty the lease is guilty the whole I have said many times oh I wish people would quote that more to message because brother Bram was not a perfect man mm-hmm that's exactly right he said every day every one of us do things we don't want to do he said if it's in our hearts that we don't want to be that way he said and you don't want to be that way you wouldn't be asking that question that in itself is proof that God is still dealing with you glory to God he said you've probably got nervous probably Satan telling you that you can't be restored he's lying certainly he is because look if there is a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to that call glory to God if there's a hunger for something that something has got to be somewhere or you would have no hunger for it at all oh brother do you know the thing that keeps us going the thing that keeps us walking forward it's that something that keeps holding on to our lives that's something of Jesus Christ amen Superman wears an S my Jesus does - amen is that sucked the game and the reason I can't give up is because he won't let me quit if I even tried to stop I'd be in trouble with him more than if I was to center rob a bank because it's more important for him than for admit for to him for me to keep on going because a Christian doesn't begin the race a Christian ends the race amen it's God that starts everything but the Christians got to keep fighting until they get all the way to the end and then the Holy Spirit takes him on home amen he doesn't want us to give up or to quit or to get lakhs or lazier or backward or any of that that's the reason why that every time you think you're within an inch of millimeter second water i've quitting and get something inside of you starts beating on the inside saying how can you quit something that you never began in the first place it's that something of Christ that desire that's the reason why that you keep moving like you move and no matter how much debt you get under no matter how much you mess up no matter how many mistakes you might make that little something on the inside of you just keeps pulling and pulling and pulling and brother if you've got that - not you ought to be the happiest person ever Wallace you later because I'll be millions go to hell 9 they wind up in the regions of the Lost this evening and never felt that something but one time in their life amen they'll sit on search pews they'll go out and hear sermons preached they'll turn on the television and some preacher be preaching to them and they'll feel a touch of God and turn it down and never feeling again in their life but I felt it every day since I've been born in this world I felt the call and the power of the Holy Spirit coming on me that's the reason I can't quit because of that something that keeps working on me amen this individual asked brother Branham brother Brown will you lay hands on me brother Branham says I could lay hands on you he said that's only sanctioning he said when we lay our hands on somebody he said we're only sanctioning that you believe it really I know and if they got faith all that the light passes through the hand like you said in a Masai on 61 and if they got faith the Holy Spirit uses the hand transmitted burt's you down in there when that little woman touched Jesus virtue came out his body I know all that but the hand itself doesn't do anything it's only a sanction you say you believe it I say I believe it we both believe the word and I sanctioned that you believe the word and brother brems says these words he said I could lay hands on you he said but that do you any good he said what would do you the best good is to realize that you're already free and you just don't realize it just recognize that you've already been freed so I'm trying to tell you the Jubilee has already sounded we've already been made freed he talks about little Johnny crow remember the story he had to rope around his leg and was tied up there and you know and he went ten foot that way and so forth and on then the farmer cut that rope off his leg and the little crow went the same distances all the way around there amen but one day the little crows gonna have to look at his leg and realize there ain't no rope on me there ain't no bondage on me I go as high in God as God will permit and as I want to be and I go as low as what I want to - amen so what I'm trying to say is with all these little entanglements that exist around us if we're not careful we'll get so entangled in something the devil say see there you're never got just look at your leg little Johnny just realize the Rope has already been cut and when you get trapped in something you just remember that you are not trapped that's only the devil lyin to you there's always a way out because my Bible tells me it's that our temptations and things of that nature says nothing that's not common to man but said with every temptation he makes a way of escape for us to be able to get out of it amen when I can fall under the valley it's like like you used to say back home in Manchester and we preach this a lot to the people and we tell them back home and say when you get in the mat there was a group of women it used to sing a song so when you get in the valley just remember that in the valley all you're doing is just changing mountaintops amen amen you're not even really just trying to live in the valley so much but you're looking for a road because somehow another you wound up there somehow another you wound up in the valley you can't help that that's Christianity character is a victory not a gift somehow another you wind up in them places but not I forget hey man just keep looking for a road out of there because God's made a way of escape you can be free if you want to be free but it's up to you Jubilee has sounded and depending on the amount of debt that you've got against your life maybe if it's a little small thing for some people you know his fella told me a joke the other day and I know we shouldn't joke in the pulpit but it's applicable to what I want to talk about but what I've been talking about and he said this guy got down and him Holy Ghost meeting and said one was a lawyer and one was a doctor and he said he got down and said he the doctor knelt down he started praying and he said Oh God forgive me I'm a sinner he's God fulfilled him when the Holy Ghost right there said hours into the night some eight or ten or twelve hours he said that lawyer was still praying all of a sudden 1269 he broke through to the Holy Ghost and got a foot in the Holy Ghost and he said how is I noticed you got the Holy Ghost pretty quick he said how'd you get it so quick he said well you're a lawyer see he said I'm a doctor he said first of all he said as a doctor he said I don't do like lawyers do he said you spent all night pleading your case he said I just walked in and told the surgeon just cut on me do what you got to do alleluia alleluia amen it just depends on whether we want to recognize whether we're free or not you stand with me amen returning to freedom now if you want to be free you can be listen this statement brother brems said laying on a hands he said that's a great thing yes I believe in that he said but that that's just a tradition if I could lay hands upon people week in and week out now you know how people are today boy if the Prophet was here whoo glory to God the proper was here he said I could lay hands on you week in and week out and still that wouldn't do you no good he said until you accepted what Jesus Christ has already done for you it ain't about who lays their hands on you it ain't hear about plays the piano or plays the guitar or the organ or the bass or who sings the songs that end about the the messenger it ain't about any of that it's about your faith that's tied it's not about who pastors or who teaches or who deacons or who whatever that's that's our problem we've attached Christianity and we put a certain face to it and so if the face is something that we like well that's Christianity and we don't like it well yeah jury's still out and we'd have a tendency to to I'd we'd we brand almost if you will we brand what we think Christianity looks like when really the truth of the matter is is that really it's not about the person themself remember the message look into the unseen in California and fifty-nine brother Bram is that the platform he's preaching and the he's worked with the people and he's standing up there and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit speaks through remember that I this is I the Lord this is not William Brennan this is I the Lord why don't people identify that way when I listen to tapes that ain't brother Brennan they're hearing the voice of God speaking in that word and I don't mean everything brother Branham ever said was God I don't believe the best cooks are in Texas or Arkansas or Kentucky or the 12 of the places he said the best cooks work I don't believe that stuff saith the Lord but when I hear them starting working into that message and the Holy Spirit starts falling on that gift I realize that's not William Branham that's the Lord speaking through a voice and that same voice can speak through me speak through you speak through any of us and we don't need necessarily brother Branham to stand here like this and say all right now good evening friends and all my you know people and brother Ram will walk down the platform and say you step behind that curtain so you feel the Holy Ghost go Lord people start crying and weeping well sure when you have a ministry that's supposed to attract the entire world God gives you an anointing that will attract the entire world why don't I have that kind of anointing because my ministry is supposed to attract the whole world I've got my 15 or 20 that I attract and that's about it hopefully I remain attractive to my wife as long as they as I get older that is you know what I'm saying the people they in their mind that have oh boy if brother Brennan was here but see it's not about brother Branham it's about you're realizing I'm a Christian I've got the Holy Ghost do you realize he said that whenever somebody would come up to be prayed for for divine healing the you realized brother Brennan said it really wasn't him that had gift of healing do you know that he said it's you he said the gift of healing is in you he said I know it angel told me and he said I'll be faithful to my Commission he said but my precious friends he said when you woke up here he said that gift is in you you're the one that's believing for healing and the gift of healing is in you but we attach faces identities and we said well hold mine we get in trouble you know how well I thought and so was here to pray for me if you just only knew the God that lives inside of your heart all you got to do is close your eyes and say Papa I got a need tonight what the Bible say if you ask for a fish he won't give you a stone if you ask for a blessing he's not gonna snake in your hand you just recognize who you are I'm already free I'm already let's pray together Lord Jesus thank you for your word tonight Lord I can honestly say it's a good start to the meeting we just thank you Father for your anointing and for your presence we pray Lord as we're gathered here now at the closing of this service as we've come now our so into preaching Lord and we've sang we've worshiped we've talked to you and we've heard from your word I pray now that you'll allow the seeds from this message tonight to plan up into our heart god help us to receive everything that was spoken give us favor tonight Lord to be able to receive what we've talked about lord help us just to be able to apply these things deep within us O God help us recognize that as Christians we have the ability to be free

[Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Alleluia I want you listen this in Romans 3:23 said for all of sin comes short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus the word redemption here is actually in two parts it comes from a Greek compound word and one apple which means the separation of one thing from another and then the union or fellowship of those two those ones that were unionized destroyed and then the other part of this word Lutron which means the paying of a ransom in order to literature led to liberate so in order for us to be free somebody had to come and separate us from the union of that old nature that we live with and in doing so he could pay our price pay our debts that we can be free once you receive the Holy Ghost remember this all the rest of your days you are not waiting to be free you are all ready free you just don't recognize the church you think you do but you don't recognize it like you should yet but one day that revelation is going to strike your deeper that's ever struck you before and when that hour arrives you just look at this old body and say change amen you'll just speak to it change the liberating the destruction of a union so that God could pay the ransom to bring us and liberation I bless your name I bless your name [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Applause] lord I

was it wasn't brother man it was the Lord amen I really truly believe it was God ministering to us as individuals here tonight a mayor there was not one of us but God said something here tonight for you so I trust that we read the Holy Ghost on on the inside of the inside so that we recognize God speaking to me a man you had that ear of the soul a man so that wasn't somebody else wasn't this one wasn't that one it was you a man so we got to take the word and we will apply it personally to ourselves by the grace of God and again thank God we're free he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed that's good a man because the Bible says now nobody can lay a charge against God's elect a man why because our sins are gone in the sea of this forgetfulness past present future it's gone so I pray God we got that faith amen in the finish work of Calvary praise the name of the Lord he's not doing it and got to do it again and again he's done it amen it's settled by the grace of God to God be the glory amen that's the maybe we're seeing seeing this course again Lord help me run in the race amen praise the name of Lord and God bless brother Ben being prayer for it God give him rest in his body
