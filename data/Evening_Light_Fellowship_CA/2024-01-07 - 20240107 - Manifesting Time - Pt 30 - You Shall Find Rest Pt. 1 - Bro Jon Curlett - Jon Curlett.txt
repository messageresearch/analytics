we're asking it amen amen God bless you amen wonderful song service this morning praise the Lord for that amen it's good to see sun shining out amen it's cold cold and it's windy but the sun is shining and you know what sometimes we need just that sun no matter what amen God bless you this morning good to see sister Elise Columbo with us amen God bless you Sister amen I got a a message from Brother Andrew Dodd last night and he confirmed with me he's booked his tickets for February 23rd through the 25th and he said he'll bring his wife Melissa with him as well so we're thankful for that we always appreciate it when the ministers bring their wives and we find they enjoy it more and they're more relaxed and and the wives talk to my wife and you know lets us know what they want and what they like and these things and so we kind of have a go between that makes everything go smoothly so I I was excited to get that text when I woke up this morning so just trusting that God will bless those Services amen God bless you if we would turn to Matthew chapter 11 Matthew chapter 11 this morning verse 28 says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we took a bit of a detour last service on the series on manifesting time but I want to come back to that thought on that we read about in second Peter chapter 1 for so long ago when we talked about add to your brotherly kindness charity amen we know that's Divine love it's agape love it's it's the the Holy Ghost itself and we spoke on many things about it we know know it's the Capstone we know it's the seal we know it's the finishing work of the believer's life and it's nothing less than the holy spirit it's a life of Christ in us and we talked about perfection and we talked about freedom and we talked about light and we talked about fearlessness but I want to take it to another direction again this morning and we're talking about this charity we're talking about what the Holy Ghost is and what it does and I want to take a a thought this morning on you shall find rest amen you shall find rest and we know that the nature of the holy spirit is rest and I want to walk you through the scriptures mostly this morning and then on the next service maybe we'll go more into the quote side of things but I want to just set a foundation for this thought on rest and you shall find rest this morning and if we go back into Isaiah chapter 28 it says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine he says it's them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast now we know that that's what babies eat so you can stay where it's easy and you can stay where everything's provided or you can step up into where a place where it's a little bit more difficult where you've got to eat more solid food you've got to chew your food it doesn't maybe slide down our throat so easily it's not quite so easy to digest and to work into our system but he says that's what it's going to take to move into what he's talking about in Isaiah 28 amen we've got to be able to take what God has for us we've got to be able to grow as he provides and ask us to do these different things and we have to come into maturity and you'll find with the believer it's a willful maturity we've got to be willing to move forward amen we've got to be willing to take a little more work to get our nutrition because it's at a higher level and it'll take us to a greater place he says for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little it's not fast but it's simple amen it's just a little bit every day it's a little bit of growth it's a little bit of maturing it's a little bit of the word becoming real to you we'll see as we go through this amen but it's also a little bit of letting go every day it's a little bit of trusting every day it's a little bit more believing every day amen and it's that little steps as we talked about last service that's little steps every day get you further than one big step occasionally amen it's that day after day after day and what Isaiah is talking about here and it's the Lord speaking is he's speaking of the word amen the word feeds and grows us and it's a little bit by a little bit amen we don't tend to take big leaps those are circumstances and those are experiences we have with God but every day is not that way every day it's just a little bit here and a little bit there but then he says for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to the people so catch this now this is looking to the Future where there's going to be a supernatural event and he says you'll recognize the event by what happens with the way that the people are talking and he says it's going to be stammering lips and it's going to be with with with unkown another tongue that he speaks to the people and watch what he says this is he says this event not the tongues not the language but this event he says to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing he says yet they would not hear he's looking forward to the future he says there's a rest coming he tells them how they're going to know it's there and then he says but they won't accept it it's an amazing thing that everything they're looking for is coming they have a sign of what is going to be and yet he says they're going to turn it down amen he says they're not going to Hear It They'll they'll reject it but I want to focus on two words here in verse 12 he says that this is the rest and then he says this is the refreshing so the rest means a resting place and a quietness but I want you to see that refreshing means rest Repose and a place to rest so rest is a place to rest and refreshing is a place to rest amen Isaiah says there's a there's a rest that's coming to the weary and it will also cause a refresh refeshing so there's a rest that comes first and there's a refreshing that comes after it amen first we're weary and that word weary means faint exhausted tired out and that's us before the New Birth man that's what we are we're working we're weary amen sometimes we don't even realize how worn out we are and then we come and we realize we've been carrying a burden you know Paul bunan wrote that book Pilgrims Progress remember and he didn't realize the burden that was there until he started walking and as soon as he went on a journey he realized what that burden was and it wasn't until he came to Calvary that he lost that burden but Calvary is not the new birth that's just the starting point he says there's a rest that comes after all of that that's not the rest that's a relief but it's not the rest that we're talking about and even as professing Christians we're believing unto something until we get the new birth and there's a weariness that can come with that because you're believing unto something but you don't have it you're trusting the word of God you're expressing your faith in the word of God you're living by the word of God but you don't have that reality inside of you yet until you get the Holy Ghost and that can be wearing that can be tiring because you're believing for something you don't yet have and that's the the work the labor so often for the professing Christian and we'll see even for the real Christian is that we're believing for something we don't have and we can get tired and we can get worn and we can get depressed and we can get all these things as we're waiting for what we're believing for amen but then the new birth comes and that's when we're first at rest see first we experience rest that's the first thing that comes is rest is you finally get what you've been believing for all of this time and as soon as you do it you have rest why because it's a sealed work it's a finished work brother Brandon would teach us that that Holy Ghost when you get that Holy Ghost it's done it's done your soul is sealed to the day of redemption and you don't have to worry anymore so there's a rest on your soul right there but we know that once the soul is sealed there's still a work that has to go on in in the spirit and In the Flesh and there's a rest that has to be able to come and progress throughout your body throughout your your nature throughout your personality and these things and that's the refreshing that's going to come after that as we'll see as we go through amen but the first times it comes as a rest and it changes our attitude it changes our approach it changes our Outlook and we can finally go and you you just let your load off and you just you're you're so the F when you first get the Holy Ghost it's an exper I don't even know how to explain it but you're just satisfied and it's like you're content it's like you don't have a worry in the world but then worries come don't they and works come and and struggles come and labors come and Trials come and that's why we need not just a rest but we need a refreshing that comes after the rest amen this this this taste that we get the new birth the Holy Ghost on us that first in filling it gives us a taste of rest to know what is available to know what is possible to the believer on a daily basis amen because brother Ron would say he says there's one infilling but there's many refilling that means there's a rest and then there's a bringing back to rest that's available to the believer amen when we're at rest we're at peace and we're satisfied we're content we're quiet we're relaxed we're not or harassed nothing is is bothering us when we're at rest somebody's that that's at rest doesn't want to be brought out of resten if there's anything I would want to do it's rest that's what we're seeking is it is rest amen but then Isaiah says there's going to be a refreshing that follows this rest now that refresh means anything you put re in front of means make what you had again so refresh means I'll make you fresh again I'll make it like it was the first time I'll give you the experience of the first time amen and you you used to be fresh you used to be energetic those of us that are not young anymore we're tired now and then we work and we work and we work and then what do we do we rest every night and we wake up and we're refreshed we're ready to go again we're rejuvenated we have the energy that we had the day before but the problem in this flesh is that we lose a little bit every night we wake up and it's infant in infantes smal it it's just a tiny bit less but every day we lose a little bit of what we've got and we wake up and we say well I'm ready to go but we can do a little bit less every day than we did the day before why cuz this body is dying it's going away but what Isaiah is saying is that after this rest comes there's a refreshing that's always available to the believer amen it's a place of Refuge a place where you can be at peace and rest and you can charge up again amen and there's no limit to the refreshing you know what I love I love finger foods you know I love the brisket brother B Matt makes and I love burgers and that but I love when it's just a bunch of little things that you can just go take all the time they call them Refreshments don't they because you can eat them all day long I love Refreshments but I love refreshing and man when I go hunting for 5 days and I come back and I haven't showered yet you know what's refreshing a shower just to get cleaned up again you know brother bam talks about he says that scoured out feeling the first time God does a work and and he cleans out your life that scoured out feeling and you know what happens is sometimes we don't get we don't stay quite so clean and then what happens is we get an evangelist roll through or maybe the pastor shifts out of his regular gift and he preaches an Evangel Evangelical sermon and what happens is it brings what a sweeping of the holy spirit in and it scours us out again and we get to feel again what we felt the first time he cleansed us of our sins then Jesus talked about we're walking through life that's why we wash our feet only because we walk through a dirty world and things dirty us up sometimes we need that scouring up but you have to get the first one before you can get the ones that follow behind it that keep you because you know what that feeling is amen it's like the vehicles they have today we've got plug in hybrids and electric vehicles and guess what they run out of battery but all you have to do is plug them in overnight and the next morning they got everything they've always had and you can go on a trip again that's what's available to the believer if you've ever gotten it it's always available again amen you remember David said restore to me the joy of my salvation he hadn't lost his salvation but he lost the joy that accompanied it and sometimes that's all we need is we need the feeling of what we actually have we need feelings we we need to know we need to be have things associated with us so that we know that God's with us but it's not in the feelings but don't lose the feelings anden I know my wife loves me but God help me if I don't feel like she loves me that's when trouble's going to happen isn't it I've got to feel that she loves me not just know it but there's something that comes with it amen so there's available to a Believer not just a rest but a refreshing a restoring to that rest on a daily basis and Isaiah says it's going to come through a supernatural experience and we know that was what that was and it's in Acts 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance notice this is inspired speaking not desired speaking because you can have a gift of tongues and you can choose to use that or not use that we had a sister back in Texas she would go into a prayer closet she could speak in tongues anytime she wanted she'd pray in tongues that was that was a gift that God had given her and that was subject to her like every gift is it's subject to the spirit of the Prophet it's subject to the person that it's on but this is not that but rather as the holy spirit gives these people the ability to speak then they would speak in unknown tongues and they would speak in tongues so they would speak in unknown languages meaning speaking a Heavenly language and then they would also speak in unknown languages that they were never taught so you might have had you know a Jew and he's speaking Persian and another one Speaking Greek and they never went to school and learned it but as the Holy Spirit fell on them they were able to speak and share the gospel to those that are around them that are from different countries and and know different languages it says in verse 5 and there were there dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and they were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language so these people are going around they've received the infil of the Holy Ghost and they're walking around and they're sharing what's going on with all these people and then everyone comes together and they say are you hearing what I'm hearing yes I'm hearing what you're hearing well how come you can hear it and I can hear it at the same time and they're only speaking once it's the holy ghost moving in the people what is it they were yielded to the holy spirit for the first time in their lives amen and this is Isaiah 28 being fulfilled to the letter stammering tongues and in another language amen and they don't actually know what they're doing they understand the effect but they don't know how it's happening inside of their lives they've never been taught how to do these things but under the anointing of the Holy Spirit they're literally preaching the gospel they're speaking the gospel they're sharing what's happening they're sharing that it's Isaiah 28 they're sharing that it's Joel 2 as Peter starts to tell them about and they're saying this is what he's talking about not the tongues the Holy Ghost how do we get the Holy Ghost we listen to what Christ said he said go up in a room and stay there until you're endued with power from on high this is it this is what it's all been talking about this is the rest that Isa spoke about it's not speaking in tongues that's not it it amazes me that Pentecost is so focused on speaking in tongues because it's very clear here that the speaking in tongues is not the rest it's the Holy Ghost that's the rest anden the rest for the believer is the holy spirit in us doing the works of God Amen the rest is when we're filled with the spirit and yielded to the spirit so that he can work through US amen it's the Dynamics making the mechanics work because remember you've been built up by the word precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little it's like an engine that they build and they put into a car they build it up bit by bit piece by bit stage by stage and they put it in the car and everything's perfect but brother Braham says you've got to put gasoline in there to make it run they've been taught by Jesus for three and a half years they've been given the word they've been told what to do and then he says go and wait because if you try and use it of your own will you'll make a mistake and we see they did it up in the upper room room cuz they picked the wrong disciple Christ chose Paul later and they chose mitias I believe brother BR would say he said they were up there and they're said well surely we have it now and they said no we'll know when we have it because it matches what the word says it's going to look like amen we can't go by by emotions we can't go by feelings we have to go by what the the word says our our experience is supposed to be amen and we see here that they were at total rest even when their lives their health their welfare their reputation uh their livelihoods whatever it was whatever was put in Jeopardy it didn't matter we see Peter Peter was two-faced Peter was a coward before this and as soon as he gets the Holy Ghost he comes out and he starts preaching the gospel and he won't shut up no matter what they do Peter goes to jail he gets hauled in front of the priesthood he gets hauled in front of the magistrate he gets whipped he gets beaten he gets put in jail they're going to kill him Nothing Stops Peter why cuz he's at rest he's at rest he's received the rest of the holy spirit inside of his life he's lost his worries he's lost his fears Peter is no longer concerned about self-preservation he's completely lost all fear amen all he cared about was what was going on inside of him and all he was doing was being yielded to the holy spirit amen brother Brown would say this and why are people so tossed about he says the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest he says that's right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss fume and worry about things a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary he says that's right oh sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has promised arrest is not looking at circumstances it's looking at the god that's behind the circumstances that says my grace is sufficient for thee knowing that that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's not starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're at rest he said Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to The Anchor Holds now Paul would take us over in Hebrews 4 and he starts to expand on this thought of rest because Jesus only gives a couple of verses about rest and then Paul comes the anointed messenger for the age and he starts to show us what this full rest really looks like and we have today people that are f focused on the Sabbath you'll see of course the Jews are but even like the seventh day Venice and they'll say well that's his rest that's the day of rest but Paul takes us there and he says no no no the rest for the believer the Sabbath for the believer is the Holy Ghost it's your position it's your placing in Christ amen and so Paul would say in Hebrews 4 he says let us therefore fear that doesn't mean fear like be worried it says be careful lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it to fall short of it to be in want to be destitute of this rest in other words to not be at rest he says if it's available be careful that you don't you you never come into it he says For unto us was the Gospel preached as well is unto them but the word preached did not profit them why I was listening to brother bradam yesterday morning he was said you'll hear the same word as the one next to you and you'll get it and they won't the preaching of the word is not what makes the difference it's the hearing of the word that makes the difference you got to hear it you got to accept it you got to believe it he says it didn't profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard so in other words if you don't believe what you hear it won't do you any good it's God's grace that gives us Faith to recognize it the first time whenever that first time is people can hear the word many times but when God finally quickens it to their heart it's his grace that gives them Faith to believe it and accept it and act on it amen if you believe the words I'm preaching it'll have an effect if you don't believe the words I'm preaching it won't have an effect it has nothing to do with me it has everything to do with if God quickens it to you now I'm going to read this quote it says there's a reason your pastor can't do nothing for you you've got to have faith in him and confidence in him as a man of God point one but watch what he says and know that all things work together for good to them that love God you got to have confidence in the god behind the man not just confidence in the man you got to trust that God's working no matter what because I'm going to fail you I'm going to disappoint you but God's the one that you're looking to not to me he says that's right but I know this you've got to have confidence in the man you're dealing with or won't you do you any good to do any dealing that's true you've got to believe your pastor now he's talking about brother Neville now he says he's a good god- saved man preaching the gospel stand behind him with everything you've got but he says if he isn't go somewhere where they do do it he says that's right now that clears it up for both sides now remember this if he preaches the gospel stay with him help him cuz he's a man sent from God ordained of God to feel your feed your soul I'm not saying this to prop myself up I'm saying if you don't have confidence that I'm supposed to be here I won't do you any good and that has nothing to do with me and nothing to do with you that's just the way it is listen you're here not someplace else and if God has led you here then God is God is obligated to feed you here but you can't say God led me here but God isn't feeding me here it doesn't work that way because the grace of God will always keep you wherever he takes you amen so if you're not being fed here don't go find another Ministry go to God and say Lord where will I get fed that's the key the key is is not just to up and leave the key is to say Lord where is my pastor Lord where is the ministry that's going to feed me that's all that's needed and then when you go then God go with you we've had many people leave here wonderful Believers and we Lov them while they were here and then they moved on not what is it God leads each one and he leads them to a place where they can feed if they're sincere in their seeking amen and they go and they Thrive and it's a wonderful thing I'm not meant for everyone I've been I've been in other ministers under other ministers or been in other churches and services and I I would sit there and say I don't think I could sit under this man all the time that's okay he wasn't meant for me but don't don't put down the people that sit under his ministry either CU if he's feeding them that's what matters that's all that matters in these things amen but coming back to what Paul said he says for we which have believed do enter into rest amen we've got to have faith in the word it says as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world so catch this thought now he's saying it's already been decided who's going to get the rest who's going to come into a place of rest and who will accept it and who won't accept it amen and it's not based on natural family or Ministry or church or lineage or anything of this it's based on the foreordained predestinated thoughts of God Amen because what all that came out of Israel were not Israel all that came out of Israel were not Abraham's seed and we know that only two of the original group went into the promised land they all came out but only two went in and God said they're not all going in but notice now our rest is in the fact that it's a finished work from the foundation of the world Amen the rest is on the basis that he's already decided it he's already declared it he's already made a path for it as I said before like brother Hank Snow said the the the film's already done and we you just got to walk through it it's already there the pictures already been taken amen it's not on the basis of performance that I'm going to make it to Heaven I'll make it because I'm a part of his word and he already declared that I'm going to make it amen there it's not just you and I as individuals but the even the path that we're on is is the plan of God it's the works of God and he took all of his plans and he put them into this and he showed us what it's going to look like so we can have faith as we hit the way points that we in his will cuz it matches up with the experience that the word says we're going to have just like Joel 228 just like Isaiah 28 just like they had in Acts 2 we can go and we can say it's God because his word is meeting up injunctions of my life and I can see what he's doing amen we mess up we make mistakes we step back we get out of shape and it doesn't phase God one bit not one bit you know who it does it phases you and I cuz we think somehow we're going to hold God back and we can't it's a finished work that's our rest as that it's a finished work no matter what I do if I'm great if I'm good then that's great but if I'm not so great it's not going to change God's work it's already a finished work and that's the rest amen and we we we sit there and we we do something we ought not to we think something we react the way we don't and what do we do we think we're going to stop God and we pull back and we cringe away and we we don't go to him in prayer and we we think he's so mad at us or he's so disappointed in us he's sitting there saying son daughter what are you worried about I've already made you over there you're already there you're not going to stop it the only thing you're hurting is Yourself by pulling away you just have to come back and make it right that's it that's all there's nothing to lose here there is a place of rest and brother Bram in studying this and for the sake of time I didn't put all these quotes in but he said the rest is there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ that you can do something and he we read the last service where he said there's an atonement there there's a price paid and you go back to the price paid and say I'm sorry and I'm claiming the price paid and you are put back to right where you were before you never moved in his eyes because he sees you through the blood you only moved in your eyes your repentance is as much a restoration of you to your position than anything in your own eyes cuz you never you never moved it never moved out of it in God's eyes cuz he's seeing you through the blood it's a finished work amen God's already decided we're going to make it over there it's already done so it not to face us because it doesn't face him brother says this he says God himself came down in the form of a lamb don't look at yourself God don't look at you he looks at the lamb he looks at Christ and there was no fault in him and God accepted the offering you put your hand upon the lamb Christ Jesus confess your sins as being a sinner and the lamb has died for you the spirit that comes out of the Lamb comes back to the believer amen he says and you stand perfected because the one who died the innocent one the powerful one the overcoming one the accepted one in his own person returned in the form of the Holy Ghost and brings the believer into rest he says there it is it's not you him God don't even see you he sees him you don't have to die he died in your place he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed there's the foundation we're coming into the idea of rest and he says don't look to yourself he's the innocent one he's the powerful one he's the overcoming one he's the accepted one that's your rest in is that he's what everything God required and when he's in you then you're everything that God expects that's your rest amen the Lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world the Book of Revelation says and therefore the price was paid and so your righteousness your peace your joy Your Grace your mercy whatever we have need of is guaranteed and provided under the atonement that was finished before you ever came into existence that's our rest amen it's part and parcel with the finished work of Calvary Paul continues he says for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again he says if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter there in I'm glad that he said there some are going to enter in he said some aren't going to take it most are going to refuse it but some are going to take it he says and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief now he's pointing to the type and Shadow of Israel coming up to the Canaan land they left Egypt they went through justification they walked around the desert sanctification then they come up to the to the promised land and they refus to go into the land of promise why because they disbelieve what what God said because they were looking at themselves relative to the competition they disbelieved because they were so looking at themselves that they couldn't see the promise of God even though everything over there was exactly as God described they ignored the blessings and looked at what who was going to try and hold them back and they said we can't do it and they disbelieved the promises of God Amen and because they're looking at themselves they limit the effect of God in their lives and they never got anywhere with it and they died in the wilderness they died in their sins amen then in verse 7 he says again he limited limith a certain day saying in in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts the scripture says God won't always strive with men but while he's striving there's Mercy there's Grace there's opportunity in these things amen God terries and waits far longer than we ever would his mercies are new Every Morning amen he his desires that All Flesh would be saved God wants to preserve life but there comes a day where he turns it down and you don't want to be here when he says the door is closed cuz after that all that's left is judgment and that's tribulation and you know what tribulation looks like tribulation is a time when everybody wants to die and they can't that's how bad it's going to be we don't want to be over there it says for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so in other words he's saying if if Christ had given them rest through their Sabbath why would even spoken of another rest amen it was just a shadow of what was coming in verse 9 he says there therefore remain there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God so in other words there's a different rest than the Sabbath there's a different rest than the law there's a different rest than I've done everything the law told me to do cuz in the end they didn't Jesus came and he says you can you can say you didn't do it but if you even think about doing it it's the same as if you did it and then all of a sudden we're like well in their Hearts they knew then that they were condemned even if they' never acted on lusting after a woman he says you thought after her and it's the same as you thought about doing it and so it's the same as doing it your your thoughts are not Sanctified so you're in sin before God and therefore you have to die outside of a shed blood but brother R would say this he says here is the rest in the message it says he picks up the Bible it says this is the rest that you can cause the weary to rest he says this is it amen it'll be precept upon precept and line upon line in other words you don't just get this rest but God builds you up to this Rest by what letting you see what's available in his word he lets you read his word he lets you believe his word he lets you have faith in his word he lets you act on his word and then what he comes is he vindicates his word in you amen the word of God brings you to the promises of the word which is Christ in you that that's the whole goal of all this is to get Christ in you and then Jesus stood in front of them and they turned down the word in flesh and then today brother Braham says the Holy Ghost comes and they turn it down because they don't want it in their flesh but it's got to be the same thing he said here is the rest what is the Holy Ghost the rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest what is he he is the one that comes in you and gives you peace he's your sign you're comforter you're comforted you're at rest you're sealed he says it's a sign the world knows something has happened to you what is it it's a comforter what is it a seal you're at rest it's your Advocate if something happens to you there's something there to make an advocate for you right quick see it's making intercessions it's the spirit of the Living God in the church prophesied exactly what it would be when it come he says it will be an everlasting Eternal rest so this is not a temporary thing this is not just a a have it now and gone tomorrow type thing amen but this is the original rest amen it's life in Christ that's what he's talking about he says it's the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus said come unto me and learn of me because it's precept upon precept you got to come to Christ you got to sit under the word and the word leads you to Christ himself in other words it leads you to the Life of Christ himself and he's talking about and what he's making here is a reference to how they teach a young Ox to pull a load and they partner it up with a mature one a well-trained one a powerful one that knows how to pull a load and so a young Ox can pull I I preached on this at brother John Andes a little over a year ago and a young Ox can pull 2,000 lb roughly a mature Ox can pull 5,000 cuz he knows how to do it but you take that mature one and you put him with a young one and let them work together and he'll bring that young one up to a 5,000lb limit he'll give him two and a half times more pulling power than he had before just by teaching them how to move just by teaching them how to walk how to place his feet how to set his shoulders into the Yoke the younger learns from the older and that learning makes them more effective because what they're leaning they're yielding to what that other one has to say work harder not work smarter not harder is what this is about you can sit there and you can pull all day but if you don't know how to pull you're not going to move it in the old in the old days back in up in Alaska and whatnot they used dogs to to pull sledges and they taught the dogs how to break them out cuz when the sledges the sleds were were on the ice and they'd leave them overnight and they'd freeze and so they teach the dogs to yank right and then they'd yank left and yank right and yank left and it would break the runners free so that the slides could go but if they never taught the dogs how to do that those dogs could pull a load that they could otherwise pull and they'd never get it moving they had to teach him how to get it moving once they got it moving it went a lot easier but they had to teach him how to break those things out and this is what's Happening Here amen is he says you got to get yolked up and you know what a yoke does it takes away your Independence see now you're tied in with something you can't move independently Christ is saying you can't do this on your own the road you're walking the load you're pulling the battle you're fighting you can't do this on your own you got to come to a place where you say I can't do it because he says you've got to come to me and yield to my yoke I'm not just going to slap it on you I'm not going to lassu you and pull you up and force you into it but he says you got to come to me and say I'm willing to try your way cuz I've been doing my way and it's not working so I'm going to go your way now cuz youve said your load's light mine's too heavy for me to pull but if I'm with you you said it's going to be light if I can do it amen what do we do we've got to be able to lay down everything we've got and say Lord you teach me cuz my pulling ain't working so I've got to step into your yoke amen we've got to learn we've got to listen we've got to grow wisdom Revelation amen come to a place where we say Lord I've tried so hard on my own and I have nothing to show for it now I'm willing to try your way that's the place where God wants us to be amen you know what happens we get sick and tired of being sick and tired anybody ever feel that way where you're going you're going you're going You're trying you know whether it's our our businessmen and they're putting in quotes and proposals and quotes and proposals and nothing's coming in and we're burning ourselves out trying to get business rather than saying Lord you provide I'm going to settle down I'm going to settle down and trust you you give me leadership of where to put my time where to put my effort and I'll trust you to bring the bacon home every day we're trying for a promotion at work whether it could be anything it can be for our health it can be for weight it can be whatever we're going through and say Lord I need you because I've tried and I've tried and I've tried and nothing's working nothing sticks nothing holds amen there's a place of rest there's a place of refreshing amen when we get sick and tired of being sick and tired that's a great place to let go and let God have his way amen rest comes when we lay it down you know if you ever tried to lay down with a backpack on doesn't work you just go to one side or the other and it's pulling on you this way or that but if you can take the load off and lay it aside now you can have rest you can sit down you can lay down and everything's nice and comfy but we've got to lay it down and it comes with laying down our ambition it comes down with laying down our wisdom our education our knowledge our need for control whatever it might be our way of doing things and saying Lord I'm going to let you do it remember we spoke last service where Paul said forgetting those things that are behind letting them go he says that's how we progress and we get towards the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus Paul continues he says for he that has entered into his rest he also ha ceased from his own works as God did from his amen his own works and I want to spend some time on this for the last half of this service because this is the key to this whole thing about rest amen is about what is ceasing from your own Works amen we've got to stop we've got to let go of how we want things done we got to let go of what we want to come out of it even sometimes we're so insistent on how it comes out and God's saying but that's not the way I've ordained it we want everybody in we want everyone a certain way I said last service we're not carbon copies our walk is not the the the Walk of the person next to us the way we get there is not always the same but it's up to God to do of his good pleasure amen it's up to God to do his good will it's for us to pull back and say Lord I'm just going to let you lead me amen we'll start with another scripture in Hebrews 61 Paul says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection that's charity that's the Holy Ghost he says not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God now we think dead works is what we did before everything before we became a professing Christian brother says that's not it at all listen to this quote he says we believe that there's a baptism we believe in the resurrection of the Dead absolutely we believe Jesus died and rose again we believe that laying on the hands for the sick that's what it said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover he says we believe that but what is that Paul said it's all dead works why because it's something that you do dead works is something you do he says now let's go on to Perfection he says oh my work coming into the Tabernacle now not the foundation the Tabernacle itself that's the foundation the law and righteousness and joining church and being baptized and lay on of hands those are all orders of the church but he says but now let us go into Perfection and there's only one that's perfected that's Jesus I've said this before Judas did everything brother brandham just talked about he laid hands on the sick and they recovered he cast out demons he went to church he was associated with Christ he was baptized he he did all of those things amen but he said there's only one one way to get into Perfection and that's to come into Christ and that's when the word is made flesh inside of you by the Holy Spirit and Judas stopped short of that why because he tried to control the situation amen there'll many be many that hear this message sit in a message church and never go in a Rapture why because they love the letter but they don't love the spirit because the spirit would force them to lay down something that they don't want to lay down they want control and so they refuse to yield they want results and so they refuse to take their hands off the wheel right they want a reputation and so they refuse to Humble themselves and God can't do that God can't work with that and what is it they're literally shutting out the spirit because they love the letter there's a lot to love about the letter of this message it's a tremendous message intellectually it's tremendous the when the word is opened and the understanding is there it's an amazing thing to see the word as it was meant to be seen but it still kills if you don't have the spirit to make it live inside of you amen it's all dead works and people will do things in in in his name and all these things but it's dead Works unless he knows you unless he has an intimate relationship with you Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 12 he says for as the body is one and had many members and all that members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ so he says Christ is the body of Christ that that mystical Body of Christ as brother Brown would call it's all different parts but it's all one unified body you look at your hand I've got fingers but even my fingers aren't the same I've got five fingers here there of different lengths different strengths different purposes then I go over here and they're the same but they're not the same because they're in another place then we've got all of our organs we've got our skin we've got our muscles and they're all different he says they're all different don't try and be the same but you still have to be unified you still have to be able to work together and sometimes our differences are the things that are separating us rather than drawing us together like I said in the in the last service or two it's our it's our strengths that ought to bring us together not our weaknesses that hold us apart Amen Brother Paul's got things I don't have but I've got things that brother Paul doesn't have but that doesn't mean he puts me out or I put him out because of what we don't have but we can Fellowship together because he strengthens me where I'm weak and I strengthen him where he's weak because we're part of this big body and together we can do more amen so that's what's happening now is the unifying of the Saints under a five-fold Ministry it's the perfecting of the Saints until we come into the unity of the faith which is the rapture that's the one thing we're all looking for amen but he says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body we're speaking on you shall find rest now he says for by one Spirit are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit brother says by the Holy Spirit baptism we're baptized into that body and are free from sin that means I don't bring it up about you and you don't bring it up about me either Braham says if you bring it out from under the blood you're responsible for it he says God don't see you no more he only sees Christ and when you're in that body God can't judge that body he's already judged it he took our judgments and invited us in and by faith through Grace we walk and accept our pardoning and the Holy Spirit brings us into this fellowship with him he says and we walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit quickened the word came to us he died in my stead and I made alive here I am who was once dead in sin and trespasses be made alive now watch the effect this is rest he says all my desires is to serve him all my love is to him all my walks want to be in his name that wherever I go where whatever I do I glorify him now listen to what he says here he doesn't say if I'm preaching if I'm baptizing if I'm fellowshipping he says if I'm hunting if I'm fishing if I'm playing ball whatever I'm doing I must be Christ in me in such a life that will make men long to be that way not tattling backbiting and fing fussing about your churches you get it in the fun times as well as the serious times it's still got to be Christ in me wherever I go it ought to make people salty I ought to be salty to make people thirsty for what's inside of me brother BR would continue in another message he says that's how by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and are at rest he says oh what can the world do that's where we lose our rest so often as we look at what the world can do well I can lose my job I can lose my health I can lose my finances I can lose my reputation people are going to make fun of me people won't accept me take my home it's getting to the point where they're going to be able to take our children that's what they did in the first acts didn't they pull people out separated them killed them said but for you know for your sake we're killed all the day long but he says what can the world do when you're at rest in Christ what can the world do if I go today it'll be the happiest day of my life but we say well brother John you're going to be suffering you're going to be this what can the world do if I'm at rest in Christ if I know I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption he said I'm so glad God got a hold of me before the church did with all of its Doctrine I found a resting place all that sweet Abiding Place where there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that's found Eternal rest you can't rest when you're working amen and Paul's trying to get us to see that you'll stop from from doing those dead works when you recognize that what you can achieve has no Eternal value what you can achieve on your own is nothing for God you can't do it you can't do it that scripture I referred to so many times they'll say to him in the end and they say did not we do this and that and I I'll do many wonderful works in your name he says no get away from me I never knew you it didn't add up to a hill of beans in the end it's not that it didn't do anything it's that it had no Eternal purpose in the kingdom of God anden the greatest limitation in my life is me I don't care how smart I am I don't care how disciplined I am I don't care how hard I work how hard I study the greatest limitation I have is me because compared to God I'm nothing I if this was a scale of me to God I'm not even on the surface I'm embedded in the surface I'm nothing compared to him that's the greatest thing as a Believer we have to recognize is that compared to him we bring nothing to the table that's why we've got to die so that Christ can live in me amen when you come into him the works are not just greater but they're lasting and they have real purpose they have real benefit brother says anybody can be wrong he says you don't know he says I Die daily from my wrongs and try to live before Christ that's all we can do Die daily and try and live before him he says and anybody that's big enough and got enough spirit of God to walk up and admit their wrong and say I want the right thing he said I've got a lot of confidence right there for that's truly Abraham's seed they want to know it you'll cease from your dead works when you realize that this is a work of his choosing not yours see what happens is we think we're making the choices we're making the decisions we're making things happen you know what was so wonderful about sister Leah's healing the other day had nothing to do with me nothing to do with me I didn't pray for her I didn't lay hands on her and I had no clue what was happening sister Leah why because he does all things well and the thing is you know what sister Leah learned that day that she doesn't have to come to Brother John for prayer he touched her I didn't touch you I didn't do a thing you know what she said she said I'm going to church no matter what and God recognized her faith and healed her supernaturally right there in her seat he did it that's a Vindication of your faith sister Leah and has nothing to do with me nothing to do with me I couldn't have made that happen if I wanted to couldn't have made it happen if I wanted to but God comes down and he touches her right there where she's sitting why because faith comes by hearing amen that's all it is it's so simple it's so simple and then the sovereignty of God moves in and something happens that is completely Supernatural and she can walk out a free woman completely healed amen what a wonderful thing it is when we realize this is his doing not mine I didn't choose him he chose me I didn't reach out to him he reached out to me he called me he ordained me he predestinated me this is all him amen it it reminded me as I was I was studying this you know we have these the these little parks for our kids and you ever see they've got the the cars there and they have a steering wheel and it's a steering wheel that you can spin forever and the kids go in there and they turn it or they'll spin it they'll spin it they'll spin it but what happens to the front wheels nothing cuz it's not connected sometimes we're like little children we're in there and and we're playing with our lives and we're making this and we're doing that and making decisions and I'm going to affect this and I'm going to affect that and all it is is we're at the park and God's sitting there laughing at us because the wheel doesn't work that we've got in our hands cuz why we're already ordained to make it and all we do is change our circumstance a little bit we change our attitude a little bit but it doesn't change the big picture the car ain't going anywhere cuz God's in control it's brother Mark's fond say run a boat to China and you can do all you want but the boat's going to go to China no matter what you say no matter what you do whether you like it whether you don't whether you appreciate it whether you don't it doesn't change a thing the boat's going to China and you're going to make it cuz you're on that boat amen God's got the whole thing already ordained it's already figured out it's already planned in all our little turns and stops and indecisions and failures and faults they don't have a a single thing to do with whether we're going to make it or not brother Bram says this he says that's the way it is in any life it takes God it isn't what you do it's what God does see you say I sought God I sought God you're mistaken no man seeks God God seeks the man see it's not you seeking God it's God seeking you Jesus said you haven't chosen me but I chose you see you were chosen before the foundation of the world or you weren't chosen at all he just came to redeem that name and all whose names are on that Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world are the only ones going to be there anyhow see he says you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world we're talking you shall find rest this is the Keystone Revelation for the believer is that you're all there as far as God's concerned it's a finished work and youve got to come into the same place he said when the lamb was chosen when you were chosen with him before the foundation he says and you are as I said last night an attribute of God's thinking see that's the only way you can be Eternal and the only form of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God so that's all he's the one that's Eternal he says now we find out that the seal means that it is a finished work with God it's already settled and every believer was sealed with this promise from the very beginning because before the foundation of the world we were predestinated unto the adoption of sons before the world ever began he says oh what a hope that makes us steadfast and sure church when things aren't going right when it things seems like things are going all wrong when it seems like you can't get anywhere you need to come back to this thought that he said I'm going to make it he wrote my name in that book and he's calling the names out and this is the time for the Redemption and the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God that's the reminder we need to have that's the rest that's the refreshing is that he said I'm going to make it and he's going to make my life produce it he'll bring us subject to what the word has already said about us he said an anchor to the soul that's not tossed about here and there but it's Anchored In Christ to hope that sure he said he's predestinated us before the foundation of of the world to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ he says oh how wonderful I love that it's a finished work with God God's not worried and if we're in Christ then why are we worried if he's satisfied it's done then why are we unsatisfied why are we out of rest why are we unwell why are we worried it's a finished work that's the rest is it's a finished work so understanding that what is our labor cuz Paul said you got a labor to get into this rest what is is our labor what is our work what is our striving to do let go of the wheel let go of the wheel and trust God Amen get into Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and let him take control and Trust his leading trust his provision TR trust his guidance trust his goodness trust his Fellowship trust his feeding Paul said in Hebrews 4 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and many he's talking about in Israel you come so far and then you stop because you won't let go you know when in our in our life today Labor what why do we labor food on the table roof over our head vehicle in the driveway closeth on our back and then we labor all the more to pay off the mortgage to maybe get a vacation now and again to be able to retire hopefully before we're 65 or 70 and have some comfort and ease of Life as we close things out I was reading on CBC there that they said people are laboring now just to survive they're working two and three jobs 18 hours a day six and seven days a week just to pay their bills and some of them are barely making it one man said I go I cry myself to sleep at night cuz he's striving to make it that's not our labor Church remember what we said he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be add to he says you're father knows what you have need of he says he knows you know you need all of these things everything you have need of he knows you need it but he says seek Him First and everything else will be taken care of listen I I've shared the story how Blanc and I came to church and we were $10 in the negative I think or a dollar in the negative on our bank account and we had a an an insurance bill coming out the next morning that was going to be $100 and we had no money and there was no way of making it and of course then you get ding and you go into overdraft and then they charge you $35 for that we were poor students had no money nothing and we prayed before service Lord we need the $100 to make our our insurance payment and after service brother Bob handed me an envelope and I opened it it was a check for $110 and it was a rebate that had been owed to us and he'd been holding our mail since we've been in Halifax God knew all along now we could freak out we could get worried we could be we could sit there and not hear a word that brother Gerald preached or we could go in and say say Lord we're trusting you that you know we have need of this and so not only did we do that but we went and we went we we we paid our bill and then we were able to go to Mary Browns and get a 10 piece for $9.99 and it was a good day and then we're down to a cent or 10 cents in our bank account but all our bills are paid so what do we need to worry about he owns the cattle on a thousand hills I've shared the testimony I've never missed a day at church to study for an exam didn't mean I got straight A's but I passed every exam Church do I get jobs because of my grades do I get jobs because I'm a an amazing person I believe I've gotten jobs because God has opened the door he's our provider I find favor where no one else finds favor I've worked in companies where I felt that my coworker deserved it more than I did and my boss couldn't stand him just couldn't get along with them they were constantly butting heads and and the guy who was that my boss bunny hwith was a was a calm quiet easygoing guy like everybody liked him and somehow he could never please my boss they just never seem to work out and yet I walk wal in I'm not a Texan I'm in Texas right I'm a northerner right Yankee and I get along great with him and I get promotion after promotion and bonus and recognition after recognition why God's grace nothing I did my buddy was just as talented harder working many times did a great job and God gave me favor God provides amen we're not getting there because of our Perfection we don't have what we have because we're such hard workers or we're so smart or intelligent or educated we have them as Believers because God has given us what we have need of amen and as we honor him he honors us that's just the way it works and I can say that in every aspect of my life when I've given up opportunity he comes back and he gives me more than I would have ever gotten because he meets my spiritual needs and He blesses me naturally as well but my rest is not in the natural I've given up great jobs and I've taken lower pain jobs and I've done the the dirt work and I've done the fun work and it doesn't matter in it all Christ is with me because what I put him first amen you young people as you're searching these things and these different ones recognize that he's the one that's going to provide he's the one that's going to lead he's the one that's going to get you where you need to go and without him it'll be pointless anyways cuz you won't have a bit of contempt you won't have a bit of contentment Paul says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest what he said don't be like the children of Israel don't don't let the sight of what's coming hold you back from the promise that's attached to it don't let the battle that's coming keep you back from what's beyond that battle the victory that's there amen don't let circumstances or hardships hold you back your rest is not in your skills or gifts your rest is that he's called you to go there and he's wrote your name on the deed for that piece of property and you can go get it cuz he's with you he goes ahead of you the captain of the host is with you brother says this he says you have an intellectual conception you have a theological experience but when it comes to a time that you really when you really find the real thing you just sell out everything else and you close yourself to this Paul knew what it was he found out that he was harnessed to something like we put a horse in a harness it's to pull something and Paul knew after this experience and three and a half of typing the experience he had with the Bible he realized that God had chosen him and had harmonized him by the Holy Spirit the experience that he had to pull the gospel in the presence of the Gentiles he said the spirit itself harnessed him you're saying this is rest Jonathan this is rest he says and today as Servants of Christ we become harnessed hooked up we can't go we're logged in with it harnessed to the word no matter what anyone else says you're harnessed to it there's something about about it that you just can't get away from it you've been yolked up with it by the Holy Ghost and it has yolked you to the word no matter what anyone else says it's the word that's always harness up with it put in the Yoke with it to the word by the spirit he was harnessed he had learned on the backside of the Arabian Desert there when all his former things and experiences and ambition that he had been stripped of those things stripped of those things he says that's what we find today that we must be stripped first he said and people don't want to be stripped the Methodist brother wants to hold to a little bit of his Methodist teaching uhhuh the Baptist brother wants to hold to a little bit of his Baptist teaching see but you've got to absolutely be stripped of everything and just born again fresh he says and he take up from there and let the Holy Spirit lead you can't say well now my daddy said when he got in he went in the church he shook hands with the pastor he's a good loyal member church we got people still doing that in the message they're good loyal m MERS to their local congregation they're associated with the ministry but they're tied to family and habits and traditions rather than the life in Christ it's become a community rather than an experience it's become a habit rather than a life amen we ought to be good loyal members of a local body but that's not where it's at but that's the attribute of a Christian amen is that we support each other amen we don't come in just selfishly we come in to help the person next to us men we come to help pray them through we come to worship to to to to invite God into our presence so that his atmosphere so that his presence can do a work that none of us could do on our own that's why we come in and set an atmosphere amen he says that might have been all right for his race but we're another race see now we must come back to the Bible times for this day he says people don't want to be stripped you don't see this in the pictures but Christ was crucified naked he was stripped of everything he was punched he was slapped he was spit on he was bruised he was beaten to to almost to death and then they took all of his clothes off and made him walk through the streets people looking at him he took the literal embarrassment so we don't have to cuz that's what we deserved that's what we deserved was to be stripped bare amen but there's still a stripping down that has to happen to us doesn't have to be public in and of itself but it still has to happen amen that we've got to be broken down and it's a stripping of our self well and our pride and our ambition and our desires and it all the way down to our control that's the thing that he's looking for is to let us give our control over to him Paul would say this in Galatians he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me in the Life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul said crucify with Christ and there's a literal portion of that and there's a there's there's a metaphorical part because brother Braham says we were in Christ and so we were crucified with him because we're in him when we when he took all that pain when he took all that suffering when the sins of the world were laid on his shoulders and he was judged we were judged with him then and so we don't have to come into the Judgment now but then there's a daily dying out that Paul talks about as well there's a daily crucifixion a daily struggle and that's the labor to enter into rest it's the dying out that we're doing and when we die out then we can rest amen there's a daily laying down cuz Satan's always here trying to get us to take the reins back in our hands say the situation is too dire you got to take control you got to step in and God's saying wait wait wait I thought you were yoke to me I thought I was the one leading Satan wants us to pick it up and God's trying to keep us with our hands off of it amen Paul said I'm not living Christ is the one living through me I died so that Christ could live but he says every day this old self wants to rise up again and I got to keep dying I got to keep killing it every single day Paul said I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Jesus Christ Our Lord I Die daily then he said but I keep my body under subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away every day he says I've got to keep this thing under control Jesus said you must be born again he said in order to be born again it's letting yourself go and die and the spirit of Christ come into you then you're no more yours it's Christ in you see the Holy Spirit Paul said I Die daily yet I live not I but Christ liveth in me so we see what this this rest means and this rest is a union it's a marriage it's a resurrection of Christ inside of us amen it's a joining of you and I with him and we read earlier that he's the overcoming one he's the accepted one he's the powerful one and our lives then are just a reflection of him our rest is that his attributes his person his life is what makes us and takes us through not me not you it's him and US amen we start to rest because we can see it's his doing not my doing that's why it was so beautiful when sister Leah got healed it wasn't my doing but it shows that he's here whether I see him or not whether I feel him or not it doesn't matter he's here and he's doing the works that he promised to do in our lives each and every one amen it's his Perfection not ours it's his acceptance not mine it's his power not mine brother darl Ward I love what he said he said the the the the requirement of the ministry he says is to pray the prayer of faith to believe he says it's up to God to do the healing no man heals no man delivers it's the holy spirit that does the work but it's up to us to believe and act by faith on what he tells us to do by the word of God Amen this is the key to all of it is to let go and let God have his way amen it's Christ in you Christ in me doing the works that he promised and it's the pleasure of his Good Will in us and not my will and not my desires amen the musicians could come as we close on this last quote brother Bram says it's written over in St John about the 15th chapter if you abide in me me and my word in you see the word abides in you see then ask what you will and it'll be done because it's not you it's the word that's in you this is the rest and brother B would talk about he says you've got to have thus sayeth the Lord every day you've got to know that what the word says is Christ speaking to you so that when you speak it it comes forth it produces because it's the promise of God being quickened by the Holy Spirit he says the word is God see God in you God is the word because in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said now in the return of the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us and it abiding in there then it's not you that speaks it's the word itself coming out so it the word will perform the work amen God bless you yet stand we put this pressure on ourselves and there's no place for it there's no place for it because God never put pressure on us to do God put pressure on us to believe our only requirement is to believe to have faith in what he says and then he comes behind and he vindicates it and what is it what is it that that gives us that refreshing it's when we've believed and then God vindicates it by bringing it to pass they sat up in that upper room for 10 days 10 days and nothing happened we don't really know how it felt in there we don't know if there was a maybe there was a tremendous atmosphere in there maybe there wasn't maybe it was hot and sweaty and stinky we don't know maybe it was crowded maybe they were fearful we don't know but they stayed there until something happened and that's what was the rest is when something happened that was according to the word that they were believing and every day we're believing aren't we every day we're trusting whether it's for healing for provision for salvation for guidance for grace for a better attitude for forgiveness whatever it might be we're believing and then what is the rest the rest is when it happens that what you believe for is finally there and you can say there it is and you rest but the struggle is to believe it until it happens and then what happens is God gives you the next little bit of word and he brings you up a little bit higher and maybe it's a higher Faith it's a it's something you've never seen before you've never experienced before and so what do you do you labor to come into the reality of that and it's by faith it's by holding yourself to the word of God it's by saying Lord you promised it and I'm going to stay here until you give it and I'm not going to move I'm not going to back away I'm not going to let Satan push me around but I'm going to hold fast until you bring me this rest this refreshing of your word coming to pass in my life because I can't do it I can't do it so I can rest from my work and now all I've got to do is trust and believe that you're going to come through for me that's the rest and then what happens is he starts to work in US and then when he's done that work then he starts to work through us and now we start to be effective in the kingdom of God Amen that's where we'll go next service God bless us amen God bless you each one let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord there's a place of rest there's a place of Peace Lord there's a place of satisfaction and contentment that's available to every child of God lord and it comes by resting on your word Lord that's the foundation for everything that we have hoped for and dream for Lord all that we believe for is found in your word and Lord when we don't see it happening when it seems like nothing's going on Lord help us to rest Lord let our faith rise up Lord May the standard of the Holy Spirit come up Lord and may we just stand there and believe Lord May our confession be that your word is yay and amen Lord that no matter what we see or hear Lord no matter matter what these five senses would tell us Lord May that Faith super sense rise up and say We believe We believe We Believe Lord we're resting on your word this morning Lord we're resting on the leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord the great power that you've placed into the church Lord to do in us what your word says we're supposed to do Lord I pray you help us to lift our eyes up a little higher Lord that we believe in a way we haven't believed before Lord that we'd see your Sovereign Grace in our life Lord and that we trust that the work that you started you'll not you'll not Lord rest until you finished it like Boaz with Ruth Lord Lord that you'll go and you'll go and you'll go that word will work and work and work Lord until it produces that finished element in each one of us we pray Lord you see the needs you see the hearts you see the bodies you see the finances you see the marriages the families the relationships Lord The Lost Ones Lord you see those that are just dying Lord just over come by the cares of this world Lord I pray you give each one peace and rest this morning Lord not just in this service in your presence Lord but as they walk out Lord and face the challenges of this life Lord day by day may they feed on your word Lord may it produce Lord that rest that we're looking for Lord if they've never experienced it Lord I pray you fill them with your spirit Lord give them that great rest give them that great contentment Lord give them that great peace
