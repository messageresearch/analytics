the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen and amen thank you thank you thank you jesus hallelujah and say now i believe all things are [Music] possible [Music] thank you jesus [Music] praise the lord [Music] praise the lord god bless us amen turn with me to familiar scripture that we have read a number of times we read it again luke chapter 18. amen luke chapter 18 and god's blessings upon us all and the grace of his presence to minister to us through his word amen praying that the anointing will be with yes the ministry but pray the anointing be with the saints amen shall it just be in prayer because again i've i've i've it's been on my heart a number of times where i better call brother jonathan and get him to minister and but it got got too too close to the to the end well he would certainly have to come by faith and he would have to minister by faith for sure so but again we i pray the lord will grant grammy the revelation of what he wants me to say the revelation what he wants me to share with you amen and many of the things that that's on my heart again it's it's the it's the say of the lord through the through the ministry of a prophet so i pray god help me as we go through some scriptures and again continue continuing with the message that we we did on sunday and that is concerning faith and uh because brother sister everything comes down to faith and that's what god that's what pleases god without faith it's impossible to please him so brother regardless of the hour the age the time that that man has lived if anything god was looking for god was looking for faith amen looking for you to be governed and controlled by faith amen and i mean a real spiritual faith because then that comes from god because the devil can give you a give you an impersonation of faith oh yeah the devil got a certain amount of faith as i said he recognizes what's going on now and the bible says he's come down with great wrath why because he sees what god has done sees what god is doing and he sees what god is going to do and brother sister if he's coming down with great wrath brother how much should we as the bride of christ be going up with great faith amen so i pray brother that's giving satan that that revelation giving satan that faith what faith is giving you amen the grace of god be with us brother because god is requiring faith amen and again it's not going by the letter of the word but the spiritual revelation now many really got the spiritual revelation of what god has done in these last days how many got the spiritual revelation what god did in a prophet and what god has done through the prophet amen brother the purpose of god is he fulfilling that purpose in us tonight is he fulfilling that purpose in us in these last days because brother we're looking for the looking for the resurrection we're looking for the rapture or we believe that gosh and a prophet to give us the faith for this to faith for that do we have that faith brother because god's not depending on the prophet now because he has come and he is gone amen so brother i trust by the grace of god that brother that we got the revelation and we got the faith that god wants us to have and god expects of us after of concerning what god has done concerning the ministry that god has said concerning the word that god has revealed brother faith comes by hearing the word amen god did this through luther and wesley you know and on others down through the ages and brother the pentecostals but brother look what he's done in this hour to the bride amen i trust by grace we're not going to miss amen what god has done and we miss what god is doing because god the prophet is gone that's right but god is still continuing in the revelation of the word god is still continuing to reveal it amen because they're proud of god even before he was taken off the scene he said that you've got to dig deeper and he said you got to do this you got to do that and he said as you dig deeper he said there's more going to be revealed and he had a boy because way back there 55 or almost 60 years ago that he said listen he said i know he said i know it's not striking you the way that it should he said it's not striking me the way that it should amen but there's come in a generation he knew that that it was going to strike them the way that it should because what was he expecting the resurrection he was expecting the rapture because that's that was the purpose of the ministry that god did and performed in these last days through william branham amen and they owe me the word the the revelation of the seven seals brother it's tremendous so brother what tremendous thing is god looking for amen we thank god for that praise the lord but thank god but can god thank you that because that you're believing it the way you should amen because god thank you because it's giving you the faith that it was ordained to give oh my brother sister there's too many still caught up with the as it were the letter of the word but not the spiritual revelation of it and the prophet god knew that and he warned the people and he said he said i know he said you're getting this you're getting that but you're not getting the revelation of what god has done and what god is doing oh my pray god help us amen brother all down through the ages the bible is a testimony of this is what god does this is how god do it does it amen amen if all god did wanted that in luther's day on wesley's day rather and god wanted that go on back to noah's age amen god wanted this god wanted that so brother he gave them the revelation of his word to put together so that they would have the faith amen to take their stand they would have the faith amen to what to get victory in in what was going on and brother and and he gave luther victory oh man luther did this and he did that well when he was looking for the revelation he was looking for the revelation of justification and brother he did this he did that oh if i do this god will justify me if i do that i'll experience justification and brother he went and he walked and he and he did these these things and these things you know that was taught them in the catholic church that all you got you got to make these sacrifices you got to do this you got to do that that's right and but you know what he of all that he did he didn't feel justified amen he just felt more and more a greater and a greater need of the revelation of justification amen and that's why that in that in that last moment there when he was so so overwhelmed by everything so confused and everything else until he just said oh my what can i do and he said i'm going to go into the church and he went into a catholic church and you know that they had the bibles out in the in the vestibule in the catholic church and that's where martin luther went he went and oh and he opened up the scriptures oh he was so frustrated and he opened up to the book of romans and i believe it was and uh and he read uh his eye fell there oh [Music] we're justified in jesus amen jesus justifies us amen and he's asking us to believe it he did it well it struck martin luther a revelation of faith amen hallelujah oh hallelujah brother he was never the same after he became a new creature in christ amen and god revealed to him the revelation of justification and that's why god wanted that generation to know that's what god wanted that generation to believe amen and be a witness for and you know why hallelujah because why because god promised to restore the truth amen and he was beginning with luther and with wesley and the father god said yeah and he had to bring in the salvation army he said because he said the the methodists he's in the wesleyans he said organized so quickly he had to raise up he said william booth he said with red hot salvation amen well brother i thank god for that and he on to the pentecostals amen but in the end he had a he had a prophetic ministry promised in the last days amen well he's going to do this he's going to do that he's going to do that and hey hallelujah what was going the end going to do it was going to get us out of time and into eternity amen brothers and i just go on in time rejoicing for that god has done this god has done that amen no we got we got to come to the place there's not going on and say praise the lord praise the lord oh yeah we didn't we don't have to do what what john wesley did when he when he went into the there were so many that were he wanted his word won the revelation that he that he went into the the cemetery and he and he stood upon he got up on a as uh what they call it he got about a stone there uh headstone that's right he got up on it well thank god for headstones amen and he got upon the headstone and he preached sanctification by faith amen praise the lord not in the church in the cemetery praise the lord we're getting closer to the resurrection praise the name of the lord and god gave them a spiritual resurrection amen and he gave luther a spiritual resurrection he gave the salvation army spiritual resurrection to pentecostals amen but brother he's given us the resurrection amen hallelujah be bringing us to that place to experience the resurrection in these bodies amen and all praise the lord they looked there and they looked there they looked there but there's a generation rise that says look up amen it's not looking to this look into that and i'll tell you that's one of the reasons why god maybe god took the messenger amen because everybody was looking to the messenger they're looking at william branham they're looking at this they want to do this do this do this no and the problem god said i know he said you're not see you don't see the other angel amen that's the truth and i pray grace that we see the other angel i pray grace that we got the faith that god is looking for in you and in me god help us brother faith it's not just say i believe this i believe this i believe that yeah but what what what is the effect of your belief what's it causing you to do how is it causing you to live is it affecting your nature amen sister that's right amen brother it changed luther it changed wesley it changed the pentecostals and the others were in the revivals that god sent amen but brother how much is it changing you and me your faith in this message your belief in what god has done very good so what what's god doing oh he's what god did he's making flesh in you and me now giving us the faith of the resurrection faith of the rapture to get us out of here amen of all other generations we're the one that got to look up amen because you said god is going to do this god's going to do that and that that but he said he said there's a generation rising amen we're going to look up because we got to go on amen the ones that the ones that went on went on and went on they followed walked in the light walked in the light walked in the light amen and they went on to the to another dimension but then they come back to get us the prophet said the dead in christ will appear to the living saints amen what for get us look up amen they're not going to go here they're not going there they're going on amen so brother sister god help us and give us the revelation and let the let the revelation have that effect on us causing us to look up look up look here amen in our hearts in our souls we're looking up to him look up to jesus amen it's by the grace of almighty god god help us again i want to just try to by the grace of god just to share some thoughts again concerning faith amen because anything god looks for is faith amen and without it it's impossible to please him but it did luther but he gave the word to luther and luther got the faith amen oh yeah it struck him but i plea i believe the holy ghost was there and i believe that was the hour that was the minute that was the second amen for luther to catch it amen and brother well if not but god why because god let him go through all the rest all the rest to give him a testimony amen so these share that testimony with the world amen but brother and yet when they were justified they kept going on going on to another revelation another of the other revelation until finally god stops it and he gives us the revelation what what did he want us to do look up amen so brother sister i trust by grace in our hearts we're looking up to jesus oh please in the name of jesus please don't don't let your faith be oh it's got to be like like luther had the west no no no no that that faith did what god wanted them to do then but what's the faith doing effect causing you to do amen what is the effect of the faith in us what is god looking for in us what does god want us to do in this hour amen he's not let's not walk on with luther and walk on with wesley we're going on beyond that amen even the pentecostal age and so on we're in the bright age by grace amen and in the bright age it's not walking on it's walking up amen by the grace of god look up for your redemption praise the lord your redemption draweth nigh well brother what god amen what we needed for the resurrection what we need for the rapture we got amen well we needed for it god has given it to us amen and brother again i pray grace in the name of jesus that we'll do as the prophet said he said you young preachers he said your ordained needs to fill he referred to brother neville and himself he said you're our dad he said it was phil to fill our our footsteps and his shoes you're going to walk in our shoes he said amen because he knew that he was gone he knew that eventually william or her brother neville would go amen and even our brother willard collins is gone amen but what's god looking for now we've got to walk in the ministry has got to walk in the shoes as the word of the prophet and of the ministry that god used 50 60 years ago amen and we walk into that ministry amen now we're going to lay the word out lay the word out lay the word out and the more that you're getting the revelation you're more you're going to look up amen you're going to look up for the resurrection look up for the glorified body amen because the problem of god did say the dead in christ are waiting oh now i know why amen praise the lord the dead in christ he said are waiting on us and he said god is waiting on us brother to come to that faith oh i pray god in the name of jesus that we have the faith that pleases god amen i'm just saying oh i believe in god and i believe william brandon was a prophet yeah but you've got to believe something that god revealed through woodland branham amen amen lutheran had to believe the promise of justification wesley had to believe sanctification and and the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit but now you and i are going on beyond that brother we can't continue in just in that rev oh thank you lord thank you wonderful wonderful and go on no go and and you get no no greater revelation no greater understanding and we're just going on going on oh yeah thank god oh yeah that's what he did lord that's what he did what are you doing amen what effect is that happening in you amen i praise the lord sister and he and and yes because i've been ministering even to the young by the grace of god amen i want to teach the young jesus is looking to you jesus wants to get your attention and amen jesus wants to get you to look up understand you young people i know that oh my as young people we want to go on and on and on oh yeah we're going to do this we're going to do this i got to get this education that education you just do that by grace and as the lord leads you into your faith whatever god wants you to do do it and if god don't want you to do it don't do it amen but praying god that our young people here won't lose the revelation the spiritual revelation of what god wants to bring to their their attention amen oh yes it's me it's it and mom and dad yeah but as the young brother sister you young people maybe god's hallelujah god's laying it out laying it out because mom and dad might might be gone before the rapture that'd be gone before the resurrection and he's gonna he's going to wait on you god's waiting on you god's waiting on your testimony you young people here amen so i pray grace in the name of jesus to our to our young brothers and sisters this is tremendous thank god and i know there's been a couple of ministers that we've had visitors here and they ministered and and a couple of them have highlighted to to me concerning something that there's that sort of shocks them and they're surprised because it's you don't mind he said we go there and go there to other churches and never mind there's very few young people but they sit here the seat they see the seats here with young people in them and not only that he said they're they're paying attention and he said in in singing they're worshiping and he said he said that's wonderful i said well brother we thank the lord for it amen and god bless our young people there tonight amen that you're going to catch the revelation maybe in a way in a greater way than mom and dad maybe you're the one that god wants to work on maybe you're the one that god wants to build a man and make oh make you an absolutely faith creature amen you believe the word you believe what god has done and you believe what god is doing amen and yes like mom and dad you know oh there's a resurrection coming there's a rapture praise the lord lord we want it amen lord we're moving we're moving into it by grace so god help us amen that's why train the child in the way they should go amen and when they're old they won't depart from it amen so god help them over thank you brother keep your keep your sons and daughters in prayer keep your grandson's granddaughters in prayer amen brother i pray grace that you're going to be a faithful witness amen in amen you're going to reflect the word reflect the message to them by the grace of god oh yes great god at god help us amen lord bless you my taken that's the sermon i guess maybe i have to get brother jonathan to finish it so lord bless you and again we we already went through a number of scriptures in the last message and i got about the same number of scriptures here again so we'll we'll continue in the word but let's start with the familiar scripture of luke chapter 18. and beginning to read at verse 1. amen luke 18 and verse 1 down to verse 8 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god and the prophet that god doesn't fear himself amen neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night is that you oh there's a lot of believers tonight it's not them they're not crying day and night to the lord amen for the word shall not god avenge his only like which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them hear the word of the lord amen apply this to your heart and i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth it's a challenge to our faith do we have the faith that pleases him amen the question is will he find faith and again as i said when you get churches in certain churches in the message and they have many hundreds of people hundreds here hundreds there now how can you preach certain things in the message with that many people when the problem of god said there's only going to be a few not many at all is going in the rapture he narrowed it he narrowed it down to just a very very very few and again one time he narrowed it down to a dozen he didn't thank god he narrowed it down to 300 or 500. yeah so concerning considering the i guess the 40 saints that are here or the 45 whatever is here i wonder how many of us are going in the rapture i trust by grace that we're all getting into the faith so that he's going to take us all left amen and by grace maybe that he's going to take some of us by way of the grave at the older brothers and sisters amen and any depending on the younger ones to be ready for the rapture that he's going to rapture you amen so i pray god we're going to walk in the light as he is in the light we'll walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen so that we're not living natural lives we're living a spiritual life the holy ghost in control i trust the holy ghost in control of what you're doing in control of the life that you're living amen i don't don't make a difference to me what unnatural is your job that you got but still you're a spiritual seed of god amen and you're not going to you're not going to give in to just natural natural natural things no way no you're going to do it you're going to even in your jobs you're going to walk in the spirit even in your jobs you're going to live in the spirit even in your jobs you're going to be governed again by the holy ghost it's christ that liveth in you and he lives in praise the lord that's right that's why he'll bless you what you're doing in the natural if you've got it if you give it overall to him amen he'll bless you in doing this he'll bless you in doing that so i pray the grace of god amen that we're going to be led by the spirit concerning what we do and what you do amen so that brother that your job that you're going to choose in this world is not going to interfere with your spiritual revelation not going to interfere with your spiritual walk with god amen oh brother you got you got to be in a job so that god's there with you amen if god can't be there with you get out of it amen make sure you put it all into the hands of the lord god bless you may be seated and there's quite a number of scriptures that i would like to share with you if you would let's go to i was talking about faith let's go through the scriptures that i didn't finish on sunday in galatians chapter 3. in the book of galatians chapter 3. just trying to find it and let's read verse start at verse 1. oh foolish galatians i trust we're not foolish amen all foolish galatians who hath bewitched you yeah that ye should not obey the truth and before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you amen that is the truth and this only would i learn of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith amen many have received and identified with the spirit through the letter of the word amen the books of the prophet that has been printed concerning the prophet's message amen but brother we still need the power anonymity of the holy ghost to give us the revelation as we need it amen it's got to be given to us in a certain way to give us the faith that god wants amen and it says are ye so foolish and having begun he said in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh and have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain amen so i pray grace rather the stand that we have taken for the word the stand we've taken for the truth over all these years and maybe the ones that have done it longer than anybody else here with myself and our brothers brother ellsworth and sister ellsworth that have been identified with the word identified with the message for many many years and i would say maybe they identify with it even longer than myself because it was in 1966 that i came to the revelation that god has sent a prophet and yeah it was 1966 because it was 1965 december that i had been baptized in a pentecostal church oh yeah december i've been going to that that pentecost church for a number of years until finally the challenge was there to the audience to the congregation to be baptized and i remember going up and being baptized as the the baptismal pool was behind the pulpit and the brother baptized me using father son and holy ghost and amen and it was in when when i came in 1966 that was when i i went back to gamble for a holiday and of course i always go back there and we always had to add cottage meetings at brother and sister barnes's house oh yeah and and a brother uh it was a brother evangelist from nova scotia new brunswick and he was down here in newfoundland some years be before and brother and and the saints in in gamble a few of the saints in gamble believe the word believe the message and brother oh yeah because i can remember now even as a young boy when they when they were having a tent meeting in in our hometown of middlebrook and i myself and three or four orders four or five other young people just young boys and we were oh yeah we couldn't get into the tent because there's too many and and the tent was full but i remember that they had because of it was a bit warm they had the sizes attempt pulled up and tied and connected and so we got down on on the grass myself and a few other young young boys we got then on the grass and we watched watched the brother and sister in the pulpit watch them sing and listen to them preach and so on but if the results of that ministry amen brought us out from under the control of denominations amen oh yeah so there was a number of the saints that would gather in sister barnes brother barnes's house and we'd have cottage meetings we didn't they didn't identify with this denomination that denomination they did try to stay in pentecost for a while but they didn't want them and so they left pentecost and started to have their own their own their own services amen and when i would go out oh my i i wanted to fellowship with them amen i didn't go to a denominational church which is with fellowship maybe in in brother and sister barges home amen and we we we just sing and praise the lord and and preach uh just freedom from denomination god brought us out of denominations we're not under control of denominations no more amen we're free in jesus oh yes so it's finally in 1966 when i went there and i called the brothers and sisters oh praise the lord i'm here i'm looking forward to some services they said praise the lord brother gerald we got some good news and i said what's that oh god has set a prophet i said what yes she said god has sent a prophet and he was the messenger to this last church age and brother oh it's tremendous what he preached it's tremendous old mind the message that he that he got and so from that from that moment on in 1965 and it was july june july of 65 that we we started to put the emphasis on william branham amen it wasn't on the preacher in in in in british columbia somebody in new brunswick oh no i bought i tell you the influence of that of of the ministry of william branham on him because it was a number of years later that i heard that our that evangelist went down to jeffersonville and was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and his wife she likewise she eventually did the same and she come back and she said oh my brother sister she said the mo she said william branham he said he is my best preacher he said she said there's no one like him and amen so they they came amen and then of course eventually their ministries what they had stopped and they came back under the ministry of william branham amen and it was again in 1966 that i was re-baptized in bishop false amen by brother bill haggett amen so i thank the lord for that brother and god was put we did what we did believe what we believe because god was putting the emphasis on the faith that he wanted us to have in the hour we're living and i believe that god used that that brother and sister from from the atlantic canada there to bring us out of denominations amen and to make us ready for for the prophet's message oh yeah that when when when the testimony and the witness of william branham came on the scene oh praise the lord he's right you know we were we he was preaching against denominationalism we were against denominationalism amen and brother oh yes and knowing that sister burns she had heard about william branham and she had uh some some believer had given her a record one of those long plain records and uh it was it was a testimony of brother brown's life his test his life his life story and brother brown was giving it on that record and sister burns heard it oh she said that's wonderful god bless thy brother god bless our brother amen but yet not recognizing him to be a prophet but recognizing to be a man of god amen and she was absolutely blessed by the recording and but she was shocked in early 1966 she was shocked when she received the magazine of a certain evangelist i know that that magazine might be might be here in the basement somewhere or maybe maybe your son got it but i've seen the magazine and i seen the picture of the magazine and on the undercover and that's that's what shocked sister bran sister burns when she received that magazine for that month yeah what was on the magazine it was a picture of brother branham and one of his grandsons or no it might have been brother his son joseph but joshua was young then and it was a picture of brother branham and joseph and the highlights on the magazine was that william branham was gone to be with the lord she was shocked to think that we had lost the ministry yeah and she said oh my and then when someone when this oh yeah when certain other brethren came to introduce her to the message oh yeah then she went back and got that magazine and she showed me that magazine yeah so thank god brother see it it's it was god that brought him out of denominations amen it was god that brought him under the control of the holy ghost amen so that when they received the witness of the of the prophet amen they were ready to receive it amen they're ready to believe it they're waiting for the food oh yeah and i remember going out and we have cottage meetings after that we had a cottage meet oh then we put on a tape by brother branham i remember now putting on you know those big tape recorders and those great big tapes that they had their sermons in i remember sitting in the corner and then and they they wanted me to leave the service and so on they wanted me to introduce the tape the the sermon by the prophet of god and i put it on turn it on and we sit and listen to the entire tape amen by the grace of god amen but now we've gone so far than what we were in 1966 amen brother gone further into the word amen further into the reality lord brother that we're approaching the resurrection and the rapture we're approaching the error to get out of here and to go home and many of us are focusing more and more and more on the resurrection and many of us are calling more and more for the rapture and many of us really are looking amen looking for that to happen expecting it any time as the product of god said you're going to walk in the spirit do this do this and he said amen and she could be walking up there one of these days and he said you're going to look over there and you're going to see somebody and it'll be it'll be one of those saints that are going on and he said they're going to appear to us praise the lord amen those that are going on are going to appear to us and trust him by grace that i'm going to be in the spirit and in the word and then with the faith they'll bring that one to me amen oh yeah and they're going to appear to us and and the problem of god said he said we're going to step into that dimension with them amen and stepping in he said we're going to receive a glorified body amen so brothers be on our guard truly we've got to live in the spirit and walk in the spirit amen brother we've got to live under the control of the revelation not us controlling the revelation it's got to control us amen what god has done and god is doing it's got to control us so we got to walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen but let the spirit have control of what we're doing let the spirit have control of where we do it when we do it how we do it amen so amen truly brother that it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me i'll tell you there's not many believers like that because i tell him many are just living for themselves oh yeah they say and again like i've heard i've heard believers say i talk to believers oh yeah i believe the message what but i tell you they're they're not living it oh they read the message oh yeah and they they would go to a message church and they would they would listen to it listen to the message by the prophet but they're not living for god they're living for themselves oh there's so many believers now that are just caught up with themselves and they're naturalized but not their spiritual amen brother how many have been caught up with their spiritual life and many are really really really living in the spirit walking in the spirit amen and brother everything in your home in your job no matter what you do where you go you're in the spirit you can't you can't forget it you're thinking about the word think about the message oh lord please in the name of jesus don't let me miss the rapture amen you've got to be looking for it to be a part of it it's not just say i believe it because the devil believes it but he's not he's not going to be raptured amen but how many is going to live their lives oh my as the seed of god spiritual sons and daughters of god you're loving amen not for this world but for the world to come amen oh brother we just can't we can't forget it we can't forget what god's done we can't forget what god's doing amen and we don't want to forget it amen day in and day out we're calling for the for the rapture we're calling for the resurrection and again brother it's the truth and i i believe it the problem of god said that he said they are waiting on us and he said god is waiting on us what are you waiting for they're waiting for us to get into that resurrection and rapturing faith amen and that'll bring them from that dimension to this one amen it's going to bring god on the scene it's going to bring the saints that are going on it'll bring them on the scene amen by the grace of god praise the lord amen so i pray in the name of jesus god help us to believe with a complete belief god of us have no question no doubt but brother surely after all these years we know what god's done we know what god's doing and we know why amen and knowing that that that we have given ourselves over we can't oh yeah we've been so convicted with the revelation of the word we've been so convicted that we can't we can't stop thinking about the resurrection we can't forget the rapture no no no no by the grace of almighty god there's many that go by graveyards and and i said oh so-and-so is there so-and-so's there they're buried there no they're as i said like someone said how many's in the graveyard i said nobody what nobody no i said they're going on into into a glorified body not glorified body but into with the albany body i said they're they're right there in another dimension they're not coming at the graveyard to me with me as i said the the book that someone gave me that i had for a year a number of years and i gave it back to someone that was part of that religion and in in that book they had they had the pictures there you know of the resurrection and there was jesus coming down and there was the dead the dead coming out of the out of the graves it was grandma and grandpa they were old father yeah well we're looking for more a greater faith for brothers history elsewhere amen amen that brother that their brothers is not going to go up like they are there now no they're going to be young men a young young man and a young woman amen probably god said you'll be around 20 years old amen praise the name of the lord but in that picture they had they had real old grandma real old grandpa and poor old look at that poor old sister sadie you know she was 99 years old no no she's going to be a young woman amen and we're and we're going to be young and our and our very young people are going to be older that's the western ones amen in the resurrection those that are maybe 10 11 12 or 15 years old you're going to be up there 20 years old yeah by the grace of god amen and again that's why that's like the prophet god saw it and he saw them young and knowing that there's they praise the lord there's been others and i i've read their testimonies maybe on the internet there somewhere and this one had a testimony that they went beyond the curtain of time and they said oh and they said oh we we uh i saw this one but i didn't know who they were and and that person said you don't know me and he said no and this lady this is a woman that girl and she said i'm your brother i'm your sister what she says you were only this this this old when you went yes you she said we're not but she said here she said i'm this amen amen so brothers are not babies they're not just way down like the young young people here you're going to be around 19 20 years old amen by the grace of god oh brother concerning all that god has said and concerning all that god has revealed in these last days concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture amen concerning the new heaven and new earth brother surely that we're we can't walk through the day without thinking about it that we can't walk but not one day can we go without thinking about the resurrection oh listen the problem of god did tell us he said listen it's gonna come to that place and he said where he said this this boy or this girl amen if you got the faith if you got the resurrection rapturing faith amen he said this boy or this girl could be there and not only mom and dad but the boy or the girl the young and he said oh when that hour comes that time comes it should oh the anointing when the anointing reaches that that that measure in their lives he said what will they do oh he said it could be that young boy could be that young girl he said they'll look up and they'll raise up their hands and say lord i'm coming home and they're gone they what did they do he said they started the rapture yeah and then this one's gone that one's going then this one's changed that one's changed gone into eternity by the grace of almighty god amen but that was in in the top paragraph of a book i don't know the name of the name of the book right now was in the top paragraph on the right side and then in the paragraph in the middle he said but you know what our problem is he said we're putting too much emphasis on the the the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics of what god has done amen brother god help us that when it comes to the dynamics it'll point us to the artic mechanics it'll point us to the dynamics praise the name of the lord if we're going to get in into something that he said here in this message brother i pray brother it's going to strike us because of the dynamics not the mechanics we're not just oh yeah that's what he said there that's what he said there yeah we we believe it do you experience it amen because brother what god has done what god is doing is bringing us more and more into an experience amen we experienced justification saying well yeah luther it was an experience oh yeah because the burden was gone the questions were gone the questions were answered and now oh my he felt lifted up oh my praise the lord wonderful hallelujah all the burden that was on him gone luther and wesley the same thing the salvation army the pentecostal is gone why the burden was lifted they're wondering and their doubt and their questions was gone jesus answered amen so brother sister i pray god oh my lord albert's not oh my the prophet said and i do see it brother coming to pass he said it usually said when god starts this and god starts that about the third or the fourth generation will denominate they'll make a denomination out of it he said they did it in luther's day wesley's day the salvation army amen after the revival was over it went on into denomination amen a form of godliness and denying the power that's why they didn't go on with god keep marching on they stopped amen and brother and i i've noticed that even even that's happening around the message because i met many a believer brother into the third and fourth generations after the prophet amen oh yeah and what is it i believe the message what do you believe the message yeah yeah uh yeah i believe i believe what what brother about the prophet what god said through the prophet yeah well there's more to it than that is the message controlling your amen are we just caught up with the with this doctrine and that doctrine oh yeah i believe there's one god there's not no trinity i believe in the only other serpent seed and i believe this and i believe that there's there's i'll tell you this there's unbelievers out there that that would believe sherpac oh yeah i like i said when i when i worked in a certain place one time and we got to discussing certain things and and i remember one gentleman said he said excuse me he said what happened in the garden of eden he said can you tell me that we did did they eat an apple and it made them made them feel like they were naked i said no i said if they did i said we need to pass the apples again he said i agree and he was just just he was older than me maybe a few years older but but young back then he said i agree with him and then he says well but what happened was the the sin that they committed and i explained it to him what i said you don't believe it oh yes he said i do he said that's right he said that makes sense he said that explains the bible and the way the bible tells it i said exactly that's what happened oh he said thank you he said i'm so glad i heard that it's because all i'm hearing is they eat an apple and i said yeah but but i said it wasn't an apple so i said i pray pray the lord bless you oh yes thank you thank you if that was good he said he said such to give me such understanding i said good and then as i've said i've even explained it to even christians and even even even certain preachers and i said listen this explains i said why jesus was born the way he was i said he knew no sin because of the way he came he wasn't a sinner you know and so on but still no they won't take it they'll still go back to the old way but thank god brother for the faith that god has given us and god is giving us amen the god through the ministry of william read him and again the prophet god said he said it's not me it's him yeah and just like he said when he when he was behind the pulpit and he was he was going to pray for the sick now i said oh just just a minute now he said i got to get myself out of the way he said this is not me this is him so he started to get myself out of the way he says so he can come and he said take over yeah and it happened and it wasn't william branham it was christ he said i can't do this i don't know how to do this he said but he does so he said i'm just going to let him do it amen so are we going to get ourselves out of the way and let jesus control our lives amen it's a life that you and yourself can't live but he can oh yeah amen if you let him he will by the grace of god amen bring out a spiritual life in you whether it's your job i don't care where it is i've had no problem with these things when it comes to the places i work and and yet all they knew was well he's a christian well yeah as i said i've been working and working and there's another worker came over and says excuse me and i said yes what's the problem oh nothing he said i just want to let you know say i know you are you are a christian what i said yeah thank you oh he said just thank you he said i just want to let you know that and yeah and you know in the in that area that i was working there everybody respected me because of my stand as a christian and to me to me it was just i was just going i was just being normal do you have so much of the holy ghost that the life you live the christian life you live the spiritual life you live is it's just normal why if you're born again you you've got that nature in you but unfortunately there's too many believers don't have the holy ghost nature they don't have god's nature but they they're still going and living by mom and dad's nature no it's god we'll give him the glory some thoughts came to me in the last few days concerning my life and i look back and i said lord i said that was me i said lord it couldn't be me it must have been you i said when i was that young that they that people come and ask me bible questions i said i don't understand that i said i was so young i i i just went into a church now again i entered church and out again but yet i do remember those those things happening in my life i said oh my i said lord that must have been you i said it wasn't me i said i was i was just uh just a human being just as your ordinary young young boy and and it came back to my mind certain things that happened i remembered i remembered i remember i said that yes son you did that oh i said it wasn't me was it was god in me see if you're oh my you're predestinated hallelujah it's based on the foreknowledge of god brother oh my we could get into that and go on and on with more scriptures on my time is getting and so on by the grace of god i'd like to get into it and show you again why are you here now because you were there yeah yes jesus said all the fathers give me will come to me and i will lose none of them and amen so brother sister if if if god is calling me and pulling me pulling me this way now it's because why because i got the nature of god from the beginning from eternity praise the lord my name is on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen oh god help us to believe with a complete belief amen it's not oh i i'm this because oh yes i become a christian in the salvation army i become a christian in pentecost i become christian in this church or that church why did you become a christian you know it's like i said when i went to a an altar and they gave an altar call on many years ago and and i went to the altar i had one point there i remember standing in in a pew there and i was very very young and i was just crying crying and a lady behind me she was a friend of like my mother's and actually my mother was standing behind me and this lady was standing behind me and this lady reached down and she said tap me she said gerald i said yes she said go to the altar she said you need to go to the altar and she said we'll be praying for you i said okay thank you. of course she's gone on now because she'd be 100 over 100 years old if she was still living yeah and i went to the altar and knelt down and i remember praying lord i have mercy on me and help me and then i stood up and the gentleman behind the pulpit and he always said praise the lord he said god bless you he said what's your testimony i said my testimony i said the only test of mine that i know of i said is that i have become a christian through our lord jesus christ i said thank god i said that he gave me this experience he said praise the lord my son he said the lord bless you amen and i went back to the to the pew again amen and just kept worshiping with the rest and that's the only time that i know as a world i can look back and say that's when i became a christian but brother the the seed was engrafted in my heart you received with meekness the engrafted word of god amen that's why you're here tonight because the seed was engrafted in your heart and that's why you're still believing that's why you still want to stay with it because there's a seed that you're watering with the revealed word in your heart amen you've got to water all seed and and again you just pour the water in of the revealed word and you're growing and you're growing and you're getting bigger and bigger amen by the grace of almighty god getting more and more spiritual by the grace of almighty god amen all what testimonies what but brother sister remember what governs it all is faith it's all by faith it is a spiritual revelation of god dealing with you in your soul it is a spiritual revelation of god dealing with us in our hearts by the grace of god amen that's why i'm here tonight that's why you're here tonight amen yes let's believe also and pray that grace where brother visual air that's why you're here amen because it was the engrafted seed of the word of god in his heart oh no doubt back years ago back those number of years ago in india they never thought about that they didn't know about that grafted seed oh yeah and in due time it was watered and it broke and it came forth amen or brother if it's watered with the word and it's the seed of god then grab the seed of the of god it's going to come forth and it's going to reveal the nature of god in you amen not oh yeah well you you got the nature of your mom and your paul your grandma and grandpa amen but when you're born again the new nature takes over amen what for to bring to bring the the old nature subject to god amen so or you're like your grandfather grandpa yeah but now if you're if you're born again you're not going to live their nature i don't know god changes it you see again it's like the the couple that brought their daughter to the prophet of god for prayer and and the daughter had this problem and that problem and they and many people were thinking well they got that from from the mother they got that from the father and uh certain thing that the ch that was tormenting the child in in its flesh and so on and uh and the power of god just looked at the child looked at mom and dad and he said oh he said that's oh don't worry they said this this didn't come from you mom or dad no no she didn't inherit that from you and he said let me go back and he went back two or three generations and he said this individual and it was a grandfather she said she she got that from her grandfather she said that was passed on down through him amen not you not not the mother not the father no no he said it's her grandfather they said oh and he described them oh yes she said that's the grandfather yeah and god delivered her brother sister we're born in sin amen and born with the nature of mom and dad more than their own nature or grandma and grandpa and it goes right on back brother through to the to sin but thank god that when you're born again that nature the holy ghost comes in to take that nature under control amen shall not govern not controlled by the old nature but by the new nature amen amen the old one is natural the new one is eternal amen the old one is subject to time but the new one is eternal hallelujah so i pray the grace of god that by faith that we've entered into that experience that new nature and that by faith that the new nature is in control amen that when i meet you and i talk to you yeah oh yeah and you maybe maybe it's not spiritual stuff we're saying but again it's just what we say and how we say it and our attitude and our actions and reactions reveal that we are spiritual oh yeah listen you can't hide it it'll be there as i said there'd be this one there be that one they'll look at you and say oh no they they're church horse oh oh they're good that's good they they got different attitudes different ideas and so on they know that but we'll give the glory to jesus amen so have you had that witness that testimony as i've had done through the years that when i was much much much much younger amen that others you know just people that that may be strangers they say oh you're a christian yeah as you know oh i just know that why because sometimes they discern your spirit and they discern this they know this they see this when you say this you say that you do this you do that oh they must be christian yeah by the grace of god thank god amen that's not me that lives is christ it's not you that lives it's christ if they see this nature in you you say it's not my nature it's jesus nature he's with me and i'm letting letting him have control praise the lord amen so encourage your as i've said before be a witness to your sons and daughters yes and grandma and grandpa here be a witness to your grandchildren amen spiritual by the grace of god again of course by the grace of god i was raised in a home like that where my mother was spiritual my father was spiritual and he would rebuke us sometimes with the word he rebukes with this testimony of that testimony and so on oh yeah he wasn't showing off but he just wants to let us know about jesus he wants let us know that god's in control and thank god that every every every sunday when it comes to every sunday when we when we did at what we call our supper meal just before we would go to church in the evening and we would sit down to eat our eat our supper and my father would go over and i could see it in that house now and where the radio was it was electric radio plugged in somewhere no it wasn't plugged in it was on a battery a big battery and he turned the radio on and every sunday when we ate supper we listened to brother billy graham preach because billy graham was on the radio for years and years and years preaching amen oh yeah so amen my father mother didn't leave us without a witness of jesus by the grace of god amen sorry let's go back to galatians again chapter three i didn't realize that oh my didn't think i was that long just a few minutes galatians and says all foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ had been evidently set forth crucified among you yeah and the word's been crucified again this only would i learn of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith you're getting it by the letter of the word or the spiritual revelation faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye no made perfect in the flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you is to do with thee it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith amen i must how much are we governed and controlled by faith not your own ideas not your own feelings you're you're in the spirit filled with the spirit amen you're in you're in him and he's in you christ is in you you're in christ amen there's that great oneness amen so that oh no problem for you to live spiritual you just come come natural you just why you're following the leadership in the heart if you've been born again in your soul he controls you if you're just religious in your flesh like the prophet said he said you can be religious and have a religious spirit in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell exactly but within your soul god's in control amen so to make your calling election sure make sure that you're born again from the inside out make sure that you're governed by faith not by sight governed by faith not by feelings amen by the grace of god oh my grace and he said again in verse four have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain and he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth thee it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith i trust that we're controlled by faith morning noon and night we're controlled by faith in all circumstances in all situations in all decisions that you've got to make you're controlled by your faith your decisions everything is going to be based on your faith you don't have to stop and think well i believe this so i got to say this no no if you're born again it's just not just automatically normal yeah it was normal for you to go and live like mom and dad in their own nature now if you're born again it's normal for you to go and live live like like jesus by the holy ghost praise the name of the lord hallelujah brother i pray you're you're in it and you're doing what you're doing you're growing you're maturing by the hearing of faith you're lived by faith day in and day out you're growing and maturing by faith amen god you're getting more and more and more and more spiritual amen right brother we're getting more spiritual amen why because one day we're going to step into eternity praise the lord and he said even as abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness amen know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham not going by the letter of the word but by the faith the revelation of it in your heart amen the same are the children of abraham god's grace and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham amen oh let's make sure make your calling election short make sure you're you're called by faith you're living by faith faith controls you you're you're led by the spirit the holy ghost praise god amen it's not oh i just i i believe the message i believe oh brother brown was a prophet but it's all intellectual like the prophet of god said that he was dealing with people even in his day even in brenham tabernacle and he said you're living by the the mechanics but not the dynamics oh yeah and again when we preached on it just recently here we were preached on a certain sermon that he preached and and we quoted it where he preached it in jeffersonville and he said he said now he said you got the dynamics but you don't have you got the mechanics but not the dynamics and he said in in your life oh yeah they add the word the mechanics of the word in their life in their in their in their minds but he said they didn't have the dynamics the power of the holy ghost in their souls oh yeah well no that was branham tabernacle yes but there were sinners there as well as their in in other denominational churches around the world at that time back then and listen yeah because how many left tabernacle when he preached married no when he preached church order a lot oh yeah when he preached church order well after by the next service i guess that not many but not as many came to the service why because because a lot of them left random tabernacle and went they went to another brothers tabernacle about eight eight miles or eight kilometers away another brother had a tab at a church there and he still got it there he's gone on but his church is still there and they left brenham tabernacle went to his church why because he didn't enforce church order whereas in random tabernacle it was enforced and he wouldn't stay under the leadership god help us amen yeah wow no you if they were all believers around town they wouldn't go you know they wouldn't but remember jesus had many many many disciples and jesus made some remarks about eating his flesh and drinking his blood and i think it was 80 around 80 i think of the disciples walked away and they said this is a hard shame he said who can take that oh yeah and they were numbered with the others that were given power to do this give them power to do that and they come back with a witness testimony oh yeah we did this we did this and then jesus said you know eating his flesh drink his blood oh what no this is a hard saying who can do this he said and i think 80 the bible says 80 of them turned around walked away yeah and when brother when brown tabernacle when brother branham released a priest church order many believers turned and walked away they didn't agree with it god help us don't walk away stay with the word amen you see verse 8 and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them amen and that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them by the grace of god amen go down to verse 22. but the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that ye might be justified by faith thank god for faith brother if he requires it he's provided it amen but after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster amen for ye all year all the children of god by faith in christ jesus we're all the children of god by faith in christ jesus amen bear with me you don't have to turn to it i'll finish with this and i haven't even gotten to quotes boy scripture scripture if we go to a quote we're just trying to vindicate what you're saying you know but you got to come by the word amen appreciate our brother jonathan's ministry in scripture scripture scripture scripture it's amazing i say thank you lord amen and it's got to be the word there are those like i said i i was in a service one time and and this brother was going to preach and then he preached and do his full church and he got them priests amazing but he preached on a certain subject and i had the book in my bible and is that's funny was it prophet preached that and i open up that message oh that's where he is yeah and then oh yeah i can turn the page oh yeah she went on yeah oh oh he assumed he finished lord i just get into the last page oh yeah that's the way he preached as if he was preaching it as if it was his message but i discovered it was it was the prophet's message so brother god don't mean for us to do that no preach the word amen and then god will lead you to this quote that quote not only said that the prophet my prophet said this so he said you know and the and brother brown i don't think brother ryan might promise to do gold like that but he meant for us to go through the word the bible yeah that's what he would want us to do preach the preach what's in the bible give him a scripture out of the bible not oh uh i want to prove to you what you know what i'm talking about right here no no prove it here first and if you amen if you want and you want to vindicate it and what did brother brown say oh yes right here but like i said i said to preach it some years ago i said when it comes to the message of william branham i said you know i said for a lot of believers i said better i said if they started at the perm at the prayer lines and i said skip skip the message and i should just get to the prayer line because i knew i met believers oh that's all they were interested god did this oh yeah did you read that brother brown was praying for the sick and he prayed for this one and this happened and this happened that happened but when it comes to the message you preach they didn't they didn't know anything about it didn't put no answers on it just the prayer line and the healing well brother sister what god the reason god did that was to get our attention to this the word amen not william branham but jesus christ praise the lord i'll read one scripture here amen he's in the book of titus and he said the wit this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith amen brother the ministry is working on the faith the ministry is building up the faith the ministry is strengthening and encouraging the faith amen faith amen getting you to believe it stay with it stand on it testify of it well reflecting faith are you reflecting faith the the the dynamics of the word are just the mechanics of the word oh yeah and again the prophet highlighted in that message when he said he said you're putting two more chances on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics he said because it takes the dynamics to bring the rapture amen it is the power of the revelation it is the power of the mechanics amen by the grace of almighty god amen it says unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient unto every good work reprobate god help us amen we believe god do we believe the message oh yes i read the message yeah do you believe the bible well i tell you this sometimes they'll take this and say i believe this i believe that but there's scriptures that i can give some believers but they won't they won't line up with it no no oh yeah because as i've heard people say believers say oh i'm a believer i'm a believer i'm a believer yet there are scriptures there that i know that they are not in line with oh yeah oh i believe that i believe that yeah but when it comes to certain scriptures here where god says do this do this god's looking for this in your heart and your soul because you if you profess to have the holy ghost not you that lives christ lives in you and if it's christ in you well he's going to do this he's going to do it according to the word he's going to do according to the will of god yeah and there's there's things in here that christians do and should do and yet there's a lot of believers ignores it oh we got the message so we don't have to do this we don't have to do that huh god's going to require of them one day yeah because why because they wouldn't do it oh yeah they they had the letter of the word but not the spirit of it so god's grace to us so god bless us and again we'd love to continue that on the sunday and we'll see amen i was thinking lord i said i'll have to call even before i came here tonight i have to call i said and i'll get brother jonathan to minister i said oh brother mark i said we'll se i'll see you but but i said oh my no i said it's not enough time i said they'll need a little bit more time i said to to get ready to get to get ready to get a sermon ready amen so the lord bless us but it's coming we'll we'll hear our brother jonathan and brother mark minister again and i told our brother elves were there i said brother uh i said uh when you get your voice back i said i'll get you to give your testimony when he gets his voice back amen but he doesn't have it back yet so keep in prayer for brother ellsworth amen he's still got a few more uh treatments at the hospital so god's grace too to us all brother god help us we're living in the last hour and again when you consider cobit 19 oh my i guess there's not many of us thought that this was going to happen so soon but it struck it struck us all of a sudden yeah and like i said it's all around the world and things are going to get worse i believe that so god help us brother if things get worse naturally that spiritually we're going to get stronger and rich richer amen by the grace of god lord bless you let's stand let's say 388 388 all my comrades see the signal
