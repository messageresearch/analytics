[35:36] Lord Just Have Your Way in this service
[35:37] we ask now in Jesus Christ's name amen
[35:41] amen God bless
[35:55] you
[35:58] prepared for the evening for we ask it
[36:00] in his name and for his glory
[36:08] amen there's many people who coming to
[36:11] the service likes to always mark down
[36:15] what a minister has to say or read from
[36:18] the
[36:18] scripture and if you do that I want you
[36:22] to turn with me tonight for just a
[36:24] little reading found
[36:27] over in the book of St Matthew's gospel
[36:30] the 15th chapter the 21st to the 28th
[36:34] verse I would read
[36:37] this then Jesus went thin and departed
[36:41] into the coast of thyra of
[36:45] cyan sidon and behold a woman of canaa
[36:49] came out of the same coast and Cried
[36:52] unto him have mercy on me oh Lord thou
[36:57] son of David my daughter is grievously
[37:00] vexed with a devil but he answered her
[37:04] not a
[37:06] word and his disciples came and besought
[37:09] him saying send her away for she crith
[37:12] after
[37:13] us but he answered and said I am not
[37:17] sent but to the lost sheep of the House
[37:19] of
[37:21] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[37:24] saying Lord help
[37:28] me but he answered and said it is not
[37:32] meat for me to take the children's bread
[37:34] and to cast it to
[37:36] dogs she said truth Lord yet the dogs
[37:40] eat the crumbs which fall from the
[37:42] master's
[37:44] table then Jesus answered and said unto
[37:47] her oh
[37:49] woman great is thy faith be it unto thee
[37:53] even as thou wil and her daughter was
[37:56] made whole from that very
[38:03] hour if I would call this a
[38:06] text I would like to speak just a moment
[38:10] or for a few minutes rather upon the
[38:14] subject of
[38:20] perseverance I thought being that Mrs
[38:24] mcferson and the churches all always
[38:26] stood so
[38:28] gallantly for Divine
[38:31] Healing
[38:33] and we cannot preach the Full Gospel
[38:37] without preaching Divine Healing because
[38:40] it is part of the
[38:43] Gospel I remember as a little boy
[38:46] reading an article in one of the
[38:49] magazines life or look or some of those
[38:52] magazines I was justed a young l a of
[38:56] them making a light of Mrs
[39:00] mcferson of preaching Divine
[39:04] Healing and they said that she had a a
[39:07] trick that she did said women that had
[39:10] garer she put a pen under her finger and
[39:13] the women put a balloon under her
[39:16] garment then Mrs M to lay hands on the
[39:19] woman would stick the pen into the the
[39:23] balloon and would deflate the balloon
[39:27] I was a
[39:29] sinner but I had better sense than that
[39:33] to think such a thing if the pen stuck
[39:36] the balloon it would
[39:38] burst so I said no doubt but what that
[39:41] woman is
[39:43] suffering uh
[39:46] persecution and then since I have become
[39:49] a worker in the vineyard I realized what
[39:53] she had to
[39:55] stand
[39:57] standing for
[39:59] truths you're always hated of the
[40:05] enemy the word perseverant means to be I
[40:09] think according to Webster
[40:13] persistent to be
[40:16] perseverant persistent in making a
[40:21] goal and every person on Earth or it's
[40:26] every been on Earth that ever achieved
[40:31] anything had it amounted to anything had
[40:34] to be
[40:37] perseverant you've got to be sure first
[40:41] what you've got your faith anchored
[40:44] in now Faith is just not a thing that's
[40:48] so easily floated around it at some kind
[40:51] of a we would call it in the street
[40:53] expression a Hocus Pocus
[40:57] faith can only have its its right
[41:01] position when it's placed upon uh
[41:04] something that's
[41:07] steadfast if I told you to go out and
[41:09] put your hand on that tree and be healed
[41:13] you could doubt
[41:14] that so why we have no background to
[41:19] anything youd only have my
[41:21] word and if I told you that washing in a
[41:24] certain water out here in the in the
[41:27] valley would bring healing to you it
[41:30] would depend on how much confidence you
[41:32] had in
[41:35] me and Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[41:39] what the word of
[41:41] God therefore if this be the word of God
[41:45] and it is what it teaches we can rest
[41:49] upon
[41:50] it God cannot
[41:54] change God must far ever remain God his
[42:00] word must be just as true and this age
[42:03] as it ever was in any
[42:07] age now we are finite we can say
[42:11] something this year and maybe even
[42:13] tomorrow have to alter it because we're
[42:16] not too sure because we're finite we're
[42:19] just
[42:21] presuming and presume means to Adventure
[42:24] without Authority but When God says
[42:28] anything it's
[42:30] perfect he don't have to
[42:32] alter Abraham staggered not at the
[42:35] promise of God through unbelief but with
[42:38] strong giving praise to God because he
[42:40] know that he was able to perform or to
[42:44] keep or to do that what he had
[42:48] promised then if God's ever called on
[42:50] the scene for a
[42:53] decision and the decision that God makes
[42:56] first it has to Forever remain the same
[43:01] it can never change it cannot be altered
[43:05] because he's infinite and anything
[43:08] that's infinite never had a beginning or
[43:11] an end so he cannot take it back next
[43:14] year and say I was
[43:16] wrong and then if that was his
[43:19] decision then every man that makes that
[43:22] same uh comes to that same decision that
[43:26] God made for one man upon the basis of
[43:29] his faith to believe it he's got to meet
[43:32] that same thing every time a man
[43:34] believes it God's got to act every time
[43:37] the way he acted the first time or he
[43:39] acted wrong the first time and who can
[43:41] ACC God of acting wrong God's got to
[43:44] ever remain with his decision if thou
[43:47] can't
[43:49] believe now to achieve anything you've
[43:52] got to set a goal and say this I I
[43:56] believe and tie yourself to it and keep
[43:59] drawing moving up closer to it knowing
[44:03] that you it's there knowing that there's
[44:07] something there that you're coming to
[44:10] like it was said the little boy with a
[44:12] kite holding the string in his hand he
[44:15] said the man said what are you holding
[44:17] son he said my
[44:20] kite he said I don't see nothing but a
[44:22] string he said but there's a kite on the
[44:24] end of it
[44:27] the man looked up said' I don't see the
[44:28] kite the little boy said neither do I he
[44:31] saidwell how do you know you got a kite
[44:33] he said I can feel it tugging at the end
[44:38] that's the way faith is Faith is the
[44:40] substance of things hope for the
[44:42] evidence of things not
[44:43] seen as long as you set your faith on it
[44:48] and then anchor to it you're coming to
[44:50] it no matter if you can't see it or not
[44:52] you know it's there anyhow you're
[44:54] tugging at it and it's pulling
[44:58] you and any man that's ever done
[45:01] anything worthwhile has set a goal and
[45:05] then been
[45:07] persistent perseverant to make
[45:10] that great man George Washington the
[45:15] father of our nation is
[45:17] called when he come to Valley
[45:21] Forge after all night in
[45:24] prayer until he was
[45:26] wet with the snow up above his
[45:30] hips kneeling in the snow the next
[45:33] morning he crossed Delaware full of
[45:37] ice why he was
[45:40] persevering he had the
[45:43] answer nothing's going to stand in his
[45:46] way although three or four bus musket
[45:50] bullets went through his coat but it
[45:53] never hurt him he tried wanted to
[45:56] achieve something and he had prayed
[45:59] through on it and he was
[46:02] perseverant nothing stood in his
[46:05] way could you
[46:08] imagine Noah in his
[46:12] days how perseverant Noah
[46:16] was now he was just a
[46:19] farmer and they lived in a greater day
[46:22] of scientific research perhaps than we
[46:26] have
[46:26] today because in those days they built
[46:31] pyramids and if any of you had the
[46:33] privilege of being at the big Egyptian
[46:35] pyramid and seeing the Sphinx and so
[46:37] forth why it's amazing to see how they
[46:41] ever did get those Boulders up there in
[46:43] the air almost a city block high that
[46:46] weighed thousands of
[46:48] tons today we could not reproduce
[46:51] it we don't understand they had
[46:54] something they had a die they had
[46:56] something they could embomb a body with
[46:58] that would make it look quite natural
[47:00] for thousands of years we don't have
[47:03] those Arts colorings and so forth that
[47:06] they had a great scientific age but one
[47:10] day while Noah was out in the the field
[47:15] maybe uh fixing his
[47:17] crop God appeared to him and told him
[47:21] make ready for the saving of your
[47:24] household and build an
[47:27] ark and it's going to rain now we all
[47:32] know that the anian world it had not
[47:35] rained and now that didn't cope with the
[47:39] scientific uh thinkers of that day his
[47:43] message was
[47:44] contrary no doubt that smart scientists
[47:47] could have come to him and said now look
[47:48] here Mr Noah now we got instruments that
[47:52] we can shoot the moon and we can uh do
[47:55] all these scientific researches and
[47:58] there is no water up
[48:02] there and how is there going to come any
[48:05] water down from there when there's no
[48:07] water up there to come
[48:10] down you're a
[48:12] foolish you're doing something that
[48:15] there's nothing to there's no water up
[48:18] there but Noah could say God said that
[48:21] it would rain and that settles it God
[48:24] said so 120 years he was persistent in
[48:29] the face of the scientific world of his
[48:33] day still claiming his message was right
[48:37] because it come from God he had a goal
[48:40] to make he had a message to take care of
[48:44] and he was persistent in doing
[48:46] so no matter what the rest of the world
[48:49] said Noah heard from
[48:51] God Amen that's all it mattered to him
[48:55] he had heard heard the voice he was sure
[48:57] it was God and he was making ready
[48:59] something that seemed very silly to the
[49:01] world but yet Noah knew that God would
[49:05] keep his
[49:06] word should that not be a lesson for us
[49:10] today hour as Jesus said as it was in
[49:14] the days of Noah so shall it be at the
[49:16] coming of the son of man a message
[49:19] that's silly to the world they don't
[49:23] understand it but yet those who
[49:25] contacted the Holy Spirit knows that he
[49:29] will return
[49:31] again I can see the people as they
[49:34] pitted poor old Noah about how much fun
[49:36] he was missing and of the world and the
[49:39] things was going on but Noah still
[49:41] persistant held right on one day God
[49:44] said to Noah all right you've done your
[49:47] part now now come into the ark you and
[49:51] your household and the notice the the
[49:53] birds begin to fly in and and the
[49:56] Animals begin to go in by two by two
[49:59] Noah and his family went in and there's
[50:01] always borderline Believers I call them
[50:06] people that'll come to church they'll
[50:09] enjoy a message maybe from the choir or
[50:12] from the singers from the minister or a
[50:15] testimony they'll enjoy it but to come
[50:19] in and be part of it they just won't do
[50:22] it they like to listen but they won't be
[50:25] part of it they do not want to be
[50:27] identified with them they want to stay
[50:30] off to one
[50:31] side that's always been and no doubt
[50:34] there was in that day
[50:37] then when the ark door was closed many
[50:41] of those people said well let's go up
[50:43] and stand
[50:44] around now if it comes to pass that for
[50:49] instance the old man was right we all
[50:52] kind of thought that the old fell was a
[50:54] little bit off but I I I enjoyed
[50:56] listening that he preach standing there
[50:58] in the door and now we know that
[51:00] something closed that door now he's a
[51:02] good old man and if it would happen to
[51:05] be some water come down up there why
[51:07] well he'd take us
[51:09] in you see you don't want to trust you
[51:12] don't want to strain God's
[51:16] goodness you want to be sure that you
[51:18] just come in while you got a chance to
[51:20] come in then the first thing you know
[51:24] the first day look at how God puts a
[51:26] strain on his people
[51:28] sometime I imagine the first day Noah
[51:30] said to his family all right now we're
[51:33] climb up into the
[51:35] upstairs now in the morning the skies
[51:38] are going to be dark never was dark
[51:40] before we've never seen it rains go to
[51:43] fall lightning will sweep across the
[51:45] skies and the next morning up comes the
[51:50] sun no sign all day long knowing his
[51:53] family look well than went on just
[51:56] exactly the way they did I imagine the
[51:58] borderline Believers said oh the old
[52:00] fell was wrong they went on back
[52:01] downtown eating drinking and being
[52:05] married imagine his family what a strain
[52:09] it must have been on the
[52:11] man but he didn't give up and start
[52:13] knocking on the door and saying people
[52:15] pry the door open I was wrong why he
[52:19] knew he had the
[52:21] truth and he held on to
[52:23] it if it didn't rain today it will
[52:27] tomorrow that's it
[52:30] Hallelujah all
[52:32] right then the second day
[52:35] come and we notice the sun came up and
[52:37] crossed over just like it did the every
[52:40] day no sign of rain still he was
[52:44] persistent on to seven days Noah was
[52:49] sitting right there said if it didn't
[52:51] rain today it will tomorrow see he was
[52:55] anchored he was persistent perseverant
[52:59] because he know that God said so and it
[53:01] had to be that
[53:02] way now finally on the seventh day when
[53:06] he looked out the window the skies were
[53:09] blackening the wind was blowing across
[53:12] the hills the trees were bending over
[53:15] people were screaming not knowing what
[53:17] to do and after a while great big drops
[53:19] of rain begin to break down for the
[53:21] first time striking up on the streets
[53:25] the sewers filled up all the Springs
[53:29] broke up the water began to rise people
[53:32] got into their boats and they sank the
[53:35] winds were rough and it got deeper and
[53:39] deeper and deeper after a while been
[53:42] come up on the ship he watched out the
[53:44] window finally the people screaming
[53:47] there's no way for him to reach out and
[53:48] get them he was way up in the upper
[53:50] story they' send way their day of Grace
[53:55] the there was no more left for them it's
[53:56] too late then finally what a feeling it
[54:00] must have been to Noah when he watched
[54:02] out on the street and seen all the
[54:04] little uh boats whether they were God
[54:07] constructed or not you see people think
[54:10] that today they can construct their own
[54:13] arc they can make their own salvation
[54:16] you can't do it that's right God made
[54:19] the salvation for us and we've got to
[54:21] accept it just the manc constructed AR
[54:25] will not stand anything that man can
[54:28] achieve it's contrary to the will and
[54:30] the word of God it will not stand but
[54:33] how it must have been when Mrs Noah and
[54:36] her daughter-in-laws and and son Sons
[54:39] and so forth when they seen this water
[54:41] coming up on the ark and yet the ark was
[54:44] still sitting flat but after a while
[54:47] they fell it cut
[54:51] loose she was
[54:54] floating oh Noah knew that all of his
[55:00] what he had tried to achieve what he had
[55:02] done his message is paying off then it
[55:06] was cut loose he was leaving the
[55:09] Earth like it is when a man will stay
[55:12] not come up and shake hands with a
[55:14] pastor put his name on a book but when
[55:16] he'll stay there until he feels
[55:19] something Cut Loose inside of him and he
[55:21] begins to float out
[55:24] y by
[55:26] faith knowing that his sins are passed
[55:29] and he's anchored his soul in Christ and
[55:32] there's something raising him higher and
[55:36] higher
[55:38] persistent
[55:39] perseverant Moses was very
[55:43] perseverant after he had went down in
[55:45] Egypt and killed a man and with all of
[55:48] his education and his training and yet
[55:52] he done the thing wrong be because he
[55:54] trusted and what he could achieve by his
[55:57] education and by his own uh we're told
[56:00] that he was a military man and what he
[56:03] had been trained to do we find out that
[56:05] it failed and when it failed he wasn't
[56:08] persevering on that he run to the
[56:10] Wilderness for 40 years but one time he
[56:14] met God in a burning bush took off his
[56:18] shoes he saw the glory of God he seen a
[56:22] dry stick turn into a serpent and go
[56:24] back to his stick again he saw a Le hand
[56:27] be healed by the power of God and he
[56:30] heard the voice of God speak to him
[56:33] nothing's going to stop him man hallu
[56:35] I've often described him I hope it's not
[56:37] a sacrilegious way an old man 80 years
[56:41] old with his wife sitting straddling mu
[56:43] with a A young and on her hip the next
[56:45] day and a beard hanging down the
[56:47] sticking his hand going just eyes set up
[56:50] in and towards the skies a white beard
[56:52] up blowing and somebody say where you
[56:53] going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to
[56:56] take
[56:58] over a oneman Invasion hallu hallu it
[57:03] looked kind of ridiculous but God's ways
[57:06] to the carnal mind is
[57:08] ridiculous but it's precious to those
[57:11] who's anchored in it they know what
[57:14] they're talking about they press
[57:18] on oh what a thing that must have been
[57:22] Noah or Moses rather going down to Egypt
[57:27] a nation that had the world scared about
[57:30] like Russia Today a oneman Invasion an
[57:33] old man 80 years old with his wife
[57:36] sitting on a mule and a crooked stick in
[57:39] his hand going down to take over the
[57:43] things strange about it to the world he
[57:46] did do it he tuck over God only has to
[57:51] have one man one person somewhere
[57:57] that's tied to
[58:00] him someone who knows where they're
[58:04] standing and
[58:06] persevering the persecution and
[58:08] difference doesn't bother him at all
[58:11] going down to take over and he did
[58:13] it it looked very
[58:16] ridiculous and there stood a man some
[58:20] 14t tall or more I believe his finger 14
[58:24] in long with a spear in his hand like a
[58:28] Weaver's
[58:29] needle probably half from here at the
[58:32] door out there standing over and
[58:35] challenging Israel there was Saul on the
[58:38] other side Head and Shoulders above his
[58:40] army a trained man all of them well
[58:44] trained and
[58:46] bluffed that's
[58:48] right and the devil wanted to
[58:50] proposition with them that's the way the
[58:53] devil does it when he thinks he's got
[58:54] the best
[58:55] sign come over let's not have no
[58:57] Bloodshed just two of us if I whip your
[59:00] man then we'll you'll serve us if he
[59:03] kills me then there'll only be one of us
[59:05] die instead of armies of us what a
[59:08] proposition he can
[59:10] make everybody was scared to
[59:13] death and it looked ridiculous to see a
[59:16] little stoop shouldered
[59:19] kid come up with a little sheep skin
[59:22] wrapped around him a slingshot on his
[59:25] side with some raisin cakes in his
[59:27] hand to see his
[59:29] brothers that devil made his boast in
[59:32] the front of a man of God one time and
[59:34] he called his hand on it why he knowed
[59:38] who God
[59:41] was said uh you mean to tell me that
[59:44] you'll let the armies of the Living God
[59:46] let that uncircumcised Philistine defy
[59:49] the armies of the Living God I'll go
[59:51] fight him oh my
[59:55] why he was persistent his brother said
[59:58] oh we know you're naughty go on back
[1:00:00] home with them sheep dad told you watch
[1:00:02] you just come up here to see the
[1:00:04] battle you can't out talk a man of God
[1:00:07] when something's done happen to
[1:00:09] him so he goes up to Saul Saul I imagine
[1:00:14] scratch his head and look down he said I
[1:00:15] admire your courage
[1:00:17] son but that man is a
[1:00:20] warrior that man is a Warrior from his
[1:00:23] Youth and you're nothing buddy Youth and
[1:00:25] don't know nothing about a sling or
[1:00:27] about a spear or how to doel oh but
[1:00:31] watch him in doce
[1:00:32] something your
[1:00:36] servant kept the sheep for his
[1:00:40] father and he said one day a bear came
[1:00:43] in and he took one of my father's
[1:00:47] lambs and I went after him and I slew
[1:00:52] him and then a lion come in he got one I
[1:00:56] took him out and I went after him and I
[1:01:00] slew
[1:01:01] him now he said the god that give me the
[1:01:05] victory over the bear and Over The Line
[1:01:07] how much more will he give me the
[1:01:09] victory over that uncircumcised
[1:01:11] Philistine that's defying the armies of
[1:01:13] the Living
[1:01:14] God Saul said but you're just a
[1:01:17] kid he said you haven't got nothing on
[1:01:20] just a little sheep skin wait I I'll put
[1:01:23] my armor on you
[1:01:25] so he tuck him and put his armor on him
[1:01:28] could you imagine the Bible said he was
[1:01:30] Ruddy a little bitty maybe 110 lb man
[1:01:34] putting on a great big armor of a man we
[1:01:36] about 250 about 7 foot and something
[1:01:39] tall his all mashed
[1:01:43] down could you imagine that David looked
[1:01:46] around the shoulders about that much too
[1:01:47] far out and it looked like a skirt on
[1:01:50] him hanging way down like that his
[1:01:53] breastplate he he found out that the
[1:01:56] ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of
[1:02:00] God said take the thing off of me I
[1:02:02] don't know nothing about
[1:02:04] it but let me go with what I knows right
[1:02:08] there you
[1:02:12] are went the power of the
[1:02:15] spirit I believe it's Hudson Taylor once
[1:02:18] said to a Chinese missionary this
[1:02:21] Chinese boy said Mr Taylor I have felt
[1:02:24] my call in Christ he said shall I go now
[1:02:28] and study to get my bachelor of Art and
[1:02:31] then for my PhD and all I have to have
[1:02:34] my doctor's degree Mr Taylor said go now
[1:02:37] son go now don't wait till that time
[1:02:40] comes you'll waste away too much of your
[1:02:43] life I think that's right I agree with
[1:02:47] Mr Taylor go now I'm not trying to
[1:02:51] support my ignorance Now by trying to
[1:02:53] say we don't need educ education that
[1:02:55] might have its place but Education
[1:02:58] Without salvation has no anchor it's all
[1:03:00] sails and no
[1:03:03] anchor go when the candle's lit don't
[1:03:06] wait till it's half burn up go when you
[1:03:09] light it if you don't know nothing no
[1:03:11] more than how it got lit tell others how
[1:03:13] it got lit maybe they'll get lit
[1:03:16] too so just as soon as the candles lit
[1:03:18] go tell everybody how you got your
[1:03:20] candle lit and maybe they'll get lit off
[1:03:21] of you see notice
[1:03:25] certainly David was persistent because
[1:03:29] he knew Samson was met on the field one
[1:03:33] day with a thousand Philistines around
[1:03:36] him and he looked all around there he
[1:03:39] wasn't a trained man but know how to
[1:03:41] doel but when he turned his head he felt
[1:03:45] that
[1:03:46] Covenant them locks strike his shoulders
[1:03:49] that's all he had to feel he got the
[1:03:51] first thing in his hand was a Jawbone of
[1:03:53] a mule
[1:03:55] and he beat down a thousand Philistines
[1:03:58] why he was persistent because he know
[1:04:01] that God made a covenant with him of
[1:04:03] those Seven Locks long as they hung in
[1:04:07] their place nothing was going to bother
[1:04:09] him oh brother sister how the Church of
[1:04:13] the Living God ought to stand tonight
[1:04:16] persistent as long as we can feel the
[1:04:19] Covenant of the Holy Spirit the blood of
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin
[1:04:25] you should never let nothing stand in
[1:04:26] our way
[1:04:28] persistent
[1:04:32] certainly
[1:04:34] John the great prophet that was spoke of
[1:04:38] to raise up when he was in the
[1:04:41] wilderness he was told by God there's
[1:04:44] looking for a messiah of course 400
[1:04:47] years before that had a prophet but God
[1:04:50] told him in the wilderness he said now
[1:04:52] they'll try to tell you uh doctor so and
[1:04:55] so is a guy ought to be the Messiah if
[1:04:56] you to announce him why he's the best
[1:04:58] person in our
[1:04:59] congregation and they're going to say
[1:05:01] well the the high priest's grandson up
[1:05:03] here he's a he's the Gody should have it
[1:05:06] and so forth but look John this is a
[1:05:09] real
[1:05:11] job you've got to be sure so I'm going
[1:05:14] to give you a sign upon whom Thou shalt
[1:05:16] see the spirit
[1:05:18] descending and remaining upon that'll be
[1:05:20] the one that'll baptize with the Holy
[1:05:22] Ghost in fire John stood there watched
[1:05:26] over the congregations as they come and
[1:05:29] he everybody coming this that and the
[1:05:32] other but he couldn't see him one day
[1:05:34] while standing debating with the priest
[1:05:36] saying you mean to tell me the time will
[1:05:37] come and the daily sacrifice will be
[1:05:39] taken away he said there come a
[1:05:42] man and he looked there it was he said
[1:05:46] behold there's a lamb of God that takes
[1:05:49] away the sin of the
[1:05:51] world he knew it
[1:05:54] because God had told him upon whom thou
[1:05:56] shallal see the spirit descending he
[1:05:58] knew it he was
[1:06:02] persistent back to this little
[1:06:04] woman we just got many things we can say
[1:06:07] about different ones that was
[1:06:09] perseverant persistent holding on to
[1:06:14] achieve I've got a little slogan that I
[1:06:17] say quite a
[1:06:18] bit it might be good for you to take
[1:06:21] it a winner never quits and a quitter
[1:06:26] never
[1:06:27] wins just think of it a winner never
[1:06:32] quits and a quitter can't
[1:06:35] win you must hold
[1:06:38] on and before you even start be dead
[1:06:41] sure you're right and then be persistent
[1:06:44] let nothing move you go
[1:06:47] on I've had quite a bit of experience of
[1:06:49] that and you know it I know this one
[1:06:52] thing when you're dead dead sure that
[1:06:54] you're in the will of God when you're
[1:06:56] dead sure you're centered in Calvary
[1:06:59] nothing's going to move you you're
[1:07:03] there this little woman she was a
[1:07:07] Greek and
[1:07:10] serel and she had heard about the fame
[1:07:13] of Jesus now how does faith come by
[1:07:17] hearing hearing of the word she had
[1:07:20] heard of him
[1:07:22] and you know she might have had a lot of
[1:07:26] things to hinder by her being a Greek
[1:07:30] Faith cometh by hearing we know that and
[1:07:32] she had a a lot of things to hinder but
[1:07:36] Faith finds a
[1:07:39] source no other knows anything about
[1:07:43] faith finds this
[1:07:45] source that no one can explain it it's
[1:07:48] something that you know others can't see
[1:07:51] it but Faith sees it
[1:07:54] Faith sees that where the natural eye
[1:07:56] doesn't see it but the inside eye sees
[1:07:59] that thing now she had a need of Jesus
[1:08:03] she first thing you have to do if you're
[1:08:05] go to find Christ you've got to know
[1:08:08] that you've got a need of him when you
[1:08:10] think that you just don't need him then
[1:08:13] you'll never find him because you won't
[1:08:15] search him
[1:08:18] diligently did you notice that scripture
[1:08:20] where it says seek and you shall find
[1:08:23] not and it'll be open actually that's
[1:08:26] just not knock like and it'll be
[1:08:29] open E that not just say well I went out
[1:08:33] Lord here I am you want me no that's not
[1:08:35] it he that
[1:08:38] seeketh he that knth
[1:08:42] continuation it has to compare with the
[1:08:44] rest of the scriptures like the unjust
[1:08:45] judge and the
[1:08:47] widow she constantly knocked on his door
[1:08:51] she was
[1:08:52] persistent if if he turned her away
[1:08:54] today the marsh is on his hands again
[1:08:57] that's the way you want to get God be on
[1:09:00] his hands every morning every night
[1:09:01] every day all the time constantly just
[1:09:04] keep seeking keep asking keep knocking
[1:09:07] just don't knock a little while and get
[1:09:09] tired and go away just keep standing
[1:09:11] there Lord I'm here and I'm not going to
[1:09:15] leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to
[1:09:18] stay right here getting tired listening
[1:09:21] I'm having a great time knocking go I
[1:09:22] know you're coming
[1:09:26] that's when something happens he has to
[1:09:28] get you off of his hands so he comes
[1:09:32] out to answer you now F Faith finds this
[1:09:38] his word is a a sword the Bible says in
[1:09:41] Hebrews 4:12 that the word of God
[1:09:43] sharper than a two- aged sword now
[1:09:45] there's only one thing can hold this
[1:09:47] sword that's a hand of Faith the hand of
[1:09:50] faith is the only thing that can yield
[1:09:52] this sword of Faith uh sword of the word
[1:09:56] now you might have a weak arm just
[1:09:58] enough to pick it up for justification
[1:10:01] you're so weak maybe that's all you can
[1:10:03] cut through but this sword of the word
[1:10:07] will cut free every promise that God
[1:10:10] made in it if they got a good strong
[1:10:12] armed of Faith holding it there I
[1:10:15] believe God for my healing I believe God
[1:10:19] for my baptism God made the promise and
[1:10:21] Faith holds his sword it'll cut out of
[1:10:24] the rock on her every promise of God can
[1:10:26] be cut free by the word of God for it is
[1:10:30] a
[1:10:31] sword she had many hindrances but her
[1:10:34] faith didn't have any you might have a
[1:10:37] lot of hindrances every a person starts
[1:10:39] out to meet Christ well fine you got a
[1:10:41] lot of hindrances but your faith don't
[1:10:43] have any faith don't have no
[1:10:45] hindrance faith has hairs on his chest
[1:10:49] great big
[1:10:51] muscles reasons raised up and said you
[1:10:54] know it's reasonable Faith pulls his
[1:10:56] muscles back sticks out his big chest
[1:10:57] and said shut up sit
[1:11:00] down and reason jumps over a corner and
[1:11:03] takes his stool right Faith's got
[1:11:09] muscles and he he means what he
[1:11:12] says that's what we need
[1:11:15] tonight that's what the Four Square
[1:11:17] Church needs that's what the Pentecostal
[1:11:20] group needs that's what the whole world
[1:11:22] needs that's what I need that's what you
[1:11:26] need and we ought to be ashamed to admit
[1:11:28] it but we need a faith that'll hold
[1:11:31] God's word and say it's
[1:11:34] true meet the devil say thus sayith the
[1:11:40] Lord I was reading the other day where a
[1:11:42] man said the devil got before him and
[1:11:47] said he's just a little bitty old devil
[1:11:50] and he said boo said I'll jump back and
[1:11:53] said he said boo I jump back every time
[1:11:56] he'd holler Boo and i' jump back he'd
[1:11:57] get bigger and i' get ler and said he
[1:12:00] kept saying boo said I get smaller each
[1:12:02] time I'm going to jump back and he' get
[1:12:04] bigger said I know they had to fight him
[1:12:05] after a while said I looked around
[1:12:08] thought what I found the word of God
[1:12:10] said I rolled it in my hand and the
[1:12:12] devil said boo and I said boo
[1:12:14] back and said when I said boo back every
[1:12:17] time I said boo he got smaller and I got
[1:12:19] bigger that's it you got to fight him
[1:12:22] sooner or later
[1:12:24] am you know that people don't believe
[1:12:25] there's a devil I run into him all the
[1:12:29] time head into him every day any other
[1:12:32] believer
[1:12:34] does yes you got to fight him sooner or
[1:12:37] later so you might as well start right
[1:12:39] now he's only one thing he's afraid of
[1:12:40] is that blood and that
[1:12:42] word faith holds it it's strong Marches
[1:12:46] On Now find out this little greek woman
[1:12:52] as I said she had many hands hindrances
[1:12:53] but her faith didn't have any faith
[1:12:56] don't have any
[1:12:57] hindrances they might have said to her
[1:13:00] do you know you're a
[1:13:03] Greek you're you're you're a Greek uh
[1:13:06] you know you don't belong to his
[1:13:09] denomination don't go down there that
[1:13:12] Bunch now that's one of the
[1:13:15] hindrances see but if you got faith
[1:13:17] you're going anyhow I don't make any
[1:13:20] what denominations he's
[1:13:21] in just so is there she had a need she
[1:13:25] had a daughter that was dying with
[1:13:27] epilepsy and she had to get to him
[1:13:29] because the doctors couldn't do nothing
[1:13:31] for can't do it yet so she had to get to
[1:13:34] Jesus she had heard it he'd heal those
[1:13:36] kind of cases well they said he's not
[1:13:40] he's not he never come with his Revival
[1:13:42] to your denominations that didn't hinder
[1:13:45] that little woman had Faith she is
[1:13:48] persistent she just passed that group
[1:13:50] her faith pulled her away from it oh if
[1:13:54] it could just do that today somebody
[1:13:56] says it's a meeting T night down at the
[1:13:58] Four Square Church well it don't belong
[1:14:00] to your denomination you better stay
[1:14:02] away from down there just press right on
[1:14:03] through your faith takes you right
[1:14:05] on see faith has no hindrance it goes
[1:14:08] anyhow nothing's going to stop it I said
[1:14:11] it's bronny big muscles it's got the
[1:14:14] floor rest up and scared of
[1:14:17] it yes sir they'll run from it like
[1:14:19] small pox they just get from away ain't
[1:14:22] got nothing to do with that when big
[1:14:23] Faith raises up say I know who I believe
[1:14:26] I'm
[1:14:27] persuaded that's
[1:14:29] it there might been another group that
[1:14:31] come along say the D Days of Miracles
[1:14:34] has passed there is no such a thing is
[1:14:37] that that's a bunch of Holy Rollers down
[1:14:38] there I'm Jews we're Greeks we're smart
[1:14:41] we're intelligent group of people we
[1:14:43] give the world art music and religion
[1:14:47] and there's no such a thing as that but
[1:14:49] she was
[1:14:50] persistent days of Miracles wasn't pass
[1:14:52] for her because because something done
[1:14:53] told her down here that it wasn't and
[1:14:56] that Jesus had what she was looking for
[1:14:58] and she was determined to get to him
[1:15:01] regardless of her denomination sponsored
[1:15:03] it or not she's going anyhow she's going
[1:15:05] to get down there she was persistent
[1:15:08] still persistent days of Miracles might
[1:15:10] be passed for them but it wasn't for her
[1:15:14] that's the way it is with every believer
[1:15:15] that people say the days of Miracles a
[1:15:17] man told me some time ago that I don't
[1:15:19] care what you'd say Mr Brandon that that
[1:15:21] I don't believe there is such a thing is
[1:15:23] Divine Healing I said certainly not to
[1:15:25] you it wasn't for our unbelievers just
[1:15:27] for those who believe that's right it
[1:15:30] wasn't sent to unbelievers it was sent
[1:15:31] to Believers you can't enjoy it because
[1:15:34] you know nothing about it he won't tell
[1:15:36] me there was no such a thing as the Holy
[1:15:37] Ghost I said you're just about 33 years
[1:15:39] too late for
[1:15:41] that I said I know
[1:15:43] better I've done received it ah nonsense
[1:15:46] that's it might be to you but not to
[1:15:49] me it's real to me it's
[1:15:52] life
[1:15:55] something anchored you come too late to
[1:15:57] tell me that they've come too late to
[1:15:59] tell us about Divine Healing we done
[1:16:01] been healed we done been filled with the
[1:16:03] Holy Ghost we done got Rapture and Grace
[1:16:06] amen it's too late for any of those
[1:16:08] things it might as well shut up we done
[1:16:09] got it our faith can say sound I know
[1:16:12] what I'm talking
[1:16:14] about well doctors I don't care what
[1:16:16] doctors so and so say the Bible said it
[1:16:18] and I've got faith in that book in my
[1:16:20] hand and my faith holds it out there
[1:16:22] Jesus is coming I believe that I receive
[1:16:25] the Holy Ghost because I see him living
[1:16:27] in my life amen it's according to the
[1:16:30] word nothing a manifested revelation a
[1:16:35] perfect Vindication of the Bible being
[1:16:38] right in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:16:39] today and forever let them laugh that
[1:16:41] way they can laugh all they want to
[1:16:43] would just be as persistent as it was
[1:16:45] when Noah was Moses was all the rest of
[1:16:48] the impersonators raising up jambes and
[1:16:51] jambes threw their rod down turned into
[1:16:52] a snake there was those man just as
[1:16:55] honorable as they could be did exactly
[1:16:56] what God told him to do there come a
[1:16:58] bunch of impersonation up throw down
[1:17:00] their rods the only thing they could do
[1:17:01] just stand still and see the glory of
[1:17:03] God
[1:17:05] Amen God will stand by it if he's
[1:17:07] sensing you're sure of it you're going
[1:17:10] to achieve the work that God
[1:17:12] predestinated for you to do you'll stand
[1:17:15] there and God will take every carnal
[1:17:17] impersonator away from you right stand
[1:17:20] there you can be persistent because you
[1:17:22] know
[1:17:23] who you have believed and what's right
[1:17:26] examine your Revelation with the word if
[1:17:27] it's contrary to the word leave it alone
[1:17:29] if it's with the word God's bound Duty
[1:17:32] bound to keep his word now now there
[1:17:35] might have been a bunch of ladies Stand
[1:17:37] Down in the corner uh you know and they
[1:17:40] said here she comes now she's got that
[1:17:43] kid up there it's got epilepsy and and
[1:17:45] doctor so and so said that that there's
[1:17:47] no cure for epilepsy and here she is
[1:17:49] going down to that offbrand denomination
[1:17:52] down there
[1:17:53] for that fanatic Prophet to come up here
[1:17:55] and heal at
[1:17:57] child so they said we are to stop Susie
[1:18:00] I hope there's not a Susie here but we
[1:18:02] are to stop Susie and tell her because
[1:18:05] she's been a good woman there's nothing
[1:18:07] against her life but we are to stop her
[1:18:09] and the only thing that I know to do is
[1:18:11] she's passed by everybody else so she
[1:18:13] won't break this barrier you know what
[1:18:15] Susie your husband will leave you
[1:18:18] because he's a trustee or Deacon on the
[1:18:21] board and he'll leave you short a world
[1:18:23] if you go down there she was still
[1:18:25] persistent she went right on see Faith
[1:18:28] don't know no hindrance it must skip
[1:18:31] there then she passed another group and
[1:18:33] said you know what when you return back
[1:18:36] defeated and find out there's nothing to
[1:18:38] it everybody in the neighborhood will
[1:18:40] laugh at you that didn't even make her
[1:18:42] ears turn red she was persistent she
[1:18:44] went right on I like that I like that
[1:18:49] persistence then here stood one of the
[1:18:51] deacons and said if you go down there
[1:18:53] you know what they're going to do put
[1:18:55] you out of your church cuz you've
[1:18:57] Associated yourself with them holy or
[1:19:00] people I said you know excuse me oh
[1:19:03] maybe I said you associating yourself
[1:19:05] with them you'll get put out of your
[1:19:07] church she was still persistent Faith
[1:19:10] knows no defeat she had one thing to
[1:19:13] achieve and that was get to Jesus she
[1:19:15] had a need and he was the only one had
[1:19:18] that need I'm saying this tonight
[1:19:20] brother and sister I'm 53 years old I've
[1:19:23] been serving him since I about 20 he's
[1:19:26] met everything that I hadn't need of and
[1:19:28] when it comes to the hour of my death
[1:19:30] I'm sure what I need right then two
[1:19:32] Wings to reach across the river he'll be
[1:19:34] there don't you
[1:19:35] worry I know he'll be there I'll just
[1:19:38] stick the old sword back in the sheath
[1:19:40] and take off the helmet lay it down up
[1:19:42] on the river when I Bank when I hear the
[1:19:44] Dashers and I'll scream send out the
[1:19:46] life I'm coming home this morning it'll
[1:19:48] be there yes sir the Morning Star will
[1:19:51] come down and light up the way AC cross
[1:19:53] the river we'll go yes
[1:19:55] sir
[1:19:57] amen she was persistent she had an
[1:20:01] achievement she knew that she had to be
[1:20:03] persevering in order get to Jesus so she
[1:20:06] had to pass by everything finally she
[1:20:09] arrived
[1:20:11] now finally got here everything's fine
[1:20:15] now and then here come another hindrance
[1:20:18] the very man that should profess to have
[1:20:20] confidence in the man she tried to get
[1:20:23] to Jesus he said I'm not sent to your
[1:20:26] race oh
[1:20:28] my would that not made us Pentecost will
[1:20:31] blow
[1:20:35] up I'm not sent to your
[1:20:39] race that was a shock but you know what
[1:20:43] faith knows no
[1:20:47] shock and then again he turns around
[1:20:50] after all these things she' pass through
[1:20:52] and her Faith holding that she knew that
[1:20:55] Jesus could give her her desire and she
[1:20:57] went through every one of these barriers
[1:20:58] and when she got to him then turned down
[1:21:01] flatly I'm not even sent to your
[1:21:05] race I can imagine standing her eyes
[1:21:07] gleaming she she was in front of him
[1:21:10] then that's all she had to be and said
[1:21:13] besides that your race ain't nothing but
[1:21:15] a bunch of dogs oh
[1:21:18] my what if it said that to you You' said
[1:21:22] I'll take my papers from this four
[1:21:24] square and go over to somewhere
[1:21:26] else I'll never go back there again I'll
[1:21:29] take it from so and so oh yes yes
[1:21:33] sir but still she held on oh see Faith
[1:21:38] knows no defeat ain't nothing go to stop
[1:21:40] it though Jesus said to her the very one
[1:21:43] she come to said I'm not sent to your
[1:21:47] race and they're nothing but a bunch of
[1:21:50] dogs but what she had had a hold of real
[1:21:53] faith faith knows no defeat I don't care
[1:21:56] where it comes from knows no defeat
[1:21:59] because she had Faith still she held on
[1:22:02] oh I love that she was not a hot bed
[1:22:06] plant a hybrid like some of them
[1:22:09] today these high-bred religions we got
[1:22:12] today you know ain't no good everything
[1:22:16] now is highbrid hybrid even they got
[1:22:18] hybrid
[1:22:19] churches hybrid Christians talk in but
[1:22:22] shaking their hands oh they can dress
[1:22:24] better and maybe use better English and
[1:22:26] so forth like that ain't got no life in
[1:22:27] it you take a big fine ear corn High
[1:22:30] bread maybe it's twice as pretty as the
[1:22:32] other one plant it it'll die ain't got
[1:22:35] no life in
[1:22:36] it that's right we don't want nothing
[1:22:39] hybrid we want the genuine
[1:22:42] thing you haven't got it stay there till
[1:22:44] it comes why except the substitute when
[1:22:47] the Pentecostal skies are full of the
[1:22:50] Reel nothing hybrid it won't stand you
[1:22:52] have to always spray a hbrd plant keep
[1:22:54] the bugs off of
[1:22:56] it that's why some of these hbrd
[1:22:58] Christians you have to Baby them and pet
[1:23:00] them promising they'll be Deacon or
[1:23:01] something else keep some of the worldly
[1:23:03] bugs from them of unbelief they get out
[1:23:06] of the church kick them out
[1:23:09] anyhow never was in you can't join a
[1:23:13] church you might join a lodge you can
[1:23:16] join the Methodist Lodge Baptist Lodge
[1:23:18] or Pentecostal Lodge but if you ever
[1:23:19] come to Christ you'll be bned into the
[1:23:21] church
[1:23:24] right the mystical Body of Christ others
[1:23:26] are lodes right it's all right nothing
[1:23:29] against them but you're borned into the
[1:23:30] Church of the Living God by the spirit
[1:23:33] of God you can't journ it at all and
[1:23:35] when you're borned in there you got a
[1:23:36] birth you're not a hbd no more a hand
[1:23:39] jarner a
[1:23:40] hitchhiker know hitchhiker is always
[1:23:43] thumbing that's why well I know but
[1:23:44] doctor so and so no no that's it that's
[1:23:50] it exactly she was assistant she wasn't
[1:23:53] a hybrid you didn't have to spray her
[1:23:54] over with perfume make her right she
[1:23:57] stood there part of our crop today too
[1:24:00] many of them's hybrids just compan like
[1:24:02] David Dees I believe once said God has
[1:24:04] no grandchildren trouble with our
[1:24:07] Pentecostal movement we're getting
[1:24:08] Pentecostal grandchildren they come in
[1:24:10] because our fathers and mothers were
[1:24:12] Pentecostal we take them in on the
[1:24:13] Cradle roll and they come up without the
[1:24:15] experience and there they say they're
[1:24:16] Pentecostal too no sir God don't have
[1:24:20] grandchildren he ain't Grandpa he's
[1:24:23] father right if you ever get to heaven
[1:24:26] you'll pay the price like your mother
[1:24:28] did your daddy
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:31] did amen that might sound crude but it's
[1:24:34] truth it's crude way of making a point
[1:24:36] but you understand that kind of English
[1:24:37] I'm sure it isn't very good English it
[1:24:40] gets a point what I'm trying to say just
[1:24:42] listen to it yes she wasn't a hybrid she
[1:24:45] didn't have to be sprayed over and baby
[1:24:47] well now sister dear I I I tell you oh
[1:24:51] no no sir
[1:24:53] and no matter what knocked her down she
[1:24:54] said it's truth we're nothing but a
[1:24:56] bunch of dogs it's true that we're not
[1:24:58] worthy of it oh my she admitted that he
[1:25:01] was right I'm going to say a great big
[1:25:04] mouthful get ready every time genuine
[1:25:08] faith will admit the words right and
[1:25:11] anytime that something says that the
[1:25:13] days of Miracles has passed or something
[1:25:14] against the Bible it's not genuine
[1:25:17] Faith the faith will always admit
[1:25:21] truth stay with the word no matter what
[1:25:25] anything else says what anybody else
[1:25:26] says it's a word's right let every man's
[1:25:28] word be a lie and mine true every who
[1:25:31] will add to or take away from the same
[1:25:32] will be Tak this part out of the book of
[1:25:35] life God's going to judge the World by a
[1:25:37] church which
[1:25:38] one Catholic 660 some OD different
[1:25:41] denominations how's he going to do that
[1:25:43] God's going to judge the World by Jesus
[1:25:45] Christ and Christ in the beginning was
[1:25:47] the word and the word is with God and
[1:25:48] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:25:51] flesh and dwelt Among Us God and the
[1:25:53] word is the same this is God on print
[1:25:56] you've got the you've got the Holy
[1:25:58] Spirit plant that seed in there it
[1:26:00] brings it to life breaks that life forth
[1:26:01] and manifested and vindicates Jesus said
[1:26:05] in St John 12 he that believeth on me uh
[1:26:07] St John 1412 rather The Works that I do
[1:26:10] shall he do also so it always admits to
[1:26:13] the truth oh my but you know she said

[1:28:54] gift of God she had the right approach
[1:28:57] humility she fell down at his feet and
[1:29:00] she had humility she didn't stand said
[1:29:02] now you wait just a minute you know we
[1:29:04] people agree you said we were dogs just

[1:29:12] masters of so and so and such and such
[1:29:14] she never thought of that at all she
[1:29:16] just admitted that he was right and fell
[1:29:18] down at his feet and said help me
[1:29:20] Lord I'll just eat the
[1:29:22] crumbs if my daughter can't have a whole
[1:29:25] slice of bread will you just let her
[1:29:28] have the crumbs if she's a dog oh my
[1:29:33] there you
[1:29:35] are would we be satisfied with just the
[1:29:39] crumbs if the Holy Spirit should reveal
[1:29:42] to somebody
[1:29:44] tonight you're
[1:29:46] healed would you be ready this to take
[1:29:49] the crumbs or would do you want God to
[1:29:50] walk over and raise you up and give you
[1:29:52] some kind of a feeling if he'd just say
[1:29:53] in your heart my sickness is over you

[1:30:04] want uh everybody come up and lay hands
[1:30:06] on you and pour all and go through the
[1:30:08] regular ritual like that or are you just
[1:30:10] looking for crumbs God will honor
[1:30:14] that you know many of disciples is SE
[1:30:17] him after his
[1:30:18] resurrection Thomas said no uhuh I won't
[1:30:21] believe it I I got to put my hands in
[1:30:23] the prince of his F Nails in his hands
[1:30:25] and in his side then I'll believe it he
[1:30:28] said come here
[1:30:30] Thomas said touch me and he did he said
[1:30:34] my Lord and my God he said Thomas
[1:30:36] because you have seen and felt and
[1:30:39] everything you believe yes Lord said how
[1:30:41] much greater is their reward who has
[1:30:44] never seen and yet will
[1:30:46] believe are we ready are we Gentiles

[1:30:51] example to all of us just give me the
[1:30:54] crumbs Lord just let me hear some man
[1:30:56] I've never read the word but tell me
[1:30:58] that you heal the
[1:31:00] sick uh that Crum will be enough for me
[1:31:03] I believe it let me hear somebody say
[1:31:06] and read it from the word that the Holy
[1:31:09] Ghost Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:11] repent every one of you be baptized in
[1:31:14] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:31:15] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:31:17] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:31:19] the promise isn't to you and to your
[1:31:22] children and to them it's far off even
[1:31:25] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:31:28] Lord I feel it that's right that's a
[1:31:31] crumb come on that's all you have to do
[1:31:35] come are we ready to take the crumbs are
[1:31:38] we ready to Humble ourselves she
[1:31:41] was she was ready to Humble herself
[1:31:44] Faith always admits the word right faith
[1:31:47] is always
[1:31:49] humble Faith humbles itself out now she
[1:31:53] was just looking for the crumbs watch
[1:31:55] what Jesus said for this
[1:31:58] saying for this saying I'm willing to
[1:32:02] take the crumbs Lord for this
[1:32:04] saying thy child is whole you have your
[1:32:09] request because you believe it Faith
[1:32:12] admits that the word of God Is Right
[1:32:14] Faith admits all these things Martha
[1:32:17] Mary down through the Bible we could
[1:32:19] call many the shunamite woman many
[1:32:22] things and cases that we could call we
[1:32:24] haven't got time to of this I got about
[1:32:27] five pages here written of people now
[1:32:30] who approach for our
[1:32:32] crumbs but let's bypass that just a
[1:32:34] minute and I feel the Holy Spirit
[1:32:37] closed I don't think it's
[1:32:40] necessary let me just give you one
[1:32:42] little
[1:32:44] experience the business man wrote the
[1:32:46] little thing up in their the little
[1:32:49] article not long ago in their magazine
[1:32:52] and remember when you make a printed
[1:32:53] matter you better be able to back it
[1:32:56] up we have it documented statement from
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:00] doctor I noticed in the church tonight
[1:33:03] quite a few Spanish
[1:33:06] people I was in Mexico
[1:33:09] City and we were having a glorious
[1:33:13] meeting I've been there about three
[1:33:15] nights and there was a man that I call
[1:33:18] Manana he's supposed to get me at 6:00
[1:33:21] would get me about 9: and I always caus
[1:33:24] you to slow I said he was
[1:33:26] tomorrow and when we got out to this big
[1:33:29] ring where I was preaching they had take
[1:33:31] me up on a ladder up here and let me
[1:33:33] down on ropes on the platform the night
[1:33:36] before there had been a a Mexican
[1:33:39] man that had come to the meeting and the
[1:33:43] old fell raining as it was and he come
[1:33:47] to the platform blind and he came down I
[1:33:50] looked I had good good shoes on a good
[1:33:53] suit and the poor old man is barefooted
[1:33:57] his trousers all ragged and I'll tell
[1:33:59] you who my interpreter was you people
[1:34:01] know him brother
[1:34:02] esposas up here in Sacramento
[1:34:06] California Pentecostal brother he was
[1:34:09] interpreting we had about in the two
[1:34:12] nights I think around about 30 40,000
[1:34:15] converts from Catholicism to
[1:34:17] Christianity the Holy Spirit and this
[1:34:20] old blind man come across the platform
[1:34:23] and if you don't feel for the people
[1:34:25] you're praying for there's no need of
[1:34:27] praying for them you got to field
[1:34:30] yourself in their
[1:34:31] plates and I thought if my old daddy
[1:34:34] would have lived he' have been about the
[1:34:35] age of that old man here he is he's got
[1:34:37] no
[1:34:38] shoes and he had no shirt on an old coat
[1:34:41] ragging Dusty an old hat in his hand
[1:34:44] solded up with cards probably the old
[1:34:47] fell never had a decent meal in his life
[1:34:50] and then how cruel fate had been to him
[1:34:53] here he staggered in
[1:34:55] blindness and his eyes was white I look
[1:34:58] at the old fell and I I just put my arms
[1:35:02] around him and brother espinos wouldn't
[1:35:05] interpret the prayer and I I said
[1:35:07] heavenly father if I could give him my
[1:35:09] shoes I'd just slip out of them so
[1:35:10] nobody see them give him a coat send him
[1:35:14] on the road but he's much larger than I
[1:35:17] but God have mercy on him give him back
[1:35:20] his sight glor
[1:35:22] I looked around he can see as good
[1:35:25] as I could the next night there was a
[1:35:28] rack or Rick as far as this building is
[1:35:32] long about this high with nothing but
[1:35:34] just old Shaws and old ragged
[1:35:37] clothes the economics of Mexico is
[1:35:40] poorly
[1:35:41] balanced maybe Pedro gets he's a brick
[1:35:44] mason he might get 16 pesos a day but
[1:35:48] it'll take four days work to buy him a
[1:35:49] pair of shoes but he'll have to save
[1:35:52] enough out of that to pay a several
[1:35:54] pesos for a grease candle to burn on a
[1:35:57] million dollar gold alar for his
[1:36:00] sins that's what borrows
[1:36:03] me seeing those precious people they
[1:36:07] come there at 9:00 at morning no seats
[1:36:10] to sit down they leaned against one
[1:36:12] another like sheep and a pastor
[1:36:14] raining and women stand their hair
[1:36:17] streaking down soaking wet wait all day
[1:36:20] in a hot sun or rain just to hear the
[1:36:22] word of God oh what will they do when
[1:36:25] Phoenix rises in the day of the Judgment
[1:36:27] with them and find churches everywhere
[1:36:31] and you can't even heard a
[1:36:33] in there she stood or he stood rather
[1:36:37] with his
[1:36:38] sight that night when I got in it was
[1:36:41] raining hard brother Jack Moore many of
[1:36:43] you know him brother
[1:36:45] espinos several of the brethen was on
[1:36:47] the
[1:36:48] platform and Billy my son he usually
[1:36:51] gives our prayer cards and he couldn't
[1:36:53] speak Spanish to those people so he had
[1:36:56] to let Manana do it but he just went
[1:36:58] around to see Manana and didn't sell a
[1:36:59] prayer card so that's where we had to
[1:37:01] watch him selling a prayer card so he
[1:37:04] just watched him and they walk up and
[1:37:06] watched and see that he just hand the
[1:37:07] prayer card to so and so like that so he
[1:37:10] said come to me I got preaching great
[1:37:12] big pile of of clothes laying up there
[1:37:15] how they ever know which belonged to who
[1:37:17] I don't know so they were I was just got
[1:37:21] to speaking and Billy tapped me on the
[1:37:24] shoulder he said Daddy you're going to
[1:37:26] have to do something that little woman
[1:37:27] out there said I've got almost 300
[1:37:29] ushers and they can't even hold her a
[1:37:32] little bitty Spanish girl about so high
[1:37:35] beautiful little thing she had a dead
[1:37:37] baby in her hands under her blanket and
[1:37:41] he said Manana give out every prayer
[1:37:44] card and said she has no prayer card and
[1:37:46] there's the Lion's been standing F there
[1:37:48] for the last two hours waiting for you
[1:37:50] to come
[1:37:51] and said she wants to bring that dead
[1:37:53] baby up here and we can't hold her all
[1:37:55] she'd come right over top of that musers
[1:37:56] run on her feet or anything she was
[1:37:59] persistent she wanted to get there she
[1:38:02] had seen that blind man heal the night
[1:38:06] before she is persistent and I said
[1:38:09] Brother Moore she don't know who I am
[1:38:11] she don't know which is which you just
[1:38:14] go down there and pray for the baby
[1:38:15] that'll settle it she he said all right
[1:38:17] brother Bram so Billy got him with the
[1:38:19] arm like it be me so when on down across
[1:38:21] the platform I turn around I said I am
[1:38:24] very happy to be here
[1:38:27] tonight and the meetings are not strange
[1:38:30] to you people here in
[1:38:31] Phoenix right before me I seen a little
[1:38:34] Mexican baby no teeth laughing in a
[1:38:38] vision sitting out

[1:39:40] hand up on the wet blanket and it rained
[1:39:44] in then and I said Heavenly
[1:39:48] Father this little woman
[1:39:51] no doubt in my mind but what you're
[1:39:54] answering
[1:39:55] her I said I saw the vision that you
[1:39:58] know to be truth of a little baby I'm
[1:40:02] only accepting it by faith that it's
[1:40:05] this baby I don't know the woman nor the
[1:40:08] baby but something you're work on both
[1:40:11] ends of the line and I laid my hands up
[1:40:14] on it and when it did it kicked and
[1:40:16] screamed just as loud as it could scream
[1:40:19] a mother jerked the blanket off and
[1:40:21] there it was alive in her
[1:40:23] arms I said brother espinos don't Mark
[1:40:27] that down but send some good loyal
[1:40:31] person and she was telling it in Mexican
[1:40:35] that the doctor pronounced her baby dead
[1:40:37] with pneumonia that morning about 8 or
[1:40:40] 9:00 and here it was after 10: that
[1:40:43] night and I said sand and get a written
[1:40:48] documented statement from the doctor
[1:40:51] that pronounced the dead and the Mexican
[1:40:53] doctor wrote a statement and signed it I
[1:40:57] pronounce the baby dead no respiration
[1:41:01] or nothing in my office this morning at
[1:41:03] 9:00 and here it is 10:00 that night and
[1:41:06] the next morning the baby was in the
[1:41:08] doctor's office to be examined normally
[1:41:10] again why because the little woman was
[1:41:15] persistent Faith knows no defeat if
[1:41:18] there's 5,000 standing there in Place
[1:41:21] nothing takes a place her church to turn
[1:41:24] her out her neighbors could laugh but a
[1:41:28] God that could open the blind eyes of a
[1:41:30] man the night before could raise her
[1:41:32] baby because he's the same God yester
[1:41:35] did hand
[1:41:37] forever and if this group of people here
[1:41:40] tonight crumb Searchers if you are the
[1:41:43] very God that brought you here it could
