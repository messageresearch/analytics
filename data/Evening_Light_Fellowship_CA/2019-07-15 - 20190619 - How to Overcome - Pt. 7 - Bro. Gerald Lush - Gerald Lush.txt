wonderful words of love eternal life night and by the grace of God the revelation of the little God the revelation of the people that Latian thought where he's got us to come from where where he's taking his back a man for thank God brothers not just that we're sinners saved by grace were the sons and daughters of God that we're fallen from fallen from grace as it were but being brought back to grace a man so we come from eternity and Uighur going back to eternity by the grace of Almighty God and as I've said before that most of the saints are down through the ages down through the years they weren't taught that revelation all they all the only revelation they knew was we're sinners and we need to be saved and Jesus came to save us he met but thank God for the greater revelation the higher revelation the deeper revelation a man of why we are redeemed why we are saved a man these guys why all the father's given me will come to me and I will lose none and amen by the grace of God because amen everyone that God foreknew every seat of God every Son of God amen every daughter of God amen they'll respond to God a man they're gonna respond to our Evan Lee father a man so we're going back where we come from thank God for that for that revelation thank God for that role praising a man I just not just getting saved than going to heaven we're going home a man so I trust you you you'll get that revelation and like I said I got it printed here in my Bible I typed it and taped it in in a certain scripture there and it says some call it heaven I call it home a man and that's the truth a lot of a lot of a lot of people feel they're going to heaven and I'll be honest well you know there there are those that are going to have him that's right because many are called few are chosen so he has chosen the elect he has chosen his family he has chosen his sons and daughters and they're separated from all the arrest a man and we're going to we're going to live with him in the city a man by the grace of Almighty God and a proverb brings it out in the message on how can I overcome Ebro I lighted this he brings it out that that as it is with the Gentiles many called few chosen so it also is with the Jews and he said there's many called a few chosen but again the call are not lost they're going to be there but again the chosen are the elect of God a man a man those that God is God has known as they were from the beginning eternity a man is forever married to backsliding Israel amen and he called you and me to provoke them to jealousy a man so they're going to come back and brother we know we know that's going on in Israel right now it is absolutely tremendous when we realize what's going on in Israel oh brother I tell you this is God is on the move and I tell you if that's going on there what's going on with the bright ear Amen brother if God God is forgetting getting them ready to receive the two messengers of Moses and Elijah or two men with their their anointing on them was God doing with you and me he's getting us ready for the rapture he's getting us ready for the resurrection he's getting us ready to get out of time and into eternity and we realize I got to be honest I realized that we're not far from it when I consider the world and the condition of the world when I consider what's going on and what man is doing a man out there in the world they're crazy you know and they're insane my brother and that I know that we're getting closer and closer and closer to the Resurrection closer and closer to the change and I don't know brother but I if you're a bride you can't you can't focus on anything else if you're a bride you can't pull you had to put your your emphasis on anything else but the resurrection and the rapture amen this is what we're living for a man brother sister any way that there was something going to happening in your life you know maybe tomorrow you heard this is going to happen that was going to happen and you focus on a focus on a focus on to try to avoid it or trying to change I try to change that we're brother we ought to put the more emphasis on the resurrection rapture amen to get out of here and into into eternity and to get out of this body and into a glorified body brother I don't know about you but but the bride is will the bride is along me the bride is longing to get out of this atmosphere and into an atmosphere there's absolutely positive amen where there's nothing negative amen everything is light and it's the laid that cast no shadow praise the name of the Lord old brother I pray God

John's Oh will soon be home a man I remember that looking at the window we're looking for the sign but thank God my father never stopped at the sign he kept on going a van there's too many that stopped at the sign but the bride a man the bride is ordained the bride is predestinated right is instructed a man to keep moving amen and let's pick up our speed move on quickly by the grace of God I

in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ how did I sing again I love him because he first woke [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord hallelujah Amen Lord bless you before ever seated turn with me to the book of Romans chapter 8 the book of Romans chapter 8 and the grace of God be with us some things just want to share with you hopefully eventually that we would get to conclude the message on how can I overcome some quotes there as well as some other things right now that that the Lord sort of laid on my heart and in Romans chapter 8 and this was awfully a message that we will hear eventually by our brother Chad lamb and it was the message that brother Ali came to the house on Friday and played for us and it was is tremendous and so I I was going to remind our brother keep keep the message don't don't don't let it go away amen because I want to share it with the Saints and the things that our brother is highlighting the things that our brother is ministering on and of course shows that know brother Chad lamb he's in the East the pastor now understand of the church that our brother Lonnie Jenkins used to pastor many years ago of course our brother Lonnie has gone on and I thank the Lord for the fellowship I've had with our brother over the years a man and I just feel that he was a wonderful brother with a wonderful spirit and I that he had wonderful revelation a man he had a great spirit and a right attitude a man so God rest his soul and so he's there waiting for us a man by the grace of God and so the Lord willing it'll be I guess after our brother LaFontaine is gone that we'll try to get to play that tape for the church and I don't know if it's on the Internet okay and also again the message I did mention the last service that I have been - bye brother Ron Spencer and again this was a 2011 message and it is tremendous absolutely tremendous and III assume that he's still ministering it the same way if he is he's going to have fewer and fewer in the church for sure because it is really laying in the word amen and challenging the Saints - personally you know to identify with the word a man and it comes down brother to a personal relationship a main issue in Christ and by the grace of Almighty God it's not you in a message or not you an adulterant issue in Christ a man when we and we were were getting more acquainted with Christ through the revelation of the word amen until until Christ is they were to manifest that word in you amen you gonna even make that word flesh in you by the grace of God amen not in your head but in your heart a man so be in prayer and as the Lord will lead we'll we'll air our brother Ron Spencer and also our brother Chad lamb in Romans chapter eight was Chad lambs tax will begin at verse one it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus and it says who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen and it says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death a man in Christ I live in my flesh I die amen but in the spirit in the Holy Ghost in our hearts we have eternal life a man for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus and made me free from the law of sin and death amen he paid the price I couldn't pay it for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh a man in the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ a man because there was no sin in his flesh it was perfect sinless blood that He shed a man and he brought the life of the blood back to you and me the Holy Ghost and he said verse 4 that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us amen hallelujah hallelujah is not me brother it's Christ in me amen it's the label Trace as the labor of his blood in me manifesting the righteousness of God it has been imputed to you and to me thank God and it says that the righteousness of the flesh of the law rather might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is the Holy Ghost amen not your human spirit but it's the Holy Ghost verse five and this is what our brother emphasized for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh amen your life will reflect what it what you are under control of what is controlling you is it your flesh is it your human spirit or is it the Holy Ghost amen for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh they're living for the flesh they're living to please sell amen the living do to do this to gain this to gain that in the natural realm amen but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit a man so we we we give preeminence to spiritual things we give pre evidence to the revelation of the word we get pre evidence to our Lord Jesus Christ a man we get preeminence to the Word of God for these are they that are after the spirit it's just to remind the things of the Spirit and what are the things spirit it's the word hey babe man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and again our brother highlights verse 6 for to be carnally minded is death to put the emphasis on the carnal things of life it is dead putting the emphasis on the natural things of life is dead amen but he said to be spiritually minded is life and peace and it's eternal amen not natural it's eternal through our Lord Jesus Christ so he said what are you carnally minded he said there and he said there our message believers that are currently minded yea this is what he was ministering on and it was it was it was he was straightforward so he said I want I want to get lay this and as a warning he says so that you're not walking in the flesh not walking after the flesh but after the spirit the Holy Spirit so he say if you're walking after the flesh you're currently minded you mind the things of the flesh you're caught up with the things of this world and the things of this life he said Amen that's what you're that's what you're focusing on but they said to be spiritually minded is life and peace and it's eternal Holy Ghost like only goes peace god bless this word you may be seated amen we're going to another scripture shortly but just to share something with you that the Lord should have brought to our attention in a devotional today and this was for today on May the 1st or no this is May the 1st not not today and it says the night cometh when no man can work and it says our Creator as designed men to work both mentally and physically amen God wants you to work mentally and physically in order to enjoy a healthy life he said but there is also another vital dimension to our Labor's it's just not the natural life he said it's just not what we were enjoying in this world a man but he said there's something greater there's something more important and he said many years ago he said I put the following excerpt in my Bible as a reminder and as a challenge to be diligent in the most important labor of all now the natural labor that we're we're doing he said to earn this money or to earn that money to earn somebody's favor but he said the labor that we got to do and then we will do to earn God's favor a man because it is by grace God reveals that it is by grace that were able to light up with it a man and he highlighted one of the messengers of the age and he spoke concerning John Wesley a man and he said John Wesley are we going to do a John Wesley did is the Ministry of this hour going to do what John Wesley did are the believers of this hour are going to take John Wesley as an example of what God is requiring of us amen that a we have the Holy Ghost so we're going to reflect the attitude than a spirit that our that our brother John Wesley had many years ago and he said John Wesley traveled 250 thousand miles a man on horseback not 250 miles 200 a 50,000 miles on a horseback he never had the car or the vehicle than you and I am he never had a bicycle than they have a again in this stage he had a horse and there was a time when John Wesley was right he on his horse and he was going somewhere to preach the gospel and the horse going and stumbled into into a hole in the ground and the horse had broken his leg and what happen did John Wesley you know field just say absolutely discouraged and maybe go looking for another horse no he got off the horse he got down he laid his hands on the horse's leg and he prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the leg was healed a man raised the name of the Lord the broken leg was put back to normal again and he got why because there was for the glory of God and it was for the purpose of God that he was doing what he was doing that he was going where he was going amen and I have I elated to the fact that that our that the government in England they went to John Wesley's house because they couldn't understand his text that he would file with the government at the end of a year because they thought that he was a rich man and why was he reporting just so small a salary he said concerning that all the money that he was collecting all the money that he was getting and so they came and they looked well they were even more shocked when they cut in his house a van because why because they only found maybe a glass they didn't find two or three or four no no they just found one glass they found once that one cup one plate and one for one knife one spoon and so that's what's going on here you know I knew a you don't have much here when it comes to furniture you only got this you only got that well it says all I need is I don't need anything else he said and they said well what have you done he said what all the money you got he said well I give that he said to others a man I give that to this one I give that to that way so for the glory of God amen praise the name of the Lord and brother it's her day it's shock there but again they couldn't they couldn't try to get any more taxes out of him why because he didn't keep the money a man for the grace of God to us mother a man God's grace to you God's grace to me then we not put the emphasis on Mary as I told you they will you did one of these days you're going to who you're going to write get up in the morning and hold nothing if you've got money in the bank you'll get up in the morning and you would own it a man because the day is coming when there's coming a government that's going to take it all oh yeah they'll take it all eventually they're going to take your money don't they take the money for the church everything why because that would that anti-crisis you it's got to paint take take the control of all the bills of all all the countries why because the one that got most gold is wrong yeah they got the most gold a man god Elvis brother to be on our guard got Elvis when I could have bought everything on natural things but I'm spiritual amen knowing that all these things are passing away amen and brother it's going to become a reality I believe we're going to be here for that oh yeah probably God sees our going to stay a little while and he said guys what for God's going to test you and try you definitely bring out the faith of the bride a man that our faith is in the breakroom our faith is not in ourselves a man god help us brother that we're going to put the emphasis on the Holy Ghost the evidence on the resurrection the emphasis on the rapture and give God the glory amen brother that's that's what that's what Wesley did that's why the other messengers did down through the ages amen and that's what even William Brennan did he received a lot of money but he give a lot of money oh yeah oh yeah he did and if somebody one of the brother Columbus brothers that came to me kaor came here for a weekend they told me I don't know I don't know what I don't know what brought it up or about it was they said oh yeah I should they condemned brother Branham he said we're doing this with the money and doing that with the money and doing that with the money yeah and a finally brother had to change at all a van because the government was taxing him on all of it but he was taking it and he was giving it to others yeah oh yeah so they were everything changed but I pray God help us brother give God the preeminence amen give God the pre evidence as John Wesley gave God the preeminence and that's why the government couldn't find anything in the bank in his name couldn't find anything in his house amen and when he died what did he find all he found was a few pennies in his pocket now for that that's was it there was as Richard he was a man so he says he traveled 250,000 miles on horseback an average of 20 miles a day for 40 years what are we doing for God most believers - they're just living for themselves that is the absolute truth brother don't I love regard they're not living for the body not live with a break delivering for themselves oh yeah doing what they want to do today I got to do this today I got to do that today knowing you got to serve God today do when it comes to the natural thing to do wasn't got to do and leave it yeah go on to the natural spiritual think on the Lord meditate on the Lord amen by the grace of Almighty God it's a challenge I'll tell you brother challenge to your faith do you have Holy Ghost faith or intellectual faith you do have it do you have a carnal fee fleshly faith do you have Holy Ghost faith my brother Chad is challenging that what faith do you have any merit many have a fleshly faith then they have an intellectual faith he says in your head but he says not in your heart because in your heart he said you live it in your life amen so get in let's get it out of the head let's get into the heart it's good a man the devil wants us to stop in our heads then the one who stopped in our marriage and think on the word think on this revelation that revelation or this doctrine a doctrine oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I believe it I believe it and then again one of those brothers to bring out oh the devil does too and I've brought that out here the devil does to a man brother but God is looking for a looking for a faith in our hearts go and be on Satan giving us victory over the devil by the grace of God and it says that John Wesley preached mazie John Wesley preached forty thousand servants well forty thousand in 40 years 40 thousand sermons may he was considered a fool it's like yeah maybe you know that he was walking one time they're going somewhere and and then the path was narrow and there was a man there and he says excuse me sir he said to would you move so I can go and he said I don't get it of the way for a fool that's what he said to John Wester John was I said I always do so he went he went around him and went on he read brother he wasn't a fool he was a fool in the eyes of man but not in the eyes of God a man it says he preached fourteen thousand sermons and produced four hundred books why he lived for God morning noon and night it was God God God amen morning noon and night it was preaching preaching sometimes he preached five times a day I told you and it's the truth that he would get up and he would go to the mines were they were mining the different things and he would preach to those that was ever going into the mine and then he would wait for those that came out of the mine and he would preach to them ain't man and then he would go on and he would preach somewhere else and he would go out and preach somewhere else then he would gather it in in in a cemetery and he would stand up on a upon a tombstone and preach why because he couldn't there wasn't enough room in the church for everybody amen so he because back then the graveyard was all around the church and so he would go out there in the yard and just stand on a tombstone and preach yeah my oh my oh my we got to have this over oh we can't go to church we got to have this so we can't preach we got to got to do it this way amen brother just preach amen by the grace of God and it says over light like I said I've seen Saints even in this hour believers even in this hour brother than in the wintertime because they're not allowed religion in their country I said I've seen the pictures of crew believes going out into the wilderness with amaryllis amen and raining and snowing oh yeah radiation and in this day in this hour sometimes in history in America in Canada we got to have everything this way everything's got to be perfect everything gotta be quiet everything got to be comfortable brother was it comfortable for Jesus tempted in all points like as we are yet without seeing a man in any supper this none of us would suffer that's right that's why he says identify with him in the power of his resurrection but go on the Fellowship of his suffering most are not identifying with the Fellowship of his suffering amen oh they think to identify with the power of his resurrection but where's the Fellowship of his suffering yeah because he did it for you so what are you gonna do for him he laid down his life for you now you lay down your life for him by the grace of God John Wesley did Martin Luther did a million other messengers did and I believe the Bible of God in this age he did oh yeah he was attacked by many he was challenged to stop preaching what he preached oh yeah and if ministering brethren today that our challenge to stop reaching that because only wanted to focus on is the doctrine or they want to focus on our honesty or this message or that message or this message brother but they don't want to focus on personal line up with the word amen see Jake Joshua and Caleb to go into the promised land God required something and because they wouldn't do it God killed him in the wilderness not Joshua and Caleb but those that didn't believe those just see God brought them out God did this guy do there and there are the signs of the winners and the power and the miracles that God did in Egypt amen and even coming out of Egypt and going to cross the river dry land oh my amazing and and when the Egyptians followed them God God God let the waters come down and drown them amen and they went here and all the pillar of fire was in front of them and the pillar of fire will go behind them - what for to stop the enemy to blame the enemy amen and God destroyed them oh and he still wouldn't believe God to entrust kheh and in the wilderness God provided meat and men and God provided two bread for him out of heaven and so on oh my one more what much how much more must God do to get to get our faith to get us to really really belly and and walk in the will of God as Joshua and Caleb ate me no they wouldn't do it this is absolutely there shows brother that they never had the seed of God in their heart it couldn't been there if it was they would went on by the grace of God god help us amen if they had the seat of God in their hearts they're gonna lay down their lives for God considering or just considering what God's done listen sorry Lord I'm gonna go on Josh want a turbine their old age they went on a man god help us a man to believe you want to go in the resurrection you want to win the rapture come on well you got to give your life you got to lay down your life here to pick up your life there in a change body in a glorified body brother you can't you can't keep living this life no no not my will father dying be done what is will of God for your life most of taught the kids Internet they got their intellectual mind made up and I want to do this I want to do that I got to do this or I got to do that you gotta only got to do what God wants you to do then he don't because it our God what God wants to do they got their knowledge they got their we human wisdom and not much wisdom no no it's not wisdom just knowledge knowledge they got knowledge they have you man understand me but not Holy Ghost understanding amen amen human understands let's do this you do that the whole ghost comes out - no don't do that Oh Lord I want to go this way yeah but I want you to go this way see what do you want to do what did God want you to do damn it what you're doing are you doing it to please God or please yourself in all thy ways acknowledge him in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen but there's not many I tell you around this message that are that are following God's leadership they're following their own human leadership amen and they got the intellectual knowledge of the message as our brother brings that our brother Chad brings out the intellectual knowledge of the message amen and I believe this and I believe that well he says so does the devil amen but the thing is the devil is not gonna live it oh yeah now Helium person ate it very close but he won't go all the way you have changed your word here and change your word there god help us amen you got to be dead to yourself absolutely amen so the advice so there you're not you're not the carnal mind just following the dirty where's the flesh and your human thoughts and the intellect no that's what the cat's the kernel person and if he kindly minded is dead yeah but to be spiritually minded is life and peace and that's the Holy Ghost in control so what you do you don't do because you figure it out in your head forget that got to come out of your art amen and brother that's what that's what's caused a lot of problems with with the church all the way down through the ages why it's the spiritual mind and the carnal mind hey may they dealt with it right here in the first stage and we know it's the deeds of the Nicolaitans yeah and it comes on down and this spirit gets him and that spirit gets in another spirit hey Mary right the devil bringing confusion amen brother you still doing it even around the message of the hour so brother sister our brother our brother John Wesley preached all those sermons forty thousand servants and he produced four hundred books and he knew ten languages well I know English and I knew fenice but I wonder how many of us ear have spoken in attending our other tongues not many the prophet of God say if you're a believer you'll speak in tongues yeah someone said there's a brother Branham one time he said I was in a meeting and he said I heard this and he said like they were speaking in tongues they believed that and he was trying to impersonate it too brother Branham and he said brother Brent was that God and the Prophet said brother I'm still not able to judge God and yet like I told you that I that I had a supper table and then it's your brother that was sitting next to me he was was making fun of speaking in tongues and he even tried to impersonate it by using a certain regular English word and we understood the word he was saying but he made it trying to say oh yeah that's like speaking in tongues that's the Lord forgive him I said please don't let him do that the prophet of God said he wasn't even a judge God what would make him able to judge God amen as I said I remember when I was baptized in Pentecost and I was looking for the Holy Ghost now praying for the Holy Ghost i lord i want your life in me a man and and I went up to the altar in the Pentecostal church it was Elam and and I another time I there's a number of people that come and pray for me ministers come and pray for me and other brothers because the dollars were usually filled and this will lay danced over the laid hands on you and prayed for you another time I went I got up and the altar was filled so I went I went to a seat a man I went to not the front seat but the next seat and and I knelt down and I started to pray amen and there's others in other seats praying and again there's doers brothers they're going around and and they were going around for seat to another and laying hands on those people pray for them they laid hands on me and prayed for me a man the grace of God in my life and so on and I remember going going home and I was praying and I remember going into the bedroom and this was on Hamill Street and I was went into the bedroom and I knelt down and I prayed and I prayed I said lord I need your anointing I may i lord I in my heart and in my soul I said I need the anointing of the Holy Ghost and I remember getting up and going out and looking out the window and and I seen oh my that the the sunrise that I was seeing I said oh Lord I said that's you as it showed I said lord please in the name of Jesus I said I pray grace that you'll fill me with the Holy Ghost and amen and I and when I was going around the room again and I I felt oh what a lot of grace and what an anointing and what a peace that I felt in my heart and in my soul anybody going by I'm beyond my head it was in my heart and I remember walking walking notes through the door the bedroom door and standing as they were on the top of the stair head there the steps and I said oh lord thank you hallelujah thank you Jesus amen I believe I said lord I have it thank you Lord a man I said now I said if I if you want me to I can speak in tongues a man and I did amen and I can yeah oh yeah probably God said when somebody asked him will it well you know believer speaking time so yes he said you can be it can be like this he said you can be just walking and you can hear brother Branham on tape speaking in tongues and if you can be just walking it says below you don't wash under a million dollar deal to theaters hanumakonda and it's it he said and as you speak in tongues you're you're worshiping the Lord you're talking to the Lord Amen you're in fellowship with God by the grace of God amen but again not many interested in those things today no no no brother I pray God if there's anything we need it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that is the baptism of the resurrection and the rapture Amen brothers you are they quickened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you are the raptured by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet of God so he said we're going to need anything we're going to need a double portion of the Holy Ghost to get off the earth and we will burn it's not just doctrine is not just oh I believe this here I believe that there what is your experience amen whether it's an experience a man there's one thing to be born naturally there's another thing to be born spiritually now the prophet of God brings it out god help us a man there's only one way to overcome and that's by the Holy Ghost yeah you want to overcome takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life overcome your flesh overcome your thoughts overcome your feelings is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we're constantly challenged yeah we are challenged to go by our thoughts the enemy is challenging us to go by our feelings they may wear enemy is challenging us to be led by the flesh to be carnally minded oh you don't have to be spiritual you know you can you can your your religious and you can research a little sense in your flesh like the prophet of God so you can have the Holy Ghost in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell oh yeah he said you can you can be healed and go to hell yeah definitely yeah it's just a no word thing but not an inward thing what we need is healing in our souls amen on the inside of the entire anywhere we need healing is on the inside of the inside born in sin shaped integrity come to the world speaking lies that was David's confession he said in sin did my mother conceive me he ever that nology dear original sin yeah yeah we all come that way as I said it was only one that was Jesus was born without sin because he was virgin born a man by the grace of Almighty God amen brother thank God with a revelry we have a tremendous revelation I pray God that we appreciate it when we consider rather than where the world's going and what the world is doing and it's being destroyed the fire is falling but think that there's gonna be a few that's gonna be raptured as I have been praying I said Oh God have mercy please lord have mercy and mercy of mercy I said Lord you said you said it Lord that if you didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved oh please Lord please I said please don't let us be lost we want to love you we want to serve you we want to sit with you and your throne we want to worship you as the prophecy we I want to introduce you to Jesus but he said then I want to get on my knees and crawl up to his feet amen brother I pray God we have that humility hey man to recognize Jesus for what he's done and what he's doing grace of God brother were saved were kept by the power of God through faith on to salvation the change of our bodies thank God sir brother he preached forty thousand sermons produced for two hundred books and he knew ten languages and at 83 years old 83 years old he was ashamed that he could not preach more than twice a day what so those 83 years old today are glad they don't have the preach yeah that's true but if you got the Holy Ghost you keep on preaching amen by the grace of God amen he was ashamed he could not preach he said more than twice a day and he complained in his diary then there was an increased tendency to lie in bed until nine o'clock ten eleven no he felt bad because he couldn't get up until 5:30 a.m. not p.m. yeah he said he felt an increased tendency to lie in bed and he complained about it terrible and he said on till 5:30 in the morning don't bother me most don't want nobody to bother him at 5:30 in the morning Oh John Wesley a man I pray God give us the anointing brother because we're gone off we're going on beyond what he had was to just sanctification justification and sanctification and even the baptism of the Holy Ghost were going on now to the climax the resurrection and the rapture amen brothers sister what what would they do I love many sermons were they preach how much were they travel you know oh yeah for the words sake for the word sing if they're living in this hour of the Resurrection and the rapture they were preaching justification justification amen saying to the gates the same dedication the baptism and against the measurement against yeah and now we're preaching the resurrection rapture they experienced justification sanctification the baptism and the gifts yeah I was part of that or fifty years ago yeah but what what would experience what we drive a lot this to bring the resurrection and the rapture and all this bringing is a bright revival that's right out of the level of CNH had of the loudest sea and revival out of the pentecost revival amen into the bright revival what is the right bread revival producing the resurrection the rapture amen and revival stirs the people up amen stirring there you buy that the anointing of the Holy Ghost it was the anointing of the Holy Ghost in in in Luther the anointing of the Holy Ghost and Wesley the Pentecostals even the old fashioned Salvation Army and all their other churches amen are the regardless you know any of the Holy Ghost 'red them but it stirred them and they were caught up with the revelation of what God was doing but now the anointing of the Holy Ghost has stirred the bride for the resurrection in the rapture yeah the prophet of God said my message is the climax of the Pentecostal message and he said what for the resurrection and the rapture amen but they got caught up with that but the bride is called out the electors call out listen Saints the ministry has not ordained to go around and preach all these things to everybody no the prophet of God said he said we will not issa reach everyone with this message he said only the elect only the bright Amen so brother there are ministries that think oh we got a group breach this we got a group reach this everywhere everywhere no no no you better be led by the spirit yeah he said we want me and he said listen we won't reach everyone with this message just the elect that's all so brother we got to be led by the spirit and the ministry and brethren out there that travel you got to be led by the spirit brother to make sure that where they're going is God's leadership what they're going to preach as God's leadership amen don't preach this if they're not ordained for it no no no definitely not god Elvis brother had to have a rate rate revelation and understanding when it comes through the ministry amen then you're going to stay with it for the bride for the resurrection for the rapture amen so I I don't know if you remembered the prophets saying that but I've seen it in the book it was on the left side on the bottom I had it and I named my books I got it underlined one won't reach everyone with this message just the bright but there's thing people think well we got to go and preach it everywhere preach it here preach it there no you got to be led by the spirit and preach it to the bright Amen of the Lord Jesus Christ Troy brother I wonder if we do we want God to wake us up 5:30 tomorrow morning to pray you want God to wake your 5:30 maybe to go into his word amen we don't mind good doing it pretty go to work do this do that we're gonna make more money for this more money for that yeah god help us if we're ever emphasises our money we'll be burned with the money yeah there's like last way I say when I go into a bank sometimes than to get money and I said would you give me some of that worthless paper and they just laugh at me I said it's worthless and I said you where I said they're only making us believe that it's worth this and it's worth that but it's not one of these days just gonna strike it that it's not worth anything oh yeah wake up don't don't go to sleep and let the devil deceive you it's not worth anything and I assume you say again you're gonna wake in the morning and you won't own anything you won't even know him to house your in you won't own the vehicle you're in amen the governor take controller at all he gonna need it before to get to control of this condom and that kingdom and this nation that nation another nation very Marion is collateral he's going to need all this was collateral to pay them out of their debts oh yeah there's not there's not a nation but sin debt in debt in debt but there's a there's a king the kingdom and an antichrist rising it's gonna take control you buy them out yeah God see that's why that's what's coming that's how it's coming amen grace of God and he saw the garlis of where we live we are surrounded by lonely hurting fearful people and our Lord is not willing that any of these should perish and he said they are they important enough for us to take time out of our busy schedules to reach out and to minister to their needs amen he said one of the frequently neglected areas of outreach may even lie in our own congregations amen and that's truth where are the believers that are serving one another where are the believers then living from one another yeah that are that are thinking about this brother thinking about this sister you know maybe within the local assembly it might be somebody across the island hey man could be somebody again it could be the brothers and sisters in New Brunswick wherever you know or downtown Ontario some of them amen or we can see every concerned over them how are we praying for them a man are we there to help them by the grace of God oh come on this consider what God's done for us to what Jesus has done for us hey man sweet sir brother are they important enough to for us to take time out of our busy schedules to reach out and minister to their needs now I tell you that more caught up with their own needs than the needs of the body that's the truth they're not living for the body they're not living for Jesus to living for themselves thank you Jesus we have saved me amen I believe it no you don't he knows it can you believe it you're going to live it you're gonna reflect it amen you'll reflect his life his attitude history what he did amen old brother I just think this is not a this is not a message believer that wrote this it's amazing even concerning the what we had heard on the internet concerning the eagle my brother Hank Bobby Thompson yeah and we would consider it Baptists yeah but I did some research and I found that he's his link he's on message believers a number of message believers pages they got this link this link this link and I was surprised when it kind of oh here's the one we heard Bobby Thompson concerning Eagles yeah it's amazing he sound like a message believer way he was preaching I understand there's ruther Matthew said he would've met a 40 years ago that he then he breached it oh yeah he wouldn't he wouldn't last long in the Baptist Church today preaching that no no no and of course it's getting to the place where wouldn't last long in a message church that's right because the people we just want just we just preach a doctrine don't get personal well God's gonna get personal a man he got personal with Peter thank God for Peter a man he's the example for you and me brother Amen Jesus got personal with him when he was here and after Jesus laid down his life picked it up again and came back he still got personal with Peter and he challenged Peters faith a man but he knew Peter was gonna was going to get what he was lacking on the day of Pentecost he got the baptism of divine love cuz Jesus kept saying lover stuff me lover semi-lattice thought me a man Peter was going from filial to agape love human love divine love and so on so but he needed the baptism of divine love to know what it was all about I don't know what Christ did amen a brother of the day of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine law because God is not you know as their only definition of God in the Bible it says God is a spirit but when it comes to his nature is character God is love amen is that the only death is that the explanation of your nature oh brother Shawn's own sister zones or their love what oh yes their love you know them can they say your listen I met someone the other day and I'm sure their Christian how'd you know that their spirit and their attitude I know that they they have a Christian spirit and a Christian attitude and a Christian action and so on let me say it for the glory of God that when I worked for the American military I was a cookie and I was a also cooking where they call it where they would taken it out they would call and pick it up no did they would call in an order and I would make the order and get it ready for them they pick it up it was the American military soldiers and so on and and I was also helping the cooks in the kitchen and one of the cooks I never heard it too many years a number of years later they said you know the cook that you he was the chef that you work with said yes I know well they said I was advised the other day that he told somebody that he only met one Christian star Xenu he said I don't I've only met one Christian he said in the world that I know of and he said that was he said a young man that I work with in Goose Bay and he said it was Jarrell lush they said y-yeah I said sir they said everybody just considered him a Christian in in in the kitchen in the dining area everywhere nice at all I swore to God be the glory I said it's certainly not me I said it's the Laurie oh yeah and I thank God further for the respect that they had for me so to God be the glory and I also worked with Pentecostals I work with different religious people but he said could relate his attitude and his spirit he said I felt was Christian he said I won't forget it or to God be the glory so brother sister if you got a testimony give God the glory because there's not me that lives this Christ that liveth in me a man if I do anything right it's got to be Christ if I say anything right it's got to be Jesus anybody it's not me it's Jesus so brother I pray grace oh my lord what a testimony not a witness amen for the grace of God and he said again regardless of where we live we are surrounded by lonely earning fearful people our Lord is not willing that any of these should perish are they important enough for us to take time out of our busy schedules and reach out to minister to their needs and is one of the frequently neglected areas of overreach may even lie in our own congregations where struggles and trials are often concealed from the casual observer amen and again this was the beside still waters devotional they first amazing and the prophet of God had respect for them for that particular church oh yeah he did and he said I'm not sure the religion now but he did say if he did this did that EBE be a good believer in that church he'd be considered a good believer a man grace of God no mind didn't mean to take that much time but the will of God be done it's giving the people what they need it's what our brother preached amen that we give it and then you receive it but and brother I think God's ministry in it because of the lateness of the hour and brother if God's looking for anything to rapture that's what he's looking for that right spirit and that right attitude brother the anointing that Luther had been knowing that Wesley had plus denying that the Pentecostals had plus a man oh yeah we don't do away with Luther and Wesley and Penny and Pentecost amen God's requiring that plus he guys and I just were just pushing them aside and giving us this then push off the side give them that no no no he gave Luther that and then he added Wesley then he added the Pentecostals and now it's too bright amen God is adding to the revelation hey man so the fullness of the of the word is revealed amen bear with me Oh hard to believe in over an hour well John Wesley wouldn't worry about it he meant and again I'll be honest I wish I had I wish I could have preached another three or four servings a week oh yeah you do oh yes most definitely why because I recognize the lateness of the hour and I recognize the need for more and more of that revelation of that word amen recognize the need to die more and more to ourselves and become more more alive sensitive to the word Amen faith comes by hearing the word and if you're going to have resurrection rupturing faith it's by hearing the word very man not intellectually but in your heart in your soul and you're dead and the word is alive in you amen so that you're giving the preeminence you can't get away from it the resurrection you can't get away from the revelation of the rapture I don't know morning no Luther couldn't get away from justification and if and if Wesley preached as much as he did he couldn't get away from the revelation of sanctification what God had done a man in Christ for them now he's getting the people to rejoice in it it's done we're sanctified we're sanctified come on praise the Lord we're sanctified Jesus sanctified us Jesus justified us a man now Jesus give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the resurrection and the rapture now he's asking us to believe that they they went and declared the revelation God gave them now let's declare the revelation that God has given us now just think that he ought me of the word and again going back to what we preach willed me of the word and the revelation of the seven seals it's a third pole for rapturing faith now that's what the Prophet told us youth he wanted to stay for the rapture but he said he got he felt God had ordained for him to go on but he said again why cry speak he said if one child one boy one girl one man one woman would raised her hands their Lord or coming home and he said that will treat her the rapture this one's gonna be caught up that one's gonna be cut off that one but it begins he's not going to be many not living Saints when we're going to go as a thief in the night as a thief in the night and not many know when the thief comes and goes yeah and it's in the night but he said you're not children of night your children on the day turn of the light you're late walking the light amen the revelation of the Resurrection revelations rapture you let's be among the missing ones by the grace of God amen this was a quote that our brother Carson had given me so quite some time ago and it says never before as the Church of the Living God endure such attacks from the devil and that's true we need one another's love and when we do this we fulfill the law of Christ this is something that we can do our absolute best at knowing that it is the right thing to do it is the essence of the law to do our utmost for one another hmm amazing encouraging our brothers and sisters in the faith so what are we waiting for reach out to someone today and let them know there is a Living God he said a person who lives their life for their self lives a selfish life and most believers today are living selfish lives yeah he's we must live for others this was in 1950 and the message was entitled at thy word we must live our lives for others and burying one another's burdens oh don't just push it off in their lap take it on your shoulder bear one another's burdens pray for one another be there to help one another amen by the grace of God sure you're praying grace Lord to help this brother bless this sister or they need your help Lord bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ and we got to have a feeling for one another and therefore when we do when you do all you know - how to do then when you do lay down at night well you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best and I mean that knowing that you did your best for the Lord and for the body of Christ amen brother then it proves that you're an overcomer by the grace of Almighty God amen turn with me for the next few moments here to Hebrews the book of Hebrews chapter c2 the book of Hebrews chapter 2 beginning to read at verse 1 and it was either not sure and either brother Spencer or brother lamb that quoted this descriptor therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip or that we should slip away from them and our brother one of their brothers there was bringing out that revelation that many a believer is slipping away from the revelation of the word many a believers slipping away from the revelation of the message this revelation that revelation why because they are currently minded and not spiritually minded so he said give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard and how many believers are really putting the emphasis on there were on the message morning noon and night thanking God for it experiencing the revelation the rapturing faith resurrection faith amen this is the faith that God is looking for beyond the faith that he was looking for in Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals he's looking for a resurrection rapturing faith amen and brother for overcomers were experiencing resurrection in rap for anything that's right you had he resurrected and we had been caught up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the father God said what's going on there the words been revealed and what's it for so we can rapture our bodies and be changed in a moment in the twenty of and I a man we ought to give them more earnest heed while people are giving earnest heed to the natural things of life but what about the spiritual to the things which we have heard and give the more earnest heed to what you've heard tonight lest at any time we should let them slip or that we should slip away from them don't slip away from the word don't step away from the message don't step away from what God has done and God is doing no if we do we're gonna miss the resurrection and the rapture and we'll be numbered with those who are going to be looking for it and reminded that it's past and didn't know it for if the word spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which had the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hallelujah God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will not your will is will for your life so let's give the more earnest heed lest at any time we find that we are slipping away from the revelation of the rapture slipping away from the revelation of the resurrection why because we're more caught up with the natural things of life than the spiritual we're given earnest heed to doing this doing this the natural the natural I got to do this I got to do this yeah what about the Lord oh well Lord I'll see you Wednesday Lord I'll see you Sunday Lord I'll talk to you tomorrow in the morning or maybe before I go to bed no you got to talk to him morning noon and night 24 hours a day even when you sleep your heart is community he's in your heart by the power of the Holy Ghost unfortunately many make sure you got the Holy Ghost in your heart if not you'll be found slipping away from the word slipping away not necessarily intellectually but spiritually well if you know it spiritually if he experienced the message spiritually then it controls your life but if you got it intellectually no it just controls your thoughts and you can be religious and you can talk this and say this and say that yeah but don't don't say it show it by the grace of God so that they can see it in your spirit and in your attitude yeah and again that time in Goose Bay there was an elderly man that was working there and basically I was the I was the head over the over the those employees back then and I remember just Devin do discuss are not discussed something but I was just getting him to do something one night there and he said excuse me yes sir he said just wanted to say he said I believe he said you're a Christian I said well I said by the grace of God noise that I know it he said by your spirit and your attitude I said well thank you for your comments brother it's the Lord bless you yeah he was he was an elderly man I was very young then I don't know how maybe the 21 maybe not that 20 years old and I said well I said to God be the glory I see interested and God bless you and again I don't let it go on and pop me up I want it to puff up the Lord I wanted to give God the glory any man you want to give God the glory let him see Christ in you amen and give the glory to him you're not going to boast no accepted the Lord by the grace of God a man I have to finish with this it's naughty that starts is he that finishes man he started the race but there's one finishing it there will be many churches start many groups of people there will be one group finish that's the overcomers a man now he said we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it he said it's humility he said gird yourself or you gonna girded of Jesus girded himself took a towel wash the disciples feet and wake them and the very God of heaven humiliated himself amazing that God got down and washed the disciples feet amen grace brother your table of grace I merited favor grace Jesus magnified it that's right he said we don't want to be humiliated he said but greatness he said humiliates itself grace almost itself he said I've had the privilege of getting he said meaning some great man and it's these guys has got a change of clothing and fifty cents in their pocket to rattle and he said that's the guy that thinks he's something that he wants when he's nothing but he said I stood with a great man I mean great man with ragged sleeves cuffs and he said they make you think you're the great person and he says see greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility and he said I don't mean dirty I mean humble in spirit I'm talking about humility genuine humility not some of us put on something that is real humility he said and overcome means to stand the test a man and every day that were were tested God tests us oh yeah sometimes he allows the enemy to come by and test you to bring out what spirit you're off to bring up the to prove to the enemy that it's your it's his spirit in you it's not you the lives as Christ liveth in you amen brother god help us that we're going to humble ourselves and brother if you humble yourself to anyone is to one another yeah brother Brown says you don't consider yourself any better or even bigger than somebody else you should you put yourself on the same level oh yeah we're all whether it's you or me we're sinners saved by grace Lord thank you for saving my brother and sister and thank you for saving me amen so we overcome means to stand the test by the grace of God Jesus overcome the grave all the word and humility a man he said overcome means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks so don't let the devil trick you with your thoughts well I'm going to do this I think we should do this I think we should do that do what God wants you to do the leadership of the Holy Ghost is not Satan Oh No if a Satan is controlling your thoughts you get you to do in everything that's contrary to the will of God hey man you'll get you eating there might be just a little bit here a little bit there yet but if it's contrary to the will of God brother one word in the eyes of God it's the whole truth amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God and to disbelieve one word in the eyes of God you just believe it all so overcome means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks and a lot of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that he said there is a real devil and he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil he said and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil please don't go out there and live the life and think that think that oh no no the devil is always over there somewhere he's out there doing that he said they're doing that no he's right there on your heels father God said he's been on the heels of the bride ever since Calvary he was on the heels of the bridegroom and he and he put him on the on the cross and he got the people to a turn against him to crucify you and Jesus willingly willingly let them do it because he could have called the Father twelve legions of angels to destroy the world set him free but he didn't do it and the devil was their brother and brother and now he's on the heels of the bride that's right he said all the way down through the search ages he's been on the heels of the bride how much more is he on the use of the bride to sort of deign to the resurrection rapture Satan has seen things that the believers don't see yeah now the true believers see it but the make believers don't see it as they should please don't let the devil deceive you so either there's a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil and to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than II and he said the one that's in you as already ready overcome him the devil and by His grace you're more than a match for him amen there's real there he said is real overcoming a man but remember a greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world he said you must realize that the Holy Spirit is in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him by the Holy Ghost amen I had to stop there but I want you to understand again why did brother Brown preach this I hope you haven't forgotten it it's because it's amazing but he explained that air in the air did the Indus message he preaches it because he was recognizing that many in Brenham Tabernacle were not overcomers 1963 in August and we'll get to it eventually where he he highlights that there's many I'll tell you this is like I've said it so often before then if the Prophet were to come back he wouldn't he wouldn't say nothing both denominations and those churches are there he would just focus on the message churches why God what are you recognizing about him tabernacle he's recognizing in-seok among among so-called believers around the world a lack of Resurrection and rapturing faith a man he would recognize that they were not overcomers they had not gone on to perfection they had not gone on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and become overcomers overcoming the world the flesh and the devil because the Prophet was recognizing that even in Brenham tabernacle in 1963 many we're starting to take the ways of the world and the things of the world they wanted more and more and more he said you want to be like the world you ought to be like he said those are there in denominations yeah he said I'll keep preaching it to you stop doing it yeah yeah so he kept emphasizing that he kept laying in that Lane in the the hints here and there so I pray the grace of God help us brother yeah we're good that we're going to become overcomers of the world the flesh and the devil amen so if the prophet Cohn he wouldn't have to preach how can I overcome to this church because we are overcomers you are an overcomer the life you live proves you're an overcomer Amen by the grace of God your attitude your spirit toward one another proves you're an overcomer amen as he overcame we overcome because it's Christ in me amen I'll tell you this I pray God that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost not the Holy Ghost because again as the Prophet said I wanted to know we said that Christ that Antichrist our twins in the same church so make sure you're worshiping the right one anyway you're worshiping Christ not Antichrist and then brother in the in the last days they're gonna be worshipping the devil thinking they're worshiping God so god help us brother there were gonna be overcomers of that deception in our lives by the grace of God so to give them more earnest heed to the things we have heard lest at any time that we would let them slip or slip away from them they meant grace to us if I pray amen nor bless you let's stand praise the Lord amen this thing we shall see the king there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon it may be evening morning or at noon the wedding of the bride United
