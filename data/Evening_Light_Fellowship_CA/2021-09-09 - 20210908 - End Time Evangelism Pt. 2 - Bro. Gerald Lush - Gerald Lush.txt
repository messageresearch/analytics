meet you and he's with you he's with that sister he's with that brother amen we can have real fellowship praise the lord because i'll tell you this there's a lot of church you can go to and jesus is not there amen why because according to the book of revelation he was put out amen he said be old i stand in the door and knock and amen just think he's on the outside knocking but i trust by the grace of god he's on the inside amen and brothers there's knocking he's bringing the word to your to your attention amen by the grace of almighty god all wonderful thank god for the revelation thank god for the word thank god hallelujah that we that oh my for the revelation of who he is where he is amen and and the revelation of his will amen his word again again for us it's just it's just oh this is not just a bible it's not a history book no indeed amen it is the revelation of god the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end praise the lord and he's given us a revelation of his will his work and his pattern right from beginning to end what he started why he started it praise the lord amen the part that you have in it praise the lord praise the lord and bring and bring us into a oneness with what he's doing amen praise the lord again brother that we oh yes to god be the glory that we got the revelation of who he is where he is and what he's doing amen and again oh it's not always just he just did this he did that he did that brother we're a part of what he's doing amen praise the lord he's not past tense in your life amen and not just future tense he is present tense amen to many he just past tense oh yeah well they go to this church and oh jesus did this he did that what's he doing amen they don't have the revelation of what he is doing amen so i pray grace that we have a revelation of what he's doing oh yeah even even concerning the ministry of the hour oh he did this in william branham he did this in this brother and that brother and so on but what's he doing in you amen because remembering all that he did in others was to get your attention amen so that it so that we're going to open up our our hearts and our lives for so he can continue it in us amen remember whatever he did down through the ages or whether it's paul or right on through unto the messengers brother he did this and he did that amen but he he get your attention hallelujah to get your faith so that he could he could continue what he was doing in your life praise the lord and he didn't just do it in paul he didn't just do it in luther or wesley or or or brother branham or any other minister amen brother he or through those ministries brother he went and he got the attention of others to humble themselves repent why so that he could do it in them he continue in them continue in them and i trust by the grace of god that what he did in the in the ministry of malachi 4 he's continuing in us amen brother he's gone but but the word's not gone amen the message is not gone god is not gone amen because of all that the ministry declared he's here to make it flesh and you and me oh yes indeed he's there to to bring it to pass in your life and in mind amen because what the all the emphasis that the ministry was putting on on the lord putting on the bride putting on the break room amen putting on the marriage supper brother he's bringing it to pass amen in you and in me praise the lord what he what he talked about what he preached god is is doing it in you and me oh yeah praise the lord there's too many still oh yeah god did this god did that as like i mentioned it last time i preached and and again it was when i was ministering in 1995 i think and it was in the in brother fulcher's church in virginia and i said listen and it's like that's quite a while ago and i said listen i said when i said when i said even after the bride is gone i said they'll be here preaching god sent a prophet oh yeah there oh god did this god did that but i said brother we're we're into the present tense revelation of what he's doing amen he did that to get our attention amen to bring us into the present tense amen so that he could be in us not all love we're rejoicing over not what god did will rejoice in what god is doing amen oh yes but what he did it was just pointing to this point into this get our attention amen and get and help us to let go and god have his way amen now praise the lord brother is not just saying oh god sent a prophet and he did this and he did that amen but i trust brother the revelation of the mystery of god he's making it flesh in you and me amen what he did he's bringing it to pass now i'm fulfilling it in you and me amen that we're moving to remember what he did in luther he oh yeah he he made it made it flesh in the bride in that age yeah in the elect of that age and all down through amen oh yeah luther was justified and and he gave a revelation to the others oh they oh they were justified they were sanctified they were filled with the holy ghost they had access to the gifts amen and you and i got access to the mystery of god amen yes sir praise the lord and the resurrection and the rapture amen oh praise god brother oh my what is it it is the omega oh i trust oh yeah we know the the alpha what about the omega oh brother i pray grace amen that we're getting more and more into the revelation of the omega amen is it is the beginning and the end and he's making it flesh in you and fleshing me amen we're going forth as witnesses to the world what god is doing amen and we're focusing amen not on this old world we're focusing on the world to come amen we're focusing not on this life but on eternal life oh brother i pray grace that we're not just caught up with just the natural things of life the natural things of life we're caught up with the spiritual amen more more we are more interested in the spiritual than the natural amen we're just doing this because we got to do it amen oh we got to do this we got to do that you know because physically we're we're living it physically we need this right but we're not going to worship it amen we'll just follow it as god gives us the leadership to follow it amen but really what we're going to focus on is the resurrection we're going to focus on amen is the lord and the coming of the lord the rapture the resurrection the marriage suffered the lamb amen brother again preaching on end time evangelism this is what end time evangelism is all about it's focusing on what god is doing amen what he did is to point us to what he's doing amen what he's doing bother by the grace of god so he wants to do it in you and me by the grace of god amen so brother we're not history and god's not history amen what and the word is not history it's the present tense praise the lord hallelujah let go as our brother was praying or someone mentioned let go and let god have his way by the grace of god well what does god want to do oh he does he want to do this he want to do that you what god wants to do brother he wants to bring it into reality the resurrection amen amen amen and the rapture he wants oh yeah that's what he's working on probably god said all that god has done down through the when it comes to the in this endtime ministry amen other prophet in these last days he said why what is god doing he said he's he's given the word the mystery of god he said to give us rapturing faith amen praise the lord hallelujah brother of all that the others were when it went preached on and stood on amen and they were witness above amen god was doing it all down through their the age they lived in amen and the believers that that believed it they went forth manifesting what god had revealed oh yeah they they went forth living and manifesting justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit what's he what's he doing now it's the resurrection of the rapture amen so we're not going to just back there we thank god for it

lord hallelujah thou i believe me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah god bless you turn with me to ii corinthians again ii corinthians chapter 4 amen and by the grace of god we'll try to get through some of these notes here and maybe touch on some things in the message that brother branham preached in 1962 concerning the end time evangelism what he was focusing on what god was focusing on and are we focusing on the same thing amen i believe that we ought to because there are those that feel anytime evangelism is this is sad something else but the problem of god clearly identifies amen that the end time evangelism for the bride for the elect is to get us into a resurrection and a rapturing faith amen and for god to bring to pass the promise of the resurrection amen the promise of the rapture do we truly sincerely honestly believe amen that there is a resurrection amen do we truly sincerely and honestly believe that there is a rapture so i pray the grace of god amen that brother sister our faith is going to be going to come out our faith is going to be made flesh by the grace of god amen god's really going to see that you believe in the resurrection god really is going to say that you really believe in their the rapture oh my brother's one thing that to preach it there's nothing to believe it oh yeah it's just one thing even to be into a church that's preaching it constantly but nothing to really truly in your heart believe it amen that's what god is working on brother is to bring of that faith in in the heart of the bride brother i i trust we are the right amen and that what god has worked on god is working on amen he put it in our hearts the revelation now he wants to make it flesh now he wants to bring it to pass amen brother a god god has always done that down through the ages with other revelations and other things that that uh he has faith that he wanted that generation to have that generation that generation amen he gave them the word then he put them to the test to bring out the faith amen he has given us the word he's given us amen the message but now he's pointing us to the test amen to bring out our faith in the resurrection our faith for the rapture do you believe it amen believe us thou this as we brought out last during the service concerning lazarus and martha and jesus was challenging her faith present tense amen oh concerning lazarus that he's going to rise be come and come back again from the dead oh yes she said he'll be back in the in the in the resurrection and to her was up maybe 2 000 years and so on jesus said i am the resurrection this is absolutely amazing amen they believed in a resurrection but to them it was up in the future but jesus said i am amen brother he wanted he wanted martha to have the present tense revelation of the resurrection amen and brother we need the present tense revelation of the resurrection hallelujah brother all generations all other church ages oh they believed this they believed that they took their stand for they took their stand for that amen praise the lord believing for redemption right believing for redemption redemption redemption but then there come a generation that god was going to what for get us to believe the resurrection not just redemption resurrection amen that the purpose for which god has saved us the purpose for which god has changed us the purpose of which god has redeemed us is to resurrect us amen to bring us back again to what we were in the beginning hallelujah to god be the glory so brother sister i trust by grace that what god has done and what god is doing is bringing us into a greater and a greater and a greater revelation of the resurrection we're focusing on the resurrection and the rapture and that god is going to bring it to pass in you and in me amen god is going to make it flesh in you and me amen brother listen understand all the other agents he did this he did that amen and they believed but the thing of it is they stopped and they just keep believing it and made a denomination out of it but god wanted him to go on go on go on move on move on to another to a greater revelation amen but they they oh they didn't they just felt this is all we need now yeah no brother because why with if they if they went ahead of justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost oh well praise the lord we got that justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost oh praise the lord thank you lord but now he wants us to believe for something else amen now he's given us the word to give us the faith oh to go on oh but wait a minute lord you did this you did that thank you lord hallelujah oh and the baptism of the holy ghost is wonderful thank you jesus yes he said that's good but now he said i want you to go on what do you want now i'm looking for the resurrection oh oh you're looking for the resurrection god gave us grace and god will give us the faith brother so that's not like what the attitude martha had amen oh yeah lord we believe there will be a resurrection no i'm doing it now amen brother because i tell you this in the ministry of malachi 4 in the ministry of william bradham brother the dead was raised yeah and brother then and it was a four or five times that the dead was raised and brother and not only a human being but he also raised the he raised animals oh yeah he brought them back to life oh my brother sister hallelujah this is this is the absolute resurrection the absolute turning us back to what we started with in the beginning god help us to believe brother we are without excuse because brother what he told martha he is he has told us and he proved it amen he proved to the mouth that i am the resurrection he said lazarus come first yeah he was dead stood up cut up amen brother so in this hour and then the hour of the resurrection in this age brother the res the dead was raised amen and there was five testimonies of the dead being raised amen and what did the prophet of god do he just spoke the word amen spoke the word brother what what are we going to do speak the word brother god help us to speak the word amen brother brothers hallelujah this gives us the victory over the world gives us victory over the flesh amen victory over the devil get thee behind me satan it is written thus saith the lord amen god help us brother to have the faith to speak the word and get the victory over the world the flesh and the devil amen brother anything god did in this hour it was to give us that victory amen oh yes we are with that excuse god help us amen shall begin our scriptures if first corinthians no second corinthians sorry second corinthians chapter four i may have read this already a number of times but in second corinthians 4 and beginning to read at verse 6 again for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness as shined in our hearts i trust it's the light of god in your heart that brings us here tonight amen and to give the light of the knowledge the light of the knowledge amen of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ praise the lord but we have this treasure praise the lord it's the treasure amen and we have it in earthen vessels to god be the glory thank you jesus that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us hallelujah that we're going for with that faith hallelujah that is no it's not me it's not you it's god in you amen he has made flesh in you praise the lord so it is he said that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us let's give him the glory hallelujah let's go forth in living the life brother it is not you it's jesus amen we are troubled on every side amen concerning the world in which we live but yet not distressed why because we got that faith of what god is doing we got that faith of where we come from and where we're going amen and we've got that faith of what's going on in the world praise the lord and it says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed god help us we are perplexed but not in despair we know god is in control persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed praise the lord always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus amen brother that brother that we're dying more and more to the world and the things of the world amen so our we are always every day bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus amen that the life also of jesus praise the lord that the life of jesus this is amazing it is a challenge to our faith that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body grace grace grace is the life of christ in you amen is the life of christ manifest in you hallelujah brother if it is we give the glory to jesus amen we're going to reflect jesus for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh brother that his life might be manifest in our body that his life be manifest in our mortal flesh oh getting to a greater and a greater experience brother so you go you it's not just oh wow this is god did this god did that it is spiritual something in my heart in my soul brothers jesus in control soul body and spirit amen giving us victory over the world the flesh the devil praise the lord amen so is christ in control is christ in you to such an extent amen brother you can't you can't get away from it oh he's with you morning noon and night every day you can't for forget him if you're like i said if you're driving your car and you're going down the street and you're doing no matter how busy it is you can't forget jesus and like i said i drove do i drive and drive and drive and i'm doing this doing that you're coming down to a light oh but again there's a spiritual revelation strikes your heart you can't get away from it can't get away from it no if he's in control amen your thoughts your words your dates amen are going to be influenced by him god help us that we're not living for ourselves we're living for jesus it's not me that lives it's christ that lives in me that's tremendous brother's a challenge no wonder the place the prophet of god has said he said when it comes to the rapture and then and that sister said brother branham what if god asked you to pick to choose to choose the bride you had to go into rapture and so on he said i might find it doesn't it doesn't yeah and again there's another quote right there somewhere where is this where they asking all about you know how many is going to go into rapture he said it might be that was in 1962 i think he said there might be 500 they said 500 yeah 500 around the world well is that scriptural yes even less than that because he did as he got near the end of his ministry he got down to the place where he said oh oh no there might be this 200 300 there might be this and so on just a few why is that scriptural yes what scripture is it the bible says when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth that's right amen why it's going to be why because the devil is going to have such control and there's going to be such unbelief how many really believe i trust by god by grace that you're believing here in the name of jesus you're believing in your heart in your soul amen that it oh it's it's a real anointing a real holy ghost faith brother you can't get away from it's there morning new tonight you can't get away from jesus do you think about him oh yeah and people oh yeah brother the world going to call you fanatical oh yeah praise the lord i trust by grace you'll recognize yourself as being fanatical in the eyes in the eyes of the world why because you're you're spiritual you're spiritual amen because most of the world is just religious or they talk about jesus and they'll they'll talk about this and that but they're not spiritual they're just religious amen oh so i pray the grace of god that we are spiritual and brother we just can't get away from it christ in us christ in control christ living christ making the decisions not you amen follow his leadership i don't care what it is he's controlling you 24 hours a day he's controlling every part of your life amen you give the glory to jesus amen and verse 11 again for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh amen brother and it's constantly going on and i trust brother sister that he his life is manifest in you praise the lord and that's what the world will see you're different the world will know you're different you act different you talk different amen your decisions are different oh yeah how you do things when where and amen oh to the world you might be religious to god you're spiritual praise the name of the lord oh yeah you can't walk down the street without thinking about jesus you can't drive down the street without thinking about jesus amen if you're really really born again brother you're conscious of what's going on in this whole world amen and you're hungry and thirsting for the kingdom of god you're hunging and thirsting for the new body yeah well yeah to get out of here brother see that's in the bible whatever god did and he was revealing it to those in his in that day they they focused on it focused on it amen they wanted more and more of god amen brother if there's anything we want we don't want this whole world we're living in definitely not we're sick of it we're tartar why because who's in control the devil he's the god of this world he is he's come down with great wrath because he knows his time is short and as i've said if what god has done and what god is doing give the devil that faith oh yeah he's come down great brad he knows his time is short how does he know that he knows by what god is doing amen what's going on in the earth praise the lord brother i pray grace i pray he's come there with great wrath i pray we're looking up with great faith praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus oh he's just because he knows his time is short amen we know time is short but we're not going to we're not going to die we're going to go into eternal life praise the lord amen to god be the glory so he said then death worketh in us but life in you and he through the ministry and we're having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen see speak the word amen knowing that he which raise up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you praise the lord hallelujah for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not hallelujah but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day hallelujah hallelujah don't wait for old age to come and tell you that yeah then the outside man as a word is is is going away it's dying oh yeah but like the inward man is telling me you know we're going to there's going to be a resurrection now i trust you've got a greater experience amen whether you're young or whether you're old you've got the same faith for the resurrection just think jesus was only 33 years old amen so i pray the grace of god that that in our youth that we believe in the resurrection yeah jesus was going to lay his life down pick it up again yeah grace brother because he did now we're picking up our life onto eternal life amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory oh i trust brother we feel it's in our souls and while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen amen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal god bless his word you may be seated and god help us amen in these last days and brother in the word and in the revelation of the message that god has given us that we're going to focus more and more on eternity because if there's anything that's been revealed and manifested in these days and in the ministry of a prophet is eternity amen brother other ministries oh it's just god coming down and blessing this ministry ministering to this ministry ministering to the natural and so on but brother god sent a ministry of a prophet and the anointing alleluia and the resurrected jesus was revealed in that flesh amen it's not just not just this doctrine or that doctrine this theology or that theology amen brother oh yes and it was an experience too because they had the experience of of sanctification justification and the the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen thank god for those experiences but i pray the grace of god that we're getting into the experience that god wants to get wants us to have in this hour and it is the experience of the resurrection it is the experience of the rapture god has given us a greater and a greater revelation of what he has done and what he's doing amen well yes oh lord you did this it was the power of god this was the anointing that was jesus he did this he did that but brother the revelation of jesus comes more and more and more from justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit it comes right on into eternal life amen right on in to the resurrection and the rapture oh we know that jesus is this jesus is that praise the lord amen this is the revelation of jesus that god was revealing down through the ages amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah oh i don't have time really to get into the to the church ages there and then the book of revelation chapter 2 to show you what god was was doing down through the church ages amen god was revealing jesus christ god was repeating eternal life amen this revelation that revelation now i said you're going to have this oh yeah i said oh yeah the devil is going to get in and he made a denomination out of it they started the roman catholic church amen around 300 a.d amen and then man began to get more and more into religion and less and less spiritual but god said i'm going to restore and so god began to under wesley and under luther and so on amen god began to bring us back to the truth of his word amen praise the name unto the revelation of our lord jesus christ as our lord as our savior as our resurrection and into rapture amen why because we needed it so brother now he comes right on in now god required this god required that god required that but now what's he required amen what he required it was revealed in luther's hour wesley's hour pentecostal age but brother what god is requiring now amen are we getting into that faith what is it the resurrection and the rapture oh well we think that what god requires oh it's just a mystery of god revealed yeah the mystery of god revealed revelation 10 the mystery of god is revealed amen yes but what is the what is in the mystery of god amen the mystery of god is the resurrection and the rapture amen amen amen oh and it's too often the people have focused focused on doctrine this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine and as i said oh they'll take this message and that message that message amen that the prophet was focusing on but brother all of it was ordained to give us rapturing faith the faith of the resurrection the faith that we're in the end the faith to look up by the grace of god amen as i said about that gentleman that we met in a store there a few days ago amen just to think that he wasn't part of a church he didn't go to church no he used to he did this he did that amen to finally he just moved away from the churches amen but he was still spiritual amen and then when we when we parted amen and then he just turned to walk and walk away with his wife there after they were finished during the during their shopping and he just turned around and he said he raised his hand he said oh he said look up now i said what wonderful i said yes i said amen i said look up what i said so we had a revelation where was he going i pray the grace of god to him amen wherever he is just think oh yeah i trust by the grace of god that we're encouraging those that we meet as a wit if we're we're a witness of what god has done if we're a witness of what god is doing amen are we encouraging family friends neighbors to look up look up we're in the art of the resurrection we're in the eye of the rapture we're getting out of here yeah amen so brother sister if they if they got that revelation what are we to have if he got that revelation what revelation i want you and me to have brother sister we ought to be on our way up and i trust we are amen oh no no no no no brother we're not no i went on our way up yes we are is our faith our faith is getting us caught up into the revelation of what god is doing the resurrection and the rapture and brother the more we're getting caught up the less the less we're we're getting cut out caught into the world and the things of the world oh yeah we're getting further and further away from what's going on in this old world oh yeah and we're getting more and more and more hungry and more thirsty amen to get out to go home amen oh yeah god by by the word god by the revelation god by the holy ghost brother he's created in us amen a hunger and a thirst for eternity a hunger and a thirst for the resurrection a hunger and a thirst for the rapture but i tell you i don't meet many believers that are hungry and thirsting to get out of here there there's more wrong we are thirsting for this for this for the natural things of life but the bride is hungry and thirsty oh to go home oh aren't you home no or we've been we've been brought into contact with home our heavenly home amen but we want to get out of here and into and really home and home is where you come from amen so where'd you come from by the grace of god we come from eternity we're going back to eternity amen we we were sons and daughters of god amen eternal that's right but sin put us down in in time that's right yeah god allowed it why why they call out because god wanted to show you his love what he would do for you amen so that amen so you would respond by loving him amen hallelujah glory oh praise the lord amen amen he loves us we love him amen praise the lord brother oh yeah he's my father oh yeah now we can cry abba father hallelujah amen through the baptism of the holy ghost the anointing of the holy ghost amen we cry father father father amen we've got a revelation of who our father is praise the name of the lord oh lord that's where i come from yes that's where you come from that's where you're going amen you you fell and this is what happened this is what this is what caused the fall but i allowed it so that i could come and show you my love amen that i would do this for you i would do this that for you amen amen knowing that if you are the seed of god if you are a son of god if you're a daughter of god you're going to love him amen oh it's not just appreciate religion oh yeah yeah yeah that's the lord yeah thank you lord oh yes jesus you you did what you did to redeem us back but to them it's not god redeeming his sons and daughters oh yeah we're he's just redeeming the sinners back oh i was born and said so thank you lord i know i got some hope brother i pray god that is we got a greater understanding a greater revelation than all the that he saved me as a sinner and and now now at the end we're going we're going back we're going to go to heaven go to heaven heaven well we're the devil's in heaven i trust we're going beyond just just to say heaven i trust there's a certain place amen where god is we're going to go where our father is oh yeah praise the name of the lord you don't have time to get into it all but i just want to want to share those things with you amen amen challenging your faith do you really believe it do you are you really experiencing redemption as your son and you your the son and daughter being redeemed back amen you say lord i was lost and you found me amen i would lost and you redeemed me and lord look what you did you mean to tell me lord that you experienced this and you suffered this and you suffered that from me to get me back again yeah it'll bring us into a greater and a greater relationship with him to let us know that we are sons and daughters not just sinners saved by grace we're sons and daughters saved by the grace of god amen and most just think that they were sinners and god came down and it's to a religion oh god god saved me oh yeah jesus saved me he saved me he did this but they don't have the revelation of their relationship with jesus they don't have the relationship of the revelation of their relationship with god that oh yeah that they're sons and daughters of god and that here praise the lord we are brothers and sisters in the faith amen oh brother oh we think oh we were in the natural we got brothers and sisters yeah but that's gone that's going away that'll pass away amen but by the holy ghost god brings us into our relationship with one another as brothers and sisters sons and daughters of god god help us god help us brother when you're going to meet sister so and so you go to meet brother so-and-so oh it's not just or this brother's history in the faith it's it's it's our brother and sister in in the purpose of the plan of god in creation amen we're brothers and sisters from eternity amen and brother when when we were when everything come come the way it came in sin amen oh yeah and we ended up this way in that way oh yeah oh yeah well we're not brothers and sisters oh no we you know they're brothers sisters without us but i tell you whether you're black or white we're brothers and sisters amen makes no difference by the grace of god and not only just brothers and sisters just just in this this world no no where we are brothers and sisters in the world to come yeah our relationship goes back to eternity amen is not going back to the natural things of life is going back to the spiritual amen amen by the grace of god thank god amen that we have that respect for one another yeah as the sons and daughters of god praise the lord if you respect god you respect your brothers and sisters in the faith that's right and then the only way you respect god if you you got no more respect for god than you have for your brothers and sisters in the gospel amen that is the absolute truth amen because amen your gods if you're sons and daughters of god you're gods yeah god because god gives birth to gods praise the name of the lord oh brother god help us praise the name of the lord don't take it for granted or just be oh brother to be really appreciate the revelation and i'll tell you it'll humble you god help us glory brother end time evangelism is bringing us into this revelation of who we are where we come from where we're going and how we're going to get there by the grace of god amen turn with me to the book of advocate chapter 2. in the old testament the book of abecute chapter 2. praise the lord amen and in habit chapter 2 and verse 1 it says i will stand upon my watch and set me up on the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie amen though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry amen the purpose and plan of god our redemption turn with me to the book of ezekiel chapter 12. ezekiel chapter 12. and verse 21 ezekiel chapter 12 and verse 21 and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus said the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision amen as it was to israel and israel israel so it is with us the days are at hand and the effect of every vision concerning the gentiles for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering devonation within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass and it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged anymore amen we're at the end amen we're not looking to a future of a thousand years we're not going to look into a future of maybe even a hundred years it's been 55 years since the going of the prophet amen how much longer will it be before it comes to a conclusion for the gentile world amen and knowing and considering what god is doing with israel amen that god is closing down the gentiles amen and moving back to the jews oh yeah he left the jews and come to come to to to get the gentiles to call it of the gentiles of people for his name to provoke israel to jealousy amen and that hour has come and now god is leaving the gentiles to go back to the jews i pray god help us amen make your calling and your election sure amen your calling and your election oh yeah i'm called i'm elected i'm the seed of god i'm the son of god sons and daughters of god but make it sure how do i make it sure may you make it sure by the word make sure you make your calling sure by the word amen that this is god god did this god did this amen that god from right from the beginning to the end praise the lord and praise the lord to know that what i believe and the stand that i'm taking now oh it connects right on down to the where i'm back to the to eternity if i trace it all the way back back back back back it goes on back to in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth amen and we were the sons and daughters of god back there and brother that was that was a mystery one of the mysteries that god was testing job with where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth where were you job amen amen when i did this when i did that amen but job knew he was there amen when god created when god did this when god did that he was he was back there amen in in well not in this fleshly body for sure amen but we're going back by grace of god so brother it's way all that god has done he goes right on back to eternity and from eternity comes right on that oh thank god i pray grace that we can we can trace our experience right on back to eternity amen or we can go back to eternity and see what god has done all down through the angels all down through this through the centuries and see what god has done oh yeah praise the lord we're not over here we're not over there no no what god god did this did this oh i just line right up with the word i line right up with the plan and purpose of god lining right up with the will of god amen brother we know that it's the devil that makes the confusion amen because again this is god amen and this is as it were the alpha and the omega but it was the enemy that come when god when god still had a word here had a word there had an idea had a thought amen no leave it the way god makes it leave it the way that god does it leave it the way that god reveals it amen don't and don't let the enemy come into your mind and put this thought in it that's all in another song brother leave it leave it with the word amen because it's it's god said this god said this god said this and the enemy comes down as he did in the garden of eden but and goes off and it had it right on down through even for the jews and now especially down for the gentiles down through those seven church ages that the enemy has come in and say yeah yeah as god said but and they go off to that church age and it goes on down again yeah god said but amen it goes off to another church age yeah because these are the church ages these are the messengers and basically the message and so on of what god god is revealing but the enemy wants to add to it or take from it and brother what he'll do he'll all he'll do he'll add maybe a word just one word change a little here add a little there amen nothing big about it and of course when you when you get off when you get off the enemy when and the more the more that he goes out you know or you can he can lead you off that way and he only only changed maybe a word or two here and there and so on but then he gets out there and he oh oh oh oh and he'll change a lot of words and that's why we got these uh all what they call them out there when it comes to religion all the different the groups and and they believe this they believe that all mine but they got so much added to it it's absolutely amazing you know so we pray the grace of god that we stay with the word god brings us back in line say with the word stay with the word amen where we come from that's what we're going back by grace amen so brothers keep keep in line with the word of god amen again the scripture said yeah verse 18 it said though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast and though noah daniel and job were in it as i lived saith the lord god they should deliver neither son or daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness for for us it's not our righteousness and it is because imputed to us and according to our faith it is the righteousness of jesus amen imputed to us for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sword judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome pestil are beasts and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters thank god amen he said you won't bring them but i will thank god and he said they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see there oh ezekiel 12 i was reading ezekiel 14. maybe the lord led me to read it for somebody here or somebody online amen and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought unto jerus upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye shall see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god amen god has got a reason to do what he what he does amen again the word of the lord came on verse 26 of ezekiel 12. he said in verse 25 i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass and it shall no more prolong for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god and again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man be o they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesied of the times that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged anymore but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god amen brother god just keeps on going and brother down the end amen it's finished it is finished i'll just share with you some notes or thoughts amen already been an hour over an hour maybe but i think sufficient has been said in the way of a foundation to lead us into what the prophet said in his message on end-time evangelism brother we think sometimes it's all let's let's send the preachers out to to the to this country that country there there there see if we can find the last predestinated seed no that's not the end time evangelism for the bride as i quoted i believe during the last message the last sermon that the power of god did say he said now he said they're going to take the gospel of jesus and bait the basic gospel of jesus and go to the whole world but he said this message is for the bride only amen it is for the elect only amen because many are called but few are chosen so brother we yes we pray and we commit all the other ministries in into the hands of god and praying the grace of god for for this for this country and that country yes but our focus is mainly right now on the bride it is on the resurrection it is on the rapture by the grace of almighty god amen so brother when it comes to the ministry to the bride the the message ministry this this ought to be the emphasis of the ministry the resurrection and the rapture considering lord brother sister the hour that we're living considering what god has done considering what god is doing what are we to be preaching for the bride resurrection rapture amen we ought to be focusing on the resurrection and the rapture because that's what well that's what god's waiting on now that's what the the elect of god that are going on amen and they're waiting on us to come to that faith brother lazarus was waiting on jesus to call it back and he came back praise the lord so now he's waiting on us christ in you christ in in the bride amen for the resurrection and the rapture amen by the grace of god because the power of god was one time and i think it was only one time that he had that experience that that he was he was in his in basically lying in his bed and he and he just he was looking that way and oh then all of a sudden he broke into eternity the vision broke and he began to see this and see this and see that and he found himself as it were going right into eternity but yet he looked back and saw him so he could see his own his physical body on the bed oh yeah but yet he turned around oh who are these oh my and he was looking at this this group of people that group of people and some were somewhere from other other church ages and they were fellowshipping with one another those that were from the different ages and then it's then he looked and he saw those over there and those over there and they were from the the age in which he was living the age in which you and i are living and they were fellowshipping one another and the angel did say to brother branham they said oh do you see that woman there yes always said do you and she only looked to she only looked to be maybe in her 20 22 two years old something like that and uh he said do you know he said no he's i don't know her oh he said she was 95 years old we said when you let her to the lord he said what yes she was 95. of course and again brother when we when we go out of time and into eternity you're not going to find no old people when it comes to when i say old people you're going to find someone oh they're gray hair and oh my they're all old with wrinkles and everything no no no because we're going to be young the bible tells us no no no if enough days nor an old person that haven't fulfilled their days no no not by any means and like if if when when if the lord takes takes the one of these young people home and into eternity oh when they get into eternity they're into it they're into a body around maybe 20 years old oh yeah and if your great-grandma your grandpa or whatever the old people and you folks here with your gray hair and so on and you're right here when you get there oh you oh you won't have gray hair no gray hair there no white hair you're going to be young around 20 years old 21 years old again there not be an infant that hasn't fulfilled his days nor an old man that hasn't fulfilled his days no hand for the day he's not an old man that doesn't fulfill his days no no not there no no the old see the old will be young forever by the grace of god transformed in a moment of time and immortal will stand in his likeness the sun and the stars to shine by the grace of god brother end time evangelism is pointing us to eternity end time evangelism is poignant to the resurrection pontius 2 the rapture please i pray in the name of jesus let's not ignore what god has done what god is doing amen to to and what is god doing all the way he did this he did that with the opening of the word the mystery of god yes but what was why why did he do it it was to give us faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen what he did under the other ages it was to give them the faith for like for the different messages that that god was revealing through the messengers and luther and his and his message concerning justification all you have to give them that faith and on down to sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and brother that was that was faith god gave the pentecostals that faith to believe it to receive it amen and now he's giving us the faith to believe for the resurrection and the rapture but now listen don't forget god's expecting you to have this experience too oh yeah add to your faith yeah oh yeah have you added to your faith not not different doctrines and theologies man-made ideas no no idea of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and oh by the way and that's not filial that's agape divine love there's too much emphasis on filio human love amen but brother you got a head it's crowd this is the crown it is the crown of divine love amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so brother i pressed by the grace of god that we're going forth and and brother we've added to our faith virtue knowledge temperance patience and brother it's all holy ghost attributes holy ghost attributes so do you have holy ghost faith do you have holy ghost virtue oh brother do you have holy ghost knowledge amen do you have holy ghost temperance and patience how many of us got patience it's like the brother said oh he said he said i got i got lots of patience but he said i don't use it amen that's right yeah and i i won't say who said that but they may be online amen so brother i trust if we got it we'll use it oh yeah amen so brother it's all holy ghost attributes oh my god have mercy on us oh yes so that we don't think oh i got patience i'll i'll put up with this and put up with that you don't put up with nothing you just go on it's not it's not a matter of putting up with it you live with it by the grace of god oh yeah so again it's people don't realize that this is only ghost virtues it's not what what human virtues not by any means so again we start out with holy ghost faith oh my this is amazing amen then we add holy ghost virtue and it's holy ghost knowledge holy ghost temperance and holy ghost patience that'll try you definitely amen brother you gotta i'll tell you if there's anyone you've got to have patience with is god amen you've got to have patience with god amen you want him that patience with you yeah most definitely amen praise the lord hallelujah and brother the holy ghost is there to keep reminding you be still and know that i have god amen and and again there's a holy ghost godliness attributes of your character the life that you live it is holy ghost godliness it's just your nature amen and it's not you it's christ that liveth in you again and it's a holy ghost attribute of brotherly kindness oh my oh my oh my and i tell you you lay down your lives for one another you do grace of god so do we have that holy ghost brotherly kindness amen that we're there to die for one another we're there to lay down our lives one another we're there oh that will we'll prefer that that brother over ourselves it's like brother ben was talking about and uh i talked about some of the brothers there years ago and he said what if you were in a job and he said that this position came up and he said and there was two of you he said could could it to take that position it would be a higher position you get more pay and so on now he said if you're a christian he said you'll step back and let the other fella take it you have that attitude you have that holy ghost spirit that you would prefer the other fella no no i'll let i'll let him take it that's all right god bless you yeah if you've got the holy ghost you have that attitude if you've got the holy ghost you have that spirit or you you do it jesus would do it amen so brother i pray that we have that brotherly kindness that you prefer your brother or your sister more than you prefer yourself god bless them amen by the grace of god and brother if you've got it all amen and god recognizes it as the holy ghost attributes in you and then brother the crown the crowning is divine love amen the baptism of the holy ghost is the baptism of divine law amen you love god you love one another and you do it definitely love his word by grace amen i don't think i'm going to get get into all these notes for sure it's a few pages i have here so we'll see what the lord will do amen so brother again let me emphasize end time evangelism amen is bringing the bride into these into these attributes amen it's it's it's explaining to the explaining to the bride showing the bride what god requires of her amen so brother you got to make your calling election sure how you make it sure well thank god i got holy ghost faith make us sure now so oh lord oh yes lord i thank you for all these qualities lord it's not me it's jesus living in me and lord so help me to die more and more every day and christ had more and more control over me amen by the grace of god this this is the only way to make your calling an election sure amen that e is in control you start with your faith and then add to your faith by the grace of god amen let me just share a couple of thoughts here and then we'll bring it to a conclusion and i'd love to finish it another time and lord willing i was planning on letting our brother jonathan minister a couple of services and hopefully our brother mark here and myself and sister betty were planning on going to central and western newfoundland to visit the saints and maybe the lord willing may be able to share with them the communion and foot washing and i also want to eventually to serve community washington here because it's been a while since we had it especially since colby 19. so the grace of god be with us the lord knows our hearts that we want to do it so be in prayer amen and so and also uh it will be maybe the last week of uh this month that we'll be maybe trying to maybe take the journey to visit the saints and like i said they will be going to carmenville for sure and to to visit our brother stride as well and sister linda to visit our brother the ellsworth's by the grace of god and of course also others that our brother jonathan and brother joseph did visit we'll ministers to some of them as well and serve communion for washington so be in prayer for us because it's been it's been a long time and that since we've been there this covet issue of course has delayed a lot of things so grace to us as as we plan to travel by grace so let me say that sufficient has been said to help us distinguish between beginning evangelism middle of the day evangelism and end time evangelism it has progressed from prophets into the god prophet for the redemption of our souls and since the day of pentecost it has progressed from god the god prophet into the church age messengers forming up into the body of the logos word bride for the redemption of our bodies brother beginning back in the first age and even our lord jesus christ the redemption of our souls amen and on down through the last age the revelation of our lord jesus christ for the redemption of our bodies amen amen we've been changed inward inside now god's going to change us outside amen and also bring forth others into the resurrection of glorified bodies so god help us brother to understand that end time evangelism has to do with what god is doing in the end time amen by the grace of god getting the bride ready for the resurrection getting the bride ready for the rapture amen so be in prayer by the grace of god and oh yeah end time evangelism in the message he said he said the evening time evangelism will be the mark of malachi 4 and it is to restore the faith of the people back to the faith of the fathers amen yes sir it is back to the building stones amen and he said what good is stones if you haven't got a true stone mason with a good sharp tool to shape the stone he should shape him into the fitting place in the house of god just wanted to ask you what's good the decisions what what's what's the good place in the house of god he said just wanted to ask you what's good the decisions what's good you putting your name on the book what's good is come to join the church if the stonemason isn't there to shape you he said that'll shape that'll make them quit and he said and cut them and make them over that's end-time evangelism he said taking the stones and shaping them amen according to the will of god for the hour that you're living so brother how many are willing to let god shape you amen amen and of course when it comes to end time evangelism god's got to use the end time ministry amen to do it so the entire ministry is there to shape to shape you amen shape you the way that god wants you so grace to us i pray amen god bless you please in the name of jesus don't don't let the message become a just a form of godliness i pray grace that that the message is absolutely god to you oh yes absolutely it is god revealing himself it is god dealing with you amen what for shaping you what cut well what's he looking for shaping yeah so that your bride amen and that you're you're you're a bride with rapturing faith resurrection faith so we're focusing on the resurrection and the rapture end time evangelism is to keep our thoughts on the resurrection on the rapture keep our thoughts on what god is doing amen not what he's done but on what he's doing and brother takes the grace of god

brother mark with his other ministry brethren around the world that we're going to focus on true end time evangelism amen let's get the bride into the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture
