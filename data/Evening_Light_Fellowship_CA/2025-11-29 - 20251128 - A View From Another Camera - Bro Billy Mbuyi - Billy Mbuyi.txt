Good to see each one that could make it. Amen. You can take your seats just for a moment. I did want to give a small testimony tonight. Not to hold back the preacher at all, but uh as you know, Jensen had quite a fall on Sunday, and I just wanted to thank the Lord for all that he's done to get him through sitting here in the pew tonight. And you know, we we haven't had the best of experiences with the Newfoundland Medical System. But I told my wife, I said, "We're going to trust God. We're going to trust God." And so I went to my doctor that had said we can bring them in anytime. time and he refused to take him. But she had gone to a a massage therapist that same day on the Monday. It was her birthday. It was already booked and she'd have lost it if she didn't do it. And so she went and the lady there said, "If you call this clinic, they'll get get you in." So she called them in. They did a phone consult. They said, "Get him in right away. We'll fit you in tomorrow." So he went in for there and they were able to do a quick review of him. They've set up blood work and EKG and all these different tests that they want to do. They're going to hopefully refer him to a pediatrician. And then they said that they would take the whole family in as well for a family doctor as well. So, we're thankful for that. Amen. Sometimes you think that it's just the devil, but sometimes God's providing in the way of a battle. Amen. So, we're thankful for that. And uh they had said he had an abscess, but then they went to the the the surgeon. He said, "I don't think it's an abscess." And uh the dentist called that day. She said, "I talked to a panel and they don't think it's an abscess. We're just going to leave it as well, so he doesn't have to have surgery on the tooth to pull that out." So, we're just trusting again that the Lord's in it. He doesn't have to have surgery on his jaw, they said, in four to six weeks, but it should fuse back together and be completely normal. So, we're thankful for that. He does get to eat sandwiches during church just to make sure that his blood sugar stays up and make sure he's got energy throughout the service. Um, but we don't know that that that has anything to do with it. But we're thankful, amen, that he's here and he's running around and and he's doing his old he's being his old self. So, we're very thankful for that. Amen. We're thankful to have a visiting minister finally get through the barrage of devil's gunfire. Amen. We've got brother William Puy from Dallas Fort Worth and he's uh assisting Brother David McGee, my old pastor there. Been there for many, many years now and uh just talking to him and I had to get some information to book his tickets and we're two weeks apart in our birthday. Um so we're almost the exact same age. We're both engineers. He's electrical. I'm mechanical. We both have four kids, one girl, three boys. So, we are brothers from another mother, it would seem. But, um, we're thankful to have him here. Thankfully, he took his time. He's been traveling a lot and he left his Thanksgiving to come and give us a thanksgiving up here. So, we certainly want to say God bless you, Brother Billy, for coming up. Amen. We're in for a real treat. I was I was coming in. I hope it's okay for me to say this, Brother Billy. It doesn't matter if I'm not, but I hope it's okay. I said, 'How you feeling? He said, a little bit nervous. I said, ' Don't be nervous.' I said, everybody's just like me.' I said, "We're we're easygoing. We're happy to be here. We want to be in church." I said, "So, just come in the attitude that you are, the person that you are, and everything else will be okay." So, we're just trusting, Amen. that the spirit will speak through him tonight. Amen. Let's just stand if we would. We're going to sing that song, I worship you, Almighty God. There's none like you. As we hand the pulpit over to him, I've reminded him there's no there's no uh clocks in the church. We're just going to go until the spirit's done. Amen. and just trust that we can enter in that he can get himself out of the way. Pull. You got a need, you pray. Pray like you've never prayed before. Said, "Lord, come my way. Lord, talk to me. Show me you know my name. Show me you know I show me that you know I'm here." And just let him speak to you and watch the Holy Spirit just come down and touch your need and and speak to you tonight. Amen. We're going to sing this as brother Billy comes. Amen. I worship you almighty God [music] for there is none like you. I worship you oh [singing] prince [music] of peace. That [singing] is what I long to do. I give you [singing and music] praise for you are my [singing] rightuousness. [music] I worship [music] you almighty [singing] God. There is none like you. [singing] [music] I worship you. [music] [singing] [music] Oh, and I worship [singing] you all of &gt;&gt; Oh, that [music] is what I [singing] give you praise [music] &gt;&gt; for you are [singing] my rightous &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I worship you [music] mighty God. There is none like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight? Why don't we just bow our heads and go to him in prayer? Our gracious father, Father, as your children, we long to worship you, Lord. And we long to sit at your feet and drink a cup and Lord to just have fellowship and have you talk to us, Lord. And [music] Father, the I would say from my own heart. And we desire, Lord, that fellowship that existed in the beginning where you would come down in the cool of the evening and and just fellowship with your children and and Adam [music] will talk to you and Eve and you would talk to them back and and Father, you would put them to sleep, oh God. And Father, we desire that closeness today, Lord. And we gather here, Lord, and gather from [music] different places and brought different needs. And but Father, we have one God who's overall and who knows all our needs. And Lord, we sang songs and we worship you. And now, Father, it's the time for the word. And we invite you, Lord, that you may just come and [music] Father, take this what would be spoken, oh God, and make it food for our souls, Lord. And Father, a man can put lines together. He could put quotes together, but it really takes you to minister to our hearts, Lord. And what we desire is the ministering of the spirit in this hour, Lord. Father, we thank you for the opportunity to be gathered here, Lord. We know that you made it possible that this moment could come. You even knew about it before time. Now what we ask that the purpose for which this moment was made may you just come among us oh God and speak to each individual Father from the children to the oldest and that there may be not a need here that you didn't talk about or that they didn't minister to Lord Father what good would it be for us to just come here and return back the same but Father what we desire is the change of heart and change of attitude and Father that we can go back and say that surely our heartburn within us [music] as he talked to us along the way. We commit the service into you, Father. These meetings will take place [music] Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Lord God, that somebody may be touched this weekend that they may say, "My life has changed, oh God, because you said that one soul is worth a 10,000 world, oh God, that you will come and do it according to your word. We commit it to you and we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray." Amen. Amen. and God bless you. We're certainly happy to be gathering in the house of God. Amen. You would just be seated for a moment before we read our scriptures. Uh we just want to bring greetings uh from home and from our church, Christian Life Tabernacle. As brother Jonathan said, we bring greetings uh from our pastor, brother David McGary. Uh we've known brother Jonathan for quite some time. We're actually I think it's over 20 something years, I believe. and and I hadn't heard from him for a long while and and I got the text message. I was actually at the airport uh uh traveling to London for work and um and I looked and I'm like I think I know and and and then all of the sudden I I made a phone call, we talked and it was just you know we picked it up right where we left it from. So certainly uh happy that uh we've given the opportunity to come here. certainly thankful and certainly appreciate the opportunity. We don't take it lightly when we have to stand before the elect of God and speak to them. Amen. So, we bring greetings from our pastor, brother David, and and then there are those from home that knew who you were and brother Mike, Sister Lee, and David Jr. and others. They certainly wanted me to uh bring the greetings and and and my family to all of you. Amen. So, let's stand and just take our Bibles and uh we're going to get right into it and uh we'll see where the Lord takes us today. Amen. Let's open our Bibles in Luke chapter 5. Let's start from verse one. said to me, "It came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake Guinness and saw the two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen were gone out of them were washing their nets." And he entered into one of the ships which were Simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little out to the land uh from the land. And he sat down and taught people out of the ship. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, "Launch out into the deep and let down your net for the drought." And Samuel answered and said unto him, "Master, we have toiled all night and have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, we will cast down the net." Let's just bow our heads. Gracious father, your word is life to us. We come at this moment, Lord, and where we have opened our Bibles and read. The scripture says, even your prophet will say that any man can read the Bible. Any man can read of it, but it takes you and the Holy Spirit to give the very revelation of it. We ask that you would take it, Father, and you would expand the word to our hearts, Lord, that it will be you speaking and not me, Lord. We commit it to you and ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. Amen. I I I just want to say on the outset as believers I believe that the word means a lot to us. Uh the word brings faith to our hearts and the word uh is is to the sons and the daughters of God. They love the word of God. But when say that the Holy Spirit feeds on the word when we hear the word there is something within within us. We are build to actually desire to hear from the word of God. The word of God is life and it's our bloodline. It's our heartbeat. And and without the word there's no life. But whenam will say uh even Jesus will preach and they will say that that the man will uh live not of bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God. You will find out that just the same as this natural body will need water. We'll need food and we'll need to be taken care of. Our spiritual self will need the word of God in order for us to grow. Without the word, there's no life. We need the word and it's by the word of God that we live. In fact, I'll say even everything we see around us, the trees and the sun and the moon is the word of God come to be manifested. So without the word, there's no life. the word barren will say and and I just want to put a summary here because I couldn't really read all the quotes so I'll give you this oneliners you can write down and then go go go check them if you would like to but when I will say that the word is god himself giving himself to the believer so when we when we and I the reason why this is important because we live in the time where we have so many theologian and the word is become when we say the word. Often time there's a confusion because there are those that look at the Bible which is the record of the word and and not understanding that there's actually this is the word of God. In other words, somebody spoke it and this is the record of it. The the the word the scripture will say in the beginning was was was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. So God the first form that he took after he was the spirit that cover all time and space and he hover over the water the over the the water. The scripture says that the form that he took was the word the logos and that was the creative power of God. Everything that existed came from the logos. So when we hear the word of God, let's not look at the letter itself, but understand that there's the creative force that's actually coming out of it. When you receive the word of God, you are receiving the creative power of God that can actually change you, that can change your life and bring you into the condition that God desires for you to be. So but but when it says the word is God himself giving himself to the believer. When you receive the word of God, it's God that you are receiving. It's not man's idea. But says heaven and earth will pass away and but the word will never pass away. Why? Because the the the heaven was created and earth is all time and space. But the word is the only thing that's eternal. The word is the believer's absolute. So when when you encounter something in your life, when you're going through a situation, when you come to the word of God, when the word speaks about your condition, the word to the believer is the absolute. The symptoms don't matter. Whatever the doctor says don't matter. Whatever is happening at that time, once you already heard the word of God, the rest doesn't matter. you might as well go home and rejoice. Why? Because if God spoke, the scripture says God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; His word is the truth. His word is the absolute. And let me say this before I move on. The word is the only thing that would provide permanent change. &gt;&gt; All the other changes are temporal. You know, you look at politics today, one will come, oh, we got to do this to be better. the one the another will come and reverse whatever it it's. It's so amazing. You know, we live in a country back home, you know, laws that were made years ago and that you think this can never be changed again, but you have a certain group of people in power, they come and they reverse all of it. Things that were put in place to protect the people, to do things and one party will come and reverse everything. So there's nothing permanent on the face of the earth. Even the change that you get on earth is only temporal. The only permanent change in your life will come from the word. &gt;&gt; Once you once you've been healed, you've been healed forever. Once you've been changed, you've been changed forever. It's not a temporal change. Why? Because God is the real God and is the only one that can provide true change. So the word is the seed of all seed. The prophet will speak in uh the spoken word is the original life. So when you receive the seed of God, it will grow and produce the fruits of what God intended for you to produce. The word say it will not go void until it returns that which he was spoken for. If you want results, take the word of God. If you want true change in your life, take the word of God. Take whatever the word is saying. Don't take what men men you know they they have 10 steps program two-step program 20step program and after you finish the program there's another program that you got to go through but once you take the word of God butam says you find an example of what God did in the Bible because if God has ever done one thing one way is obligated to do it the same every time. If if you stood and and you were uh sick and you were afflicted and you were in a certain condition and you needed the Holy Ghost, you needed healing, you needed whatever, you needed whatever you needed from God. And you can find an example in the Bible, you might as well stand there and jump and be happy and know that you've stood up on your absolute because if God has ever done one thing one way, he cannot change. But whenam says God is not respector of people. God is respector of his own word. Once he's spoken, he cannot change it. The word is the only thing that will bring the change that we need. He says, "My word is spirit and life." When you receive it, you've received the spirit and the life of God. So, as we look at the scripture we just read, um perhaps I will uh pick a a very strange title and I I I pray you you just follow me for a little bit and and you will see where this came from. Um and and and I want to call it a view from another camera. A view from it from another camera. and and butam I can't I can't I will let you know what message I got this from as we go along. I I can't see it right now. uh will use the story and will say um it must have been uh like a Monday, you know, and and Jesus uh here it was a young preacher uh walking towards the shores of Galilee and walking towards the shore there where people went to market and work and different things. And he was just a young preacher and and he was concerned about the souls of men and he will go out and and and no doubt the prophet will say he stayed away from rich neighborhood because they were not interested and there was nothing in them to pull. There was nothing in them that actually they feel like they had all that they had need of and they had desire for nothing. Kind of like the time we live in. They are filled with good and they have the money and they feel they don't need the gospel. So he will go and find where the fishermans were, the peasants and the people that you would consider low class and and those people that didn't have much and there were people that were in need. And and I want to say this, the word of God always comes to those that are in need. that that's why we we we when we come to church and when we in this life, we know that there's only one that can meet our need and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. We we don't show up as a know-it-all or or as people that have gotten all together. We know that as long as we are here, we need his grace. We need his mercy. We need we need him to lead us, to guide us. We need him to see. Without him, we can't see. We live in the dark generation, my brother, my sister. It's constantly getting darker and darker. It's funny. You can look and say, you know, 10 years we thought it was bad, but you look at 10 years today, it's worse than it ever was. And we have a promise that it's never going to get better. It's going to get worse and worse as we move along. So he would come and he would uh uh come to those as the scripture will say the gospel came to those that were hungry and those that were poor h uh but but poor the poor of this world but rich in faith and he will reveal himself to those that are actually looking for him. Those that desire him, those that have needs and and they know that he's the only one that can meet the need. And and Jesus will always find those. And he had a way to find those lost seed of Abraham. And because remember he said that I came for the lost seed of Abraham. He somehow just knew where to meet them. He just he just no matter what was going on, he knew exactly where to meet them. Let me say this. The word knows where to meet you. &gt;&gt; Where wherever you are. You may say, "Well, I I I live in a remote place. You know, I live in a place where not too many." The word knows where to meet you. He he he he he knows uh every elect where they are. He knows the condition and and and and God has not lost the control. He knows everything and and he knows exactly what to meet and what to do for your need today. It says he came and he came unto he said in the scripture come unto me that are levy laden and I shall give you rest. So as he will show up the scripture will say he will start preaching and talking and and and somehow when he opened his mouth and he begins to preach the scripture will say precious words came out of his mouth. Precious word was flowing out of him. The prophet said one place he said he never had wasted words. &gt;&gt; Everything he spoke he spoke for a purpose. Paul was one such that he just knew exactly no matter what you were going through, he knew the exact phrasing and and how to say it so it will touch the heart. Let me say this. The word didn't come for the unbeliever. The word came to the believer because he said in his word that my sheep hears my voice and other they will not follow. The reason why it's touching your heart tonight is because he knew how to speak to you this tonight. and and and when they're heard they will begin something within their heart begin to be attracted to him and they would the word the scripture will say they press unto him so they can hear more of what he was talking about. It's funny today we live in a time where we have more access to the message than we've ever had. We have more access to the word of God than we've ever had. But yet people are not they are not attracted to it anymore. We live in the time where people are asking where's the sign of his coming? They they do all kinds of things and they go about their own lives and not paying any attention to what the word is calling them to. But there are those that will hear the voice and and just like they heard the voice in that time, there are those that are hearing his voice of Malachite for tonight and they are being attracted to it. Why? because they are build with something in their hearts to be attracted to that. And brother will say this now this is in the message at thy word preaching July 8 1953 he says now let's change the camera just a moment in our minds look sitting up there on this stump or this old chunk along the side of the seashore I see Peter sitting up there James and sons of Zebedee sitting up there and they had fish all night. Discouraged. Any of you fishermanmen knows what it is to fish all night and don't catch nothing. It's really discouraging. Now I want you to think. Now let me if I could just paint you the scenery. This was their business. This is how they made the money. This is how they fed their families. This is how they got money to build the boats. and and no doubt that perhaps they had taken a loan to build the boats and and and and w with a mind that if when they catch fish and sell the fish, they'll be able to get some money so they can pay for the loans that they'll be able to take care of their families. But here they are stuck in a place where they went and fished all night, tried everything that they know and didn't come up with anything. This is the condition that they were in. And they will say, "So they washed off their net and they hang them dry." And there they are sitting on the stump. And some of them say, "Well, that comes there comes that guy, that preacher. Let's see what he's got to say." And I see this old apostle and and and and this chunk and sit down. And and after a while, he began to listen. There's something a little different about that fellow. He moved this chunk and just a little clo a little bit closer. And after a while, he's standing right up against him. There is something about him that draws men to him. Let me tell you this. It don't matter what's going to when he opens his mouth to speak, something will be drawn. And now, if I could just paint a picture for you. Yeah, they are. They have done all of this and they have fish all night and they didn't catch anything. But that didn't stop them from going and hearing the word of God. That didn't stop them from saying, "Well, you know what? We'll go try again. We'll go." When they heard this young man preaching, something within their heart began to be attracted to the word. They left what they were doing, they pushed in and and they got even closer for them to hear the word of God. And and the said, "But regardless of what was going on, it never stopped them from coming. They never it never stopped them from coming to hear this rabbi." Let me say this. Don't let the condition that you find yourself. It don't You don't come to church just when you feel well. You don't come to church just when you feel like you up. I don't care what condition you are in. You come to hear the word of God. The Lord will speak to you. &gt;&gt; He knows your condition. Let me say this. What happened to you back there or what happened to you before you come to church? It's not unknown to him. He knows exactly. And he has something to answer to the need that you have. He came and he borrowed a boat and and he would borrow a boat and after that he has done preaching and he came and he asked Peter he said now take your boat and I want you to launch out. Now he now that he had left speaking and said unto Simon Peter it says launch into the deep and let the net for a drought. And Simon Peter answering the MSM, "Master, we have toiled all night and have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, I will cast down the net." My brother, my sister, let me just paint it just for you. Peter was a professional fisherman. Peter from his youth, as you read the story, he fished. That's what he knew. He knew nothing better than fishing. They grew up by the seashore. They they as the young people they went and they fished. That's what they did for their whole life. And the area they will talk about how they knew techniques about fishing and how they knew uh uh when the mood is at the certain place and the certain sides and everything how the what way the fish will be and everything. But all of that they knew all of that information that were with them. They went and fished. They didn't catch anything. But here comes this young master and tell him go and cast down thy net again and you will see. So Peter as a fisherman he was trying to do Jesus is calling him at this moment to do something that was contrary to his own mind. Something that was contrary to his training. Something that was contrary to every senses of his body. every understanding that he had until then. But here he is now. He's no longer doing it because he understood what he was doing, but he's doing it because he had received a commandment to do the word of God. And by doing the commandment of God, they caught more fish than they could handle. &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? So it's not about our understanding of what God is asking us, but it's our faith in the what has been told to us. Because let me say this, if the word of God answer to the needs in the past, the word of God is here to answer to the needs of the people. If the word of God produced what people were looking for in the past, the word of God is here to do the same. And yes, but when I'm saying he said, but he said, "Lord, we've told all night and we have nothing. But nevertheless, at thy word, I'm going to let down the net." Butam says this, "There you are. There's the secret taking God at his word." And listen to this. It says, "If there's no fish there, God is able to put fish there." So he did that the same that he went through that water all night long and caught he says you but look when God said put it down there and that's when they caught fish. So if God said throw down your net even if there was nothing there by taking the action of what the word is asking to do. Remember we said the word has creative power by doing what the word said the word will create the result. &gt;&gt; Neverthe what was the difference? the same people, the same boats, the same hands, the same nets, the same water. What was the difference? The first time when they did it, they did it on their own intelligence. They did it on their own ability. But the second time when they came do it, what was the difference? One was without the word. The second was with the word. Let me say this. If we need solution for our lives, all we need to do is to include the word of God. Well, we'll get word results. When you include God, you get God results. When you do by your own intelligence, you get your own intelligence result. God wants us to take him at his word. God wants us to walk by his word. When you take God as his word, my brother, my sister, you are transferring the responsibility from you to God. You are no longer responsible for the outcome. The responsibility is upon God himself. When you take God at his word, you say, "I give up. I tried and I failed. I can't do this anymore." Lord, if you don't come, I'm done. My brother, my sister, the scripture says that an entrance will be ministering to you. When you take God at his word, you are opening a door for the supernatural to happen. &gt;&gt; It's God wanting to walk in human flesh again. It's God wanting to make himself manifest. And the only way he can make himself supernatural manifested in your life is by you taking him at his word. But say, well, maybe tonight you might you might have seen through all you you might have been seen by through all the doctor's office in the country. Maybe you you you maybe you have been uh you have been in healing meetings and anointed meetings many times. But tonight at thy word here I come. That's the way it is. At thy word I'm going to let down the net cuz you told me if I would ask anything in your name you will do it. And I believe that's the truth. And I'm letting down the net right now at your commandment. Not at what I feel, not at what I think, but when God speaks, when his word is being presented, you walk right into it so it will manifest. But Bam says, don't be afraid. Ask a whole lot. You have not because you ask not. You ask not because you believe not. That's right. He says, "Ask and it shall and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open." That's God's word. Now you will let down. You will let down for the drought. I see this old running big scene out the water and getting ready. And many have began to pull the net and made couple of pools. And then it says when they made couple of pools, there was nothing. And after a while they began to tug. It says it begin to take hold. It says just let it down one time and try. The little effort you might not feel much. The second the little effort you might not feel much. May go several efforts but after a while you feel a tug. Something got hold. Something on the other side of the line will take hold. &gt;&gt; You may say, "Well, I I I got prayed for. I didn't feel anything." He says, "Well, maybe you may put one effort. It may not do much, but if it's the word of God, keep putting an effort to it. If the word says to do it, you keep doing it. You keep doing it." Because why? The the challenge that we run into is we want control over the whole situation. I want to know how it starts. I want to know the middle. I want to know every step. I want to know how it's going to end. My brother, my sister, our part is not to know the whole process. Our part is to believe. Our part is to preach the word. Our part is to obey what he says. His part is to bring the manifestation of what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; He will bring the manifestation. And God has never failed. If he says he will do one thing in his word, he will do it. Why? Because we believe it with all our hearts. He says, "Let's not be afraid. Cast down your net. Whatever you have need of, I want to say this. And and God wants us as his children to trust in him. Whatever you have need of. I I find it so amazing. And and and I've taught this and many times in the world we the the the requirement is for you to be able to provide for yourself. You have to be able to get a job and do this and do that and and and that's what you call maturity. That's what you call, you know, a man who can take care of his family and all of that. But when we come to God, the requirement is to do nothing except what he wants you to do is to completely be surrendered to him. &gt;&gt; Not your effort, not your ability, not what you know, not what any He wants you to be like a baby. everything you need. Father, if you don't come, I can't do anything. Father, for my bread today, I need you, Lord. Father, for my healing, I need you, Lord. Father, for whatever I have need of, I need you to provide for me. He wants you to 100% be surrendered and completely reliant on him. So, I want to ask you today, what's in your camera? When you you turn to your own view, you see disappointment. You see, well, I've tried this and and I can't seem to overcome this and and this seems to trip me all the time. And I seem to try this and I can't get this right. And I seem to try to live a Christian life, but today I fail, tomorrow I fail. I can't seem to just keep it straight. And I see other people rejoicing and and being Christian and all of it. I seem to just never able to make it. Let me say this. take your camera off of yourself. Turn your camera off to him. &gt;&gt; The the the one camera was the bill that they had to pay and all of this, but the other camera was the word that was given to them for him to look at them and say, "I I want you to go back and to cast down the net." And they can look at himself and say, "From my camera view, we've done all this all night and we have caught nothing." and him looking at them and saying, "I know, but I want you to now move and do it according to my camera. In your camera, there's disappointment. There's trouble. But God is developing a picture. My brother, my sister, let me say this. The things that come upon us, God knows all about it. The challenges that we face, God knows all about it. and he's mindful of all of that. He he he looked at Job and in the situation I was in. It's so amazing because it looks like when ju when when when the enemy came before God and talked to God about Job, Job was never part of the conversation. But I want you to notice when God even when he gave his his instruction, he told the devil, I want you to touch him, but you can never touch his life. So let me say this. The the devil whatever attacks he brings at you is limited by God himself. He cannot go past whatever limit God has put is obligated to stay within the confounds of what he wants to happen. The devil is not control. God is in control. The devil only does the beating for God. But says that God will harness trouble and put bits in his mouth and to do what? To achieve the goal that God wants achieved. When it's all said and done, the prophet will say, "No matter how simple the gospel is, if Christ is in it, it will do the draw. It will draw the people." It's the greatest magnet as we talked this afternoon in the world that the that the world has ever seen. It will draw all men unto me. He says then when the crowd got greater and and he says sees him around there and I believe he knew the ship was there. So he stepped into the boat and he said Peter trust out just a little bit. He says I was I he says I want to preach for a while and a while he stood there and he began to preach and to the people when after he preached through he preached and he he borrow the boats of Simon he says listen to this he never borrow nothing less he pays for it never borrows something less he pays for it wants to borrow your flesh tonight he wants to borrow your mouth. He wants to borrow your eyes. He wants to borrow you so he can use you. He wants to borrow all of us. Why? He what? He He never borrows something less he can pay for it. And he said, "Simon, I want you to thrust up into the deep." He says, "Oh, I like to speak that on on for a while. I like to speak on that for a while. Launch out. What's the trouble with people faith tonight? We are afraid to turn it loose. There's many of you that's got faith, but you are afraid to let it loose. Your faith without works is death. Just as the body without the spirit is dead. If you got faith, show me your faith by your works. Let me say this, my brother, my sister. God wants us to act by the faith he's given us. God gave us faith so we can act upon it. The faith is not given so you can say, "Well, I'll wait until I see the result." No. God wants if you have faith in your heart. Now, remember this, faith comes from the hearing, the hearing of the word of God. When you hear the word of God and it calls for an action, you take God wants you to take that action. God wants you within your heart to follow the instruction of what struck your heart and in doing so God will bring his promise to come to pass into your life. That's what's not up to the people today in the world. Many of them have faith but they are afraid to launch out is just afraid that the virtue of or to venture a little bit and to say well I can I can do all things to Christ that strengthened me. Look at him. He said, "Launch out into the deep and let down for the drought." Oh, I tell you, he says, "The marvelous thing that I've ever seen in my life in this great hour," this is in the message, the testimony. He says, "When I get against the wall and I can't get over or under or around it." That's right. And then I trust God and he opens a way. I go through it. God takes you through it. &gt;&gt; When you meet against a mountain and situation, I don't know what to do. I wish this will go away. God said, "No, it's going to stay there." You want to go to the left, he blocks away. You want to go to the right, he blocks away. Keep walking. Once it's you done all that you could, he wants you to go through it. Why? Because he will be the one that will take you through it. My brother, my sister, how many situations have we ever been in that we thought, "This is the end of us. I'm never going to live past this. This is the end of me." But yet, we are here testifying of his goodness. What happened? God took you through it. When you didn't know what to do, when you didn't know where to go, God took you through it. Why? He's the He's the beginner and the finisher of your faith. If he ever started a work, he will finish the job. God is not a halfway builder. He's a complete builder. &gt;&gt; It says when you come out the other side, like Samson, I love this. It says then when he kills the lion, when you got out to the other side, when you kill the lion, he got the he says he got the sweetest honey that he ever eat out of the carcass. Remember the sweetest testimony is when you go through something you come out to the other side. You can tell it. And let me say this, the beauty about a testimony like that. When you minister that testimony, you are ministering life to others. Why? Because you know what it's like. You know God took you through. You know without him, you couldn't make it. And then when you come to the other side, you become his life manifested to the people. something. It says sometimes sometimes if you'll overcome something by the grace of God, it'll be one of the sweetest thing that you ever tasted in your life. Isn't that right? It says, and I know you that are spiritual, you know what I'm speaking of. The word of God is not to stay on the shoreline. If they had stayed on the shoreline, it would have been a different story. But the requirement was for them to get on that boat and to launch out. when to launch out is the caring and natural act that was actually producing a supernatural result. When you come and you say I I often even ask a question, how do you explain that you can lay hands on somebody and they will feel well? Tell me what science does it. The act in itself will not be helpful. But what actually produces the result is the fact that you obeying the word of God by doing the act and through the action God blesses the action so the result could come out. It's actually the obedience to the word of God. You come and it says repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. I I tell our young people I said the but when says that the Holy Spirit is there to confirm the word. So you do what the word said to do. You repent of your sin. You go and be baptized. When you come out it's no longer your responsibility. God is obligated to give you the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Otherwise it's us doing everything. No, he's the author and the finisher. He wants obedience from us and from the obedience he will bring the manifestation. &gt;&gt; The blessing was not in staying at the shoreline but it was in the obedience to the word and get out of their comfort zone. Out of what they knew to be true, out of what their senses in their bodies were telling them. Out of everything. Out of all of that, they had no understanding of what the results could be except to trust in what is said. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. When we trust in what is said, that's what will produce the result. How many times I can even say this. How many times you know God you you're praying for something and and you build your own map on all the avenues that God is supposed to bless you through. You said I know he can bless me like this and I know he's going to use tap router. He's going to do this. You you you you you plant you you you paint your own picture and all of that. But yet when it comes is completely opposite of every thought you've ever thought. And yet it's in simplicity. You're like, "How come I didn't think of that?" Why? That's God. &gt;&gt; He's trying to show you that I am God and I know exactly what I want to do. I am God and I know how I'm going to change this. Peter had fish all night of his own strength. He's tried everything with his own strength. But one word from him was enough to change the whole circumstance. My brother, my sister, one word from him is more than 10,000 words from men. One word from him is all it takes. The commandment requires faith. It wasn't in their logic. It wasn't in their understanding. Yes, they were tired. They were empty-headed. They were discouraged. But he said, "Go back and do it again." But in obedience to that, that's what brought the result. obedience in it is what brings forth the miracle. The fish were it's not about the fish not being there. The fish were created by the same voice that said go back in that instruction was included all the fish that they could catch that day. &gt;&gt; It wasn't in their abilities. It was the instruction that he was giving them. Let down your net. Show God that you expect some results. Show God that you go expecting a separation for my own understanding to your understanding. God wants us to show him that God, I I have no mind of my own. I've lost myself. I don't understand what's about to happen. I'm only walking by what you said at this moment, not by my own understanding. When Jesus went into the boat, the seasons was empty and and and emptiness and but yet when he spoke the word, the deep it was he was bringing them to a revelation of what it means to walk with God. Walking with God, it doesn't take a logic. It takes faith in what instructions he gives us. Peter obedience led to the blessing so great that they were overflowing with the fish. What God is asking us is to try this time by his word, not by our own self. Could they have failed? Probably that's what they were thinking. But the difference was this time it was him that said it, not them that said it. But I'm going to say this. When you say this is in a message, the greatest shining light, it says when you say great mountain shining light. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. When you say mountain be moved and then it says and he stands still there and you say well it didn't happen. It says oh it did happen. When you say mountain move, maybe one little significant grain of the sand turned loose out of the hundreds of billions and billions tons of the little one little grain moved. It's the beginning. It's beginning to take a to take place. Hold to that faith and watch the mountain disappear. Certainly We live in the age where we want, we speak, it happens. You know, us fellowship with brother Jonathan, we speak. If you're not careful, we we build the generation that there's no endurance. There's no staying until it happens. There's no I will stand here until my change come. There's this generation. I prayed yesterday, it didn't happen. I move on. I I said this and God didn't hear me. No, it may not happen in your time. It happens in this time. He's the one who determines the season, the time, and what happens. It's not up to us to determine. You can't say because I asked and I didn't see it. No, maybe your change is coming, but you just don't know it. You left too soon. People say this message is not real. Oh, my brother, my sister, you have not stayed long enough to see what the message can do. God is not building some househ hot plant. He's looking for real believers. Like Buddy Robinson, he says, "You will come. If I don't get the Holy Spirit, you will find my bones when you come back." That's real endurance. And says, "Perseverance come by faith. is because you have heard something from God that you can stand there and say, "I will not move until it comes to pass." It says, "Thou shalt say in our hearts, disease move, disease move from my child, disease move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus." And don't doubt. It says right there, the good germs, listen to this, the good germs take on the new armor and the new weapon. And the the enemy began to go to back up. You'll you'll you'll defeat you are defeated because Christ in the drinking of the mirror and Calvary defeated the devil and every one of his power. He strips him of everything that he had and is nothing is nothing but a bluff. He can do he can go through with it. He will do it. In other word when we say that that one word arms the germs in your body. Think about that. And he gives them power to go to war for you to defeat the germs that are causing your sicknesses and to fight them until the result has come to pass. He said God's extremity or men's extremity is God's opportunity. when when we come to the end of our road and when we come to a place where we feel God I don't have any more ability he says his strength is made perfect in your weakness when your strength ends his strength is only beginning when your ability stops his ability is only beginning when you cannot do anything God is fully able to do it for you. When you struggle, he's already overcome for you. When our weakness and our inabilities and our failures, they come and they show up is only the opportunity for him to make his strength to be made known unto him. But whenam says in fact in proving his word God will actually wait until the situation gets a little bit worse. Really? I've been calling. I've been praying. What do you mean you wait until See, God don't want your ability. God don't want to to be a confusion between is it God that got that healed me or is it really the medicine and the medication and this God wants a clear distinction within your life that when something happened you know who to attribute the glory to. &gt;&gt; He he looked at the children of Israel he looked at uh he he tells the children of Israel and he tells them I want you to go. It tells Caleb and Joshua, it tells Joshua, I want you to actually go and cross Jordan when the river is full. You said, "Wait a minute. They could have actually waited few months later when the river is all the way down and cross it. But God waited until it was rainy season, until the river was completely full and then he sends them over so they can go cross it. What is he doing? God wants to show you that his power is good for every situation. God wants to show you that when he has already spoken it, there's nothing that can change it. When he's already made it available, there's nothing that can change that circumstance. If we would only take him at his word, if we would only believe what he said to us. If we would only He looked at martyr, they came and told Jesus, "Oh, your friend Lazarus is sick." The Bible says Jesus instead of heading towards where Lazarus was, he went the opposite direction. They came back and said, "Master, he he he now died." He said, "No, Lazarus is not dead. He slipped." He says, "Now, let's go." They come back and and Mary and Martha, we know the story very well, and comes and said, "Oh, master, if you only been here, if you could only have made it in time, my brother would have not died." Jesus looked at [snorts] him and says, "No, your brother shall live again." It says, "I know, but it's in the resurrection day that he shall live again." He said, and then Jesus answered and said unto him, if I could just read it, then martyr said, this is in uh uh John 11 and 20. He says, "And martyr," as soon as he heard that Jesus came, he went and he met uh Mary and he says and he sat still at the house. He says, "Then martyr said unto Jesus," he says, "If thou had been here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now, whatever thou shalt ask of God, he will give it to thee. Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again. And Martha said unto her, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection in the end time. And Jesus unto I said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth on me, though he's dead, though he were dead, he shall live again. What was he doing? Martha understanding of the resurrection was sometime in the future when all the dead are raised. But she Jesus is trying to bring to her memory that the resurrection is actually the life that's standing in front of you. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, it's the life that's in you today. That's the life that would raise you up. It's not another life that's coming from somewhere. You, as you're sitting here tonight, you already have the resurrection life in you. &gt;&gt; So, he comes and he looks at them and he goes to the tomb and he says, "Roll away the stone." And now they all looking at him because they know that corruption happens after 3 days. And they know that after that time, the nose already sunk. He's already polluted. and everything and they afraid. He says, "Roll away the stone." And he spoke and he says, "Lazareth, come forth." But one says he had to call the name because if he didn't say it, the whole resurrection was going to happen at that time. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we are walking with the resurrection in our midst tonight. The &gt;&gt; resurrection is not some future event, but he's here walking with us. It says and now the word of God the written the writ that's written in the Bible his word to us this is in the he says that's written to us every promise has the same power of creation behind it that God than God did at the beginning. Every promise has the same power of creation behind it than that God word did in the beginning. If we believe it to be God's word, depend on where the seed falls. If it falls into the ground, a ground that can create moisture and nourishment around the promise of God, it will bring forth every promise that the Bible made. This word of God, same creative power than the word that spoke in the beginning that said let there be. If we let it fail upon the word, upon our hearts where we can moisture it, let it grow, nourish it, it will produce the same promise that the Bible made. It says the right mental attitude towards every divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you'll just take it. If you just look at it, take care of the word, right? Because the infinite God that spoke it, that's God's word. So, it's really not what we can produce as a human. It's what's been produced or spoken by the word. When we receive it as the word of God, God will take that word and make it a reality for our lives. He says, he talks about the three Hebrew boys. He says, "Oh, I love this." And the king had made a proclamation. This is this young man that came and it was a time where they were about to be put into the flames because they refuse to obey the word of the king. And he said that he they won't bend down to the image and he will throw them in the fierce fire. They said, "Our God is able to deliver us from the fierce furnace, but nevertheless, if he don't, we won't bow down to you." &gt;&gt; Now, that's determination. &gt;&gt; That's determination. It says, "I like that. I like that determination." And the king said, "I'll burn I'll burn you. I'll burn you some holy roll of religious out of them." So they got the old furnace hot and seven times hotter. Then it says, I see them tie their hands behind and they had prayed. They had they had a prayer meetings all night and and the next day they marched them and they came and the they walked up to the they walked up here up the road and where there was and the stone road to the furnace and they dropped off to the furnace and I can see the great strong man that kind of set up and say now we'll see how good this religion is how much whether you will take his word or not. But they had but they had had issues from they had had an issue from God and and not to bow they had had an issue from God that not to bow down to the image that of the word of his word and I can see them start that death march and the old king are roaring and the red fires and and they said you want to take it back. They said no no sir. So now they're trying to get them to recount. They said, "No sir, our God is able to deliver us from this, but if you won't do it, we still won't bow." So up the road they went and they got closer. He says, "Don't you worry. You take God at his word and the devil will turn the heat on you. Don't you think he won't?" So every time you decide to take God at his word, the devil is there to prove it. And he said, "And up the road they went, and they got further, and they got harder and harder. And he began, and I can hear Shadrach say to Mach, "Are you sure you prayed through?" "Yes, everything is right. Let's go then." Oh, on up the road. And they began to stagger from the uh instance into the heat and come and and getting closer. One more step. And they were going into into there. look like a black picture for the believer, doesn't it? It says, "Now, let's turn our camera all the time that there's something happening down here, there's something going on up there, too. I love that. I love that. Whenever something is happening down here, whatever you're going on through, heaven is looking down." Because remember the earth was created to be the reflection of heaven. The earth was created to be the very reflection. God the god of heaven and then he created Adam to be the god of the earth. So there's always a reflection. So he says let's look up there and I see what's going on. And I can see him sitting this gracely priestly ho robe hanging around him watching down a cross. And I can see this great archangel Gabriel. He came up and pulled his sword and unleashed his sword and he stand there. It says, "Master, have you looked down in Babylon?" He says, "Why? There's men down there, three people that stood on your word and they are standing on it and they are fixing to be burned to burn them this morning." And I can hear him say, "Yes, Gabriel, I'm watching them." I love that. It says, I can hear him say, "Look, I stood by your side. Let me go down there and I will change the scenery this morning. It says, I believe you could do you could do it. I can hear him say, Gabriel, you've been a good angel. You've done just what I've told you ever since I created you. But stick [snorts] your sword back there. It says, "Stuck it back there." Gabriel took his place at his side. And here comes another angel flashing up real quick. and his name was Wormwood and he had control over the water. And I could hear him say, "Master, down there in Babylon," he says, "Have you consider Babylon?" He says, "Why?" He said, "Let me go down there in the analvian destruction. Just give me the power over the water." It says, "I broke up the springs and I brought through the atmosphere down there. I can wash the whole earth over. Let me go down there this morning. I will wash Babylon off the face of the earth. I believe he could do that. He could have done it. That's right. He says, "Have you considered them?" He said, "I've watched them all night long." I love that he watches over his elect. He He's not left you alone tonight for you to faint for yourself. The trouble about it says that we try to do our own achievement and leave God out of it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want it to work that way. What good would it be for you to overcome things by yourself? Whose glory is that going to be? God wants to help us. There is no overcoming outside of his word. Why? Because the word is the part of God that's been given to us to overcome our challenges. He's watching over his elect and is not lost to one. He said, "And every eye and and every every eye on the sparrow and I know he watches over over us as we sing. I'm happy it watches over every hour. He knows every uh he knows everything that we're going through." That's right. He watches over them all night. and the angel and that great man. I've done all that I've told you. He says, "But I can't let you go down there this morning because I'm going myself. I'm going myself." And then the prophet says, "It's a mansized job." Amen. He said, "Look, they just got one more step and they're going to go right on." Sometimes God sits still. Let it get to the last minute. You are the only one that's in a hurry, not God. He knows what he's going to do. Just believe him and he is the answer. And he says, "And the answer is on his side." He's on the answering side. Let me say this. When you believe the word of God, God does not engage an angel. He says this is a mansized job. He is the one responsible for the outcome. He wants you to know that when you take him at his word, he will come to make the word a reality. &gt;&gt; He's not going to send the third person. He's not going to send. That's why Trinity doesn't make any sense. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Who's the word? Who's going to come? No. He said, "It's my word." When you stand on my word, he doesn't send Michael. He doesn't send wormwood. He's wanting to come for himself to prove his word to be true. And I can see him come down and I can see him get off the throne and his priestly gamut drop around him. And this great majesty, he says, like everything obeys him. And I can see this great big thunderheads hanging back there in the north. And I can hear him say, "East wind, west wind, north wind, west." It says, "Come here. Every wind, every everything minds him. All but men. Man knows more about it than he does." Oh, he thinks he does. I can hear him say, "Go over to the thunderhead and bring bring him here." Right. Then I got a mission for you. Wind and waves obey him. Everything obey him. And I can see that big thunderhead roll over there and step up in the chariot and my it says reached up and got a hold of Ziglag lightning and crashed in the sky to let them know that he's the one hearing hearing them on their side. Hallelujah. I'm watching you and I know where you are cracking in the lightning. It says right then it says I can see him passed down by the sea of life and pick up a palm out of the sea of life and out of the time of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego step into the fierest fire. There was one standing there by their side. He says, listen to this, he was figning away the fire hours after hours of pleasure in there. The king said, "Open up the door, I see if there's in there, and I see," it says, "Though you put three in there, I see four, and one is like the Son of God." Who told him what the Son of God looks like? I tell you, when you see him, you recognize him because he's known by his nature. He's known by his characteristics. What is he telling us? When you walk into the situation, however it looks, when you step into there by faith, you will find him already waiting for you. Let me say this, my brother, my sister. There's only one that has the right to say I was forsaken and that was Jesus Christ. But the Lord Jesus fulfilled that scripture. So none of us tonight can use that scripture anymore. We have no right to say we are forsaken. He's the present help in times of need. The scripture says the name of the Lord is a strong tower. He's made himself available. So whatever you're going through tonight is here to answer to the needs. If the musician could come and I want to say this, these Hebrew children taking God at his word caused the whole heaven to come together and start looking at their situation. Them taking at his word, you had angels over here and angels over there wanting to come and and come to their rescue. And God looks at them and says, "No, worries. This is a man-sized job. This is me. I need to go." My brother, my sister, God wants to bless you more than you want the blessing. But one of them says he if you can take all the waters of the earth and put it into a single pipe and push it through, that's how much he wants to bless you and I. And the only way we can receive his blessing is by taking him at his word. He doesn't want us to go wander for ourselves. He doesn't want us to go and produce for ourselves. He wants us to stand and claim his word as our promise to know that his promise is the reality. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. His word is more real than your circumstances. Your circumstances will change, but his word won't. Your circumstances will be worse today, better tomorrow, but his word will remain constant. When he speaks, he speaks truth. When he speaks, he speaks life. There's only one form of life of eternal life as the prophet said, and that comes by the word of God. Let's all stand. And if you have a need on your heart tonight, just wanted to lay that for my heart. to you this morning. It wouldn't do any good to start with men thinking. But if we know that if we take him at his word that he's going to come to meet us this weekend. If we can only know that if I step and stand upon the word of God, he's here to make it a reality in my heart. If I stand upon his word, my life, whatever it is that I'm going through, he has the power to change it and make it conformed to his word. But whenam talks about this man, he said he came John Ryan. He came and he was prayed for and and he came and he went and he he was still blind and he came to brother Banham and he says I thought you said I was healed. Brother Bham said I thought you claim to believe the word. He said well what should I do? He said well you you've been prayed for you believe the word just go on confessing. Oh my. But when said there will be meetings and there will be preaching and John Ryan will be in the back and said, "Praise God, I'm healed." And and he it almost became like it was disturbing the service and the deacons wanted to go and you know how deacons are you know trying to put him in order and just let him you know he come and preach go oh praise God I'm healed. What was he doing? He was claiming the promise that was given. I don't know how many days that went on and but we are told one day he was you know getting his haircut in the salon and sitting there at the barber shop and getting his haircut and and now the barber decided to make fun of him. He said John I heard that you were healed. They said yeah I've been down there and I got prayed and I got healed. And it says well you know you still can't see but aren't you healed? And the moment John spoke that, confessed the word out of his mouth, his eyes come open. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Confessing what the word said. He just lined up says if God said by your stripes you are healed and you repeat the same thing that God said and I repeat the same thing that he did that word will carry out and produce exactly what are we doing when we believe the word of God we are riding on what he said &gt;&gt; and if his word is a reality it will produce this reality into our heart. Let's not ride our own wave. Let's not create another wave. He's already provided the wave. &gt;&gt; He said that his word was good from the beginning until rapture. Let's just ride it all the way to the end. He said, "Never, ever, ever have a negative confession." And I just told you tonight, take your camera, whatever your camera tells you, before you make a decision, take a moment to consider God's camera. Take a moment, say, "My camera shows me I'm no good, and I have failures. My inabilities keep coming up. I can't do anything right." But what is God? camera says, "I tell you, when you look at his camera, you will see the perfect picture of who you are." Butam said one place, he said, "God took a picture of you not when you were 16 or 17. He took your picture when you were at your best." Where did he put it? He put it in this book. So when you read this, you are actually reading your perfect picture that he had taken of you before even the foundation of the world. This is the real you, who you really are. Don't look at the picture or the camera that this flesh is presenting. All you're going to see is failure. What does he want to do? He wants to bring us into the perfect picture of what we were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; If you have a need upon your heart, just lift your hand up to him and say, "Lord, you know what I have made of. You know the disappointment that I've looked and caused within myself." And Lord, tonight I want you to look at me, Lord. I want to look at you not through my own camera but the camera of your word and see the promises that you've made. Father, I want to believe them and walk in them. Because if I walk by my own sight, Father, I will fail. But if I walk by the sight that you've provided and the camera that you've provided, Lord, it will produce the result of what you want. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for your word tonight. Father, I pray that this word that was spoken, Lord, and Father, let it not return void, but it may accomplish that which it was spoken for. Father, that heart may be touched. And Father, that we ourselves may examine ourselves in light of the light of the word. And Father, we find out where we fell short. That Father, that we may be encouraged in what was spoken. And that, Father, we may look at our humanity and and Father, consider it none. and and take the word and what you have spoken and walk upon it to know that it will produce the result for which you have spoken it. We commit the service to you Lord and Father we raise our hands and we say come and now that the word has gone forth let the Holy Spirit come into the building Lord once again and and confirm the hearts to each heart of the believer Lord. Father you are the only one that can make this word of God reality. We commit everything that we are and ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Give me your seat. In moment I sing out. Oh, and [singing] I sing out song to Jesus [music] in moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I lift [music] up my hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, I lift up my hands to the Lord. Oh, sing.

And he formed [singing and music] my heart. And before [music and singing] even time began, my [music] life [singing] was in his hands. And he knows [music] my [singing] name. And he knows [music] my [singing] every thought. And he [music] sees each tear [singing] that falls and hears [music] me when I call. [music] I have a father. [music] He calls me his own. [music] And he'll never [singing] leave me. No [music] matter where I go. He knows [music and singing] my name. He knows [music] my [singing] every thought. And he sees [music] each tear that falls. And he [music] hears me when I [singing] call. Oh, I have a father. [music] He [singing] calls me his own. And he'll never [music] [singing] leave me, no matter [music] where I go. Oh, [singing] he [music] knows [singing] my name. He knows [music] my every [singing] thought. And he sees [music] each tear that falls. and he hears me [music] when I call. I have a father. He calls me [singing and music] his own and he'll never [singing] leave me. no [music] matter where I go. [music] And he knows my name. [music] He knows my every [music] thought. And he sees [singing] each [music] tear that falls. and he hears me when I call. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love what he said. You know the way it is when somebody gets up and preaches a wonderful message, you want to get up and preach all over again. But he said all the fish were included in the word that said, "Let down your nets." See, he sees beyond the action. We have the tiredness. We have the weariness. We have the I've tried it before. We have the I've done this enough. I don't want to do it again. And what he says is if you could only see what'll happen if you'll just do it one more time. &gt;&gt; You do it. Paul said, "Don't be weary and welloing." &gt;&gt; Anybody a little weary these days? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I think we're all weary whether we raised our hands or not. Don't be weary. No. &gt;&gt; Do it one more time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I thought he covered everything there. I was prayed for. I'm not healed. I've tried and I failed. I believed and I didn't get the victory. Amen. Sister Brenda, how many times did they have to cut your ear before you got healed? &gt;&gt; Three times. 20 stitches. But now the doctor can't tell which one he cut and which one he didn't. Amen. &gt;&gt; The victory requires a battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The testimony requires a test. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The blessing requires a trial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The adoption requires a training. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's just wanting us to take a look beyond the action and believe that everything he says is for our good. It's for our benefit. There's something greater. He never borrows something unless he pays us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll never leave us hanging. &gt;&gt; It's us that leaves him hanging. It's us that says, "Well, you didn't do it in my time. You didn't do it my way. You didn't do it with my people. You didn't do it with my gifts." He's just saying, "Just do it. Just do what I ask you and watch what happens." Amen. What a wonderful, wonderful message. God bless you, Brother Billy. I'm looking forward to the next couple of services. Amen. And we can only go greater and greater. If we started this good, let's look for more. Remember, Brother Bam says if somebody gains their their sight today, we want to look for somebody to be healed, raised from the dead in the next service. Amen. Let's not say that was great. Let's No, let's say Lord, there's more for me. Lord, take me higher. Take me deeper in it. Amen. We're going to sing that song. Amen. Be it unto me. 10:08 is the one. Be it unto me according to your word. They had fished all night. And they didn't fish by, you know, reeling, throwing out, and reeling in. This was real effort. &gt;&gt; Throwing down nets, throwing out nets, letting them go, hauling them up, w water logging them, &gt;&gt; and nothing, nothing, nothing. He says, "Throw them down and get ready for the drop. Get ready for what comes." Lord, we've done it so many times, but at thy word, I'll do it. You know what? He didn't finish the verses. You know what? S what what Simon said he said I'm an unclean man after that &gt;&gt; all my efforts all my trying I'm an unclean man &gt;&gt; but at thy word &gt;&gt; at thy word you met the need amen it's not by works &gt;&gt; Paul said why are you going back to the law you started in the spirit &gt;&gt; now you gone back to the law come to the word and let me do the work that's what God's trying to say amen Amen.
