those that didn't make it oh okay brother amen praise the lord so the lord willing today uh not exactly knowing what i was going to minister on so the lord willing we're going to hear the prophet minister and it's uh it's a maybe a no doubt a tape or a book we've read or a tape we've heard a number of times because they ministered in 1963 november the 24th anybody know what that is that's today no they don't know amen but you know the message and it is three kinds of believers amen so we've heard that before and we've and i believe we've even heard the tape before it's been a while amen but let's hear it again because the closer we get even to the rapture we need to have this revelation we need to have this understanding that what we're dealing with the spirits we're dealing with amen is getting more and more and more deceiving that's true truth to the extent well it's to the extent where the scripture says when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth amen it's going to get that bad even among oh well there's going to be a lot of believers believers yeah believing what but again brothers their denominations of this denomination that denomination they all profess to be believers and they're believing what god has revealed to to their founders maybe maybe 50 years ago 100 years ago 500 years ago but they're believing this believing that but again brother sister we truly believe what god has revealed to us in these last days amen the prophet warned us and i believe it's the lord not just william branham but it's the lord in the ministry of the message three kinds of believers let's make sure that we are believers the true believers holy ghost believers that we are not make believers unbelievers but true believers and brother oh my what a deception if we're if we're make believers thinking we're believers that's the truth the problem of god said and and when it comes to these three he said they're in they're in the church uh in this church well i hope not i trust we're all believers but again the the bigger the crowd the more you get mixed amen the more there is when it comes to believers make believers unbelievers but there's going to be a greater number of make-believers and a greater number of unbelievers and a few believers because the scripture warns us concerning the few that's going to be true from faithful and that are going to be really ready for the resurrection really ready for the rapture in the last days again that's why he said when he comes will he find faith will he find real believers that are believing not in your head but believing in your heart i know i've already ministered on these things a number of times concerning those that believe up here when it comes to their head and those that believe in their flesh and their feelings but how many are believing in the heart the prophet of god again let me remind you he said you can have the holy ghost he said 24 hours a day and go to hell amen you can have the experience of the holy ghost in your head you can have the experience of the holy ghost in your flesh and go to hell but how many really got the holy ghost in their souls amen so that you can truly say it's not me that lives it's christ that lives in me amen not many can say that because most they're living themselves by their feelings others are living you know while i'm living by the word but it's intellectual and it's in there in their minds amen but not in their hearts oh i pray the grace of god let go let god have his way so lord brother sister so it's not you living the life that you're living is jesus living in you amen so the actions you have the reactions you have the thoughts you have it's jesus am god help us amen brother let go and let god have his way amen and because we need to make it our calling election sure and especially in these last days because we've been warned that it's going to be a deceiving hour we've been warned that it's going to be you know there's going to be very very very few true believers amen the vast majority of those attending church make believers or unbelievers unbelievers going to church probably god said they're all in church amen and again of course he warned us he said the first one in church is the devil amen and he's there he's there to influence your thoughts your feelings your emotions amen and he'll there you're there to give you these thoughts and make you believe that it's god but it's the devil oh yeah he's there to give you this feeling and make you believe that's god but it's the devil oh yes so brother sister we better be on our guard make your calling and your election sure amen what make sure that you're you're you're living by the word amen you're living in the word and more important the word is living in you amen praise the lord so it's it's not you doing this doing that it's jesus in you amen by the grace of almighty god so as we go into the message of the prophet today concerning three kinds of believers again we're being challenged to determine who are we are you a believer are you a make-believer are you an unbeliever and you mean to tell me they're around the message they're around the message because they'll believe this and they'll they'll believe god said a prophet but are they going to believe all that the prophet said that's right no they'll believe this they'll believe that but not this they'll put their interpretation of this amen brother leave it the way that god revealed it amen believe it the way that god revealed it amen it's god remember either god is doing anything for the message of the hour he is challenging our faith amen and the question is over and over again believeth thou this amen you hear the prophet or you read it in one of the books believers thou this brother and sometimes again the prophet warned us you can believe it intellectually and you can believe the letter of it but not the spirit of it oh yeah you're walking by the letter and but not by the spirit you're walking as it were intellectually by religion but not by the spiritual revelation of god brother god in control god in control of your thoughts god in control of your feelings god in control of you your actions and reactions oh yes so again i trust by grace that you could yeah you can really believe it really say it it's not me that lives no no the life i'm living no no that's not me that's jesus amen and i'm yielding more and more to jesus every day amen let go and let god have his way oh brother so brother when oh and he allowed this to happen in your life you allow this to cross your path this to to do this and that oh yeah what for to bring out the the anointing that's really on you bring up the anointing the life that's really in you is it christ in you or is it just religion or is it the devil oh yeah so brother are we the true not make believers not unbelievers but true holy ghost believers we believe god we believe the word amen and your and you'll go forth and live the life reflecting the word oh yeah amen they'll see that you're just not religious person you're spiritual amen you're you're you're not united or a church goer you're born again amen because there's too many brother sister that are religious but not spiritual very religious and they can think religiously and talk religiously but not spiritual so i pray the grace of god help us to be spiritual sons and daughters of god born again really truly born again amen oh yeah you if you're born again you absolutely got a new nature amen it's just not your thoughts it's your nature i tell you if anything proves your birth it's your nature oh yeah because we can we can meet this one meet this one meet that one and we we want we judge them by their nature oh oh that's their father that's their mother why because they're acting like it they're talking like it oh yeah you wouldn't you're going to have the nature of your natural parents amen and natural family amen so if you're born again you're going to have the nature of your spiritual from the nature of god the nature of jesus this is absolutely a challenge so i pray god help us lord that we're going to judge ourselves by the word amen oh yeah my nature is not because i go to this church this is how they act in that church no no no before i come to that church i got a new nature praise the lord amen god bless sister ruth sister ruth guy amen brother guy's daughter welcome to the assembly amen we certainly miss brother guy amen i certainly do amen and like i said i've wonderful times of fellowship with our brother over the years amen and like i said just before he went he called me on the phone and uh he said i got got to talk to you about these things please pray for me brother he said i need prayer amen so that's good and again like i said there's a number of people who called me on the phone before the lord called them home even even to uh brother manuel and there was another sister burns and and i talked to others and oh yeah they said please pray for me amen well why because why they wanted to get ready to meet the lord praise the lord they're on their way to god be the glory so brother that believing that we are believers amen and if we are we have that that concern one for another and we're praying one for another oh yes so god help us brother sister let's make sure that we are true believers that we are not make believers by any means and that we are not unbelievers well if you're oh how come you're you're considered a non-believer you're in church and you go to church every sunday or every wednesday whatever well what god's looking at is do you believe the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen it's not just saying well i'm an unbeliever so i i don't believe it i don't go to church no there's many unbelievers in church as the prophet said they're all in church that's right to all three just make sure that we are believers we believe amen and brother you pursue you prove your faith you prove your belief by the life you live the way you live how you live what oya you go forth and you're acting you're going to talk you're going to react as believers amen praise the lord god help us amen let's stand and let's read john chapter 5. and verse 39 john chapter 5 and reading for verse 39 before we go into the word by the prophet and it's for brother visual there it's three kinds of believers november the 24th 1963 and to begin my brother at paragraph 41 yeah paragraph 41 and we'll finish with paragraph 2 8 3. amen in john chapter 5 and verse 39 search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me amen and ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honor from men but i know that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another come in his own name m ye will receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even moses in whom ye trust for had ye believed moses he would have believed me for he wrote of me amen but if you believe not his ratings how shall you believe my words amen if you believe not the writings of god how shall we believe what god has revealed through the prophet messenger of this hour god help us to be truly believers amen not make believers not a non-believer but an absolute believer in what god has said what god is doing amen and what god will do that brother sister it is christ in us the hope of glory praise the lord and what is christ doing in us he's revealing his word amen he's bringing his word to pass for the glory of god amen heavenly father we ask the grace of your presence and the grace of your anointing with us because lord we need you and we need you lord every step of the way and lord we need you every hour of the day lord we need lord your revelation we need your understanding lord we need that that right attitude and that right spirit so lord i pray grace in the name of our lord jesus christ for a greater and a greater and a greater anointing of the holy ghost a greater and a greater anointing lord of your presence with us in us in control lord so again lord that is not me it's not my brother's ear not my sister's lord that's living but lord it's jesus living in us amen is christ in control of us so lord o god in the name of our lord jesus christ please have the preeminence in our thoughts and have the preeminence in our words and in our deeds and lord us all for your glory your honor your praise that we go for alleluia that we go forth lord hallelujah trusting jesus oh lord that we go for truly believing jesus amen truly surrender to jesus so again lord the truth would be lord that is not me not my brother not my sister that lives but lord it's you it's our lord jesus christ living in us amen and father again lord bringing those scriptures to to pass bringing the word to pass lord hallelujah that what you have promised you are bringing to pass in our lives that what you said you were going to do lord you're doing in me with me and through us amen and yes lord not just me but father my brothers and sisters in christ oh lord i pray grace grace grace lord the father that before we leave this building today father we'll have the confirmation that jesus is in control that jesus is living his life in us and through us jesus lord that you are bearing witness of your truth your word amen father in our thoughts in our words in our deeds and it's all for your glory and your honor and your praise be with us we pray lord as we committed all into your care soul body and spirit grace to the saints of god around the world and lord hallelujah the believing really believing in our hearts that we're pressing on we're moving on and lord we're getting closer to the resurrection we're getting closer to the rapture amen grace we pray for your glory in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord you may be seated and we'll go into the message again three kinds of believers and again to remind our brother that we'll start with paragraph 41 and end with paragraph 2 8 3. god bless yours okay okay brother matthew amen praise the lord six let's begin now with the sixth chapter of saint john and beginning with the 60th verse many therefore of his disciples when they heard heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it then jesus knew himself that his disciples murmured added and he said unto them does this offend thee what if ye shall see the son of man ascending up where he was before is is it the spirit that quicken and the flesh prophet that nothing that's right the words that i speak unto you they are spirit that's him and they are life what do you say i am the truth the life they are spirit they are life but there are some of you that believe not or jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore i said unto you that no man can come to me except it were given unto him of my father and from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him hard sayings that he couldn't take him then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go for thou has the words of eternal life and we believe that and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god jesus answered him have i not chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of judas is a carrot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve now if i should call this a subject for tonight and try my best to make that half our count i want to talk on three kinds of believers and i've often made the statement i thought well i'll just believe i'll preach on it one time this afternoon i thought then the first is believers make believers and unbelievers now that is quite a a subject but as sure as we sit here tonight that group is always together together wherever the people gather we find this group and always have found them and we probably always will have them until the coming of the lord and i want us tonight to picture ourselves as i speak of these three groups and see what group that we are in now remember i'm speaking here to maybe uh this church packed again tonight around in the walls and corners but i'm also speaking the world around see and all different parts of the world these tapes circulate through ministries of the tapes now i want to speak of the three different types of believers now now remember believers my subject is believers one of them is a true believer and the next is a make-believer and the next is an unbeliever i think now the first group we'd like to talk about is the believer because i think he ought to be first because he is the one that truly believes now believes like the disciples believed her we're going to use this uh scripture reading for example now the first is believers genuine believers and faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god the word of god which is christ see believers now did you notice this great statement this believer made now a believer doesn't have to be a smart person in the world's way of being smart he doesn't have to be an educated person in the way that uh these people uh try to uh to say that you have to be but you do not yeah this man that made this statement the bible itself said that he was both ignorant and unlearned peter he was not a uh really considered an intelligent person and isaiah 35 says there shall be a highway and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over i was talking one of the deacons this afternoon as we talk about the bridges spanning across this new one i said there's many expansions across bodies of water bios today and i said but there's one great expansion that reaches some earth to glory it's called the king's highway the unclean shall not pass over it that's right it's a a road that's built by christ our lord the expansion that is made from this earth to another land uh and the unclean doesn't pass over peter this unlearned person of uh standing there when he had saw the thoroughly uh vindicated word of the day that god promised in that day that there would be a one rise up which should be a a prophet among them and simon was hard to believe it because there were been so many impersonations of it but when he seen the genuine unfolded word of that age and here he properly identified he he was certainly convinced who he was and uh he was the one said uh lord to whom would we go when it was asked him when the crowds were separating between the believers and unbelievers and make believers there was all three of them standing right there and that one company of people believers make believers and unbelievers write down in this chapter right here and because that jesus said spoke the words the way he had it separated his congregation but it must be done he was a great man as long as he healed the sick but when he come down to the doctrine and the prophecy that's what separated the the chat from the wheat the chapel wraps around the wheat is not the wheat it cannot be used there's nothing in it no life and it's a husk and it cannot stay with the wheat it will be air with the wheat and so it's got just the green is what we're talking about the heart of the grain of the wheat now notice uh peter was convinced that that was a messiah now i don't make any difference what all the rest of them said it didn't make any difference what the priest said didn't matter to simon peter what the church said he was convinced himself jesus told him in one place where he asked who does man say i am and some said you're a prophet some said you want the old prophets raised up and your moses or elias or somebody said i asked you what do you think and peter said die to christ amen the son of the living god he said blessed art thou the son of jonas simon the son of jonas for flesh and blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from a book or from a creed or from a catechism you my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you there's a genuine believer spiritual revelation of the word and up guard simon and upon this rock of your revelation of who i am i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against them see no wonder simon said to whom would we go jesus turned and said do you wish to go also and they said lord who would we where would we go to for thou alone has the words of life you're the only one for not only did he have the words of life he was the word of lies and he was the word of life and simon thoroughly recognized this and when he recognized it that was what that kept his hope because it was revealed to him that he was that living word now that's a genuine believer when the holy spirit not some persuaded by some other person not for some other thing but one the holy spirit has revealed to you the word itself and you see the word made plain vindicated then the spirit of god come and get into that age for the word for that age and make it manifested how could a man kept from believing luther if you know that luther was a reformer the man's spirit went forth there for reformation wesley the same way they had to believe it see that was that was a message to the church age that was exactly what was happening that's what was to take place you had to believe it and here we are down to the lady austen age and we were taught in the lady of seeing age that christ was put out of his church and was even knocking on the door trying to get back in so when we see that happening we know what age we're living in and then we're at the closing of the history of the world the book is now being finished the last line will be wrote across it someday and shall be closed up man time shall be no more and there's a great drama being set and angels are standing over the skies watching you know what our drama is the actors are ready you can see him acting you can see the evil one acting you can see the villain of the plane heist come on the scene with his cunningness to deceive but you can also see the raptured church making herself ready it's a great scene you can see the presence of god vindicating and making the great drama that's foretold here in this bible to act itself out what a time to live the most glorious time the man of all ages is long for this time the prophets of old long to see this hour but wasn't privileged now there was a believer because he seen it he believe it we're fully persuaded that our the christ the messiah the word of god for this day and we believe that that was a real believer let's just take up a few more believers right quick before we go to the next character let's take the prophet noah when he being maybe a farmer perhaps he wasn't them these a farmer but when the scoffers and religionists of that day the church got to a low end and god spoke to noah and told noah that he was to build an ark no one never debated that with god he believed it it was the word of god and went to work right quick making things ready that's a real believer don't fuss about it when you're thoroughly convinced that's it just like anyone any faith anyway faith cometh by hearing if you can stand here no matter what the doctor says is wrong with you which the man gives you the diagnosis of the cases and probably knows just what he's talking about as far as his instruments and knowledge will permit him to know but he says there's nothing left but death but you pray and standing on her in the future you can see a well-mannered woman standing there that's it that's just it you'll walk right into that it's as certain as anything because you believe it god has spoken you know it's so like the little woman coughing up the cancer see there's no doubt in her mind that's going to happen the cancer was dead and it turned loose in the way it went see that's it you believe it like that father brought his little boy a while ago in there and he shared a building somewhere now the little boy had a phone and lost his memory he couldn't remember anything justin a few moments after prayer i asked him his name he told me how old he was there he was just as normal as anybody could be see they believe and when god says anything it must be that way and noah believed god and noah was considered a believer amen daniel when the church was in captivity down in babylon daniel believed god and no matter how much they said we make a proclamation that i've prayed another god but this image out there of this holy man or whatever it might be daniel didn't pay any attention to that he had heard god for he was the prophet and the word came to him and when the temple was dedicated it was said if any man is in trouble in any country look this way towards the holy place and pray then hear from heaven and daniel believed god he was a genuine believer and even the lions couldn't eat him see he was a believer he had something real and genuine he was a believer david another believer a little off-scale of a boy daniel didn't take the place with the modern church neither did noah take the place with the modern church not at all they was believers in what god said to be the truth no matter what the modern world said they believed what god said was the truth that's genuine believers just same as peter did and the apostles they believe that he had the word of life and was the word of life i believe the same thing today and every other thing against it is contrary it's not it's death this alone is the word of life and christ is the word now david a ready fellow the first place he was probably picked on by his brothers because he's a little felon he wasn't big enough to bear an armor he couldn't go to war and he was too little and scrawny and yet he got out there as a believer and as he set back on the desert watching a a few dozen sheep that his father had given him to watch over with a sling shot in a country where there's lines and bears and wolves and so forth david began to look upon the shady green pastures and know what it meant to sheep to get down in that shade and lay down in the heat of the sun no what a good cold drink of water man as he said as a heart thirst after water broke my soul thirst after the old god he had cried prayed and one day the emergency arose a lion grabbed one of his sheep and took off he thought the god that made me superior to the lion see and he took the slingshot and knocked the line down with a little rock and the slingshot now if anybody ever seen a line one of them african lines big woolly necklines that they have their palestine agent didn't know what one of them fellas was when a great big 300 magnum harley knocking down and he knocked him down with a rock and when the lion rose up at you he grabbed him by the beard and killed him that's the reason he knowed what he was talking about it had an experience it put god to the test amen about his word and he he wasn't afraid of god because he was uncircumcised he wasn't a believer at all and when god come out and cursed him in the name of his gods and leglot many times a larger and he was great big fellow 14 inch fingers on him now the fingers would be that long see 14 inch fingers a wire and probably the coat of nail that he had on he probably weighed 300 pounds or more see that he had on him a helmet and a great probably the metal inch and a half thick a great big giant like that walking with a with a weaver's needle which is claimed to be around 20 feet you have 20 foot spear in his hand how how could anyone a man like i could just stand and pick up a dozen man and throw him like that is he come up what an opposition and they were standing there boasting himself bragging one of the seems like the odds is down you see he said that don't have no bloodshed said let some man come fight me and then if i win then you ought to serve me and then if if you win that we'll serve you see when the devil thinks he's got the odds on you see that's when he likes to make his brain but he missed the wrong man he met the littlest man in the country amen little stoop shoulder ruddy looking fella he said do you mean to tell me that you the army of the living god will stand there and let that uncircumcised philistine defy the army of the living god why he was shocked at it why why he was a believer the others were make believers see he was a genuine believer he said if you're afraid i'll go fight me what a challenge for a little guy like that and so he was a believer and he done just exactly what he know that god would do he's when that uncircumcised philistine cursed him in the name of his gods he said am i a dog a little bitty run of a kid come out like that why said i'll pick you up on the end of my spirit and i'll hang you up there in the tree and let the birds pick your flesh oh my oh what a horrible fellow he will david said you meet me with a sword and a spear with an armor you meet me in the name of the philistine but i meet you without a sword or spirit armor but i'll meet you in the name of the lord god of israel that's a believer that's his fortress that's his shield that's his defense amen that should be the church's defense any believer that's his defense no matter what takes place what the world says anything else your defense is the lord god of israel that's it the name of jesus christ is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe left our defense of jesus christ notice and when it comes to pass we know what happened david nowhere to hit with that one little place when he dropped down his is uh his cover over his face one place to hit was right here in his forehead and before he could get with any distance to the the giant god directed the killing mark and he slew the giant see god did it now we notice he was a believer now another believer was abraham and he was of this a child ian of the city of era and he was called upon to do something that was and believe something that was totally physically impossible but he didn't stagger at the promise of god through unbelief says romans 4 but was strong giving praise to god when abraham was 75 years old and his wife's 65 years old and had been living together since they were young boys this is half sister a young boy and a young girl and that was they lived together without any children at all and god told abraham separate yourself from the unbelievers god always calls from separation amen separate yourself from the unbelievers and walk with me and i have made you a father of many nations i've already done it and abraham believed it that's a believer how are you going to do it lord he never asked the question god said he'd do it and that settled it won the first month passed and sarah was still just past menopause anything different not a thing but abraham still believed it 25 years later there was still no difference but abraham still believes it amen that's a believer that's a believer 25 years later abraham was stronger than he was at the first place he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness because he be that's a genuine believer now after a while i'm going to let you search and see what class you're in now what did abraham do stagger not at the promise of god the impossibilities what would a man 75 years old with a 65 year old wife do if they went to a doctor and said we want to make arrangements a hospital we're going to have a baby and then 25 years later said doc you still own a hospital open it makes you act funny your decisions are odd to the world but it's a believer no matter how strange it seems the bible said that he is fully persuaded that god was able to perform what he said he'd do that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon god's able to keep every word that he said he do i don't care what the denomination says words days of miracles his past and all this is telepathy and all those fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say i still believe that that gun is zeroed to the target it'll hit the target i believe if a believer is zero with the word of god it'll hit the same thing as the word of god ever promised it it'll do it again i'm fully persuaded of that that when we see we're in this age when it's supposed to be here right it's supposed to be here these things are supposed to take place that's the reason i do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride they'll take her from the earth all right don't care how many sides how many astronauts they signed up and everything else and how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there's a literal jesus christ there that'll come in the body foreign god said i'm the lord he is all thy diseases i am god and i change not amen and god is word and if god don't change how's the word go to change i am god and i choose not scripture says that god said it himself and if he cannot change and he is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the unchangeable word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us yes sir god raised up bodies all down through moses and ezekiel and jeremiah isaiah and elijah's all down words were temporarily come but the full word was made manifest in this man jesus christ which he was god in the god in the fullness of the godhead bodily amen there he was made flesh i believe that every word amen job another believer sometimes believers put to the test not sometimes every time amen but every son that cometh to god must be chasing child trained remember the trials the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats that material until she's ready to go into the mood god's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of god living through them see the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand see tested tried every son to come up to god amen job went through the trials in the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members come accusing me of a secret center and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met god's requirements he know there's no need of satan trying to tempt him that's right he thought it was a devil and as long as satan could make him believe that his sickness was his god doing it he had job whipped but when job once struck that revelation that it was not god amen he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't god doing it with satan doing it same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things you're god trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so no sir it's satan doing that god permitting it to temper you to make you see if you're you're tied to this earth by the earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for wherever your treasures is there you are also your heart is where your treasures are job tried yet he said i know my redeemer liveth at the last days you'll stand up on the earth though after my skin worms destroys my body did you notice the skin worms is already in it your skin worms is in you you're in a sealed up casket without any air in there anyhow but the skin worms are already there they're right in you and they're ready to be called to duty any time remember caesar he can't get right in the street the skin worms eat him up right in the street his own skin worms they're right there ready go after my skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god amen you cannot annihilate it all the skin worms eat it up it still will come back again amen rabbi shall see for myself mine i shall be holding not another he said it job why he was a believer trials he was a believer persecution he was a believer he was a genuine believer joseph another believer he couldn't help being what he was he's a prophet god made him a prophet he didn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different god made him what he is nobody else could take his place nobody can take your place no matter how little you say i miss the housewife nobody can take your place god in this great economy has so set your the body of christ in order till there's no one can take your place i would like to take billy graham's place any of us ministers but we can't do it but just remember billy can't take our place we all have a place some observances some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some housewives some mechanics some farmers whatever it is god has set you in your place see joseph was a prophet he couldn't help because he could interpret dreams he couldn't help because that he saw visions watch how tree was no matter if it cost him his fellowship with his brothers he was true because he believed those dreams he believed that the dream that he had that that all bowed to him the sheaves would it come to pass because he believed it he was a genuine believer how i got five minutes and 10 pages notice no notice of scripture wrote out here the woman nathanael he was a believer is that right nathaniel when he saw what took place and it worked on him that jesus told him who he was and said he was a an israelite indeed and there was no gal in him and told him where he was the day before praying under a tree he saw him and when philip called him he was a believer there's many stand there said this is the devil's spirit the devil does divine healing that old devil hasn't died yet today they believe that the devil does divine healing jesus said if satan can cast out satan then his kingdom's divided and our kingdom can't stand i think satan said it he can't do it so satan cannot cast out satan so nathanael was a believer and when he seen the word made flesh vindicated that he was a believer he said the heart a rabbi the art the christ art the king of israel he believed it when the woman at the well saw it she believed it she is a believer when blind bartimaeus when a woman combined everybody's crying going on some i'm saying there's a hole i hear you raise the dead there's a graveyard full of them up here come up raise them let us see you do it see that same devil that said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be turned to bread same one put a rag around his face hit him on the head said pass the stick one to the other so now if you tell us you hit you we'll believe you them soldiers i think making fun of you it looked like the card chip was down on him but just remember god's always on the scene he's right there already at any time now jesus said i could speak to my father straight when he'd send me 12 legions of angels oh wha one angel do but you see but he just sent 12 legions just in his command but he had a job to do he had something to do he had to go through that you've got something to do god's got something for you to do you may have some heartaches and some troubles you may have some disappointments but do we pray to shun them no lord take me through them whatever it is whatever it is don't let me escape them if they're set for me just give me grace to go through that that's all now i noticed blind bartimaeus he knew that they was told this is that prophet of jai galilee he's the son of david we believe it some of the believers must have told him that we believers know that he is the uh that son of david and he knew if he was he was the word if he knowed he was the word he know he could discern the thoughts of the heart so he cried thou son of david have mercy on me the unbelievers is hollering this and that the church members that didn't stop blind barnabas at all he said oh uh jesus thou son of david have mercy upon me perhaps he couldn't hear him but he know he was crying and he stopped and turned around there was a believer he said thy faith has saved him amen he said that to the woman with the blood issue the same thing thy faith cause she said within her heart if i can touch his garment i'll be made well thy faith has saved me see she was a believer that's the same thing as saved william dao sitting there the other day with a complete heart failure and a heart attack a man 91 years old the faith of savior why is the believer reverend tom kid here you're going into his nearly i guess wait around 90 years now oh close to it and when he was uh 79 years old they took him to the hospital with a cancer on the prostrate the doctor says he hasn't got a chance but when we walked in that morning seen that little patriarch with a shawl over his shoulders sitting there beating a little cane is almost beside himself he said to an old woman sitting there called her grandmother notor one of these members for years said you look as white as snow beyond this mental thinking yet when the power of god struck the room he's alive tonight that's been four years ago a man nearly 80 years old and here he sits tonight perfectly sounding well from the cancer not a make believer a believer that's it believe he takes god at his word just the same as blind bartimaeus was blind but yet he noted he could attract the attention of jesus christ he'd get what he wanted the woman noticed she could touch his garment she'd get what he wanted she'd get what she wanted tom knew he had faith if i pray for him he'd get what he wanted and that's the same faith that martha said even though lord whatever you ask god god will do it for you my brothers laying on the dead four days in the grave but you just ask god and god will do it for you he said thy brother shall rise again and she said yes lord in the last days at the resurrection he arises a good boy said but i am that resurrection alive amen amen that's it it's over yes sir the queen of the south come up in that generation of unbelievers that's right and stood there and believed what she saw to be of god the bible said she raised up from the last day with that generation and condemned it because she came from the utmost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of solomon moses was a believer though he tried intellectually he tried every scheme he could but it wouldn't work he tried to take israel out knowing he was called to do it he tried the mathematical way he tried the military where he tried the educational way he tried every way but it wouldn't work but then he took god's way what happened there's a fire on a bush up there one day they wouldn't leave from there the word spoke to him said i am not i was or i will be i am and he is still the eye of him he is the word the eternal everlasting word moses did not doubt the difficulties against him every nature against him everything against him by the crooked stick in his hand he went down and took over the whole nation drowned it in the dead sea out there took israel to the promised land why he believed god but he had a that's the believer we could say i've stayed by half our on the believers got two more classes we'll hurry through them because they're not important anyhow then secondly there comes now the unbeliever let's speak of the unbeliever next what does the unbeliever do we see the believer what accepts the word errors every generation for all the way from noah all the way up we could take six months of revival right on that right there bringing up the characters they believe the believer don't question the believer believes it regardless of what it sounds like or what anybody else has got to say about it how impossible it seems to be the believer believes it please want the word not to creed the word not the denomination the word not what somebody else says what the word says i remember that is the believer the believer doesn't question the believer doesn't say how can it be if i can get explained that's the unbeliever it's a believer that no matter what it is if it's a word it's the word that's true that's the believer now the unbeliever now we see what's take the unbelievers we find out that they did all right as long as they get padded on the back and call disciples as long as they everything went fine they were all right but when this prophet that they believed to be a prophet and no was that could heal the sick and so forth what did he do when the real truth and the rebuke came contrary to what they believed they couldn't take the word that's right amen they could take the miracles and they performed them they would not cast out devils preach the word and still amen unbelievers 10 he sent them out two by two the seventy and they cast out devils in so much that jesus rejoiced and said i've seen satan falling like light from heaven see they cast out devils judas right with them here comes the unbelievers but as soon as jesus began to say that he was something that he was the resurrection he was alive what would you say if you seen the son of man ascend up from where he come from now this man trying to say he come from heaven that's too much for us we can't believe it he said what is it the flesh that you're talking about prophet nothing it's a spirit that quickens yes [Applause] it's a spirit not the creed the spirit of a holy ghost quickens the word to you it becomes alive and there you are you see it by faith you see it you know it's so because the word said so and the spirit quickens the word to you there you are now i said what and as soon as we did this we find out the unbelievers when you say something that they don't agree with they walk out on him i just want oh that's getting so dense in the world today start and you'll say something they'll gather in i notice that meetings they'll gather in great crowds and you stand up start saying something nice long they'll sit there just watching just waiting and as soon as you say now jesus christ uh identified himself as messiah because that he was a prophet that jug's done for the way it goes somebody the way they go what is it unbelievers how you say you're making that up i'm not i'm saying just exactly what the bible says here they were unbelievers and they walked out though they were disciples but it was contrary to what they said this who could believe a thing like that there's pharisees and sadducees that come out jordan went in with him because see when the when the supernatural is displayed it produces three different types it did down in egypt it produced the unbeliever the believer and make believer it did all three classes this throw down here until we just go on and on through the night explain it how it is everywhere you find you see them three always that way see you find them now watch these 70 they walked out because it didn't agree with what they believed to be right we haven't got no thought coming it's what he said you deny your own thinking you just say what he says that's really confession confession means to say the same thing if i confess that a certain thing takes place i say the same thing they're taking place that's what real confession is and he's the high priest of our confession saying the same thing god said see that makes it right because you're just repeating god's word now i notice the seventy walked out what did they do and they they went out just because they if they disagreed their their wisdom their church affiliation had was was too much that was too much for them to think that this man standing here that the all the rest of people believed that that was illegitimate barn he had no rights to call himself god and he was just a man said we don't stone you for a good work you do but we stone you because you being a man make yourself god and the word said he was god his name shall be called counselor prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father the very scriptures that they read the very day that they were singing the psalm the 22nd psalm my god my god why is that forsaking me all my bones they stare at me not one bone shall be broken the very song that they were repeating in the temple they hung the sacrifice screaming the very words that david said 800 years before and was too blind to see it and today the very god that spoke of this age is on the scene doing exactly what he said he would do and they're too blind to see it that's unbelievers they'll walk out so i can't do stuff like that i've never heard of that in my life don't make hinders watch you here the bible said it would be here it says word they never heard of that either but it was there just the same that's right they were unbelievers just like eve was she was very religious of course so but she she did not believe the true word and she had to make herself a religion so she made some fig leaves see but it wouldn't work religion means a covering the same thing kane couldn't believe that that was right he said god is holy god is pure and god is beautiful so i will get me some flowers and i'll take the the flowers and i'll make a fine great altar and i'll i'll show my reverence to him i'll get up before it now bow down before him and worship that god and i'll put flowers on the altar because you know my father and mother eat some apples some fruit in the garden of eden and that's the thing that brought me out and so that's i will go back because i'll make it beautiful god just can't turn my big cathedral down well i'll beat you bigger a cathedral i'll make it so pretty so it'll attract god's attention satan's the one who dwells in beauty amen that's exactly what the scripture says that's right that's the reason sometimes a pretty woman is a bait for satan if he just get a hold of her he can twist more man into hell he could with all the bar rooms in the country or handsome some great handsome man that wouldn't stand up at his trueness of manhood see again he could swing that women to the devil and just sent him to hell yes sir notice satan dwells in beauty what did he try to do in the beginning make a more beautiful kingdom than michael's was moved over in the north and took two-thirds of the angels with see who's whose son that was and that nature any satan's son certainly was now he built the altar and he knelt down and he worshipped he went through everything that came and enabled him but abel knew that it wasn't that he was blood that took him out he knew that that was it it was the sex blood so he took a little animal and offered it up on a rock and chop his neck notice kane he god told him he said why don't you worship like your brother and you'll do all right you'll do well if you'll do that but know he know too much about it he rejected the original um vindicated word if that ain't his children today see now look god had testified the bible said hebrews the 4th chapter or the 11th chapter god testifying of his gift that he was righteous god vindicated his offering god made proof that that was what he accepted that was his word his plan and told cain said do the same thing and live but do you think he'd he would forfeit his idea no sir he was an unbeliever he walked right out that's right cain did the same thing nimrod did the same thing unbelievers he did not believe built a seizure the same thing though our nebuchadnezzar though having a daniel as his god called him delta seizure which was the name of his god saw daniel do the great works of god and then he knowed it built a seizure belief or that daniel was a god so he made an image to him and put it up out there and made everybody to worship it and so forth see the gentile came to come in with forcing of the worship of the image of a holy man and the gentile kingdom goes out with the forcing of the image of a holy man same way and there was a handwriting on the wall of unknown tongues at the beginning of the gentile kingdom that no one could read by that prophet and there's a handwriting on the wall today that's right ichabod that the glory of god has departed from them things and the handwriting's on the wall he'll be read by the spiritual mind amen that believes in spiritual things he's been born of the spirit of god old belted caesar goes out and gets these uh vessels of the lord to drink wine and why he was an unbeliever he thought he was a believer but he was an unbeliever see that's it he disbelieved the word ahab he was an unbeliever though he he he act like he wasn't no no he was amongst the believers but he was an unbeliever what did he do he married an idolatrous and brought idolatry right into israel he was an unbeliever we know that they deny the whole of the word of god to be true the unbeliever is you know remember he's a hypocrite and he he acts like that he says he believes it but he denies it he said well so much of it is well but if all of it isn't right then that makes him an unbeliever you've got to believe every tittle and every shot and everything that's said in there it's got to be true if it isn't true if you say no i don't believe that well then you're an unbeliever amen as a guy said to me one time a minister said i don't care mr branham how many people you could produce that that you said was healed i wouldn't believe it i said certainly not you can't believe it you're an unbeliever it wasn't for you it's only for the believers you've got to believe it see and they do not believe it so when you see a person that well did paul speak of the prophet saying that to be heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having forms of godliness but denying the power of the power of the word from such turn away notice they deny the holy word but in every form very religious they are unbelievers in the true word though it be vindicated all through every age god vindicated the word of these people i've talked about noah on down to moses and all the prophets and forth god spoke to the supernatural and vindicated the word and yet those people walked right out on it here's these disciples standing there them 70 and watching jesus do the things that he didn't know the scripture him telling him that that was the age that this was to take place and then when he said something the son of man what would you say when he began to tell him about breaking the bread and so forth and when i had to tell him about great spiritual things and they said oh this is a hard saying he said what are you going to say then if the son of man you see him ascend up into heaven where he come from said is it the flesh or is it the spirit that quickened see and then they moved away saw that i can't believe that see they walk right out on the word they won't even stay to see what takes place that is the that is the unbeliever they what do they do then we find out that they that these people these uh believers as so-called believers but in forms of religion and they fail to see the identified truth of the word of god because it's against what they believe see don't make any difference what you believe how loyal you are how religious you are and that doesn't have one thing to do to it sincerity well that don't have nothing to do with it i've seen people so sincere i seen the heathens burn their children feed them to the crocodiles mothers with their babies that's more than a christian to do sincerely they believe sincerely but for sincerely wrong people say well this church is you're sincerely wrong if it's contrary to the word well i look i don't believe in such thing well the bible said it was so old i don't believe it we have to do this i don't care what you think you don't have to do god said it must be done these signs shall follow them how far to all the world who to every creature it shall be all right i shall be it's gonna be in this message of the hour that we're now enjoying the presence of god the latter day the evening time when the lights are shining and the things has been opened up and the word vindicated and proved to be the truth both prophesied comes to pass all through scientific and everything proves that it is jesus christ the same yesterday and forever and a man walked out on that he's he's an unbeliever he's beyond hopes he's known by the power of satan so there's no hopes for him he's beyond hopes now that is what the believer now the unbeliever now the third class we're speaking about is the make believer that's the boy the big believer i remember in there stood all three now we find out they do just exactly like their father does judas that was peter and the rest of the apostles believers there was a 70 unbelievers and there was judas hung right on he was a make-believer what do they do this is a kind uh holds on until they can find something of fault in it that's right they're looking every time to find a loophole see how it's done see if it's a trick if it's a gimmick they're waiting to be sold out they're looking for that the unbeliever he don't even wait around he's condemned it walked out the believer no matter what happens he believes it anyhow first word there's your three classes that's right the old unbeliever a walk out on the first thing it said he don't like about it brother he's going to show his colors right then he's an unbeliever paul said they went out from us because they wasn't of us in the beginning they started with us oh you did run well what energy they went out because it wasn't us when they see the word perfectly moving on well they want to get some kind of a gimmick they could work see but the real believers don't question nothing it's written in the word and they believe it and it's wrong that's it always it's written if it isn't written well you just stay away from no matter what happens it's got to be written see they see that written word they believe it and they see god moving in his word see the hour the message the time and they walk with it as it said this morning how old pilate must have walked the floor at night with his worried conscience trying to clean himself and he said my nobody called for the night so i i wash my hands all night and i still can't understand okay they're not clean i can never go to medium i've got blood up on my hands oh my don't never be guilty of that see it's on your hands the only one way you can get out that's accepted that's right become part of it that's what it was shed for now the make-believer hangs around and acts just as pious as he can but down in his heart he's trying to find what's what you how you do it oh if the country isn't full of that part of hypocrites that's a judas that's exactly hangs around becomes part of the group he was a treasure see he stands around he's always got his hand out for money you can tell that one thing he's always fishing for money and got his hand out for this and he is a make-believer he acts like a believer but down in his hearts remember he wasn't fooling jesus after the seventy left and the believers made their stand and he turned around to the believers he said there's still something in you for said i've chose twelve and one of these the devil jesus know from the beginning where he was the word he know the secret of the heart how hard it was stop a minute think deep long straight yes how hard it must have been on him walking right there and a man calling him brother note all the time that that was the deceiver that was going to try to upset him and sell him for 30 pieces of silver how hard he was to hold him his bosom and his friend walking longer even he said friend call judas his friend have not been with you all this time knowing in his heart and couldn't say it he know from the beginning who it was that would betray you there's that make-believer that's just waiting you're saying i said oh i believe this and i believe this i believe this but oh you know i heard somebody say so times up just long with ears a real believer don't hear nothing but the word that's all he watches the word he ain't looking for no loopholes he ain't looking for no gimmicks he believes god and that settles it and it just keeps going on see there's a believer the unbeliever fills up in a minute he can't stay to listen 10 minutes to the message he's got to get walk out it's against his creed and he just won't have more to do with it so he goes out and the make-believer hangs right on that judas that's a deceiver that's a that's a rascal if i have to say such a word judas he hangs around this is the time some kind of these make believers are very popular with the people that's right these make believers see some of them are mighty man educated doctors degree big pain everything some of them are great man shrewd just like sons of satan would be look how satan come right there and agree with every bit of that word he's just waiting to find that weak spot and eve to work it show his power to deceiver to betray her that was that was satan you're satan is in a form of judas in that age that was satan in the first age what was he agreeing with the word so just one little thing is trying to find a place where you get a weakness that's exactly what the judas finds right now he'll come right along with the meeting and watch right around until he can find that little spot that he oh there it is that's it oh that's the way it's done that's just exactly many of you remember up there that night when that man come out on a platform he thought that there was a mental telepathy reading the prayer cards and how he thought he had it right then brother he he was sure he had it you come around he belonged to a church that don't believe in and and these in the gospel the full gospel and he come up on the platform i was tired as fix and take me away that's at windsor ontario and there come right across me from uh the united states there right across from detroit at windsor the big auditorium and this man come up there the grace suit owner red tide intelligent looking man smart is attack you come to the platform and i walked up and i said well just let me have your hand i said i'm tired i've seen so many visions let me have your hand and i never noticed a man and he put his hand over on mine i said sir there's nothing wrong with you go ahead he said oh there he is too and i said let me see i said no sir there's not one sign not sir you're a healthy man he said go look at my prayer card i saw i don't care what you put on your prayer card i said i don't have nothing to do with the prayer card not thinking you see a tired wore out my but the grace of god and she was still there remember if he sends you it's his obligation to take care of you it ain't mine it's him he's saying it i'm just supposed to stand on what's true when moses throw his stick down and turn into a serpent and the magician's done the same thing what can moses do but stand there and wait for the grace of god that's all same thing he followed out the commandments and you know what happened don't you this man said well he said there is look at my prayer card i said well you might have had a lot of faith and might have done it i'm not thinking you see done not even paying attention then he unbuttons his coat and pushed out his chest he said there you are austin i thought what's going on here looked around he said there you are said see the gimmick that's your judas a religious man a preacher of a great denomination said there you are i had so much faith uh he's got so weak he can't read the telepathy see it don't come to you anymore and there he says not my faith was so great said i'll put that on the prayer card and i can't catch it you see said that's the gimmick i thought what's going on then the grace of god came down amen glory i said sir why has the devil put in your heart to try to deceive god a modern judas i said you are a church of christ excuse me those who don't said it you're a church of christ preacher you belong to the church of christ from over in the united states and that man sitting up there that blue suit on and your wife and his wife sitting there you sit at a table last night it had a green thing over it uh spread like this and you made up at this was telepathy and you were coming tonight that man raised up he said that's the honest truth god have mercy on me i said sir you put tb and cancer on that card and now you have it it's yours now he grabbed me by the pants leg he said i didn't i said i can't help you go right ahead that's up between you and god you wrote your doom right on your card and that got him that was all of it see make believers deceivers trying to find some fault with god in his word that's the judases that's the ones you see how judas come out see all that guy come out that's the way to make believers happen make believers all highly educated sometimes a great showdown comes between the word and their creed and when it does they sell out to their denomination just exactly like their forerunner did judas judas sold out to his denomination sold jesus the word to his denomination and betrayed jesus christ actually claimed to be a part of it ministers sometimes claiming to be servants of christ and when the word is thoroughly identified to be vindicated for that day that it is the message of the hour and they'll sell their for popularity to their denomination just exactly like judas did betrayed jesus to the pharisees and sadducees that spirit don't die so there that's amongst the believers make believers and unbelievers see that's just exact come right down and sold jesus for 30 pieces of silver and many man will do it today for a meal ticket for an extra hundred dollars a week hallelujah deny the god they're standing in the midst of them and bought their life and with the full word and they'll say all them days of miracles is pastor god don't need such a thing as that today see oh i believe in jesus christ the son of god hail mary and mother of god blessed art thou amongst women all these other things they're saying some of them said i believe in the apostles creed i believe in god the father almighty creator of heaven is there being the holy roman catholic church and all these things tell me one apostle ever had a creed like that if the apostles had one creed it's wrote in acts 2 38 and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if there's any creed to them that was it they had no creed it was a word that is true it still remains the same that's a prescription for the cure of the disease of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost repent be baptized for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but they sell out like judas that's the make-believer some of them are highly talented people and this make believer watch that guy that's the shrewd guy this little guy fills up quick and jumps up and runs out of every little phrase that he don't like you don't pay attention to him he's just an unbeliever to begin with but when you see this guy make believer hangs on see that's the judas that's him like great talents i'm going to call names here which i really shouldn't do it but i'm going to call them anyhow so what you'll know it like elvis presley red foley ernie ford pat boone elvis presley a pentecostal pat boone a church of christ red foley a deacon in the church of christ now i think ernest ford is a methodist and all those people are those talents smart i don't television if people say well aren't they religious they sing songs that don't mean one thing amen deceiving the world what do they get out of it judith's got 30 pieces of silver elvis a fleet of cadillacs and 100 or 250 million dollars or a million dollars on records and things like that pat boone and the rest of them i don't care what church they belong to and everything it's hypocrisy it's a make-believe it's a front that their life proves out that isn't right right then there are those with the talents that it's great organizers worldly wisdom they preach the gospel claim to smart man intellectuals listen a man that's trained in that field he is not a preacher he's a lecturer that's what's in trouble today we have lectures jesus never said go and train to do this is a go preach the gospel and these signs shall follow the preaching that's not to learn to make a lecture who can stand and just ma put them flowerly things in it make you feel like you're sitting right in the presence of an archangel that isn't it having forms of god in this thing that's a lecture not the holy spirit in action some little fellow would know his abcs but come down with the power of faith with the word and make the holy spirit do things that man knows nothing about tonight there you are great people yes sir then there are organizers they're prosperous successful smart and worldly wisdom just exactly like satan did to eve little helpless woman he came right to her and tried to sell her on the idea that she'd be wiser than what she was and that's what she's looking for instead of staying right what the word said he wanted to sell her on the idea she'd be wiser and she bought his product and they still do the same thing today the wisdom of this world is foolish to god yes sir uh sir oh my just the same thing that the pharisees sold out and did see with their wisdom if they know but but deny the whole word of god when it's properly been proven and it's been vindicated them they still try to find something and think it's a gimmick they're not settled in their mind they can't believe it you tell them anything and they're back again you tell them anything they're back again and they just you can't get soaked in you see and watch them they're watching for a time just a loophole that's all they want that's what if it hadn't been for the grace of god all my loopholes had been exposed if i had anything it's a grace of god because there's no loopholes in the word of god this straight gospel i've always said anybody if you see me teach or do anything it's not exactly what the word of god you come tell me here's the thing that covers the loopholes that you're trying to find just put your eyes on that you'll see no loopholes because there's no loopholes now remember judas thought he found one that fellow thought he found one many times they think they find it but it proves out that it's not that's some make believers hypocrites there are 95 on the word so is eve but 99 and 9 10 but is that one tenth that cause all death and sorrow that's the one thing that condemns the organization things because they don't take the whole word of god that's the make-believers we find has always been but deny the true vindicated word these are always in each generation we find a message to go along and also very religious now i'm fixing to close right now because it doesn't take another half hour jesus we find out that he has warned us against these last days and these kind of people that these be so much like the real thing that they would absolutely would deceive the very elected ones what is that that's the judases the the people that go so far up look they they even can cry shout claim to cast our devils everything and then turn back around and deny the word exactly they have a form of validness that that almost look at where judas came judah's spirit climbed into the gospel up to the place of pentecost but when he come to the time for his baptism in the name of jesus christ and these other things that goes with the baptism the holy ghost he walked out he showed his colors and that spirit can live in those denominations until it gets right to that truth that's right then she drops right back like the spirit that's on them that four run they're coming just as john 4 runs jesus coming now you say jesus said they'd be so close now elected that's the kind that has had their name on the book from the foundation of life that please a foundation world that believes all the word of life that's the elected i watch these people not say this with forever send respect with godly love if i don't um i i need to order call myself notice jesus said they would deceive the very elected now that wouldn't be methodist that wouldn't be baptist we know they're unbelievers to begin with but it's pentecostals organization that took into that denomination draw their lines without the word and draw the line and put their own organization and fenced out the word they would deceive the very elected so perfectly alive say they cry they shout they jump up and down they claim healing services so did judas and so did all the rest of them when they went out come back rejoicing and everything and even had their names written in the lamb's book of mine but remember the bride don't don't come up in that group she goes in the rapture at the judgment the judgment was set and the books were open the wicked and another book which is the book of life it was open and there was a bride there to judge it another book was open which is the book of life that's the sheep on one side and the goats on the other see the people have died back out never had the opportunity they'll be the ones to be separated but now notice receive the very elected watch that group that's that group that follows right along yes brother hallelujah yes glory to god and right down in your hearts you see what they're working for have you church wife to draw a crowd to bleed them with every bit of money they can get out of it you think i don't know that they might not think i know it but i know it jesus no one from the beginning who was deceiver but what did he do he just waited till that time that's what we must always do wait till that time don't move in yourself wait till that minute having a farm and go right along that's that deceiving group watch that deceiver that group there not the not the believer not the unbeliever but that make believer oh my what are they doing just weeding along until they think they can find something pulling every penny that they can out of the people they that pile it up in these great big organizations which are absolutely against and they know it that's why they know it don't make any watches say they've always warned their people before you come don't listen to it one man with the audacity to stand there and oh hi now just when brother kid was healed come out there on the platform he said now brother branham is a prophet no doubt at all when he's under the anointing but now i said when the anointing is off of him said don't you believe he's teaching because it's wrong and he didn't know it's set in my room the lord revealed it to me and i walked right down there many of his air i said why would a man say a thing like that when the word now see i never said i was a prophet he said it and the prophet the word prophet seer old test now the english version of prophet means a preacher but the old testament seer was a man who had the divine interpretation of the word and was proven by the word coming to him before seeing it was what in a man saying that a man be a prophet and then saying his teachings wrong a failing a money working scheme what is the hour's close at hand when that thing will be pulled out on the scene but that's the kind that that make-believer had you on the back call your brother just a judas but remember he knowed from the beginning he still knows remember all these listening to this tape too that's right you're in one of them classes that's exactly right now we're going to clouds every person is here present every person that listens to this tape and even though someday i have to leave this world these tapes will still live that's right and you're in one of these classes you've got to be in one of them exactly you can't escape it you're in one of these places that's right what identify yourself with a bible character that believed where you believed the word when it was a vindicated like i proved it tonight that it was a vindicated word always contrary to the popular belief if you should live in the days of noah let me say what side would you been on the church side or no aside the prophet see if you'd lived in the days of moses would you have believed moses message after being proven and vindicated by god but would you went with core and death unto them and said you're not the only holy man other people can do these things that you do too you have to be one and you are tonight oh would you be with daniel or with the church that was down there at nebuchadnezzar's party is given see would you been outside or will you been down to shindig the big thing that we're having would you have been with elijah that man standing on called an old crank a man lost his mind standing up on top of a hill head shining up there to the sun with a crooked stick in his hand the birds feeding some crank or would you bend the priest and all them down there with jezebel and the rest of them modern dressed women elijah stand up there rebuking him as hard as he could what part would you talk your wife to just think just picture yourself tonight in the days of jesus would you have been with this boy that had no credentials he had no denomination affiliations they said what school did you come from we don't have you on our record here how do you get this wisdom how did you ever learn if we didn't teach you these things what school did you come to are you methodist presbyterian or baptist he was none of it that's right he was the word that's exactly right brother the or would you tuck the side with the pharisees of the modern belief of the humble old priest that seemed to be so gentle and nice and the organization that stood up since the nazi council or since lutheran organizer what what group would you have been in would you bet them what group would you have been with would you stood with the word when you see it to vindicate it and proved to you it was a message of the day or would you have took the church stand now just picture yourself tonight would you have been there with the apostles when they seen jesus and all these mysterious things when he cried out preachers said you're a nest of snakes them honest old preachers studied that word said you're nothing but a den of thieves and you're you're full of dead man's bones you're nothing but a white wall use generation of vipers would you stood with a hot-headed fellow like that who stood there and rebuked and tore down and said which one of you can accuse me of sin if i do not what the father said they said don't listen that guy's got an evil spirit on him he's crazy he's mad he's he's got a spirit of the devil on him see now that how he does that he that's a fortune teller spirit him you tell what is he his mother had him before her and her husband was married yeah see what school did he come to we don't even have one record of ever going to grammar school and yet when he was 12 years old he stouted and confound the priest with the word of god what school did he come out of the school of above when you see the son of man descending up from where he come from that was his school but would you stick with the apostles to a man like that when the showdown come or would you actually walked off with the seven and said well we'll go on back to our church if that's the way you're going to teach saying you the son of man when after all who are you what are you a man like i am i ain't with you i'm trying to say you're something i've watched you have seen your weakness i've seen you cry i've seen you do this or the other i see you go in the wilderness with us and everything else like that now you're just a man and say you come down from heaven that's too much for me would you walk up with him or would you have walked out with a 70 or would you walked on with the apostles and cries when saint martin tried to hold the baptism in the name of jesus christ in the church when he still tried to hold to signs and wonders and things and the catholic church condemned the man and wouldn't even recognize him at all and cast him out would you took the place what the catholic creator would just do with saint martin when he refused to put up all these kind of images of dead people and worship him worship them images and so forth when he refused the dogmas it was added he said let the word be truth god vindicated him the great signs and wonders and what he foretold happened everything that he did he walked in the spirit of god and proved and one one of them priests or anything could do anything about it would you have took his sign and went with saint martin or would you went with a catholic creed now the word now the word of god or the church dogmas is before you can you take except what the dog was the church or do you take what the word says remember in all ages has been as it is right now there's always a proper belief among the people and it's always been at least a little bit contrary to the real word remember it's never been just to run out deny it oh no the antichrist don't deny the word certainly not he says he believes it but just not all of it the way it's wrote here see satan told eve he bleeded all but just that little bitty he told her they take us all over this little bit might be go to pool it might be something else you got to take it every bit just the way it is here amen just the way it said here my cause should do some first works over again but it's just what the word said this has been satan's trick since he worked at first on e just to disbelieve a little bit of the words and always uh separates these three classes of people the word separates these people and every age it's been that way every age that ever has been has been that way when god sent something on the scene that clearly identifies at his word then there are those that follow that claim to be believers and they are there are those that wouldn't turn back they believe the word as long as it's staying word they believe it but when it comes a little contrary oh my god identifies it for what they believe they say well i i don't know about that that's the unbeliever or do you follow along just to see each other you can get a chance say here you are a judas to stab somebody in the back like he did i know it would come out sooner or later there you are that's the make-believer every every bit of it we see it in the bible a little boy one time down here in kentucky raised way up in the mountains it had never been around where he was a looking glass he had a little piece tacked up on a tree but he had never seen himself he come here to louisville it was told to stay with his mother's sister and she lived in one of the nice homes the old-fashioned home and it went into the one of the uh bedrooms that had a a door that had a mare all up all the way up and down the door see and when the little fella started running through the house he stopped little johnny saw a little johnny and he scratched his head and little johnny in the mirror scratched his head he laughed a little johnny in the mirror laughed he jumped up and down little johnny jumped up and down in the mirror see he walked up real close he saw his little boy he could play with so i walked up directly pecked on the glass he'd carry on his parents was watching he said mama that's me now you look at this and which is you hey man hey which one of these little johnnies are you impersonating which ones you see you're one of them that's one of them one that would turn back the first flaw you found that you call the flaw test it with the word and see if it's right that's right if the word proves all things see prove all things for the word jesus said do so yes sir hold fast that what's good that's exactly what he said now look in the mirror of god's word in the other ages and see which group of these three that should be identified and i just think if you live in the days of noah if you live in the days of moses if you live in the days of jesus or one of them whatever it is just think what group you'd be identified with think of it tonight then you're present now just think now this is deep now and don't run over the top of it your present state right now proves to you what group you'd have been with back there now you're your own judges proves what you are forever minister what group would you have been with when jesus made that statement it's hard to believe what what actually had thoroughly been identified if he was the word and yet that statement you never heard of anything like that the son of man what would you say if he be ascends up into heaven where he come from and you said well i know where he was born that i know his papa know his mama and here he says he's going to send up where he come from that'd been a little too much for you wouldn't sir been just a little bit too much for you cut the stomach there maybe it's the same thing today then look in the glass of god's word and see where you stand amen oh deceiver of man you never do that look you're one of these classes in your present state right now the present state of mind that you hear in this visible audience and you that'll be in the invisible audience of this tape your present state of mind after listening to this state proves to you what class you're in it tells you exactly where you are whether you are a believer in the word and will stay with it whether you walked out or shut that tape off that tells what you do that's right you don't want to listen to it and shut us i don't want to listen that that's that unbelievable you won't stop to test it and see if it's truth or not see or just hanging around and trying to find some fault with it then you know where you are too it tells you god help us to believe it and stand on it and be loyal to it and obey the word for he is the world you believe in amen let us pray amen praise the lord three kinds of believers have you determined which one you are amen so are we the believers the make-believer the unbeliever which is amazing he said there are all three of them in aryan church you would think that maybe the unbeliever is outside but no he's part he's part of the group amen that god is not what man sees is what god sees amen so it's not me looking at you and say that that's a believer or that's a make-believer that's an unbeliever well what does god see amen we leave that with the lord by the grace of god and again he said now he said just think he said this is deep and don't run over the top of it your present state right now proves to you what group you have been with back there now is that you your you are your own judge proves what you are and he said look he said you're one of these classes and your present state right now the present state of mind that you that you hear in this visible audience and he said you that'll be in the invisible audience of this tape your present state of mind after listening to this tape proves to you he said what class you're in amen your present state of mind so god knows your present state of mind your attitude reaction to the word of god amen by the grace of god and trusting brother sisters just oh just a tape no no brother if you've got the holy ghost it's the it's the word amen it's not just the tape it's just not william bran i'm always just one of the sermons they recorded no no it's still the word of god and it's a challenge to our faith amen whether it's the message here trying to do god a service without it being god's will amen or the restoration of the bright tree all of it is challenging our faith amen to reveal who we are what we are amen so brother god challenging our faith concerning are we the believer are we a make believer are we a genuine believer amen god help us by the grace of god amen that we have determined through the hearing of the word today we have determined that we are believers amen not make believers and i trust not not a non-believer but again to make believers be a bigger hypocrite than than the unbeliever oh yes so we pray the grace of god that we are true genuine holy ghost believers amen that we believe the word of god we believe it is written we believe thus saith the lord and brother oh well we we're not this church we're not that church we're not this denomination or that denomination but again we got to understand by the grace of god that what god revealed and what those churches believed back there god's requiring us to believe amen to believe that believe that believe that plus plus plus plus until it comes down to the the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen praise the lord that we believe the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so do we believe the word that was made flesh all down through the ages amen the word that was made flesh even from genesis 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth amen because again there are those that don't believe this but they won't believe that they'll believe this but they'll question this oh i don't understand that i don't understand that well brother understand or not you still believe it when it comes to the word of god i believe believe us thou this that's the question brother and brother god's looking for the answer yea lord i believe but lord help thou might not believe amen help down my doubt lord if i if i'm not believing exactly the way you want me to believe help me lord then i'll just let go and let you have your way i'll let go and believe it is written thus saith the lord that i'll believe the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end and are all in between by the grace of god amen so grace again again as he said you're one of these classes amen and your present state and present state of mind that you are here in this visible audience that you you that'll be in the invisible audience of this state huh he's talking to us in the invisible audience of the tape he said your present state of mind after listening to this tape proves to you what class you are in amen brother especially after all those years which is about set well i guess it's almost 60 years i guess since he preached it this is he preached in 1963 this is 2022. now 23. so he's he's pre-set many years ago just think and he was he's talking to all those that were believing it all down through the ages all down through the years so i pray the grace of god that we are believers amen that we truly believe the word by the grace of god we believe the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth brother because the faith that the faith that we are looking for and the faith that god's required of us now what is what faith we do we need well we need as i've said before we need the faith that they had down through the ages but god required something of us that he didn't require of them god requires some of us that he he's not required of them and that's the rapture oh yeah so do we have the oh well i believe god and i i believe that i'm a sinner saved by grace and i i believe that that i'm healed and i'm and god does this god god's meeting my needs yes but are you believing for the rapture god gave gave them the faith you know in luther's age to believe justification and on down to sanctification he gave the pentecostals the faith the word they believed for the gift of the spirit and and and the anointing and of the baptism of the holy ghost but now god's asking us to believe that plus oh yeah well yeah god still required of us what he gave in all other ages because now it's the end now we're finished amen and god now now we're come down to the elf the omega of the plan and purpose of god amen not oh yeah i believe the alpha and i believe luther i believe wesley and i believe what god did during the pentecostal age but now do we believe what god's doing in the bright age praise the lord because in the lutheran age they went forth believing what god had revealed and in the in the methodist age they went forth believing what god revealed pentecostals went forth believing what god revealed they don't believe it now like they did then no no but we believe the bride believes that plus now we believe what god has revealed in the opening of the word and this revealing the mysteries of god and what's oh well that's wonderful we believe that but again let's understand that it's revealed to give us faith that god wants us to have now and only that the faith that we need now so praise the lord god never required this of luther or wesley or the pentecostals but he is required of us now and that is for the rapture oh the rapture yeah the dead in christ shall rise first well they've gone down and they went down with that faith they'll come that faith will bring them back amen but now there's gonna be a living saints and remember again the prophet said god is waiting on us what for the rapture yeah and now that he said the dead in christ are waiting on us for the resurrection yeah because they're going to the prophets of the dead in christ are going to appear to the living saints and we're going to stay in the dimension with them and be changed and we're going to rise to meet the lord in the air we're going to be raptured praise the lord do we believe what god's doing and i'll tell you this when god came and did what he did for luther and wesley it changed them or they lived different lives they went out and and they acted different they preached different and so on amen their attitude was different their spirit was different their faith was different amen so brother the pentecostal is the same thing but brother god's required more of us than he than he did of the pentecostals more of us than he did of luther and wesley he required that plus that what yeah i believe i got that he justified me he sanctified me he has filled me with the holy ghost he has given me access to the gifts if if i need them and and so on but now he's he's given me the the revelation of the mystery of god genesis to revelation to show me that now i come to the the omega of god's plan and purpose now we come to the time of the resurrection and the rapture amen that's why the dead in christ are waiting on us because what god has done is to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen so the dead in christ the prophet said it's going to come forth and appear to the living saints but you've got to have that faith for them to do that amen and then we're going to be caught up to meet the lord in the air raptured hallelujah raptured praise the lord amen and we're going to spend that time with the lord and with the saints that are going on then we're going to come back and reign upon the earth by the grace of god oh yes amen i don't have the time to go into all of that right now but i could just show you this this this step that step that step next one next one you know we've done we've we took this step we took that step we took that step but now there's another two or three steps we're going to take to go to eternity by the grace of god amen god help us to keep pressing on not just to keep just oh yeah i believe you i believe you sent the prophet lord thank you i i i believe lord you you open the mysteries of the seven seals thank you lord and god lord said yeah you did what's it doing to you what are you doing with it see it's one thing for god to reveal it another thing for you what are you going to do with it you to respond to it oh yeah in your thoughts in your in your motives your objectives your actions your reactions now hallelujah if you really believe it really believe it's going to affect your life what you do how you do it amen we're going to work oh yeah brother i'll tell you this it went it went and changed luther it changed wesley it changed definitely changed the pentecostals around the world but when they went forth with the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit oh my praise the name of the lord well brother we got that now we got the faith for the rapture faith for the resurrection brother are we now becoming more and more conscious of the dead in christ that are right there the prophet said they're not oh yeah or they're out there in the cemeteries no they're not they're right here they're right here he said they're not 12 feet from you at any given time that includes there's theophanies and your theophany amen why because now and now that the closer we get to the resurrection the closer we get to the rapture amen of the revealed word the closer they get to us amen now are we becoming more and more conscious of the resurrection are becoming more conscious of the rapture oh brother i'll tell you this i tell you when when martin luther got that after all he did he practically almost he went around everywhere he felt that he had to do this do this to be justified oh yeah i got to do these works to be justified i got to do this image i got to make these sacrifices to be justified uh-huh until finally god revealed it in the word that your just shall live by faith why because jesus has justified him jesus sanctified him amen oh when that struck luther that's amazing and then john wesley he was in a cottage meeting of lutheran believers people that believed in luther and luther's message and so john wesley was in that college meeting and he was listening to the preacher preach and he was talking about justification the adjuster lived by faith and jesus justified us jesus did this jesus did that oh it struck john wesley and he said it struck him and he said the anointing went from the crown of his head he said down to the souls of his feet and he said he got the revelation that he was sanctified amen he didn't have to go do this he didn't have to do that jesus already did it jesus justified them jesus sanctified us amen and alleluia jesus is the eternal life the whole baptism of the holy ghost is christ in me the hope of glory hallelujah oh wonderful so we're moving on moving on moving on and brother the the pentecostals they believe justification they believe sanctification and 100 years ago they believed what god had done in the restoration of the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost now they said oh you know what they were looking for a hundred years ago that generation that got the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit oh my they said we believe we believe we're going to the resurrection this is going to take us to the rapture 100 years ago yeah they believe that oh yeah the old the old old old pentecostals a hundred years ago believed that god had justified him god has sanctified him and now the baptist the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit to take us on to the resurrection and rapture they believed that's what was in in in line the next time the moving of the spirit of god and so god sent the prophet with the opening of the word to give us the faith amen again revelation 10 brother look up by the grace of god amen when you see this when you see that look up amen if there's anything that that the opening of the word has done and is doing it's caused us to look up no no not the pentagon not not the methodists not the lutherans and and and this church and that and that revival that revival oh they were just going around doing all doing this doing that but i tell you now what god has done now it's not that we're going here and going there going there doing this doing it no look up because the hour of redemption has come the hour of the resurrection has come amen what god did in all the other ages got them ready to go and then they went by way of the grave but but what god is doing in this hour brother is getting us ready to go up the resurrection do we believe in the resurrection do we believe in the rapture this is what god god is requiring of us oh what he gave in other ages they believe that in the resurrection they believe that when we go when we die oh that's all right we're going to we're going to be resurrected yeah luther believed that wesley believed it and the the old-fashioned salvation army them all believed this that both the resurrection amen and the pentecostals but the pentecostal we're looking on to the rapture by the grace of god to be cut off god help us let's believe what god has done let's believe what god's revealed and brother god was working it out in in previous ages i pray gracie and work it out in you and me worked out justification sanctification the baptism and the gifts now the resurrection and the rapture amazing god required that that
