[41:49] Love
[41:52] to my
[41:55] love. I give
[41:58] unto you. Amen. Let's bow our
[42:02] heads. Lord
[42:04] Jesus. Lord, certainly this Christian
[42:06] walk is a walk of receiving.
[42:09] Lord, that we can bring nothing to it,
[42:12] Lord, except a willing heart and a
[42:14] surrendered
[42:15] mind, Lord, but the filling, the giving,
[42:18] it's all of
[42:20] you, Lord, as we walk through
[42:23] this life that you've given
[42:26] us, Lord. We pray you just help us day
[42:29] by day to reflect the very things you've
[42:32] given us, Lord. that you give us victory
[42:35] over self, Lord. Victory over the flesh,
[42:38] Lord. Victory over things that rise up,
[42:41] Lord. Victory even over our own rights
[42:43] and
[42:44] ideas. Lord, I pray you give us liberty
[42:46] this morning, Lord, by your spirit,
[42:49] Lord, as we hear your word, Lord, as we
[42:50] dwell on the things you've given
[42:52] us, Lord. That you would have your
[42:54] perfect way in our lives, each and every
[42:56] one, Lord. That we walk out this morning
[42:59] more free than we've ever been, Lord.
[43:02] more free by surrender to you, Lord.
[43:04] Trusting you, that you're leading and
[43:06] guiding us day by day, heavenly father.
[43:08] Lord, that as we've sought you, Lord,
[43:10] you would, Lord, you said that if we
[43:12] seek, we would find. If we knock, it'll
[43:14] be opened unto us. Lord, we're seeking
[43:17] this morning. We're knocking this
[43:18] morning, Lord. We're looking for
[43:19] answers, Lord. We're looking for
[43:21] liberty. We're looking for deliverance.
[43:23] We're looking for healing. We're looking
[43:24] for provision, Lord. Lord, you are the
[43:27] source, Lord, of everything that we have
[43:29] need of, Lord. And so we're coming to
[43:31] you this morning, Lord, by faith,
[43:33] trusting you to minister to your bride
[43:35] this morning, Lord God. Speak to us,
[43:38] Lord, we ask. Lord, bless this service
[43:40] now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[43:42] ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you, each
[43:46] one. Good to see each one here.
[43:48] Certainly, I've been enjoying the
[43:49] sunshine the last few days. It's a
[43:51] welcome break. Hopefully, it means that
[43:53] good things are on the way. Amen. Good
[43:55] to see the Grants have survived another
[43:57] hard week. Amen. Brother Garfield,
[43:59] Sister Nikki, good to see she's feeling
[44:00] better. Brother Garfield's come through
[44:02] at least a portion of his heavy studies.
[44:05] I I certainly I I don't have nightmares
[44:08] about it because I don't think about it.
[44:09] It's so long in the past, but I
[44:11] certainly don't have fond memories of
[44:12] school and doing engineering. And he's
[44:14] doing basically the same thing. So,
[44:16] God's grace to them. Remember them as
[44:18] they continue to look for a house as
[44:19] well that God would lead them and guide
[44:21] them. And then also a reminder that this
[44:23] week we have no service on Wednesday,
[44:26] but we do have a play practice for those
[44:27] that are in it at 6:30. And then we'll
[44:30] have our uh Easter Friday service at
[44:32] 6:00 p.m. And then Saturday we'll have
[44:35] the play at 5:30 followed by refreshment
[44:37] and then our regular service on Sunday
[44:40] as well. So keep those services in
[44:42] prayer. Keep Sister Priscilla and the
[44:44] whole group that's working together.
[44:45] It's definitely a team effort. I think
[44:47] threequarters of the church is here on
[44:48] pray play practice days. So just
[44:51] remember them that God would be in it,
[44:52] that he would be honored and blessed by
[44:54] these things. Amen. God bless you. John
[44:56] chapter 3 this morning. John chapter 3
[44:58] and verse 8. This is Jesus talking to
[45:00] Nicodemus now. And he remember he was
[45:02] talking to him about the new birth. And
[45:04] Nicodemus, he said, Nicodemus, you can't
[45:06] understand the kingdom of God, the
[45:07] kingdom of heaven unless you're born
[45:09] again. And he's talking about the coming
[45:11] of the Holy Spirit. And he says this,
[45:13] "The wind bloweth, where it listeth, and
[45:16] thou hearest the sound thereof, but
[45:18] cannot tell whence it cometh, and
[45:20] whether it goeth. So is everyone that is
[45:23] born of the spirit." He says, "Listen,
[45:24] the wind blows, and you can see the
[45:26] effect. You can hear it. You don't know
[45:27] where it's coming from. You don't know
[45:29] where it it's going. You don't know why
[45:31] it changed direction. It just does what
[45:32] it does." He says, "So is everyone. So
[45:34] is every person that is born of the
[45:36] spirit of God. You don't know where
[45:37] they're coming from. You don't know
[45:38] where they're going. You don't know why
[45:39] they're doing it. You can't understand
[45:41] it. All you know is there's something
[45:42] going on and it has an effect in their
[45:44] life. Amen. God bless you. You can have
[45:45] your seats. This morning we're going to
[45:47] continue this series. We've been
[45:48] preaching on the on the Holy Ghost, but
[45:50] certainly we want to
[45:52] um I've lost my clicker here. Brother
[45:54] Vichel, if you'll if you'll help me out
[45:56] this morning. Doesn't seem to be moving
[45:58] on me. But we're going to continue our
[46:00] series on the on the token uh the token
[46:04] life and we're going to continue this
[46:05] this series on the divided kingdom. And
[46:07] we've talked so much about the battle
[46:09] that we're facing in these bodies that
[46:10] we live in and the mind and the nature
[46:12] that comes with it. And then what
[46:14] happens when the Holy Spirit comes and
[46:15] it changes that nature and it changes
[46:18] that mind and these different things and
[46:19] it causes us to come into a battle. And
[46:21] we talked about a couple different
[46:23] battles in the last few services. We've
[46:25] talked about the battle of condemnation
[46:26] versus liberty where Paul said, you
[46:29] know, this this body of death, who's
[46:30] going to deliver me from it? And then he
[46:32] comes into Romans 8:1 and he says,
[46:33] "There's therefore now no condemnation
[46:35] to them that are in Christ." Amen. And
[46:37] so the difference was living your life
[46:39] by your works, which are never going to
[46:41] work out, by the way. Right? Living by
[46:43] works rather than coming into the
[46:44] liberty of those who have been covered
[46:46] by the blood of Jesus Christ that are
[46:48] living under the blood and filled with
[46:50] the spirit. And that is liberty. Liberty
[46:52] isn't doing what you want to do. Liberty
[46:54] is being set free from what you wanted
[46:57] to do and doing what God wants you to
[46:58] do. That's what liberty is because now
[47:00] your nature's changed. Now your desires
[47:02] have changed and now you're walking in
[47:04] what he wants you to do and that's
[47:05] freedom because that's going to lead you
[47:07] to a good place that's going to lead you
[47:08] into eternal life. But then the second
[47:10] thing we talked about was the carnal
[47:12] mind versus the mind of Christ. And the
[47:14] difference is that the carnal mind is
[47:16] controlled by your five inner senses,
[47:17] your five outer senses. Amen. And it's
[47:20] it's it's it's the logical mind. It's
[47:22] the reasonable mind. It's the intuitive
[47:24] mind. Amen. But that's that's got to be
[47:26] compared to that faithful obedience of
[47:28] the mind of Christ that seeks the will
[47:30] of God, that finds the will of God, and
[47:32] then that does the will of God. And
[47:34] there's a perfect rest
[47:36] there. Okay, we're good, brother Vichel.
[47:38] Thank you so much for that. So, we're
[47:39] going to continue in Romans 8 this
[47:41] morning. We're going to skip a portion
[47:42] here this morning because I want to save
[47:44] it for uh the Easter service by by God's
[47:47] will hopefully. But I want to want to
[47:49] focus on another element of this great
[47:51] battle this morning. And if we go to
[47:53] Romans 8 and in verse 10, we're going to
[47:55] pick up where we left off. And Paul
[47:56] says, "If Christ be in you, the body is
[47:59] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[48:02] life because of righteousness." Church,
[48:03] that means we've got to focus on what's
[48:05] alive, not what's dead. When something's
[48:07] dead, we don't go around and try and we
[48:09] don't try and resurrect it, do we? When
[48:11] somebody dies in the hospital, when they
[48:13] say that's it, they're dead. It's over
[48:15] with. The doctor signs off. They put a
[48:16] time there. They don't try and raise it
[48:18] up again. They don't go back the next
[48:19] day into the morg and say, "Let's see if
[48:21] we can get this person back to life."
[48:23] Paul's saying, "Your body's dead. Leave
[48:24] it dead." Amen. And that's a dayby-day
[48:27] fight to keep that body dead. Cuz it
[48:29] wants to resurrect. It wants to
[48:31] resurrect. This flesh wants to come back
[48:33] in the power. Amen. So don't give it
[48:35] another thought except to say, "I'm
[48:37] keeping you dead." Paul said, "I die
[48:39] daily." So that idea is that's one thing
[48:42] we have to do. Keep that flesh dead.
[48:44] Don't give any life to it. Don't give
[48:45] any thought to it. Don't give any time
[48:47] to it. Don't give consideration to his
[48:49] flesh. Say you're dead through Christ.
[48:51] Let's keep you dead. Right? We're not
[48:53] going to let it raise up. Amen. That's a
[48:55] work for us to do on a daily basis. He
[48:57] says, "But if the spirit of him that
[48:59] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[49:01] you, he that raised up Christ from the
[49:03] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[49:06] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[49:07] you." We're not going to preach on that
[49:09] this morning. It's a wonderful
[49:10] scripture. We'll save it for Easter. But
[49:12] he says, "Therefore, brethren, we are
[49:13] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[49:16] the flesh." In other words, we don't owe
[49:18] this flesh anything. This flesh has done
[49:20] nothing good for us. It's just a
[49:22] residence for us, but it has no power
[49:25] over us. It's not meant to take the
[49:27] preeminence in our lives. Amen. Does
[49:29] this flesh have needs? It has needs,
[49:32] doesn't it? But how do we decide how it
[49:34] has needs? How do how do we decide how
[49:36] we fulfill those needs? Does this body
[49:39] need a break occasionally? Does this
[49:42] body need food regularly? Does this body
[49:45] need rest? Does this body need a fun?
[49:49] Yes, it needs all these things. This
[49:50] body needs those things. Amen. But
[49:52] because it has a need doesn't mean we
[49:54] give it what it wants. It means by the
[49:56] spirit according to the word, we give it
[49:58] what is best for it. Amen. So the fact
[50:01] that it has needs doesn't mean that it
[50:02] dominates, but rather by the spirit-led
[50:05] believer in their life, they choose what
[50:08] that's what's going to meet that need.
[50:09] Because I'll tell you, there's two sides
[50:11] that are offering you something to meet
[50:12] that need. There's good clean fun and
[50:15] then there's worldly fun. There's good
[50:17] clean food and then there's not good
[50:19] clean food. All these things, for
[50:21] everything that there's a need, there is
[50:23] a source that can supply it. But it's
[50:25] the spirit-ledd believer that's going to
[50:26] choose the right thing day in and day
[50:28] out. Amen. He says, "For if we live
[50:30] after the flesh, we shall die. But if we
[50:33] through the
[50:34] spirit, not by personal will or
[50:38] discipline, by the spirit we mortify the
[50:41] deeds of the flesh, he says we do
[50:44] through the to mortify the deeds of the
[50:46] flesh, ye shall live. Mortify the deeds
[50:49] of the flesh. It means to put the the
[50:51] flesh to death. Paul said they those
[50:54] that are Christ have crucified the flesh
[50:57] with its affection with its uh
[50:59] affections and lusts. That's a dayby-day
[51:02] thing. We keep it away by what?
[51:05] Depriving it of what it needs, of what
[51:07] it wants, and we give it what it's
[51:09] supposed to have. And then he says this
[51:11] beautiful scripture, for as many as are
[51:13] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[51:15] sons of God. We could preach on verse 14
[51:17] for the rest of the year and never touch
[51:18] it. There's so much that's encapsulating
[51:21] this, but we're going to take just one
[51:22] service on this this morning. And as I
[51:25] was studying this, I think brother Bram
[51:27] takes this this phrase led by the
[51:30] spirit. I think he does it 150 something
[51:32] times. And if you look it up, 90% of
[51:35] those he goes back to the day that Jesus
[51:37] is being brought to the temple for his
[51:39] dedication. And he speaks of Anna the
[51:41] prophetus and Simeon the old man, the
[51:43] the priest that was there, remember? And
[51:45] he'd say, "See what the spirit does? It
[51:48] leads you to the manifested word."
[51:52] That's what the spirit does. See, it
[51:53] doesn't lead you to doctrine. It doesn't
[51:55] lead you to theology. Those are good.
[51:57] Those are part of the structure of the
[51:59] believer. But he says he's taking you to
[52:02] the reality when you are led by the
[52:04] spirit. It's because there's something
[52:06] waiting for you at the end of that
[52:07] leadership. Amen. It's not just to pull
[52:10] us around by the nose like a bull with a
[52:12] ring. No, there's something at the end
[52:14] of it that he has for you to take part
[52:16] of, for you to do something with. And
[52:18] it's for your good and it's for your
[52:20] betterment. And it'll make you a better
[52:22] believer. It'll make you a better
[52:23] Christian. It'll make you believe the
[52:25] word even more. Amen. He's taking you to
[52:28] something there. So for Simeon and Anna,
[52:30] it was Christ in flesh, his literal
[52:32] body, God in flesh. But for us, it is no
[52:35] different. It's taking us to Christ in
[52:37] flesh. But now it's not in one body.
[52:40] It's in a multimembered body. That's
[52:42] what the spirit is doing to the
[52:44] believer. Amen. It's bringing us to the
[52:46] manifested word. The spirit's here to
[52:48] lead us into the reality of the word.
[52:51] Not dead theology, not
[52:53] denominationalism, not churchity, not
[52:56] just to to do what mom and dad do, but
[52:58] it's leading us into the reality of
[53:00] Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's
[53:03] what the spirit of God is trying to do.
[53:04] Amen. Its purpose is to bring us into
[53:06] the reality of today. And that means
[53:08] it's a healing purpose. It's a
[53:10] resurrection purpose. It's a rapture
[53:11] purpose. It's a delivering purpose. It's
[53:14] a guiding purpose. It's a changing
[53:16] purpose. All of these things are wrapped
[53:18] up in the spirit of God. Amen. And so
[53:21] that's what it's trying to do is to
[53:22] bring us to the reality of the word that
[53:24] God has given us for our day. We read
[53:27] this this quote last service, but we
[53:29] read the second half. I'm going to read
[53:31] the first half this morning and then the
[53:33] second half again because we've got to
[53:34] get the first half before we can get the
[53:36] second half. And he says this. He says,
[53:39] "What kind of people would it be this
[53:41] morning if this tabernacle this morning
[53:43] was so filled with the presence of God?
[53:46] Why? when you didn't even use your own
[53:48] mind, didn't use your own thoughts,
[53:50] didn't have no ultimacy of your own, but
[53:53] just to be led by the spirit. He says,
[53:56] "And they that are sons of God are led
[53:58] by the spirit of God." He says, "Then
[54:01] when the human element goes
[54:03] out and the spirit of God fills that
[54:07] vacancy where you empty
[54:11] yourself." Okay? What's our job this
[54:13] morning, church? You empty yourself,
[54:16] brother Bob. I can't empty you. You've
[54:18] got to empty you. I've got to empty me.
[54:21] You've got to empty you. And then he's
[54:23] got to come behind and fill that. Amen.
[54:26] Where you empty yourself, he says. Amen.
[54:31] Then, oh, brother John, I want the power
[54:34] of God in my life. Okay, get the power
[54:36] of yourself out. Get the power of your
[54:38] own mind. Get the power of your own
[54:40] stinking thinking. Put it aside. Get
[54:42] your education out. Get your intuition
[54:44] out. Get your emotion out. Take it and
[54:47] put it aside and empty out and say,
[54:49] "God, fill me up." That's what it's
[54:51] going to take this morning. I've got to
[54:53] lay it down. I've got to put it aside
[54:55] and say, "God, I need you to take the
[54:58] place of what I just dumped out." And
[55:00] that's a personal choice, church. That's
[55:01] a personal choice this morning. I can
[55:04] preach it till I'm purple in the face,
[55:06] but you've got to empty out so that he
[55:08] can fill up. Brother John can't fill you
[55:11] up. Mommy and daddy can't fill you up. N
[55:13] and pop can't fill you up. The five-fold
[55:15] ministry can't fill you up. It's going
[55:17] to take the spirit of God stepping into
[55:19] your life to fill you up in a way
[55:21] that'll give you victory. He says when
[55:23] you empty yourself, Amen. then will be
[55:25] when the church in its power of the
[55:28] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[55:30] in his steps, in his power, in his
[55:33] thoughts, in his being, in his moving.
[55:36] He says then your thoughts will become
[55:38] words and words will become material. He
[55:41] says that's when the church is in its
[55:43] power. What? When the human element goes
[55:46] out, that's the hardest thing to do
[55:48] because it's what we're born with. It's
[55:50] what we've trained. It's what we've
[55:52] taught. It's what we've developed. It's
[55:54] what we've honed. And then he says, take
[55:56] it and throw it
[55:58] out. And what do most people say? No,
[56:01] thank
[56:02] you. I've done just fine. You may have
[56:05] done just fine. You know, there's a lot
[56:07] of people doing just fine, but just fine
[56:09] is not eternal life.
[56:11] It's not going to get you there. It's
[56:13] not going to get you there. See, the the
[56:15] Christian walk is not just about
[56:18] receiving. It's about giving up. It's
[56:21] about yielding. It's about surrendering.
[56:24] It's about emptying out. And that's a
[56:26] personal choice on a dayby-day basis.
[56:28] We're laying down so Christ can pick up.
[56:31] We're emptying out so he can pour in.
[56:34] And that's something we've got to do.
[56:36] Now, it's done by the spirit. Remember
[56:37] what we read? If you by the spirit do
[56:39] mortify the deeds of your flesh. Listen,
[56:42] sometimes we see something and we say,
[56:43] "Oh, well, they don't do that or that so
[56:45] and so thinks this way. I need to do
[56:47] that." If it's not spiritled, it's not
[56:48] going to have spirit
[56:50] fruit. You do it in his time. You do it
[56:53] in his time. You lay before the presence
[56:55] of God. You lay over his word and you
[56:57] say, "Lord, be it unto me according to
[56:59] your word." And as you open it up to me,
[57:01] I'm going to pour out so you can pour
[57:02] in. It's got to be led by him. and you
[57:05] say, "Lord, give me your wisdom and your
[57:07] power and your strength to replace my
[57:10] wisdom, my power, and my strength that I
[57:11] just threw away." That's what it's going
[57:13] to take. Amen. We don't just want to
[57:15] empty out, but we want to be filled up
[57:16] again. We don't want to be empty vessels
[57:19] just forever. Because remember what
[57:20] happens when the the scripture says that
[57:22] when that you have a spirit in you, you
[57:24] have a demon that goes out and you clean
[57:26] up your house, if you don't fill it with
[57:28] a strong man, they're going to come back
[57:29] with seven more. And the end result of
[57:31] that person is worse than the first. You
[57:33] need a filling, not just an empty note.
[57:36] Then once you do that, he says, I
[57:38] believe it's on a on the road that when
[57:40] the church will be so wrapped in Christ,
[57:42] the Holy Spirit, mankind so away from
[57:45] themselves that they don't see
[57:46] themselves. They don't have any motive
[57:48] but to serve God and their thoughts move
[57:51] on. He says they refuse the things of
[57:53] the world. They just move in the spirit.
[57:55] They live in the spirit. They move in
[57:57] the spirit. They walk in the spirit and
[57:59] so fulfill the law of Christ. He says,
[58:01] "Then the love of Christ in the human
[58:04] heart, moving in the Holy Ghost, that
[58:06] great wonderful church will go forth
[58:08] with power and deity because deity will
[58:11] be revealed in human beings by the Holy
[58:13] Spirit bringing to pass the thought of
[58:16] their
[58:17] mind." He's painting a picture and if
[58:19] you ever look it up, he talks a lot
[58:20] about a mainspring, a mainspring of a
[58:23] watch. And today, everybody's got an
[58:25] Apple Watch or a digital watch and so we
[58:26] don't understand the idea of a
[58:27] mainspring. But in the old mechanical
[58:29] watches in the center in the very bottom
[58:31] of that watch, they'd have a steel
[58:33] mechanical spring there and that was
[58:35] wound up and that's what gave motive
[58:37] power to that watch. And he says that's
[58:39] what it's like for the believer. You've
[58:40] got a mainspring. You've got something
[58:42] inside of you that's driving your life.
[58:45] And everything moves based on the power
[58:47] of the mainspring. If the main spring's
[58:50] not pushing, nothing moves. If the main
[58:53] spring's pushing, if it's got power in
[58:55] it, then what happens is everything's in
[58:57] its perfect order and it just moves
[58:59] according to the movement that's built
[59:01] into that watch. Now, all of us have
[59:03] different movements or we could say all
[59:05] of us are different parts of the watch.
[59:06] You look at a watch, some parts move a
[59:08] little bit. Some are moving constantly.
[59:10] Some only move once an hour. Some only
[59:12] move when a certain button's pressed
[59:14] because there's a certain thing that
[59:15] needs to be done. And then when that
[59:16] button stopped, what do they do? They go
[59:18] back to not moving for a while. It's all
[59:20] different pieces and all different
[59:21] parts.
[59:22] Amen. But catch this. That the watch
[59:25] does not control the mainspring. Okay?
[59:29] The Holy Spirit is not meant to be
[59:31] controlled. The Holy Spirit is meant to
[59:34] control. When we come into this service
[59:37] and and I was talking with the musicians
[59:38] this morning how much I appreciate that
[59:40] we we get together and we pray before
[59:42] the service because I said it reminds me
[59:43] we're in this
[59:44] together. Everybody's pulling.
[59:46] Everybody's got a part to do it. Amen.
[59:48] But as we look at these things, the
[59:50] worst thing that I can do when I come
[59:52] out of that room and come to this pulpit
[59:53] is come with a personal
[59:56] expectation of what's going to happen.
[59:59] Absolutely. If I come up here with
[1:00:01] intention that I'm going to get so and
[1:00:03] so to respond, somebody's going to
[1:00:05] dance, somebody's going to shout,
[1:00:07] somebody's going to cry, somebody's
[1:00:08] going to come to the altar, somebody's
[1:00:10] going to get convicted, you know what
[1:00:11] happens? The spirit of God goes right
[1:00:14] over
[1:00:15] there. Why? because I'm trying to
[1:00:17] control it rather than letting it
[1:00:20] control me. I've got to come here
[1:00:22] yielded so that I don't come out here
[1:00:24] swinging a big two-handled sword when
[1:00:26] God's trying to do a work that requires
[1:00:28] a scalpel. Amen. We don't need a yelling
[1:00:32] preacher every service. Sometimes we
[1:00:34] need somebody to come with the cold,
[1:00:37] hard truth of the scripture. And I don't
[1:00:39] mean that in a bad way where it just
[1:00:42] punches you between the eyes and you
[1:00:44] cannot resist it. It's not
[1:00:46] emotional. It's just God laying in the
[1:00:49] word in a calm manner so you can just
[1:00:51] sit there and let it flow over you.
[1:00:53] Sometimes we need a a preacher that's
[1:00:54] walking the aisles. We need that getting
[1:00:57] close to the people. I like it here. I'm
[1:00:59] very safe and secure back here. But you
[1:01:02] get Brother Dwayne Farah, he goes all
[1:01:03] the way to the back, doesn't he? You got
[1:01:05] some preachers, Brother Kai Digs, he
[1:01:07] likes to walk the aisles. We need that
[1:01:10] sometimes. is we need a preacher that's
[1:01:11] here and he's preaching only the
[1:01:13] supernatural cuz why? We need the
[1:01:15] supernatural. It's in the scriptures.
[1:01:17] But then we get a preacher comes and he
[1:01:19] preaches the practical. Why? Cuz that's
[1:01:21] in the scriptures, too. See, we don't
[1:01:23] tell the Holy Spirit what to do. He
[1:01:25] tells us what to do. That's the only way
[1:01:27] that it works. Amen. What am I looking
[1:01:29] to happen? I'm looking for my thoughts
[1:01:31] to move on so that his thoughts can flow
[1:01:34] over this pulpit. It has to be his
[1:01:36] message, church, not my message. It's
[1:01:38] got to be his anointing, not mine. It's
[1:01:40] got to be his thoughts, not mine. I want
[1:01:42] what he has for me way more than I want
[1:01:44] what I have for you. Amen. It's got to
[1:01:47] be him and it's got to be him alone.
[1:01:49] Brother B would say this. He says, "Did
[1:01:50] you ever know men that are led by the
[1:01:53] spirit of God can't understand their own
[1:01:55] self?" If you've ever been led by the
[1:01:57] spirit, you'll realize at some point it
[1:02:00] doesn't make sense.
[1:02:02] based on what you know, based on what
[1:02:04] you've experienced in life, based on
[1:02:05] your logic, your reason, your education,
[1:02:07] whatever it might be. He says they are
[1:02:09] driven by a force that sometimes they
[1:02:11] think, "Why did I ever do that?" But
[1:02:13] it's God working in them. Sons and
[1:02:15] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:02:18] of God. Remember, Brother Bam tells that
[1:02:20] story about he's on his plane or he's
[1:02:21] about to get on his plane and the spirit
[1:02:23] of God says, "Go and start walking." He
[1:02:25] says, "Lord, my plane's going to leave
[1:02:27] shortly." And he says, "No, something
[1:02:29] said you walk. Where am I going? What am
[1:02:31] I going to do? Just walk. Just walk.
[1:02:35] Makes no sense, church. He's got to
[1:02:37] catch a flight. And the spirit of God
[1:02:39] says, "Just walk." And so he's walking,
[1:02:40] walking, walking. Lord, what do you
[1:02:41] want? What do you want? Just keep
[1:02:43] walking. They says, "Turn here." And he
[1:02:45] walks down the street and he walks past
[1:02:47] the house and there's this colored woman
[1:02:49] and she's leaning on the picket fence
[1:02:51] and she says, "Howdy, person." And he
[1:02:53] says, "Howdy." And he keeps walking and
[1:02:55] then he stops and he says, "How did you
[1:02:57] know I was a preacher?" She said, "I was
[1:02:59] praying this morning that God would send
[1:03:00] me a preacher. My son's in here and he's
[1:03:03] laying sick. He had a veneerial disease
[1:03:05] of some sort. It was killing him." She
[1:03:06] says, "And I prayed." She said, "So when
[1:03:08] I saw you coming, I knew the Lord had
[1:03:10] sent me a person." So he said, "Well,
[1:03:12] Lord, I guess is this what you want me
[1:03:13] to do?" So he went in, he prayed for the
[1:03:15] man. The man was healed. He walked all
[1:03:18] the way back to his his aircraft and it
[1:03:20] had been held for maintenance and he
[1:03:21] walked on and they took off a few
[1:03:22] minutes later. What? Sons of God are led
[1:03:25] by the spirit of God. Makes no sense.
[1:03:27] Now, it made sense once he got through
[1:03:29] it. But that's not the time you got to
[1:03:31] wait, church. You got to go before you
[1:03:33] understand. As long as you're confident
[1:03:35] you're being led by the spirit. And I
[1:03:36] can't tell you how many times that's
[1:03:38] happened in my own ministry. Not walking
[1:03:39] down streets, but you come to the pulpit
[1:03:42] and then you go down a preaching rabbit
[1:03:44] hole. And you say, "Well, that was odd."
[1:03:47] And sometimes it is. Sometimes it's very
[1:03:49] jarring. I'll be honest, because you
[1:03:51] feel like you've got a thought and the
[1:03:53] Lord's given you a direction and all of
[1:03:54] a sudden you're going here. I remember
[1:03:56] Matt Watkins, brother Matt Watkins
[1:03:58] talking about he went to a a convention
[1:04:00] and he came up to the pulpit and somehow
[1:04:02] his notes I think he dropped them and
[1:04:04] they got all blended together and he
[1:04:05] couldn't find what he needed and he got
[1:04:07] all all flustered up there and he didn't
[1:04:09] know what to do and all of a sudden he
[1:04:11] he just started preaching on the value
[1:04:12] of a
[1:04:13] life. It made no sense what he was
[1:04:16] talking about. It had no ties to
[1:04:17] anything that he had preached that
[1:04:19] service which was a mess up to that
[1:04:21] point.
[1:04:22] Anyways, he says, "But after that was
[1:04:24] done," he said, "A sister came up to me
[1:04:26] for prayer at the end of that service
[1:04:28] and she said, "I was going to commit
[1:04:29] suicide after this
[1:04:31] service." So, what did God do? God
[1:04:34] flustered his preacher to touch her soul
[1:04:38] and save her life. That's what we're
[1:04:40] looking for. I remember when I preached
[1:04:41] in Edmonton last year, I didn't get off
[1:04:43] the first page and we were gone. And I
[1:04:45] said, "Lord, you lead. I'll follow as
[1:04:46] best I can." You can't control God.
[1:04:51] There's no point in it. This little pea
[1:04:53] brain, this little understanding that we
[1:04:55] have, it can't do it.
[1:04:56] Amen. Now, I'm talking about preaching
[1:04:59] and that doesn't mean much to most of
[1:05:00] you. It means something to brother
[1:05:01] Grant. Maybe a little bit to brother Bob
[1:05:03] or brother Mark or brother Paul as
[1:05:04] they've been behind the pulpit because I
[1:05:05] believe when you step behind the pulpit,
[1:05:07] the spirit will use you if you're a
[1:05:09] proper willing vessel and you're you're
[1:05:11] allowed to be here. Okay? But for most
[1:05:14] of us, we don't do that. Amen. But what
[1:05:16] I'm trying to show you is that the Holy
[1:05:17] Spirit will often make you
[1:05:20] uncomfortable. It's not easy to do. It's
[1:05:23] often
[1:05:25] unplanned and it's even inconvenient
[1:05:27] sometimes. That's the way the spirit of
[1:05:29] God moves. It'll make people shake their
[1:05:31] head and wonder. It'll make you shake
[1:05:32] your head and wonder sometimes. Brother
[1:05:34] Bram talks about he had a planned trip
[1:05:35] to Germany and they had 2500 ministers
[1:05:38] that were committed to that service.
[1:05:40] Plus, they had a 40,000 seat auditorium
[1:05:42] prepared. all the planning, all the
[1:05:45] advertisements, they were going to pack
[1:05:47] the house. And he pulled away in the
[1:05:49] last minute. You know where he went? He
[1:05:51] went and preached in Edmonton, Alberta,
[1:05:54] and he preached a message called the
[1:05:55] great
[1:05:56] commission. You'd think the great
[1:05:58] commission would have led him over to
[1:05:59] 40,000 souls, right? Rather than little
[1:06:03] old Edmonton, Alberta. But what did the
[1:06:05] spirit of God lead him to, church? It
[1:06:06] led him to where the word would be
[1:06:09] received, not just heard. Amen. It's not
[1:06:12] about numbers. This is not a numbers
[1:06:14] game. This is about God having a seed
[1:06:16] that need to hear the word. Remember
[1:06:18] what Paul talked about in Acts 19. He
[1:06:20] says in my heart I wanted to go to Asia
[1:06:22] to preach. I had a burden in my heart.
[1:06:26] The Holy Ghostfilled prophet of the age
[1:06:28] had a burden in his heart to go do
[1:06:30] something. He said, "And the Holy Spirit
[1:06:33] forbade me." Are there souls that needed
[1:06:36] his word in Asia? Yes. In fact, he had
[1:06:39] to walk through Asia to go to Macedonia,
[1:06:42] which is where the Holy Spirit sent him.
[1:06:44] He had to walk through Asia and not
[1:06:46] preach a
[1:06:47] service. How does that make any sense,
[1:06:50] church? The Macedonians couldn't wait.
[1:06:53] The ground was
[1:06:55] ready. And so, the spirit sent him where
[1:06:57] there were people ready to hear. And you
[1:06:59] look at Asia. He comes back to Asia. He
[1:07:01] preaches. There's some converts, but
[1:07:03] you'll see that most of them fall away
[1:07:04] in the scriptures. It's not a strength.
[1:07:07] The Macedonian church is the one that
[1:07:08] needed him the
[1:07:13] most. It would be easy to say, "Lord,
[1:07:16] how could you have me go preach in
[1:07:17] Alberta where maybe he had a thousand
[1:07:19] instead of the 40,000 there?" And if
[1:07:22] we're not careful, church, you can see
[1:07:23] that the flesh would say Germany's where
[1:07:25] I want to be. Listen, as a preacher, you
[1:07:29] give me a crowd of 40,000, I'll pick it
[1:07:31] over a thousand or a hundred every day.
[1:07:33] In my flesh. In my flesh. That's me
[1:07:36] being honest this morning. Why wouldn't
[1:07:38] I want to go where there's a massive
[1:07:40] crowd, where there's more people,
[1:07:43] there's more of an anointing, there's
[1:07:44] more of a pull. It's an experience you'd
[1:07:46] never forget. But I'll tell you this,
[1:07:48] you'd never forget it because it
[1:07:49] wouldn't go the way I thought it was if
[1:07:51] it wasn't God's will. God can't bless me
[1:07:53] if I'm out of his will. Remember,
[1:07:54] Brother Brandom, he had everything pl he
[1:07:56] had gone on a trip and he thought they
[1:07:57] were going to a certain place and then
[1:07:58] they said, "No, I think it was South
[1:08:00] Africa." And they said, "No, no, no,
[1:08:02] we've changed it." He says, "The Holy
[1:08:03] Spirit says we're supposed to go here."
[1:08:04] They said, "But we've made plans to go
[1:08:06] here." And he stood them in a row. He
[1:08:08] says, "I'm standing you up as a witness
[1:08:10] to yourself. It will not go well." And
[1:08:12] they got rained out the whole time. It
[1:08:13] was brutal. He got sick. Six months, I
[1:08:15] think he was sick after that. Why?
[1:08:17] Because he didn't follow the leadership
[1:08:18] of the spirit. We don't go based on
[1:08:21] numbers. We don't go based on what it
[1:08:22] would feel good, what would look good.
[1:08:24] We don't go on based on what we think
[1:08:26] would be greatest impact. We go where he
[1:08:28] shows us to go. That's the way it works
[1:08:30] out. Amen. You know, sometimes
[1:08:33] things seem perfectly logical. That
[1:08:36] appeals to me, perfectly logical and
[1:08:38] reasonable. And we'd say, "Hey, that's
[1:08:39] the way we should do
[1:08:41] this. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't." You
[1:08:44] know, I look at my own life and I look
[1:08:45] at the circle that led me back to
[1:08:48] Newfoundland. And every time I listen, I
[1:08:50] didn't I didn't necessarily want to
[1:08:52] leave Newfoundland. I went to Brother
[1:08:53] Gerald. We prayed about it. We spoke
[1:08:55] about it. We took it to the Lord. And in
[1:08:57] the end, the the the Lord led me away.
[1:08:59] But every time I knew that I was moving,
[1:09:01] I always knocked on the door back to
[1:09:02] Newf Finland. And it never opened. It
[1:09:05] never opened. This is this to me was
[1:09:07] always home. This is where the people
[1:09:09] are that I love and
[1:09:11] appreciate. But that doesn't mean that
[1:09:13] it's God's will for me to come back. And
[1:09:16] clearly it was not. Cuz every time I
[1:09:18] knocked, the door didn't open. And even
[1:09:20] at times where they desperately needed
[1:09:22] people just like me, the door never
[1:09:24] opened. And so I would go elsewhere.
[1:09:26] What was it? It was God was training me.
[1:09:28] God was preparing me for the time when
[1:09:30] he'd open the door. And then when that
[1:09:31] door finally started to crack open, you
[1:09:34] know what I did? I sat back and said,
[1:09:36] "That's too logical. That's probably not
[1:09:37] the Lord's
[1:09:39] will." Why? Because it's a people that
[1:09:42] know me. It's a pastor that knows me,
[1:09:44] appreciates me, wants to have me here.
[1:09:46] There's a need here. That would make two
[1:09:48] sense to have a son of Newfoundland come
[1:09:50] back to Newfoundland, right? Because the
[1:09:52] need doesn't mean it has to be me. It
[1:09:54] just means it needs to be someone. And
[1:09:56] so I could never presume. My wife was
[1:09:58] convinced nine months before I was, I
[1:10:00] think. But by God's grace, she didn't
[1:10:03] focus on it with me. She let me come to
[1:10:05] my own leadership. And then when God
[1:10:07] opened the door, then we walked through
[1:10:09] that and everything worked out. And here
[1:10:10] we stand. But that was me being cautious
[1:10:13] because too many times I've seen people
[1:10:14] take the logical route and they fall
[1:10:16] flat on their face because the spirit is
[1:10:18] not logical by human understanding.
[1:10:20] Remember, our mind is at enmity with
[1:10:22] God. Logic has nothing to do with God.
[1:10:26] Nothing. Nothing. Listen church. He
[1:10:29] bends the the the rules, the laws of the
[1:10:31] universe, the laws of physics. Remember
[1:10:34] the prophet made the axe. Elisha,
[1:10:36] Elijah, I'm not sure which one, made an
[1:10:37] axe head float. How do you make an axe
[1:10:39] head float? Right? Logic won't work. How
[1:10:42] do you take a few pieces of bread and a
[1:10:45] couple fish and break it apart and feed
[1:10:48] 5,000? He broke the laws. Why? Because
[1:10:51] he is the law. It's all under him
[1:10:54] anyways. He can do what he wills with
[1:10:56] it.
[1:10:59] Amen. We're
[1:11:00] sheep. Sheep have to be led. Otherwise,
[1:11:04] we lead ourselves to destruction. Now,
[1:11:06] I'm going to show you a video this
[1:11:07] morning. I don't normally do this, but
[1:11:10] I'm talking about us needing leadership.
[1:11:12] Okay? And and I want to share this
[1:11:14] little clip this morning
[1:11:16] here. This is a sheep that was stuck
[1:11:19] down in a ditch, and he's so happy now.
[1:11:25] Now, I'm going to leave that up there
[1:11:26] while I talk because we laugh and we
[1:11:29] say, "That's
[1:11:31] hilarious, church." But what is that
[1:11:33] sheep's
[1:11:35] problem? The sheep's problem is not that
[1:11:37] he's a sheep. The sheep's problem is he
[1:11:40] left the
[1:11:41] shepherd. The shepherd got him out of
[1:11:43] trouble. The shepherd kept him on the
[1:11:45] side so he could move on with his life.
[1:11:47] And what did he do in joy? He bounded oh
[1:11:50] back over the obstacle that got him in
[1:11:53] trouble and then joyfully leaped right
[1:11:55] back into
[1:11:56] it. Okay, I'm going to take that off
[1:11:58] now. That
[1:11:59] is But we laugh, church. But then you
[1:12:02] got to realize all we are
[1:12:07] sheep. We're just like that dumb fuzzy
[1:12:10] white animal. Sheep are the dumbest
[1:12:13] animals out there pretty much when it
[1:12:15] comes to mammals. They have no ability
[1:12:17] to lead. no ability whatsoever to lead.
[1:12:21] And so what did they
[1:12:23] do? That sheep was so full of joy of
[1:12:26] being free that he took his liberty and
[1:12:28] he jumped right back into into prison.
[1:12:31] Right. Right. What what did he last? 3
[1:12:33] seconds on his own. He lasted three
[1:12:36] seconds. The joy of the Lord is
[1:12:41] my
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:45] help. I need to do more videos in
[1:12:47] church. I
[1:12:50] think. But that's me and that's you.
[1:12:55] When we get away from the leadership of
[1:12:56] the Holy Spirit, we're in total joy,
[1:12:59] total happiness, total freedom, and then
[1:13:02] we fall right in the same ditch that we
[1:13:03] just got out of.
[1:13:10] Amen. But realize this, Satan works on
[1:13:13] both sides of the spectrum here. Because
[1:13:16] we can be so logical and so
[1:13:19] practical and so perfect in our
[1:13:23] doing that we're prone to not moving at
[1:13:27] all. That's this guy. Why? Because I
[1:13:30] want every move I make to be perfect.
[1:13:33] And guess what? If every move is going
[1:13:34] to be perfect, you're never going to
[1:13:35] move because you can't do it. Remember
[1:13:38] read that quote the other day. Brother
[1:13:40] said, "If you're going to do something,
[1:13:41] you're going to make
[1:13:42] mistakes. Period. You might as well
[1:13:44] accept it." Well, guess what? This flesh
[1:13:46] does not like making mistakes. This
[1:13:47] flesh wants to be perfect in public. And
[1:13:50] so I'm prone to not moving in this flesh
[1:13:53] without the spirit. Amen. Because what
[1:13:55] is it? God's trying to get me to step
[1:13:57] out and do something I've never done
[1:13:58] before. And this guy's sitting back and
[1:14:00] saying, "But what if I fail? What if I
[1:14:02] make a mistake? What if I embarrass
[1:14:06] myself? What if? What if? What if? What
[1:14:09] if?" And what happens? I'm paralyzed by
[1:14:11] my own requirement of perfection or
[1:14:14] logic or reason or whatever that might
[1:14:15] be. Then there are others of us that
[1:14:18] can't seem to stop
[1:14:20] moving. Very few of us are balanced in
[1:14:22] our natures. Have you noticed that?
[1:14:25] That's why I need a wife like mine. She
[1:14:27] moves more than I do. That helps me
[1:14:30] move, but I'm stable and and slower, and
[1:14:33] that keeps her from moving too much. And
[1:14:34] between the two of us, we are perfect.
[1:14:36] Absolutely perfect.
[1:14:40] But remember, she's the missing part of
[1:14:43] me. So I'm saying we're per we're
[1:14:45] perfect and everybody's giggling. But
[1:14:47] that's what God intended was that she
[1:14:48] would come in and her and I together
[1:14:50] would be perfect. Unity perfect. Okay.
[1:14:54] But what we've got people that always
[1:14:56] want to be moving. They always want to
[1:14:58] be doing. They always want to be
[1:15:00] talking. They always want to be doing
[1:15:02] their part. And you know what it is?
[1:15:05] God's just sitting back in the corner
[1:15:06] saying, "All right, let me know when
[1:15:09] you're tired, and then I'll show you the
[1:15:12] one thing I want you to do. The one
[1:15:14] thing, the one thing." Amen. God saying,
[1:15:18] "Listen, you've got a lot of energy. Let
[1:15:20] me put it where it will put it, where
[1:15:23] it'll have the greatest effect.
[1:15:25] Otherwise, we're running around like a
[1:15:27] chicken with his head cut off, and all
[1:15:29] we're doing is making a mess." Have you
[1:15:31] ever worked on a an appliance or a piece
[1:15:33] of equipment or or just whatever? It
[1:15:35] could be just a a little thing in your
[1:15:37] house and you dub everything you can and
[1:15:40] you can't get it to work. You can't fix
[1:15:42] it. And so what do you do? You call a
[1:15:44] professional. Now, if you're a wife,
[1:15:45] maybe you call your husband. Maybe some
[1:15:47] of you you husbands call your wives. I
[1:15:49] don't know. Or maybe if you're a
[1:15:50] husband, you call in a a tradesman. And
[1:15:52] what do they do? They come in and they
[1:15:54] go right to the source and they have the
[1:15:56] right tool and the right technique.
[1:15:57] Right, Brother Matt? And they just do
[1:15:59] it. and everything works
[1:16:01] perfectly. And what do you say? I wish
[1:16:04] I'd have brought you in sooner.
[1:16:07] Right? I wish I brought in the
[1:16:09] professional sooner. It would have shave
[1:16:11] saved me all the
[1:16:13] frustration, would have saved me all the
[1:16:15] time, and it' be working better than it
[1:16:18] ever had
[1:16:19] before. Isn't that the way it is with
[1:16:21] God? Too many times. Looking back, we
[1:16:25] wish we'd have brought him in
[1:16:27] sooner. But here's the thing. Once we
[1:16:29] brought him in, do we stay with him?
[1:16:32] See, sometimes what we do is we kind of
[1:16:33] call him in, you know, like a valet or
[1:16:36] something. Hey, hey, Lord, I need some
[1:16:37] help
[1:16:38] here. And we're bringing him into our
[1:16:41] situation rather than walking with him
[1:16:44] as we go through
[1:16:45] situations. And so, he comes in and then
[1:16:47] what do we say? Thank you, Lord, for
[1:16:49] fixing that. Off you go now. And we
[1:16:51] don't say off you go, but we walk away
[1:16:52] and we go back to our logic and reason
[1:16:54] or practicality or emotion or whatever
[1:16:55] that might be. Call them in and keep
[1:16:59] them. Say, "Lord, I'm going to follow
[1:17:01] you around now because I notice it's
[1:17:03] easier to live if you're with me."
[1:17:06] That's the way it's supposed to
[1:17:08] go. Then if he says go, we go. And then
[1:17:11] if he says stay, we stay cuz we're with
[1:17:14] him now. And that's what keeps us.
[1:17:16] That's what steadies our lives. He says
[1:17:18] there's something. Sorry, there we go.
[1:17:20] Do you want to see it one more
[1:17:22] time? It just every time I watch it, I
[1:17:25] shared this with so many people.
[1:17:27] And it just yeah, it speaks to
[1:17:32] me. He says, "There's something in a man
[1:17:35] that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:38] that makes him believe the supernatural,
[1:17:40] makes him believe in God. I sat down
[1:17:43] with a man one time, a pastor, and I
[1:17:47] told him, "The Holy Spirit said this to
[1:17:50] me." And he said, "The Holy Spirit
[1:17:52] doesn't speak like that." He didn't
[1:17:54] believe in it. literally did not believe
[1:17:56] in the Holy Spirit speaking to an
[1:17:57] individual believer. That's in this
[1:18:01] message. He was so practical, he'd
[1:18:04] forgot the
[1:18:05] supernatural. That doesn't work for me,
[1:18:07] church. I can do practical real well on
[1:18:10] my own. I need the supernatural to take
[1:18:12] me beyond what the practical can't do.
[1:18:16] Amen. He says led by the spirit. It's
[1:18:18] not the man. It's something inside of
[1:18:20] him pushing out. He can't hold it and he
[1:18:22] just can't stop himself. there's
[1:18:24] something there moving. My wife told me
[1:18:26] a story about a man that was at a a big
[1:18:30] um um you know a big set of meetings and
[1:18:33] he got filled with the spirit and he
[1:18:35] came out and he went to that man that
[1:18:37] had done the preaching. He says, "I'm
[1:18:38] going to go to seminary and I'm going to
[1:18:41] learn to become a missionary so I can go
[1:18:43] out." And you know what that man said?
[1:18:45] He said, "Go out while you've got
[1:18:46] something to give. Take that anointing
[1:18:48] that's on you. Take the spirit of God,
[1:18:50] that thing that's inside you that's
[1:18:52] driving you. Go now cuz seminary will
[1:18:55] take it out of you. Go while you got
[1:18:57] something to give. Go while your fire's
[1:18:59] lit so you can light somebody else. I
[1:19:02] thought that was good. Go while you got
[1:19:04] something pushing out. Cuz if you wait,
[1:19:07] you've noticed I've talked about this
[1:19:08] before. You ever have that that time in
[1:19:11] service where something says just stand
[1:19:12] up and raise your hands and everybody's
[1:19:14] sitting and if you don't do it, have you
[1:19:17] ever noticed what happens? Pretty soon
[1:19:19] somebody else over there pops up. Why?
[1:19:21] Because you didn't do it. God said, "I'm
[1:19:22] I'm going to have it. Somebody will
[1:19:25] listen to me this morning. Somebody will
[1:19:26] worship. Somebody will praise in a way
[1:19:28] that's
[1:19:29] uncomfortable." And I've seen it time
[1:19:31] and time again. So now I don't disobey.
[1:19:32] I do it as soon as he does that. But
[1:19:34] that's a leading of the spirit. That's
[1:19:36] not me just jumping up. And that's the
[1:19:38] way we ought to be as well. But you'll
[1:19:40] see what cuz there's something that's
[1:19:42] building up there and it's got to find a
[1:19:44] vessel that's willing to move. And so
[1:19:46] that's what he's trying to do. But it's
[1:19:48] not just about moving. Sometimes it's
[1:19:50] about holding in place. Amen. Sometimes
[1:19:53] everything in our body, in our mind and
[1:19:55] emotions is saying, "You got to do
[1:19:57] something about this. You got to change
[1:19:58] this. You got to address this. You got
[1:20:00] to work this out." And God's saying,
[1:20:02] "You don't have a clue what's going on,
[1:20:04] son. Daughter. You just need to sit
[1:20:06] still for a little bit and let me show
[1:20:08] you what's happening." Amen. Why?
[1:20:10] Because we're often uncomfortable. We're
[1:20:12] offended. We're hurt. We're
[1:20:14] frustrated. Somebody stepped on our
[1:20:17] rights. and we think I got to go out
[1:20:19] there and fix this. But remember, our
[1:20:22] Christian walk is one of rest. It is not
[1:20:25] of getting up and doing everything. It's
[1:20:28] resting in Christ, abiding in Christ,
[1:20:30] and letting him move us around. That's
[1:20:33] what he's supposed to be doing. So many
[1:20:34] times, God is trying to teach us, keep
[1:20:36] your hands off the steering wheel, and
[1:20:38] I'll show you what's really going on
[1:20:39] here. Cuz there is always way more than
[1:20:41] what we see. Always. Always. Amen. And
[1:20:44] I've learned as a pastor, as a father,
[1:20:46] as a husband that I need to go
[1:20:48] prayerfully and wait. When there is
[1:20:51] something that when when this entire
[1:20:53] body is screaming, "Do something."
[1:20:55] That's usually a good sign. Don't do
[1:20:57] anything. Cuz the body's driving this
[1:20:59] situation, not that restful spirit in
[1:21:02] the soul. As a pastor, I could destroy
[1:21:05] the congregation if every time I got
[1:21:07] flustered or frustrated or saw something
[1:21:09] and I just go with a hammer and just
[1:21:10] bang, I'm going to drive that nail down.
[1:21:12] You can't do it. You can't do it. People
[1:21:15] have to grow by the spirit, not by the
[1:21:17] pastor knocking them around. Can't do
[1:21:19] it. Can't do it. I can lead you to
[1:21:22] water, but you've got to drink. That's
[1:21:24] the way it's got to
[1:21:26] work. So, I've learned to sit back and
[1:21:28] say, "Lord, what's your will? Lord, what
[1:21:30] am I missing? Lord, is this a me
[1:21:33] problem? Is this a me problem? Cuz
[1:21:36] sometimes I'm worked up, but the
[1:21:38] problem's me, not
[1:21:39] them." I got an amen. Thank you, brother
[1:21:41] Bob. and Sister Moren as well. Sometimes
[1:21:44] the problem's me. The me monster needs
[1:21:47] to be addressed. And so many times when
[1:21:49] he's done working on me, I don't really
[1:21:51] have any thought about what that person
[1:21:53] should be told or what I should do to
[1:21:55] them. Why? Because I realize, hey, I
[1:21:58] contributed. And once he fixes me, I'm
[1:22:01] like, he can work on them, too. I'm too
[1:22:05] exhausted, too beat up, too
[1:22:09] humbled to go back and try and correct
[1:22:11] that brother or
[1:22:12] sister. But listen, I can apply my own
[1:22:15] force if I'm in my house. I'm the dad.
[1:22:17] I'm the husband. As brother Paul says, I
[1:22:19] am the high priest of this home. And I
[1:22:21] can go in and I can go bang bang bang
[1:22:22] all day long. And you know what it is,
[1:22:24] church? It's my authority, not the Holy
[1:22:27] Spirit's. It's my force, not the Holy
[1:22:30] Spirit's. And all I'm doing is I am
[1:22:32] forcing my family to line up with
[1:22:34] me. And listen, there's an element to
[1:22:36] that, brothers. We ought to control what
[1:22:38] comes in and out of our house. Yes,
[1:22:41] absolutely. But we cannot force, as
[1:22:43] brother Barry was talking about, we
[1:22:44] cannot force our children to live a Holy
[1:22:46] Ghost life without the Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost. I can work with the deacons here
[1:22:51] and I can say, "Brothers, if somebody
[1:22:53] does this, you get in there and do that
[1:22:54] and this and that." And I definitely
[1:22:55] don't want to see this and if this ever
[1:22:57] happen. No, I can do that, but that's
[1:23:00] just the force of me. And that'll never
[1:23:02] do anything for the church. I can't
[1:23:05] force my spouse, can't force my children
[1:23:06] into anything that will last. I can
[1:23:09] teach them. Scripture says, "Train up a
[1:23:12] child in the way he should go." And when
[1:23:13] he is old, he won't turn away from it.
[1:23:17] See, it takes God to work with him. God
[1:23:20] to work with her to bring him to a place
[1:23:21] where they can hold on to it. But the
[1:23:23] force of our
[1:23:24] will will not hold them. it won't last
[1:23:27] long
[1:23:28] time. We have to be led by God, not by
[1:23:31] the fact that we're uncomfortable or
[1:23:33] we're hurt or we're struggling, whatever
[1:23:36] that might be. Brother was talking
[1:23:38] about, remember, he said, "I was in the
[1:23:39] mountains and there was that spring and
[1:23:40] I just kept bubbling and bubbling and
[1:23:42] bubbling." And I said, "Spring? Why do
[1:23:43] you bubble? Why do you bubble?" He said,
[1:23:45] "Because there's a pressure behind me.
[1:23:46] There's a source behind me that keeps
[1:23:48] pushing up." He says this. He says, "And
[1:23:50] that's the way every man that's born of
[1:23:52] the spirit of God." He doesn't go
[1:23:54] himself anymore, but there's something
[1:23:56] behind him when he's led by the Holy
[1:23:58] Spirit makes him do things he thought he
[1:24:00] wouldn't do. Now, catch this. Watch how
[1:24:02] he looks. You say, "What's that look
[1:24:04] like, Brother John?" It's not you a
[1:24:06] bubbling. It's something in you
[1:24:07] bubbling. It's not you shouting. It's
[1:24:11] something in you screaming. It's not you
[1:24:14] crying. It's something got in your tear.
[1:24:16] Amen. That's it. led by the spirit of
[1:24:19] God. Our worship has to be spirit-ledd,
[1:24:22] not emotionled. Listen, uh there's a a
[1:24:25] brother that I knew down in Texas and he
[1:24:28] was a phenomenal guitar player, great
[1:24:30] musician, and he was raised in a good
[1:24:33] home and as a young person, he backed he
[1:24:35] didn't backslide, he never really got
[1:24:37] right, I guess. And he went out and he
[1:24:38] was at a concert and he said an
[1:24:42] atmosphere came over that concert. He
[1:24:44] said, "That scared me back to church
[1:24:46] because it felt exactly like what I
[1:24:48] experienced in
[1:24:51] church. It wasn't of God, but it was a
[1:24:54] spirit of worship and
[1:24:56] praise towards something
[1:24:58] satanic." And he said, "It was so close,
[1:25:01] it felt like I was back in church." The
[1:25:03] effect, the atmosphere, the
[1:25:07] goosebumps, everything was there. He
[1:25:08] said, "It was like a church service
[1:25:10] except God wasn't there." Scared him
[1:25:12] straight back to church.
[1:25:15] Emotion is not what drives
[1:25:17] this.
[1:25:20] Amen. Our purpose is not to be led
[1:25:23] around by our emotions. God gave us
[1:25:24] them. They are a part of worship.
[1:25:27] Emotional response is a part of worship,
[1:25:29] but it doesn't drive it. It doesn't
[1:25:32] drive it. It has to be from the inside
[1:25:34] coming out. Amen. All of it has to be
[1:25:36] brought subject to God. And that's a
[1:25:37] part of the crucifying of the flesh. I
[1:25:39] told the story before how I was called
[1:25:41] to minister and it was at a camp meeting
[1:25:43] that brother Matt Watkins was preaching.
[1:25:44] It was directed to the young people and
[1:25:46] my pastor said, "I want you there." And
[1:25:47] I went there and they didn't really have
[1:25:49] anything that I could do. So I was kind
[1:25:50] of frustrated, frankly. My family wasn't
[1:25:52] there. It was just me. And so I was
[1:25:55] like, "Okay." You know, felt like a
[1:25:56] third leg, just nothing to do there. But
[1:25:58] the final service, Brother Matt preached
[1:26:00] on surrender and it was a good service.
[1:26:02] But again, it's mostly focused on young
[1:26:04] people. And so I'm there as a support
[1:26:06] and I'm not really kind of digging in
[1:26:07] maybe the way that I would the way it's
[1:26:09] brought it. It it you know just just
[1:26:11] done a little differently than maybe you
[1:26:12] do for a more mature Christian. And then
[1:26:15] at the end everyone was singing and
[1:26:16] worshiping and you know I was there I
[1:26:18] was enjoying it. Hey I love the
[1:26:20] preaching of the word. I love being with
[1:26:21] the saints of God. I love the worship
[1:26:23] and praise. But suddenly I went from
[1:26:25] just enjoying it to my hands went up and
[1:26:27] my eyes closed and my head went up. And
[1:26:30] that wasn't me that was raising my hands
[1:26:33] because what a hands up mean church?
[1:26:36] Surrender. He had just preached on
[1:26:38] surrender. But I had not been convicted
[1:26:41] of anything in my life as he was doing
[1:26:43] this. There was nothing going through my
[1:26:44] mind as he was preaching this. But what
[1:26:47] was it? The spirit of God started to
[1:26:50] move. And my hands went up and I said,
[1:26:51] "Lord, what is this about?" And he said,
[1:26:54] "I'm calling you to preach." And I said,
[1:26:55] "I don't think that's a good idea." And
[1:26:57] here we are today. But what was it?
[1:27:00] Something pushed my hands up. Something
[1:27:02] started the process of surrender and it
[1:27:05] wasn't me. It was a spirit of God moving
[1:27:08] because if I started the
[1:27:11] process, I'd be running the show
[1:27:13] today. That won't work. He's got to
[1:27:17] start it and he's got to finish it and
[1:27:19] he's got to carry me through from the
[1:27:21] start to the finish. Amen. I I didn't
[1:27:23] want to be a preacher. Shoot me now.
[1:27:26] Don't want to be a preacher. Didn't want
[1:27:27] to be a preacher.
[1:27:29] Now, if you took it away, I'd be very
[1:27:31] unhappy. But in and of myself, I don't
[1:27:33] want to be that. It's difficult. It
[1:27:36] takes a lot of commitment. It takes a
[1:27:38] lot of time. It's a burden on the
[1:27:39] family. It's a burden on your mind. It's
[1:27:41] a burden on your body. Look at my hair.
[1:27:43] Look at my
[1:27:47] eye. Imagine if I had a real gift, how
[1:27:50] bad it would
[1:27:51] be. Amen. But what is it? Sons of law.
[1:27:55] God are led by the spirit of God. I
[1:27:58] didn't start this work. And listen,
[1:28:00] church, if he takes me out of it, I
[1:28:02] imagine he'll take away the desire to do
[1:28:04] it as well now. And the anointing to do
[1:28:06] it. Why? Because it's him working, not
[1:28:08] me. That's the only way that this can
[1:28:10] work. I couldn't go into preaching with
[1:28:12] a whole bunch of knowledge. And that was
[1:28:14] my fear was I knew I I thought I knew
[1:28:16] too much. I've said this over the pulpit
[1:28:18] many times. A know-it-all. You can't be
[1:28:21] a know-it-all and be a preacher because
[1:28:22] knowledge isn't how this works. It's re
[1:28:25] revelation by Holy Ghost leadership.
[1:28:27] It's the only way you can preach
[1:28:29] revelation by the leadership of the Holy
[1:28:30] Spirit. Amen. If I'm coming up here to
[1:28:33] deliver a speech I've memorized or share
[1:28:35] this knowledge that I have, you know
[1:28:37] what it's going to do? It's going to
[1:28:38] destroy you because it'll lead you to
[1:28:40] dead religion and theology. That's
[1:28:43] what'll happen. It'll destroy the very
[1:28:45] congregation. But it takes that nature
[1:28:47] of a sheep that's surrendered to the
[1:28:50] shepherd for preaching to work. It's the
[1:28:52] only way that it can work because I'm a
[1:28:53] sheep just like you. That's the thing.
[1:28:55] The preacher is no different than the
[1:28:57] congregation except he has a gift. But
[1:28:59] what does a gifted sheep do except lead
[1:29:01] the sheep into further
[1:29:03] destruction. That's it. I can only take
[1:29:05] you further off the path than anyone
[1:29:07] else because I'm just a sheep. I'm
[1:29:10] gifted enough to get you to follow
[1:29:12] me. So I can take you wherever I want
[1:29:15] you to go. And it's still destruction
[1:29:17] for all of us. What do we need? We need
[1:29:19] a shepherd. I need a shepherd. You need
[1:29:22] a shepherd. And that's the only way that
[1:29:23] a sheep can get anywhere.
[1:29:25] And we can interfere with that
[1:29:27] leadership. And we're going to talk
[1:29:28] about that a little bit this morning
[1:29:30] because the the way we interfere is we
[1:29:32] let something else lead. We let
[1:29:34] something else get a toe hold or a
[1:29:36] foothold or a finger hold in our life.
[1:29:38] We get so wrapped up in life. We let it
[1:29:41] consume us. We let it overcome us. And
[1:29:43] next thing you know, we're overwhelmed.
[1:29:45] We're frustrated. We're wore out. We
[1:29:46] don't know if we're coming. We don't
[1:29:47] know if we're going. We don't know
[1:29:48] what's up. We don't know what's down. We
[1:29:50] don't know what's right or wrong. We can
[1:29:52] get so beat up in this life. Amen. We
[1:29:55] end up bitter. We end up depressed. We
[1:29:57] end up dissatisfied. And so many things
[1:29:59] can latch on to us in life circumstances
[1:30:01] if we let it because it's always trying
[1:30:04] to get in. It's always trying to get in.
[1:30:06] It's like we have these pressure vessels
[1:30:08] in in oil and gas primarily. And usually
[1:30:11] it's to keep something in. You know,
[1:30:12] you've got something that's at high
[1:30:14] pressure and you got a big piece of
[1:30:15] steel around it, a big vessel, a big
[1:30:17] piece of pipe. Well, really for the
[1:30:19] believer, the pressure is from the
[1:30:20] outside trying to get in. And everything
[1:30:22] in this world is trying to drive into
[1:30:24] our life. And if there's the littlest
[1:30:25] crack, there's the littlest flaw. What
[1:30:27] does it do? It'll fail in that area and
[1:30:28] it'll let it inside. Everything's trying
[1:30:31] to press in. Brother Brandham here is
[1:30:33] I'm going to share this set of quotes
[1:30:34] here. And he's talking to his home
[1:30:36] church. And he's saying, "Listen,
[1:30:38] there's reasons why we struggle here.
[1:30:40] There's reasons why we have problems
[1:30:42] internally." And he talked about a
[1:30:43] church that had gossip issues and
[1:30:45] backbiting issues and and listening to
[1:30:48] people without pointing them to the
[1:30:50] word. That's a key to this. We can get
[1:30:53] so caught up in listening that we never
[1:30:54] give people the direction they need to
[1:30:57] go. And he said, "That's the root of a
[1:30:59] lot of the issues we face as a church."
[1:31:00] Now, I'm not I don't believe that's here
[1:31:02] this morning. Maybe it is. The Lord
[1:31:03] knows, but that's not why I'm preaching
[1:31:05] it. I want to get to to what's at the
[1:31:07] end. But remember, the spirit of God is
[1:31:09] supposed to be within us. But demons are
[1:31:11] also trying to get into the Christian
[1:31:13] walk. Absolutely. A demon is virtually
[1:31:16] powerless without a body. The battle
[1:31:18] started up here, right, Brother Grant?
[1:31:20] And then it came down here. God kicked
[1:31:22] them out up there and now they're down
[1:31:23] here. And God's trying to kick them out
[1:31:25] down here as well. So, they're trying to
[1:31:27] get into our lives and into our thoughts
[1:31:29] and and inhabit us in some sort of way.
[1:31:31] Amen. And so, when we get caught up in
[1:31:32] situations and circumstances and
[1:31:35] personalities and preferences, that's a
[1:31:37] prime time for something else to come in
[1:31:38] and try and influence us. Now, he says
[1:31:40] this. He says, you know, what's in your
[1:31:43] heart is what expresses
[1:31:46] itself. In other words, if you've got
[1:31:49] the nature of Christ, if you got the
[1:31:51] Holy Spirit in your life, it will
[1:31:53] produce the fruit of the spirit. Period.
[1:31:56] End of story. You can't say, "I have the
[1:31:58] spirit of God and you're producing
[1:31:59] fruit." That's not the spirit of God. It
[1:32:01] can't work that way. The life will
[1:32:03] produce the fruit. Okay? He says the
[1:32:06] Holy Ghost is here. The Holy Ghost wants
[1:32:09] to come in. That's the reason today that
[1:32:10] the Holy Spirit, he hasn't gone from you
[1:32:12] forever. Now, he's talking about people
[1:32:14] that have not truly received the baptism
[1:32:16] of the Holy Spirit. Okay? They haven't
[1:32:17] had a new birth. They've had an
[1:32:19] experience, a church experience. They've
[1:32:21] had a experience in a camp meeting.
[1:32:23] They've had experience in a wonderful
[1:32:25] service where they felt it all around
[1:32:26] them. But he says that's the reason he
[1:32:27] can't come in and stay. He says, "But he
[1:32:30] hasn't gone from you forever." Why?
[1:32:31] Because he wants to get in. He says it's
[1:32:33] just sitting out there on the limbs of
[1:32:35] the tree somewhere ready to fly itself
[1:32:37] back and come into you and give you love
[1:32:40] and peace and joy like you used to
[1:32:43] have. He says it is. He's ready to do
[1:32:46] it. He wants to do it. He's longing to
[1:32:48] do it. But you won't let him do it. Now
[1:32:51] catch how this happens. He says that's
[1:32:53] what makes the dove takes its flight. He
[1:32:56] says just let somebody just start a
[1:32:57] little something around the church and
[1:32:59] the first thing, oh is that so? Oh, you
[1:33:01] don't mean so. He says, "Right, then the
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost goes and flies away." It just
[1:33:06] can't stand that kind of spirit. As long
[1:33:09] as that lamb nature leaves you, then the
[1:33:11] Holy Ghost is gone. That's right. He
[1:33:13] says, "That's what's the matter today."
[1:33:14] That's the reason the people are in the
[1:33:16] condition they're in is because they let
[1:33:18] the wrong spirit come into their heart
[1:33:21] and into their life. Okay? He says the
[1:33:24] Bible said that's the reason there's so
[1:33:26] many sick and afflicted among us because
[1:33:28] of such things. He said, "We must be
[1:33:30] gentle. We must be peaceful. We must be
[1:33:34] a lamb so the dove can abide with us."
[1:33:39] Notice he's not talking about an
[1:33:41] experience of a moment. He's saying the
[1:33:43] spirit of God is supposed to abide. It's
[1:33:45] supposed to come in and stay in. And
[1:33:48] that's what the new birth is, church.
[1:33:49] Once you're sealed with the spirit of
[1:33:51] God, it cannot leave. Your soul is
[1:33:53] sealed. Okay? But we're talking now
[1:33:56] about an an abiding, not just an
[1:33:58] anointing on us, but an abiding in us.
[1:34:00] It's not one here, here one moment and
[1:34:03] then gone the next. He says, now
[1:34:04] remember the dove will come. Someone
[1:34:07] said, "Oh, don't tell me I never
[1:34:09] received the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] Down the night there one night when he
[1:34:12] came in, I could just walk." He says,
[1:34:14] "Sure, that was him." He didn't say you
[1:34:16] received him. He said that was him. Oh,
[1:34:18] I felt so good. I felt like I could get
[1:34:20] every little bird out of the tree and
[1:34:21] hug it and love it. my wickedest person
[1:34:23] that ever done anything to me. I felt
[1:34:25] like I could put my arm around them and
[1:34:26] hug them. Oh, how I felt. He says,
[1:34:28] "Sure, that was the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] temporary." Cuz if you had it all the
[1:34:34] time, then the effect would be all the
[1:34:36] time. Okay? This was not the inddwelling
[1:34:40] spirit. This was the presence around the
[1:34:44] feeling of it, the anointing of it. But
[1:34:47] it could come and go. He says, "But you
[1:34:49] see the reason he couldn't
[1:34:52] abide." He says, "You were a lamb. Then
[1:34:54] in that atmosphere, in that church
[1:34:57] service, in that moment, you opened
[1:34:59] yourself up and that atmosphere changed
[1:35:02] you and all of a sudden you're loving
[1:35:04] and sweet and kind and gentle." He says,
[1:35:08] "And that feeling will stay for you for
[1:35:09] a moment." He says, "But when you became
[1:35:12] a wolf, he had to take his flight. When
[1:35:15] you left that church service, when you
[1:35:16] lost the
[1:35:18] feeling, when you lost the emotion that
[1:35:21] you
[1:35:22] felt, he says he had to take his flight.
[1:35:24] Why? Because you went back to your old
[1:35:26] nature. He says there's nothing wrong
[1:35:27] with the dove. It's you and you let that
[1:35:29] spirit come to you. Then he asked this
[1:35:32] question. Did I let it? How does that
[1:35:34] come on to me? He says yes. When you
[1:35:37] went to listening to that
[1:35:39] gossip, when you listened to that lie,
[1:35:42] when you went to saying, "Well, I've got
[1:35:44] a right to." Now, notice these three
[1:35:45] things. Gossip, we ought to have no time
[1:35:47] for it, church. If you don't know that,
[1:35:50] you know that you know that it's true,
[1:35:51] you should not say it. And if you don't
[1:35:54] say it, then nobody will ever listen to
[1:35:55] gossip because it won't exist. I
[1:35:58] remember we had a situation not too long
[1:35:59] ago where somebody shared a a prayer
[1:36:01] request, but the information was
[1:36:04] incomplete. And so I reached out to the
[1:36:06] the the person that said it and they
[1:36:08] said, 'Well, this is what I heard. Well,
[1:36:10] well, who did you hear it from? So I
[1:36:11] went to that person. I asked them, 'What
[1:36:12] did you hear?' And so by the time I got
[1:36:14] to the end of it, the prayer request was
[1:36:16] not a prayer request such as it was
[1:36:18] given. But if we'd have come in here and
[1:36:20] said that over this pulpit, then
[1:36:22] somebody could have said, "Look at them.
[1:36:23] They're talking about us. They're
[1:36:24] thinking we're doing this. They think
[1:36:26] we're doing that. And they're praying
[1:36:28] about a situation that doesn't exist."
[1:36:31] good intentions, but not taking the time
[1:36:34] to make sure you got the facts right.
[1:36:36] Sometimes we gossip without realizing it
[1:36:38] because we didn't take the time to
[1:36:40] verify the information first. Okay? We
[1:36:43] always make sure somebody's got the
[1:36:48] facts. Second hand doesn't work, church.
[1:36:50] You got to go back to the first hand.
[1:36:53] Remember, we played that game before. I
[1:36:54] know the young people have played it
[1:36:56] where you have a a group of people in a
[1:36:58] circle and the first person tells
[1:36:59] something to the second person and then
[1:37:01] the second person repeats it to the
[1:37:02] third and by the time they get to the
[1:37:04] end, does it look anything? Does it
[1:37:06] sound anything like what was said? It's
[1:37:09] not even close. It's hilarious. It's
[1:37:11] hilarious how far that that message gets
[1:37:13] changed as it goes from person to
[1:37:15] person. It's the same thing with
[1:37:18] stories, events, things that went on.
[1:37:22] Every time we tell it, we change it
[1:37:25] usually. And then the other person hears
[1:37:27] it and they forget a key detail and all
[1:37:29] of a sudden we've got villains. We've
[1:37:31] got drama. We got all sorts of issues
[1:37:34] that didn't necessarily exist. Gossip.
[1:37:37] They says you listen to that
[1:37:39] lie. Sometimes you listen to somebody
[1:37:41] tell an
[1:37:42] untruth, but sometimes it's a lie about
[1:37:44] your position in Christ. And you believe
[1:37:47] that it doesn't you believe that God
[1:37:49] doesn't love you. You believe that that
[1:37:51] promise isn't for you. That God's not
[1:37:54] working in your life. You believe a lie
[1:37:55] that says you don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:57] And it binds you. It binds you because
[1:38:00] you forgot who you are in Christ. Then
[1:38:03] the last one, he says, "Well, I've got a
[1:38:04] right
[1:38:05] to." And what do we do? We say, "I don't
[1:38:07] got to take this. They can't say that to
[1:38:10] me. They have no right to do that. I've
[1:38:13] got rights." Leadyia, people's rights.
[1:38:17] He says, "You haven't got no
[1:38:21] right." He says, "You are bought with a
[1:38:24] price." And that was the price of the
[1:38:26] precious blood of the son of God. You
[1:38:27] have no legal rights. But then he says
[1:38:30] these words,
[1:38:32] "Hallelujah." How many of us if if
[1:38:34] somebody said, "You got no rights." We'd
[1:38:35] say, "Hallelujah." But catch what he
[1:38:37] says. He says, "The only rights you have
[1:38:40] is to come to the fountain filled with
[1:38:43] blood drawn from Emanuel's veins when
[1:38:46] sinners plunged beneath the flood lose
[1:38:48] all their guilty stain. Your right is to
[1:38:50] come and be forgiven. Your right is to
[1:38:53] come and be accepted. What more rights
[1:38:54] do you want?" Cuz you have to lay down
[1:38:56] all your other rights to come to that
[1:38:58] one. It's not me and Jesus. It's Jesus.
[1:39:02] He says that's the only right you have
[1:39:04] is a surrendered self-will to God and
[1:39:08] then God does the leading from then on.
[1:39:10] He says that's what causes these
[1:39:12] meetings. What? The supernatural. He
[1:39:14] says that's what causes so many strange
[1:39:16] things. The Holy Spirit will go to a
[1:39:17] place and said this is not right. Stop
[1:39:19] the meeting. Move yonder. He says I'll
[1:39:21] stop it too, brother. Move right on.
[1:39:22] That's right. Because you've got to be
[1:39:24] led by the spirit of God. And the only
[1:39:27] way to be led by the spirit of God is to
[1:39:30] keep gentle.
[1:39:32] He said, "And not to know a whole
[1:39:34] lot." Oh, that is so hard for some of
[1:39:37] us. That is so hard for some of us,
[1:39:39] isn't it? Because we know too much. And
[1:39:42] we think because we have an
[1:39:44] understanding. Remember, he would talk
[1:39:45] about the parrot that could mimic. And
[1:39:48] you could say all these words to the
[1:39:49] parrot, but the parrot could say it, but
[1:39:51] he never understood it. And so, you
[1:39:53] bring in a a a professor from Harvard
[1:39:57] and try and have a conversation with
[1:39:58] that parrot. That parrot could say a lot
[1:40:00] of words, but it could never understand
[1:40:01] what it was
[1:40:03] saying. We're the same way with God. We
[1:40:05] only understand as he gives us
[1:40:07] understanding. We only see things as he
[1:40:09] gives us revelation. He says, "Oh, you
[1:40:12] think I know a whole
[1:40:14] lot." Anybody here say, "I know a whole
[1:40:16] lot." We know a whole lot. We do know a
[1:40:19] whole
[1:40:20] lot, but it doesn't matter. He says,
[1:40:24] "Yeah, you got your brain all worked up
[1:40:25] and it can't even work itself.
[1:40:29] What they say to Paul, much learning
[1:40:30] have made thee mad. Sometimes we are so
[1:40:33] worked up trying to figure the way
[1:40:35] through. Figure the way out. And we
[1:40:37] think we've got it all mapped out. And
[1:40:39] he says, you can't even get yourself out
[1:40:41] of a ditch like that sheep. You get out
[1:40:43] and you jump right back in. He says,
[1:40:45] "You know all the books and all the
[1:40:47] answers and all the Greek and all the
[1:40:48] Hebrew and haven't got any place for the
[1:40:50] dove to roost." That's right. He says,
[1:40:51] "But if you know it all, then the dove
[1:40:53] can't lead because you know too much.
[1:40:55] The lamb doesn't claim to know nothing.
[1:40:57] It's got to have somebody else to lead
[1:40:59] it. Glory. He says, "That's it. Don't
[1:41:01] know nothing." Amen. The only thing I
[1:41:03] know is Christ Jesus died to save me. He
[1:41:06] says, "Down through California, there
[1:41:07] was a guy coming. Had a sign in front of
[1:41:09] him that said, I'm a fool for Christ."
[1:41:11] And on the back, it said, "Whose fool
[1:41:12] are you?" He said, "That's right. Become
[1:41:15] a fool to the world that you might be
[1:41:17] led by the Holy Ghost." Because the sons
[1:41:19] and daughters of God are led by the Holy
[1:41:22] Ghost. What's the purpose of the spirit
[1:41:24] of God? It's to show us the will of God.
[1:41:27] To lead us into the will of God so we
[1:41:29] can receive the will of God. Show us,
[1:41:33] lead us so we can receive. That's the
[1:41:35] purpose of it. Amen. It puts us on the
[1:41:37] path to receive the full word of God.
[1:41:39] The word of God started it at the
[1:41:40] beginning. It was the thoughts of God.
[1:41:43] It became the spoken word of God. And
[1:41:44] now it's here to become the manifested
[1:41:46] word of God in you and I. It's the word
[1:41:48] from start to finish. So we have to be
[1:41:50] drawn back to that word. So everything
[1:41:52] we do, everything we say, everything we
[1:41:55] have in our lives is supposed to be
[1:41:56] surrendered to that word cuz that's
[1:41:58] what's going to take us all the way
[1:41:59] through. That's the only way to keep
[1:42:00] things in perspective is to take it back
[1:42:02] to the
[1:42:03] word. Amen. When the only way to find
[1:42:06] the truth of the situation is to take it
[1:42:08] back to the word and that'll do it. The
[1:42:11] truth is what's going to set us free.
[1:42:13] Amen. And so when we want to see what's
[1:42:15] going on, we say, "What does the word
[1:42:16] say?" Listen, you can come to me and
[1:42:19] say, "Brother John, what would you
[1:42:21] suggest? What do you think?" But I need
[1:42:23] to take you from me and point you to the
[1:42:26] word because I've got all sorts of
[1:42:28] ideas. But remember, I'm supposed to
[1:42:30] move those on. I'm supposed to move
[1:42:32] those on. And we're supposed to let the
[1:42:34] spirit speak through the word of God.
[1:42:36] That's what the Holy Spirit's here to do
[1:42:37] is to make the word speak into our lives
[1:42:40] so it can lead us and guide us. Amen.
[1:42:43] It's there to open our soul. Move past
[1:42:45] the mind. Move past the mind and take it
[1:42:48] into the soul so the soul can receive
[1:42:50] it. And then from there, it can come
[1:42:52] back out through your mind and through
[1:42:53] your body and these different things and
[1:42:55] produce what God wants for us. He said,
[1:42:57] "I believe that God's word supplies
[1:42:59] everything that we have need of right
[1:43:01] here in the word. From our beginning to
[1:43:03] the end, it's found right in God's word.
[1:43:05] It foretells." He says, "God's word's a
[1:43:07] warning." Now, you don't read God's
[1:43:09] words just like you read a newspaper.
[1:43:11] You read God's word by the Holy Spirit.
[1:43:14] See, because the Holy Spirit itself
[1:43:15] speaking through Christ, Christ was
[1:43:17] thanking God that he had hid these
[1:43:19] things from the eyes of the wise and
[1:43:21] prudent and would reveal them to babes
[1:43:23] such as would learn. So, we can't go in
[1:43:25] with our
[1:43:26] education. You can't go in just because
[1:43:29] you've been raised in a Christian church
[1:43:30] and say, "I understand this. I've said
[1:43:33] it before. I'll say it again. It's my
[1:43:34] favorite saying. I'll say it
[1:43:37] again. Until I got the Holy Ghost, I
[1:43:40] didn't really see the Bible for what it
[1:43:41] was. Couldn't. Couldn't. How can you?
[1:43:45] You need this Holy Spirit to open your
[1:43:47] eyes. Paul the Apostle was Saul reading
[1:43:50] that word under a religious upbringing,
[1:43:53] under the best teachers, and it took him
[1:43:55] straight into an antichrist
[1:43:56] spirit. Just because I'm raised in a
[1:43:59] message church doesn't make me right. It
[1:44:01] takes the spirit of God in me to put the
[1:44:03] word into its proper perspective, to
[1:44:05] open it up. He says, "So you see,
[1:44:07] there's no way of ever being educated.
[1:44:09] There's no way of ever denominating.
[1:44:10] There's only one way to get right, and
[1:44:12] that's to be led by the spirit of God.
[1:44:15] And that experience you had must cope
[1:44:17] with this word." See, he says, "Then
[1:44:19] you've got it." Now, we know what coping
[1:44:21] is. Coping uh the easy way to do it, we
[1:44:23] don't have any crown molding here. You
[1:44:25] can sort of see it on the base uh boards
[1:44:27] there. When you put two pieces of of
[1:44:30] crown molding together, they're always
[1:44:32] they're usually sticking out a bit. And
[1:44:33] so you got to do a particular cut to get
[1:44:35] those two pieces to go together. And
[1:44:37] they call it coping. You can do with
[1:44:38] pipe. If you take two pieces around pipe
[1:44:40] and put it together, you don't just cut
[1:44:42] one side flat and put it up against the
[1:44:43] pipe and weld it. It won't work. You got
[1:44:45] to cut out this very particular arc all
[1:44:47] the way around to get it to fit
[1:44:48] perfectly. It's called coping. He says
[1:44:50] your life experience has to cope. It has
[1:44:53] to match up with the word of God.
[1:44:54] Otherwise, it ain't God. That's a hard
[1:44:57] thing to say. It's a hard thing to say.
[1:45:00] But listen, going to church ain't coping
[1:45:02] with the word of God. Just get just
[1:45:04] doing what mom and dad tell you ain't
[1:45:06] coping with the word. Those are good and
[1:45:07] don't stop doing it. But it's going to
[1:45:09] take a lifechanging experience that
[1:45:11] matches what the word of God says comes
[1:45:12] with a new birth for us to cope properly
[1:45:15] to match up to what it
[1:45:19] says. So when life
[1:45:21] happens, and it does and it will, what
[1:45:24] are we going to do? We're led by the
[1:45:26] spirit. We've got the spirit of God
[1:45:27] inside of us. But do we grab our friend?
[1:45:30] Do we grab our brother? Do we grab our
[1:45:31] sister and say, "Here, let me tell you
[1:45:33] what's going on in my life. Let me tell
[1:45:34] you what so- and so did. Let me tell you
[1:45:36] what what happened out here. Let me tell
[1:45:38] you how my husband's treating me. Let me
[1:45:39] tell you what my wife's doing. Let me
[1:45:41] tell you the problems I'm having with my
[1:45:42] kids." That's okay. It's okay to share
[1:45:46] our burdens. We're supposed to share our
[1:45:48] burdens. Amen. But if all we're doing is
[1:45:51] being a listening ear, church, we're not
[1:45:52] going to get
[1:45:53] ahead. A listening ear is just sympathy.
[1:45:57] But what happens is after that
[1:45:58] conversation, you might cheer them up a
[1:46:00] little bit. You might help them a little
[1:46:02] bit, but they're going to walk out and
[1:46:03] that situation's going to overcome them
[1:46:05] the way it did just before they came in.
[1:46:07] Why? Because all you've given them is
[1:46:08] sympathy. Sympathy isn't power. It's not
[1:46:11] power. It feels good for the moment.
[1:46:14] It's emotional connection. It gives
[1:46:16] somebody a bolster for a moment, but
[1:46:18] they're going to walk out and that
[1:46:19] situation's still going to be there.
[1:46:20] Their questions are going to be there.
[1:46:21] Their hurt, their offenses, their
[1:46:23] concerns, whatever it might be, it's all
[1:46:25] going to be there. and your sympathetic
[1:46:26] ear is going to fall away and they're
[1:46:28] going to be right back into life. Amen.
[1:46:31] Why? Because we're keeping the focus on
[1:46:33] the wrong thing, which is the
[1:46:36] situation. But when the situation is
[1:46:38] presented, what do we what ought we to
[1:46:40] say? Here's what the word
[1:46:42] says. And what do we do? We're trying to
[1:46:45] bring it into an eternal
[1:46:46] perspective, into a God perspective,
[1:46:49] rather than a life pers perspective, if
[1:46:51] I could put it that way. Amen.
[1:46:55] We've got to go beyond sympathy. We've
[1:46:56] got to go beyond understanding. Oh,
[1:46:58] brother, I've been there. Sister, I've
[1:47:00] been there. I know what you're feeling.
[1:47:03] Wonderful. How did you get through it?
[1:47:06] That's what we need to know. I've been
[1:47:07] there, but how did you get through it?
[1:47:10] You ought to say, "I've been there, but
[1:47:12] he set me free. I've been there, but he
[1:47:15] delivered me out of the mouth of the
[1:47:16] lion and the paw of the bear. I've been
[1:47:19] there and he provided the money. I'm
[1:47:21] there and he guided me through my job
[1:47:23] search. I've been there and he gave me a
[1:47:27] spouse. I'm there and he healed my
[1:47:31] hurts. I'm there, but he healed my
[1:47:35] family. That's what people need to hear
[1:47:38] is the power of the word in action by
[1:47:41] the spirit, not just sympathy.
[1:47:44] A I teased brother
[1:47:47] Joe. He says, you know, you know, the
[1:47:49] other day he was playing hockey and he
[1:47:51] got shot in the foot. And whenever he
[1:47:53] says something and it gets hurt to get
[1:47:55] hit in the ankle with a slapshot, okay,
[1:47:56] it hurts. He said, "That was it. I was
[1:47:59] done for the game." And you know what I
[1:48:00] say?
[1:48:01] A poor braito. That means little guy.
[1:48:04] Poor little guy in Spanish, right? A And
[1:48:08] he I don't think he likes it. I'll be
[1:48:10] honest. Cuz what? We want
[1:48:13] sympathy. But sympathy doesn't change
[1:48:15] his hurting ankle. Makes him feel good
[1:48:18] for the little bit, but when he walks
[1:48:20] out, he's still got his hurting ankle.
[1:48:22] You know what would help is if I said,
[1:48:23] "Hey, Joe, they make ankle guards for
[1:48:26] things like that. It'll take the sting
[1:48:28] out of it next
[1:48:30] time." Or maybe you could consider not
[1:48:32] standing in front of people when they
[1:48:33] take a slapshot. I'm trying to tell them
[1:48:36] how you keep this from happening, right?
[1:48:37] Not just, "Oh, it's okay, buddy." No,
[1:48:41] give them something that'll help them
[1:48:42] through the
[1:48:44] situation. What is it? We've got to go
[1:48:46] and say, "Here's what the word says we
[1:48:49] should do."
[1:48:50] Listen, let me say it this way. If
[1:48:52] somebody says, "I've got an issue," we
[1:48:56] ought to be able to take them to the
[1:48:57] word. And you know what? We should
[1:48:58] finish with a word of
[1:49:00] prayer. Because that tells you, if you
[1:49:02] can pray about it at the end, that tells
[1:49:04] you whether you were unloading or
[1:49:07] looking for
[1:49:09] liberty. Because if all we want to do is
[1:49:11] talk about it, we're looking for
[1:49:13] sympathy. We're not looking for
[1:49:15] deliverance, right? And sometimes we
[1:49:18] don't know. And sometimes when you come
[1:49:20] to me, I don't know. And I have to be
[1:49:23] able to say that. But I say, "We know a
[1:49:25] God who knows." And we ought to be able
[1:49:27] to close every conversation like that in
[1:49:29] prayer with each other and commit it to
[1:49:31] God and say, "Lord, let your word come
[1:49:33] to pass in this person's life. Let your
[1:49:36] word come into this situation." And that
[1:49:38] way we go out and the situation may
[1:49:41] still be there, but we've got an
[1:49:43] attitude change. We've got a perspective
[1:49:45] change. We've got a change in our
[1:49:47] approach. And we've got faith that God
[1:49:50] is going to move in the situation
[1:49:51] because we've taken it back to his word,
[1:49:53] not just taken it back to my sympathy or
[1:49:55] my
[1:49:57] understanding. When we get together at
[1:50:00] the end,
[1:50:02] sympathy, comments, pats on the back,
[1:50:05] hugs, every single time it should still
[1:50:07] finish with the word of God. Sometimes
[1:50:10] we need emotional
[1:50:11] support. You know, they have these
[1:50:13] emotional support animals now. Have you
[1:50:15] seen people walk around? They can take
[1:50:16] them everywhere, planes and everything.
[1:50:18] Emotional support animals is for people
[1:50:20] that are overwhelmed easily and that
[1:50:22] that animals there usually a
[1:50:24] dog to to give them the hugs and the
[1:50:27] kisses that they can't get from the walk
[1:50:28] people walking by. It's to make them
[1:50:31] feel safe and appreciated and
[1:50:35] loved. God's not an emotional support
[1:50:38] animal. He's a changing God for your
[1:50:42] situation. Listen, he gives emotional
[1:50:44] support. He's a father to the
[1:50:46] fatherless. He's a husband to the widow.
[1:50:49] He's all these things, but he's way more
[1:50:51] than that. He's way more than that.
[1:50:53] Sometimes what we're wanting is the
[1:50:54] emotional support rather than the change
[1:50:57] because the emotional support feels
[1:50:58] good. The change
[1:50:59] hurts. And the word will change you. It
[1:51:02] has to change you from glory to glory.
[1:51:05] Let me share a story and I'm closing
[1:51:06] this morning. Yesterday I was studying
[1:51:08] and my morning was very interrupted and
[1:51:11] so I was kind of late into the afternoon
[1:51:12] and then my wife left to with the boys
[1:51:15] to to go pick up the the other boys at
[1:51:17] the the practice here. And so Biscuit,
[1:51:19] our our new beagle, came down with me in
[1:51:21] my in my office. And since I was
[1:51:24] distracted, I thought I would distract
[1:51:26] him as well. So I put on a YouTube video
[1:51:29] of dogs barking just to see what he
[1:51:32] would do. Okay. So I put this on and so
[1:51:35] you've got a video that's showing the
[1:51:36] dog that's barking and then you got the
[1:51:38] barking sounds that are obviously coming
[1:51:40] out of the speakers. And so I was just
[1:51:42] having a bit of fun with him to see what
[1:51:43] he would do to distract him while the
[1:51:45] doors were closing. The feet were
[1:51:47] pattering upstairs so he wouldn't get
[1:51:48] all anxious about it cuz he just wants
[1:51:50] to go if they go. He loves the Jensen
[1:51:52] and and uh Samuel in particular and
[1:51:54] Blanca and if they leave he wants to be
[1:51:56] with them and he'll be up there barking
[1:51:57] and whining for for ages. So I was
[1:51:59] trying to distract him. So, as soon as I
[1:52:01] turned on that video, he was instantly
[1:52:04] intrigued. He left the door and he came
[1:52:06] over to
[1:52:07] me and he he he jumped up on my he put
[1:52:10] his paws on my knee, but he wasn't
[1:52:13] looking at the screen. He was looking at
[1:52:15] the speakers. Now, let me tell you, if
[1:52:18] you've been in my office downstairs,
[1:52:19] I've got a 32 in 4K definition beautiful
[1:52:23] monitor that I study on, and there is a
[1:52:27] dog barking, a huge head of a dog
[1:52:29] barking in 4K resolution, and all he can
[1:52:33] do is look right there at the speaker or
[1:52:35] there at the speaker, and the dog is
[1:52:37] right here. And he doesn't know what's
[1:52:39] going on. He could not see the dog
[1:52:42] barking because he was locked in to the
[1:52:44] dog barking. he was locked into the
[1:52:47] sound of it. Now, beagles have great
[1:52:48] eyesight, but their their sense of smell
[1:52:51] and their sense of hearing is more
[1:52:52] powerful than their eyesight because
[1:52:54] beagles typically they're rabbit dogs
[1:52:56] and so they're usually in thick brush
[1:52:58] and so they don't need to see as far.
[1:53:00] What they need to be able to do is hear
[1:53:02] and smell that animal so they can track
[1:53:03] it. So, his dominating sense is his
[1:53:06] hearing and his nose. So, he can't smell
[1:53:09] it. So, the next thing he goes to is his
[1:53:11] hearing. And so, he's locked on to that
[1:53:14] speaker. And how I had to take his hand
[1:53:16] firmly in my head in my hands and I had
[1:53:19] to do this and point him at the screen.
[1:53:21] And you know what he did while I pointed
[1:53:23] him at the screen? He kept trying to
[1:53:25] twist it back to the sound. Why? Because
[1:53:29] his senses declared that's where the dog
[1:53:32] is. Everything in his mind was
[1:53:34] screaming, "The dog is to the left and
[1:53:36] the dog is to the right." Okay? Why?
[1:53:40] Because the situation I was presenting
[1:53:41] him was beyond his understanding. He'd
[1:53:44] never been there before. Remember what
[1:53:46] God said to Joshua? Let the word go
[1:53:48] before you. You've never been this way
[1:53:50] before. You're in it. Your promise is in
[1:53:53] it, but you've never been here. You've
[1:53:54] got to let the word lead the way. And so
[1:53:56] I took biscuit and I was trying to lead
[1:53:57] him to the path of
[1:53:59] understanding. And he fought and he
[1:54:03] fought and then all of a sudden he
[1:54:05] caught
[1:54:09] it. Now he start he didn't like it cuz
[1:54:12] this dog is right here. I mean, it's
[1:54:13] only about two foot away and it's
[1:54:16] barking at him and it was not a it was
[1:54:17] it was not a nice bark. And so then he
[1:54:20] backed away a little bit and the ears
[1:54:22] went down and he started to
[1:54:25] growl. I'm like, "Okay, you caught it."
[1:54:28] See, he put the sound and the sight
[1:54:30] together and now he had an
[1:54:32] understanding. The thing I'm seeing is
[1:54:34] the thing that I'm
[1:54:35] hearing. He hadn't caught it before.
[1:54:39] Amen. That seems simple. I'm talking
[1:54:43] about a dog. But remember, he's leaning
[1:54:45] on his keenest sense. So when we're
[1:54:48] logical and a situation comes up, what
[1:54:51] do we lean on? Logic. When we're
[1:54:54] practical, what do we lean on?
[1:54:56] Practical. When we're emotional, what do
[1:54:59] we lean on? Emotion. When we're
[1:55:01] intuitive, this is the killer. When
[1:55:03] we're intuitive, what do we lean on,
[1:55:05] church?
[1:55:07] Intuition. When we're spiritual, we lean
[1:55:09] on I feel led
[1:55:11] to. But what are we looking for? We're
[1:55:14] looking for something that raises us
[1:55:16] beyond the overwhelming sense that we
[1:55:19] tend to use and take us into a six
[1:55:21] sense, a super sense of faith in the
[1:55:23] word of God so we can see things for
[1:55:25] what they're supposed what they really
[1:55:28] are. And he finally realized that dog I
[1:55:32] can see is the dog I can hear. And even
[1:55:34] though the sound isn't coming from his
[1:55:36] face, it's coming from those two divided
[1:55:38] speakers, he put the two together and
[1:55:39] now he was immersed in the situation. So
[1:55:42] then when I put up then I change it and
[1:55:44] I put it out. Now he'd look to the
[1:55:45] screen. But sometimes he'd forget and
[1:55:48] he'd get drawn back to those speakers
[1:55:49] again. Why? It was still beyond his true
[1:55:51] understanding. He could be immersed for
[1:55:53] a bit, but then he come right back to
[1:55:54] his natural senses because he hadn't
[1:55:56] come into a place of trusting and
[1:55:58] understanding what was going on. It was
[1:56:00] quite cute.
[1:56:04] But here's the thing. In the end, you
[1:56:06] know what he did? He jumped up in my
[1:56:09] lap. And then he investigated from there
[1:56:12] cuz he felt safe. Now, now he wasn't
[1:56:15] sitting back. Now he was sitting on my
[1:56:17] lap. And then that nose went forward and
[1:56:19] he's trying to smell cuz it's his keen
[1:56:21] sense. And he can't smell it, but he can
[1:56:23] see it and he can hear it. And he starts
[1:56:26] to dig deeper into the situation because
[1:56:28] he's feeling safe now. Daddy's here. The
[1:56:30] master's here. That's what God's trying
[1:56:32] to get us to do. Hey, sit with me and
[1:56:35] I'll show you what's going on. Then you
[1:56:37] don't have to worry about the
[1:56:39] circumstances. That situation won't get
[1:56:41] you. That person won't get you. Whatever
[1:56:44] it is, it won't get you. Just rest and
[1:56:46] I'll open up your understanding by the
[1:56:48] word of
[1:56:50] God. It was too much for him, though.
[1:56:52] And I don't believe to this day, the day
[1:56:55] after that beagle or or that biscuit
[1:56:57] really understands what was going on.
[1:56:58] But for a moment there, he was at rest
[1:57:00] with it because he trusted me and he let
[1:57:03] me comfort him in that moment and show
[1:57:04] him what was going
[1:57:05] on. We have a guiding hand. We have a
[1:57:09] master that's here to show us what's
[1:57:11] going on. Amen. Today we have so much
[1:57:13] coming at us, don't we? You know, it's
[1:57:16] in the world. We look at the politics of
[1:57:18] today and everything that's going on,
[1:57:19] natural disasters. We see that a
[1:57:21] helicopter crashed in the Hudson
[1:57:22] yesterday and you think, "Oh my
[1:57:24] goodness, how horrible." a family, a
[1:57:27] man, his wife and kids
[1:57:29] died and it can overwhelm you
[1:57:31] emotionally. It can be very difficult.
[1:57:33] You hear about a a school shooting. You
[1:57:35] hear about a a natural disaster. They
[1:57:37] had that that big earthquake in Myammar
[1:57:39] and and
[1:57:40] just hundreds, thousands of people dying
[1:57:42] in these things. We have believers that
[1:57:44] send out prayer requests. We know
[1:57:46] everybody that's sick around the world
[1:57:47] at any given time. And we can sit here
[1:57:50] and we can be completely overwhelmed by
[1:57:52] that. We can be overstimulated by it.
[1:57:55] And it can cause us to where we don't
[1:57:57] know what to do because I can't care for
[1:57:59] everyone. I can't pray for everyone. I
[1:58:03] can't help everyone. And neither can
[1:58:04] you. But yet you sit there and if you
[1:58:06] took down and put a prayer list together
[1:58:08] of everything you knew that was wrong in
[1:58:10] the world right now, you'd never get off
[1:58:12] your
[1:58:14] knees. What do we need? We need a
[1:58:16] guiding hand to show us what matters to
[1:58:18] us. What God wants us to do with it. As
[1:58:21] a pastor, I can't pray for every member
[1:58:23] of every other church. I've got a flock
[1:58:25] he's given me. This is where my prayer
[1:58:27] time goes. This is where my energy goes.
[1:58:30] This is where my support goes is this
[1:58:31] body cuz this is where he's placed me.
[1:58:34] Back in Paul's day, you didn't find out
[1:58:36] somebody was sick until it was too
[1:58:38] late. Or unless the spirit came and told
[1:58:41] you to pray. And I've had that happen
[1:58:43] today. I remember I was going through a
[1:58:45] particular situation many years ago and
[1:58:48] my sister Lana, she called me up and she
[1:58:50] said, "What's going
[1:58:51] on? What's wrong? Is something
[1:58:53] happening?" And I said, "Yes, but I
[1:58:55] can't tell you about it." She said, "God
[1:58:58] woke me up last night and told me to
[1:59:01] pray for
[1:59:03] you. He works. He speaks. He moves. But
[1:59:08] we've got to be able to catch it. But we
[1:59:11] can get so absorbed in everything that's
[1:59:13] going on and he's wanting to focus on
[1:59:15] this brother, this sister, she needs
[1:59:17] your help. This brother could use it. He
[1:59:19] could really use it. Go over and spend
[1:59:21] some time with
[1:59:23] him. Whatever it might be. And he's
[1:59:26] moving to keep us where we can do
[1:59:28] something without being completely
[1:59:34] overwhelmed. Biscuit was overwhelmed by
[1:59:36] his hearing. But once I got him to
[1:59:39] settle down a bit and he could have some
[1:59:41] comfort, he started to get more focused.
[1:59:43] And then when I turned it off, he just
[1:59:44] went and he laid down. He was perfectly
[1:59:46] at rest. He didn't try to find the dog.
[1:59:48] Didn't jump on my my desk to see where
[1:59:50] it went. Oh, it's done. It's over. And
[1:59:52] he went and he laid down for a little
[1:59:54] bit. We ought to be able to rest that
[1:59:56] same way. When we come into his
[1:59:59] presence, he settles us
[2:00:02] down. He founds us on his word and we
[2:00:05] can go rest knowing that he's in
[2:00:07] control.
[2:00:11] We need that assurance
[2:00:14] today. We can't have a word that's just
[2:00:18] here. We can't have a word that mommy
[2:00:21] has and daddy has. We need a word that
[2:00:23] works for
[2:00:24] me. I need a word that works for me. I
[2:00:28] need to know that this word works. And
[2:00:30] that's the only way I'm going to trust
[2:00:32] it is that I see it work. But there's
[2:00:34] got to be that one time where I give it
[2:00:36] a chance. And that's the start to most
[2:00:38] people's Christian walk is when they
[2:00:39] give the word a chance. When they what
[2:00:42] they give themselves over to Jesus
[2:00:44] Christ and by faith they say, "I'm going
[2:00:46] to step out on that word." And then when
[2:00:48] he comes in and he changes their life,
[2:00:50] then they know the word works. And then
[2:00:53] from then on, they can walk in faith.
[2:00:55] And he'll take them one step and a
[2:00:57] little step and a little step. And
[2:00:58] pretty soon at the end of it all,
[2:01:01] they're in
[2:01:02] glory. Just a walk of faith. But they
[2:01:05] had an assurance of something real from
[2:01:06] the beginning. Religion won't keep us.
[2:01:09] Knowing your the message is right won't
[2:01:11] keep us. It takes an inddwelling abiding
[2:01:14] presence of God to make that word live.
[2:01:17] That's what's going to keep us. We're
[2:01:19] going to close with two quotes to see
[2:01:20] this
[2:01:21] morning. Otherwise, what happens? We
[2:01:23] come into a new challenge, a new person,
[2:01:26] new situation, new sickness, new
[2:01:30] job, new fight.
[2:01:33] And what do we do? We fall
[2:01:35] apart because we haven't had a reality
[2:01:38] of a word that works. But if we've been
[2:01:41] through the battle once and the word
[2:01:42] worked, then we'll take it the second
[2:01:44] time and the third time and the fourth
[2:01:46] time and we'll trust it. We'll trust it
[2:01:48] rather than trust ourselves and trust
[2:01:50] that thing that we always have that
[2:01:52] wants to jump in. God's trying to guide
[2:01:54] us into his perfect will, trying to take
[2:01:56] us through these things. He said God can
[2:01:58] only use what we give to him. He says,
[2:02:01] 'Now, there's a lot of you who say,
[2:02:02] 'I'll give 15 minutes on Sunday morning.
[2:02:04] If you preach any longer than that, I'll
[2:02:06] just get up and go home. There's a
[2:02:08] brother I know if the pastor preaches
[2:02:11] over 45 minutes, he gets up and walks
[2:02:13] out in this
[2:02:15] message cuz he's got a
[2:02:18] quote. Didn't read the whole quote,
[2:02:20] though, because brother said we could
[2:02:21] stay here all
[2:02:23] night, but what? He's got a
[2:02:26] freedom in himself to walk away. That's
[2:02:30] not the Holy Ghost, church. That's not
[2:02:31] the Holy Ghost. He says, "I'll give him
[2:02:34] 15 minutes, 45 minutes. I'll give him
[2:02:36] one service a week." What is
[2:02:38] it? He says, "Well, then you got 15
[2:02:40] minutes on Sunday morning." He says,
[2:02:42] "You gave God 15 minutes. He'll use
[2:02:44] those 15
[2:02:45] minutes." He said, "Hm." He says,
[2:02:47] "That's what you give to God. Some of
[2:02:48] them say, I can maybe suffer a half
[2:02:50] hour. I don't know how I can do it. Not
[2:02:53] in this
[2:02:56] church." He says, "Well, see, that's
[2:02:58] what you get. 15 minutes, a half hour.
[2:03:00] See, our habits and our decisions limit
[2:03:02] God. You want more of God, give more to
[2:03:05] God. It's that simple. It's that simple.
[2:03:08] You want more of God, you got to give
[2:03:09] away something else. Listen, Satan will
[2:03:11] fill our days. He'll fill our days as
[2:03:13] much as we want it to be
[2:03:15] full. One thing that I've had to do in
[2:03:17] in in stepping into pastorship is I've
[2:03:19] had to whittle down what matters in my
[2:03:21] life because I don't have time for a
[2:03:22] whole lot. And so my life is very this
[2:03:26] is where the the discipline and the
[2:03:28] structure comes
[2:03:29] in because I've got to be able to spend
[2:03:32] time with my family, go for a walk with
[2:03:34] my wife, play hockey with my boys, talk
[2:03:36] to Jonathan about computers, give Selena
[2:03:38] a hug
[2:03:40] occasionally, but I've still got to
[2:03:42] study and study and study. That can't
[2:03:46] fall by the wayside either, but neither
[2:03:48] can my family. So what that means is I
[2:03:50] can't have the frivvality that maybe I
[2:03:52] could afford before. I can't have all
[2:03:54] the hobbies I used to have
[2:03:56] before. Why? Because I've got to give
[2:03:59] everything to I've got to give
[2:04:00] everything now. There's no holding
[2:04:03] back. He says, "You give it all, you get
[2:04:06] it all. You give a little bit, you get a
[2:04:07] little
[2:04:09] bit." He says, "What can you give?" He
[2:04:12] says, "God will receive what you'll
[2:04:13] give, but God wants all of you." He
[2:04:16] wants every bit of you. He wants all. He
[2:04:19] wants everything you are. He wants your
[2:04:20] life. He wants your testimony. He wants
[2:04:22] every minute you live. He wants you to
[2:04:24] live right, act right, talk right, do
[2:04:26] right. He wants everything perfectly
[2:04:29] surrendered to him that he can lead you
[2:04:32] and guide you and put you into places
[2:04:35] where he wants you to go led by the
[2:04:38] spirit. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[2:04:40] if we
[2:04:43] would. It's not
[2:04:46] easy to be led by the spirit.
[2:04:50] It's not easy to catch that
[2:04:52] voice. It's not easy to catch that
[2:04:56] leading. You know what's hard so many
[2:04:58] times is the waiting. If you really want
[2:05:00] to be led, you'll wait until you have
[2:05:02] leadership. And everything about this
[2:05:04] world is so immediate. It's trying to
[2:05:05] press us. It's trying to push us to make
[2:05:07] decisions, to take a step, to do this,
[2:05:09] to do that. But the spirit of God is not
[2:05:11] in a it's not in a hurry. But when he
[2:05:14] says go, then you got to go. That's the
[2:05:16] thing. You have to go from sitting still
[2:05:18] to moving real quick. when you catch
[2:05:19] what he wants you to do. But that's a
[2:05:21] thing of prayer. It's a time of feeding
[2:05:24] on the things of God. So you know that
[2:05:26] when he speaks it's him. How are you
[2:05:29] going to know it's the spirit of God
[2:05:31] leading you?
[2:05:32] Church can't be I feel to that never
[2:05:36] works if you can place that leadership
[2:05:38] into the word of God. That's how you
[2:05:41] know. Which means that your waiting time
[2:05:43] should be spent in the word of God.
[2:05:47] We can sit here and we can go down on
[2:05:48] our knees and say, "Lord, what do you
[2:05:50] want me to do?" The best way to find out
[2:05:51] what God wants you to do is go into the
[2:05:53] word and let him quicken it to you.
[2:05:55] That's the simplest way. He's given you
[2:05:56] his thoughts. He's given you his plan.
[2:05:58] He's given you his way. He's given you
[2:06:00] his direction. And we can sit there and
[2:06:02] say, "Lord, show me what you want to
[2:06:03] do." And he says, "But you won't even
[2:06:04] look at what I've given
[2:06:06] you. Go this way. Prayerfully open your
[2:06:10] Bible." He says, "The Holy Spirit will
[2:06:11] open it up to you and he'll show you
[2:06:13] what you need to do." Hey, sometimes
[2:06:15] it's not in there perfectly and we might
[2:06:18] need to have something a little more
[2:06:19] direct, but let's start there. That's
[2:06:21] something we can do. We can all read. We
[2:06:23] can all listen to the word of God. Then
[2:06:25] based on that, see what he does rather
[2:06:27] than I feel or I need. Need is Satan's
[2:06:31] tool so many times. Cuz we need we don't
[2:06:35] need. We don't need that way. We don't
[2:06:38] need to make decisions when everybody
[2:06:39] tells us to. We don't have to do things
[2:06:41] when people tell us we need to. We need
[2:06:43] to be led and we need to be able to wait
[2:06:45] and trust in the meantime. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:47] God bless you. Let's bow our
[2:06:49] heads. Heavenly
[2:06:52] Father, Lord, we're thankful you've
[2:06:54] given us a guide. Lord, we're thankful
[2:06:56] we have a source of leadership, of
[2:06:59] direction, Lord, a place, a person we
[2:07:01] can go
[2:07:02] to. Lord, I pray you help us not just to
[2:07:05] go when we need, Lord, but to go all the
[2:07:08] time, Lord. Lord, that as we walk, as we
[2:07:10] talk, as we make decisions, Lord, that
[2:07:13] in all of it, you would be present,
[2:07:15] Lord, that we know that you are with us,
[2:07:17] Lord. For that's what gives us faith is
[2:07:18] when we know it's your will. No matter
[2:07:20] what comes up, we can trust that you'll
[2:07:22] take us through. Lord, I pray you
[2:07:24] quicken our faith, Lord, by the word,
[2:07:26] Lord, that as we dig into it, as we read
[2:07:28] it, Lord, as your prophet said, not like
[2:07:30] a newspaper, not like a novel, Lord, but
[2:07:33] we'd read it as understanding that it's
[2:07:35] your thoughts and it's your will and
[2:07:37] it's meant for us to walk in it,
[2:07:38] heavenly father. Lord, we need your
[2:07:41] leadership now more than ever, Lord.
[2:07:43] There's so many things coming at us,
[2:07:45] Lord. We need you to settle us down,
[2:07:48] Lord, and help us focus on the things of
[2:07:50] God that matter to us, Lord. Give us a
[2:07:53] grace, Lord, to make the right
[2:07:55] decisions, Lord, to hold when you want
[2:07:57] us to hold, to move when you want us to
[2:08:00] move, Lord, and to know the difference
[2:08:02] between the two. Lord, grant us grace,
[2:08:04] Lord. Bless your people, Lord. You see
[2:08:06] the many needs that are here. Lord, we
[2:08:09] pray that you'd move in each one. Lord,
[2:08:10] you see those things that we've held on
[2:08:12] our heart for so long. Lord, it's
[2:08:15] there's things it seems like we prayed
[2:08:16] about for years at times and nothing's
[2:08:18] happened, but Lord, we're trusting that
[2:08:20] the answer's on the way. Lord, give us
[2:08:22] faith to wait, to trust, Lord, to see
[2:08:26] that you're moving. Lord, even when we
[2:08:27] can't feel it, even when nothing seems
[2:08:30] to be changing, Lord, we know that the
[2:08:32] answer's on the way. Grant us grace,
[2:08:34] Lord, we pray. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:08:36] ask it.
[2:08:39] Amen. Consume me, Lord. 595.
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:53] Consume me
[2:08:56] Lord with the
[2:08:59] fire of your
[2:09:04] spirit.
[2:09:07] Consume me
[2:09:11] more and make me more like you.
[2:09:19] and
[2:09:21] praise thee,
[2:09:25] Lord. And bless the
[2:09:29] broken
[2:09:31] pieces of my
[2:09:38] life. Let me be
[2:09:43] used, oh
[2:09:46] Lord, by you.
[2:09:51] Come
[2:09:53] to me
[2:09:57] Lord with the fire of
[2:10:08] your
[2:10:11] me and make me what I
[2:10:19] you and
[2:10:22] praise me,
[2:10:26] Lord, and bless the
[2:10:30] broken
[2:10:31] pieces of my life.
[2:10:40] Let me be
[2:10:43] used, oh
[2:10:46] Lord, by
[2:10:52] you.
[2:10:54] Pleasing. Pleasing. 524, I
[2:10:59] think.
[2:11:05] Please, let me be pleased.
[2:11:10] easy to
[2:11:13] use
[2:11:16] everything that I
[2:11:21] do be
[2:11:25] pleasing to you.
[2:11:30] Oh
[2:11:34] pray that

[2:28:15] you are.
[2:28:18] Lord, we worship you, Lord God, and we
[2:28:20] praise
[2:28:21] you. Not because we are good, Lord. Not
[2:28:25] because we can present any righteousness
[2:28:28] Lord God that justifies our
[2:28:32] cause but Lord God but when we think of
[2:28:35] your love your goodness that you have
[2:28:37] shown it humbles our heart Lord God to
[2:28:40] see you God who so great Lord that you
[2:28:45] humbled yourself Lord God in the humble
[2:28:47] fashion of our humanity Lord to die in
[2:28:50] ourstead and to reconcile us back to you
[2:28:54] Lord.
[2:28:56] And Lord, in this reconciliation, Lord,
[2:28:58] you're calling for hearts to be
[2:29:01] surrendered, lives, Lord God, to be
[2:29:03] subjected by your Holy
[2:29:06] Spirit. And Lord, you told us by the
[2:29:09] scripture, it's not by might, nor is it
[2:29:11] by power, but it's by your spirit, Lord.
[2:29:16] And so God, you see the journey, oh God,
[2:29:18] to perfection where, Lord God, you're
[2:29:21] calling upon us, Lord God, to be
[2:29:23] subjected. Lord, we cannot take the
[2:29:25] journey by ourselves. There's nothing we
[2:29:27] can do, Lord. It's an impossible task to
[2:29:30] overcome, oh God, our self, our
[2:29:32] thinking, our walking, Lord God, our
[2:29:35] attitude, and all these things. There's
[2:29:37] so many defects in our lives, oh God,
[2:29:39] that will disqualify us being children
[2:29:42] of God. But Lord, the scripture Lord God
[2:29:45] reminds us the sons of God are led by
[2:29:48] your spirit. And so God, we come to you,
[2:29:51] represent our minds, represent our
[2:29:54] bodies, represent our desire, we lay
[2:29:56] them all on the altar of
[2:29:58] sacrifice. And Lord, we ask, oh God,
[2:30:00] that your Holy Spirit, Lord God, will
[2:30:03] consume me, Lord, by the fire of your
[2:30:05] Holy Spirit. Lord that we are this
[2:30:08] evening Lord God will be made subjected
[2:30:11] Lord God for the promise to your seed
[2:30:14] this evening oh God that we will produce
[2:30:16] you in this end time Lord in a dark time
[2:30:19] where the shadows are failing Lord God
[2:30:22] Lord we see the nations are breaking and
[2:30:24] Israel awaken Lord God Lord and we see
[2:30:27] and heard oh God of disturbances
[2:30:30] everywhere Lord God it's such a
[2:30:32] trialsome time oh God but Lord the
[2:30:34] scripture declares Lord God that We
[2:30:37] shall live by oh God the living bread
[2:30:40] Lord God. Uh Lord we will live by your
[2:30:42] spirit. We live and walk and and testify
[2:30:45] and breathe. Uh and so this evening Lord
[2:30:48] God Lord God we ask one more time uh oh
[2:30:51] God for another in filling of your holy
[2:30:52] spirit. Uh let it not be our voice we
[2:30:55] hear. Let it not be our responses Lord
[2:30:57] God but let it be by your spirit. Uh
[2:31:00] take us oh God under your control Lord
[2:31:02] God. Father Lord, we are living a life
[2:31:05] here that desire more of this world. But
[2:31:08] Lord God, but Lord, we change the desire
[2:31:11] by the Holy Spirit this evening. And
[2:31:13] Lord, we are calling for heavenly things
[2:31:15] this evening. Lord God, may your Holy
[2:31:17] Spirit take absolute control, Lord God.
[2:31:20] May we see you in action one more time.
[2:31:23] May we feel the presence, oh God, of
[2:31:26] your Holy Spirit. May we hear that voice
[2:31:28] whispering to our hearts. May we know,
[2:31:31] oh God, with reassurances that you're
[2:31:33] there, Lord God, that you never leave us
[2:31:36] nor you forsake us, Lord God. When we
[2:31:38] we're going to the waters, be there,
[2:31:40] Lord God, when we're going through the
[2:31:42] fire, be there, Lord. Be, oh God, the
[2:31:44] strength, be the guide. Hallelujah, Lord
[2:31:47] God. And help us, Lord. Lord, we believe
[2:31:49] that you're more than able, oh God, to
[2:31:51] keep that which we have committed unto
[2:31:53] you. And so, God, we ask that your Holy
[2:31:55] Spirit would take us under your charge.
[2:31:58] Oh God, we're looking for your presence.
[2:32:01] Oh God, not just Lord God from around
[2:32:03] us, from but from within us, Lord. May
[2:32:06] we see you, Lord. Oh God, may we feel,
[2:32:09] may we know that you're there, oh God,
[2:32:12] that Lord God, when when we feel so
[2:32:14] overwhelmed with this life, when we feel
[2:32:16] that nothing is going right, uh may the
[2:32:18] Holy Spirit draw near, Lord God, with
[2:32:21] lingering words, uh whispering thoughts
[2:32:23] of encouragement. Uh oh God, may you
[2:32:26] uplift our spirit. Uh, oh God, may you
[2:32:28] give us a testimony, oh God. Words, oh
[2:32:31] God, of testimony, oh God, that will
[2:32:34] bring your presence so real. Uh, oh God.
[2:32:37] Hallelujah. Lord, we're looking for the
[2:32:39] reality of the presence of God. Uh, Lord
[2:32:42] God, that when we read it, we know for
[2:32:45] sure that this is God's word. This is
[2:32:48] God's promises. Uh, oh God. And they're
[2:32:50] not on the scriptures, on the pages, oh
[2:32:53] God, but there may living realities uh
[2:32:55] oh God, the voice of God in our hearts
[2:32:58] rumbling uh calling forth for the
[2:33:00] supernatural things. Uh oh God, bless
[2:33:02] your people, bless your bribe. And may
[2:33:05] your holy spirit this evening uh take
[2:33:07] absolute control uh Lord God. We believe
[2:33:10] that we are called to overcome this age
