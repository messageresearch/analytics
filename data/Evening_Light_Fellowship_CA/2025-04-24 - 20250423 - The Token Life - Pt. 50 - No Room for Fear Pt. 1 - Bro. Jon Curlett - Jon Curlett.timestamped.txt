[15:53] evening. Just some uh prayer requests.
[15:56] Uh brother Bob is not here tonight as
[15:59] you can tell. Uh he's he was going to
[16:00] song lead but uh him and sister Brenda
[16:02] and uh Kilmore uh taking a break. So we
[16:05] just pray for them this evening.
[16:08] pray for Sister Laura Snow. And uh just
[16:11] the latest update on that is uh she does
[16:14] need our prayers. There's been some
[16:16] complications and things that have come
[16:18] up. So her
[16:22] um the big thing is that she's lost the
[16:25] mobility in her legs and there's a
[16:27] concern that blood flow is not getting
[16:28] to the spinal cord.
[16:31] So they're requesting prayer that
[16:32] there's no more issues with the spinal
[16:34] cord, that her mobility will return and
[16:35] that the bleed in the cessum, if that's
[16:38] how you say that, that will heal on its
[16:40] own and she'll move forward with no more
[16:42] setbacks. So just pray grace to sister
[16:46] Laura Snow and the family and her
[16:48] husband
[16:49] Randy. Uh my
[16:51] mother-in-law a few weeks back, she was
[16:53] just uh dealing with some anxiety and
[16:55] things and she is doing better. Um, we
[16:57] just want to continue to pray for her
[16:59] and just go to give her a rest about the
[17:01] future. We pray for um, brother Abby,
[17:05] his foot. I didn't hear a report on
[17:07] that, but just keep remembering him in
[17:09] prayer. Uh, Priscilla's uncle Paul
[17:12] Batazi was diagnosed with kidney cancer
[17:15] today, and so we're just u just pray
[17:18] grace to him. He's got a meeting with a
[17:20] specialist in May. And so we're just
[17:22] trusting that uh you know that they can
[17:24] get him under control or or even better
[17:26] that the Lord will touch him and and
[17:28] just heal him completely. Um also uh we
[17:32] prayed for Lanny Carlet and understand
[17:34] that he's doing better. He's back to
[17:35] work. So we're thankful for that. Just
[17:38] continue to remember him in prayer. Um
[17:41] brother Kingsley's little fellow Kachi
[17:43] has got a temperature and so we just
[17:46] want to remember him in prayer that he'd
[17:48] feel better. Brother John's eye
[17:50] continues to uh be an issue and uh just
[17:54] pray that that would get
[17:56] resolved. Want to congratulate brother
[17:58] John, sister Blanca on our anniversary,
[18:00] 24th wedding anniversary. It's a big
[18:02] one. Um friend of mine, Rick Pilgrim, a
[18:06] client um collapsed three times last
[18:10] week. some electrical issues in his
[18:12] heart and just uh he needs to slow down
[18:15] and which I don't think is going to
[18:17] happen but uh just want to pray grace to
[18:18] him. Sister Cordella, brother Nelson,
[18:21] just many needs. Um just want to keep
[18:25] all these on on on our hearts and any
[18:27] unspoken request, let's just bring them
[18:29] to the Lord as we pray. U ask u David if
[18:33] you would uh open in prayer. Let's sing
[18:36] this chorus again.
[18:40] Pour your spirit out on
[18:45] me. All just like the
[18:50] rain.
[18:52] Saturate my thirsty
[18:56] soul. Come and fall aresh on
[19:01] me. Fill my cup again.
[19:06] Heal my
[19:08] heart and make me
[19:13] whole. I need you
[19:17] now for your spirit.

[20:02] life, even eternal life, Lord, and our

[22:02] Lord. We know, mighty God, you've done
[22:04] it all, Lord. We don't have to rest in
[22:07] you, but your word says, Lord, that your
[22:09] bride makes herself ready, Lord. So we

[22:34] in our failures, in our shortcomings,
[22:37] Lord, to look to you, Lord, we're no
[22:40] match for the enemy, Lord, but you are.
[22:44] That's why we're no match, Lord. But you
[22:46] want to be there, Lord, to show us your
[22:48] power and glory. Look to you, Lord, for
[22:51] all things, for strength, for wisdom,
[22:55] anything that we have desire of, Lord.
[22:57] All we had to do is look to you. And if
[23:00] we're fervent, Lord, in prayer, Lord, if
[23:03] we're sincere and honest, Lord, and
[23:06] willing, Lord, to give ourselves into
[23:07] your hands, Lord, we know you are

[34:31] vision harsh and
[34:35] sweet. A one who gave all he had for
[34:42] me. I've seen the
[34:45] passion of his
[34:49] death and the
[34:52] forgiveness of his final breath.
[34:57] Now I can
[34:59] never be the
[35:03] same. My heart has been
[35:08] forever
[35:10] changing. I want to live and love and
[35:16] keep the way he gave.

[35:32] away. Laying it down on the
[35:37] altar. Now I'm giving my
[35:42] life away.

[35:51] offer is
[35:55] [Music]
[35:58] my. So here I stand
[36:03] today giving my
[36:06] life away.

[36:32] cross to the blood of
[36:36] Calary's cross.
[36:40] And if I live, I live for
[36:45] him. Or if I die, I count. It
[36:52] came. My life is not my own,
[36:58] but from this day on.
[37:07] Now I'm giving my life
[37:14] away. Laying it down on the
[37:19] altar. Now I'm giving my
[37:23] life away.
[37:28] The very least I can
[37:33] offer is
[37:39] my. So here I stand
[37:44] today, giving my
[37:47] life
[37:49] away. And now I'm giving my life away.
[37:58] Lay it down on the
[38:03] altar. Now I'm giving my life
[38:11] away. The very least I can
[38:16] offer is my home.
[38:24] spoke last
[38:25] day
[38:28] today. Giving my
[38:30] life
[38:32] away. And now I'm giving my
[38:37] life
[38:41] away. Lay it down on the
[38:46] altar. Now I'm giving my
[38:50] life away.
[38:56] The very least I can
[39:00] offer is my
[39:05] [Music]
[39:06] home. So here I
[39:09] stand
[39:11] today, giving my
[39:14] life away.
[39:18] Let's stand. I forgot one prayer
[39:20] request. It's brother Levi. He's not
[39:21] here tonight. He's been throwing up and
[39:23] not feeling well. I remember him. As
[39:26] brother John comes to sing 105, Jesus be
[39:29] the Lord of
[39:34] all.
[39:36] Jesus
[39:38] be the
[39:40] Lord of
[39:42] all.
[39:44] Jesus
[39:46] be the
[39:48] Lord of all.
[39:53] Jesus
[39:54] be the
[39:56] Lord of
[39:59] all the
[40:01] kingom of my
[40:07] heart.
[40:09] Jesus
[40:11] I
[40:13] surrender
[40:15] all.
[40:17] Jesus
[40:19] I surrender.
[40:22] [Music]
[40:23] All
[40:25] Jesus
[40:27] I
[40:29] surrender
[40:31] all the
[40:33] kingoms
[40:35] of my
[40:39] heart. Oh
[40:41] Jesus
[40:43] be the
[40:45] Lord of all.
[40:50] Jesus
[40:51] be the
[40:53] Lord of
[40:56] all.
[40:58] Jesus
[40:59] be the
[41:01] Lord of
[41:03] all the
[41:06] kingoms of my
[41:11] heart. Heavenly
[41:14] Father, Lord, that's our earnest desire
[41:16] this evening. Lord, is that you would be
[41:19] Lord, not just Savior, Lord, not just to
[41:23] preserve us and save us from our past
[41:25] and ourselves, Lord, but we want you to
[41:27] be Lord, that we could be led and
[41:29] guided, Lord, that we can be, Lord, sons
[41:31] and daughters that can follow the
[41:33] leading of your spirit day by day, Lord.
[41:36] That means we've got to make you the
[41:37] head of this life, the head of our
[41:39] houses, the head of our families, the
[41:40] head of our very selves, Lord God. Lord,
[41:43] it's a walk of surrender. It's a walk of
[41:45] trust. It's a walk of faith to let you
[41:47] lead and we'll follow behind, Lord. But
[41:49] I pray you grant us grace day by day to
[41:51] do it, Lord. That we be doers of the
[41:53] word, not just hearers of the word only.
[41:56] Lord, bless your people here today,
[41:57] Lord. Be with those that couldn't make
[41:58] it, Lord. Those that are studying, those
[42:01] that are sick, Lord, those that are
[42:02] traveling, Lord, we pray your mercy and
[42:04] grace to be with them, each one, Lord.
[42:06] But with those that have come, Lord, we
[42:08] pray a special blessing to them, Lord,
[42:09] for being faithful, Lord. And we pray
[42:11] your grace that you have ministered to
[42:13] them as well this night, Lord. We ask
[42:15] all these things. Commit this service
[42:16] now into your hands. In Jesus Christ's
[42:19] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[42:22] you. Turn if you would to First John
[42:24] chapter
[42:25] 4. 1 John chapter 4. Amen. A smaller
[42:29] group here tonight and certainly sorry
[42:31] to hear those that are not feeling well.
[42:34] We all know what that's like, but just
[42:36] trusting God to reach down and touch
[42:37] them each one. Amen. Amen. First John
[42:41] chapter 4 and verse 18. and and uh very
[42:45] familiar
[42:48] scripture. He says there is no fear in
[42:51] love. None. Zero. Nada. There is no fear
[42:56] in love. But perfect love casteth out
[42:59] fear. So how do you go from no fear to
[43:02] love? How do you get a life where you
[43:04] live without fear? You've got to get
[43:06] into perfect love. He says and perfect
[43:08] love casteth out fear. He says because
[43:10] fear had torment. He that fearth is not
[43:14] made perfect in love. Amen. God bless
[43:16] you. You can have your seats this
[43:18] evening. I'm coming back to our series
[43:19] on on the the Holy Ghost that we're
[43:22] calling the token life. And we remember
[43:24] what Jesus said. He said, "My words,
[43:25] they are spirit and they are life."
[43:27] They're not just dead letters. They're
[43:28] not just words written on a page, but
[43:30] they're the very thoughts of God.
[43:32] They're the intentions of God. They're
[43:34] the attributes of God. Amen. And they're
[43:36] meant to be living thoughts. They're
[43:37] meant to be in our life. And we're
[43:39] supposed to be expressing them. And the
[43:40] only way we can do that is by the token
[43:42] life of the Holy Ghost. That we have the
[43:44] life of God inside of us. And the
[43:46] scripture says that's what our life is
[43:47] supposed to be. Paul said, "In him we
[43:49] move, live and move and have our being."
[43:52] Everything that we are is supposed to be
[43:53] enveloped. It's supposed to be wrapped
[43:55] up in Christ. But I want to take us down
[43:57] a bit of a different direction on that
[43:59] thought for the next couple of services.
[44:01] And we're going to be speaking on a a
[44:03] subtitle of No Room for Fear. Amen. No
[44:06] room for fear. And I don't know how long
[44:08] it's going to take. I've got a lot
[44:09] laying there and I've been talking to
[44:11] some people over the the last few months
[44:13] about aspects of this and just trusting
[44:15] that the Lord will take us in the
[44:17] direction he wants. But we want to talk
[44:19] about no room for fear. And he said in
[44:22] the start he says perfect love casteth
[44:24] out fear. So if we're fearful, if we're
[44:26] making fearful decisions, if we have
[44:28] moments of fear, if we're worried, if
[44:30] we're anxious, it's perfect love that's
[44:32] going to do the work that's required
[44:33] there. And we know that's the Holy Ghost
[44:35] itself. But I want to take us back to
[44:37] Romans 8 this evening because this is
[44:39] just one of the greatest chapters of the
[44:41] scripture. Brother Paul Coffee was
[44:42] saying, he said, "I think Romans 8 is
[44:44] the greatest because it's encouraging.
[44:45] It's positive. It's prophetic. It's
[44:47] teaching. It it positionally places you.
[44:49] It gives you kind of a a great picture
[44:52] of the whole experience of what it means
[44:53] to have the new birth and receive the
[44:55] Holy Ghost in your life." And I want to
[44:57] just start here in Romans 8 and 14.
[44:59] We're kind of picking up where we left
[45:01] off from before Easter. And Paul said,
[45:03] and we we read this before and and we're
[45:05] going to get into what this really looks
[45:07] like. And Paul said, "For as many as are
[45:11] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[45:14] sons of God." And this this idea of
[45:16] being led by the spirit plays directly
[45:17] into this thought tonight and into what
[45:19] we read next even in the scripture. And
[45:21] that's that spirit-led children of God
[45:24] have a different mindset and they have a
[45:26] different approach and a different
[45:27] attitude to how they deal with things in
[45:29] life. We could say they have a
[45:31] particular mindset and it's not that of
[45:33] the world. It's in contrast to what they
[45:35] had before. And Paul says it this way.
[45:37] He says, "For ye have not received the
[45:40] spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye
[45:45] have received the spirit of adoption,
[45:47] whereby we cry, Abba, Father." He said,
[45:49] "The spirit itself beareth witness with
[45:51] our spirit that we are the children of
[45:53] God. And if we're children, then we are
[45:55] heirs. We are heirs of God, joints with
[45:58] Christ. If so be that we suffer with him
[46:01] that we may be also glorified together.
[46:04] Now I want to come back to that verse 15
[46:06] and it's where we'll be focused on this
[46:08] evening and throughout this series.
[46:09] Certainly Paul says ye have not received
[46:12] the spirit of bondage. That word bondage
[46:14] means the spirit of slavery and
[46:17] servitude. So he says you haven't
[46:19] received the spirit of slavery or
[46:21] servitude. And then he says you haven't
[46:23] received it again. In other words, you
[46:25] had it before and now you're going back
[46:28] to it. In other words, he's saying you
[46:30] used to have this and you don't have it
[46:31] now as spiritfilled Christians. Then he
[46:33] says, you've not received the bondage of
[46:35] spirit again to fear. That word fear
[46:38] means to be in terror or fleeing or
[46:41] trying to save yourself. So if we were
[46:43] to take all those those words and
[46:45] resubstitute them back into this, then
[46:48] Paul would be saying, you have not
[46:49] received the spirit of slavery to go
[46:52] back to terror and trying to save
[46:55] yourself, but you have received the
[46:57] spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba,
[47:00] Father." So there's a spirit of terror.
[47:02] There's a spirit of trying to save
[47:04] yourself that we had before we ever
[47:06] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[47:08] And it's trying to take us back to that.
[47:11] Okay? Anyone that's come out from
[47:13] Catholicism can tell us exactly what
[47:14] this looks like. And maybe you don't
[47:15] need to hear me preach this tonight. But
[47:17] I want to preach about the mindset of
[47:19] fear that can come over the believer and
[47:21] can get them in a grip where they're
[47:22] doing everything because they're scared.
[47:25] And that is never Christ, church. That
[47:27] is never Christ. To do things out of
[47:29] fear is a spirit of bondage. It's a
[47:31] spirit of terror. And it belongs to
[47:33] Satan. It never belongs to the
[47:35] Christian. Now, what is the spirit of
[47:37] bondage that resulted in fear? you I say
[47:39] it's satanic today because there was a
[47:43] time where it was of God certainly to a
[47:45] degree and if we go back to Romans 8 and
[47:47] verse one it says Paul says there's
[47:49] therefore now no condemnation to them
[47:51] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[47:53] after the flesh but after the spirit he
[47:56] said for the law of the spirit of life
[47:58] in Christ Jesus has made me free from
[48:00] the law of sin and death. He said that
[48:02] the righteousness of the law might be
[48:04] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[48:06] flesh, but who walk after the spirit.
[48:09] For they that are after the flesh do
[48:11] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[48:13] that are after the spirit, the things of
[48:15] the spirit. He says, for to be carnally
[48:17] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[48:20] minded is life and peace. So he said,
[48:23] you there is a law of the spirit of life
[48:25] in Christ Jesus, but there used to be a
[48:27] law of sin and death. And you'll find
[48:29] that where there's a law, there's a
[48:30] spirit that goes with it. Okay? There's
[48:33] something that's behind it, there's a
[48:34] life that's behind it, there's an
[48:36] attitude or a mindset. So, we look here
[48:38] and what is the spirit of bondage that
[48:40] Paul spoke of deeper in Romans 8? What
[48:43] is that spirit of fear? It's to be
[48:44] carnally minded and to be under the law
[48:47] of sin and death, under the law of dos
[48:50] and don'ts. It's to be under a law of
[48:53] works whereby we look at what we're
[48:55] doing and we either give ourselves a big
[48:57] thumbs up or we go and we huddle in the
[49:00] corner and we're just waiting for God to
[49:03] drop the hammer on us and judge us and
[49:06] condemn us or for plagues to break out
[49:08] in our body or for us to fall over dead
[49:11] or for life to fall apart because we did
[49:13] something we know we ought not to do.
[49:15] That's a spirit of slavery. That's a
[49:18] spirit of slavery. And so we we've got
[49:20] this idea conjured up in our head.
[49:22] What's going to happen if I do this? And
[49:24] then we do it and then we're just
[49:25] sitting there waiting for it all to
[49:27] happen. It's funny. I'll make it may
[49:30] make you laugh this evening. I never
[49:32] touched a woman until I married my wife
[49:34] because I was scared that the minute I
[49:36] touched a woman, she'd get
[49:39] pregnant. That's a spirit of fear. But
[49:41] it protected me. For a time it was good
[49:46] because until you get the spirit of
[49:48] Christ, spirit of fear will work just
[49:50] fine. But it's not what God intends. God
[49:53] is not trying to keep us under fear. God
[49:55] is trying to protect us. God's trying to
[49:57] keep us. God's trying to preserve us.
[49:59] But that God is not looking for us to
[50:01] live under a life of dos and don'ts
[50:03] based on what the results are going to
[50:05] look like. He's trying to bring us into
[50:07] a different spirit, into a different
[50:09] attitude. Okay. So I want to jump now to
[50:11] Hebrews chapter 10. And Paul says this,
[50:14] "For if we s sin willfully after that
[50:17] we've received the knowledge of the
[50:18] truth, there remainth no more sacrifice
[50:20] for sins." That ought to make you
[50:23] fearful. No more sacrifice for sins. If
[50:26] there's no sacrifice for sins, you
[50:27] cannot be redeemed. You can't come into
[50:30] the presence of God. You're lost because
[50:32] you're dead in your sins. He says, "But
[50:34] but if if we do that, there's no more
[50:36] sacrifice for sins. But there is a
[50:38] certain fearful looking for of judgment
[50:41] and fiery indignation which shall devour
[50:44] the
[50:45] adversaries."
[50:46] Whoa. That sounds like God's hammer
[50:49] coming down, doesn't it? The wrath and
[50:51] the might and the anger of God coming
[50:53] down. And then he then Paul takes us
[50:55] back and he says, "He that despised
[50:57] Moses' law." So anyone that rejected by
[51:00] disobedience Moses law died without
[51:04] mercy under two or three witnesses. Now
[51:07] I want to look at that thought of si
[51:09] that line or phrase of sin willfully
[51:11] because we look at that and we think
[51:12] that it's a law. It's it's about dos and
[51:15] don'ts because he points back to Moses
[51:17] and he points back to the law. But
[51:19] that's not what's really meant there
[51:21] because you'll find your dos and don'ts
[51:23] go back to something beyond dos and
[51:25] don'ts. There has to be something behind
[51:27] it. So we have to remember what sin is
[51:29] and then we can figure out what sinning
[51:31] willfully is also about. And if we look
[51:33] at the original sin, what was it? Who
[51:36] did it? What was the actual sin there?
[51:39] According to Paul, Adam was not the one
[51:41] who sinned. It was his wife who sinned.
[51:43] It was Eve that sinned. In first
[51:45] Timothy, he said Adam was not deceived,
[51:47] but the woman being deceived was in the
[51:49] transgression. In other words, he says
[51:50] Adam did not sin. The woman
[51:54] sinned. She she crossed the law of God.
[51:58] And yet, if you were to read the Bible
[52:00] just casually, you would say, "Brother
[52:02] John, they both did the same thing." And
[52:04] they did both do the same thing. But
[52:07] what was it that they did before they
[52:09] did the same thing? It was not the same
[52:11] thing. Are you still with me? What they
[52:14] did before their actions was completely
[52:16] different. The mindset and the approach
[52:18] of what happened. Remember what was the
[52:20] difference between Adam and the woman.
[52:22] Paul says Adam or or sorry between Adam
[52:25] and the woman he says Adam was not
[52:27] deceived. The woman was deceived. She
[52:30] was deceived into believing a lie and
[52:33] she chose to believe the lie of the
[52:35] serpent when he said, "Thou shalt not
[52:38] surely die." After God had said, "Thou
[52:40] shalt surely die." The Satan said one
[52:43] thing and then God's word said another.
[52:46] And so the serpent contradicted God's
[52:48] word and Eve disobeyed God's word.
[52:51] because she disbelieved God's word and
[52:54] that led her to disobey God's word. Adam
[52:57] did not disbelieve God's word but he did
[53:00] obey it. So if they both did the same
[53:03] action in disobeying that was not the
[53:05] sin. The sin was what happened before
[53:07] that which is that Eve disbelieved the
[53:10] word of God. Adam did not disbelieve the
[53:12] word of God. Adam believed the word of
[53:14] God but he accepted the consequences
[53:17] with a with an open mind. He knew going
[53:20] in what it was going to be. At least
[53:22] intellectually he had some concept.
[53:24] Amen. So the the the sin is not what you
[53:27] do. Sin is what you believe or what you
[53:30] disbelieve as the case be would be. Sin
[53:32] is unbelief. Everything you do under
[53:34] that is just the attributes of sin. But
[53:36] because it's all tied to that unbelief,
[53:38] it's all under the same umbrella. And so
[53:40] we say it's all sin. And it is all sin.
[53:42] It's all under the umbrella of unbelief.
[53:45] But I want to take us back to root
[53:46] principles on this this morning or this
[53:48] evening just so we can anchor this in
[53:50] before we move on because it's key to
[53:52] moving forward into this into this
[53:53] thought that we have this evening and
[53:55] moving forward the rest of the week in
[53:56] that Paul said this. He's speaking now
[53:59] of the children of Israel. He says, "But
[54:02] with whom was he grieved 40 years?"
[54:04] Speaking of God, who is it that angered
[54:06] God? Who is it that grieved God? He
[54:09] said, "Was it not them that had sinned
[54:11] whose carcasses that fell in the
[54:13] wilderness?" He says, "Isn't it the
[54:14] people that sinned whose bodies fell and
[54:17] died in the wilderness?" He says, "Isn't
[54:19] that who grieved God?" Those that
[54:21] sinned. He says, "And to whom swearing
[54:23] that they should not enter into his
[54:25] rest, but to them that believed not." To
[54:30] those that disbelieved, he says, "So we
[54:32] see that they could not enter in because
[54:35] of
[54:35] sin." He says, "Because of unbelief."
[54:39] What is their sin? Their sin was
[54:41] unbelief. Remember the children of
[54:43] Israel did a lot of sinning on the road
[54:45] from Egypt to Canaan. We could say,
[54:47] listen, Aaron, they they told Aaron to
[54:50] create to them a god that they could
[54:51] worship. He made them a golden calf.
[54:53] They worshiped it. They got into all
[54:55] kinds of sensual worship. Then they went
[54:57] and they murmured against Moses. They
[54:59] threatened to kill him. They complained
[55:01] to God. They they they joined with Balum
[55:04] into that that sensual worship, which is
[55:06] exactly what they're doing today,
[55:07] blending sensuality with the beliefs
[55:09] that that were written and given to
[55:10] them. And they did all these things. And
[55:13] church, if God was wanting to judge
[55:15] them, he had every opportunity to judge
[55:19] them. And God did judge them at times.
[55:21] He brought a a a response to the things
[55:24] that they did. Amen. They backslid
[55:27] constantly. But it's a curious thing
[55:29] that God now looking back through
[55:31] history, speaking to Paul, he says,
[55:34] Paul, they didn't they weren't dead in
[55:37] the in the wilderness because of what
[55:39] they did. It's because of what they
[55:41] thought. It's because of how they
[55:43] responded to the word of God. Amen. God
[55:46] never judged them for wanting to go back
[55:48] to Egypt. God never judged them just for
[55:51] for worshiping the golden calf. But he
[55:53] judged them because when he came up to
[55:55] the land that he had promised them, they
[55:57] said, "We cannot do it." And he had
[56:00] said, "I'm going to take you in. I'm
[56:02] going to drive them out. They'll be I
[56:04] I'll go before you and drive the
[56:06] inhabitants out. I'll put the fear of
[56:08] you in them. you're going to get through
[56:10] it. And they said, "No, we can't do it."
[56:13] That's when God judged
[56:15] them forever. They are eternally
[56:18] separated from God for their
[56:22] unbelief. And the only ones that went in
[56:24] were Joshua and Caleb. And what did
[56:26] Joshua and Caleb say? We are more than
[56:29] able to take the country. We're more
[56:31] than conquerors. That's the mindset of a
[56:34] child of God. We're more than
[56:36] conquerors. They took God at his word.
[56:38] Uh Joshua and Caleb believed
[56:42] God. It doesn't say that Joshua and
[56:44] Caleb never did anything wrong. They
[56:46] didn't join in the other things, that's
[56:47] for sure. But they weren't perfect men,
[56:50] but they believed God. And that's what
[56:52] God's looking at. You'll see that God
[56:54] looks time and time again at the heart.
[56:56] God is not trying to judge us. God's
[56:59] trying to get us across the finish line,
[57:00] but he needs people that will believe
[57:02] him. And so God coming through Paul, he
[57:06] says, "Listen, the problem with those
[57:07] people was that they didn't believe my
[57:09] word." And that was their sin. Their sin
[57:11] was that they couldn't take me at your
[57:14] word. And so, we'll see this time and
[57:15] time again through scriptures. God will
[57:17] discipline you based on your actions.
[57:20] But God is not wanting to judge you. God
[57:23] is wanting to get you into the blessings
[57:25] and the promises of his word. And those
[57:27] people, they disbelieve the word. They
[57:29] disbelieve the prophet. They disbelieve
[57:31] the messenger. And for that, God God let
[57:33] them die in the wilderness. He said,
[57:34] "That's it. You're done." He let it go
[57:37] for a while, but then he said, "That's
[57:38] it. It's all done." But remember, David
[57:41] should have
[57:43] died. You talk about sinning. David
[57:46] committed murder. David committed
[57:48] adultery. But here's the thing. Nobody
[57:50] knew everything that David
[57:53] did. But the prophet comes and he tells
[57:55] David a story. And David gets all worked
[57:57] up in in his self-righteous nature for
[58:00] that day.
[58:01] And he says, "The man that did this
[58:03] should die." And Nathan the prophet
[58:04] says, "Thou art the man." And what did
[58:06] David do? He says, "You're right." And
[58:07] he
[58:09] repented. David should have died. But
[58:12] you'll notice God didn't kill him
[58:15] because you have to remember, and we'll
[58:16] read this a little bit, under the law,
[58:18] you had to have two or three witnesses.
[58:20] David only had one witness for saying to
[58:22] kill Uriah, and that was the messenger
[58:25] he sent to Joab. That was the only one.
[58:28] And for adultery, there were no
[58:30] witnesses particular to that. But you
[58:34] see what God did. God still disciplined
[58:36] David. The baby didn't live. The baby
[58:39] didn't live. God judged David for what
[58:41] he did, but he didn't kill him. God's
[58:43] not trying to kill people. God's not
[58:45] trying to destroy our lives based on one
[58:47] bad decision. That's not the nature of
[58:48] God. God's trying to preserve us. God's
[58:51] trying to keep us. He's trying to
[58:52] protect us. And that's why he tells us
[58:53] do this and it's why he tells us don't
[58:56] do that.
[58:57] Okay. But the the the requirement, the
[59:00] antidote to sin and the law of sin and
[59:04] death has always been one thing. Believe
[59:06] the word of God. Believe the word of
[59:08] God. Remember what Jesus said in John 6.
[59:10] He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[59:12] you, he that believeth on me hath
[59:14] everlasting life." You believe it,
[59:16] you'll do it. And if you do it, it'll
[59:18] take you where God wants you to go. He
[59:20] says, "I am that bread of life. Your
[59:21] fathers did eat mana in the wilderness
[59:23] and are dead. They ate the supernatural
[59:25] heavenly food of angels and they still
[59:28] died. This is the bread himself, he
[59:31] says, which cometh down from heaven that
[59:33] a man may eat thereof and not die. I am
[59:35] the living bread which came down from
[59:38] heaven. And if any man eat of this
[59:40] bread, he shall live forever. And the
[59:42] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[59:44] I will give for the life of the world.
[59:45] We spoke last service how that communion
[59:47] is the remember Jesus said, "This is my
[59:49] body which is broken for you and this is
[59:51] my blood which is shed for you.
[59:54] What is his body? He is the word. So
[59:57] when you eat his flesh, what are you
[59:59] saying? It's what we read in Revelation
[1:00:00] 10. You're saying, "Give me the book.
[1:00:02] Give me the word and let me eat it. Let
[1:00:04] me it become a part of me. Make it one
[1:00:06] with me and then I can produce the word
[1:00:08] all over again." And then what is the
[1:00:10] blood? The blood is the carrier of life.
[1:00:13] What is the life? It's the spirit of
[1:00:14] God. So you take the spirit of God and
[1:00:16] you combine it with the word and what do
[1:00:17] you have? The living word. You have the
[1:00:20] living word all over again. That's what
[1:00:21] Christ was. And that's eternal life is
[1:00:23] when you have Christ, the word living
[1:00:24] inside of you. So the antidote of sin
[1:00:27] and death is to accept and act upon the
[1:00:29] word of God. That's what Joshua and
[1:00:31] Caleb did. They acted on the word of
[1:00:33] God. And God blessed them. And he says,
[1:00:34] "For their faith, they'll go in." And
[1:00:36] I'll give them a spot in there just for
[1:00:38] themselves. So if we come back, we're
[1:00:40] making a big circle this evening to
[1:00:42] Hebrews 10. And it says, "For if we sin
[1:00:45] willfully," let's put the word in. If we
[1:00:47] disbelieve willfully after that we've
[1:00:50] received the knowledge of the truth,
[1:00:51] there remainth no more sacrifice for
[1:00:53] sins, but a certain fearful looking for
[1:00:55] of judgment and fiery indignation which
[1:00:58] shall devour the adversaries. He that
[1:01:00] despised Moses law die without mercy
[1:01:02] under two or three witnesses. I'm not
[1:01:03] here to preach a fire and brimstone
[1:01:05] service tonight. Far from it. But that
[1:01:08] you can take and you think, well,
[1:01:10] brother John, I heard the word once and
[1:01:11] I didn't accept it. Does that mean I'm
[1:01:12] lost? No. God has a time. God has a
[1:01:15] season. Amen. And God will hold you
[1:01:17] accountable eventually. But that's
[1:01:19] between you and God. There are people
[1:01:21] that don't get saved until they're old.
[1:01:24] And there's people that get saved at a
[1:01:25] very young age. There's people that
[1:01:27] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost at
[1:01:28] a very young age. That's between you and
[1:01:30] God. But I'll tell you, if there's a
[1:01:32] pull in your heart, move then. That's
[1:01:35] the time to move because God's moving.
[1:01:37] If it if it's going that way, I would
[1:01:39] say it this way. He says, "Now he that
[1:01:40] what willfully? He that sins, and what
[1:01:43] is sin? It's unbelief. He that will turn
[1:01:45] his back on truth when it's presented to
[1:01:48] him, there remainth no more sacrifice
[1:01:50] for sin. He that disbelieves willfully
[1:01:53] after truth has been presented to him
[1:01:55] because his church believes different.
[1:01:57] That's when you cross the line. He has a
[1:01:59] knowledge of the truth and won't accept
[1:02:00] it. He says drinking, smoking, gambling,
[1:02:03] doing evil things, that isn't sin.
[1:02:05] That's the attributes of unbelief. You
[1:02:08] do that because you're an
[1:02:11] unbeliever. Now, we don't do any of
[1:02:13] these things. I I I'm pretty sure. I'm
[1:02:16] pretty sure. But there are some things
[1:02:18] we do and you'd say, "Well, Brother
[1:02:20] John, does that make me an unbeliever?"
[1:02:22] That may make you an unbeliever about
[1:02:23] that area of your life. It may be an
[1:02:25] area of your life that you haven't truly
[1:02:27] given over to God. You haven't made him
[1:02:28] Lord of your life in that area. But I'll
[1:02:30] tell you one thing, if he wants it out,
[1:02:32] he's going to work on you. He'll he'll
[1:02:34] work on you, and that's okay. But let
[1:02:37] him work on you. Don't let everybody
[1:02:39] else work on you, cuz it won't they
[1:02:41] won't take it out, and they won't keep
[1:02:42] it out. they won't replace it with
[1:02:44] anything else. Sometimes we can put so
[1:02:46] much pressure on somebody to change
[1:02:47] because we know that what they're doing
[1:02:48] is wrong. And if we do it prematurely
[1:02:50] before God is moving, then you know what
[1:02:52] happens? They go in worse than ever. We
[1:02:54] cause a failure by our religious
[1:02:56] pressure. Even with the best of
[1:02:59] intentions. Even with the best of
[1:03:01] intentions, he says you do that because
[1:03:03] you're an unbeliever. If you are a
[1:03:05] believer, you would not do those things.
[1:03:07] It bears the fruit what? it. The spirit
[1:03:09] of God bears the fruit of peace, joy,
[1:03:11] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[1:03:12] holiness. That's the fruits of the
[1:03:14] spirit. He says, "But the fruits of the
[1:03:16] evil spirit is doubt." He says, "He that
[1:03:19] believeth not is condemned already. Then
[1:03:22] if the truth comes to you in such a way
[1:03:23] that you have a knowledge of it, and
[1:03:25] then refuse to receive it, there remains
[1:03:28] no more sacrifice for your sin, but a
[1:03:30] fearful looking toward of judgment,
[1:03:32] which is what we just read in Hebrews."
[1:03:34] But I want to take us back from here now
[1:03:36] back to the way that this mindset came
[1:03:39] about and what it produced because you
[1:03:41] can have two people that read the exact
[1:03:43] same book that read the exact same Bible
[1:03:45] and come out completely differently. And
[1:03:47] it's based on the spirit that's on them
[1:03:49] when they're reading it. Okay? So, we'll
[1:03:52] see that when it comes to Jesus day,
[1:03:54] after a couple thousand years of reading
[1:03:56] the laws and the books of Moses and the
[1:03:58] prophets, you had people that turned out
[1:04:00] completely differently reading the exact
[1:04:02] same material, sitting under the exact
[1:04:04] same ministries in many case. And what
[1:04:06] happened was they took Moses law and
[1:04:08] they started working on it and they
[1:04:09] started trying to fulfill it and they
[1:04:11] produced a problem. And that problem was
[1:04:14] that they magnified it in a way that God
[1:04:15] never intended. And it led the people
[1:04:17] into bondage and it led them into a a a
[1:04:20] religion that destroyed them in the end.
[1:04:23] So we're going to go back and we're
[1:04:24] going to look at this idea of God
[1:04:26] sending the law and the mentality that
[1:04:28] came with it and the intentions of God
[1:04:29] even behind it. So we're going to look
[1:04:31] at Leviticus 18. It says, "And the Lord
[1:04:33] spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the
[1:04:36] children of Israel and say unto them, I
[1:04:39] am the Lord your God."
[1:04:41] And now God starts to lay down some
[1:04:42] rules. He starts to lay down some
[1:04:44] guidelines. He says, "After the doings
[1:04:45] of the land of Egypt, wherein you dwell,
[1:04:47] you shall not do it." So he says, "The
[1:04:49] way they did things in Egypt, you're not
[1:04:51] going to do it." And he says, "And after
[1:04:53] the doings of the land of Canaan,
[1:04:55] whether I bring you shall you not do."
[1:04:57] He says, "So you can't do what you what
[1:04:58] they do where you left, and you can't do
[1:05:00] what they're doing where you're going."
[1:05:02] He said, he says, "Neither shall you
[1:05:04] walk in their ordinances. So you can't
[1:05:06] have the traditions of what you're
[1:05:07] leaving. You can't have the traditions
[1:05:08] of where you're going. You need
[1:05:10] something
[1:05:11] different. And verse four, he says, "You
[1:05:14] shall do my judgments and keep mine
[1:05:17] ordinances to walk therein. I am the
[1:05:20] Lord your God." So God is drawing now a
[1:05:22] separating line. Okay? There's one thing
[1:05:24] that God is. He's a separator. He's
[1:05:27] drawing a line between the the children
[1:05:29] of God, the chosen of God, and everyone
[1:05:31] else. And he says, "You cannot live a
[1:05:35] life like everybody else.
[1:05:37] you can't do it. He says, "I'm going to
[1:05:40] set guidelines for you. I'm going to set
[1:05:42] laws. I'm going to set ordinances. I'm
[1:05:43] going to set requirements before you.
[1:05:45] And those shall you do because I am the
[1:05:47] Lord your God." And then he says this.
[1:05:51] Now, he's doing all this based on his
[1:05:53] original design. He's got a he's got a
[1:05:55] reason for doing this. Okay? We'll see
[1:05:57] this as we go. He's got these these
[1:05:58] these root principles, these root design
[1:06:01] principles that he's built into the
[1:06:02] earth. And that's what he's trying to do
[1:06:04] here. He says, "So you shall do my
[1:06:05] judgments and keep mine ordinances to
[1:06:07] walk therein. I am the Lord your God."
[1:06:09] He says, "Ye shall therefore keep my
[1:06:11] statutes and my judgments, which if a
[1:06:14] man do, he shall live in them. I am the
[1:06:16] Lord." You go to a different version, it
[1:06:18] says, "Keep my statutes and ordinances.
[1:06:20] A person will live if he does them. I am
[1:06:23] the Lord." And then he'd continue now
[1:06:25] through Leviticus 18. And he'd say,
[1:06:27] "Now, don't do this as such and such a
[1:06:28] group does, and don't do this as such
[1:06:30] and such a group does, and be careful
[1:06:32] not to do this, and be careful about not
[1:06:34] to do that." And he talked a lot about
[1:06:35] sexual sin. He talked a lot about
[1:06:37] idolatry. He talked about offering your
[1:06:39] children as a sacrifice. He talked about
[1:06:41] fraud. He talked about playing a joke on
[1:06:44] a blind person and tripping them
[1:06:47] up. He says, "You don't put a stumbling
[1:06:49] block in front of a blind
[1:06:51] person." I guess maybe that was
[1:06:53] something that they did back then.
[1:06:56] because it would be
[1:06:57] hilarious. No, it wouldn't. And then he
[1:07:01] would talk about avenging yourself and
[1:07:03] bearing
[1:07:05] grudges. Okay, catch that. Sexual sin,
[1:07:09] idolatry, offering your children to a
[1:07:12] fiery sacrifice before Molech and
[1:07:15] grudges. And he says, "You don't do any
[1:07:17] of
[1:07:18] it." God equates grudges and sexual
[1:07:22] immorality the same in this chapter.
[1:07:24] That's pretty heavy-handed, isn't it?
[1:07:27] That's
[1:07:27] serious. That ought to tell us how
[1:07:29] serious it is when we've got a problem
[1:07:31] with a brother or sister and how we act
[1:07:33] in those
[1:07:34] things. And then he would say this, he
[1:07:37] finished the chapter. He goes down, he
[1:07:38] lays out a bunch of rules. God gave 613,
[1:07:41] I think, rules to the Israelites. A lot
[1:07:44] of rules. And then he says, "For who
[1:07:46] whosoever shall commit any of these
[1:07:48] abominations, including
[1:07:50] grudges, even the souls that commit them
[1:07:53] shall be cut off from among the people.
[1:07:55] You'll be kicked out if you did these
[1:07:56] things he told you not to do." And that
[1:07:58] was a big deal because if you were
[1:07:59] kicked out from the the the children of
[1:08:01] Israel, you were out from the presence
[1:08:03] of God because Moses was there and the t
[1:08:06] and the the the tabernacle was there and
[1:08:08] the presence of God was there. The word
[1:08:10] of God was there. If you left the
[1:08:11] people, you left Moses, which means you
[1:08:13] left God, which means you were outside
[1:08:15] of God completely. You had no access to
[1:08:17] God. And so you were lost. It was
[1:08:19] eternal separation. Okay? He says, "So
[1:08:22] if you don't want to be lost," he says,
[1:08:23] "Keep mine ordinances that you commit
[1:08:26] not any one of these abominable customs
[1:08:29] which were committed before you, and
[1:08:31] that you defile not yourselves therein."
[1:08:33] The translation there is so that you
[1:08:35] don't make yourself unclean. And then he
[1:08:37] said again, I am the Lord your God. And
[1:08:40] then he starts to lay down more and more
[1:08:42] of these rules. And he he lays out a
[1:08:43] little a doozy of a scripture and I'm
[1:08:46] leading up to something. So stay with me
[1:08:47] here tonight. I know this is not a
[1:08:48] traditional service, but we're getting
[1:08:50] into a much bigger thought, but I want
[1:08:52] to show you how we get into some of
[1:08:54] these mindsets and and issues in our
[1:08:55] minds and the way we do things. And I'm
[1:08:58] just going to take my time. I'm not
[1:08:59] going to hurry with it. And so in
[1:09:01] Leviticus 19, this is the beautiful
[1:09:03] verse. God says, and this is in the CB
[1:09:05] version. And I I I thought it felt uh
[1:09:07] just a little more uh typical to us. God
[1:09:11] says you must keep my rules. And and and
[1:09:14] the intonation there is or
[1:09:17] else or else. Because under the law of
[1:09:20] Moses, everything was do this or else
[1:09:23] and don't do this or else. And the or
[1:09:26] else was usually death, punishment,
[1:09:29] heavy financial loss, public
[1:09:32] embarrassment.
[1:09:33] Nothing good came out of this if you did
[1:09:36] something that you weren't supposed to.
[1:09:38] It was always punishment and death for
[1:09:40] disobedience. And that's carried
[1:09:43] through into the church even today. And
[1:09:46] I'm not saying into this church, but I'm
[1:09:48] saying into many churches in general.
[1:09:50] It's this mindset where you preach
[1:09:52] death, hell, and damnation over
[1:09:55] everything that a person does. And so
[1:09:57] the mindset is that if I do anything
[1:09:59] wrong, then God's going to destroy my
[1:10:01] life because I knew
[1:10:04] better. But that's not what we see in
[1:10:06] the New Testament. It's an Old Testament
[1:10:08] mentality being brought into the gospel
[1:10:10] of Jesus Christ. I'm here to preach the
[1:10:13] gospel that takes us out from the law of
[1:10:15] sin and death. It brings us into the law
[1:10:17] of the spirit of life in Christ. And
[1:10:19] they have completely different mindsets.
[1:10:21] They have completely different
[1:10:23] responses. Okay?
[1:10:26] And so he says this, "You must keep my
[1:10:28] rules." Now, here's three rules, church.
[1:10:30] Do not
[1:10:31] crossbreed your animal
[1:10:34] species. Do not plant your field with
[1:10:36] two kinds of seed. And do not wear
[1:10:38] clothes made from two kinds of
[1:10:41] materials. God is saying this. This is
[1:10:45] not Moses. Moses is not making up. This
[1:10:47] is a heavenly directive to Moses here.
[1:10:51] It's not man's laws. It's not man's
[1:10:52] religion. These are requirements from
[1:10:54] God. Now, he doesn't say if you do it,
[1:10:56] you'll
[1:10:57] die. But why is God doing this? God's
[1:11:01] doing it to protect them. God's doing
[1:11:03] them to focus them. And he's doing them
[1:11:05] to keep the doing it to keep them
[1:11:07] obviously separate as well. Okay? These
[1:11:11] things are a reflection of the greater
[1:11:12] principle of God. And we'll see it as we
[1:11:14] punch through these this evening. First
[1:11:16] thing he says, don't crossbreed your
[1:11:17] species. God created what? Animals
[1:11:21] individually.
[1:11:22] You have families of animals that we
[1:11:25] would call a species. So you have wolves
[1:11:27] and dogs and coyotes and foxes. That is
[1:11:30] a set a set species. It's the canine,
[1:11:34] right? Then you have the horses. Then
[1:11:36] you have the cows and you have the
[1:11:37] elephants. He says don't try and blend
[1:11:40] them. So you can take an Arabian horse
[1:11:42] and you can blend it with a Morgan horse
[1:11:44] and that's completely fine because
[1:11:45] they're part of the same species, right?
[1:11:47] You get the Arabian's looks, you get the
[1:11:49] Mustang's
[1:11:51] endurance, and it turns into a beautiful
[1:11:53] thing perhaps. But what he's saying is
[1:11:56] don't take a horse and blend it with a
[1:11:58] cow. Then you get a
[1:12:00] how and the name tells you you shouldn't
[1:12:03] try it, right? He's saying don't try and
[1:12:05] blend it. I sometimes have wondered if
[1:12:07] perhaps the dinosaurs weren't the a
[1:12:09] product of this. That's just me. Of them
[1:12:12] blending things somehow, an unholy
[1:12:14] blending of things. God says, "Don't do
[1:12:16] it.
[1:12:17] Today, we've got people that are born a
[1:12:20] man and they think they're a woman.
[1:12:21] We've got people that are born a woman
[1:12:22] that think they're a man. We've got
[1:12:23] people that are born and think that
[1:12:24] they're both or neither. We've got
[1:12:26] people that are born and think they're
[1:12:27] animals. You know how we know that's
[1:12:29] wrong, church? Because we know the
[1:12:31] scripture says God created man and he
[1:12:33] created a woman. Two individual groups
[1:12:37] within that species. And he didn't
[1:12:39] blend. He didn't combine them in any
[1:12:41] way. He created them distinctly. And
[1:12:43] God's saying, "Look, I've made things
[1:12:45] distinct. Stop trying to blend it. Don't
[1:12:48] try and and turn it into something that
[1:12:50] they weren't supposed to be. God
[1:12:51] separated them out from the beginning
[1:12:54] and he's saying, "Stop trying to mess up
[1:12:55] what I created. Stop trying to do
[1:12:57] something different with it." Then he
[1:12:59] says, "Don't plant your field with two
[1:13:01] kinds of seed." Now, in terms of impact,
[1:13:05] there's no reason you can't do this. I
[1:13:07] researched it. So, as far as I know,
[1:13:10] there's no reason not to do this. There
[1:13:13] are perhaps some practical reasons. If
[1:13:14] you plant two things that are completely
[1:13:16] different, if you plant corn with
[1:13:18] potatoes, well, we know potatoes are
[1:13:20] under the ground and they don't come up
[1:13:22] that high. Corn gets really tall. You've
[1:13:24] ever seen a corn field, they can go 8,
[1:13:25] 10 feet tall. If the corn gets so tall
[1:13:28] that the sunlight can't get to the
[1:13:29] potatoes, the warmth can't get there.
[1:13:30] Obviously, it's going to impact your
[1:13:32] potatoes. Not a good
[1:13:34] idea. But practically, it doesn't mean
[1:13:36] you won't get potatoes and corn. If you
[1:13:39] plant barley with wheat, they'll still
[1:13:41] grow together and they'll be just fine.
[1:13:42] But God's trying to set a pattern. Don't
[1:13:45] blend things that are different. He
[1:13:47] said, "Don't blend your religion. Don't
[1:13:49] blend your customs. Don't marry into
[1:13:51] them. Keep it separate." And he says,
[1:13:53] "Keep the separation through everything
[1:13:56] in your life. Keep it
[1:13:58] clean." Cuz I made it that way. And so
[1:14:01] don't introduce confusion. You think
[1:14:04] about it. If you've got two crops that
[1:14:06] mature at different times and you go and
[1:14:08] try and harvest one, what are you going
[1:14:10] to do to the other? you're going to
[1:14:11] damage or destroy it. In other words,
[1:14:13] he's saying you're going to waste time
[1:14:15] and energy and resources if you blend
[1:14:17] two things together. Don't do it in your
[1:14:19] fields. If you need corn and potatoes,
[1:14:22] have a corn field and have a potato
[1:14:24] field. Leave them separate. But there's
[1:14:27] nothing spiritually wrong here. But God
[1:14:30] says don't do it. He's trying to protect
[1:14:32] them from something that's going to have
[1:14:33] no benefit to them. There's nothing to
[1:14:35] be gained by doing
[1:14:37] this. Remember what scripture says? How
[1:14:39] can two walk together except they'd be
[1:14:41] agreed? That's what he's saying here.
[1:14:43] Two things aren't going to grow well
[1:14:44] together. Leave them alone. Plant them
[1:14:46] separately and things will go better.
[1:14:48] That's why believers can't marry
[1:14:49] unbelievers. I don't care how good a
[1:14:51] heart they have. I don't care how nice
[1:14:53] they are. I don't care how respectful
[1:14:55] they are. A believer cannot marry an
[1:14:57] unbeliever. Listen, if you believe this
[1:14:59] message, don't go marry a good Baptist.
[1:15:01] Don't go marry a good Pentecostal. Don't
[1:15:04] go marry a good nominal Christian,
[1:15:06] charismatic. No, it's not going to work.
[1:15:09] We're not the same. We're not the same.
[1:15:12] You can't do it. Amen. Why? Two
[1:15:14] different things are they don't
[1:15:18] blend. And when you're spiritually
[1:15:20] minded in a different way, it's never
[1:15:21] going to work. And I've seen it too many
[1:15:23] times in my life, people I've met,
[1:15:25] couples I've met, and one was a
[1:15:26] Christian and one wasn't. And guess
[1:15:27] what? It never turns out well. It never
[1:15:30] turns out well. Now look at this third
[1:15:32] one. He says, "Don't wear clothes made
[1:15:33] from two kinds of
[1:15:35] materials." Why? Cuz I'll go to hell.
[1:15:38] No, it has nothing to do with hell or
[1:15:41] heaven. The thing with materials is that
[1:15:43] they have a different stretch ratio.
[1:15:46] They have a different strength ratio.
[1:15:47] And so when you put the two of them
[1:15:49] together and in time as you wear them,
[1:15:52] as you wash them, they will stress and
[1:15:54] pull at the seams because they expand
[1:15:56] and they shrink at different rates. And
[1:15:59] so literally, the garment will fight
[1:16:01] itself. And if you do nothing more than
[1:16:03] wear it and wash it, it will destroy
[1:16:04] itself by internal friction and and
[1:16:08] stress. He's not saying you're
[1:16:09] unspiritual if you do it. He's saying
[1:16:11] you're
[1:16:13] stupid. He's saying don't do it. Why
[1:16:16] not? He never said why, church. Catch
[1:16:19] this. He never said why. He said just
[1:16:21] don't do it. What are we supposed to
[1:16:23] learn when God says don't do it? Don't
[1:16:26] do it. And say, Lord, I trust that
[1:16:28] you've got a purpose in this. And I'll
[1:16:30] tell you what, I guarantee you, somebody
[1:16:32] said, "I don't know why, and I'm going
[1:16:34] to do it." And you know what they found
[1:16:35] out? They found out it doesn't work.
[1:16:38] It's way easier to accept God when he
[1:16:40] says, "Don't do it. It doesn't work."
[1:16:42] Than to go in and find out God was
[1:16:44] right. Once again, because he's always
[1:16:45] right. The word is always right. We're
[1:16:48] grinning, but sometimes we do it. We go
[1:16:50] in, remember they they put a sign on a
[1:16:52] bench. It says, "Wet paint, do not
[1:16:54] touch." What does every man do? We go up
[1:16:56] and see if that was if that was written
[1:16:58] for us. cuz it might be dry now. We want
[1:17:01] to see how wet that paint really is.
[1:17:04] Kids do it all the time. You tell them
[1:17:06] not to do it. They want to find out for
[1:17:07] themselves. Church, don't find out for
[1:17:09] yourself. God's trying to preserve you.
[1:17:11] God's trying to keep you from doing
[1:17:12] things.
[1:17:13] Okay? God's trying to drive home a
[1:17:16] principle here. Keep separate what God
[1:17:19] has made
[1:17:20] separate. And that's a that's a way to
[1:17:22] live our life. Stay separate the way God
[1:17:25] has told us to stay separate. And the
[1:17:27] thing is is that people take these
[1:17:29] things and they try and modify them.
[1:17:30] They try to improve them. They try and
[1:17:32] blend them. They try and do all these
[1:17:34] things. And I think that's been one of
[1:17:35] the greatest detriments to Christianity
[1:17:37] is that they've tried to improve on
[1:17:38] something that God has already laid out.
[1:17:40] God lays out a plan. God lays out a
[1:17:42] purpose. God lays out structure. God
[1:17:44] lays out all of these things. And then
[1:17:46] they take it and they take God's program
[1:17:48] and they try and improve it. They try
[1:17:49] and make it more palatable. They try and
[1:17:51] make it more inclusive. Come on. I've
[1:17:54] shared some things with some of the
[1:17:55] brothers and even my wife. These things
[1:17:57] that they're trying to make
[1:17:58] inclusive. I saw one today where they
[1:18:01] took the movie The Princess Bride and
[1:18:02] they turned it into the the death,
[1:18:04] crucifixion, and the crucifixion, death,
[1:18:07] and and uh resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:10] Why would you take a movie to represent
[1:18:12] the very thing of Christ? But what are
[1:18:14] they doing? They're trying to attract
[1:18:17] people. They're trying to make it
[1:18:19] palatable. Church, this gospel is not
[1:18:22] inclusive. It's
[1:18:24] exclusive. Come out of her, my people.
[1:18:26] That's what it says in the book of
[1:18:28] Revelation. It calls you out. The gospel
[1:18:31] is never mainstream. You want to know if
[1:18:34] somebody's preaching the word? If it's
[1:18:36] mainstream, it's
[1:18:38] wrong. Easy. Easy. Because the world
[1:18:42] will align with the world. And so, if
[1:18:45] the world will align with it, if the
[1:18:47] majority will align with it, I guarantee
[1:18:49] you it's wrong somewhere. It's wrong
[1:18:52] somewhere. It's never mainstream. The
[1:18:53] gospel is never mainstream. The word is
[1:18:55] never mainstream. It's always in
[1:18:57] minority. That's why we needed after
[1:19:00] thousands of years and now 2,000 years
[1:19:02] of them falling from the Ephesian church
[1:19:04] age. That's why we needed that restoring
[1:19:06] prophet of Malachi 4 was to go in and
[1:19:09] restore us back to what was what had
[1:19:11] been lost because it was so messed up by
[1:19:13] people trying to make the gospel
[1:19:15] palatable. Sharing with brother Mark
[1:19:17] today. He he had sent something over to
[1:19:19] me and I sent something back where
[1:19:20] there's this man that's a very
[1:19:22] well-known theologian and he says the
[1:19:24] reason there's a debate on whether the
[1:19:26] gifts of the spirit and the working of
[1:19:28] the spirit is here today as it was in
[1:19:30] the apostles he says is because it's not
[1:19:32] here. He says if it was here we'd have
[1:19:34] no debate. But the thing is it's not in
[1:19:37] his church. That's why there's no
[1:19:38] debate.
[1:19:39] But all you have to do is is point him
[1:19:41] to a tape of brother Brandham and he'd
[1:19:44] see every aspect of Jesus Christ being
[1:19:47] presented in signs and wonders there.
[1:19:49] But he won't hear it because he doesn't
[1:19:50] want to hear it. It's only a debate for
[1:19:52] him. It's not a debate for us. We've got
[1:19:55] thus sayeth the Lord. We've seen Christ
[1:19:57] showing himself again in a prophetic
[1:19:59] ministry just like the Apostle Paul,
[1:20:01] just like Peter, just like John and
[1:20:03] those different ones. Just like Christ
[1:20:04] himself. Why? Because it's alpha and
[1:20:06] omega. It's Christ coming back down and
[1:20:08] revealing himself to his bride all over
[1:20:10] again. And what we have today then is a
[1:20:12] people worshiping Satan. It's a god of
[1:20:14] their own
[1:20:15] imagination. And remember what it says
[1:20:17] in I think it's in the book of Isaiah.
[1:20:18] It says Kabot is written over the door.
[1:20:20] The glory of the Lord has departed.
[1:20:22] Christ isn't in it. And yet they say
[1:20:24] they're worshiping him. And if Christ
[1:20:26] isn't there, there's only one other
[1:20:27] spirit church and that's Satan's. It's a
[1:20:30] sad
[1:20:31] thing. But I want to look at what
[1:20:33] happens as we take these things. Okay.
[1:20:35] So we we look at that and God is having
[1:20:37] this he's setting this principle. Keep
[1:20:38] things separate. I'm telling you for a
[1:20:40] reason. Keep it separate. Keep
[1:20:41] yourselves separate. Don't try and blend
[1:20:43] things. Don't try and modify things.
[1:20:45] Don't try and make things better.
[1:20:46] Natural is God's way. Natural is God's
[1:20:49] way. Why? Because he makes all things
[1:20:51] good. But we come now to Exodus 20. And
[1:20:54] this is God. Now he's giving the ten
[1:20:56] commandments. He says, "Six days shalt
[1:20:58] thou labor." He says, "And do all of thy
[1:21:01] work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath
[1:21:03] of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt
[1:21:05] not do any work. Thou nor thy son, nor
[1:21:07] thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor thy
[1:21:09] maidervant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
[1:21:10] stranger that is within thy gates." So
[1:21:12] everyone gets a break on the Sabbath,
[1:21:15] even the animals. He says, "For in six
[1:21:17] days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
[1:21:19] sea, and all that in them is, and rested
[1:21:21] the seventh day. Therefore the Lord
[1:21:23] blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed
[1:21:25] it." Now, I want to focus on that word
[1:21:27] work that I've I've put in blue there.
[1:21:28] That word work means occupation,
[1:21:31] craftsmanship and service. So I did some
[1:21:33] research on this and there are a few
[1:21:35] specific examples of what that means in
[1:21:37] scriptures. And by that I mean God
[1:21:39] himself told us what work was. Okay. So
[1:21:43] I went through and I formatted it for
[1:21:45] this. It looks like I I should have made
[1:21:47] this bigger but I'm doing it for a
[1:21:48] reason. So stay with me. Okay. God said
[1:21:50] there's four things that qualify as
[1:21:52] work. The first one is carrying things.
[1:21:55] And this was related to God giving them
[1:21:56] a double portion of mana on the sixth
[1:21:59] day so that they didn't have to get up,
[1:22:01] gather, and carry the mana back to their
[1:22:04] tents for food. So that's what it's tied
[1:22:06] to. That's Exodus 16:29. So he says,
[1:22:09] "You're not allowed to carry anything.
[1:22:10] I'll provide for you double on the sixth
[1:22:12] day so you don't have to carry anything
[1:22:14] on the seventh day." Then the other
[1:22:16] thing is that you're not allowed to
[1:22:17] light or burn or light a fire. And
[1:22:20] that's Exodus 35:3. We're going to talk
[1:22:22] about that in a moment. Then he said,
[1:22:24] "You're not allowed to plow your fields.
[1:22:26] You're not allowed to work your fields.
[1:22:28] And you're not allowed to reap what you
[1:22:29] put into your fields." And that's both
[1:22:31] in Exodus 34:21. Those are the only four
[1:22:34] things God said you're not allowed to
[1:22:36] do. Okay? God declared what he meant by
[1:22:40] work, by his own word. What have we been
[1:22:42] taught for so many years? The prophet
[1:22:44] God said, "God interprets his word by
[1:22:46] bringing it to pass. He'll tell you what
[1:22:48] you're supposed to do and not do, and
[1:22:50] he'll show you what's right and wrong."
[1:22:52] Now, that's pretty basic. If you said,
[1:22:54] brother, if I said, "People, on Sundays,
[1:22:56] we're not going to carry, burn, plow,
[1:22:58] reap." How hard is that? That's easy.
[1:23:01] That's easy. You can do anything except
[1:23:03] that, church, we could do that. I don't
[1:23:07] think that would be a burden. I don't
[1:23:08] think that would be hard to understand.
[1:23:11] Okay? God has given them time to worship
[1:23:14] him on a Sabbath. He's given them time
[1:23:16] for relationship with their family on
[1:23:18] the Sabbath. And he's given them time to
[1:23:19] rest on the Sabbath. Okay? He's giving
[1:23:22] them an opportunity for multiple things
[1:23:23] that are beneficial to them. And this
[1:23:25] was serious business. Okay? When God
[1:23:28] said, "Hallow that day, keep it holy.
[1:23:30] Don't do any work." He was serious about
[1:23:32] it. And we see this when we go to uh to
[1:23:35] Numbers 15, it's also Exodus 34 or 35.
[1:23:38] And it says, "And while the children of
[1:23:39] Israel were in the wilderness, they
[1:23:41] found a man that gathered sticks upon
[1:23:42] the Sabbath day. And they that found him
[1:23:45] gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
[1:23:47] and Aaron and unto all the congregation.
[1:23:48] And they put him in ward. They put him
[1:23:50] in a cell because it was not declared
[1:23:52] what should be done to him. So they
[1:23:53] caught him. They put him in prison. Then
[1:23:54] they come ask Moses what to do. And the
[1:23:57] and so Moses goes in. He talks to Mo to
[1:23:59] the Lord. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:24:01] "The man shall surely be put to death.
[1:24:04] All the congregation shall stone him
[1:24:06] with stones without or outside the camp.
[1:24:09] And all the congregation brought him
[1:24:10] without the camp and stoned him with
[1:24:12] stones." And he died as the Lord
[1:24:14] commanded Moses. Church, is he
[1:24:17] harsh? That's pretty harsh.
[1:24:19] He's picking up sticks on the Sabbath
[1:24:21] and God says he shall surely die. Why?
[1:24:25] Because God said, "Don't do it." God
[1:24:28] said, "Don't do it. You're not allowed
[1:24:30] to do it. I've provided for you. There's
[1:24:32] no reason for you to have to do this.
[1:24:33] Therefore, you either ignored me on the
[1:24:36] day before, you disobeyed me on the day
[1:24:38] before, or you just want your comfort of
[1:24:40] some sort." He says, "And you've got to
[1:24:43] die for it." And they went out and they
[1:24:44] stoned that man. He knew not to do it,
[1:24:46] and he still did it. and he died under
[1:24:49] two or three
[1:24:50] witnesses. We see there that fear that
[1:24:52] Paul is talking about Hebrews 10 about
[1:24:54] willful sin. But in Moses day that
[1:24:56] willful sin was always actions. It was
[1:24:58] whatever you did. It was what people
[1:25:01] could see is what people could judge.
[1:25:03] And so we read this earlier in in
[1:25:05] Hebrews 10 he says and when you did
[1:25:07] something then you had this fearful
[1:25:08] looking for of judgment and fiery
[1:25:10] indignation. So if two or three people
[1:25:13] witnessed you doing that, then you knew
[1:25:15] you were in
[1:25:16] trouble. Unless you were in collusion
[1:25:18] with them, right? If they saw you doing
[1:25:22] something that the law of Moses
[1:25:23] prohibited, they were enough to get you
[1:25:26] before the council, before the judge,
[1:25:28] before the priest, before Moses,
[1:25:29] whatever it was, and you were hauled in
[1:25:31] front, and you were judged right then
[1:25:32] and there. And whatever the law said to
[1:25:34] do or whatever God said to do, it was
[1:25:36] done right then. You couldn't go home
[1:25:38] and get your things in order. You
[1:25:39] couldn't set up your will. They took it
[1:25:41] out and they judged you and they they
[1:25:42] they they did exactly what God said to
[1:25:44] do right then and
[1:25:45] there. And it was horrible. It was
[1:25:48] horrible. That's why people were living
[1:25:49] under a state of fear cuz they knew if
[1:25:52] they did wrong, they were going to get
[1:25:54] it. They were absolutely going to get
[1:25:56] it. And so watch what happens now. So
[1:25:59] this man goes, he gathers stones. God
[1:26:01] says sorry. He's got it. God doesn't
[1:26:03] even say sorry. He says he shall surely
[1:26:05] die. He doesn't even apologize. And now
[1:26:07] God comes behind this and he says, "I'm
[1:26:08] going to help you out,
[1:26:10] people." Maybe this is an indication of
[1:26:13] this man that he didn't do it willfully.
[1:26:15] He forgot. He forgot what day it was.
[1:26:17] Who knows? But he says this. Listen to
[1:26:19] this. He says, "The Lord God said unto
[1:26:21] Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
[1:26:23] of Israel, and bid them that they make
[1:26:25] fringes in the borders of their garments
[1:26:27] throughout their generations, and that
[1:26:30] they put upon the fringe of the borders
[1:26:31] a ribbon of blue. And it shall be unto
[1:26:34] you for a fringe that you may look upon
[1:26:36] it and remember all the commandments of
[1:26:39] the Lord and do them and that ye seek
[1:26:41] not after your own heart and your own
[1:26:43] eyes after which ye used to go
[1:26:46] ahoring. He says that ye may remember
[1:26:49] and do all my commandments. What's the
[1:26:51] purpose of the fringes? To remember and
[1:26:54] do what God tells you to do. He says and
[1:26:57] be holy unto your God. I am the Lord
[1:26:59] your God which brought you out of the
[1:27:00] land of Egypt to be your God. I am the
[1:27:03] Lord your God. So notice now God says, I
[1:27:05] want you to do something different with
[1:27:06] your clothes. I want you to take and put
[1:27:08] tassels on your robes. And I've got a
[1:27:10] picture and you look at the these robes
[1:27:12] or these shawls on these men here. And
[1:27:14] you see that some of them have the blue
[1:27:16] ribbon and stripes and then they all
[1:27:18] have fringes or they have tassels coming
[1:27:21] down and then they have some have longer
[1:27:23] tassels than others.
[1:27:26] Okay? He says, "Put these on your
[1:27:29] clothes." He says, "So that when you see
[1:27:31] your clothes, it'll remind you to do
[1:27:33] what I told you to do and not what you
[1:27:36] want to
[1:27:38] do." What is it that he calls it when we
[1:27:41] do what we want to do?
[1:27:43] Horing. What is whoring? It's to go and
[1:27:46] have intimate relations with a woman
[1:27:47] that is not your wife. So it's to seek
[1:27:50] after that which is sensual rather than
[1:27:53] that which is
[1:27:54] relational. It's to seek the benefit
[1:27:56] without the work of the relationship.
[1:27:59] And it's unholy. It's an unholy thing.
[1:28:01] What is it? Because anything that is
[1:28:03] outside of the word is
[1:28:07] sensual. It caters to the flesh. And
[1:28:09] anything that caters to the flesh is
[1:28:11] satanic in and of itself. Because
[1:28:13] remember, if you have the spirit of God,
[1:28:15] it's overcoming the flesh, not
[1:28:18] conforming to the flesh. Amen. It's not
[1:28:21] catering to the flesh. Remember what we
[1:28:23] said before that that Paul said, "Those
[1:28:25] that are Christ have crucified the
[1:28:27] flesh. We read in Revelations 10 where
[1:28:30] when the word comes in, it's sweet for a
[1:28:32] moment, but then it's really hard on the
[1:28:33] flesh. It's bitter. And so if all we do
[1:28:36] is try and feel good and do things that
[1:28:38] make us happy and joyful all the time,
[1:28:41] then what is it? That is a satanic
[1:28:42] gospel because this gospel is not always
[1:28:45] fun. It's not always fun. Can I get an
[1:28:49] amen? It's not always fun. There are
[1:28:51] hard times being a Christian. And if
[1:28:52] it's not, you're not a Christian yet.
[1:28:55] Cuz it's always going to be a trial for
[1:28:57] this flesh. if nothing else. Okay. So,
[1:29:00] we see then that the people did what God
[1:29:02] required. They put the tassels on. But
[1:29:04] you'll find this one thing. The tassels
[1:29:07] never
[1:29:08] worked. The tassels never worked. And
[1:29:10] you go and you look in in the book of
[1:29:12] the Judges especially, you'll see it
[1:29:14] keep saying these words. And then and
[1:29:16] and uh the people did that which was
[1:29:18] right in their own eyes. Every man did
[1:29:20] that which was right in their own eyes,
[1:29:22] which is exactly what God said the
[1:29:24] tassels were supposed to do. Stop doing
[1:29:26] what's right in your own
[1:29:27] eyes. Whether it seems good, whether it
[1:29:31] seems better, whether it seems more holy
[1:29:32] or more sanctified, or whether it's
[1:29:34] obviously the opposite. And we see that
[1:29:37] it goes in both directions. And so we
[1:29:39] see in the end that these tassels did
[1:29:40] not help them. Rather, they judged them
[1:29:42] because God had said, "Put these on to
[1:29:45] remind you." And then they never it
[1:29:46] never did the work. It never did the
[1:29:48] work. And they always fell away from
[1:29:50] God. But I want you to see how they the
[1:29:52] priesthood took this commandment. Now
[1:29:54] you see they've got two things going on
[1:29:56] here. They've got the tassels and the
[1:29:57] blue ribbons, but then they have the
[1:29:59] felactories on their head and they would
[1:30:01] put in there scriptures that were were
[1:30:04] most dear to them, their favorite
[1:30:06] scriptures, and they write them in
[1:30:07] there. And it was a sign of of piety and
[1:30:09] spirituality and these different things.
[1:30:11] But I want you to see what happened when
[1:30:13] the priesthood ran with this
[1:30:14] commandment. And we're preaching on no
[1:30:16] room for fear tonight. And I I I I want
[1:30:18] to keep that in the forefront because
[1:30:20] we're trying to see how this mentality
[1:30:22] of fear can creep in by the law, even by
[1:30:25] the word when you do something you
[1:30:27] shouldn't and fear
[1:30:29] follows. It's there for good reason
[1:30:31] under the law. But God Christ comes now
[1:30:33] and he sees what they're doing. And
[1:30:35] listen to these words. He says, "Then g
[1:30:37] then spoke Jesus to the multitude and to
[1:30:39] his disciples, saying, the scribes and
[1:30:42] the Pharisees sit in Moses seat." In
[1:30:43] other words, they sit in the authority
[1:30:45] that Moses had, but they don't have
[1:30:48] Moses' authority. Church, God came down
[1:30:51] and spoke lip to ear, face to face with
[1:30:55] Moses. None of these priests had that.
[1:30:58] But he said, "They sit in the seat of
[1:31:01] authority as if they had the same
[1:31:03] relationship with me that Moses did."
[1:31:06] Watch what they do with it.
[1:31:08] He says all therefore whatsoever they
[1:31:11] bid you observe that observe and do. He
[1:31:14] says but do not ye after their works for
[1:31:17] they say and do
[1:31:19] not. They tell you what to do but they
[1:31:22] themselves don't do it. He said for they
[1:31:25] bind heavy burdens and grievous to be
[1:31:28] bored. The the literal meaning there is
[1:31:29] they create large burdens hard and heavy
[1:31:32] for you to handle and carry and they lay
[1:31:35] them on men's shoulders. Let me put on
[1:31:37] this way on other men's
[1:31:40] shoulders. He says, "But they themselves
[1:31:42] will not move them with one of their
[1:31:44] fingers." So they come and they took the
[1:31:46] authority of Moses. They took the
[1:31:48] authority of the word. They stepped into
[1:31:50] it over the people in their in their as
[1:31:53] the spiritual leaders of Israel and they
[1:31:55] created large and heavy burdens above
[1:31:58] and beyond what God had ever
[1:32:00] intended. Okay? And then he says, "They
[1:32:04] themselves will not move them with one
[1:32:05] of their fingers. They walk away and
[1:32:07] they won't help you. Oh, sister so and
[1:32:10] so, you're struggling with that. Well,
[1:32:12] that's between you and
[1:32:14] God. Oh, you can't do what we told you
[1:32:16] to do. Well, guess what? There's a price
[1:32:18] to be paid,
[1:32:20] brother. And you're sitting there and
[1:32:22] you're just getting lower and lower and
[1:32:24] it's defeating the people because they
[1:32:26] can't live what the preachers are
[1:32:27] telling them to live.
[1:32:31] Okay? He says, "But all their works they
[1:32:34] do for to be seen of men." He said
[1:32:36] everything that those men do, it's it's
[1:32:38] for outward
[1:32:40] appearance. He says they make broad
[1:32:43] their felactories. Okay, these things on
[1:32:46] their head, they put them on the arms as
[1:32:47] well. He says, "And they enlarge the
[1:32:50] borders of their garments, and they love
[1:32:53] the uppermost rooms of feasts and the
[1:32:55] chief seats in the synagogues and
[1:32:57] greetings in the market, and to be
[1:32:58] called of men, rabbi, rabbi." So we see
[1:33:01] here that the priesthood weaponized the
[1:33:04] law of Moses to make life harder for the
[1:33:07] people for no reason, for no good
[1:33:10] reason, I should say. God didn't inspire
[1:33:13] it. God didn't ask it. God didn't
[1:33:16] require it. God didn't speak it. Moses
[1:33:18] never said it. Men did. And they put the
[1:33:21] people in fear of the priesthood because
[1:33:23] they were the supposed spiritual leaders
[1:33:25] of Israel.
[1:33:27] So now because they are respected,
[1:33:30] they're in the seat of authority.
[1:33:32] Whatever that priesthood said, the
[1:33:34] people felt obligated to do. Church, as
[1:33:37] a minister, I have to be so careful what
[1:33:41] I say over this pulpit. That is personal
[1:33:44] opinion because I can bind you with my
[1:33:48] expectations. I can bind you with my
[1:33:50] rules. I can bind you with the way I do
[1:33:53] things in my house. Now, I trust that if
[1:33:56] I do give a personal opinion, I let you
[1:33:58] know this is mine. I ought to do that
[1:34:01] because what is mine is not necessarily
[1:34:03] yours, and what is good for me is not
[1:34:05] necessarily good for you. And what is
[1:34:07] right for me is not necessarily right
[1:34:08] for you. You're a child of God, and you
[1:34:11] answer to him. You answer to the word.
[1:34:13] You don't answer to my personal
[1:34:15] opinions. Now, I'm here to help you
[1:34:17] through, and I believe that if God will
[1:34:19] use me, those opinions will do the right
[1:34:21] thing. But they are just that, opinions.
[1:34:23] I need to anchor these things in the
[1:34:25] word or let it be very clear that these
[1:34:27] are my
[1:34:29] standards.
[1:34:31] Okay. What do they do with
[1:34:33] this? What do the tassels become here?
[1:34:36] They become a supposed sign of
[1:34:41] spirituality. Brother Paul comes into
[1:34:43] church. He's got a little 2-in
[1:34:47] ribbon. Well, I got a 4 inch.
[1:34:51] Brother Paul is so
[1:34:54] unspiritual. Look at those little weeny
[1:34:56] tassels that sister that brother Joe has
[1:34:59] on his shaw there today. He's got the
[1:35:01] little tiny ones. Barely tassels.
[1:35:04] Brother Gerald, look at those tassels.
[1:35:05] Those 8-in tassels. Yes, sir. He's a man
[1:35:08] of God. What a difference between those
[1:35:10] two brothers. You say they don't do
[1:35:11] that. That's exactly what they did,
[1:35:13] church. Jesus said they made it big to
[1:35:16] make you think that they're better than
[1:35:19] you.
[1:35:20] That's what they did. It was all trying
[1:35:22] to create a facade that the priesthood
[1:35:25] was better, more spiritual, more pious,
[1:35:28] more holy, more sanctified. And Jesus
[1:35:30] said, "Everything they do is to be seen
[1:35:32] of you." It's not done to
[1:35:34] God. It's done to make themselves look
[1:35:37] better. It was a sign of spiritual
[1:35:40] authority, but it was all self-created.
[1:35:43] God was not in it. God did not say, "If
[1:35:46] you make the ribbons bigger, you'll be
[1:35:48] better.
[1:35:49] He just said, "Do it to remind
[1:35:51] yourself." And what did they do, church?
[1:35:53] They made them bigger and bigger for
[1:35:55] themselves and it didn't do the job it
[1:35:56] was supposed to do because they were so
[1:35:58] focused on what they wanted it to
[1:36:00] be and how they could use it for their
[1:36:02] own gain rather than looking at it and
[1:36:03] saying, "Oh my goodness, I shouldn't be
[1:36:05] doing this. This is reminding me. I need
[1:36:07] to do this. I need to stop doing that."
[1:36:09] So what they did here is they expanded
[1:36:12] on the law of Moses for self-promotion
[1:36:15] and
[1:36:16] gain to give them authority, spiritual
[1:36:19] authority, and they turned that church
[1:36:21] from spiritual authority into physical
[1:36:23] authority over the people. Absolutely
[1:36:25] they did. And it was a waste of the
[1:36:27] people's time and the people's energy.
[1:36:29] And they got to the point, church, with
[1:36:30] all these rules and laws that they could
[1:36:32] barely move without breaking a
[1:36:34] law. Washing your hands 83 million times
[1:36:37] a day. You had to go here and do this.
[1:36:39] You had to go here and do that. You had
[1:36:40] to chop up this. You had to do and
[1:36:42] you're running around trying to meet all
[1:36:43] these laws. God wasn't in it. God had no
[1:36:46] part in it. We showed earlier where God
[1:36:49] said, "You shall do no work, no survi
[1:36:51] work on the Sabbath." And it was these
[1:36:53] four things. By the time that Jesus
[1:36:56] Christ came, this is what it
[1:36:59] became.
[1:37:01] 39 things you can't do. God said four.
[1:37:06] Man added 35 to it. Nowhere is that
[1:37:09] written in scripture except the four
[1:37:12] blue things I've h I've I've highlighted
[1:37:14] there. What is it? Standards of men,
[1:37:18] traditions of the
[1:37:20] fathers. Okay. Nowhere will you find all
[1:37:24] those things, God forbidding
[1:37:26] it. God said there's four. And man
[1:37:30] turned it into a burdensome thing. 39
[1:37:32] things. What they turned it into is you
[1:37:34] can't do anything on the Sabbath. And
[1:37:38] God never said it. Man said
[1:37:41] it. Look, God man. God man. God man. Are
[1:37:48] we getting the picture? God made it
[1:37:50] simple. Look what man did.
[1:37:54] Burdensome. You couldn't even
[1:37:57] move. Couldn't do anything. You had to
[1:38:00] sit there and eat cold
[1:38:03] food. That's what happened. That's what
[1:38:05] men
[1:38:07] did. You'll find these things if you go
[1:38:10] look at the Jewish tradition. They
[1:38:12] acknowledge these are not in the Torah.
[1:38:14] These are part of the oral Torah, the
[1:38:17] spoken Torah. You know what that means,
[1:38:19] church? It never came from
[1:38:22] God. They're not in the book of Moses,
[1:38:26] the books of Moses. They had to speak
[1:38:28] them and pass them down by memory
[1:38:29] because they couldn't attach them to
[1:38:31] scripture because they weren't inspired
[1:38:33] of God. And they bound the people with
[1:38:36] all of these things. And this is just
[1:38:37] one example. Where'd it come from,
[1:38:40] church? It came from an overzealous
[1:38:43] ministry. An overzealous ministry,
[1:38:45] church. I'm not saying they I'm saying
[1:38:47] it ended up bad. It may have started
[1:38:50] good. It may have started good. They may
[1:38:52] have said, "People, we want you to be
[1:38:54] more holy. We want you to be more
[1:38:57] sanctified. We want to be sure that you
[1:39:00] don't do anything you shouldn't do." But
[1:39:02] church, God had already set the
[1:39:03] standard. Don't do four things. And God
[1:39:07] made it easy. And man came behind and
[1:39:09] maybe with the best of intentions and
[1:39:11] they made it so you couldn't do
[1:39:12] anything. And now the Sabbath couldn't
[1:39:15] even be a time of true rest because
[1:39:17] you're so busy trying to make sure you
[1:39:18] didn't do something you shouldn't do.
[1:39:21] What a horrible place to
[1:39:23] be. They would set all these rules, all
[1:39:26] these
[1:39:28] things, and they would live by them.
[1:39:31] They would live by them at least
[1:39:32] publicly. But then Jesus comes along,
[1:39:34] and I love how Jesus does it. Jesus
[1:39:36] turns their world upside down. He says,
[1:39:38] "You want to you want to crank it up?
[1:39:41] You want to take it and magnify it?" He
[1:39:42] says, "Let me magnify it by letting you
[1:39:44] see the mind of God." And here's what he
[1:39:47] says. He says, "You have heard that it
[1:39:50] was said by them of old time, thou shalt
[1:39:52] not commit adultery." Who said that,
[1:39:53] church? God did to Moses. He says, "But
[1:39:57] I say unto
[1:39:59] you." He says, "If you want to bind the
[1:40:02] people, let me show you what this really
[1:40:04] looks like. Let me let the word give you
[1:40:06] the revelation." Now, the word and flesh
[1:40:08] comes down. He is the word church. He
[1:40:10] has authority to speak. And he says,
[1:40:12] "But I say unto you," he's talking about
[1:40:15] the law of adultery. And they would say,
[1:40:17] "Lord, we have never committed
[1:40:18] adultery." He says, "That whosoever
[1:40:20] lookketh on a woman to lust after her
[1:40:24] hath committed adultery with her already
[1:40:27] in his heart." Now, church, every single
[1:40:30] man in his life has had an impure
[1:40:32] thought go through. If you won't admit
[1:40:34] it, I'm admitting it for you this
[1:40:35] evening. Every man has had an impure
[1:40:38] thought at some point. Listen, young
[1:40:40] men, hormones will get you there. I
[1:40:43] don't care what age it was. Impure
[1:40:44] thoughts will get you there. You're
[1:40:46] going to see something. You're going to
[1:40:47] see somebody and the thoughts going to
[1:40:49] flash through. And so, in one moment,
[1:40:52] Jesus condemned every single man. He
[1:40:56] says, "You want to crank up the law?" He
[1:40:57] says, "I'm going to crank it up to 11."
[1:40:58] It only goes to 10. He says, "We're
[1:41:00] going to take it past what's ever what
[1:41:01] it's ever been meant to." He says, "In
[1:41:03] God's eyes, when you look at a woman to
[1:41:05] lust after her, you've committed
[1:41:06] adultery." And what is the what is the
[1:41:08] punishment for adultery church? Death.
[1:41:12] So in one fell swoop, Jesus Christ
[1:41:15] condemned every man to
[1:41:19] death. He says that's the way God looks
[1:41:21] at it. But God eased off on you and he
[1:41:24] said, "If you only commit the physical
[1:41:25] act, that's what I'll judge you on cuz I
[1:41:28] know you can't control your thoughts.
[1:41:30] You can't control what's passed in front
[1:41:32] of you to a degree."
[1:41:34] So he said, "I'll hold you accountable
[1:41:36] for what you do, not what you think."
[1:41:38] But Jesus said, "In God's eyes, it's as
[1:41:40] if you already did it." And what was he
[1:41:42] doing, church? Remember what John had
[1:41:43] come? John had tried to get those men to
[1:41:46] repent and they never would. And Jesus
[1:41:49] was trying to knock them off their
[1:41:50] self-created high horse of spirituality
[1:41:53] to say, "You must repent.
[1:41:57] You've done
[1:42:00] worse by by putting a burden on the
[1:42:02] people, but you're as guilty as any of
[1:42:04] them in the eyes of God. And all you've
[1:42:07] done is you built up a facade of
[1:42:08] spirituality by dos and don'ts. And I
[1:42:11] don't do this and I don't do that and I
[1:42:12] don't do this and I don't do that. So
[1:42:14] what? He says, God's looking beyond what
[1:42:16] you do. He's looking into your heart.
[1:42:18] He's looking into your mind. He's
[1:42:19] looking at your very attitude and the
[1:42:20] things you think inside.
[1:42:24] What I'm trying to show you, church,
[1:42:25] here is that God's ways are often
[1:42:28] magnified and improved
[1:42:31] upon and brought down in a way that God
[1:42:34] never intended. And it brings people
[1:42:36] into
[1:42:37] bondage rather than setting them free.
[1:42:40] And what does it what does it do,
[1:42:42] church? And haven't we seen it? You end
[1:42:43] up with a church that is led by dos and
[1:42:47] don'ts rather than by the spirit of God.
[1:42:52] Because what is it now? You're doing it
[1:42:54] because you're not allowed to do it or
[1:42:56] because if you do, you're going to be
[1:42:57] judged or bad things are going to happen
[1:42:59] rather than having come into the love of
[1:43:02] Jesus Christ that will keep you from
[1:43:04] doing it in the first
[1:43:06] place. Perfect love casts out
[1:43:09] fear. If you have Christ abiding in you,
[1:43:12] Brother Brham said, "I don't not cheat
[1:43:13] on my wife because I'm scared of what
[1:43:15] she would do. I don't cheat on her
[1:43:17] because I love her."
[1:43:19] But if we're standing here and we're
[1:43:21] saying, "Well, I'm not going to do this
[1:43:22] and I'm not going to watch that and I'm
[1:43:23] not going to listen to this and I'm not
[1:43:25] going to do that and I hope they don't
[1:43:26] find out about me doing this or else we
[1:43:28] miss the point. Fall in love with
[1:43:31] Jesus." That's what this relationship is
[1:43:33] supposed to do is make you fall in love
[1:43:35] with Jesus. And then we can create
[1:43:37] standards as parents, as ministry, as a
[1:43:42] church that have no founding in the word
[1:43:45] of God, but they are traditions. They're
[1:43:47] the way it's always been
[1:43:49] done. And what do we do? Because that's
[1:43:52] the way it's always been
[1:43:53] done. We say, "You got to keep doing
[1:43:56] it." And it's not a word of God. It's a
[1:44:00] personal standard. It's a church
[1:44:03] preference. It's a ministry tradition,
[1:44:06] but it's not of God. And it binds the
[1:44:07] people the dos and don'ts by fear
[1:44:09] because they say, "Well, that person
[1:44:11] knows what's going to happen. And
[1:44:12] they've told me if I do this and this is
[1:44:13] what's going to happen." Listen,
[1:44:15] scripture says whatsoever God God is not
[1:44:17] mocked. Whatsoever man sws, he'll reap.
[1:44:20] Okay? And I'm not trying to do away with
[1:44:22] things this evening. We've got a lot
[1:44:23] more to cover in this. So, I hope you
[1:44:24] can see my heart in it. But I'm saying
[1:44:26] if we're only doing it because people
[1:44:28] have told us not to do it or to do it,
[1:44:30] we've missed the point. It'll protect
[1:44:33] you for a while, but it can also bind
[1:44:35] you for a long, long time if you don't
[1:44:37] move past that and come into the the
[1:44:39] riches of the liberty of Christ.
[1:44:42] Now watch what happens because we got to
[1:44:44] have a word foundation, church. That's
[1:44:46] what we have to have is a word
[1:44:47] foundation. I'm not talking personal
[1:44:50] convictions between you and God. And it
[1:44:52] doesn't have to be in the word to be a
[1:44:53] personal conviction, but it needs to be
[1:44:54] in the word for me to preach it. There's
[1:44:57] a difference there. See, I can have a
[1:44:58] personal conviction that's outside the
[1:45:00] word of God, but I need to preach what's
[1:45:01] in the word of God. Okay? And I should
[1:45:05] be held to that standard. But watch this
[1:45:07] now. And we're seeing an example, and
[1:45:08] we're close here to closing this
[1:45:10] evening. It says, ' And it came to pass,
[1:45:12] this was Jesus, as he went through the
[1:45:13] corn fields on the Sabbath day, and his
[1:45:15] disciples began as they went to pluck
[1:45:17] the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said
[1:45:19] unto him, Behold, why do they on the
[1:45:21] Sabbath that which is not lawful? Now,
[1:45:24] church, they were not I I read there
[1:45:26] earlier that God said, you're not
[1:45:27] allowed to harvest. Harvest means to
[1:45:29] take it and store it away. Actual work
[1:45:32] of harvest. They are not harvesting
[1:45:34] here. They're gathering it to eat. It's
[1:45:36] a completely different thing. Okay? So
[1:45:39] this was not forbidden by the law of
[1:45:41] Moses. What it was forbidden by was the
[1:45:44] oral law. Okay? So they said it's not
[1:45:48] lawful. But it was lawful by Moses. It
[1:45:51] just wasn't lawful by them. Now watch
[1:45:53] Jesus response now. He says, "And he
[1:45:56] said unto them, have ye never read what
[1:45:58] David did when he had need and was in
[1:46:01] hungered he and they that were with
[1:46:03] him?" He says, "How he went into the
[1:46:05] house of God in the days of Abiathar the
[1:46:07] high priest and did eat the showbre
[1:46:09] which is not lawful to eat but for the
[1:46:11] priest and gave also to them which were
[1:46:13] with him." So if you remember that
[1:46:15] story, David, remember he ran from the
[1:46:17] presence of Saul because he was trying
[1:46:18] to kill him. And he comes to the the the
[1:46:20] tabernacle and he says to the priest, he
[1:46:22] says, "I'm I I'm on the king's business.
[1:46:24] I was in a hurry. I didn't take a
[1:46:26] weapon. I didn't take food. Do you have
[1:46:27] any food? And do you have a weapon?" And
[1:46:29] he says, "I don't have any weapon except
[1:46:30] the sword of Goliath. that's wrapped in
[1:46:32] I think in a robe or an epha behind the
[1:46:34] altar. He says and David said there's
[1:46:35] none like it. I'll take that. And then
[1:46:37] he says, "I don't have bread except for
[1:46:39] the showbread." He says, "And that's
[1:46:40] only for the priests." And David says,
[1:46:42] "I'll take it." Now remember, David was
[1:46:45] not a
[1:46:46] priest. David was of the tribe of Judah,
[1:46:49] not the tribe of Levi. David has no
[1:46:51] right to that bread. He was not supposed
[1:46:53] to eat it. And Jesus said he had need
[1:46:57] and he took it. He
[1:46:59] says, "King David is revered by you and
[1:47:02] yet he broke the law. He clearly broke
[1:47:05] the law." He says, "What do you do about
[1:47:07] that?"
[1:47:09] Okay, I have searched long and hard for
[1:47:12] an explanation there and I found
[1:47:14] something to or yesterday. And brother
[1:47:16] Bram said he was a type of Christ.
[1:47:18] That's why he allowed it. David was a
[1:47:20] type of Christ. And we'll see why that
[1:47:23] what that looks like in these next two
[1:47:25] verses. He said unto him, "The Sabbath
[1:47:27] was made for man and not man for the
[1:47:29] Sabbath." And he says, "Therefore, the
[1:47:31] Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath."
[1:47:34] And I want to explain what that means by
[1:47:36] a little story. This is something I had
[1:47:38] happen at work once where a man wrote me
[1:47:41] about a a a program that I was man I
[1:47:44] created it and I managed it. Okay? And
[1:47:47] this man and he he had wrote it wrote in
[1:47:50] saying, "Hey, can I use this program? am
[1:47:53] I am I qualified to use this
[1:47:55] program? And I said, "Sorry, you're not
[1:47:57] qualified for this reason." Well, he
[1:48:00] came back a few days later and he said,
[1:48:02] "My advisors tell me that you're
[1:48:06] wrong." Now, I created it. It's mine.
[1:48:10] I'm the Lord of this program. I know the
[1:48:13] rules by heart because I wrote them. So,
[1:48:17] I had to chuckle inwardly. He knew I had
[1:48:19] told him, "Hey, this is mine. I lead it.
[1:48:22] It's what I do. No, you're not
[1:48:23] qualified. And he came back. He says,
[1:48:25] "My people say you're
[1:48:27] wrong." That's like, "No, it's
[1:48:31] mine. What I say goes cuz I created
[1:48:35] it." And so I told him once again, "No,
[1:48:38] you're wrong. You don't qualify. You
[1:48:41] can't be a part of this program." But it
[1:48:44] just made me laugh because this is what
[1:48:46] Jesus is saying
[1:48:47] here. Jesus is saying, "I'm the Lord of
[1:48:50] the Sabbath. If my disciples do
[1:48:52] something and I say it's okay, guess
[1:48:55] what? It's
[1:48:57] okay. He says, "I'm the Lord of the
[1:48:59] Sabbath. I get to decide what goes and
[1:49:02] what doesn't on the
[1:49:03] Sabbath." And he's also pointing out
[1:49:06] what they're doing is not wrong by my
[1:49:08] law. It's wrong by your law. What
[1:49:11] they're doing is okay. Leave them alone.
[1:49:13] What is it? He was pointing to need as
[1:49:16] the reason, and that was acceptable. It
[1:49:18] was not forbidden by Moses' law. God
[1:49:20] wasn't trying to kill people for
[1:49:22] crossing lines, church. He was trying to
[1:49:24] get them to a place where his family
[1:49:27] could live and profit and be blessed by
[1:49:29] the things of God. Amen. He was trying
[1:49:33] to keep them away from the horrible
[1:49:35] decisions, the horrible traditions, and
[1:49:37] the horrible
[1:49:38] results of everyone else around
[1:49:41] them. You got to remember, why did he
[1:49:44] destroy the Canaanites? It was because
[1:49:47] the cup of iniquity was full.
[1:49:50] They have been going for hundreds and
[1:49:51] hundreds of years destroying their
[1:49:53] children, uh, making children's
[1:49:55] sacrifices, serving other gods,
[1:49:57] horrible, horrible pagan sensual uh,
[1:50:00] worship, all these different things. It
[1:50:02] was a stench in the nostril of God. And
[1:50:04] God brought the children of Israel in to
[1:50:06] judge those people. He said, "If you do
[1:50:08] what they do, you're going to be put
[1:50:10] into the cup of iniquity. You don't want
[1:50:12] to be there. So stay out and don't do
[1:50:14] what I told you or do what I told you
[1:50:16] and don't do what I told you not to do.
[1:50:18] Otherwise, you're going to get the same
[1:50:19] outcome. And the outcome is death,
[1:50:21] separation from God. But in between,
[1:50:23] there's a bunch of physical things that
[1:50:24] are going to happen as well. You don't
[1:50:26] want to be there. So, we see this
[1:50:29] principle as we close out this evening.
[1:50:31] We'll pick this up on Sunday, Lord
[1:50:32] Winnie. The principle is when God tells
[1:50:34] you to do something, he's doing it for
[1:50:37] your
[1:50:38] benefit. He's not doing it just to say
[1:50:41] it. He's not doing it just to make some
[1:50:43] weird rules to make him the boss and you
[1:50:45] the little peeon. He's doing it to
[1:50:47] preserve you, to help you, to benefit
[1:50:49] you, not to judge you. But the
[1:50:52] priesthood immediately jumped to
[1:50:54] judgment because that's the way men work
[1:50:56] when they get in authority without the
[1:50:58] spirit of God on them, without the
[1:50:59] original spirit on them. You'll notice
[1:51:01] when Moses went in and that man had been
[1:51:04] caught carrying sticks. Moses didn't
[1:51:06] say, "Thou shalt surely die." He said,
[1:51:07] "Lord, what do we
[1:51:09] do?" But the priest latched on to
[1:51:11] judgment every single time. And they're
[1:51:12] looking to condemn, condemn, condemn.
[1:51:15] And Jesus says, "You got it backwards.
[1:51:18] God made the Sabbath for
[1:51:20] you." Yes, there's a thing that God
[1:51:22] benefits from, but he says, "If I didn't
[1:51:24] give you the Sabbath, you'd work
[1:51:25] yourselves into an early grave, and
[1:51:27] you'd never learn to trust
[1:51:29] God." He said, "It's for you so you can
[1:51:32] rest. It's a time to focus on God, yes,
[1:51:34] and worship and praise and hear the
[1:51:36] word, but it's time to spend with your
[1:51:37] family and to sit back and rejuvenate
[1:51:39] and and recharge for the rest of the
[1:51:41] hard work week." He says, "I did it for
[1:51:43] you, for our benefit, not just to have a
[1:51:46] day set aside for God." I'm not trying
[1:51:49] to turn this into self- worship. And I
[1:51:50] hope you understand my heart here. But
[1:51:53] when God gives rules or even suggestions
[1:51:55] that it's best not to or it's good to,
[1:51:58] it's for our benefit that he says those
[1:52:00] things.
[1:52:03] Amen. Jesus came to fulfill the
[1:52:07] law. And to do that, he magnified it to
[1:52:09] the point where nobody could say I did
[1:52:12] that. That's what happened. See, those
[1:52:15] priests could say, some of them that
[1:52:17] from my youth, remember the the rich
[1:52:20] young ruler, from my youth, I've done
[1:52:22] everything you've said. And Jesus never
[1:52:24] said, "No, you haven't." Some of those
[1:52:27] priests, remember what Paul said? I was
[1:52:28] I was a Pharisee. The
[1:52:30] Pharisees blameless according to the law
[1:52:33] was what Paul said.
[1:52:36] There were men that could say, "I've
[1:52:37] never broken a law as far as I know."
[1:52:40] They weren't blameless, but as far as
[1:52:42] they were concerned in keeping the law,
[1:52:44] they'd never done anything
[1:52:46] wrong. But they got the people to a
[1:52:48] point where you could barely move. You
[1:52:50] could barely live without breaking a
[1:52:52] law. And Jesus said, "You're binding the
[1:52:55] people with this." And it has nothing to
[1:52:57] do with God. Has nothing to do with his
[1:52:58] word. Has nothing to do with his
[1:53:00] intentions. You're just doing it to bind
[1:53:03] the people and to bring authority and
[1:53:04] power to yourselves. He came to set us
[1:53:07] free. That's what he did to you know it
[1:53:10] reminds me when they they caught that
[1:53:11] woman in adultery. Multiple people were
[1:53:14] witnesses. She should have died. Now
[1:53:17] Jesus had not witnessed it. They
[1:53:19] witnessed it. And what did he say? He
[1:53:22] said he that is without sin cast the
[1:53:25] first stone. And you know what the
[1:53:26] scripture says? And they from the oldest
[1:53:30] to the
[1:53:31] youngest dropped their stones and walked
[1:53:34] away. Why? Because they may never have
[1:53:37] been caught, but that hadn't mean they
[1:53:40] hadn't done it and not been caught. And
[1:53:42] when they dropped that stone, what they
[1:53:44] were saying was, "Yeah, you're
[1:53:47] right. Just cuz I wasn't caught doesn't
[1:53:49] mean I didn't do it." And so each one of
[1:53:52] them dropped to dropped her stone and
[1:53:53] walked away. And Jesus went to the she
[1:53:55] turned to the woman. And he says,"Woman,
[1:53:57] where are your accusers?" And she says,
[1:53:59] "There everyone gone." And he said,
[1:54:01] "Neither do I accuse thee. Go and sin no
[1:54:03] more." Why? Because according to the
[1:54:05] law, you had to have two
[1:54:07] witnesses. He was only
[1:54:09] one. And so he said, "By the law, you go
[1:54:11] free." Why? He's coming to fulfill the
[1:54:13] law. Coming to fulfill the law. He
[1:54:16] didn't come to judge. Jesus said, "I
[1:54:18] didn't come to judge. I came to save.
[1:54:20] You guys are the ones that are doing all
[1:54:21] the judging. You're the ones binding the
[1:54:23] people. I'm here to set them free."
[1:54:25] That's God's intention. That's what the
[1:54:27] spirit of life in Christ will do is it
[1:54:30] sets us free to serve him, to worship
[1:54:33] him, to follow him, to love him, to
[1:54:37] appreciate him, to thank him when he
[1:54:40] puts barriers in our way because we know
[1:54:43] it's for our good, not just because he
[1:54:45] wants to say things. Amen. Let's stand
[1:54:48] each one of us.
[1:54:51] I'm not here to throw open the doors and
[1:54:54] say anything
[1:54:56] goes or to say everything we've ever not
[1:54:59] done. We got to throw that away. That
[1:55:02] that's not what I'm here to do. But I'm
[1:55:05] here to say that a spiritfilled child of
[1:55:07] God, they live a different way than just
[1:55:11] worrying about cause and effect.
[1:55:14] fear, anxiety, worry, looking over your
[1:55:17] shoulder, waiting for God to drop the
[1:55:19] hammer, and these sorts of things. Amen.
[1:55:21] It's not waiting. The the the law of the
[1:55:24] spirit of life in Christ is not waiting
[1:55:25] for God to punish you. Like I said,
[1:55:27] before I gave my heart to the Lord, I
[1:55:30] was so scared that if I did one thing
[1:55:33] wrong, having received the knowledge of
[1:55:34] the truth, because I was raised in a
[1:55:35] good church, remember, Brother Gerald,
[1:55:37] you were a good preacher. You let me
[1:55:39] know right and wrong. But I believed if
[1:55:41] I did one thing wrong, I would get the
[1:55:43] worst of the worst of judgment of that
[1:55:45] because I knew
[1:55:49] better. That's not
[1:55:51] God. That's not the spirit of God. I'm
[1:55:54] saying it had its time and it had its
[1:55:56] purpose. But if I carried that into my
[1:55:58] walk with Christ, church, that's a
[1:56:01] barrier to relationship with him.
[1:56:04] And so if we're making decisions because
[1:56:07] we're scared, we're fearful, we're
[1:56:10] worried, that's something we need to be
[1:56:12] set free
[1:56:13] from. Amen. Because we'll see that
[1:56:15] conviction doesn't take you to fear. It
[1:56:17] takes you to repentance and walking a
[1:56:20] different way. And you go in liberty
[1:56:21] then, not in worry and fear. Because
[1:56:24] why? Your desire is to please
[1:56:26] him rather than a desire not to be
[1:56:30] judged. Amen. We've already been judged
[1:56:32] in Christ. His spirit towards the bride,
[1:56:34] his nature towards the bride is not
[1:56:35] judgment. It's mercy. It's grace. It's
[1:56:38] love. It's forgiveness. It's all of
[1:56:39] these different
[1:56:40] things. But I want us to see, and that's
[1:56:43] really what I was trying to do this
[1:56:44] evening. I hope you've seen it. try to
[1:56:46] see where this spirit of fear can be
[1:56:48] pushed onto the people by dos and don'ts
[1:56:51] and by traditions and taking the word
[1:56:53] and magnifying it in a way that God
[1:56:54] never intended and binding us to
[1:56:57] tradition. Binding us to the past,
[1:56:59] binding us to the way it's always been.
[1:57:01] It's always been done. The question is,
[1:57:03] what does the word
[1:57:04] say? Not what do people say. Even if
[1:57:07] they are Holy Ghost fil people, we've
[1:57:10] got to bring it back to the word. We've
[1:57:12] got to bring it back to the word.
[1:57:13] Otherwise, we can never be set free
[1:57:15] because the scripture says, "The truth
[1:57:17] shall set you free." You're not free if
[1:57:19] you're living in fear. That's torment.
[1:57:23] That's not where God wants us to be. He
[1:57:24] wants us to live free. Amen. God bless
[1:57:27] you. Let's bow our head, Lord
[1:57:30] Jesus. Lord, certainly a more sober
[1:57:32] topic
[1:57:33] tonight, Lord. But we're trusting your
[1:57:36] spirit is leading us in
[1:57:38] this, Lord. For we know if we look in
[1:57:40] our lives, surely there are things,
[1:57:42] Lord, that are there by tradition, Lord,
[1:57:44] thereby teaching, but not necessarily
[1:57:46] there by your word or by your spirit.
[1:57:49] Lord, we want to live a life that's in
[1:57:51] the pure liberty, Lord, of the spirit of
[1:57:53] Christ living inside of us, Lord. We
[1:57:56] don't want to be fearful. We don't want
[1:57:58] to be anxious, Lord. We don't want to be
[1:58:00] waiting for you to judge us, Lord. But
[1:58:03] we want to know that your love will lead
[1:58:04] us exactly where we need to go, Lord.
[1:58:07] that all things will work together for
[1:58:08] our good, Lord, and that you're there to
[1:58:10] guide us and keep us and preserve us day
[1:58:13] in and day out. Lord, I pray you help us
[1:58:15] to see your heart, Lord, your approach,
[1:58:17] your purpose in all of these things,
[1:58:19] Lord, that you're not trying to bind us,
[1:58:21] Lord, to do and don'ts, but you're
[1:58:23] trying to bind us in love, Lord, to you,
[1:58:25] Lord, in the pure relationship that
[1:58:27] we're offered through Christ. Lord, I
[1:58:29] pray you take this little mini portion,
[1:58:31] this little minieries, Lord. I pray you
[1:58:33] help us to break our traditions, Lord.
[1:58:36] Break our mindset, break our attitude,
[1:58:38] Lord. Break our judgment of one another
[1:58:40] and even our judgment of ourselves,
[1:58:42] Lord, and see ourselves through the shed
[1:58:44] blood, Lord, where the word can have
[1:58:46] full effect in our lives. Lord, I pray
[1:58:48] you free your people, Lord, to serve
[1:58:51] you, Lord, day by day. We ask these
[1:58:53] things now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:58:56] Fill my way with love.
[1:58:59] 211 an old
[1:59:02] faithful. Let me walk blessed Lord in
[1:59:06] the way thou hast gone, leading straight

[2:15:46] their service and their sacrifice
[2:15:48] guys. So, Father, may you just be with

[2:16:04] Lord. And Lord, may we just pray, Lord,
