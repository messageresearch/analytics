[37:28] all right let's turn to Ephesians 4
[37:32] start at verse
[37:44] 15 okay verse 15 but speaking the truth
[37:46] and love may grow up into him in all
[37:48] things which is the head even Christ For
[37:51] Whom the whole body whole body fitly
[37:53] together joined together and compacted
[37:56] by that which every joint supplieth
[37:58] according to the effectual working in
[37:59] the measure of every part maketh
[38:01] increase the body unto the edifying of
[38:03] itself in love you may be
[38:09] seated okay so tonight is part seven in
[38:12] our study in
[38:14] Nehemiah uh I also want to do um he's
[38:17] not here but I thoroughly enjoyed having
[38:19] brother Mark up here last
[38:21] Wednesday the master himself Mark the
[38:26] Revelator um
[38:28] really really enjoyed having Dad back so
[38:30] it's nice to have that teaching back I
[38:33] do not have the confidence whatsoever
[38:35] the delve into Revelation like he does
[38:37] and it's great to hear it I think
[38:39] everyone enjoyed it and um be good to
[38:41] have him up
[38:42] soon okay so part seven uh so last time
[38:46] that we talked about Nehemiah we he was
[38:50] talking to the King of
[38:51] Persia and that's where he did the
[38:53] instant prayer for favor with the king
[38:55] the king gives him the authority that he
[38:57] needs the resources Nehemiah goes to
[39:01] Jerusalem when he gets there he doesn't
[39:03] tell anyone that he is there and he
[39:05] wants to see what the lay of the land is
[39:09] like um he inspects it sees how bad it
[39:12] is um that way he can get a plan
[39:15] together he goes to the Lord to
[39:17] praise um we also uh taught about how
[39:22] Nehemiah wasn't just under the authority
[39:24] of a king he was also under prophecy
[39:27] where we saw in the 70 weeks of Daniel
[39:29] where it was prophesied that the wall
[39:33] would be
[39:36] restored it's one thing to have the
[39:38] authority of the Persian king it's a
[39:41] whole other thing to have the authority
[39:42] of the Heavenly
[39:43] King so the next bit was that uh once he
[39:47] has the plan together he talks to the
[39:49] people he gives them the vision inspires
[39:52] them to restore the wall because at this
[39:54] point this was u a long period period of
[39:58] restoration once Cyrus the Great uh gave
[40:02] them Freedom it was an immediate
[40:05] restoration of everything when they got
[40:07] there initially they had
[40:09] resistance um from the um Samaritans and
[40:13] the different Arabs and the different
[40:16] ones there and they had to fight for it
[40:18] and they had ups and downs God had to
[40:20] sent Ministry to inspire
[40:22] them and after a while things degradated
[40:26] where God had to send erra to clean up
[40:29] the land apply the
[40:30] token so it took time that restoration
[40:33] process took time it was a line upon
[40:34] line here a little there a little kind
[40:37] of a
[40:38] process and then we also talked about
[40:41] the primary enemies that neiah had which
[40:44] was selat and toaya who were uh tobah
[40:48] was an
[40:49] amonite and sambat was a moabit and they
[40:54] were a constant Thor on neemias side you
[40:57] know we learned how sbl's name
[41:00] essentially means the same as Satan and
[41:02] he acts like Satan and he gives them a
[41:04] hard time the entire time
[41:07] but without a test there is no testimony
[41:11] and Nehemiah was going to have a
[41:12] testimony coming out of this and he was
[41:14] going to show how a Believer reacts to
[41:16] resistance you don't pay it no mind you
[41:19] don't have to fight it you just say you
[41:21] have no right no Memorial here and you
[41:25] walked away and at any point they were
[41:27] constantly trying to do trapped after
[41:29] trapped after trapped and neemi just
[41:31] ignored it cuz his purpose was to
[41:34] restore the walls and everything for him
[41:37] was driving towards that one purpose
[41:39] because without the walls the people
[41:42] were open to attack so it didn't matter
[41:45] what they were doing if they came on his
[41:48] Turf that's when they started doing The
[41:50] Sword and the the the
[41:53] shovel
[41:54] because we don't go looking for the
[41:56] devil if the devil steps on our
[41:58] territory that's when we deal with them
[42:01] but we don't have to negotiate with them
[42:02] we don't need to talk to them we don't
[42:04] need to listen to them we don't need to
[42:06] do any of
[42:07] it so we learn about them and their
[42:09] background and uh essentially the last
[42:12] part we saw was where Nehemiah was
[42:14] saying you have no right no Memorial
[42:16] here I'm not going to argue with you
[42:18] okay so uh this time around we're going
[42:21] to go through chapter three and chapter
[42:22] 3 is a bit of a an odd chapter in the
[42:25] book of Nehemiah it's a lot like those
[42:28] like uh Luke 2 I believe it is where
[42:30] it's or Luke 1 where it's you know
[42:32] Joseph had James and James had Isaac and
[42:34] Isaac had you know Rio BMA or whatever
[42:37] it's a very long chapter with a lot of
[42:40] this family took care of this section of
[42:43] a wall this family took this section of
[42:45] the wall and I was dying to not do
[42:48] it but I felt to do it and because
[42:51] there's good stuff in it and same thing
[42:53] with with those bat chapters
[42:55] like honestly if you read through it
[42:58] there are things in it because if you
[43:00] look at the um in Genesis where it talks
[43:03] about the the first seven from Adam to
[43:06] uh to Noah the meanings of those
[43:09] names spell out the Plan of
[43:12] Redemption literally word for word of
[43:15] what God was going to do so it it pays
[43:17] to read your Bible even the boring Parts
[43:20] because in the boring Parts there's
[43:21] little nuggets and chapter 3 is one of
[43:23] those chapters so it's going to be a
[43:25] little bit different tonight in terms
[43:26] I'm not going to go go through
[43:27] chronologically because it's just it's a
[43:29] lot of like this Tower is built this
[43:31] pool is built this wall was built this
[43:32] gate was built but they're still good in
[43:34] it all right so we're going to talk
[43:36] about how Jerusalem has gone through
[43:39] many
[43:40] things over the thousands of years that
[43:43] it it's existed it's been fought for
[43:45] over constantly it's been built
[43:47] massively it's shrank down it's had the
[43:50] Ottomans it's had the Muslims it had the
[43:52] British it had you know the Crusader
[43:55] Knights it had the Templars it's the
[43:57] history of Jerusalem is is is incredible
[44:02] because Jerusalem is is part of Prophecy
[44:05] and it's something that God has
[44:07] treasured and therefore Satan wants it
[44:11] and he's always tried to destroy it and
[44:13] he's always tried to to ruin in in
[44:15] whatever way so we're just going to
[44:17] quickly go through where jsdm started
[44:20] and what Nehemiah was dealing with so
[44:22] the first Biblical reference that we see
[44:24] to Jerusalem in the Bible is found when
[44:27] Abraham encounters mzc because MDC is
[44:31] known as the king of
[44:32] Salem so that's the first mention of
[44:35] Jerusalem in the Bible and Salem as we
[44:37] know is is is peace and mzc was the king
[44:40] of Peace as we know he was Christ in
[44:42] another form and thank God for a prophet
[44:44] to reveal that because no one knew that
[44:46] until he came around so he was the king
[44:49] of
[44:50] Peace So the actual name then Jerusalem
[44:53] is then mentioned in Joshua after Joshua
[44:56] and the Israelites take
[44:58] AI uh in Joshua
[45:01] 10:3 so when you add Jer uh jeru to
[45:05] Salem it means city of Peace okay and
[45:09] brother Bram says uh in the Bible when
[45:13] you because you always you see Zion you
[45:15] see Jerusalem you see the city of David
[45:18] there's many different names for
[45:20] Jerusalem but when you see Zion Zion
[45:22] means the bride you can literally insert
[45:25] bride anytime you read it
[45:27] so Jerusalem is near and dear to God's
[45:30] heart so in this first instance here we
[45:33] see this is what constitutes the city of
[45:36] David ignore all the little words I took
[45:40] this from a study Bible
[45:43] online and I couldn't get rid of the
[45:45] words okay so the lines in the words
[45:49] ignore them okay they're not important
[45:51] the whole point I want to I want to show
[45:53] here is that Jerusalem it's good to
[45:55] visualize
[45:57] what it is that we're talking about
[46:00] because it's like for those who were
[46:02] blessed enough to be able to go to
[46:04] Israel when you read the Bible before
[46:06] you go to Israel versus what the Bible
[46:08] is like after you read or you go to
[46:10] Israel sorry it's two very different
[46:12] experiences okay so the same thing here
[46:15] if if you see it it makes makes more
[46:18] sense okay so this here is what the city
[46:22] of David looked like okay so before
[46:26] David David
[46:27] took the city of
[46:30] David it was um it was the Fortress of
[46:34] Zion from the
[46:35] jebusites and this was around a th000 BC
[46:39] um and we all know the story about how
[46:41] joab goes to the well goes up through
[46:44] opens the gates and they essentially
[46:45] kill everyone and they take it so the
[46:48] city of David doesn't really expand
[46:50] because David was told by God that no
[46:54] you're not going to build the temple
[46:55] you're a bloody man
[46:57] okay but he had to do the bloody work in
[47:00] order for his son to benefit from it so
[47:03] he what he what David does is that he
[47:05] prepares for his son like what a good
[47:08] father should do for his children okay
[47:11] and David collects all the Timber from
[47:14] Lebanon he collects all the gold he
[47:16] collects all the jewels all the things
[47:18] that the temple is going to need he
[47:19] collects it and this hill that you see
[47:21] up in the passive City there that is
[47:24] Mount Mariah okay Mount Mariah is famous
[47:27] in scripture as a place where
[47:29] Abraham sacrificed or tried to sacrifice
[47:33] Isaac that was where that happened okay
[47:38] so once David is done from the scene
[47:41] Solomon then takes the initiative and
[47:44] builds the temple exactly where that
[47:47] happens okay so the city of David is
[47:50] essentially right now is just two two
[47:52] Hills you got the kidon valley below and
[47:54] you got other things all around it so
[47:56] it's very small very very small when
[47:59] Solomon comes around then you see it
[48:01] expands up north and this is all from
[48:03] the same perspective so you'll see how
[48:04] it grows and this is from the western
[48:08] side of the mount olives looking towards
[48:09] the
[48:10] city so the city David then expands
[48:13] North and you see that's where in the
[48:15] back there you see the temple the Temple
[48:18] Mount Solomon's Palace and all
[48:21] that after Solomon passes on it goes
[48:23] through many generations and Hezekiah is
[48:25] the next big one and he expands it all
[48:27] the way to the west and it's a huge
[48:29] expansion that he does here and Hezekiah
[48:31] is actually famous in scripture for that
[48:33] there was a lot of arch or um a lot of
[48:38] uh I'm forgetting the word but like
[48:40] great building projects that he did like
[48:42] uh when sakb and the Assyrians were
[48:45] around he he prepared uh by getting a a
[48:48] tunnel dug to bring in fresh water into
[48:51] the city so he was he was a man of
[48:53] renown in that way so after
[48:57] the city of Jerusalem is expanded to the
[48:59] west and you have Hezekiah do all that
[49:02] then it wasn't many generations before
[49:04] the Babylonians come and it left like
[49:06] this okay whole place is burning
[49:09] Nebuchadnezzar does a great job of
[49:11] destroying the city he destroys the
[49:12] temple he destroys all the walls the
[49:14] gates it's left Ru it's not a nice place
[49:17] to live so what Nehemiah comes back to
[49:22] again ignore all the
[49:24] words you see to the to the left here
[49:27] it's all
[49:28] destroyed it's all gone okay so all s or
[49:33] all Nehemiah is building is this old
[49:36] portion of the city of David and the
[49:38] temple it's not this big huge thing
[49:41] because everyone thinks about jwm as
[49:43] what you see in like Jesus of Nazareth
[49:46] or whatever this huge thing because it
[49:49] it it it was only this during the time
[49:52] of Nehemiah so in 400 years from
[49:53] Nehemiah to Jesus it expands to this
[49:56] agree a lot of that has to do with Herod
[49:58] the Great Herod the Great massively
[50:01] expanded the temple uh as you can see
[50:04] the the it was very Roman inspired huge
[50:06] columns um and it just it's this huge
[50:10] thing and just for everyone's um
[50:14] interest behind the temple there is the
[50:18] is is the Western Wall and the Western
[50:19] Wall is is where the floor is of the
[50:23] temple the Western Wall is this type is
[50:26] a retain
[50:27] wall it's the retaining wall so that's
[50:30] all that's left of Solomon's Temple that
[50:32] the Jews have access to is that behind
[50:35] the temple the retaining wall that's it
[50:38] and then were the um I wish I had a
[50:43] pointer up in this corner up there where
[50:46] it's kind of a v that's where they say
[50:49] gol gotha
[50:51] was was behind the city Mount of olves
[50:54] is here where gets semon was but it's
[50:58] behind the city is where go goth and
[51:01] they can't really Peg it down because
[51:03] it's 2,000 years but they they they
[51:06] think they found a a
[51:09] um it's called
[51:12] um the GOL goth is called the place of
[51:14] the skull and there's literally a place
[51:15] where it literally looks like a a human
[51:18] skull you guys have seen yeah so that's
[51:23] where they presume it is so anyways so
[51:25] that's what everyone thinks when they
[51:26] think of Jerusalem is this huge
[51:27] expansive thing it's not it's this city
[51:31] of David solon's Temple and the walls
[51:34] and that whole length it's still not a
[51:37] small thing don't get me wrong it's
[51:39] still two and a half miles of
[51:42] walls okay so about 220 acres is is the
[51:45] total menal land that Nehemiah needs to
[51:48] restore here this is not a small
[51:51] project and what's crazy is that they
[51:53] say they finished this between 40 and 50
[51:56] 5
[51:58] days a bunch of
[52:00] inexperienced Farmers
[52:03] Merchants Etc 40 to 55
[52:08] days
[52:10] okay
[52:12] so if we turn to neemi 2 I'm going to be
[52:14] reading through this it's up to you if
[52:15] you want to read it but I'm going to be
[52:17] going through it so at this point Again
[52:20] The Remnant in Jerusalem are are ashamed
[52:24] they are open to the attacks of the
[52:26] enemy and at that point it's it's people
[52:28] like the amonites and all the different
[52:31] old enemies that they
[52:33] have uh and a city with broken wolves is
[52:36] all is always a shameful thing and you
[52:38] see in Proverbs where uh a man who
[52:41] doesn't have self-control is Like a Man
[52:42] Without Walls so the the the city was
[52:45] not a safe place to be in it wasn't a
[52:47] comfortable place to live and it was uh
[52:50] reproach upon the name of Jehovah so
[52:53] Nehemiah when he gets there he says in
[52:56] uh chapter 2: 17 then said I unto them
[53:00] you see the distress that we are in how
[53:02] Jerusalem lith waste and the gates there
[53:04] are burned with fire come and let us
[53:07] build up the wall of Jerusalem that we
[53:08] be no more our approach then un told him
[53:10] of the hand of my God which is good upon
[53:12] me as also the king's words that he had
[53:15] spoken unto me and they said let us rise
[53:17] up and build so they strengthen their
[53:19] hands for this good
[53:21] work so Nehemiah comes with a vision
[53:25] with that a vision the people perish and
[53:27] he inspires their faith okay and faith
[53:29] is contagious provoke one another unto
[53:31] good works and like you'll see in
[53:34] scripture and even in our own lives if
[53:36] one person Rises up with faith it can
[53:39] spread you look God only needs one you
[53:42] look at a Revival God just needs one
[53:45] sincere yielded person and God can go
[53:47] through that person and spread and we've
[53:50] seen it in our own church where you go
[53:52] through JY seasons and you just need a
[53:54] couple praying people and God can work
[53:56] through
[53:57] amen it's like that U Chad's favorite
[54:00] sermon of all time power versus Force by
[54:03] Brother Lonnie Jenkins and he talks
[54:04] about how when you
[54:06] have a when you have a supernatural
[54:09] being living in your heart and you're
[54:13] along with other people who have that
[54:15] same supernatural being in their heart
[54:17] when they focus towards something when
[54:19] they start praying towards the same goal
[54:22] it's like a giant bunch of laser beams
[54:24] focusing on the problem and that thing
[54:26] goes amen because it's creative Force
[54:29] amen you know it's just Jesus even said
[54:32] it like you're are
[54:34] gods and you have creative power and in
[54:37] in in in the power of the tongue is
[54:38] death and life so Nehemiah
[54:42] here he C he catches the vision when he
[54:46] hears about the problem he gets the
[54:49] authority of the
[54:51] king and he goes to the people he
[54:53] inspires them and now they in all this
[54:56] time they are discouraged they're afraid
[54:59] they're not doing anything and then
[55:01] finally they have the faith to do the
[55:03] job so as we've seen like this is a huge
[55:06] job that they have to do two and a half
[55:08] miles of walls that they have to restore
[55:09] and to rebuild this is not a small job
[55:12] okay so he needs help Nehemiah can't do
[55:14] it all himself you know he he would have
[55:18] died building the first gate but he
[55:20] needed people but he's also just
[55:22] administrator he was just a
[55:24] soft-handed white collar
[55:27] wine cup Bearer
[55:29] okay I'm sure he didn't really work with
[55:32] stone much helping the king but God
[55:36] chose
[55:37] him okay his ways are not our ways you
[55:41] know his thoughts are not our thoughts
[55:43] and God specially selected him for his
[55:47] character and you see why God chose him
[55:50] for his character by the way he reacts
[55:53] when trouble Rises what does he do does
[55:56] does he freak out like Saul or does he
[55:59] go to prayer as David does and we see it
[56:01] in Nehemiah even though he's not a noble
[56:03] he's not a priest he's not a prophet
[56:06] he's not even a preacher he's not the
[56:08] Son of a Preacher he's just a simple
[56:11] administrator who has a burden who has a
[56:14] sincere heart that's yielded to the Lord
[56:16] and that's all God needed for this
[56:18] situation for God to
[56:21] move okay so he can't do it all himself
[56:24] he needs everyone to help and to do the
[56:26] work to rebuild the walls so like I said
[56:28] in chapter 3 it's it's
[56:31] Nehemiah and it doesn't say specifically
[56:33] it's Nehemiah selecting each person
[56:36] but it's kind of obvious through the
[56:38] scripture that each person was given a
[56:40] portion of the wall to
[56:42] do and you see some in you see an
[56:44] instance
[56:46] where uh for one section the uh the
[56:49] leaders of the group that was sey to
[56:51] refus to do the
[56:52] work but everyone else does it and
[56:55] everyone else does it
[56:57] willingly willingly because if you
[57:00] remember in scripture when Moses was
[57:02] building the Tabernacle and Gathering
[57:04] all the things for the Tabernacle
[57:07] Tabernacle the number one requirement
[57:09] for anyone working on that Tabernacle
[57:11] was
[57:12] what they had to be of a willing heart
[57:17] no one was going to be coerced into
[57:18] doing
[57:20] anything why is that it's the principle
[57:23] whatsoever is not of faith is sin and if
[57:26] you got to drag someone to do something
[57:28] leave them
[57:29] be leave them be it's no different than
[57:31] the the the parable that Jesus talks
[57:33] about how he he uh the about the father
[57:36] who asked the one son to do the job he
[57:38] said no the other one said yes ends up
[57:41] not doing it the other one who said no
[57:43] ends up doing it who was the better one
[57:46] the one who said no and ended up doing
[57:47] it because it showed at the end of the
[57:49] day it wasn't just lip service it took
[57:52] him time to get to to get around to the
[57:54] idea of doing it to have the burden to
[57:55] do it but he end up doing
[57:59] it so whatever the role the person has
[58:03] to be willing in the church at the home
[58:07] at the job whatever it may be if you got
[58:09] to force someone to do it leave them be
[58:11] it's not going to be a blessing it's
[58:12] going to be done out of there's going to
[58:14] be a spear behind
[58:15] it you don't want it you don't want it
[58:20] so
[58:21] God if if God can have someone who's of
[58:24] a willing hurt then that's all he need
[58:26] needs because he just he works through
[58:27] empty human vessels and if that person
[58:30] is willing to do it then they've yielded
[58:32] themselves to the job to do it they've
[58:35] let go of their own ego they've let go
[58:36] of their own wants and desires how it
[58:38] should be
[58:39] done and they'll just do as God
[58:42] says am all right so Nehemiah div divies
[58:47] out all the different uh sections of the
[58:51] walls and it it and you see it's it's
[58:54] it's everyone it's not just the
[58:56] inhabitants of Jerusalem you got people
[58:57] who live outside Jerusalem you got
[58:58] Farmers you got Merchants you got
[58:59] everyone and everyone is asked to do the
[59:04] job and when you go through the the the
[59:08] different verses of it as you see here
[59:11] the first one and next unto them
[59:13] repaired metalia the gibeonite so what's
[59:15] a gibeonite a gibeonite is a gentile the
[59:19] gibian or the Gibbon nightes were the
[59:21] ones who uh when Joshua was coming in
[59:25] they were afraid they would be destroyed
[59:27] like Jericho and AI so they were the
[59:30] ones who disguised themselves with the
[59:32] old um clothes and they made themselves
[59:36] look like they came on a long journey
[59:37] and they gave themselves old wine skins
[59:40] filled with old wine to show that it's
[59:42] been such a long time they had rotting
[59:43] bread everything they thought of
[59:45] everything and Joshua didn't pray about
[59:48] it made an alliance with them it comes
[59:51] out that they lied to Joshua Joshua
[59:54] can't get mad at them because he never
[59:55] went to the Lord about it so what Joshua
[59:59] does is that because you have deceived
[1:00:01] us you're going to be our servants
[1:00:02] forever and what the end up being is
[1:00:05] they are servants uh at the temple so
[1:00:08] you will always see in Scripture A Gian
[1:00:10] night in the area of the temple so
[1:00:14] Nehemiah is giving the work to
[1:00:17] Gentiles all right let's continue and
[1:00:19] Jon the marinite the men of gibian and
[1:00:21] of mispa Unto the Throne of the governor
[1:00:23] on this side the river so we have
[1:00:25] gentiles next unto him repaired yuil the
[1:00:29] son of harah of the goldsmiths next unto
[1:00:32] him also repaired Hanah the son of the
[1:00:34] apothecaries and they fortifi jwim unto
[1:00:36] the broad wall so Goldsmith obviously is
[1:00:38] someone who worked with
[1:00:39] gold uh and the apothecaries is like an
[1:00:42] ancient pharmacist um another
[1:00:46] interpretation of it is a
[1:00:50] perfumer anyways potato potato so um you
[1:00:55] have white caller people working on this
[1:00:59] Matt and you have goldsmiths like Matt
[1:01:03] and you have apothecaries like me
[1:01:05] working on it
[1:01:07] okay both equal you know
[1:01:10] responsibilities and
[1:01:12] stuff very different skill sets but
[1:01:15] willing hurs working towards the same
[1:01:17] goal so we have Gentiles we have white
[1:01:21] collar we have blue
[1:01:24] collar and as you move on you see here
[1:01:26] and next unto them repaired Rafi the son
[1:01:29] of her the ruler of the half part of
[1:01:30] Jerusalem okay wow so this is
[1:01:34] essentially and you see this a lot in
[1:01:36] this chapter where like there's a lot of
[1:01:38] these towns have they rule half of it
[1:01:41] it's not like a full mayor of the city
[1:01:43] or whatever like it's like a half
[1:01:45] mayor so we have you know the executive
[1:01:50] we have the the
[1:01:52] highest Echelon of society working on
[1:01:55] this
[1:01:56] and next onto him repaired uh repaired
[1:01:59] shalum the son of hes the ruler of the
[1:02:02] half part of Jerusalem he and his
[1:02:04] daughters so he's this guy is the ruler
[1:02:07] of the other half of Jerusalem and
[1:02:08] what's interesting about this one is
[1:02:09] that him and his daughters are the ones
[1:02:12] repairing
[1:02:13] it okay that's interesting so you got
[1:02:15] Gentiles you have goldsmiths you have
[1:02:18] apothecaries you have rulers and
[1:02:21] women it's
[1:02:23] interesting and after after him prep the
[1:02:26] priest the men of the plane and you have
[1:02:28] the
[1:02:29] priesthood everyone here is rolling up
[1:02:32] their sleeves and going to work there's
[1:02:35] no egos
[1:02:36] here
[1:02:39] okay
[1:02:41] so
[1:02:42] despite the status of their wealth level
[1:02:46] of
[1:02:46] Education whether or not they're even
[1:02:48] experienced working at repairing you
[1:02:51] know stone walls and Gates Building
[1:02:53] towers and making sure that the the gate
[1:02:57] is straight when you build it
[1:02:59] and it's all it's everyone everyone's
[1:03:02] part of it and what was the number one
[1:03:04] requirement was the number one
[1:03:05] requirement you need to have at least
[1:03:06] five to 10 years of
[1:03:09] stonean uh credentials you need to go to
[1:03:12] the stone University you need to have
[1:03:14] grade a stone tools and maybe we'll
[1:03:17] interview you no it was everyone and
[1:03:20] their dog can come and help because
[1:03:23] desperate times call for desperate
[1:03:25] desperate measures and when you see I
[1:03:27] don't mean this wrong but when you see
[1:03:28] in Scripture that like he and his
[1:03:30] daughters are helping that's that's when
[1:03:31] you know okay everyone's
[1:03:33] in when the Bible mentions the women
[1:03:35] it's it's very for a very specific
[1:03:38] reason so you have all tribes working on
[1:03:42] it you have people from the Royal tribe
[1:03:44] of J Judah you have you know the
[1:03:46] benjamites you have everyone working on
[1:03:47] it you have the priesthood you even have
[1:03:49] the high priest working on and we'll get
[1:03:51] to that in a little bit so at the end of
[1:03:53] the day it didn't didn't matter what
[1:03:55] they brought to the
[1:03:56] table God didn't
[1:03:59] care all he cared about was were you
[1:04:03] willing and do you want to fix the
[1:04:08] situation okay and so what what does
[1:04:10] that mean for us so if we go to First
[1:04:11] Corinthians chap 12 starting at verse
[1:04:14] 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:04:17] into one body whether we be Jews or
[1:04:19] Gentiles whether we be bonded or free
[1:04:21] and have been made to drink into one
[1:04:23] spirit for the body is not one member
[1:04:25] but many if the foot shall say because
[1:04:28] I'm not the hand I am not of the body is
[1:04:30] it therefore not of the body and if the
[1:04:31] ear shall say because I'm not the eye
[1:04:33] I'm not of the
[1:04:35] body is it therefore not of the body if
[1:04:38] the whole body were an eye where were
[1:04:40] the hearing if the whole were hearing
[1:04:41] where were the smelling but now hath God
[1:04:44] set the members of every one of them in
[1:04:45] the body as it hath pleased him and if
[1:04:49] were all one member where were the body
[1:04:51] but now are they many members yes yet
[1:04:54] but one body
[1:04:56] so it makes a bit more sense in the
[1:04:58] Amplified for by one Holy Spirit we're
[1:05:00] all baptized into one body spiritually
[1:05:02] transformed United together whether Jews
[1:05:05] or Greeks Gentiles slaves or free and we
[1:05:09] were all made to drink of one Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit since the same Holy Spirit fills
[1:05:13] each life for the human body does not
[1:05:14] consist of one part but of many Limbs
[1:05:16] and organs if the foot says because I'm
[1:05:18] not a hand I'm not part of the body is
[1:05:21] it not on the contrary still a part of
[1:05:23] the body if the ear says because I'm not
[1:05:25] an eye I'm not part of the body is it
[1:05:29] not on the contrary still a part of the
[1:05:30] body if the whole body were an eye where
[1:05:33] would the hearing be if the whole body
[1:05:34] were an ear where would the sense of
[1:05:36] smell be but now as things really are
[1:05:38] God has placed and arranged the parts in
[1:05:40] the body each of them just as he will
[1:05:43] and saw fit with the best balance of
[1:05:46] function if they were all a single organ
[1:05:49] where would the rest of the body be but
[1:05:51] now as things really are there are many
[1:05:53] parts different Limbs and organ orans
[1:05:55] but a single body I thought the amplifi
[1:05:59] did a great job there
[1:06:01] because God has placed and arranged the
[1:06:04] parts in the body each one of them just
[1:06:06] as he willed and saw fit with the best
[1:06:08] balance of function okay it is God who
[1:06:11] places in orders each person in the body
[1:06:14] as a whole locally in the body and
[1:06:19] everywhere because he is the master
[1:06:21] builder and he knows what he's doing so
[1:06:25] a Church body is a variety of
[1:06:28] members and each church is different
[1:06:30] from one another you have churches who
[1:06:32] are more emotional and you got churches
[1:06:35] who are a bit more teaching and you have
[1:06:37] ones that
[1:06:38] are you know more gifts on display but
[1:06:42] it's all the one body you got churches
[1:06:44] who are very focused on missions they're
[1:06:46] missions missions missions and God has a
[1:06:48] reason for that because each person each
[1:06:52] Church in the body has a different role
[1:06:53] for a different reason and and not
[1:06:55] everyone can be the same
[1:06:58] thing okay so every person no matter the
[1:07:02] variety of
[1:07:03] members God has placed each and every
[1:07:06] one of us in the body for a particular
[1:07:07] purpose and for a reason and all through
[1:07:10] your life God has ordered your life in
[1:07:12] such a way to prepare you for the
[1:07:13] position that you're in and it's always
[1:07:15] a continual training everything that you
[1:07:18] go through is for training the good and
[1:07:20] the bad and it's up to you whether or
[1:07:22] not you're going to learn from it so if
[1:07:24] you want to be
[1:07:26] of use be thankful for the things that
[1:07:28] AR that that that you know sharpen you
[1:07:32] down as iron sharp with iron so another
[1:07:34] man sharpens another man like it it's
[1:07:36] you need that friction in your life to
[1:07:39] constantly make you uh keep you on your
[1:07:43] toes to be of use to the body to to to
[1:07:46] be in the channel and without those
[1:07:48] trials without those moments of just
[1:07:51] clinging to the Cross you're you're
[1:07:53] going to just Sail on through life
[1:07:56] and you're not going to be of any use to
[1:07:58] anybody because it's only through great
[1:08:01] suffering do you have great blessings
[1:08:03] and it doesn't mean that the most
[1:08:05] suffering person is automatically going
[1:08:06] to get the most blessings it's not it's
[1:08:08] not the equation okay
[1:08:11] but what it means is that without the
[1:08:15] honing without the
[1:08:18] grindstone without the day in day out
[1:08:21] God rubbing those those bad spots away
[1:08:24] from your life
[1:08:26] you're not going to be of use you're not
[1:08:28] going to be of the the most potential
[1:08:30] that you need to
[1:08:32] be so uh there's a great quote here from
[1:08:34] a prisoner God sometimes takes his
[1:08:36] people out like that and shaves a few of
[1:08:37] their own wheels off shows them that
[1:08:39] they just can't do what they want to do
[1:08:41] you know what I mean they're not in
[1:08:42] Liberty to do what they want to do
[1:08:43] before they could come into full power
[1:08:45] and be a love slave to Christ they have
[1:08:47] to be shaved off and then presented
[1:08:49] sometimes he takes them to the desert to
[1:08:51] do that to shave them off and then bring
[1:08:52] them out the anointed one to fulfill the
[1:08:54] purpose that he's ordained to be number
[1:08:56] one example of that is Moses you have
[1:08:58] someone who's been for 40 years trained
[1:09:00] by the Egyptians to be the best possible
[1:09:02] General to be the best possible pharaoh
[1:09:04] to be the best possible everything that
[1:09:06] you can be and God has to go out for 40
[1:09:08] years and beat it all out of them and
[1:09:11] brother Carmen talks talked about it he
[1:09:13] gave him an equally tempered
[1:09:17] wife and that's what God used he used
[1:09:19] his wife and a bunch of
[1:09:21] sheep to
[1:09:23] prepare arguably one of the greatest
[1:09:25] prop phets the Bible has ever seen to be
[1:09:29] ready to deliver his people from the
[1:09:31] greatest nation at the scene so God can
[1:09:34] use anything like there there's times
[1:09:36] where we're like oh man if I could just
[1:09:38] get away and just be a Hermit and not
[1:09:40] have to deal with people it doesn't
[1:09:42] matter if you bring your wife and your
[1:09:43] kids and your dog God's going to use it
[1:09:46] if you just bring your dog God's going
[1:09:48] to use it it doesn't
[1:09:49] matter God's going to use anything and
[1:09:53] if it's just you he'll use the weather
[1:09:54] it's say
[1:09:56] God is not bound by
[1:09:59] anything we we are the ones who think
[1:10:03] that we can get away with it but God
[1:10:05] knows so everyone in the church body
[1:10:10] whether it be the local body or the the
[1:10:12] the greater body has the one goal to
[1:10:14] further the kingdom of God doesn't
[1:10:16] matter what we bring to the table
[1:10:17] doesn't matter how little we think we
[1:10:19] are or how important how unimportant we
[1:10:21] think we are how little people may
[1:10:23] notice you or thank you God is not
[1:10:25] limited by your thoughts God is not
[1:10:27] limited by your complexes he's not
[1:10:29] limited by your upbringing he's not
[1:10:30] limited by your lack of intelligence
[1:10:34] or your abundance of of intelligence
[1:10:37] he's not limited by the people around
[1:10:40] you he's not limited by your resources
[1:10:43] around you nothing is can limit God here
[1:10:48] because Satan what what what is Satan
[1:10:49] trying to do he's trying to constantly
[1:10:51] undermine you and your effect in the
[1:10:53] local body so he's trying to use
[1:10:54] whatever he can
[1:10:55] to to to
[1:10:58] siphon the effectiveness of your life
[1:11:01] and that's why we have to be conscious
[1:11:04] and and and always examining our lives
[1:11:07] in terms of the things that are filling
[1:11:09] up our time for one and also examining
[1:11:12] our life for things that are displeasing
[1:11:14] to the Lord and that's where you know
[1:11:16] phones are obviously the the the most
[1:11:18] obvious one that's filling up everyone's
[1:11:20] time but it could be you know a complex
[1:11:23] that you have or a way of thinking or if
[1:11:25] you're constantly like I'm I'm the
[1:11:27] lowest one I'm I'm no good I'm no matter
[1:11:31] what it is it's you're the one limiting
[1:11:35] yourself your confession your confession
[1:11:37] is
[1:11:38] important you know like I just said like
[1:11:41] out of the mouth is life and
[1:11:45] death it doesn't mean that you have to
[1:11:47] be you know I'm the greatest all the
[1:11:50] time that's not that's not what we need
[1:11:52] to be but you don't need to just do the
[1:11:55] job of the
[1:11:57] devil where you just pound yourself into
[1:11:59] the ground
[1:12:01] until you're making it easy for
[1:12:03] him
[1:12:06] so throughout your life Satan is always
[1:12:08] examining you he's always looking at
[1:12:11] okay why is this guy's weakness and he's
[1:12:12] constantly trying to probe and push
[1:12:14] wherever he
[1:12:15] can to get you to crumble and you know
[1:12:18] throughout your life he doesn't let up
[1:12:21] he's always active he's always trying to
[1:12:23] push probe no matter what it is and
[1:12:25] that's why we always have to be like the
[1:12:28] um the 300 with with kidon where we
[1:12:31] constantly have to be aware constantly
[1:12:33] examining constantly feeding in order to
[1:12:36] be aware and have the discernment to
[1:12:38] recognize the devil at every one of his
[1:12:39] tricks because like brother Bram said
[1:12:42] the devil is allowed one punch and you
[1:12:44] got to cover that area all your life
[1:12:48] constantly and it's your job it's your
[1:12:50] job to cover that now how do you cover
[1:12:53] that read your Bible and pray
[1:12:56] everything comes back to
[1:12:59] that
[1:13:01] so we have an adversary you you read in
[1:13:04] Zechariah there's a a vision that um
[1:13:07] Zachariah has of the high priest and
[1:13:10] he's he's dressed in filthy
[1:13:12] robes you have the angel Lord on one
[1:13:14] side and you have the devil on the other
[1:13:16] accusing him and the high
[1:13:19] priest is uh the the angel Lord says to
[1:13:22] him give him pure white clothing
[1:13:26] but the thing of it is is that the
[1:13:27] devil's right there accusing him
[1:13:29] constantly and throughout our life the
[1:13:31] devil's just right there constantly
[1:13:33] accusing no matter if it's true or not
[1:13:35] he's constantly accusing and that's why
[1:13:37] you got to discern every thought that
[1:13:39] comes in because he's not coming in you
[1:13:42] know I'm the Devil he's not going to be
[1:13:45] that obvious he's go like for a Believer
[1:13:48] he's going to be coming in slly he's
[1:13:49] going to be coming in
[1:13:51] subtle and that's why you got to examine
[1:13:54] every thought that comes in is it of God
[1:13:57] or is it of not don't let any Nest be
[1:14:00] built
[1:14:02] up okay this next uh quote here if God
[1:14:06] when I was in alien from him so loved me
[1:14:09] till he stooped down to get me and pick
[1:14:10] me up that gives me confidence that he
[1:14:12] wants to use me he's got a purpose in
[1:14:14] doing it he's seen something in me he's
[1:14:16] seen something in you he had a reason to
[1:14:18] save you look at the people that's
[1:14:19] unsaved today look at the millions he
[1:14:20] could have took beside you but he took
[1:14:22] you amen no one can take your place
[1:14:25] you're in God's economy no one can do
[1:14:27] that that's his love to you then why
[1:14:30] then won't Your Love reach right back to
[1:14:32] him and there's a love
[1:14:34] affair so essentially what he's saying
[1:14:38] here is
[1:14:39] that the grace of God to you is that he
[1:14:41] chose you despite your upbringing
[1:14:43] despite you know the coffees being
[1:14:45] criminals he chose dad a
[1:14:49] hippie you know with a giant afro who
[1:14:52] had no more a red AF afro with no more
[1:14:56] consciousness of God
[1:14:58] than Jo blow down the
[1:15:01] road but what did God see God saw that c
[1:15:04] genina God and said that's my son and
[1:15:08] he's going to start a work which he
[1:15:11] did not of anything of that he can lay
[1:15:15] claim to not of his own
[1:15:17] Merit but God chose
[1:15:20] him and he chose you and he chose you
[1:15:23] for a purpose and no one can take your
[1:15:25] place no matter how much the devil may
[1:15:27] say likewise or you may say to yourself
[1:15:30] likewise you have a purpose you have a
[1:15:32] place and God will use you and he
[1:15:34] doesn't need you to be perfectly
[1:15:36] prepared yourself he's he's going to
[1:15:40] take you and he's going to go Smash and
[1:15:45] then start rebuilding
[1:15:46] you okay he's going to take all the old
[1:15:51] uh things that your parents planted in
[1:15:53] you that should never be planted you in
[1:15:55] terms of complexes or issues or whatever
[1:15:57] he's going to he's he's going to work
[1:16:00] with you mold you prepare you it's going
[1:16:04] to take time but once he has you in a
[1:16:07] place where he can use
[1:16:09] you then it's a matter of
[1:16:12] yielding it's a matter of saying Here I
[1:16:15] Am Lord send me amen and after that you
[1:16:19] have to trust that wherever he sends you
[1:16:22] he will take care of you no matter what
[1:16:25] happens
[1:16:27] especially when it's all going to ruin
[1:16:30] around
[1:16:32] you we all have those Seasons where it's
[1:16:35] just it feels like there's four trains
[1:16:37] coming at you from every
[1:16:39] direction and if God has placed you
[1:16:42] there having done all the stand you
[1:16:45] stand even though the trains are getting
[1:16:49] closer you got to trust I love the quote
[1:16:52] brother brandom I don't have it here but
[1:16:53] he talks about how I
[1:16:55] he says I love those moments where I
[1:16:57] come up to a cliff and and he says I
[1:17:01] don't know what to do and what God does
[1:17:03] is that he either takes me above the
[1:17:06] cliff or he takes the cliff
[1:17:09] away God is not limited by time matter
[1:17:11] our space he's not limited by our
[1:17:14] thoughts he's not limited by Satan he's
[1:17:15] not limited by circumstances and God is
[1:17:17] a master of the last second answer you
[1:17:20] look at the three Hebrew children when
[1:17:22] did he answer when they were in the
[1:17:26] fire everyone is falling dead around
[1:17:29] them nothing's happening okay we're good
[1:17:32] I guess we're going to step in step in
[1:17:34] nothing happens okay I guess we'll just
[1:17:37] walk around and then they see the Fourth
[1:17:39] Man In The Fire And what what is the
[1:17:42] only thing that burns what's the only
[1:17:44] thing that goes away in the situation
[1:17:47] the Rope binding them and their enemy
[1:17:50] the guard that threw them in there
[1:17:52] that's the only two things
[1:17:58] it's at the end of the trial is the
[1:18:02] reward you have need of
[1:18:06] patience because God or brother Bram
[1:18:09] talks about overcoming he said
[1:18:11] overcoming is not God having you in a
[1:18:14] pipe God reaching his hand in going you
[1:18:18] overcame that's not
[1:18:20] overcoming God has a part for you to
[1:18:23] play in it and that's why you you see in
[1:18:25] the greatest battle ever fought my
[1:18:28] favorite
[1:18:29] message and he talks about that little
[1:18:31] chick and he said that chick has one
[1:18:36] Instinct it's desperate for life and
[1:18:40] what do it do it does the only thing
[1:18:42] that it knows to do at that point which
[1:18:44] is to Peck and Peck and peck on the same
[1:18:47] spot it has no idea why it's doing that
[1:18:50] and it's just going to keep on pecking
[1:18:51] until what it's through and if any one
[1:18:55] helps that thing it stunts it forever so
[1:18:57] you got to let it Peck and Peck and Peck
[1:19:00] until the whole thing it it headed
[1:19:01] through but it's still got to Peck
[1:19:03] because the whole thing got to go and as
[1:19:05] soon as that chick is out it's free and
[1:19:08] it has the strength that it needs to
[1:19:09] last the entire Journey amen that's
[1:19:11] right so that's why when it comes to the
[1:19:14] Christian walk the most important thing
[1:19:16] with the birth is the death the death
[1:19:19] before the birth is the order without
[1:19:22] the without the death there's no birth
[1:19:24] without the death there's no life
[1:19:25] without the death there's no strength
[1:19:28] amen and you see it with people they
[1:19:31] have a dried eyye
[1:19:32] confession and they never
[1:19:35] change and they're of no use to anyone
[1:19:38] or to
[1:19:40] themselves but what God requires in his
[1:19:43] children is the death amen and when you
[1:19:46] have really died and you know
[1:19:48] it you know when youve really died it's
[1:19:52] like I've I've said this before John
[1:19:54] said I I I had the worst sounding
[1:19:56] conversion experience he has ever heard
[1:19:58] in his
[1:19:59] life it was
[1:20:01] miserable and the only other person I
[1:20:03] know of that had a similar one was Mom
[1:20:05] where you know everyone knows with Mom
[1:20:08] it's strong Irish Catholic Family a lot
[1:20:12] of issue and God just throws in a hand
[1:20:15] grenade and boom but God allowed it and
[1:20:19] through through that she gets the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost and for me was the same
[1:20:26] thing I had to die hard so that I knew
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:32] anything that I could do afterward had
[1:20:35] to be because of him because I started
[1:20:37] off so low so unconfident so broken I
[1:20:41] knew that anything that I could
[1:20:43] accomplish from then on out was him and
[1:20:44] not me I was a
[1:20:48] wreck I was a
[1:20:50] wreck cuz what did God do he broke me
[1:20:54] but then what does he do he starts
[1:20:55] remolding
[1:20:56] you his gentleness has made me
[1:21:00] great David talks about in
[1:21:02] Psalms and it's through those moments of
[1:21:05] that death experience it feels like the
[1:21:07] worst thing in the world but it's the
[1:21:08] tender hand of
[1:21:10] Jehovah because why when you're pecking
[1:21:13] through that experience what you don't
[1:21:15] realize is that it's giving you the
[1:21:17] strength to the next
[1:21:19] journey and no one else can help you you
[1:21:21] got to do it
[1:21:22] yourself God has no grandchild
[1:21:25] you got to do it and when you come up to
[1:21:27] those
[1:21:28] moments you just start
[1:21:31] pecking you just start calling out to
[1:21:34] Father God to Father
[1:21:36] Eagle I'm coming I'm
[1:21:47] coming okay so just turning here so with
[1:21:51] the uh the book of nemiah you see
[1:21:53] there's mentions of Gates and walls okay
[1:21:56] so if we see here in Nehemiah 3 verse
[1:21:59] three but the fish gate to the sons of H
[1:22:02] built who also laid the beams thereof
[1:22:04] and set up the doors thereof the locks
[1:22:05] thereof and the bars thereof So within
[1:22:08] the the the city of Jerusalem there's 10
[1:22:11] Gates which we can see here in wow
[1:22:13] that's
[1:22:14] small okay I'll read it out so there's
[1:22:16] 10 Gates the fish gate the
[1:22:19] Sheep the fish gate the Sheep gate the
[1:22:21] inspection gate the East Gate the horse
[1:22:23] gate the water Water Gate the fountain
[1:22:25] gate the dung gate the valley gate and
[1:22:28] the old gate and they all had their
[1:22:30] different uses uh the Sheep gate is the
[1:22:33] gate in which the uh Temple priests
[1:22:36] would bring the sheep and the different
[1:22:39] sacrifices into the temple so that's
[1:22:40] where that was located and you can see
[1:22:42] it's right at where the temple
[1:22:44] was the fish gate is where the uh the
[1:22:47] fishermen of the sea gallilee would
[1:22:48] bring in their fish to sell which is
[1:22:51] strange because it's up near the temple
[1:22:53] but that's where it was the inspection
[1:22:55] gate is has to do with the military
[1:22:57] where uh David would uh inspect his men
[1:23:01] and then all the way down to the dung
[1:23:04] gate that's where all of Jerusalem's
[1:23:06] refuge and rubbage was taken out through
[1:23:10] so they would take it out to the valley
[1:23:11] of uh there's a valley there below and
[1:23:13] they would burn it so there's 10
[1:23:18] Gates and all throughout everyone's
[1:23:20] building it and some people are building
[1:23:24] a gate some people are building just a
[1:23:25] wall some people are building a weight
[1:23:27] and a wall and a gate some people are
[1:23:29] building pools some people are building
[1:23:30] Towers there's a lot to
[1:23:32] it but you know you look at the Sheep
[1:23:35] gate you know that that's high
[1:23:38] visibility the temple priests go through
[1:23:41] there a lot of prestige I got the Sheep
[1:23:43] gate guys and they come down to the dung
[1:23:47] gate I got the dungate Nehemiah chose me
[1:23:50] for the
[1:23:51] dungate who is volunteering for the
[1:23:53] dungate I'm sure
[1:23:55] Joe was okay God bless you brother
[1:23:59] Joe so no one had a choice in the matter
[1:24:03] of what part of the wall they were
[1:24:05] given Nehemiah here is a type of the
[1:24:08] Holy Ghost where it's selecting the
[1:24:10] right person for the
[1:24:11] job the right person for the Sheep gate
[1:24:15] was the high priest and the priest those
[1:24:17] were the ones who built the Sheep gate
[1:24:20] because it had to be done in a certain
[1:24:22] way and you go through there's different
[1:24:24] rulers there's different Merchants
[1:24:26] there's different people taking care of
[1:24:28] each wall but who wants the
[1:24:31] dungate it's where all the trash goes
[1:24:34] all the rubbish it
[1:24:38] stinks
[1:24:40] so the problem is is that if someone who
[1:24:44] is chosen to do the dungate is driven by
[1:24:46] ego and they don't want to do
[1:24:48] it the city is still at risk every part
[1:24:53] of the city has to be restored for
[1:24:55] everyone to be
[1:24:57] safe every part the good parts and the
[1:25:01] bad parts the good jobs and the bad jobs
[1:25:03] someone got to do it they got to do it
[1:25:04] well they got to do it willingly and
[1:25:06] they got to do it they got to do it
[1:25:09] otherwise it's a way for the enemy to
[1:25:11] get in so what does that mean for us
[1:25:14] continuing from 1 Corinthians 12 and the
[1:25:16] IE cannot say unto the hand I have no
[1:25:18] need of thee nor again the head to the
[1:25:20] feet I have no need of you name much
[1:25:22] more these members of the body which
[1:25:23] seem to be be more feeble are necessary
[1:25:26] and which seem to be more more feeble or
[1:25:28] I think I read reread that verse 23 and
[1:25:31] those members of the body which we think
[1:25:32] to be less honorable upon those we
[1:25:34] bestow more abundant honor and on our
[1:25:36] uncomely parts or like ugly Parts have
[1:25:39] more abundant comeliness for our comely
[1:25:41] Parts have no need but God has tampered
[1:25:43] the body together having giving more
[1:25:44] abundant honor to that part which lacked
[1:25:47] that there should be no Schism in the
[1:25:49] body but that the members should have
[1:25:50] the same care for one another and
[1:25:52] whether one member suffers all members
[1:25:54] suffer with it or one me member be
[1:25:56] honored all the members Rejoice with it
[1:25:58] now you are the body of Christ and
[1:25:59] members in particular again in the
[1:26:01] Amplified the I cannot say to the hand I
[1:26:03] have no need of you nor again the head
[1:26:05] to the feet I have no need of you but
[1:26:06] quite the contrary the parts of the body
[1:26:08] that seem to be weaker are absolutely
[1:26:11] necessary and as for those parts of the
[1:26:13] body which we consider less honorable
[1:26:16] these we trait with greater honor and
[1:26:18] our less presentable parts are treated
[1:26:20] with greater modesty while our more
[1:26:22] presentable parts do not require it but
[1:26:24] but God has combined the whole body
[1:26:25] giving greater honor to that part which
[1:26:27] lacks it to the part that needs
[1:26:30] it so that there be no division or
[1:26:33] Discord in the body that is lack of
[1:26:35] adaption of the parts to each other but
[1:26:37] that the parts may have the same concern
[1:26:38] for one another and if one member
[1:26:40] suffers all the parts share the
[1:26:41] suffering and if one member is honored
[1:26:43] all Rejoice with it now you collectively
[1:26:46] are Christ body and individually you are
[1:26:48] members of it each with his own special
[1:26:50] purpose and
[1:26:52] function so
[1:26:57] you see it with with the
[1:26:59] body if the smallest part of the body
[1:27:02] gets hurt the whole body is aware of it
[1:27:05] and the body starts sending it the
[1:27:07] resources and it's and whatever it needs
[1:27:10] to help fix that thing but what Paul is
[1:27:12] saying here is
[1:27:14] that the the the more comly
[1:27:17] parts don't need the greater
[1:27:20] appreciation it's the uncommonly parts
[1:27:23] those are the ones that need
[1:27:24] it and I was trying to think of the um
[1:27:27] of something in the body that's like
[1:27:29] ugly and everyone can't stand and you
[1:27:32] know other than Dad hating his
[1:27:35] gallbladder that's the only thing I can
[1:27:37] really think of but the one
[1:27:40] thing is
[1:27:43] mucus everyone hates it but it's
[1:27:47] necessary because without mucus you're
[1:27:50] defenseless cuz mucus is is is a is a
[1:27:54] substance that the body creates to
[1:27:56] lubricate the whole body it's needed in
[1:27:58] the body to catch any germs or any
[1:28:00] diseases that come in and then expels it
[1:28:03] it's a necessary part of the body but
[1:28:04] the body needs
[1:28:05] it we may not like it during the process
[1:28:10] of it but it's doing the job that it was
[1:28:12] designed to do it's an uncomely
[1:28:16] part a necessary part of the body that
[1:28:20] without it the body suffers or could die
[1:28:24] there are other things like the little
[1:28:26] finger the small insignificant little
[1:28:28] finger the little finger may not be the
[1:28:31] mightiest it might not be the thumb that
[1:28:33] can do so much with the index finger but
[1:28:36] the little finger constitutes 50% of
[1:28:38] your grip
[1:28:39] strength and in ancient
[1:28:42] Japan the way they would um punish
[1:28:45] captured Samurai was by cutting off
[1:28:49] above the first knuckle the little
[1:28:51] finger cuz without that little finger
[1:28:54] you couldn't grip a
[1:28:56] sword so that
[1:28:58] Samurai a was defense was defenseless
[1:29:01] and was then reliant on other people to
[1:29:03] protect him because the way their swords
[1:29:05] were they had to have that that little
[1:29:07] finger for the grip strength so it's
[1:29:11] little but it's mighty and without it
[1:29:15] the body is hindered okay and same thing
[1:29:19] in the body there are certain positions
[1:29:20] in the body that may seem unnecessary AR
[1:29:25] or unrecognized or whatever it may
[1:29:27] be but without certain positions the
[1:29:31] body will
[1:29:33] suffer this great quote here that I
[1:29:35] found um 64 the voice of the sign you're
[1:29:38] each one set in God economy just for its
[1:29:41] place one fasts all the all the time and
[1:29:43] communes with God while another one
[1:29:45] casts out Devils because this one is
[1:29:47] fasting but it's the whole body of
[1:29:49] Christ working together the
[1:29:52] unity so the preacher is having all this
[1:29:56] this success why oh he's this great
[1:29:58] Gifted Man and God is with him all that
[1:30:01] stuff yes for sure but it you're
[1:30:05] discounting all the other people behind
[1:30:07] that man fasting praying
[1:30:11] laboring and helping that man to get
[1:30:14] where he needs to
[1:30:15] be because you look at a pastor a pastor
[1:30:18] is nothing without his wife laboring
[1:30:21] behind the scenes helping him losing out
[1:30:24] on all the
[1:30:26] time that she deserves for the
[1:30:29] family you look at you know the prayer
[1:30:32] Warrior before the special meeting some
[1:30:36] of the greatest special meetings we ever
[1:30:37] had was because of praying
[1:30:40] people so the one person who's casting
[1:30:42] out the Devils may get all the credit
[1:30:44] but it's the guy behind the scenes
[1:30:45] fasting and praying
[1:30:48] unseen that is causing God to move in
[1:30:51] the first place
[1:30:54] and without that man fasting there's no
[1:30:57] move of
[1:30:59] God each part is
[1:31:02] critical and it it it's uh each part
[1:31:06] benefits each each other by relying on
[1:31:09] each
[1:31:11] other and what it is is that both the
[1:31:14] one who's casting out the Devils has to
[1:31:17] realize that it's only by the grace of
[1:31:18] God a that he's doing it and B is the
[1:31:20] guy praying behind him that God is
[1:31:23] answering
[1:31:27] and without that
[1:31:28] humility the body will
[1:31:31] suffer
[1:31:34] so if we go to the next one here that's
[1:31:37] it every piece in the church must work
[1:31:39] together and must keep up your part of
[1:31:41] it so we see what time we're living in
[1:31:43] we may be closer than we think we are
[1:31:45] and that's why this is especially
[1:31:46] important in this day and age because
[1:31:48] according to the vision of the Bride
[1:31:50] that brother brandham saw each bride
[1:31:52] member had to be in unison in Step
[1:31:57] together and that unity and that Harmony
[1:32:00] is
[1:32:01] essential before the Rapture because
[1:32:04] without it it's
[1:32:06] Discord and God God is not the author of
[1:32:09] confusion and that's why God is allowing
[1:32:11] the tests that's why God is allowing the
[1:32:13] trials that's why God allows issues to
[1:32:15] arise in the church to rub the bumps off
[1:32:18] each other to allow us to get into
[1:32:21] greater Harmony
[1:32:24] because if you go off by yourself the
[1:32:27] only one that suffers is you that's not
[1:32:30] true everyone suffers because you pull
[1:32:33] away because you're depriving the body
[1:32:37] of your lick of
[1:32:38] fire and your
[1:32:42] position it's no different than the body
[1:32:46] if the body if one part stops working
[1:32:49] the whole body is going to start
[1:32:50] suffering for
[1:32:51] it the body may get by with without the
[1:32:54] spleen for a little bit and it can get
[1:32:56] by but it's not going to be functioning
[1:32:59] as highly as it would before but as you
[1:33:01] get into the critical things it's going
[1:33:03] to start even uh worsen from
[1:33:06] there
[1:33:09] so
[1:33:10] each member of the body has to
[1:33:14] appreciate has to
[1:33:16] uphold and it has to be thankful for
[1:33:20] each and every person that it's with
[1:33:22] because without that
[1:33:24] the whole body will be start going to
[1:33:26] Discord that's why it's so important to
[1:33:28] thank people for what they do it's so
[1:33:30] important to to praise them for what
[1:33:32] they do should someone be able to to do
[1:33:35] it without it
[1:33:37] absolutely but it doesn't mean that you
[1:33:39] never give them that because you don't
[1:33:41] know what people
[1:33:43] need it's like a minister the best thing
[1:33:45] you can do for a minister is thank him
[1:33:47] thank for what he did especially like
[1:33:50] with special meetings where they're
[1:33:51] laboring for three days or three
[1:33:52] services or whatever they are
[1:33:54] spent thank them they're not going to
[1:33:59] mind
[1:34:03] okay so this kind of lines up with this
[1:34:06] next scripture here for through him we
[1:34:07] both have access by one Spirit unto the
[1:34:09] father now therefore you are no more
[1:34:11] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:34:12] citizens with the Saints in the
[1:34:13] household of God and are built upon the
[1:34:15] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:34:17] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:34:19] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:34:21] fitly framed together growth unto a Holy
[1:34:23] Temple in the Lord in whom you're also
[1:34:25] building together for a habitation of
[1:34:26] God through the
[1:34:28] spirit so we are fitly framed together
[1:34:32] just like Solomon's Temple God is
[1:34:34] working shaping honing putting people in
[1:34:36] the right positions letting people leave
[1:34:39] to go into their own position that's why
[1:34:42] we don't give people you know a hard
[1:34:44] time if they do leave because God is
[1:34:45] leading them and God is obligated to
[1:34:48] them to lead them so each person has to
[1:34:51] be in the right place for the whole body
[1:34:54] to then be a function and a
[1:34:58] force so if you are in a position that's
[1:35:03] kind of like the dungate it's an
[1:35:06] underappreciated position it's a
[1:35:08] position that's not recognized it's a
[1:35:09] position that may not get a whole lot of
[1:35:11] credit it's a position that goes unseen
[1:35:13] and unthanked for a long
[1:35:16] time you are built for that role and you
[1:35:20] need to be able to do that role
[1:35:23] in day out without anyone having to hey
[1:35:27] you need to pray
[1:35:28] today you need to be able to do that
[1:35:31] yourself and if you are in that position
[1:35:33] God requires it of you to be thankful to
[1:35:35] be in that position you got to be
[1:35:37] content whatsoever place you find
[1:35:39] yourself
[1:35:41] and if God has something greater for you
[1:35:44] praise the Lord but you got to be found
[1:35:47] serving in the position that you're in
[1:35:50] you look at David where was he he was
[1:35:52] found serving in the position
[1:35:54] before he became king he was found
[1:35:57] serving humbly quietly in his father's
[1:36:01] she
[1:36:02] fold you have to have character in each
[1:36:05] position that God places you in and to
[1:36:07] be thankful to be in that position you
[1:36:09] look at Joseph same thing he was
[1:36:10] thankful and God blessed him even when
[1:36:13] he was in prison God blessed him because
[1:36:16] he was thankful when he was part of uh
[1:36:19] paar's uh household
[1:36:23] God will not give you something that you
[1:36:25] can't
[1:36:26] handle he builds you he grows you he uh
[1:36:29] it's like an
[1:36:31] Isaiah he talks about like I will harden
[1:36:35] you to hard
[1:36:37] things God is a good trainer he's a good
[1:36:39] coach he's slowly building
[1:36:42] up you look at their businessmen you
[1:36:44] didn't start off with a full business we
[1:36:48] start off small and then it growed and
[1:36:51] it growed as you had the character and
[1:36:53] the strength they handle
[1:36:56] it okay but when you're in those
[1:37:00] positions say like Joseph in the prison
[1:37:03] what a frustrating place to be
[1:37:06] in where is the promise of God I'm stuck
[1:37:08] here what what am I doing
[1:37:11] here
[1:37:13] but part of the process of him producing
[1:37:16] life was him suffering for it and
[1:37:20] without that suffering period without
[1:37:21] that growth and character he went from a
[1:37:25] boy rejected by his
[1:37:28] Brethren and sold into
[1:37:31] slavery he has to go through that
[1:37:33] process of forgiving them through those
[1:37:37] years he has to go through the the the
[1:37:40] the the process of gaining character to
[1:37:43] be able to handle situations correctly
[1:37:45] for the time that when his the people
[1:37:48] that hurt him the most came back to him
[1:37:50] that he would treat them correctly
[1:37:54] did he test them
[1:37:58] yes but he forgave them and he went
[1:38:01] through the process and found that they
[1:38:02] were changed then he revealed himself so
[1:38:06] when if you're found in a position that
[1:38:08] you you may not appreciate or you feel
[1:38:11] that you're not used to your greatest
[1:38:13] potential God requires patience of
[1:38:17] you because if you are constantly
[1:38:20] wanting something greater God cannot
[1:38:22] give it to you
[1:38:25] because clearly you can't handle it but
[1:38:27] if you're willing to wait if you're
[1:38:29] willing to have patience in that
[1:38:31] position let God use you to the greatest
[1:38:33] potential within that
[1:38:35] position then he can start using in a
[1:38:37] greater
[1:38:38] way no matter what it is if it's the
[1:38:42] housewife praying at
[1:38:45] home i' I've said it before that it it
[1:38:48] God calls it or saying god brother
[1:38:50] brandom calls it the Fifth Gospel it's
[1:38:54] such a critical function within the body
[1:38:56] is is the mother praying for her
[1:38:59] children but at the end of day if God
[1:39:03] has chosen you for for that
[1:39:05] role you just you got to work through it
[1:39:08] you got to have patience but God sees
[1:39:11] the Unseen sacrifices he sees the the
[1:39:13] the the countless hours spent where no
[1:39:16] one sees
[1:39:17] it God see the struggles he sees the
[1:39:19] frustrations but God doesn't have any
[1:39:21] unpaid bills so you look here Hebrews 10
[1:39:24] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:39:25] which have great recompense of reward
[1:39:27] for you've need of patience that after
[1:39:28] you've done the will of God you may
[1:39:29] receive the promise for yet a little
[1:39:31] while and that and he that shall that
[1:39:34] shall come will come will not t now the
[1:39:36] just shall live by faith and if any man
[1:39:38] draw back my soul shall have no pleasure
[1:39:41] in him but we are not of them who draw
[1:39:43] back unto predition but of them that
[1:39:44] believe to the saving of the
[1:39:46] Soul so you can't draw
[1:39:49] back you can't draw back you got to
[1:39:52] continue and continue and continue and
[1:39:55] if that's the role that God has for you
[1:39:57] the rest of your life then serve
[1:39:58] Faithfully be found faithful when he
[1:40:03] returns Moses no one else could take his
[1:40:05] place no one else could do the job he
[1:40:07] was ordained to do it and brother and
[1:40:08] sister if you got to eternal life you
[1:40:09] areain to do a certain thing maybe a
[1:40:11] good housewife maybe something else but
[1:40:13] nobody can take her place God has made
[1:40:14] you a place don't try to take someone
[1:40:16] else's place that's carnal impersonation
[1:40:18] see shows there's something wrong with
[1:40:20] you be what you are just exactly don't
[1:40:22] be nothing else
[1:40:23] and it's
[1:40:24] true don't try and act outside of what
[1:40:28] God made you be who you are if you're a
[1:40:32] shouter be a shouter if you're a crier
[1:40:34] be a
[1:40:36] crier if you're neither raise your hands
[1:40:39] be what God has made you to be there's
[1:40:41] nothing worse than people
[1:40:43] copying because what what what's it do
[1:40:45] it does
[1:40:46] nothing God's not pleased with it people
[1:40:49] usually can see through
[1:40:51] it it's doing nothing so just be
[1:40:54] yourself if you're a teacher be a
[1:40:55] teacher if you're a housewife be a
[1:40:57] housewife if you're a deacon be a deacon
[1:40:59] don't try to be something
[1:41:01] else if you're a businessman be a
[1:41:03] businessman be the best businessman you
[1:41:04] can possibly
[1:41:06] be
[1:41:08] but you got to be contended in your
[1:41:12] place you can't be something else you
[1:41:14] can't be
[1:41:16] chasing something that's not yours to
[1:41:18] have God's not pleased with it it will
[1:41:21] go nowhere you'll just have scars from
[1:41:24] it so the last bit here is
[1:41:28] um talking about just a contrast and
[1:41:31] Leadership that we see in Nehemiah 3 so
[1:41:34] in verse one then Elish the high priest
[1:41:37] rose up with his Brethren the priest and
[1:41:38] they builded the Sheep gate they
[1:41:39] Sanctified it and set up the doors of it
[1:41:41] even with the Tower of Maya they
[1:41:42] Sanctified it unto the Tower of henel so
[1:41:46] Nehemiah gives the
[1:41:48] vision for the people the ministry take
[1:41:50] a hold of and they lead they're the
[1:41:52] first ones and they lead by
[1:41:57] example Ministry leads the way and the
[1:42:00] people follow but we have a contrast
[1:42:03] here so in verse five and next onto them
[1:42:06] the dees repair but their nobles put not
[1:42:09] their nexts to the work of their
[1:42:10] lord and The Deco were just a a city
[1:42:14] outside of
[1:42:15] Jerusalem and the Nobles refused to be a
[1:42:18] part of the
[1:42:19] work but nowhere do you see Nehemiah
[1:42:23] going up there and rebuking them
[1:42:24] dragging them back to the post to do the
[1:42:26] job he doesn't do it because the
[1:42:30] principal St still is true it's whoever
[1:42:33] is of a willing
[1:42:35] heart so what
[1:42:37] happens the de coites despite their
[1:42:40] nobles not doing it the decoit they
[1:42:42] continue to work doesn't matter about
[1:42:44] the Nobles we're still going to do it
[1:42:47] and they take care of their part and not
[1:42:48] only do they take care of their part
[1:42:50] they go above and beyond if you go to
[1:42:53] verse 27 after them the Toco repar
[1:42:55] another piece over against the great
[1:42:57] tower that lith out even until the wall
[1:42:58] of oel so despite leadership in their
[1:43:03] life
[1:43:03] failing they finished the job that they
[1:43:06] were ordained to do and they did another
[1:43:07] piece they went the Second
[1:43:10] Mile and what does that
[1:43:13] say it says that even with ineffective
[1:43:16] leadership in your life you can still be
[1:43:18] a blessing above and beyond what you can
[1:43:20] think or imagine you look at a church if
[1:43:22] a Pastor is not what he should be the
[1:43:24] people can still run the people can
[1:43:27] still be a blessing the church can still
[1:43:29] be a blessing above and beyond a family
[1:43:32] despite the mom or the dad not being
[1:43:34] where they need to be can still be a
[1:43:35] blessing the children can still be an
[1:43:37] effect is it harder yes 100% is harder
[1:43:42] way
[1:43:44] harder but just because someone above
[1:43:48] you
[1:43:48] fails doesn't mean that you fail
[1:43:54] and what it what what it is is that God
[1:43:57] all God knows what you can
[1:43:59] handle and I've seen it that when people
[1:44:01] go through those situations where
[1:44:03] they're left on their own to deal with
[1:44:04] it at a time where they should never
[1:44:06] have to deal with it it makes them
[1:44:08] strong makes them very
[1:44:11] strong and you see you
[1:44:14] know you see you know uh with certain
[1:44:16] churches we like if the ministry is not
[1:44:19] where it should be and the people don't
[1:44:22] care
[1:44:23] and they still push forward it creates
[1:44:25] strong Christians very strong Christians
[1:44:29] grounded Christians Christians who know
[1:44:31] how to talk to their
[1:44:35] God
[1:44:38] because there is a desperation that
[1:44:41] comes when God takes away something
[1:44:44] critical from
[1:44:46] you and what it is is that God is
[1:44:48] calling someone up higher that despite
[1:44:51] the circumstance that you're in you can
[1:44:53] grow despite missing something critical
[1:44:56] and here the too is are an example of
[1:44:58] that you can go above and beyond despite
[1:45:02] missing critical people in your
[1:45:06] life you have no
[1:45:10] excuse because true Holy Ghost
[1:45:14] leadership you see here in in verse
[1:45:18] 5 they thought they were above it they
[1:45:21] put not their nexts to the work we're
[1:45:23] Nobles we shouldn't have to do it but
[1:45:26] you see the high priest do it you see
[1:45:28] the other rulers and nobility do it
[1:45:30] because the basis of Holy Ghost
[1:45:32] leadership is humility it has to be
[1:45:35] humility be before you can lead you got
[1:45:39] to learn how to follow because you look
[1:45:41] at the example is Christ he you see here
[1:45:45] but he made himself a no reputation and
[1:45:46] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:45:47] was made in the likeness of man and
[1:45:49] being found in fashion of man he humbled
[1:45:51] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:45:54] even the death of the Cross wherefore
[1:45:56] God also hath highly exalted him and
[1:45:57] given him name which is above every
[1:45:59] name so that has to be it has to be this
[1:46:03] the basis of Holy Ghost leadership is
[1:46:04] humility having a servant's
[1:46:07] heart and laying aside your
[1:46:11] ego CU you didn't bring anything to the
[1:46:13] table when God called you it's only by
[1:46:16] grace that you are where you are and
[1:46:19] anything you accomplish is only because
[1:46:21] of God's grace to you and and at a
[1:46:23] moment's notice God can take it from you
[1:46:26] when you were little in your own
[1:46:29] eyes that's what Samuel said to Saul
[1:46:32] when Samuel took away the kingdom when
[1:46:35] you are little in your own eyes that's
[1:46:36] when you were at your at your most and
[1:46:40] that's why you have to be so careful
[1:46:42] with success because if you let the
[1:46:45] success go to your head and you take
[1:46:47] credit for
[1:46:48] it you're bound for a
[1:46:51] fall that's why you always got to keep
[1:46:53] yourself grounded always just
[1:46:57] recognizing the
[1:46:59] how how much grace God has given
[1:47:03] us because without it you'll become
[1:47:05] exalted in your heart and proba Goth
[1:47:08] before a
[1:47:11] fall all
[1:47:14] right if the musicians want to come we
[1:47:17] can close
[1:47:18] out so in Romans 12 for I say through
[1:47:21] the grace given unto me to every man
[1:47:23] that is among you not to think of
[1:47:24] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:47:26] think but to think soberly according as
[1:47:28] God hath dealt to every man The Measure
[1:47:30] of Faith for as we have many members in
[1:47:32] one body and all members have not the
[1:47:34] same office so we being many are one
[1:47:36] body in Christ and every one members one
[1:47:38] of another having then gifts differing
[1:47:40] according to the grace that is given to
[1:47:41] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:47:43] according to the proportion of Faith or
[1:47:45] Ministry let us wait on our ministering
[1:47:48] or he that teacheth on teaching or he
[1:47:50] that exhorteth on exhortation he that
[1:47:52] giveth let him do it with Simplicity he
[1:47:55] that ruleth with diligence he that
[1:47:56] showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love
[1:47:59] be without dissimilation or
[1:48:01] hypocrisy upore that which is good or
[1:48:04] upore that which is evil cleave to that
[1:48:06] which is good be conly affection one to
[1:48:07] another with Brotherly Love in honor
[1:48:09] preferring one another not slothful in
[1:48:11] business fervent in spirit serving the
[1:48:14] lord rejoicing in Hope patient in
[1:48:16] Tribulation contining instant in prayer
[1:48:18] Distributing to the ne to the necessity
[1:48:20] of saints given in hospitality bless
[1:48:23] them which persecute you bless and curse
[1:48:25] not rejoice with them that do rejoice
[1:48:27] and weep with them that weep be of the
[1:48:29] same mind one toward another mind not
[1:48:32] high things but condescend to Men of low
[1:48:34] estate be not wise in your own conceits
[1:48:36] and the Amplified the last verse there
[1:48:38] says live in harmony with one another do
[1:48:40] not be hotty conceited self-important
[1:48:42] exclusive but associate with humble
[1:48:44] people those with a realistic self viw
[1:48:46] do not overestimate yourself so if you
[1:48:49] want to
[1:48:50] stand we close out here with uh this
[1:48:52] quot so we want to keep it running
[1:48:54] smoothly sweetly and in order of the
[1:48:56] Lord so just remember that your part may
[1:48:58] be the mainspring or it may be the
[1:49:00] little some little hand or some little
[1:49:01] part or the winding stem whatever it may
[1:49:03] be or it may be the hands on the face of
[1:49:05] the cloth that tells the time whatever
[1:49:06] it is it takes all us all working
[1:49:10] together in harmony with the Gospel of
[1:49:11] Jesus Christ to bring this to
[1:49:14] pass so at the end of the day it it's
[1:49:17] it's not
[1:49:18] about what you think you are it's about
[1:49:22] what God thinks you
[1:49:24] are
[1:49:25] and we got to be careful that we don't
[1:49:29] limit the effectiveness of our
[1:49:32] life by putting ourselves in a lower
[1:49:34] position than what we actually
[1:49:36] are because if we're going to be a a a
[1:49:39] Victorious
[1:49:41] people you know going into the Rapture
[1:49:44] every part of our life has to be in line
[1:49:46] and in order we got to be fitly framed
[1:49:49] in the in the body of Christ we have to
[1:49:53] be serving to the best of our ability no
[1:49:56] matter what every day and without that
[1:49:59] you know it's just God is going to have
[1:50:03] to discipline you he's going to have to
[1:50:05] whip you into shape to get where you
[1:50:07] need to
[1:50:08] be so the whole point of this here
[1:50:11] tonight is
[1:50:12] that it's an equal playing field
[1:50:15] everyone's the same in God's sight it's
[1:50:17] us who arrange ourselves into this guy's
[1:50:20] big I'm little this person's very little
[1:50:23] I'm big it's only us that do that not
[1:50:26] God and every one of us has a purpose
[1:50:30] and God is waiting to release that
[1:50:32] purpose to the body to the blessing of
[1:50:34] the body all right let's pray dear Jesus
[1:50:38] we just thank you for this day we just
[1:50:40] thankful father for everything you've
[1:50:42] done for us we thank you for your your
[1:50:44] anointing father and for your word it's
[1:50:47] just without it Lord we be
[1:50:49] nothing and we're just praying Lord may
[1:50:51] you just help us to learn learn from
[1:50:53] what was spoken tonight help me to learn
[1:50:55] Lord help us all Lord just to grow a
[1:50:58] little bit more each day to grow a
[1:51:00] little stronger father and to overcome
[1:51:03] everything in our life that is holding
[1:51:04] us back so we love you appreciate you we
[1:51:07] just commit the service into your hands
[1:51:08] in name of Jesus Christ amen uh let's
[1:51:10] sing I Love You Lord with all my
