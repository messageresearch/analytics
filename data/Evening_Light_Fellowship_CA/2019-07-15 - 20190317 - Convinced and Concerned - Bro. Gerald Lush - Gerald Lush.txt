other we're not in here on our own right we're here as a body right and we ignite each other we support each other we lift each other up and one of the spirit moves then let it ignite all of us like God have control this morning amen don't let the devil take divorce up from the church that was heard that said you do that you remove God from the church amen let's sing it's 3:18 up there praise the Lord it's there show me showers of blessing even let's just sing that this morning so we continue to worship there shall be showers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a man praise the name of the Lord if there's any showers of blessing we need it's the showers and the blessings of the revealed word amen is what God nomally God has done but is what God is doing showing that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen he was there to bless them he's there to bless us and if there's another generation he's there to bless them but I turn to this we've gotta have our hearts open to the revealed Word amen to recognize what he's doing amen there are many L unfortunately many worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God that's the truth because he is is the god of this world a man to God be the glory I trust you're worshiping Jesus I trust you're worshiping the true revelation a man not a man-made revelation but what God has given us by the Holy Ghost amen what has been what has been promised for this day and for this hour amen not what he did even 50 years ago what's he doing now in your life and in my life by the grace of Almighty God so God help us to have our hearts open the Bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so we've got to be we got to be sensitive to the going forth of the words amen now not lot of what went forth what's going for praise the name of the Lord amen there's too many too many just going on what what the word that went for when four went for well the prophet of God said keep digging deeper Eason and more will be revealed hey man so brother that means we got to keep on going keep on going keep on going amen oh I believe what my what what they believe fifty years ago that's good but what about today any man now we believe what God is doing today amen we want to maybe touch on some of those things this morning as we go into the word and it's the messages of the prophet of God preached 1962 convinced then concerned a man I wonder I've many are really concerned over what God not what God has done but concern over what God is doing a million and where God is requiring of us in this day in this hour so I pray the grace of God be with us as we get into the Word of God amen get into the written word and into the revealed word concerning what God is doing and what God is expecting of you and me but God is requiring of you and me in this day in this hour is late and I'll say it again it is later than we think a man so the grace of God be with us amen and we certainly welcome our brother Eugene young and sister Mellie amen it's a good the last time we saw them was when brother car was here and and we went down and visited with them and oh yes and we had we had a lunch natural lunch and we and we trusted that maybe they'll be here for the natural lunch today at brother Mark's after the service praise the Lord that's good so we certainly welcome our brother and sister amen and it was for many years now what we've had we've known each other concern around the Word of God so I pray that we're going to be there in the resurrection and rapture amen that our faith is going to come together claiming the promise of the Resurrection and the rapture but god help us as I said we're getting to this message right here are we convinced absolutely in our souls by the Holy Ghost Irie convinced concerning the revelation of the Resurrection and the revelation of the rapture amen because the because the prophet of gazeta you're convinced you'll be concerned but it says the problem is he said there's not many convinced of the message amen but God help us brother there is a bright a man so we pray the grace of God with our sister Leah and Genevieve in Alberta today and I believe as a youth convention there are youth going on so god bless them amen and there again praying the grace of God to the to the bride around the world amen god help us brothers sister because it the time for the bride on the earth is getting shorter than anyone else a man the bride in a moment the train livin is gonna be caught up in a moment in the twinkling of an eye she's gonna be cut she's gonna be changed by the grace of God and I trust we but we're convinced that we're in the process of it now a man that is going on right now and brother and if we are convinced of it we will be concerned a man by of the truth of God a man so also to remember that our brother Mark will be ministering Lord willing on Wednesday Wednesday evening a man's will be in prayer for the Ministry of the word we think our brother Alec for the word that he brought forth on Wednesday a man has a change of a change of the body amen brother that's what's going on he ministered on it and we've been ministering around for quite a while now the change of the body a man so brother we've changed from religion to the to the Holy Ghost revival brother we changed from the law to seeing and Pentecostal revolver to the bride revival but now brothers issue is bringing on a greater change a man from time to eternity I pray God we believe it I play Iran true I pray God we truly sincerely honestly in our hearts believe it amen not acknowledging in our heads but in our hearts listen we'll hear what the Prophet has got to say challenging our faith challenging whether or not we believe challenging whether or not we are convinced because what he was seeing was the lack of concern a man there was concerned good to go to church a concern for this a concern for that but what about a concern for the resurrection and the rapture amen the wondrous a he said there he said the dead in Christ are waiting on us and God is waiting on us for the rapture why Jase it's the manifest our concern a man and again I keep referring to it brother because that's the perfect tight in the Bible as it was with Joshua and Caleb they were concerned about God not just coming out by going in but the vast majority of the Jews they were concerned about going in you know once once once they just in their minds considered what it was like and and how big the cities were now how big the the soldiers were and so on they don't know no no they weren't going to trust God a match so they weren't fully convinced as Joshua and Caleb was and they wanted to go in amen they had the promise and Cain and Caleb challenged them he said they've gotta be with us who can be against us amen so the same thing with what we're believing for the resurrection and the rapture brother of Gavi with us who can be against us let's believe God not the devil a man by the grace of God amen so the Lord blesses this dancing only believe as we go to the word and God's grace to all the saints and again our brother Paul and sister Kevin I think we'll be moving not too far in the future to another apartment so god bless them amen and keep again keep us in prayer myself sister Betty and also thank those who have called our sister and wished her a happy birthday and and she got grease today from from sister Isabel stockless in Ontario so god god bless them amen so let's say only believe all things are possible only believe but I already believe just believe in our hearts let's believe it in our souls not our heads again let's let it let our faith go beyond the devil's faith a man brother to claim the promise of God God Elvis that we're going to be focusing more on the on the spiritual and less on the natural amen only Billy Oh [Music] oh Jesus it's here [Music] man hey man [Music] [Music] [Music] the power to go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] every father it's a challenge to our faith to pray and to trust you a man to pray and the goal fourth Lord showing that we trust you Father to go forward with the life we live reflecting the absolute faith that we have Lord in the word the absolute faith we have in it is written and thus say of the Lord than we trust god help us or that we're going to trust you lord as abel trusted you we're gonna trust you lord as he not trusted you we're gonna believe you Lord even as no one believed you're all God that we're going to walk with God as they walk with God amen elbows the trust you and believe you Lord as the Saints down through the ages have

power of the anointing of the Holy Ghost oh god I pray grace in this our Lord we were seen so little we're hearing so little Lord but I pray grace we're not going to forget what you have done Lord I believe that you are still with us and you are still innocent and you are still bringing your word to pass father that you did fulfill the Scriptures you did send your server the prophet nor you did discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and you did heal the sick and you raised the dead and lord I pray grace or that is giving us the faith that pleases God that it has given us the faith Lord to believe in the resurrection it has given us the faith to believe for the change of our bodies father we are looking for their change we're hungry we're thirsting for the change Amen because we want to get out of this old world we want to get out of this old dimension we want to get out of a lord for all of this cm and unbelief all the works of the devil father hallelujah hallelujah we want to come into the place of God that the peace of God the rest of God the love of God hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom of God hallelujah they sit with you in your throne praise the name of the Lord Alleluia Lord that it is not a dream is not a fairytale but it's a reality father that oh my gracious Lord as you're serving us declare that our that whatever fate is reveals with our faith declares is more real than what our sight see and what our senses declare I pray O God that this very room is more real than the natural a man and that we are focusing on the spiritual we are focusing on what you have done and what you are doing Amen father that the same anointing is with us that same anointing is on us that same anointing Lord is pulling us into eternity so the grace of God to let go and let you have your way nor not my will father Thames be done praise the name of the Lord that we're not living for this world we're living for the world to come we're not living Oh God a father just were rest remain and what maid is doing but for God and what God is we were living for one another as the sons and daughters of God so lord I pray grace that you'll be with us Lord this morning and

grace of Almighty God we're going to see what we have never seen before father hallelujah I pray Lord it'll be a challenge to our faith father there will be a confirmation of that we really really believe and we are convinced and we are concerned anyway and we're concerned concerning what you are doing a man we wanted to be a part of it Lord and we want to be ready we want to be instant in season out of season ready for you to use us amen amen amen so grace that we have that anointing lore that our Joshua Caleb had farther hallelujah God be for us who can be against us where do we want

you want to give us counsel us with your words the written word Lord the revealed word grace grace forgive us of our sin forgive us of our unbelief forgive us of our doubt oh yes Jesus so that there be no doubt whatsoever by faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen let's see now I believe [Music] oh yeah so that it controls your life [Music] Hey [Music] amen praise the name of the Lord God bless yes before I let you be seated turn with me to the book of Romans chapter 4 a man the book of Romans chapter 4 amen and we want us to talk a little this morning and share some Scripture and quotes concerning whether or not we are convinced on what God is doing amen now what God has done sure is written in the word history proves it but one of it what God is doing to do the to believe that we have we had to become one with God one with his word one with one with one another one with what what he's doing a man and in Romans chapter four I'm beginning to read at verse 13 and he said for the promise that he would be the hair of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith obeying the righteousness of faith the righteousness of faith produces in your life and in my life God Elvis for if they which are of the law be heirs of faith or if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void it's not the past it's the present and the promise made of none effect because the law workers wrath for where no law is there is no transgression amen therefore thank God he brought us out from it under the law and into the righteousness of Christ this is amazing that God has imputed to us the righteousness of Jesus and not only that it's absolutely amazing we are brother we ought to be thankful and grateful that God has taken our sea and Buddha in the sea of forgetfulness a minute God doesn't remember it we're even written the devil remembers that others remember it but God doesn't remember Amen praise the Lord you talk about faith in Jesus we ought to believe Jesus Amen we ought to be given the glory to Jesus any man is our righteousness he is our our salvation therefore he said it is of faith that it might be by grace because divine love projected Grace and Grace has projected the faith that pleases God and he said to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all amen as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were hear the word and it says that caller those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope and again it's the hope with expectation of fulfillment and it says that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead so we consider not the aging process in the body that we're living in amen we consider eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ so as he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief God Elba's not the stager at the promise of the Resurrection and the but was strong in faith giving glory to God amen hallelujah and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able also to perform amen and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness amen where is your righteousness where is my righteousness abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness and if we believe what God has done and what God has revealed which computer to us for righteousness Amen god bless His Word you may be seated our righteousness reaches to the extent of our faith in believing what God is doing a man so just before we get more into the scripture and other scriptures there's a couple of quotes here that well one days that our brother Karsan sent me from Ontario and another one was a brother I not sure who the brother is or where he is but it was it was a quote concerning how big is God and it's amazing there's revelation there but in the in the message quote from our brother Karsan it says have you given everything yet are you fully persuaded and convinced to the extent that you have given everything to the Lord is now you the lives this Christ lives in you a man and it's God that blesses you and the prophet of God said the Bride of Christ has been given invaluable promises from the word that we can be partakers of the divine nature of Christ through the Holy Spirit amen as it was imputed to Abraham soon its righteousness is impure to us a mayor so I pray God that we have the way of the revelation of righteousness that God has that we're going to believe that we have that righteousness amen we're going to respect God we're going to honor God from what he has done and what he is doing and this is tremendous brother amen thank God God has said sometimes chosen the worst out there in the world in the eyes of the world they're the worst in the eyes of may and by they're the best in the eyes of God a man is just like just like that woman that came in and watched Jesus feet and here was the the Pharisee they are te was so self-righteous and they criticized Jesus because he was allowing this woman this dishonored this he was allowing her to Washington wash his feet amen - and she wiped them with the hairs of her head and she anointed them with oil and so on it's just absolutely amazing brother sister let's not condemn God for blessing this brother blessing that sitteth sister or we think oh they're they're they're they're not Christians they're not believers well we better look at them through the eyes of God amen there's not a true our eyes is not what we think is not what we see is what God thinks what God sees a man a man so God is looking at their faith and he when they talked to that woman at the well and he loved this woman in in the house there to wash his feet with her tears wipe them with her hair knowing with the oil that she had bought and again Oh surely surely that he wouldn't allow her to do that considering the money that she used the by that night Judas his motive was wrong always that should be sold and the money given to the poor well when if we consider where that money come from there's a lot we feel all we no no no we would have nothing to do with that money a man because maybe she got paid for something she did a man that was contrary to the Word of God and contrary to the law a man but Jesus wasn't looking at her at her natural works he wasn't looking at her natural body he was looking at her faith a man there she believed more than the scribes and the Pharisees she believed more than those that that were so religious like the rich man said he said Jesus said you know he said do do this and do that he said I have kept those Commandments he said all my life a man but yet a man he wouldn't do what God wanted him to do hey man oh there we can be so good a man but yet in the eyes of God so unrighteous that is the absolute truth a man in our own eyes we think we're right sirs in our own eyes we might think we're a Christian in our own eyes we think we're believers but in the eyes of God we might be Devils in the eyes of God we may God would look down say well there are not believers oh they think they are because the devil has lied to them amen Ramirez say Satan believes the message Satan is going to give you the truth Satan is going to give you the message 99% or you give you a hundred and one percent amen whole you believe the message and buddy but the devil had a word or a takeaway a word a man and brother that's what's going on around the world right now concerning the message I'm not interested in what's going on over there I'm concerned about going on around the message because what God is doing the brother the faith we need is in what God is doing in the revelation of the word for this day and for this hour but there's many that are that are listening to the devil and they're heady they're heading to the word they're taking away from the word but we got to leave it the way that God may give it to us amen and we got to believe it but what God told us through is serving the Prophet amen and it's in the word and again I am email I got to keep repeating it and because as John said you're forgetful there's and again and I and I saw our brother do it our brother Billy Paul it was on a film some years ago and when he took a smoking wordbook now they should we just don't take this no no no he's got to take this and he said I put it in here a main because he says it brings you back to the word amen and I said a van bro brother that's that that is the absolute truth what God has done and what God has revealed brother is to bring us back here because one faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word oh but this is the word yes exactly but it's the revelation of what God has already recorded it's the revelation what God has already say and what God has already put in his book Amen praise the name of the Lord so it's not going to take us out it's going to put us in any man so that we're going to become one with the word praise the name of the Lord amen play all right because that's the gain any in the book of John chapter 14 amen and I and I again I acquitted a number of times but again to highlight though what the prophet of God said concerning that scripture and it wasn't then but it is listen to this day and in this hour and he said jesus said I will play the father he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and he went on down he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a man hallelujah he's gonna company is going to enter into a oneness with the body enter into a oneness with his bride praise the name of the Lord and he said and he said and that day he said you'll know that I'm in the father the father in me and I in you amen nursery and brother Brown sir that's this day a man because his God revealed himself evening they in the brain and to the bride all the way down through little by little by little by little until it's the fullness of the Godhead bodily a man is revealed in a prophetic ministry a sort of man revealing the sort of man remember he's come we're not looking for Jesus to come he has come so are we convinced that he is here are we convinced that he has come for the bride that he has descended from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God a man he has come down to what was the next thing because then we have the evidence of it in the pillar of fire we have the evidence of it in the cloud of angels a man because there looking down at us hey man sir brother way what is what is it what did he do all this for to get us back into the word to give us the faith with a resurrection and the rapture brother that's a that's that's the next thing on the agenda it is the resurrection and the rapture and again don't forget when I found the province in it but again our brother our brother Andre he also highlighted it that we are not in the bride age we're not rather in the load of seen age were in the right age a man and in the brightest is the fee for the resurrection and the rapture it is now the faith that he was giving Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals and all the others it's there and we got it sure we got it but the emphasis for us now is on the resurrection and the rapture and brothers or anything we got to be convinced enough if we got to be convinced that what God has done and what God is doing a man not just that God has sent a prophet and God has over the seven seals but is God accomplished he need you and in me what he did it for amen there was a reason why God did this there was a reason why God did that there is a reason why God opened the seven seals and we've we've already been through it may I don't know have any messages 20-odd message maybe then we have preached on the resurrection and their answer and the power of God so we got to come to perfect faith and he did he did I like the fact that that the old me of the word is to bring us to that perfect faith with a rapture Amen praise the name of the Lord 99 not to say oh yeah I now I understand this doctrine I understand that doctor I understand that doctrine that's good amen but do we have faith for the resurrection of rapture a man God has revealed these mysteries but all of it is to give us give us the faith that pleases God and what is the faith that pleases God God has given us this revelation that revelation of that one that one that one oh brother all of it together is to give us the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture it a brother way it's already been revealed to us that he has come a man because the Lord descended from heaven with a shout Amen 1st Thessalonians 4 revelation 10 a man John saw that my teenager with the rainbow over his head and so on so that was Christ whether that's what he cried the Bible says he comes as a thief in the night but brother I turn it is we are not a children of the night we are children of the day amen we're going to recognize his coming amen and why yes come we're going to believe it we're gonna believe that what he come to do and they unite the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly bride amen what for and now and now it's good he's going to take us on a may in the resurrection in the rapture for the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of Almighty God hallelujah so brother to the world all by the father brings that out in being convinced and concerned and all the messes he said listen he said Jesus came and he was in flesh and he did this and he did that and he preached the word and he said they never recognized him and they call him a devil a man they said you did this they cast it out you know Devils with the body by the power of the devil and it's eating the six for the power of the devil no no no no they were they didn't recognize him and he was in flesh there and he did this he had this sign here that's saying any man by the time by the power of God in the influence in our Lord Jesus Christ and they never recognized him and he has come down into son and the prophet of God said he is made fresh in the brain issue the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the brain a man in the fullness of the Godhead body was in the bridegroom the Alpha ministry now he's in the bride the Omega ministry any man brother he what did he do back there he any ministry was crowned how yeah he died no yeah that's right that's good and he said not my real father don't be there but that's good buddy buddy he died that's good but brother we still be sinners if he didn't come back anybody he they down his life and he picks it up what for so they could now he could share were you and me now he could comment put that righteousness in you and in me any man in those they believed by the grace of Almighty God hallelujah brother than he's here right now how do you love you and God looks down at angles God see he's seeing Christ the revelation of Christ they attributes of Christ in you in the bride and the bride is convinced a man that he has come that he has descended from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God amen that's right brother sister and he had a messenger here a TA the ministry of Malachi for here midnight and the Ministry of Malachi for Russell a West River stood through which he would reveal himself because the part of the God says this is not me he said I can't do this when he was couldn't discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and he would do this and do they said that's not me he said I came to that he said I I he was just a human being he was a sinner saved by grace anybody but as a ministry that God was getting him out of the way and God would use that in that ministry amen that's why the world was shocked that God used Windham Branham because he knew he wasn't educated my brother God don't their God don't want our education no no god I understood that God not impressed by all we know this we know this we know that a man when we got this we got this we got that he's not interested in that he's interested in our faith what we believe in our hearts by the grace of God and he said brother sis listen he said listen did something wrong they don't believe he has come they don't believe he's coming he said when you're going to good and you got you're working on this you're working on that you want to do this you want to do that and if you're gonna build a big building season no he said we don't need it he said he has come and it's God in simplicity that's why yes we said you pastors those in love small churches he said don't you worry says what God is going to use he said God is in the small the small groups not the big groups amen and you got believers say they want to be a part of the big church amen God's not part of the big church all due respect brother I tell you they said that you're gonna find maybe one here one there and missing out of a big church and so on like III preached the years ago in Oh mine in in Virginia and I said brother even after the bride's gone I said the believers are still gonna be getting together in worship they'll still get together in a church and I said yeah I said there's going to be maybe a few churches the minister won't show up but I serve for the most part I said a ministry be there too and it's going to be preaching the message but I said it'd all be too late anyway on the one day something will happen and then they'll ask the question where's the rapture oh it already happened you didn't know it any man brother they've got they've got his doing anything in this message this hour this age and through the Ministry of Malachi for God is revealing his coming and the resurrection and the rapture to the brain a man so she's not going to be there to hear that revelation oh it's already Holborn you didn't know it no no yeah we're part of it amen god is revealing it in us God is bringing it to pass in on us by the grace of God hallelujah brother we're getting ready to get out of here we're getting ready to go home to be with the Lord we're getting ready to get into the kingdom of God hey man listen again as I said we had the same attitude that Jesus said in the Alpha ministry we'll have in the Omega ministry how much longer are we going to stay here longer will I be with you amen brother okay can you as a Christian as a believer you know better put up with all the foolishness going on over there amen brother the way people are dressing and the way people are acting and what they're doing you know there's nothing hidden anymore I'll tell you what it is it proves there is they're insane it proves the insanity of the world the Prophet said the world was insane and I know it's insane because I've seen it you're seen it you know when it comes to you going to a mall over there well Cragen's get into a play for Christians to stay away from it yeah there's no way from malls and stay away from this they went ahead any man because of all that you're seeing all that's going on brother sister again as I told you something I saw when I went into a mall the other day and for some reason and then I saw what's that I said must be a boy and girl I'm up a young man young woman and they were coming this way and they're heading to her to do the escalator and and I and I I do the escalator too but they went out first and what is it you saw they were whole names why yeah I got when I when I realized that's it oh that's just two young men and then here they were they were walking around and they they were whole names I said what's wrong with them and they went on and on and on somebody else was talking to him that knew him and they and they never never dropped their hands they still kept their hands hold means just like she was like sometimes that a boy and a girl would go go down the aisle or go somewhere and they're holding aids I said Lord I said oh we reached it it's over with a man it's insane but there we go when it comes from our family friends and neighbors we got to plead the token life of the blood of Jesus for him and we got to commit up to the trust God amen be fully convinced of the our were living anyway don't let the devil cause you to do and say no no no we do you you're gonna ask God to wait till your son comes in as God to wait till your daughter comes as it comes by as a believer now you leave it with God to sing God's time see Jesus said how long shall I be with you how am I gonna be here - finally he got the revelation Amen praise the name of the Lord he saw this he saw that a man he was seeing that he was seeing things as well in that day and he began to strike him oh now it's come oh my the end has come the end of his ministry as the out of a ministry a man and he headed toward Jerusalem and they said they said to the fair those the disciples how come we won't talk to us Jesus won't do this he wondered that oh he's he's faces toward Jerusalem and brothers the same with the bride our face is set toward the New Jerusalem hallelujah praise the Lord Oh God is to have the faith brother this will make a ministry that he had in the Alpha ministry the faith who you are and Jesus knew who he was why he was here where he was going and how he's going to get there and that's why he wept and he cried well we don't know we don't have to even cry we can praise the Lord any man praise the name of the Lord because again the scripture amen is fulfilled the Lord has descended from heaven with a shout Amen the voice of the archangel and the trumpet amen the dead in Christ shall rise a man oh brother this is tremendous again and one scripture after another we just can't get away from her brother I pray God we're not going to ignore it and he said because a nice I showed you a mystery was the mystery be revealed and he said we shall not all sleep a man but we shall all be changed anything yeah I don't know is whether driven asleep before the before the change in their answer maybe not oh brother here 70 years old so what Abraham was a hundred Sarah was 99 hey man God let it go out at all amen amen it was a challenge to their faith but abraham believed god and anybody and what was before wasn't for God knew but it was so very was to teach you and me a man it was an example for you and me because we claim to be the seed of Abraham spiritually a man save regardless of his age he went on and went on and on and he's to believe that all Sarah's gonna have a child Sarah's gonna have a show on how she was doubting right cuz she was in the tent behind him laughing and so on but abraham believed god praise the Lord any man but you're talking but even he received him as one from the dead and burn when God told him in every way Wendy I think was just just a young boy God said I want you to take him over to the mountain and sacrifice him to me he received them at 108 not God wanted him to kill him they go out there sacrificing and showing the food showing you Abraham's faith in the resurrection he said I received them as one from the dead and he said God is able to raise it back up again please let me have old brother if we're the seed of Abraham what a revelation are we to be concentrating on what revelation y'all be to be focusing on it's not the over there there's preachers out there teaching this putting the emphasis on this the emphasis on that oh and we believe you are in the end there be a resurrection in the end of it there be a rapture well brother we're at the end of it a man what God really wanted to reveal he's revealed what God wanted to say he's saying amen but for because so we would hear the word and get the faith that pleased with him what is the baby that pleases God resurrection rapture amen Jesus saw hey is our coming any man and he whipped and he cried because he knew what he had to do with a bride ought to be praising God and what Lord I'm what we're on our way Lord Rael nor do we sense there that revelation of the resurrection of the rapture it's in us Lord amen amen as it separated you 2,000 years ago it's separating us from the world and the things of the world now amen and and II didn't wanna be here no longer just think what he what he was seeing back there 2,000 years ago once he was what's he seeing today any man if he saw those years ago and a kinda guy got him in a under a burden that he wanted to get out of this dimension he want to get back where he come from anybody remember the prophet of God said he did not buy passage theophany and he said of Hira and because he didn't he said he remembered where he come from and he wanted to get back there hey man but he said we by Pastor a theophany and he said we forgot where we come from until we got the Holy Ghost and down by the Holy Ghost brought back our memory he put us in contact with our theophany again and now I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and now God has showed us why we're going to get there by the grace of Almighty God hey man praise the name of the Lord this is tremendous brother so he said we shall not all sleep a main guard Elvis ability either we're living in that generation it is age but if I've been looking for and looking for the grave this been looking looking for the resurrection and the rapture amen but there's still believers that are looking for the grave they are deliver the die does look to live amen brother we got the we got the fullness of the revelation even though I said it's not me that lives its Christ liveth in me amen Christ yeah who's he he said I am the resurrection and the life amen and he said he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die God give us that faith we're not gonna die oh yeah sure time goes on no I'm not when it comes to dying physically my own the only thing that bothers me is the trouble I'm going to be to those they're left behind yeah that's the truth oh yeah Lord no I don't want to be that trouble I said they got to do this they got to do that and you know I no no no Lord I don't want that any man brother sister well they did it to Jesus they had to get his body ready they had to put it into the in into the tomb and when we were there in 2008 there were myself sister Betty where we were in the two maybe two or three times there a man when they showed us were everywhere they laid the body and in the tomb a made the garden tomb but but again he wasn't dead oh but physically yeah there was death in that physical part but he wasn't in there he was down preaching the souls in prison a man and brother I've been having these these messages with me ever since my burnt preaching on the rapture the anointing was at the end time the indictment and souls from prison as the Lord I want I want to get that to the church as well get some thoughts on these messages amen so brother Jesus though that physical body was there a man there was a stone on anything in the front of it a man but Jesus wasn't there just think he oh they put the body there but when he when he bowed his head on the cross he went down two souls in prison a man and he set the captives free and they resurrected Winnie reservation they went into the city to appeared on the many a man and then they were raptured with a by the grace of God amen brother God elvas that we're going to be absolutely convinced and if we are convinced of what God is doing that we're gonna be concerned concerned that we're not going to miss it concerned that we're going we're going to stay with the word amen we're concerned that we're not gonna miss the resurrection how many are really concerned over that and and they're making their calling in their election sure constantly their election sure in Resurrection arrives really constantly constantly customer what do we believe what's our attitude what's our spirit when it comes to the what's going on around us rather like Jesus how long shall I be with you until finally he got the faith he had the faith I am no more in the world what no more in the world no because his faith was pulled him out to another dimension and that other dimension was getting more real to him than this one I pray grace that there that other dimensions getting more real to us than there's one any man that we got no time for this one and we'll leave this with the Lord and move on by the grace of God we know the Great Tribulation is coming we know there's going to be a millennial right then we're gonna blend into eternity but I'll tell you this the bride is going to go into eternity now with the bridegroom there's the invisible union or the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly break a man it's and it's a bride that's thoroughly absolutely convinced of what God is doing and she's concerned Amen Jesus was convinced and he was concerned and a finally after he came back he put his life in oh hallelujah he put in the service of the day of Pentecost they were convinced and they were concerned amen even to the extent that they never doubt of their lives by the grace of God and those that had met on the road to Emmaus brother first they did they did they were doing where they didn't know who you was hey man he had their eyes so that they wouldn't recognize him and after they talked and talked and talked on the word the word the word the word and they said you don't know what happened here about Jesus who was crucified they didn't know they're talking to Jesus amen and there's a world today don't know we talk to mrs. Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord hey man hallelujah a man talking to mrs. Jesus Christ don't you know this oh yeah I know yeah and brother he was going to go in the rapture after he revealed himself to his Saints there on the earth after any man after he gave them the promise to tell him what to do amen now as you go and wait till you get the anointing amen go out there and wait till you get to the anointing any man and then the anointing is we're gonna take him out hallelujah convince them and make them concerned amen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is goddess confirming that we are convinced of the truth and now he gives us the anointing what for so we're concerned for this one for that one for this one for that one that's what they were concerned with out there hallelujah and they went preaching two souls laid down their lives as Jesus laid down his and brother under finally even Luther Oh hallelujah he was hungry nor thirsty that he would be Kenichi finally God came in the anointing he was convinced that he was justified by faith where he was convinced that he was justified sanctified by faith the pedicles were cadets of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit anyway and they were concerned convinced now concerned to get it to others but now it's come down to the place where the bride aged hallelujah where he has come down the bride is convinced and she's concerned them any man that we believe in the resurrection and the rapture see when he got to Lazarus tomb and he said to Martha he he arises again oh yes I believe he'll rise again oh I believe in the resurrection I am the resurrection see not in the future in the present the resurrection up there is here any man so now brother he's asking us to believe that as a welder laser shoulders with with with the bride now in this hour because we see bring the lateness of the hour by the grace of Almighty God and he said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye god help us when at the last Trump at the last tremor well where the Lord stood the sinful woman said the voice of the argument rumbled God the last Trump it sounded and it's calling the bride and the bridegroom together praise the name of the Lord hallelujah his 999 yes with justice this doctrine that doctrine that doctrine amen oh yeah they went forth and they lived lived the life of Christ and they laid down the physical life went into there's the orphanage no there's a generation that rises brother there's not just living the life of Christ and lay down their bodies and going to a theophany no no we're going to a glorified body any man we're entering into a oneness with our Lord Jesus Christ Christ is coming made flesh in the bride amen and I'm were united there's the invisible you know the message the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother if there's an invisible yeah of the heavenly bridegroom and the Erte right then he's here he's got to be here for us to be united within any man and he's taken us from time to eternity and as the Provost said he'll go back and he'll get that body and come down and receive us unto himself because he said right now there's no life in that body by the throne thank God that the life is with us any man the life is in you and it in me and we're and it's taking us out of here amen all god help us brother so how can you how can you separate yourself from Jesus how can you not think about Jesus you know you know all circumstances and all situations he said the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen brother there's more going on than what we realized I said it's later than what we think and there's more going on what we realized the data are closer to us than what we think that's right and as he said they're waiting on us any man and he said they're going to appear to us that's what he said any one of those messages here he said the dating Christ are going to appear to us and then he said we're gonna be caught into that dimension and he said we're gonna be changed instantly and somewhere there I read somewhere where he said he can we're going to fellowship with each other and then he said we're gonna look up and there's the pillar fires go me in that class in that body called Jesus and we'll rise to meet him for the marriage supper of the lamb how many are convinced already and so concerned that they want they want to put the emphasis on the resurrection in the rapture they want to get out of here so kit boy why why because jesus said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh Savior that's how bad it's getting he didn't say no soul saved but he said there'd be no flesh saved that's how bad it's getting oh that's the great tribulation where brother there's a lap over and I pray grace God take us out of here before before before that islands brother and I see I see it coming around the message oh yeah more and more worldliness more and more foolishness and it's the influence as I've said of the tree of knowledge of good and evil that Internet oh yeah God Elvis and he said the dead in Christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed by the grace of Almighty God amen turn with me and they were finished reading what the brother gave me there turn with me to Romans chapter 8 Romans 8 and beginning to read at verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is God that justify it oh thank God please in the name of Jesus let's exercise our faith any man brother cast out the spirits of unbelief and he said it was either condemneth it is Christ that died a rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also making intercession for us then the price is paid amen and the sin has gone into sea of forgetfulness and he said who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword what's going to separate us from the love of Christ regardless of what you're going to experience and what you got to go through you're gonna love it because what we're experiencing in the flesh is just natural but the faith in the souls take us into eternity it's spiritual but just too much emphasis on the natural not enough on the spiritual that's right I don't care whether you're in school at home at work you still got to put emphasis on Jesus on the spiritual the spiritual the special they mean he's with you in school it's with you at work it's with you in your home he's with you you know and no matter where you are not just here in church he come with you and he'll go with you amen god help us grace my my God have mercy but too many are putting the answers on the next were not too spiritual so he said shall tribulation or distress separate us from the love of Christ persecution or famine nakedness or peril or sword and he says it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter and he said nay in all these things we are more than conquerors amen more than conquerors through him that loved us hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he has put his seal in you he has put his seal on us amen we are more than conquerors through him that loved us brother if he loved us so much more we gonna love him he is how much more we're gonna lay down our lives for one another for here cuz the lay down our lives for one others lay down our lives for you remember again as I preach you're going to hell not because of what you did because of what you didn't do because jesus said in as much you didn't do it to the least of these my brother you didn't do it to me he said depart from me into everlasting fire amazing absolutely amazing just go like I said go read it again he said did this did this did this did this he did it to me he said to the least and then he went on says but you didn't do this you didn't do this you didn't do that and he says you didn't do it to the least she didn't do it me he says so I said going to everlasting fire those that did it are gonna go into glory it's amazing you have a God in simplicity any man he said I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord how many have the love of God and are manifesting the love of God yeah I mean you're living the love of God as Jesus lived it yeah as I said keep your attitude right keep your spirit toward everyone because there goes you but for the grace of God I don't care if they're denominations if you're out there in the world there goes you but for the grace of God every man oh what I'm predestinated and so on and maybe they're not well that's between them and God because listen if God Bible says God's not willing that any should perish and if God's not willing that any should perish neither isn't the bride any bad no matter how bad they are what it is you're praying God have mercy on that Lord does the devil and yeah it's the lord grace grace to me lord grace to that brother grace to that man grace to that woman yeah but you get believers today there are so self-righteous as I said that criticized this they're criticized that criticized people out there in that church that church that should just Lord neither with the Lord move on plead that plead the token as I said if the power of God were to come back he wouldn't he wouldn't at all focus on denominations he be preaching against Messi's churches they meant oh yeah he would because of such a change in and and he's brought that out he was experienced it even in this day he says not like it used to be and he began to see even the older ones losing losing their experience losing the anointing there was none like it used to be sin oh yeah he brought that out even even in Brenham tabernacle god help us brother we had to be convinced they had concerned there with me I've been about an hour sorry we're see how far we get it seems like we're not gonna finish it Matthew agrees amen Oh somebody else agreed with an amen amen well brother see I said the pastor comes out well Lord I'm gonna read this I got this cursor here I'll read the scripture and then I'll go into the coach that's it you know that's that's that's our thoughts but when he takes over yeah he got other things to say any matter well to God be the glory we're gonna have don't have patience with me at patience for the Lord amen and the message on the conveyancing concern and really I've been meditating on it through the week and Lord what am I gonna minister on I said I I feel a minister on these soft these thoughts these thoughts and I don't know what it is until finally this came up convinced being concerned oh I said that's right Laurie that's right that's that's that's the that's why you've been giving me these thoughts as a saucer to focus on this so the thing of it is are you convinced if you are really convinced in your heart you'll be concerned for the resurrection for the rapture if you're really convinced in your heart you're going to be concerned to reflect to reflect Christ to others any man there'll be a witness to others by the grace of God a man and he he took his text from John chapter one concerning the next day Jesus stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked pijo he said behold the lamb of god and the two disciples toward him speak heard him speak and they followed Jesus and then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them what Sikhi and they said rabbi which being interpreted master where dwellest thou see what seeking like the power of God said I quoted I think the last message father God said they call Lord he said they're calling me to come they want to come see me in the hotel he said do they want to see me and meet me or do they want to meet Jesus most wanted to meet brother Branham amen brother is not meeting you he's meeting Jesus amen brother they got to recognize Christ in you as I said back maybe 90 70 it's a long time ago when I was working in a certain place and I was just doing this he was in the kitchen because I was a cookie and this person came in always said always I'm glad to meet you said I I I say it for the glory of God he said I know you're a Christian as you do or yes he said I know he said because he said because of your attitude because of your your your spirit and your nature he said he said I you to mean he said you're a Christian I said well I said thank you I said I said well I said to God be the glory I said it's not me it's Christ Wallace I know I know then he might have been he might have been an American soldier at the time and I said well do they recognize you as a Christian or just a religious person there's a difference they know there because I work with religious people and they were just religion this religion that religion but then there was very very few that I met that were Christian they they weren't there representing a this denomination that denomination but they were everything the Church of God amen by the grace of god oh my god elvis jesus they come and see and they came in saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour and one of the two heard John speak and followed him was Andrew simon Peters brother and his first fine he first finds his brother Simon and said unto Him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus bailed him he said thou art Simon the son of Jonah and thou shalt be called Cephas which is by interpretation of stone and then he said now he said I want to preach on two words he's a convinced concerned a man and now he said that we are now seeing a great cooling off around the nation what would he say today I pray God's grace to the the Muslims that out that were killed in New Zealand 49 some gunmen went in and shot them all now I agree with New Zealand and I understand that Australian leaders took when it comes to best before all this happened regarding the Muslims that were coming into their country and God would honor the honor the honor of the leaders for that for further stand they took and what are they - what stand they take they took their stand for Christ god help us take our stand for Christ but now they weren't there to condemn the Muslims they weren't there to condemn the Arabs they just said now listen you are welcome to come here you're welcome to live here and you can practice your faith here but please understand that as Christians that we're respecting and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that we're not going to compromise our faith for your faith and please don't expect us to compromise and if you're not pleased with that then you'll add to go back to your own country but he said if you're satisfied with Christianity and you don't mind us practicing our Christianity then then it says you can stay and practice your faith and of course they stayed and they practice their faith but at the same time they referenced and respect the Christian respect to the Christians thank God for the leaders like that would to God we have leaders like that here in Canada would they God their leaders like that in America they want to compromise god help us brother don't compromise for the man on the message know what we believe the message but we have a right spirit and right attitude but we're not going to we're gonna stay with the truth amen and he said when I first started out there was a lot of tinsel in the meetings and people were in praying prayer meetings everywhere he said papers criticize me and he's a one woman drove 3,000 miles in a taxicab just to get to the meeting in Canada 3,000 miles in a taxicab today they want her to go around the corner where's giving Jesus preeminence see the thing of it is not convinced if you're convinced you're concerned any man you're concerned for Christ is not convinced Oh William Branham was the prophet and we never Bennett was this and that was the truth that was was what but but what is by the grace of God amen he said one woman drove 3,000 miles in a taxicab just to get the means in Canada how can I manage that convinced he said they are not concerned any more and it seems like there is more become falling away and seem like there's not much concern to and as much as they should be very little concern and it is even in the night and they don't have that concern even run the message now know very few he said back then he said they just couldn't rest until they received the Holy Ghost but they're not that concern anymore the revival fires are dying down amen that's the truth there is something wrong somewhere he says still doing the same thing still the same gospel I have never changed a bit I started I just started with naked bare word of God and I stayed right on it ever since I can't take it back it's God's Word and if I say it just like it said here the next time I had to say the same thing because here is the way it's wrote but it looks like there is not enough concern because they're not convinced one time people were absolutely thoroughly completely concerned because they were convinced because I told our brother Billy Paul when we went down to visit him a couple of years ago and he was expressing appreciation for all that we've done and I said brother I'll be honest I said we lived our lives for the gospel we lived our lives for the body of Christ I said long weekends and holidays I said was an opportunity for us to fellowship with the Saints go and do this go and do that go and do something else I said that's all we live for by the grace of God how many are living for that dad today not many know how many gonna lay down their lives for Jesus as he laid down his life for them nothing yeah you lay down your life for one another you're there to help this brother help this sister help this one help that one yeah he's here administer this one minister that one praise the Lord hallelujah encourage them in the Lord that's right but today the spirit world is on the people and oh it's a long weekend where are we going where where's the nearest church Oh where's the believers Oh we'll go there amen praise the Lord that's what Jesus did and if we're convinced we will be concerned for one another any man if some of you want he's lost the love of God not many got the love of God no no so he said looks like there's not enough concern and I wonder why he said why isn't there a concern there like it used to be I believe the reason that it that if there's not much as much concern as there used to be they're not as convinced as they used to be you ready to be convinced before you can be concerned and he said you know what I believe I believe that the people is not convinced that Jesus is coming soon they're living too much for this world that's right not convinced God Elvis that's the truth they're convinced that God sent a prophet they're convinced that William Brown did this he had this sign this signed and this these wonders he could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but they're not convinced that Jesus is here they're not convinced that the brightest called out to be united with Jesus they're not convinced that we're getting ready getting ready to go to the marriage summer no no God Elvis he said I believe the beaver does not convinced that Jesus is coming soon and a lot of believers are not convinced they're not living like it they don't live like they believe Jesus is coming or Jesus has come and now we're going home by grace I don't believe they're convinced that he is coming in this age I believe that's the reason that they're not concerned because they're not fully convinced that's right they're not convinced that he's with them and if they were they would come back to the word and this was 1962 and this was a few months before the opening of the seals and what the Lord descending from heaven with a shout in the cloud of angels this was June and in February he came down in the cloud of angels and it was 1933 that he came down in the pillar fire a man he said how many people might misunderstand it love love is discipline you must discipline the people if you love them and he's referring to the ministry he said why he says you've got to be convinced first that it is God and then you know where you're standing it's true convinced first then you get concerned although people claim that God is with them and he said but he said mother used to say actions speak louder than words certainly it does you must act it believe it be convinced and then you'll be concerned amen by the grace of God are your actions speaking the truth amen your actions there's going to be a testimony a reflection of your faith yeah and he said that's what's the matter tonight people are not couldn't listen people are not convinced of the message amazing people are not convinced about the Holy Ghost if you really get convinced then you're concerned and you'll do everything you can what you've got to do with it you'll do it well brother Bentham I'm not a preacher but still you got something to do yeah don't leave everything to the preacher no no believers back years ago oh my they were witnessing they were testifying they were gone you know Joan right spirit right attitude oh yeah reflecting Jesus Jesus they talked to Jesus morning noon and night that's right yeah and they loved the fellowship of the Saints morning noon and night listen he said one time we had a meeting just be a few moments and he said there was a farmer got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and he only had nothing but his experience and that's right all he had was his experience with the baptism of the holy ghost and a truck that's all he had but he holds so many to the meeting in his truck it says he got thirty more filled with the Holy Ghost a man he was there so for God to use yeah are you there for God to use when God wants to use you and how God wants to use you even those young people yeah I'm a sinner saved by grace I remember one time that I was walking down the road the gravel roads then he had Middlebrook it's called gamble now and there are a lot of young people that we associated with and played with now just a young man and young boy nothing boy and I was coming there's a journal come here well what's the problem what is it oh he said we want you to say this I said what no I said I'm not gonna they wanted me to swear and take the name of God in vain I said no way I said that's that's up to you as your choices as if you want to do it but I said I'm not gonna do it because that we were true that's the way we were trained as children oh yeah so wasn't that I was much of a Christian or any God but we did go to church you know Wednesdays and we went to church with young people meeting on Friday I believe and then we had then we had service on Sunday morning then we had Sunday school Sunday afternoon and we had service on the night yeah and now the the the gathering together of believers even and Christians is getting less and less and less and you know also that many many Christians are leaving churches as that lady told me in her church that she said there's nobody under 50 in our church anymore she said I used to be the - she used to be a teacher Sunday school teacher but she says no one teach anymore she says no one goes and most every denomination odors like it and now messy stretchers are getting like it I thank God for our young people here God mom and dad please keep encouraging your daughter's your sons concerning Jesus concerning the end concerning the resurrection because during the rapture concerning the judgment that's coming on the war this is not the world that we lived in 50 years ago no no it's worse as I said it changed every so many years and then I've recognized the change every ten years and every five years than every year then every few weeks now every day is changing oh god help us please in the name of Jesus whatever you got used for the glory of God see what you can do for God amen what can I do for you today Lord Lord maybe help this person help that person you know help that person are you but Jesus would ya don't be self-righteous because of the eyes of God that person again might be more righteous than we are oh yeah their attitude their spirit we're there to help one another pray for one another encourage one another not just believers but even someone out there it's like one time that my my aunt she'd gone to a denomination and she was dying and she called me on the phone and she was at the time she was living not believing in Alberto with with family and she called me on the phone and and she said Gerald she said she was on her Baudette bed in a member of the family's home and she said Joe she said that won't be much longer she said no but I'll be gone she said I'm going on going none to be with the Lord but she said Joe she said I want you to speak at my funeral it was in a denominational Church and she said just to let you know this she said take as long as you want she said I won't know nothing about it she said it won't bother me because when I had I had spoken at a at a previous funeral of a family member and I only spoke 3035 minutes and that and and there were people they were complaining oh yeah if they complain for 35 minutes how much are you gonna complain for hour and a half yeah and and just 35 minutes and they were complaining and and I even heard at one point they said how much longer is he gonna be you know because but and and my my aunt she's married to my father's brother she heard it and she said take as long as you want it won't bother me but it bothers people today yeah thank God for our brother Eugene here certainly they did travel a long ways a man it's a long distance so God God blessed them and God will he will this is not in vain this is not a formal godliness no this is this is putting God first by the grace of God and he's our this man he suggests that his experience yet an experience he was convinced and he was concerned hallelujah and he said but he also many to the meeting he got more than 50 or 30 more rather filled with the Holy Ghost he was convinced and when he was convinced he was concerned and they were and he said we're convinced that Jesus is coming soon we will be concerned about our lost our lost ones will be doing all we can to get the gospel out listen reflect Christ if you're gonna reflect anything to your family your friends and neighbors reflect Jesus a right spirit and a right attitude and in brother behind it is the love of God because as I said oh this one got faith to do this they understand this mystery this mystery what a Bible says you can understand the mysteries you can know all this you can know that but if you don't have faith he said it's all in vain you got a head if you don't have divine love rather it's all in me he's now abideth Faith Hope and divine love and the greatest of these is love it's gotta be motivated by divine love it was divine law projected grace grace projected the faith the revelation so you got to have that you got to come along but there's too many it's all intellectual but there's a few they got the Spirit of Christ and it's you you love them you want them to hear the word you want them to be saved by the grace of God God knows who they are God knows where they are be led by the spirit hallelujah see he was convinced and he used his truck for the glory of God to bring those people to the meetings amen and if we're convinced that Jesus is coming soon we'll be concerned about our lost ones and we'll be doing all we can to get the gospel out as Jacob stayed all night one night wrestling wrestling wrestling that prince and he wrestled all night and he had been dodging Esau ear and there he's scared to death of him and the early saw was coming and he put his wife across the brook and went over on the other side and knelt down and you know God come down and got a hole of Jacob and they wrestled all night and he wasn't completely convinced to start with but by the time that God got through with him he was convinced hallelujah and sometimes things happen in our lives and his God is convincing us any man of our calling God is convincing up as of his love amen and his respect for us and looking for our respect for him convinced then concerned Amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he said you might be convinced about psychology but you have to get knee ology he said I don't care about education I'm convinced that Jesus Christ is the son of God I'm convinced this is the Holy Ghost I'm convinced he's the healer I'm convinced that Easter Savior I'm convinced he's coming I'm convinced this is that he said I'm convinced he said I believe it so he said are you convinced about getting his word out to the rest of them they were convinced and that was a good sign that they were convinced because they wanted to reflect the word get it out to the elderly brothers not our religion it's Jesus it's what Jesus has done it's not just focusing on doctrine and the letter of the word for the realms and what we need is the dynamics he's too pretty too much focuses on on the on the mechanics but not the dynamics we need the dynamics of the word he said and he knew that people were just getting caught up with dr. dr. dr. doctrine but they never had the Holy Ghost amen to go and live the life of Christ oh god help us Oh God looking for us to believe this believe this yeah we believe it and if we do we're gonna be concerned about God and His Word and he's playing for our lives praises the Lord amen he said the Roman soldier the Centurion he said he was convinced if he could only get Jesus to say the word he said listen to that soldier a Roman Gentile heathen and he said I'm a man under authority I say to this one go here go there and I say to this one come and he comes why he was over him he was testifying Jesus you're all over all diseases you're over at all and if I could just ear you say the word my servant will live amen and many of us got that they speak the word only and after all of that we still don't be convinced what was that Jesus said that was great faith he didn't find that in Israel just speak the word here it is right now and he said when thou pray believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall have it if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what God said will come to pass you can have what he said what a tremendous promise thought Elvis amen I'll have to stop right there right here brother god help us the Prophet said the Spirit of God working in men makes men act like God he said no wonder jesus said is not a Tritton ye are gods and if they called him God on to whom the Spirit of God came how can you condemn them me then when I'm a son of God if you could see the Spirit of God in Moses which he was God Moses was a God Joseph was a God the prophets were gods the Bible said they were and they were God's because if they had completely surrendered themselves to the Spirit of God that they were working for the glory of God and now is to let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the lifts left side when a man is anointed of the Spirit of God is Abbot's is actions and everything is God moving in him amen and sometimes he's misjudged he said action speaks louder than words that's right no matter what we say with our lips our actions prove what really is in our heart amen whether or not we're convinced yeah we're concerned evidence were convinced I believe the hours come I disagree with these big schools of theology building today he said we are talking about the coming of the Lord right at an and building big schools and everything why he said our own actions speak louder than our words how could we be putting so much in buildings and so forth and great schools and so forth and saying the Lord is coming do we really believe it or listen to this I'll finish with this quote he said bless your heart sister he said now I am a total stranger to you he said we are years in difference in our ARH I don't know you I have never seen you and we're just two people met here on earth but you are a Christian you are a believer because the reason I know that is the feeling of your spirit he was discerning her spirit he says you're a Christian amen and he said you have welcomed me amen that's right praise the Lord there are believers that you can have fellowship with and you know that you're welcome why because of their spirit amen go to brother Eugene sister Millie's beachside Oh beachside yeah yeah and and the Spirit of God is there you're welcome we were welcomed sister sister Mellie shorter well or welcoming attitude spirit she set the table yeah don't go now got that subdued oh they could say over the restaurants up there no the restaurant was in the house no charge on the bill amen so god bless them brother I pray God give us that right spirit that right attitude the spirit if you're born again and you're a Christian amen you got the Holy Ghost and and one believer will sense it and another believer what sets it amen because they'll feel welcome in your presence and if you don't have the Holy Ghost then the believer won't feel welcome all brothers sister that's why we all love to go to brother Burgess and sister Burns's back years ago and not only that not only believers but even denominational people and if people that weren't Christian they loved to go into brother and sister Burns's house because of the atmosphere yeah and not only adults but there was children young boys and young girls that love to go in and sit down in the kitchen in brother Barnes's house sister purposes was disposed sister burns why because of the atmosphere the peace the rest of God that was there and you know that about the Pentecostal couple and sister burns prayed and it's child was delivered on the spirit the child had that spirit honor and sister Burns follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost hallelujah how are we in the spirit like she was when she was slicing bread she was getting the couple of lunch they were Pentecostals she was getting the melange slicing the bread when she heard the child swearing and she laid down the knife my Walken see sister birds now lay down the knife moved out of her Hall or pantry cross her kitchen into the hallway and the child was there she didn't wait she spoke the word how do I know you she spoke the word speak the word she said Satan she said in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you come out of the child a man that was it but back into her pantry and some time later that couple came back again and visited the brothers sister burns just let you know she said the child hasn't sworn since brother that's the grace of God amen convinced and concerned and she went and spoke the word Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed he said I just think that's the soldier had that concern for his servant it wasn't a son or a daughter a brother or sister a servant he didn't tell the servant wha I get it no I guess nobody else no he went to Jesus speak the word only I'm what a revelation well water revelation was convinced he was a Gentile he was convinced concerning who Jesus was and the authority and the power that had a man God it was rather that we are they were convinced we have that revelation where we are absolutely convinced and we're concerned Speak the word only get thee behind me Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because Satan is is on your heels every day amen god help us is my prayer amen and it says your action speaks aloud he said it drowns your voice so brother sister this makes sure that we're reflecting the word by the grace of God and he said I'm convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm convinced in the ministry and the message I'm preaching I'm convinced that it's the truth I'm convinced that these visions come from God I'm convinced that we are living in the last days I'm convinced that this very spirit that's on you now is the Holy Ghost I am fairly convinced that the Holy Ghost is right he convinced that the Bible is so is the truth I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ here now and I'm convinced that he'll heal evil every sick person in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye I'm convinced he poured out the Holy Ghost upon here till there should be a shout to tell her there be such a shout till hard to to tell what would take place I'm convinced hallelujah he said I'm convinced that he's here now I'm convinced to Pillar fire as the same pillar of fire that was with Israel in the wilderness and it's the same pillar of fire with the church I'm convinced by the grace of God I trust we're convinced amen brother let's make sure that we're not indicted that we're not souls in prison and we're not false anointed ones at the end but we are the true anointed seed of God by the grace of God amen god bless you let's stay I could go on but it's quite a while well I'll share this with you they said that a boy asked his father he said dad how big is God my biggest gone and the father seen this as an opportunity to give a good lesson to his son and he said it depends to which the son answered with curiosity why looking to the sky his father saw an airplane and asked his son what size did he think that airplane was up there in the sky and the child replied very small he said it looks very small I can barely see it then the father took him to the airport and being close to the plane he asked his son now he said how big is the plane now and the boy replied very amazed he said dad it's huge he said wow he said it is so big then the father said son this is how God is for you his size will depend on the death distance that you have from him and likewise that will affect your view of him your concept of him and your experience with him he said how far have you put God the closer you are to God the bigger he will be in your life and your concept of him will be of a great awesome loving and power for god that he is a man if that is not how you see God right now maybe you need to get a little closer to the Lord a man to a lot of people God is small to a lot of evil goddess in the distance to a lot of people you can't hear his voice just a whisper well where's gone he's far away don't let him come closer you will hear his voice and you will see him a man again as the brother ministered here concerning hearing God call your name Hey and the devil hey now he said the more you listen to the devil he said the louder he becomes and God gets more client is more low he said hey and God is a depends on who you're gonna listen to it depends on who you're focusing on this focus on the Lord not the devil Satan is there to get your attention for this your attention for that but God is there to get your attention to his love Amen praise the name of the Lord let's sing when the roll is
