the Lord the blessings many times are sitting right in front of you every single one amen and that's why we pray for each other and that's why we support each other and you notice that like I came across the saying that that is common among the Jews and that is it's the responsibility every Jew to look after each other and you know the conflicts that they've been through excuse me over over the years and they look after each other like goes with them it was the same the spiritual Jew isn't the same as the body of Christ amen so we pray for each other we uphold each other because of the grace

Him amen and like David said the very last in the very nice Sun on 150 the very last first we made everything that has breath you got breath giving praise because the breath comes from him 451 his yoke is easy his burden is light Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] where [Music] [Music] praise the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a man [Music] [Applause] and by night we're living water slow a man trust her singing the truth a man that well god knows a man he knows the heart man sees one thing God sees another a man God knows one thing our man knows one thing but God knows at all a man so as like he said in the word it's a warning and he said he said my ways are not your ways I mean they're my thoughts yours but as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than yours my thoughts higher than yours that's what we got to come down and we got a home allow ourselves from that God reveal it a man and they've got and and what God is looking for in arles is that he's asking us to believe it a man what he reveals believe it's not whether you understand it intellectually but do you really believe it in your heart that all things are possible amen see so brother there's one thing to say another thing to do to go and bring forth the life of one that believes all things are possible a man is not what we want well what God wants a man by the grace of God so the Lord blesses and grace to those that the pray they prayed for concerning the sickness and our brother Jeremiah and our brother in Ontario the God of all grace I pray be with them and like I said I've received emails for prayer requests and with different problems different needs but brother it's going to increase please do we believe it do we believe what the prophecy concerning the germ warfare or do we think that we're going to overcome the germ warfare our way no no we got to do it God's Way and remembering this this is a challenge to our faith a man he said is going to come upon all not it didn't believe the message could come upon all without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Amen so brother you can't you could try to you know help yourself this way up yourself that way that way that way focus on the natural but it's getting to a place where the only thing that's going to help us is the eternal a menace the eternal revelation of God the eternal word a man so brother is serious God is challenging our faith brother as he say well when he comes will he find faith on the earth I believe I mentioned in the one or two previous sermons there that the thing that that bothered Jesus so much and troubled him so much was the lack of faith believe us the how this you know and he said oh ye of little faith and so on so if he was considering dental faith then what's he considering now old brother in this hour we're in a few will be saved so the grace of God to his brother that we're going to believe God please in the name of Jesus let's believe the word it is written let's not let the devil talk to us let us talk to the devil a man and I believe brother Bob referenced the preacher that would say that mood to the devil you know but most people are falling falling short of that and they're falling prey to the to the boo from the devil not to the devil it's to that it's it's from the devil that is the absolute truth rather the devil is there and he's boon for this he's boon you for that but where's your faith rather Jesus gave us the example Jesus told us what to do Jesus told us how to deal with those situations he said what what is it it is written it is written and so on and though she said man shall not live by bread alone when the devil tempted him to turn the stone to bread and so on and all mine we're living in a world that would be glad to do it because they want more bread and they want more this to want more of that and so on Jesus rebuked them even at forty days after that fast and he God got hungry he says you can turn to the bread he can he could but he because like I just reminded us a little while ago that that twice he fed so many thousand with so many loaves of bread to fish yeah and and so he coulda be slits and the devil knew he could she could turn the stone into bread well brother is but it wasn't the will of God a man that was the devil tempting him no brother sister listen no matter how how good sometimes the devil is tempting us with this and this this makes sure it's the will of God amen what is the will of God that Jesus wouldn't do it because he was going to be the example for generations to come you and me amen any and he said all this and this and this and if you fall down and worship Me he said you you you can worship not even no one but God only a man by the grace of God so you got to come back to the devil with the word the MU is the word a man and it says get thee behind me Satan it is written a man by the grace of God even and sometimes you know as Satan you can say I'm a believer I'm a Christian if sometimes Satan can still control your head and your thoughts and your voice some of the things you say oh yes most definitely but you got you got a case why he was using Peter and he to discourage Jesus he was using Peter to get Jesus do this get Jesus to do that a man way and Peter said you know do this do that and and Jesus acknowledged that it was the devil just think of that it was our beloved PA Apostle Peter and what power that he had an anointing and when the Holy Ghost came but brother during this during this this part of the Ministry of Jesus Jesus looked at Peters he get thee behind me Satan thou savourest not the things that be of God a man old brothers sister we need to be more conscious not just in the message we need the conscience of the devil because I don't know that he's coming down with great wrath knowing his time is short brother sees that his actions are based on his what he knows and and what he know and why does he know it he knows of what we know a man by the grace of God he knows that because of what we have done and what we are doing things we separated unto the Lord by the grace of God staying with the word leaving the church world not condemning the people now the devil would love to get you to do that a man he would know no just keep you're headed to right your spirit right a man Jesus did any man they and Father forgive them for they know not what they do a man so like and Jesus attitude to where Peter was was was good a man and he confirmed the love of Peter for him a man so brother the grace of God to us and especially in this hour please lord help us to believe not just a doctrine but to believe what the Prophet warned us concerning what's coming in these last days so brothers don't don't just assume everything's fine I believe the message I got I don't had no worries no Jesus did all the worrying yeah the Bible says he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin a man heady and he fell on his knees not my will thine be done just think the Messiah God in flesh acted that way a man why because he was identifying with you and me he's identifying with the Saints down through the ages when the tests would come a man and then remember the father says the bride's gonna stay a while and he said what force because God's going to test these things amen test the attitude of the bride and so on but by the grace of God please you're in the flesh so makes you make sure that it's God in your heart controlling your spirit and controlling your thoughts and your your actions because the devil is their work it's a great war how much a much greater is that war now that it was a may as the was in the Alpha ministry so it is in the Omega ministry because that was God in flesh and the devil knew it now is God in flesh it's in the end and I an scripture is fulfilled a man and he know he knows this time is short and so he's going to be a enos tackiness taking us deceiving us deceiving and one of the Bowser's be sold so close they would deceive the very elect if possible that's bad so just don't assume everything so again too many assumes that I'm a Christian I've been baptized I go to church but Paul said make your calling and election sure amen and we did we daily do that amen in our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and what in our relationship with him getting getting more and more power over the devil because as God is there Jesus is there the devil is there a man but he God as Jesus is working on our souls and our spiritual eyes with the in on our physical lives a man if things get worse out there brother I tell you more and more when he's go to be weakened in their faith oh yeah when it comes to faith in God amen we kind of trusting God for the problems that you might have trusting God for the needs that you might have amen but I tell you many believers are compromising and many believers are going to compromise more and more what for because they want more and more and more satisfaction in the world a man where God's going to make it very unsatisfactory you can allow the devil to do that so that we want to get out of here amen it's the same thing with the D with the Jews in Egypt the the Egyptian bondage a man and and it got this way got that way good this way so finally they wanted to get out again and I got to keep reminding you the Prophet says you'll go when you want to go amen but there's too many not wanting to go not hungry go not thirsting to go they're just they're just going well I believe the message that I'm just waiting for the rapture no the raptures waiting for you a man by the grace of God brother you were looking for rapture it's him you you're looking for this it's in you you're looking for God to meet this need it's in you but people believe it's there no no it's here amen so a Redemption wasn't over there it was in Jesus a man and he knew that what he was enduring what he was suffering was what it was the enemy lady what he had on the inside a man that's the truth and the enemy is fighting what God has revealed to us concerning the end and the resurrection the coming of the Lord the resurrection of the rapture amen so I'll tell you this brother this serious and again there's no wonder no wonder that like Jesus when they find faith and what is that faith I don't know if you noticed it or not but I agree I agree with our brother Scofield and I know brother Branham did their faith is he said it belief not just belief in God no no he said it is belief in the whole body of revealed truth this is amazing that God would anoint that brother he was an atheist brother Scofield he was an atheist he was a lawyer until one day that God dealt with him and he became a Christian amen and he and O God took over in his life he really repented he was really changed he became a new creature in Christ a man and he got ready to the word a man and he went from Genesis to Revelation and brother and that's that's when it comes to the the book we use sometimes it is like the Scofield addition of the of the scriptures with the notes and this is this is what I have here and it's the notes are by Scofield and the power of God had the same thing and now and I'm like I said in one one there in Matthew it's amazing one of the scriptures in Matthew there and Scofield is listing he listed seven item seven things that what God was going to do down through the ages and in the end and the prophet of God listed the same thing and seen one of the messages and brother BAM this to dis this this this but he added more to it yeah we Scofield went were seven brother ham went on with maybe 14 15 I don't know but a lot more than what God was doing because we're in the reality of it and our brother Scofield was just looking ahead he had the full revelation a man but thank God for the revelation that he had a man and not not denominational and and our brother was about way back in the early nineteen under said he did what he did brother and I'm it was God almost definitely it was it was the Lord a man and and again brother Brennan did highlight another version of the scriptures that that not burden not beyond the King James but the notes that the brother put included and so on and and he said maybe it'd be better he said if I if I used that that brother's translation of the of the Bible a man but he stayed with Scofield and brother his belief in the whole body of revealed truth when the Son of Man comes is he going to find belief in the whole body I'll reveal truth not not just a portion of it all of it amen by the grace of God and again to remind you of the prophet of God said that he said your actions speak louder than your words amen and that's the truth so God God be merciful and help us so that we're born again and we're bringing forth the actions of that born-again believer sons and daughters of God we're bringing for the actions a man of Christ in eternity by the grace of God because we are one with him that's tremendous praise the name of the Lord Jesus not just the historical figure it's the present-day truth its Christ in you the hope of glory it's Christ with us it's craziness hey man it's Christ revealed his word to us amen to be that we're gonna be caught up into the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of God what their marriage supper is desperately as that's up to God they're there like I said one time the believers came into my house and and they were shocked and amazed because of a picture I had there and it was of the it was of a supper table and and they went out and went and told somebody else they said listen listen he said I think he said brother journalist said believes he said in an early in a real supper as someone a real Mary there's very suffer of the lamb I kept but to them it was spiritual brother the spiritual the natural types of spiritual a man by the grace of God we are being fed spiritually and I'm not dying when we give there will have something to eat as well by the grace of God amen so brother god help us that we're gonna believe it a man that stay with the truth a man and let God control you it's not you controlling God I tell you there's a lot controlling God or trying to control God Amen that's the devil no no no no you can't let God control you a man not my how many are willing to say I mean any in any circumstance in your life in any situation your life say Lord not my will do I be done yeah then brother brown again said I quote I quoted in one of the messages here recently where he said is it's not Lord do this Lord do that he said you got to press your way into the kingdom amen God gives you the revelation to create the hunger and thirst to go in God gave Israel the revelation so that when they went down into Egypt there come a time when they would remember what God promised amen through Abraham Easter daily for 400 years and he said that I'll deliver them amen but he was waiting for them to hunger thirst he suffered the cries of my people I have come down to deliver them amen so brother God has heard the cries of the bride and he has come down to deliver Oh amen the Lord has come the Lord is with us the Lord is in us amen so let's be in prayer god help us brother to me to take the rapture seriously take it serious because well that's what God's requiring of us he's not God wanted you to go out and do this quote and do that goodness I mean no no God now is ragazze requiring the the rock rock for faith and the resurrection faith a man as it was in the office autism the Omega so brother and God God's gonna do God's gonna allow this to happen like that to heaven well for to bring out your faith he's gonna allow the pressure to come down distress to come down and so on to manifest your faith to see if you really believe a man or see if you're going to compromise most are compromising and will compromise but there's a few that won't amen they'll lay down their lives they'll forsake anything they got Lord not you might will die and be done it praise the name of the Lord so I just want to just before we get in go into I want to try - grace - of God to finish this thought on the grace of God amen but before I just want to let you know that the Lord willing that brother Matthew sent me a link but he's told me he sent it to others as well and I might play it there in the church concerning a brother preaching 40 years ago on the Eagle amen and it's tremendous so we might show this on the screen here comes Tony art you don't see our brother he just see the eagle and that was 40 years ago so I guess they didn't have the DVDs like didn't like we have today so it'd be good for us to hear it again concerning the Eagles because their Bible says you will mount up with wings as Eagles amen praise the Lord Ron and not be weary walk and not faint no no your your it is Christ in you so the Lord will then want to take that time to play that and there's there's another article that brother Alex Emily is tremendous and brother New Zealand did this article and it's evening my fellow ship have lived in New Zealand and and he did this article and it's on YouTube and it goes from the beginning to the end a man and you hit you here in the in the background you hear the prophet ministry on this thought this thought this thought this time this time that time a man and there's a brother there quoting scripture that reads the scripture and then the Prophet comes in and comments on it Amen so it's good so the Lord willing we'll it's really good you go right on through from-from the age of two me eternity down through time back to eternity a man the brother did a tremendous job in annihilating the scriptures and what God has done in these last days amen and why God has done down through the ages so the Lord willing we want to take time for that as well and for the brother on us preaching on the Eagles maybe we'll have to have to certain we have to services for that because he preached it twice amen and once he's just over around 45 minutes and other time is just over half an hour that he's preaching and I was looking at a quote where the prophet of God said do you realize he said that that six know 20 minutes of inspirational preaching he said is is arter then he said eight hours of what was it he used oh the sledgehammer he said is it as other than it using you know working hard with eight hours of a sledgehammer he said and 20 minutes of anointed preaching is harder than that so he said you understand the ministry and he said why the ministry feels a certain way and so on he says not easy it's tremendous burden because we're not dealing with man we're dealing with God first then we deal with me a man so we know it's not it's not going to be easy because even got the prophets had problems with it even Elijah had a problem you know and he just went on out into the wilderness and so on and he wanted to die yeah oh yeah he wanted to even want to die cuz he when God spoke to him he said the Lord I'm worse than I'm not it I'm worse than my forefathers and they were they're a lot better than he he wasn't God encouraged him amen so sorry he said Elijah go back he's I reserved unto myself 7,000 amen so brother grace of God to us and so we're encouraged by what the Elijah was encouraged God encouraged Elijah and and he encouraged us with what that adage took on a shortened time and me you know it's true I don't know I trust you see it and I trust this taking taking effect in your life in your heart in your soul in your mind that you can't get away from it concerning the deception of the hour we live in don't assume everything is fine you got to work it out amen God God puts it in then God God is working it out amen by grace the Lord give us the faith that really really really pleases you amen not knowledge but the maquette but the yes knowledge but anointed with the dynamics a man because it'll come to the place it isn't he said have come to that place a perfect faith he said that it only is just said when that hour comes it just take he said a man or woman a boy or a girl he said just stand there and look up and say Lord I'm coming home and he said Oh sparked the rapture amen and the resurrection that's right but people are not conscious of it not now they're not through the day every day oh they just can't do just focusing on their their natural eyes let's focus on the spiritual not the natural everybody's focused on natural looking to please the natural looking to satisfy the natural make the natural comfortable God's gonna make the natural uncomfortable oh yes he is so that we want the spiritual we want the eternal like Jesus got tired of this old flesh he was in back there 2,000 years ago sure the brides getting tired of it hey man so the grace to a sword right that's why that the Holy Spirit we don't feel it like they did in previous ages because God wants us to hunger and thirst to get it to go home to be with him a man you'll just stop it amen so the grace of God be with us and also justice that where I was having testimonies by certain ones in the congregation and I did say if there's anyone that wanted to give a testimony just feel free to let me know and we'll give you the time to give you a testimony and maybe we'll give our brother Joshua at that time we did we as we gave it to our brother John and brother Faisal a man and and other other brothers here and of course even a sister's got got that right to testify to concerning the grace of God in their lives amen so we want maybe to get brother Matthew to testify he said no when I first asked him amen but he said it shocked him so that's why he said no so so maybe soon we'll have brother Matthew to come up and give a testimony and also I did mentioned that we wanted to brother Craig the finishes testimony he started it in in Al Carlos building after quite a number of years ago a man so I said the Lord willing was willing to get in to finish it so we get our brother to finish his testimony by the grace of God a man so the Lord be with us the God help us is my prayer brother a man so again we will the best replay those those Eagle messages and also the the one that brother Alec sent the link to me if it was good amen but the brother of mustard he had really yet understanding I think he had revelation to lay it all out amen and concerning brother Paula Fontaine I was checking his site just a couple of days ago and looking for a phone number we'll eventually got it from brother Matthew's sister Kimberly and and I just clicked on a message she was preaching there oh he was saying the same thing I say sharing the rapture at the resurrection oh he's preaching on the same thing that's amazing oh yeah he was bringing it out then I said oh I see did he hear me say that no but the Holy Ghost said it a man so I'll say it he'll say it another another brother was saying so on so in it you can be a prayer amen by the grace of God listen Ana's saying only really and we go to the word only [Music] possible [Music] only be Oh [Music] oh oh oh please praise the Lord [Applause] oh please little pain TTS thank you Jesus yes each year hallelujah amen all things are possible next Billy Jesus she's here Lord Lord glory hallelujah hallelujah hey grace praise race hey my aunt hallelujah we believe what great race reveal Waverly what great [Music] Oh planes are possible Lord me pray trust gone pray is just not with your life it says God with all that's in your life hate me hate me yes pray and trust you they will you easy hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah [Applause] [Music] yes you do amen amen amen pray and trust on a man Heavenly Father help us to pray and to trust you Halas pray believing you believing your word believing your message believing the messenger and then believing Lord well your your faith is projected Lord by grace through faith by your grace is projected amen the faith of God what you're asking us to believe so Lord that you can do what you want to do father you're going to do it in us you're going to do it through us you're going to make father that word to flesh in me and in my brothers and sisters oh god I pray have mercy on us forgive us of our see and forgive us of our and believe forgive us of our doubt father that we're gonna believe you Lord the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth father it is not my will but thine be done we're not going to believe what the devil says we're going to believe what you have said we're not going to we're going to believe what you have done what you are doing and what you will do we're going to stay with the truth we're going to stay Lord with the word so we asked for the grace and the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen it is the life of your blood in us it is the life of your blood with us praise the name of the Lord hallelujah father that you would be made flesh in us that the word would be made flesh in my brothers and sisters that is not me is not them that lives is Christ they live within them hey man as Jesus declared that it was not him it was not the flesh it was God in him he was crazy and it was the Holy Ghost it in a man the anointed word it was the father a man working out his will in the flesh of his son praise the name of the Lord trusting grace the Lord that is holy goes that it is Christ in us working out the will of God in the bride working over the will of God in the sons and daughters of God Alleluia regress Oh God that we're going to surrender all the you I surrender all or a man by the grace of God all the Jesus I surrender amen Lord I pray in the name of Jesus that is the truth that we have surrendered all to you and it Oh God that you are in control of our thoughts our words and our deeds then you are there Lord to recognize the enemy to rebuke the enemy as we plead the blood of Jesus against the enemy a man the signal is read of Jesus and the life of that blood I plead Lord for the for those in the hearing of my voice father the pile and anointing of the Holy Ghost in my brothers the power the anointing of the Holy Ghost in my sisters the power the only of the Holy goes in control of this assembly a man and to our brothers and sisters across the island Lord a man the grace of God in the name of Jesus Christ making the word absolute reality making the word flesh in us amen so Lord is not me it's the word in me any man I'm not saying that it's the word Satan I'm not doing it it is the word doing it it's Jesus so the grace of God Lord of a man take control take more and more control of each brother take more and more control of each sister a man so we are going to catch down reasoning and we're going to go by faith father knowing Lord that faith doesn't have any reasoning faith believes the word faith as God thus saith the Lord it is written a man so far the grace that were going to live from the inside out father no reasoning just faith in God no reasoning just believing the word that it is written a man father make our calling an election sure with it is written make our calling election sure by checking the save the Lord a man by looking into the perfect mirror of the Word of God and not turning away or forgetting what we see we see sinners saved by grace any man and we see God working out Lord what you had worked him a made by the baptism of

and acceptable and perfect will of God amen god help us to live seeking the good the acceptable and the perfect will of God in our lives by the grace of God for I say through the grace given unto me amen grace the ministry speaks by the grace given unto them it is to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think because in in the eyes of God we are all say saved by grace through faith a man is what God has done with God is doing a man so let's not think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think this thing Kylie of him and he said but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith Alleluia he has dealt to every one of us the measure of faith the faith that we need in our lives of faith that we need to face the different situations and circumstances for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office a man and we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another as their oneness is with the father and the son so is the oneness with one another in the body as the sons and daughters of God so everyone members one of another what a oneness and everything gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith amen it's all by faith your testimony is my faith the Ministry of the word by faith amen what we do is by faith living out the light we're going by faith without faith it is impossible absolutely impossible to please God so he said all our ministry let us wait on our ministry or either teacher on teaching wait on the Lord or he that exhorteth on exhortation he they giveth let him do it with simplicity a man a man all brother where are we let him do it with simplicity and he that ruleth with diligence amen do it with diligence and he that showed mercy with cheerfulness a man showing that you have nothing against your brothers and sisters in Christ for he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness mercy not the ministry there's no problem you think Kylie of yourself so you'll be will be happy in this and this this this but when it comes to showing mercy to one another oh you put yourself down put the other person up a man and he said ëthat showeth mercy with cheerfulness understand the difference was being showing mercy and all the other things that God has ordained let love be without dissimulation their love be without hypocrisy let it be real Holy Ghost love oh that's tremendous is what human love is one thing Holy Ghost love is another a man bore that which is evil claim to that which is good be kind Lee affection one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another amen this is amazing and brother but this is the results of grace and true faith in our hearts so be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and in honour preferring one another not looking for attention for yourself let's give somebody else attention preferring one another Amen you're getting preference to God in that brother in that sister he man this is amazing in honour preferring one another and not slothful in business but fervent in spirit were to be diligent and were to be fervent serving the Lord rejoice in Hope patient in tribulation a man we rejoice in the hope that God has given us and is giving us and we are patient in the tribulation that we are experiencing continuing instant in prayer amen instant in prayer call on Collies and all answer distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality amen oh brother what a responsibility let's judge ourselves by this word by the grace of God it takes grace brother and it takes faith to do what we're told to do distributing to the necessity of saints and given to hospitality and has said bless them which persecute you bless and curse not that's right keep your attitude rate keep your spirit right amen because there's no way you can judge them if your spirits not right they'll judge you keep your spirit rage your attitude rate amen rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep that's right you're gonna cry with them they may be of the same mind one toward another mind not I things amen but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men brothers this has got to be by grace through faith amen the revelation of the will of God so provide things honest in the sight of all men and if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men that takes grace dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord amen you leave it with God therefore thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head man you're not going to do it there just to condemn him but you're gonna do it with the right attitude or the right spirit but because he's not repentant he doesn't me that person doesn't have the right attitude then Jerry because the fire on their head you're being good to them but they're not being good to you god help us there's a lot of believers brother got that attitude person is good to them what are we good to you yeah you gotta if they're good to you you're gonna be good to them and no he has gotta be sincere it's got you from your heart hey man you've got a reunion this is amazing be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good and evil is anything this country to the word and the Spirit of God god bless is word you may be seated and the thoughts that we have been ministering on is the grace of God and it has struck me because it goes beyond what we refer to as the grace covenant and in the study of the word I have discovered that grace goes back not just through the New Testament but it goes back through the Old Testament that we refer to as the Covenant of the law but it is Grace a man it is Grace they gave them the revelation that would please God in that day and in that hour before the Messiah was made flesh before the word came in flesh to redeem them and I noticed that grace goes right back to Genesis and grades go back beyond Genesis let's have the understanding the grace is not just coming into effect company rather into the mind of God or the thoughts of God in the Garden of Eden because of sin but grace was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth a man period just think of that he created it in the in the beginning and then as I have ministered on a number of times and he had a plan he had a purpose and he had a pattern and you go on to Genesis 1 and 2 and here is the plan and the bourbons and the pattern of God is beginning a man but Genesis 1:1 it just tells us that God created the heaven and the earth it doesn't tell us how long he took a man but now when it comes to changing the earth and doing this to the earth and the universe then it tells us that the first was the first day and the evening in the morning were the second day and the third day well one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day so was that a 24-hour day or was that a thousand years a man so we just leave that with the Lord but when it comes to the creation as that's just changing the earth and I just sitting the earth out / antimony as sitting the earth up for human me but when it comes to the creation in the beginning God created the heaven in the earth period it doesn't say how long he took God God spoke the word and this happened and this was happening we don't know it could have it could have been with it within a few hours it could have been within a million years you know science thinks in the Bible the Bible is country due to what they think is scientific proof no no no the truth the prophet of God told us he said listen he's a true science and he said and the word he said blends together true science and the word he said agrees together and he highlighted this in Revelation in Genesis chapter 1 he said science says oh God took this this this many million years to create the heaven and the earth and he said then dance science that go back to the Bible and said oh but the Bible says he took six days and so on no no it's a the Bible just says in the beginning he did it and period amen but then it was it was like this they within a certain condition so God came down to make it livable amen so how long he took that's up to him but but there's grace we go back beyond creation and there was grace and the mind of God there is grace or the thoughts of God there was grace in the plan of God and the purpose of God and the pattern of God amen brother sister we're going to read the word we're going to listen to the word we're going to study the word in the spirit alternative is it's going to bear witness of the grace of God amen because divine law projects Greece and Greece predicts the fee or the revelation of what God has done and what God is doing amen and what God will do and all the way down through that Greece was president divine love is projected grace Old Testament New Testament and right to the hour that you and I are living in and that grace has projected the faith that haven't even needed but walked around but he not needed and what and what Abel needed a man but Cain rejected but it was by grace through faith that Abel offered the more excellent sacrifice a man the virus tells us all by faith Abel did this by faith they did this by paint yeah but where do their faith come from he came through the grace of God because it is by grace through faith that we are saying it is by grace through faith that God gave Abel the revelation that he needed JEA gave no other than a revelation they needed in that hour of judgment amen and it is by grace through faith amen that what he taught me to hate man to what we've gone Alleluia oh by faith Enoch was well it was Radford Enoch was transported and that we wouldn't see it God just took him off the face of the earth well brother that's still great amen Enoch ahead just like just like Adam any and just like Cain and Abel Enoch also and what he had a choice to make because God revealed himself to Enoch and Enoch believed God amen and Enoch walked with God he not was thinking God he not was concentrating on God he not was desiring to please God hinata to this if there was anyone that was humbled it was he not because there is no other way Norway for God to reveal himself in Enoch and through Enoch the way that he did but that he had to have that humility to recognize God to Humble himself in the presence of God amen and to recognize that he needed God and he needed the deliverance amen he needed the love of God he needed the grace of God and brother the Bible says that he not walk with God and he was not because God took him a man and if he walked with God a man what was he doing here because doing what Jesus was instructing us to do he was walking in the light a man he didn't just come into the light no no he walked in it a man and what was he responding to he was responding to the faith that the light was revealing amen walking the light as he is in the light walking the spirit as he is in the spirit you talk about a oneness that Enoch had with God and again he was the seventh from the first Adam and I sure maybe in this message on the message of grace and there was another message that brother been referred to Enoch but he kept saying he know it was the seventh from Adam from that Noah five seven who know one seven from the one second from Noah but then in the next message or two he apologized he said I'm sorry he said Enoch wasn't the seven from Noah he was the seventh from the first animal and we are the seventh from the second Adam any men even our Lord Jesus Christ and so as Enoch was raptured so he said now we're going to be raptured by the grace of God see we got to recognize the Word of God ain't man we gotta recognize that's grace brother I tell you this divine law approach that is great and grace is going to reveal to us what God wants us to know God your grades are going to reveal to us what God wants us to do grace is going to reveal to us what God wants us to say amen and where God wants us to go oh it got great grace is there to give us the faith that we need a man and brother we're living by faith the believer lives by faith amen when I leave me buddy Saint but living by faith no matter what you do you're doing you're doing it but it's the revelation of God amen as I said concerning that brother that worked in Ontario there as a director in a large Hospital but he was a believer and he wasn't close to a church and he quit his job as a director and he went to any any move to Alberta near it close to a church for for his sake and for his family's sake and what did he what was his job II took the job of a janitor and a man brother God and sometimes God challenges the same way a man what is it well Lord whatever your will is I'll do amen it's not what I want to do is not Lord what what the devil wants me to do is what you want me to do and Lord and if it means the less money I'll take it it means less of this less friends I'll take it and if it means sometimes it might mean I got to do this they got to do that I got to bear their second barrier well that's fine Lord amen that might that brother quit that as director of a hospital brother how many is going to do that and many believers are are quitting this and quitting this for the Gospels sake for the kingdom of God's sake and for the message say think a man there's not many doing as they can so that they can be close to a church amen they can be close to a federal fellowship with other believers amen so find the will of God brother as we find out in the Bible week we could take one example after another in the scripture concerning the grace of God revealing the faith of God to this one - that one - this one amen to get him the in the will of God amen brother sister and oh my god chiana's if not just believing this and believing there the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as you see the Day approaching and we're getting to the place where believers are fellowshiping less and less and less amen because they're more intercity in the pleasures of this world normal Anderson in their holidays and they want to do this they want to do that what about God a man where's God in church because we brothers are somewhere where they don't have the revelation of the greatness of eternity they don't have the revelation of the greatness of a new body they don't have the revelation of the greatness and the beauty and the power and the anointing of the atmosphere in the kingdom of God brothers satisfied with this atmosphere we're getting down to a place where we're going to hate an age sin as God ain't a man might agree with Almighty God however the law that we're going to hate sin hate the pollution of this world we want to get into the kingdom of God brother we're through that we're going to please the the new creature in Christ I'm born again I'm the son of God I'm a daughter of god you're a daughter of God a man so now you want to get in into an atmosphere where the sons and daughters of God are enjoying it and there and more happy and old mind their their fellowship with God they love God to fellowship with those outside the city and so on oh it's wonderful but but again not many guy that attitude not many God that hunger not many God that thirst listen I appreciate some years ago in on Topsail Road there and concerning lonesome oh so lonesome a man and the private acharya just rode that road that little poem and because he said when he was young and he sent along some old so lonesome for that far away southwest and where they were this where there's something there's something deepens in the west on the mountains there and so on concerning the the sun and the and the shadow and so on but why would why did he really did he write that as young man because there was many years later that God called him hey man brother that might have might have been in the in the 1920s and that he rode that but again it was in 1962 that God would be in the n62 y'all Late Late 62 that God began to lay it on his heart to move from east to west amen and he was hungry and he was searching to go where where's any any eventually after 97 62 he moved to Jeffersonville Indiana a man RJ Jerrod not Jefferson Hill from Jeffersonville to Tucson Arizona a man brother why you see this is God in the beginning God created the heaven in the earth and him and his grace went for was going forward with him amen because main we needed with him Ray was the grace of God him we have met him through the faith he wrote he wrote that poem amen why was he lonesome also lonesome weather for the faraway Southwest in Tucson Arizona hey man he didn't realize that but a brother in the late sixties God began to put him make it a burden on his heart and so on oh there's other things I could say about it but what was it because it was in 98 it was in February 62 that the the pillar there not the pillar of fire but the angels came down a man and it was just outside of Tucson Arizona and by the grace of God we were there a man in that area where the pillar of fire came down that a when I when I was yeah when I was in in the States in 1997 and and we went went to through sauna and we went to where the angels came down and we went to the rocker brother band were standing on ice and I got the picture somewhere the Prophet and his son Joseph and and and the light and the pillar fire was over them and over the rock and I could turn around from the rock and look across the valley and there was the where the angels came down a man so that's why that's why God had created by grace through faith that he had created in the power that hunger and that thirst to go west amen and when but again it was to meet the angels there was the meet our Lord Jesus Christ and so on and he got the instructions now he's to go back east he said for the opening of the seven seals a Mayan city as their brothers sister all things are in order when it comes to the plan of God and the purpose of God and a pattern of God God knows what he's doing amen and I have preached on it maybe three three or four times lonesome oh so lonesome and I remember when I the first of my priests haunted outside this assembly the brother came into the office where I was always - what's the title of your message and that you're going to preach on I said lonesome oh so lonesome and it shocked him and he said what how do you spell that and I said well I said do you smell it this way and he said no soon yeah I said lonesome oh so lonesome and I said I said you'll know you'll know what it means I said when I get out there and by the grace of God I Minister the Word of God amen okay he said so he just took it I and I had to tell him how to write it down on paper and I went on and ministered on it I said and again I say he was voting some also lonesome for the faraway so where's I said because there was garbage going to medium and the angels were going to come down he was going to get the instructions that he needed knowing that he had other things to do over there as well and I won't get into that but yeah and then I said he was instructed to go back for the old me of the word amen see what God does and how God does it what in the way to God send the Angels down down there somewhere in jeffersonville no no no it was to bring out other spirits and so on that was in the people to test the faith of the prophet and and to bring out the faith of the people because when the prophet of God as I said moved to Tucson in 1962 there were a lot of believers that also moved out a man and they felt because they felt that that's where the the New Jerusalem was going to come down over there and others felt the New Jerusalem was going to come down in the in the Jeffersonville area and it was no no their brothers did not err it's going to be in Israel it's going to be the New Jerusalem by the grace of God so this is this is God's plan and God's purpose and God's pattern and he did it in the private obedient and then living there for a short time then he moved back for the old me of the word amen and of course then we built we know that he built a house in Tucson and I've been in the house I've been in his den and so on and yet he never lived in that house because he was building it for his family he knew that he was going because they say and when when a.m. and another brother walked up to where they were building the house and they went up and they turned in and walked up the hill a little bit and there was this old cart or something there in the driveway or on the side of the driveway and it belonged to somebody that lived there a number of years before lived in that area and the public God said you see this he said brother yeah and he said that's that's a sign of someone he said who has finished their their their job finish their there whatever was predestinated for them finish their lives and he said they were they didn't need it anymore they left it there a million and that was a sign of why he was building that ounce amen because why it wasn't for him it was for his wife and family amen because God was going to call him home amen so brother sister God has got a plan and a purpose and a pattern when it comes to the truth of creation and what and what he has done and what he is doing and the and the heavens and the earth and the universe amen but he's got a plan and a purpose and a patter for your life a million were born in sin saved in iniquity come to the words Reagan lines and we're going to do what we want to do but then we'll begin to when we repent and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God responding to our faith gives us the Holy Ghost we're new creatures in Christ amen so it's not our natural birth control ears anymore it is our spiritual birth amen we're not going but what we feel and what we think and what we sense now we're going by faith it is the grace of God giving us the faith that I need and the revelation that I need to do this to do this go here go there ain't 9 you're a man that's not what you what you want to do is what God wants you to do oh my oh my oh my help us lord I pray because over the years I have seen so many believers they're doing what they want to do I'm a believer and I can do this and I can do that brother if you're a believer you got to die to yourself and you go become alive and sensitive to the body of Christ and the brothers and sisters are like precious thing and we have just read here in the book in Romans chapter 12 amen this is a God requires this of us amen and it is the grace of God that anointed the ball to write what he wrote to the Romans amen and then we know the Romans were the Gentiles they say that's definitely you and me by the grace of Almighty God through His grace in the ministry of Paul to give us this revelation of the will of God for everyday living as sons and daughters of God and as Christians a night as relievers by the grace of God amen whether we are Christians and God is in control and if there's anything that we're going to manifest and anything that we're going to bear witness of is the grace of God amen amen amen yeah brother if there's anything that we ought to highlight in the message in the Word of God anything I God is going to highlight it is Grace it is unmerited favor amen brother so it was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world before he created the heaven and the earth there was grace he knew that he knew what was going to happen when he do this he knew what was going to happen when he did that amen so brother and he also knew they brothers sister whatever what was going to heaven he knew that those that his creation was going to need grace amen he knew that they're going to render good that Adam and Eve was going to need the grace of God and that they would need to show grace to the to the to the heaven and the earth amen because of the way they give the was going to treat everything on the evident the earth Satan is the god of this world and brother through there when it comes to oh the cousin are we talking to our brother David here concerning what God has done what God has done yeah and the devil is perverted at all and brother is not in any and it's just not the human body and the fleshly but the devil is perverted all creation the devil is perverted the trees and the plants and all of that amen and the earth that's why God is going to show the earth and of the son and his Cheyenne is going to burn from the inside out so they say there's not going to be any any any indication of sin left on the earth amen it's going to be burnt from the inside out and he said God creates the new heaven and a new earth as you and I are born again the prophet of God said the new he said the new heaven and the new earth it's it's new creation it's an older born again he said your God is going to change them as he changed you and me amen from what they are to what they were in the beginning a man perfect brother again it is all grease grease grease when we consider what man has done from Genesis when we consider what man has done right on through down to even to the end of the book of Revelation amen it is the grace of God amen God saw it God knew it he knew this he knew this he knew that but he praise His grace which was there to project the faith that would change it His grace was interpreting the faith that would change you and me God Elvis rather to be spiritually minded God Elvis to be controlled by the Holy Ghost so again it's crazy the NS may the Holy Ghost ain't know this tremendous Jesus is living in us Jesus and listen now the historical figure by the real Lord Jesus Christ a man and again as he said I'll not leave you covering us all come to you and in that day you'll know I mean the father the father me I in you you and me type of oneness a million so brother Oh hallelujah so we are in Christ crisis in the father and where does that take us back to eternity amen that's where we come from ain't man then the enemy got us trapped into these into these bodies but Jesus has set forth Alleluia the grace of God has said for the faith to get us out of these bodies and to get us out of time and back to eternity amen by the grace of God amen we know that and that's the seed of God not serpent seed by the seed of God there was Cain he was serpent seed and there's the seed of God amen and as I said both of them - both of them offered sacrifice to the Lord both them were worshiping God a man but they would not but Cain would not do the will of God a man he refused the faith of God but that was grace you died the grace that's Grace and God came down to the cane and he asked came this he talked the cane it's hard to cane it was grace that got that told Cain if you do right once you also be accepted that was great but he knew he wasn't gonna do right everybody so that's where as what Cain left there and he went on up through to earth through a certain area there and they started their own church everything a man that's right and in that area it is said that when that when they when Noah came the grace of God ministry through Noah about the flood that says that they built a high tower they built it and built and built it because they felt they would expect the flood but it was serpent seed but they didn't escape it amen because they all gave themselves over to the devil amen he was the god of the world for them because Cain had refused the God that evil was worshiping he refused the revelation of God and to do what God wanted them to do they offer the the more excellent sacrifice he offered an excellent one and you got a serpent see today they're offering excellent sacrifices but not the more excellent Harry Marion but they they're they'll do take this and take that but God wants this Plus Plus this Plus this amen God reveals this this this and this amen because he's bringing us to more and more and more perfection a man but Cain Cain and his seed or they feel that all I got to do is I had a simple this and a similar bad faith you know and it's in their heads and in their flesh and maybe in their human spirit but they turned down this word they turned down that word in Luther's day well Thursday the Pentecostal age and in this age more and more turns on the word so that if you don't shorten time to be no flesh safe that's how serious it is well assistant if it's that serious that revelation on a makeup serious even if is that serious that revelation other drivers more and more simply humble ourselves to the grace of God nor do we need your unmerited favor Oh on their two favorite we need we don't deserve it Lord so it's Grace anybody it's your grace Lord your nature we need this we need this we need you anybody every step of the way lord grace brothers sister I mean even stopped to consider grace not I know and I don't mean intellectually but spiritually how many are experiencing Grace in their hearts and in their souls amen how many are aware that what I am I am by the grace of God oh it's Jesus yes but it's grace giving you the revelation it's great it's calling you to receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior that's grace amen all the father give me will come to me Jesus say all the father has given me will come to me and I will lose none of them well who's the father going to give him did the father give you the Jesus there's a lot of there that the father not given the Jesus if he said that there has to be many of there that are not saved yeah servants heat they are serpents eat religious some of them are but still serpents eat amen all the father give me will come to me and I will lose none of them very bad so the father didn't give him all to Jesus the father's given those in me for new that would have the seat of God in their hearts and in their souls a man and God would God would water that seed with his word and it would break a man and that she would break and would go up to produce the word the word the word Christ in a stove of glory hey man where others are going to take it into their heads because there's no seed in their heart see God knew God is God God knows all things he is omnipotent he all-knowing all-powerful and he omniscient all-knowing very bad so he knew who would be here today and he knows what's in your heart now hey man you know what's in your thoughts now you know was in control is that your thoughts in control or your heart is this your is it your senses your sight or is it your faith amen brother god help us that is faith in control and we live by faith and I'll tell you this the world don't understand that because you're going by faith we do therefore what do you do that for buddy what are you gonna do that point well as the Lord leads I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that amen it's the leadership of God he's in control amen as I said to that one time to a brother used to go here he had training in the college whatever for a certain job and I said he was he was saying old brother I can't find the job I can't find the job and I said what are you looking for he said this this this I said well I said why don't you go to the counter why did you go to the City Council see if they need a janitor he didn't like that no I don't want that I was well I go to find the will of God you know and I said he'll bless you in this if it's him only a janitor he'll bless you you'll meet your needs but people don't trust God that's the truth people don't believe in God people really don't trust him you know that that that if I do this God's going to bless if I do that God's got a blessing oh no I think I got to do this I gotta do this I gotta do it know what does God want you to do grace of God God Elvis what help us have that spirit he's turned the hearts of the children back to the father's and you know what they did when the Holy Ghost come they fellowshipped every day the route of the word and it reminds me we'll have communion make Sunday he meant and they did this they went from house to house to house to house we did that person we come to the message oh yeah and they sold all they had extra and give to the poor what yeah because why they weren't living for themselves - were living for Jesus anyway they weren't living for time there lived returning solo they had and they give to the poor give to this one that that need that one twenty they meant by the grace of God brother what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's the life of Christ in you hey man as Jesus said he's they got nowhere to lay my head we don't want to not many believers want to say that no Lord we don't do that amen if you're willing to do it you'll provide hey man brother amen god help us what is it it's grace it is the unmerited favor of God toward us God knows their attitudes God knows our spirits God knows what we feel we want in our flesh and so on and sometimes gotta put the test on you yeah just to see if you would do it of course that brother that told to go to the City Council I said it might need some of the drive drive there garbage truck and now so they left no they left maybe they should have stayed because their life that sort of blowing blowing apart still go to one of them still goes to church but but is it the will of God see people don't stop to consider in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct thy paths amen grace of God brother listen grace let me reference this hard to believe grace is first mentioned in Genesis six and eight that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord and Noah and again grace his last mentioned as I mentioned Dutton to thy service mentioned in Revelation the last chapter of Revelation and it's tremendous it begins by grace it ends with grace in revelation 22 where any said the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen a man it was Grace in the Garden of Eden it was grace down through the ages and now Grace in the end a man John crying grace grace for the elect of God a man those that would take their stand for the gospel for the truth all the way down through the church ages all the way down through the ages and when he finished it he said grace brother we need a grace in the beginning we need grace in the end we acknowledge the grace of God in the beginning we acknowledge the grace of God in the end we acknowledge that it is Grace that come from eternity to help us and grace is going to take us back to eternity amen brother how can they deny this okay how can they lay it aside I kind of just just lay it aside and let it become dusting in in their homes if they got him yeah there's like the I told you about the the youngster to winning to Grandma and Grandpa's house and found the Bible there and they found the pictures here and this one and this and dad or do you say what's just a scrapbook for the childhood scrapbook why because there was dust on the bible and in the bible there was all kinds of natural things papers notes not bible notes oh yeah and the child thought it was obscure there was that much stuck in the Bible brother there's one brother said to me that's not Greece I pray grace to him one time and he said oh we said I don't need to read my Bible I said why now he said I don't mean I don't need he said to read a message book he said I said why well he said I got a pastor and he said he's reading the Bible and easy he's doing the messages and so on I said yeah I said at the mouth of two or three witnesses let it be established so I should read you read the Bible to make sure it's us today at the Lord read the bottom my shorts it is written that's right yeah and a believer and a professing believer told me that Co insane that the world's getting oh yeah and again I guess I said there are those that feel that all I got to do is read a book or all I gotta do is listen to a tape and but again your pastors are Dana need you through the prophecy and he said you you'll live no higher than your pastor that's the truth and when it comes out I said it made me number times long time ago I said there are a lot of the Labor's that now there's not many like it even the even like this I said you know I said some believers you know when it comes to reading the message book they should start they just started at the last few pages per line because I that's all they're interested in I said it's the signs and wonders as all they're interested in is physical healing God meeting this physical need that physical need so I said that's where they should and I said and the same thing as they used to read the Bible and they skip or skip that verse yeah and they skip that chapter or that book whatever and the message oh just skip that paragraph yeah yeah just skip that page yeah things the Prophet is said about this things the Prophet said about that they want where is the grace of God in their lives to line up with the word and again I know that's why a number of people that wouldn't have brother Joe breach no way they said because there's something that I am a remark I made years ago I was it what it was and but actually the notes that I read that I thought I quoted the quotes that I quoted was that I received it from sister Fulcher and she's gone to hit the Lord now I received from her years ago because she agreed with what I was saying she this weather prophet said Amen she that's the truth and and I said it years ago when we're any Empire Avenue Church and then not long ago I received an email not very danke home and they said oh I hear you preach this and you preach that someone told me I said why after all these years they come back to condemn me for preaching that yeah amazing yeah and that uh I said Lord I said have mercy on help the grace of God amen brother god help us to have the revelation of grace and that humbles us in the presence of God it almost to the Word of God a man Lord it's your word that's the most important thing now is your word Lord am I in line with your word father am i making my calling and election sure by looking into the mirror of the word oh I need to wash my face I didn't do this I need to do that you know okay Lord yeah I need line up help me but again too many as they look into the mirror the word turn around go and they forget what they looked at and there's a lot of people rather they can come in and me listen to a sermon and preach and and service and everything forget everything boy they did whereas others ago the can't get it out of the heart did you get it in your head you brush it aside but if you get it in your heart can't get it away from can't get away from her brother so the grace of God Genesis Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord hey man Noah and yet he walked with God but he found grace in the eyes of the Lord now that's why Enoch walked with God and he found Grace and he was raptured a man and again in Revelation which says the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all as fish amazing that's what asked the way God finished it amen he began with grace and he ended with Grace's better if there's anything God don't want us to forget his grace in learning that will humble us is the revelation of the grace of God amen brother amen all of us could we recognize that all that God has done and is doing for me and what I add by the grace of God oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord is grace grace thank you Jesus I'm not working but you did it thank you consider what Jesus did for you consider what Jesus suffered for you consider the pain and the agony and the sorrow that he endured for your salvation for the elects a brother then you want to die for him grace the Bible mentions the word grace 159 times amen in the messages of the Prophet listen from one 1947 to 1965 he referenced grace the grace of God three thousand four hundred and seventeen times amen from 1960 alone to 1965 as he got in did begin to get into the opening of the word concerning the Jews concerning the church ages not into the seals and the mystery of God the rapture oh yes there was a lot of emphasis on the rapture sixty to sixty-five by the grace of God and he emphasized grace from 1960 to sixty-five he touched on grace he emphasized grace amen one thousand six hundred and eight times sixteen hundred and eight times he mentioned grace the grace of God a man by grace through faith we are saved and concerning faith it is in the Bible 231 times amen the Prophet made reference to it from 1947 to 1965 twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty four times he mentioned faith faith old brother and from 1960 to sixty-five he mentioned faith he highlighted faith five thousand and fifty six times almost at the time that he mentioned it in his entire ministry amen he put the emphasis on grace grace grace lord help us because it is by grace through faith that we are saved bear with me didn't realize that was this long but again 20 minutes of anointed preaching there's like eight hours of hard but I call it the sledgehammer work how many hours have I spent with the sledgehammer amen with the word by the grace of Almighty God amen just for share with you a couple of scriptures we know that the Ephesians one is similar to by grace are you saved through faith and that's not of yourself it's the gift of God and if God gave us such a gift to get us out of time take us away from hell get us into the kingdom of God how much ought we to show to appreciate it and love you all my brother sister people people do less for one another and they're and they're loved and must do we love God oh that one did this for me that one did that for me oh I love them I would loving God God did more for us than anyone could ever do that's right so it is by grace through faith were saved not of yourselves it is the gift of God and we've been created in christ jesus on to good works amen so his grasing active in your life not so saving you but as let your actions speak louder than your words amen and he said also said in the word be there for followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also had loved us and has given himself an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour but he said fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting now God got nothing against a little bit of humor prophecy even God had humor yeah but not we don't give ourselves over to the foolish jesting and and and foolish talking of the world no so nor foolish talking and nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this she know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of God out of Christ and of God let no man deceive you with vain words they men for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience again is not what you did it's what you didn't do and a lot of believers are guilty not of doing this doing this is what they didn't do amen be be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth the fruit of the Spirit in your life is goodness righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable under the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them a man and a man I just read one other scripture there it says he given more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but he giveth grace unto the humble are you humble I trust by grace that the revelation that you were a sinner in need of salvation completely that umbels you to our Lord Jesus Christ and he giveth grace unto the humble you got to have a right spirit and right attitude when you come to the Lord amen in the message on the message of race he said I know there is a God I know that Jesus Christ is the son of God Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people today in the form of the Holy Spirit and I know that he the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh when signs and wonders are appearing and we just got through the seventh search ages learning that we are in the last and lauda see and search each will we're in the bright age now thank God and he said and when the church would be indifferent get cold dominate and be organized organization was at which organizations would take it over and eat it up but a promise that there would be a little remnant left there would be a church that will be scattered abroad everywhere but God would gather it together and rapture it into glory and he said the other day when I got Daniel seventy week standing right here the pulpit he said something struck me and he said I've never been able to get away from it see to see the hour that we are living in and that's the affected that I'm brother Brennan to see what he saw because he saw more than you and me as a prophet and he said there's a lot of things he knows he said it'll be in my heart he said when I go to my grave he knew he was going you know so if he saw and and it struck him and they were very serious in fact it got to the place where he said hey I think I'm losing my mind how many are going to let the word take control that much people avoid it Oh even lose your mind good we need the news that when it comes to the world and the things of the world he so that struck me and I have never been able to get away from it to see the hour that we are living in I want to go somewhere and do something else and he said I've got too many loved ones that's unseen knowing what can I do to get them saved and he said we got to plead the token for them in another message and he said and still the world is getting worse and then I have to remember that we are living in the loudest C an age where they will get worse a man it said they would get worse and then I chose this morning he said being that the message was so attacked yeah but he preached the people were attacking he said another thing that I think I am gotten after about is preaching grace because he began to realize we needed the revelation of grace and we needed more grace because of the condition of the world we needed the grace of God to help us strengthen us and encourage us amen and brother again we need the grace of God for the brothers and sisters in need the repair requests that went over the pulpit today God Elvis brother yes there's not one of us here without a need we need grace but you know testimony of grace is humility your humble God helpers and brother BAM read the scripture that I started with some time ago Zechariah and he said this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts and he said the message will not come by some great mites of power but by the Spirit of God and he said to zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone there are with shoutings crying grace grace grace unto it grace grace grace unto it he said I want you to put on your spiritual thinking a man I want you to put on your anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince determined he said to rebuild the house of the Lord and then he said what he did he laid the foundation stone and have you noticed he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone a man and brother the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father's in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the Holy Spirit and he said it's by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last day I trust that you're under the control of the Holy Ghost that's right the Holy Ghost controls you what you do you do by the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your heart and so the conviction of the Holy Ghost he can control you not there - you know sometimes just to do this do this yeah no no we get too far out of place and he got a stamp on us no no that he's there in control by the grace of God he said when you've done all the stand staying put on the whole armour of God amen brother Matthew mentioned in this prayer less service I think it's all in the front but not in the back the probably God warned us about attacking her brother from the back he did and he said you do that he said in the eyes of God you're guilty of murder brother I tell you grace grace keeps your attitude right your spirit right your motives your objectives all mine that's right to give brother-sister listen again that's why the angel told the Prophet be careful don't don't conduct column Rickey's Erekat us and that woman out there doing this way she's dressed well don't condemn her condemned that thing but pray the grace of God to her okay there was you but for the grace of God amen praise the Lord it's like the woman's Jesus met at the well everybody condemned her that's right but Jesus went and brought it what was in her most would bring out the natural thing that was in her but Jesus knew there was a spiritual seed in there she right away when when he testified to her by the word she recognized it oh you're the Christ you're the Messiah and then she took off into the city and began to witness to everybody she ran around and around and around whoa Messiah he's over here so finally they said well we don't believe you now we believe can be seen it ourselves and really where were they on the day he was crucified a lot of those people that were when he came in on the on the donkey and they all screaming and oh praise the Lord hallelujah King of Kings and so on all that none David rebuked him and he said they older piece the rocks are crammed yeah where were they when he was crucified brother where are they now where's the seed of God now in this hour when God is looking for the bride that is one with him one with his word listen I can't read it all grace of God he's now according to the prophecy there will come the headstone and he has come and I want you to notice that when the headstone comes the Prince that's going to carry out of the message will cry grace grace anything we're gonna cry as grace there's grace that's bringing us to where we are giving us what we have when it comes to the revelation of the word grace is going to keep emphasizing resurrection rapture grace kept emphasizing justification for Luther sanctification for Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts of the spiritual Pentecostals now the Spirit is going to continue the grace of God's going to magnify in the grace of God to us yeah it's great now why the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all because after all is said and done come to an end we need grace to get to go from time to eternity he said we're good the Prince that's going to cry out the message will cry grace grace for it's by grace are we saved not a works lest any man should boast and the message of grace has been tramped under feet to min until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into it eternal security some runs into everything but the true message of grace remains the same we are sinners saved by grace it's simple and it's humble amen so in the deity of Jesus Christ the Lord Cain could come there and confirm that this is the truth we are saved by grace through faith not by works work shows that you have been saying but what saves you is the grace of God work shows that you have been saved well what saves you as the grace of God grace saves you grace is what God does for you grace is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you amen and he says some people think I joined the church you believe this you believe that it's grace he said I am nothing to love come see him which is Grace and he says you can do all these things and still be lost and he says it's grace that saves you God's grace to the human race amen well one finished the quotes I'll just give you another quote or two Father God said it I thought of the grace of God and how he could do that to save to the uttermost and to give me grace I thought oh it's amazing grace and then come to me degraded no squirrel hunter out into the woods and he said from himself in the form of the rainbow he said which means the Covenant with a message that he gave me to preach and form it there in a covenant that he's behind it and he'll be behind it because the messages of Jesus Christ and His glory it's the Spirit of God that confirms the word and he said listen he said the simplicity is believing God amen and he said it takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into the present tense and he said amen if it taken theology what would the Presbyterian methodist Baptist Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance us poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge not by power not nor by might but only by my spirit sent the Lord he said I'll unfold this mystery and he'll cry to it grace grace with shoutings and crimes he said that's what it is today it is God's Amazing Grace to his people how he takes the illiterate he takes the unlearn that shows that Jesus is the same and he's crying grace grace grace the message of old is Grace brother sister were here because of grace please humble ourselves as sons and daughters of God and that will mature as sons and daughters of God he said grace his old Grace's as old as the world is grace was first shown to the human race when he had a beginning of the human race that's right when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when that little woman that stepped across the separating line and had gone against God's commandments enticed her husband to do the same the law must have a penalty or it's no law and the law was the day you eat thereof the day you surely die remember the first judgement seat was upon the earth and it was in the Garden of Eden and the last judgement seat will be upon the earth at the end time it's the white throne and brother this is an hour of judgment that we're living in it is we could preach the message I could talk on the message again on the indictment he's I indict this man this this world he indicted the world he indicted the churches he indicted individuals for the crucifixion of the word not today there are believers who have crucified the word and his believers today who are crucifying the way they didn't want the word to have controlled their lives that were that part that part that part oh I just believed this doctrine this doctrine is done but I don't have to do this I don't have to do that amazing God's grace the last judgement seat upon the earth at the end time and he says the white throne grace of God to us in this our brother as it were before the way thrown by the grace of God we are saved and kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last days amen thank God I pray grace grace grace to have more and more and more control of our lives amen door bless you disdain this law just started Amen let's saying love lifted me I was sinking deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore very deeply stained within sinking to rise no more that's right but by grace the master of the sea heard my despairing cry thank you Jesus and from the waters he lifted me now safe and I hallelujah grace grace grace we consider our flesh and the strength of the things that the Satan is using in the flesh brother's grace that we can keep our eyes on the Lord and stay with the Word of God amen and it's grace that when we sin we have an advocate we have a mercy seat Jesus Christ sir aegis amen and if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness god help us God blesses the whole in the spirit live in the spirit that the Holy Ghost have control amen don't

hearts then then that's diametrically opposed to faith all right so he's undermining our faith by doing that so if you look at and put up the chorus first brother and then we're going to reverses
