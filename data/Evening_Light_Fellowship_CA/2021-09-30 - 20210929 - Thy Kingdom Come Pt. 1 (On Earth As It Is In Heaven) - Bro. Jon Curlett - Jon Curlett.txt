resting this evening lord on your word we're resting on the promise that where two or three were gathered in your name there you be in our midst lord we're resting on the promised lord that you would never leave or forsake us even to the end of the age and lord we're inviting you to just take lord full control of this service lord as we've come and we've worshipped and praised and prepared and opened our hearts lord now we pray that you would do your part lord that you have put a little more of you inside of us lord that you kick a little more of us out lord that christ would be fully reflected in our lives lord that we would be a witness in the testimony of your goodness and grace lord of the peace and joy and love that we sang lord that we would just be as gold or that's been refined in the fire lord as we sung about lord minister now to your people we pray or bless us forgive us lord lord we fall so short so often lord forgive us lord help us to do better give us another chance we pray lord god lord many sick out tonight we pray you just go and minister to them each one lord to those that are traveling lord and lord just by way of hook up lord we pray that you would just minister to them each one where they are lord we give this now to you in jesus christ's name we're praying it amen amen god bless you thank you musicians that'll be it this evening amen if you'll turn in the scriptures to matthew chapter 6 and then matthew chapter 6 we we start a new series tonight i don't know if anybody's excited about it but we're going to start a new series i'm excited about it and a little nervous amen matthew chapter 6 immense good to have the the right side loaded up here tonight i i expect great things from the right side of the church and uh the left side it's uh the left side you guys are going to have some heavy lifting to do here tonight but amen we can do all things through christ which strengthens us amen matthew 6 very familiar scripture it says after this manner therefore pray ye this is jesus speaking our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen you can have your seats this evening may god bless the reading of his word like i said i want to start a new series here tonight and this has been on my heart it's it's kind of tough when you're preaching this a series but you know that it's got to end and so you're looking for the mind of the lord and you're praying and dwelling on things and you're getting pieces here and there and it's kind of only just in the last couple of weeks maybe the last month that it started to form a bit of a picture and i'm in anticipation for this i'm a little nervous this is going to be very practical it's going to be very personal and any time it gets personal it always gets awkward amen and and the thing is that some of our some of our things that uh that we are and the way we are is very outward and so when the minister starts speaking you can think that he's preaching to you and guess what sometimes he is amen but usually he's speaking to himself and god has dealt with him on it and those sorts of things so this shouldn't be an uncomfortable service here today but i guarantee you there will be moments of uncomfortableness in the next few months by god's grace amen but if i step on your toes then just know that he stepped on mind probably before he stepped on your yours amen it's like i said it's going to be very practical we'll be getting down into our day-to-day lives into the very core of our being what we do how we spend our time uh what we're building on this earth you know the way that we reflect christ and and the words we say the things we do the images we project uh the reputation we develop all of these things we're going to be digging deep into that amen but maybe an interesting way to start it is with the lord's prayer and i want to take from that a series called thy kingdom come and i want to preach tonight on on earth as it is in heaven amen now let's go back to the scriptures and if you'll hold your place there in matthew but i'm going to go to luke 11 because luke 11 tells us why jesus gave this prayer amen he's going to this is this is why he he went into this and and it says in luke 11 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples amen so the reason that jesus comes and gives us the lord's prayer somebody comes and says lord we see you praying how do you do it tell us how you do it teach us how to talk to god they said john came the prophets came and and and they taught their disciples but now you're here and we want to know how it is that you have effective communication with god we want to know how it is that you approach god we want to know how it is that you go before god how your relationship is there show us how to do it so that we can have the same effect with our prayer life as you seem to have with yours and then there's a desire in their heart there to see what in their life what they saw with jesus amen so we're praying people amen we're praying people as believers as christians we're a praying people and so we ought to be able to fit our prayers within the prayer that jesus gives us here amen so if we go to matthew 6 and verse 9 says after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name and we're going to spend the next half of the service on just this this portion here there's so much in here it's so deep but i want to start with the first bit and it says our father because the the the basis of prayer is always relationship amen that you have to know that you are talking to somebody that is related to you that has made you a relation to him that he is your father that he is not just somebody else's father but he is your father that he is your god and you're coming to him because you are a child of his amen you call him father because you are his child you cannot call him father if you are somebody else's child amen so the first the first approach is always on the basis of relationship and that he is yours and not just somebody else's but then he says what which art in heaven now this is our father but it's looking and it's showing the sovereignty of god and his position in relation to ours as we sit here on this earth and that's that he is in a position of control he is in a position of authority he's in a position of sovereignty that is above where we are right now amen we are down here and he is up there and this is a submissive admission that he is your god and not just your father amen that he is the one that you answer to and he is the one you look to and he is the one that you're going to put in the highest place of preeminence in your life amen in heaven is where he reigns amen but the other thing i want you to catch here is that our relationship because he is in heaven is going to be in the heavenlies amen it is going to be supernatural it is going to be spiritual it is not going to be a physical relation such as we have on here with the people around us that doesn't mean you can't have a physical relationship in that you can feel them with your five senses that you can't talk to them through your inner five senses and these different things but rather this is still a relationship that is not the same as what you have here on this earth that you do not connect to him you do not touch him the way that you touch him and connect with somebody here but it is through a heavenly relationship that you're going to be contacting him amen but he says now after that he says hallowed be thy name and this is where we get into the crux of why we pray this way that word hallow means keep holy to separate from profane things and dedicate to god to consecrate to sanctify and to purify so what he's saying here is our prayer should be lord keep your name holy keep your name pure keep your name separate from sinful and ungodly things now why is that so important why do we need to pray to god to keep his name clean and why are we so concerned about it why is that something we should be praying it seems like that should be god's problem not our problem amen i don't go around telling you to keep my name clean i'm responsible for my own name aren't i amen and brother ali is responsible for his name and brother bob's for his name or brother mark's for his name i don't go around saying brother mark let me keep your name clean brother mark keep your name clean that's not my prayer my prayer is lord keep me clean amen and he takes care of his name and his family and i keep care of my name and my family amen but before we can understand why we have to pray lord keep your name holy we have to understand what that name is and why it's important and then so if we go back to john 5 the question that you want to ask here is what is the father's name what is the name of god if you went and asked that in denominations today you get a lot of different answers right they'd say his name is jehovah and they go into the redemptive names of of god and they they go into yahweh and yeshua and all these different things you get all these sort of different answers but we have to go to the scripture to say what is god's name so john 5 39 says search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me but ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honor from men but i know you that you have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name jesus comes in his father's name and you receive me not and if another shall come in his own name him will ye receive philippians 2 10 says that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in earth and of things under the earth colossians 3 17 says and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him amen so what is the name of jesus what is the name of god the name of god is jesus it has to be because jesus said i come in my father's name and everything that we do after jesus comes is in the name of jesus now god will not share his glory with anyone else god will not put somebody else ahead of him so if he's saying to do everything in my name that has to be the name of god i'm in the name of god is jesus brother brahm says this he says god put his name in jesus brother matt thanks for getting this all worked out it's working beautifully thank you i appreciate it god put his name in jesus do you believe that he was the son of god and every son comes in his father's name he said i come in my father's name and you receive me not i come in my father's name you come in your father's name amen we have people that are coming in the colombo name we have people that are coming in the coffee name we have people that are coming in the curlet name right each one of us comes in the name of what our father and he says jesus is no different jesus come in his father's name so his father's name is jesus amen that's the only thing that we identify god with amen so you say okay we pray that jesus name will be kept pure holy and undefiled but jesus name is already pure holy and undefiled why are we having to pray for jesus name to be hallowed for it to be holy for it to be kept separate and clean and pure in these different things but remember he didn't say hallowed be thou he said hallow be thy name amen there's something attached to his name there's something identified with his name that has to be kept holy there's something attached to his name that has to be kept clean there's something attached to his name that has to be kept pure and it's something that we have to keep in prayer in order to keep it that way if i can put it that way let's see if we dig deeper into the scriptures here i'm just setting a foundation tonight this will be more teaching than anything just setting a foundation for where we'll go over the next few months and then we're looking at what is god's name and why does something have to be kept holy that's attached to god's name first kings 9 it says and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord in the king's house and all solomon's desire which he was pleased to do that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and the supplication that thou has made before me now watch what he says here and i have hallowed this house this is solomon's temple he's built this is the greatest temple ever built in the jewish history he says i have hallowed this house which thou has built to put my name there forever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be thou permanent perpetually so solomon had built a permanent home for god to dwell in remember before this he dwelt in tents and tabernacles made of skin and cloth and all these different things but solomon comes and he takes all the materials that david have pulled together he gets more from his allies and he builds this beautiful tent out of or this beautiful temple out of stone and cedar wood and he has it overlaid with gold and all these precious things and he builds the most beautiful temple that the jews have ever seen amen and now god comes down after this is done he says i am so pleased with what you've done now why was he why was he pleased with it he was pleased with it because it was built according to the order that god had given moses in the first place moses did not build a temple of his way of his thinking of his preference but he built it according to the standard that god had given moses for the temple in the wilderness and the difference was he built it out of something permanent stone rather than something that could be lifted up and taken and moved day by day amen but he built it according to the the blueprint of god and god says i'm pleased with it because you've done it the way i told you and you did it out of your own heart's desire that i didn't force you to do it but rather you had a desire to build something for me in my blueprint and my pattern and he says i'm so happy with this that i'm going to put my name on this temple and i'm going to let it be known that this is the place where you can worship me this is the place where you can find me this is the place where i will be anytime you need to come get me remember they could turn their eyes at any time towards jerusalem and that temple and they could hear from god he said that's all they had to do was look to where he had put his name he's identified himself now with this temple amen now god's so pleased with it he says you built it he says but i have hallowed it i have made it how holy how did he make it holy it wasn't when he put his name there it was when he put his presence there and that's what allowed him to put his name there amen at our houses sometimes you see somebody that has a a name on their mailbox so they put a plaque on their house and says you know the curlettes the coffees the columbos and that identifies who's in that building and you know that if you go to that building and knock on the door who's going to answer a coffee a columbo or a curlet based on the name that's on the house and this is no different here amen that he's put his name there and said if you come knock on the door i'll answer you i'm going to dwell in this place amen the shekinah glory went behind the veil in there and if you remember when they when they when they dedicated that building the power of god came down so great that they couldn't even speak amen it was so powerful that the people were mute before the presence of god and then the holy spirit came down and that cloud came down remember it was an amazing time because they built it the way he wanted it built and he was pleased to come down and show himself and the people amen but if we look as the scripture continues that there are conditions to god keeping his name there right it's not just i'm going to put my name there and it'll be there perpetually but if we look at verse 4 god starts to put some conditions on this because god's admonition to solomon is not just keep the temple pure but his admonition to solomon is solomon you've got a house to build now and you've got a kingdom you're trying to build and you've got a family to raise and you've got things you want to do and he's saying i want to dwell there as well i don't just want to dwell in the temple but i've got to dwell in the rest of your life as well you can't just put me in a box over here but solomon there's things you've got to do in your life to keep me in a place of worship that you have access to verse 4 says and if amen here's the condition if thou walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness and do according to all that i have commanded thee and will keep my statutes and my judgments then in programming we have an if then statement right if you do this then then something else happens then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel forever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel he says you can always stay in authority and kingship in israel if you'll follow the word if you'll serve me as your father serve me then your name will never leave the throne and if solomon had obeyed it they would still be on the throne today amen he says but if you shall turn at all from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and sower other gods and worship them then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them now it's not just solomon that's affected it's everybody that's under his authority is affected i want you to catch that it's going to be key as we move through everyone under authority of failed leadership gets pulled to the side then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight doesn't matter that's in my pattern if you're not serving me i'm not going to be in your midst that's what he's saying and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people in other words you guys will be has-beens you had it and you lost it and now it's no longer with you and you don't have a way back to get it amen what he's saying is he's saying solomon the temple's great i love this i love the temple i appreciate it thank you for the temple but i'm more concerned about the temple that you're building amen i'm more concerned about the kingdom that you're building and whether or not you'll serve me than i am about this beautiful temple that you've built me amen but he says if you'll stay with the word i'll be there for your praise i'll be there for your worship i'll be there for your prayer i'll be there for your need i'll be there for your defense i'll be there for your victory i'll be there for your strength i'll be there for your encouragement i'll be there for your joy i'll be in the midst of all of you if you will stay with the word but if you don't then you'll be a has-been it's that it'll be as if you never had me in the first place that's a scary place to be having tasted of the heavenly gift amen but not able to renew yourself unto repentance again amen amen so we see there is a place where god puts his name so this is we go to the old testament to see the type and shadow right and then we'll go into the new testament to see the fulfillment of that in a different way man but there's a place where god puts his name and it's a place of worship it's a place of sanctuary remember you could go in and lay hold on the horns of the altar and they could not take you out and they could not touch you unless you had shed innocent blood otherwise you could stay in there and they couldn't take you out amen it's a place of rest it's a place of direction it's a place of leadership amen but it's reliant on whether the life you're living is in accordance with the word of god amen what is it god's saying i'll put my name wherever i am giving full and complete preeminence that's what he's looking for amen and we know that eventually solomon failed why did solomon fail solomon failed when he tried to build the kingdom according to the way everyone else built the kingdom when he started taking on alliances to strengthen the kingdom and what did that do that caused strange marriages with women that did not serve god and they turned his head from what worship eventually he allowed them to worship their way in his house and that eventually caused him to do the things that he shouldn't be doing he allowed what strange gods in he allowed strange beliefs he allowed strange doctrines he allowed different influences he allowed political alliances he allowed things from the outside world to come in and start to dictate the way he lived his life and it eventually it pulled him off of the word of god amen and what happened after he dies god destroys his kingdom and then it splits up because his son decides to listen to young counselors instead of wise counselors and he says you know they whipped you with this but i'm going to whip you with scorpions and these different things and he listens to young hotbloods that thought they knew something rather than the wise elders if you remember and so what the kingdom split off them they said you can't be king so now you've got rhea bowman jeroboam believe and then from there it just declines steadily and one's going into slavery and then the next one's conquered and they're fighting themselves half the time and the kingdom eventually splits into one big mess they go into slavery they get pulled back eventually they rebuild the temple but they never get the glory back that they had in those days amen god was still in the temple when they rebuilt it but it was not in the way it was before and it was this constant back and forth this up and down in their life amen and that goes all the way until jesus comes on earth and then jesus comes on earth and he meets the woman at the well in samaria and they start talking about worship and where we can meet god now listen to this this is john 4 it says this is a woman at the well speaking she says our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship why because he said that's the place that i'm putting my name and if you turn towards that temple and pray i'll hear you so she says you say we've got to pray in jerusalem we have prayed on this mountain she says who's right and jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what and we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is that the true worship when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him amen in other words time is changing now is a time of change he says the time is coming and now is this is a time of transition of worship this is a time of transition of where i've put my name he says it's someplace else even now and when when in the in the very short term it's going to move even from there and it won't matter where you are something else is going to be where his name is and you're going to have to know where that name is because that's the only way you can worship him is if you know where his name is he says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth in contrast rather than in a temple made with stone what he's saying is you don't now get to worship because you came to the place where i am now there's going to be a requirement of you and it's that you worship me in spirit and in truth you've got to have a life and you've got to have it right there's two things you can't just have it right if you have the spirit you'll get it right but if you don't have the spirit you'll still get it wrong even if you think you know what's right amen amen so then christ comes and he dies and we get a full transition don't we because the what happens in the temple is the veil is torn from top to bottom showing that god had torn the veil not a man and that what ichabod was written over the door of the tabernacle now the glory of the god is departed and now there's no shekinah glory in the temple now what happens after that the priests go and they sew that curtain right back up and they go on pretending that the presence of god is behind the veil stone but guess what the man is no longer fresh they had to lie for hundreds and thousands of years they're still lying today the temple's not there but until the temple was destroyed they had to lie about the presence of god being in that temple because when they went back there there was no fresh mana anymore it had rotted there was no budding blossom almond almond rod there anymore right because remember in that presence the manna always stayed fresh and the almonds always budded didn't they they went back there and it was now a dried stick and a rotted maggoty mess that they would have had to clean out after a couple days after a day 24 hours after that 24 hours then they would have had maggots in the manna in there because there was a pot inside of the holy of holies remember right what is it teaching us don't pretend god's in your life amen if the if what you're getting is maggoty and messed up don't pretend that god's there go find where his name is supposed to be and that's where you'll find the place of worship amen you better know that he's in your life don't be sewing up something that's ripped up and say he's still there don't pretend i can't imagine what that meant to the young men that were in the priesthood then and they got to go in for the first time into what they felt was going to be the shekinah glory and it was nothing like the book of moses said it was supposed to be there was no presence there was no ah there was no fresh manna there was no almonds there was nothing it was dead back there and the priesthood had been lying to them the entire time about it can you imagine you get behind there and you realize god's not even here anymore what would that have done what would that have done to you amen amen what happened what god's name was in a temple building but then it moved into what a temple of flesh what did jesus say he says destroy this temple where was the name in this temple it says destroy this temple and i'll raise it up again in three days amen it moved into a temple of flesh and so when jesus christ walked the earth what happened god took his name off of a temple of stone and put it in a temple of flesh and that was god's name and you had to worship there but what happens when he leaves amen god was in a man's body but then christ dies where does the name go because he always has a place on earth for his name there's got to be a place look at the words in gethsemane when jesus is praying john 17 9 says i pray for them he's praying for us here i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom now has given me that they may be one as we are he says while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name that those that thou gave us me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves what was jesus joy scripture says he says my meat is to do that which the father sent me to do to do the father's will he says i want them to have joy in them the way i have joy in me the same thing he says now i come to thee and these i speak these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world had hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from evil remember what the scriptures what we said hallowed be thy name keep your name holy keep it clean keep it pure he says they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth and then he says thy word is truth as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they might also be sanctified made pure clean holy fit for service through the truth he says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word there's a work coming and they're going to bring more people to him just as he brought them to god amen that they may all that they all may be one as thou father are to me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me me there's a personal pronoun there he says that they may also be one in us that what the world may believe that thou has sent me amen they're gonna believe that christ came because of what we do he says and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one what's he doing jesus is teaching us to pray and he's saying lord god hallow your name sanctify your name make your name holy make your name separate make your name clean and then he comes along in the garden of gethsemane he says god i've kept your predestinated children in your name now sanctify them clean them up so they can serve you like i do and then they'll do it through the word that i've given them that's how he's going to keep his name clean but he's telling us pray that the name gets kept clean what in you right you're the one that has to be kept clean you're identified with his name you're identified with christ amen so you're the one that's got to pray that you don't make his name look bad because when people look at us they identify what that jesus has been with us amen that we profess christ and so we're identified with them so he says you've got to keep yourself under prayer that your life will be the reflection of him the way mine is in the exact same way what is it jesus leaves the earth and on the day of pentecost god puts his name in flesh once again amen what is it we do not replace jesus christ we are not a replacement catch that we do not replace christ we do not take that position in our lives amen but we get his name we get his name we are not him in the sense that we replace him but we are a portion of him amen we are a reflection of him as we'll see in a little bit amen he puts his quickening power inside of us and paul says we're now baptized into christ so we are him in the sense that we are a part of him but we are not everything of him amen he's the head and we are the rest if we can put it that way amen like we said before in the last series amen we go to him we are joined to him and he adds us to the body we've got to come to christ and then he places us within the body by the holy spirit paul says this in ephesians 3 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so there you are there we're named there's where the name is now is in us the name is in us and we're the reflection that has to be kept holy and clean and pure amen amen you are bone of his bone and your flesh of his flesh you're a new creation you're a new creature in christ here he says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now the inner where is the inner veil amen it's the holy of holies in the temple he says you got to have that strength you got to have that presence in your holy of holies so you have strength to live out the life that you have need of to purely reflect christ's name amen he says why that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith and that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god remember he said lord put the glory and then that i had this is what he's saying he's saying this process this new creation that you become is to exactly do that is to express the fullness of god through a multi-member body called the bride and you've got to be able to reflect that on a day-by-day basis not just sunday and wednesday when we come to church but in everything that we do and say we want to be filled with the fullness of god so that that's what's being reflected and lived out inside of us amen amen so if we're filled with the fullness i'm guaranteeing you then the name comes with the fullness doesn't it and then the fullness in my family is going to be in is going to be reflected in my wife amen her and i together are the fullness of colette amen amen me without her is not is not complete and her without i am not complete i mean together we are the fullness the bride and the groom together is the fullness of god amen and we'll get into that a little deeper as we move further into the series brother or brother he is a brother brother paul says in first corinthians know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you notice they keep saying temple temple temple they don't say this for no good reason why doesn't he just say house why doesn't he say tent why doesn't he just say dwelling place but they always say temple because he's pointing you back to god put his name in a temple and it was identified as a temple every time whether it was the tabernacle in the wilderness whether it was in christ who called himself a temple now paul says you're a temple in the same way because he puts his name in a temple every time and now it's in a temple of flesh inside of us amen that's why paul calls us temples is because it's a place dedicated to doing what worshiping god that's what a temple is it was a meeting place for god it was a place to worship god it was a place to give god praise and honor and glory amen ephesians 2 says for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works created in him unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them here's a beautiful thing he's got a plan for everything that we're going to do every good work we're going to do good meaning it's of god he's got it planned out so there's something waiting for every one of us whether we realize it or not he's got a plan of good things of good works for us to do wherefore remember that ye been in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands the jews said you're not a part of this is is what he's saying that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ ye who were sometimes who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who has made both one and had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain which is of two one new man he says i'm gonna make in myself what i'm gonna take one here and i'm gonna take one there and i'm gonna put them together and we're gonna be one again as we were in the beginning that's what he's taking us back to what do we have we have a bride and we have a bridegroom we have christ and mrs jesus christ coming together he says i'm going to make a new man out of all of this amen a new creation he says in doing so i'll be making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them which were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father he says now therefore ye are no more strangers and for foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god the temple of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord and in whom ye also are builded together for inhabitation of god through the spirit amen amen so where are we that we should be called by his name we're in christ and so paul says you've got to be in christ and when you're in christ you have christ's name it's not just that we come in he comes into us by the holy spirit but that holy spirit is what brings us into him really we're not two entities now we're one entity we're in him the same life the same spirit the same influence the same mind all these different things going through us as it is in him and that's what makes us one amen is we've got the same thing that's driving our lives inside of us brother brahm says this he says all things was given to christ and all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church and in that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father of me and i in you and then he says all the privilege that the believer has if they could only accept it listen you are a co you are a joint heir you are co-heir with christ that's what he's saying you're one with him what he has you have what he has authority over you have authority over but he has power over you have power over whatever he has strength for you have strength for amen amen everything that he has is available to you amen why because he's added you in under his name and you're a part of him now stephen when he's talking to his test to his accusers before they stone him he says listen god isn't dwelling in the temple in jerusalem anymore now he wasn't rubbing it in their face he was letting them know that he knew he was letting them know i know you've been behind the holy of holies and he's not there anymore and i'm confirming to you that he's moved on to someplace else and you better figure out where he moved on to because your worship is dead right now because you're worshiping in a place where god hasn't put his name and his presence is no longer there he says this he says but solomon built him a house we read about it he says howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me and this is where we're going with this series is what house will you build me what house are you building and what house are you trying to build and does the pattern that you're building match the pattern that god has laid out for every aspect of your life he says what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest now we want to put a balance here amen because people don't come to us to receive salvation they have to come to christ amen remember a woman doesn't bring forth she receives life and then she manifests it out amen but she does not create life but she manifests it she brings what is placed in her and brings out more than what was put in she multiplies what is put into her and brings it out into into an amazing portion of life amen so you can't come to a woman to receive life you can only come to a woman to give life and the true church of christ only receives life from him amen and that means that the only life a true church a true wife of christ can bring forth is what his life over and over and over again so when we bring people to church we don't say come to church because we have to have the truth or we're right we say come to church so we can introduce you to christ because he's the one that gives us life amen amen if you come to church to get life you'll die because that's what a denomination is is they're saying come to us rather than come to him for life amen brother brahm says this he says church wherever you are what you belong to it makes no difference now it does make a difference he's not saying you can go stay in catholicism you know that that's not what he's saying here but he's saying the church you're in is not the defining factor here but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in christ not around christ not with christ you've got to be in christ or you're dead you can't live outside of him your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as men but when you deny the body the blood the word of jesus christ you're dead the minute you do it it's god's chosen place of worship this is where his name is exactly there is where he chose to put his name not in the church but in the son jesus christ that's why i kept saying we have to be in christ that's why paul said you're baptized into christ it's because you've got to be in him not just with him he says now notice safety lied only in the place of his choosing in his lamb and in the name of the lamb notice it was a male lamb a he not a her not a church she but his name not her name where he was going to meet the people was not in her name but in his name him the lamb now we say the church the great mighty church she did this and she did that she's weighed the storms we picked up in population we're great in numbers we don't say that here do we we're a mighty church she's a great thing but god never said anything about ashi he said him him is the meeting place the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her name anywhere he put his name in him that's why now listen to this all we must do our word or deed we must do it all in the name of jesus christ if we pray we got to pray in the name of jesus if we ask petition we've got to ask it in jesus name if we walk we walk in jesus name if we talk we talk in jesus name if we baptize we've got to baptize in the name of jesus christ for all that we do in word or indeed do it in the name of jesus christ so when he said hallowed be thy name this is what he's talking about is go this far to the point where your prayer is lord everything that i do let it be done in your name that your name would not be blasphemed that i wouldn't make what your name appeared dirty that i wouldn't make your name appear sinful that your name will be kept clean because everything that i do i'm doing in your name not doing it according to something else amen [Music] so as we read in this quote we want to do everything in our lives in the name of jesus christ amen so when we're doing something or when we're about to do something our question should be does this reflect the holiness of the name because that's the first thing that word hallow means is to keep it holy so what i'm about to do does it reflect the holiness of god that standard alone would probably have us stop doing half the things we do in our lives today does this make god look holy does this reflect the holiness of god or is this just something i want to do on my own that's a high standard isn't it god help us is right amen first peter 2 9 says but you this is us but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people we're weird we're different we better be different because we're serving a holy god and we're supposed to be reflecting him he says how is it that you're peculiar that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light we're supposed to be reflecting light not the darkness that we come out of amen remember a long time you see those people walking around with those bracelets that had wwjd on it and it represented what what would jesus do they weren't really thinking about it but it was a great sentiment and sometimes i think we ought to be wearing them because it will remind us is this exactly what jesus would be doing right now in this time that we're living in in the age that we're living in in the trials and tribulations we're facing in the in the time of the greatest deception is what i'm doing right now what jesus would be doing if he were here is this what he would be telling his disciples to do if he were here or am i just doing something of my own making amen what did jesus say he's saying pray that your life will match up to the life of jesus such that there will be a heavenly holiness and purity that is pleasing to god not self-pleasing but that it will please him this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell amen may he be pleased that we're doing something with the holy spirit that he gave us brother braham says this he says we are flesh and bone of him as long as we are the bride of christ do you believe that he says all right he died for us and we died to ourselves and are buried in his name that we would be no more of the world but in him of who of which both the family in heaven is named after jesus christ he says that's ephesians 1 21. he says for the family for both heaven and the family in heaven what's the family in heaven named jesus what's the name what's the family on earth named well that's the house of god where the blood's at is that right that's the door that's the gate that's a place where he put his name and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us not us now he says jesus he says now what does this look like you say now that's an interesting thing he says it's the word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what this looks like when you're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh it's the word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what he was when he was here he reflected the word for his age that's what moses was moses reflected the word for his age that's what jacob's was and that's what the rest of them was sparking off that word of god the reflector that god was reflecting himself so we are what a reflection we're supposed to be a reflection he says and come to that perfect image of god jesus christ god's masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflectors he says moses was in him joshua was in him and if you are in him you were in him before the foundation of the world the family of god catch this you suffered with him you died with him you went to the cross with him and you raised with him and now you're still with him sitting in heavenly places doing what reflecting the message of the age to the world the light of the world that's where we are amen that's why we've got to pray lord keep your name holy because his name is being reflected through us it's the only thing the world can see today and if we're getting it dirty by our own living then what happens the light is cloudy remember the scripture talks about it'll be neither dark nor light it'll be murky that's what happens when you get your life messed up like this amen the way what is it the way we operate the way we think our motives our objectives our actions our reactions are all supposed to be reflective of how god operates that's a tough call that's a tough standard that everything we do would be reflective of how god does it not how god wants but how god did it amen we can look to christ and see exactly what he did time and time again you can see him whether it was them making fun of him whether it was them rebuking him whether it was them putting them down whether it was them beating him spitting him on the face making fun of his gift whatever it was we see how he acted in every situation amen it's not that we don't have an example amen but notice here what brother braham says he says what reflecting the message of the age to the world so what is a reflection does a reflection add to itself can a reflection do anything to make itself more or less a reflection is merely an image of something else on a surface and all we can do is keep the surface clean right that's what we've got to do is keep the surface clean the image that's coming in is perfect the only thing that will mar the reflection is a flaw on the mirror on whatever surface it is so we've got to what he's saying is keep your mirror clean that's all we are we're a reflector he's saying keep the mirror clean so that the work can bounce off you cleanly you look at some of the things that they do in in in these these huge telescopes and they will polish these things to they have to polish them and clean them with lasers so that they can get a perfect reflection because they're looking so far into the universe that the slightest imperfection will warp the image and they'll get a bad image they've got to have a perfect reflector in there and they've got all these individual pieces and if one piece is not only flawed but out of position then the reflection is ruined for the entire image right the whole group has to be like this the whole set of mirrors we'd like to build just one big curved mirror but you can't do it so they build it in small pieces and they put it together that's what he's doing is he's building a small a group a big group of mirrors made of many small ones and what he's saying is all of those mirrors have to be clean and then they've got to be holy they've got to be separate amen that's what hallowed be thy name means we just spent 10 pages of notes telling you what hallowed be thy name means that's how deep this is okay this wasn't just some words that jesus said to pray this is the the depth of what he said here is incredible and we're only going to cover it for one service but when he says hallow be thy name that was our commitment that we would look to him to keep our lives clean to be a reflection of him every day of our lives amen verse 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy kingdom come whose kingdom the kingdom of our dreams of our anticipation of our skills of our education of our gifts no thy kingdom lord what you want done let that be what comes into our life let that be the thing that we're serving amen but what is the kingdom of god what is the kingdom of heaven because that's what he's talking about here thy kingdom it's got to be the kingdom of god in the kingdom of heaven because he's our father in heaven and he's god amen so those are both the same things what is the kingdom of heaven jesus said matthew 4 17 and from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand that means it's coming and it'll be here soon john 3 says there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews that same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him and jesus answered him answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god. so he says the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven is coming and then he says unless you're born again you can't see it you can't even understand the things of god you can't understand the way god operates you can't understand the way god structures things you can't understand the will or purpose of god none of this happens he says unless you're born again it's the only way to understand it's the only way to receive it is to be born again what does it mean to be born again you got to die and something else has to come out right an old life has to go down and the new life has to come up we know what that is we become a new creature in christ amen you have a new life and that life is the holy spirit god's own life inside of you that's the new birth amendment jesus says you cannot see it you can't understand anything about the kingdom of god unless you have the holy spirit that's a tremendous statement because you'll see people out there and they're handling the word without the holy spirit and they have no clue and the thing is they could have a clue about 99 but that one percent is what will destroy it why the mirror has to be perfect right it has to be clean clean not perfect clean i mean it's not perfection that's going to do this but there's got to be cleanliness to it amen and there's a cleanliness that comes by one thing and that's through the blood of jesus christ amen so what is being born again it's the experience of god living inside of you that he has changed you into something that you didn't used to be and that you never could be until he came into you brother braham says this he says christ had to die to make us all alive to quicken us is that right he says so it's only true no matter what church you belong to how many times you shook hands with the preacher how many names you got on the book or how many churches you belong to it doesn't mean that you've got to absolutely accept the death of jesus christ he says and not only that but you've got to die yourself you've got to die to every thought of the flesh so that you can receive the mind of christ and walk from henceforth not of your own but of his mind the mind of christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive stay alive it's got to be a continuous thing he says that's the only way i can stay alive all i live by is by the holy spirit what a statement can we say that all i live by is by the holy spirit that is a challenge my brothers and sisters all i live by is the holy spirit jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen and it's not by words that we live we have to take those words amen but we don't just talk a good talk we don't just preach a good sermon we don't just you know spew out doctrine and truth and this and that and the other thing but there's something else that has to follow those words amen matthew 7 21 jesus says not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven amen there's got to be a life there's got to be an action there's got to be an obedience to the word that comes with the receiving of that word because otherwise you never received it you just took it into your head and you didn't believe it enough you didn't have faith enough to put it into action you didn't believe the consequences of not doing it enough to do it brother brown says if you believe if you truly believed you do what he said but so often we don't because we don't truly believe it yet amen none of us are sitting here with all the faith to take it all let's not pretend that amen i'm not pretending it up here there's many things that i don't have the faith to claim yet amen but i believe it and i'm trusting him to bring the faith to allow me to step into it and make it a reality in my life amen amen so what is it the kingdom of heaven is entered by what doing the will of the one that controls the kingdom you can't be in the kingdom and be a willing subject if you're not doing what the king says from that kingdom and that's why you have to have the new birth is because that puts a king in your life that overrides everything that we would ever do or say amen that takes care of our desires it takes care of our thoughts it takes care of our actions it takes care of our reactions and brings them subject to the king that's in the throne of our heart amen so what is it jesus is saying when he's saying what thy kingdom come he's saying pray that the kingdom of god comes to you pray that the holy ghost comes to you pray that you actually get the opportunity for this amen but after that pray that you're a part of it pray that you're seeing it and pray that you're included in it amen thy kingdom come in me don't let it just come to brother bob but let it come to me don't let it just come to sister justine but let it come to me make sure you're a part of it not just seeing it not just affiliated with it but make sure you're in the kingdom with the others that are in the kingdom amen we don't get in by association it is a one-on-one relationship you don't get in because i'm filled with the holy ghost and i don't get in because you're filled with the holy ghost we each one have to have our portion amen we each one have our light that kingdom come and then he says thy will be done now we're getting to the crux of the matter amen thy will be done where's our will in this does anyone see anything about my will in that scripture no it says thy will be done let what you want be done in my life let what you believe to be the best thing be done in my life let my mind be subject to your mind let my heart be subject to your heart let my life be subject to what the word of god what did brother branham quote said scripture he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god but the brahman says this he says we find today that the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnanted to give birth to sons there's going to be two births happening one of them a denominational birth is going to be given one of these days at the world council of churches which will produce to the world the antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth i may not live to see it i believe i will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that will finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms that world council of churches and shall give birth to her son the antichrist so if satan's kingdom is producing an antichrist what does god's kingdom got to produce a christ he says the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride he says the body of christ isn't finished yet he says how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one why male and female created he him male and female created he then they were one to start and then they were divided and put into bodies amen he says it's the same thing we've been divided and now we've got to come back into oneness he says like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride is so sold out to him that she uses no mind of herma of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word you'll hear somebody say what the lord told me or god's will is such and such and if it doesn't line up with the word they are under another spirit and there's only one other spirit from the holy spirit and it is a denominational antichrist spirit now that sounds harsh but it's true and you can have the holy spirit and be under another spirit in portions of your life because why god's continually working on us pushing out the enemy and filling that up with his word but we're in a battle right now amen we're in a battle right now and the soul is sealed but everything else is still subject to what an antichrist spirit and so there's that battle going on back and forth and you've got to be subject in every area of your life to that holy spirit before we get out of here and so he's working in us to kick out the antichrist spirit in our life in that certain portion and replace it with the holy spirit to have full control over each and every one of us and you can't say it's not true because every day we do things we ought not to do and you didn't do it by the holy spirit so there was another spirit that had control of that area of your life amen so we want to do what in this series what we're going to be looking at is what is the spirit that's developing the kingdom in our life because kingdoms are built by spirits that's what you'll see that's what he's saying here there's what there's two bodies going to come out and one's going to be an antichrist and the other one's going to be the bride of christ there's something being built there's a kingdom being created here and based on the spirit that's on you that's what the kingdom's going to be in your life so you may have your marriage under perfect submission to the holy spirit but if your career is not then you're going to build a career that has a kingdom that looks like satan's not gods and you've got to understand what god's pattern looks like for a career versus what satan's looks like amen for your marriage for your ministry for your gifts for your family all of these different things how it all plays in man versus woman right god has a pattern for the way a man acts the way a man is god has a pattern for a way a woman looks in his and we're going to get into that what is the pattern in heaven because remember what thy kingdom come let the heavenly pattern be reflected in the earthly creature and the earthly creation and that's what's going to bring us into that fullness of the bride of christ amen is when what's in heaven the images in that's in heaven is reflected in our lives in every way amen that's a challenge to us i believe so what we say lord we pray we say lord i want such and such lord do this lord do that no he's saying by the end here our will will be 100 according to his word and so we won't be saying lord give me such and such we'll say lord your word says and i'm praying for your word i'm asking for your word i'm claiming your word because that's where my confidence lies amen but notice the order if we look at the scripture again he says thy kingdom come thy kingdom come means you've got to get the holy ghost first thy kingdom's got to come at me the holy ghost has to come in me when the holy ghost comes to me then i will pray thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen you won't be praying thy will correctly until the kingdoms come inside of you and the work has started the seed has been quickened and then from there now god something got something to build out of your life amen on earth as it is in heaven this is this is the the the inspiration for this entire series we're going to be doing is lord let what's on in heaven be reflected in earth let me subject everything that i do to what the heavenly pattern and then to the word pattern that's what we're talking about we don't have to go look to the unseen we've got it written here we've got the pattern here for every part of our life so if we can go in here and see the pattern then we can pray lord let me reflect the pattern i've been thinking these last few mornings just in prayer and and i've been thinking god because there were some things there were some changes i was looking for in my life and guess what it doesn't happen overnight does it but all of a sudden i started looking back and i started saying lord thank you for the victory because i looked back and all of a sudden i started seeing victory where there didn't used to be victory i started seeing the word made manifest where the word didn't used to be manifest where my personal flaws were my genetic makeup where the things i got from my mom things i got from my dad things i got from old complexes things i've got from what somebody said they were influencing me and i had to say lord this does not look like this amen and so i want the mirror to be fixed i want the mirror to be cleaned up and so lord help me to clean it up but i'm not saying lord let me clean it up i'm saying lord let you clean it up so i can reflect it because me cleaning it up just spreads the dirt around that's all that happens amen we don't have the the bleach amen but it's the blood of christ covering it it's the overcoming power of the holy spirit that starts moving and all he's looking for is a surrender vessel that says i need help that i've got a flaw i've got an unclean portion here that needs you and unless you come and take it i can't reflect you and i'm gonna struggle and your name is going to be blasphemed because i can't live the way you said i should live so lord help me to live the way you want me to live in this area of my life in that area of my life and this weakness and this flaw and this failure and if you can come in there now then the word of god will be holy in my name the name of god will be reflected in here and i won't be what it won't be something that pulls it down amen that makes it look common amen but rather it lifts it up and says there is a victory in christ amen there is a life that you can live that is not of yourself and he can take something out and he can clean it and he can fix it until you can perfectly reflect the image that he had of you before the world began amen amen we're in a kingdom now amen and within that kingdom are many houses many castles there's many different people look around this church this is a kingdom of sorts amen and what do we have we have project managers we have marketing people we have retirees we have accountants we have engineers we have mill rights and machinists we have men we have women we have wives we have single ladies we have single men we have children we have teenagers we have infants we have all sorts of things in the kingdom don't we of all different walks of life of the different families different backgrounds different heritages different colors different countries of origin everything in here is different but it's all part of that same kingdom amen it has so many parts and pieces just look at me okay so i am first of all what a man i'm a husband i'm a father i'm a son i'm a brother i'm a minister i'm an assistant pastor i'm an employee and i'm a citizen of canada as well that's nine different kingdoms that need to be governed by god in my life because each one of them requires different responsibilities different characteristics of me the thing that makes me a good father does not necessarily make me a good employee at the same time because if i apply the same requirement to employees as i do to my employment as i did to my family then i put too much emphasis on my employment and all probability why because god gave me the family before he ever gave me the job and he requires me to hold on to the family before he requires me to hold on to the job and then so there's those kingdoms have to be put into god's order and they've got to be put into god's priorities and then god's got to what reflect himself in me in each of those areas so i've got to have certain attributes as a father i've got to have certain attributes as a son i've got to have certain attributes as a husband and all these different things but what is the one thing i didn't mention what i am a child of god and that is the kingdom that is over all of those and the minute i elevate something over the over the the kingdom of what which i where my father is my heavenly father is then all of a sudden i get out of order underneath it and all of a sudden the kingdom falls apart my entire kingdom falls apart i mean there's little portions within that that have to be in order but if i don't put it all under the umbrella of god's headship that's where i'm a son and he's the father then i'm going to get into trouble aren't i amen what's jesus saying he's saying let the kingdom of heaven let the holy spirit be what be what defines your life in every single one of the roles that you play as a son or daughter of god amen every single one of those things i mentioned father husband son brother minister employee all of those are subject to influence and every one of those means that there's an aspect there where the enemy can get in and equally there's an opportunity for the holy spirit to get in as well something's got to dominate something's got to control something's got to have the influence and jesus is saying pray that the kingdom of heaven pray that the holy spirit is the one that brings you to his will so that what happens in you is what he wants and what he's ordered to happen in heaven amen that what we do here reflects what he wants done in their amen in other words in heaven there is a divine order there's a divine way of doing it and it defines everything from worship to authority to servanthood to fatherhood to husbandry amen and with all of those if you have a husband then you automatically have a wife if you have a father you automatically have a mother amen and so the bride's portion and the bride's requirement is reflected also in what he does and we'll get into that as well as we go through this amen so now this prayer takes on a different look doesn't it because now this is all about me being what subject to the holy spirit so that god can do what he wants to do in this age that's what this is about as he's saying in all of these things humble yourself get yourself under the leadership of that heavenly kingdom of the holy spirit and then through that let your sonship be there as the sonship is in heaven let your father should be as a followership in heaven let your employment be as the employment in heaven let your worship be as the worship in heaven all of these things will be according to the heavenly aspect amen so what's he saying say lord let your pattern be my pattern let everything i do be according to the pattern that you've laid out it may may your order be my order let your beauty be my beauty that your character be my character let your purpose be my purpose let your priority be my priority and in all of those once those boxes get checked then all of a sudden you start to see what christ reflected in you and the name is not made unholy amen says this he says see what the world calls great god calls foolish and what the world calls foolish god calls great he says that's right so don't mind to be called foolish on the flip side if the world is telling you you're great we got a problem don't we because the world's supposed to think we're foolish not great so if we're getting accolades from the world we've got a problem now if they if their accolades are that you're a great worker that's good because we're supposed to be a hard worker we're supposed to be diligent don't don't get that confused but if they're saying you're great because they identify with what you're saying or doing then we've got a problem because we're supposed to be foolish in their eyes he says because remember you can't have the mind of christ in the mind of the world at the same time you can't be in your way and god's way at the same time you have to get out of your own way to let god have his way that's the only way you're ever going to do anything you've got to get away from your own thoughts your own reasons he says don't try to reason just believe a couple short ones here he says if the life of christ be in you if the mind of christ be in you then we're concerned and do the things of christ if the mind of christ is in us then we will recognize that word to be the truth and it lives right through us he says you can't help it it's christ amen thank you jesus this is a high standard amen that the word would be living through us he says you can't help it if you're a part of the word you can't help it why because it's christ so now we start looking at a man being a man differently we start looking at being a woman differently because we've got to look at it through his eyes hey man we started looking at our families differently we start looking at the local body differently we start looking at politics differently we start looking at the condition the world is indifferently because we're looking at it through the mind of christ and his life is within us to quicken that which we need of to make it through this age but now we're pulling things through a filter that is not our own we're pulling it through the eyes of the word we're pulling it through the things that matter to him and so when things are going crazy around us like they are it doesn't matter to the mind of christ because he's got a plan and purpose in it all and all we're looking for is lord what's your purpose in all of this craziness that we're going through and we don't get sucked into the craziness we're just sitting there saying lord what would you have me do in the craziness you know what would you have me reflect in all of this when the whole world's going crazy when people are getting sucked in the silliest sucked into the silliest of things with their time and efforts and strengths and gifts lord what would you have me put my efforts into so that they could see christ in me the hope of glory amen amen so this is what we want to drive into our gender our marital status our relationships our jobs our ministries our callings and we want to compare what we're doing right now to the heavenly pattern and say lord does it match up and we'll always go to the heavenly pattern first then we'll see what happens when we fell and then we'll see what the restoration looks like and our goal is to look at what the restoration looks like not at what the curse is in between amen amen we want to look at the into what god thinks about these things and then compare what we're doing and how we're thinking with the word of god amen because what we're feeding on can color our thinking if it's not the word of god and i guarantee you as we go through this and i speak of this personally we'll start to see satan trying to hide as an angel of light in areas of our life it's just like i said unless you're sinless you can't say that you don't have any satanic influence in your life so the goal here is to show the heavenly pattern you compare to that and say where is satan working in my life where's satan working in my marriage where's satan looking in my identity we're saying looking at how i spend my time we're saying working in my music all of these different things whatever it might be if we can take it back to the heavenly pattern then that scripture says that which maketh manifest is light and so if the word comes and it points and it puts a finger on our life that's god amen and we can say satan now you're exposed and we can now do what we can loose the holy spirit to kick that out because we say lord i'm going to surrender to your word rather than what i thought was the word i was going to surrender to your holy spirit rather than what i thought was the holy spirit because the word says this and what i thought says that and only the word can be true amen so let's go back to the word and that'll expose satan for the liar that he is and all of a sudden he has no power in our lives amen finishing this off jesus said give us this day our daily bread and many gave him fresh manna every day amen we read there where it says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god him and that's a fresh anointing a fresh food a fresh energy right the fresh kill of the word was what brother adam called it every day he says after the eagles are done with it the other ones come and they feed on it he says and that's why you get all these crazy things and forgive me i i i'll mention it just because it's it's horrible at the same time i guess but you know the youtube algorithm throws weird things your way sometimes and i've seen these church fail videos and what they call holy ghost filled services now it is incredible that what they've taken what the holy ghost did even the azusa street revival and what they do now the craziness they call they've got they've got i saw a prophet in africa that was trying to do the brother branham thing but what happened was he forgot what he was supposed to say and the person forgot what she was supposed to say and so they got it all mixed up and he's trying to make it look like he's got discernment up there what is it they're feeding on on what a rotten word from another age from another time god already came and vindicated that and then what happens after that is all of the copycats come behind it and try to make it look like they had what he had amen but what happened the word has moved on the life has moved on there's a fresh word every day that's drawing us back to what the original source say man it's coming from the original source jesus said and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debts other places says forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us amen that one we need help on doesn't it don't we what he says don't ask forgiveness if you're not giving forgiveness amen let us be merciful in order to obtain mercy amen he says and lead us not in temptation but deliver us from evil scripture says that god doesn't tempt us he says but we do it when we're led aside of our own lusts that's what happened but god does what he allows us to be tried amen but we don't get sucked we don't he doesn't he doesn't pull us into things but we get pulled into things and then we got to decide what do we really believe what do we really want here what do we really have living inside of us he says and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil now watch this he says after all this is done after this prayer comes through when this prayer is made manifest it says for thine is the kingdom it starts with him and it finishes with him thine is the kingdom thine is the power we're not going to get there on our own we're not going to do this of our own but the power that brings us is his he says and the glory is yours as well he says forever amen the the reflection of our life that that perfect reflection is all of his power and is all of his holy spirit working in us and the glory that comes out of it all belongs to him as well amen what we're doing is for him it's not for us and then it says what amen so be it right be it unto me according to thy word is what he's saying amen let's stand together if we would like i said just setting the foundation here and then that we'll start looking at heavenly patterns we'll start looking at kingdom patterns for some of the things that for the way we live for who we are how we identify all these different things and we'll start digging in amen pray for me it's uh when you start digging into personal things there's a there's an element of self that can easily creep in and i want to stick it just with the word and then we want to take it back to the scriptures and if the scriptures can't say it then i don't want to say it i don't want to be colored by that and that takes uh that takes a lot of prayer and that takes a lot of just you've got to be real careful with it so and then just pray for me as i go through this and we'll trust god the blessing today man let's just bow our heads if we would heavenly father lord we love that lord when the enemy comes in like a flood the holy spirit raises up a standard lord god and lord you've been challenging me lord and we're bringing that challenge now to your people lord that we would now look at ourselves more completely through the the filter through the mirror of the word lord god and lord that we want to compare the image of what we see versus what we're supposed to see heavenly father and lord as we start to dive into these things lord may we just be honest with ourselves lord may we just humble ourselves not look to the left or right lord not look to the brother or sister that's sitting next to us but lord may we look to our own selves lord may we say lord let me be the reflection let me do my part let me be what you've made me to be lord and then we'll hold up the other one in prayer if we've got time left lord we pray your grace to your people lord strengthen us encourage us lord we don't want to beat ourselves down lord we know that when your word corrects it always gives us a remedy lord it always gives us a way of of returning back to you and lord that's what we want to focus on is that your word is made away and it's through the blood of jesus christ lord in the quickening power of the holy spirit in our lives lord may we just look to you for all these things for we're trusting you now in your name we ask and pray amen let's sing that song i am resolved no longer to linger 223 an oldie but a goody and we'll

and we'll come to that by grace i would say at the end of the series we will certainly or certainly believe that that we were truly born to be a dwelling place and we want to clean everything out so that god can actually be the one who dwells in this dwelling place amen and one part of john was was preaching or teaching all i could see was the purpose of god here is to take me out is to eliminate me right all my thoughts all my ideas take me out of this right and let god take control that seems to be where you're going here right and that's that's the way i feel that's the way the voice is speaking to me and i'm going to hold on to that because i'm trying not to sing lies here you know to be honest i want you know and i believe we all do as as the bride of christ to humble ourselves completely and not exalt ourselves in any way not at all not at all let god do the exalting i'll just be glad to just like we're saying to cast our crowns at the feet of his jesus those who grace abounds and those who found the feet of jesus what does that mean you've humbled yourself to come down to that level to the feet of jesus christ amen sorry about that but i just feel that that's that's where god wants us to go the raptures might take place would we want to hold on to anything that doesn't please christ that doesn't make sense right when you think about it amen let him have praise and make this a prayer i'm going to ask brother man to come and close in prayer and just make this a prayer god help me to let you have me as a dwelling place amen let's just say it i was born [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] amen that i might be while i was born to be for i was yes lord hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] yes [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Music]

you lord anything lord that is tarnished or stained that does not reflect in our lives lord may you just get cleaned out father lord i pray that you just be with us lord yes as we get ready to leave this place lord may your presence just go with us father whether we're lying down or walking about or working lord may you just continue to move in our lives father help us lord just to die more to
