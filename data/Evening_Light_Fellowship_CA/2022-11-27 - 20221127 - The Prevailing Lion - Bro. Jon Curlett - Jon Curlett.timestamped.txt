[32:55] praise the Lord listening there's
[32:56] nothing like the presence it's 12 39 up
[32:59] there
[32:59] and I had
[33:03] I had written this down from prayer
[33:05] request and somehow I wanted I wanted to
[33:07] bring it to the end and I skipped over
[33:08] it and
[33:11] a typical fashion I forgot to go back to
[33:13] it but this this was from the sister
[33:16] uh Beverly
[33:18] I talked to her at length last night and
[33:21] she was letting me know that about her
[33:25] grandson Jack and they finally have
[33:28] if they've finally diagnosed what is
[33:31] wrong with him uh he's the two and two
[33:33] and a half year old little fellow Jack
[33:35] row and um we'd been praying for him and
[33:40] the doctors really didn't know what it
[33:41] was
[33:42] but uh
[33:44] and he's been improving slowly and the
[33:46] doctors have been really happy with him
[33:48] but he's kind of he's got a bit of a
[33:51] setback there now but what he's got is a
[33:54] is a very very rare disease and I read
[33:57] up a little bit on it last night but uh
[34:00] in in his case there's he's the only one
[34:03] in Newfoundland that has it and he's
[34:05] only one of less than 150 children
[34:07] around the world that have it
[34:09] and uh so it it's uh this is really this
[34:14] is really new and it it um
[34:17] it attacks basically it attacks uh it
[34:22] can attack the heart and it can attack
[34:23] the blood flow and it can it can attack
[34:26] a whole pile of things you can have
[34:29] Siege seizures and all of that so and he
[34:32] he can lose his Mobility that sort of
[34:35] thing he can't you know he can't get
[34:37] around at all so when he becomes
[34:39] developmentally delayed
[34:42] and uh he would have to go through some
[34:45] therapy uh to to re to learn what he
[34:48] should have learned before you know so
[34:51] uh it does take it does take some time
[34:54] and by the time he
[34:55] would become say nine years old
[34:58] it should be past the danger area that's
[35:02] you know which which it could be serious
[35:05] up to that point for short and serious
[35:06] anyway so she and that's really a Kohl's
[35:10] notes version there's a whole lot about
[35:11] that
[35:13] online
[35:14] but this this disease is called Tango 2
[35:16] and it's genetic
[35:18] his parents his parents uh both had that
[35:21] Gene and it got passed on to him
[35:24] so uh you know I said all that to say
[35:27] that you know she is requested prayer
[35:30] prayer for the mother and father and
[35:32] prayer for that child there's that other
[35:35] boy Josiah Josiah right and you know
[35:38] he's under ventilator home little babies
[35:40] you know I mean the devil has no
[35:42] respecter of persons that's for sure
[35:44] and that he would attack a child like
[35:47] that you know
[35:49] but God is greater than that and God's
[35:51] promises are far greater than that
[35:53] so you know we sang We sang starting off
[35:57] there you know I sent my word and I
[36:00] healed your disease God sent to remedy
[36:02] right so let's trust God for Jack today
[36:06] and Josiah and those other children you
[36:08] know around the world I mean you know
[36:10] breaks your heart you see children
[36:12] suffer like that you know
[36:15] they they never asked to be born like
[36:18] that obviously right
[36:20] so that's the world we live in
[36:22] unfortunately
[36:24] so we just want to remember Jack and
[36:26] fair if you would
[36:27] so let's um let's just sing this and may
[36:32] God's presence come near to that family
[36:34] today
[36:35] just bring that healing power that touch
[36:38] from almighty God there's nothing like
[36:41] the presence
[36:43] there's nothing like the presence

[42:13] sister Lily and sister Delfina cleaning
[42:15] up after every service I noticed that to
[42:17] make sure the church was ready for the
[42:19] next next meeting brother Mark and
[42:20] sister Maureen hosting 51 52 people at
[42:24] their house that was a new record I
[42:25] think appreciate that all the the
[42:27] specials the choir that was fantastic
[42:29] every everyone you know it's a church
[42:31] effort it's uh we bring a minister in
[42:34] and we trust the Lord to speak but it's
[42:35] everybody that joins in and pulls on the
[42:37] word and sets an atmosphere for God to
[42:40] move in the hearts of his people so very
[42:42] thankful for that brother John and I've
[42:43] been going back and forth all week and
[42:45] if you there's one thing you probably
[42:46] learned this weekend it's he's a
[42:48] positive man amen and everything he
[42:50] points you to is the encouragement to
[42:51] the the word of God in the presence of
[42:53] God and the good things of God and so
[42:55] he's been continuing to encourage me
[42:57] along the way and and we want to
[42:58] certainly thank him and appreciate what
[43:00] he's doing amen you if you knew what was
[43:02] going on and what has gone on in his
[43:04] life you'd wonder how he can be so
[43:05] positive sometimes but yet he never you
[43:07] never hear a a a bad word come out you
[43:10] never hear a poor confession he's always
[43:13] just he's always pointing to the Lord
[43:15] and saying the Lord's got it in control
[43:16] and claiming the promises of the word it
[43:18] was a real encouragement for me you know
[43:20] you get down sometimes and listen that's
[43:22] where Satan starts to work so we want to
[43:24] say what the word says amen not let
[43:26] Satan get a word in edgewise amen we're
[43:28] going to open up this morning Revelation
[43:30] chapter 5 and verse 1. very familiar
[43:32] scripture we've read it a number of
[43:33] times in the last services but we're
[43:36] going to take it from a different
[43:37] direction this morning Revelation 5 and
[43:40] 1 says and I saw in the right hand of
[43:41] him that sat on the throne a book
[43:43] written within and on the back side
[43:45] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[43:48] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[43:49] voice who is worthy to open the a book
[43:52] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[43:55] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[43:57] the Earth was able to open the book nor
[43:59] to look thereon and I wept much because
[44:02] no man was found worthy to open and to
[44:04] read the book neither to look thereon
[44:06] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[44:10] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[44:12] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[44:15] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[44:17] Seals thereof amen God bless you can
[44:20] take your seats this morning and I want
[44:22] to turn a corner bit in our Redemption
[44:25] series and this morning I want to preach
[44:27] on the prevailing lion and we've spoken
[44:29] so much in the first you know certainly
[44:31] the five or six Services of the nature
[44:33] of humanity in our fallen condition and
[44:36] the sin debt that was there that we
[44:37] couldn't pay and it was all dark and
[44:40] gloomy and it was you can't do it and
[44:41] you can't do it and you need something
[44:43] else and you're never going to get there
[44:44] on your own and these different things
[44:46] and it's not always uplifting to hear is
[44:48] it when we start talking about our
[44:49] failures and our faults and our
[44:51] inability to do things but that was we
[44:54] were kind of in the valley and what we
[44:55] were doing was we were showing where we
[44:56] were amen where we are amen if we don't
[44:59] accept what God has done for us but
[45:01] we're starting to come up now into the
[45:03] we're starting to climb up the mountain
[45:04] we're starting to get into the higher
[45:06] Heights and the goodness and we're we're
[45:07] getting into the place of Victory and
[45:09] worship and praise for what he's doing
[45:11] and what he's done and what he's going
[45:13] to be doing and so we're going to start
[45:14] with the prevailing lion this morning
[45:16] and you know we we talked last service
[45:18] about
[45:19] being debt free and and how our sins are
[45:22] not just covered but they're separated
[45:24] from us and that's why we don't have to
[45:26] pay a price anymore it's not just
[45:27] because they're they're paid for but
[45:28] they've been separated from us they
[45:30] can't be attributed to us when God looks
[45:32] at you he can't see sin because it's
[45:34] been separated from you by the blood and
[45:36] and the work of Christ at Calvary and
[45:38] that's why we walk in Liberty with him
[45:40] this morning is because he separated our
[45:42] sins and as he says they're as far away
[45:44] as the East is from the West you can't
[45:46] have you can't ever meet East never
[45:48] Meets West they go in opposite
[45:49] directions and they can never come back
[45:51] amen and but all of that is tied to the
[45:53] scripture that we just read and so I
[45:55] want to start in there and we're going
[45:56] to we're going to develop this thought
[45:58] this morning and it says there again I
[46:00] saw on the right hand of him that sat on
[46:01] the throne a book written within and on
[46:04] the back side sealed with Seven Seals
[46:06] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[46:08] with a loud voice who's worthy to open
[46:10] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[46:12] and we preached on is he worthy and we
[46:14] know there was only one worthy but John
[46:16] says there is no man in Heaven Nor in
[46:18] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[46:20] to open the book neither to look thereon
[46:22] notice it wasn't just opening he had to
[46:25] be worthy not just to open it but he had
[46:27] to be worthy to read it
[46:29] sometimes we say well he opened the
[46:31] Seven Seals but he had to be worthy to
[46:32] read it as well there had to be somebody
[46:34] that could look on it and read it in the
[46:36] way it was supposed to be read that
[46:38] could enforce what was written in the
[46:40] book
[46:41] if you want to get down to it he had to
[46:43] be able to enforce what was written in
[46:44] the book wasn't just worthy to open it
[46:46] but but could he make it happen as it
[46:48] was written in the book that was to be
[46:50] opened up and John says I wept much
[46:52] because no man was found worthy to open
[46:55] and to read the book neither to look
[46:57] thereon now the prophet of God he starts
[46:59] to explain what's going on here he says
[47:01] you see in this book was what was
[47:03] redeemed we say what was the seven seal
[47:05] book what was this book that was that
[47:07] was covered up to the young people what
[47:09] was it that was so special about it
[47:10] brother Bram says it was the book of
[47:12] redemption and everything that he had
[47:15] redeemed was written in that book all he
[47:17] died for was written in the book and he
[47:20] could not leave his mediatorial seat
[47:22] until he had thoroughly redeemed listen
[47:25] this is not a partial Redemption this is
[47:27] not just here a little in their little
[47:29] this is a thorough Redemption it's going
[47:32] to be the full work it's going to be the
[47:33] completed work it's not just a partial
[47:36] thing that he's doing God doesn't do
[47:37] things halfway God does it all the way
[47:40] or he doesn't do it at all that's the
[47:42] way he works it's a thorough Redemption
[47:44] and he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[47:46] because they were predestinated in the
[47:48] Lamb's Book of Life he's saying what he
[47:50] did at the cross there was future
[47:51] considerations that he had to cover
[47:53] because remember he died there but it
[47:55] was for the sins of the entire world but
[47:57] two thousand years of people hadn't been
[48:00] born yet so he said he couldn't just
[48:02] finish the work at the cross he had to
[48:04] stay as a lamb until the last one's
[48:06] redeemed he says we were predestinated
[48:08] the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to
[48:10] stay on there to make intercessions
[48:12] until that last person was what
[48:15] not redeemed he says that last person
[48:18] was finished finished there is a work
[48:20] going on and it's not just to bring
[48:22] people out but it's to bring them to a
[48:24] position is to bring them to a place
[48:26] it's to bring them to a finished work
[48:28] he's got to stay there and he's got to
[48:30] mediate until it's a finished work
[48:33] he says Glory but one day he rose from
[48:36] there what the mediatorial work the
[48:39] behind the throne and he come forth he
[48:41] says where was the book at it was still
[48:43] in the abstract owner God Almighty and
[48:46] John looked around and he wept because
[48:47] there was no man even worthy to look on
[48:50] the book and especially open the seals
[48:52] to reveal what the hidden Mystery was
[48:54] the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals and
[48:57] when these Seven Seals was opened that
[48:59] opened up the entire Bible now that you
[49:02] see denominations today are nominal
[49:04] Christians they look at the Bible as a
[49:06] series of stories and historical events
[49:08] and maybe some promises but brother
[49:10] Brown says when those Seven Seals were
[49:12] open it was the opening of the word and
[49:14] it became an entirely new book because
[49:17] we see now not just stories but we see
[49:20] the types and the shadows of what the
[49:22] redeeming process of God all through
[49:24] time he says it became a whole new buck
[49:26] and he says later he says
[49:29] he says if you can't go back in your
[49:31] Bible and see Christ on every page go
[49:34] back and read it again because you
[49:36] missed something because there's a
[49:37] hidden mystery about what God does and
[49:39] how he does it and why he's doing it all
[49:41] through the scriptures
[49:43] he says the Seven Seals it was sealed
[49:45] with seven Mysteries and in these Seven
[49:47] Seals held the entire mystery of it and
[49:49] it was the book of redemption he says
[49:51] New Testament not the old it only
[49:54] proclaimed for the New Testament that
[49:56] they cannot be made perfect without us
[49:57] and he references Hebrews 11. he says
[50:00] now the Redemption only come when the
[50:02] Redeemer died why because that was the
[50:04] price that had to be paid had to be a
[50:06] perfect lamb had to die and they were
[50:08] potentially under the blood of lambs not
[50:10] the Redeemer they hadn't been redeemed
[50:12] yet until the Redeemer came now John
[50:14] looked around and here sat God on the
[50:16] throne with the book in his hand that
[50:18] had been sealed with Seven Seals and the
[50:20] whole Plan of Redemption was in it so he
[50:22] makes it very clear the whole Plan of
[50:24] Redemption is in here
[50:27] there is no new thing coming under those
[50:29] Seven Seals it's here it always was here
[50:33] but you didn't realize it and that's
[50:35] what the Seven Seals opening did was it
[50:37] showed us what was hidden in here and
[50:40] you you'll you'll scratch your head
[50:41] sometimes we're going to get into it
[50:42] later why does seven why is the mystery
[50:45] of of marriage and divorce the seven
[50:47] seal
[50:48] there's a reason for it why is the
[50:51] serpency there and godhead and all these
[50:52] things it's all tied in because you've
[50:54] got to know who you are you got to know
[50:56] where your natural is and you got to
[50:57] know where your spiritual is you got to
[50:59] know what reality of marriage is you got
[51:00] to know what Oneness is you got to know
[51:02] what relationship is and all of that was
[51:04] hidden since the days of Paul Paul had
[51:06] it all me and then after that they
[51:08] walked away and God sealed it up because
[51:10] there was a time appointed
[51:12] but it's all tied together into these
[51:13] things
[51:15] he says it had been lost by the human
[51:17] race Adam it went back where now catch
[51:20] this he says Satan couldn't take it he
[51:23] just caused him to lose it now that's
[51:25] the key point because what you look
[51:26] around at Satan's kingdom and he offers
[51:29] you so much
[51:30] but he can't offer you what's in the
[51:32] Redemptive book he can't offer you
[51:34] healing he can offer you salvation he
[51:36] can't offer you the Holy Ghost he can
[51:38] offer you Victory he can offer you
[51:40] Deliverance all he can offer you is
[51:42] pleasure and the things that you desire
[51:43] in your natural flesh but he can't give
[51:45] you what's in the book of redemption why
[51:47] because he doesn't have it it didn't go
[51:49] to him he just caused us to lose it he
[51:52] caused Humanity to lose it he said but
[51:54] where did the book go then didn't belong
[51:56] to the human race the blessings didn't
[51:58] belong here here the human race had lost
[52:01] it so it went right on back to the
[52:03] original owner that was god notice he
[52:05] says blessings are in that Redemptive
[52:06] book so Satan doesn't own it so Satan
[52:09] can't offer you blessings can he he can
[52:11] offer you something but he can offer you
[52:13] the blessings that God has for you
[52:15] now the scripture says that John wept
[52:17] bitterly when he saw that this book
[52:19] couldn't be open nobody could take it
[52:21] nobody could look out he was devastated
[52:22] because he knew what it was
[52:25] he knew what it was and he knew if it
[52:27] couldn't be opened if it couldn't be
[52:28] taken if it couldn't be read then we
[52:30] were lost
[52:32] and so he wept and he wept and he wept
[52:34] because there was no hope
[52:36] there's no hope he couldn't do it
[52:39] nobody could do it nobody passed present
[52:41] or future could do it above or below the
[52:43] Earth it didn't matter there was nobody
[52:45] that could open this book
[52:47] and then we see in verse 5 it says and
[52:49] then one of the elders said unto me weep
[52:51] not
[52:52] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[52:55] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[52:58] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[53:01] thereof
[53:02] he says what the lion of the tribe of
[53:04] Judah we know that the line is what he
[53:07] is the king of the beasts he rules the
[53:08] Savannah and he rules mercilessly
[53:11] there is no mercy in a line when he
[53:13] rules he rules with absolute Authority
[53:16] he's the most powerful killer there is
[53:18] on the Savannah nothing can touch a lion
[53:20] when it comes to fierceness it's
[53:22] interesting when you look at hunting
[53:23] when it comes to Lions because the women
[53:24] do most of the work
[53:26] the lionesses they hunt with skill and
[53:29] they hunt with teamwork and they've got
[53:30] a plan and then they execute the plan
[53:32] and then one out of five times they're
[53:34] they're lucky and they get it
[53:36] but you'll see there comes a time where
[53:38] the male lion gets hungry and he says
[53:41] enough of this plane around I'm the king
[53:43] of the Beast I don't have to wait
[53:45] and he takes it into his own hands and I
[53:47] was watching a video and there's this
[53:49] there's this place in Africa where the
[53:52] wildebeest have to go down a river and
[53:53] then they come up a bank and they have
[53:54] to go up a hill and it's an ambush spot
[53:57] and I was watching this video and
[53:58] there's this female lioness here and
[54:01] she's sitting there and there's
[54:02] wildebeest after wildebeest going back
[54:04] there's thousands going by and she's
[54:07] just sitting there and one after another
[54:08] goes by somebody told me it was a woman
[54:10] shopping for shoes here
[54:12] but but she's sitting there and she's
[54:15] not making a move you know why because
[54:17] she can only tackle the really old or
[54:20] the really small
[54:21] she's gotta find the right one that she
[54:23] has the power to take down and hold on
[54:26] to once she gets it down on the ground
[54:27] so she's sitting there and one after the
[54:30] other is going fine you think this is
[54:31] the most boring video you're ever going
[54:33] to watch and then all of a sudden this
[54:35] happens
[54:37] Big Poppy walks in
[54:39] and listen he's you know what he was
[54:41] doing was he was sitting over there
[54:42] saying
[54:43] that one's a good one that one's a good
[54:44] one that one's a good one that one's a
[54:46] good one that one's a good one and the
[54:47] and the Lioness is just laying them go
[54:49] by you know what he said he got hungry
[54:52] that's what he did he got hungry and he
[54:54] just charged in
[54:56] and you know what when he charged in he
[54:58] didn't go for the weak one he didn't go
[55:00] for the old one he didn't go for the
[55:02] young one the first one that he made
[55:04] contact with he said that's mine
[55:06] there was no there was no pre-planning
[55:08] here he just charged in the one to the
[55:10] right just got away you can see it
[55:12] really skittering there he just boom but
[55:14] knocks it down and then you see in the
[55:16] next one he just takes it by the neck
[55:17] and he drags it away lays on top of it
[55:19] subdues it and kills it
[55:21] that's what the male lion does
[55:24] amen we're talking about the prevailing
[55:26] lion this is what the prevailing lion
[55:28] looks like in the real world he doesn't
[55:30] wait for anything he doesn't need to he
[55:32] is confident in his supreme power and
[55:35] authority on that Savannah and he can
[55:37] kill anything that he wants to kill him
[55:39] when he decides he wants to kill it so
[55:41] it was amazing I was looking here but
[55:43] what struck me is that he didn't care
[55:45] how big it was he didn't care how small
[55:47] it was he didn't care how fast it was
[55:48] running he said I'm the king of the
[55:50] beasts I rule this land I take what I
[55:53] want and that's the nature of a
[55:55] prevailing line is that it when it sets
[55:57] its mind on something that does it it
[55:59] doesn't sit there and think about it it
[56:01] doesn't Wonder am I able to do it amen
[56:03] but this is the nature of the one that
[56:05] came forward to take the book was that
[56:06] he said what the lion of the tribe of
[56:09] Judah has prevailed that means not only
[56:12] has he fought but he has won he's got
[56:14] the Victory and now he's coming forth
[56:16] and that Victory looked like a lamb
[56:18] sling
[56:19] that was his victory was he had been
[56:21] slain but as he comes forth to take it
[56:23] now it is not the nature of a lamb but
[56:25] is the nature of a lion the Victor the
[56:28] the king of the Beast that comes forth
[56:29] to take this out of the hand that's
[56:31] there why because he's going to need the
[56:33] lion nature to fulfill Redemption now
[56:36] he had to die to pay the price but he
[56:38] needs a lion's characteristics to take
[56:40] what now belongs to him that's what
[56:42] we're going to be getting into amen he
[56:44] needs that because what
[56:46] when he opens that book what does he see
[56:48] he sees people that aren't in his
[56:50] kingdom anymore
[56:52] because we were what lost and undone
[56:54] without God or his son as the song says
[56:56] that we were lost in our sins and so he
[56:58] looks at that book and he needs the
[57:00] nature of a lion to go in what secure
[57:02] the kingdom
[57:03] to get his children back under his
[57:05] protection to drive out the things that
[57:07] are there uh my my boys and I were
[57:10] watching a video on lions and and one of
[57:12] them a male lion got caught by a pack of
[57:14] hyenas guess what 20 hyenas can kill a
[57:17] lion
[57:18] but then his brother came along and two
[57:21] lions put 20 hyenas on the Run
[57:23] because what he was surrounded and as
[57:25] one but with two in there he went in and
[57:27] boom there was they scattered they knew
[57:29] they couldn't take two of them but the
[57:30] idea here is that what he knows who he
[57:33] is
[57:34] and he knows he's got a kingdom and
[57:35] he'll protect it to the death if he has
[57:37] to he'll protect it to the death there's
[57:39] nothing going to stop that King amen he
[57:42] has Supreme confidence in who and what
[57:44] he is you ever see a lion when he's
[57:46] walking around
[57:47] and he walks and and you'll see this
[57:49] that as he walks he doesn't look to the
[57:51] left or to the right
[57:53] he just goes where he's going to go
[57:55] and God helped the thing that gets in
[57:57] front of him
[57:58] he just goes and he walks and he looks
[58:01] near to left to right he knows
[58:02] everything that's going on he's very
[58:03] aware he's hyper aware of what's
[58:04] happening but he doesn't care what's
[58:06] there and you've got to get out of his
[58:07] way because that's his path and he's
[58:09] walking on it because he's the king of
[58:10] the beasts amen why because he's going
[58:12] to be dealing with the satanic Kingdom
[58:14] that does not move my negotiation
[58:16] Satan does he Satan wants you to
[58:20] negotiate
[58:21] give up a little bit
[58:23] just back off a little bit don't delete
[58:26] the app just only go on once a week
[58:29] don't go to that website every day but
[58:31] you can check on it a couple times a
[58:33] week right don't spend too much time
[58:36] with that person okay you've been
[58:37] spending too much but let's just back
[58:38] away a little bit you know what the
[58:40] scripture says if your eye offend thee
[58:42] pluck it out if your arm offend you cut
[58:44] it off and Satan doesn't want you to
[58:46] pluck out or cut off he wants you to
[58:48] keep a little bit in there so that he
[58:49] has an inroads into your life that's the
[58:52] negotiation tactic let's not kick me out
[58:54] of your life let's just maybe put me out
[58:57] so it looks like you have control if you
[58:59] don't put him out he's still in control
[59:01] Amen in the king anointing the line
[59:03] anointing does not let Satan hang around
[59:05] the fringes he boots him out completely
[59:08] he's the king of the Beast he's the king
[59:09] of the Savannah and that's the anointing
[59:11] that we're looking at amen so when the
[59:13] line anointing comes it is not
[59:14] negotiation now it is not sacrificed it
[59:17] is for battle and it is for Dominion
[59:18] that's what he's in this for he's in
[59:20] there to what win the battle
[59:23] he had to die and that was the first
[59:25] Victory but now he rose again brother
[59:27] Brown says if he never rose again we
[59:28] couldn't be redeemed couldn't be
[59:30] redeemed now he's coming in what power
[59:32] and demonstration
[59:35] verse 6 says and I beheld and lo in the
[59:38] midst of the throne and of the four
[59:39] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[59:40] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[59:43] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[59:45] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[59:47] the Earth
[59:49] he says then the land comes forward and
[59:51] he takes the book now John was asked not
[59:53] to weep anymore he said behold the lion
[59:55] of Judah has prevailed and he can take
[59:57] the book and open it so he turned to
[59:59] look for a lion and he saw a lamb and
[1:00:01] the Elder called and said a lion has
[1:00:03] prevailed but when he come and looked it
[1:00:06] was a lamb coming out from the throne
[1:00:07] now he'd never noticed that before why
[1:00:10] he the lion the lamb the lamb had been
[1:00:13] back there and he's doing his
[1:00:15] mediatorial work for he was bleeding for
[1:00:18] the people interceding for the people
[1:00:20] until the last soul that was put on the
[1:00:23] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:00:24] foundation of the world come in
[1:00:26] he says there's just going to be so many
[1:00:28] of them there and and that's it that's
[1:00:30] all the others won't even want to come
[1:00:32] in they have no desire to come in
[1:00:35] so what on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:36] That's the ones that are predestinated
[1:00:38] and he says that's the ones he's waiting
[1:00:40] for that's why he's mediating that's why
[1:00:42] he's in that lamb anointingness to get
[1:00:43] that last one in then as soon as it's in
[1:00:46] then what it switches to lion he says so
[1:00:49] then when that last Soul comes in then
[1:00:52] the time of redemption is finished for
[1:00:54] the Gentiles then the lamb comes forth
[1:00:57] to claim his rights to what he has
[1:00:58] redeemed and that's all finished the
[1:01:00] Earth and everything belongs to him see
[1:01:03] he has redeemed it with his own blood
[1:01:04] and when he come forth to take this book
[1:01:06] to open it John didn't weep anymore and
[1:01:09] now we found out that a slain lamb is a
[1:01:12] bloody lamb bleeding all over it's been
[1:01:13] slayed and after it had been slain it
[1:01:16] raised up it raised again it was sitting
[1:01:19] on the throne say back in behind the
[1:01:21] throne like this interceding for all
[1:01:23] those Souls that would come
[1:01:26] that's why it wasn't finished at Calvary
[1:01:28] he had to stay in a mediatorial role
[1:01:30] because there was others going to be
[1:01:31] born after that he says now when the
[1:01:34] last one was here and it was completed
[1:01:36] God still held the book of redemption
[1:01:38] see now he's just doing the Kinsman work
[1:01:40] so he says Christ is behind there and
[1:01:42] he's mediating mediating mediating
[1:01:43] mediating and the blood is covering and
[1:01:45] there's blood on The Mercy Seat
[1:01:48] and we're still in the spot where Christ
[1:01:49] is doing the Kinsmen Redeemer work he's
[1:01:51] what he's mediating he's covering
[1:01:52] everything that's why there's mercy here
[1:01:54] and it's why the world is the way it is
[1:01:57] because when he comes as lion full lion
[1:01:59] you don't want to be on this Earth
[1:02:01] because he only comes in judgment then
[1:02:02] he's coming to claim his own
[1:02:05] and he's coming to what judge everything
[1:02:06] else that's here and the world can be
[1:02:08] slacked now because he's not judging
[1:02:10] them yet why because there's mercy here
[1:02:12] there's Mercy for the bride right and in
[1:02:14] that Mercy there's Mercy for everyone
[1:02:16] else as well potentially potentially
[1:02:18] everyone on the earth could have mercy
[1:02:20] today if they wanted it
[1:02:22] now watch he says then he came and took
[1:02:24] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:02:26] that sat upon the throne now notice he
[1:02:28] doesn't open it
[1:02:30] he's a lamb here and he takes the book
[1:02:32] as a lamb
[1:02:33] he's in the lamb anointing as he takes
[1:02:35] it but he does not open the book as a
[1:02:37] lamb
[1:02:38] but watch brother Brown says what was it
[1:02:40] the owner of the original that had the
[1:02:42] book of redemption in his right hand No
[1:02:44] Angel no Angelic being nothing else
[1:02:46] could take the place he says in this
[1:02:48] bloody lamb walked out and took the book
[1:02:50] out of his hand here what was it brother
[1:02:53] he says this is the most Sublime thing
[1:02:55] in scripture an act that not an angel
[1:02:58] not nothing can do it and the lamb came
[1:03:01] forth and took it from the right hand of
[1:03:02] him that sat upon the throne he said
[1:03:04] what is it now it belongs to the lamb
[1:03:08] he takes it now it belongs to him
[1:03:11] amen God's law required he's the one
[1:03:14] that holds it God's law required a
[1:03:16] kinsman redeemer and the lamb came out
[1:03:18] holding it and says I am their Kinsmen I
[1:03:21] am their redeemer I've made intercession
[1:03:23] for them now catch this he says and now
[1:03:27] I've come to claim their rights for them
[1:03:30] you say he came to claim it for himself
[1:03:32] he says no I came to claim their rights
[1:03:35] for them
[1:03:36] so he's the enforcer now that we get
[1:03:39] what he has purchased because remember
[1:03:41] the redeemer's job is not to get
[1:03:43] something for himself but it's to
[1:03:45] restore something to the original owner
[1:03:47] and he says I'm here to restore your
[1:03:50] claim to your rights that you lost when
[1:03:52] Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:54] he says that's the only one I've come to
[1:03:56] claim their rights in that they have a
[1:03:59] right to everything to everything that
[1:04:02] was lost in the fall and I paid the
[1:04:05] price so the Redeemer gets to take the
[1:04:08] title but he's got to give it to the
[1:04:09] person that owns the title
[1:04:12] that's what he's doing is he says I've
[1:04:14] come to restore what I bought for you
[1:04:18] so there's something in here for us
[1:04:21] it's not just him he's he's redeeming a
[1:04:23] bride but there's something in there for
[1:04:25] us because he gave it to us when Adam
[1:04:27] and Eve were on the Earth they had full
[1:04:29] Dominion they had full relationship full
[1:04:31] Fellowship eternal life and these
[1:04:33] different things we've covered before he
[1:04:35] says oh brother who don't that make you
[1:04:37] feel religious inside not by Good Works
[1:04:40] which we have done but by his Mercy you
[1:04:43] see nothing of me when he steps up from
[1:04:45] that Throne as a bloody lamb and takes
[1:04:47] the book I'm in the book but I have
[1:04:49] nothing to do with the taking of the
[1:04:50] book oh wait a minute and them elders
[1:04:53] and everything else begin to throw off
[1:04:55] crowns and dignitaries began to get on
[1:04:57] the ground see no one no one could do it
[1:04:59] and he walks right up to the right hand
[1:05:01] of God and took the book out of his hand
[1:05:03] and claimed his rights I have died for
[1:05:05] them I am their Kinsmen Redeemer I am
[1:05:08] the mediator my blood was shed I have
[1:05:10] become men and I did this in order to
[1:05:13] get that church back again the one I
[1:05:16] foresaw before the foundation of the
[1:05:18] world
[1:05:19] he foresaw what was written in the book
[1:05:21] because he wrote it
[1:05:24] now catch this
[1:05:26] brother John purposed it
[1:05:30] no no no no no Minister purposed you
[1:05:32] being here
[1:05:34] no father no mother
[1:05:36] no Aunt no uncle
[1:05:38] no great Christian
[1:05:40] he said I have purposed it
[1:05:43] I spoke it that it would be there
[1:05:47] and nobody was able to take it but I
[1:05:49] went down and done it myself I am their
[1:05:52] Kinsmen I am become Kim soaks and he
[1:05:55] takes the book amen
[1:05:57] oh who is waiting there for me tonight
[1:05:59] who is that one church that's waiting
[1:06:02] there who else could wait there for you
[1:06:04] that kinsman redeemer oh my what a
[1:06:06] Sublime act now he has the title deed to
[1:06:09] Redemption he has it in his hand
[1:06:11] mediation is done now he has it in his
[1:06:15] hand remember it's been in the hand of
[1:06:16] God all the time but now it's in the
[1:06:18] hand of the land now watch the title
[1:06:21] deed of redemption of all creation is in
[1:06:23] his hand and he's come to claim it back
[1:06:25] too for who the human race
[1:06:29] not claim it back to Angels claimed it
[1:06:32] back to the humans which it was given
[1:06:35] for what to make Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:38] God again
[1:06:40] there is an effect of the reading of
[1:06:42] this book and it's to make us sons and
[1:06:44] daughters again we always were sons and
[1:06:46] daughters but to what make a parent the
[1:06:48] seed that was inside us all along
[1:06:51] he says what bring them back to the
[1:06:53] Garden of Eden and everything they lost
[1:06:56] the whole creation the trees the animal
[1:06:58] life everything else oh my doesn't that
[1:07:01] make you feel good it does something to
[1:07:03] you see for I know this there is someone
[1:07:06] there waiting for me you know it's
[1:07:08] amazing to me but brother Brandon would
[1:07:10] focus on what not all power not all
[1:07:13] authority not all wonderful streets
[1:07:15] paved with gold I've Got a Mansion over
[1:07:17] there he says no no no there's someone
[1:07:19] waiting there for me that was the thing
[1:07:22] that mattered the most to him there is
[1:07:23] one that paid the price and that's the
[1:07:25] one that's waiting there for me there is
[1:07:27] someone paid the price that I couldn't
[1:07:29] pay that's right he did it for me did it
[1:07:31] for you he did it for the whole human
[1:07:33] race and now he comes forth to claim his
[1:07:36] Redemptive rights claim it for who not
[1:07:38] for himself for us he is one of us he is
[1:07:42] our kin folks oh my he's my brother he's
[1:07:45] my savior he's my God he's my kinsman
[1:07:47] redeemer he is all for what was I
[1:07:50] without him or what could I be without
[1:07:52] him so see he is My All In All and he's
[1:07:56] standing there as our Kim folks and now
[1:07:58] he's been interceding for us up until
[1:07:59] this time and now he comes forth and
[1:08:02] takes the book of redemption to claim
[1:08:04] his rights of what he did for us
[1:08:07] remember the Kinsmen Redeemer he doesn't
[1:08:09] claim it for himself he pays the price
[1:08:11] and then gives what he paid the price
[1:08:13] for to the one that he paid it for in
[1:08:15] the first place amen it's not for him he
[1:08:18] benefits he benefits if there's a
[1:08:20] restoration in our family if there's a
[1:08:22] restoration in our church we benefit but
[1:08:24] the primary benefactor is what the one
[1:08:26] who had the price paid for them that
[1:08:28] didn't cost them a penny amen
[1:08:30] it says and when he had taken the book
[1:08:32] The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty
[1:08:34] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:08:36] every one of them Harps and golden vials
[1:08:38] full of Voters which are the prayers of
[1:08:40] saints and they sung a new song because
[1:08:43] what everyone was weeping everyone was
[1:08:46] crying everybody was in a hopeless
[1:08:48] Affair a state of affairs nobody had any
[1:08:51] Joy or peace or rest up there they're
[1:08:53] sitting there saying somebody's got to
[1:08:55] take the book and open it and nobody's
[1:08:56] doing it so it was a mournful time in
[1:08:59] heaven
[1:09:00] even in the presence of God it was
[1:09:02] mournful
[1:09:03] but they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[1:09:05] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:09:08] seals thereof for thou was slain and
[1:09:10] Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[1:09:12] of every Kindred and tongue and people
[1:09:14] and nation and has made us unto our God
[1:09:17] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:09:19] the Earth
[1:09:20] and I beheld and heard the voice of many
[1:09:22] angels round about the throne and the
[1:09:24] beasts and the elders and the number of
[1:09:26] them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand
[1:09:30] that's a lot that's Millions
[1:09:32] he says and thousands of thousands
[1:09:35] that's a million so there's millions and
[1:09:37] then there's tens of millions that's how
[1:09:39] many God has saved over there and
[1:09:41] they're saying with a loud voice Worthy
[1:09:43] is the Lamb that was slain
[1:09:45] that's what he came out as was a slain
[1:09:47] lamb but watch now to receive power and
[1:09:49] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:09:53] and glory and blessing now these are not
[1:09:55] the attributes of a lamb these are the
[1:09:57] attributes of a lion these are the
[1:09:59] attributes of a king of a ruler of a
[1:10:01] supreme authority amen the lamb
[1:10:03] anointing now moves away and the line
[1:10:05] anointing takes over and he comes to
[1:10:07] take possession amen and it's what now
[1:10:10] it's victory time it's not mediation
[1:10:11] time now it's time for battle not time
[1:10:13] for negotiation now time to lay your
[1:10:15] life down but time to lay to pick your
[1:10:17] life back up again amen what there's no
[1:10:19] holding them back now
[1:10:21] when he takes that and opens it up
[1:10:23] nothing's going to stop him
[1:10:24] he says in every creature which is in
[1:10:27] heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:10:28] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[1:10:30] that are in them heard I sane blessing
[1:10:33] and honor and glory and power be unto
[1:10:35] him that sitteth upon the throne and
[1:10:37] unto the lamb forever and ever and the
[1:10:39] four be said amen
[1:10:41] and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down
[1:10:43] and worshiped him and liveth forever and
[1:10:46] ever
[1:10:47] now it's easy to sit here and say well
[1:10:49] we're brother John he said very clearly
[1:10:51] that we're under the lamb anointing
[1:10:53] because The Mercy Seat there's still
[1:10:54] Blood On The Mercy Seat but you've got
[1:10:56] to understand that God transitions
[1:10:59] there's a blending of things that happen
[1:11:01] and you even see it in the blending from
[1:11:03] the Gentiles to the Jews there's an
[1:11:04] absolute moment where he stops to work
[1:11:06] with the Gentiles and that's the Rapture
[1:11:08] of the Saints amen the rev the the
[1:11:09] Resurrection The Rapture that's when he
[1:11:11] stops the deal with the Gentiles and he
[1:11:12] moves to the Jews but there's still a
[1:11:14] blending there's still a preparation
[1:11:16] that's going on and we see that that
[1:11:18] line anointing is there because when we
[1:11:20] look in the scriptures we see that he's
[1:11:22] already roared
[1:11:23] and if we turn to Revelation 10 we see
[1:11:25] the transition that happens
[1:11:28] and Revelation 10 1 says and I saw
[1:11:30] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:11:32] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:11:34] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:11:36] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:11:38] pillars of fire now that's Christ if you
[1:11:40] look in Revelation 1 that's the very
[1:11:42] description of Christ so it says Christ
[1:11:43] comes down and he's not a bleeding lamb
[1:11:45] anymore he's a mighty Angel this is a
[1:11:48] powerful Angel that's coming down he's
[1:11:50] not coming in humility but he's coming
[1:11:52] in power and authority and in a majesty
[1:11:54] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:11:56] open now remember the lamb took it and
[1:11:59] it was closed but now he comes as a
[1:12:01] mighty Angel and it's open
[1:12:04] so it's open as a mighty Angel not as a
[1:12:06] lamb
[1:12:07] he held it as a lamb but it's a it it's
[1:12:10] in the it's in power and Majesty that he
[1:12:12] opens this book amen and he set his
[1:12:14] right foot upon the sea and his left on
[1:12:16] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[1:12:19] when a lion roarth
[1:12:22] so what do lambs do lambs bleat
[1:12:25] he's not a lamb here
[1:12:27] but what when he speaks it's as a lion
[1:12:29] roaring amen he's moved into a different
[1:12:32] anointing now because he's in a
[1:12:34] different purpose
[1:12:35] and you see that all through the
[1:12:36] scriptures you see it even in the four
[1:12:38] beasts he starts with a line you know
[1:12:40] and he goes to ox and man and Eagle
[1:12:41] again God Moves In anointings God moves
[1:12:44] in characteristics and the
[1:12:45] characteristic here is he's opening
[1:12:47] these seals is as a what lion
[1:12:50] because as he speaks it's as a lion
[1:12:52] roaring and when he had cried seven
[1:12:55] Thunders uttered their voices now so as
[1:12:57] soon as he starts to open the seals and
[1:12:59] read them then what happens a lion roars
[1:13:02] right he stepped into a different
[1:13:03] anointing he stepped into a different
[1:13:05] position he stepped into a different
[1:13:06] place in the word
[1:13:08] and he changes who he is he changes what
[1:13:10] he is he's always been it but he steps
[1:13:12] into that phase of his ministry if we
[1:13:14] wanted to put it that way amen it's not
[1:13:16] a lamb bleeding now but it's a lion
[1:13:17] roaring why because he's taking
[1:13:19] possession of what's written in those
[1:13:21] books in that book amen
[1:13:24] brother Brown says Christ has redeemed
[1:13:26] us now we are now redeemed but he has
[1:13:29] not claimed his possession yet he hasn't
[1:13:31] claimed it see if he took the book of
[1:13:33] redemption everything that Adam had in
[1:13:35] everything that he lost Christ redeems
[1:13:37] that back and he's already redeemed us
[1:13:39] but he hasn't took the possession yet he
[1:13:41] cannot until the time appointed
[1:13:44] and then will come the resurrection and
[1:13:46] then the Earth will be renewed again and
[1:13:48] then he'll take possession his
[1:13:50] possession which he got when he redeemed
[1:13:52] us but he will do it at the appointed
[1:13:54] time
[1:13:56] verse 4 says and when the seven Thunders
[1:13:58] had uttered their voices I was about to
[1:14:00] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:14:01] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:14:03] which are seven Thunders uttered and
[1:14:05] write them not so he's already read the
[1:14:07] book this is past tense this is in the
[1:14:09] days of John the Revelator on the Isle
[1:14:12] of Patmos and so God has already read it
[1:14:14] as a lion prophetically but then what
[1:14:17] happens is what he says now close it up
[1:14:19] because there is a time appointed for it
[1:14:21] and it's not right now and we see that
[1:14:23] even in the early church because the
[1:14:25] first the first anointing in the church
[1:14:27] was what lion
[1:14:29] and they were imperfection there they
[1:14:31] were they were ruled absolutely I mean
[1:14:32] from the day of Pentecost out they were
[1:14:35] walking around in the power of the Holy
[1:14:37] Ghost under the direct power of the Holy
[1:14:39] Spirit under the guidance of God and in
[1:14:41] there that church was perfect
[1:14:43] you couldn't go in that church and and
[1:14:45] and be sinful or or trying to hide
[1:14:48] things from God and we saw that with
[1:14:49] anias and Safara they came in and Peter
[1:14:52] said why have you why have you tried to
[1:14:53] hide things from the Holy Spirit why
[1:14:54] have you tried to lie and they were
[1:14:56] struck dead because they did it the
[1:14:57] church was in perfect operation but what
[1:15:00] happened was what they moved away they
[1:15:02] left their first love and so God says
[1:15:04] seal up the book God had showed all of
[1:15:06] this to Paul remember the book there's
[1:15:07] nothing new in the book
[1:15:09] the book was written everything that we
[1:15:11] need is here already Paul already knew
[1:15:13] all about it in general in general not
[1:15:16] everything that John saw but Paul knew
[1:15:18] what it meant to be fully redeemed Paul
[1:15:19] knew what it meant to be in full
[1:15:21] relationship with Christ
[1:15:22] the whole church had it that's what it
[1:15:24] was it was a perfect State at the
[1:15:26] beginning and then it dropped drop drop
[1:15:27] into a valley and then it came up again
[1:15:30] at this time amen but what happened is
[1:15:32] they moved away from God and they went
[1:15:34] to the to to men and so God said close
[1:15:36] it up
[1:15:37] close it up I can't finish it there's a
[1:15:39] purpose there's a plan still here God
[1:15:41] wasn't taken by surprise when they did
[1:15:43] it God hasn't ever taken by surprise
[1:15:45] nothing outwits or out foxes God God
[1:15:47] knew it beforehand so God says seal it
[1:15:49] up there's a Time coming when we're
[1:15:50] going to open this up and we're going to
[1:15:52] finish the work that I've started
[1:15:54] verse 5 says in the angel which I saw
[1:15:56] stand upon the scene upon the Earth
[1:15:58] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:16:00] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:16:02] created heaven and the things that
[1:16:04] therein are in the earth and the things
[1:16:05] that therein are in the sea and the
[1:16:07] things which are therein that there
[1:16:08] should be time no longer
[1:16:11] so there's a time where he says enough's
[1:16:12] enough we got to open the books amen and
[1:16:15] verse 7 says the time but in the days of
[1:16:18] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:16:20] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:16:22] should be finished as he had declared to
[1:16:24] his servants the prophet so there's a
[1:16:26] final time chosen for this book of
[1:16:28] redemption to be fully opened again it
[1:16:31] was sealed up there's a time for it to
[1:16:32] open up and it's when in the days of the
[1:16:34] voice of the seventh angel the seventh
[1:16:36] angel is the seventh Church age
[1:16:37] messenger the laodicean messenger we
[1:16:40] recognize that as William Branham so
[1:16:42] when he begins to speak when his message
[1:16:44] comes forth then that's when the mystery
[1:16:46] of God is going to be fully revealed and
[1:16:49] that's when Redemption really starts to
[1:16:50] kick off remember brother Brown said the
[1:16:52] Rapture is a process
[1:16:54] redemption's a process and so you can't
[1:16:56] just say absolutely he's a lamb and then
[1:16:58] he's a lion because the lion anointing
[1:17:00] is what brings his possession the lamb
[1:17:02] anointing is what keeps him safe under
[1:17:04] the blood but he's doing both Works
[1:17:06] simultaneously at the end of all things
[1:17:08] amen lamb time is nearly over
[1:17:12] you look around the world it's as it was
[1:17:14] in the days of no it's as it was in the
[1:17:16] days of Sodom and Gomorrah right that's
[1:17:18] all Luke 17 30 all these things it's
[1:17:20] being fulfilled it's been fulfilled
[1:17:22] I don't know how much worse it can get
[1:17:24] it's going to get worse but you don't
[1:17:26] see how much worse it can get
[1:17:28] the times are here the lamb time is
[1:17:30] nearly over Church These about to come
[1:17:32] off of The Mercy Seat and when he comes
[1:17:34] off there's no more coming in
[1:17:36] so the thing is when the lion roars
[1:17:38] what's it supposed to do it's supposed
[1:17:39] to catch our attention it's supposed to
[1:17:42] say the lion is war there's something
[1:17:43] going on because God doesn't speak
[1:17:45] without purpose God doesn't just say
[1:17:47] things
[1:17:48] God speaks with purpose and with intent
[1:17:50] so when he does it
[1:17:52] then what the church is supposed to perk
[1:17:54] up their ears and say something's about
[1:17:55] to happen because the lion has roared
[1:17:58] there's something that's going on Amen
[1:18:00] and what it's got to be a king that
[1:18:02] comes because he's got to be the king of
[1:18:03] your life
[1:18:04] he's got to be the king of your body
[1:18:06] he's got to be the king of your habits
[1:18:07] he's got to be the king of your family
[1:18:08] he's got to be the king of your
[1:18:09] relationships and your marriage and your
[1:18:11] career and all these things and it's
[1:18:13] going to take a kingly anointing to burn
[1:18:15] out what we don't have to that what
[1:18:16] we're not supposed to have in there
[1:18:17] right he's got to be a king
[1:18:20] because everyone wants him as Savior
[1:18:22] even the unbeliever could say I want him
[1:18:24] as a savior in the sense that they would
[1:18:27] appreciate to have that benefit but how
[1:18:29] many want them as Lord
[1:18:30] because he's got to be Lord and savior
[1:18:33] imagine he can only be Lord under a line
[1:18:35] anointing not a lamb anointing that's
[1:18:36] the king the king is the lion every
[1:18:38] single time amen
[1:18:40] brother Bram says this he says look at
[1:18:42] the zodiac
[1:18:43] I can't no
[1:18:48] oh I put in the wrong place okay sorry
[1:18:51] no I put that in the right place sorry I
[1:18:52] missed it in my notes there because we
[1:18:54] saw what
[1:18:55] remember he says what when he Roars the
[1:18:58] Seven Seals are opened amen and in the
[1:19:01] days of the seventh angel then the
[1:19:02] mystery was going to be finished and we
[1:19:04] saw what we saw the opening of the seals
[1:19:06] didn't we it was in the seven angel
[1:19:07] cloud that came down on Sunset mountain
[1:19:09] in 1963 and Time Magazine recorded it
[1:19:12] and they talked about the high cloud
[1:19:13] ring of mystery brother Brown said see
[1:19:16] him there he is in the cloud
[1:19:18] Christ coming down and what was he
[1:19:20] coming down as he says he's wigged as
[1:19:22] what
[1:19:23] a judge he says he's not coming down as
[1:19:25] a lamb anymore Church he's coming down
[1:19:27] with judgment
[1:19:29] but we're not judged yet but he's come
[1:19:31] down
[1:19:32] because he's calmed down but he hasn't
[1:19:34] appeared yet in the way that we're going
[1:19:35] to see him but he's here so you have
[1:19:37] this blending that's happening you have
[1:19:38] this Cross Point you have a junction
[1:19:40] that's happening and he's moving out of
[1:19:42] one and he's moving into another and it
[1:19:43] says judge and he said it says King amen
[1:19:46] he's going to come back after three and
[1:19:47] a half years as King of Everything But
[1:19:49] he comes down first as king of what the
[1:19:51] bride that's what he's coming down and
[1:19:53] so we saw this amen
[1:19:56] brother Brown says look at the Zodiac it
[1:19:59] starts off with a virgin it ends up with
[1:20:00] Leo the Lion the first coming and the
[1:20:02] second coming of Christ everything in
[1:20:04] the heavens declares him everything in
[1:20:06] the earth declares him everything around
[1:20:08] declares him his people declares him his
[1:20:11] power declares himself
[1:20:15] he did his mediatorial work as a lamb
[1:20:17] and there was no power in that
[1:20:19] it was laying down his life there was no
[1:20:21] exercise of authority was it but when he
[1:20:23] picked his life up again that's when he
[1:20:25] exercised Authority that's when he
[1:20:26] showed the power that was there amen and
[1:20:28] so he what he starts in humility but he
[1:20:30] ends up in power and Majesty is what
[1:20:32] brother Branham is saying there what is
[1:20:34] it the king of the Beast is relentless
[1:20:36] he's Relentless and if there's anything
[1:20:38] I want you to catch this morning is that
[1:20:39] if you're in that book of redemption
[1:20:40] he's not going to stop until he's done
[1:20:43] until you're a finished work
[1:20:45] that's what he's pressing for today he's
[1:20:46] not pressing to clean up the world he's
[1:20:48] not pressing to clean up everyone that's
[1:20:50] out there he's not there to change the
[1:20:52] politics he's not there to change the
[1:20:54] social justice movements and this
[1:20:55] program and that program he's there to
[1:20:57] get you to where you need to be in the
[1:20:59] word to get you to what's written about
[1:21:01] you in this in this great book of
[1:21:03] redemption that's all he's focused on
[1:21:05] and he is Relentless in that and he's
[1:21:07] going to do whatever it takes to get us
[1:21:08] there whether he has to shake you
[1:21:10] whether he has to spank you whether he
[1:21:12] has to log in hot love and hug and kiss
[1:21:14] on you whatever it takes whatever it
[1:21:16] takes to make you get there he's going
[1:21:18] to do on it amen what he knows his
[1:21:20] territory he knows you're his and he's
[1:21:22] going to be relentless to defend it to
[1:21:25] clean it out and to keep it where he
[1:21:27] wants it to be amen proverbs 30 says
[1:21:29] there be three things which go well yay
[1:21:33] four are coming and going now that's not
[1:21:35] language used today but that word go
[1:21:36] well and comely and going means there
[1:21:38] are three things which are stately and
[1:21:40] Majestic in how they walk and he said a
[1:21:43] lion which is strongest among beasts and
[1:21:46] turneth not away for any and I put this
[1:21:49] picture of this line you see a lion
[1:21:51] walking towards you like that what do
[1:21:52] you do
[1:21:54] do you stand your ground
[1:21:57] not unless you have a very high powered
[1:22:00] rifle
[1:22:00] with a backup and a backup on your
[1:22:03] backup
[1:22:04] okay when he's looking like this when
[1:22:06] he's walking like this the mains flared
[1:22:08] the head's down the eyes and tent you
[1:22:10] don't stand in front of that and the
[1:22:12] scripture says this is there's three
[1:22:13] things four that walk like this and the
[1:22:15] first one they say is what a lion
[1:22:17] walking
[1:22:19] this is the Relentless King walking here
[1:22:21] now and as he walks as I said he doesn't
[1:22:23] back down he doesn't give away to
[1:22:24] anything if he's walking through the
[1:22:26] kingdom what does he do he's just
[1:22:28] walking straight on he doesn't look at
[1:22:30] brother George he doesn't look at
[1:22:32] brother Bob doesn't look at sister
[1:22:33] Justine he's just looking where he's
[1:22:34] going
[1:22:35] and then if he wants to turn around then
[1:22:38] he wants to turn around and brother
[1:22:39] George if he wants you to move what do
[1:22:42] you do move you move why because you see
[1:22:45] that look in his eyes and it doesn't
[1:22:47] Brook
[1:22:48] any sort of attitude
[1:22:51] you know what you do you know what
[1:22:52] happens when you give attitude to a lion
[1:22:55] you die without Mercy
[1:22:57] that's what he says there's nothing
[1:22:58] Walks Like a Lion on this Earth
[1:23:01] when it's walking through the kingdom it
[1:23:02] doesn't give any regard to anyone or
[1:23:04] anything it just goes where it wants and
[1:23:06] God help the person or the thing that
[1:23:08] gets in front of it
[1:23:09] This Is Our God Church
[1:23:11] when he is on the move when he's walking
[1:23:14] through the Kingdom look out
[1:23:16] because if you're not with them you're
[1:23:17] against them
[1:23:18] if you're not a part of the family
[1:23:20] you're going to be in trouble if you try
[1:23:21] and get in front of them amen
[1:23:24] what is it he's measured he's Regal the
[1:23:27] lion isn't flustered you don't see him
[1:23:29] all twitching and nervous as he's
[1:23:30] walking through he's just calm cool and
[1:23:33] collected because he knows who and what
[1:23:35] he is he's the king of all
[1:23:37] it's the king of all nothing will touch
[1:23:39] him Amos 3 a very familiar scripture
[1:23:41] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:23:43] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[1:23:46] servants the prophets that's what we
[1:23:47] just read in Revelation 10 7 was what
[1:23:49] God revealing his secret to his Prophet
[1:23:52] the lion roars and then the prophet
[1:23:54] comes to tell us what the lion said
[1:23:56] he says the lion hath roared who will
[1:23:58] not fear the lord God hath spoken who
[1:24:01] came but prophesy
[1:24:03] because what when the lion roars what
[1:24:05] happens to everything else they get
[1:24:06] quiet don't they they get nervous
[1:24:09] because they're not sure what's about to
[1:24:11] happen
[1:24:12] because when a lion roars what he's
[1:24:13] doing is he's declaring his territory
[1:24:15] he's there to let people know there's a
[1:24:17] lion here already you don't want to come
[1:24:19] in
[1:24:20] he's letting he's setting boundaries is
[1:24:22] what he's doing
[1:24:24] but you know who isn't scared when the
[1:24:25] lion roars
[1:24:27] his family
[1:24:28] when Daddy Roars little cubs aren't
[1:24:31] scared because that's just daddy talking
[1:24:33] now if he's roaring at you that's a
[1:24:36] little difference
[1:24:37] but you'll see that you'll know when
[1:24:39] he's roaring at you but when he's just
[1:24:40] roaring and there's nothing around
[1:24:42] what's he doing you know Daddy's
[1:24:44] protecting us
[1:24:45] Daddy's setting the boundaries dad's
[1:24:47] letting it be known he's got everything
[1:24:49] under his control and under his
[1:24:50] authority and look out
[1:24:52] because he's feeling real feisty today
[1:24:54] he's letting everybody know Daddy's on
[1:24:56] Daddy's up
[1:24:58] the King has awoken and he's hungry
[1:25:02] that's what he's saying he said and when
[1:25:04] he does it it's supposed to cause us to
[1:25:06] sit up and take notice
[1:25:08] because what when he Roars what happens
[1:25:10] he says who can but prophesy if there's
[1:25:12] a prophet in the land if there's an
[1:25:14] anointed vessel if there's an anointed
[1:25:15] Minister when he speaks then that man
[1:25:17] will catch it and you'll take it to the
[1:25:19] people because what God does it do if
[1:25:20] God's telling things and we can't hear
[1:25:22] it
[1:25:23] God doesn't speak without purpose God
[1:25:24] doesn't speak to hear himself say things
[1:25:26] he speaks and it's an anointed word and
[1:25:28] he takes it and he gives it to his
[1:25:30] servants the prophet so they can speak
[1:25:31] it to us so that we know what God's
[1:25:33] going to do what God's doing and what we
[1:25:35] have to do as a part of that amen it's
[1:25:37] not going to do us any good if he's
[1:25:38] roaring and we're not hearing anything
[1:25:40] but then there's another lion
[1:25:43] because first Peter 5 8 says be sober be
[1:25:46] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:25:48] devil he doesn't say a roaring lion he
[1:25:51] says as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:25:54] seeking whom he may devour there's only
[1:25:56] one true lion in The Bible and that's
[1:25:58] Christ that's God Amen that's the only
[1:26:00] King there and that's the only supreme
[1:26:02] ruler and in every instance it's Christ
[1:26:04] but then we see what we see an imitation
[1:26:06] we see an imposter that wants to be
[1:26:09] considered as a lion he wants to be a
[1:26:11] ruler he wants to have dominion he wants
[1:26:14] to strike fear into the hearts of those
[1:26:16] that are around him and so he's going
[1:26:18] around and he's trying to sound like a
[1:26:20] lion
[1:26:21] now here's the thing if you've never
[1:26:22] heard a lion and you hear something Roar
[1:26:25] in the jungle something make a really
[1:26:26] loud ferocious sound you might say
[1:26:28] that's probably a lion but when you hear
[1:26:30] a lion for the first time you'll know
[1:26:32] that that the devil's not a line ever
[1:26:34] again but if you've never met the lion
[1:26:36] you might be convinced don't go in there
[1:26:38] there's a line in there if somebody
[1:26:39] tells you but when you hear a lion and
[1:26:41] you know what a roar really sounds like
[1:26:43] you'll say hey
[1:26:44] that ain't a lion
[1:26:46] kind of curious what's in there now
[1:26:49] because why he's trying to make it sound
[1:26:51] like he's the Ferocious King of the
[1:26:52] Savannah when really scripture says
[1:26:55] we'll look narrowly on him we'll look
[1:26:57] down at him and say is this the man that
[1:26:58] troubled Nations
[1:27:00] because he's a little wimp with a big
[1:27:02] voice a little wimp with a big voice
[1:27:04] remember brother Brown said that and I
[1:27:07] believe the scripture says as well that
[1:27:08] he's under the feet he's under our feet
[1:27:12] everything is under our feet including
[1:27:14] him if we ever caught a glimpse of what
[1:27:16] Satan really is he's a puny little wimp
[1:27:20] with a big voice
[1:27:21] but he walks around like a roaring lion
[1:27:23] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:27:25] keep you out of your kingdom he's trying
[1:27:27] to keep you out of your land trying to
[1:27:28] keep you out of your property he's
[1:27:30] trying to keep you from going into what
[1:27:32] this book says belongs to you
[1:27:34] and so he Roars really really loudly he
[1:27:36] stays hidden though that's the worst
[1:27:38] thing you know they say that when it
[1:27:41] comes to to
[1:27:42] you know in in the military and when
[1:27:45] they're they're trying to get
[1:27:46] information out of people they say the
[1:27:47] threat
[1:27:48] of what you're going to do is far more
[1:27:50] effective than actually doing it
[1:27:55] on the Savannah
[1:27:57] sound and you see
[1:27:59] the the the stalks of grass moving but
[1:28:01] you don't see what's in there then what
[1:28:03] do you think you think the worst don't
[1:28:05] you you don't think it's a little deer
[1:28:08] or a bunny rabbit you think it's the
[1:28:10] biggest meanest animal that's out there
[1:28:12] and that's what Satan's doing is all
[1:28:13] he's doing is he's giving the impression
[1:28:15] of something large and Powerful moving
[1:28:17] there big noises making movement letting
[1:28:20] you know there's something out there and
[1:28:21] you can't see what it is because he's
[1:28:22] trying to keep you from finding out
[1:28:24] exactly who and what he is
[1:28:25] as a roaring lion he's not a king but
[1:28:28] he's trying to act like a king amen amen
[1:28:30] Satan makes a racket that's one thing
[1:28:32] Satan does is he makes a racket
[1:28:35] but there's nothing behind it amen but
[1:28:37] the beautiful thing is for everything
[1:28:38] Satan does God has a counter-attack God
[1:28:40] has something to show you the reality
[1:28:42] behind the situation amen and that's why
[1:28:44] in this last stage where what under a
[1:28:46] prophetic anointing we're under an eagle
[1:28:47] anointing because what now you can get
[1:28:49] above it and when you get above it you
[1:28:51] can see it for what it is
[1:28:52] when you're down on ground like a man
[1:28:54] remember under under Luther it was a man
[1:28:56] anointing you can only see so far but
[1:28:59] when you're flying on the heights of
[1:29:00] Revelation you can see everything
[1:29:01] nothing's hidden from the eyes of the
[1:29:03] eagle is it they can go as high as they
[1:29:05] want to stay safe and they can still see
[1:29:07] with perfect vision all the way down to
[1:29:08] the ground to find out what it is that's
[1:29:10] moving down there amen
[1:29:13] brother Brown says this and then another
[1:29:15] thing I believe that when Satan which
[1:29:18] was prophesied would go about like a
[1:29:20] roaring lion in the last days to destroy
[1:29:21] mortal life and spiritual life and
[1:29:23] everything that he could I believe then
[1:29:25] if all the dumpings of all the evil is
[1:29:28] being dumped out on the human race in
[1:29:29] this day I believe that all the
[1:29:31] blessings will be dumped out as it was
[1:29:33] or poured out rather by our heavenly
[1:29:35] father upon the church in these last
[1:29:38] days it says what a day we're living in
[1:29:40] we look and we say and I've just said it
[1:29:42] it's it's it's it's a horrible time this
[1:29:44] laodicea
[1:29:45] right the sexual immorality the the
[1:29:48] political immorality the financial
[1:29:50] immorality the the relationships and the
[1:29:52] things that they're trying to say are
[1:29:53] normal it's it's disgusting it's
[1:29:56] horrible and brother but I'm saying if
[1:29:57] all of that is being poured out then
[1:29:59] there has to be an opposite amount being
[1:30:01] poured out to counteract it not only an
[1:30:04] equal amount but a greater than amount
[1:30:06] amen remember when the enemy comes in
[1:30:08] like a flood then the spirit of God will
[1:30:09] raise up a standard and brother Brown
[1:30:11] said that's the holy spirit being poured
[1:30:13] in to counteract what Satan's throwing
[1:30:15] at you right
[1:30:16] that's what we're looking at he's saying
[1:30:18] that's the pouring out we need
[1:30:20] there's going to be a short quick work
[1:30:22] that happens in all of this and it'll be
[1:30:24] when God pours out that last great
[1:30:25] anointing on the church and nothing will
[1:30:28] be able to stand in front of us then
[1:30:29] nothing can now
[1:30:31] but it'll be about it'll be a greater
[1:30:33] power demonstration than we've seen
[1:30:34] today except in the perhaps the ministry
[1:30:37] of Christ and brother Branham himself
[1:30:38] and these things amen by saying there's
[1:30:40] a pouring out that God has for us amen
[1:30:43] so when we feel like we're overwhelmed
[1:30:44] when we feel like it's been too much
[1:30:46] it's been too long
[1:30:48] just know if you don't have the victory
[1:30:50] yet there's more coming
[1:30:52] there's more to have there's more to be
[1:30:54] had there's more to do there's more
[1:30:56] Victory ahead we sing that song Victory
[1:30:58] ahead Victory ahead
[1:30:59] Victory is ahead folks because the king
[1:31:02] is here amen
[1:31:04] what did we hear
[1:31:06] we read in Revelation 10 where that lion
[1:31:08] roared and we we saw God and he was
[1:31:10] reading out of that book and what was he
[1:31:12] doing
[1:31:13] he's calling out names
[1:31:15] not just names but he's calling out
[1:31:17] property descriptions
[1:31:19] who's calling out what belongs to you
[1:31:21] who's calling out Redemptive blessings
[1:31:23] and he was attaching it to the name
[1:31:25] who's that was written next to those
[1:31:26] things amen because it's not just for
[1:31:28] one there's only one person it's not
[1:31:31] just one person the church gets healing
[1:31:32] and everyone else doesn't those are
[1:31:34] Redemptive they're for all they're for
[1:31:36] all of us amen but then he looks next to
[1:31:39] your name and he's calling your name and
[1:31:40] the first name maybe he called was Mark
[1:31:42] Coffey
[1:31:43] and he called my coffee and what was it
[1:31:45] it wasn't a lamb calling it was a lion
[1:31:46] roaring and he was calling out Mark
[1:31:48] coffin he ripped off the Seal of Mark
[1:31:50] coffey's life and now Mark coffee is
[1:31:52] looking at that and he's starting to
[1:31:54] read and he's starting to be quick and
[1:31:55] this is me this is me this is me oh my
[1:31:58] goodness I need to be baptized in the
[1:31:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I need to
[1:32:01] cut my hair I need to get rid of my
[1:32:02] music I need to get into fellowship and
[1:32:04] all these things and what is it it's the
[1:32:06] lion roaring and he's hearing it called
[1:32:08] out and he says that's me I'm our coffee
[1:32:10] over here
[1:32:11] why because the line is wrong he's
[1:32:13] taking possession he's letting it be
[1:32:15] known that he's in the business of
[1:32:17] restoration now as we heard brother John
[1:32:19] speaking about amen it's not a mild or
[1:32:21] Meek call
[1:32:22] it's irresistible it catches your
[1:32:24] attention
[1:32:25] the bleeding of a lamb won't get your
[1:32:27] attention but the Roar of a lion will
[1:32:28] especially if you recognize that's my
[1:32:30] daddy and that's what's going on Amen
[1:32:32] what's he doing he let him know brother
[1:32:34] Mark it's your time it's your age it's
[1:32:37] your season it's your time of life it's
[1:32:39] time for you to bring forth what's
[1:32:41] written in this book and brother Mark
[1:32:42] couldn't have done it on his own until
[1:32:44] that moment but as soon as God spoke as
[1:32:46] soon as the lion roars then life can
[1:32:48] come forth and now you can start to step
[1:32:50] onto your property now you can see
[1:32:52] what's written about you in this great
[1:32:53] book of redemption amen what did he do
[1:32:56] he wrote it before Mark Coffey was ever
[1:32:57] born
[1:32:58] before was ever born it was sealed
[1:33:00] that's the beauty of it it was sealed
[1:33:02] you can't change it you can't change it
[1:33:04] can't add to it you can't take away from
[1:33:06] it because it's sealed but as soon as he
[1:33:08] starts reading it the word Goes Forth
[1:33:10] and the word is Anointed and it will do
[1:33:11] what it said it is going to do reminds
[1:33:14] me of those I don't know if they still
[1:33:15] have them anymore but the Energizer
[1:33:17] Bunny commercials commercials remember
[1:33:19] the Energizer batteries and they've got
[1:33:21] that rabbit that goes around and keeps
[1:33:22] beating the drum and it says it just
[1:33:24] keeps going and going and going and he
[1:33:25] just keeps walking around around they
[1:33:27] have some competitors batteries powering
[1:33:29] the same thing and He Flops over and
[1:33:30] falls over that's what the word of God
[1:33:32] is like it goes and it goes and it goes
[1:33:34] and it goes until it achieves what it
[1:33:36] was set forth to do because it's
[1:33:38] anointed to do it amen the word is
[1:33:40] Anointed everything else Falls
[1:33:42] but he says not one jot not one Tittle
[1:33:44] is going to fail of the words that I
[1:33:46] send forth amen so it's what it's not a
[1:33:48] work that Mark Coffey started
[1:33:50] so work that God started
[1:33:52] so it's not going to be a work that Mark
[1:33:53] Coffey finishes because the work's
[1:33:55] already finished in the book
[1:33:57] and all he's got to do is recognize his
[1:33:59] partner
[1:34:00] who and what he is that's all he's doing
[1:34:02] that's what the faith for us to do is to
[1:34:03] read our portion of the book and say
[1:34:05] that's mine that's me not just mine
[1:34:07] because everybody wants stuff but how
[1:34:09] many of us want me as in I want to be
[1:34:11] what he says I am that's what we're
[1:34:13] looking for in our lives amen because
[1:34:15] you look here Christ has been dormant I
[1:34:17] use the term loosely since here
[1:34:19] they kicked him out
[1:34:21] right and then they went to the Nicene
[1:34:23] Council and they kicked them out even
[1:34:24] more and more and more and we went down
[1:34:25] and then we come back in here and we
[1:34:27] start to come up again but through from
[1:34:29] here to here there's almost nothing
[1:34:30] almost nothing God just wasn't doing
[1:34:32] anything because it was man getting
[1:34:34] further and further away but God knew it
[1:34:36] and he accounted for it and now he comes
[1:34:38] back in here and we've got the same
[1:34:39] anointing here that they had there
[1:34:40] potentially
[1:34:43] potentially you may not have it now but
[1:34:45] you're going to have it if you don't
[1:34:46] have it a man because he's pouring it
[1:34:48] out and he's pouring it out but he's
[1:34:49] what he's coming back to here and that's
[1:34:50] what he why he had to open the word he
[1:34:52] had to give us the same thing that they
[1:34:53] had back there because what what It
[1:34:55] produced there it'll produce here but
[1:34:57] it'll just continue on because what the
[1:34:59] the seals are open now it can take us
[1:35:01] all the way through into the fullness of
[1:35:02] redemption amen
[1:35:04] amen but I want you to catch this
[1:35:07] morning while we're talking about this
[1:35:08] line anointing why it's a line roaring
[1:35:11] and a lion prevailing and not a lamb and
[1:35:13] it's because the lion is what he's
[1:35:14] supposed to give you courage
[1:35:16] supposed to Quicken you supposed to get
[1:35:19] you to wake up he's supposed to give you
[1:35:20] rest in who and what he is because
[1:35:22] you're a part of his family
[1:35:24] right supposed to give you a calmness
[1:35:26] and a security that everything is going
[1:35:28] to work out all right even though maybe
[1:35:30] it doesn't seem like it because Daddy's
[1:35:32] on the scene the king is on the scene
[1:35:34] you know so often you look through
[1:35:35] history and the King just sat back and
[1:35:37] got fat and lazy and took taxes from The
[1:35:39] Peasants and and ran him into the ground
[1:35:41] and didn't really care about them this
[1:35:42] is not the king that we have he is up
[1:35:44] and he is moving and he is working in
[1:35:46] his church to achieve what he said he
[1:35:48] was going to do in her amen hey man
[1:35:50] you're a part of his family and what is
[1:35:52] he doing he's coming as a lion to take
[1:35:54] what power and authority over anything
[1:35:56] anything that would hold you back from
[1:35:59] coming into your position and place in
[1:36:00] Christ
[1:36:01] he's listen God's determined
[1:36:04] God's purpose
[1:36:06] way before you ever did what you did
[1:36:08] yesterday way before you ever failed or
[1:36:10] fell or said this or didn't say that did
[1:36:12] this didn't do that way before it was
[1:36:15] done and all he's doing now is he's
[1:36:16] purpose to make it happen in your life
[1:36:18] you can't stop it praise the Lord you
[1:36:20] can't stop it I can't stop it God's
[1:36:23] gonna do what he's purposed to do
[1:36:24] brother Bob says this God's purpose can
[1:36:27] never be defeated
[1:36:29] so if you know what his purpose is don't
[1:36:32] get in the way
[1:36:34] don't get in the way
[1:36:36] because it's not he's not going to
[1:36:37] choose you over his word you get out of
[1:36:39] the way you get in front of him you're
[1:36:41] going to get steamrolled because the
[1:36:42] lion gives way for No One
[1:36:44] the word doesn't stop because you're a
[1:36:45] child
[1:36:46] the word will correct you and bring you
[1:36:48] back to where you need to be God's
[1:36:49] purpose can never be defeated there is
[1:36:52] nothing can defeat it
[1:36:54] so how happy are we to be today resting
[1:36:57] upon that beautiful revelation of the
[1:36:59] word of the Living God that there's
[1:37:00] neither things present nor things that
[1:37:02] can come there's no sickness no sorrow
[1:37:04] no death no perils nor nothing can
[1:37:07] separate us from the purpose of the
[1:37:09] Living God when God what God has
[1:37:12] imagined in his mind what God has
[1:37:14] purpose in his heart to bring to pass
[1:37:16] there is no demon there's no power there
[1:37:18] is nothing can ever separate God's Great
[1:37:21] Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God
[1:37:24] has said this is not a lamb's attitude
[1:37:27] church this is the lion's attitude he
[1:37:29] says it's going to happen and I'm going
[1:37:31] to make sure that it happens amen what
[1:37:34] is it he's coming for and he says I pay
[1:37:36] the price now I'm coming to get it now
[1:37:38] I'm coming to enforce what I paid the
[1:37:40] price for and nothing's going to stop me
[1:37:42] nothing's going to separate us from the
[1:37:43] love of God that's what Paul said
[1:37:46] nothing
[1:37:47] why he always is moving with purpose God
[1:37:50] doesn't just roam around Satan's a
[1:37:52] roamer
[1:37:53] you know what he said in the days of job
[1:37:54] raw mean to and fro That's what Satan
[1:37:57] does God doesn't do that God goes here
[1:37:59] and he does what he said he was going to
[1:38:00] do then he goes there and here and there
[1:38:01] he moves with purpose he doesn't he
[1:38:03] doesn't get frazzled he doesn't get
[1:38:04] frustrated he doesn't get overworked God
[1:38:07] just moves with purpose and he knows
[1:38:08] exactly what he's doing every time he's
[1:38:10] very deliberate God is deliberate and
[1:38:12] when God decides something's going to
[1:38:13] happen it happens and it happens fast
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:17] I want to put this into a bit of a a
[1:38:20] night nice little bow tied package here
[1:38:22] because I want you to see what this
[1:38:24] looks like in in real life and back in
[1:38:27] Exodus 23 God was speaking to Moses and
[1:38:29] he's speaking prophetically what's going
[1:38:30] to happen to Moses he's telling them
[1:38:32] what's going to happen and God is
[1:38:33] showing his lie inside
[1:38:35] and look at this in Exodus 23 20 he says
[1:38:37] behold I send an angel before thee to
[1:38:40] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[1:38:42] into the place which I have prepared so
[1:38:44] what was that angel it was a pillar of
[1:38:46] fire wasn't it notice it's a capital A
[1:38:48] this is not an angel this is the Angel
[1:38:51] this is Christ himself in the pillar of
[1:38:54] fire amen and he says I've sent them for
[1:38:56] two purposes first to keep you
[1:38:59] keep you in his way
[1:39:01] that's the purpose of the presence of
[1:39:03] Christ that's the purpose of the
[1:39:05] presence of the holy spirit in our life
[1:39:06] is to keep us on the straight and narrow
[1:39:08] to take us to where we're supposed to go
[1:39:10] but then he says then it's the brainly
[1:39:12] to the place I have prepared so as to
[1:39:14] keep you safe as you go and to bring you
[1:39:16] to where he wants you to be
[1:39:19] amen but after they cross over you
[1:39:21] notice this Angel he disappears
[1:39:24] he's no longer going before them in the
[1:39:26] pillar fire but he's still there isn't
[1:39:28] he and when he crosses over what does he
[1:39:30] look like
[1:39:31] the captain of the host and he has what
[1:39:34] a sword drawn right this is not a lamb
[1:39:37] anointing anymore now it's a line
[1:39:39] anointing what he's leading them into
[1:39:40] battle
[1:39:41] he's securing the victory for them
[1:39:44] he says beware of him and obey his voice
[1:39:47] provoke him not remember that picture we
[1:39:49] showed of that lion stalking you want to
[1:39:51] be aware of that lion don't you don't
[1:39:53] provoke a lion
[1:39:54] don't say don't don't don't tug on his
[1:39:57] tail don't nip on his hindquarters
[1:40:00] because what you provoke him he's going
[1:40:02] to lash out that be very respectful of
[1:40:05] the Big Daddy lion
[1:40:07] beware of him obey his voice provoke him
[1:40:09] not for he will not pardon your
[1:40:11] transgressions for my name is in him I
[1:40:13] saw a clip of a of a daddy lion and uh
[1:40:16] the Cubs were all over him and he kind
[1:40:17] of you know a couple times to let him
[1:40:19] know it wasn't right and then he turned
[1:40:21] around he just went
[1:40:23] enough's enough right they didn't
[1:40:25] respect him and he was not having it
[1:40:27] because I mean if you ever had even
[1:40:29] little puppies you know they have those
[1:40:30] sharp little needle teeth I imagine it's
[1:40:32] even worse for Lions because they have
[1:40:33] claws and sharp needle teeth anyways he
[1:40:35] had enough he just swatted them away
[1:40:36] right leave me alone
[1:40:39] I feel like him sometimes
[1:40:42] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:40:44] praise the Lord
[1:40:45] children if Thou shalt indeed obey his
[1:40:48] voice
[1:40:49] and do all that I speak then I will be
[1:40:51] an enemy unto thine enemies and an
[1:40:53] adversary unto thine adversaries for
[1:40:55] mine Angels shall go before thee and
[1:40:57] bring me into the amorites and the
[1:40:58] Hittites and the parasites and the
[1:40:59] Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites
[1:41:02] and I will cut them off
[1:41:04] brother Brahm says this this is history
[1:41:07] church this is history this is a long
[1:41:09] time ago
[1:41:10] brother Brian says God has never changed
[1:41:14] just the same today as he was then God
[1:41:17] is determined to do something he'll do
[1:41:20] it nothing's going to stop him he'll do
[1:41:22] it
[1:41:24] therefore when God does anything or
[1:41:26] makes a decision as I've often quoted
[1:41:28] that he always has to stay with his
[1:41:30] decision
[1:41:31] how that ought to Enlighten our faith
[1:41:33] see when God says something all heavens
[1:41:36] and Earths will pass away but that
[1:41:38] cannot pass away therefore it should
[1:41:40] give us character
[1:41:43] it should give us Faith to take that
[1:41:46] word which he has said and with all of
[1:41:48] our life hold on to it
[1:41:51] because he cannot change it it's true
[1:41:55] scripture says that God is not a man
[1:41:56] that he should lie
[1:41:58] there's no shadow of variableness nor
[1:42:00] turning in him
[1:42:02] when he says he's going to do it he's
[1:42:03] going to do it and you just gotta hold
[1:42:05] on
[1:42:06] he's got to hold on that's the trial of
[1:42:08] our faith every time
[1:42:10] verse 27 says I will send my fear before
[1:42:12] thee
[1:42:14] we think oh the the great bride the
[1:42:16] great bride she's going to do this and
[1:42:18] that listen if you think it's ever you
[1:42:20] shake your head and probably don't even
[1:42:21] go out to battle because he says I'll
[1:42:23] send my fear before you and destroy all
[1:42:26] the people to whom Thou shalt come and I
[1:42:28] will make all thine enemies turn their
[1:42:30] backs under thee he says I'm going to
[1:42:31] make them all run away now this is the
[1:42:33] king speaking
[1:42:34] this is what a king looks like amen this
[1:42:36] is the all-powerful god this is the
[1:42:38] promised Giver the Waymaker the the
[1:42:41] jailbreaking the delivering God speaking
[1:42:43] now this is what it looks like
[1:42:45] he says and I will send Hornets before
[1:42:47] thee which shall drive out the hivite
[1:42:49] the Canaanite the hittite from before
[1:42:51] Thee I will not drive them out before
[1:42:53] thee in one year lest the lamb become
[1:42:55] desolate and the beasts of the field
[1:42:56] multiply against thee now we preached on
[1:42:58] this before but sometimes we say God why
[1:43:00] don't you just clean us all up why don't
[1:43:02] you just
[1:43:03] just wipe Satan's influence out of my
[1:43:05] life take everything away heal me you
[1:43:08] know save me fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:10] give me perfect relationship give me
[1:43:12] perfect family give me per no no no he
[1:43:15] says I'm gonna go bit by bit
[1:43:16] he says because otherwise if I drive it
[1:43:18] all out in one stop in one move he says
[1:43:20] then the Beast will come in attracted by
[1:43:22] all the dead bodies in the dead and
[1:43:24] you'll have a real problem on your hands
[1:43:25] he says you can't leave things empty you
[1:43:27] got to fill it as you go and that's what
[1:43:29] God does for us is he takes something
[1:43:31] out and then he fills it doesn't he word
[1:43:33] by word line upon line here little there
[1:43:35] little that's the way God moves in a
[1:43:36] believer's life and then sometimes he
[1:43:38] does a real work a supernatural work
[1:43:40] it's all Supernatural but he'll do a uh
[1:43:43] you know I think brother John was
[1:43:44] talking about it the difference between
[1:43:45] healing and a miracle sometimes he does
[1:43:47] a miracle in our lives and you get
[1:43:49] instant Deliverance
[1:43:51] but that's not the way he normally works
[1:43:53] it's all Supernatural but it's not
[1:43:55] always a miracle sometimes it's bit by
[1:43:57] bit the way he's talking about here
[1:43:58] still a line anointing still a concrete
[1:44:01] still a victory anointing but it's bit
[1:44:03] by bit sometimes so that you can handle
[1:44:06] you're able to control you're able to
[1:44:08] hold on to the land that he takes for
[1:44:10] you
[1:44:12] he says by little and little I will
[1:44:14] drive them out from before thee now
[1:44:16] notice you're there but he's the one
[1:44:18] doing the driving
[1:44:19] he says until thou be increased and
[1:44:22] inherit the land so notice he's driving
[1:44:23] them out but who's the ones doing the
[1:44:25] fighting
[1:44:26] the Israelites sometimes we think we're
[1:44:28] the ones doing the fighting therefore
[1:44:29] we're the ones getting the victory no no
[1:44:31] no no no no he's going before us to
[1:44:33] secure the victory but it looks a whole
[1:44:34] lot like work doesn't it because it's a
[1:44:37] battle every day
[1:44:38] it's a battle every day because he's
[1:44:39] still got to produce a bribe with
[1:44:40] character and this is what it looks like
[1:44:42] amen so don't ever think that it's just
[1:44:45] you but on the flip side don't ever
[1:44:46] think that God doesn't use you
[1:44:49] because you're fighting he's just making
[1:44:51] sure you win
[1:44:53] right
[1:44:54] that's right you've still gotta fight
[1:44:55] you've still got to hold your sword you
[1:44:58] still got to use it but he's the one
[1:45:00] that enforces what you're using
[1:45:02] because when you use his word it can't
[1:45:04] return void that's why you use the word
[1:45:06] that's why Christ used that against
[1:45:07] Satan was he showed that that's the only
[1:45:09] thing you need
[1:45:11] you don't need programs you don't need
[1:45:12] great this or wonderful that or huge no
[1:45:15] no you need to take the word and apply
[1:45:16] it the way it's written and that'll
[1:45:18] secure the victory every single time
[1:45:19] amen that's why we have such a focus on
[1:45:21] the word in the message is because that
[1:45:23] is what we need to secure the victory
[1:45:25] this is what tells us who and what we
[1:45:27] are it tells us how to get what we need
[1:45:29] to have because it's God that's given it
[1:45:31] to us it's not just me taking it it's
[1:45:32] God telling me to take it it's God
[1:45:34] telling me to go and possess the land
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:37] but notice here he says what I will
[1:45:40] drive them out let me say it this way if
[1:45:42] you're not driving them out then maybe
[1:45:44] consider that you're not walking in the
[1:45:45] path that the Angel's leading
[1:45:47] because if you keep getting defeated
[1:45:49] what does that tell you
[1:45:51] God's not with you
[1:45:53] if you keep losing then it means God's
[1:45:56] not in the situation so you got to get
[1:45:58] God in the situation and sometimes
[1:46:00] getting God in this situation is you
[1:46:01] actually getting out of the situation
[1:46:02] back away back away you're not where you
[1:46:05] need to be so get away get back in the
[1:46:07] path and that's where the angel of the
[1:46:09] Lord will be that's where the Holy
[1:46:10] Spirit can anoint you to do what you're
[1:46:11] supposed to do but if you keep insisting
[1:46:13] on losing then God just says well he
[1:46:15] enjoys losing she enjoys losing she
[1:46:17] enjoys what she's doing he enjoys what
[1:46:19] he's doing so much more than they enjoy
[1:46:21] me so I'm just going to let them sit
[1:46:22] there and get beat up been there done
[1:46:24] that
[1:46:25] till you finally say
[1:46:27] enough
[1:46:28] enough
[1:46:30] no more no Moss
[1:46:33] and you come back to him
[1:46:35] because he can't come down that path
[1:46:37] remember brother John preached on the
[1:46:38] prodigal son he had to come to himself
[1:46:40] he had to come to himself to the point
[1:46:42] where he says this is not the way a son
[1:46:44] or a daughter of God is living because
[1:46:45] he didn't have the victory did he they
[1:46:47] wouldn't even give him the corn husks
[1:46:48] they were giving the swine
[1:46:50] you get to you get to such a point where
[1:46:52] you're not being fed and you don't have
[1:46:53] anything and you and you keep saying you
[1:46:55] got the holy spirit in your life and you
[1:46:56] say but the fruits aren't there
[1:46:58] so go back to where you left them go
[1:47:00] back to the last place you had them
[1:47:02] because that's probably where he is
[1:47:03] standing there because you did something
[1:47:04] of your own your own choosing amen and
[1:47:06] again I speak from experience I'm not
[1:47:08] preaching down to anyone I'm preaching
[1:47:09] to myself
[1:47:11] that brother Bram says it this way
[1:47:16] the devil's wrong and God Is Right
[1:47:20] God is right so if you're not on God's
[1:47:22] side you're wrong
[1:47:24] again speaking by experience
[1:47:27] it will always be that way the devil
[1:47:30] will lose and God will always win
[1:47:33] so that's why I say if you keep losing
[1:47:35] there's something wrong
[1:47:37] because God always wins in the end
[1:47:40] there are setbacks listen the Second
[1:47:42] Battle they had in Canaan they lost
[1:47:44] didn't they why because somebody got out
[1:47:46] of the will of God they disobeyed the
[1:47:48] word and it pulled the whole
[1:47:49] congregation back and hope pulled the
[1:47:51] whole church back
[1:47:52] but as soon as they corrected it victory
[1:47:54] was theirs again
[1:47:56] no problems as long as you stay with the
[1:47:58] word
[1:48:00] he says so if you're wrong you're on the
[1:48:02] wrong side you're sure to lose and if
[1:48:04] you're on the right side you're on God's
[1:48:06] side notice how because we say I'm right
[1:48:09] no no no are you on God's right what God
[1:48:13] says is right listen I thought I was
[1:48:15] right plenty times in my life I wasn't
[1:48:16] right
[1:48:18] I'm Still Human
[1:48:20] still subject to like passions amen
[1:48:23] sometimes we're wrong and we got to
[1:48:25] Humble ourselves and say clearly I'm
[1:48:27] wrong because the victory isn't there
[1:48:30] if you're on the right side you're on
[1:48:32] God's side and you're sure to win you
[1:48:34] can't lose now God's plan is laid out in
[1:48:37] his Bible and this is what we must go by
[1:48:39] it must come from his word because my
[1:48:41] words will fail I'm a man but God's word
[1:48:44] can't fail because it's God
[1:48:47] he said so will it be when the coming of
[1:48:49] the Lord will come again God's word is
[1:48:52] infallible what he said would take place
[1:48:54] will take place there's nothing can stop
[1:48:56] it no hindrance can stop it
[1:48:59] what hindrances do you have in your life
[1:49:00] today
[1:49:01] what's holding you back what's bugging
[1:49:03] you what's bothering you what's
[1:49:04] frustrating you
[1:49:06] he says no hindrance will stop it no
[1:49:08] matter how times change have times
[1:49:10] changed
[1:49:11] brother Gerald have times changed
[1:49:13] times have changed since he was born
[1:49:16] times have changed since I was born
[1:49:17] times have changed since my kids were
[1:49:19] born
[1:49:20] times have changed since Samuel was born
[1:49:23] that's how fast things are changing he
[1:49:25] says it doesn't matter how much times
[1:49:26] change
[1:49:27] how people change have people changed
[1:49:30] absolutely they change with the times
[1:49:32] don't they change with the seasons
[1:49:34] change with the weather
[1:49:36] these days
[1:49:37] he says no matter how preachers change
[1:49:40] how churches change God's word will
[1:49:43] remain it's going to come he'll be here
[1:49:45] he'll come in his glory with all of his
[1:49:47] angels that's right God's word said so
[1:49:49] and someday every individual sitting in
[1:49:51] this room today will bear record and
[1:49:54] seeing him coming in glory now listen to
[1:49:55] this he'll be coming to your joy or to
[1:49:59] your sorrow one or the other that's
[1:50:01] right he's got to come God's word is
[1:50:04] infallible amen I want to be joyful at
[1:50:07] his appearing amen amen I want to be
[1:50:09] ready to go
[1:50:10] you know with with my grandmother and I
[1:50:12] you know um she's got I didn't mention
[1:50:14] at the beginning of service I don't
[1:50:15] think but she's got RSV she's got that
[1:50:17] respiratory virus now so she's been
[1:50:19] doing much better with her impacted
[1:50:21] bowel and whatnot or obstructive bow
[1:50:24] so that seems to be sort of resolving
[1:50:27] itself but now she's got RSV and and so
[1:50:30] um
[1:50:31] you know we're just trusting that the
[1:50:33] Lord will will work in that but uh where
[1:50:35] was I going with that I said I was going
[1:50:37] to say that for a reason but anyways I
[1:50:40] want to show you just this one last
[1:50:41] quote amen now I want to show you what
[1:50:43] this looks like and because we show what
[1:50:45] what the lion anointing looks like as
[1:50:46] they were going into Canaan
[1:50:48] and we want to show what it looks like
[1:50:50] when the lion reads from the open book
[1:50:53] from the book that's been unsealed
[1:50:54] because we've seen him Roar
[1:50:57] we've seen them more not just heard them
[1:50:59] but we've seen what that looks like amen
[1:51:00] and you know it struck me as I was
[1:51:02] studying this because we've got at work
[1:51:04] we have what we call living documents
[1:51:06] and a living document is a document
[1:51:08] that's not locked so you can come in and
[1:51:11] you can add to it and you can take away
[1:51:12] from it it's a living document you can
[1:51:14] adjust it so I have for my performance
[1:51:17] every year my performance review at the
[1:51:18] beginning of year I say this is what I'm
[1:51:20] going to do and if I do it then I get a
[1:51:21] good performance review but it's a
[1:51:23] living document I can change my mind
[1:51:25] throughout the year with my director's
[1:51:26] approval as to what I'm trying to
[1:51:28] achieve throughout the year so it's a
[1:51:29] living document so I can change the
[1:51:31] standard by which I'm judged
[1:51:33] now we've got another living document
[1:51:34] but this is not that kind of a living
[1:51:36] document because it's sealed he can't
[1:51:38] add to it and he can't take away from it
[1:51:39] amen but it's living why because there's
[1:51:42] power behind it there's a life behind it
[1:51:44] that's what makes it living and it comes
[1:51:46] with power it comes with authority it
[1:51:47] comes with peace comes with rest comes
[1:51:49] with love comes with joy comes with
[1:51:51] Mercy forgiveness all these things that
[1:51:53] is the life that we're looking for amen
[1:51:55] it's not just words on a page and so
[1:51:57] when we have a lion that's roaring out
[1:51:59] of this book it's supposed to have an
[1:52:01] impact
[1:52:01] there's supposed to be a life that comes
[1:52:03] with it amen they're supposed to be
[1:52:05] Victory they're supposed to come power
[1:52:06] and authority and deliverance and and
[1:52:09] these different things it's all supposed
[1:52:10] to happen when he Roars because it's
[1:52:12] supposed to bring an effect God doesn't
[1:52:15] speak without purpose amen and so what
[1:52:17] it's not just to have things happen in
[1:52:19] this Earth but it's to happen in people
[1:52:21] just like you and just like me that's
[1:52:23] what we're looking for is a living
[1:52:24] document inside of us that has what the
[1:52:27] effect that this word says it's supposed
[1:52:29] to have amen
[1:52:31] brother brother Brown says God never
[1:52:32] changes
[1:52:34] what had that to do us if you can truly
[1:52:36] believe it this morning God never
[1:52:38] changes what he did for others he'll do
[1:52:40] for you amen amen
[1:52:42] amen we're going to close with just this
[1:52:44] this it's it's a long quote but just
[1:52:45] stick with me man this is the lion
[1:52:47] roaring
[1:52:49] brother Brown's preaching he's at the
[1:52:51] end of a service he says I wonder if
[1:52:52] that Minister's sitting there the elder
[1:52:53] brother that's been preaching for 65
[1:52:55] years would do me a favor I wonder how
[1:52:57] old that guy was
[1:52:58] preaching for 65 years he says will you

[1:53:09] that's all what did she touch I've never
[1:53:12] seen her but it happened if thou can't

[1:53:27] scientist or nothing can stop him he is

[1:53:33] Lord hallelujah thank you Lord

[1:58:00] son of David have mercy on me
[1:58:04] let's stand together if we would
[1:58:14] amen we were speaking on Redemption and
[1:58:17] we're going to be speaking on it a while
[1:58:19] but I wanted to start with this
[1:58:21] because when we start talking about the
[1:58:23] the abstract title deed and we start
[1:58:25] talking about property rights and we
[1:58:27] start talking about what God has given
[1:58:29] for you so often our tendency is to look
[1:58:31] to ourselves
[1:58:32] and say I'm unworthy I'm unable I'm I'm
[1:58:35] not strong enough I'm too weak I fall I
[1:58:37] fail I've tried I've tried it's never
[1:58:39] worked
[1:58:40] why so often it's because we're looking
[1:58:42] at ourselves
[1:58:44] but I want you to start with the lion
[1:58:45] anointing
[1:58:47] the line of 19 is not on you
[1:58:49] the line anointing is on him
[1:58:51] amen and you've got to trust that he's
[1:58:53] going to do what he said Remember When
[1:58:54] Naomi and Ruth were talking after Ruth
[1:58:56] came back from meeting with Boaz at the
[1:58:58] threshing floor and Naomi assured her
[1:59:00] she says he will not rest
[1:59:02] he will not rest
[1:59:03] until he's got you until he's done
[1:59:06] everything that he said he would do
[1:59:09] scripture talks about dohitary
[1:59:12] and he will Terry wait rest Trust
[1:59:16] don't get worried don't get frustrated
[1:59:18] don't get all up in arms because he's
[1:59:19] not doing it in your time
[1:59:21] just know that he's got it all in
[1:59:23] control he's got a time appointed for
[1:59:25] every single one of these things amen
[1:59:27] and whether it's children out in the
[1:59:29] world whether it's your personal health
[1:59:30] whether it's family relationships
[1:59:32] whether it's finances whether it's the
[1:59:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost that you need
[1:59:35] in your life God has a time and a place
[1:59:38] for it and if your name is in that book
[1:59:40] He's not going to rest until he's
[1:59:42] finished what he said he was going to do
[1:59:43] amen it's his work
[1:59:45] you're the benefactor stop trying to
[1:59:48] make it happen and just say Lord I'm
[1:59:51] depending on you I'm trusting on you you
[1:59:53] stay in the right atmosphere you stay
[1:59:55] with the right friends stay with the
[1:59:56] right Fellowship stay under the hearing
[1:59:58] of the word you do what he's asked you
[2:00:00] to do
[2:00:01] and then he takes care of the rest
[2:00:02] that's all he has to do the final stage
[2:00:04] of Ruth was not possession it was rest
[2:00:09] and then she went into relationship and
[2:00:11] that's where everything happened rest
[2:00:13] led to relationship and that's when she
[2:00:15] was able to get everything she had all
[2:00:17] he wants is you
[2:00:18] he wants that relationship restored and
[2:00:20] when he gets that everything else
[2:00:21] follows him behind it amen he's moving
[2:00:24] he's moving
[2:00:26] but he's got a plan
[2:00:28] and we don't always understand it we
[2:00:29] don't always see it but he has a plan
[2:00:31] he's moving with purpose when the lion
[2:00:33] moves he doesn't Rush
[2:00:35] until he has to rush
[2:00:38] he'll move so slowly so calmly but when
[2:00:40] he moves into action they say it's the
[2:00:42] he's the fastest accelerating animal on
[2:00:44] the earth faster than a cheetah for the
[2:00:46] first three strides
[2:00:47] he's got all the power there and that's
[2:00:49] his that's his weapon is that he can go
[2:00:51] from nothing to everything in one moment
[2:00:52] he can go from Stand still to 30 miles
[2:00:55] an hour in three steps that's how quick
[2:00:57] the line is That's The Power of the Lion
[2:00:59] but you don't think it sometimes because
[2:01:00] he walks so calmly and coolly so
[2:01:03] collected so Majestic but when he moves
[2:01:05] look out
[2:01:06] that's what that's how he catches the
[2:01:08] animals they don't think he can get to
[2:01:09] them that fast listen he can get into
[2:01:11] your situation faster make your head
[2:01:13] spin how fast God can step in
[2:01:16] but it's in his time
[2:01:17] that's the thing we just got to trust
[2:01:18] it's in his time amen let's bow our
[2:01:20] heads each one
[2:01:22] Heavenly Father
[2:01:25] Barbara so thankful that we have a place
[2:01:27] of rest this morning

[2:01:39] been the spouse maybe it's been the job
[2:01:41] Lord maybe it's just been a little bit
[2:01:43] cold in our life and our relationship
[2:01:45] with you Heavenly Father
[2:01:46] Lord Satan wants nothing better than to
[2:01:48] get us looking at ourselves
[2:01:50] but Lord we want to look to the mighty
[2:01:52] king Lord the great lion Lord the one

[2:09:59] the light he could not see
[2:10:02] your instructor his brother John was
[2:10:04] preaching he said sometimes we need our
[2:10:05] eyes opened
[2:10:07] it's not that our eyes haven't been
[2:10:08] opened
[2:10:09] but we need our eyes opened to yet
[2:10:10] another area of Our Lives to another
[2:10:12] situation to another weakness another
[2:10:15] shortcoming and we don't realize it
[2:10:18] this is what we do when we sit under the
[2:10:19] preaching of the word his eyes are
[2:10:21] supposed to come open and then we're
[2:10:23] supposed to see ourselves as he sees us
[2:10:24] amen sometimes we get to this place
[2:10:27] where we're sitting there and we're just
[2:10:28] what saying how long is this going to go

[2:10:43] a halfway job amen so I don't know where
[2:10:45] you're at this morning
[2:10:47] I don't know what you're dealing with

[2:10:52] of a blind man that he healed amen hope
[2:10:55] this raised your hand and say Lord I
[2:10:56] know I've got shortcomings I'm blind to

[2:11:02] to others
[2:11:04] failures and open my eyes

[2:11:29] with the heat of your presence open my
[2:11:31] eyes that I can see myself clearly

[2:11:35] Pride
[2:11:36] not through my own ideas not through my
[2:11:39] own self-worth but Lord let me see as
[2:11:41] you see and Lord where there's a
[2:11:43] shortcoming will you come in and touch
[2:11:45] it will you lift me up Lord will you

[2:12:14] that which maketh manifest is light
[2:12:17] so if if something shines and exposes
[2:12:20] something in your life if something
[2:12:22] exposes something in my life you know
[2:12:24] what that is that's light
[2:12:26] it's not Darkness it's not malice it's
[2:12:29] not mean intention that's God coming our
