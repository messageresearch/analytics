pray grace grace grace that it's real to us amen amen so the lord bless you by the by his grace that we're going to not follow the wisdom of man the knowledge of man we're going to follow the leadership of the holy ghost it is christ in me thank god he's in me thank god he's in the believers and he's right there a man so that he's going to respond to anything you experience anything that crosses your path he's going to respond to it amen and i pray grace that we're going to discern his leadership in our lives amen so the lord bless you so keep sister betty in prayer amen and again of course we need to pray for one another constantly including the token life of the blood of jesus and also again let me remind you that brother we got to keep looking up we got to keep looking to god we got to keep looking to the word and not not what's down here what's up there amen by the grace of god what's down here is being judged by the word but by the grace of god we believe that the message was the grace of god to to give a bride rapturing faith it is by grace through faith amen it's not just grace no no and that's been quoted for many many years or we're saved by the grace of god no no no we're it goes beyond that how are we saved by the grace of god by faith grace is going to give us the faith that god wants us to have in the hour and in the day that we're living amen god is going to require this of you and me he required one thing of luther's generation wesley's generation the old-fashioned salvation army generation the pentecostal generation what was he requiring of us in our generation amen so i pray the grace of god that that we're going to enter into the revelation the faith that god wants us to have amen i mean why because what he did in luther's generation was one thing amen so he give them they give them the word that will give them the faith that pleased him amen and brother like i said it was just justification so he wasn't going into all the rest because that was that was the burden that that they had in that day to be justified and i'll imagine to be justified do this do this do this no you've got to you've got to accept what he's already done by the grace of god amen so and and again that was that was here and then wesley then the old-fashioned salvation army the pentecostals but now brother god requires more of us than he did of them amen and brother to to to for us to manifest it amen and go and live it we got to let it control us amen so amen sure we're going to go out and live justified lives sanctified lives and life with the baptism and access to the gifts yeah that's right but now god's looking for a greater faith to for the resurrection and the rapture amen and and when they got the revelation back then that's all they focused on morning noon and night yeah and brother to pentecostals morning noon and night around the world but brother the bride in this hour we're focusing on thank god for what he did then amen but we're focusing on what he's doing as done and he's doing now and that's the opening of the word the mystery of god to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen god's not looking for us just to go say oh yeah i'm justified thank you lord and go on no yeah he wants you to believe that plus wesley plus the pentecostals amen but now let's believe that plus the messenger the prophetic messenger of the age the prophetic message that god ordained to open the word and reveal the mystery of god so that we know the word of god the revelation of god that luther never had amen that's right we we were going beyond that luther never didn't know what we're we're believing luther didn't know what what we're going to stand for and why are standing for concerning the resurrection and the rapture they just felt you know we're not going to understand that we won't know nothing about that so we'll just leave that with the lord but they believe the revelation god gave them and they preached it morning noon and night amen they took their stand for it amen they live for it and whenever it manifested what god had revealed so are we manifesting what god is revealing this hour amen praise the lord so that we're not looking out there we're looking off because now god yes god gave them a revelation out there out there good do this do this preach this preach this but now brother we've lifted we're come to that place amen where when the son of man comes will he find faith amen just think he is giving us that understanding that this is how bad this hour is going to be spiritually this is how dark is going to be in this age saying will i find faith well he found it in luther's day he found it in wesley's day he found him the pentecostal age amen but brothers he find it in the bright age amen so brother let's go on on and on and on until i tell you one thing added to another added to another plus plus plus to the true baptism it's going to be divine love oh yeah it's divine love that you love him and he loves you remember the prophet god said why did why did he allow all this to happen he said what for he said he did it he said so he could show you his love amen even though you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he loved you to the extent that he would give you a revelation to get you closer to him amen and he got in in all ages he give give them a faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience godliness brotherly kindness a revelation they believed a revelation that they lived amen an experience from the lord and they were bringing them closer to the lord and what was it doing it was increasing their love amen you know not just oh i love the lord i love the lord yeah but it's got to come to the place where oh my it's going to be the life you live amen you're going to show it one to another amen by the grace of god that love oh yes well brother brown said why he said because he said god wants us to love him for himself amen love him because of his nature love him because of his love by the grace of god lord you did this for us lord we love you as you loved us we love you amen i pray the grace of god that the love we got is for him is the type of the love that he had for us and he asked for us amen brother he was there then six thousand years ago he's here now amen praise the lord he was there then and gave us the revelation of the blessed hope by grace through faith they were saved by believing what he said two six thousand years ago amen and by grace through faith we are going to enter into a resurrection rapture we're saved by what believing what he has revealed and is revealing in these last days amen pentecostals will see it they but they what they saw god god's grace to them amen and that again the the methodist didn't see it no no they saw what god revealed amen they went along with god amen it was satisfying the hunger for that age but i tell you concerning what god has done in this hour is to satisfy the hunger we have amen and what is that hunger it's for a resurrection rapture we want to get out of here amen because we know if we don't get into the resurrection rapture we're not going to be saved no that's how that's how bad the world is so god help us that we're going to press on into the faith that god's looking for in you and me and brother think that i i oh well can i have that faith yes all that god has done was ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen well i believe brother brown said it'll come to the place oh my why what concerning what god has done he said it ought to come to the place where he said it might be a it might be a man a woman or he said it might be just a boy or a girl and he said what were they with it with the the influence of that anointing of the revealed word in their hearts and in their souls he said he said a boy or a girl he said just look up there and say lord we're coming home and he should lift up their hands and they're gone amen it's that simple praise the name of the lord are we coming to that place amen what emphasis are we putting on the revelation of what god has done and what god is doing amen or you can go preach the doctrine and the doctrine and the doctrine and go to hell oh yeah or end up in a great tribulation amen but brother let's see what god was pointing to in putting the emphasis on these doctrines putting the emphasis on the on these church ages putting the emphasis on these seals amen brother increasing our faith increasing our faith what for to do as jesus said amen to go on amen praise the lord hallelujah brother the rest were redeemed they entered into the revelation of jesus as their redeemer now we're entering into the revelation of jesus as the redeemer of our bodies our souls yes amen all that gone on before us they were redeemed in their souls and they got out of this body and went into a theophany body praise the lord amen by the grace of almighty god but the bride is going amen oh you're going to meet them but then that faith is going to quicken us into a glorified body amen like the body that jesus went up with amen so the grace of god to help us to truly believe amen amen now just believe it but help us to so that what we believe controls us what we believe governs what we think and how we think what we do and how we do it amen you're controlled by that faith because luther went out and did this and did this because he thought he had to do it for justification but no no but when god revealed it to him the revelation of justification oh he went out and preached it and given to god the glory praise the lord praise the lord he was emphasizing justification and to us in this hour brother what did god do in the ministry of a prophet he amen he gave us the revelation of the resurrection amen brother god god not only raised raise humans from the dead from the death not from the grave or from death under the ministry of william branham amen oh yeah he raised animals to life again praise the lord praise the lord amen showing that we're in the hour of the resurrection praise the lord so brother god's going to raise the rays of his sons and daughters into glorified bodies but he's also going he's also going to bring in some of those animals amen by the grace of god somebody asked me and said oh brother is there going to be any animals in in the new heaven and new earth i said sure amen they're going to be there i said maybe not all that we see now but there's still going to be animals there amen praise the lord the lion will lay down with the lamb amen the bible explains that the the the the nature of animals where they fight one another and kill one another not in in glory know what he said that not not not by any means lying will lay down with the lamb this animal will do this this one will do that amen because why because there's nothing negative that's one thing that i thought about and give god the glory for i said lord i'm longing to get out of here and into a country into a kingdom i say where there's nothing negative and i said everything is positive and right now we're we're living in a world that's all mine it is tremendously negative right around the world this cobit issue is negative amen so the grace of god that the bride's looking up because we know don't look down on the covet issue look up to the promise of god amen because he's going to bring more and more and more of that amen they allow it to come into the into the world what for it's the influence of the bright the bride's going to look up oh yeah oh yeah it's just just your it'll be just your your holy ghost nature in you look up amen jesus went up brother and he's given us the faith to do this for the same thing amen we have come to the place that jesus came to after his death burial and resurrection amen to go up in he was resurrected now he was going to rap be raptured amen and be caught up and the angels went with him said open up the gates and let the king of glory come in amen and they said who is who is the lord of oceans the lord of lords oh it's he's the king of glory amen he's the one that's that's fought and has gotten the victory praise the lord hallelujah so the grace of god that we're going to experience the victory and go home amen so i trust you have that anointing in your heart that anointing in your soul amen you're hungry and thirsting not just for religion but you want to get out of here it is the word amen faith cometh by hearing the word amen and again oh yeah by grace i'm saved yeah but through faith so what is the faith that god's requiring of you today and so by the grace of god is more than what he required of mom and dad and the grandmothers and grandpas more than what he required of another generation so brother it's ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith and i'll tell you this it was so simple like i said the prophet said that a child a boy or girl could just raise their hand and say lord i'm coming home gone and he said another brother approached brother branham he said brother branham he said my where's the rapture he says surely after all that god has done in this generation it ought to give us the faith for the rapture and that's the truth and i believe if if if if the prophet stayed i think eventually he would have walked off in a rapture amen but but that's right brother but god took him amen god took him because the hour hadn't come yet for the rapture but brother it's been 55 years so whereby the grace of god help us lord that we're going to get into the revelation of the word amen yes lord but we're going to get the faith that we need and what faith do we need we need the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture why again let me repeat it again if i got to do it because peter said he said your forgetful ears amen well let it let everyone remembered and control you amen and by the grace of almighty god he said that the dead are waiting on us amen they're waiting on us to get to that faith for the rapture why when we get to that faith and we really get into it it controls us then they're going to appear to us and the prophecies we're going to be changed instantly he said into a glorified body amen we'll gather with all the rest he said we'll rise to meet him in the air amen what we've what we have seen by the grace of god in the pillar of fire brother he's going to he's going to be there in a cloud of glory and brother the prophet was preaching one time he said see he said there he is he's looking down on us amen praise the name of the lord it's a cloud of angels so brother i pray grace that we're not going to miss the rapture not going to miss the resurrection remember the resurrection has got got to take place first amen and then the dead in christ appear to us are we sensitive to that are we really looking for it are we expecting it amen so brother because all of it down through the ages when they got a revelation from god for that age brother that it controlled them morning noon and night they lived it lived it lived it talked it talked it amen it was their testimony one to another and they give god the glory for it amen praise the name of the lord the lord bless you sorry let's stand but that's all right shouldn't be sorry why because we want to by grace we want to go on come on tell say it again brother because maybe it helped me to get get that faith that i need amen by the grace of god so it'll get to the place where brother morning new tonight it's just the word the word the word it's like i said every revival people just oh they made fun of them those that got caught up with their revival made fun of them why they're always there getting together talking about the bible talking about god talking about this yeah oh yeah that's what god wanted well they just felt oh you just do it morning noon and night and and go to church but that's it you don't have to let it control your morning you know 24 hours a day oh yes oh yes we're living for him we love him 24 hours a day oh can you forget it brother i'll tell you this when it comes to the first when the prophet came on the scene and he was there for the first second pull everybody was just living it believing it or thinking about it talking about it morning noon and night talking about it and until through the day that's why the bible says after the day of pentecost boy they got together in in their homes oh yeah and just talking about the revelation talk about what god had done what god was doing they were so inspired amen that that there was there's nothing the devil could interfere could give them you know and distract them from from what god was doing oh yeah he was there for sure amen but if you're a seed of god the devil is not going to influence your thoughts what you what you what god has done for you and what god is doing for you amen he has come down the devil has come down with great wrath knowing this time is short and as i've said he got that faith what faith do you get he looks at what god has done and that's the revelation he got oh it's it's finished amen oh yeah because the bible says that oh it's finished i better get down there and see what i can do and he comes down with great wrath knowing his time is short well the bride was coming not to come down with great wrath the bride i'd be entering into an eternal resurrection rapturing glory amen yeah joy peace hallelujah why oh praise the lord we're going home amen we're going home we're not home no this is not home brother not not like this the home we come from wasn't like this and the only we're going to is not like this not by any means amen you're saying it was just there in another dimension i pray the grace of god help us amen grace of god give us faith to take it serious amen morning noon and night that will control us by the grace of god amen let's sing only believe and we'll endeavor to get to the word [Music] only believe oh all things are possible only be [Music] all things are possible only believe jesus is here hallelujah amen oh hallelujah praise the lord glory amen

your life in us a man that is taking us from time to eternity amen amen amen taking us out of this whole body and into a glorified body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah father where there is nothing negative only positive amen we are the sons and daughters of god hallelujah we are hallelujah shield father with your shield your anointing by the grace of god amen amen amen of us lord to let go and

time into eternity for the glory of god hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah thank you jesus for the blessed hope amen thank you lord for the word that's giving us the faith ali may

giving strength to the weak amen grace grace grace that we truly have the faith that pleases you today in jesus christ's name but i'm amen hallelujah now i believe now i believe now i believe all things are possible now i'd be [Music] all things are possible now i believe amen praise the name of the lord god bless you turn with me to the book of genesis chapter one amen just a confirmation i guess these thoughts and what i've said thus far is we had a ministering brother here one time and and uh he said brother and i he might have told to the assembly as well he said i'm a notes preacher he said but brother gerald is a is inspirational preacher amen and the inspiration of the holy ghost the anointing of the holy ghost so he said that's he said i'll just go according to my notes he said well brother joel's going to just follow what god puts in his mind and in his heart amen amen so i don't maybe our brother jonathan is a note preacher but also he's there with that that anointing then i noticed that he's got to keep putting himself back to the notes go back to the notes go back to the notes amen so i pray grace that i will get will get to to my notes amen and again i did i it's amazing that god provided the notes right there so so i thank the lord for that i want to i want to highlight some scriptures that will help us and lead us to again this message that i referenced before our brother mark came and preached and our brother jonathan ministered and i did say i said lord willing we'll get i'll get to these thoughts i said maybe in another message and so we'll try to get back to this message right here and i don't know if you remember what it was but i was highlighting god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen so i highlighted some scriptures and we'll do some scriptures again tonight and then the lord willing again i'm endeavoring to get get to these notes right here so but it usually tells sometimes it takes a long time but we'll see and again as i highlighted that all due respect to our brother uh lee vale that somebody's compared me to level one time they said oh no you're not lee vale why because he said brother he'll take a message and he'll preach 60 60 sermons on that one message but he said you don't do that well we'll see what the lord will do i don't think i'll go to 60. but i did one time i preached a certain message one time i can't remember the name of it now and i went oh my i might have been 59 messages and and uh sister coffee i always remember she said that was the best she ever heard and i said well praise the lord amen not not three or four messages but 59. amen so god rest our rest your soul amen it was a blessing to her so the grace of god be with us see why is it like that it's because we're go we're we're not in time we're read eternity amen whether it's brother jonathan or his brother mark or whatever whatever brother that might be here ministering amen we've got to get out of time and into eternity so it's not me in control not you in control it's god in control amen it is the holy ghost so the lord bless us and again want to do what god wants us to do and we'll try to get through the scripture and if we don't get all of these quotes we'll get some of them amen so in the genesis chapter 1 and beginning to read at verse 1 amen in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth we are in the end of that beginning and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light because why god saw the light that it was good and god divided or separated the light from the darkness and as he was doing in that natural creation of the heaven new heaven and new earth so he is doing in your life and in mind that god is separating light from darkness so grace that we're going to recognize the light by the grace of god and that we are getting more and more into the light and out of the darkness that we are being separated by the ministry of the word that we are being separated more and more from darkness and god has taken darkness taken taken darkness out of our hearts a man until brother comes to that place where it's a hundred percent light and we're going into the resurrection and we're going into the rapture amen because there won't be any negative things there to hinder us in our faith amen for the resurrection and the rapture so god divided the light from the darkness he did it and he's doing it he did it in the natural he did it when it comes to the natural sun and the moon he's he divided it amen then the night versus the day he divided it he divided the light from the day darkness amen so he has he done here naturally so he's doing to us spiritually amen god is working in us through the ministry of the word amen to make sure that the light is separated from the darkness amen so that darkness is not in control darkness is not guarding us amen the oh yeah the the the imputed revelations of the devil amen saying this this and that like he said to eve in the garden oh yeah yes god said but amen and remember again the sheep don't butt that's the goats amen the goat's butt but not sheep amen so we pray the grace of god that we are shape amen and that we are the lambs of god by the for the glory of god so brother let's let it be a confirmation that we are born again a confirmation that god is in control amen you have the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost amen what is it well god is working on me amen morning noon and night amen and he's separating constantly in my life amen he's separating light from darkness light from darkness till you're all light and no darkness amen amen we're all light in no darkness then we're ready for the resurrection then we're ready for the rapture so he said god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night amen and the evening and the morning were the first day amen verse 6 and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters god amen working on separation god bless you you may be seated and what god is looking for and what god is calling for is in our lives is total separation from unbelief total separation amen from doubt told separation from the works of the flesh amen versus what god is doing in your heart amen so we're not subject to the flesh we're not subject to the leadership in the flesh we're subject to what god is doing in our hearts amen again to understand as the prophet is highlighted that the devil is working in our minds amen through the instincts of the mind through the instincts of your flesh but he said god is working in our hearts through faith amen so the enemy is he's got got seven senses to work on amen and through your mind and through through the through the flesh there's there's i believe i've already said it do it again the instincts are the five five instincts of the flesh that the enemy works on amen five instincts of the flesh that the enemy is working on amen god help us brother that we'll recognize it and we'll keep pleading the token life of the blood of jesus christ amen keep putting these instincts under the control of the holy ghost amen so he's working on your flesh with what you see amen he's working on your flesh with what you taste and feel and smell and what you you're hearing amen brother and he wants to apply his thoughts to it he wants to apply his ideas to it amen amen he wants you to oh just just bring us through the senses of your flesh your mind in a sense of your flesh so that you're gonna you're gonna be governed by the instincts of your flesh but the instincts of the spirit amen is imagination conscience memory reason and affection and the enemy is working on that amen to get you to oh yeah you can be religious but not spiritual amen he's working on that to get you to focus more and more on the natural life and not on the spiritual amen it's working on these instincts of your flesh and of your spirit amen the human spirit able to make us more and more and more human amen and subject to what's going on in the realms around us amen somebody what's going on in the earth oh yeah because many are caught up with see taste feel smelling here any and and imagination conscious memory reason and affection but god is working in your soul amen to con to to give those instincts of spiritual nature amen so you're not governed by the worldly sinful nature amen but you're governed by the holy ghost nature amen showing that it's not the devil controlling you is jesus it is god by the holy ghost controlling you amen brother this is why we've got to be born again amen we've got to be born again and become new creatures from the soul out to your spirit out to your flesh amen god is working us working on us from the inside out amen and that's where he warned us that you can have the holy ghost anointing in your flesh you can have the holy ghost anointing yes even in your human spirit but he says got to be gotta not come from the outside to the end it's got to start from the inside and work out amen it's working that's taking control of your human spirit and has taken control amen of your flesh so why is he hallelujah to god be the glory amen we're new creatures in our souls we're going to become new creatures in our spirit and a new creature in our flesh amen we're going to enter into a glorified body like unto his glorious body amen so brother what is god accomplishing that in you are you becoming more and more spiritual are we becoming more and more sensitive to the eternal and less and less and less to time amen that we are becoming we are again starting to hunger and thirst and hunger and thirst for the resurrection hunger and thirst for the rapture oh my lord please lord this is what you did lord we're looking up where's the resurrection lord where's the rapture amen lord please even so come lord jesus amen even so lord we want we want the resurrection we want the rapture amen how many really want to get out of here and get into eternity amen how many really got that hunger and that thirst amen to leave here and get back home amen i know that in the natural if you were somewhere else and oh yeah you were born you were raised there all the all your lives amen maybe in this country or that country and then you had to go and take a journey somewhere else to do something and you you you wouldn't be able to wait to get to get back home oh i want to get back to my family i want to get back to my friends that i knew there i feel it it's better for me to be there than here amen well brother by the grace of god let's hunger and thirst to get out of here and we want a hunger to get home let's make sure amen that you know where you come from amen by the grace of god and you want to get back there by the grace of god amen because all that god did amen and brother from genesis to ray down through to revelation all that god did and all that god is doing it is to get us from time to eternity amen brother brother sister amen and it comes from eternity down into time and all this has happened and it's happening but no brother in it all well this is the wonderful book hallelujah the bible brother oh we want to know what what god has done what god is doing what he will do it's right here amen this is what this book is all about and even concerning what the devil has done what the devil is doing what the devil will do and the end of the devil amen it's all in this book there is a plan and there is a purpose and there is a pattern amen and it's sad that that many that many say they recognize that maybe they have some idea about the plan oh yeah and but they but they haven't got the true revelation of the purpose and they don't understand the pattern amen because if they understood that god had a pattern amen and god this is how god did it this is how god did it in the middle and then and in the beginning and this is how he's doing it in the end amen god has a pattern this is the way that god gives his word this is the way that god makes his word flesh this is the way that god amen is taking us from time to eternity amen brother amen we all came out of time out of eternity into time to be tested and tried amen so that god in time would reveal to us is his love amen and it would produce in us a love for him because remember he's not easy again he's not that he wants us to come there and we like him because oh yeah we like you lord and we appreciate what you did amen no he wants you to love him amen it's a relationship of love amen so brother not love the world and the things of the world amen but to love god but yet there are those that have a greater love for the world and have a greater love for the things of the world and less and less love for jesus amen brother whatever you're giving your preeminence to in your everyday life that's what you love amen so when you in morning noon and night what are you living for how are you living what are you doing and what are you hungry and thirsty for amen that determines what your where your love is amen and then again brother it's what love is what he's looking for a divine love yes but it's a love for him amen amen by the grace of almighty god amen so brother i pray the grace of god amen that our love for him is what's bringing us closer and closer to the resurrection our love for him is bringing us into a greater and a greater amen experience of the anointing of the holy ghost resurrection and rapture in us amen listen we're looking for the rapture looking for the resurrection but again understand that what god is going to do in the natural and physically god has already done in the spiritual amen he has resurrected us amen praise the lord and he has raptured us by the grace of god and again like i said before allow me to repeat it that when i i mentioned that in another church and i was preaching and and not in newfoundland and uh and i ministered and when i said that everybody got quiet i said i've been resurrected i've been raptured and they they they i can see them now getting right quiet and looking at one another yeah and i remember even the pastor looking around at the congregation and shaking his head no no and i said well i gotta prove it i said because he has quickened me because i was dead in sins he's made me alive amen i've experienced resurrection for you at the quicken i trust you had that experience amen now you have the experience with jesus you have the experience with god amen you're not dead you're alive amen spiritually eternally amen you've got eternal life in your soul amen and you had the quicken who were dead quicker means to make alive amen you are the quicken who were dead in sins and trespasses we were born in sin amen spiritually dead but by the grace of god responding to the word god quickened the seed hallelujah and we came back to life in our souls instead of looking and living for the world and the things of the world oh my we started to focus and put the emphasis on on god on jesus on the word of god on what god has done and what god is doing and what he will do amen we begin to live for that by the grace of god amen because i you at the quicken amen the power the anointing of the resurrection brings you back to the word amen because we need it to get the faith to go on we need it to know what god requires of us know what god's expecting of us in the hour that we're living amen and so i said now i said go on down another four verses or five verses in ephesians two and i said it's right there and i said we have been caught up into heavenly places in christ amen praise the lord you have i said yeah i said i was resurrected no i said i'm raptured i'm caught up into a heavenly place in christ and the prophet of god said well he said what's going on there what's going on in every phase of christ he said the word is being revealed praise the name of the lord hallelujah the word is being revealed to give us the faith to keep moving on amen the word is being revealed to give us resurrection and rapturing faith for our physical bodies amen so to get out of time and into glory praise the name of the lord so i said i pray grace that you're that you that believe god you that have accepted christ as your savior that you have experienced resurrection in your soul and your and you've been caught up spiritually and raptured spiritually into christ amen praise the lord you're here because you believe that you've had that experience and why because now you're you're raptured out into every place in christ and he's revealing the word amen he's giving you more and more revelation of the word he's really given make this real to you make that real to you amen but yet there are so many professing christians that christians that brother that have not experienced that resurrection now they haven't experienced that rapture of being caught up in heavenly places in christ they're religious but they're caught up into a church but not into glory not inc not in christ amen by the grace of god so god elvis brother let go let god have his way make sure that you have experienced the resurrection in your soul i was dead in sin now i'm resurrected amen i'm alive i'm back into fellowship and into contact with god praise the name my father now as john said oh now you can cry father father father amen now you know who your father is amen by the grace of god brother don't look at the natural man oh no because he was born in sin like like the rest of us amen but you're looking at your heavenly father amen and god god amen god god was preached but that was his purpose in doing what he did amen was to bring us into fellowship with him and with the revelation of who he is our relationship with god amen brothers see we got to get out of the natural we definitely got to lift the spiritual control amen but and brother how do we know it's god just make sure it's going to govern govern you according to the word amen because what god has done what god is doing what god will do is all in this book amen you might know that if you're born again well find out see if you're going to see if you're going to experience what they ex what what they experienced in in their day amen while they experienced in the old testament yes well they experienced in the new testament yes and what what the they've experienced down through the church ages amen again the revelation of the seven church ages and is crowned with divine love amen oh it is or definitely is amen amen amen but this is what he said in revelation concerning the church ages amen and concerning the last age the days that you and i are in and that we've experienced it amen and we know that according to the scriptures this is this is what's going on and has gone on in the churches amen oh yes i believe that when it comes to denominations out there i believe that there's many out there and i believe that they'll be they'll lay down their lives in the in the great tribulation many will but they won't go into the rest they're not going into a rapture amen but but i bet if they're predestinated and they're ordained of god and they're part of the bride of christ or they're going to go into rapture they're going to get what god is doing in this hour they're going to oh yeah god will bring them into the word to the message to give them rapturing faith amen and it is the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen that's going on but again there are many that are not bright amen the bride is going to live in the city and the rest are going to be outside the city so keep your attitude right as i said keep your spirit right keep your motive and your objectives right amen don't look down your noses and say well they don't believe the message they're doing this they're going there they believe that well well if if they do then they're not bright if they're bright they will believe the message but brother all that although that to receive eternal life and we're going to heaven amen and we're going to come back to earth in the new jerusalem and so on a new heaven and new earth amen brother we're going to be in the in sit with the bride groom in his throne set with the bridegroom at the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of god but still there's going to be many others outside the city amen don't think and as i've said i've had to deal with that from the first time i come to this message and as i said april night when i was asked to preach for really the first time in a congregation amen being 20 years old whatever and uh and i had to preach on matthew chapter 20 matthew 5 rather chapter 5 the last maybe a few verses and i said if you love them which love you what reward of you but he said you got to love those out there too amen gotta have respect to them by the grace of god and so i preached that and again let me say this that was it the truth well i believe it was the truth and after i preached it god vindicated it with a message in tongues and a brother bill again interpreted amen and he confirmed he was confirming what i said what i preached and he said it wasn't a man it was god it was my word said the lord amen and they were encouraged to to take heed to what was preached amen and the pastor getting up amen and he and he was encouraging me good he said thank the lord brother you explained it thank you amen because he was misunderstanding me as well god help us brother sister amen and just to think again that uh basically and i'm the only pastor in newfoundland that i know of right now amen so the great and better yet i was even prophesying those things of what was going to happen oh yeah i told this pastor i told this one this is what's going to happen amen and again there's maybe i might have been 10 or 15 years ago now that i i was talking to our brother guy and i said brother listen let me show you this amen this was moving around the message this was going on i said brother be on your guard i should be on your toes amen i said because you're going to be dealing with those those things amen that's right and he had a church oh my i guess when he started there might have been 100 people there or more and now there might be a dozen although he's gone on amen he's gone on and just before he went on amen he called me and said brother pray for me pray for me i said brother encourage let me encourage you he said i should just keep trusting the lord and move on and in three months the lord took him home now amen so brother been fighting those spirits amen god has ordained it why because the ministry is going to be what encouraging believers to believe this believe this amen to have this attitude in this spirit amen and because god is going to do this god is doing this now amen and god is going to do this tomorrow amen bro help us lord to keep our spirits right our attitude is right brother because jesus loved them oh yeah even on the cross he suffered so much and then he said father forgive them for they know not what they do oh amazing so we thank god god help us to have that that love that he had amen if we get into that phase and where we're whereas jesus was crucified naturally that we might be end up and be crucified spiritually that they're going to put a pressure on us that we are going to believe amen but before they begin to kill the people amen during the great tribulation the bride is going to be taken home in a rapture amen by the grace of god amen so we pray for the grace of god to be with those that are going to lay down their life during the great tribulation but the bride is going to be up there praise the lord amen and brother during for the millennial reign of a thousand years when he comes back the bride comes back with him she's going to reign with him by grace amen so brother god help us that we're going to let go and let god bring us into that total separation from unbelief amen that we're going to identify with god we're going to identify with his word we're going to identify with the sons and daughters of god and brother having the right spirit and the right attitude amen having a godly spirit and a godly attitude amen concerning the hour that we're living amen and keep pressing on by the grace of god i tell you this we can say we believe this we believe that oh yeah yeah that's good that's good amen but brother if your spirit and attitude is not right you're not going to make it amen your believing is in vain amen brother if there's anything that that god's requiring of us and where we're going to manifest is love but again only there's not not everybody will recognize it but some will amen and he said right here in the in the in the last church age amen he acknowledged what you said you're this you're this you're this but if you don't know that you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're blind and you're naked oh yeah they figured they were this but jesus said no you're this why because they had put them out of the church amen and the bible says under the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen in the last church age it's amen and he said the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot yeah lukewarm god don't like a lukewarm attitude lukewarm spirit either be cold or hot amen he said i would that thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and because thou sayest i am rich increase with goods have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked amen how does god see us how does god see this church amen how does god see what we have done over the last 40 years yeah amazing what do you what do you think god has seen in you amen what do you think god has seen in you today before you got to this church what do you think god's seen in you or we'll see in you tomorrow or after you leave the church amen will the anointing be still on you in you and around you to a lot of people that's just outside oh yeah the prophet acknowledged that he said they got the anointing in their flesh but it's not in their heart not in their soul and again let me say it again he said you're in the message but the message is not in you amazing he was preaching that to his own church amen he said you're in the message but the message is not in you amen make sure the message is in you because god brother amen regardless of the age and the message brother god's looking for the message in us he was looking for the message in it all down through from paul irenaeus and martin and columba and luther wesley and the elijah ministry of this hour amen he's looking for it in you not around you in you and controlling you from the soul by the grace of god amen so brother because that in luther's age there were those that god was looking for and the message of justification was in them and they went and lived it amen it was sincere they were sincere with that revelation amen and they really lived and the life their lives proved it amen by the grace of god so brother amen our lives are going to prove what we believe because why because we're going to be living looking looking looking for the resurrection looking for the rapture all looking up all looking up not looking down look up by the grace of god amen and he said i counsel thee to buy me gold try it in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see amen so you're going to see what god sees you're going to see what and the way here god sees it amen not the way the church is telling you or the preacher no no you're going to see it the way god sees it and it's going to be out of your soul amen amen and it's really going to affect you influence your life morning noon and night every day oh yeah because some people are wondering what why do you do this why do you do that oh yeah and as i've i've heard people have expressed to me oh my you you people are just that's all you're that's all you're into is this and this and this what's what's wrong with the world what's going on you're just thinking about this thing oh yeah you should god wants you to think about it redemption and you'll get redemption if you're going to think about it and hunger and thirst for salvation you'll get it you're going to hunger and thirst for the resurrection rapture you're going to get it as luther and them all listen brother it didn't just happen when it comes to what god was revealing to luther and and wesley and and and the pentecostals they the holy ghost was here creating in them a hunger and a thirst for it because what god is going to do god has promised in his word he'll send the holy ghost ahead to create in them a hunger and a thirst for it amen for so brother we're not only thirsting for what god did in pentecost we got it brother brown said it's right there he says ours we don't have to ask god for it it's ours he already gave it to us amen but what we're hungry and thirsting for is resurrection rapture because we believe we're living in that hour amen when we consider all that's going on in the world surely we know that we're approaching the resurrection and the rapture it is the end of all things amen because brother we see everything is mostly in the world it is dead spiritually amen they're dead not religiously but spiritually that's why that's why he said when the son of man comes will he find thee does he find faith in you is he finding faith in me that it is it's governing us and it's controlling us in our everyday living amen in our choices in our decision well it's it's it's god he's in control he's got to be oh yeah because it is god that wants wants to get put his will in your life so that you're in his will and he's in control by the grace of god amen god help us there's too many still living their own way doing what they want to do oh i'm religious or i'm this and i'm that no is it god amen christ in me the hope of glory christ in you the hope of glory in control of your life amen god help us and he said anoint thine eyes with i saved that thou may see well it's got to be hold the hole the night you're anoint your eyes with the holy ghost amen the eyes have of god that you'll see what god sees amen and you'll see what god wants you to see by the grace of god because he said as many as i love i rebuke oh people think oh you don't love me if you love me you wouldn't treat me like this no no that's like it's like your child you know your child it does this does that and you go on oh that's just their nature yeah it is but you better correct them it says train them up in the way they should go and when they are old they won't depart from it amen god help us brother as god is training us god is correcting us amen so we we do the same thing to our children by the grace of god amen don't let them go away without the knowledge of god amen so the grace of god i prayed give us that wisdom as many as i love as many as you love in the natural you will rebuke and chasten i tell you if you don't chasing them you don't love them no you don't you might think you do but you don't but so you're just going by feelings not faith yeah amen but he said as many as i love i rebuke chasten be zealous don't just be casual with it be zealous amen if there's anything god wants us to be any nature that god wants us to have for him and for his word amen is zealousness amen be zealous therefore and repent forgive me lord give me your zeal amen i repent forgive me amen because i stand at the door and knock he's outside i trust he's not outside your heart i trust he's not outside this church amen did he come with you but he was here brother you know this too the devil was here the prophet said sometimes he said the devil is the first one in church oh yeah so he's here to control your thoughts he's here maybe to try to control the preacher calm down don't get don't say this don't say that you'll offend them well blessed he has not offended amen with the truth with the word amen so the devil is here brother i trust he's out there somewhere but he's not in you that he's not controlling your thoughts words or deeds but he's here trying to do it oh yeah he's trying to control your thoughts he's trying to control your feelings your your ideas concerning the ministry of the word grace amen so he says many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent from the old i stand at the door and knock amen and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suck with him and eat with me and brother to overcome we've got to sup with him and he with me by grace amen turn with me to isaiah chapter 53 amen oh bear with me 43 isaiah 43. and beginning to read at verse 1 but now thus saith the lord that created thee yes did he continue his relationship with you amen thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine amen are you is i trust you belong to him not to the church amen when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned amazing neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and siba for thee and since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee amen but brother what this relationship produced with a total separation from unbelief amen staying with the lord therefore he said will i give men for thee and people for thy life and he should fear not for i am with thee and i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west amen and i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth amen it's it's his children it's his seed it's his sons it's his daughters are you his son are you his daughter amen are you the seed of god by the grace of god amen brother so that we're born of god not of the devil amen brother god said the lord that created jacob and he formed jacob and he's and he said fear not for i have redeemed thee amen i have called thee by thy name thou art mine amen because they're totally separated onto the lord in god in in delivering israel out of egypt god gave them the the instructions and the command that when you come out and you're going to journey to the land that i have promised you the promised land and he said you're going to pass through this you're going to pass near this city you'll pass near this one and that one but he said if you want water if you want something extra go down and get it but don't stay there come back amen so then why because that's going to influence you that will influence israel and that they were going to maybe live like them and so on and it got to the place where they where they got to the promised land and they wouldn't go in and possess the promised land yet in spite of all that god did for them in delivering them out of egypt and all that god did for them in delivering them through the wilderness that they traveled amen still they never had that faith to believe god would deliver them from those that were living in the promised land amen brother i pray god in the name of jesus help us to have that faith brother for the resurrection have us have that faith for the rapture by the grace of almighty god brother let's not doubt it and think oh what brother look look at the world we're living in look with what's going on when it comes to kovalev 19 and all these things oh my oh my lord we're going we're going to be lost we're going to we're all going to die no no we're going to live amen pray by the grace of almighty god amen god help us to believe not not what we see going on out there brother listen what's going on up there will be confirmed here amen amen when we when we see what god has has done and what god is doing out there when allowing this allowing that oh my i tell you if we really got the spiritual revelation of what's going on amen we'll keep we'll keep looking up looking up looking up and we'll keep crying and praying and calling for the resurrection oh yeah amen oh yes definitely because there's so many things are going to happen but i pray god we're not just going to say oh yeah that's prophecy yeah we'll keep on going living for ourselves no no no brother god god put it in the word god is going to bring it to pass and god is going to show us and give us the revelation of it why because he wants to keep us conscious of eternity he wants to keep us conscious of the revelation where we come from amen and he wants to create in us a greater and a greater and a greater hunger and thirst to get out of here amen in the glory you got to want to go if you want to go you'll go amen you got to want it amen god grace god is creating us a hunger and a thirst the baptism of the holy ghost brother regardless of the age that any any of the gentiles lived in i pray i know that by the baptism of the holy ghost they had a hunger and thirst for god for more of god amen and they went on into the next stage and on the next day it was the same anointing brother going on from one age to the next amen by the grace of almighty god creating in them amen when one age was gone god came and he and he created them a hunger and a thirst for what he wanted to do and that was to give them the faith that would take them on to the next church age and the next one and the next one amen brother and there's anything they needed in luther's age was justification because why because it had become so dark in in in the in the previous ages why there was the influence of the catholic church it was the influence of their teaching denominationalism but man controlling man not god controlling man man was controlling man amen in a denomination of spirit amen and darkness darkness darkness but god said i will i will res i will god's going to redo it and he come back with luther and started to give us the light amen the light of justification sanctification amen the light of the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen and now he's given us the light of the revealed word of resurrection and rapturing faith brother brother goddess god did this and he gave luther and luther oh yeah luther hunger for that because that's what god put in him amen it was in him and he started to hunger for it wesley had what was in him and he was hungry for it and the pentecostal photographer amen yeah it's like the salvation army brother when when they were coming down near the end of of that age amen even the general william booth and his wife and they were they were preaching and preaching and preaching they said what we need is the baptism of the holy ghost amen they said what we need she said now is what they had on the day of pentecost in the bible amen praise the lord and the prophet of god said as a brother preacher brother did ask me and he said brother gerald he said what part does the salvation army have in what god has done i said you don't know that no he said i don't know it no i said yeah well i said uh i said the prophet of god told us and he said he did he said yeah and i was surprised that the brother didn't know it or hadn't read it or hadn't heard it on a tape somewhere i said yes he said that the methodists and the and the wesleys wesleyans i said they organized so quickly he said that god had to raise up willem booth with red hot salvation and he said to take the methodist message on to the pentecostal age praise the lord amen and i've got the books home where i've read in it where it said that william booth and his wife were preaching this that oh we need what they had on the day of pentecost we naked what they had on the day of pentecost amen and they preached it and praised your impression and finally in 1906 i believe it was the pentecostal revival in the united states came on the scene the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen plea god got a plan god got a pattern amen praise the lord brother what god has promised in his word he did amen and what god has promised in his word he's doing and what he's promising his word he will do please in the name of jesus let it be a reality to us amen in isaiah chapter 43 oh my over an hour already we have to turn the clock back amen in isaiah 43 and verse 1 oh we read it no part of it but let's read it again but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he see he creates us and it says and he that formed thee oh israel fear not for i ever redeem thee amen and i have called thee that's why we're here why god created us god formed us amen and god redeemed us amen and he has called us amen all that god has created all that god has formed amen amen all that god has redeemed he calls them in every age amen to come back to the word and he said thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when they walk is through the fire thou shalt not be burned praise the lord and neither shall the flame kindle upon thee well brother as i've said we see the fire of god judgment going around everywhere it is it's descending coming coming coming more and more and more amen but thou shalt not be burned the rest will be but not you amen for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and sheba for thee amen since that was precious in my sight i trust by grace we're precious in his sight amen representing jesus and he says since i was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee thank god amen therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee thank god i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far his sons yeah his sons and his daughters yeah true they would come back through christ bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth and he said in verse 10 ye are my witnesses saith the lord my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am ye before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me i even i am the lord and besides me there is no savior amen turn with me to ii corinthians chapter 6. praise the lord thank god for the word it's ordained to give us faith without the word you'll have no faith faith cometh by hearing the word amen and people feel that if i just go to church i hear the word i i got faith but they're not hearing the word in all those churches they're hearing some religious ideas and religious thoughts but they're not hearing the word of god they're not hearing the revelation of the will of god amen for the hour that they're living god did this god did that thank the lord hallelujah and god's going to do this thank the lord hallelujah but they're ignoring what he's doing amen what for to give them the faith for what he will do they don't know god help us in second corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers amen for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness now god help us and what communion had light with darkness he separated the light from the darkness amen he divided it amen so he said what communion has light with darkness and what concord at christ with billyell or what part is he that believeth with an infidel amen what agreement has the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god amazing praise the lord as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people does he dwell in you live in you and is he walking in you yes sister amen because i tell you if he wasn't in us we wouldn't walk the way we walk if he wasn't in us we wouldn't talk the way we talk amen we wouldn't be giving him the preeminence amen given his word the preeminence amen concerning the day and the hour that we're living in oh yeah we're not satisfied we just oh yeah yeah thank god for luther thank you lord amen oh i believe it i believe yeah but what about today oh i don't know don't know brother god's looking for not just for the faith in luther's hour god's looking for the faith in this day amen and brother the faith he required then was this the faith he's requiring now is this and what his faith came by the word amen because he went and he went and he went and i don't know how long that he was searching for searching for it wondering what he had to do wondering what he could do to be justified until finally he was overwhelmed and oh my exhausted till he came into the church he was oh my he's coming to the end that he that all after all these years he didn't he never found the revelation until finally he came into the church and into the vestibule and they had a bible on a table there and he just went over and he opened it up and he looked looked at it oh we're justified in jesus he said what he read it again oh jesus justified me oh he said it struck him and he was overwhelmed amen got the revelation in the word of god amen oh he made all kinds of sacrifices he did this he did that his good works and everything thinking that oh this will justify me that'll justify me then he came and he said show it in the word jesus justified him he struck him and he gave him the peace and the love and he started to cry and praise the lord and worship jesus thank you thank you thank you he went away with peace he was justified but still do you believe he smoked yes he smoked yeah and i sure might have been pipes that that spoke back then but he smoked yeah and he did this and he did that well that's as far as that's the revelation that god was looking for so he went forth and living praising the lord hallelujah thanking god amen but again as more and more light is revealed more and more revelation is revealed down through the ages where we're getting more and more separated unto the lord by the grace of god amen more and more celebrated on for the resurrection and for the rapture amen because brother but if but that's but god did what he wanted to do in the in the in the lutheran age in the methodist age the same thing in the pentecostal age where he was coming more and more into holiness and they were getting more and more revelation separate god was taking away the desire for sin taking away the desire for that the desire for that god help us amen brother till we get into another oh yeah i tell well tell you this oh my praise the lord god took away the the the desire for sin and luther and wesley but in wesley's age it was more they separated themselves from more unbelief more of the works of satan amen and in the pentecostal age it was even greater more and more separation why because what god had done what god was doing in that pentecostal age amen the anointing took this away from them took that away from them took this away why they were all becoming more and more and more new creatures in christ amen reflecting jesus more and more and more amen like the prophets of old that in the old testament they were reflecting jesus amen praise the lord and jesus they were prophets but they laid down their lives but they never picked them up again amen but jesus was the god prophet amen he laid down his life picked it up again praise the lord and he went on to this went on to that life that life that life amen and through the baptism of the holy ghost but then brother it all went into darkness and then god started to god started to redeem the church amen bring us to redemption in luther amen and and again they cease from this but not that but then in wesley's age oh my there's a greater separation from sin in the pentecostal age a greater separation from sin amen and now in the bright age it ought to be a greater separation from sin amen yeah the works of the flesh and also believe in the word or not believe in the word god help us the bride that goes in a resurrection rapture totally believes god she is separated unto the lord totally amen that he is our bridegroom and we are his bride god help us amen so he said again in corinthians what agreement is the temple of god with idols for year the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people amen that he's living in you praise the lord that's tremendous he's living in you you're spiritual you're spiritual in your thoughts spiritually in your words spiritually your deeds your counsel yeah by the grace of god amen and he said wherefore come out from among them and be separate said the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty amen brother and it calls for a total separation from unbelief a total separation from the thoughts of man to the revelation of god amen is not what i think it's not what i see is what god reveals amen by grace so i can't again i want to i don't have time oh so just to share with you a couple of the quotes and we can share others later but you find in the scriptures god always has and always will require separation amen and now he should the thought of god's word after he read his scripture he said is calling a total separation and we only know this as we read the word and see the word manifest itself he said god separated the light from the darkness so the word of god began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning so does it remain till this day amen and he said as i said last night of jesus when he was only 12 years old and being a mistake of his mother who claimed by people to be the mother of god and now that the woman said why thy father and i have sought thee with tears and quickly he being the word said knowest thou that i must be about my father's business she says my father and i have sought thee with tears we've been looking for you but he was in the temple teaching the elders amen he was 12 years old amen see she was declaring him to be joseph's son but he wasn't joseph's son and if he had been joseph's son he had been with him but he he was with the father amen about his business so the word is always corrective and always write and the word will correct every wrong amen amen amen the holy ghost is there to convict us and brother we're gonna we're gonna sense that quite often why because we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen this sinful this body we came by by way of the original sin amen oh yeah and that sin as an influence in our lives yeah oh it does thank god but only when you get in a new body it won't be there that's right that original sin you know what i'm talking about yeah by the grace of god but thank god he's given us grace to control it that original sin oh yeah by the grace of god amen so i i said i'm not going to say what it was you know what it was we could mention that some other time amen but pray the grace of god in your experience with jesus that you control hit and it doesn't control you amen amen because we are all came by as a result of that original sin that's why we're born in sin it's because we came that way amen that's not to see people don't understand you know they think it's just just the thought of god oh god said this so i believe god that we were born in sin you know and that's why i have this nature and so on but they don't stop to consider how they were conceived and how they were born god had mercy on us amen but god is there by the holy ghost amen to give us more and more and more control over the sin in the flesh amen to god be the glory amen grace brother because i know that sometimes people just don't don't quite catch it concerning that original sin until until one time a certain brother approached me and he said brother girl i want you to pray for so and so and i said oh i said what's the need oh he said well it has to do with the original sin but they're not fulfilling it in in their marriage life they wouldn't do this and wouldn't do this and wouldn't do that well well maybe they were entering the will of god for the birth of a seed of god because the prophet said that he said serpent seed can bring forth the seed of god and he said there's seed of god sons and daughters king that the woman can give birth to a serpent seed oh yeah that's definitely god help us to recognize it god help us to give us his leadership in it and his control by grace amen grace i said all right brother i'll pray grace god's grace to him i said he needs to they need to come to a greater revelation of what it's all about amen amen see christ being the word said knowest thou not that i must be about my father's business amen and she was declaring him to be joseph's son but he wasn't he had been with him but he was with the father about his business so the word is always corrective always right and the word will correct every wrong always amen praise the lord let the word correct you not my will father thine be done grace amen remember again he said he separated the light from the darkness he said let there be light and it's been doing that ever since separating light from darkness and god's word was also separated the water from the land in the beginning god spoke and the water was separated from the land amen by the grace of god well yeah that's why we have the oceans but we have the land as a sister an elderly sister that was in some years ago in a senior's home in saint john's it was the glen brook lodge and i was there as i did as i said i ministered every month in their chapel and uh again thank god to god be the glory that we're only allowed a half hour but i always took an hour one hour and i came out one day and this manager of the home or the the one that run the home was sitting on a chair outside the chapel and i said oh i said i'm sorry i said i don't mean to take so long he said brother pastor he said i haven't heard one complaint he said do as you feel led to do that's good okay and he said not only that but he said when you come to minister he says that's when the chapel is full and i said oh it's paul yes he said it's full he said but he said all other chapels services he said there's only a few in there oh i said okay thank you that's encouraging amen because they're coming to hear the word and i and i i would talk to them after and this old woman and old old brother would come out and say oh my we've heard never heard that before thank you that was wonderful they said oh what you say in 20 minutes they said no they said what the others say say in 20 minutes he said no he says what'd you say in 20 minutes the others they'll say it takes them all year to say it he said they they can't really say it the way you say it oh i said well do god be the glory well he said it's wonderful praise the lord so i went to this sister one time they came to me and they said pastor sister this lady wants to see you she's in her room and she's sick so i went in and she said oh i just i got a question she said she said when it comes to the earth she said how is the earth going to take all those that jesus has saved down through 6 000 years she said where where are they going to stay where they're going to live she said you know trust me there's not that much land out there i said that's right but i said he's going to he's going to reduce the oceans and the water i said there's not going to be much water so there's going to be a river but not oceans and i said all that is going to come back to to as earth again oh and i say why i said because i said there's so many more coming in eternity in the new heaven new earth i said that's go that's where they're going to live out there the bride's going to live in the city oh yeah but we're going to live they're going to live outside amenities all of all over the earth by the grace of god because the the jerusalem we're going to by the grace of god it's going to be what is it it's going to be 1500 miles i believe it is wide and all it's going to be square and it's going to be like a pyramid amen it's going to be 1500 miles this way and and and the square and he said it go 15 miles up in the middle 1500 miles in the middle praise the lord amen i said that's going to be a big city oh yes he said it's going to be a big city but it's going to be 1500 miles it's not like i heard a preacher preaching in a denominational church one time all to respect him and he was preaching about the new jerusalem but to him he made the people believe that it was square it's going to be coming it's like a square chunk and it's going to be 1500 miles up across and down you know but no it's it's coming 1500 miles at the foundation amen but when it comes to and it'll be 15 mile 100 miles up high but it's like it's like a a pyramid amen now where in the world you're going to live in a city that that's there's a square block you know 1500 miles wide narrow high you know all around the foundations and everything i said lord i said i don't understand i said why he believes that i said that's not normal but the foundation it's going to be like a pyramid by the grace of god and the bride is going to sit with him amen the bride's going to have access amen by the grace of god and if you you want a copy of it you want to like a little more testimony of it go yeah you won't be able to go now but if you had the opportunity you go to the pyramids in egypt amen wonderful it's amazing because in the pyramid one of the pyramids in egypt oh yeah they got a door to go in and you can go down and you can go up and you climb climb climb you've got you got steps for this level of that level and finally the steps at the top is seven steps for the last to the last level amen and it's where the king dwells amen and you can climb climb climb up those seven steps and here's the king amen and the queen is going to sit with him in his throne amen it's going to be that new jerusalem so by the grace of god i trust we're going to be there amen in the new jerusalem and there were those that were thinking that well where is it going to be well the prophet did i like the fact that it could be somewhere where in the area where israel is but it's not going to be there be no mediterranean sea won't be there for sure the dead sea won't be there sure that and uh but it could be in that area when it comes to 1500 miles because israel is not that not very big you know because again some of us had been to israel and so on so it's not not big and it may take longer to go around newfoundland than it would be israel so so thank thank god for that but i don't know where it's going to be others were saying it's going to be in in the united states i don't think so no definitely not and they even they even gave us the names of the place in states where where was going to be i said no no no no no and the prophet of god delight he said oh it's gonna cover all of jerusalem all of israel and and cover this and cover that all he said when it goes it'll go from there down to here there over there he was explaining it so thank god glory i pray grace that we're going to be there in the new jerusalem amen by the grace of god i'll let the finish with a quote here amen and like i said we'll try to finish the rest of it in the next service god in the beginning again he said he separated the light from the darkness and it's been doing that ever since separating light from darkness so if there's anything that's darkness in your in your heart or in your in your life not your heart but in your life any darkness that you're involved with or caught up with god's going to separate us from it remember it's got to be a total separation for the resurrection and the rapture oh yeah totally brother i tell you this the prophet did say he said you know and when that rapture happens when the resurrection takes place he said what's going to happen well he said you could be walking down here and you'll see somebody who's that oh oh that's that's my brother oh we're he's he's dead no he's come back from that other dimension because the dead in christ are going to appear to the living saints amen and then we re some i tell you the rest of the world won't recognize them but if you're seed of god you'll recognize them amen praise the lord so you'll recognize them and you're going to be cut into that dimension with them and we're going to be in glorified bodies and look up and there's jesus amen because that pillar of fire christ and the pillar of fire will rise up and he'll go up and get into that body called jesus and come back down to receive us unto himself how many want to see him probably god said he wanted to enter us to introduce us to jesus but then then he said he himself he wanted to crawl up and put his hands on jesus feet and bow to him yeah grace of god thank you jesus amen he said the water was separated from the land well god's going to do away with most of the water and there'll be a testimony of that in in revelation chapter 21 i believe it is grace it says god never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word and god had a reason for speaking that word tonight he is not like you and i or especially myself he said that speaks so many foolish things god speaks every word with a meaning and something that he is trying to achieve and will achieve by his word and it will perform exactly what he said it will do and if god said let there be light there was and there was no light he said it wasn't god that said it or he said when god says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of god has been vindicated the word has been vindicated that is light and he said the word itself isn't light until it is a vindicated light amen god said let there be light amen now today said if god has made a promise and he said when that promise is vindicated then that is light that's the light of the day when the word is vindicated he said the word for the hour is vindicated amen the word that we're believing and pressing on amen he spoke and separated the waters from the sea and then also he separated in genesis life from death and if we believe the word of god it's the word of life to us but if we question the word of god it's death to us amen like eve eve questioned one little face of god's word and what did it do caused all this trouble that we have today but you see there came death and god also at an atonement being merciful to us he accepted a substitute death for their death amen he separated life from death in the garden of eden he did it by his word amen and he is still speaking his word of life to those who want to believe it amen you got to want the word of god you want to god want the revelation oh yeah amen because your relationship with god it doesn't just begin when a person comes to an altar or you say lord i receive you as my savior and you go on just being religious so i'll come to the church you know sunday and wednesday or whatever yeah i'll do this and do that no it's your life everyday living by the grace of god yeah jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great and final day when we ascend into the presence of god quraish there will be a final separation and he will separate the sheep from the goats grace that we're all sheep amen amen god will continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does he separates faith from unbelief amen pray grace that we're getting more and more into the oneness with our lord jesus christ that we believe his word thank you lord thank you jesus keep keep ministering lord keep separating us more and more and keep you bringing us into a unity with you amen brother total separation from unbelief that's what god is doing why are we still here maybe god is waiting to get there's a few more out there that needs to be separated you're not going to get caught up with the foolish of this world no not by any means you love the lord he loves you you want to please him amen you want to believe all that he says and all that he does you want god to use you amen lord whatever you want me to do i'll do it yeah by grace amazing you know amen sometimes we want to be want to be this god wants us to be this you know that's like that's right it's like i said uh god had a reason for putting me through so many jobs different things and yes i was a janitor and as our brother bound down here with his charitarian business i was a janitor oh yeah and uh for for a certain period of time here in the city of st john's and i did janitorial work you did i said yeah whatever god wants me to do is the lord i'll do it yeah and so i went into a certain story recently and i said oh i was talking to somebody this is amazing they said why i said oh i guess it's almost 50 years ago i said i was a janitor here in that building i said yeah oh yes i did it yeah and i did this and i did that and did this and did that i said i didn't mind whatever god want me to do i'll do it yeah so god bless our brother kingsley amen in his job by the grace of god amen so let's do what god wants us to do let's follow his leadership amen he wants to give give us this experience that experience this one that one amen to the grace of god and he said god will continually constantly told us that there is a separation and we find the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we ascend into the presence of god there will be a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats and continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight he separates faith from unbelief and we find out in number six chapter that a nazarite call and nazareth call was to separate themselves from all the world to the word of god that's a nazarite call separated he said samson was us nazareth unto the lord and god separated him amen i believe tonight that every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of god is a nazarite on to the lord and you'll experience god's separation from the world the things of the world by the grace of god amen we'll leave it there and it's page four so we cut some of it we'll see what the lord would lead us to do okay but lord but brother sister my encouragement is please in the name of jesus consider what god is doing in your life on a daily basis and don't fail to recognize if god is doing something in your life separation if god has separated you from this separating from that god don't want you to get involved with this don't want to get involved with that by the grace of god lord why is it sometimes god help us that we're not going to blame the devil brother if it's if it's satan god permitting the devil to do it oh yeah last god will do that so brother i pray the grace of god that we'll pray about it and say lord this is your will amen praise the name of the lord so remember when things going on in your life going on in your life lord why are you permitting this why are you permitting that the lord is is it that you want me separate from this separate from that what is it lord amen it could be god working out total separation from unbelief in your life amen so we'll get into some of the thoughts that the prophet brings out in that message concerning separation where when how oh well uh i i don't maybe some of you did but now oh you went to the pubs you went there and there oh lord i don't go there no more i'm separated from them now no it could that separation could come closer oh yeah maybe god wants you to separate from this separate from that separate for something else separate from that one god help us god help us god bless you let's stand and let's sing brother advisor thing are you washed in the blood amen it's 4 17 4 17. have you been to jesus for the cleansing power are you washed in the blood of the lamb are you fully trusting in his grace this hour are you washed at the blood of the lamb
