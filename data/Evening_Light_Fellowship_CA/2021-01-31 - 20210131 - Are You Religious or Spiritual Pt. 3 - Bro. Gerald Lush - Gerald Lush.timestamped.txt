[45:28] he's not a politician amen
[45:31] thank the lord for that and uh but
[45:34] i but still i think their believers get
[45:36] caught up in politics but i don't
[45:38] and again as i said before let me repeat
[45:40] it that uh there was a time when
[45:43] a politician did come knock on my door
[45:46] and wanted to know if i voted
[45:47] i said no i said i've never voted he
[45:50] said
[45:51] why i said well i said what's his name
[45:56] the the the cartoon rabbit
[46:01] bugs bunny i said bugs bunny is not
[46:02] running so
[46:05] so i said i i don't vote always said i
[46:08] see
[46:09] that was it and he moved on
[46:14] he wasn't he wasn't bugs bunny amen
[46:17] so thank the lord and again i don't know
[46:19] if brother brown ever ever
[46:22] voted in an election and uh
[46:25] i'm not sure now i've heard it before
[46:27] that it might if he did it might have
[46:28] been just once
[46:29] but he never bothered after that amen
[46:32] because boy
[46:33] we want we want to elect jesus amen
[46:36] it's not this gentleman that gentleman
[46:38] this woman that won't elect jesus
[46:40] and that's all now more and more part of
[46:42] the world
[46:43] when it comes to politics it's not like
[46:45] it used to be no no
[46:47] not not by any means why because one
[46:49] time when we were younger
[46:51] the even politicians were saying but now
[46:53] they're insane
[46:54] oh yeah it's all getting to that place
[46:57] insanity
[46:58] and they're governed we're governed by a
[46:59] lot of thoughts but it's not normal
[47:01] thoughts anymore

[49:45] truly
[49:45] we are at the end of all things as i
[49:48] said
[49:49] if god invented the tape recorders to
[49:51] tape the messages
[49:53] so god allowed the internet to come to
[49:55] get the gospel around the world
[49:57] amen it's absolutely amazing so god's
[50:00] grace to us
[50:01] as we move on but look up
[50:04] we're moving on to the resurrection
[50:06] moving on to the rapture
[50:07] we're moving on to get out of here amen
[50:10] because if you got if you're saying you
[50:12] this is the most uncomfortable place for
[50:14] you amen
[50:16] if you've got sanity nothing normally
[50:18] anymore i thought about it
[50:19] and i said lord this is not the world we
[50:21] lived in
[50:22] even a few years ago and most definitely
[50:25] not the world we lived in when i was
[50:27] maybe in my 20s even first coming to
[50:29] this word coming to this message
[50:31] oh my i said lord i said we need your
[50:33] help amen
[50:35] by the grace of god to move on with with
[50:37] him
[50:38] it's finished why why would we call him
[50:41] for that
[50:42] because he said when he comes will he
[50:43] find faith on the earth
[50:45] amen that's that's how bad it's going to
[50:47] be spiritually
[50:48] there's going to be so little little
[50:50] faith so god have mercy on us brother
[50:53] says let's make make our calling
[50:54] election sure
[50:56] by the grace of god lord trust me by
[50:58] grace that we're going to be numbered
[50:59] with those that are
[51:00] going in the resurrection that are going
[51:02] in the rapture
[51:03] amen so brother this is the this is the
[51:06] only way
[51:07] out of this world and into what god has
[51:09] promised in his word
[51:10] amen and there's no doubt this is why he
[51:13] he predestinated it
[51:15] and he forned the ministry of a prophet
[51:17] in the last days
[51:19] amen that he would minister through that
[51:21] the same ministry the same message that
[51:23] he had when he was here on the earth
[51:25] 2000 years ago
[51:26] it's absolutely amazing so we thank god
[51:29] for it and
[51:30] i pray lord help us to believe amen that
[51:33] we're not going to run away
[51:34] but we're going to stay with the word by
[51:36] the grace of god
[51:38] amen so that that's how serious it is
[51:41] and it's getting more and more serious
[51:43] when we consider the fact that even
[51:45] so-called message believers
[51:46] are getting less and less and less
[51:48] spiritual amen
[51:50] and that spirit of the world the spirit
[51:51] of a church just
[51:53] that religious spirits amen not the holy
[51:56] ghost
[51:57] no definitely not so we pray the grace
[52:00] of god that we're going to stay under
[52:01] the anointing of the holy ghost
[52:03] we're not going to move away to a
[52:04] religious spirit amen
[52:06] and and the religious spirit will focus
[52:09] on what is religious spirit focusing on
[52:12] is focusing on doctrines and certain
[52:14] theology
[52:16] but the spiritual anointing in the bride
[52:18] is focusing on the resurrection
[52:20] and the rapture it's focusing on what
[52:23] god has promised for this age amen by
[52:26] the grace of god
[52:28] so help us to keep focusing on the
[52:29] resurrection help us to keep focusing on
[52:32] the rapture
[52:32] by the grace of god you want to go
[52:35] that's the only way out of here now
[52:37] is resurrection and rapture so i pray
[52:40] grace to us
[52:41] amen that we're going to believe the
[52:43] word we're going to keep moving into the
[52:45] message
[52:46] and we're what are we looking for
[52:48] brother it's not just
[52:49] this idea on this doctrine of that
[52:51] doctrine no what we're looking for is
[52:53] more
[52:53] and more and more rapturing faith amen
[52:56] so that god's going to increase our
[52:58] faith and brother we need it
[53:00] by the grace of god so brother one thing
[53:03] to believe for this
[53:04] believe for that but brother are we
[53:06] believing for the rapture
[53:08] are we hungry and thirsting for the
[53:09] rapture to get out of here

[53:18] into the word
[53:19] to line up with the word face the
[53:20] challenge of the word amen
[53:22] so we're not just religious believing
[53:24] doctrines no no

[53:29] it is god
[53:30] working on me working on you to get us

[1:00:39] amen praise the lord god bless you turn
[1:00:42] with me to
[1:00:43] first corinthians chapter 2.
[1:00:52] that some of these scriptures that we
[1:00:54] have read but
[1:00:56] do worth reading again
[1:00:59] amen in first corinthians chapter 2
[1:01:03] and beginning to read at verse 9
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:11] but as it is written the eye hath not
[1:01:15] seen
[1:01:16] nor the ear heard neither have entered
[1:01:19] into the heart of man
[1:01:21] the things which god has prepared for
[1:01:23] them
[1:01:24] that love him but thank god for the holy
[1:01:27] ghost anointing that does reveal to us
[1:01:30] amen thank you for god for the new birth
[1:01:32] so that he reveals it to us in our soul
[1:01:36] amen it says again
[1:01:40] neither entered into the heart of man
[1:01:41] the things which god has prepared for
[1:01:44] them that
[1:01:45] love him amen but god hath revealed them
[1:01:50] unto us by his spirit
[1:01:54] for the spirit searches all things
[1:01:57] yea the deep things of god
[1:02:01] amen for what man knoweth the things of
[1:02:04] a man
[1:02:05] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:02:09] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:02:13] but the spirit of god see
[1:02:16] we know we absolutely need and recognize
[1:02:19] our need for their indwelling presence
[1:02:22] of god
[1:02:23] in the holy ghost amen
[1:02:26] verse 11 for what man knoweth the things
[1:02:28] of a man save the spirit of man which is
[1:02:30] in him
[1:02:31] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:02:34] but the spirit of god amen
[1:02:37] so we need the spirit to reveal to us
[1:02:41] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:02:43] the world
[1:02:44] but the spirit which is of god
[1:02:47] that we might know the things that are
[1:02:50] freely given to us
[1:02:52] of god amen praise the lord
[1:02:56] so brother it's not just believing say
[1:02:58] well jesus did this jesus did that
[1:03:00] thank the lord and move on but they're
[1:03:02] ignoring the presence tense revelation
[1:03:04] of jesus
[1:03:05] what's jesus doing he did it what's he
[1:03:09] doing now
[1:03:10] amen we need to the revelation of the
[1:03:12] present tense
[1:03:15] and so we have received not the spirit
[1:03:17] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:03:19] god
[1:03:19] that we might know the things that are
[1:03:22] freely given to us
[1:03:23] of god amen which sings also we speak
[1:03:28] not in the words which man's wisdom
[1:03:30] teacheth
[1:03:31] by which the holy ghost teacheth
[1:03:33] comparing
[1:03:34] spiritual things with spiritual amen
[1:03:38] not religion not a religious spirit but
[1:03:42] the holy ghost amen let's compare
[1:03:45] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:03:47] and to do that we have to stay with the
[1:03:49] word but the natural man
[1:03:52] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:03:54] of god
[1:03:55] for they are foolishness unto him and
[1:03:58] neither can he know them
[1:03:59] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:04:02] amen and that's why we're here in such a
[1:04:05] small group
[1:04:06] amen because it's going to get smaller
[1:04:09] and smaller and smaller
[1:04:10] yeah maybe the lord has stayed a little
[1:04:13] longer
[1:04:14] until the older ones here be gone on
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:17] so we pray the grace of god and we pray
[1:04:19] the grace of god amen to our young
[1:04:21] brothers and sisters here
[1:04:23] that you're going to stay with the word
[1:04:24] amen that you're going to see it
[1:04:26] the reality of it in your mother in your
[1:04:28] father in your grandparents
[1:04:30] amen that you know that it's not just
[1:04:32] religion no no
[1:04:33] it's the living god living in us
[1:04:36] amen fulfilling his word
[1:04:40] verse 13 which sings also we speak
[1:04:43] not in the words which man's wisdom
[1:04:45] teacheth but which the holy ghost
[1:04:47] teacheth
[1:04:48] comparing spiritual things with
[1:04:51] spiritual
[1:04:52] amen but the natural man receiveth not
[1:04:55] the things of the spirit of god
[1:04:57] for they are foolishness unto him and
[1:05:00] neither can he know them
[1:05:02] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:05:06] amen showing the the need
[1:05:09] to be spiritual and not religious amen
[1:05:13] but he that is spiritual judges all
[1:05:16] things
[1:05:17] yet he himself is judged of no man
[1:05:21] for who has known the mind of the lord
[1:05:24] that he may
[1:05:25] instruct him amen but we
[1:05:28] have the mind of christ god bless his
[1:05:31] word you may be seated and let's go on
[1:05:32] to chapter 3. and read it again
[1:05:37] verses one two six amen let's pay
[1:05:40] attention to what the
[1:05:41] what the word is saying concerning being
[1:05:44] spiritual
[1:05:44] amen and it's spiritual people that god
[1:05:47] uses
[1:05:48] it's the spiritual sons and daughters of
[1:05:50] god that god is
[1:05:51] is revealing his word to amen we if
[1:05:54] there's
[1:05:55] brothers anything that we need to make
[1:05:56] sure that we have and that it's a
[1:05:58] spiritual relationship with god
[1:06:01] amen brother grace so that we're not
[1:06:03] just here
[1:06:04] all because of religion because of a
[1:06:06] doctrine this doctrine this doctrine no
[1:06:08] it's an experience
[1:06:10] it's our relationship with the lord and
[1:06:12] in our experience in our relationship
[1:06:14] with the lord he is there
[1:06:15] to reveal his word amen what for
[1:06:18] he is there to reveal what he will give
[1:06:21] us the faith that pleases him in the
[1:06:23] hour that we're living
[1:06:24] amen again that's praise the lord for
[1:06:27] the revelation
[1:06:28] that's why that luther you know he had
[1:06:30] the faith
[1:06:32] what pleased god in that hour and that
[1:06:33] age why because
[1:06:35] he was ongoing and thirsting for it amen
[1:06:37] and god
[1:06:38] revealed it to him the same for wesley
[1:06:40] the same for
[1:06:41] many other groups and the same for the
[1:06:43] pentecostals they were angry and
[1:06:45] thirsting and
[1:06:46] amen why god brother brown said he said
[1:06:49] god he said always sends the holy ghost
[1:06:51] ahead he said to create in our hearts
[1:06:54] a hundred of thirsts for what he's going
[1:06:56] to do amen
[1:06:57] so that brings god on the scene amen to
[1:07:00] do what
[1:07:01] just to do this just to do that no it's
[1:07:03] going to be according to the word
[1:07:05] amen so we know that god came on the
[1:07:07] scene and luther and that was god what
[1:07:09] was he doing
[1:07:10] doing what he's promised to do i will
[1:07:11] restore said the lord
[1:07:13] amen so they had a revelation of that of
[1:07:16] that restoration in the days of luther
[1:07:18] in the days of wesley in the days of the
[1:07:20] old
[1:07:20] salvation army and in the days of
[1:07:22] pentecost amen
[1:07:24] hungry and thirsting for the word amen
[1:07:26] well that's good
[1:07:28] but what's that word going to do god
[1:07:29] through the word is going to give us
[1:07:31] faith
[1:07:32] amen and there's going to be the faith
[1:07:34] for that hour for that age that you need
[1:07:36] so brother sister again thank god for
[1:07:39] the faith that luther had and
[1:07:40] even the pentecostal said but i tell
[1:07:42] them we're going to need a greater faith
[1:07:44] than that now amen most definitely
[1:07:47] because what they experienced god given
[1:07:49] the victory over it and they moved on
[1:07:51] but brother what you and i are
[1:07:52] experiencing amen in this hour
[1:07:55] in this age that it is so bad that jesus
[1:07:58] said when he comes will he
[1:08:00] find faith amen because amen because
[1:08:03] most are caught up maybe into religion
[1:08:06] but again that's not what god's looking
[1:08:07] for he's looking for faith in the
[1:08:10] revealed word
[1:08:11] amen and it's the faith that's going to
[1:08:14] bring the past the word ordain
[1:08:16] and predestinate it for the hour that
[1:08:17] we're living amen
[1:08:19] and brother again thank god for what he
[1:08:21] did in previous ages what he did through
[1:08:22] previous messengers
[1:08:24] but brother thank god for what he's
[1:08:25] doing now amen
[1:08:27] because what we need now is to get out
[1:08:29] of here amen
[1:08:30] those brothers and sisters were there
[1:08:32] and they were living living for god
[1:08:34] and and they did their lives reflected
[1:08:37] god reflected the word
[1:08:38] that was ordained then amen but as i
[1:08:41] said
[1:08:42] oh my god requires more of us now than
[1:08:45] he did of them
[1:08:46] amen we know that they did this and they
[1:08:48] did that
[1:08:49] amen but in this hour god's requiring
[1:08:51] more
[1:08:52] amen and what what is it he is bringing
[1:08:54] a greater
[1:08:55] and a greater separation amen from the
[1:08:59] world
[1:08:59] and a greater separation from the things
[1:09:02] of the world
[1:09:02] than previous ages than previous
[1:09:04] messages amen
[1:09:06] for god has ordained in this hour and in
[1:09:08] this message
[1:09:09] amen to bring us to a complete absolute
[1:09:12] separation
[1:09:13] unto the lord amen so we are totally
[1:09:16] separated unto him
[1:09:17] and we are totally given over to the to
[1:09:19] the word of god for this hour
[1:09:21] we're looking for a man not what well
[1:09:23] the others look for it after
[1:09:25] after they left the scene after they
[1:09:27] went off the earth but now there's a
[1:09:29] generation rising on the earth
[1:09:31] that god is giving them a revelation to
[1:09:33] look for the resurrection
[1:09:35] god has given us a revelation to believe
[1:09:38] for the rapture
[1:09:39] do we really really believe that there
[1:09:42] that the resurrection is on
[1:09:44] amen do we really believe the rapture is
[1:09:46] on the prophet said he said the rapture
[1:09:48] is going on all the time
[1:09:49] amen praise the lord what do you mean
[1:09:53] it's going on all the time because god
[1:09:55] is revealing his word and we're maturing
[1:09:57] in the word all the time
[1:09:59] amen and the climax of it is going to be
[1:10:01] the rapture
[1:10:02] the climax of it is going to be the
[1:10:04] change of our bodies brother

[1:10:15] from from
[1:10:16] everything else and you're totally
[1:10:17] separated onto this
[1:10:19] it's not god did this and he's going to
[1:10:21] do this no brother
[1:10:22] we've come to the end of the gentile
[1:10:24] dispensation
[1:10:25] amen and he's making an end of all that
[1:10:28] he has predestinated and for ordained
[1:10:30] for the gentiles amen now it's finished
[1:10:33] there was an hour when he turned from
[1:10:35] the jews back 2 000 years ago

[1:10:40] he's moving from the gentiles back to

[1:13:48] he said amen in those heavenly places in
[1:13:51] christ
[1:13:51] he said christ is revealing his word
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:54] what for to give us the resurrection
[1:13:58] yes and the rapture to give us the faith
[1:13:59] for the resurrection

[1:14:05] and
[1:14:06] their other sanctification then the
[1:14:07] pentecostals they were cut up

[1:14:28] that and that will rapture us into glory
[1:14:31] amen let's get caught up in the revealed
[1:14:33] word for this hour
[1:14:34] amen that's focusing on the resurrection
[1:14:36] focusing on the rapture
[1:14:38] amen it's just not focusing what what
[1:14:40] what is the church is focusing on now
[1:14:42] what are what are the preachers focusing
[1:14:44] on amen or they're focusing on what god
[1:14:46] did
[1:14:47] and what god oh god wants you to come
[1:14:49] and do this god wants you to come
[1:14:51] and accept jesus yeah brother i tell you
[1:14:53] this
[1:14:54] it's more than just making you a church
[1:14:56] goer amen
[1:14:58] praise the lord it's getting us to look
[1:14:59] beyond the church and look up
[1:15:02] amen others are just looking to the
[1:15:04] church they're looking in the church
[1:15:06] looking down at this looking down at
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:08] but the bride is looking up amen because
[1:15:11] what god has done
[1:15:12] and what god is doing is predestinated
[1:15:15] to get us to look up
[1:15:18] anything that god is looking for in your
[1:15:20] life and in my life
[1:15:21] anything god is looking for in your
[1:15:23] heart and your soul amen

[1:15:37] to what we need now and brother i don't
[1:15:39] know there's not
[1:15:40] i don't i don't think there's many want
[1:15:42] to get out of here they're just moving
[1:15:43] on and believing the message oh this is
[1:15:45] wonderful and
[1:15:46] and and oil they'll praise god for this
[1:15:48] praise god for that yeah but what's it
[1:15:50] doing in you amen
[1:15:53] praise the lord so i pray the grace of
[1:15:55] god that we're into the revelation
[1:15:57] a man that pleases god and that
[1:15:59] revelation
[1:16:00] is giving us the faith i'll tell you we
[1:16:03] need now
[1:16:04] amen we do and brother i pray you keep
[1:16:07] focusing on it
[1:16:09] when it comes to the written word keep
[1:16:11] focusing on
[1:16:12] the resurrection the rapture amen if
[1:16:14] you're spiritual
[1:16:16] and not religious if you're spiritual
[1:16:18] brother the holy ghost is there to focus
[1:16:19] you on
[1:16:20] what he's doing and what he wants to do
[1:16:23] amen when it comes to the resurrection
[1:16:25] and rapture so brother
[1:16:27] again not not just to the revealed word
[1:16:31] but it's the written word brother and
[1:16:33] the revealed word has got to
[1:16:35] got to correspond and blend with the
[1:16:37] review the written word
[1:16:39] amen brother what we're pre what we're
[1:16:41] preaching what we're believing here
[1:16:43] we've got to have the proof of it here
[1:16:46] oh yeah or is that in the word did god
[1:16:48] say this yes god said this
[1:16:50] amen so the grace of god that we
[1:16:53] stay with the word amen
[1:16:56] brother is not and again it's not our
[1:16:58] idea of religion and our idea of the
[1:17:00] message
[1:17:00] is god's yes and that's why the prophet
[1:17:02] of god said
[1:17:03] even before he left the scene he knew he
[1:17:06] was going to leave
[1:17:06] he said here i am he said at 56 years
[1:17:08] old i see my inn coming
[1:17:10] he said at 56. yeah that was in
[1:17:13] around easter time in 1965 and before
[1:17:16] christmas time
[1:17:17] he died amen so brother
[1:17:20] is to focus on what god wants us to
[1:17:22] focus on
[1:17:23] believe what god wants us to believe
[1:17:25] amen and get the faith that god wants us
[1:17:28] to have
[1:17:29] amen do you have the faith that pleases
[1:17:30] god amen
[1:17:32] and if you have the faith that pleases
[1:17:34] god it's focusing
[1:17:36] on the resurrection and the rapture
[1:17:39] brother's not focusing on on the years
[1:17:40] past
[1:17:41] not focusing on even even 60 years ago
[1:17:44] no way
[1:17:45] brother i tell you this because god in
[1:17:47] the ministry of william branham
[1:17:49] changed his ministry amen and he went
[1:17:52] from the signs and the wonders
[1:17:53] because god said leave it don't do that
[1:17:55] no more because the people are leaning
[1:17:57] on a signpost
[1:17:59] amen and they are and they have been for
[1:18:02] years
[1:18:03] and brother if there's anything they're
[1:18:04] looking for in a ministry it's signs and
[1:18:06] wonders
[1:18:07] but i tell you it's the end now and
[1:18:08] god's looking for the resurrection
[1:18:10] rapture

[1:25:25] amen he's going to keep bringing you
[1:25:27] back to the word
[1:25:28] amen brothers as jesus met again the
[1:25:31] woman at the well and he just expounded
[1:25:33] to her the word
[1:25:34] amen this and this oh she said we know
[1:25:37] that when messiah comes he'll do
[1:25:39] tell us those things he said i am
[1:25:42] i am that messiah and she ran into the
[1:25:46] city
[1:25:47] amen oh she never i don't i don't think
[1:25:49] that they respected her very much in the
[1:25:51] city
[1:25:52] amen considering who she was and what
[1:25:53] she had done but i tell you hallelujah
[1:25:56] jesus respected her
[1:25:57] amen and that's what puzzled the
[1:25:59] disciples
[1:26:01] when oh they were waiting down there but
[1:26:03] jesus when he saw this woman he
[1:26:05] moved over to the well you know why
[1:26:07] because that was a tradition in israel
[1:26:09] brother because those that never had a
[1:26:12] good reputation
[1:26:13] or they they had a certain time to go to
[1:26:15] the well and get water
[1:26:17] amen and then there was another time
[1:26:19] well where the so-called you know real
[1:26:22] true
[1:26:23] believers or whatever they were gentiles
[1:26:25] they would go
[1:26:26] at another time but jesus went up when
[1:26:28] that woman was there
[1:26:32] oh lord something wrong amen
[1:26:35] surely they were they would accuse jesus
[1:26:37] of breaking the law of god
[1:26:39] no no he was the law of god amen
[1:26:42] and he he knew he knew who she was he
[1:26:45] knew
[1:26:46] what she was guilty of amen oh
[1:26:49] she told he he told her this he told her
[1:26:52] that oh my
[1:26:53] you must be the messiah massage is going
[1:26:55] to do that he said i am
[1:26:57] amen just saying she ran into the city
[1:27:00] she never had much of reputation for
[1:27:02] herself
[1:27:03] no she didn't mind she said oh come come
[1:27:05] come come see a man
[1:27:07] who told me all that i did yes yeah he
[1:27:10] revealed this she revealed that
[1:27:12] oh and she was caught up she was caught
[1:27:15] up into a heavenly place
[1:27:16] amen and she went went testifying to the
[1:27:19] rest of those in in the city there
[1:27:21] and come she said it's not this the
[1:27:23] messiah
[1:27:24] amen she believed it and some of the
[1:27:26] others believed and no doubt they didn't
[1:27:28] stay with it
[1:27:29] grace to us amen and grace to us to stay
[1:27:32] with what god
[1:27:33] is doing in this hour amen
[1:27:36] let's not focus on what he did oh yeah
[1:27:39] the the this church over there that's
[1:27:40] what god did
[1:27:41] a hundred years ago what he did you know
[1:27:44] over a thousand years ago
[1:27:46] that's what he did two thousand years
[1:27:47] ago listen
[1:27:49] what's he doing now amen
[1:27:52] and this is where so many fail amen to
[1:27:55] to find the lord and to find what god is
[1:27:58] doing what god wants to do
[1:28:00] is why because of their religion and
[1:28:03] what
[1:28:03] do they see this is he that but not the
[1:28:05] revealed word
[1:28:07] amen amen anything that the true elect
[1:28:09] of god wants
[1:28:11] is is to know where god is and what
[1:28:13] god's doing now
[1:28:15] i know where he was 55 60 years ago in
[1:28:18] pentecost
[1:28:19] and what he was doing what's he doing
[1:28:20] now because as i said as a young man and
[1:28:23] a teenager in pentecost
[1:28:24] and i went into a pentecostal church and
[1:28:26] they preached and they preached and we
[1:28:28] were screaming and praising the lord
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:30] and at the end of the service got around
[1:28:32] the altar got done on our knees
[1:28:34] and we were praying and screaming and
[1:28:36] praising the lord and i remember one
[1:28:37] time on a wednesday night service we
[1:28:39] went
[1:28:39] we went into that church and and for a
[1:28:42] part of it
[1:28:43] we were worshiping god singing the
[1:28:44] praises of god then the anointing came
[1:28:46] down and
[1:28:47] and everybody began to get up and
[1:28:49] worship and there was a lot of
[1:28:51] young men and women there a lot not like
[1:28:53] it is today
[1:28:54] because they're getting less and less
[1:28:56] and less in the church
[1:28:58] amen i've had individuals in certain
[1:29:00] churches say oh my
[1:29:01] there's a pastor you know in
[1:29:04] denominational churches
[1:29:05] oh my she said i used to teach sunday
[1:29:08] school she said because there were so
[1:29:09] many children
[1:29:10] there and young people there but now she
[1:29:11] said there's hardly anyone there
[1:29:14] to teach for a sunday school so she's
[1:29:16] that that that's gone
[1:29:18] and they agree with me regarding
[1:29:20] regarding the
[1:29:21] what the prophecy says but concerning
[1:29:23] the last days
[1:29:24] amen and brothers but they don't
[1:29:27] recognize the word
[1:29:29] they're not not aware of what god is
[1:29:31] doing amen
[1:29:33] to inspire us but like i said back when
[1:29:35] i was in that church and those young
[1:29:36] people like
[1:29:37] we were teenagers oh why i remember one
[1:29:39] time we went down into the basement
[1:29:41] of course and they had sunday school
[1:29:43] rooms there but they also had a at
[1:29:45] another chapel down there a big one
[1:29:47] upstairs but a smaller one downstairs
[1:29:49] and oh i can see the myself and the
[1:29:52] young people
[1:29:53] and with their hands up in the air and
[1:29:55] we walked around
[1:29:56] and around and around and around the
[1:29:59] chapel
[1:29:59] and praising the lord and worshiping god
[1:30:02] oh i pray god bless those young people
[1:30:04] wherever they are
[1:30:05] amen now that they'll be my age now for
[1:30:07] sure
[1:30:08] and maybe some of them a little bit
[1:30:09] older amen amen
[1:30:12] but brother the bride is going around
[1:30:13] and around and around in the word
[1:30:15] thanking god for the word
[1:30:16] and we're getting more and more to the
[1:30:18] greater revelation of the resurrection
[1:30:20] the greater revelation of the rapture
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:23] we ought to becoming more and more
[1:30:25] conscious of what god's doing
[1:30:27] brother we ought to feel the awkward
[1:30:29] pull amen
[1:30:32] brother if god god has ordained his
[1:30:34] predestination he's created a
[1:30:36] hunger and a thirst it's a pull there's
[1:30:39] there's a seed of god down there and
[1:30:41] they're hungry for this
[1:30:42] amen pull them up amen pull them up
[1:30:46] so he sends the messenger he sends a
[1:30:49] prophet and he what he reveals the
[1:30:50] mystery of his word
[1:30:52] to give us the faith to go up amen
[1:30:55] it's not to run the ear and do this and
[1:30:56] start this church in that church no
[1:30:58] it's a focus to people on the end
[1:31:02] focus the people on the resurrection
[1:31:04] focuses on the rapture
[1:31:06] and there's so few that are really
[1:31:08] putting their emphasis on resurrection
[1:31:10] rapture amen
[1:31:12] god help us brother please in the name
[1:31:15] of jesus
[1:31:16] so that you'll never forget what god's
[1:31:18] doing
[1:31:20] amen to god be the glory
[1:31:24] amen sorry there's going to be a
[1:31:25] business part of the meeting
[1:31:27] so uh i'll try
[1:31:30] not to be too long because we want to
[1:31:32] want to understand that there
[1:31:34] are deacons they want the word to go
[1:31:36] forth
[1:31:37] and then they want a song service and
[1:31:39] then the song leader returned them
[1:31:41] turns over to the the business part our
[1:31:43] brother paul
[1:31:44] amen so the grace of god amen
[1:31:48] still i won't get into the messages and
[1:31:50] all the quotes that i want to share with
[1:31:52] you
[1:31:53] but just let me leave you with this
[1:31:56] this understanding as brother brown
[1:31:59] preached three kinds of believers what
[1:32:00] for
[1:32:02] he said i'm i'm ministering this i'm
[1:32:04] preaching this amen
[1:32:06] he says so that it'll challenge you he
[1:32:09] said to decide what you are
[1:32:11] so are you a believer are you a
[1:32:12] make-believer or an unbeliever
[1:32:15] and as always he said three kinds of
[1:32:16] believers in every church
[1:32:18] amen so i'm preaching on spiritual
[1:32:20] religious amen to challenge your faith
[1:32:23] do you have a spiritual faith or
[1:32:24] religious faith
[1:32:26] there's quite a difference amen but
[1:32:29] eternal life is only in the spiritual
[1:32:31] faith
[1:32:32] god help us so in chapter 3 again
[1:32:36] of first corinthians and he said i
[1:32:38] brethren could not speak
[1:32:40] unto you as unto spiritual but as unto
[1:32:43] carnal
[1:32:45] even as unto babes in christ
[1:32:51] so can god minister to us because we're
[1:32:53] spiritual
[1:32:55] we're mature and we're not immature
[1:32:59] just babes no no you got to grow up
[1:33:02] paul said listen he said i fit you with
[1:33:04] milk milk milk milk
[1:33:06] and broth this is the hour he's when you
[1:33:08] should be old enough now to take the
[1:33:09] meat
[1:33:10] of the word and they and they weren't he
[1:33:13] was still delaying
[1:33:15] what he was doing amen he fed them milk
[1:33:18] he said i have fed you with milk and not
[1:33:21] with meat
[1:33:23] for either two ye were not able to bear
[1:33:25] it
[1:33:26] amen i tell you it takes takes the
[1:33:28] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:33:30] to enable you to bear the meat of the
[1:33:33] word
[1:33:35] there's too many preaching milk milk
[1:33:37] milk milk oh that's good that's good
[1:33:38] that's good
[1:33:40] yeah but if you're going to preach the
[1:33:41] meat of the word it challenges your
[1:33:43] faith
[1:33:45] amen believe us thou this
[1:33:48] amen as jesus was talking to martha
[1:33:51] concerning the
[1:33:52] largest rising from the dead he said he
[1:33:53] was going to he said he'll rise again
[1:33:56] oh yeah a lot of people believe like
[1:33:59] martha
[1:34:00] oh yeah he'll rise in the resurrection
[1:34:02] in the future no he said i am the
[1:34:03] resurrection
[1:34:05] so the resurrection is going on now and
[1:34:08] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:34:09] resurrection and the rapture in you
[1:34:12] that's right and you read ephesians 2
[1:34:14] again and you'll see it
[1:34:15] the first few verses we've been
[1:34:18] resurrected
[1:34:18] and on down to this sixth or seventh
[1:34:21] verse we've been raptured
[1:34:23] into heavenly places in christ amen
[1:34:26] but are we experiencing what the prophet
[1:34:29] promised
[1:34:30] would happen in christ is he revealing
[1:34:33] his word to you and me
[1:34:34] and increasing my faith increasing your
[1:34:37] faith and giving us more and more
[1:34:38] victory over the devil
[1:34:41] amen i tell you probably god said
[1:34:44] he said listen he said he said the
[1:34:47] devils
[1:34:48] and every all the devils he's in all the
[1:34:50] demons in hell
[1:34:51] he said are religious
[1:34:54] oh yeah he said they believed god
[1:34:59] but they're not spiritual they're
[1:35:00] religious amen
[1:35:02] that's why he come down in the garden of
[1:35:04] eden yea had god
[1:35:06] said amen oh yeah
[1:35:10] this this and this but i say
[1:35:14] and he and he gave her back well
[1:35:17] 99 the scripture yeah
[1:35:20] as i said the devil working through the
[1:35:23] serpent in the wilderness there
[1:35:25] and the serpent was the first evangelist
[1:35:28] yeah because he he went out looking at
[1:35:31] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:35:33] amen and brother and the serpent came
[1:35:35] and
[1:35:36] said and said what is under the
[1:35:37] anointing of the devil
[1:35:39] amen religious but not spiritual
[1:35:42] amen giving the preeminence to man
[1:35:46] but not god grace to us and that brother
[1:35:49] again we know where scientists say that
[1:35:52] this is how
[1:35:52] this is how everything started you know
[1:35:54] back there yeah
[1:35:56] no but the serpent when when god came
[1:36:00] and judged him he cursed the serpent
[1:36:03] yeah oh yes brother
[1:36:06] he was an up he was an uplight creature
[1:36:08] like a man
[1:36:10] yeah he was but god said now he said
[1:36:13] on your belt on your belly should you go
[1:36:15] in the dust
[1:36:16] he wasn't doing it before the judgment
[1:36:18] but after the judgment
[1:36:20] and they they have recognized too that
[1:36:22] in in certain certain
[1:36:24] serpents there that they have they have
[1:36:26] spots on on the on their bodies
[1:36:29] up here down here and they said wonder
[1:36:32] where'd they get those spots
[1:36:35] under finally someone came and told us
[1:36:37] yes that's where he said he was a
[1:36:38] serpent
[1:36:39] an upright creature like a man and he
[1:36:41] had arms and he had legs
[1:36:43] but god took it off and he became just
[1:36:45] like a serpent
[1:36:46] in the dust of the earth amen
[1:36:50] oh my thank god see that's what happened
[1:36:53] there
[1:36:54] and that's why jesus was virgin born
[1:36:57] none of us were virgin born physically
[1:37:00] amen no not by any means we were
[1:37:04] born in sin yeah the original sin
[1:37:09] amen jesus was without sin
[1:37:12] and it was the virgin birth amen
[1:37:15] so i pray god of god by grace help us
[1:37:18] keep our balance in the word amen thank
[1:37:22] god
[1:37:23] for what he did thank god for what he's
[1:37:25] doing
[1:37:26] amen to god be the glory
[1:37:31] again verse chapter 3 and verse 1
[1:37:34] or verse yet one and i brethren could
[1:37:37] not speak unto you as unto spiritual
[1:37:40] but as unto colonel and brother brahm
[1:37:43] did highlight it
[1:37:44] in in some quote that this kernel was
[1:37:46] religion
[1:37:47] religious he said
[1:37:51] even as under babes in christ i trust
[1:37:54] we're not a baby in christ anymore
[1:37:56] we're maturing beyond that amen
[1:38:01] i have fed you with milk and not with
[1:38:04] meat
[1:38:06] for other two we were not able to bear
[1:38:08] it neither yet
[1:38:09] now are ye able i believe that you're
[1:38:12] able to bear the meat of the word
[1:38:15] now that's why we're still here because
[1:38:18] we're going and feeding feeding feeding
[1:38:20] on the meat of the word
[1:38:21] amen so grace to us to keep feeding on
[1:38:24] the word
[1:38:25] on the meat amen
[1:38:30] so he said i fed you with milk and not
[1:38:32] with meat and it
[1:38:33] for other two ye were not able to bear
[1:38:36] it
[1:38:37] neither yet are ye able i trust we are
[1:38:40] able to take whatever
[1:38:41] word that god's going to preach that
[1:38:44] you're
[1:38:44] able to take it but please don't let it
[1:38:47] just fly over you
[1:38:49] take it judge yourself by the word

[1:44:12] grace to us amen
[1:44:17] see first corinthians 10
[1:44:21] and verse 1 moreover brethren i would
[1:44:24] not that ye should be ignorant
[1:44:26] now that all our fathers were under the
[1:44:29] cloud
[1:44:30] and all pass through the sea and were
[1:44:33] all baptized unto moses
[1:44:35] in the cloud and in the sea and it all
[1:44:39] eat the same spiritual meat
[1:44:44] but they were destroyed
[1:44:52] and it all drink the same spiritual
[1:44:55] drink
[1:44:55] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:44:58] that followed them
[1:44:59] and that rock was christ but it didn't
[1:45:02] save
[1:45:03] them it met their needs
[1:45:07] what they were focusing on amen but
[1:45:10] joshua and cadet was focusing on
[1:45:11] something
[1:45:12] greater and as i was thinking as the
[1:45:16] lord
[1:45:17] is our attitude and our spirit and our
[1:45:19] actions and reactions
[1:45:21] i said as zealous as joshua and caleb to
[1:45:23] go into the promised land they want to
[1:45:25] go in go in go in go in
[1:45:26] and now that as i said that the jews
[1:45:29] that were there listening to them they
[1:45:31] picked up stones they were going to
[1:45:33] stone
[1:45:34] what yeah because all they were
[1:45:37] emphasizing was giddy and giddy and god
[1:45:39] said god said god said
[1:45:40] and if god be with us he said who can be
[1:45:42] against us
[1:45:44] yeah they had that so we do we had the
[1:45:46] same zeal
[1:45:47] same enthusiasm that they for to go into
[1:45:50] the rapture as they had to go into the
[1:45:52] promised land
[1:45:53] we're going to take our state we're
[1:45:54] going to stay with it amen
[1:45:56] we're going to keep believing it we're
[1:45:58] going to keep keep claiming it
[1:46:00] by the grace of god amen
[1:46:04] and it says with many of them god was
[1:46:06] not
[1:46:07] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:46:09] the wilderness
[1:46:11] amen now these things were our examples
[1:46:14] to the intent we should not lust after
[1:46:17] evil things
[1:46:18] as they also lusted god help us
[1:46:22] no and there's many believers lusting
[1:46:25] after the things of the world out there
[1:46:28] not necessarily sinful things but things
[1:46:30] that appeal to their flesh
[1:46:32] oh makes me feel good i like that i like
[1:46:34] that
[1:46:35] yeah this too shall pass away
[1:46:40] amen as i have
[1:46:43] even almost every day when i'm doing
[1:46:46] this i'm doing that i see this and i see
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:48] i said lord the promise is to destroy it
[1:46:50] all
[1:46:52] help me not to put no great emphasis on
[1:46:53] this no great emphasis on that
[1:46:55] let me just lay it all aside and move on
[1:46:58] with you
[1:46:59] into resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:47:02] grace
[1:47:04] amen

[1:52:57] amen but let every man prove his own
[1:53:00] work
[1:53:00] and then shall he have rejoicing in
[1:53:02] himself alone

[1:53:10] amen grace to us
[1:53:14] grace and go with me to first peter
[1:53:17] chapter two
[1:53:20] and i'll share with you a couple of
[1:53:22] quotes and
[1:53:25] let's turn to our brother bob
[1:53:29] first peter 2 and verse 1.
[1:53:35] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:53:40] all guile
[1:53:43] and hypocrisies and envies
[1:53:47] and all evil speaking
[1:53:51] be careful lay aside i pray you've got
[1:53:54] the revelation of it that god
[1:53:56] that god wants you to have amen
[1:53:59] don't because sometimes we take things
[1:54:01] and and oh yeah well this is this big so
[1:54:04] they're going to
[1:54:04] take their stand against it and condemn
[1:54:06] this one condemn that one no no
[1:54:09] how big is it in the eyes of god
[1:54:13] sometimes it's bigger in our eyes than
[1:54:14] it is the eyes of god
[1:54:17] amen
[1:54:20] so lay aside all malice and
[1:54:24] all guile and hypocrisies
[1:54:27] and envies and all evil
[1:54:31] speakings not some but all
[1:54:34] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:54:38] of the word
[1:54:39] that ye may grow thereby and if so be ye
[1:54:43] have tasted
[1:54:44] that the lord is gracious amen we need
[1:54:48] to humble ourselves considering
[1:54:51] what he did for us
[1:54:57] but still there's too many it's just
[1:54:59] religion
[1:55:01] thank you lord i accept it and move on
[1:55:03] no it's like in a in a service one time
[1:55:07] of the prophet and there was this woman
[1:55:10] there she stood up
[1:55:12] and she was praising the lord and she
[1:55:15] was in the congregation there
[1:55:16] and she was crying and crying and crying
[1:55:20] and thanking the lord for redemption and
[1:55:22] there was a gentleman there who had
[1:55:24] attended the services and so on just
[1:55:27] having a religious spirit like and he
[1:55:30] saw her two or three services
[1:55:33] in a row doing that and
[1:55:36] he went to the altar and they thought he
[1:55:39] wanted prayer he said i want what she
[1:55:42] got
[1:55:44] why because he saw that re that that
[1:55:47] spiritual
[1:55:49] attitude of repentance even though she
[1:55:52] was a christian
[1:55:53] but she wanted thank god thank you jesus
[1:55:56] for what you'd done for me
[1:55:58] and he said i want what she had yeah
[1:56:02] they said and they prayed for him and
[1:56:04] god blessed him and god anointed him
[1:56:05] amen and he come forth with the same
[1:56:07] attitude that she had
[1:56:10] amen same experience she had thank you
[1:56:12] jesus she said you know
[1:56:13] people don't consider how great
[1:56:15] redemption is
[1:56:17] amen don't consider what jesus really
[1:56:20] did and now he suffered
[1:56:22] for you are you willing to suffer for
[1:56:25] him
[1:56:27] grace amen
[1:56:31] and it says in verse 3 if so be ye have
[1:56:34] tasted that the lord is gracious
[1:56:38] to whom coming as onto a living stone
[1:56:42] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:56:44] god
[1:56:45] and precious hallelujah
[1:56:49] ye also as lively stones are built up a
[1:56:52] spiritual house
[1:56:54] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:56:57] sacrifices acceptable to god
[1:57:00] by jesus christ not religious
[1:57:03] but spiritual amen
[1:57:07] as lively stones
[1:57:10] built up a spiritual house not your
[1:57:14] physical or one you're living in at a
[1:57:17] certain street

[1:57:24] house you're spiritual

[1:57:28] fellowship with you
[1:57:29] they know you're not carnal like the
[1:57:32] world
[1:57:33] you're spiritual amen
[1:57:36] so he said a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:57:39] spiritual sacrifices
[1:57:42] acceptable to god by jesus christ

[1:58:06] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:58:10] amen acceptable to god by
[1:58:14] jesus christ amen

[1:58:21] contained in the scripture

[1:58:26] elect precious and he that believeth on
[1:58:29] him

[1:58:39] and what he's doing for you amen the
[1:58:43] devil is there to destroy you and
[1:58:45] get rid of you jesus is there to keep
[1:58:47] you
[1:58:48] amen brother what would satan do
[1:58:51] if jesus wasn't there to defend us
[1:58:57] jesus is going to do that yes he's doing
[1:58:59] that i was like i prayed and i said oh
[1:59:01] lord please
[1:59:02] i know there's maybe millions around the
[1:59:03] world that are calling on you
[1:59:05] for help so i said lord excuse me
[1:59:10] i said your grace and your will be done
[1:59:14] amen
[1:59:16] just a couple of quotes and i might have
[1:59:18] shared that with with
[1:59:20] them with you before
[1:59:24] in 1956 he said there was lot
[1:59:28] going along just as religious as he
[1:59:31] could be
[1:59:32] and lot was very religious
[1:59:36] why it even began way back when cain and
[1:59:38] abel
[1:59:40] he said cain a modern man came to the
[1:59:43] church
[1:59:44] and the altar amen came built a church
[1:59:48] what am i trying to say to you i'm
[1:59:49] trying to tell you friend that just
[1:59:51] going to church and making a confession
[1:59:54] and doing good works will never
[1:59:56] save you you've got to be born again
[2:00:01] amen it has to come
[2:00:04] as a spiritual revelation not
[2:00:08] intellectual spiritual
[2:00:10] look at cain if you could just look at
[2:00:13] those two boys
[2:00:15] cain and abel we'll have
[2:00:18] we'll leave the text right here and go
[2:00:20] back for a minute
[2:00:23] he said look at cain look at abel
[2:00:26] one was religious and the other
[2:00:28] spiritual
[2:00:31] and oh he said may i stop here just a
[2:00:33] moment
[2:00:34] to say that i believe that these nations
[2:00:36] are getting their last
[2:00:38] mercy call he preached this in
[2:00:42] canada in edmonton
[2:00:45] alberta amen
[2:00:48] and i believe it i'm on record and i'm
[2:00:50] on tape
[2:00:51] saying it but i believe it with my heart
[2:00:54] that there's not a person on earth
[2:00:56] who could ever shake this thing back to
[2:00:59] its conditions again
[2:01:01] he said it'll take the move of god the
[2:01:03] second coming of jesus christ
[2:01:05] and he's a look at the differences in
[2:01:06] the people today
[2:01:08] look at how unconcerned they are they're
[2:01:10] eating they're drinking they're marrying
[2:01:12] their given in marriage
[2:01:14] just as it was predicted having a form
[2:01:17] of godliness
[2:01:18] and denying the power thereof amen
[2:01:22] and the bible said from such turn away
[2:01:25] he said very religious and they're
[2:01:28] always
[2:01:28] been very religious but not having
[2:01:31] spiritual insight
[2:01:32] to understand and he said that's the
[2:01:35] main
[2:01:36] thing he said that's the thing that
[2:01:38] designates your eternal destination
[2:01:41] is your spiritual conception
[2:01:45] because a lot of people are religious
[2:01:46] but not spiritual
[2:01:48] so are you spiritual amen
[2:01:56] spiritual he said that's the main thing
[2:02:00] he said that's the thing that designates
[2:02:02] your eternal destination
[2:02:04] your spiritual conception but now he
[2:02:07] said cain
[2:02:08] worshipped all of his carnal works
[2:02:11] just like the carnal church today and
[2:02:14] they go to church they worship
[2:02:15] and cain worship he wasn't an infidel he
[2:02:18] wasn't a communist
[2:02:20] he said cain was a believer he went to
[2:02:22] god you only talked to god
[2:02:25] god talked to him but he was just
[2:02:28] religious he wasn't spiritual
[2:02:31] amen oh yeah he had a beautiful as i i
[2:02:34] preached
[2:02:34] that years ago on empire avenue that i
[2:02:37] said which church would you go to
[2:02:39] i explained what abel's church was like
[2:02:42] and i said here he had a dead lamb
[2:02:44] blood all over the place and he got
[2:02:46] blood on himself
[2:02:49] i said would you want to go to that
[2:02:50] church or would you prefer cain's church
[2:02:55] oh oh he had a beautiful altar there and
[2:02:58] it's like thanksgiving days to
[2:03:00] now in in the denominational church
[2:03:02] world all they they put this here and
[2:03:04] they put that there it's all beautiful
[2:03:06] and and and kane had all these the
[2:03:09] things that he grew the crops and

[2:03:28] to
[2:03:29] and thank god we had a visitor at that
[2:03:32] time
[2:03:33] he was never in that church before
[2:03:37] but he came in just to see what we were
[2:03:39] like
[2:03:40] and after that service he said pastor
[2:03:44] he said thank you he said i never heard
[2:03:46] that before
[2:03:47] but he said you're right he said thank

[2:05:28] the prophet god has highlighted it it's
[2:05:31] like that

[2:05:36] for slavery in the united states
[2:05:40] and there was a man came to that farm
[2:05:44] and he was looking at certain ones there
[2:05:45] and he said he wanted to buy this slave
[2:05:48] that slave that's life
[2:05:49] always he said i want i want to buy that
[2:05:51] one
[2:05:53] why because he saw that one working as
[2:05:55] no other one worked
[2:05:57] he was right into it amazing
[2:06:01] and he said but can i have that
[2:06:03] knowledge that he's not for sale
[2:06:05] he said well look he's doing he's doing

[2:06:22] owner
[2:06:23] and he said until he said i learned
[2:06:27] that back in africa his father was the
[2:06:30] king
[2:06:31] of the tribe and he said he conducted
[2:06:34] himself as a son of a king there
[2:06:36] and he said right here he's still
[2:06:37] conducting himself as the son
[2:06:39] of a king and that's why he said his
[2:06:42] heart
[2:06:43] is right into whatever he wants what we
[2:06:46] want to do
[2:06:48] he will not hesitate he will not slow

[2:07:01] he said yes he said that
[2:07:02] as he conducted himself he says so we

[2:07:31] because there is jehovah god and there
[2:07:33] is his sons and his daughters
[2:07:35] and they are gods
[2:07:38] no wonder that the bible says they'll he
[2:07:41] said i'm going to sit you here
[2:07:42] sit you in this throne and do this and
[2:07:44] do this and he said they'll come
[2:07:46] and bow at your feet
[2:07:50] recognizing that you're a god
[2:07:53] amen you're the son of the living god
[2:07:56] you're the daughter of the living god

[2:08:09] judas
[2:08:12] like i said there's not much negative in
[2:08:14] the bible about judas
[2:08:16] just just where you deceive and betrayed
[2:08:20] christ
[2:08:22] and he must have been very good because
[2:08:24] like i said none of the disciples
[2:08:26] knew jesus said this one of you shall
[2:08:28] betray me they said
[2:08:29] me this one this one they never said oh
[2:08:33] it must be judas no
[2:08:36] he must have been he must have seemed to
[2:08:37] them to be spiritual he was religious
[2:08:39] but not spiritual
[2:08:41] amen so i pray the grace of god
[2:08:45] keep your attitude right keep your
[2:08:47] spirit right
[2:08:49] amen so we want to be jesus not judas
[2:08:55] and remember to betray your brother or
[2:08:57] sister
[2:08:58] in the lord you betray jesus
[2:09:01] be careful amen
[2:09:06] so are you a wise virgin or a foolish
[2:09:09] virgin
[2:09:11] amen again as i preached on it
[2:09:16] and uh some of the ministering brothers
[2:09:19] never heard it before they they
[2:09:21] they were shocked what i said yeah i
[2:09:24] says people going to hell i said
[2:09:26] not because of what they did but because
[2:09:29] of what they didn't do
[2:09:32] what i said jesus said and as much you
[2:09:35] didn't do it onto these the least of my
[2:09:37] brethren you didn't do it unto me
[2:09:40] so i said be careful you might be judged
[2:09:42] for what you didn't do
[2:09:44] not what you did oh i didn't do this i
[2:09:48] didn't do that
[2:09:49] well be careful what does god want
[2:09:53] there's lots of things god require that
[2:09:55] there's a lot of believers don't do it
[2:09:59] and because you didn't do it you're
[2:10:01] condemned
[2:10:03] god help us amen
[2:10:06] well he said and as much you didn't do
[2:10:08] it to me to them
[2:10:10] he said you didn't do it to me you want
[2:10:11] to do something for jesus oh
[2:10:13] well there's one of his children there
[2:10:15] you do for him
[2:10:18] yeah no
[2:10:21] oh yes that'll condemn us one day
[2:10:27] so make sure you're going to do all god
[2:10:28] wants you to do
[2:10:30] amen you're going to be controlled by
[2:10:31] god controlled by the holy ghost
[2:10:34] so that it's not what you didn't do
[2:10:37] that you're going to do it and jesus
[2:10:40] told him to depart into everlasting
[2:10:42] fire they were gone amen
[2:10:46] and as i said a brother must have heard
[2:10:48] about it because he called me on the
[2:10:50] phone he said brother
[2:10:51] he said this is absolutely amazing he
[2:10:53] said i'm going to preach on that
[2:10:55] i said good i said here's the scripture
[2:10:57] you need
[2:10:58] oh he said good he said thank you amen
[2:11:02] brother so are we wise virgins are
[2:11:04] foolish
[2:11:07] and yet you're still a virgin
[2:11:11] probably god said now remember there's
[2:11:12] still virgins
[2:11:14] but he said one is wise and that was
[2:11:16] foolish
[2:11:17] because the foolish got caught up with
[2:11:18] the natural things where's the
[2:11:20] where's the the wise got caught up with
[2:11:23] spiritual
[2:11:25] amen so are you sheep
[2:11:28] or goats are you a believer
[2:11:31] or a make-believer god have mercy
[2:11:35] amen so brother
[2:11:39] cain was very religious and he said the
[2:11:42] churches are very religious
[2:11:44] and they've always been but not having
[2:11:47] the spiritual insight to understand
[2:11:49] he said that that's the things that
[2:11:50] designate your eternal
[2:11:52] destination is your spiritual conception
[2:11:56] amen that determines your eternal
[2:11:59] destination
[2:12:02] it's the revelations that god has given
[2:12:04] you
[2:12:06] but now he's a cain worshiped
[2:12:09] all of his carnal works he said just
[2:12:12] like a carnal church today
[2:12:14] they go to church they worship cain
[2:12:17] worship he wasn't an infidel
[2:12:19] he wasn't a communist cain was a
[2:12:21] believer he went to god he built an
[2:12:23] altar
[2:12:23] and he done every religious thing that
[2:12:25] abel done but he didn't have the
[2:12:27] spiritual revelation
[2:12:29] of the will of god blessed be the name
[2:12:32] of the lord
[2:12:33] there you are do you see he said he
[2:12:36] didn't have the spiritual revelation
[2:12:38] that's what's the matter with the church
[2:12:39] today
[2:12:40] they don't have spiritual revelation
[2:12:43] and jesus said he built his church on
[2:12:47] spiritual revelation he said you get it
[2:12:50] oh my your eyes come open now
[2:12:53] he said the spiritual revelation cain
[2:12:56] come he built an altar
[2:12:57] he worshiped he brought sacrifice he
[2:13:00] knelt down
[2:13:00] he praised god he worshiped god he done
[2:13:03] everything religious that abel done
[2:13:06] and god flatly refused him because he
[2:13:08] didn't have
[2:13:09] the spiritual revelation of the
[2:13:12] sacrifice god
[2:13:14] god wanted abel did
[2:13:18] amen not just to please god abel knew
[2:13:22] that
[2:13:23] amen abel wanted a sacrifice to cover
[2:13:26] his sin
[2:13:28] amen
[2:13:32] now cain is on his line and there were
[2:13:35] everyone very religious
[2:13:37] very famous people they were scientists
[2:13:39] doctors and builders and workers
[2:13:41] smart men but all that lineage was
[2:13:43] rejected from
[2:13:44] cain all the way down and on abel's side
[2:13:48] they wasn't builders not educators
[2:13:52] not smart men they were a more or less
[2:13:54] humble
[2:13:55] sort of sheep razors and peasants
[2:13:59] that just walked by the spirit
[2:14:02] amen the bible said there's no
[2:14:05] condemnation to them that are in christ
[2:14:06] jesus
[2:14:07] that walk not after the flesh but after
[2:14:10] the spirit
[2:14:11] the spiritual man has a spiritual soul
[2:14:14] that can never die and the carnal man
[2:14:17] has a religious atmosphere all around
[2:14:20] him
[2:14:20] and he wants to worship but his colonel
[2:14:27] believer and it's a kind that was
[2:14:29] rejected
[2:14:31] amen and he said that's the way it is
[2:14:34] today
[2:14:35] that men are satisfied in their
[2:14:36] condition and there is a way to of
[2:14:39] escape
[2:14:39] and that's the way it's through jesus
[2:14:42] our lord jesus christ
[2:14:44] amen and he said there you are he said
[2:14:47] the same tribe the same spirits
[2:14:49] and they were absolutely religious men
[2:14:52] very religious but they missed the
[2:14:54] covenant vow
[2:14:56] amen they missed the calling
[2:14:59] oh if they want to join a church they
[2:15:01] get the biggest city
[2:15:03] the best and well thought of in the city
[2:15:05] how far they missed the calling
[2:15:08] yeah the only way you will ever know
[2:15:10] jesus christ
[2:15:11] is by spiritual revelation amen
[2:15:16] not by theology not by how much you
[2:15:18] study the bible
[2:15:19] whether you be christian science
[2:15:21] methodist jehovah's witness
[2:15:22] or whatever you are no matter what you
[2:15:25] are
[2:15:26] you will never know it by the word it's
[2:15:28] the spirit of god that reveals him to
[2:15:30] you
[2:15:31] amen it's a spiritual revelation
[2:15:35] amen and the antichrist is
[2:15:39] a religious spirit amen and the people
[2:15:42] are going to get caught up with that
[2:15:43] religion
[2:15:47] in the great tribulation amen
[2:15:51] and he said 1959 he said how can you
[2:15:55] worship lest you know what you're
[2:15:57] worshiping
[2:15:59] amen how can you be spiritual unless
[2:16:02] you've got the holy spirit in you
[2:16:05] amen and if you've all tied up with a
[2:16:08] bunch of church creeds
[2:16:10] will make your act make you act like a
[2:16:13] church people
[2:16:14] and dignified in religious and things
[2:16:16] like that
[2:16:17] that's all good moral acts but brother
[2:16:20] you've got to be born again
[2:16:22] by the genuine holy ghost that only
[2:16:25] comes
[2:16:25] by the word of god amen and true word of
[2:16:29] god
[2:16:29] when it comes to you it'll manifest the
[2:16:31] truth for he the holy ghost
[2:16:34] when he'll come he'll testify of me
[2:16:36] you'll manifest truth
[2:16:38] he'll take the things that i have showed
[2:16:39] you amen
[2:16:42] to take the things i've said and we'll
[2:16:44] show them to you amen
[2:16:46] the holy ghost will they're spiritual
[2:16:50] not religious so brother let's make sure
[2:16:54] that
[2:16:54] satan is not going to get us under a
[2:16:56] religious spirit
[2:16:57] controlled by a religious spirit but
[2:17:00] pray the grace of god is there to keep
[2:17:01] us under a spiritual
[2:17:04] anointing a spiritual relationship with
[2:17:05] jesus a spiritual relationship with god
[2:17:09] so that you can confirm well the prophet
[2:17:12] said in three kinds of believers who are
[2:17:14] you
[2:17:14] are you a believer are you a
[2:17:16] make-believer
[2:17:17] or a non-believer amen so are you
[2:17:21] spiritual
[2:17:22] in your life and in your walk in your
[2:17:24] talk are you spiritual
[2:17:26] are you carnal or religious
[2:17:31] make sure you're spiritual to be make
[2:17:34] sure you're spiritual is to make sure
[2:17:36] that he's in control
[2:17:38] amen not the devil that jesus
[2:17:41] control you brother grace that we're not
[2:17:45] going to
[2:17:50] we're not going to come under what the
[2:17:51] prophet of god preached in 64.
[2:17:54] spiritual spiritual amnesia
[2:18:00] what spiritual amnesia
[2:18:04] is forgetfulness yeah someone that's
[2:18:07] controlled with a problem of amnesia
