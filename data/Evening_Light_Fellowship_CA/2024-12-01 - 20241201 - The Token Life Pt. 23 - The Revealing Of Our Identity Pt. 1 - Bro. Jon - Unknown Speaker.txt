that aren't Lord we pray your grace to them each one Heavenly Father Lord speak to us now we ask Lord we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you turn if you would the Book of Genesis easy scripture to find this morning first book first chapter amen God bless you each one good to see each one that's made it good to see brother Blair here all the way from BC he'll be driving back with brother Dale so we want to remember them that God would grant them traveling mercies amen it's always good to see a visitor not so good when they're taking away one of our own amen but we'll forgive him as long as he promises to come back and visit us again some other time amen as brother Bob mentioned I'll be headed out this afternoon to go to Central to go moose hunting so Lord willing I'll be there and come back Friday night if I get my animal quickly I may be back a bit early but regardless I'm hoping to get some time of fellowship with brother Hank sister Verna brother back if I get a day I'll I'll head out and see brother Doug and sister Beverly as well but we'll see uh how that goes it's all in the Lord's hands but in the meantime brother Mark will take the service on Wednesday night um so I'm trusting you'll be in prayer for that and you'll enjoy that amen I certainly enjoy it when I listen in and I'm able to my eye is almost 100% it's about 95% but I'm just wearing my glasses out of precaution this morning I don't want to aggravate anything before I head out to Central but I'm appreciative for God's healing there amen God bless you Genesis 1 very familiar scripture says this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning may God bless his word amen we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost amen and this is our 23rd service preaching on the token life and I want to take a couple of services excuse me this morning on this thought of the revealing of our identity amen and I preached like I said 23 services on the Holy Spirit and what it means to the believer today and you know some of those Services maybe you could take that and you could go hear a similar service in in just about any Pentecostal church or any Bible believing church and it's it's something that maybe the world is understood in the terms of the Christian world Amen but I believe we're preaching far more than just a generic message this morning I believe we've got a message that takes us into a fully open Word and so I want to take us into some of that depth this morning and over the coming Services amen and I believe there's more to this uh our understanding our reality of the Holy Spirit than we've ever had cuz the scriptures says if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies amen so we've got a Rapture and a resurrection by the Holy Spirit that's what it is it is our literal Rapture and Resurrection but until we go that means there's a change that's got to happen to bring us to a rapturing a Rapture Ready condition amen so I believe there's more of an understanding because with understanding comes the reality behind that understanding God opens his word so that we will believe for it we'll expect it for it we'll accept it and then it will come into our lives amen but I want to talk this morning about the plan of God and how God works and how God reveals himself in us and there's a plan that he's got and it's not a new plan amen we're not God isn't coming up with something he's not sitting down with a group of advisers adapting to the way the world's going and the situation and the circumstances around us but God set a plan and it was a plan way before time even began before the world really came into its current form amen but when it started moving at the beginning as we read here God set his plan in motion and that plan's been in works now for over 6,000 years and God's been letting it unfold and it's right on time amen we can look in the word and we can see that God's plan is right on time because we can turn especially as we look at the Book of Revelation and we can see we're exactly where we ought to be in sync with the church ages in sync with the the condition of the world and sync with the economies and sync with the religious world and we can see God's plan is coming to pass exactly as he ordained it amen and so we have a word that confirms that God knows what's going on he knew it before it happened and he's already made a plan that works through all of these different things but I want to take us back to our opening scripture this morning to talk about the revealing of our identity and the scripture says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth full stop this is not a semicolon it's not a colon It's a period full stop brother Brandon would say we don't know how long the Earth sat there in that condition it could have been one day it could have been an hour it could have been millions of years it could have been billions of years amen but when God created that Earth in that form it had everything that was needed to to sustain life everything was there but it was not yet under the conditions that would allow it to do it it wasn't in a mature condition he created the Earth as a seed itself amen but everything was just inside of it but it wasn't the way it was meant to be it wasn't in its fully mature condition amen the seeds were buried in the dirt but there was no plants yet everything was covered by water there was no light in the heavens but yet everything that was going to be needed to sustain life was in the Earth right there and then the scripture says in two and this is just the first half of the Scripture it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep now if we look at a creation like this and we know it's intent our our our human nature is that we would go and we'd start pulling levers quickly to get this earth into its intended condition when we see things the way they ought not to be when we see hardship when we see pain and suffering when we see things that are out of order our human nature wants to go and start setting things right we want to jump in there and we want to take it from where it is to where it ought to be to its intended purpose amen and looking at this Earth as humans and we if we could see through the eyes of God and see how great and wonderful and beautiful it was going to be our human nature would say let's get things going and we'd hire the contractors and we get the Earth moving equipment and we we get all of the the climatologist to come in and let's get this thing working the way that it was supposed to work amen but God doesn't do things our way God has a plan and time means nothing to God time is a human construct not a god con God a god concept if we were to put it that way but I want us to put on our spiritual Minds this morning because I'm not here to preach about the Earth I'm here to preach about you amen and so when we look at conditions when we look at circumstances and we look at what's going on we've got to understand that God works differently than we do amen that when things aren't where they ought to be that doesn't mean they get to be the way they should be immediately because we recognize its intended purpose or plan God's got a way of doing things amen God is the master of circumstances God doesn't react to circumstances again that's a human thing we react to circumstances but because God knows all things God is the master of circumstances and therefore circumstances react to God rather than God reacting to circumstances amen God takes troubles and he puts bits in their mouth amen God is using everything that's happening it's all working for our good who are the called according to his purpose watch how brother Bram says this he says there was nothing but just a darkness of chaos and what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but we into the darkness Yonder without light or anything and the churning of the water and that wandering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a terrific mass of something lost like it was it couldn't find its way then he says these words he says and that's what we become when we become wandering Stars away from God just without hope without God he says just churning around out in darkness not knowing where we're going he says and God took that great chaos of Darkness Hallelujah and transformed it into a Garden of Eden see by his word he says that's how we are transformed by God's word when God said let there be light and that mass of creation out there come over in and around the Sun and begin to revolve around it and became a Garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God that's how it happened amen he says it did the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word of God now did the earth do that by choice does the Earth have a will no does the Earth have a mind no it did not do it by choice but rather under the hearing of the word of God there was a power behind that word and that word took authority over the darkness it took authority over the chaos and it brought it into subjection by the word of God Amen that's how it works amen it's a created object it has no will it has no power God took it under the control of the word of God he says now that's what we're here for that's my message and has been all along is the word of God we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place always stay with that word always check out your motives and objectives if it is according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone he says but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then you hold to that he says now God sometimes just like your little group here this morning he lets it not happen just overnight he says we're the one that gets in a hurry God is never in a hurry he says he just says it and it's going to be for when he says anything it's got to be it's just going to be he lets it take its time see God isn't worried time is nothing to him he's a creature he not a creature he is eternity he's outside of time amen but you look at Abraham and Sarah God comes down in Sovereign Grace and Mercy calls them out of Earth calls them out of an idolatrous people and he gives them a promise of a great nation a promise of a son and what does it do takes 25 years to happen to the point where they are completely in a place where they can't produ produce it and then all they get is the one son God says I'm going to make you a great nation then he gives him one Lord what are you doing I've given you enough and then that out of that one Isaac he goes and he marries Rebecca now he's supposed to be the one that really starts to spring up that's what God told and a and Isaac and Rebecca can't have children it's in chaos it's in darkness the promise of God seems of no effect and Isaac Liv literally has to go to God and pray for children before God gives him Jacob and Esau see God's not in a hurry look at Israel Israel has a promise for a land of their own and it takes almost 500 years for God to give it to them and in the meantime they're in darkness they're in chaos they're in slavery they're in all of these things 430 years under bondage and then another 40 years in the desert 470 years of hard times is God worried who's worried this morning this guy right time means nothing to God Amen when nothing's happening in our eyes it doesn't mean nothing's happening it just means we can't see it yet amen but there's something that's going on Amen because when God speaks his word brother Bram says it's done it has to happen it's going to be there's nothing that can stop these things but watch how things start to change as God comes down and and he sees that this world is in darkness amen because we're trying to see how he works with us I'm trying to show you this morning and we we won't finish it this morning by any means but I'm trying to show you how we're going to get into a Rapture and the resurrection I want to show you how the plan of God works because the Earth is in darkness it's in chaos that means it's out of order nothing's in its right place it's not working the systems of the Earth are broken amen the parts are all there but nothing's working it's like if you buy a thing of Lego if you just shake it up a little bit it doesn't turn itself into the picture that's on the box it needs somebody to come in and put the pieces together properly in the right order amen but the world is just dark it's cold it's out of order it's wet it's stormy nothing about it is appealing and certainly nothing there will sustain life but Watch What Happens now because it says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep but then something happened it says and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen when the spirit of God moves that's when things start to change anden it seems like nothing's happening and it's been maybe millions or billions of years but then the spirit of God moves and when the spirit of God moves things change that word move there it means to relax to brood to grow soft to hover this is literally the same word that they use for Mary when the the Holy Spirit overshadowed her when the Holy Spirit overshadowed her and produced life inside of her it was the brooding of the Holy Spirit over a Darkness over something that was without without greatness without deity that was that was out of its position and yet it comes down and what does the moving of the spirit do it starts to bring things in order so that life can come forth that's what the moving of the spirit of does Amen its purpose is to bring life amen the the presence of God and we felt it many times the presence of God is there to bring life it's there to bring things to their to the their proper position amen we'll see that life doesn't happen in winter nothing grows in winter why because it's cold it's windy it's snowy you have way less sunshine and you have shorter days of sunshine it's not conducive to life but in the spring as things start to change the atmosphere changes and what's the changing of the atmosphere do it starts to bring forth life but watch how this atmosphere works because so often we miss how God works in these things amen the atmosphere doesn't sit there and do nothing but rather than the spirit of God moves it brings a message amen it brings the very word of God there's times where we can feel the presence of God but we've got to say Lord what would you have for your servant cuz he doesn't just come yes he comes to comfort us yes he comes to reassure us but he comes with a word because that's where the power is to the believer is in the word and that's what the spirit's quickening inside each and every one of us he comes with something that we can rest on cuz the feeling's going to go amen you don't know if God is with you or or not with you by feeling I don't feel him every service I don't feel him every day as I'm walking around every hour that I'm awake but I know he's there because his word says I'll never leave you or forsake you he says I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age I know know he's there by his word that his Spirit brought when it came to me and when it comes to you that's my rest amen so no matter where we are when we come into the presence of God its purpose is to bring Life by the word amen God doesn't just come with his presence but he comes with his word that's why the evidence of the holy spirit is not signs and wonders it's not speaking in tongues it's not prophesying or any of these things because those things can be put into a vessel that is without form and void something that is out of order something that's in chaos when Paul came with his message that he got on the backside of the desert of Arabia what did he come and do he set things in order because what happened is people were coming to church to speak in tongues to prophesy to give a word of knowledge to to interpret and do all of these things and Paul was coming to say that is not going to work that's not going to produce life that's not the purpose of the spirit that's the effect of the spirit you're focused so much on the effect but you're missing the the purpose the purpose is to set things in order and that's what his message did it set them in order so they could what receive life rather than just receive the effects of the spirit amen that word put the atmosphere into order that word put the atmosphere into order so that atmosphere that God create caused created caused the word of God to be spoken and to come in reality so watch now verse three it says and God said let there be light pause and there was light remember in adoption brother bam would talk about speaking the word listen when God speaks it did not say it happened immediately it said God spoke and then it happened now that Gap may have been a millisecond or it might have been a thousand years we don't know we don't know what happened but when he spoke it was going to happen because his word words are spoken with power amen it says and then there was light not and then there was light pause and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now there's so much to unpack here and I'm not going to do it this morning because we preached on this but we saw that the first thing that God created was light and it was not the sun moon and stars that was the fourth day but the light that he created here was the pillar of fire a dwelling place for God to be in amen and that body had no darkness in it it had no shadow of turning as the scripture says it was pure light and it conquered all Darkness there was a clear separation between this light and everything else amen everything else is called Darkness there's light and then there's everything else and everything else is darkness and that Darkness could not conquer it Amen brother says this he says the world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the Earth nothing but complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden he says that is the transforming power of God now catch this that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it Hallelujah that's who we are this morning amen that God can take nothing and make something wonderful full out of it now notice he didn't add anything to it nor did he take anything away from it when he did this it was already there he just brought it to its predestinated condition according to his plan according to the great idea that he had in his mind amen it's nothing in that it's not in life it's not in order it's not the way it's supposed to be doesn't mean there's nothing there it's that it's not doing what it's supposed to be doing and it can't do it it self remember scripture says can a man by taking thought add a cubit of stature to himself he can't do it I can't think about being 7t tall and then become 7t tall the seed can't become come to life by thinking about it it takes an external Force amen but lot why did God create that light first because notice he created that Pillar of Fire but we see that that light is life itself amen see we think that the light of the sun is what matters most because that's what ains life here on Earth but that's not what God created first but rather God created something else first and I'm here to tell you this morning it's because you were Central in his mind when he was doing this creation amen I'm here to show you who you are this morning in a little way that you may not have seen before because when God created that first thing and that Pillar of Fire he did it with purpose and we've read the scripture so many times in this series but I'll read it again in John 1 he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not one thing made that was made and it says in him was life and the life was the light of men he says and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so we look at the Earth and botney life and animals and vegetation as those things are critical and they're they're beautiful but I want you to see something here amen that the first thing that God created was that which was critical to my life and your life not to their life the first thing that God created was what was necessary for you and I to live eternally rather than live on this Earth amen the first thing that he created was a body for himself that he could later divide and put into his sons and daughters so they could be with him no matter what condition this world was in the first thing he created was that which pertains to our eternal life not to this temporal life then and only then did he move on to setting things up for our natural existence amen God's greatest priority is for his family it's for his bride for his elect seed to be eternally with him and everything is secondary to him everything else the first thing is his family amen the first priority for God was to put himself in a form that could indwell you and I that's the very first thing he did Brother B says this he says the difference is just like it was in the beginning where there was gross Darkness upon the Earth are we in Gross Darkness now we are in Gross Darkness it's gross as in it's great and it's as in it there's a lot of it and it's gross and is in it's disgusting we're at it we're in every every way that gross could be gross he says when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness now catch this he says and I believe that we're now living in that hour again when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to this other side of the world that the light might be made manifest what's the purpose of the light of God to drive away Darkness to allow life to be where it wasn't before that's the purpose of it amen when life comes forth it proves what's in each seed because it brings out the source of the plant it brings out the intentions of the plant by causing it to grow listen you can't grow up a thorn and say I'm here to make people feel good that's not it you can see why the light that produces life in you that you're meant to cause harm that you're meant to protect that you're meant to be a barrier so that things won't go through and around you but at the beginning of Life when we look at everything that's in the ground and the seeds they might look very much the same and I looked up this picture on the internet and you look how a lot of those seeds especially that second column over those first four look pretty close they look look like they're almost the same thing even in seed form they look very similar but as you go from one side to the other you see that they go from bulbous and dark to lighter to skinnier to odd shapes and lumps and and prickly and all these different things and you say well I know what that is by the seed but not everything can be distinguished by the seed by most people an expert would know but you and I probably wouldn't be able to to understand but as these grow and they mature then the differences start to show and we start to understand hey that wasn't what I thought it was it's something different amen the longer they're alive the more we realize what each plant is what its purpose is whether it's good for us whether it's bad for us but in that first little while they all look very much the same when you see a little sprig of something come out of the ground you can't tell me most of us if that's a a thing of grass if it's a piece of corn that's going to be growing maybe it might even be wheat cuz it's just a little piece of green that comes out but then it turns into a bean plant and you're like oh well that's or a tomato plant or whatever and you start to understand as the leaves start to come out that gives you an idea but then as the fruit comes then you know for sure exactly what it is but it's interesting they found this plant in the Amazon and it's called Bia trifoliolata and it's in the Amazon and it mimics the plants that are around it so you probably can't see it so well here but the yellow the yellow arrows are pointing to this this Bia trifoliolata and if you'll notice it looks very similar to the plants around it and it can look completely different when it's next to one plant than it can to another and they don't know how it does this CU plants don't have Minds as far as we know they don't have a Consciousness but yet they can mimic very closely the plants that are around them so you look in the bottom leftand corner and you see that it's got a more Jagged appearance and then if you go look up uh even look to the one right next to it or the two next to it you'll see it's a much rounder appearance and sometimes it's really veiny some sometimes it's very rounded and flat and smooth in these different things and so it's changing its appearance based on what it's around we've got Believers like that you got talk to them one day and they're all all high up in the clouds and super spiritual and then you go talk to them and they're with this group and they're putting down this one they're putting down and what is it they're changing based on the people they are they are around but here's the thing the true plants that it's mimicking are that shape for a reason and it is there so they can grow so they can mature it's there to protect them from parasites and from insects and these different things and so The Showdown comes when a parasite comes or a disease comes and it can't touch the real plant but if it if an animal will ever bite through and realize that that one's a fake all of its appearances won't help it because it doesn't have what's required to save it from the thing that the other one is protected from you can't be what you're not can't be what you're not Church you can't put on listen we can put on the clothes we can say the right thing we can go to the right church we can do it the same as everything around us and everyone around us amen but until the spirit of God comes in and shows our true colors we don't know who and what we are but we can sit under that word and as we see ourselves changing it rather than changing ourselves see that's the key I can't change myself I can't do it I'm a seed but if I can let the light and the environment around me produce what's inside of me I'll see what's natural but I can't be putting things on Amen the spirit of God sends light and Life to us and it produces and it makes it abundantly clear whether we're the real deal or notam says this way he says and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the Earth and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed he says that was a great hour how does the seed bring joy and life there's no joy when you plant it it's work you can't see it you don't know what's going on but when do you have joy with a seed when it comes out and you say hey it's alive I didn't kill it I do have a green thumb I'm GNA have tomatoes you know brother brother kingsley's wife gave my wife a a pineapple plant I think she was fooled about the conditions of Newan land before she came here I think Kingsley had told her it's a tropical island I just think he forgot to tell her it's an Atlantic tropical island but she gave her a pineapple plant and if you go to our house now you'll see that it's got a little pineapple about this big but you know what that's as big as it's ever going to get cuz we don't have the climate here to produce it but it'll only go so far but you know what just seeing that little pineapple right there we can say technically we grew a pineapple in Newan land praise the Lord what is the joy the joy is when the seed comes to maturity right when it comes all the way and I remember brother Mark's old Greenhouse there and you go in there and there' be Tomatoes there and these different things and you go in you'd say this is wonderful if you like tomatoes right that was the joy that it came amen it brings Joy not just when it it comes out of the ground that's great and there's Beauty there and and these different things but when that seed is in maturity that's when it brings Joy because now its purpose is fully revealed and you can enjoy it if it's for food you can eat the food if it's for shade you can enjoy the shade if it's for beauty you can enjoy its beauty if it's for protection you can enjoy its protection that's where The Joy comes amen but as soon as those conditions are right you can start to have joy because you know that it's going to come forth it's going to produce itself amen but everything we see is in seed form the Earth itself was a a seed Earth if we wanted to call it that way amen and then within that Earth were other smaller seeds for for for the plants and botney life and these things but it took the personal presence and the atmosphere of God followed by the word of God to put everything in order so that God plan could become obvious the word itself is a seed Jesus said many times and we have to understand that because we're a seed a word seed bride and and we've got to understand the way that a seed works because the word seed is thought Allelujah then it's spoken and then it's planted and then it comes out under the the the presence of God Amen when God is speaking that word that's when he plants it it's planted and it can sit there for thousands of years before it comes out but it's planted and all it takes is the spirit to what bring it to life and then it comes out and it does it amen but when God thinks it and God speaks it everything that that seed needs is in itself all it needs is the right conditions you don't have to add anything if you want Tomatoes you go plant a tomato seed and everything to be a tomato plant is in that Tomato Seed even though it's just this little tiny thing why the word embeds it within itself and all it needs now is the right conditions the right atmosphere the right circumstances for it to come to life and we look at the end of creation and and we're not reading it this morning for the sake of time but at the end of this creative work God spoke and it happened God spoke and it happened and at the end of it it says that God saw that it was very good and he rested there's nothing bad in there everything that he had done was good amen he had spoken and when he had spoken he knew that it was going to come to pass and when it was finished he rested from all of those things because what the word had been spoken and he knew everything that was going to happen was going to happen but watch how God's word works very familiar scripture in Isaiah 55 he says behold Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and Nations that knew not thee shall run into thee because of the Lord thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for he ha glorified thee this is a prophecy concerning you and I this is a prophecy of a gentile bride he says Thou shalt call a nation that knowest the not listen the Jews knew him it was the Gentiles that didn't know him he says and they'll run to him why because of him I'm not running to God because of me I'm running there because of something he did because of who he is amen it happens because of God not because of you and I but watch now he drops down to verse 8 and says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts remember the scripture says God is not a man that he should lie do you know we lie all the time not out of intention but we say something and then it turns out to not be true because we didn't have all the facts we didn't have all the understanding the situation changed the circumstances have changed new new light has come and we'll say oh my my goodness I guess I can't do that we lied not out of intention we lied because we made a plan that we didn't carry through it's not something that we're doing that's bad in and of itself it's not a sin to do those things amen but but he says that he's not the same as we are and he says I am the Lord I change not and in that same scripture he says and that's why you're not consumed the reason that we are not consumed with all of our fault and failures and bad thoughts and and where we fall away and we fall short the reason we're not consumed is because of Isaiah 555 that he said I'm going to have a bride and she's going to come from a gentile nation and she's not going to know me but she's going to come to me because of the what I've done and because of what I said not because of what her what she's done so when we fall the reason we cannot be pushed away and consumed by him is because he has a word that overshadows us that says they've got to be there no matter what that's why amen we can say things and we can think things with the best of intentions amen I say here today I'm going out to hunt Moose guess what I could have a wreck halfway down and guess what I lied cuz I never make it to Hunty moose but I didn't lie with intent I lied with what an incomplete picture of what was going to happen amen we can put things in motion and then one little thing we can set the big the big biggest greatest plan and we can look at it from every angle and get all sorts of input and one little thing can derail it and we lied because we couldn't see the whole picture amen and in our sincerity with our best knowledge and understanding we say something or we plan something or we do something and then all of a sudden one thing happens and we stop God's saying I'm not like you I know the end from the beginning I know the start to the Finish amen I have all the information I need at the front and when I think it it's perfect and when I speak it it is absolute he doesn't change his mind he doesn't go back God is not caught out by surprise this what's happening today in this world around us is not taking God by surprise God's not having to react he's already seen it he's already accounted for it and he's using it to produce exactly what he said he would with a perfect spotless sinless Gentile bride amen sometimes we say things to try and pump up our tires sometimes we act real spiritual why because we're on a spiritual mountain and then what happens is we slide down into a valley of the shadow of death we slide down into another trial and all of a sudden we're like oh maybe I wasn't as great as I thought I was maybe I didn't know as much as I thought I knew what is it we're fooling ourselves cuz we're human and guess what I hate to tell you guys we're foolish we are foolish we are foolish foolish foolish we think so much of ourselves and in the grand scheme of things we know nothing we know nothing absolutely nothing amen but God isn't Like Us Praise the Lord God doesn't do chitchat God doesn't come down you ever notice when God comes down and talks to people he doesn't mess around he doesn't come down and say hey how you doing have you noticed the weather outside hey did you see that new car that haunted us coming no God comes down and all he does is he speaks exactly what he's thinking and it's absolute and it's perfect every time why cuz his words have power behind them you can't chitchat when you have the word because it's absolute it comes with power it comes with authority there's something that's behind it and it's the power of God that brings it to pass so you can't chitchat about just anything you can't have casual conversation because whatever you say casually is going to happen you know we've got to watch our words sometimes we can say something casually that brings something to pass because we let our tongue slip we ought not to do those things brother Braham says this he says God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he's not like you and I that we are especially myself that's the humility of a real prophet he says like you and especially me he says that speak so many foolish things God speaks every word with a meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve by his word and it will perform exactly what he said it will do do Watch What Happens now we're still in Isaiah 55 the intention of God's word being proven watch how God says things with purpose he says for as the rain cometh down and snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater God's pointing at the systems of the Earth he's pointing to the the rain systems the watering systems and they're all there to produce and sustain life amen there for our sake notice he says I'm giving it so it will give seed to the swer who's the swer you and I and bread to the eater who's the eater you and I everything in this earth is for our comfort and for our benefit to to sustain our life amen God created the world and set it in order for your sake and for my sake for our purposes but watch what he says in the Amplified so he says just as there's systems in this world that work to sustain life he he says so will my word be which goes out of my mouth and it will not return to me without result without accomplishing what I desire and without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it so God's saying as as the Earth has a system for producing boty life and sustaining it so is my word A system that produces and sustains eternal life amen it comes with purpose and its purpose is to bring to life the word seed that he planted in the beginning that's the purpose of it amen and it's a system of the word that'll keep going and keep going and keep going until life comes out of every seed amen everything that's going on in the great plan of God is to bring you and I into eternal life that's what it's trying to do the purpose of the holy spirit in the in our midst and in our lives is to bring us all into the realities of eternal life amen we can sit here today and we can worry and we can fret and we can stress and we can Wonder and we can struggle and we can fight and listen we know it's a fight life is a fight on this Earth because we're in sin amen and don't so don't give up I'm not telling you to stop fighting amen but what I want you to see is the rest behind this battle amen that we are struggling for life but the point the point of the struggle is to produce character not to make us worry not to make us fear not to make us Wonder not to make us fret but rather it's to show us that in that there is a word that's going on behind us and that is our rest that he says I'll take you through it if God can rest after a 7-Day Creation with 6,000 more years to go we ought to be able to rest for tomorrow amen why because he's got a word that takes us through bam says all this great thing that he knew would come to pass after he had spoken it he could take a rest everything under control his seed was his his word and his word is a seed Jesus said it was and everything would be all right because he had said for it to bring forth of its kind transforming only to its kind he says see his word had to be of its kind if he had said a palm tree he didn't mean a palm and an oak mixed together he meant a palm tree here and an oak tree there everything positionally in its place what's position mean be what you are he says oh if we could only learn that what part of the word we are we must take our place no matter what it is we can look at that line where he says we must take our place and we can put pressure on ourselves and we can say come on pull your boots up by your bootstraps let's get going let's get serious I'm not saying don't do that but I don't believe that's the pressure that brother Brandon was trying to put on us amen does a tree get stressed out trying to produce fruit does a palm tree stress out about being a palm tree I got to keep working to be a palm tree no what does a tree do it takes its god-given environment and it uses it to bring life that's it amen why because a tree is under a law that says you are what you are a tree doesn't have to worry am I going to switch tomorrow am I going to be a palm tree today and tomorrow be an oak tree and all of my hard work of being a palm tree lost no it always is a palm tree it always will be a palm tree and so all it has to do is do what every other tree does take in the water take in the nutrients and it'll be a palm tree it's under a law amen I believe what brother Bram saying here is that as this tree is under a law you are under a law that says you are a child of God and you can't be anything less than a child of God and when you are acting as a child of God when you are producing as a child of God when you are feeding as a child of God you are at your happiest and listen you can pretend you're not a child of God for a long time but you'll never be satisfied until you are what you are amen why because there's a word that declares your position your place your relationship to God and so that word cannot return to him without void so therefore we must take our place not by pressure but because there's a law of the word that says you are what you are amen that means that my flesh comes into subjection it means my mind comes into subjection it means my nature comes into sub rejection because there's a word law that's working behind all of this amen it's not by might not by power but it's by the spirit anointing the word of my life that this is going to happen amen it's the word of God producing what it says about you ream continues he says now he had all this in his mind and he said let there be now that's Genesis 1 see Let There be this let there be that let there be he was sowing seed Let It Be Here let it be here let it be here and he knew it was is going to be that way because it cannot change he says now that gives us Faith then what he said here notice that's Capital H what he said here it's going to be so let's let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the betting ground of that into our hearts and let us act out this place that he has placed Us in in the last days see let the seed fall in our hearts Lord and let Thy word fall in my heart let there not be any unbelief so what's our part our part is to do as a tree does feed appropriately listen feed on what the spirit has placed around you because God gives us an environment to produce life God gives us an atmosphere to produce life God gives us nutrients to produce life God gives us water to produce life so what does he do he brings his word the atmosphere of God brings the word of God we drink it in why because that's what believers do Believers eat the word of God remember Rel Revelation 108 John has to go and take the book and eat it that's what believers do we eat the book we take it in and it has an effect on us it has a tremendous work in our life because that's what feeds our souls it's the word of God Amen we can't help it go try and tell a tree stop drinking water and stop taking nutrients out of the out of the earth it won't do it cuz it's built to do it every system in place is built to feed on that so let me tell you this morning if you're feeding on something else and wondering why you're struggling it's because you're not feeding the way you were built to feed every time I slip and fall I can take it back to something I fed on that I shouldn't have fed on that's it that's it that's the only way you can come in is if you allow it in so if we're feeding inappropriately guess what we stunt our growth and we get Dr and we get into a what a drought condition and under a drought condition we get dry we get brittle we get hard we don't produce leaves and we definitely don't produce fruit but if we'll feed on what the atmosphere has produced around us we'll produce exactly what we're supposed to amen but I want you to see something here because we started in the beginning and when we read the story in Genesis 1 we only see a portion of the story but remember God rested his word had been spoken but not everything that he said was written in Genesis 1 that's why we have the other 65 books of the Bible is to open to us all the other things that he said and that he thought amen God literally spoke this word before the foundation of the world and so that word was there before you came into existence before I came into existence before we ever breathed the breath of life amen before we ever gave our hearts to the Lord before we ever heard the word before we ever had health before we ever had sickness before we ever did good before we ever did bad that word was already in action to bring us to eternal life amen it was already there it was already working amen the reason you and I are here today is because the word of God has been spoken and we're included in it that's the reason we're here today but look at what he talks about in Revelation 17 we're talking about our origin and the revealing of our identity he says the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is now that scripture is pointing to the unbelievers in the tribulation who will be fooled by the Antichrist system amen it's already here it's not in power yet not in full power yet but yet it's already here and they are fooled not because they aren't smart enough not because they aren't spiritual not because they aren't religious amen but far from it they are fooled because their names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life That's the separation between us and them is that their names were not written there ours were amen so if you read that correctly you'll understand that if their names were not written and that's what kept them from going into a resurrection or Rapture there must have been a people whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that they would not be fooled that they would receive the word and that they would go in a resurrection and a Rapture that's the word that's working over you and I amen there are names written that are being called out as we come into existence and it's the word now that starts to bring us back into Christ amen there are people whose names have always been on that book of life and they cannot be removed and they're written in that special chapter called the Lamb's Book of Life and those names can never be erased they can never be marked out they can never be blacked out nothing can take them out of the palms of his hand Jesus said now there are people who can and there are names that were never written in there in the first place the scripture says and that's a different study for a different time amen but before they're born the ones whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world before they were born they're already declared to be children of God and there's a word that's working to produce them and we see that amen we see it with Jacob and Esau where God said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated the scripture says having done neither right nor wrong but that the election of God might stand Jacob had done nothing wrong nothing right and Esau had done nothing wrong and before they're born God says I hate Esau and I love Jacob why because Jacob's name was in the Lamb's Book of Life and Esau's wasn't that simple that simple amen so before they made a choice for against the word before Esau gave up his inheritance before he went against the the teachings of of what God had given his father and his grandfather and his great-grandfather before anybody gets baptized before they do any of these things there's a different law that's working and it's the law of eternal life that's the overarching law above all of these things amen it's the word that's been given over the children of God Amen but Paul would tell us that we're under a law now and that's what's working in Us by the Holy Spirit to make us into the full reality of a child of God he says in Romans 82 he says for the law of the spirit of life we're going to preach on this next Sunday Lord willing but I want to touch on it this morning says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus ha made me free from the law of sin and death not my works not my desires Not My Religion not my beliefs rather there's a law of the Holy spirit amen that is what's doing the work to change you and I this morning there's a law that's happening amen it's trying to set us free from what our circumstances right the world is dark it's in chaos it's without form it's void there's nothing in order but there's a law of the spirit of life that's there to set us free from circumstances you know what I call them circumstances because circumstances can be changed you know what can't be changed seeds you put a seed in one circumstance and it won't produce life but if you change the circumstances the seed will produce what's inside of it and that's what the law of the spirit of life is here to do it's to take us out of the circumstances that prevent life and take us into circumstances that produce eternal life amen that's the law of the spirit of life it's the law of those that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and it's a law that's working constantly you know what laws don't change laws don't bow to circum cumstances the law is the law is the law now somebody can tell you I'm going to give you a break but the law didn't change the person just elected not to use the law amen so we're under a law that in all this chaos in this gross darkness in these sinful bodies in our failed flesh and all of these different things amen there is a seed inside us that's unchanging and there's a law of the spirit of life that's producing an atmosphere by the word to bring us to full life amen I can't stop it why because it's a law I can't say I don't want that law it's a law it's written it's Written in Blood amen and we can't stop it amen I can fight it in this flesh meaning My Flesh can resist amen even when it causes hurt or discomfort or these different things but that law is Unstoppable and it doesn't recognize circumstances all it recognizes is there's power behind it because it's a law how does the law work how does the law of the spirit of Life work it works the same way it did in the beginning the spirit of God moves to set an atmosphere that brings the anointed word that produces eternal life that's the law of the spirit of life amen the great moving of God is to bring eternal life Jesus came and he did great signs and wonders we talked about this a couple Services ago he did great signs and wonders he cast out demons he he opened blind eyes he he opened deaf ears he walked on water and he calmed storms but guess what more storms came he raised the dead and people still died Lazarus still died people still got sick Storm still came people still had their boat swamped that was all temporary amen but Christ didn't come for those things they were just proving who he was amen but his purpose was to bring eternal life and he said in John 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly and then he ties Us in this is so beautiful he's talking to the Jews but he says and other sheep I have Hallelujah that's you and I this morning other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd Jesus was pointing all the way forward his ministry was not yet to us but he was pointing to a time in just a little while that the gospel would turn to the Gentiles under the prophetic anointing of Paul's Ministry what was it God was planning to start calling names out of the Lamb's Book of Life and he would send a word out by the holy spirit that would catch and produce the conditions for their life amen the Holy Spirit was going to go forth to a people that were not a nation that hadn't received a special bloodline that weren't from a particular church or Ministry and it was going to show them that they were really children of God that's how he did it with Abraham and what did they do they'd go out and it'd just be one here and one there and one here and one there and it would be Sovereign and it would be Supernatural what was it it was the spirit of God moving upon the dark upon the the chaos on those things that were out of order and out of it producing children of God they didn't know they were children of God when you look at the description of of of Paul as to what those people were before they realized who they were you talk about Darkness you talk about Sin you talk about filth you talk about perversion some of them were the worst of the the worst some of them would have fit real well into this world we have right now but what happened an atmosphere came and a word came forth and all of a sudden they realized I'm a Child of God Amen he says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light we're called evening Light Fellowship ship here why this is our scripture brother brah says this he says now in the beginning Genesis 1:3 we find that there was Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness he said so does the word of God begin to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning so does it remain until this day amen God bless you just stand if you would I had so much to bring this morning and I just said I'm not going to preach for 2 hours because that's what it take it' take another hour to go through so I said we'll save it for Sunday I won't Tire the people anden I'm not stopping because I'm going hunting I'm stopping because it would genuinely take us an hour to to do the next bit maybe an hour and 15 minutes so I thought it was a good stopping point this morning amen but what am I talking about God's sending what an atmosphere and he's already sent it it's already here and he sends a word he sends a message to what to bring seeds to life to bring seeds to life and you'll notice in the original creation everything was good everything the spirit of God's trying to bring to life is good it's the children of God Amen it's the predestinated it's the elect bride amen so I'm so glad we can say we've received a message because that message is how he produces that life amen it's quickening of the spirit to bring us into what the conditions the circumstances that will allow us to see who and what we really are amen we'll pick it up next Sunday by God's grace let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how grateful we are Lord not just for your
