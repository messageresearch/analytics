[37:26] him. Amen. The closer we get to the end,
[37:30] closer we get to him by grace.
[37:33] Keep falling in love with him. 805.
[37:43] And I keep falling in love with him.
[37:48] Over and over and over [music] and over

[37:56] I keep falling in [music] love with him.

[38:23] love with him over and over and over and

[38:36] with [music] him over and over and over
[38:41] [music] and over my bed.
[38:45] I keep falling in [music] love with him

[40:21] I keep falling in love with him over
[40:26] [music] and over and over and over
[40:31] again.
[40:33] He [music] gets sweeter and [singing]
[40:36] sweeter as the days [music] go by.
[40:41] Oh, what a [singing] love between my
[40:44] Lord and I. I keep [music] falling in
[40:48] love with him over and over and over and

[40:55] again.
[40:58] Heavenly Father,
[41:01] Lord, we're thankful we've got a love in
[41:02] our hearts that keeps growing. Lord, the
[41:05] scripture says at the end that the love
[41:06] of many will wax cold. Lord, it'll be
[41:09] indifferent to you, to your word, to
[41:11] your spirit, Lord. Lord, we're so glad
[41:13] we've got a call that brings us here,
[41:16] Lord. Not just to this building, but it
[41:17] brings us to your presence day by day,
[41:19] Lord. That calls us, Lord, to a place,
[41:22] Lord, where we're satisfied, where we're
[41:24] content, where we're safe,
[41:26] Lord. And so, we just want to thank you
[41:28] this morning for your goodness. We want
[41:29] to thank you for your grace, Lord. We
[41:31] want to thank you for keeping us safe
[41:33] another week, Lord. We want to thank you
[41:35] for bringing us back here, Lord, to hear
[41:37] your word one more time, heavenly
[41:39] father. Lord, we're here to be changed.
[41:41] Lord, we're here to be drawn closer to
[41:43] you, Lord. And we want to walk out those
[41:45] doors this morning, Lord, closer to you
[41:47] and more like Christ than we've ever
[41:48] been in our life before, heavenly
[41:50] father. So, I pray you grant it this
[41:52] morning, Lord. I pray you give us
[41:54] victory this morning, Lord, in the
[41:56] hearing and receiving of your word. We
[41:57] pray over asking you all these things in
[42:00] Jesus Christ's name. We give this
[42:02] service now to you. In his name we pray.
[42:05] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[42:07] would to Genesis chapter 1 this morning.
[42:09] Good to see each one that was willing
[42:11] and able to make it out. Amen. I wanted
[42:15] to thank everyone for the specials and
[42:17] the help and the support for the special
[42:19] meetings this last week. Certainly
[42:21] enjoyed having brother Puy here and and
[42:23] on the way to the airport he said, you
[42:25] know, it's been such a blessing for him.
[42:26] He said, "You guys have been a blessing
[42:28] for me." Uh and so I'm just thankful for
[42:30] that. You want a a minister to come and
[42:32] and and not just give a blessing but
[42:34] receive a blessing. So he was very
[42:36] thankful for that. And then top of that
[42:38] now we announced we've got our next set
[42:40] of special meetings and those will be
[42:42] January 9th through 11th. So we got six
[42:45] short weeks, five weeks I guess from now
[42:46] and brother Aaron Oglesby will be coming
[42:48] up with his wife and uh and he'll be
[42:50] ministering for us. This is kind of a a
[42:53] rebooking of a rebooking from when he
[42:55] first booked to come to uh to preach for
[42:58] our camp this year that got cancelled.
[42:59] So we'll be remembering those as they
[43:01] come up as well. We'll have a fellowship
[43:02] with that of course as as usual. We've
[43:05] got the Christmas concert next Sunday
[43:07] and the fellowship afterwards. So,
[43:09] please remember that each family's been
[43:11] asked to to do something. It can be give
[43:13] a testimony. It can be read a scripture.
[43:14] It can be uh say a poem. You can sing,
[43:17] you can play, you can do whatever you
[43:19] want, but just something that would
[43:20] edify the local body. And we've
[43:22] certainly got many prayer needs this
[43:24] week. We've got Sister Nadine, and she's
[43:27] doing better by God's grace. The
[43:28] doctor's prognosis is she should recover
[43:30] without issue, but she's still got a
[43:32] ways to go. So, we want to remember her,
[43:34] especially sister Cassie as well. She's
[43:36] got a lot going on. And then this on top
[43:38] of it, trying to help her mom and be
[43:39] there for her. It's a lot of stress for
[43:41] anyone to carry. So, we just ask the
[43:43] Lord to be with her. Brother Ron Snow as
[43:45] he's recovering. Sister Beverly as well.
[43:48] Amen. That God would just touch them.
[43:49] Each one had a wonderful time this week
[43:52] and a rough week in some ways and a
[43:54] wonderful time in others. On Monday, I
[43:56] had a young man come to my door that was
[43:58] selling something and and I already had
[44:00] what he was he was selling, but we just
[44:02] talked for a little bit and he was
[44:03] trying to sell me internet and uh and uh
[44:06] I he said I said, "No, you can't. I
[44:09] don't want TV. I just internet. If you
[44:11] quote me internet, I I'll listen." He
[44:12] says, "Well, why don't you want TV?" I
[44:14] said, "Because I don't have a TV." I
[44:16] said, "Well, we have a TV, but it my
[44:18] boys play Minecraft on it." I said, "We
[44:20] don't we're not attached to anything. We
[44:21] don't watch things like that on it and
[44:23] whatnot." He said, "Well, what do you do
[44:24] with your time?" time. I said, "Well,
[44:26] jobs. I'm an engineer by day and I'm a
[44:28] pastor nights and weekends." And and he
[44:30] told me, he said, "Well, I I've decided
[44:31] I've gonna, you know, I think I would
[44:33] like to become a Christian. I've been
[44:34] going back to church." He told me where
[44:35] he was going and these things. And so,
[44:37] he started asking me questions, you
[44:38] know, and he said, "You know, do you do
[44:40] you think I'm a Christian?" I said,
[44:41] "Well, what's a Christian? What does it
[44:42] mean?" And we went through this.
[44:43] Anyways, we were talking for about 15 20
[44:46] minutes. And then I said, "Listen, do
[44:47] you just want to come in and sit down?"
[44:48] So, we sat him down. We fed him some of
[44:50] Elsa's cinnamon buns that she'd made and
[44:52] we gave him a glass of milk and we sat
[44:53] and we talked for two hours about the
[44:55] Lord. So, that was a wonderful thing.
[44:57] Amen. That was a wonderful opportunity.
[44:58] And then he texted me the next day with
[45:00] some follow-up questions. And then
[45:01] Wednesday night, I was laying in bed and
[45:02] he was texting me again about the
[45:04] scriptures he was reading and wanted
[45:05] some clarity on it. So, we thank the
[45:07] Lord for that. You know, brother Mark
[45:08] was sharing with me, you know, some
[45:10] things and you know, how the Lord calls
[45:12] people severally. It's one here, it's
[45:14] one there, and we don't know. All we're
[45:16] here to do is to be a witness. Amen. Of
[45:18] the things he can do. Selena got an
[45:19] opportunity to witness this week as
[45:21] well. I've got some things that I want
[45:22] to talk about that in even in my notes
[45:24] this morning. But we thank the Lord for
[45:26] the opportunity to share Christ. Amen.
[45:28] That there are hungry hearts out there.
[45:30] There are seeking hearts. And if they
[45:32] can just come to a place where the open
[45:34] word is that maybe God can do something
[45:36] with their life. Amen. Brother Matt, do
[45:38] you want me to just switch to this mic
[45:39] or All right, let's do that. I'll just
[45:42] turn this off if that's okay and I'll be
[45:45] the pulpit. That's not usually a problem
[45:46] for me. Amen. Can I just take it off
[45:48] completely, brother Matt? Would that be
[45:49] okay? All right, let's turn to Genesis
[45:52] chapter 1. You're already there, I'm
[45:53] sure. Genesis chapter 1. Amen. And we'll
[45:56] read here. It says, "In the beginning,
[46:04] in the beginning, God created the heaven
[46:05] and the earth.
[46:08] And the earth was without form and void,
[46:10] and darkness was upon the face of the
[46:11] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[46:13] the face of the waters. And God said,
[46:15] "Let there be light." And there was
[46:18] light. And God saw the light that it was
[46:20] good. And God divided the light from the
[46:21] darkness. And God called the light day.
[46:24] And the darkness he called night. And
[46:26] the evening and the morning were the
[46:27] first day. Amen. God bless you. You can
[46:29] have your seats this morning. I want to
[46:31] continue our series on a position of
[46:32] dominion on overcoming. And we we've
[46:35] taken the first of a number of things.
[46:37] And today I want to take the first part
[46:39] of the first victory. Amen. And uh we're
[46:42] going to start this today. There's too
[46:43] much to handle in a service. I didn't
[46:45] want to overload everybody but the la
[46:47] the first service on the series remember
[46:49] we spoke about the first battle and that
[46:51] was when Satan tried to get humanity
[46:53] tried to get Eve to walk away from the
[46:55] word of God and he succeeded. Now, that
[46:57] was speaking of the first human battle,
[46:59] but today I want to step back even
[47:01] beyond that because there's a battle
[47:02] that happened before that here on earth.
[47:04] And it sets the pattern for all other
[47:06] battles. And we've kind of just read
[47:08] about it here this morning. And now last
[47:09] service we spoke on the first enemy. And
[47:12] we saw that our victory and our
[47:13] overcoming have to be as Christ overcame
[47:16] himself. That's what it says in
[47:17] Revelation 3. As I overcame, so you also
[47:20] must overcome to sit with me on our on
[47:22] my throne. And so we saw that Christ had
[47:24] to overcome himself. Satan was not who
[47:26] he had to overcome. Satan's already been
[47:29] defeated, church. It's Jesus that had to
[47:32] defeat himself. He had to defeat the
[47:33] man. He had to defeat the human flesh.
[47:35] And it's the same thing we're facing
[47:36] today. Amen. We have to overcome our
[47:39] personal temptations, our personal
[47:41] trials to overcome. And when we overcome
[47:43] ourselves by the power of the Holy Ghost
[47:45] inside of us, that's when we can have
[47:47] the victory. And what is the victory? To
[47:48] produce the word that's written about
[47:50] you. Get yourself out of the way so that
[47:52] the word can come forth. And I've said
[47:54] this before and I keep saying it because
[47:55] I think it's relevant and we need it. We
[47:57] blame Satan for a lot of things that we
[47:59] do to ourselves. We blame Satan for a
[48:01] lot of things that we decide on our own.
[48:03] And and many people today we're looking
[48:06] around and we're blaming everyone and
[48:07] everything else for what's happening in
[48:10] our life. And I was providing some
[48:12] counsel this week and somebody had asked
[48:14] somebody, you know, uh why did God allow
[48:15] a bad thing to happen to me? And my
[48:18] response was that's not the question you
[48:20] need to ask. The question is, why would
[48:21] God be interested in your life when
[48:23] you're not interested in him? Why would
[48:25] God be interested in you when you want
[48:27] him only to keep you from the bad
[48:29] things, but you don't want the good
[48:30] things that he has? You don't want
[48:32] anything God has for you except what you
[48:34] want from him.
[48:36] That that that's a gold digger. That's
[48:38] what that is. That that's somebody
[48:39] that's taking advantage of someone. You
[48:41] don't want God. You just want the
[48:42] blessings of God without God himself.
[48:44] You want God without the relationship
[48:46] that comes with them. And people want to
[48:48] blame God for bad things, but they never
[48:49] give him credit for the good things. Why
[48:51] did God allow a bad thing, but why? They
[48:53] don't say, "Well, God allowed a good
[48:54] thing to me either." People want to
[48:56] blame everybody but themselves. Amen.
[48:58] And people don't even realize what good
[49:00] is anymore. They think what they want is
[49:02] good. But what God never said, "I won't
[49:04] let bad things happen to you." God said
[49:07] one thing. He says, "All things will
[49:09] work for good to them that are the
[49:11] called according to my purpose." So his
[49:13] promise is not that bad things won't
[49:14] happen. It's that whenever things
[49:16] happen, it's because he's allowed them
[49:18] and he'll use them for our good. Amen.
[49:21] Now, Satan is our adversary and he's a
[49:23] good adversary. He's our enemy. Don't
[49:25] ever forget it. But he cannot touch us
[49:27] unless God allows it. He cannot do a
[49:29] thing in our life unless he unless God
[49:32] allows it. But the thing is, so many
[49:34] times, and this is good, this is odd to
[49:35] preach to believers, but it's the truth.
[49:37] And we'll get into this not so much
[49:39] today, but in the future parts of this
[49:40] service or or this series, is that too
[49:42] many times we're allowing Satan in.
[49:45] We're opening up the door. We're
[49:46] inviting the conversation. We're opening
[49:48] up the window. We're the ones giving him
[49:50] access. He has no access to us unless
[49:53] God allows it or unless we give it to
[49:55] him. Amen. We're a free moral agent and
[49:57] those sorts of things. And so we look at
[50:00] how we make our money, how we spend our
[50:01] money, how we spend our time, the people
[50:03] we are around, the things that we watch,
[50:05] the things that we read, the music we
[50:07] listen to. All these things are access
[50:09] points. And if we look at those things,
[50:12] if we dwell on those things, if we focus
[50:14] on those things, we're opening the door
[50:16] for Satan. But if we've got the word
[50:18] guarding our life, then that's what
[50:19] keeps him out. Amen. By the power of the
[50:21] Holy Ghost. But Satan is always looking
[50:23] for an access point. He's always
[50:26] waiting. He's always looking. and he's
[50:27] very patient and he's trying to get
[50:29] something. He's throwing things at us,
[50:31] trying to get it to stick to our lives
[50:32] by way of our own decision. He throws
[50:35] it, but it won't stick if we don't take
[50:37] it. We talk about that box of
[50:38] rattlesnakes, that sickness, that
[50:40] hardship, whatever it might be. Satan
[50:42] comes and he offers you something and
[50:43] what do you do? You give it back. You
[50:45] say, "I don't want that box of
[50:46] rattlesnakes." If he can get you to hold
[50:48] on to it, everything that happens after
[50:49] that is your fault, not his. Because you
[50:51] accepted the box of rattlesnake. But I
[50:54] don't want to focus on that this
[50:55] morning. That's your pastoral uh uh
[50:59] reminder this morning. It's it's a
[51:00] little uh exhortation this morning. But
[51:02] today, I want to focus on victory. Amen.
[51:04] I want to focus on the first victory.
[51:06] And I want you to be encouraged this
[51:07] morning because I want to overcome. I
[51:10] want you to overcome. Amen. And I want
[51:12] to overcome the way that Christ did.
[51:14] Amen. Because there's a prize that comes
[51:16] with it. And that's to rule and reign
[51:17] with him eternally. So I want to be one
[51:19] of those overcomers. But that means
[51:21] there's a battle to fight. There's a
[51:23] battle to win. And it starts here. And
[51:25] it starts now. And I want to take us all
[51:27] the way back to the beginning of time in
[51:29] our opening scripture because we're
[51:30] going to get into this thought of how
[51:32] that we overcome. And if we see how God
[51:34] overcame, how God got the victory, then
[51:37] we'll see how we do it. And I'm going to
[51:38] be preaching something maybe not so much
[51:40] this service, but the the next couple
[51:42] it'll seem very familiar. But I find the
[51:44] problem with familiarity is that too
[51:46] many people don't really know what it
[51:47] means. We've heard the phrases. We've
[51:50] heard the quotes. We've heard the
[51:51] scriptures. We've heard it said so many
[51:52] times. I'll just say what it is. We
[51:54] overcome by the word. We say that, but
[51:56] what does that really mean? What does
[51:57] that look like? And I want to show what
[51:59] that means this morning. What's really
[52:01] going on so that we can see how God
[52:03] works and how God works so that we can
[52:05] see how God works inside of our life.
[52:07] Now, we go back to our opening scripture
[52:09] says, "In the beginning, God created the
[52:11] heaven and the earth." And brother Brand
[52:13] would say, "Period."
[52:14] We don't know how long it was until
[52:16] verse verse number three.
[52:19] Okay? God created the heaven and the
[52:21] earth. Period. It could have been
[52:22] billions of years that it sat in the
[52:24] form that was in. It says, "And the
[52:26] earth was without form. It was in
[52:29] confusion. It was chaotic. It was
[52:30] meaningless. It had no evident purpose.
[52:33] It was desolate." It says, "And it was
[52:35] void. It was empty and ruins." Now,
[52:37] catch this. It says, "And darkness."
[52:40] Darkness there means misery,
[52:42] destruction, death, ignorance, sorrow.
[52:47] In other words, there is no life there.
[52:49] There is no good. There's no benefit
[52:52] there. The whole thing is in darkness
[52:54] was upon the face of the deep. So you
[52:56] notice here the whole earth is covered
[52:59] in water. There's no way for life to
[53:01] even come forth out of this. There was
[53:03] no land sticking out of this. Okay. Now,
[53:05] now I want you to consider the original
[53:08] uh uh status, the original uh way that
[53:11] the earth was. Amen. The condition of
[53:14] the earth
[53:16] then in no way reflected what God
[53:19] intended it to be.
[53:21] Okay, put your spiritual thinking caps
[53:23] on. If we were to look at the earth
[53:25] visually, there's no light, so we can't
[53:27] even see what's there. But if we were to
[53:28] look at it and describe the earth, would
[53:30] we say this was going to be a land of of
[53:32] life and beauty and growth
[53:36] and peace and calm? No. There is nothing
[53:40] about the earth here that reflects the
[53:42] intentions of God when you look at it.
[53:47] It was dead. It was dark. was devoid of
[53:50] any hope. But listen to this. Amen.
[53:52] We're preaching on the first victory
[53:53] this morning. And here it comes. It
[53:56] says, "And the spirit of God moved upon
[53:59] the face of the waters." Amen. This is
[54:03] where the first victory starts to
[54:04] happen. I want you to see something
[54:05] here. The spirit of God moved. It did
[54:08] not form a massive hurricane or a
[54:10] tornado the size of Newfoundland and
[54:12] come down and just start churning up the
[54:14] waters and moving the land around and
[54:16] separating the clouds out and
[54:18] redistributing the earth so that it came
[54:20] into shape. It didn't do that. The
[54:23] scripture says that the spirit of God
[54:25] moved upon the face of the earth.
[54:28] Church, all God has to do is move. It
[54:31] doesn't have to be big. It doesn't have
[54:33] to be apparent. All he has to do is move
[54:36] and things start to happen. Okay?
[54:39] We look at the whole earth and we say
[54:41] out of that is going to come life and
[54:44] greenery and animals and a and just a a
[54:47] beautiful garden that reflects the very
[54:50] nature of God. And what's going to start
[54:52] it? A move of God. The spirit of God
[54:55] moving. Church, that's all it takes in
[54:57] our relationships with wi with with the
[54:59] people that we're dealing with, with the
[55:01] situations that we're dealing with. We
[55:02] look around this morning. We've got
[55:04] things that have looked dark for a long
[55:06] time. We've got relationships that
[55:08] haven't been repaired. We've got
[55:10] children that haven't been saved. We've
[55:11] got sicknesses that haven't been healed.
[55:13] We've got things that have been bugging
[55:15] us for years. We've got deliverance that
[55:17] hasn't happened.
[55:19] And we look at it and visually it seems
[55:21] like nothing's going on.
[55:24] But what matters is, is the spirit of
[55:26] God moving or not?
[55:28] Because if it's moving, something's got
[55:30] to change.
[55:32] something's going to change.
[55:35] The question is, will we hold on until
[55:36] then? That's what he's asking us to do.
[55:39] It says here that the the spirit of God
[55:41] moved and that word there is hovered.
[55:43] And and it goes back to the idea of a
[55:45] mother bird that's brooding over her
[55:48] eggs. And what she's doing is she's
[55:50] setting the right atmosphere by her
[55:52] presence to keep them warm so that the
[55:55] warmth will bring life to those eggs and
[55:57] it'll produce ones just like the mother.
[56:00] In other words, church, the spirit of
[56:02] God moving sets the atmosphere for life.
[56:06] It sets the atmosphere for something to
[56:08] come forth. But watch how it moves now.
[56:11] Watch how it works. This is critical.
[56:13] I'm setting up your foundation for the
[56:15] understanding of how God brings victory
[56:17] into our lives. Amen. We hear so much.
[56:19] Get the Holy Spirit. That's the most
[56:21] critical thing, church. Get the Holy
[56:22] Spirit. That's the new birth. But what
[56:24] happens when you get the Holy Ghost? It
[56:26] starts to move. And watch how it moves.
[56:29] Watch how it operates. The Holy Ghost
[56:31] starts moving over the darkness and the
[56:33] lifelessness and the hopelessness. And
[56:36] in that moment, nothing changes.
[56:41] Nothing changes. It looks exactly the
[56:44] way it did before it moved.
[56:47] Are you hearing me this morning? Is God
[56:50] moving? Yes. Can you see something? No.
[56:53] Can you see the results yet? No. But
[56:55] watch what follows. The moving of the
[56:57] spirit. Because remember, when God
[56:59] moves, he moves with purpose.
[57:01] I loved how brother Billy read those
[57:03] quotes about
[57:05] Wormwood and Gabriel coming to to God,
[57:07] standing on the banisters of heaven,
[57:09] watching those three Hebrew children,
[57:11] and he's saying, "Lord, are you seeing
[57:13] what's going on? I can go down and I can
[57:15] move the water and I can move the winds
[57:16] and I can do this and that." And God
[57:18] said, "No, I'm going to go down myself."
[57:21] It looked like God was not moving, but
[57:23] when he moved, things started to happen.
[57:25] whether they realized it or not. And the
[57:28] moment they stepped into that fire, it
[57:30] had no effect on them. Why? Because he
[57:32] was there just in time. Okay? He's
[57:35] moving with purpose. God's here to make
[57:37] a lasting change. That's what God wants.
[57:40] God's here for the eternal, not for the
[57:41] temporal. So when he moves, things
[57:44] change for good. And watch it says this.
[57:46] And God said, "Let there be light." So
[57:49] when the spirit of God moves, what does
[57:50] he do? He brings the word. He brings the
[57:54] word. Okay, that's the evidence of the
[57:56] spirit of God moving is it brings the
[57:58] word. That's how you know it's the Holy
[58:01] Spirit is the word comes with it. It's
[58:04] not just emotions. It's not just
[58:05] feelings. It's not just shouting and
[58:07] hollering and dancing and clapping and
[58:09] all these things, but it brings the word
[58:10] with it. That's why you see
[58:12] denominations fail is the spirit comes,
[58:14] they say, and no word comes with it. You
[58:17] just get a good time.
[58:20] And it is a good time, but that's all
[58:23] that comes with it. And that's why
[58:24] there's no change. The word comes with
[58:26] the spirit. Okay, watch what he h what
[58:28] happens. He says, "Let there be light."
[58:31] Colon. Now remember church, scripture is
[58:34] written exactly the way it is with
[58:36] purpose. God said, "Let there be light."
[58:39] And then there's a pause. There's a
[58:41] period of time.
[58:43] Amen.
[58:45] In other words, there was a gap between
[58:47] the spoken word
[58:50] and the manifested word, between what
[58:53] God saying it
[58:55] and it being produced.
[58:58] There's a gap and then and there was
[59:03] light.
[59:04] The spirit of God moves. Spirit of God
[59:06] speaks the word space of time and then
[59:08] the word of God comes into reality. And
[59:10] that's the way that God works. Amen. The
[59:13] spirit of God moves. The word is spoken.
[59:15] There is a pause where we may not see
[59:18] anything,
[59:20] but it doesn't mean the spirit's not
[59:21] moving. And that's the trial of our
[59:24] faith. As I've said many times, is the
[59:25] gap between the speaking and the
[59:27] occurring. That's the trial of our
[59:28] faith. That's what holds us there. Amen.
[59:31] It's move, speak, let it work, believe
[59:36] it whether you can see it or not, and
[59:38] then the reality comes in. That's the
[59:40] way that God brings victory. Amen. That
[59:42] pause can be a split second
[59:45] or it can be 25 years.
[59:48] Abraham and Sarah 25 years between the
[59:50] spoken word and the manifested word. Was
[59:53] God working any less in Abraham and
[59:54] Sarah's life? No. Preserving them,
[59:58] keeping them, protecting them, leading
[1:00:00] them, guiding them, taking them exactly
[1:00:03] to the place where they would know it
[1:00:04] was God and God alone that did it. And
[1:00:07] through it all, the scripture says that
[1:00:08] Abraham ignored everything else, called
[1:00:10] the things that were as though they were
[1:00:12] not, the things that were not as though
[1:00:13] they were, and was strong giving fa in
[1:00:16] faith.
[1:00:18] That's the way he walked.
[1:00:21] Amen. What's the first thing that God
[1:00:23] created? We preached on this before, so
[1:00:26] I won't go into the depths of it here,
[1:00:28] but the first thing that God created was
[1:00:30] light. And that was not the sun, the
[1:00:31] moon, and the stars, remember? Because
[1:00:33] those were created on the fourth day.
[1:00:35] But here he's creating the attribute of
[1:00:37] light, the nature of light itself. And
[1:00:40] that nature and that attribute was a
[1:00:42] reflection of himself. As we preached
[1:00:44] before, this was God creating a pillar
[1:00:46] of fire for himself to dwell in. And
[1:00:50] every bit of light after that was just a
[1:00:52] physical manifestation of the
[1:00:54] supernatural element of God, of the very
[1:00:57] attribute and nature of God. Amen.
[1:00:59] That's what he was he was doing when he
[1:01:00] produced the sun, moon and stars was
[1:01:02] just something that reflected his own
[1:01:04] nature.
[1:01:06] God was creating his own dwelling place.
[1:01:10] We sing that song how great is our God
[1:01:11] and it says he wrapped himself in light.
[1:01:14] That's exactly what he did here. Brother
[1:01:16] would say this. He says so first he
[1:01:18] first was God Jehovah and out of him he
[1:01:20] says now let's just picture now as a
[1:01:22] little drama so you can get it. Let's
[1:01:23] see coming out of space where there's
[1:01:25] nothing. Let's make it a little white
[1:01:27] light, just a mystic light like a halo.
[1:01:30] And that was the logos that went out of
[1:01:32] God in the beginning. That was the son
[1:01:34] of God that came out of the bosom of the
[1:01:36] father. That was what was in the
[1:01:38] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:01:39] with God and the word was God. He says,
[1:01:42] "And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:01:44] among us." In the beginning was God and
[1:01:46] then out of God came the logos, a part
[1:01:49] of God that went out of God. So that
[1:01:52] light was the logos of God, the
[1:01:54] expression of God, the physical
[1:01:55] manifestation of God made visible to us.
[1:01:59] And everything comes out of that
[1:02:00] supernatural light. We'll get into it as
[1:02:02] we read the scriptures. Everything comes
[1:02:04] out of that light. Brother Brand would
[1:02:06] say we come from it and we go back to
[1:02:07] it. It all comes from that supernatural
[1:02:10] light. Amen. Because that's the word
[1:02:12] expressed and everything that we are,
[1:02:14] everything that we have comes from the
[1:02:15] expression of the word. It's the
[1:02:17] starting point of everything. Brother
[1:02:19] Ram says it this way. He says, "God said
[1:02:20] over this dark, gloomy, dismal, mossy
[1:02:23] world that stood here without light, he
[1:02:25] said, let there be light." And it wasn't
[1:02:28] light until that word was manifested.
[1:02:31] Then it was light. In other words,
[1:02:33] saying the words, "Let there be light,"
[1:02:35] doesn't mean we have light.
[1:02:39] Can you put yourself there this morning?
[1:02:42] Saying we have it, doesn't mean it's
[1:02:44] there,
[1:02:46] but it means it's going to be there.
[1:02:49] It may not be there already, but it's
[1:02:51] going to be there. Amen. We have the
[1:02:53] word, but we didn't have the product of
[1:02:54] the word all the time. Amen. The word
[1:02:56] itself was not light when it was spoken,
[1:02:59] but it was power to produce the light.
[1:03:02] That's exactly what it is. Amen. It took
[1:03:04] the word being manifested for light to
[1:03:07] actually exist. Until it happened, we
[1:03:09] didn't know what light was. It had no
[1:03:11] definition. Amen. But when the word of
[1:03:13] God was spoken, it meant that light was
[1:03:16] coming whether we liked it or not,
[1:03:17] whether we wanted it or not. Whether we
[1:03:19] believed or not, it didn't matter. The
[1:03:20] word went out and it said, "Let there be
[1:03:22] light." And so light had to come forth.
[1:03:25] Amen. But until it came forth. It was
[1:03:27] just a promise. It was just a potential.
[1:03:32] But because it's the word of God, not
[1:03:33] the word of man, it was a certainty. And
[1:03:37] so whether it took a billion years or
[1:03:38] whether it took a second, it doesn't
[1:03:40] matter. It was going to happen. Amen.
[1:03:42] Light was a certainty because God said
[1:03:44] it. So what we need today is what? Not
[1:03:48] just the spoken word, not just the
[1:03:50] written word, but we need the reality of
[1:03:52] the word because that's where the
[1:03:54] overcoming is.
[1:03:56] We've got to take it in our hearts by
[1:03:58] faith, but it's got to come out and
[1:04:00] produce itself for us to actually have
[1:04:02] what we're talking about. We believe by
[1:04:05] his stripes we are healed. But we need
[1:04:07] it, don't we, Sister Brenda? We got to
[1:04:09] have it in our in our in our ears and in
[1:04:11] our jaws.
[1:04:14] That's what the reality of it is. That's
[1:04:16] the victory. the the the when it's
[1:04:18] spoken, it's the potential, but it's the
[1:04:20] reality that's the victory. That's what
[1:04:23] we're looking for in our lives. Amen. We
[1:04:25] look at this, the spoken word, what does
[1:04:26] it do? The written word, it gives us
[1:04:28] faith. Faith comes by hearing and
[1:04:31] hearing by the word. That's what Paul
[1:04:32] said. So, hearing the word gives us
[1:04:34] faith to walk and trust God even when we
[1:04:38] don't see anything changing. But when is
[1:04:41] victory? Victory is when our faith has
[1:04:43] been made sight and we have what we
[1:04:46] believe. We've had what we've talked
[1:04:47] about. We've had what we've held on to.
[1:04:50] And it finally comes out. When it
[1:04:51] becomes the word manifested, that's when
[1:04:54] our victory comes. Okay?
[1:04:58] We need light to live and have a full
[1:05:00] life.
[1:05:02] That's why Newfoundlanders are some of
[1:05:03] the hardiest people in the world because
[1:05:05] we get so little light yet we live so
[1:05:08] sun so little sunlight. It's getting
[1:05:09] better and better every year. I hate to
[1:05:11] say bring on climate change, but it
[1:05:13] seems to be doing wonders for sunshine.
[1:05:16] But the we need light to live and have a
[1:05:19] full life. You can live without light,
[1:05:21] but it's a miserable existence. You
[1:05:23] know, they've got these fish down. If
[1:05:25] you go real low into the ocean, then
[1:05:26] they've got animals there that have no
[1:05:27] eyes. They've got them in caves where
[1:05:29] they don't have them either. They are
[1:05:31] completely blind because they don't need
[1:05:33] it because there's no light. Now, those
[1:05:35] fish, they live a life, but they're
[1:05:37] missing so much because they can't see.
[1:05:40] They don't know what they're missing
[1:05:41] because that's all they've known.
[1:05:44] It's our natural condition. We don't
[1:05:45] know what we're missing because we're
[1:05:47] blind to the light. Amen. They exist,
[1:05:49] but they're not really living life.
[1:05:51] Amen. Now, watch this. We're speaking of
[1:05:53] the first victory. And I want to catch
[1:05:54] the foundation of why God brought light
[1:05:57] first. Brother says, "Well, there was a
[1:05:59] time when the world was laying in utter
[1:06:01] darkness. It was without form and was
[1:06:03] void. And it was all covered with water
[1:06:05] and was laying there in the dark,
[1:06:07] dismal, gloomy atmosphere." Anybody ever
[1:06:11] have a dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere
[1:06:13] from time to time? [laughter]
[1:06:19] That's the human condition.
[1:06:21] Guess what? God's here to take us out of
[1:06:23] the human condition. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:25] But sometimes we have days where it just
[1:06:27] seems like the cloud follows us
[1:06:29] everywhere we go.
[1:06:31] It says, "And the spirit of God moved
[1:06:33] upon that water and said, "Let there be
[1:06:35] light." He said God had a reason to do
[1:06:38] that. For down beneath that water, there
[1:06:40] were seeds that he had planted and it
[1:06:43] had to have that sunlight to make it
[1:06:46] live.
[1:06:49] The purpose of God's creation was to
[1:06:51] bring life.
[1:06:53] To bring life that already had potential
[1:06:55] by seed form, but it needed to have
[1:06:58] reality. How? By the light. By the life
[1:07:01] of God. God didn't create light and step
[1:07:03] into it just to have it. He did it
[1:07:05] because that's the overcoming power.
[1:07:08] That's what brings life out of death.
[1:07:10] That's what brings life out of darkness.
[1:07:12] God pre God created light to produce the
[1:07:15] rest of his purpose and plan and bring
[1:07:17] it into reality. That's the reason that
[1:07:19] he did it. Okay? It started with light.
[1:07:21] When light came, victory was imminent.
[1:07:23] That's the beauty of it. When light
[1:07:24] came, it meant that everything else was
[1:07:26] going to follow that life needed. Now,
[1:07:28] watch this victory. Here's the first
[1:07:29] victory. We have to catch this this
[1:07:31] morning. It says God saw the light that
[1:07:33] it was good and God divided the light
[1:07:37] from the darkness. God called the light
[1:07:39] day, the darkness he called night and
[1:07:41] the evening and the morning were the
[1:07:42] first day. Says God divided the light
[1:07:44] from the darkness. It means he made a
[1:07:46] difference between them. He separated
[1:07:48] them. He distinguished one from the
[1:07:50] other. He severed them from each other.
[1:07:54] The first victory that ever happens in
[1:07:56] scripture that is when God moved, he
[1:07:59] spoke and then what he spoke became
[1:08:01] reality and that reality had a lasting
[1:08:05] eternal effect. Okay, that's the first
[1:08:08] victory. The reality of what God said
[1:08:13] came forth
[1:08:15] and it defined something here. And we
[1:08:17] see that he gave light the attribute
[1:08:19] that where it was darkness could not
[1:08:22] coexist.
[1:08:25] That may not seem like much to us today
[1:08:27] because we say duh.
[1:08:29] Everybody knows that if you have light,
[1:08:31] darkness can't be there.
[1:08:34] Why? Because God divided them. God said
[1:08:39] light and darkness can be not cannot be
[1:08:41] in the same place at the same time. And
[1:08:44] that is his attribute. It's his design.
[1:08:48] That's the way that he made it. Amen. We
[1:08:50] take it for granted that light defeats
[1:08:52] darkness. But that's the very attribute
[1:08:55] and nature that God gave light. Let me
[1:08:58] say it this way. If darkness was a
[1:09:00] person, if darkness was was a disease,
[1:09:03] if darkness was a a power with
[1:09:05] consciousness, darkness wasn't worried
[1:09:07] when God said, "Let there be light."
[1:09:12] Church, Satan isn't worried when you
[1:09:14] speak it.
[1:09:15] You catch what I'm saying this morning?
[1:09:19] You know, it brought to mind
[1:09:22] in that I think it was the first or the
[1:09:24] second
[1:09:26] uh
[1:09:28] in the in the chosen series where
[1:09:30] Nicodemus comes to Mary Magdalene.
[1:09:34] And you know what he tries to do? He
[1:09:36] tries to cast out those demons by
[1:09:38] theology.
[1:09:41] And you know what happened? He left.
[1:09:45] The demons didn't do anything
[1:09:48] because there was no reality in
[1:09:49] Nicodemus's life.
[1:09:52] We can say the words all day long. Satan
[1:09:55] doesn't care.
[1:09:58] But let me say this. Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] What made darkness start to tremble?
[1:10:06] What made darkness start to cry out?
[1:10:09] What made darkness start to run? church.
[1:10:13] It was when that smallest of lights
[1:10:17] started to flicker.
[1:10:22] And they said, "We can't be here. We've
[1:10:24] got to go. We can't be in the same
[1:10:27] place."
[1:10:28] And they went running at the smallest of
[1:10:31] lights. And it grew and it grew into
[1:10:34] this massive pillar of fire where God
[1:10:36] would dwelt.
[1:10:40] Church, darkness didn't lose its power.
[1:10:42] It lost its right to exist.
[1:10:46] Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] Put it on. Put your spiritual thinking
[1:10:50] caps on. When light comes, darkness
[1:10:53] doesn't lose its power. It loses its
[1:10:55] right to exist.
[1:10:59] It cannot stay where light is.
[1:11:03] This is the victory.
[1:11:05] In other words, it wasn't the spoken
[1:11:08] word
[1:11:10] that got the victory. It was the
[1:11:13] manifested word that was the victory.
[1:11:16] Amen. That's what happened here. It was
[1:11:20] the reality of the word that overcame
[1:11:22] darkness. The spoken word was the
[1:11:24] certainty, but the reality was the
[1:11:25] victory of it. It was the product of the
[1:11:27] word that moved darkness out of the way.
[1:11:30] This is what it says in the book of
[1:11:31] John. It says, "In the beginning was the
[1:11:33] word. The word was with God and the word
[1:11:35] was God. We just saw this. God spoke the
[1:11:37] word. The word became reality. God
[1:11:38] stepped into his own creation to express
[1:11:40] himself fully. The same was in the
[1:11:42] beginning with God. All things were made
[1:11:44] by him. That's why I said all things
[1:11:45] come from light. All things go back to
[1:11:47] light. And with him was not anything
[1:11:49] made that was made. In him was life. And
[1:11:53] the life was what? The light of men. Now
[1:11:57] notice that life is by light. It's
[1:11:59] eternal light. It's eternal life. God's
[1:12:01] life. God's attributes being expressed.
[1:12:03] It says in verse five, "And the light
[1:12:05] shineth, present tense, it's still
[1:12:08] shining."
[1:12:10] The light is still shining in darkness.
[1:12:12] And it says, "And the darkness
[1:12:14] comprehended it not." So when light
[1:12:16] started shining at the beginning, it
[1:12:18] never stopped shining. And since then,
[1:12:20] darkness, it says, comprehended it not.
[1:12:24] The literal translation there is, and
[1:12:25] darkness did not overcome it.
[1:12:29] Why? Because God divided the two. They
[1:12:31] could not exist simultaneously. So I
[1:12:33] would say it this way. It's not that
[1:12:35] light darkness did not overcome it. It's
[1:12:37] that light overcame darkness. That's
[1:12:38] what we're saying this morning. Light
[1:12:40] overcame darkness. Light always beats
[1:12:43] darkness. Darkness is a defeated enemy.
[1:12:46] If you're in the dark, you can defeat
[1:12:48] him today with light. It doesn't change.
[1:12:50] Doesn't matter where you go. Doesn't
[1:12:52] matter how thick, how heavy that
[1:12:53] darkness is. If you've got light, you've
[1:12:55] defeated darkness every single time.
[1:13:00] What couldn't darkness overcome?
[1:13:03] The manifestation,
[1:13:05] the reality of the word. Amen. When the
[1:13:08] word became reality, darkness couldn't
[1:13:09] win. That smallest little flicker. Amen.
[1:13:12] Are you hearing me this morning? You
[1:13:14] say, "I'm just a little Christian."
[1:13:16] Brother John. It doesn't matter. The
[1:13:18] littlest light defeats darkness.
[1:13:22] Do you ever go into uh you know
[1:13:25] sometimes the kids will get these um
[1:13:26] these uh little stickers and they have
[1:13:29] you know they're they're luminescent and
[1:13:30] that hey dad come here I want you to
[1:13:31] show my sticker and that you know they
[1:13:33] put it on their paper and then they say
[1:13:34] let's go into the closet. Well church
[1:13:37] that little sticker with its luminance
[1:13:39] as little as it is you go into a
[1:13:40] completely dark closet and you turn that
[1:13:42] on. Guess what? You can see things in
[1:13:44] the closet by the little light of that
[1:13:46] luminescent sticker. You know you have a
[1:13:49] smartwatch. There's not much light on
[1:13:51] this, but you go into a closet and you
[1:13:54] just flip that watch and guess what? You
[1:13:56] can see everything. We've got a a fire a
[1:13:58] smoke alarm in our bedroom and in the
[1:14:00] middle of the night when everything's
[1:14:01] dark, that tiny little green annoying
[1:14:03] light, you can see everything in your
[1:14:06] room that you need to see.
[1:14:10] Why? Light defeats darkness. You don't
[1:14:13] have to be big. You just have to be
[1:14:15] light. And then darkness can't stay
[1:14:17] there. Amen.
[1:14:19] The first victory was when God expressed
[1:14:22] himself by the spoken word and it became
[1:14:24] reality. And the victory he got then is
[1:14:27] the victory he has now. Light always
[1:14:30] beats darkness.
[1:14:32] This is a very simple concept this
[1:14:34] morning. And I don't have a long service
[1:14:35] for you this morning either. Been
[1:14:37] fighting the flu and I just had to keep
[1:14:38] it short to make sure that my voice
[1:14:40] would survive. But I want you to catch
[1:14:42] this foundation. Light defeats darkness.
[1:14:45] manifested word destroys Satan. We could
[1:14:49] put it another way. He says, "Now
[1:14:50] remember, light comes by the spoken word
[1:14:52] of God." God said, "Let there be light.
[1:14:54] There was no light." And he said, "Let
[1:14:56] there be light and there was light." He
[1:14:58] says, "That's a proof."
[1:15:00] What's he doing, church? He's saying if
[1:15:02] he spoke his word and it happened, then
[1:15:04] there's your proof. Believe him for the
[1:15:06] same thing today. He says, "Now what if
[1:15:09] he just said it and no light came?"
[1:15:11] Well, then we don't know whether it's
[1:15:12] true or not. We don't know whether he's
[1:15:14] all right. We don't know whether he's
[1:15:15] God or not because he just said let
[1:15:16] there be and there wasn't. See, so then
[1:15:19] when God speaks and we see it is, then
[1:15:21] that's the light that shines forth the
[1:15:24] truth of the word. See, there is light
[1:15:26] and life. Now I want to ask you
[1:15:28] something. When that light came forth on
[1:15:31] the first day, did the earth have
[1:15:32] victory?
[1:15:35] Did did plants just spring forth? Did
[1:15:37] animal life come forth? Did land come
[1:15:39] forth? Did everything just happen as
[1:15:41] soon as the light hit? Did everything
[1:15:42] did the earth just just come into full
[1:15:44] bloom and and to its full potential?
[1:15:47] No.
[1:15:49] All that happened was light.
[1:15:52] That's it.
[1:15:53] But light brought imminent victory.
[1:15:57] When the light hits, things start to
[1:16:00] change.
[1:16:02] When God expresses himself, that's when
[1:16:04] things start to change. Amen. So the the
[1:16:06] the the process have been started. I
[1:16:09] don't know if you've ever done this.
[1:16:11] I've done it on cliffs before where you
[1:16:13] take a rock
[1:16:15] as big as you can handle because you
[1:16:17] want the boom to be big and you take it
[1:16:18] to the edge of a hill or a cliff and
[1:16:20] then you just push it over.
[1:16:22] Once it's gone, church, is there any
[1:16:25] stopping that rock?
[1:16:27] Remember Daniel saw a rock that had been
[1:16:28] hewed out without hands. And when it
[1:16:31] started rolling, it destroyed everything
[1:16:32] in its path. There's no stopping a rock
[1:16:34] once it starts to roll down a hill. When
[1:16:36] the light comes, it's like that rock
[1:16:37] that rolls over the hill. Victory is
[1:16:39] imminent. It's going to do what it's
[1:16:41] supposed to do.
[1:16:43] You catching what I'm saying? Light and
[1:16:45] darkness cannot coexist. And so the
[1:16:47] victory we're looking for today is to
[1:16:50] take that absolute attribute. What? That
[1:16:53] the spoken word produces the manifested
[1:16:55] word. And that's what takes us to
[1:16:57] victory. If God said it, God will do it.
[1:17:02] If God said we're going to be there,
[1:17:03] we're going to be there. If God said I'm
[1:17:05] healed, then I'm going to be healed. If
[1:17:07] God said I'm going to be delivered, I'm
[1:17:08] going to be delivered. If God said I'm
[1:17:10] going to be saved, I'm going to be
[1:17:11] saved. If God said I'm going to get the
[1:17:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm going to
[1:17:13] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If
[1:17:16] God said I'm going to be spotless and
[1:17:17] without wrinkle, I'm going to be without
[1:17:19] I'm going to be spotless and without
[1:17:20] wrinkle.
[1:17:22] That's the absolute of the word of God.
[1:17:24] That's the absolute of the light. Amen.
[1:17:27] Brother Bram says this. God said, "Let
[1:17:29] there be light." And that was the word.
[1:17:31] He says, "But now there is light. It
[1:17:33] isn't the word. It's the light." You
[1:17:36] see, God's not up there. God God didn't
[1:17:38] give us this word so we could just read
[1:17:39] it. God gave us this word so we could be
[1:17:41] it. The purpose of the spoken word is
[1:17:44] that it would be manifested. That it
[1:17:45] would become a reality. Amen. He says
[1:17:48] now there's he says now there's light.
[1:17:50] It isn't the word. It's the light. See
[1:17:52] what I mean? Now it isn't just a written
[1:17:54] word to us. It's a reality.
[1:17:58] He says we are in him. Now we're
[1:18:00] enjoying. Now we behold him. Now we see
[1:18:02] him. The word manifesting himself. He
[1:18:04] says it's hid out there because why?
[1:18:06] It's veiled in human flesh. What's God
[1:18:09] trying to do? Get the word to express
[1:18:11] itself in flesh. Again, that's what he's
[1:18:14] trying to do. That's what shakes the
[1:18:15] devil. What shakes the devil is not the
[1:18:17] spoken word. What shakes the devil is
[1:18:19] the manifested word. It's sons and
[1:18:21] daughters of God that are the word, not
[1:18:23] just talking about the word. That's what
[1:18:26] God's looking for in our lives today.
[1:18:28] That's what destroys kingdoms. That's
[1:18:30] what puts away darkness. That's what
[1:18:31] gives lasting victory is when the word
[1:18:34] becomes a reality, not just the
[1:18:36] theology. That's what God's trying to
[1:18:38] do. Amen. The word spoken in faith has
[1:18:41] power, but the victory comes when the
[1:18:43] word is made manifest. That's what takes
[1:18:45] away the darkness. That's what wins the
[1:18:47] battle in the end. Now, watch how you
[1:18:49] watch how this progresses. We have light
[1:18:51] in the beginning, and it separates light
[1:18:52] from darkness. It overcomes darkness. It
[1:18:55] defeats darkness. However way you want
[1:18:56] to say it, light beats darkness. It's
[1:18:58] like rock, paper, scissors. Some things
[1:19:00] are absolute. Light beats darkness every
[1:19:02] single time. And yet the world fell into
[1:19:05] a fallen condition after this. Why?
[1:19:07] Because they got away from the light.
[1:19:10] They got away from the absolute of the
[1:19:11] word of God. They spiraled into a life
[1:19:14] of separation from God into
[1:19:15] disobedience, self-reliance,
[1:19:17] self-righteousness. And they were
[1:19:19] further away from God than ever. By the
[1:19:20] time that Jesus came, they were more
[1:19:23] religious than ever, but they were
[1:19:25] outside of God's will and way. They were
[1:19:26] living in total darkness. Blind leading
[1:19:28] the blind. And that's what Jesus called
[1:19:30] them. And you know what? We've got the
[1:19:32] exact same thing today. Revelation 3 for
[1:19:34] the Leodysian church age says they're
[1:19:36] miserable, wretched, poor, blind, and
[1:19:38] naked. And they don't know it. So we're
[1:19:40] dealing today with a people with a world
[1:19:42] that's in the exact same self-righteous
[1:19:44] condition of blindness, of darkness. So
[1:19:48] what's the solution?
[1:19:50] Bring the light. That's the only thing
[1:19:52] we can do. That's the only thing God can
[1:19:53] do. God's answer to darkness is send the
[1:19:56] light. That's the Macedonian call. Send
[1:19:58] the light. We're in darkness. We need a
[1:20:00] man that can turn on the lights. I've
[1:20:01] been listening. I listened to that
[1:20:02] message, finished it this week. There's
[1:20:04] a man that can turn on the lights. And
[1:20:06] that's where we get much of the
[1:20:07] inspiration for this. There's a man that
[1:20:09] can turn on the lights. Amen.
[1:20:12] Not just the word light, but the reality
[1:20:14] of the word. That's what Christ was. He
[1:20:17] wasn't the written word. He was the
[1:20:18] manifested word.
[1:20:21] Brother says this. He says, "So the word
[1:20:23] of God began to separate the light from
[1:20:25] the darkness from the beginning, and so
[1:20:27] does it remain until this day." God
[1:20:30] doesn't change his pattern. If God got a
[1:20:31] victory one way, he'll keep getting the
[1:20:33] victory that way. He sets the same
[1:20:35] pattern. And how does he do it? He
[1:20:37] separates the light from the darkness by
[1:20:39] the reality of his word.
[1:20:42] Church, that's why I believe what we
[1:20:43] have today is right? Because it works.
[1:20:47] It doesn't just sound like it works. It
[1:20:49] works.
[1:20:50] I'm different today than I was last
[1:20:52] year, than I was 10 years ago, than I
[1:20:54] was was when I was a young teenager.
[1:20:56] Why? Because the word works. It brings a
[1:20:58] reality with itself. Amen. And it's
[1:21:01] what? The manifestation of the word, not
[1:21:03] just the speaking of the word. I can say
[1:21:05] all day long, I'm a flashlight, but
[1:21:07] until I become a flashlight, darkness
[1:21:09] doesn't have to worry about me. I can
[1:21:11] say all day long, I'm a Christian, but
[1:21:13] until Christ comes in and produces
[1:21:15] Christ, then Satan doesn't have to
[1:21:17] worry. But as soon as Christ comes in,
[1:21:19] light and darkness can't coexist. And so
[1:21:21] Satan has to go. Amen. That's when he
[1:21:24] starts to worry. Listen to Jesus own
[1:21:26] words. Now he says, "I am come a light
[1:21:29] into the world that whosoever believeth
[1:21:32] on me should not abide in darkness."
[1:21:36] Abide in darkness. So they don't have to
[1:21:38] remain. They don't have to dwell. They
[1:21:40] don't have to continue or endure in
[1:21:41] darkness. In other words, Jesus came to
[1:21:43] take us into light. Take us into life.
[1:21:46] We would say it that way. So what does
[1:21:47] Jesus do? Jesus starts to do the same
[1:21:50] thing that the spirit of God did in the
[1:21:52] first place. Set an atmosphere.
[1:21:56] He starts to go around and he starts to
[1:21:58] set an atmosphere. He did exactly what
[1:21:59] the light did in the beginning. He
[1:22:01] started moving waters. He started
[1:22:02] changing situations. He started shaping
[1:22:05] land. He started bringing seeds to life.
[1:22:08] That's what the light does. He started
[1:22:10] changing the status quo.
[1:22:12] Church, when you meet him, you'll never
[1:22:14] be the same. Whether you go to the right
[1:22:16] hand or to the left, whether you go with
[1:22:19] him or you walk away from him, you'll
[1:22:20] never be the same again. That's what he
[1:22:22] came to do. He started breaking down
[1:22:24] traditions. Jesus started digging in the
[1:22:26] muck. Hallelujah. He started digging in
[1:22:29] the muck. What? So that those seeds that
[1:22:31] have been buried for so long could feel
[1:22:33] the warmth of his light, of the presence
[1:22:35] of the manifested word, and so that they
[1:22:38] could come forth. And in seeing who he
[1:22:40] was, they could start to see who they
[1:22:41] were. and they could start to produce
[1:22:43] something they never even realized.
[1:22:45] Jesus did a lot of talking. But church,
[1:22:47] he walked the talk. Why? Because he was
[1:22:50] the manifested word. He was the He
[1:22:52] wasn't just there to talk about victory.
[1:22:54] He was the victory. He was the victory.
[1:22:58] Remember, he walked up to to to that
[1:23:00] that madman of Gera. And the demons know
[1:23:03] who he is. They know what's coming
[1:23:05] before he says anything. And they say,
[1:23:07] "Listen, just let us go peacefully.
[1:23:10] Don't cast us out. We'll go someplace
[1:23:12] else if you let us go where we want.
[1:23:14] Where do you want to go? Go in the pigs.
[1:23:15] He says, "All right, go into the pigs."
[1:23:16] And what they do? They went over the
[1:23:17] cliff and they died.
[1:23:19] They knew who he was. Jesus didn't have
[1:23:22] victory theology. He was victory walking
[1:23:25] in leather. That's what he was. He was
[1:23:28] the reality. He was the He was the
[1:23:30] manifest of victory. Amen. Like I said,
[1:23:33] do you see Nicodemus going in there and
[1:23:35] trying to cast out with his theology and
[1:23:37] there's nothing there because all he's
[1:23:38] got is ideas. And then Jesus comes and
[1:23:41] in a moment changes her life. Mary
[1:23:44] Magdalene became one of the greatest
[1:23:45] witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:47] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:49] See the problem is we look so often at
[1:23:51] what Jesus did and we want to do what he
[1:23:53] did. But the thing is we've got to be
[1:23:56] what he is so we can do what he did. And
[1:23:58] that's the hard part. That's the hard
[1:24:00] part is we got to be who and what he is
[1:24:02] in order to do amen. We got to go from
[1:24:04] saying I am a flashlight to being a
[1:24:06] flashlight.
[1:24:08] We can't do the works of Christ until
[1:24:10] we're the same expression. We got the
[1:24:11] same source. We've got the same life,
[1:24:13] the same light inside of us. That's our
[1:24:15] victory right there. Brother Ram
[1:24:16] continues. He says, "So it is in every
[1:24:18] way, every age, the word made manifest,
[1:24:21] come to life. Is the light of that age
[1:24:23] there, the word made manifest. That's
[1:24:24] why when that young man comes to my
[1:24:26] door, I'm so eager to talk to him. Not
[1:24:29] because of what I don't have, but
[1:24:31] because of what I do have." When Peter
[1:24:34] and John came to the gate, beautiful
[1:24:35] such as I have give I thee. What am I
[1:24:37] there to give him? I'm not there to give
[1:24:38] him a church experience. I'm there to
[1:24:40] give him Christ. I'm there to give him
[1:24:42] light. I'm there to give him life.
[1:24:45] That's what we're looking for.
[1:24:48] He says there the word may manifest.
[1:24:51] They're the light of that age.
[1:24:53] You young sisters, when you walk around
[1:24:55] in your modest dress, you're a light.
[1:24:59] Brothers, when you hold yourself back
[1:25:01] from certain things, when you don't
[1:25:02] laugh at things, when you don't look at
[1:25:03] things, you don't engage in things,
[1:25:04] you're a light whether you realize it or
[1:25:06] not. And if people could only recognize
[1:25:09] that, they could come to Christ.
[1:25:12] But so often they don't. He says, just
[1:25:14] like it was in Genesis 1 when God said,
[1:25:16] "Let there be light." And there was
[1:25:17] light. When God said, "There will be a
[1:25:19] son and there was a son." He says, "When
[1:25:21] God said in Joel 2:28, it shall come to
[1:25:24] pass in the last days I'll pour out my
[1:25:26] spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and
[1:25:28] your daughters shall prophesy upon my
[1:25:30] handmaids and maidservant while I pour
[1:25:32] out of my spirit. Your young men shall
[1:25:34] see visions. Your old men shall see
[1:25:35] dreams.
[1:25:37] He's saying what? It's going from spoken
[1:25:40] to reality, spoken to manifested, spoken
[1:25:44] to the real deal. He says, "And all
[1:25:47] these things that he promised when it
[1:25:49] the Holy Ghost fell was the light upon
[1:25:52] that word. When the word was made
[1:25:54] manifest, then it became light.
[1:25:58] See, we say and we believe and this is
[1:26:00] we'll be getting there in this series.
[1:26:02] We overcome by the word of God. That's
[1:26:05] how we overcome. That's how Jesus
[1:26:06] overcame. But we have to realize the
[1:26:08] overcoming is not in the speaking. The
[1:26:10] overcoming is in the reality.
[1:26:13] You got to have something. Brother Bman,
[1:26:14] I don't have the quote with me. We'll
[1:26:16] read it next service maybe. He says,
[1:26:17] "You can't come and bluff.
[1:26:19] You've got to have Christ inside. That's
[1:26:22] the light. That's the life. That's the
[1:26:23] overcoming that's inside of us. Amen.
[1:26:25] Amen. The word is our anchor. But there
[1:26:27] has to come a day where our faith
[1:26:29] becomes sight.
[1:26:31] Remember, the last victory is death. The
[1:26:34] last thing we conquer is death. But
[1:26:36] there's a whole bunch of more things
[1:26:37] have to happen before then. And it's by
[1:26:39] believing in the word, holding on to it
[1:26:41] by faith, and then we get the reality of
[1:26:43] it. That's really the victory. Faith
[1:26:45] holds us until the victory.
[1:26:48] Faith held Abraham until Isaac was born.
[1:26:52] Faith held Jesus on the cross
[1:26:56] laid down his life until the word could
[1:26:58] raise him up again.
[1:27:00] It's the reality that's the victory. But
[1:27:02] it's faith in the word that holds us
[1:27:04] there in the moment. Amen. The spoken
[1:27:07] word holds us until the manifested word
[1:27:10] gives us victory when it's it's
[1:27:12] expressed. See, the problem is so many
[1:27:15] times we refuse the spoken word. We
[1:27:18] refuse the written word. Now, I'm not
[1:27:19] speaking to us, you know, as a church or
[1:27:21] anything like, but but I'm speaking in
[1:27:22] general. People refuse the written word,
[1:27:24] the spoken word. And when they refuse
[1:27:26] that, they refuse victory because that's
[1:27:28] where it is. That's where the victory
[1:27:30] is, is through the word of God. Amen.
[1:27:32] You can't win if you don't accept the
[1:27:33] word. You can't win if you don't accept
[1:27:35] the word. The word gives us the
[1:27:37] prescription to overcome everything in
[1:27:40] this world, especially this guy.
[1:27:43] That's where our prescription is. It
[1:27:44] lies inside the word. And I think that's
[1:27:46] why most people won't accept it. They
[1:27:48] don't want to surrender. They don't want
[1:27:49] to change. They just want the blessing.
[1:27:52] But that's not the way it works.
[1:27:53] Something has to has to be defeated for
[1:27:55] something to have victory. And it starts
[1:27:58] internally. It doesn't start with
[1:27:59] somebody else.
[1:28:01] Says this, "For God sent not his son
[1:28:02] into the world to condemn the world, but
[1:28:04] that the world through him might be
[1:28:05] saved." God values life. God wants to
[1:28:08] show mercy above all else. He that
[1:28:10] believeth on him is not condemned. But
[1:28:12] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:28:14] already because he had not believed in
[1:28:16] the name of the only begotten son of
[1:28:17] God. And this is the condemnation. He
[1:28:19] says this is what's going to condemn you
[1:28:21] in the end. That light has come into the
[1:28:23] world and men love darkness rather than
[1:28:26] light because their deeds were evil.
[1:28:30] He says, "For everyone that doeth evil
[1:28:32] hateth the light, neither cometh to the
[1:28:34] light, lest his deeds should be
[1:28:36] reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh
[1:28:39] to the light that his deeds might be
[1:28:41] made manifest that they are rotten and
[1:28:42] God. Remember what Jesus said. He said,
[1:28:44] "Be ye doers of the word and not hearers
[1:28:46] only."
[1:28:48] We come to church and we hear. It's when
[1:28:50] we go out the question is do we do?
[1:28:52] That's what God's looking for. That's
[1:28:54] the real problem. This is where true
[1:28:56] humility shows itself. Can we be
[1:28:58] corrected by the word of God to the
[1:29:00] point that it changes what we do?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing to do sometimes,
[1:29:05] isn't it?
[1:29:06] You realize you've been doing something
[1:29:08] wrong. You realize you've missed the
[1:29:09] work. You missed the mark. And the word
[1:29:11] comes forth. And the question is, will
[1:29:13] pride rise up and say, "Well, it doesn't
[1:29:15] matter.
[1:29:17] It's just one time."
[1:29:19] Or will it say, "Be it unto me.
[1:29:23] I surrender."
[1:29:27] If we can't be corrected by the light of
[1:29:30] the word of God, no matter what we say
[1:29:32] or do, we're living an evil life.
[1:29:38] Come on, church. That's it. That's it.
[1:29:41] If we cannot do it, remember what Jesus
[1:29:44] said to the parable of the two to the
[1:29:46] two sons. The father said, "Go into my
[1:29:49] vineyard and work today." And one of
[1:29:51] them said, "Yes, father, I'll do it."
[1:29:52] The other one said, "No, I won't." And
[1:29:54] then he said, "The one that said he
[1:29:55] would didn't, and the one that said he
[1:29:58] wouldn't did." He said, "Which one loved
[1:30:00] him?" They said, "The one that did it."
[1:30:04] It's the doer.
[1:30:06] Remember what brother Billy said this
[1:30:08] last weekend? He said, "You are a
[1:30:10] composite of all the decisions you
[1:30:12] make."
[1:30:15] Doers of the word receive the reality of
[1:30:18] the word. Hearers only of the word turn
[1:30:22] into religious people only. That's where
[1:30:25] you end up. No victory, lots of
[1:30:27] knowledge.
[1:30:29] Maybe lots of outward commitment, but no
[1:30:32] victory because you got to be doers to
[1:30:35] get the manifestation. You've got to
[1:30:36] apply it. You got to let it come in.
[1:30:39] Jesus says here, "Men love darkness
[1:30:42] rather than light because what they were
[1:30:44] doing was evil. And when light comes,
[1:30:46] it'll reprove you
[1:30:49] if you're doing wrong. This is the house
[1:30:52] of correction. Remember, correction is
[1:30:54] not slapping you around and giving you a
[1:30:56] spank. It's telling you right from
[1:30:57] wrong. That's why this is the corre
[1:30:59] house of correction. It shows us the
[1:31:01] true path that God wants us to walk.
[1:31:03] Amen. And so what? If you don't want to
[1:31:06] walk that path, you don't want to be in
[1:31:07] life because it will tell you you're
[1:31:08] wrong. And now you got to make a choice.
[1:31:11] And you have to obviously and clearly
[1:31:14] decide which way you're going to go.
[1:31:17] Selena was witnessing to a lady this
[1:31:18] week at the stables and and it's the
[1:31:20] first question so many people ask about
[1:31:22] people that go to church. What does your
[1:31:24] church believe about alternate
[1:31:25] lifestyles?
[1:31:27] And Selena said, "Well, that's a that's
[1:31:29] it's not a it's a hard question because
[1:31:31] you want to know if we're for or against
[1:31:32] it." She said, "But what our answer is,
[1:31:36] come as you are
[1:31:38] and let God change you into what pleases
[1:31:40] him."
[1:31:42] She said, "It's no different.
[1:31:44] Homosexuality.
[1:31:46] You can be a liar, an adulterer, a
[1:31:48] murderer, a cheater, a liar,
[1:31:52] gossiper, come on. All sorts of things.
[1:31:55] We don't care how you come in. What
[1:31:58] matters is how you go out." Amen. And so
[1:32:01] she said, "We believe in the changing
[1:32:03] power, the transformative power of God
[1:32:06] in a person's life." That's what we
[1:32:08] believe in. We are not for or against
[1:32:10] those things. We are for the
[1:32:12] transformational power of Christ. Of
[1:32:15] course, we don't believe in those
[1:32:16] things,
[1:32:18] but we're not against the sinner. We're
[1:32:19] for the word of God. We're here to give
[1:32:22] life. We're here to give mercy. We're
[1:32:24] here to give grace. So the the very call
[1:32:26] of the bride even at the end of it all
[1:32:28] is come
[1:32:30] come
[1:32:32] see a man come meet a man come as you
[1:32:35] are drink of the waters of life freely
[1:32:38] that's our call that's our gospel it's
[1:32:40] not you have to be cleaned up you have
[1:32:42] to be a certain way to come no just come
[1:32:44] and let it do the work we'll turn you
[1:32:46] into a we'll turn you into a Christian
[1:32:48] rather than just a religious person
[1:32:53] but people don't want to change. People
[1:32:55] want affirmation. That's the age we're
[1:32:57] living in. Affirmation. And guess what?
[1:32:59] The gospel of this age is not
[1:33:01] self-affirming.
[1:33:03] What is it? Look at look at the
[1:33:04] deodosian rebuke. You say you're this,
[1:33:07] this, this, and this. He says, you say
[1:33:08] you're rich and increased with goods,
[1:33:10] have need of nothing. But yet I tell
[1:33:11] you, you're wretched, miserable, poor,
[1:33:13] blind, and naked, and don't know it. And
[1:33:15] then it gives them a remedy.
[1:33:17] People don't want the remedy. They just
[1:33:19] want the affirmation. What a horrible
[1:33:21] place to be in that you see light and
[1:33:23] you say I'd rather be in darkness. You
[1:33:25] know, I was thinking about this the
[1:33:26] other day when Jesus was talking to the
[1:33:28] rich young ruler. And remember he comes
[1:33:30] running, he says, "Master," he says,
[1:33:31] "All the right things." And he says,
[1:33:33] "What must I do to have eternal life?"
[1:33:35] And Jesus starts to quote, "Love, you
[1:33:36] know, love the Lord your God with all
[1:33:38] your heart, soul, and mind and love your
[1:33:39] neighbor as yourself and honor your
[1:33:40] mother and your father." And he says,
[1:33:41] "Hey, I've done all this since I was a
[1:33:43] youth." And then the scripture says
[1:33:45] something very interesting. It says,
[1:33:47] "And Jesus beholding him loved him."
[1:33:52] And what did love do? Love said, "You
[1:33:55] lack one thing.
[1:33:58] Sell all that you have, give it to the
[1:34:01] poor, take up your cross daily, and
[1:34:04] follow me, and you'll have riches in
[1:34:06] heaven." Love went straight to what he
[1:34:10] needed to change.
[1:34:12] Light came. light Shawn personally,
[1:34:15] specifically directly into that young
[1:34:17] man's life, that sincere young man, and
[1:34:20] it said, "You only need to change one
[1:34:21] thing, bud.
[1:34:23] Just one thing." I've said this before.
[1:34:26] I pray to God he could come and say,
[1:34:27] "You only need to change one thing,
[1:34:28] John. I would love that."
[1:34:31] But yet, this man went away sorrowful
[1:34:34] because he was very wealthy and he
[1:34:37] couldn't let it go. But love gave him
[1:34:40] light and he said, "I'd rather go back
[1:34:43] to knowing
[1:34:45] to hoping I've got eternal life rather
[1:34:47] than knowing it." What a horrible place
[1:34:49] to be.
[1:34:51] Church, we want to be affirmed if we're
[1:34:53] doing something right. Absolutely.
[1:34:55] Everybody loves a pat on the back, but
[1:34:58] we ought to also want to be corrected if
[1:34:59] we're not right. Because that's the
[1:35:01] desire of a child of God's heart. Amen.
[1:35:03] That's why we come to church.
[1:35:05] This is a house to wake us up. Get our
[1:35:07] eyes open. Take away those blind spots.
[1:35:10] My wife and I, we talk so much about
[1:35:11] blind spots.
[1:35:13] You know, as a pastor, I see lots of
[1:35:16] blind spots. And you know what that
[1:35:18] tells me? I've got them.
[1:35:21] From the oldest to the youngest, we all
[1:35:24] have blind spots. And that's why we need
[1:35:26] light. That's why we need to come to
[1:35:29] church. That's why we need the preaching
[1:35:30] of the word, the hearing of the word,
[1:35:32] time spent in his presence because it
[1:35:34] shows us our blind spots and it brings
[1:35:37] light so we can get ourselves out of
[1:35:39] darkness. That's what it's supposed to
[1:35:42] do. And I'll tell you this, we're
[1:35:44] forgetful people. Scripture says we're
[1:35:47] forgetful hearers. And that's why we
[1:35:48] need it all the more today than we've
[1:35:50] ever needed it before. Because this is a
[1:35:52] time of gross darkness. We'll get into
[1:35:54] this next service. It's a time when
[1:35:56] everything's murky, gloomy.
[1:35:59] And we need bright lights. I'll tell you
[1:36:01] this, God's always got a people that's
[1:36:03] looking for his word. I marvel when I
[1:36:05] look through the scriptures and I see
[1:36:06] the way that God moves. You know,
[1:36:08] brother Mark, you talked about the the
[1:36:10] God severally picking this one and that
[1:36:12] one. You look at Rahab. You talk about
[1:36:15] the the the hand of God reaching down.
[1:36:17] This is a prostitute in a heathen nation
[1:36:20] that is under judgment by God. and he
[1:36:24] reaches down sovereignly and he picks
[1:36:26] her and her family up and he says,
[1:36:28] "There you go. Kill the rest."
[1:36:31] You look at Ruth, a Moabitis, serving a
[1:36:35] god that killed their children by
[1:36:38] putting them through the fire.
[1:36:40] And out of that, God reaches down and
[1:36:43] just pulls one
[1:36:45] daughter of God
[1:36:47] woman at the well. You talk about
[1:36:50] broken.
[1:36:51] I'm betting by that point in her life,
[1:36:53] she wasn't even allowed to go to church.
[1:36:56] Pastor got tired of her. Never listens
[1:36:59] to him. Keeps messing up the same way.
[1:37:02] She's not fit for society. She's not fit
[1:37:04] for church. She's not fit for nothing.
[1:37:06] And then what happens? The light comes
[1:37:08] her way. Digs down through the muck that
[1:37:11] she's created and pulls her out. And in
[1:37:14] a moment, she realizes, I'm a child of
[1:37:16] God. That's what light does. That's the
[1:37:19] victory that we're talking about.
[1:37:21] Remember what we read earlier that God
[1:37:22] had seeds that were planted and the
[1:37:25] light was necessary to get those seeds
[1:37:27] to produce what they are. That's what
[1:37:30] God's got us here for. Amen. They could
[1:37:32] feel the light. They could have the
[1:37:33] warmth of the light and it could do a
[1:37:35] work in their life.
[1:37:37] Jesus said it this way. The people which
[1:37:39] sat in darkness saw great light. Again,
[1:37:42] brother Mark, it reminds me of you
[1:37:43] sitting under a mushroom. You say,
[1:37:47] right? You don't know anything. This
[1:37:50] young man that came to my house, he was
[1:37:52] raised Roman Catholic. And you know
[1:37:53] what? He knew nothing. Nothing.
[1:37:58] Absolutely nothing. You know what I say?
[1:38:00] We've got to witness. That's the kind of
[1:38:02] people God goes to because they don't
[1:38:05] have anything to hold them back. I pray
[1:38:08] God's grace for the young man. For each
[1:38:10] one that we get to witness to. People
[1:38:13] which sat in darkness saw great light.
[1:38:17] And to them which sat in the region and
[1:38:19] shadow of death, light is sprung up.
[1:38:22] I'll tell you this. Rahab isn't wasn't
[1:38:26] there to hear that. But I'll tell you
[1:38:27] this. You ever read that to Rahab, she
[1:38:29] say that's me. You say that to Ruth, she
[1:38:32] say that's me. You say that to Zakius,
[1:38:35] that's me.
[1:38:39] Didn't know it until the light came.
[1:38:42] Sat in darkness.
[1:38:45] sat in the region and the shadow of
[1:38:47] death and yet light is sprung up.
[1:38:49] Church, you can't go so far that he
[1:38:51] can't reach you.
[1:38:53] You can't get so broken, so failed, so
[1:38:55] sick, so miserable, so buried that the
[1:38:57] light of God can't find you. And I love
[1:39:00] how the prophet of God talks about, he
[1:39:01] says, you get that little blade of grass
[1:39:03] to start growing, it'll crack concrete
[1:39:05] to get to light. That's the power of the
[1:39:08] light. Amen. That woman at that well had
[1:39:10] completely destroyed her life. And yet
[1:39:13] in a moment she came to a reality. I'm a
[1:39:15] daughter of God. She had no clue. That's
[1:39:18] the beauty of it. She had no clue until
[1:39:20] the light came and all of a sudden
[1:39:22] something sprung forth. Quickly that
[1:39:24] light brought her to life. She said, "Is
[1:39:26] this not the very Christ?" She went in
[1:39:29] testifying.
[1:39:31] As we start to close, Brother Brham says
[1:39:32] this. I've used this quote before, but
[1:39:34] it's such a beautiful thing. We talk
[1:39:36] about gifts. We talk about the blessings
[1:39:37] of God. This is it. He says, "The real
[1:39:39] gift is your soul down in there." See
[1:39:42] that was born of God and that controls
[1:39:44] the whole thing to the word of God and
[1:39:47] the will of God. He says and there you
[1:39:49] grow up. See then you're a son and
[1:39:52] daughter of God. You're a child of God.
[1:39:57] There was a lot of seeds sitting down in
[1:39:59] that earth when light came and then he
[1:40:02] pulled the water back and he raised the
[1:40:03] the earth up so they could start to feel
[1:40:05] that warmth. But it's when you come to
[1:40:07] life that's when you find out who you
[1:40:09] really are. Otherwise, you're just in
[1:40:11] darkness and death. There's nothing
[1:40:13] there. But when you come to life,
[1:40:15] something changes. You start to realize
[1:40:17] there's more to me than I thought there
[1:40:18] was. Amen. We so often look for change.
[1:40:23] Amen. There's things I want to change in
[1:40:24] my life. There's things I want the
[1:40:26] victory over. There's things I don't
[1:40:29] like about my personality. There's
[1:40:30] things I don't like about my first
[1:40:31] reaction. And I'm saying, Lord, help me
[1:40:33] to have that better reaction. Help me to
[1:40:35] respond the way that you do. Help me not
[1:40:38] to take things personally. help me to
[1:40:40] act in love always. Amen. But what is it
[1:40:43] that's going to do that? It is not my
[1:40:46] desire.
[1:40:48] It's going to be his presence. That's
[1:40:50] the only thing that's going to do it.
[1:40:52] It's what? When the light comes in and
[1:40:54] it brings to life the reality of Christ
[1:40:58] that he buried in me from the very
[1:40:59] beginning. That's our victory. That's
[1:41:02] what we're looking for. Amen. We don't
[1:41:04] become a child of God. We always were a
[1:41:07] child of God. You know what? We do
[1:41:09] become a Christian Christlike because
[1:41:12] that's a process. Brother Brand would
[1:41:14] say we're born a baby in Christ and then
[1:41:18] we grow into his image, into his nature,
[1:41:22] into his attributes. And in the end,
[1:41:24] what people can see is Christ in us, the
[1:41:25] hope of glory. But we don't start that
[1:41:27] way. And that's the thing. I'm in the
[1:41:29] process. Anybody else in the process
[1:41:31] this morning? Amen. Nine of us. Praise
[1:41:33] the Lord. We're in a process. And guess
[1:41:36] what? when that seed
[1:41:39] when life comes forth. I was weird. I
[1:41:42] don't know why I did this when I was
[1:41:43] young, but you know, we used to do the
[1:41:45] the napkins and you put the little uh um
[1:41:48] was it beans or peas? I think it was
[1:41:49] beans, was it? You put a bean in there
[1:41:52] and then you you you just water the
[1:41:54] napkin. It was in uh elementary school.
[1:41:57] And then you you put it in there and all
[1:41:59] you did was you put it in the in the
[1:42:01] sill of the window and the light shone
[1:42:03] on it. and water and light will cause
[1:42:06] that bean to decompose and out of that
[1:42:10] will come a sprout that would eventually
[1:42:12] produce a bean plant. I'll tell you
[1:42:14] this, call me weird, I sniffed it one
[1:42:16] time.
[1:42:18] Now, I don't know if you've ever sniffed
[1:42:20] a bean that's turning into a real plant.
[1:42:23] Guess what? It stinks. Don't do it. Not
[1:42:26] recommended. Zero stars out of five.
[1:42:30] It stinks. And you know what? When life
[1:42:34] starts, it causes a mess. It causes
[1:42:37] stinky things.
[1:42:39] Why? Because the old nature is breaking
[1:42:42] up.
[1:42:44] There's a divorce that's happening.
[1:42:45] There's a death that's happening. And
[1:42:47] when death happens,
[1:42:50] messes and stinks occur with it. And so
[1:42:53] often what we're worried about is the
[1:42:54] stinks and the messes rather than the
[1:42:55] life that's coming out of it all. And so
[1:42:58] we hold back. But we've got to go
[1:43:00] through that process. We've got to let
[1:43:01] the light do the work. to manifest
[1:43:05] what God's placed inside of our lives.
[1:43:08] That's what victory is this morning.
[1:43:09] Let's stand together. That's what
[1:43:11] victory is.
[1:43:13] We can we can stand here and we can say,
[1:43:14] "Listen, Brother John, victory is is I
[1:43:17] won't smoke and I won't drink and I
[1:43:18] won't fornicate. I won't look at bad
[1:43:20] things on my uh my phone or my computer.
[1:43:22] I won't read bad books and I'll go to
[1:43:24] church and I'll read my Bible and I'll
[1:43:26] pray." We say that's what overcoming is.
[1:43:30] That's not. Those are all good things
[1:43:33] and don't ever, you know, go against
[1:43:35] those things. But that's not what
[1:43:37] overcoming is. Overcoming is life.
[1:43:40] That's what it is. Overcoming is life.
[1:43:42] Amen. So, the real overcoming is when
[1:43:44] Christ is in you and he starts to live
[1:43:48] through you. That's what overcoming
[1:43:50] looks like. Amen. And so, your very
[1:43:52] desires are caught up now in what he
[1:43:54] wants you to do. And what happens is
[1:43:56] those things just die away. those things
[1:43:59] just fall away because you don't have
[1:44:01] time, you don't have desire, you don't
[1:44:03] have inclination, you don't have energy
[1:44:05] for it even because your life is lost
[1:44:08] inside of him. And so when that seed
[1:44:10] rots away, sometimes you say, "Well, I
[1:44:13] got the Holy Ghost. Why am I still
[1:44:14] dealing with things?" Cuz things have to
[1:44:15] rot.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Things have to die away. But I'll tell
[1:44:18] you what happens when things rot. They
[1:44:21] just become a part of the environment
[1:44:22] around you and they're gone. They're
[1:44:25] gone. And you can't even go pick them up
[1:44:26] once they're rotted. They stink for a
[1:44:28] while and they make us uncomfortable for
[1:44:30] a while. But that's just the sign of
[1:44:32] life that's coming out of yours, coming
[1:44:34] out of you. Don't worry about the stink.
[1:44:38] Say, "Lord, I see changes. Lord, I see
[1:44:40] life coming out. Lord, I've got victory
[1:44:42] in a new area this week. Lord, thank you
[1:44:44] for victory. I got a tremendous victory
[1:44:46] this week. I was so thankful for it. You
[1:44:49] know what my victory is? It's Jensen.
[1:44:53] He came to me yesterday and he didn't
[1:44:54] say anything. He just stuck his chin up
[1:44:56] like this. He had an inch and a half
[1:44:58] gash from when he fell down in church
[1:45:00] when he fainted.
[1:45:03] He couldn't talk right. He couldn't move
[1:45:05] his mouth.
[1:45:08] And in two weeks, church, a gash that
[1:45:11] showed his jaw through it, it was so
[1:45:13] deep is almost completely gone.
[1:45:17] And he's down playing hockey and he's
[1:45:19] fighting with his brother and he's
[1:45:21] running around with his dog as if
[1:45:22] nothing happened. Church, that's
[1:45:24] victory.
[1:45:25] That's victory. Praise the Lord for
[1:45:27] that. What is it? By his stripes, we are
[1:45:31] healed.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; So, what do we do with Sister Nadine
[1:45:34] now? We've got a testimony. God heals
[1:45:38] concussions.
[1:45:41] God heals cancer.
[1:45:43] God heals broken hearts.
[1:45:46] God leads. God guides. God provides.
[1:45:50] So, what do we say? The light did it
[1:45:52] before. The light can do it again. The
[1:45:54] word says it. I believe it. Lord, I'm
[1:45:56] just going to trust you and wait for it.
[1:45:58] And let let what? Victory come forth out
[1:46:01] of our faith.
[1:46:03] Scripture says, "Faith is the victory
[1:46:04] that overcomes the world." Why? Because
[1:46:07] it holds us in place until God produces
[1:46:10] the thing we've been believing. Amen.
[1:46:12] That's the victory he's looking for. I
[1:46:14] say, "Lord, help my faith to hold. Lord,
[1:46:17] help my faith to stay strong." When I
[1:46:18] can't see the spirit moving, I've got to
[1:46:20] believe that by your word, it's moving
[1:46:22] anyways. and the results are coming
[1:46:24] soon. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[1:46:28] Jesus,
[1:46:30] Lord, we're here for victory this
[1:46:32] morning.
[1:46:33] Lord, we're here for faith this morning,
[1:46:36] Lord. And I trust we can be encouraged,
[1:46:38] Lord, that as you've shown us from the
[1:46:39] beginning, light defeats darkness every
[1:46:41] time, Lord. When Satan tries to put in
[1:46:44] when the powers of the enemy come
[1:46:46] against us, Lord, when life comes at us,
[1:46:48] Lord, we've got a greater life. We've
[1:46:50] got a supernatural life. Lord, we've got
[1:46:52] an eternal life that pushes back and
[1:46:54] says, "Not today." Lord, I pray you hold
[1:46:57] us. Help us to trust you, Lord. Lord,
[1:47:00] the scripture says, "They that wait upon
[1:47:02] the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:47:04] They'll rise up with wings as eagles.
[1:47:06] They'll walk and not be weary. They'll
[1:47:08] run and they'll not faint." And then
[1:47:10] says, "Teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord,
[1:47:12] to wait." Lord, I pray you help us to
[1:47:15] strengthen ourselves in the waiting
[1:47:17] time. Lord, that the spirit of God will
[1:47:19] raise up a standard, pouring in more of
[1:47:21] your word, more of your spirit, Lord, to
[1:47:23] let us hold fast while we wait for the
[1:47:25] reality of what we believed. Lord, we
[1:47:28] believe we're an overcoming bride by
[1:47:30] your word. Lord, we believe we're a
[1:47:33] spotless, sinless bride by your blood.
[1:47:36] And Lord, we're here this morning
[1:47:37] saying, Lord, we want to have the
[1:47:38] reality of that every single day. Lord,
[1:47:41] lift our eyes a little higher. Lord,
[1:47:43] strengthen feeble knees and weary hands.
[1:47:46] Lord, help our mouth, Lord, to confess
[1:47:48] the things that you say. Lord, and let
[1:47:50] our life produce our confession. We
[1:47:51] pray. Lord, bless your people, Lord.
[1:47:54] We're missing many today, Lord. We ask a
[1:47:56] special grace to them, those that are
[1:47:57] sick, Lord. We want to remember Sister
[1:47:59] Dadine in particular. Heavenly Father,
[1:48:02] Lord, that you would reach down into her
[1:48:03] situation, Lord, with Sister Cassandra
[1:48:05] as she's helping her. Lord, may you just
[1:48:07] be with them, Lord. Give us wisdom and
[1:48:09] how to help as well. Lord, let us be
[1:48:11] your hands and feet. We pray. Lord,
[1:48:13] those that are sick as well, Lord,
[1:48:14] Sister Beverly, Brother Ron, Lord, the
[1:48:16] different ones. We pray your mercy and
[1:48:18] grace this morning. In Jesus Christ's
[1:48:20] name we ask it. Amen. Amen. Let's sing
[1:48:24] that song.
[1:48:34] He's in the house. 11:37.
[1:48:40] Little girl was lying [singing] there.
[1:48:44] The people all were weeping.
[1:48:48] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[1:48:53] she's only sleeping.
[1:48:57] As he took her by the hand, [music] she
[1:49:01] began [singing] to live again.
[1:49:05] Some began to praise [music and singing]
[1:49:07] the Lord. And some began to say,
[1:49:13] "He's in the house. [music]
[1:49:17] Death has to flee."
[1:49:20] [music]
[1:49:21] Now there [singing] is light
[1:49:24] where darkness used [music] to be.
[1:49:29] Now there is hope.
[1:49:33] There's no more doubt. [singing]
[1:49:35] [music]
[1:49:37] Praise his name.
[1:49:41] Oh, praise [music and singing] his name.
[1:49:45] He's in the house.
[1:49:50] [music]
[1:49:51] We were like [singing] that little girl
[1:49:55] dead in all our sins.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus touched this heart of mine and
[1:50:03] gave me life again. [music]
[1:50:07] I am just a house of clay. [music]
[1:50:11] But ever since that blessed day,
[1:50:15] there's a light that shines in me
[1:50:18] [music] for all the world to see.
[1:50:21] [singing]
[1:50:23] He's in the house. [music]
[1:50:27] Death has to flee.
[1:50:31] Now there is light. [music]
[1:50:34] Where darkness used to be.
[1:50:39] Now there is [music] hope.
[1:50:43] There's no more doubt.
[1:50:47] Praise [music] his name.
[1:50:50] Praise [singing] his name. [music]
[1:50:54] He's in the house.
[1:50:59] [music]
[1:51:01] We were like that little girl dead in
[1:51:05] all our sins.
[1:51:08] Till Jesus [music] touched this heart of
[1:51:11] mine and gave me life again. [music]
[1:51:17] I am just a house away.
[1:51:20] But ever since [music] that blessed day,
[1:51:25] there's a light that shines in me for
[1:51:28] all [music] the world to see.
[1:51:32] He's in the house. [music]
[1:51:36] Death has to flee.
[1:51:40] Now there is light
[1:51:44] where darkness used to [music] be.
[1:51:48] Now there is hope.
[1:51:52] There's no more doubt. [music]
[1:51:56] Praise his name.
[1:52:00] Praise [music]
[1:52:01] his name.
[1:52:04] He's in the house.
[1:52:08] Death [music] has to flee.
[1:52:12] Now there is light [music]
[1:52:15] where darkness used to be.
[1:52:19] Now there [singing] is hope.
[1:52:23] There's [music] no more doubt.
[1:52:27] Praise his name.
[1:52:31] Praise his [music] name.
[1:52:35] He's in the house.
[1:52:39] [music]
[1:52:41] The little girl was lying there. The
[1:52:44] [music] people are weeping.
[1:52:49] They just laughed at [music] Jesus when
[1:52:52] he said she's only sleeping.
[1:52:57] And as he took her by the [music] head,
[1:53:01] she began to live again. [music] Some
[1:53:05] began to praise his name. Some began to
[1:53:10] say, [music and singing]
[1:53:12] "He's in the house.
[1:53:16] Death has to flee.
[1:53:20] Now there [music and singing] is light.
[1:53:23] Where darkness used to be,
[1:53:28] now there [music] is hope,
[1:53:31] there's no more doubt.
[1:53:35] Praise his name.
[1:53:39] [music] Praise his name.
[1:53:43] He's in the house [music]
[1:53:46] where death has to flee.
[1:53:51] Now there is [music and singing] light
[1:53:54] where darkness used to be.
[1:53:58] Now there is hope.
[1:54:02] There's [music] no more doubt.
[1:54:06] Praise his name.
[1:54:10] Praise his [music]
[1:54:12] name.
[1:54:14] He's in the house.
[1:54:18] Death has to [music] flee.
[1:54:22] Now there [singing]
[1:54:23] is light
[1:54:25] where [music] darkness used to be.
[1:54:29] Now there is hope.
[1:54:33] There's [music] no more doubt. [singing]
[1:54:37] Praise his name.
[1:54:41] Praise his [music] name.
[1:54:45] He's in the house.
[1:54:53] You look at that story in the scripture.
[1:54:56] Gyrus says, "Lord, my daughter's sick.
[1:54:59] Will you come heal her?" Jesus says,
[1:55:01] "I'll go."
[1:55:03] They're on the way there. And on the way
[1:55:05] there, he's interrupted by a woman with
[1:55:08] a blood issue.
[1:55:11] She's healed.
[1:55:13] And he says, "It's according to your
[1:55:15] faith that you got that." Then they
[1:55:18] continue on the way. And the servant
[1:55:20] comes and he says to Gyrus, he says,
[1:55:22] "Your daughter's dead. Don't bother him
[1:55:24] anymore."
[1:55:26] You know what Jesus said?
[1:55:29] Jesus said, "Be not afraid, only
[1:55:32] believe."
[1:55:33] She's dead, dark,
[1:55:37] beyond hope,
[1:55:40] lifeless. He says, "Be not afraid, only
[1:55:44] believe."
[1:55:45] He said elsewhere, "If thou can't
[1:55:47] believe, all things are possible."
[1:55:50] And that we've been praying for a lot of
[1:55:52] things. I think this is the year I've
[1:55:54] prayed more than ever.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That's a good thing. means I'm going to
[1:55:58] the right place. But I'll tell you this,
[1:55:59] church. We're facing situations that
[1:56:01] haven't moved.
[1:56:03] We're facing hardships, lost ones,
[1:56:07] brokenness,
[1:56:08] besetting sins,
[1:56:11] people that can't seem to get the
[1:56:13] victory,
[1:56:14] and it seems hopeless.
[1:56:17] I say this this morning, be not afraid,
[1:56:21] only believe. And then you hold fast to
[1:56:23] what God has said. Let him do the work.
[1:56:27] I was listening to brother Steven Coffee
[1:56:29] just briefly this morning preaching to
[1:56:31] brother Aaron Mciris and he was saying
[1:56:33] you know there's a work we've got to do
[1:56:35] and that's a we've got to resist
[1:56:38] and that's a flesh work that's a natural
[1:56:41] resistance that's a a mental resistance
[1:56:44] but it's got to be by the spirit that we
[1:56:45] overcome
[1:56:47] sometimes that's the problem is we're
[1:56:48] trying to do it all instead of letting
[1:56:50] him do it in us we resist it's him that
[1:56:53] makes the devil flee if thou can't

[2:04:46] Right, brother Bob. I guess you're
[2:04:47] helping to close in prayer after this is

[2:04:52] Once [music]
[2:04:54] my heart and soul were bit [music]
[2:05:00] by the [singing] binding chains of
[2:05:04] [music] sin,
[2:05:08] but the great emancipator,
[2:05:12] [music]
[2:05:16] he set
[2:05:18] me free to worship him.

[2:06:04] Oh, so helpless [music and singing] and
[2:06:08] alone.
[2:06:12] But [music]

[2:06:18] me and he led me to [music] my father's
[2:06:24] home.
[2:06:26] Oh, singing glory, [music] glory,
[2:06:31] hallelujah.
[2:06:35] and blessed
[2:06:37] be his [music] holy name.
[2:06:44] He the great [music]
[2:06:46] emanator.
[2:06:51] [music]
[2:06:51] That's the song of the redee.
[2:06:59] Oh, once [music]
[2:07:01] my heart and soul were mered
[2:07:07] by [music]
[2:07:08] the binding [singing]
[2:07:10] chains of sin,
[2:07:14] [music]
[2:07:15] but the great man,
[2:07:20] [music]
[2:07:22] he said, "Be greater worship him.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; [music]

[2:07:53] And that's the song of the Sing it one
[2:07:57] more time. [music]
[2:07:59] I'm singing glory,
[2:08:02] glory, [singing]
[2:08:04] hallelujah, [music]

[2:08:28] [music]
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father,
[2:08:36] how we thank you Lord, Father, for the
[2:08:39] salvation, Lord, that you've wrought in
[2:08:41] each and every one of us. And Father,
[2:08:44] you are the great emancipator as we just
[2:08:46] sang. We once Lord were living in
[2:08:48] darkness and now Lord we live in light
[2:08:52] and in a world that's so dark with a
[2:08:54] gross darkness about us and as the
[2:08:57] scripture said Lord way back
[2:09:00] father there was light in goan but by
[2:09:02] grace lord the bright is in goan tonight
[2:09:05] and father today we're believing lord
[2:09:07] that father we walk in light by the
[2:09:09] grace of god one day at a time one step
[2:09:12] at a time father following that light
[2:09:14] lord and knowing father that very soon,
[2:09:17] Lord, we'll step into that eternal
[2:09:19] light, Lord. Father, by the by by virtue
[2:09:21] of the rapture. And we pray, Lord, that
[2:09:24] you'd just help us to continue to feed
[2:09:26] upon the word of God. For as it is
[2:09:29] written, every word of God is pure. And
[2:09:32] that, Lord, you're a shield to those
[2:09:34] that will put our trust in you. So,
[2:09:36] Father, help us, Lord, to realize that
[2:09:38] this is not just two services a week,
[2:09:41] but Father, by grace, it's a it's a
[2:09:43] communion. And it's a daily communion
[2:09:45] with you, Lord, feeding upon the things,
[2:09:47] Lord, that that matter most to us, Lord.
[2:09:51] So bless each one of us, Father, today
[2:09:53] with greater revelation, Father, greater
[2:09:55] understanding in your word and a closer
[2:09:57] walk with you. So bless us, Lord, we
[2:10:00] pray as we go, Father, today. May your
[2:10:02] peace and your presence be with us. May
[2:10:04] we be our shield and our buckler,
[2:10:06] Father, to keep the enemy away, Lord, by
[2:10:08] grace. May you bless brother John, Lord,
[2:10:10] and help him, Father, to Lord, by grace
[2:10:13] continue to dig into that word and bring
[2:10:15] it to us, Father, because Lord, that's
[2:10:18] what is setting us free. That is, Lord,
[2:10:20] that transforming power that was spoken
[2:10:22] of today, Father, that transforming
[2:10:24] power working from within.
[2:10:27] So Lord, we just pray that you'd
[2:10:29] minister to the needs that were
[2:10:31] mentioned before. We remember again
[2:10:33] sister Naen Lord and Sister Cassandra
[2:10:36] Father the needs that were expressed
[2:10:37] there that young man Lord Father that is
[2:10:40] seeking truth. We just pray Father that
[2:10:42] you would open his heart and Father by
[2:10:44] grace guide him Lord to to the place
[2:10:47] Father where he can have a relationship
[2:10:48] with you. So bless him Lord we pray.
[2:10:51] Father all those others that were sick
[2:10:53] and afflicted those that weren't here
[2:10:55] father we just pray that you would
[2:10:56] minister to each one. Bring them all
[2:10:58] back safely and in good health. We pray
[2:11:01] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
