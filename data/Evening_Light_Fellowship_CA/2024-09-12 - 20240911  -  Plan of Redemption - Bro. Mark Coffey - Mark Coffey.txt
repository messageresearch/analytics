aren't with us Lord we just ask those that have needs in Jesus name amen amen Let's uh let's just read the word there before you sit down uh just turn to Revelation 21 and we just read verse 1 to5 just welcome we all here tonight Revelation 21 1:5 if we're all there we're not on the screen okay sorry about that is it there and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I have I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful amen wonderful you may be seated at this time so just to uh introduce myself again after many years I haven't been up here since uh not here last time it's said 19 no 2020 and uh in the old church and uh as you know I used to kind of uh uh come in behind when brother Gerald is wasn't with us and to minister and uh he's not here tonight I know he's away so uh so I uh and I stepped down uh for uh health reasons uh was one reason and for what I was going through with the heart episodes and uh and also just to we were in a change over at the time and the younger people were coming in and the older people were starting to move out of these and you see the changes were with brother Jonathan and you know uh Brother Joseph and the Deacon role and brother Matthew and and you know that's what was happening and and it was a good time for someone younger to come in to fill in brother brother Paul was doing the Sunday school so it was a natural progression for him to come in and uh to uh uh sub substitute in when he needed to so that was the the the logic of that right so I didn't need to really get up anymore but uh so for this time so what are you doing up here uh so you know I just uh felt uh just LED at this time and and the health has been better thank God and these things so I I uh I have improved and I'm thankful so I'm gonna try to get to this here uh I I do lean to prophecy of course I like that and I like the Book of Revelation done a lot of we've done a lot of studies on that and things that you know the reason why things happen and the the you know what why things happen the way they do and what's the process that God has and things like that and trying to pick through those things and it's always uh uh a good thing for me so um and I do use a teaching method here you know I was Sunday school for years and years and that's what we used to do was teach so this is just carried on and here and I do it through a presentation and that's mostly so people look up there probably right it's mostly a reason and this will this will look at uh tonight we're just going to look at Revelation again and uh I've gone into uh a an an area uh and it comes from future home uh and I say future home PA of the Heavenly uh the long title but I just shortened it there just for space on the slides but it's a very uh uh going through it it's it's very uh you know what you would call intense message if there's a lot of things in there and a lot of layers and brother Braham didn't dabble around he he didn't go off not he or anything like that he didn't come for anything but to uh really get down to the plan of God so that's what he was doing so uh I didn't realize how much until I uh started to look into it the layers of it right I I'm I'm going to take one section here of it that's all Just one thought going through it so it'll be uh but there's so much more in that message the future home and it's a wonderful message definitely one of a key message and and harvest time which is preached right after that uh in December of of 64 also uh he he touches on a lot of the same ideas so two of them are kind of connected uh so we'll look we'll try to look at you know we try to look at what God how he does things how he's carrying out his plan and how what he's done and what he's doing and what he's going to do so it's just trying to get an eye around that and uh there would be uh there would be no uh no uh explanation at all without a prophet it took a prophet uh to do the think and uh in this last uh you know as a son of man as a prophet Ministry uh you know these are the things we see pivotal things happen like when when uh Paul came he he needed a profit because it was a change we were making a turn and brother BR often talked about the wall and going in a straight line and and you know that wasn't really uh the ministry of a prophet that was a a messenger in the age could do that but when it came to the to changing God would send a prophet and uh certainly uh it was certainly required in uh in Paul's day and for what he did and it was huge you know in terms of uh what we're reading in the Bible and uh getting us ready for that all that period and brother BR was the same way and he had so many roles in Malachi 4 and as the messenger in lead DEA and as the as the one to get the bride ready for Christ and you know there was uh you know just so many things roles that he had to play there uh the last time and for ending closing down really the Gentiles and uh getting getting this ready to be passed over to the to the Jews so he had a lot of layers there and and also a gift of Min uh healing that uh was you know used right out for all his ministry so he was certainly busy and had a lot to do there and you can see his uh such an important role in in uh in his work today don't don't mind it's emotional part of me I think a lot of it is uh it's been since the uh medications you know I think they affect me like that but uh hopefully it'll pass here uh so let's just uh let's just turn into uh the scripture here at the next slide uh Luke 2 2538 so if we it's just a bit long but we'll just uh go through this is familiar and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into to the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up into his arms and blessed God and said Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for thine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of f fenel of the tribe of azer she was of great age and had lived with an husband s years from her virginity and she was Widow of about 4 score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming to that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spoke unto him to all them that looked for redemption in Israel very very uh familiar scripture but just so so beautiful of scripture so uh so in the I should get the uh guer I'm forgetting all of it sorry bear with me I was waiting for them to change it so so here uh in this in this uh it's a very familiar scripture and if we saw this before in years past but we just go down to it now the it's from a perfection in 1956 and uh it says and now the great chain of perfection has was was broken by time space time came because of sin so let's draw a picture at this time let's see A Perfect Circle forever and ever and then all at once sin dropped in and put a put a little as my wife calls it a little hickey this is a fellow from Kentucky uh or a little drop in the chain so it comes down now eternity continues on but it's not in its perfect condition so we've seen this before this uh picture and I'm sure you're you're used to it here but uh this is how brother brandom is going to go in and explained about the plan of God and how God went about it so here and and then all at once s Dr dropped in and put a little as my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop in the chain so it comes down now and it eternity continues but it's not in its perfect condition so we see this this uh uh fall this eternity is going on and then then uh uh because of the Garden of Eden and what happened in the Garden of Eden God had it all perfect and there was sin in the garden and it had to be dealt with and God could have sin in eternity he could not be in there with that so this is what he did he dropped this down and this is really just this this was going to be time and that marked out by the Old Testament and New Testament so this is the whole es of time and this is where we are now we are in Time and Eternity is still there it's still going on but it's but as he said eternity continues but it's not in its perfect condition and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the loss that God by his Sovereign Grace May someday lift that little hickey or Gap back into the perfect circle so after time is completed it is just drawn right back up and it's just it goes on as the perfect circle very simple time so as we go on time now time is this little Loop that Loops down Jes Jesus from eternity to Eternity but he stepped into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it with God again for all eternity you see it right so we see so we see this and brother brandham explains as time is a shadow and I couldn't Shadow it for some reason I just couldn't make that gray just to shap it was it was a certain shape but we live just imagine but it's a gray area and if if and and you should be able to uh you know identify with that as being in a gray area we we were we are gray about it now in this age you know it's because of the the sevens and uh uh brother Lonnie explained uh Lonnie Jenkins he explained sevens and he said that really we go through these sevens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even and what Whatever It Is God doesn't really explain it until we get into the seventh so if you're talking about church ages we we didn't know anything about the church ages and what the whole overall picture was until the 7th and it takes a prophet to come in and do this and God will bring down a prophet in the seven so if you look at seven trumpets seven trumpets BR Bram didn't have a a view of the seven trumpets because it wasn't his time and it wasn't the seventh we don't go into the seventh until Revelation 11 11 is when the SE the Jews go through the seven trumpet which is just as significant the trumpets and the seals is just as significance to each group and the seventh and the seventh is just as significant but it's in those seventh that everything gets gets uh uh explained to the Believers right and it would be to the redeemed to the ones that could receive the Holy Ghost who are going to receive that from that from that uh revelation it's not there there's a whole group of people that are saved under the you know under under this destru destruction there's a whole group that's right but then there's the redeemed and the redeemed can receive the holy spirit amen those saved under destruction cannot they will have to go through in in our era they'll have to go through through the tribulation in order to be given eternal life they they won't receive it like the uh the or and there will be you know the the foolish virgins and there will be you know the 144,000 they they don't go that way and then there's the uh different ones you know through the the ages that God has and he has a plan for all of this right he has a plan for us he has a plan for all of us he's a mastermind for all of this and he has it all planned out every inch of it and we don't have to worry about it's going to happen so so in this uh uh so these we're seeing now that and it's the first time if you look at the Book of Revelation it's the first time because uh it was open to Paul Paul Paul uh could see those things because uh it was closed with John so it must have been open because it existed and B quotes it right back to Genesis he talks about the the uh the the word like that and so uh once it got sealed up then it was it was uh it was just a darkness really uh and uh it was it was noted by the Messengers that went through but Paul went off the scene and then John went for two years and did the Book of Revelation but it was only Mysteries to him he he didn't understand there was they he they use symbols and things in Revelations and Paul didn't John didn't know everything it was he was blinded to a lot of things he didn't he didn't know a lot of what was going on and it went for 2,000 years and it's only in this this age that uh it was opened up to the bride so that we were're able to see it which is a wonderful thing so so the bride just in this little period of time are the ones that uh are given the knowledge of the uh all all the things in the Book of Revelation other things that go to the Jews and that that aren't into the seventh so not all of it is there but in terms of the trumpets you know uh brother brandom could see the fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet because it happened in the 19th century and when first world war and second world war and when the Jews were all taken away so he knew that but he didn't know really he could make guesses about it and things but he didn't really know what the seven Trump was because it wasn't his ministry and that'll be done for the two prophets that come with the 144,000 and we know that and has nothing to do with us we'll be gone by then it'll all be over for us so so in in in this in this case here in this picture there was eternity and it was all set up with Adam and Eve but Adam and Eve sinned and they this this Loop this hickey as he calls it falls down and this is this is where we saw time starting to happen and this is where where sin was it was all sin and and God himself he couldn't be in there he does come in body in in a in a form He's Able he has done it right from Genesis that if you take like MDC or someone like that he could go into that body but he could never as himself God himself come down unless he was in a body and protected from that that sin environment and he did that and that was all revealed in this uh in this age all that was that was never known that that's the way God is and the people you know in the in the uh denominational world would make it out to three gods and try to figure it out how it was happening by having different numbers of gods one two three whatever but uh we understand that it was God in a form coming down in different different ways in all through those times and saw it in with Moses or saw it with Joshua or saw all that God appearing into those to those prophets and and ministers in a different form but it was really Christ coming down so so so we're getting at to the point is we know if we look at that in terms of time we're almost at the end of time we're getting to the end of Eternity where we will be going back into eternity and uh uh we'll see it ending up although time as we know goes to the end of the Millennium there's still time to the end of the Millennium right so we we'll we'll get into that a little bit after but I think we all know that we still in time in Millennium and and it's after the Millennium when there's a holy convocation and that's what I'll be going into here is talking about the Holy convocation and the burning that'll happen at that time and at the at the time also before the new heavens and new earth so we'll look at that shortly so so we know that you know we're coming up to the end we see all the signs of the end we've seen s more we see you know the days of Noah the days of the of lot all happening these two never before all two of them happened at the one time and you can't deny it it's it's not even a revelation anymore to see what's going on in the world so it's going to happen and also with the nuclear war you can see it's all building up for an Annihilation there's going to be it uh they they know that it can destroy the world uh with the number that you know the the countries have of nuclear weapons and it's well able to bring that Atomic cleansing that it that the world is going to get uh at at the time of the uh the the Rapture the first resurrection and uh and then it'll go into armagedon and they know that what the Bible says about that but they're still going to do it anyway there's no way of stopping it it's all going to happen so these this is the way it's going to be so in here in time and it's like a shadow and brother he uses uh in a number of places he he uh talks about this in terms of a camera film and he talks about a a negative and he Compares that shadow that Darkness to a negative it's a it's not a clear picture you know the real the the the clear picture is in eternity that's where the clear picture is where if you look at photography and you got a slide a slide and you got the picture one is clear and that's up here in reality where it's clear and then the other one when it's a shadow where it's a it's it's really a it's it's just a negative of uh really what's in there and it's only temporary and it's going to go is there a long time but God God takes his time and he he uh is he's in no rush oh I got a point over there I can't see that back there so just a couple of quotes here uh and I I want to bring your just a good few quotes in here just to let you know and I want to bring you conscious of that before we approach further this is Harvest time is just after the uh message uh uh for the future home before we approach further that God is in this room the author of the word is here amen so it doesn't it it doesn't matter how you are dressed or what degree you live in Life or what kind of a home you live in or what type of a car you drive or how much education you've got God looks at your heart and he looks in my heart and we're judged from our heart not even our words our heart judges us from the heart speaketh the mouth if it isn't it's hypocrisy that's a big statement right that he doesn't look at the actions here he looks at your desires he looks at your your heart and he's looking at at that that eternity you so you're in that you're you're up there you were an attribute of God I get this I'm getting ahead of myself but you're an attribute of God and you you were always with God if you're Eternal you are always with God that's right you know it's not like you can be made later if you're Eternal you've always you always were so in that Eternal Circle you're an attribute of God you're a a thought of God he used and that that will manifest itself eventually upon the Earth he will manifest all of that and it it'll manifest in the time now it will go to time because it'll be born through a woman so it'll have to it'll be under the original sin so it will have to be in that time area it can't be in with God himself it can't be in there because there can be no sin there and so that's how because of the the what happened in the Garden of Eden and I'm not I I wasn't going to bring in any of that because brother John's been doing that now the last while so we got a good uh you know fresh understanding of that but all all that after the original sin and what Adam and Eve didn't they were taken and and put in this Loop this time and that's where they existed and Adam not like Christ but he could couldn't get himself out of this so he was in that he was in time just like we're in time so everyone that's born and then from that seed you know it will be in that time until God God moves and uh sets it all back again into eternity and that's what we're going to look at so when the so to move on here now in this room now is coming human beings forms of human beings passing through here from all around the world voices singing in this room right now we heard brother man say this before and he's talking about in this case he's talking about television in our age but you see you are only limited in your s your senses to a certain percent of sight but now you can take the crystal or the tube or whatever it's in the television and turn it on and with the set that could deviate that on those either waves and deviate that to condense it into a channel and pick up those people someone in Australia South Africa or where India or whatever it may be and but of course but Bram could see this all the time he could he could see things in this other dimension because of the gift he had as a prophet right that's what he could see many times in his discernment so we didn't and even ourselves you know we have those experience with that where we can touch that Eternal part you know there's things that are open you can see it it comes it comes uh and manifests in some way to you sometimes and of course as a prophet he could almost live in that he could he could see he could go back and he could go ahead and that's where he was as is in that Eternal Circle right so it's a real thing and we know it's real right then it got to be somewhere hid from our eyes that same thing is passing through here now it passed through here when Abraham heard God say look up towards the star I said this is significant because Adam Abraham didn't have TV in his day you know he had the mechanism for it but they never had invented any of that yet so it wasn't there and Abraham he could see he could see things in that Dimension right that's right so he could he knew that there was things going in there he heard God say look up towards the star and it was here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it was here all of this was here when Adam was here but they just now discovered it really they Now understand it it's a scientific thing but to them but it was always there and we know it was there you can read it like you know Jacob you know with Jacob's letter he could see that that ladder and at the entrance into that Eternal Circle that heavens and he could see Angels going up and down and to see things like that because he had that gift right and like on Mount Transfiguration you know uh you know mo uh Peter and those they could see all those things that was going on that was that was all part of that Eternal thing so there was always a it was a very a busy thing uh always going back and forth between these two two Dimensions to two Realms or really Realms right is that we got here I should have I should had another one here so I think I clicked off but one more uh paragraph there and so God here and the angels and someday it will be just as much reality as television or anything else is because the spirit will bring us into that Immortal Life then we'll understand so then we are speaking from his word so is saying that we're going to be we're going to be seeing that as you know you know live it's not going to be a shadow to us anymore we're not going to be in the shadow we're not going to be in time it's going to move on that's what brother saying here in the end so it's it's pretty it's pretty uh there not real light stuff light stuff here then God here in at this the last one of the Harvest time then God after Adam had fell Tried by the word and fell but God continued in his creation to find a man who would live every word he was looking for someone who could redeem redeem the world right now look he tried to find a man that is lived the word for his age now you see God scattered his word out because he could so I I don't really have much time here I'm going to have to skip some of this but so he said just s he said Just Surrender and let the holy Holy Spirit come inside he will make you want to serve God and he will make you to to he will make it a joy to surrender to the things of the world now you'll be tempted In the Flesh you know your soul will be saved your soul will be converted but the flesh is never never converted we know that right the the flesh will always be the same way until if you have to die here before the Rapture or where up to the Rapture it'll still be fighting with that spirit right we all know that now now you you'll still be tempted in the flesh but now you'll actually have the ability to deny it I call that freedom when I have the ability it doesn't mean it'll always do it James said that there was no temptation taken you but such as is common to man so let's be Sons and Daughters of God and let's be rugged right in this a so with with you could see the change in the realm because the two Realms because you can you can look at the you can follow say example Abraham and you can look at what happened in Abraham's life and he made mistakes right and they all did and that's what brother Braham is saying there and there that you know he was looking for someone but they someone always made mistakes whether it was you know it was Abraham or it was Moses or you know it was Jacob or uh uh you know any any one any one of those job or anybody there was no one that didn't fall and make mistake or did did something that you know that was would certainly take him out of that Perfection kind of Realm right but then if you you know I'm just saying that if you just go over and look at Hebrews though so you're looking here in Old Testament where you're still in time but now you're over in the New Testament where we'll see we we move into another realm in the Old Testament at the day of Pentecost but here in Hebrews in chapter 11 we see all the saints there and they're talked about and it talks about Abraham and we know what Abraham did in the Old Testament you know and the you know the things that happened when he left you know the promised land and went down into those thing and Saul tried to sell his wife and all that kind of things but here in Hebrews 11 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out of out of a place which he should have received for in inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the ears with him of the same promise for he looked for a city that which had which ha foundations whose bilder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised see it's like we said before God is God is looking at the heart right he's looking at the heart of Abraham and all of those Saints and he's not looking at the mistakes he doesn't judge them by that he doesn't even see it he all he sees is what that part that's that's in the in eternity that was there in the beginning Abraham is never going to be lost Sarah is never going to be lost right God is always just going to look at them at for what they they uh they did what their heart's desire was and that was to serve God so you see that right through in Hebrews 11 and there it was and I didn't click it maybe I'm just too long away from the clicker so last time if you remember you probably don't but we talked about the feast we talked about the feast and look remember remember wait just I'll give you a second yeah that's right that's right that's right you know so we looked at the feast and U and and they did they did this and it's a important thing it was important uh uh you know it just showed the plan of God so so vivid and the things that he was going to do and he needed to fulfill on this Earth and uh and Christ was the one to to come but uh he had to go through things so, 1600 years uh under the law that they did this you know after Abraham's time 1600 times they did this so they just kept doing it was a yearly process and they kept going around doing you know the Feast of Passover and the unleavened bread and then first fruits Pentecost trumpets you know un the atonement and then Tabernacles so they did that every year oh finished another year finished another year but at some point someone comes and does this and who's able to fulfill this right so it doesn't have to be done again that the they'll come and it will be you know they'll you know they'll redeem back All Mankind through this process and they'll never have to do it again if one thing if a thing is fulfilled they don't have it to do they don't have to do it over Jesus didn't have to do it over again Jesus didn't have to go to Calvary and do it again it was done it was finished now you do something different so the Jews never got to that here right they went 1600 if they kept go 16001 16002 and they're probably still doing it today probably a thousand different ways right but they didn't have to do it and Peter and them knew that they were Jews they had done it the year before and they're saying whoa this is done we don't have to do this anymore so what what was in the New Testament and in the acts is what is what the Jews were supposed to do right when they saw this fulfilled by Christ when he comes but they missed it why they were blinded and we know that so that's that's uh what we went into last time just going through that and it this is is still going ahead we see those uh here there was 60 time and God comes and fulfills the Feast of the Lord the Leviticus 23 23 forever once and for all time Jews don't know that but we know that we didn't it didn't have to be done again Jesus didn't have to go to Calvary he didn't have to shed blood anymore he didn't have to do that anymore it was once for all right so in here after this though if we look at this in over uh you know the the thousands of years this were going on during this time in in the in with the feast in between in this area of seven months when there was there was uh uh quite before they came into the fall Feast here in the the first one being the trumpets so we see the church ages and then the first seal during those first two ages and then the second the third and fourth age and the second seal and the fifth and sixth and then in the third seal we've brother R covered that all we all know that very well and then leod deia and then that in the four seal going on to the fifth seal the sixth and the seventh and we're into the seventh and the seventh is a wonderful seal it's a wonderful wonderful everything is open we know it now we can see it there's things that are just manifesting and there's things that are being interpreted now you I mean you just never knew before right and I had one uh thing here and I had a couple of things that I going to have to skip it over but some of the things that just right through the whole history of the Bible and it was never known and now is known and is known to us in our generation right it's a it's a wonderful thing especially all these things in Revelation so here brother bandam in uh in the future home he does talk about loo and he he's at the end and and all the things that Through the Ages and like these things like uh you know the the word and and uh you know all the different U conditions that we have uh this was the age when they were going to be loosed and he used the word quite a bit so I was just running through just a couple of uh uh quotes here from the future home he says when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's changed he's a changed person he has been changed from what he was to what he is but he's not annihilated you know what I mean it might say new heavens and the new Earth but they're not new heavens and they're not new Earth they're just they're just uh changed you know that's what happens in in here so he's just kind of uh uh clarifying this so Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19:28 now he said to them you'll sit with me in my father's Kingdom regenerated you see change when you're you're changed he used the same word in Matthew 19:18 it says and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and just shown quickly here my got go to this side and he used the same word when he said to the cult said loose the cult and let him go he said the same thing as the at the resurrection of Lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go so it's all the same word being used the Greek word what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan in this age right in this last time amen it'll be loose it'll be loose it'll be loose from politics and all that corruption it'll be loose from denominational religious systems and to be used in the kingdom of God to be established here on the earth so it's a time of loosing that's what he's trying to put across and it was a and it was a long there talked about from the Lexicon regeneration it was New Birth reproduction renewal Recreation everything would begin with a regeneration hence renovation regeneration the production of a new life consecrated to God and I think you get the idea so that's what happens is is that all of this changes and we change right it's not a new no you know all this is destroyed then you know it's it's new it's it's all changed and that's the same for all of God's uh attributes and we're an attribute of God and the Earth is an attribute of God the the Earth was in God's thoughts right at the beginning we see that in in the fifth seal right it's a thing is going to be redeemed and changed over it's not going to be annihilated destroyed and a new one created it's going to be the same one regenerated so that's the point so here in the uh Feast of trumpets and it's a very familiar scripture and we see we're talking about loosing things being loosed and he says while this group down here has got 2,000 years bound at the river you frates and has been bound for 2,000 years also the church has has bound the Holy Ghost that's true right because it was all mixed up you know the Holy Ghost was just uh very uh uh used it wasn't in its full strength at all you know because it it was it was you know it was covered with denominational thinking and change and you just can't do that through the word and expect to have the fullness of the Holy Ghost is not going to happen right so you might have some portion uh but you know you're not going to have the fullness so the church that's down to the ages also the church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under martydom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of manmade systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back and that's what the Bible says said and that's what what we saw on this day another thing we saw is the word was loosed right it came to its fullness it's the first time ever it came to its fullness Paul and them did experience some of it but it didn't go on because sin came into the church and all different things then came into the churches and it all got corrupted and we all know the story there but and then it just went into the ages and it just died right out into Catholic Church coming along in all these different denominations right into you know the the age of the ox where was almost a wipe out of the whole church right but this this is what happened so just uh further down there it said the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it and it's happening right so the word was loosed with the Seven Seals being open it was loose fully there was no bind to it at all it was the fullness of and then it's the fullness of the Holy Ghost to to the people so we you know you you see it uh you so you see it Through the Ages right true there's always when God is moving and we see these different periods and we just happen to be in a very important one and when you see it saying Moses and Moses had this big you know these all these uh signs and wonders and everything and you know it it just happens with every one of these ages it happens and then with Moses they got into the desert and then it got then all the you know it got rough right you know it gets rough and you see it with with a uh you know uh you know when they first see you know some Israelites killed and and things like that so you know it it gets it gets harder it's not like the signs and wonders days that they had when in the desert in Egypt that they had in the desert and then Joshua comes along and they have you know the city and going around the city and that collapses and this big thing you know it's obvious and they see God happening but after that they didn't have anything like that it didn't happen right and that goes right on through the ages like in jesus' time he has all these Miracles and everything but then it gets get down to the grudge right you get down into the uh you know you're persecuted and you're hated and D it's gone it's no more and the same with the the book of Acts uh you know with Peter and and those people they saw great Miracles but it wasn't long before it happened and in our age we see it in all the church ages and in Pentecostal ages see the big Pentecostal uh CH things that were going on but then it quickly came into denomination came into Grudge you know they just just you know having trouble with everything on every side you know and then it's a time to for maturity then right that's when the tests come and all those things but there's always this this this display this manifestation of God coming on the scene to do something at the at the beginning of that time that period that interval where God was going to move on the scene and we saw it in brother bram's day for sure you saw all of in the great healing meetings that he had and it went on and on and on and then it stopped right he went into second pole first poll and second pole and third pole so it changed and that's that's right up through but then our age we saw it wasn't that thing you didn't see those signs and wonders and things that was gone that that happened you're not going to see that again right you might see a small manifestation of it that he talks about but really what you saw back in B that's over the next one that's going to see it is Israel right Israel's going to see it the 144,000 they'll see a big spectacular demonstration for a little while before it all starts to shut down so that's that's a common between there right we all know we all see that from the pattern of the word right and just get this to turn so here in the future home so we see here in rev and I mentioned it here and in three and it says and this is when it's all finished right so we've seen the Earth cleared it's regenerated and God God himself and the loop is gone on the bottom is gone that's gone back up and it's only now eternity it's only the circle in Revelation 21 that's what we see and I heard a great voice of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with man man with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself this is not God in any kind of covering he doesn't have any other other he's not coming down as a a a soldier or as in Joshua days you know it's never like that anymore he comes down God himself shall be with them and be their God but he he he can only he can't come down to the to the time realm he can't come down like that God himself he can only stay up there where there's no sin but he can you know like mzc he can take on a body and he can be inside there in his in Holiness and he spoke this body into existence and it and he can go into uh into the time realm and he does many many many times through this and we've learned this in in this age so here in future home he says now notice this little germs all darkness and things so this at the stage now is like how is God going to do this how is he going to how's he going to get all this back back into uh uh the right place again what is the plan going to be here now and here's the condition of it and notice thistles germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all this its existence that in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirit we know all that right all all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the Earth which is now the Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that see it was made by God the Creator and all oh I'm sorry and all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out here it was all there at the beginning when God you know created the the world it was in the earth and it was all laid out there when God himself created you were in his thinking and in him the great Eternal was the thought which is his attribute and that's you and now sin caused all this to happen and God through this age is gathering up his material Satan is still here that's the reason all these things happen he is still here and all of his evil forces are still here notice it's you know God of this evil age noce that's why the earth now is so filthy that's why the scum and ridiculous things that go on Bloodshed War politics sin adultery all kinds of filthiness goes on is because Satan is the ruler of this Earth and his atmosphere so he is the God of this evil of this evil age in in this realm in that in that time realm right and now it's gone to its apex he's come in he's taken over every layer of it you know no matter what government every layer everything all the churches it's all gone we know what we're in the days of lot we can see Sodom Gomorrah and everything all the thinking and everything and guess what it's going to get worse before it ends right so that's the situation that you're in and we're in that Earth that our seed he said there that we were in the earth so we went out of eternity and we're in that Earth so just just uh just here is just a couple of slides here on begotten of the father because it says in John 1:14 he says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and there was only one begotten of the god of the father and that was Jesus right so the original sin refers to the condition of sinfulness I'll let you see it that all humans Shear which is inherited from Adam and Eve due to the fall and proving the loss of original righteousness the Bible basis for the belief is found in Genesis 3 and in in in texts such as Psalms 515 I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me and also in Romans Romans 5 one verse there therefore just as Sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all people because all have sinned no one can no you know that's why you know it just continued on with the Jews and they kept doing the sacrifice because it couldn't be fulfilled right it was only they had a a solution just for one year where they could be covered for that sin but the sin could never be removed they needed one person to come who is begotten of the father right and there I had some notes up so just quickly I am going quickly here so just to show the process so God as we know he put a blood cell and he spoke it into the existence of a woman which is Mary right so it had to that that seed had to come through a woman in order to be a part of mankind so it was virgin born the Mary really had nothing to do with only she was just the the uh the body that they used and Jesus was born and his father was God he was the only one who was ever like that right that all came through sex or whatever Adam wasn't born he was just spoken into existence he Adam wasn't part of that mankind he had to come through a woman right to be part of that mankind so then so Jesus became a Kinsman he was a relative by birth he was a man he was 100% man man and he was 100% God and then so he was the only one eligible to be the kinsman redeemer someone who could redeem what was lost so he was the only one eligible God had one son that was born through a woman which was Jesus and he was the begotten of the father so just so you know what that uh that means there so in our case man there's a seed and we know how it is seed is uh used and then it's in a woman and then there's a child born but can that child be the kinsman redeemer he can't it was born in sin right under the original sin so he can't so could could someone like MDC he was not begotten of the father that was Jesus Christ right he spoke a body and stepped into it it wasn't a human body so it can't be a Kinsman to mankind it can't it can't uh uh remove that sin so he was not born through a woman nothing human about him he came through the spoken word he can't be a red redeems and he can't be the Lamb of God so there was only one that could be and all those that were there you saw in the Bible they might have Miracles and do wonderful things but they couldn't do this it was the only to be the begotten of the father trying to get through this but it's going to be tough so our symbol again so here we are we're in time our soul body Earth is all attributes of God that was in in the earth and it's all it it's all there it's all in time so here in the Old Testament and we went through the feast there and in in in all that uh God was in eternity and everyone that was born was in time there's no one in eternity that there's no way they can get there without a Kinsman Redeemer they can't get back so God has had to come up with a way to get them back into this realm again right and once he got all of it back he was going to just eliminate time which he does right before new heavens and new earth right after a great fire upon the Earth where he cleanse it so here so here when we get he he did die at Calvary he was the one that could the only begotten of the father and then there was then there was uh seven sabbaths 49 days after that after the resurrection and then there was Pentecost which is the fifth day and in the feast that we did on this day in the feast they had a holy convocation and they would have to they would have to go and burn a sacrifice it had to be a burnt sacrifice that's what they would have and that's what they would eat in that day but it was the fifth day it was the eighth day it was you know it was it was 49 and 50 was the eth and there was a holy convocation or a holy fire to do what it want and it was an eighth day and the soul is in the Eternal realm forever so what happened there when when Jesus when Jesus died there he fulfilled he fulfilled those feasts so he fulfilled Pentecost and he wait they did they went they went through those seven and then he went to the eight he went to the eighth but there is no e brother brandham explains there's no e because it starts back at the first again and just goes around so brother Bram calls that Eternal he it goes to the Eternal so that's an eternal day that that first day of Pentecost when when Peter spoke that was eternal Eternal Word it was an eternal day and it was an eternal Holy Fire that was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the fire that you need the Holy Fire to cleanse you out so that God himself the Eternal can dwell in you that's the only way you can do it you have to have the fire you can't shake hands with a preacher and say okay you're born again you have to have the fire to burn you out and when that when you when that fire burns you out you're changed you changed forever you'll never be the same you can't go on and do the same things that you did because you lose those desires because it's all burnt out now it takes you know it's it's a bit of a process you know the way it is right but it but it's a process that's happening that God is doing and is not going to turn back I got to go fast so the holy convocation that's this is the definition here that's the in the uh uh in Leviticus and he said that's the Eighth Day in or that's an eternal day because it's gone in as an ace it's gone around there's no more there's no more 1 to S and Jews were required to sacrifice Animals by far for that holy day that's what they had to do so in in the case when now it's that was when it when it wasn't being fulfilled they just did that every year that's what they had to do in a physical sense but now with Jesus coming and doing it it's now Eternal it's no more you don't have to do this anymore this is the Once Jesus only had to die once the Holy Spirit comes down it's down Peter o Peter declared that it was open for anyone who could receive and of course we knew who was going to receive which was the redeemed so here that there's three elements that have to be brought to their eth day or back to the first day the original day the Eternal day and the first one is your soul it has to be your soul Born Again by the spirit of God and you're sitting together in heaven places in Christ Jesus what you want to do is get back to the to Eternity you want to get back to the Eternal where you were in the beginning right but you can't because you're stuck in time because you you you you're born in sin you can't do it it's impossible so the first thing you have to do is you have to be born by the spirit of God that's the first thing to get you back into the Eternal the second thing it is the Earth is still in its seven day time so it has to have a holy fire so the earth the earth has to get back also to the Eternal to it's where God can dwell and all his people can dwell and and it it was in in it was in the in God in the beginning it it's this Earth is eternal it never had a beginning and it'll never have an end so now it's got to be but it also has to be purified because it has all this sin on it now that I just read it's at every level and we know that brother preaches the birth pains and it's in birth and it's about to give birth and this is what is about to happen is the it's going to get the Holy Fire it's going to burn off everything right so the third thing is it has to come in the eth day was the word of God it had to go beyond man-made manage thinking and the Book of redemption had to be opened the mystery of redemption that the world has no access to so the the general belief doesn't have any access that God keeps that very reserved for his redeemed people right and we know that at the seventh seal all of that was opened up we can see it it's all opened up it's the full Holy Ghost it's the full word revealed it's all loosed right it's all set to go God has got it to where he wants I got something here it is the end of seven sabbaths with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now your soul is in an eternal day right and you know that right cuz you can you can sense things right when you get the Holy Ghost you sense God is in the room you can sense that he's not in the room he you can sense things from that internal side right you're not fully over there because the body is not redeemed but that Soul now is part of that Eternal right so he can feel the spirit in the room you can feel it right so it's happening right so with the soul so we see the the same as the top and it goes on for another 2,000 2,000 years there so here I notice after in the future home and notice after 50 days or seven sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost The Eighth Day brother Braham says was seven uh I going to what happened the Holy Ghost fell on day of Pentecost the 8th day was seven sabbaths later exactly after his resurrection see so it' be seven times that again bring it right back around to the first day of the week again exactly so he's he's saying you're going into eternity so he say there there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day me and Joseph were talking about this is how I got stared on this he wasn't saved on any day you were always saved amen Jesus just came to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with Once once once you have eternal life once you're in God if you're in God's mind as an attribute you always were it you were always there you have eternal life so you can go anywhere you want but God is going to come and redeem you back to where you were in the beginning so it's going to happen you can't help it so it's not like you think you go to the Altar and you you do that all yourself but you don't right the redeem don't do don't do that God is drawing you right to that he's given you all of that right you think it started there it didn't start there it started right back in the beginning he just letting you know now you know that's what it want right but the church got their WR way of doing it the uh denomination that's what we kind of follow right so now now it's it's your you're getting now where the soul even though it's in the body it's it's it's in that Eternal realm it goes into that Eternal realm that's what I mean this uh this message it it it was a whole lot of layers there I didn't realize because now that that Soul exists there with God he's brought it back now into the into the realm so you really are separated right so he says here I just get a couple of scriptures here on it heavens and earth have met God man is reconciled oh sorry a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone just like all the curses of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see the Holy Ghost accepts you and you don't accept it it accepts you see because it's God's attribute see if it's the holy ghost means holy spirit and it's the see but Brown never he never preached his out around because he was preaching in denominational churches he didn't have any churches he had was Jeffersonville and then after he had Tucan Tabernacle and maybe sometimes down the streetport and when he died that's all he had he didn't have any his own churches not like now you can go around and preach this anywhere right he used to have gymnasiums and that he go and preach to Believers and stuff but he did he you don't see this on the tapes because he was in denominational Church they wouldn't have it they couldn't take this right it's only redeem can do this so see if it's the holy ghost means holy God's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose see yet you was born in sin you were born in sin truly original sin through your parents right but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on Earth and he looks down and gets you see you're back here here is where you belong see it's talking about eternity he's he's got that thing up right and see sin has lost its power that's right the desire for sin has gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you are a restored person but you get the lust on the Flesh and all of that the flesh is still working away doing all that stuff but this that the soul is not if it's sealed in by God it's it's finished right so so here again it just talking about the soul so on the 50th day 50th day the Holy Ghost fell on the day of pent C so so this is not this is not again it's the feast day and it's just doing a ritual here it's not anymore this is this is Christ now coming on the scene God coming on the scene and he's fulfilling this right and then and B is telling us now here's what happened when that was fulfilled and you don't have to do it anymore and we didn't do it anymore right so we don't do this anymore we don't have a Passover but we do have you know like uh you know the ordin an ordinance where we do remember it but you don't have to do it anymore you know it's done you would just do a remembrance of it like uh when you do communion and foot washing and things like that right and that's what the Jews should have done but they didn't they kept down with it they're still doing it so 50th it's an8 day it's an eternal day and it's the end of the sabbaths and your soul is in an eternal day Born Again of the spirit of God and the Soul goes there ha sir that was easy the soul is there it's redeemed godes have to do anything else so you're really in two Realms right do you ever feel like in two Realms I felt in two Realms right you know and uh if I was a preacher you could really preach that it needs a preacher because that's a a good thing because you feel it you you got a sense for it right you know the world's not going to believe this it's not you know it's not that's not how it works but that's how God is doing it getting it all back and he's got a lot of souls over there now right because you know they're over there because they're coming down when under the Rapture right they're going to they're going to meet up with their body that's going to be resurrected and their souls their theophanes and they're over there now right and now you're there too so Peter on that Eighth Day acts 238 the word can't be altered and this is an eternal day so if if you were so B talks about you know you got to read between the lines because there's things that you you don't understand you need a revelation and an easy one which is not easy for people but it says baptism right so you look at you look at the gospels and Jesus says you have to be baptized in the father Son and Holy Ghost and then over in Peter comes along shortly after and he says you have to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's confusion most of the people are born father Son and Holy Ghost but he was he's he's saying this on an eternal day this is after all it's been fulfilled he he's not going to mess this up you know Jesus was over in time and he didn't say anything wrong but he never said a name he never said he just said in the name of the name of he never said the name so we understand that because we have to read between the lines as brother Brown says right but pet Peter said the right thing and that that will never change that that is eternal because it's I'm that 50th starting that Eternal we're still in the Eternal because once you hit that Eighth Day read through the Bible once you hit that Eighth Day you're in the Eternal it's over and he's saying here we we're in the eighth day so we're into the Eternal it's it's now spiritual it has nothing to do with time anymore nothing you know whatever you do in time it doesn't matter and what matters it's over in heaven and and that's what matter and it's not in time like I say yes it's it doesn't matter it there's no yesterday that soul is over there and God looks at that Soul right you still had to repent over here and do all of that right but you know it's not going to be hell against you right so it's part of the Holy convocation that was laid out the Holy Fire the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the soul you must have Holy Fire not a handshake it has to annihilate every Trace Satan has has it has it it's not man-made religion at that stage right it's not that's all caught up there they'll still do that it doesn't matter but they haven't gone into the Eternal they're still in time they're still following uh you know their own rituals their own beliefs that they don't have the full word so it's never going to be a full Eternal right and an eternal experience so I got to go really fast here now oh sh I should end sorry I told you I'm out of uh practice here I really can't I'll finish Soul here and then we'll we'll just finish here sorry about that I thought I had didn't have enough you know so what happened oh here I'll give you the scripture what happened Christ came and called the church to repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission Sanctified the church and with the fire of God came down and burn out all the filth and came and dwelt and dwelt in the human heart that's what Christ did so Christ could come down he could come down into that time realm he could he walked around here in that time realm he could because he was he was U uh begotten of God like the man was like the man was when he still had hatred malice and strife in him when the fire baptism come it cleaned it off no more jealousy no more of nothing it just absolutely is a dwelling place for God and remember that's his delegation that's going to meet him Yonder I was going to look here because um I can't do these 20 more pages so one more here so here just showing showing where uh it's referenced in the scriptures and even when we were dead in sins in Ephesians 25 and 6 has quickened us together with Christ by by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places this is the eternity in Christ Jesus so that's where we are the real us right the one in the one in the time is a shadow it's not the real one we're just a shadow of that real one but the real one now is been redeemed and is up in eternity and we can have Fellowship it says here and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so in Christ Jesus that's where we are who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so that that attribute of us has been restored we will never if that if if you are in Christ in that Eternal realm you will never and you are Eternal you will never die you know spiritually you will live eternally right in a new heavens and a new Earth and it doesn't happen when you're when you're dead and go up it happens now right the process one more quote here yes sir out of out of the church age book ler hand the church is no longer the mount piece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her that's he's talking about the church so there no more the church is the briad right he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in Revelation 227 the spirit and the bride say come right so there we are I'm not going to go into the rest of it but it's it's over and at the end that that Loop that hickey it all gets it gets uh completed you know it's fulfilled and it just goes back into eternity and that it God carries on the same way with all his attributes manifested in a new Heavens A New Earth on the Earth right and that will be eternity forever no day no yesterday no no Tomorrow there's no it's just one day and that's it amen
