[38:13] here lord we pray your ministry and
[38:15] grace to each one in jesus christ's name
[38:17] we ask amen amen amen thank you
[38:19] musicians
[38:21] man if you'll turn the scriptures to
[38:22] romans chapter 10 romans chapter 10
[38:24] and then certainly good to have i
[38:26] believe it's sister amber is that is
[38:28] that her name did i hear that right
[38:30] sister amber back
[38:31] amen and i thought i saw matt crack a
[38:34] smile earlier as well so
[38:36] i think he's i think he's happy
[38:38] happy to have his wife back i think
[38:39] we're happy to have his wife back
[38:41] and then so it's good to have her back
[38:43] and not an easy trip sister amber i know
[38:45] but it's good to have you back here and
[38:47] trusting god's grace and comfort to be
[38:49] with you and then blanc and the kids had
[38:51] a a good trip down it was a long day for
[38:54] them almost 20 hours from start to
[38:55] finish but no complications they sailed
[38:58] through customs and no no issues
[39:00] whatsoever so we praise god for that
[39:02] and then i believe sister rebecca katuka
[39:04] is leaving this week to go back to
[39:05] labrador they're not here tonight i'm
[39:07] not sure but i believe they're leaving
[39:08] to go back they may be here sunday but
[39:11] if not we certainly wish her and the
[39:12] family well as they go home for the
[39:13] summer to be with uh her husband and
[39:16] their father and whatnot so
[39:18] god's grace to them remember romans 10
[39:20] and and start at verse 8 says the word
[39:23] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[39:25] thy heart that is the word of faith
[39:27] which we preach
[39:29] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[39:30] mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe
[39:32] in thine heart that god hath raised him
[39:34] from the dead thou shalt be saved for
[39:37] with the heart man believeth unto
[39:38] righteousness and with the mouth
[39:40] confession has made unto salvation for
[39:43] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[39:45] on him shall not be ashamed amen god
[39:48] bless you you can have your seats this
[39:50] evening
[39:51] amen i want to continue on this the
[39:53] series we touched on and left off i
[39:55] think over a month ago since we last
[39:57] spoke on it on the authority to believe
[39:59] and i want to just take a a little topic
[40:01] here tonight of feeding your faith and
[40:03] then feeding your faith and i want to
[40:05] just do a very quick recap here if if
[40:08] that's okay just for a moment to to
[40:10] touch on some of the key elements as we
[40:12] go to this because it's with a series
[40:14] you always want to kind of go
[40:15] sequentially and everyone's fresh and
[40:16] it's in their mind and whatnot but we've
[40:18] had a bit of a break here um so i want
[40:20] you to remember about how we talked
[40:22] about faith and we showed that the faith
[40:23] you have for salvation the faith that
[40:25] makes you step out into water baptism to
[40:27] accept jesus christ as your lord and
[40:29] savior is no different than the faith
[40:30] that you have for healing for
[40:32] deliverance for provision and all these
[40:33] different things amen it's one faith for
[40:35] all of them now it may be applied
[40:37] differently you may be something that
[40:39] you approach a little differently but
[40:40] it's all the same faith for all of those
[40:42] things in our lives in ephesians 4 it
[40:44] says there is one body and one spirit
[40:47] even as ye are called in one hope of
[40:49] your calling one lord one faith one
[40:52] baptism so don't go looking for a
[40:53] different faith don't say well i don't
[40:55] have the faith i need for healing i
[40:56] don't have the faith i need to trust god
[40:58] no you have the faith it's all one faith
[41:00] if you had it once you'll have it
[41:01] forever and then he doesn't give it and
[41:03] take it away god's not in you know the
[41:05] the proverbial indian giver i don't know
[41:07] if we're allowed to say that anymore but
[41:08] he doesn't give you something to steal
[41:10] it back later to take it back once god
[41:12] gives you a gift he doesn't take it away
[41:13] from you if he gives it then he gives it
[41:15] to you for for all time and and for as
[41:17] long as you might need it amen but this
[41:20] this word faith here is is very special
[41:22] because we've been taught and brother
[41:23] branham teaches it very clearly that
[41:25] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[41:27] and it is and i'm not going to try and
[41:28] change that definition this evening by
[41:30] any means but but when you go to the
[41:32] root of that word it it kind of it
[41:34] expands on that a little bit and and the
[41:36] the root word is pistus and it it means
[41:39] if anyone this or anybody that's owned a
[41:41] car will recognize this it means it's a
[41:44] guarantee or a warranty
[41:46] so faith is a warranty is what the root
[41:49] word means it's a guarantee and if you
[41:51] have a guarantee it means you have a
[41:53] guarantor and if you have a warranty it
[41:55] means you have a warrantor it means that
[41:57] there's something behind it it's not
[41:58] just something that's written on a piece
[42:00] of paper it's not just an idea it's not
[42:02] just an empty promise but it means that
[42:04] there's some substance behind it and if
[42:06] you go and you buy a vehicle and there's
[42:07] a warranty behind it if something goes
[42:10] wrong then you get to go to the war and
[42:11] tour which is usually the manufacturing
[42:13] you say my car is wrong it's broken fix
[42:16] it and they fix it free of charge why
[42:18] because that's part of their guarantee
[42:20] it's part of their warranty and what
[42:22] this word means is that when god gives
[42:23] you faith he's giving you a guarantee
[42:26] that whatever he's given you faith for
[42:27] is going to come to pass in your life if
[42:29] you can find it in the word that's the
[42:31] key thing there is that if he's given it
[42:32] to you by the word and he gives you
[42:34] faith to step out and believe it he
[42:36] gives you faith to act on he gives you
[42:37] faith to confess it then that is the
[42:39] guarantee that it's going to happen in
[42:41] your life
[42:42] but it's got to be inspired by the holy
[42:44] spirit we have these word of faith
[42:45] movements we have the you know the
[42:46] prosperity doctrine and all these
[42:48] different things that's not what we're
[42:49] talking about what we're talking about
[42:50] is the one faith which is the original
[42:53] faith which god gives you and you can
[42:54] have human faith for the promises of god
[42:56] all day long but you won't get them
[42:58] right it's not your faith that does it
[42:59] it's the faith of god inside of you that
[43:01] brings those words to that word to to
[43:04] reality in your life amen so the faith
[43:06] is a proof of a guarantee from god that
[43:08] he would do what he said he would do
[43:10] right that's his warranty faith is his
[43:12] warranty that's something that you hold
[43:13] on to that you can go to him and say
[43:15] i've got faith to believe it that means
[43:16] that you're going to give it to me
[43:17] because i can only have faith as you
[43:19] give it to me amen the scripture
[43:21] confirms that this is all his work
[43:22] because it says by grace through faith
[43:24] we're saved and not that not of
[43:26] ourselves it is a gift of god so this is
[43:28] a gift to us and the thing about a
[43:30] guarantee or a warranty is that it is
[43:32] something that is given to you
[43:33] you don't res it's not something that
[43:35] you can generate it's not something that
[43:37] you can create it's not anything that
[43:39] has to do with you but it has to do with
[43:40] somebody else and so faith is something
[43:42] that only comes from one side it comes
[43:45] from him and we receive it and then as
[43:47] we receive it then we act on it and
[43:49] that's the way it works it is his
[43:50] guarantee and we are the receiver for
[43:52] that right it's something that he does
[43:55] and we are the benefactor for it it's
[43:57] not of ours to get it's ours to use once
[43:59] it's given to us it's ours to rely on
[44:01] once it's given into our lives amen now
[44:04] i want to draw a distinction a bit as we
[44:05] move into into kind of the main portion
[44:07] of the service tonight i talked about it
[44:09] a little bit before but i want to say
[44:11] that we have faith for two main purposes
[44:13] in life and the first thing is faith to
[44:15] receive and the second is faith to do
[44:18] you have faith to get something and we
[44:20] have faith that puts us into action to
[44:21] do something for the kingdom of god so
[44:23] you have promises that are given to you
[44:25] and you have faith to receive those
[44:26] promises but then you have commission
[44:28] and you have an unction to go do
[44:30] something and you do that thing by faith
[44:31] because it's often going to be
[44:32] supernatural it's going to be spiritual
[44:34] in nature and so you've got to have
[44:36] faith to do it otherwise you're going to
[44:37] fall flat on your face when you do it
[44:39] but i want to focus on faith to receive
[44:41] because that's what we generally are
[44:42] talking about for most of us is we're
[44:44] looking for faith to receive the
[44:46] promises and then we'll focus a little
[44:47] bit later lord willing not this service
[44:49] but maybe a couple down the road on that
[44:51] that faith of commission that faith to
[44:53] put us into action amen now if you'll
[44:56] remember we talked about faith and we
[44:57] said faith is not something where we go
[44:59] in and god gives us more faith and more
[45:01] faith and more faith but faith is more
[45:03] like a seed right and it's something
[45:04] that you get a portion of it at the
[45:06] beginning and then it grows right
[45:08] brother brandon would talk about raising
[45:10] the level of your faith he didn't say
[45:11] give you more faith he said raise the
[45:13] level of your faith he's trying to get
[45:15] what you have to grow to expand and
[45:17] you'll find your body's only got two
[45:18] things inside of it it's faith and doubt
[45:21] and so if he's getting you to increase
[45:22] your faith if he's getting you to expand
[45:24] your faith that means he's pushing more
[45:25] and more doubt out and so what's
[45:27] happening a lot of times we're getting
[45:28] faith in certain areas of our life
[45:30] because this is something that goes on
[45:32] over time it's not an immediate thing
[45:33] and it's one and done and you have faith
[45:35] for everything you have the potential
[45:37] for everything but god's slowly working
[45:39] in our lives because we're creatures of
[45:40] time to push out unbelief to push out
[45:43] doubt in our lives and as he does that
[45:45] then we get more and more of the
[45:46] supernatural in our lives in those areas
[45:48] because faith comes in it kicks out
[45:50] satan and his works and in comes the
[45:52] word and all of a sudden the room's
[45:53] cleaned out and god's got a place that
[45:54] he can work in our lives amen but what
[45:57] we see and certainly the older ones
[45:59] amongst us are the ones that have been
[46:00] serving the lord for a while can say
[46:02] that when you have moments of great
[46:03] faith it rarely just happened like this
[46:05] now the appearance of the faith may be
[46:07] sudden but what you realize is that so
[46:09] often there's been something that's
[46:10] going on underneath in your life for
[46:12] quite some time and then it builds to a
[46:14] moment and in that moment you step out
[46:16] in faith and that thing appears or that
[46:18] thing happens but usually god's working
[46:20] in your life and it's just like a seed
[46:22] you plant it and you plant that seed and
[46:24] it's under the ground and you don't see
[46:25] anything for quite some time but in one
[46:27] moment it breaks through and you say ah
[46:29] it's alive but that doesn't mean nothing
[46:31] was happening before that just means
[46:33] that your faith has been made sight all
[46:35] of a sudden and you think well that's
[46:36] the moment i got faith no that's the
[46:38] moment your faith became sight but the
[46:40] faith was working all along to bring it
[46:42] to fruition they meant to bring it up
[46:43] out of the ground and god's promises are
[46:45] very much the same way is that they act
[46:47] like a seed you take a word seed you
[46:49] take a word promise and you plant it in
[46:51] a in good ground which is a faithful
[46:53] willing heart and you put it in there a
[46:55] receiving heart and you plant it in
[46:57] there and then you say well what's going
[46:59] to happen now
[47:00] right
[47:01] should i see life right away and the
[47:03] thing is we want to think that life has
[47:05] to happen right away well something's
[47:06] coming but that doesn't mean that you
[47:08] can see it necessarily because it's in
[47:09] the ground right it's got to bring out
[47:11] in time brother braham says it this way
[47:13] he says now when you bury a seed you
[47:15] farmers you take and go out here and
[47:16] plant your corn you don't go out every
[47:18] morning and scratch it up and say let's
[47:19] see now is it growing anything happen to
[47:22] it no then you put it back down later
[47:25] the next day you say i want to see if
[47:26] it's getting along all right scratch it
[47:28] up again it'll never grow like that well
[47:30] the thing you do with the seed you
[47:31] commit it to the ground you cover it up
[47:34] that's all you can do about it it's up
[47:36] to god to do the rest of it amen he says
[47:38] well that's the way it is with the word
[47:40] of god that's the same way it is with
[47:41] the word of god
[47:43] if you'll take any divine promise god
[47:45] made in his bible put it in your heart
[47:48] and water it every day with the praises
[47:50] of god that's going to come to pass
[47:53] he says it'll grow if you don't quit
[47:56] fooling with it if you'll just leave it
[47:59] alone
[48:00] you say don't say let me see can i move
[48:03] my finger any better today do i feel any
[48:05] better is my headache a little better oh
[48:07] no it'll never be that just committed to
[48:10] god and walk away and leave it alone
[48:12] that's god's seed it'll grow so he's
[48:15] talking about he says if you take that
[48:16] seed and you plant it in good ground and
[48:18] you water it with praises and you
[48:20] confess it daily and you walk away and
[48:22] don't try digging it up you see how he
[48:24] says here let me see what's he saying is
[48:27] he's saying this is your way of digging
[48:28] it up as you say can i move my finger
[48:30] you broke your hand maybe you broke your
[48:32] finger or your whatever and he says you
[48:33] see can i move my finger a little bit
[48:35] maybe you're paralyzed well can i move
[48:36] my finger today no i can't oh i guess
[48:38] that means nothing's gone nothing's
[48:40] happening then you put that back in the
[48:42] next day can i move my finger again
[48:43] better
[48:44] he says that's not that's digging up the
[48:46] promise of god every single day and
[48:48] it'll never grow that way if you keep
[48:49] doing that sort of thing right but he
[48:51] says if we water it if we read our
[48:53] bibles we pray we go to church we have
[48:54] the right kind of fellowship we have the
[48:56] right kind of atmosphere in our home
[48:58] then it's going to bring forth the seed
[48:59] that you promised that's been promised
[49:01] to you right
[49:02] but if you want to have faith the
[49:04] prophet says don't keep testing it
[49:07] testing your faith is not the way to
[49:09] prove your faith
[49:10] he says leave it alone if you've got
[49:12] faith to believe it plant it water it
[49:14] and then walk away and don't keep
[49:16] digging up that promise that you keep
[49:18] claiming or that you say you claim
[49:20] what he's saying is if you've got a
[49:21] broken arm don't try and do a push-up
[49:23] every day
[49:25] guess what if you have a broken arm you
[49:26] say well well god has healed me and you
[49:28] go to try and do a
[49:30] push-up with a broken arm what's going
[49:31] to happen
[49:33] you're going to fall down on the side
[49:34] that that is trying to support itself
[49:36] with a broken arm and you're going to
[49:37] hurt your broken arm even more
[49:39] and you're going to say eventually god
[49:42] didn't heal me
[49:43] you don't have to go and do a push-up
[49:45] every day to prove that god healed your
[49:46] broken arm right he can do it in the
[49:48] moment
[49:49] but more often it's not that way it's a
[49:51] process of time so don't start doing
[49:53] trying to do a push-up every day since
[49:55] you claimed that he healed you that's
[49:57] not that's what he's saying he's saying
[49:58] you're tempting god you're tempting
[50:00] yourself you're digging up the promise
[50:02] by trying to prove him right he's saying
[50:04] don't pretend that's what he's saying
[50:06] don't pretend he says when it's there
[50:08] you'll know
[50:09] and we'll know so you don't have to
[50:11] pretend about it so don't do push-ups
[50:13] with a broken arm let it heal praise god
[50:15] for it how long say god has healed my
[50:16] arm my arm's gonna get fully better i'm
[50:18] gonna have full functionality and then
[50:20] when you can do a push-up then you say
[50:22] he's healed me but don't try doing a
[50:24] push-up when you know your arm's still
[50:25] broken it doesn't make any sense right
[50:28] we think that we think that that we have
[50:30] to walk around pretending we have what
[50:32] we believe
[50:33] but we're never told to pretend to have
[50:35] what we believe we're told to confess
[50:38] we're told to confess that's what we
[50:40] read in our first scripture our
[50:41] confession is what he's looking for amen
[50:43] and then it's up to him to do the work
[50:45] that doesn't mean nothing's changing it
[50:47] just means that your confession is that
[50:48] he's healed me your confession is that
[50:50] he's delivered me your confessions that
[50:51] he's providing for me that he's made the
[50:53] change in my life that i need and all
[50:55] these different things right we don't
[50:56] pretend to have something we profess
[50:58] that we have been given something amen
[51:01] and that in his time it's going to come
[51:03] to pass in our lives amen our
[51:05] obligations not to pretend
[51:07] what we have in our bodies when we
[51:09] clearly don't have it
[51:10] okay that's that's something we've got
[51:11] to be very careful of is that we look at
[51:13] it we look at the word and say well if i
[51:14] say that i've got it then that's what
[51:16] he's looking for
[51:17] and then you go and you you change that
[51:19] this is not the way he does it i'll read
[51:21] you a story we remember the story of
[51:22] john ryan the the blind man remember
[51:24] that well i'll read it to you rather
[51:26] than tell you i'll read it he says and
[51:28] this is john ryan he's come up he was
[51:29] prayed for and brother brahm says you're
[51:31] healed and he said well and he walked
[51:32] off on a little piece and he come back
[51:34] he said say you told me i was going to
[51:35] receive my sight i said that's right he
[51:37] said you said i was healed i said you
[51:38] are he said well you told me i was
[51:40] healed and i can't see i said that
[51:42] doesn't have anything to do with you
[51:43] seeing
[51:44] the man by the way was a catholic by
[51:46] faith and i said look sir you told me
[51:48] that you believe me he said well those
[51:50] other people are talking out there that
[51:51] they're healed them well
[51:54] so he's saying they went up and they got
[51:55] healed immediately and i went up and you
[51:57] said i was healed and i'm not healed
[51:58] immediately what gives
[52:01] what he's doing is he's painting the
[52:02] prop to the wall he's saying you said i
[52:04] was healed and i clearly am not the way
[52:06] they are
[52:07] i can i still can't see
[52:10] you said i was healed but i can't see
[52:13] so something's wrong here brother brown
[52:15] says well i thought you said you
[52:16] believed he says i did but but everybody
[52:18] else is different than me in my healing
[52:21] brother brown says you are too sir give
[52:24] the angel of the lord a chance to
[52:26] and he said what must i do. i said do
[52:28] you believe what i told you he said yes
[52:30] sir then i said well then why don't you
[52:31] act like it
[52:33] now you would say well how would he act
[52:35] like it
[52:36] would he go out and start a career as a
[52:38] photographer would he go out and drive a
[52:40] car would he go out and play in traffic
[52:42] is that the way he would act like it
[52:45] that's what we would say sometimes is
[52:46] that's how you act like it as you go in
[52:48] and you say well i've got it and you act
[52:49] like you've got it
[52:51] but watch what brother branham says here
[52:52] he says see i said go on off of here
[52:55] testifying saying praise the lord he
[52:57] healed me that's how you act it out
[53:01] he says he said all right and they let
[53:02] him off and he hollered praise the lord
[53:04] for healing me the next night the old
[53:06] fellow interrupted the meeting four or
[53:07] five times he was sitting up in the
[53:08] balcony and say everybody be quiet a
[53:10] minute he'd raise up and holler praise
[53:12] the lord for healing me and set down
[53:14] and i was speaking you know and he'd say
[53:15] just a minute brother branham he'd
[53:17] holler praise the lord for healing me
[53:18] the ushers went over there and i shook
[53:20] my head let him alone see he was having
[53:21] a good time with it he's a catholic he
[53:23] doesn't know anything better
[53:25] hopefully hopefully we have no catholics
[53:26] online here tonight he said just let him
[53:28] go he's doing what i told him to do
[53:31] maybe out of order but he's doing what
[53:32] he what i told him to do
[53:34] he says well afterwards he went out on
[53:35] the street he sold papers and he said
[53:37] praise the lord for healing me he'd
[53:38] holler extra praise the lord for healing
[53:40] me and the people laughed at him and
[53:42] made fun of him they thought that old
[53:43] man's gone crazy and went crazy over
[53:45] religion
[53:46] see so they had thought he was ready for
[53:48] the institution so we went on like that
[53:50] for several days guess up to two or
[53:52] three weeks and one day a little newsboy
[53:53] sold papers near him led him over to a
[53:55] barber shop to get a shave and the
[53:57] barber a little smart alec had more
[53:59] sense than he had gumption to know how
[54:00] to take care of it and he was wetting
[54:02] his razor and he had mr ryan shaved
[54:04] about halfway down on his face he said
[54:06] say dad i heard that you went to see
[54:08] that divine healer not long ago he said
[54:10] yep i went up to see him said i heard
[54:12] you got healed he said yup praise the
[54:13] lord he healed me
[54:15] and his eyes come open in the chair he
[54:17] looked around he said i am healed now
[54:22] so he was his confession was i am healed
[54:25] and then he said i am healed now
[54:28] the healing i've confessed is here now
[54:31] he says and he jumped out of that chair
[54:32] with the towel around his neck and out
[54:33] the door he went the barber behind him
[54:35] with the razor down the street now
[54:37] listen to this
[54:38] now he couldn't see perfect he could see
[54:41] objects and everything screaming to the
[54:43] top of his voice and that man john
[54:45] ryan's in dowagiac michigan as far as i
[54:47] know tonight preaching divine healing by
[54:49] faith that's right what was it he
[54:51] expected god to heal him
[54:54] now i want you to notice he jumps out of
[54:55] there saying i'm healed now and he comes
[54:57] out and he can't even see clearly but he
[55:00] can see
[55:01] and we'll get to this a little bit later
[55:03] in the next service lord willing about
[55:04] how this works but he could see
[55:07] a little bit remember the scripture
[55:08] talks and i think was brother ed talked
[55:10] about it where he said the the blind man
[55:12] jesus touched him and he says can you
[55:14] see and he says i see men walking around
[55:16] as trees
[55:17] this is what happened
[55:19] this is literally a recreation of what
[55:21] happened with christ in that blind man
[55:23] and then he touches him again and he can
[55:25] see clearly remember there was a double
[55:27] touch this is the same thing happened
[55:29] with john ryan he wasn't perfectly
[55:30] healed at that moment but his eyes came
[55:32] open he could finally see a little bit
[55:35] and then over the next little while he
[55:36] got to full sight because of that but
[55:38] what was it brother brown says what was
[55:40] it he expected god to heal him and all
[55:43] he had to do was confess
[55:45] he didn't have to pretend
[55:47] he didn't have to say the symptoms
[55:49] aren't aren't there
[55:51] he said all he had to do was confess his
[55:53] healing that's how you act on faith is
[55:55] confess what you believe you confess the
[55:58] promise and that is it we don't have to
[56:00] pretend amen amen now why did god wait
[56:03] why did god wait for john ryan why did
[56:05] so many others get immediate healing and
[56:07] he had to wait his two or three weeks
[56:08] and then only partially and then it was
[56:10] and then he had to wait even more after
[56:11] that
[56:12] i don't know i don't know the mind of
[56:14] god this is the sovereignty of god that
[56:16] we're seeing here okay
[56:18] so god sometimes does things sovereignly
[56:20] and that he does them immediately and
[56:21] sometimes god does things sovereignly
[56:23] and that he waits a while and it's god
[56:25] that god that chooses that it's not us
[56:26] to do it listen he made abraham wait 24
[56:29] years before he saw a sign
[56:32] of his baby and that was his wife's
[56:34] belly starting to get round and her body
[56:36] changed back to a 20 year old
[56:37] amen okay
[56:39] joseph gets the gets the vision and the
[56:41] prophecy that he's going to be a ruler
[56:43] and his brothers are going to bow out to
[56:45] him and he goes through 22 years of
[56:47] misery before he ever sees that happen
[56:50] david waits 15 years to become a king
[56:53] and 22 years beca before he's the full
[56:55] king of israel and judah together and
[56:57] listen all of these promises
[57:00] were brought to them
[57:02] god came and he called them he told them
[57:04] something he showed them something they
[57:05] didn't come to god abraham didn't come
[57:07] to god and say oh god i want a son i
[57:09] want a son god called him out of earth
[57:12] abraham was not a child of god in the
[57:13] sense that he was running around like a
[57:15] christian back then he called him out of
[57:17] idolatry and he separated him and he
[57:19] gave him a promise and abraham didn't
[57:21] ask for it god came and sovereignly did
[57:23] it god called joseph and was going to
[57:25] use him as a savior god called david to
[57:27] align the kingdoms and bring them back
[57:28] under godly rule they didn't ask for any
[57:30] of this god came and told him that it
[57:32] was going to happen god gave them the
[57:34] promise and then god waited between 22
[57:36] and 24 years for every single one of
[57:38] them
[57:40] why
[57:42] well in some cases he had to develop the
[57:43] character
[57:45] so what do we think we're going to get
[57:46] away with no character
[57:48] that's usually what it is he's
[57:49] developing character but i like what
[57:51] brother joe said and i talked to him
[57:52] about it later he said that came to me
[57:54] just then and
[57:56] and he said god will start a fire and
[57:58] put you in it to have a conversation
[58:00] with you and get you closer to him i
[58:01] thought that was absolutely phenomenal
[58:04] god will put you into a trial to get you
[58:05] talking to him
[58:07] right guess what when we're in trials
[58:08] when we're in needs that's when we tend
[58:10] to talk about the most because we're
[58:12] human right times are good we tend to
[58:13] pull away and when times are bad we tend
[58:15] to pull close so guess what there's a
[58:17] lot of trials and tribulations for
[58:18] christians because we're still in these
[58:19] these two-thirds cursed bodies that are
[58:21] unredeemable right
[58:23] so god's working in our lives amen we're
[58:25] talking about promises and prophecies
[58:26] that god gave
[58:28] we didn't go to god and say god i need a
[58:30] promise for healing god i need a promise
[58:31] for deliverance he came and said i'm
[58:33] giving you healing i'm giving you
[58:34] deliverance i'm giving you provision i'm
[58:36] giving you all of these things and then
[58:38] we sit there and say well then how come
[58:40] i don't get it right away
[58:41] and like we said before there's a much
[58:43] bigger picture here than just giving us
[58:44] everything that we want
[58:46] and then there's a process that we go
[58:47] through
[58:48] now listen to this this is a bit of a
[58:49] lengthy quote and he's talking about
[58:51] noah but he says then after that he's
[58:53] talking about the stature of a perfect
[58:54] man
[58:56] after that fourthly he says you want to
[58:57] add patience to your faith if you've got
[59:00] faith and work with patience the bible
[59:01] said see so this is patience now that's
[59:03] the next thing is going to build the
[59:05] stature you know god has got real
[59:07] material in his building guess what the
[59:09] bride that he's building is not some
[59:11] soft you know uh hot hot house plant
[59:14] that just falls down the minute a bit of
[59:16] frost comes or the weather gets bad or
[59:17] something like that he says he's
[59:19] building a bride out of real material
[59:21] and this is the real material that he's
[59:22] talking about and this is not human
[59:24] faith and virtue and knowledge in this
[59:26] this is godly this is this is the the
[59:28] holy spirit working in a believer's life
[59:30] he says god's got real material in his
[59:32] building see how short we are brother
[59:34] and sister we have glory we have shouts
[59:37] and things because we got faith but when
[59:38] we come down to these things here god
[59:40] can't build us up to the statue he says
[59:42] we got all of this down here but he says
[59:44] it doesn't build into this which shows
[59:46] there's something wrong in the beginning
[59:48] he says he can't he can't make us up to
[59:50] that kind of a place we've got all these
[59:51] other things we fall and slide off with
[59:53] it see he can't build his church
[59:56] patience with what what kind of patience
[59:58] the first thing is have patience with
[1:00:00] god
[1:00:01] he says if you've got real genuine faith
[1:00:03] you'll have real genuine patience
[1:00:05] because faith worketh patience when god
[1:00:08] says anything you believe it that's all
[1:00:10] you've got patience say well i asked him
[1:00:12] last night to heal me and i'm just as
[1:00:13] sick this morning
[1:00:15] oh my what patience god told abraham and
[1:00:18] 25 years later there wasn't even one
[1:00:20] sign he was still believing he was
[1:00:22] patient with god he said put him always
[1:00:25] before you let him be the next crossing
[1:00:28] thing you can't cross them you'll just
[1:00:30] keep them before you he said so and it's
[1:00:32] going to happen see keep him before you
[1:00:35] that's right noah have real godly
[1:00:36] patience god said i'm going to destroy
[1:00:38] this world with rain and noah preached
[1:00:40] 120 years yet plenty of patience not
[1:00:43] even dew fell from heaven wasn't nothing
[1:00:45] just as dusty as it ever was for 120
[1:00:49] years he was still
[1:00:51] just as uh sorry for 120 years but he
[1:00:53] was patient he says then god tries your
[1:00:55] patience that's right
[1:00:58] after he told noah now he said noah i
[1:01:00] want you to go ahead and get in the ark
[1:01:01] i'm going to run the animals in there
[1:01:02] and i want you to get in climb way
[1:01:04] upstairs now so you can look out at the
[1:01:06] top window now i want you to get in
[1:01:08] there i want you to tell these people
[1:01:09] tomorrow what i've been preaching for
[1:01:11] 120 years is going to take place all
[1:01:13] right you go down there and tell them
[1:01:16] what was the first sign noah got in the
[1:01:18] air there wasn't no rain noah got ready
[1:01:20] got the raincoat on and everything so he
[1:01:22] could look out once in a while he got
[1:01:23] ready but the next day
[1:01:26] instead of a black cloud here come the
[1:01:28] sun coming up just like it always did
[1:01:32] it's going to rain god
[1:01:34] what's this sunny
[1:01:36] this sunny sky we're dealing with
[1:01:39] california suns
[1:01:41] right not newfoundland rains
[1:01:43] lord you said it was going to rain
[1:01:46] no looked out and said hey there ain't
[1:01:47] no cloud
[1:01:49] this guy come up said i known you was
[1:01:51] one of them you see you're hanging
[1:01:52] around up here well part of me sir ha ha
[1:01:54] maybe you know i was just you know
[1:01:55] enthused you know kind of see
[1:01:59] do we back down sometimes
[1:02:01] maybe i just got enthusiastic
[1:02:06] he said but noah's he had patience said
[1:02:08] if it don't come to date it'll be here
[1:02:10] tomorrow
[1:02:11] why god said so when he did when do you
[1:02:14] tell you that noah 120 years ago i've
[1:02:17] come this far so i'm just waiting here
[1:02:19] now he said see that now after a while
[1:02:22] noah waited the fourth day passed no
[1:02:24] rain it's all right it's gonna happen i
[1:02:25] can hear mrs noah come around say dad
[1:02:27] are you sure don't talk like that he had
[1:02:29] patience because he had faith yes sir he
[1:02:32] had virtue he had knowledge that god was
[1:02:34] right he had temperance he didn't fly
[1:02:36] loose didn't get impatient we see that
[1:02:38] with job you know
[1:02:40] believe i tend to think if i was job i'd
[1:02:42] have reacted way differently than job
[1:02:44] job didn't even have the holy ghost and
[1:02:46] i feel like sometimes i react
[1:02:47] differently job lost everything and he
[1:02:49] didn't fly loose his life told him fly
[1:02:51] loose let go tell god off and die this
[1:02:54] ain't worth it
[1:02:56] but he says no i didn't let loose
[1:02:59] he said
[1:03:00] what well i don't know what it's all
[1:03:03] about i've lost all my popularity out
[1:03:05] there no no people don't care for me no
[1:03:07] more i'll go out there and start all
[1:03:08] over again new again no no he had
[1:03:11] patience god promised god will do it god
[1:03:14] will do it because god said so
[1:03:16] noah had to be convinced that god came
[1:03:18] down and started this whole thing didn't
[1:03:19] he
[1:03:20] he says his daughter-in-law said father
[1:03:22] you know
[1:03:23] it will rain but we've been all these
[1:03:25] years waiting we've been preparing and
[1:03:27] you told us it's going to rain a week
[1:03:28] ago and we're in here the doors are all
[1:03:30] shut and here we are walking around in
[1:03:32] here and the sun just scorching right
[1:03:33] down like it was but it will rain
[1:03:36] how do you know god said so he says now
[1:03:39] when you get that way at it he says add
[1:03:41] that kind of patience he says you ain't
[1:03:43] got it that way don't try and add it it
[1:03:45] won't work it won't work on healing it
[1:03:46] won't work on nothing else see it's got
[1:03:48] to blend in with the same material it's
[1:03:50] vulcanized too that's right got to add
[1:03:53] it patience with god's promise yes sir
[1:03:55] noah believed it and he had patience
[1:03:57] with god 120 years listen if you've got
[1:04:00] godly faith then it's going to be godly
[1:04:01] virtue that goes in there it's going to
[1:04:02] be strength to take you through and
[1:04:04] it'll convert itself to that knowledge
[1:04:06] where faith becomes sight and then it'll
[1:04:08] be temperance where you what you don't
[1:04:09] let loose
[1:04:10] you don't get mad at god you don't get
[1:04:12] upset at god you don't get petulant with
[1:04:14] god because he didn't do it the way you
[1:04:15] thought he did and that brings you into
[1:04:17] patience that'll take you into all these
[1:04:19] other things he says don't add something
[1:04:21] that's not godly to something that is it
[1:04:23] won't blend it won't work when you
[1:04:24] vulcanize rubber it's got to be rubber
[1:04:26] on rubber you can't put anything else
[1:04:27] together with rubber it doesn't work
[1:04:28] that way but a vulcanizing process will
[1:04:30] join rubber together right
[1:04:32] what's he saying he's saying your
[1:04:33] confession is what matters and stay
[1:04:35] there and confess god said it i believe
[1:04:37] it and i'll stay here
[1:04:39] we won't ever have to wait 120 years i
[1:04:41] don't believe
[1:04:42] but guess what he can make us wait a
[1:04:44] year
[1:04:45] he can make us wait two years he can
[1:04:46] make his way five years
[1:04:48] or he can do it today or he can do it
[1:04:49] tomorrow it's up to him
[1:04:51] we've got to have patience to hold on to
[1:04:53] these things amen
[1:04:55] remember
[1:04:56] noah didn't make it rain
[1:04:59] noah's message was it's gonna rain
[1:05:02] but noah didn't make it rain
[1:05:04] we got a message that says you're gonna
[1:05:05] go on a rapture
[1:05:07] guess what it's not you that's going to
[1:05:09] go in the rapture it's god that's going
[1:05:10] to take you in a rapture you've got a
[1:05:11] holy ghost inside of you that's going to
[1:05:13] take you out of this pest ridden body
[1:05:15] and it's going to put you into a new one
[1:05:16] amen it's going to be a working of god
[1:05:18] that does it it's not us to do we read
[1:05:20] even those scriptures that said they'll
[1:05:21] cast out devils they'll take up serpents
[1:05:23] and and we think we're going to do that
[1:05:26] well we are going to do it but it's not
[1:05:27] us that does it it's going to be christ
[1:05:29] in us that's going to be doing it how
[1:05:30] are you going to cast out a demon you
[1:05:32] can't even see
[1:05:33] what are you going to do reach in and
[1:05:34] grab them by the throat and shake them
[1:05:35] and say get out everything we do is in
[1:05:38] the name of jesus by the word of god
[1:05:40] everything we do so it's not us that's
[1:05:42] doing it it's us that's speaking it it's
[1:05:44] us that's confessing it it's us that's
[1:05:46] speaking with authority but it's him
[1:05:47] that's making it go it's him that's
[1:05:49] making it happen amen it's not us making
[1:05:51] it happen we're just speaking according
[1:05:53] to the word and according to the unction
[1:05:54] of the holy spirit in our life amen we
[1:05:56] don't try and be anything
[1:05:58] you can't be it
[1:06:00] you just got to have it
[1:06:02] and god will work through you that's all
[1:06:04] he's doing he's just asking you to get
[1:06:05] out of the way i've been listening to
[1:06:06] that sermon perfect strength and perfect
[1:06:08] weakness all week and not all week it's
[1:06:11] only halfway through i guess but
[1:06:13] and the the the thing there's brother
[1:06:15] brown says listen anything you've got
[1:06:17] anything you've got whether you think
[1:06:19] it's godly good whatever throw it away
[1:06:22] completely and let god come in and then
[1:06:24] he can do something with you
[1:06:26] he had to take saul out on the back side
[1:06:28] of the desert for three years or three
[1:06:29] and a half years in saudi arabia he had
[1:06:31] to take moses out for 40.
[1:06:33] but yet he could take john the baptist
[1:06:35] out of out of there at an early age
[1:06:36] running around in the desert and bring
[1:06:37] him out and he was more than a prophet
[1:06:40] right and what did he do he looked
[1:06:41] horrible he was hairy he had on a camel
[1:06:43] skin he ate locusts and honey not
[1:06:45] exactly high society not exactly you
[1:06:47] know from a great theological seminar
[1:06:49] seminary or anything like that but
[1:06:51] that's the kind of men that god's
[1:06:52] looking for was he could take out he had
[1:06:54] to take out everything that they tried
[1:06:56] to put in there
[1:06:58] to the point where moses was a
[1:06:59] stammering man couldn't even speak
[1:07:01] properly
[1:07:02] but yet he'd go out and he would finally
[1:07:04] take up a stick and he'd go down and
[1:07:05] deliver israel with it because god had
[1:07:06] finally got everything out of him and
[1:07:08] brought him to a place where god could
[1:07:09] use him amen it's god that makes us what
[1:07:11] we are it's not us it's not us it's a
[1:07:14] work of grace we talked about that last
[1:07:16] time remember it's a work of grace and
[1:07:18] so it's all him and all we're doing is
[1:07:19] trying to set ourselves aside so that he
[1:07:21] can do something in us amen
[1:07:23] now listen some confessions require us
[1:07:25] to do actions
[1:07:27] then you can't say that i believe that
[1:07:28] god is going to financially support me
[1:07:30] and then go out and take a second job
[1:07:31] that keeps you out of church
[1:07:33] that's not a confession that god's
[1:07:35] looking for that's not an action to a
[1:07:36] confession that god's looking for
[1:07:38] because if you go out and you get a job
[1:07:39] that takes you out of the word then
[1:07:41] that's not going to be that that's not
[1:07:42] the the moving of god that's not the
[1:07:44] provision of god god didn't open that
[1:07:46] door for you did he
[1:07:47] if all of a sudden brother john starts
[1:07:48] to miss church because he took on a
[1:07:49] second job because he needs to build a
[1:07:51] garage next to his house that's not the
[1:07:53] that's not the provision of god that's
[1:07:54] not my faith in god doing that amen my
[1:07:57] fa my actions have to line up with the
[1:07:58] word amen amen amen so if you're looking
[1:08:01] for financial improvements then you need
[1:08:03] to be faithfully in church don't you
[1:08:05] right you don't go and take a second job
[1:08:06] you don't take on extra hours in these
[1:08:07] things you you stick true to the kingdom
[1:08:09] of god first and everything else will be
[1:08:11] added to you
[1:08:12] brett brown says as a minister i've seen
[1:08:14] just as many quack ministers as i have
[1:08:16] doctors too
[1:08:17] anything that don't believe in god's
[1:08:19] word to me is a quack that's right
[1:08:21] you're willing to stand out and take the
[1:08:22] word the way it is and and say it's
[1:08:24] right or wrong true now believe god have
[1:08:28] faith in god and when the inspiration of
[1:08:29] the holy spirit is here to inspire you
[1:08:31] remember god will make your body come
[1:08:33] into your confession
[1:08:35] watch this now if you say you're a
[1:08:37] drunkard and want to drink don't worry
[1:08:40] you'll soon be one
[1:08:42] listen your faith can go both ways
[1:08:44] you can speak yourself into an unsafe
[1:08:46] condition in your head or you can speak
[1:08:49] yourself into a safe condition he says
[1:08:51] if you say you're a sinner and want a
[1:08:52] sin you'll be right into it
[1:08:54] if that's your confession if that's your
[1:08:56] thought process if that's where your
[1:08:57] attitude and mind are that's where
[1:08:59] you're going to end up
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] that's the way you'll act doesn't mean
[1:09:03] you're going to lose your salvation if
[1:09:04] you're truly a son or daughter of god
[1:09:06] but he says that's your your thoughts
[1:09:07] and your attitudes and your confessions
[1:09:09] gonna take you right where you're
[1:09:10] confessing
[1:09:11] but he says if you say you're a
[1:09:13] christian and believe it all along your
[1:09:15] testimony will bring you right into it
[1:09:17] if you believe in healing and believe
[1:09:19] that god has healed you confess it and
[1:09:21] god will make your body obey your
[1:09:22] confession for he's the high priest of
[1:09:24] your confession amen sitting at the
[1:09:26] right hand of the father now with his
[1:09:27] own blood to make intercessions for any
[1:09:29] confession upon anything that he died
[1:09:32] for faith has the right confession
[1:09:36] that's what he's looking for the right
[1:09:37] confession amen your confession points
[1:09:39] to what the warranty
[1:09:41] and the guarantor doesn't point to me it
[1:09:44] points to there and says that's what
[1:09:45] tells me that i've got a a a place i've
[1:09:48] got a a means of restoration of
[1:09:49] restitution for whatever it is that i
[1:09:51] need him and we're resting on the great
[1:09:53] warranty amen we're resting on the great
[1:09:55] warranty which is the word of god and
[1:09:57] we're going back to that and saying you
[1:09:58] gave me the warranty and i'm just asking
[1:10:00] you to obey i'm asking you to honor the
[1:10:02] warranty that you've given me and
[1:10:04] brother bram says god loves to have his
[1:10:05] word repeated back to him
[1:10:07] he loves it when you read from the
[1:10:08] warranty booklet
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:11] but you ever notice with warranties
[1:10:13] if you don't maintain your vehicle you
[1:10:15] can null and void the warranty
[1:10:17] do you know you can do that with the
[1:10:18] promises of god too guess what children
[1:10:20] don't children of god sons of god they
[1:10:22] don't just walk around claiming warranty
[1:10:24] work all the time they've been abusing
[1:10:26] it
[1:10:27] guess what
[1:10:28] they get a spanking don't they
[1:10:30] right you don't get a free fix you're
[1:10:31] going to pay for this repair aren't you
[1:10:33] because you didn't water it you didn't
[1:10:34] do anything you abused your
[1:10:36] walk
[1:10:37] and now you're asking for him to repair
[1:10:38] and he says okay
[1:10:40] there's grace there's a lot of grace
[1:10:42] more grace than we deserve but guess
[1:10:43] what we're going to pay a price when we
[1:10:44] abuse it
[1:10:46] that's for sure
[1:10:48] amen but yet
[1:10:49] it's backed by what his own blood
[1:10:52] right you're not looking to yourself
[1:10:54] you're claiming the blood every time
[1:10:56] every time you make a mistake
[1:10:58] maybe you put a ding in your christian
[1:11:00] reputation
[1:11:01] you're saying i claim the blood
[1:11:03] he says we'll do a warranty repair on
[1:11:04] that then
[1:11:05] do you know some dealerships will do a
[1:11:07] grace warranty well let's say you've
[1:11:09] been a good customer
[1:11:11] you've maintained it you've done all
[1:11:12] your maintenance here and we see you
[1:11:14] every couple of months and we know you
[1:11:16] take care of your vehicles we'll take
[1:11:17] care of this one free of charge even
[1:11:18] though it's outside of the warranty
[1:11:21] god's gracious to us he's gracious to us
[1:11:23] amen above and beyond what we could ever
[1:11:25] ask or think
[1:11:26] now listen paul speaking here of the law
[1:11:28] being a shadow of good things to come
[1:11:30] could never make the worshiper perfect
[1:11:33] then he goes on to show what the
[1:11:34] perfection is now it's a strange thing
[1:11:36] that this is so much thought of with
[1:11:37] people they say well i'm weak my faith
[1:11:39] is not very much i'm not a very good
[1:11:41] christian
[1:11:42] he says that's just what the devil wants
[1:11:44] you to say you're talking his language
[1:11:46] right then see you mustn't never say
[1:11:48] that don't never let your testimony be
[1:11:50] negative let it be positive all the time
[1:11:53] i'm saved i have god in my heart i
[1:11:55] believe him with all my heart
[1:11:57] they says do you believe in divine
[1:11:58] healing with all of my heart then let
[1:12:00] your testimony always and your thoughts
[1:12:02] everything never permit a negative
[1:12:04] thought to come in your mind if you can
[1:12:06] help it
[1:12:07] remember remember he talked about he'd
[1:12:08] say you can you can't stop birds from
[1:12:10] flying over your head but you can stop
[1:12:12] them from building the nest
[1:12:13] right
[1:12:14] he says when it starts like that don't
[1:12:16] entertain it well you say i can't oh
[1:12:18] it's right here i can't help the
[1:12:20] thoughts from coming sometimes i get
[1:12:21] ahead of myself see he says will that be
[1:12:23] like the farmer said he couldn't stop
[1:12:24] the birds from flying over his place but
[1:12:26] he could sure stop them from roosting so
[1:12:28] that's a good thing you see you can't
[1:12:29] help the thoughts when they come but
[1:12:30] don't entertain them just pass it on no
[1:12:33] sir jesus christ is my savior all things
[1:12:36] are mine by god and i'm going to keep
[1:12:37] them and i'm going to testify of them he
[1:12:39] says and god can only bless you as you
[1:12:42] confess that he has done it for you
[1:12:46] see he's the high priest of our
[1:12:47] confession is that right hebrews 3 he
[1:12:50] said that he's the high priest of our
[1:12:51] confession he can only do for us as we
[1:12:53] accept it
[1:12:54] believe it
[1:12:56] and confess it
[1:12:58] so i read that to say this don't fret
[1:13:00] about time
[1:13:02] don't fret about how long things are
[1:13:03] taking
[1:13:04] if you expected it to be short and it's
[1:13:06] taking a long time don't worry about it
[1:13:08] if you're not seeing any movement if
[1:13:09] you're not seeing any changes don't
[1:13:11] worry about it
[1:13:12] right he's saying you just confess
[1:13:14] except believe and confess that's all
[1:13:15] the believers required to do amen
[1:13:20] like we read before don't dig up your
[1:13:21] experience with god
[1:13:23] don't dig up the promises of god don't
[1:13:25] dig up your healing and compare it with
[1:13:26] your old condition and your new
[1:13:28] condition and these different things
[1:13:29] don't dig up your deliverance don't go
[1:13:31] to where you used to be tempted and say
[1:13:32] well i'm gonna see if i'm still tempted
[1:13:34] don't do that that's tempting god and
[1:13:35] it's tempting yourself and it'll destroy
[1:13:37] your faith don't do it
[1:13:39] second timothy one says for god had not
[1:13:41] given us the spirit of fear but a power
[1:13:43] and of love and of a sound mind be thou
[1:13:46] thou therefore ashamed of the testimony
[1:13:48] of our lord nor me of his prisoner but
[1:13:50] be thou partaker of the afflictions of
[1:13:52] the gospel according to the power of god
[1:13:54] who has saved us and called us with a
[1:13:56] holy calling where are you there
[1:13:58] on the receiving end
[1:14:01] not according to our works
[1:14:03] where are you
[1:14:04] no part in it
[1:14:05] he says but according to his own purpose
[1:14:08] and grace which was given in us in
[1:14:09] christ jesus before the world began but
[1:14:12] is now made manifest by the appearing of
[1:14:14] our savior jesus christ who had
[1:14:16] abolished death and hath brought life
[1:14:19] and immortality to light through the
[1:14:20] gospel in you
[1:14:22] in you
[1:14:23] that's where it's made it's made light
[1:14:25] in you
[1:14:26] it's not just christ christ has gone on
[1:14:28] in the sense that he was here but now
[1:14:29] it's made light in you
[1:14:31] he says where am where unto i'm
[1:14:33] appointed a preacher and an apostle and
[1:14:35] a teacher of the gentiles for the which
[1:14:37] cause i also suffer these things
[1:14:39] nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know
[1:14:42] whom i have believed and have persuaded
[1:14:45] that he is able to keep that which i
[1:14:47] have committed unto him against that day
[1:14:52] that's the believer's confession
[1:14:54] so what have you committed to him you've
[1:14:56] committed your finances you've committed
[1:14:58] your relationships you've committed your
[1:14:59] career you've committed your education
[1:15:01] you've committed your ministry you've
[1:15:03] committed your weight whatever it might
[1:15:04] be when you commit it to him then you
[1:15:06] have to believe like paul says and says
[1:15:08] i've committed that to him against the
[1:15:10] day that he brings it to pass
[1:15:12] and i leave it in his hands and i don't
[1:15:14] have to worry about it anymore
[1:15:16] because why i've committed it
[1:15:18] when you commit something
[1:15:20] to someone else you don't have it in
[1:15:22] your hands anymore that's right right
[1:15:24] when a father comes and he gives his
[1:15:26] daughter away in marriage he doesn't put
[1:15:27] his hands on her anymore does he he's
[1:15:29] committed her to another man's
[1:15:30] caretaking
[1:15:32] and so when we do what when we cast our
[1:15:34] cares upon him
[1:15:35] make sure they're cast on him
[1:15:37] make sure you let go of it
[1:15:39] make sure you give it to him don't say
[1:15:42] help me with it give it to him
[1:15:44] cast your care on him that means pick it
[1:15:46] up and heave it over let it go
[1:15:49] don't try and do it yourself just say
[1:15:51] lord i'm committing it to you and
[1:15:53] believing that you'll take care of the
[1:15:54] need because your word says that you
[1:15:56] would do it amen what is it perfect
[1:15:58] strength and perfect weakness when you
[1:15:59] give it over to him the results are
[1:16:01] completely up to him
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:05] and i want to talk a bit about this
[1:16:06] faith to receive that we were speaking
[1:16:08] of earlier in matthew 17 20 says verily
[1:16:10] i say unto you if you have faith as a
[1:16:12] grain of mustard seed you shall say unto
[1:16:14] this mountain remove hence the yonder
[1:16:16] place and it shall remove and nothing
[1:16:18] shall be impossible to you now remember
[1:16:20] we we spoke last time and then brother
[1:16:22] joe had some of the exact same quotes i
[1:16:24] did on that mustard seed and it's
[1:16:26] brother brown says it's the smallest
[1:16:27] seed there is that's right
[1:16:29] for for you know the type of a plant
[1:16:32] that is right it's not a big c it's not
[1:16:33] like an acorn or a walnut you know these
[1:16:35] big things real hefty chunky things but
[1:16:37] we we read the quote and it was amazing
[1:16:39] that you can't hybrid you can't
[1:16:41] crossbreed a mustard seed with anything
[1:16:43] else you can't blend it and that's what
[1:16:45] makes it perfect for faith is that it
[1:16:47] only has one component
[1:16:49] right you don't add to it you don't take
[1:16:51] away from it it's only going to be
[1:16:53] mustard seed no matter what and that's
[1:16:55] why brothers that's why why jesus uses
[1:16:57] it that way it's small but it can't
[1:16:59] pure it can't compromise its purity
[1:17:02] even if it wants to it can't
[1:17:05] a mustard seed can't say well i'd like
[1:17:07] to crossbreed with something so i'll do
[1:17:08] it no no it cannot do it it is forbidden
[1:17:11] to do it it is incapable of being
[1:17:12] crossbred and brother and jesus said
[1:17:14] that's what your faith is supposed to be
[1:17:16] like you have to have faith that isn't
[1:17:18] hybrid with something else amen you
[1:17:19] don't take it and blend it with your
[1:17:21] humanity and god's sovereignty you can't
[1:17:23] do it with your human elements and and
[1:17:25] gifts and power and these different
[1:17:26] strengths in these different things and
[1:17:28] then try and blend god in with it it's
[1:17:29] going to be god or it's going to be you
[1:17:30] and that's it
[1:17:31] amen if it's you then god's not in there
[1:17:33] and if it's god then you can't be in
[1:17:34] there either
[1:17:36] he says now i haven't got much faith
[1:17:38] brother branham did you hear him say if
[1:17:40] you got faith the size of a mustard seed
[1:17:42] a mustard seed faith won't perform a
[1:17:44] miracle but if you hold to it it'll
[1:17:46] bring you out just anchor to it that's
[1:17:49] it see it's not about how big you start
[1:17:51] out
[1:17:53] that's kind of what we're thinking so
[1:17:54] many times and and i i don't think i'll
[1:17:56] ever get to the quotes but brother brown
[1:17:58] says we we think we've got to have
[1:17:59] supernatural faith and we go looking for
[1:18:01] supernatural faith and he says faith is
[1:18:03] common faith is like he says the hyssop
[1:18:06] remember it was like the hyssop and
[1:18:07] that's just a weed he says it's a common
[1:18:09] weed and faith is the same for big
[1:18:11] things and small things it's common you
[1:18:12] just take it and go do it
[1:18:14] right and that's what we're looking for
[1:18:16] here is it's not about the size it's
[1:18:17] whether or not you can believe and
[1:18:19] you'll move forward with it he says the
[1:18:21] mustard seed faith the tiny little start
[1:18:23] he says it'll take you through if you
[1:18:24] don't blend it with anything else if
[1:18:26] you've got something that won't blend
[1:18:27] it'll take you all the way to where you
[1:18:28] need to go
[1:18:30] amen what is it but it takes faith to
[1:18:32] say lord i'm not going to try and stick
[1:18:33] my oar in the water i'm not going to try
[1:18:35] and steer the ship i'm not going to try
[1:18:37] and drive the car lord i'm going to
[1:18:38] trust you to do this the way that you
[1:18:40] said the way that you want to do it and
[1:18:42] i'm just holding to the promise that
[1:18:43] i'll get to where you said we were going
[1:18:44] to go
[1:18:45] if i'm going to go to clarenville and
[1:18:46] god's driving then guess what my trust
[1:18:48] is we're getting to clarenville doesn't
[1:18:50] matter which route we take it's up to
[1:18:51] him to determine the route but i'll get
[1:18:53] to clarenville eventually if i let him
[1:18:54] drive me
[1:18:55] right
[1:18:56] it's like we said before you put that
[1:18:58] word promise and that word promised seed
[1:19:00] in the right environment you just wait
[1:19:02] guess what there's some seeds that take
[1:19:04] months to sprout
[1:19:07] and there's some that come up almost
[1:19:08] overnight
[1:19:09] and that's the way it is in our in our
[1:19:11] lives and guess what that's the
[1:19:12] sovereignty of god that sometimes it's
[1:19:14] immediate and then sometimes it's
[1:19:16] it's not immediate
[1:19:18] that's the easiest way to put it isn't
[1:19:19] it
[1:19:20] but in the right environment in the
[1:19:21] right atmosphere a sea will come up if
[1:19:23] it's a good seed every single time
[1:19:25] but the brown puts it this way he says
[1:19:26] and so the so is the word of god if a
[1:19:29] person can take that word and place it
[1:19:30] in their heart give it the right
[1:19:32] sunshine the right temperature not s-u-n
[1:19:34] but capital s-o-n and right temperature
[1:19:37] of faith in there that seed and promise
[1:19:39] will live to you just like it did at the
[1:19:41] beginning to the one it was given to
[1:19:43] because it's god's word and he's the
[1:19:45] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:19:47] cannot fail
[1:19:48] now the thing is with the people is the
[1:19:50] way god appears many times listen to
[1:19:52] this many times we want to make an idol
[1:19:55] out of god
[1:19:56] we ask god to do something and then he
[1:19:59] must do it just the way we ask it or
[1:20:01] we'll say he never answered because
[1:20:03] that's the way they used to go with
[1:20:04] idols was they go to the island they say
[1:20:06] this is what i want this is the way i
[1:20:07] want it
[1:20:08] but he says that's not that's not the
[1:20:10] god's not an idol like that we don't go
[1:20:12] and tell him how to do it
[1:20:14] he says when we do that we weaken our
[1:20:16] faith in god because we're telling them
[1:20:17] how to do it
[1:20:18] he says you tell him what your need is
[1:20:20] and let him sort it out
[1:20:22] he says we weaken our testimony when we
[1:20:24] do not take him at his word because
[1:20:26] we're looking for it to happen a certain
[1:20:27] way and it doesn't happen that way or it
[1:20:29] isn't going that way and all of a sudden
[1:20:31] our face starts to weaken because we had
[1:20:33] a an expectation in our lives and an
[1:20:35] expectation in our hearts of how this
[1:20:36] was going to go and then it didn't go
[1:20:38] that way
[1:20:39] and then our face starts to drop and we
[1:20:40] say well i guess i was wrong or i guess
[1:20:42] i don't believe or i guess i don't have
[1:20:43] faith or you start to doubt your walk
[1:20:45] with god and he's never thinks he says
[1:20:46] no no you've turned god into an idol
[1:20:48] when you do that he says tell him the
[1:20:49] need confess your faith that he will
[1:20:51] deliver the need and then you go on and
[1:20:53] let him do it however he wants to
[1:20:55] i like how he says here that seed and
[1:20:57] promise because many times we we say
[1:20:59] well i believe and that means it's over
[1:21:00] with
[1:21:02] but that's not the way it looks amen
[1:21:04] here
[1:21:05] and matthew 13 verse 18 says hear ye
[1:21:08] therefore the parable of the sower when
[1:21:10] anyone heareth the word of the kingdom
[1:21:12] and understandeth it not
[1:21:14] then cometh the wicked one and catches
[1:21:16] the way that which was sown in his heart
[1:21:18] this is he which receives seed by the
[1:21:20] wayside so he's saying listen this is
[1:21:22] the word this is the the word promises
[1:21:24] whatever it might be anything in the
[1:21:25] word in this kind of a life it didn't
[1:21:27] even germinate
[1:21:28] it just laid on the ground and nothing
[1:21:31] happened and then the the birds came and
[1:21:32] took it away right there was no
[1:21:34] revelation there was no understanding it
[1:21:36] didn't even start and so it died right
[1:21:38] there
[1:21:40] he says in verse 20 but he that received
[1:21:42] the seed
[1:21:46] he that received the seed into stony
[1:21:48] places the same is he that heareth the
[1:21:50] word and a numb with joy receive it now
[1:21:53] watch this
[1:21:54] yet because he had no root in himself
[1:21:57] but matter can't get that next one yet
[1:21:59] when he had not rooted himself but
[1:22:01] endureth for a while
[1:22:03] then for when tribulation or persecution
[1:22:05] arises because of the word by and by he
[1:22:08] is offended so he went from ground where
[1:22:11] nothing happened to background where it
[1:22:13] goes in and it starts something but
[1:22:16] because it's so stony it can't take a
[1:22:18] root and so what happens is eventually
[1:22:22] this is a heart that's unsoftened by the
[1:22:23] presence of god is what it is
[1:22:25] it's unsoftened it's hard ground there's
[1:22:27] nothing prepared amen it's resistant to
[1:22:29] change it's unwelcome to life
[1:22:32] he says he also that received seed among
[1:22:34] the thorns is he that heareth the word
[1:22:37] and the care of this world and the
[1:22:38] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[1:22:41] and he becomes unfruitful
[1:22:43] he's casual and unsanctified
[1:22:46] but he that receives seed into the
[1:22:48] ground good ground is he that hears the
[1:22:50] word and understands it which also
[1:22:52] beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a
[1:22:54] hundredfold some 60 and some 30. now i
[1:22:58] want you to catch something here
[1:23:00] the only thing that mattered was the
[1:23:01] ground
[1:23:02] the seed was the same in every situation
[1:23:05] the seed was good seed the seed could
[1:23:07] bring forth life it could bring forth
[1:23:09] fruit but the only difference was the
[1:23:10] kind of ground it was planted in
[1:23:12] and you're the one that determines that
[1:23:14] as in it's your life that determines
[1:23:16] what kind of life is going to come out
[1:23:17] it's your heart that's going to
[1:23:18] determine it's the ground that you've
[1:23:19] got prepared inside of you that's going
[1:23:21] to determine how this goes in your life
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:24] amen because there's a word there's a
[1:23:26] place prepared for the word
[1:23:29] right there's a place prepared a body
[1:23:30] has to prepare for me that's what he's
[1:23:32] got here is he's got a place prepared
[1:23:34] for the word but guess what you do have
[1:23:35] an influence on this you do have an
[1:23:37] effect because guess what the same seed
[1:23:39] brought forth a hundredfold and some 60
[1:23:41] and others and 30 and others they all
[1:23:43] brought forth fruit but some brought
[1:23:44] forth more
[1:23:46] why
[1:23:47] well look at what the effects look at
[1:23:49] what it is that that that that has an
[1:23:51] effect on this because it's speaking
[1:23:53] about the word and it's affecting our
[1:23:54] lives
[1:23:55] and that first one says that what it
[1:23:57] can't just be surface
[1:23:59] what is surface word it's a covering
[1:24:03] it's religion
[1:24:04] right it has to be in you it can't just
[1:24:06] be on you it can't just be something
[1:24:08] that you put on when you go to church or
[1:24:09] when you're around believers it's got to
[1:24:10] be something in you coming out amen the
[1:24:12] sir the word seed has to be planted
[1:24:15] inside of your life because otherwise
[1:24:16] one little temptation one little issue
[1:24:18] and satan will come and pluck that word
[1:24:20] right out of your life why because it's
[1:24:21] on you it's not in you you've got to get
[1:24:23] it buried deep where that a bird can't
[1:24:25] get to it
[1:24:26] but he says what then you have the one
[1:24:28] that what is is is surrounded by the the
[1:24:31] cares of this world and and sorry
[1:24:33] surrounded by the thorns
[1:24:35] and that's what that's the people you
[1:24:37] hang around with right it's the friends
[1:24:38] you have it's the acquaintances you have
[1:24:40] it's it's where you spend your time and
[1:24:42] how you spend your time that matters
[1:24:45] that matters it matters who your friends
[1:24:47] are it matters how you spend your time
[1:24:48] amen and guess what it's always a
[1:24:50] one-way street of influence
[1:24:52] and guess what if you're not influencing
[1:24:54] them they're influencing you whether you
[1:24:56] recognize it or not if you're around
[1:24:57] worldly people if you're around
[1:24:59] denominational believers if you're
[1:25:00] around people that don't believe the
[1:25:01] truth of this hour there's only one way
[1:25:03] that influence goes and it's one way you
[1:25:06] are then and if they're not changing and
[1:25:08] if they're not seeing anything then
[1:25:09] guess what you're the one that's being
[1:25:10] changed even if you don't realize it
[1:25:12] that's why the scripture says how can
[1:25:14] two walk together unless they agree
[1:25:17] somebody's got to be agreeing for you to
[1:25:18] be walking together
[1:25:20] make sure they're agreeing with you
[1:25:21] because if they're not then you better
[1:25:22] get out of that quick quick quick amen
[1:25:26] and then the third thing is that your
[1:25:27] life needs to be christ-centered because
[1:25:29] it talks about the cares of this world
[1:25:30] the deceitfulness of riches what is it
[1:25:32] you've gotten caught up in this lao to
[1:25:34] see in age haven't you and you've gotten
[1:25:36] caught up in in in the cares of life and
[1:25:38] you're getting caught up in your houses
[1:25:40] and your vehicles and your jobs and your
[1:25:41] careers and your education and all these
[1:25:43] different things and what does it do
[1:25:46] chokes out the word
[1:25:48] takes out you know what it does it takes
[1:25:49] away the joy of your salvation and it
[1:25:51] takes away the same mind that christ has
[1:25:53] given you forget your place in christ
[1:25:56] that's what happens when you do this
[1:25:57] amen listen what he's saying is let your
[1:26:00] let your work be for the kingdom of god
[1:26:02] because guess what riches have nothing
[1:26:04] to do with the kingdom of god if we're
[1:26:06] seeking riches then we're lost
[1:26:08] right the love of money is the root of
[1:26:10] all evil and if you're living your life
[1:26:12] for money that means your love you're
[1:26:14] loving the money that's that's the thing
[1:26:15] that you're focused on amen but what's
[1:26:17] he saying is he's saying get focused on
[1:26:18] the kingdom of god
[1:26:20] amen when when i'm tired out
[1:26:23] i ought to be tired out because i did
[1:26:24] something for the king of god when i
[1:26:26] stay up late it ought to be because i'm
[1:26:27] doing something for the king of god when
[1:26:29] i'm spent and can't give any more it
[1:26:31] ought to be because i've done something
[1:26:32] for the kingdom of god amen
[1:26:34] not because i'm doing something for
[1:26:36] myself or or or for for you know riches
[1:26:39] in this world or for for prestige or
[1:26:41] these different things it should be
[1:26:43] something for the kingdom of god amen
[1:26:45] your experience will get choked out you
[1:26:47] may not lose your salvation though
[1:26:49] because this can happen in a believer's
[1:26:51] life no matter what that's why you only
[1:26:53] bring forth 30-fold it's because you
[1:26:55] haven't been rooting the weeds out as
[1:26:56] they've been coming up it was to do it
[1:26:58] takes away some of the richness of the
[1:26:59] soil it takes the nutrients out it takes
[1:27:01] that away and so all of a sudden you can
[1:27:02] only produce 30-fold because something
[1:27:04] else is getting some of the life that
[1:27:05] was supposed to be going into you
[1:27:08] prophet of god puts it this way now
[1:27:09] remember we're talking about faith to
[1:27:10] receive he says see it just goes to show
[1:27:13] give the best you have give your life
[1:27:16] give your time give everything to christ
[1:27:19] and that same spirit that lived in
[1:27:21] christ lives in you and your influence
[1:27:23] in your neighborhood and upon the people
[1:27:24] you deal with will be so much like
[1:27:26] christ till it'll work the same things
[1:27:28] that christ did
[1:27:29] he says finally it'll come to pass that
[1:27:31] the people laid in the shadows and was
[1:27:33] healed he said that's right
[1:27:35] just so much power of love around them
[1:27:38] and they said that when saint martin was
[1:27:39] preaching after he come out of this
[1:27:40] lesser robe that entire congregation
[1:27:43] noticed a glow of light all around him
[1:27:45] uh-huh see because he had done the right
[1:27:47] thing
[1:27:48] now listen to this
[1:27:51] always do right
[1:27:53] that's your duty to god
[1:27:54] what is right
[1:27:56] obey the word amen
[1:27:58] that's very simple obey the word
[1:28:01] that's your duty to god then he says
[1:28:03] think right
[1:28:04] that's your duty to yourself
[1:28:07] and you've got to come out right he says
[1:28:09] that's right you just have to he says if
[1:28:10] you'd do right and think right he says
[1:28:13] you've got to come out right amen
[1:28:15] no sir he says do right that's your duty
[1:28:18] to god live by the word speak the word
[1:28:19] confess the word don't be a talker only
[1:28:21] but be a doer also amen we don't want to
[1:28:23] be talkers only that's religion we want
[1:28:25] to be doers because that's the life of a
[1:28:27] believer right but then he says think
[1:28:29] right that's your duty to yourself in
[1:28:31] other words choose how you spend your
[1:28:33] thinking time and we talked about that
[1:28:35] earlier right choose what you dwell on
[1:28:37] choose what sticks around in your head
[1:28:39] you know i found that if i'm thinking
[1:28:41] the wrong kind of things i'm getting
[1:28:42] caught up in a situation i'm getting
[1:28:44] caught up in drama i'm getting caught up
[1:28:46] in people's actions and reactions you
[1:28:48] know what i do
[1:28:49] i sing a song in my head or if i'm in
[1:28:51] the car i sing it out loud
[1:28:53] that's the best way i know how to do it
[1:28:54] because guess what you can't dwell on
[1:28:55] thoughts while you're singing a song
[1:28:57] so if you want a tip from brother john
[1:28:59] sing a song
[1:29:01] you're not where you're supposed to be
[1:29:02] in your head sing a song praise and
[1:29:04] worship you can sit there and read your
[1:29:05] bible and get distracted you sing a song
[1:29:07] it's very hard to think the wrong
[1:29:08] thoughts and guess what you'll start to
[1:29:10] praise and it'll start to turn into
[1:29:11] another song and another song and all of
[1:29:13] a sudden that thought's gone away
[1:29:14] because what you put yourself back into
[1:29:16] the praise and presence of god amen amen
[1:29:19] very simple very simple that's not high
[1:29:21] and spiritual but it works for me maybe
[1:29:23] it'll work for you
[1:29:24] and i sing in the shower every morning
[1:29:27] in my head often
[1:29:29] why because it gets me in the right
[1:29:31] attitude gets me in the right atmosphere
[1:29:33] what is singing half the time it's a
[1:29:34] confession half the time we're singing
[1:29:36] praises to god we're thanking him for
[1:29:38] things we're we're talking about the
[1:29:39] word we're talking about the good things
[1:29:40] of god amen and it gets you into a place
[1:29:43] where your attitude's set right for the
[1:29:44] day
[1:29:45] and what all of a sudden you're
[1:29:47] expecting things to be a little better
[1:29:48] than maybe you went into that shower
[1:29:49] with before you start walked out that
[1:29:51] door to eat your breakfast your mind has
[1:29:53] changed because you're in a different
[1:29:54] mood now you've got a different
[1:29:55] atmosphere because you're not letting
[1:29:56] those thoughts get in there and
[1:29:58] and roost as brother braham says or
[1:30:00] build a nest amen
[1:30:02] and then you want to get to the place
[1:30:03] where you're expecting the result that
[1:30:04] god promised rather than thinking about
[1:30:06] the situations and the failures and the
[1:30:08] people that are going to cause you
[1:30:09] problems in it
[1:30:11] because what there's always going to be
[1:30:13] an internal work that nobody sees before
[1:30:15] there's an external work that everyone
[1:30:17] sees
[1:30:18] that's the principle here is that god
[1:30:19] doesn't work on the inside before he
[1:30:21] ever does a work on the outside listen
[1:30:23] you don't have people that go get
[1:30:24] delivered you know they they they don't
[1:30:26] they don't get delivered from drugs and
[1:30:27] then come to the lord do they
[1:30:29] they come to the lord and then he
[1:30:30] delivers them from drugs and it'll often
[1:30:32] be like that but it's because there was
[1:30:33] an internal work before there was an
[1:30:35] external work and god always deals with
[1:30:36] the heart of men before he deals with
[1:30:38] the exterior because otherwise what
[1:30:39] we've got a facade we've got a false
[1:30:41] front we've got a religion if all we're
[1:30:43] concerned about is what's on the outside
[1:30:44] and there's nothing changing on the
[1:30:45] inside and nobody knows more about the
[1:30:47] inside of jonathan than jonathan
[1:30:50] i know my thoughts i know my attitudes i
[1:30:51] know my cynicism i know my failures and
[1:30:54] guess what each one of us does and so we
[1:30:55] ought to be looking for that inward
[1:30:57] change that inward life that can now
[1:30:59] come out and we talked about that
[1:31:00] overflow last time amen
[1:31:02] listen people that make it through
[1:31:03] extreme circumstances very difficult
[1:31:05] trials that show great moments of faith
[1:31:07] they aren't hopping and skipping through
[1:31:09] life and all of a sudden they just do
[1:31:10] these things or go through these things
[1:31:12] this is built by day in and day out
[1:31:14] being in the presence of god setting the
[1:31:16] right atmosphere feeding on the right
[1:31:17] things having the right fellowships
[1:31:18] having the right relationships feeding
[1:31:20] on the word of god going to god with
[1:31:22] their problems rather than going to
[1:31:23] people
[1:31:24] right it's something that's built up
[1:31:26] over time and then god puts them through
[1:31:27] a test i talk about the gym a lot i go
[1:31:29] to the gym guess what if i got to lift
[1:31:31] 300 pounds you know how i get to 300
[1:31:33] pounds i lift 100 pounds then 120 then
[1:31:36] the next week 140 and then the next week
[1:31:37] 150 and i build there by 10 pounds a
[1:31:39] week until i get to 300. i don't go 100
[1:31:42] to 300 and i don't just walk into the
[1:31:44] gym and lift 300 pounds that's how you
[1:31:46] hurt your back and not make it to church
[1:31:48] right
[1:31:49] you go too far too fast and you don't do
[1:31:51] it and you hurt yourself while you're
[1:31:53] doing it god builds us up to these
[1:31:55] things don't expect great faith if
[1:31:57] you're not having him build you up day
[1:31:58] by day if you're not putting your time
[1:32:00] into your relationship with him don't
[1:32:02] expect great faith to receive great
[1:32:03] results
[1:32:04] because why it's building up it's
[1:32:06] raising the level of your faith and it's
[1:32:07] based on your relationship and your
[1:32:09] revelation of him and your life not just
[1:32:11] the word on a piece of paper
[1:32:13] it's got to be personal to you amen now
[1:32:16] it might start all of a sudden
[1:32:18] but i remember i mean i've said it many
[1:32:19] times over the pulpit i was under
[1:32:21] conviction from the age of 10 but i
[1:32:22] didn't give my life to christ until 17.
[1:32:24] and for all external you know viewings
[1:32:27] of my life and brother gerald's
[1:32:28] testified to this i sat there and i
[1:32:30] watched but i didn't blink and i didn't
[1:32:31] show any response to the word for seven
[1:32:33] years but yet inside there was a roiling
[1:32:35] going on there was a building up there
[1:32:37] was a conviction that was there and then
[1:32:38] in one moment boom jonathan collette
[1:32:41] gave his life to the lord but it was
[1:32:42] seven years of agony and what god
[1:32:44] working under the surface
[1:32:47] to bring out that life
[1:32:49] at the age of 17 right
[1:32:51] there's something that's going on in
[1:32:52] these situations right
[1:32:55] something built slowly is something
[1:32:56] that's common irregular in your life
[1:32:59] that's why it builds up is because every
[1:33:01] single day you're adding a brick listen
[1:33:03] it's way better to add a brick every day
[1:33:05] than to try and put 30
[1:33:07] every couple months you know you try and
[1:33:08] do a bunch and guess what you don't do a
[1:33:10] very good job of it because you're not
[1:33:11] used to laying bricks but you do it
[1:33:12] every day just do one or two a day
[1:33:14] pretty soon you got a house built and
[1:33:15] it's built perfectly it doesn't just go
[1:33:17] up in a rush right you can't go from a
[1:33:19] foundation to a fully built house in
[1:33:21] three days you build it up over time and
[1:33:23] god's the same way with us
[1:33:25] now i want to talk a bit just as we
[1:33:27] start to go towards closing about being
[1:33:29] in that right channel and attitude
[1:33:31] for this for holding on and building
[1:33:33] this faith to receive brother brahm's
[1:33:35] speaking of abraham and he says you know
[1:33:36] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:33:39] you believe that
[1:33:41] do you believe that
[1:33:42] do you believe you're led by this by the
[1:33:44] spirit of god
[1:33:45] if you don't you're going to have some
[1:33:47] real struggles amen
[1:33:49] lead you into things and you got to know
[1:33:50] he led you in there you didn't walk into
[1:33:52] it of your own will you didn't walk into
[1:33:54] it of your own desires but he brought
[1:33:55] you into these things
[1:33:56] he says then while he was sitting there
[1:33:58] thinking of the time that god appeared
[1:33:59] to him in the name of the almighty the
[1:34:01] el shaddai the bosom the breasts of the
[1:34:03] woman the strength giver he says now you
[1:34:05] notice the word is a compound word which
[1:34:07] means shadai not a breast but breasted
[1:34:10] too he was wounded for our
[1:34:12] transgressions and with his stripes we
[1:34:13] were healed he says oh i'm so glad of
[1:34:15] that either promise of god's breast he's
[1:34:17] the strong one the strength giver if
[1:34:20] you're abraham an old man 99 years old
[1:34:22] he said abraham i'm the breasted god
[1:34:24] just lay a hold of my promise and nurse
[1:34:27] your strength from me
[1:34:28] he says that's what it is to every
[1:34:30] believer that'll take god's word and
[1:34:32] don't doubt it but just hold on to it
[1:34:34] and nurse your strength it's like the
[1:34:36] baby laying on the mother's bosom and
[1:34:38] the time it's nursing it's satisfied
[1:34:40] anybody that's had a baby knows that you
[1:34:42] can get a baby to nurse it doesn't
[1:34:43] matter how much pain it's been how how
[1:34:45] difficult life has been how cranky it's
[1:34:47] been if you can get it to nurse and it
[1:34:48] realizes that it's starting to feed
[1:34:50] it'll settle right down and as soon as
[1:34:52] it gets off it'll go right back to being
[1:34:53] cranky and horrible and you want to put
[1:34:55] it up for adoption but as long as it's
[1:34:57] latched to that mother it's satisfied it
[1:34:59] says be the same way be satisfied with
[1:35:02] god i'm seeing some of the sisters smile
[1:35:05] be satisfied stay latched to god
[1:35:08] amen
[1:35:09] he says nurse your strength he says what
[1:35:12] that's what it is to every believer
[1:35:13] that'll take god's word and don't doubt
[1:35:15] it but just hold on to it and nurse your
[1:35:17] strength it's like the baby laying on
[1:35:18] the mother's bosom all the time it's
[1:35:20] nursing it's satisfied and when a real
[1:35:22] christian can get a hold of a promise of
[1:35:24] god and believe it's for them you've got
[1:35:27] to believe it's for you
[1:35:29] not for your brother not for your sister
[1:35:31] you got to believe it's for you amen he
[1:35:33] says then he's satisfied while he's
[1:35:35] nursing the strength and coming he won't
[1:35:37] complain a bit he's just satisfied he
[1:35:39] says oh i love that satisfaction of
[1:35:42] knowing that god said so said so to what
[1:35:45] to me
[1:35:46] not just to brother mark not just a
[1:35:48] sister rebecca not just his sister lydia
[1:35:51] not just his sister brenda he said it to
[1:35:53] brother john as well
[1:35:54] right that's the satisfaction is it
[1:35:56] wasn't just for them but it's for me as
[1:35:57] well
[1:35:59] so what's he saying he's saying what
[1:36:00] you're feeding on is going to determine
[1:36:02] your attitude
[1:36:04] what you're latched on to is going to
[1:36:06] determine the result
[1:36:08] the the breast milk from a mother is
[1:36:10] that the best thing that you can give a
[1:36:12] baby they don't have a formula today can
[1:36:14] touch it
[1:36:15] they don't have a formula today can
[1:36:17] touch it
[1:36:18] it's the best thing you can give
[1:36:20] for at least the first six months of a
[1:36:22] baby's life it's the only thing they
[1:36:23] need it's the only thing they need you
[1:36:24] don't have to give them a single thing
[1:36:25] if they can just latch a nurse
[1:36:27] it's the same thing for us we can say
[1:36:29] latch to god you don't need anything
[1:36:30] else you don't need psychology you don't
[1:36:32] need to go out and do this and do that
[1:36:34] and everything you'll be satisfied with
[1:36:35] what he's offering amen
[1:36:38] but i want you to look cause we're gonna
[1:36:39] talk about attitude for a moment because
[1:36:41] attitude matters brother braham said the
[1:36:43] right mental attitude towards any
[1:36:45] promise of god will bring it to pass in
[1:36:46] your life
[1:36:48] he says well i see he's still talking
[1:36:49] about abraham
[1:36:52] this is in the message i believe is
[1:36:53] anything too hard for the lord
[1:36:56] he says well i see the angel takes his
[1:36:57] chair maybe remember so abraham's
[1:36:59] sitting and the three men came
[1:37:02] and they're sitting down and he leans
[1:37:04] his back towards the tent and sarah's
[1:37:05] listening through the tent you know kind
[1:37:07] of ear dropping you know listening
[1:37:08] through the tent and she was kind of in
[1:37:10] an awful mood that morning
[1:37:12] you don't see things when you come to
[1:37:14] church in that kind of a mood
[1:37:16] you just no need of trying it you just
[1:37:18] might as well have stayed home you won't
[1:37:19] get nothing out of it what's he saying
[1:37:21] attitude matters
[1:37:22] when you come to church come prayed up
[1:37:25] come in the atmosphere come expecting
[1:37:28] abraham knew that the time of the
[1:37:30] promise was coming close
[1:37:32] he was expecting it or he was a hundred
[1:37:34] years old he was expecting at any time
[1:37:37] he watched every minute
[1:37:39] every minute
[1:37:41] when he ran in he told sarah this i
[1:37:42] believe is our day of visitation she
[1:37:44] kind of looked at him with him big eyes
[1:37:46] and thought well abraham you've said
[1:37:47] that a long time
[1:37:49] but you know there will come a time when
[1:37:51] it'll be so if god said so amen
[1:37:55] let the day be the day and if it's not
[1:37:57] today let tomorrow be the day and if
[1:37:58] tomorrow's not the day then let the next
[1:37:59] be
[1:38:00] be the day that's what you say every day
[1:38:02] say lord i'm expecting it today
[1:38:06] she had herself all out of condition to
[1:38:08] receive it when god brought it amen
[1:38:11] he says oh my don't ever get that in
[1:38:13] your heart be open be ready she missed
[1:38:15] it she failed to see it and if we don't
[1:38:18] watch friends the church is going to
[1:38:19] fail to see it let's not look for church
[1:38:21] hairdos and new dresses let's look for
[1:38:24] the holy spirit to come in the
[1:38:25] supernatural and raise some things he
[1:38:27] says the church doesn't need a facelift
[1:38:29] it needs a birth the holy ghost to come
[1:38:31] into the church and bring back people
[1:38:33] that believes the supernatural and holds
[1:38:35] on and waiting for the coming of the
[1:38:37] lord as if it might be any hour and
[1:38:40] living in them conditions
[1:38:42] living in them conditions of what
[1:38:43] expectancy that it's going to happen
[1:38:47] he says here she was in that shape
[1:38:49] say now how could that happen in our
[1:38:51] modern time how could it happen to me in
[1:38:52] my condition
[1:38:54] but it happened just the same
[1:38:55] abraham out there was waiting with
[1:38:57] anticipation you see it wasn't made
[1:39:00] known to her it was made no to them who
[1:39:02] was looking for it
[1:39:04] that's the way it comes yet to those who
[1:39:06] are looking so he was watching abraham
[1:39:08] was he said yes my lord yes that's right
[1:39:10] the promise was and i believed it all
[1:39:12] along he said now abraham just about the
[1:39:14] time of life it will be each month well
[1:39:16] i'm going to visit you and you're going
[1:39:17] to have that baby and sarah you know
[1:39:20] herself when ha
[1:39:21] kind of laughed kind of to herself
[1:39:24] he says now watch abraham gets a sign
[1:39:26] now sarah was too frustrated too
[1:39:29] concerned about the new hairdo she'd
[1:39:30] seen or something else
[1:39:32] sometimes they're too much frustrated
[1:39:34] about the other fellow that's got the
[1:39:35] biggest denomination or his congregation
[1:39:37] dresses better than mine or they've got
[1:39:39] a bigger church down on the corner than
[1:39:40] we got he says what difference does that
[1:39:42] make
[1:39:43] that's probably not our issue here we
[1:39:45] got a small church but we're not looking
[1:39:47] at other churches probably but pick your
[1:39:48] poison
[1:39:50] what is it that gets you frustrated
[1:39:52] that gets your eyes off the promise
[1:39:54] he says what difference does that make i
[1:39:56] want god i don't care if i have to
[1:39:58] worship him on the street corner in a
[1:40:00] coal shed wherever it might be i want
[1:40:02] god let me have my heart and condition
[1:40:05] that if i wear overalls so i can watch
[1:40:07] god and see his move and recognize him
[1:40:10] not pass it by
[1:40:13] he recognized him he said my lord
[1:40:15] sarah never recognized him as my lord
[1:40:19] and i i
[1:40:20] i'll read this next one but i want to
[1:40:21] put a preface in here because for the
[1:40:23] sake of time i pulled out a section he
[1:40:25] says when sarah expressed her unbelief
[1:40:27] he said he should have killed her right
[1:40:29] then
[1:40:31] but he said he couldn't because she was
[1:40:33] a part of abraham
[1:40:35] that's why he didn't do it
[1:40:36] that's why he didn't because she was a
[1:40:37] part of abraham he says and lots of
[1:40:39] times our belief would destroy us if it
[1:40:42] wasn't for the blood of jesus christ god
[1:40:44] can't destroy us now because the blood
[1:40:46] of jesus christ keeps god off of us
[1:40:49] we're part of christ just as sarah was
[1:40:51] part of abraham for we are the bride of
[1:40:53] christ and we people who's born to the
[1:40:55] spirit of god ought to wake up get out
[1:40:57] of our stools and watch for the
[1:40:58] supernatural sign of the coming of the
[1:41:00] lord jesus his signs that he promised
[1:41:04] we're talking about an attitude and
[1:41:05] brother brahm says who's the one that
[1:41:07] has faith
[1:41:08] the one that's watching
[1:41:11] the one that has faith is the one that's
[1:41:12] watching the one that has faith is the
[1:41:14] one that's what in an attitude of
[1:41:16] expectation amen those that have a
[1:41:18] receiving attitude
[1:41:20] when it comes they're ready for it
[1:41:23] they're looking for it
[1:41:24] they're expecting it and so when it
[1:41:26] comes then they're right in the channel
[1:41:27] to accept it and move right on
[1:41:29] right if you're really expecting
[1:41:31] something you're going to be ready for
[1:41:33] it
[1:41:33] we had a if we had a football here this
[1:41:36] this evening and i knew that at some
[1:41:37] point in the service somebody was going
[1:41:39] to throw it at me you can guarantee that
[1:41:40] my hands are probably up here most of
[1:41:42] the service because what i'm in
[1:41:43] expectation that somebody's going to
[1:41:44] throw the football at me and i'm going
[1:41:45] to want to catch it i don't want to get
[1:41:47] hit upside the head on a live stream do
[1:41:49] i i'm going to be ready for it amen
[1:41:52] you ever been to a sporting event where
[1:41:53] somebody wanted something
[1:41:56] why do people go to a sporting event
[1:41:58] because they want to watch their team
[1:41:59] win
[1:42:00] and guess what they let it be known what
[1:42:02] they expect don't they
[1:42:04] when you go to a sporting event what are
[1:42:05] they doing they're yelling they're
[1:42:07] shouting when their team does something
[1:42:08] good when it's something they get close
[1:42:10] to scoring or whatever what do they do
[1:42:12] they jump up and they shout and they
[1:42:14] yell the other team comes close what do
[1:42:15] they do they boo
[1:42:17] right the other team scores they boo
[1:42:19] they let it be known what side they're
[1:42:21] on don't they and they're giving an
[1:42:23] expectation of what they want to happen
[1:42:24] in that cert in that in that event you
[1:42:27] ever see and
[1:42:28] if you ever go to a hockey game a
[1:42:30] professional hockey game i've been to a
[1:42:31] couple and you'll see people hold up
[1:42:33] signs and a lot of times it's kids
[1:42:35] and what are they the goo they go there
[1:42:36] and they want their favorite player to
[1:42:38] give them a stick
[1:42:39] or they want to puck so what do they do
[1:42:41] they hold up a sign and what do they say
[1:42:44] it's my birthday can i get a puck
[1:42:46] and a lot of times a player will read
[1:42:47] that and they'll go and they'll toss a
[1:42:48] puck over over the
[1:42:50] the boards to them over the glass to
[1:42:52] them or they'll say sydney crosby best
[1:42:54] player ever can i have a stick
[1:42:57] because why they want to catch his
[1:42:58] attention and let him know what their
[1:43:00] expectation is
[1:43:02] they're not afraid to make their
[1:43:03] expectation known
[1:43:04] and guess what if sydney crosby doesn't
[1:43:06] give him a stick does that mean they
[1:43:07] won't go the next time and hold the same
[1:43:08] sign up no because they expect a stick
[1:43:11] they want a stick so they go there with
[1:43:13] their sign up and they're letting it be
[1:43:14] known i want a stick from sidney crosby
[1:43:18] what do we do
[1:43:21] what do we do when we come to church
[1:43:23] what do we come to do when we go into
[1:43:24] our prayer closet
[1:43:26] are we holding up a sign that says this
[1:43:27] is my expectation
[1:43:30] are we kind of going in with a downturn
[1:43:31] mouth and you know what's going to be is
[1:43:33] going to be
[1:43:35] what is it you if you say you're
[1:43:36] expecting then act like it if you say
[1:43:38] you believe then start acting like it
[1:43:39] amen
[1:43:40] you're going to come to church come to
[1:43:41] church to hear what's for you and here's
[1:43:43] the thing where we fail is we say this
[1:43:45] is what god's going to say to me
[1:43:48] no no no you come to church ready to
[1:43:50] hear what's supposed to be for you and
[1:43:51] you let god say it the way he wants to
[1:43:53] say it so many times we want an
[1:43:54] affirmation we want an approval we want
[1:43:56] a check mark and you say well it's going
[1:43:58] to come like this and sometimes it does
[1:44:00] if you're in the right but guess what
[1:44:02] this is a house of correction as well so
[1:44:04] you got to be able to say when that word
[1:44:05] comes forth and it's different than what
[1:44:07] i expected i'm going to take the word
[1:44:08] instead of my way of thinking because
[1:44:10] guess what his ways are higher than our
[1:44:12] ways his thoughts are higher than our
[1:44:13] thoughts we get into that idol thing
[1:44:15] where we're telling him what to do
[1:44:18] tell him the need tell him the question
[1:44:20] tell them the situation and then say god
[1:44:21] i'm expecting you to answer
[1:44:23] that's why we worship
[1:44:25] that's why we praise
[1:44:27] amen it's because what we're in
[1:44:28] expectation we have an experience that
[1:44:31] he's god but we're worshiping and
[1:44:32] praising him not just for what he's done
[1:44:34] but for what he's going to do
[1:44:37] right
[1:44:38] we're not worshiping a dead god he
[1:44:40] didn't just live yesterday and he's dead
[1:44:41] today and he's not going to do anything
[1:44:42] tomorrow but our worship and our praise
[1:44:44] is what it's expectation it's showing
[1:44:47] that we're in a receiving attitude we're
[1:44:49] in a receiving channel and we're telling
[1:44:51] him how much we love and appreciate him
[1:44:52] for what he's done and what he's doing
[1:44:54] and what he's going to do even if we
[1:44:56] can't see it
[1:44:58] right that's why we worship him is
[1:45:00] because he's god not because of what i
[1:45:02] see but because he's god
[1:45:03] and then we'll see later our faith is
[1:45:05] going to come side amen we praise him
[1:45:07] because he's let us read the back of the
[1:45:09] book
[1:45:11] and we see our name in there and we see
[1:45:13] that we make it and we see that we
[1:45:15] overcome and we sit in his throne with
[1:45:17] him and we come back with ten thousand
[1:45:19] times thousands of his saints on white
[1:45:20] horses and we rule and reign with him
[1:45:23] that's why we praise him if we believe
[1:45:25] it that's our praise we've got a reason
[1:45:27] for it it's not blind praise this is not
[1:45:29] to the unknown god that does the unknown
[1:45:31] things
[1:45:32] this is a god that we know that's
[1:45:33] personal to us and we're praising him
[1:45:35] for what he's done and what he's doing
[1:45:37] amen
[1:45:38] we praise him because he said you're
[1:45:39] mine and you're going to make it
[1:45:42] brother man puts it this way he says
[1:45:43] expectations if you're expecting it you
[1:45:45] will receive it
[1:45:47] you usually get what you expect to get
[1:45:49] if you come to the meeting tonight
[1:45:50] expecting to find something to criticize
[1:45:52] the meeting the devil will show you
[1:45:54] he says you'll see
[1:45:55] you he will see that you get satisfied
[1:45:58] you get what you expect and if you come
[1:46:00] to get a blessing god will see that you
[1:46:02] get it if you come to get saved god will
[1:46:04] see you get it if you come to get healed
[1:46:06] be expecting to get healed god will see
[1:46:08] that you do it it's whatever you're
[1:46:09] expecting amen listen you go to a sports
[1:46:12] game and they're nuts
[1:46:14] they are crazy
[1:46:16] you see fans for a team
[1:46:18] and they're nuts the things they do the
[1:46:19] way they they paint up their faces and
[1:46:21] they put on uh you know
[1:46:23] they dress themselves up and do crazy
[1:46:25] hairstyles and wigs and
[1:46:27] it's insane what they'll do at a hockey
[1:46:29] game or a football game football game
[1:46:31] you go out on stage with a college
[1:46:32] football game 120 000 screaming fans in
[1:46:35] a building drinking alcohol
[1:46:37] and yelling for their team right the
[1:46:39] things that they're doing are crazy
[1:46:41] brother brahms says you're going to be
[1:46:42] crazy
[1:46:43] you're going to be considered crazy for
[1:46:45] the things you say and do if you're a
[1:46:46] believer listen moses was considered
[1:46:48] crazy we read john ryan earlier was
[1:46:50] considered crazy
[1:46:51] right they're crazy people to the world
[1:46:54] for the things that they're engaged in
[1:46:56] guess what we're engaged in this we're
[1:46:57] crazy to the world to come in here
[1:46:58] tonight
[1:47:00] long day of work maybe it's been a long
[1:47:02] week of work a long month of work
[1:47:03] already
[1:47:04] and we come in here and we give our time
[1:47:06] we give our money we give our effort we
[1:47:07] give our energy and we praise something
[1:47:09] that we can't see
[1:47:11] we're crazy
[1:47:13] but the reason we're crazy is because we
[1:47:15] know whom we have believed
[1:47:17] amen that he's been a reality in our
[1:47:19] life and that's the only reason to come
[1:47:20] here is because he's a reality if he's
[1:47:21] not a reality then what are we doing
[1:47:23] here
[1:47:24] it's got to be really man
[1:47:27] he said but everyone that tries to serve
[1:47:28] god is considered a little foolish
[1:47:30] because they've got the mind of god
[1:47:32] they're going by
[1:47:33] they're not paying any attention to what
[1:47:34] the world would say we look at the
[1:47:36] unseen by the human eye faith is not
[1:47:39] what we see what you see faith is the
[1:47:41] substance of things hoped for the
[1:47:43] evidence of things not seen he says now
[1:47:45] if you get that way down in your heart
[1:47:47] then we're coming close to the home base
[1:47:49] when god makes a promise he's duty bound
[1:47:51] to take care of that promise amen you'll
[1:47:54] act if you believe
[1:47:56] amen you'll act if you're an expectation
[1:47:58] man you put up a sign you say god i
[1:48:00] believe you healed me
[1:48:02] and if he doesn't heal you that game
[1:48:03] that service that week that month you go
[1:48:05] to the next one you say i believe you've
[1:48:07] healed me i believe you've healed me i
[1:48:09] believe you saved me i believe you
[1:48:11] filled me with the holy ghost i believe
[1:48:12] you've taken away my temper i believe
[1:48:14] you touched my body i believe you've
[1:48:16] healed my hormones i believe you've
[1:48:17] healed my marriage i believe you're
[1:48:18] giving me a job that meets the needs of
[1:48:20] my family whatever it might be what are
[1:48:22] you doing you're putting up the sign and
[1:48:23] saying lord i'm in expectation and then
[1:48:26] if he's got to do some work before that
[1:48:27] then that's up to him
[1:48:29] right but we're putting up the sign and
[1:48:31] if we never put up the sign we're never
[1:48:32] going to get anything we have no
[1:48:34] expectation
[1:48:35] that's what he's talking about
[1:48:37] he says here some time ago next to my
[1:48:39] last trip in africa i was just over
[1:48:40] there this spring there was a little
[1:48:42] baby that had club feet and one leg was
[1:48:44] shorter than the other had never wore
[1:48:45] shoes in his life he says it was most
[1:48:47] horribly deformed and i prayed for the
[1:48:49] baby that night they had watched and
[1:48:51] seen those things done and they prayed
[1:48:52] for the baby the next morning i went
[1:48:54] down i walked by a shoe store and i
[1:48:56] walked in there and there was the man
[1:48:58] buying the baby a pair of shoes to wear
[1:49:00] he believed it
[1:49:05] like this man over here that believed
[1:49:06] that god would give him the baby sure he
[1:49:08] believed it was going to happen he made
[1:49:10] ready for it he says i'm making ready
[1:49:12] although no physical results seen as yet
[1:49:14] that didn't make a bit of difference he
[1:49:16] believed it like abraham and called
[1:49:18] anything contrary as though it was not
[1:49:20] so we do it the other way
[1:49:23] we call what the symptoms as real and
[1:49:25] everything else falls he says no no call
[1:49:27] the symptoms false and call the promise
[1:49:29] true that's what abraham did
[1:49:31] he says therefore there therefore if
[1:49:34] your intellectuality does tell you oh
[1:49:36] here's a stinger now if your
[1:49:37] intellectuals does tell you that this is
[1:49:39] the truth god is the healer of sickness
[1:49:42] your mind can witness that this is the
[1:49:43] truth but if there's not the betting
[1:49:45] ground in your heart of faith to fallen
[1:49:48] to express it it will not happen
[1:49:51] there's got to be faith
[1:49:53] he says no matter how much this outside
[1:49:55] man can reason it with the scriptures
[1:49:57] and say it's right that still doesn't
[1:49:59] make it right what is it faith makes
[1:50:01] right
[1:50:02] faith is the warranty faith shows you
[1:50:03] that the guarantor has stepped in amen
[1:50:05] so what is it that raises
[1:50:07] your faith
[1:50:08] what is it that shows your faith what is
[1:50:10] it that confesses your faith it's
[1:50:12] expectation amen and what feeds
[1:50:14] expectation
[1:50:16] being in the presence of god
[1:50:18] listen a fan of of the edmonton oilers
[1:50:21] doesn't have expectation when he's
[1:50:22] watching somebody else play
[1:50:25] he doesn't have expectation when the
[1:50:26] game's not on but when the game's on
[1:50:28] he's there and he has an expectation
[1:50:30] doesn't he
[1:50:31] his presence there with the oilers gives
[1:50:34] him expectation that they're going to
[1:50:36] win
[1:50:37] the expectation you have of god is often
[1:50:39] because you know he's there that you've
[1:50:41] felt his presence that you've seen him
[1:50:43] moving in your life that you've seen the
[1:50:44] effect of the holy spirit there that his
[1:50:46] word is washing you and cleansing you
[1:50:48] and drawing you away from this world
[1:50:49] every single day every single week what
[1:50:51] is it if you're not convinced that god
[1:50:53] is near you that god is in you then you
[1:50:55] what what do you do you start to pull
[1:50:56] away and your expectations start to go
[1:50:58] down we need that reality on a day by
[1:51:01] day by day by day basis don't we and
[1:51:03] then we've got to fight to enter into
[1:51:05] that presence and it is a fight
[1:51:07] it is a fight
[1:51:08] believe me it is a fight you go to work
[1:51:11] and you hear language and and attitudes
[1:51:13] and you see i mean everybody's down in
[1:51:15] the mouth these days the stock market's
[1:51:17] down and i'm down 30 in my retirement
[1:51:19] portfolio i know a guy that's retiring
[1:51:21] in two weeks he says i thought it was a
[1:51:22] great idea five months ago not so sure
[1:51:24] it is now because why his portfolio is
[1:51:26] retirement portfolios lost so much in
[1:51:28] the last little while because the
[1:51:30] market's tanked by 30
[1:51:32] right
[1:51:33] everybody's down at the mouth
[1:51:34] everybody's worried and you can sit
[1:51:35] there and you can start saying oh i
[1:51:37] wonder about me
[1:51:39] that's not what i'm worried about it
[1:51:40] shouldn't be what i'm worried about but
[1:51:42] if i spend a bunch of time around and i
[1:51:43] can't help it at work right if you're on
[1:51:45] a call if you're in a meeting you can't
[1:51:46] stop people from talking about what
[1:51:48] they're going to talk about
[1:51:49] and then so i've got to come back into
[1:51:51] the presence of god i've got to come
[1:51:52] back to the word i've got to come back
[1:51:53] to the promises of god i've got to be
[1:51:55] refreshed in his presence so that i'm
[1:51:58] not affecting that i'm not affected by
[1:52:00] them but rather i can go back and i can
[1:52:01] affect them and i can tell them and i
[1:52:03] can show them how they can make changes
[1:52:05] and why they don't have to worry and
[1:52:07] what give a testimony of what god's
[1:52:09] doing in my life because people people
[1:52:11] are drawn to
[1:52:12] they're drawn to people that aren't what
[1:52:14] up in a tizzy when things get crazy
[1:52:17] they wonder how you can stand they're so
[1:52:18] calm when everybody else is freaking out
[1:52:21] and you say because what
[1:52:23] i i'm in a different place than you are
[1:52:25] i'm in a place of refuge i'm in a tower
[1:52:27] of of the name of jesus amen i've got
[1:52:30] some place where i go and i commit it to
[1:52:32] him and i let go and i don't have to
[1:52:33] worry about it
[1:52:35] and they'll say that's crazy and then
[1:52:36] what do we say
[1:52:38] but it works how's yours doing
[1:52:40] i'll show you mine you show me yours
[1:52:41] let's see who's doing well right now
[1:52:43] because i'm perfectly happy i'm
[1:52:44] perfectly satisfied i'm not worried
[1:52:46] about it
[1:52:47] and they're saying well that's crazy and
[1:52:48] you say but you're going crazy
[1:52:51] i'm crazy and i'm happy and you're going
[1:52:53] crazy and you're unhappy you can't tell
[1:52:55] me you're right
[1:52:57] amen
[1:52:59] amen if you're not convinced that god is
[1:53:00] near
[1:53:01] you won't be an expectation
[1:53:03] you've got to know that he's real and
[1:53:04] that he's he's there for you
[1:53:06] he says men are not infallible but god
[1:53:08] is man you get your mind on a man he'll
[1:53:11] make a mistake
[1:53:12] amen
[1:53:14] every time
[1:53:15] maybe not willfully but he'll do it
[1:53:17] brother branham said if you put a man up
[1:53:18] on a pedestal god will let him make a
[1:53:20] mistake he says even if he doesn't want
[1:53:22] to do it god will let him make a mistake
[1:53:24] he'll get him to make a mistake to what
[1:53:26] cause him to fall in your eyes so that
[1:53:27] you can get your eyes back on god
[1:53:29] he said god permits him to do it so he
[1:53:31] can shake your faith away from men our
[1:53:33] faith is not in the wisdom of man but
[1:53:35] it's in the power of the resurrection of
[1:53:37] jesus christ that's where the true seed
[1:53:39] of abraham rests their promise because
[1:53:42] they can only be the seed of abraham
[1:53:44] when they receive the holy ghost without
[1:53:46] the holy spirit they're not the seed of
[1:53:48] abraham and the same faith that was in
[1:53:50] abraham comes into the believer and no
[1:53:52] matter what takes place or how contrary
[1:53:55] the believer marches right on
[1:53:58] amen god bless you let's just stand this
[1:54:00] evening
[1:54:01] amen brother brown says what it's your
[1:54:03] position your knowledge that you are a
[1:54:05] seed of abraham that keeps you marching
[1:54:07] forward and then you've got to know
[1:54:08] you're a child of god you've got to know
[1:54:10] you're a son or a daughter of god you've
[1:54:11] got to know that you're in relation to
[1:54:12] him that he has called you out and that
[1:54:14] he's doing a work in your life and that
[1:54:16] makes you what an heir to the promises
[1:54:18] amen if you're an heir to eternal life
[1:54:20] then you're an heir to every promise
[1:54:21] that's between you and that eternal life
[1:54:23] amen and he's never going to leave us
[1:54:24] and he's never going to forsake us amen
[1:54:26] and when we know that that promise is
[1:54:28] ours that that word is ours and that his
[1:54:30] presence is here to confirm the promise
[1:54:32] how many times did brother brown say
[1:54:33] he's here to confirm his word right it's
[1:54:36] not just the preaching of the word but
[1:54:37] it's the presence of the word that we're
[1:54:39] looking for in this and he says he's
[1:54:40] here to confirm his word tonight and
[1:54:43] that's what we have to do we have to
[1:54:44] believe that he's here to confirm it to
[1:54:46] our lives each and every one amen
[1:54:48] amen let's just bow our heads
[1:54:51] heavenly father

[1:55:09] lord it's such a precious time
[1:55:12] lord but then more time comes amen lord

[1:55:16] struggle or things don't quite go the
[1:55:17] way we think
[1:55:19] lord when we start to doubt our faith we
[1:55:21] start to doubt your word we start to
[1:55:23] doubt lord that we even had it and we
[1:55:25] were even in the right channel in that
