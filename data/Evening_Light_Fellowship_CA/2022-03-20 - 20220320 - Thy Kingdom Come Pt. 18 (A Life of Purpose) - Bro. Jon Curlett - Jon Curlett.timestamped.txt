[38:53] blessed
[38:58] living word
[39:02] [Music]
[39:04] heavenly father
[39:06] or there's only one name you've ever
[39:07] given
[39:09] lord will you promise things would
[39:11] happen
[39:12] if we'd rest under that name if we'd
[39:14] take that name
[39:16] lord if we do what that man that had
[39:18] that name told us to do heavenly father
[39:21] and so lord we're coming in this morning
[39:22] lord and we're saying the name of jesus
[39:25] over our lives
[39:27] lord first personally
[39:29] lord that that name will be written over
[39:31] the door of our hearts that everything
[39:32] that goes in and goes out will be in
[39:34] your name lord that we could attach your
[39:36] name to it lord and that you wouldn't
[39:38] reject it heavenly father
[39:41] lord and in doing so lord that you would
[39:42] come and you would do what you said to
[39:44] those that take on that name of mrs
[39:46] jesus christ lord that you would heal
[39:48] that you would deliver that you would
[39:49] strengthen that you would encourage lord
[39:51] that you would correct us to align with
[39:53] your word lord that you would show us
[39:55] your way in your path that you would
[39:57] draw us closer to you lord and away from
[39:59] this world
[40:00] lord we pray that that name would have
[40:01] the preeminence here this morning lord
[40:04] as many are missing lord we pray that
[40:05] you will be above their homes and in
[40:07] their lives and hearts lord that you
[40:09] administer to each one listening online
[40:10] we pray lord god lord touch us this
[40:13] morning we pray lord there's many needs
[40:15] many requests lord so many things i
[40:17] don't know may you just touch each one
[40:19] we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it
[40:22] amen amen god bless you thank you
[40:24] musicians
[40:25] turn the scriptures if you would to
[40:26] first corinthians 7.
[40:28] first corinthians 7 it's certainly good
[40:30] to be back in church seems like we
[40:32] haven't been here in quite some time
[40:34] so it's uh it's good to be back amen i i
[40:36] was going back and forth with brother
[40:38] gerald he said to remember him in prayer
[40:39] he's still not a hundred percent
[40:41] so we definitely want to remember him
[40:43] also the special meetings coming up next
[40:45] week amen uh brother ed hammermeister
[40:47] and i have been talking quite a bit and
[40:49] he was able to change his tickets with
[40:50] no cost which was a huge um
[40:53] grace from god for sure because when you
[40:55] do a last-minute change within one week
[40:57] usually they really ding you but anyways
[40:59] they were able to get that done so
[41:01] certainly remember them in prayer that
[41:02] god will keep them safe as they come
[41:04] amen they're of course they're
[41:06] vaccinating these things and they've had
[41:07] covet in their church before but we want
[41:09] them to have a safe trip so they can
[41:10] come here and they can minister to us
[41:12] and by god's grace we can minister to
[41:14] them as well amen it's a two-way street
[41:16] amen so just keep those meetings in
[41:18] prayer
[41:18] and the ones that are coming amen
[41:22] first corinthians 7 verse 32 says
[41:24] but i would have you
[41:26] without carefulness he that is unmarried
[41:29] careth for the things that belong to the
[41:30] lord how he may please the lord but he
[41:33] that is married careth for the things
[41:35] that are of the world how he may please
[41:38] his wife amen god bless you you may be
[41:40] seated this morning lord willing we're
[41:42] going to take the last
[41:44] chapter the last service on the series
[41:46] on thy kingdom come and while we're
[41:48] closing out this chapter on the sisters
[41:49] we're going to be touching on the
[41:50] brothers of course a little bit this
[41:51] morning but i want to touch on the
[41:53] single sisters especially this morning
[41:55] as we get into this but you know this
[41:57] has been a bit of an odd series perhaps
[41:59] and maybe in some ways it would be
[42:00] considered legalistic because what we've
[42:02] been talking about is our conduct amen
[42:04] we haven't been talking about the
[42:05] mysteries we haven't been talking about
[42:07] general doctrine we haven't been talking
[42:09] about a message that came and opened up
[42:10] the scriptures to us in a particular way
[42:13] but what we've done is we've dug into
[42:14] our lives and the way that we act and
[42:16] conduct ourselves day to day and i was
[42:18] listening to brother ron spencer last
[42:19] week when we didn't have service and
[42:22] and in the service he was talking about
[42:23] that message where brother branham
[42:25] preached on the future home of the
[42:27] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[42:28] bride and we all we talk about the
[42:30] future home and that's where we want to
[42:31] be and that's where we plan on going and
[42:33] that's where believers you know imagine
[42:35] themselves but he says have you ever
[42:37] noticed how brother branham spends the
[42:38] first 45 minutes of future home doing
[42:41] what
[42:42] talking about our conduct talking about
[42:44] the life of the believer he says you've
[42:46] got to be justified you've got to be
[42:48] sanctified you've got to be filled with
[42:49] the holy ghost you have to be separated
[42:51] from the things of the world you have to
[42:52] be a part of your church community any
[42:54] and he goes in for 45 minutes before he
[42:56] ever touches on future home to talk
[42:58] about the condition of the people that
[43:00] are going to that future home amen so
[43:02] what we've been doing for these last 17
[43:04] and and for this final 18th service is
[43:06] talking about what the conduct of the
[43:08] people that are going to that future
[43:10] home because we can sit here all day and
[43:12] we can say god sent a message but if
[43:14] that message hasn't changed our lives
[43:16] and changed our conduct then it is a
[43:17] message that does not have power in our
[43:19] lives and it does us no good amen it was
[43:22] uh i was listening to brother cadry
[43:24] diggs this morning he used a scripture
[43:25] where where jesus was talking to the to
[43:28] the jews and the pharisees and and he
[43:30] said the word is there to set you free
[43:32] and and they said we are abraham's seed
[43:34] we've never been in bondage
[43:36] right they thought because of their
[43:38] lineage because of their family name
[43:39] because of the way they were raised that
[43:41] they were never in bondage and yet they
[43:42] were in the greatest bondage because
[43:44] they could not see the very messiah that
[43:46] was standing before them but they
[43:48] thought because they've been raised in
[43:49] the right circles that they had the
[43:50] right doctrine or so they thought that
[43:52] that made them okay and he's standing in
[43:54] front of them amen the word of life and
[43:56] flesh standing in front of them and they
[43:58] can't even recognize him why because
[44:00] they're in bondage and it's no different
[44:02] to if you're raised in them in a message
[44:04] home in a family home i say god bless
[44:06] thus that we were able to do that but
[44:08] that is not what gets you into the
[44:10] future home amen that is not what
[44:12] marries you to christ is being raised in
[44:13] the right family and having the right
[44:15] doctrine or being able to repeat the
[44:16] right doctrine back to us amen but it is
[44:19] to have a life of christ living within
[44:21] you a life has changed and brother kadri
[44:23] when i was listening to him he said the
[44:24] reason i know this message is true is
[44:26] because i'm not the cadre digs i used to
[44:28] be not because i know the seven seals
[44:30] are opened or not because i know the son
[44:32] of man ministry or who the son of
[44:34] perdition is or the truth on marriage
[44:36] and divorce or godhead or these
[44:37] different things but because my life has
[44:39] been changed i mean that's what makes
[44:41] the message real is that our lives have
[44:43] been changed so this this series has
[44:45] been on has your life been changed or if
[44:48] it hasn't been changed in certain areas
[44:49] when the word comes over the pulpit and
[44:51] touches your ears will you allow it to
[44:53] change you or will you sit back and rest
[44:55] on the laurels of i'm a message believer
[44:58] amen because you need the word to set
[44:59] you free and so it's so easy to sit
[45:02] there and say i believe all the
[45:03] doctrines because the doctrines require
[45:04] nothing of our life it requires nothing
[45:06] of change it requires nothing of
[45:08] humility it requires us not to do
[45:10] anything except amen but when the word
[45:12] comes forth and it says your life is
[45:13] supposed to look like this as a believer
[45:16] now there is no bla it's black and white
[45:18] you either are or you aren't and you
[45:19] have to line up and say i'm not
[45:22] sometimes amen i think i've heard from
[45:24] almost everybody in this church that
[45:25] said that was a tough one for me brother
[45:28] why because we sat there and we looked
[45:30] in the word and we said guess what i
[45:32] still have some work to do right i still
[45:34] have areas where i'm not in alignment
[45:36] and it's not always because we refuse to
[45:38] sometimes it's because it hasn't been
[45:39] preached we haven't heard a service
[45:41] recently we haven't heard a message
[45:42] recently that reminds us oh wait we've
[45:45] got to live a certain way in certain
[45:46] areas of our life right and so all this
[45:48] is is a stirring up your pure minds by
[45:50] way of remembrance that we can't just
[45:52] sit here and say i'm going in a rapture
[45:53] because i've accepted the message of
[45:55] malachi 4. but i'm going in a rapture
[45:57] because the life of the rapture is
[45:58] within me amen and that's what we're
[46:00] looking for this morning so i want to
[46:02] take as a final title for this series on
[46:05] that kingdom come of a life of purpose
[46:08] and then a life of purpose and we're
[46:09] closing out on the sisters we'll touch
[46:11] on the brothers a little bit but we look
[46:12] at the men in this church and we look at
[46:14] the men around the world and we're not
[46:15] all created the same are we we have men
[46:18] with different gifts different
[46:19] intellects different uh purposes in life
[46:21] we have men with different muscular
[46:23] strength intellectual strength
[46:24] ministerial strength as the case may be
[46:26] and we don't all live our lives the same
[46:28] way but we all live them according to
[46:30] the word if we're a true believer and
[46:32] it's no different with the sisters amen
[46:34] we covered the men in that series here
[46:35] on christ like men and christ like young
[46:37] men but then we focused on the sisters
[46:39] and so much as focused on the married
[46:41] sisters because that's where the word
[46:42] has focused most that's the type of the
[46:44] bride but we also see that there is a
[46:46] life calling for singleness and it is a
[46:48] life of singleness with purpose and
[46:50] we're not just talking about singleness
[46:51] today because everything we do is
[46:53] supposed to have a word purpose it's
[46:54] supposed to have a kingdom purpose we
[46:56] aren't just living here and going to
[46:57] work and making a living and providing
[46:59] for a home and this and that just for no
[47:01] no good reason but we're doing it for a
[47:03] kingdom purpose and we'll get into what
[47:05] that is amen but i wanted to talk to
[47:07] maybe the younger ones this morning the
[47:09] ones that are coming up the ones that
[47:10] are single the one the young sisters
[47:12] especially but even the young brothers
[47:14] to say hey there is a decision that
[47:16] you're going to make and it's a decision
[47:18] made prayerfully and it's will i get
[47:20] married or will i live a life of
[47:21] singleness because guess what god calls
[47:24] some people to singleness and we'll see
[47:25] it in scriptures but you've got to be
[47:27] able to live a glorious life whether
[47:28] you're married or whether you're
[47:29] unmarried for the purpose in the kingdom
[47:31] of god amen now we read in the opening
[47:34] scripture that paul draws a line of
[47:35] distinction between those that are
[47:37] married and those are unmarried he says
[47:39] i would have you without carefulness he
[47:40] that is unmarried careth for the things
[47:42] that belong to the lord and how he may
[47:45] please the lord
[47:46] now that word unmarried we think there
[47:48] means somebody that has never been
[47:50] married but he's talking to the men
[47:51] right now
[47:52] and in the in the in the old language
[47:54] they didn't have the word widower
[47:55] because back then you've got to remember
[47:57] if a man was unmarried it meant that he
[47:59] could have been divorced or he had not
[48:01] been married and said either way in most
[48:03] cases the man was allowed to remarry
[48:06] because the jews had messed up the
[48:07] divorce decree so much that basically if
[48:09] a man divorced he could go and marry a
[48:11] woman no matter what remember but the
[48:13] word of life comes forth in jesus and he
[48:16] corrects them and says hey there's only
[48:17] one way that a man is allowed to be
[48:18] remarried and it's for cause of
[48:20] fornication but they had so many things
[48:22] that they would they would basically say
[48:23] a man that's unmarried he was not a
[48:25] widower and he was not divorced because
[48:27] that had no bearing on it if he was not
[48:29] married he was automatically eligible to
[48:31] be remarried that's the way they were
[48:32] teaching it back then but then he says
[48:34] that there is what there is a widow and
[48:36] we'll get into that in the next
[48:37] scripture amen but the jews have gotten
[48:39] so far off the mark on a marriage and
[48:41] divorce that they didn't even have a
[48:43] word for a man that was divorced it was
[48:45] only a woman
[48:47] that's crazy that's crazy that they took
[48:49] it and it was out of the hardness of
[48:50] their hearts that moses gave it in the
[48:52] first place and that hardness took them
[48:53] to a place where marriage and divorce
[48:55] was never supposed to go it's it's
[48:57] interesting i've heard it preached on
[48:58] jesus said it was not so from the
[49:00] beginning and you know why he said it
[49:02] was not so from the beginning because
[49:03] the very first cause was fornication
[49:05] wasn't it
[49:06] and yet what did adam do he took her
[49:08] quickly to himself and what preserved
[49:10] her life so that she would not be put
[49:12] away that's why he said it was not so in
[49:14] the beginning because it didn't matter
[49:15] what happened there was always supposed
[49:16] to stay together and the example was
[49:18] supposed to do it
[49:20] but paul says this he says i say
[49:22] therefore to the unmarried and widows
[49:24] unmarried and widows widows are women
[49:26] that have lost their husbands but for
[49:27] the men he calls them unmarried he says
[49:29] it is good for them if they abide even
[49:31] as i am now we don't know if paul was
[49:32] married or not but the argument's been
[49:34] made that to be a pharisee of pharisees
[49:36] like he was you had to be married you
[49:37] couldn't make that as a single person
[49:39] and certainly when we see paul's wisdom
[49:41] when it comes to marriage you would
[49:42] think that that is a man that had
[49:44] experienced marriage before amen
[49:46] but he says no matter what he says if
[49:48] you're unmarried if you're divorced if
[49:50] you've lost your wife or if you've lost
[49:52] your husband he says it's good for you
[49:53] to abide even as i so the presumption
[49:55] there is that paul has what lost a wife
[49:58] and so he's saying after i lost my wife
[50:00] i never sought to be remarried again i
[50:02] stayed in singleness because he says
[50:04] it's better off to do it
[50:05] right
[50:06] so what single people have a lot of
[50:08] energy paul had a lot of energy they
[50:10] have a lot of time available to them and
[50:12] paul says if you can stay in singleness
[50:14] and preserve yourself in singleness then
[50:16] you can do great things for the kingdom
[50:17] of god
[50:18] it says but he that is married careth
[50:20] for the things that are of the world how
[50:22] he may please his wife and in the
[50:24] amplified it says but the married man is
[50:26] anxious about worldly matters how he may
[50:28] please his wife and he's drawn in
[50:30] diverging directions in other words his
[50:32] interests are divided he's distracted
[50:34] from his devotion of god to god so us
[50:36] men will know that and our women and the
[50:37] sisters will know that as well when you
[50:39] get married then you are distracted from
[50:41] the purpose of god in terms of you are
[50:43] not in singleness of purpose to seek god
[50:45] only and the things of god because why
[50:47] you've got a spouse now you've got a
[50:49] household you've got a home you've got
[50:50] children and these family and these
[50:52] things and so that's going to be
[50:53] something that pulls away your energy
[50:55] and your attention and that's the way it
[50:57] is paul doesn't say it's wrong he just
[50:58] says you've got to realize when this
[51:00] happens that guess what that prayer life
[51:02] that you had as a single person you may
[51:04] not have as a married person that you
[51:06] don't have that free time you don't have
[51:07] that energy you can't go out on missions
[51:09] trips you can't work in the local
[51:11] community in the same way because your
[51:12] first ministry is always to your home
[51:14] and to your spouse in the first place
[51:16] but if you're unmarried
[51:18] you've got this ability to go and do
[51:19] great things if you have holy ghost
[51:21] leadership
[51:22] because otherwise you'll do great harm
[51:23] to the kingdom because you'll be out
[51:25] there running around like a chicken with
[51:26] its head cut off thinking that you're
[51:28] doing the will of god and it's nowhere
[51:29] near close to it right
[51:31] but i was sharing with the brother the
[51:32] other day about how god had to whip me
[51:34] into into place before i could ever be
[51:37] called to the ministry because if i did
[51:39] if i went into the ministry five years
[51:40] earlier than i did then i would have
[51:42] made a big mess of it because it would
[51:44] have caused resentment in my home and
[51:45] all probability it would have put more
[51:46] distance between my wife and i and it
[51:48] would have caused destruction in my own
[51:50] family home even while i was out there
[51:52] trying to benefit the kingdom of god
[51:54] right because god has to build something
[51:56] and he always builds it on a strong
[51:57] foundation and for a man especially if
[52:00] the home foundation is crumbling broken
[52:02] or weak in any way god cannot build on
[52:04] that because it will fail every time but
[52:06] the word has to be the the home has to
[52:08] be built on the word and in doing so
[52:11] he'll turn the wife into a benefit for
[52:13] the man as opposed to him a hindrance to
[52:15] her because now my wife is a benefit to
[52:18] my ministry she's the greatest supporter
[52:20] i have and i don't know what i would do
[52:21] without her amen i love her and i
[52:23] respect her and i appreciate her for
[52:24] what she adds to my ministry because she
[52:27] adds a great deal of stability a great
[52:29] deal of support she loves it she
[52:31] appreciates it she feeds off of it she
[52:33] isn't she isn't mad she isn't angry when
[52:35] i take time away from the family and
[52:36] whatnot because there's a security in
[52:38] our relationship now but without that
[52:41] she'd be in all probabilities sitting
[52:42] there and getting frustrated and being
[52:44] annoyed that i've had i've had to yet
[52:47] again put the family aside for the sake
[52:48] of the ministry right so god always
[52:50] anchors our home life first for us men
[52:52] before he'll move us into something else
[52:54] right so there's no point in pressing
[52:56] into a new opportunity if my home life's
[52:58] out of whack right but once i got my act
[53:00] together and once god whipped me into
[53:01] shape then he said okay now you're ready
[53:03] to do it right it's not that i wasn't
[53:06] called before then it's at the time was
[53:08] never ready for and he didn't make that
[53:09] call apparent until my life was squared
[53:11] up right so before we take more on our
[53:14] plate we've got to make sure our house
[53:15] is in order because our first ministry
[53:16] is to our home and our first care and
[53:18] consideration is always to the home but
[53:20] then paul switches over to the sisters
[53:22] he says there's a difference also
[53:23] between a wife and a virgin the
[53:25] unmarried woman cares for the things of
[53:27] the lord that she may be holy both in
[53:29] body and in spirit but she that is
[53:32] married cares for the things of the
[53:33] world how she may please her husband
[53:36] in the in the amplified says he's drawn
[53:37] into virgin directions it says in the
[53:39] unmarried woman or girl is concerned and
[53:41] anxious about the matters of the lord
[53:43] how to be wholly separated and set apart
[53:46] in body and in spirit and the married
[53:49] woman has her care centered in earthly
[53:51] affairs how she may please her husband
[53:53] remember the scripture says that the
[53:54] wife acts towards her husband as unto
[53:56] the lord it is a reflection of her
[53:58] relationship with god how she treats her
[54:00] husband amen so she's supposed to treat
[54:02] him in the same manner she would treat
[54:03] god without him having necessarily the
[54:06] value or characteristics of god if us
[54:08] men were to be honest right
[54:10] but that's the that's the trial for the
[54:12] women isn't it
[54:14] no sisters are saying amen this morning
[54:17] silence is consent is that what we're
[54:19] going with amen but paul doesn't say
[54:21] again that the woman focusing on her
[54:23] husband is wrong he's just saying that's
[54:25] the way it is so don't expect anything
[54:27] different right so he says look the
[54:28] unmarried woman she's focused on the
[54:30] things of god or she ought to be focused
[54:32] on the things of god but the married
[54:33] woman she's focused on her husband
[54:35] because her worship to god is reflected
[54:37] through how she treats her husband in
[54:38] these different things then he moves on
[54:40] he says in this i speak for your own
[54:42] prophet
[54:43] not that i may cast a snare upon you but
[54:45] for that which is comely and that ye may
[54:47] attend upon the lord without distraction
[54:49] the amplified makes this much easier to
[54:51] understand he says now i say this for
[54:52] your own welfare and profit not to put a
[54:55] halter of restraint upon you but to
[54:57] promote what is seemly and in good order
[54:59] and to secure your undistracted and
[55:01] undivided devotion to the lord so paul
[55:03] says look you've got to know what's
[55:04] going to happen when you get married and
[55:06] you've also got to know what it's like
[55:07] to be single because i don't want you
[55:09] bound down and get in there and then
[55:11] realize oh my goodness this is not what
[55:13] i was looking for you've got to realize
[55:15] things are going to change and you've
[55:16] got to be ready for that change there
[55:18] right so life's different
[55:21] i i can guarantee you the singles
[55:22] amongst us don't realize how different
[55:24] it's going to be once you get married
[55:25] but the marriages know very well things
[55:27] change as soon as you bring a spouse
[55:28] into the home amen you don't have
[55:30] freedom right you've got to set yourself
[55:32] aside for men selfish thoughts have to
[55:34] leave the door as soon as that wife
[55:36] walks in the door selfishness has to
[55:37] leave very very quickly because
[55:38] otherwise it won't work and for that
[55:40] woman as soon as she comes in then
[55:41] submission has to start right away in
[55:42] obedience regardless of whether he's
[55:44] worthy of it or not that's a big change
[55:46] amen unselfish men and submissive women
[55:49] from day one
[55:50] right but what we find is that they're
[55:52] both supposed to they get it up front
[55:54] but the idea is that you earn it to the
[55:55] place where you actually deserve it not
[55:57] just get it amen because we stand in the
[55:59] place and if us men stand in the place
[56:01] where we say you must obey me and submit
[56:03] to me and we're not worthy of it then
[56:05] there's a problem in the home and we
[56:06] need a correction right
[56:08] i i read a somebody shared it with me
[56:10] and i'll probably mess it up but it said
[56:11] something like a submissive wife is the
[56:13] door to allowing god to correct a
[56:15] husband
[56:17] right because if she's trying to do all
[56:19] of that then god has no place but if she
[56:21] can stay humble and quiet before then
[56:23] he's put into the hands of a living god
[56:25] sometimes i'd rather my wife corrected
[56:27] me if i were to be honest i think
[56:29] it's listen
[56:30] god god doesn't mess around amen and
[56:32] when you're in a position of leadership
[56:34] god isn't going to let you get away with
[56:36] it amen he's going to push you to the
[56:38] point where you give in or he'll break
[56:40] you
[56:41] right and often it'll be publicly
[56:43] unfortunately and we see that breaking
[56:44] we see that falling away very briefly
[56:46] and then they realize oh my goodness i
[56:48] really messed up and then they come back
[56:49] and they humble themselves and god can
[56:51] do something with them then
[56:53] now he comes back to the singles he says
[56:55] nevertheless he that standeth steadfast
[56:57] in his heart having no necessity but has
[56:59] power over his own will and has so
[57:01] decreed in his heart that he will keep
[57:02] his virgin virgin he means virginity
[57:05] doeth well so the amplified says but
[57:07] whoever is firmly established in his
[57:09] heart
[57:09] strong in mind and purpose not being
[57:11] forced by necessity but having control
[57:14] over his own will and desire and has
[57:16] resolved this in his heart to keep his
[57:17] own virginity he's doing well
[57:19] so then he that giveth her in marriage
[57:21] doeth well but he that giveth her not in
[57:23] marriage do it better he's saying
[57:24] fathers if you give your daughter a
[57:26] marriage that's good but he says if you
[57:27] allow her to be single in purposeness to
[57:29] god that's even better
[57:32] he says the wife is bound by the law as
[57:34] long as her husband liveth but if her
[57:36] husband be dead she's at liberty to be
[57:37] married to whom she will only in the
[57:39] lord in other words she can only marry
[57:41] another believer of course
[57:43] but she is happier if she so abide she
[57:45] stays unmarried
[57:47] after my judgment and i think also that
[57:49] i have the spirit of god
[57:51] so the big question is for those that
[57:53] are are unmarried
[57:55] what path is god going to lead you down
[57:57] because you're not guaranteed to get
[57:58] married in this life are you right you
[58:00] don't get married just because you get
[58:01] the opportunity you get married because
[58:02] you're called to it and you have holy
[58:04] ghost leadership for it amen if you're
[58:06] married god's already told you what your
[58:07] plan is okay it's to stay married
[58:10] right he's not calling you to leave it
[58:12] amen but we start with the married women
[58:14] and we we see that they've got a kingdom
[58:16] purpose in their marriage amen and
[58:18] you've got to find value in what you're
[58:19] doing if you can't find value in what
[58:21] you're doing you're going to resent be
[58:22] married the rest of your life amen and
[58:24] it's because so often it's not exactly
[58:27] easy to step into it like i said the day
[58:28] you get married your whole life changes
[58:30] your whole purpose changes the way your
[58:32] energy is focused your freedom changes
[58:34] as a wife right because you don't have
[58:36] it now your husband is your head it
[58:38] changes from your father to your husband
[58:40] and so you don't have this ability to do
[58:42] it and now it's not about making
[58:43] yourself look good it's about making
[58:45] your husband look good according to his
[58:46] purpose and vision
[58:48] amen so the woman's purpose has to
[58:50] change now and you've got to get in
[58:52] alignment with what the word says and
[58:54] that's to get in alignment with your
[58:55] husband
[58:56] and in that you're going to have no
[58:57] doubt children and you'll have a family
[58:59] and you'll have a household in these
[59:00] different things but now your purpose is
[59:02] to get an alignment with a plan of a of
[59:04] the head that's over you which is your
[59:05] husband amen and your support and his
[59:07] success is your success and if he's
[59:09] honest he'll give you credit for it i've
[59:11] always said with us with with blanca and
[59:13] myself because we got married so young
[59:15] even while i was in school everything we
[59:17] have today is because of both of us it's
[59:19] not because of me i didn't go get a
[59:20] degree and get a job and then bring her
[59:22] into it but everything we have is
[59:23] because she's been there to support me
[59:25] all along the way and so we take equal
[59:27] equal credit for that success amen in
[59:30] terms of working together to get what we
[59:31] have but when it comes to the married
[59:33] women of course we go back to proverbs
[59:35] 31 i looked it up and i preached on this
[59:37] if you wanted to to see it in depth
[59:39] again go listen to that message on the
[59:41] divine relationship it's october 18
[59:43] 2020. but i just want to cup on a touch
[59:45] i'll touch on a couple of elements here
[59:48] in proverbs 31 and it says who can find
[59:50] a virtuous woman
[59:51] for her price is far above ruby's
[59:54] the heart of her husband does safely
[59:56] trust in her this is the effect of a
[59:59] virtuous woman
[1:00:01] the heart of her husband does safely
[1:00:02] trust in her so that he shall have no
[1:00:05] need of spoil
[1:00:06] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:00:08] the days of her life so this is the life
[1:00:10] of a virtuous woman always good never
[1:00:13] evil and the effect of it is that her
[1:00:15] husband does safely trust in her so we
[1:00:17] talked about before how god's
[1:00:18] relationship with us is based on him
[1:00:20] trusting us we have to trust him and he
[1:00:23] has to trust us and based on that trust
[1:00:25] we get authority in our life and so we
[1:00:27] look here and we see in proverbs 31 that
[1:00:29] we're going to see a woman that has
[1:00:30] great authority in her life we're going
[1:00:31] to see a wife and a mother that has
[1:00:33] great authority but look at the first
[1:00:34] thing it starts with she's of great
[1:00:36] value and look at the very first thing
[1:00:38] it says her husband safely trusts in her
[1:00:41] so the question to the wives is does
[1:00:43] your husband safely trust in you
[1:00:45] because if he doesn't then you're not
[1:00:46] going to have great authority and you're
[1:00:47] going to have struggles and trials in
[1:00:49] your marriage because you haven't earned
[1:00:51] that trust with him
[1:00:52] but i'll flip it back on the brothers
[1:00:54] and say brothers does your wife trust
[1:00:55] you in the first place because she's got
[1:00:57] to trust you in order to follow you
[1:01:00] willingly willingly do it she'll do it
[1:01:02] out of obedience to the word but to
[1:01:03] willingly do that she's got to what
[1:01:05] trust you by a reality based on the life
[1:01:07] decisions that you've made so far we
[1:01:09] earn it by a track record not one
[1:01:11] decision not one day not one great day
[1:01:14] with the family not one great day with
[1:01:15] the wife not one great day with the
[1:01:16] spouse but it's a lifetime of decisions
[1:01:19] that give us the track record to where
[1:01:20] we're proven to her that we are worthy
[1:01:22] of her trust amen but then we see the
[1:01:24] flip side is that when he trusts her he
[1:01:27] gives her great authority in in proverbs
[1:01:30] 31 amen it safely trusts her in other
[1:01:32] words his trust is not misguided
[1:01:34] right he doesn't wake up every morning
[1:01:36] to a new surprise and a new oopsie or a
[1:01:39] new mess he's got to clean up or a new
[1:01:41] situation he's got to resolve because
[1:01:42] his wife got into trouble but he safely
[1:01:44] trusts in her than that his trust is not
[1:01:46] misguided to her and she does him good
[1:01:48] and not evil every time she's working
[1:01:50] for the household amen so the question
[1:01:52] to the sisters then is again can your
[1:01:54] husband trust you like that can us
[1:01:56] brothers say my wife does me good and
[1:01:58] not evil every day
[1:02:00] now chances are we can't because our
[1:02:02] wives are as human as we are right but
[1:02:04] it's the general progression towards
[1:02:06] good and not the evil amen that's what
[1:02:08] we're looking for isn't it amen we saw
[1:02:10] before that the women's trust is a
[1:02:12] different struggle amen they
[1:02:14] i i'm so glad i'm not a woman let me put
[1:02:17] it that way
[1:02:18] i'm so glad i'm not a woman because the
[1:02:20] struggle is real amen you're working
[1:02:22] with fallen men and even holy
[1:02:24] ghost-filled men are still fallen in
[1:02:26] their carnal nature amen and you're
[1:02:27] going to have to fight that and they
[1:02:28] have to fight it every day but we saw on
[1:02:30] first peter 3 6 it said even as sarah
[1:02:32] obeyed abraham calling him lord whose
[1:02:35] daughters you are as long as you do well
[1:02:37] and are not afraid with any amazement
[1:02:39] now that with any amazement it says and
[1:02:40] you are now her true daughters if you do
[1:02:42] right and let nothing terrify you not
[1:02:46] giving way to hysterical fears or
[1:02:48] letting anxieties unnerve you so yours
[1:02:50] is a walk of great trust and if we were
[1:02:52] to think very honestly and maybe
[1:02:54] carnally about abraham and sarah abraham
[1:02:57] did not have the greatest track record
[1:02:58] with his wife
[1:03:00] how many times did abraham give his wife
[1:03:02] to another man
[1:03:04] right sisters if your man gave you to
[1:03:07] another man would you trust him
[1:03:10] yet the scripture says she didn't get
[1:03:11] hysterical over it
[1:03:13] even in the even in the palace of the
[1:03:15] king
[1:03:16] she didn't get hysterical
[1:03:18] he didn't do right
[1:03:20] but she never got hysterical
[1:03:23] she trusted god was going to sort it out
[1:03:24] because the child had to come through
[1:03:26] her
[1:03:27] right she trusted that god was going to
[1:03:28] work the situation out
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:31] so what sometimes the situation is very
[1:03:34] dire and our tendency is to get what
[1:03:36] hysterical to get angry to get
[1:03:38] frustrated
[1:03:40] disappointed as the case may be but says
[1:03:42] don't do it don't give in to that sit
[1:03:45] back and just let god work it out
[1:03:47] but don't be surprised if your man takes
[1:03:49] a hit if your husband takes a hit
[1:03:50] because if he's off he's going to get
[1:03:52] hit
[1:03:52] he's got to god's got to bring him back
[1:03:54] in line amen but this is a life where
[1:03:56] you've got to walk in trust when the
[1:03:57] situation calls for anything but it
[1:04:00] right that's what you lady that's what
[1:04:02] you sisters are called to is when trust
[1:04:03] is not even warranted yet you're
[1:04:05] supposed to trust because again you're
[1:04:06] looking to the god behind the husband
[1:04:08] not just the husband there amen and
[1:04:10] that's the key to the authority that
[1:04:11] you're going to get
[1:04:13] and then it's a two-way street
[1:04:14] oftentimes i think if i were honest that
[1:04:16] us men are asking the women to trust us
[1:04:17] a loss a lot more than we're trusting
[1:04:19] them and as we get older and as we get
[1:04:21] deeper into our relationships we should
[1:04:22] start to reciprocate that trust to the
[1:04:25] sisters to give them authority and to
[1:04:27] give them what the ability to have a
[1:04:29] greater effect in our lives and in our
[1:04:30] families and these different things
[1:04:32] now that we're virtuous it means
[1:04:34] strength or strong
[1:04:36] mighty efficient
[1:04:38] wealthy
[1:04:39] and army
[1:04:41] army so a woman that is virtuous she
[1:04:43] comes with a lot doesn't she this is not
[1:04:45] some so some you know princing prancing
[1:04:48] you know sit on the throne and look
[1:04:50] pretty type of woman this is a woman
[1:04:52] that comes with tools this is a woman
[1:04:53] that comes with a heart to work this is
[1:04:55] a woman that comes with with a an
[1:04:57] attitude of getting things done
[1:05:00] and getting things done well and getting
[1:05:01] them done efficiently men she's found
[1:05:03] that position of authority in in
[1:05:05] proverbs 31 and because he's trusting
[1:05:07] her he has no qualms and giving her free
[1:05:09] reign in the household and and this
[1:05:11] proverbs 31 woman is a woman of wealth
[1:05:13] and she's in a house of wealth we see
[1:05:15] that she has employees she has servants
[1:05:17] she has property she has a big house she
[1:05:19] has financial resources she makes
[1:05:21] investments all with her husband's full
[1:05:23] authority
[1:05:24] it doesn't say that he's coming and
[1:05:26] checking her every day what did you do
[1:05:27] what you do what you do but he's letting
[1:05:29] her run with it because she's gained his
[1:05:31] trust and it's implied that she's
[1:05:33] guiding his trust by her previous track
[1:05:35] record right she's proven that as he's
[1:05:37] given her authority she hasn't abused it
[1:05:39] but she's used it for his purpose amen
[1:05:43] so it says in the amplified it says a
[1:05:44] capable intelligent and virtuous woman
[1:05:47] who is he who can find her she is far
[1:05:49] more precious than jewels and her value
[1:05:51] is far above rubies or pearls the trick
[1:05:54] is to see it before it's ever there
[1:05:56] isn't it
[1:05:57] you know that miners when they're going
[1:05:58] and looking they know what a material
[1:06:01] looks like even when it's covered in
[1:06:03] something else and then when we marry
[1:06:05] somebody when a woman chooses to accept
[1:06:07] a proposal from a man when a man
[1:06:09] proposes to a woman oftentimes what she
[1:06:11] really is is not fully clear is it
[1:06:14] you're only seeing a glimpse of it right
[1:06:15] if you were to go look at rock when it's
[1:06:17] mined it is not you do not tend to find
[1:06:20] gold all just in big pieces do you you
[1:06:22] find little elements of it blended in
[1:06:24] with something else and what happens is
[1:06:26] you have to break it open to really see
[1:06:28] what's inside if you were to go find a
[1:06:30] piece of jade in australia you know they
[1:06:32] have this beautiful jade and when you
[1:06:34] look at that it's buried in another rock
[1:06:36] it's not polished it's not beautiful and
[1:06:38] all they see often is just a little
[1:06:40] piece of that sliver of jade they say
[1:06:42] wow there's something in here then they
[1:06:44] cut it open and they realize there's
[1:06:46] something in here that's great but there
[1:06:47] are other pieces that are what they're
[1:06:49] fakes not fakes but there's nothing in
[1:06:51] there it's a fake promise is really what
[1:06:53] it is you think there's something there
[1:06:55] they open it up and it's just crumbly
[1:06:56] rock there's no jade inside of it so as
[1:06:58] believers when we're looking for a
[1:06:59] spouse what are we looking for we're
[1:07:01] looking for something that's a diamond
[1:07:02] in the rough we believe the diamond's in
[1:07:04] there but it's not yet apparent what it
[1:07:06] is and that's why we need holy ghost
[1:07:07] leadership that's why we need to pray
[1:07:09] about these things that's why god gives
[1:07:10] us holy ghost-filled parents to help us
[1:07:12] to maybe see what's deeper inside that
[1:07:14] person than we can see ourselves because
[1:07:16] so often we marry potential and
[1:07:18] potential doesn't always play out
[1:07:21] says the heart of her husband trusts in
[1:07:23] her confidently and relies on her and
[1:07:24] believes in her securely so that he has
[1:07:27] no lack of honest gain or need of
[1:07:28] dishonest spoil in other words he
[1:07:30] doesn't go need to do something he ought
[1:07:31] not to be doing in order to provide for
[1:07:33] the family he doesn't have to make up
[1:07:35] for her wastage or for her taking the
[1:07:37] money and and and the values of the
[1:07:39] family and using it for her gain amen
[1:07:42] so what the woman is not called to drive
[1:07:44] a man to the point where he's working at
[1:07:46] all hours to provide for the family a
[1:07:47] man's not here to make a lifestyle for a
[1:07:49] woman amen what happens is god gives a
[1:07:52] man and a wife to each other and
[1:07:54] whatever he makes she's supposed to live
[1:07:55] within the limits of that amen
[1:07:58] what she comforts encourages and does
[1:08:01] him only good as long as there is life
[1:08:03] within her
[1:08:04] that's the that's the purpose of a of a
[1:08:07] god-filled woman amen so if we look at
[1:08:09] ourselves as the bride is this what god
[1:08:11] can say we're doing for his kingdom that
[1:08:13] we're confident he's confident that
[1:08:14] we're doing good all the days of our
[1:08:16] lives when we preached on this way back
[1:08:18] when remember we went through proverbs
[1:08:19] 31 and we talked to the to the women and
[1:08:21] the sisters and then we came right back
[1:08:22] and we talked to everybody as the bride
[1:08:24] of christ to say what are we doing with
[1:08:26] our time and with our energy and with
[1:08:27] our gifts and what god's given us and
[1:08:29] the idea here is that everything that we
[1:08:30] do is for the good of the kingdom amen
[1:08:33] because we put the burden on the sisters
[1:08:34] here because we're reading proverbs 31
[1:08:36] but really it's a burden that we all
[1:08:37] share as members of the bride of christ
[1:08:39] is that we're doing things for his
[1:08:40] kingdom and for nothing else amen
[1:08:43] proverbs 12 4 says a virtuous woman is a
[1:08:46] crown to her husband but she that maketh
[1:08:48] ashamed as rottenness in his bones now
[1:08:51] you see she's a crown to her husband
[1:08:54] a crown to her husband that's a
[1:08:55] wonderful thing she's a crowning she's a
[1:08:58] crowning achievement she's something
[1:08:59] that brings glory to him but it says a
[1:09:01] bad one is is as rottenness in his bones
[1:09:05] now i don't look at that rottenness in
[1:09:07] his bones as a bad thing because if if
[1:09:09] she's good then she's the opposite of
[1:09:10] rottenness she's a support she's a
[1:09:12] strength what are the bones the skeleton
[1:09:14] it's the structure of your body it
[1:09:16] provides a massive amount of support and
[1:09:17] if you don't have good bones then your
[1:09:19] body's not going to be able to handle
[1:09:20] very much is it but a woman that is that
[1:09:23] is a virtuous woman she's not his
[1:09:24] rottenness she's had strength to his
[1:09:26] bones if we can put it that way it's a
[1:09:27] bad one that's rottnest but a good one
[1:09:29] is his strength to a man to a husband a
[1:09:31] man she brings something to him she adds
[1:09:33] to him in a way and she makes him
[1:09:35] stronger and better than he was before
[1:09:37] he ever came into contact with her right
[1:09:40] she encourages him
[1:09:42] i need encouragement as a husband
[1:09:44] amen i might do 10 things that my wife
[1:09:46] thinks are wrong but if she encourages
[1:09:48] me on the one thing i do right i'm a
[1:09:49] whole lot more open to the things that
[1:09:51] she thinks i do wrong why because we
[1:09:53] thrive on encouragement we don't thrive
[1:09:54] on correction amen and i've noticed with
[1:09:56] god that he always encourages before he
[1:09:58] corrects
[1:09:59] right if we won't accept correction then
[1:10:01] it always gets a little tougher but he
[1:10:03] always gives us encouragement and what
[1:10:04] is that encouragement is he gives us a
[1:10:06] way to get there right he doesn't just
[1:10:08] tell us what's wrong but he gives us a
[1:10:09] way to get to where we need to be
[1:10:11] correction without a a way to be
[1:10:13] restored is from satan right but if he
[1:10:16] can restore us back then we'll take the
[1:10:18] correction because we know he's made a
[1:10:19] path back for where we need to go amen
[1:10:22] that's why we fellowship as believers we
[1:10:24] don't fellowship just to to to to rub
[1:10:27] each other off and and and to clean each
[1:10:29] other up but we encourage each other
[1:10:30] amen we we encourage ourselves remember
[1:10:32] what what the scripture says that we're
[1:10:34] supposed to get together we're supposed
[1:10:35] to sing songs we're supposed to give
[1:10:36] testimonies we're supposed to do these
[1:10:38] things to do what build up the the
[1:10:40] church amen to build up the body and to
[1:10:42] encourage each other a long life's path
[1:10:45] but when we drop into proverbs 31 and we
[1:10:47] see how much authority this wife has
[1:10:49] you'll see that it's tied to how she
[1:10:51] uses it she doesn't just have authority
[1:10:54] but she has it for a particular purpose
[1:10:56] it says she seeketh woolen flax and
[1:10:58] worketh willingly with her hand she's
[1:11:00] like the merchant ships she bringeth
[1:11:02] food from afar she rises riseth also
[1:11:05] while it is yet night and giveth me to
[1:11:07] her household in a portion to her
[1:11:08] maidens she consider at the field and
[1:11:10] buyeth it and with the fruit of her hand
[1:11:12] she planted the vineyard so in other
[1:11:14] words you see that she is not given
[1:11:15] authority for ease of life or luxury or
[1:11:18] comfort but she takes that authority and
[1:11:20] she's using that authority she's using
[1:11:22] it to do what to work
[1:11:25] to develop the household to do good
[1:11:26] things to provide for her family that
[1:11:29] authority is given with a purpose and
[1:11:30] it's for the benefit of the home it is
[1:11:32] not there to give her beautiful clothes
[1:11:34] it is not there to make her look pretty
[1:11:36] to preserve her youthful body none of
[1:11:38] these things but rather she's doing it
[1:11:39] for the benefit of the home that she is
[1:11:41] in amen she's using her authority to
[1:11:43] clothe and feed the company her family
[1:11:45] and her household
[1:11:46] she's getting up early in the morning
[1:11:48] for one purpose and that is to do what
[1:11:50] to prepare meat for those that are going
[1:11:52] to be working that day amen she has
[1:11:54] employees she buys a field and she
[1:11:56] develops it
[1:11:57] this is a woman with tremendous
[1:11:59] authority and we look here and we see
[1:12:01] what she's doing with it and again she's
[1:12:03] not doing it to make herself look good
[1:12:04] but she's doing it to raise up everybody
[1:12:06] that's around her amen
[1:12:08] let me stop and talk about money for a
[1:12:10] second because some of us don't make as
[1:12:12] much as others do we so let me talk to
[1:12:15] the ones that make less if god has given
[1:12:17] you less money in this world you know
[1:12:18] what he's given you brothers he's given
[1:12:20] you a wife that can stretch a dollar to
[1:12:22] make it do the work or two
[1:12:24] now sisters if you're married to a man
[1:12:25] that makes less than perhaps you would
[1:12:27] like then guess what god has given you
[1:12:29] to him so that you can do that exact
[1:12:31] work so that you can go out you can find
[1:12:33] the deals you can make two one do the
[1:12:35] work of two
[1:12:36] so you don't sit here and complain and
[1:12:38] say buddy you need to get a better job
[1:12:40] buddy you need to get a better job work
[1:12:41] harder work more so that i can have this
[1:12:43] that and the other no god gives you to
[1:12:45] that man so that you can make do with
[1:12:47] what he provides for that family and
[1:12:49] believe me i've seen it i mean when mom
[1:12:50] and dad got divorced you talk about
[1:12:52] having to stretch a dollar mom had to
[1:12:53] stretch it to make three do the work of
[1:12:55] three but yet she did it
[1:12:57] right nearly killed her but she did it
[1:13:00] right god makes a way to provide but
[1:13:01] we're not here to provide a lifestyle
[1:13:03] for our wives we're here to provide for
[1:13:04] them in the way that god has given us a
[1:13:06] means to do it amen and then for those
[1:13:08] that make more because get what we
[1:13:10] always have those that make more and we
[1:13:11] always have those that make less and god
[1:13:13] never promised that we'd make more
[1:13:15] right so some of us are going to have to
[1:13:16] deal with that as well but to the ones
[1:13:18] that do make more what does god do he
[1:13:20] gives your wife the ability to not have
[1:13:22] to spend her time so much thinking about
[1:13:23] how much she's spending and what she's
[1:13:25] supposed to do then she's supposed to
[1:13:26] take that and be more generous to others
[1:13:28] to help out others to use that extra
[1:13:29] time to use that extra energy to use
[1:13:31] that extra money as the case may be to
[1:13:33] help those that have less amen
[1:13:36] so what is it we're not given a bunch of
[1:13:38] extra money to make our lives easy
[1:13:39] either we're there to benefit the body
[1:13:41] and the kingdom of god each and every
[1:13:43] one of us
[1:13:44] says she lays her hands to the spindle
[1:13:46] and her hands hold the disc staff and
[1:13:47] she stretches out her hand to the poor
[1:13:49] yeah she reaches forth her hands to the
[1:13:51] needy there you see she's got a ton of
[1:13:53] money but she's not just holding it to
[1:13:54] the household is she she's reaching out
[1:13:56] to those that are in need she's using
[1:13:58] her authority to help others it doesn't
[1:14:00] say that she goes and asks her husband
[1:14:01] can i help says she just goes and does
[1:14:03] it because what she's got the trust of
[1:14:05] her husband that she's not going to put
[1:14:07] the household finances in in distress by
[1:14:10] helping somebody else amen
[1:14:12] but she's not just looking to herself
[1:14:13] now but she's looking to those outside
[1:14:15] and we see this in this own church don't
[1:14:17] we somebody will drop by a meal right
[1:14:19] when a sister has a baby what happens we
[1:14:21] all try and do what bring meals to come
[1:14:23] over maybe help clean the house or guess
[1:14:24] what somebody's in the middle of a trial
[1:14:26] or somebody's struggling or you see that
[1:14:28] sometimes you don't see anything and
[1:14:29] what is what happens sisters the holy
[1:14:31] ghost will say drop a meal off
[1:14:34] right how many here can say they've had
[1:14:36] a meal out of the blue didn't call
[1:14:37] didn't ask anybody did they
[1:14:40] but guess what we give as well we can't
[1:14:42] always be on the receiving end but we
[1:14:43] give it as well but how many times
[1:14:45] somebody will drop by and say hey i
[1:14:46] brought a meal over for you so you can
[1:14:48] take a break
[1:14:49] right what is it it's the holy spirit
[1:14:50] moving to share with the others that are
[1:14:52] in the church to help them out amen i'm
[1:14:54] thankful we have that what is it
[1:14:56] sometimes they what offer to come over
[1:14:58] watch your kids so you can have an
[1:14:59] evening note right a couple needs to get
[1:15:01] out sometimes get away from the kids and
[1:15:02] just kind of love on each other a bit
[1:15:04] and tell each other how much you care
[1:15:05] about each other and sort through
[1:15:07] different issues and kind of just relax
[1:15:08] a bit get out of the groove get out of
[1:15:11] the rut of of raising a family and just
[1:15:13] remember that you're married and you
[1:15:14] love each other remember
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:17] hey listen when you're in the grind
[1:15:19] right when finances are tight maybe when
[1:15:22] health is bothering a different one when
[1:15:24] when things just aren't going so great
[1:15:26] you still have to love each other don't
[1:15:27] you and you have to remind each other
[1:15:29] that you that you love each other
[1:15:31] says she maketh find linen and sell with
[1:15:33] it and deliver girdles unto the merchant
[1:15:35] strength and honor of her clothing and
[1:15:37] she shall rejoice in time to come she
[1:15:39] openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her
[1:15:41] tongue is the law of kindness so wisdom
[1:15:44] is what makes a woman like this talk a
[1:15:46] proverbs 31 opens her mouth only with
[1:15:49] wisdom
[1:15:50] it's not gossip it's not opinion but
[1:15:53] it's wisdom and wisdom is what
[1:15:55] knowledge with experience added to it
[1:15:58] not just knowledge we get into trouble
[1:15:59] when we start spewing knowledge okay i'm
[1:16:01] a witness of that personally when you
[1:16:03] start talking about something because
[1:16:04] you you've read a book or you've heard
[1:16:06] it from your prof or whatever and you
[1:16:08] don't actually have the experience
[1:16:09] behind it you get into trouble every
[1:16:10] single time but she does this it's a
[1:16:12] careful measured discussion that's
[1:16:14] always seasons with one other thing and
[1:16:16] that's kindness
[1:16:18] right the law of kindness is what is in
[1:16:20] her tongue amen that's what this woman
[1:16:22] talks
[1:16:23] like amen
[1:16:25] it's the hardest thing i think for a
[1:16:26] ministry sometimes is when you're
[1:16:27] correcting
[1:16:29] what are you trying to do you're trying
[1:16:30] to bring the wisdom of the word to a
[1:16:31] situation but it always has to be done
[1:16:33] with one intent and that is with
[1:16:34] kindness and to restore somebody back to
[1:16:37] where they need to be
[1:16:38] she looketh well to the ways of her
[1:16:40] household and either not the bread of
[1:16:41] idleness her children rise up and call
[1:16:44] her blessed her husband also and he
[1:16:45] prays with her
[1:16:47] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:16:48] thou excellest them all
[1:16:50] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[1:16:52] but a woman that feareth the lord she
[1:16:54] shall be praised now listen to this
[1:16:56] brothers
[1:16:57] give her of the fruit of her hands and
[1:17:00] let her own works praise her in the
[1:17:03] gates
[1:17:04] amen this is the effect of the
[1:17:05] scriptures on a woman's life when she's
[1:17:07] giving back and then the scripture says
[1:17:09] why husbands
[1:17:11] give back to her what she's given to
[1:17:13] them
[1:17:13] you know what happens so often is that
[1:17:16] the woman does all the work and the men
[1:17:18] receive all the blessings and we hold it
[1:17:20] to ourselves
[1:17:21] but it says you're not supposed to do
[1:17:22] that you're supposed to give her back
[1:17:24] what she's given you
[1:17:26] so when tax return season comes in
[1:17:29] what happens
[1:17:30] us men sit there say my tax return my
[1:17:33] money i'm going to do what i'm going to
[1:17:34] do with it
[1:17:35] according to scripture you take some of
[1:17:37] the tax return money and you'd say honey
[1:17:38] here's something for you to use
[1:17:40] because you've worked hard
[1:17:42] to make sure that the finances are in
[1:17:44] order in the house
[1:17:45] so i'm going to give you back some of
[1:17:46] what you saved now so that you can use
[1:17:48] it for what you feel you need in the
[1:17:49] household
[1:17:50] i was talking to my wife about this this
[1:17:52] is where it came from blanca was i'm
[1:17:54] reading this and i said listen i've been
[1:17:56] looking at this and this for myself but
[1:17:58] how about this year we let you do it you
[1:18:00] tell me what you want to spend the money
[1:18:01] on
[1:18:03] and so we're buying a whole new house
[1:18:06] no
[1:18:07] no but the thing is this guess what i
[1:18:09] don't value shades and side tables
[1:18:13] but she does
[1:18:14] you know why because when people come to
[1:18:16] our house and they have nowhere to put
[1:18:17] their coffee cup
[1:18:18] and then it gets knocked over and then
[1:18:20] it spills on the rug and whatnot what's
[1:18:22] she doing she's saying we need better
[1:18:23] things here so we can support people
[1:18:25] that come to our house and host people
[1:18:27] so that's what she's looking at i'm not
[1:18:28] looking at that
[1:18:30] i'm looking at things for the shed and
[1:18:32] tools
[1:18:33] and vehicle lifts and motorcycles right
[1:18:36] that's what i care about
[1:18:39] not in every way but i what i'm saying
[1:18:41] is what i get the money and i say what
[1:18:42] can i get for me scripture says no no no
[1:18:45] you got to give some back to her you got
[1:18:47] to let her what the scripture says don't
[1:18:49] muzzle the ox of treads the corn your
[1:18:51] wife's sitting there and she's busting
[1:18:52] her hump day in and day out and we won't
[1:18:54] give him a penny because we're the man
[1:18:56] and we make the money right that's not
[1:18:57] the way it's supposed to be we're
[1:18:59] supposed to be giving back to our wives
[1:19:00] letting them have a say in what these do
[1:19:02] and not not always give the majority to
[1:19:04] us how about one time we give the
[1:19:05] majority to them
[1:19:06] amen we'll go out we'll spend 10 15
[1:19:09] grand on a toy for us and we won't spend
[1:19:11] 500 for something that she wants for the
[1:19:13] house
[1:19:14] got to give something back to her amen
[1:19:18] we're blessed to have the wives that we
[1:19:20] have
[1:19:22] i think we need to treat them like
[1:19:23] they're the blessing that we believe
[1:19:24] they are
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:26] but you see this woman this proverbs 31
[1:19:29] woman there is no idleness in this woman
[1:19:32] this is a woman that's working from
[1:19:34] mourning
[1:19:35] to dusk
[1:19:36] from the time before the light comes up
[1:19:38] till after the light goes down this
[1:19:40] woman is working working working now i'm
[1:19:42] not saying sisters that's what you have
[1:19:43] to do i'm saying that's what this woman
[1:19:44] does okay but it's not a life of
[1:19:46] vitalness you know we were talking the
[1:19:48] other day and and the scripture says
[1:19:50] that a woman will be saved in
[1:19:51] childbearing if she if they continue in
[1:19:53] the faith this is what that saving looks
[1:19:56] like is that she's got no time idleness
[1:19:58] what is it idol hands or devils
[1:20:00] playground
[1:20:01] right this is what helps keep you out of
[1:20:03] trouble
[1:20:04] listen if a man sits at home all day and
[1:20:06] he doesn't work you know what he gets
[1:20:07] into trouble
[1:20:09] every single time he'll get into trouble
[1:20:11] because he's got nothing good to do this
[1:20:13] is what's good to do for a woman if
[1:20:15] she's married this is where you can't
[1:20:17] let idleness creep in that man's got to
[1:20:19] get up and go to work every single day
[1:20:20] whether he likes it or not right that's
[1:20:22] what he's called to do is provide for
[1:20:24] the family whether he's enjoying it or
[1:20:25] not it has nothing to do with it he's
[1:20:27] got to do it and the same thing is for
[1:20:28] the women is that you do have a a work
[1:20:31] to do and it's right here and this is
[1:20:32] your life of purpose is not being idle
[1:20:34] but what developing that household and
[1:20:36] gaining the trust of your husband so
[1:20:38] that he gives you more and more and more
[1:20:40] so that you can do more and more and
[1:20:41] more for the household's sake
[1:20:43] brother braham says this now this is to
[1:20:45] the married women
[1:20:46] he says a woman's place is at home with
[1:20:48] her children
[1:20:49] now when she now if her husband's sick
[1:20:51] and she has to work that's different but
[1:20:53] a woman's place is at home in the
[1:20:54] kitchen and when she leaves that she's
[1:20:56] out of her place exactly right
[1:21:01] proverbs 31 that's what all we see is a
[1:21:03] woman that's working out of her home now
[1:21:05] guess what she runs a home-based
[1:21:07] business out of her home doesn't she
[1:21:09] right she makes investments out of her
[1:21:11] home she goes out of the home to make
[1:21:13] deals with merchants and ships and all
[1:21:14] these different things but her focus is
[1:21:16] in the home
[1:21:17] and so if you're married that's where
[1:21:19] your focus has to be and you can never
[1:21:21] convince me out of the scriptures or the
[1:21:22] message that a married woman should be
[1:21:24] out working in the workforce unless it's
[1:21:26] absolutely necessary and the minute it
[1:21:28] isn't necessary she should get out of
[1:21:30] there as soon as she can
[1:21:32] right you'll never pull that through the
[1:21:33] scripture unless it's out of necessity
[1:21:35] or as we'll see if she's working with
[1:21:37] her husband and that would be again out
[1:21:39] of necessity her husband's using her out
[1:21:41] of necessity for that we see that in in
[1:21:43] uh
[1:21:44] priscilla and aquila you know when
[1:21:46] they're making tents right
[1:21:48] they were making tents that was their
[1:21:49] work and she worked with them
[1:21:51] with him and the the presumptions they
[1:21:53] didn't have kids or anything it was a
[1:21:54] you know
[1:21:55] a couple without children so they work
[1:21:57] together and that sort of thing but the
[1:21:58] purpose of the life's purpose for a
[1:22:00] woman that's married is that she stays
[1:22:02] in her place and she helps to develop
[1:22:03] that home
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:06] now listen this doesn't all come any
[1:22:07] more naturally than it does for a man to
[1:22:09] get up every morning whether he wants to
[1:22:10] or not whether it's a horrible day you
[1:22:12] know if you're on the tools like brother
[1:22:14] matt and you're called to go out and
[1:22:15] work outside and it's howling and you
[1:22:17] know newfoundland it's always windy
[1:22:19] except this morning right the weather's
[1:22:21] rarely great do you think that brother
[1:22:23] matt wants to go out every morning that
[1:22:24] he's called out to do that of course not
[1:22:27] matt's not sitting there reveling
[1:22:29] in the in the pain and suffering of the
[1:22:31] cold and wind and sleet and rain right
[1:22:33] but he does it anyways
[1:22:35] and it's no more fun to go sit at a desk
[1:22:37] all day either
[1:22:38] some days you're happy to do it some
[1:22:40] days you're not but guess what we do it
[1:22:42] because we're called to do it not
[1:22:43] because it's fun or entertaining or we
[1:22:44] get enjoyment out of it there is a
[1:22:46] benefit to it and there's a satisfaction
[1:22:49] that comes with it but it's not all fun
[1:22:50] and games it's the same for our sisters
[1:22:52] because guess what it's not all fun and
[1:22:54] games to get up and have to clean a
[1:22:55] house every day it's not fun and games
[1:22:57] to get up and have to make a meal every
[1:22:58] day and try and be interesting and try
[1:23:00] and be pretty for your husband and try
[1:23:01] and keep the kids from embarrassing you
[1:23:03] in front of people and
[1:23:04] you know
[1:23:05] it's it's not easy
[1:23:07] it's not easy it is a life's work
[1:23:10] listen we're developing careers as men
[1:23:12] you're developing a career as a wife and
[1:23:14] as a as a mother and you've got to
[1:23:16] develop into it and you've got to grow
[1:23:17] into it you've got to learn and you've
[1:23:19] got to what realize that it's not always
[1:23:21] fun and games and you're going to
[1:23:22] struggle with it at times amen
[1:23:25] but what about the single women now
[1:23:27] i think we preached enough on the
[1:23:28] married women what about the single
[1:23:30] women
[1:23:32] paul said they're focused on the things
[1:23:34] of god how to be holy in god in body and
[1:23:36] spirit
[1:23:37] that's the purpose of a single woman now
[1:23:39] in matthew 19 jesus is speaking he says
[1:23:42] but i say unto you whosoever shall put
[1:23:43] away his wife except to be for
[1:23:45] fornication and shall marry another
[1:23:47] committeth adultery and whoso marrieth
[1:23:49] her which is put away doth commit
[1:23:50] adultery his disciples say unto him if
[1:23:53] the case of the man be so with his wife
[1:23:55] it is not good to marry now i had to
[1:23:57] laugh at this because the disciples were
[1:23:59] thinking hey
[1:24:00] we're men we get married and it goes
[1:24:02] south and it doesn't work out we just
[1:24:04] divorce her and go get another one
[1:24:07] but now jesus says you don't have that
[1:24:08] freedom brothers you're not supposed to
[1:24:10] do it except for one reason and they say
[1:24:12] well if that's the case we better not
[1:24:14] risk getting married at all why would a
[1:24:16] man risk it
[1:24:17] we see so many unhappy marriages
[1:24:19] everybody's getting out of them why
[1:24:20] would we risk an unhappy marriage
[1:24:22] because why divorce was rampant
[1:24:24] because they thought that they could
[1:24:25] divorce for any reason so the disciples
[1:24:27] are saying well if we can't get out of a
[1:24:28] bad marriage then why would we ever get
[1:24:30] into it
[1:24:32] and jesus comes behind and he says he
[1:24:34] said unto them all men cannot receive
[1:24:36] the same save they to whom it's given in
[1:24:39] other words this saying
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:42] what they've just said to him he says
[1:24:44] it's not given for everybody not
[1:24:46] everybody can do what i what you've just
[1:24:48] said and that is stay single
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:51] he says for there are some that are
[1:24:52] eunuchs which were so born from their
[1:24:54] mother's womb and there are some eunuchs
[1:24:56] which are made eunuchs of men and there
[1:24:58] be eunuchs which have made themselves
[1:25:00] eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake
[1:25:02] he that is able to receive it let him
[1:25:04] receive it so that word eunuch
[1:25:07] in a mixed crowd means a man that cannot
[1:25:08] father a child
[1:25:10] okay so he's incapable of producing life
[1:25:13] so jesus lays out three types and the
[1:25:15] first one is people that are born that
[1:25:16] way so you could be born with a
[1:25:18] deformity you could be born with a
[1:25:19] hormonal defect a physical defect of
[1:25:21] some kind and he says you don't have a
[1:25:23] choice if you're that kind of eunuch
[1:25:24] you're born that way and you're you'll
[1:25:26] always be that way the second one were
[1:25:28] those that were made unix of men so
[1:25:29] there was surgical there was a surgical
[1:25:31] procedure that they do for male servants
[1:25:33] especially those that were in and around
[1:25:35] women to make sure they didn't mess
[1:25:37] around with the women
[1:25:38] right and then the third one but let me
[1:25:41] stop there
[1:25:42] because there's some that are made
[1:25:43] eunuchs of men
[1:25:46] and we don't have that today because we
[1:25:47] don't have slaves and we certainly don't
[1:25:49] don't do those type of procedures but we
[1:25:51] do have eunuchs that are made of men by
[1:25:52] circumstance and you'll see that even if
[1:25:55] i could speak of my own mother and
[1:25:56] that's that what she's bound to be
[1:25:58] unmarried by life circumstance amen her
[1:26:01] husband divorced her she's not allowed
[1:26:03] to remarry so my mother is a eunuch
[1:26:05] in terms of she is separated from from
[1:26:07] producing life
[1:26:09] by life circumstances and that is by
[1:26:11] what men not of god that's of men and so
[1:26:14] you have men the same way i know a
[1:26:15] brother
[1:26:16] in the united states and and him and his
[1:26:18] wife are divorced
[1:26:20] and
[1:26:21] everybody has told him brother you can
[1:26:22] remarry and he says i don't feel to
[1:26:24] remarry right he has been made eunuch by
[1:26:27] life circumstance and he believes that
[1:26:28] the the cause of their divorce is not
[1:26:30] one that would allow him to remarry and
[1:26:32] so what it's of it's of men that it's
[1:26:34] happened right so we still have this
[1:26:36] today it's just not by a surgical
[1:26:37] procedure but it's by circumstances in
[1:26:40] life but then there's a third one that
[1:26:41] that he says and it's people that have
[1:26:43] committed themselves to a life of
[1:26:44] singleness
[1:26:45] now committing yourself to a life of
[1:26:47] singleness is not i'm going to be single
[1:26:49] because i can't find somebody to marry
[1:26:50] me or somebody to marry
[1:26:52] it's people that have made a conscious
[1:26:54] decision there's a calling in their life
[1:26:56] and they've said for the sake of the
[1:26:58] kingdom of god i will not be married i'm
[1:27:01] going to hold myself back amen
[1:27:03] and jesus said they're a special type
[1:27:05] because he says you have to be able to
[1:27:06] receive that one
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:09] and in first corinthians 7 37 in in the
[1:27:12] amplified it says whoever is firmly
[1:27:14] established in his heart we read this
[1:27:15] earlier strong in mind and purpose not
[1:27:18] being forced by necessity but having
[1:27:20] control over his own will and desire and
[1:27:23] resolve this in his heart to keep his
[1:27:24] own virginity he's doing well so paul
[1:27:27] and jesus both are saying you got to be
[1:27:28] able to control yourself you can't
[1:27:30] pretend about this one because a man
[1:27:32] that does that does that says he's this
[1:27:34] and he can't control the lust or the
[1:27:36] desires of his flesh is going to get
[1:27:37] into real problems real fast
[1:27:39] right and it's no different with a woman
[1:27:41] they're just less prone to it so he says
[1:27:43] if you're going to do this you better
[1:27:44] make sure that you've got control over
[1:27:46] it don't go around pretending and it's
[1:27:47] okay to to start that path and then say
[1:27:50] i i can't deal with this right because
[1:27:52] remember paul said hey if you can't
[1:27:54] control it's better for you to marry
[1:27:56] right so don't sit there and pretend
[1:27:57] you're controlling it and then you got
[1:27:58] lost running through your life all the
[1:28:00] time amen you've got a besetting sin
[1:28:02] going on there he says you got to be
[1:28:03] able to control it and it's of your own
[1:28:05] it's control over your own body's will
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:10] amen that's for the men and the women
[1:28:12] both
[1:28:13] it's speaking of amen there but remember
[1:28:15] it was addressing the the unmarried
[1:28:16] women as well but if we're looking at
[1:28:18] our single sisters
[1:28:19] what does that singleness with purpose
[1:28:21] look like now
[1:28:22] and the love the beautiful thing about
[1:28:24] this is that we have
[1:28:26] types for both of these the the major
[1:28:27] ones in scripture and in acts 16 it says
[1:28:29] there was a certain woman named lydia a
[1:28:31] cellar of purple of the city of thy
[1:28:33] torah which worshiped god that heard us
[1:28:35] whose heart the lord opened that she
[1:28:37] attended under the things which were
[1:28:39] spoken of paul guess what lydia had a
[1:28:41] conversion here she wasn't a believer
[1:28:44] she was an unbeliever she's in there
[1:28:46] she's she's got her own business she's a
[1:28:48] wealthy woman and she hears the message
[1:28:51] from paul and she has a conversion and
[1:28:53] that she what starts to live what paul
[1:28:55] was telling her about
[1:28:56] right she had the real deal
[1:28:58] but watch what she does it says she was
[1:29:00] baptized and her household and she
[1:29:03] basada saying if you have judged me to
[1:29:05] be faithful to the lord come into my
[1:29:07] house and abide there and she constrains
[1:29:09] us so lydia is wealthy enough to have
[1:29:11] not only a home but a large home with
[1:29:14] servants and employees and big enough to
[1:29:17] host the disciples
[1:29:18] so she's a wealthy woman amen and look
[1:29:20] at what she does as soon as she gets
[1:29:22] that now she's a single woman as far as
[1:29:24] we know now the thing is she's uh that
[1:29:27] roman was in control of thyatira at that
[1:29:28] time and so the belief is that she was
[1:29:30] probably divorced
[1:29:32] so a divorced woman relatively wealthy
[1:29:34] has this big home has this big business
[1:29:37] and everything so she did not start a
[1:29:39] business as a believer
[1:29:41] but she was an entrepreneur
[1:29:44] now as soon as she comes to the message
[1:29:46] can i put it that way
[1:29:47] paul doesn't go to her and say now lydia
[1:29:49] women aren't supposed to be in the
[1:29:51] workplace you need to sell your business
[1:29:52] and you need to stay at home does he
[1:29:55] why because lydia is using what god has
[1:29:57] blessed her with now for the furtherance
[1:30:00] of the kingdom the first thing she does
[1:30:01] is she constrained them do you remember
[1:30:03] when they walked on the road to emmaus
[1:30:05] with jesus
[1:30:06] and at the end of the road what did they
[1:30:07] do they constrained him that meant they
[1:30:10] gave him no option to continue but they
[1:30:12] said you will come in and eat with us
[1:30:14] that's what she said to paul you will
[1:30:16] use my home as a place for outreach
[1:30:18] it'll be a center for you while you're
[1:30:19] here when you're in thyatira you're
[1:30:22] staying with me and i'm going to use it
[1:30:23] for what the glory of the kingdom of god
[1:30:26] they didn't go and say lydia you're a
[1:30:28] single woman you shouldn't have a place
[1:30:29] in the church like this no no no what'd
[1:30:31] they do they said we'll gladly use what
[1:30:33] god has blessed you with for that
[1:30:34] purpose they never corrected her
[1:30:36] they never said you're not allowed to be
[1:30:38] in business
[1:30:39] right you're supposed to be in headship
[1:30:40] unders no no no they let her continue as
[1:30:42] she was as long as she used it for the
[1:30:44] glory of god
[1:30:45] so we don't see in the word where it
[1:30:46] says a woman can't work but it does tell
[1:30:48] us where the woman the married women
[1:30:50] should be and that's in the house right
[1:30:52] but beyond that now we get an example of
[1:30:54] a woman that's working and they never
[1:30:55] tell her she can't do it as long as
[1:30:56] she's using it for the glory of the
[1:30:58] kingdom of god
[1:30:59] amen so single sisters if you're out
[1:31:01] there working we have no single sisters
[1:31:03] here except the very young ones
[1:31:04] relatively young ones but maybe they're
[1:31:06] listening online but single sisters if
[1:31:08] you're out there's working there's
[1:31:09] nothing to say you shouldn't do it in
[1:31:10] the scriptures jethro had his daughters
[1:31:12] working at the well if you'll remember
[1:31:14] right we have priscilla making tents
[1:31:16] with her husband we have lydia here
[1:31:17] running her own business there's nothing
[1:31:19] that says you're not allowed to work
[1:31:20] brother brown never forbids it for them
[1:31:22] either right why because there's no
[1:31:24] scripture to say that you can't do it
[1:31:26] but the scripture gives you a lot of
[1:31:27] other things you should be doing as well
[1:31:28] and you just can't be be ignoring those
[1:31:31] things amen
[1:31:32] but the same thing goes for young men
[1:31:33] we're talking to the sisters this
[1:31:35] morning but young men and men we're not
[1:31:37] just out there to make a bunch of money
[1:31:39] now if you're a young man and you're
[1:31:40] believing you're going to get married
[1:31:41] then what are you doing you're saving
[1:31:43] your money for a home you're saving your
[1:31:44] money for a wedding you're saving your
[1:31:46] money for a vehicle you're saving your
[1:31:47] money to prepare to have a household but
[1:31:49] at the same time you have lots of energy
[1:31:51] and you have lots of time and the
[1:31:52] question is what are you doing with that
[1:31:53] time are you using it to constrain
[1:31:55] people to come and do something for the
[1:31:56] kingdom of god are you constraining
[1:31:58] yourself to do something for the kingdom
[1:31:59] of god are you sitting at home playing
[1:32:01] games having a great time of it
[1:32:03] right we spoke of phoebe last service
[1:32:05] also a single woman presumably i'm
[1:32:07] married we don't really know and what
[1:32:09] does she do she puts everything she's
[1:32:11] got into administration of the church to
[1:32:13] help them out to the point where paul
[1:32:15] sends her on a business trip to go and
[1:32:17] help other churches out and says when
[1:32:19] you when she gets there you do whatever
[1:32:21] she asks you to do why because she
[1:32:23] committed her life to the kingdom
[1:32:24] purpose amen now we see another single
[1:32:27] woman that was focused on being a
[1:32:28] witness in our local community because
[1:32:30] listen as we spoke in the last service
[1:32:33] sisters are not called to teach or
[1:32:34] preach you'll never find it in scripture
[1:32:36] you'll never find in scripture they're
[1:32:38] not a part of the fivefold ministry but
[1:32:40] that doesn't mean you're not called to
[1:32:41] present the gospel
[1:32:43] amen we're all supposed to be presenting
[1:32:45] the gospel but there's a way to do it
[1:32:48] and if we look in acts 9 it says now
[1:32:49] there was that joppa a certain disciple
[1:32:51] named tabitha a disciple
[1:32:54] she's called a disciple not just peter
[1:32:56] james and john disciples but there's a
[1:32:58] woman now that's called a disciple
[1:33:00] that's somebody that has committed their
[1:33:01] life to serving the kingdom of god
[1:33:04] which by interpretation is called dorcas
[1:33:07] this woman was full of good works and
[1:33:09] almost these which she did she's full of
[1:33:11] them this wasn't a part-time job this
[1:33:13] was a full-time gig for her amen this
[1:33:16] was her focus and it came to pass in
[1:33:18] those days that she was sick and died
[1:33:20] whom when they had washed they laid her
[1:33:22] in an upper chamber and for as much as
[1:33:24] little was not a joplin the disciples
[1:33:26] had heard that peter was there they sent
[1:33:27] unto him two men desiring him that he
[1:33:29] would not delay to come to them
[1:33:32] then peter arose and went with them and
[1:33:34] when he was come they brought him into
[1:33:35] the upper chamber and all the widows
[1:33:37] stood by weeping and showing the coats
[1:33:40] and garments which dorcas made while she
[1:33:42] was with them so dorcas was spending all
[1:33:44] of her time money and efforts to do what
[1:33:46] outreach
[1:33:48] simple outreach what going to the needy
[1:33:50] going to the the ones that didn't have
[1:33:52] clothes maybe didn't have food and her
[1:33:53] life was spent to support that ministry
[1:33:57] now maybe she had to work a day job
[1:33:59] i i don't imagine she got all of this
[1:34:01] stuff for free maybe she was working a
[1:34:03] day job and then what did she do take
[1:34:04] that home and she went and used that
[1:34:06] money to help people that had less than
[1:34:07] she did and so when they when she
[1:34:09] finally dies we got a bunch of these
[1:34:11] people gathered around her saying look
[1:34:12] at what she did for the local body
[1:34:15] amen how many of us could say that that
[1:34:18] when we die people would stand around
[1:34:20] and say look at what they did for the
[1:34:21] local body right this is a single woman
[1:34:25] this is what this is the standard the
[1:34:26] gold standard in scripture i would say
[1:34:28] for a single for a single person is that
[1:34:30] everybody's standing around saying what
[1:34:32] a great loss it was that that this woman
[1:34:33] has died because look at how much good
[1:34:35] she did
[1:34:36] and peter put them all forth and kneeled
[1:34:38] down and prayed and turning him to the
[1:34:40] body said tabitha arise and she opened
[1:34:43] her eyes and when she saw peter she sat
[1:34:45] up and he gave her his hand and lifted
[1:34:47] her up and when he had called the saints
[1:34:48] and widows presented her alive what a
[1:34:51] beautiful scene how many people get
[1:34:52] raised from the dead in the scripture
[1:34:54] and yet this is a young single woman
[1:34:56] that gets raised from the dead wasn't
[1:34:58] ministers that got raised from the dead
[1:35:01] right it wasn't it wasn't great deacons
[1:35:03] or or big shot men but it was a a single
[1:35:06] woman that had dedicated her life to the
[1:35:08] widows and to the needy and and the ones
[1:35:10] that needed clothes that's the one that
[1:35:12] peter raised from the dead right that
[1:35:14] tells you how important a single sister
[1:35:17] can be in the local body is that peter
[1:35:19] would call a disciple would come the one
[1:35:21] that was that spoke on the day of
[1:35:23] pentecost would be called over and he
[1:35:25] would raise her from the dead because
[1:35:26] god says she's still needed for the
[1:35:27] kingdom
[1:35:28] that's an amazing effect to have as a
[1:35:30] single person isn't it that you could be
[1:35:32] there and people would say we need her
[1:35:33] we need to raise her from the dead
[1:35:35] that's how important she is to this amen
[1:35:37] why
[1:35:39] how
[1:35:40] cause she lived a life right she didn't
[1:35:42] talk
[1:35:43] she did
[1:35:45] she acted she had a ministry but what
[1:35:47] was it it was showing the loving care of
[1:35:48] christ to those that were in need that's
[1:35:50] something that any of us could do really
[1:35:52] but each one of these sisters found
[1:35:54] purpose in their situation lydia wasn't
[1:35:57] you know uh because when paul comes
[1:35:59] paul's going to bring marriage and
[1:36:00] divorce isn't he
[1:36:01] now lydia as a roman she could remarry
[1:36:04] they were not they were not forbidden to
[1:36:06] to to remarry as a roman
[1:36:08] you know under roman rule and these
[1:36:10] different things women were absolutely
[1:36:11] allowed to remarry but she didn't and
[1:36:13] she couldn't now under this but we don't
[1:36:14] see her sitting there saying oh what was
[1:36:16] me i can't remarry what she embraced her
[1:36:18] position she embraced what god had put
[1:36:21] her into the situation and she found
[1:36:23] purpose in it for the kingdom of god
[1:36:25] so the single sisters are you forbidden
[1:36:27] to study at university no
[1:36:29] scripture doesn't say you can't do it
[1:36:31] are you forbidden to work in the
[1:36:32] workforce no
[1:36:34] amen but the question is and this goes
[1:36:36] for men and women alike what are you
[1:36:38] using those things to achieve every time
[1:36:40] it comes back to motive and objective
[1:36:42] listen if i went to school for
[1:36:43] engineering so that i could make
[1:36:44] hundreds of thousands of dollars and
[1:36:45] become a big shot then guess what my
[1:36:47] motive is wrong
[1:36:49] and same thing for a sister if you're
[1:36:51] going in there to make a bunch of money
[1:36:52] and make a big name and a big career for
[1:36:54] yourself then guess what you're off the
[1:36:56] word
[1:36:56] but so is a man so is a man for doing
[1:36:58] the same thing amen we're supposed to be
[1:37:00] singing seeking our kingdom purpose and
[1:37:02] those things amen are we looking to
[1:37:04] become independent and free thinkers
[1:37:06] are we looking to break the mold because
[1:37:08] if that's the case you're off the word
[1:37:10] that's not what god's going to bless in
[1:37:12] your life you can go there and get
[1:37:13] straight a's and get a great job that
[1:37:14] doesn't mean god's blessed you that just
[1:37:16] means that you're getting what you want
[1:37:17] out of it right
[1:37:19] right sunny skies are not proof of god's
[1:37:21] blessing any more than cloudy days or
[1:37:23] proof of his of his disapproval amen but
[1:37:25] if you're going to university if you're
[1:37:27] going to school for a kingdom purpose
[1:37:28] and god leads you to do it then do it
[1:37:30] embrace it
[1:37:31] i always wish i kind of did school the
[1:37:33] way joe did
[1:37:34] because he embraced it
[1:37:36] i i kept myself as far apart from it as
[1:37:38] i could
[1:37:39] and i was a witness of sorts because
[1:37:41] they saw that i kept myself away from it
[1:37:42] but i never got to really have
[1:37:44] conversations with people the way joe
[1:37:45] did i think if i would have embraced it
[1:37:47] a little more as the will of god then i
[1:37:48] might have had a greater impact on it on
[1:37:50] the people around me amen
[1:37:52] but what as a woman especially if you
[1:37:54] can go into those situations if you can
[1:37:56] keep a straight head on
[1:37:57] right if you can if you can maintain
[1:37:59] your conduct if you can be a witness in
[1:38:00] a testimony then i say god be with you
[1:38:03] because again the scripture doesn't
[1:38:04] forbid it but you better make sure that
[1:38:06] god's calling you to it because how many
[1:38:08] men and women alike have i seen go into
[1:38:10] the halls of university as a believer
[1:38:12] and come out an unbeliever you got to
[1:38:14] know what you are you got to know what
[1:38:16] you believe and if you're going in there
[1:38:17] with any shadows of doubt then your best
[1:38:19] to stay away from it amen
[1:38:21] listen you can have an opportunity to
[1:38:23] testify when they're talking about
[1:38:24] female empowerment and feminism and all
[1:38:26] these things
[1:38:27] you can speak up and say guess what look
[1:38:30] at the damage it's done and you can talk
[1:38:32] about the things that we we see and we
[1:38:34] hear and we preach about over this pope
[1:38:35] but the damage that the world has seen
[1:38:36] because they put women into the
[1:38:37] workforce and destroy motherhood brother
[1:38:39] braham said when they did that they
[1:38:40] broke the back of the nation
[1:38:42] right and we're seeing it today but they
[1:38:44] wouldn't see that right you can still be
[1:38:46] a testimony you can still be a testimony
[1:38:48] in those places amen listen you can go
[1:38:50] start your own business and be like
[1:38:51] lydia
[1:38:53] right and you can be one that that takes
[1:38:55] what god gives you and maybe you help
[1:38:57] somebody else maybe you're not a dorcas
[1:38:58] maybe you can give money to a dorcas to
[1:39:00] help do that you know we can't all be
[1:39:01] missionaries but we can give money to
[1:39:03] missionaries every day
[1:39:05] right there are there are men that have
[1:39:06] committed their lives and then you've
[1:39:08] got jason demars out there and he's a
[1:39:10] full-time missionary that's all he does
[1:39:11] guess what you got money you want to
[1:39:13] send send it to jason to mars right
[1:39:15] you've got evangelists that are
[1:39:16] traveling the globe traveling the
[1:39:17] country day in and day out they would
[1:39:19] love to have money if you can't go do it
[1:39:21] support somebody that would i mean you
[1:39:23] don't always have to be the minister
[1:39:25] sometimes we're most times we're there
[1:39:27] to support them and we'll get into it a
[1:39:28] little bit as we move through this amen
[1:39:30] i know sisters in the message that have
[1:39:32] become both doctors or nurses takes a
[1:39:34] long time to become a doctor minimum
[1:39:36] seven years typically it's eight and
[1:39:38] then a lot of times you got another two
[1:39:39] years on top of that and what did they
[1:39:40] do they didn't go into it for the big
[1:39:42] bucks they went into it because every
[1:39:44] year they take a month off they take all
[1:39:46] of their vacation and they go over
[1:39:48] someplace else usually with the minister
[1:39:50] and they go out and they have special
[1:39:52] meetings and they go and they do a
[1:39:53] medical mission to help the people over
[1:39:54] there the believers and the unbelievers
[1:39:56] alike over in third world countries and
[1:39:58] whatnot so they can do what testify of
[1:40:01] the caring nature of christ and then
[1:40:02] they've got ministers there to preach
[1:40:04] and they've got men and women that are
[1:40:05] in the health care side of things to do
[1:40:07] what help care for the natural sides of
[1:40:09] people's lives amen
[1:40:11] but never forget you can do so much just
[1:40:13] with a simple life at home listen dorcas
[1:40:15] didn't have some big ministry you know
[1:40:18] she didn't have a warehouse full of
[1:40:19] people with sewing machines going day in
[1:40:21] and day out day in and day out but what
[1:40:23] one by one she helped change people's
[1:40:25] lives just with a simple act of kindness
[1:40:27] just with a coat just with a meal
[1:40:28] something like that a single brother a
[1:40:30] single sister i hey when i moved here
[1:40:32] and and we had to make that move at the
[1:40:34] last second you know and and we weren't
[1:40:36] sure if we were going to be able to get
[1:40:36] the boxes in that i called brothers up
[1:40:38] and within an hour we had everybody
[1:40:41] young and old that could make it and we
[1:40:43] moved me and it was no big deal
[1:40:45] right it's the same thing with young
[1:40:47] sisters guess what you've got the
[1:40:48] ability to call up a married sister
[1:40:51] that's frazzled out of her mind and say
[1:40:53] hey do you need me to come watch your
[1:40:54] kids so you can go to a spa for a day
[1:40:56] and
[1:40:57] and tame your frizzled hair and actually
[1:40:59] eat a nice meal with your husband that
[1:41:01] you don't have to cook in these things
[1:41:03] amen you don't always have to be out
[1:41:04] there doing some great big ministry
[1:41:07] so often it's the simple things that are
[1:41:08] going to get you across the line and men
[1:41:10] that are going to build up the character
[1:41:11] in your life that are going to draw you
[1:41:12] into the body
[1:41:14] i mean it's not it's not looking out
[1:41:15] there our first look is always inward
[1:41:17] should always be to our own family and
[1:41:19] then to those that are out of the local
[1:41:20] household of faith and then to the
[1:41:22] global as well and man we've got plenty
[1:41:24] to do here and i guarantee you if you
[1:41:26] don't know something to do talk to a
[1:41:27] sister and she'll tell you hey so-and-so
[1:41:29] could use some help
[1:41:31] hey there's no there's no lack of needs
[1:41:33] amongst us amen everybody could use a
[1:41:36] a helping hand i think
[1:41:38] but i want to close with a bit of an odd
[1:41:39] quote because this kind of wraps up this
[1:41:41] entire series because we've talked about
[1:41:43] boundaries we've talked about purpose
[1:41:45] we've talked about staying in your place
[1:41:47] we've talked about trusting the word of
[1:41:48] god about acting about conduct that is
[1:41:51] according to the word
[1:41:52] and somebody shared this quote with me
[1:41:54] kind of in in general form at the end of
[1:41:56] the last service and i went home and i
[1:41:58] looked it up and i thought it was a
[1:41:59] great way to end all of this for men and
[1:42:01] women alike
[1:42:02] because we stalked in the last service
[1:42:04] how women are not supposed to preach or
[1:42:06] teach and they're forbidden to handle
[1:42:07] the word and we saw the issues that
[1:42:09] happened when eve handled the word of
[1:42:10] god amen but this brother reminded me
[1:42:12] that guess what men are not called to do
[1:42:14] that either
[1:42:16] as in if you're not called to do it then
[1:42:17] you shouldn't be doing it amen that if
[1:42:19] you're not a part of the fivefold
[1:42:20] ministry you should not be out there
[1:42:22] preaching and teaching and trying to
[1:42:23] handle the word of god and he pointed me
[1:42:25] to this quote this is a quote where
[1:42:27] brother branham talks about uzziah now
[1:42:28] uzziah was one of the greatest kings of
[1:42:30] israel when it comes to war
[1:42:32] and things of war because uzziah was a
[1:42:34] great engineer
[1:42:36] and the scripture says that he made
[1:42:37] great engines he made great uh
[1:42:40] inventions war inventions that kept
[1:42:43] anybody from coming after israel
[1:42:45] and what happened is that he became very
[1:42:47] strong nobody would touch him and the
[1:42:50] scripture says when he was strong his
[1:42:52] heart was lifted up
[1:42:54] to his destruction
[1:42:56] because uzziah had kind of you know
[1:42:59] reached his plateau as a king
[1:43:01] and so he said well i'm going to step
[1:43:03] into another role now
[1:43:05] and this is what he did
[1:43:08] he said there we want to
[1:43:09] he said brother braham says this is
[1:43:11] where we want to lessen now he's talking
[1:43:13] about uzziah uzziah went in and he tried
[1:43:15] to take over the priesthood role he
[1:43:17] tried to burn incense in the temple he
[1:43:19] says there's where we want to lessen now
[1:43:20] if this man which god had blessed in his
[1:43:23] capacity but he wasn't satisfied with
[1:43:25] that he wanted to take somebody else's
[1:43:27] place uzziah was a tremendous king and
[1:43:29] they were being they were benefiting and
[1:43:31] they were being blessed under his
[1:43:32] kingship but he says he wasn't satisfied
[1:43:34] he wanted to go take somebody else's
[1:43:36] place as congressman upshaw said you you
[1:43:38] can't be nothing that you ain't
[1:43:41] so that's about true you've got to stay
[1:43:43] in your calling where god called you to
[1:43:45] now as long as he remained king he was a
[1:43:48] blessing to the people being a king but
[1:43:50] when he thought he was a minister then
[1:43:52] he thought because god had blessed him
[1:43:54] he could be anything he wanted to be but
[1:43:56] he was the blessing to the people as a
[1:43:58] king but not a blessing he became a
[1:44:00] curse upon them when he tried to take
[1:44:02] the minister's place
[1:44:03] and we have a lot of that he says
[1:44:05] everybody wants to pack the ball see
[1:44:07] he's talking about football now when
[1:44:09] you're playing a ball game as it's
[1:44:10] football season the thing we want to do
[1:44:13] is not everybody try to take the ball
[1:44:14] away from the man that's got it
[1:44:16] he's trying to guard that man protect
[1:44:18] him let him get through we're trying to
[1:44:21] make a goal see now you imagine okay you
[1:44:24] know they snapped the football goes to
[1:44:26] the quarterback and he hands it to the
[1:44:28] running back
[1:44:29] running back his name is running and
[1:44:31] he's back that means he's the guy who's
[1:44:33] supposed to run with the ball
[1:44:34] guess what a receiver is not supposed to
[1:44:36] run with the ball he's supposed to
[1:44:37] receive the ball right a tackle is
[1:44:39] supposed to do what
[1:44:41] tackle right running back is the guy
[1:44:43] supposed to run with the ball but he's
[1:44:44] saying you give the ball to the running
[1:44:45] back and then as he's going by and
[1:44:48] you're on his team if you try and take
[1:44:49] the ball from him you're not going to
[1:44:51] score
[1:44:51] if you say i want to be the one that
[1:44:53] gets the touchdown you're not going to
[1:44:55] score because a kingdom divided against
[1:44:57] itself can't stand right so he says
[1:44:59] you're not supposed to be trying to
[1:45:00] score you're supposed to be trying to
[1:45:02] let the teammate that has the ball score
[1:45:04] so don't try and take the ball don't try
[1:45:06] and pretend you're the running back when
[1:45:07] you're not the running back protect the
[1:45:09] running back so he can score
[1:45:11] he says but you could imagine a team so
[1:45:13] untrained as to find one man their own
[1:45:14] man with the ball running to the field
[1:45:16] goal and then has tried to
[1:45:18] instead of trying to knock the enemy
[1:45:19] away from him the opposing team to let
[1:45:21] your old man that's got the ball take
[1:45:23] off with it and every man trying to take
[1:45:25] the ball out of his hand
[1:45:26] why you're bound to lose can you imagine
[1:45:28] in hockey maybe we understand hockey a
[1:45:30] little better if your teammates got the
[1:45:31] puck and you keep trying to take your
[1:45:33] puck away from the teammates so you can
[1:45:34] go score the goal you'll never score the
[1:45:36] goal
[1:45:37] right
[1:45:37] but if you can help protect him get in a
[1:45:39] place where he can pass it to you
[1:45:40] whatever you're going to score goals
[1:45:42] aren't you but you can't keep trying to
[1:45:43] take the puck away
[1:45:44] he says today we have the same thing
[1:45:47] when we see god come on the scene and
[1:45:49] going to bless a certain thing let's
[1:45:51] keep all the enemies away from it
[1:45:54] let's use our influences as tackles
[1:45:57] not
[1:45:58] runners
[1:45:59] tackles that protects the runner lets
[1:46:01] him pack the ball through because
[1:46:03] there's no opposition all he has to do
[1:46:06] is keep running can you imagine
[1:46:08] a football player that is so well
[1:46:10] protected that nobody can lay a hand on
[1:46:12] him that's the goal isn't it is that as
[1:46:15] soon as they snap that ball and give it
[1:46:16] to him all the tackles hit and they
[1:46:19] create an open path where he can slip
[1:46:21] through the line without ever being
[1:46:23] touched and he can break all the way
[1:46:24] through to the end zone
[1:46:26] can you imagine you're not allowed to do
[1:46:27] it in hockey because it'd be
[1:46:28] interference but if you basically went
[1:46:29] ahead of the guy with the puck and just
[1:46:31] started knocking everybody down his way
[1:46:32] so that he never had to do anything and
[1:46:34] just go in and shoot on the goalie and
[1:46:35] score maybe knock the goalie down as
[1:46:36] well right not allowed to do it but can
[1:46:38] you imagine how easy it would be if
[1:46:40] everybody was focused on letting the one
[1:46:42] man carry that puck or that ball rather
[1:46:44] than trying to do it themselves
[1:46:46] because he says there's one man that's
[1:46:48] ordained to do it don't try and be that
[1:46:50] man if you're not him
[1:46:52] right
[1:46:52] but look look what he says he says let's
[1:46:54] use our influences as tackles
[1:46:57] because so often what we want to do is
[1:46:59] use our influence to do something
[1:47:02] he's saying let your influence clear the
[1:47:04] way for the gospel
[1:47:06] not do something else not do something
[1:47:08] for your ministry don't try and have
[1:47:10] your ministry going on while the other
[1:47:11] ministry's there let that ministry
[1:47:13] protect that ministry is what he's
[1:47:14] saying right when you got a man carrying
[1:47:16] the ball don't say well i've got a ball
[1:47:18] too no you block for the man that's got
[1:47:20] the ball
[1:47:22] he says we should all be tackles
[1:47:25] all of us
[1:47:26] tackles if you're not in the ministry
[1:47:28] don't try and be in the ministry protect
[1:47:30] the ministry let them carry the ball
[1:47:32] he says i speak worldwide you know for
[1:47:34] the full gospel businessmen around the
[1:47:36] world organizing chapters not long ago
[1:47:38] when i believe i was at kingston jamaica
[1:47:40] when they had castro and all them there
[1:47:41] at this meeting or we had been down to
[1:47:43] this place that's the way it was and the
[1:47:44] celebrity of all through the island was
[1:47:46] up there and those businessmen was
[1:47:48] trying to preach the gospel so brother
[1:47:50] i'm speaking by experience now he says
[1:47:52] he's out of his place we preachers have
[1:47:54] a hard enough time to keep it level
[1:47:58] and they use every little influence they
[1:48:01] can find and every little technique this
[1:48:05] way and that way and keeps it so
[1:48:07] scrupled up you don't know what to do
[1:48:09] now he says what influences and
[1:48:12] techniques can i say it this way tools
[1:48:15] what is it you think that because you
[1:48:17] have a new technique you have a new tool
[1:48:19] that that means that you're ordained to
[1:48:21] carry it guess what that's not the way
[1:48:23] this works amen when it comes to
[1:48:25] spreading the gospel there's a five-fold
[1:48:27] ministry that is anointed for this
[1:48:29] purpose and they alone are anointed to
[1:48:31] do it i don't care if you're online i
[1:48:33] don't care if you're doing podcasts i
[1:48:34] don't care if you're on youtube whatever
[1:48:36] it might be that is not the way to
[1:48:39] spread the gospel if you're not a
[1:48:40] minister a minister spreads the gospel
[1:48:44] brother brown makes no bones about it he
[1:48:46] says that and he says what when you do
[1:48:48] it he says preachers have a hard enough
[1:48:49] time keeping things straight he says so
[1:48:51] don't you try because you definitely
[1:48:52] won't do it because when you do you get
[1:48:55] things so scrupled up what you do you
[1:48:57] cause a bigger mess
[1:48:58] the thing to do is protect this message
[1:49:01] the way it's going stay right with it
[1:49:03] and knock everything away from it if
[1:49:05] we're ever going to cross the goal line
[1:49:07] all right and i said brethren there's
[1:49:09] something wrong you fellows are
[1:49:11] businessmen the first place you don't
[1:49:13] understand the approach you don't
[1:49:15] understand the approach to the ministry
[1:49:17] because the ministry is a god called
[1:49:20] gift god has said in the church first
[1:49:22] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:49:25] and pastors god set them in there for
[1:49:27] the perfecting of the church
[1:49:29] okay you're on dangerous ground
[1:49:31] but listen to this because he brings it
[1:49:33] right to every one of us
[1:49:35] businessmen should testify
[1:49:38] woman housewife no matter if you're the
[1:49:40] maid in somebody's house
[1:49:42] testify do everything you can for the
[1:49:45] kingdom but don't ever inject your own
[1:49:47] ideas
[1:49:49] i.e i'm a minister
[1:49:51] just say what the message says and keep
[1:49:53] going on c and then maybe you have some
[1:49:55] influence
[1:49:56] but don't try to preach now until god
[1:49:58] you know calls you
[1:50:02] so
[1:50:02] how do you know you're called
[1:50:04] to preach
[1:50:06] you have a pulpit
[1:50:09] he says it's five full ministry alone
[1:50:10] preaches so if you don't have a pulpit
[1:50:13] somewhere
[1:50:14] then you're not supposed to be preaching
[1:50:16] that's what he's saying you're not
[1:50:17] supposed to be handling the word and by
[1:50:19] that i mean if you're not out there
[1:50:20] ministering the gospel to people
[1:50:23] actively as a calling then you should
[1:50:25] never do it you don't start one day and
[1:50:27] turn it off the next day it's either
[1:50:29] you're it or you're not it amen
[1:50:32] what does he say businessmen testify
[1:50:34] women testify house wives testify tell
[1:50:39] what god has done for you
[1:50:42] tell what god has done for you don't try
[1:50:44] and go tr preach serpent seed and and
[1:50:46] godhead and all these things that's not
[1:50:48] meant for you
[1:50:49] but you can tell what god did for you
[1:50:51] and that's the greatest impact you'll
[1:50:53] ever have is a life change that's what
[1:50:55] brother cadre diggs was talking about he
[1:50:56] said the message changed me
[1:50:59] and that's why i can testify and that's
[1:51:00] why i preach the way i do is because i
[1:51:02] got a life change and i testify of the
[1:51:04] life change first and foremost he says
[1:51:06] don't try and preach now until god calls
[1:51:08] you just stay right with that your
[1:51:10] testimony because if you don't you'll
[1:51:13] get off in the wrong category and then
[1:51:15] you'll mess up everything that's it and
[1:51:18] it doesn't please god at all
[1:51:20] this is malachi 4 saint this isn't me
[1:51:22] right don't get out there and try and
[1:51:25] preach if you're not a minister
[1:51:27] so the qualifications mean you are
[1:51:28] called to it and you are a man and you
[1:51:31] are welcome in a pulpit somewhere that's
[1:51:34] the easy way if you don't meet any of
[1:51:35] those qualifications don't do it
[1:51:38] he says this proves it here when this
[1:51:39] king now when he was rebuked and told
[1:51:41] the truth by the minister of the
[1:51:43] building and tried to tell him he was
[1:51:44] wrong that god called that for only
[1:51:46] aaron's descendants to do it and they
[1:51:48] were consecrated to that service only
[1:51:50] that's all they were to do they were
[1:51:52] consecrated for that and a king no
[1:51:54] matter how righteous he was or how much
[1:51:56] god had blessed him he had no right to
[1:51:58] burn incense he was taking the priest's
[1:52:01] place and he should not do it
[1:52:03] and when he was rebuked he got roth
[1:52:07] his temper flew up and right while his
[1:52:09] temper flew up leprosy appeared in his
[1:52:11] face he broke out with leprosy and then
[1:52:14] he dropped the sensor and ran out of the
[1:52:15] building see trying to impersonate
[1:52:18] somebody else we shouldn't do that in
[1:52:20] his anger he done wrong and he was
[1:52:22] smitten oh it was certainly a lesson to
[1:52:24] this to this young prophet to see no
[1:52:26] matter how great the man was he had to
[1:52:29] abide in his calling
[1:52:31] amen we're talking about places we're
[1:52:34] talking about men's roles we're talking
[1:52:36] about women's roles we're talking about
[1:52:37] single men married men single women
[1:52:39] married women we're talking about
[1:52:41] ministry all of these different things
[1:52:42] you've got to be able to stay in your
[1:52:44] place
[1:52:45] you've got to be where god called you
[1:52:47] amen think of the woman at the well
[1:52:49] i think it's my favorite story in the
[1:52:51] bible because there's so much in there
[1:52:52] there is so much in there there's
[1:52:54] redemption there's predestination but i
[1:52:56] want you to point to what he talks about
[1:52:58] when he says go out there and testify
[1:53:01] you're a woman testify
[1:53:03] don't preach
[1:53:04] the woman at the well she had just met
[1:53:06] the messiah she had placed him in the
[1:53:08] scripture and she had an experience that
[1:53:11] lined up with the word of god
[1:53:13] okay if there was ever a time to preach
[1:53:15] that was the time
[1:53:17] why look at the last time that they look
[1:53:19] at the time that the church had that in
[1:53:21] the day of pentecost what happened as
[1:53:22] soon as they had a word experience they
[1:53:25] went out and they preached and what did
[1:53:26] peter do he brought 3 000 souls to
[1:53:28] christ right
[1:53:29] so listen if this happened to peter
[1:53:30] peter probably would have went and
[1:53:32] preached but what did the woman at the
[1:53:33] well do
[1:53:34] she's met the messiah he's discerned the
[1:53:36] thoughts and infants of the heart she's
[1:53:38] received it she's placed him as the
[1:53:40] messiah in the scripture and she runs
[1:53:42] into the town
[1:53:44] does she go into the town square set up
[1:53:45] a chair and start preaching to them
[1:53:47] opening up the scriptures pointing to
[1:53:49] her experience pointing to what the
[1:53:51] scriptures say and sharing everything
[1:53:53] that that he lined up with no
[1:53:56] what does it do
[1:53:58] john 4 the woman then left her water pot
[1:54:00] and went her way into the city and say
[1:54:02] it to the men now watch does she preach
[1:54:04] teach quote
[1:54:06] scriptures no
[1:54:09] she said come
[1:54:10] see a man which told me all the things
[1:54:13] that ever i did
[1:54:15] is not this the christ
[1:54:17] what'd she do she testified of her
[1:54:19] experience and all she did was ask the
[1:54:21] question
[1:54:22] isn't this the messiah she didn't say
[1:54:24] this is the messiah she said isn't this
[1:54:26] the messiah she asked them a question
[1:54:28] and what did she do she pointed them
[1:54:30] back to the man that gave her that
[1:54:31] experience
[1:54:33] she pointed them back to christ she
[1:54:34] didn't point to herself she said come
[1:54:36] listen to him she didn't say listen to
[1:54:38] me
[1:54:39] right she didn't say listen to me she
[1:54:41] said come listen to him
[1:54:43] it said and they went out of the city
[1:54:44] and came unto him
[1:54:46] so when the samaritans were come unto
[1:54:47] him they besought him that he would
[1:54:49] tarry with them and he abode there two
[1:54:50] days and many more believed because of
[1:54:54] his own word
[1:54:57] and they said unto the woman now we
[1:54:59] believe not because of thy saying for we
[1:55:02] have heard him ourselves and know that
[1:55:04] this is indeed the christ the savior of
[1:55:06] the world she didn't sway them with her
[1:55:08] words she didn't convert them with her
[1:55:09] words what she did she bought them to
[1:55:11] one that could convert them right all
[1:55:13] she did was she pointed to a minister
[1:55:15] and she said go listen to the minister
[1:55:17] i'm not going to tell you anything i'll
[1:55:18] tell you the effect of that minister but
[1:55:20] you go listen to him and see if you can
[1:55:21] agree with me and listen it says what
[1:55:24] many more believe because of his word
[1:55:26] they came to the source they went to one
[1:55:28] that was anointed to change their lives
[1:55:30] one that was anointed
[1:55:32] to draw them to him right not to a woman
[1:55:35] drew them to the word she pointed to the
[1:55:37] word and let the word do the work in
[1:55:38] them amen but what started it her
[1:55:41] testimony
[1:55:42] without her testimony
[1:55:44] there was nothing
[1:55:46] you know what so often the problem is is
[1:55:48] we preach the word because we lack a
[1:55:50] testimony because anybody can anybody
[1:55:52] can sit here and point to doctrines and
[1:55:54] mysteries and and truths that have been
[1:55:55] revealed and all these different things
[1:55:57] but the harder thing is to talk about a
[1:55:58] testimony because that's something we
[1:56:00] need to have on a weekly basis
[1:56:01] right maybe daily
[1:56:03] i i'd certainly like to have a daily
[1:56:05] testimony but you know what every week
[1:56:07] we ought to be experiencing god if i
[1:56:08] could put it that way we ought to be
[1:56:09] able to tell somebody this is what i've
[1:56:11] been praying about this is what i've
[1:56:12] been dealing with this is how i was
[1:56:14] feeling this is who i was and this is
[1:56:16] the way it is today praise the lord amen
[1:56:19] i was so blessed when brother bob sent
[1:56:20] that prayer request for for sister
[1:56:22] beverly's uh uh grandson right jack
[1:56:25] and guess what the next day he's fine
[1:56:29] why i believe it's because we prayed
[1:56:31] i'm simple enough to believe we prayed
[1:56:34] it happened i would go testify of that
[1:56:36] if somebody says what's going on your
[1:56:38] church i say we prayed for a young man
[1:56:40] and he was a he was doing horribly he's
[1:56:42] been horribly before we prayed and the
[1:56:43] next day he was good
[1:56:45] amen right that's a testimony that's
[1:56:48] what i want to tell people about is is
[1:56:50] what the life of christ moving not just
[1:56:51] the doctrine of christ it's easy to
[1:56:53] focus on the doctrine but where's the
[1:56:55] life because that's what we're supposed
[1:56:56] to be is the life of it amen
[1:56:59] but abraham says now we find out though
[1:57:01] a good man blessed of god if god blesses
[1:57:03] you you stay in the category that god
[1:57:05] has called you in if it's a housewife
[1:57:07] remain a housewife if it's in business
[1:57:09] remain in that business reflecting god
[1:57:12] reflecting god
[1:57:14] doesn't mean you can't be a witness but
[1:57:16] do it by reflecting god
[1:57:18] and whatever god has called you to let
[1:57:20] it be that because he wants you to be a
[1:57:22] real housewife to reflect your influence
[1:57:24] upon another person that would want to
[1:57:28] be a good housewife
[1:57:30] right how many times do you go out and
[1:57:31] you see these housewives and they're
[1:57:33] done up to the nines and their kids are
[1:57:35] horrible and their relationships are
[1:57:37] horrible and they're in a god forsaken
[1:57:40] marriage and they'll see our sisters
[1:57:41] here and they're happy and they're
[1:57:43] content in their simple little life
[1:57:45] what do they see they see somebody there
[1:57:47] that's got something they don't have and
[1:57:49] it can be a witness to them that there
[1:57:50] is more to this than just living the
[1:57:52] life that they have right
[1:57:54] he says if you're a good businessman let
[1:57:56] your life so be that it will reflect
[1:57:57] jesus christ in your business with
[1:58:00] integrity honesty and integrity and with
[1:58:03] things that really mean something right
[1:58:06] because what happens is when you get
[1:58:08] into business sometimes you get into
[1:58:09] fights don't you you get into issues
[1:58:11] with customers you get into issues with
[1:58:12] clients and guess what a believer is
[1:58:14] going to say be able to say this doesn't
[1:58:17] matter enough for me to fight about it
[1:58:19] i'll let you have it
[1:58:21] i'll pay the price i'll let you have the
[1:58:23] benefit of a doubt it'll go against my
[1:58:25] books not against your books what
[1:58:26] because you're a believer and you're not
[1:58:28] trusting in that client or that customer
[1:58:30] you're trusting in god and all you care
[1:58:32] about is am i witnessing and testifying
[1:58:34] of the goodness of god in this business
[1:58:36] in this business
[1:58:38] he says why because somebody is watching
[1:58:41] your life
[1:58:42] not listening to your words
[1:58:44] watching your life
[1:58:46] you're influencing somebody god has to
[1:58:49] have a real housewife god has to have a
[1:58:51] real teenager in school god has to have
[1:58:54] a real minister a real businessman
[1:58:56] somebody that will reflect him because
[1:58:58] there they see in you christ
[1:59:02] no matter what the rest of the world has
[1:59:03] got to do that has not one thing to do
[1:59:05] with you or i
[1:59:07] don't get caught up in what's going on
[1:59:09] in around the world don't get caught up
[1:59:10] in what people are caught up in we are
[1:59:12] responsible to god for our lives and for
[1:59:16] our experience with christ
[1:59:19] now we find out that it is trying to
[1:59:21] take the minister's place uzziah and
[1:59:23] someone telling him he's out of his
[1:59:25] place telling him he shouldn't do it
[1:59:26] he's out of place he became angered
[1:59:28] angered he was so angered till his face
[1:59:30] turned red see we must be able to sit
[1:59:33] and take correction
[1:59:34] some of them won't do it i went to
[1:59:36] meetings and i've sit in auditoriums and
[1:59:38] you get up
[1:59:40] and some people come in and sit down
[1:59:41] just a few minutes if you say one word
[1:59:44] they don't agree with they're gone see
[1:59:47] flying up
[1:59:48] amen we need to stay in our god ordained
[1:59:51] positions the musicians would come amen
[1:59:53] amen god gives us a place to stay
[1:59:56] and he protects us there he blesses us
[1:59:58] there as long as we'll stay in that
[2:00:00] position amen it's never about
[2:00:01] capability
[2:00:03] it's never about capability if it's
[2:00:04] about capability most of us would never
[2:00:06] be qualified amen but what does he do is
[2:00:08] he grows us and he changes us and he
[2:00:11] puts us into that place until we can
[2:00:13] what manifest christ
[2:00:15] amen where out of nothing comes
[2:00:16] something right we're out of a life that
[2:00:19] that you know the way we used to live
[2:00:20] the the the selfishness of our life the
[2:00:23] the inward looking all the time the the
[2:00:25] the pride
[2:00:26] you know the the seeking the things of
[2:00:28] the world the chasing the almighty
[2:00:30] dollar you know focus more on our
[2:00:32] reputation than the reality of god in
[2:00:34] our lives and these different things he
[2:00:35] can take all of that take all of that if
[2:00:38] we'll stay in our place amen when we
[2:00:40] don't think because we're good that
[2:00:41] means we get to do something else
[2:00:43] sometimes he just wants you to stay good
[2:00:45] where you're at
[2:00:46] right there's not always a next step
[2:00:48] right you're not always called to a next
[2:00:50] thing sometimes you're there just to be
[2:00:51] an example of
[2:00:53] maybe not perfection but christ-like
[2:00:56] nature in the place that you're at
[2:00:58] there's not always a next step right a
[2:01:00] man doesn't automatically once he once
[2:01:02] he is as amazing as a father and as a
[2:01:05] husband automatically step into another
[2:01:06] ministry sometimes your ministry is to
[2:01:09] help another ministry and that's ir is a
[2:01:11] help but sometimes he will sometimes
[2:01:13] he'll take you and he'll say okay
[2:01:14] there's a next step there's a next
[2:01:16] opportunity but it's not always that way
[2:01:18] and i think that's a danger so often as
[2:01:19] we'll sit there and we feel like we've
[2:01:21] reached where we need to reach and we
[2:01:23] say there's got to be something more
[2:01:24] there isn't always something more
[2:01:25] sometimes it's helping somebody else get
[2:01:27] to be that something more you know to
[2:01:29] step up into it amen you know we read
[2:01:31] the scriptures where it said the aged
[2:01:32] sisters teach the younger ones right
[2:01:35] you're there sister maureen sister
[2:01:36] brenda sister betty these different ones
[2:01:38] they're there to now do what pass on
[2:01:41] what they've learned the older brothers
[2:01:42] to pass on their wisdom to pass on their
[2:01:44] strength to calm things down when us
[2:01:46] young men get younger men
[2:01:48] i'm no longer young
[2:01:50] when us younger men we tend to move
[2:01:52] quickly don't we and what do they do
[2:01:53] they slow our role a bit they teach us
[2:01:55] to wait on the lord don't be in such a
[2:01:57] hurry
[2:01:58] you know
[2:01:59] to teach us how to love our wives to
[2:02:01] show us what that means that continuity
[2:02:03] that consistency to get our wives to the
[2:02:05] place where they can trust us not just
[2:02:07] because they have to but because they
[2:02:08] want to amend if we can just stay where
[2:02:10] god has put us amen for brothers we're
[2:02:13] called to be christ-like and that is
[2:02:14] always first loving
[2:02:16] loving is always the first thing for
[2:02:19] christ what did paul say he says
[2:02:21] husbands love your wives
[2:02:23] his first command was not provide
[2:02:25] it was love and then we've got to love
[2:02:27] them and that love is always first
[2:02:29] sacrificial and then after that where
[2:02:30] providers we're protectors amen and
[2:02:33] we're gracious when we do it for sisters
[2:02:35] you're called to be like the spotless
[2:02:37] bride of christ and that first thing is
[2:02:38] always obedient and submissive
[2:02:41] and then after that it's committed in
[2:02:43] working to support the vision of the
[2:02:44] headship that you're under amen let's
[2:02:46] stand together if we would i want to
[2:02:48] read one last quote
[2:02:50] he says look
[2:02:52] it's coming to a place friend where the
[2:02:53] world is so awful it's going to make you
[2:02:56] prove every inch of ground you stand on
[2:02:58] satan's going to do it and it's coming
[2:03:00] to a time where impersonations and
[2:03:02] carnal thinking is going to be
[2:03:04] circumcised from the real true body of
[2:03:06] christ
[2:03:07] and he's going to have a body that's
[2:03:09] pure
[2:03:10] and holy and filled with his spirit
[2:03:13] walking in his spirit and doing the
[2:03:15] works that he did he says be faithful to
[2:03:17] that
[2:03:18] why because the world's got a they've
[2:03:20] got a fast food recipe for everything
[2:03:23] right
[2:03:24] a great meal is not made quickly
[2:03:26] right if you want to put flavor into
[2:03:28] something you don't just dump a bunch of
[2:03:30] stuff on it's got to soak it's got to
[2:03:31] marinate in these different things right
[2:03:33] if you want to do something that's going
[2:03:35] to last it takes a while to build it
[2:03:37] right quality doesn't come quickly right
[2:03:39] and this is the long road this is a long
[2:03:41] haul for believers amen and it what the
[2:03:45] the temptation for us is going to be
[2:03:47] that the world offers us a quick return
[2:03:49] a quick change a quick effect it's not
[2:03:51] the way he says be faithful to that what
[2:03:53] walking in the spirit putting in the
[2:03:55] time
[2:03:56] he says they want something real they're
[2:03:58] hungry and thirsting to find the real
[2:04:00] thing they don't want psychology
[2:04:02] they don't want some intellectual speech
[2:04:05] they want something that gives them the
[2:04:07] assurance
[2:04:08] something that makes this bible live
[2:04:11] again
[2:04:12] amen thy kingdom come
[2:04:13] let it live in me
[2:04:15] right isn't that what we want
[2:04:18] living in me i don't i don't want to be
[2:04:19] a talker i want to be a walker i want to
[2:04:22] be a liver
[2:04:24] not a liver organ somebody that lives
[2:04:26] amen somebody that's alive somebody's
[2:04:28] got the holy spirit moving in my life
[2:04:29] daily to where maybe i would shut my
[2:04:31] mouth more
[2:04:32] and live a little more
[2:04:34] in that time amen
[2:04:36] amen we need grace we need grace for
[2:04:38] each other we need grace for ourselves
[2:04:40] sometimes you look in the mirror and you
[2:04:42] say i should be further ahead than where
[2:04:43] i am
[2:04:44] but guess what this is all in god's
[2:04:46] hands
[2:04:47] they will preach on it soon the
[2:04:49] redemptive process has nothing to do
[2:04:50] with the redeemed
[2:04:52] it's the redeemer
[2:04:54] that does all the work
[2:04:56] amen we don't sit here we can't sit here
[2:04:58] and say well i'm not this and i'm not
[2:04:59] that because the redemptive process is
[2:05:01] in his time and his season and he's the
[2:05:03] one that's doing that work amen the idea
[2:05:06] is to stay with it stay with the word
[2:05:08] amen trust the word let god move in our
[2:05:10] lives to the place where you can say
[2:05:12] he's got a body here on earth and i'm a
[2:05:13] part of it because the holy spirit is
[2:05:15] working in me amen
[2:05:17] god help us to believe him enough to let
[2:05:18] him change us to let us stand still when
[2:05:21] things don't seem to be working to have
[2:05:23] patience to just let him put that work
[2:05:25] all the way through to the end amen to
[2:05:27] where we see christ in us not just him
[2:05:29] seeing us because it says we'll see
[2:05:30] ourselves he's not just going to see it
[2:05:32] but we'll see exactly what he's done in
[2:05:34] us amen amen let's bow our heads
[2:05:36] heavenly father
[2:05:38] lord the conclusion to this long series
[2:05:42] lord and i know it's been a great
[2:05:43] challenge for me personally
[2:05:46] lord and i feel if
[2:05:48] anyone feels targeted lord
[2:05:51] lord that if anybody feels it was
[2:05:53] focused on them lord
[2:05:55] that they realize that it's your holy
[2:05:56] spirit moving heavenly father
[2:05:59] lord there's many things i don't know
[2:06:00] about there are some things i do know
[2:06:02] about but lord i believe each one of us
[2:06:04] has had our lives touched lord where we
[2:06:06] need correction where we need to come up
[2:06:08] a little higher lord sometimes a lot
[2:06:10] higher i can say for myself and lord
