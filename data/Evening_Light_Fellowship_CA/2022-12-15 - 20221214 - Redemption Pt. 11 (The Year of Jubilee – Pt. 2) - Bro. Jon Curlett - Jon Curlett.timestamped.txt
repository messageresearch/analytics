[39:35] humble itself before your word even so
[39:38] Lord we want to give you the the honor

[40:09] name we're praying it amen and amen God
[40:13] bless you thank you musicians
[40:15] I'm in good to be back and
[40:17] still a small group we've got sister
[40:19] Delfina back praise the Lord we've got
[40:21] brother Paul back praise the Lord and
[40:23] then we've lost the couples
[40:25] anyways trusting his brother Dale prayed
[40:27] that God will touch each one and bring
[40:28] him back to us amen good to have brother
[40:30] Joe back safely and I said I guess we'll
[40:33] see you there tonight and he said yes
[40:35] and then he said no we're leaving late
[40:36] so it kind of closed the window on that
[40:38] but I said we missed him playing the
[40:40] bass so much that we canceled two
[40:42] Services while he was gone
[40:44] I meant so anyways uh very tired this
[40:47] evening Samuel's been keeping us up a
[40:49] lot at night so just covet your prayers
[40:51] it's even worse for Blanca because she's
[40:53] the one that has to get up with him but
[40:54] he's been waking me up as well so just
[40:56] praying the Lord would help him he's
[40:57] just not back to his normal self from
[40:59] being sick amen also we have sister
[41:01] Rochelle's family will be traveling I
[41:03] guess next week sometime so we want to
[41:06] remember them in prayer it travels
[41:08] getting better it seems but it's also
[41:10] the winter season so we want to remember
[41:12] them as they travel that God would keep
[41:13] them safe and give them an enjoyable
[41:15] time as they come over to the wonderful
[41:17] land that is Newfoundland amen amen
[41:20] let's go in our scriptures if we would
[41:21] to Deuteronomy 15 I do have to apologize
[41:24] apparently I've been clipping my my uh
[41:27] scriptures occasionally and I'm putting
[41:29] when I copy them in sometimes I miss a
[41:31] number so I think last time it was
[41:33] Deuteronomy 5 instead of 15 at some
[41:35] points as I was looking through my notes
[41:36] so if I've clipped that forgive me it's
[41:38] not intentional but sometimes I just mix
[41:41] stuff up when I copy and paste but
[41:42] hopefully I've got it right here tonight
[41:44] amen Deuteronomy 15 verse 12 this is
[41:46] where we read last week last service it
[41:48] says and if thy brother and Hebrew man
[41:50] or in Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and
[41:53] serve thee six years than in the seventh
[41:54] year Thou shalt let him go free from
[41:56] thee and when thou sendest him out free
[41:58] from thee Thou shalt not let him go away
[42:00] empty Thou shalt furnish him liberally
[42:02] out of thy flock and out of thy floor
[42:04] and out of thy winepress of that where
[42:06] with the Lord thy God hath blessed thee
[42:09] Thou shalt give unto him and thou shalt
[42:12] remember that thou was the bondman in
[42:14] the land of Egypt and the Lord thy God
[42:16] redeemed thee therefore I command thee
[42:18] this thing today and it shall be if he
[42:21] say unto thee I will not go away from
[42:23] thee because he loveth thee and thine
[42:25] house because he is well with thee then
[42:27] Thou shalt taken all and thrusted
[42:30] through his ear into the door and he
[42:32] shall be unto thy servant forever and
[42:34] also unto thy maidservant shalt thou do
[42:37] likewise amen God bless his word you may
[42:39] be seated this evening I want to pick up
[42:41] right where we left off and
[42:43] we're going to continue and we're going
[42:45] to take the second part of the Year
[42:46] Jubilee I think there'll be one more
[42:47] after this Lord willing but we start
[42:49] with such a strange scripture and we
[42:51] kind of close with that in the last
[42:53] service and we talked about why a slave
[42:55] would stick around in a situation like
[42:57] that you know you would think that the
[42:58] the Natural Instinct for somebody that's
[43:00] put into bondage that somebody's a debt
[43:03] slave that's somebody that's committed
[43:04] crime or whatever it might be that put
[43:06] them in the prison that put them into
[43:07] slavery what is it that would keep them
[43:10] there and we talked about how they would
[43:11] get bound uh potentially to a a a
[43:14] non-hebrew uh a gentile slave and they'd
[43:17] marry them to that person with the hopes
[43:19] that when the time came that they could
[43:20] go free that they'd stick around but
[43:22] brother Branham approaches it from a
[43:24] much different situation that was a
[43:26] historical uh way of looking at it
[43:28] perhaps but brother Branham approaches
[43:30] this from a much different uh angle when
[43:32] he starts talking about this this boring
[43:35] of the ear and whatnot and so I want to
[43:37] spend an entire service on this if you
[43:38] can believe it but about why you would
[43:40] turn down the Year of Jubilee what it is
[43:42] that holds us back because the prophet
[43:44] of God didn't preach it as something
[43:45] that was from two or three or four
[43:47] thousand years ago he preached it as it
[43:49] was happening today amen and he's
[43:51] preaching it not to uh Sinners but he's
[43:53] preaching it to professing Christians
[43:55] and so when we start talking about the
[43:56] boring of the ear that is meant for the
[43:58] believer to hear and take heed to and
[44:01] make sure that that's not what's
[44:02] happening in their life because the
[44:03] prophet of God would say that's what's
[44:04] happening in denominations is they put a
[44:06] period behind what God Said and they
[44:08] couldn't go any further and so God put a
[44:10] put a hole through their ear and they
[44:12] can't hear the gospel trumpet anymore
[44:13] but there's so much more that's going on
[44:15] in this and there's one major refusal
[44:17] that we see in scriptures and I want to
[44:19] take that refusal because it's the one
[44:20] way that we can apply this because we
[44:22] don't have a an idea of what it means to
[44:24] be in slavery today you know we have
[44:26] what happened in certainly in the United
[44:28] States in particular back in the 16
[44:30] 1700s and whatnot and how they put
[44:32] people into slavery and and they had an
[44:35] idea of what that looked like but today
[44:36] we don't have an idea of what it means
[44:38] to be a slave we can say well I'm a
[44:40] slave to the job I'm a slave to the man
[44:42] I'm a slave to the government but it
[44:43] it's not slavery like they used to have
[44:45] where you you didn't have a whole lot of
[44:47] clothes and you just had bear shelter
[44:49] and and and just bear sustenance and
[44:51] those things so we don't really know
[44:53] what it means to be in slavery today
[44:54] because even when you fail the
[44:56] government's there to bail you out to
[44:57] make sure that you have enough to to
[44:59] sustain yourself generally speaking amen
[45:01] but I want to talk about what it means
[45:03] to to stay in the Master's house rather
[45:06] than to go out into freedom and go back
[45:08] to your own thing and we talked about
[45:09] that one thing was when the person said
[45:11] I'm satisfied with where I'm at
[45:14] I'm satisfied to be a slave I'm
[45:16] satisfied to just have my food given to
[45:19] me my clothing given to me when it wears
[45:21] out and a roof over my head and that
[45:23] bare sustenance was enough for them and
[45:25] it was more than enough for them to stay
[45:26] with that Master rather than to go out
[45:28] and buy a life of Faith a life of work
[45:30] for themselves have to bear the burden
[45:33] of their own success or failure on their
[45:35] shoulders they said I'd rather be
[45:36] enslaved to somebody that would
[45:38] guarantee that I'll I'll live my days
[45:40] out and I'll be productive rather than
[45:42] go out on my own
[45:44] and I want to stop there because we get
[45:46] into a place sometimes in our lives
[45:47] where we say this isn't so bad
[45:51] and you can get there as a Believer
[45:52] we're not talking about this isn't so
[45:54] bad in in my life and whatnot but we can
[45:56] get to the place where we say I've dealt
[45:58] with things in my life for so long and
[46:00] it's not so bad anymore because if you
[46:03] remember to the first days of slavery no
[46:04] doubt things were difficult somebody
[46:06] that was free that was bound they had a
[46:09] very strong memory of what it was like
[46:10] to be free didn't they the first day as
[46:13] a slave I can't imagine you know in
[46:15] those days you'd you'd go to bed you
[46:17] know free and you'd wake up a slave
[46:19] somebody would come into your your tribe
[46:21] or come into your city or your town or
[46:23] or come into your house and they'd steal
[46:25] you in the night they'd they'd grab you
[46:26] and they bind you and they take you away
[46:28] and sell you and you had no no choice
[46:30] about it and one day you were you were
[46:32] free and the next day you were enslaved
[46:34] and that first day after they were in
[46:36] slavery I'll bet you they remembered a
[46:38] whole lot what it meant to be free and
[46:39] what it meant to have family what it
[46:41] meant to be able to go and do what you
[46:42] wanted and not be hit and not be abused
[46:45] and and all these different things but
[46:46] as time went on for so many no doubt
[46:49] they forgot what it was like to be truly
[46:51] free and they started to accept their
[46:53] condition and forget what it was that
[46:56] they had waiting back home what it was
[46:58] that they used to enjoy in the presence
[47:00] of the Lord if I could put it that way
[47:01] and we can get to the place where we're
[47:03] deadened to what it used to be not
[47:06] because it was so much better back then
[47:08] but because we haven't been where we
[47:10] used to be in so long where we get
[47:12] accepting of what a cold and formal
[47:15] religion because that's what it turns
[47:17] into brother Brown that was the biggest
[47:18] warning I think he had is he said don't
[47:20] go into formalism and then don't let it
[47:23] become just something you do every
[47:24] Sunday or let it become something you do
[47:26] every Wednesday or just because you wake
[47:28] up in the morning have devotions don't
[47:29] let it become formal but it needs to be
[47:31] life amen it needs to have an impact
[47:34] it's supposed to be doing something
[47:35] inside of us and so we can get to the
[47:38] place where we say this coldness is sung
[47:41] even though I'm doing things that are
[47:42] good or maybe even I'm doing things that
[47:44] God has asked me to do yet nothing's
[47:46] happening in my life and I'm okay with
[47:47] it because I meet the requirements that
[47:49] he has for me amen that's not where we
[47:52] want to be amen that's not where we want
[47:53] to be or we get to the place where we
[47:55] have addictions we have habits we have
[47:57] friendships we have influences in our
[47:59] life and they've been there so long that
[48:01] we don't know what it's like to be
[48:03] without them
[48:04] it's kind of like I think the the
[48:06] retirees you know talking to them and
[48:08] when they're done working they almost
[48:09] don't know what to do with themselves
[48:10] when they're done working after all the
[48:12] first few days are woohoo
[48:14] right they sleep in they go to bed as
[48:16] late as they want they wake up as late
[48:18] as they want they do whatever they want
[48:20] they eat whatever they want as long as
[48:21] the wife's not home it's a wonderful
[48:23] time but after a while I'm told
[48:27] you start to wonder what do I do with
[48:28] things and you can get drawn into what a
[48:32] life that is not particularly fulfilling
[48:35] because you don't know what you're
[48:36] supposed to be doing there's no
[48:38] fulfillment in it and you're just living
[48:40] life and this is what we're talking
[48:41] about as you're just living life you're
[48:43] in a condition you're not growing and
[48:46] brother Brown says if you're not growing
[48:47] then you're going backwards right if
[48:49] you're not moving forward then you're
[48:50] backsliding but that backsliding can be
[48:52] so slow I like what brother Aaron said
[48:54] he says sometimes it we're not doing
[48:57] poorly because we're backsliding but
[48:58] because we've lost the fire because
[49:00] we've lost the Zeal and then we've lost
[49:03] the fervency of our relationship with
[49:05] God
[49:06] and so we sit there and we get used to
[49:08] what that formalness we we get used to
[49:11] just doing the same thing over and over
[49:13] again and seeing no results and we can
[49:15] sit there and we can end up literally a
[49:17] slave to the very religion that we
[49:19] profess to be a message from the from
[49:20] God
[49:22] that's what we see so many times talking
[49:24] with young people and old alike they can
[49:26] get to the place where it's just
[49:28] something you do by rote
[49:30] rather than by desire
[49:32] it's almost like when you walk out the
[49:34] door and you give your wife a kiss
[49:36] you do it because she's your wife and
[49:37] that's what you do when you go out the
[49:39] door rather than because you love her
[49:41] right you can get into the place where
[49:43] what you've gotten your relationship
[49:45] cold because there's no passion in it
[49:47] there's nothing inside of it and this is
[49:49] this is something we're going to go into
[49:50] a little bit is that coldness that
[49:52] formality that can come into it but it's
[49:55] also you get to the place where you can
[49:56] say well I used to do it so much worse I
[49:59] used to be addicted I used to have this
[50:01] problem I used to be with these people
[50:03] but now I only do it once a week
[50:05] it used to be every day I used to only
[50:08] be on Facebook I used to be on it every
[50:10] day but now I only go on once a week but
[50:12] that's just negotiated slavery once
[50:14] again it's kind of like people and
[50:15] you'll hear them in the world they say I
[50:17] only drink on weekends but they drink
[50:19] every weekend they're still in slavery
[50:21] it's just that they're not alcoholics
[50:23] every day they're just alcoholics on the
[50:25] weekend but they're still alcoholics and
[50:27] we can get to that point where we say
[50:29] it's not as bad as it used to be but
[50:31] it's still there and we haven't overcome
[50:33] and what we are is we are in prison amen
[50:35] and then we get to the point where we're
[50:37] so used to it that we don't want we
[50:39] don't need we're not looking for a
[50:40] change we're not expecting a change
[50:41] we're happy with the way things are and
[50:44] we say I'm happy to stay in the slavery
[50:46] for as long as it wants to to stay in my
[50:48] life amen we're a slave and we're fine
[50:50] with being it now when I was studying
[50:52] this I looked up this thing called
[50:54] Stockholm syndrome if you've ever heard
[50:55] of it so Stockholm syndrome is a coping
[50:59] mechanism for a captive someone in a
[51:02] captive or abusive situation where
[51:04] people develop positive of feelings
[51:06] towards their captors or abusers over
[51:09] time it applies to situations including
[51:12] child abuse
[51:13] coach and athlete abuse relationship
[51:16] abuse and even sex trafficking and when
[51:18] I put up the definition it says it is a
[51:20] psychological response wherein a captive
[51:23] begins to identify closely with his or
[51:27] her captors as well as their agenda and
[51:31] demands and when I was studying on this
[51:33] they they were talking about uh robbers
[51:36] and terrorists that would take people as
[51:39] hostages but the first thing that jumped
[51:42] out here is this idea of what
[51:43] identifying closely with an agenda
[51:46] because the world is full of agendas
[51:48] today
[51:49] it doesn't matter what you're talking
[51:51] about if you're talking about marriage
[51:52] and relationships there's agendas if
[51:54] you're talking about your kids and how
[51:55] to raise them there's agendas out there
[51:57] if you're talking about politics it is
[51:59] agendas from start to finish employment
[52:02] what a business is supposed to represent
[52:03] everything is full of agendas agendas
[52:06] agendas and if you're feeding on that
[52:08] pretty soon you start to identify with
[52:10] the causes that they have forgetting
[52:13] that it's all of Satan this is Satan's
[52:16] kingdom and they're trying to get a
[52:17] Believer involved to try and fix Satan's
[52:20] kingdom guess what it's his and it's
[52:22] never going to be fixed you can't fix
[52:24] the country you can't fix the family
[52:26] unit you can't fix the world you can't
[52:28] fix Humanity it's lost and when he gets
[52:31] you to identify with an agenda then what
[52:33] is he doing he's getting you off the
[52:34] Kingdom Agenda the real agenda and
[52:37] you're burning all of your energy up and
[52:39] you can become a slave you can start to
[52:41] identify with things because you say
[52:43] it's not fair
[52:45] listen if we wanted to focus on not fair
[52:47] look at our sisters
[52:49] men can go and remarry ad nauseum if
[52:51] they want not really according to
[52:53] scripture but that's the way it's worked
[52:54] out because a man is allowed to remarry
[52:56] after divorce and the sister has to sit
[52:58] there and she has can't remarry until
[52:59] that man dies that first husband dies
[53:01] how fair is that it's not fair
[53:04] but it's right
[53:06] and since people will get us caught up
[53:07] in the fairness of it and is that really
[53:09] the way it should be and if you stop and
[53:11] think about it and all of a sudden it's
[53:12] just like Eve they've got you
[53:14] identifying with their agenda rather
[53:16] than running it through the filter of
[53:18] the word of God and so you end up being
[53:20] caught between two opinions and we'll
[53:21] touch on that a little bit amen the idea
[53:23] is not to get caught up the idea is to
[53:25] get into Christ and as we said get into
[53:27] that strong tower to be so buried in
[53:30] there that they've got to come through
[53:31] the word to get you and they can never
[53:33] get through because their agenda won't
[53:34] fit through it amen but I was looking at
[53:37] this and they said that these these
[53:40] people these terrorists are or these
[53:42] children that are taken and and whatnot
[53:45] that they get to the point where what
[53:46] happens is their life or their safety is
[53:48] threatened by the person that takes them
[53:51] and then the person lets them keep their
[53:53] life in their safety and it triggers a
[53:56] response that makes them think that
[53:58] their Master their captor that terrorist
[54:01] whoever might be is their friend because
[54:04] they threatened to take their life and
[54:06] then they gave it back to them
[54:08] and so they start to think this person
[54:10] actually cares about me and they start
[54:12] to think that there's actually a
[54:13] beneficial relationship that that person
[54:15] is going to do everything they said they
[54:17] were going to do and that their promises
[54:19] will not be turned away in the end
[54:21] and they get caught up in this and they
[54:23] actually have a an example in Sweden
[54:25] where the woman said I trust this Bank
[54:28] robber's motives and objectives and I'm
[54:31] scared that if the police come in
[54:32] they'll kill me
[54:34] she didn't want to rescue she didn't
[54:36] want them to try anything she believed
[54:38] that a man that was that that was
[54:40] putting her life and her body and using
[54:42] it as a shield for himself had her in
[54:45] mind her goodness and her life and mind
[54:47] over his own rather than the police
[54:49] whose duty is to protect and serve
[54:51] that's how twisted she got up in just a
[54:54] few short hours
[54:55] she got bound up by this now take
[54:58] somebody that's around somebody like
[54:59] they have this the these child
[55:01] trafficking and whatnot where they're
[55:02] around them for years and all of a
[55:05] sudden they start to rely on that person
[55:06] and they start to look at that person to
[55:09] provide their needs to give them
[55:10] validation they get them hooked on drugs
[55:12] all these different things they're
[55:13] looking at that person and they get into
[55:15] a delusion that that person has their
[55:17] motor their best motives and objectives
[55:19] in their heart and they don't they're in
[55:21] it for themselves that's what we see
[55:23] with agendas and these different things
[55:24] is there's people that are in it for
[55:26] what themselves
[55:27] everything you look I remember when the
[55:30] the black lives movement came out in and
[55:32] and everything was sweeping towards and
[55:34] everybody joined in and then all of a
[55:35] sudden everything went blank because the
[55:38] founders had taken the money and run
[55:39] with it
[55:41] right they had a moral cause potentially
[55:44] but all they did was they got all of
[55:46] this influence and they took it they
[55:48] turned it into money and then they went
[55:49] and ran and bought houses and now nobody
[55:51] knows what's going on they've got no
[55:52] money left in the foundation they've
[55:53] just got a shadow board to try and keep
[55:55] things running
[55:56] right because why it wasn't pulled
[55:58] through the word of God and so it was a
[56:00] man it was of women in this case and
[56:02] they went through and they absolutely
[56:03] destroyed that foundation and everything
[56:04] that they were working through
[56:07] we start to forget that what they took
[56:11] us from our freedom in the first place
[56:13] but we still think that it's okay to
[56:15] stay there that it's going to be okay
[56:17] that we don't need anything to change in
[56:19] our life and in the end they fear and
[56:21] resent anybody that would try and take
[56:24] them out of that condition
[56:25] that's an amazing place you think that a
[56:27] child abuse sexually abused by a man
[56:29] that stole her away and brought her over
[56:31] the Border would somehow not do anything
[56:33] but hate that man and yet they get to
[56:35] the point where they don't want to leave
[56:36] that man they don't want to be freed
[56:37] they want to stay with them that's their
[56:39] daddy and they trust him even though
[56:41] he's abusing them and giving them away
[56:42] to other men every single day of their
[56:44] life
[56:45] they comply with their captor rather
[56:48] than even help the police in those
[56:49] situations it's amazing you say brother
[56:51] that's insane amen you say that's insane
[56:54] but yet what happens when what we touch
[56:56] one another sore spots places where
[56:59] we're not doing so well places where we
[57:01] need Deliverance places where we need to
[57:02] grow
[57:03] places where we need to come up a little
[57:06] higher
[57:07] and what do we do we pull back
[57:09] and we say why'd you do that
[57:12] I'm okay I don't have a problem
[57:16] I don't need to go up for prayer the
[57:18] minister touches on the pulpit from
[57:20] behind the pulpit and all of a sudden we
[57:21] say well he's out to get me now
[57:24] and what's he doing he's blowing a
[57:25] trumpet he's blowing a trumpet if he's a
[57:28] Holy Ghost Field Ministry he's blowing a
[57:29] trumpet and saying you got to come out
[57:30] of that you got to come up higher you
[57:33] got to realize that there's more Beyond
[57:36] this that there is a Deliverance I said
[57:37] it before and I like my own statement it
[57:40] was that we're covering up too many
[57:42] things with forgiveness instead of
[57:44] Deliverance amen that we're in a cycle
[57:46] and we're going around and around the
[57:48] mountain we're going around and around
[57:49] the desert and we're coming close to the
[57:51] promise of God and then we turn away at
[57:53] the last minute close to the presence of
[57:54] God and turn away why because we like
[57:57] right where we're at and we don't think
[57:58] it's a problem we don't think we're
[58:00] Bound by something amen
[58:05] you don't even think you're in bonded
[58:07] you don't think you're in change you
[58:08] don't think you've got a problem because
[58:09] it's been there so long that you don't
[58:11] know what it's like to be without it
[58:16] then you think about it
[58:17] somebody tells you there's more
[58:19] there's a land beyond the Jordan that's
[58:22] what Caleb and Joshua are saying there's
[58:24] more
[58:24] there's grapes the size grape clusters
[58:27] that are so big it takes two men to
[58:28] carry them there's there's land there's
[58:30] water there's cattle there's pastures
[58:33] there's houses already built and you're
[58:35] sitting here saying but I'm happy in the
[58:37] desert I'm just going to go around and
[58:39] around the desert and that's what they
[58:40] did you know they came close to Jordan
[58:42] time and time again but they never
[58:43] crossed over they never crossed over
[58:45] close pulled away close pulled away
[58:49] brother the scripture talks about this
[58:51] in Revelation 3 17 this is the latest in
[58:53] church age okay we're preaching to this
[58:55] church age tonight
[58:57] it says because thou sayest I am rich
[59:00] and increased with goods and have need
[59:02] of nothing and know us not that thou art
[59:05] wretched and miserable and poor and
[59:07] blind and naked listen church it's not
[59:09] Sinners reading this Bible is it
[59:12] because he says what he says to what the
[59:15] Church of laodicea
[59:18] he says preach it to the Believers John
[59:20] preach it seventh Church age Messenger
[59:23] to the people let them know that this is
[59:25] the condition they're going to be in in
[59:27] this age unless they hear the trumpet
[59:29] he's preaching to professing Believers
[59:31] he's preaching to professing message
[59:33] Christians if I could put it that way
[59:35] and he's saying you think that you have
[59:37] so much
[59:39] and what is he saying don't get
[59:41] comfortable because that first bid Rich
[59:44] increased with Goods have need of
[59:45] nothing that's a comfortable place and
[59:47] it's not just natural wealth it's
[59:48] spiritual wealth they think they have
[59:50] amen
[59:51] what's he saying stay on fire for God
[59:53] don't stop moving
[59:56] it doesn't all have to be a anybody
[59:58] that's been married for more than than a
[1:00:00] couple of years will know that it's not
[1:00:02] all fire and passion every day is it
[1:00:05] maybe it's just mine
[1:00:08] every day is in fire and passion it is
[1:00:10] early on but then you settle down and
[1:00:13] you get into loving instead of just
[1:00:14] being in love and there's more that
[1:00:17] comes into it and and this is what it's
[1:00:19] talking about is don't stay there where
[1:00:21] you are stay and move on with your
[1:00:23] relationship with God keep moving
[1:00:25] because these talks and the next thing
[1:00:26] about I counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:00:28] tried in the fire that's the character
[1:00:30] of God and characters developed over
[1:00:32] time brother Brown says character is
[1:00:34] what a victory
[1:00:36] right it's a character of Victory it's
[1:00:38] something that you overcome in yourself
[1:00:41] it's not you that overcomes it's Christ
[1:00:43] that overcomes in you it's the holy
[1:00:44] spirit that does that amen
[1:00:46] but you've got to keep your walk going
[1:00:48] towards God
[1:00:50] keep your walk with God don't just stand
[1:00:53] still like I said brother Brown says
[1:00:55] when you stand still you're backsliding
[1:00:58] you've always got to be pushing forward
[1:01:00] amen and brother Bram says these are
[1:01:01] souls in prison
[1:01:03] because they think they're where they
[1:01:05] need to be and they're nowhere near it
[1:01:07] and they are spiritually bereft they're
[1:01:10] completely missing the boat when it
[1:01:12] comes to what God's doing in their life
[1:01:14] and what he's supposed to be doing amen
[1:01:16] these people don't think they're just
[1:01:17] middle-class Christians they think
[1:01:18] they're the best of the best and yet
[1:01:20] there's nothing there he said you have
[1:01:22] nothing your poor wretched miserable
[1:01:25] blind and naked that's an amazing
[1:01:27] condition to be in and not know it
[1:01:29] you've got to be in real trouble
[1:01:31] you got to be like that slave that wants
[1:01:33] to stay there to be in that kind of a
[1:01:35] condition amen you have nothing
[1:01:38] and you think you have all that you need
[1:01:39] and because of that you're never looking
[1:01:40] for anything else
[1:01:42] I was thinking about today brother Mark
[1:01:43] you know when you you read that
[1:01:46] um advertisement in the paper and it
[1:01:47] said something along the lines of if
[1:01:48] you're happy where you are stay there
[1:01:50] but if you're looking for something more
[1:01:52] that's what struck me even as we're
[1:01:54] moving forward into a larger Church
[1:01:56] where we could have more people I almost
[1:01:58] thought that maybe we should put that
[1:01:59] out again if you're happy where you're
[1:02:01] at stay there but if you're looking for
[1:02:03] something more come to 50 Long Shore
[1:02:05] Road
[1:02:06] amen because I'm looking for more I I
[1:02:09] have an end time message and I'm looking
[1:02:11] for more not more from it but more in me
[1:02:13] amen that God would lift me up to a
[1:02:15] higher level not just as a minister but
[1:02:18] as a father as a husband as a a member
[1:02:20] of the church as a member of the
[1:02:22] community in my job that he would Raise
[1:02:24] Me Up that I'd not be satisfied with
[1:02:26] where I'm at
[1:02:28] be satisfied with where I'm at in that
[1:02:29] where he's placed me but always to be
[1:02:32] looking to grow in Christ amen
[1:02:34] amen we've forgotten what it's like to
[1:02:36] not have a temper
[1:02:37] to not have a complex to not be cynical
[1:02:40] to not be frustrated all the time to not
[1:02:43] be depressed I remember back in 2006
[1:02:45] just before we bought our first house in
[1:02:47] Texas and we got in a a bad wreck and it
[1:02:51] it hurt me really badly it it did a
[1:02:53] number on one of my on one of my um
[1:02:56] discs in my back and it caused me to
[1:02:59] have
[1:03:00] um I couldn't sleep at night insomnia
[1:03:02] and so I couldn't sleep at all and I'd
[1:03:05] get maybe one or two hours a night and
[1:03:06] I'd just lay there and toss and turn and
[1:03:08] just completely frustrated and I got to
[1:03:12] the point that I was depressed
[1:03:14] but you know I didn't know I was
[1:03:16] depressed because it had been so long
[1:03:19] since I had slept it had been so long
[1:03:22] since I had rest it had been so long
[1:03:24] since I hadn't been frustrated that I
[1:03:26] thought that being frustrated tired worn
[1:03:28] out was the way that I had always felt
[1:03:31] that's a personal testimony of of the
[1:03:34] dark road we can get down and not
[1:03:35] realize Where We Are
[1:03:38] but as soon as I got a diagnosis as soon
[1:03:40] as I knew what was wrong as soon as I
[1:03:42] knew that it was going to be okay then
[1:03:44] all of a sudden I could sleep
[1:03:45] and all of a sudden I popped out of it
[1:03:47] and my wife she was trying to tell me
[1:03:49] you're depressed and I'd say no I'm not
[1:03:51] no I'm not I'm fine I'm just tired
[1:03:55] and that's sometimes what we're doing is
[1:03:57] we're denying it because we can't see it
[1:03:58] for ourselves sometimes we need a spell
[1:04:00] sometimes we need a minister to come on
[1:04:02] and say you're not normal
[1:04:04] there's something lacking here you've
[1:04:06] forgotten what it's like to be free
[1:04:08] you've forgotten the first love that you
[1:04:10] had you've forgotten the joy that you
[1:04:12] used to have you've you've lost the rest
[1:04:14] that you used to enjoy so much and
[1:04:16] you're frustrated all the time I deal
[1:04:19] with frustration a lot I'm I'm a
[1:04:21] performance driven person so I'm usually
[1:04:22] more frustrated at myself than anything
[1:04:24] that's one thing I've really got to
[1:04:26] watch is that if I'm constantly
[1:04:27] frustrated it means I've lost the joy of
[1:04:29] my salvation it means I'm looking too
[1:04:31] much of myself and not looking enough to
[1:04:33] the cross of Calvary amen
[1:04:36] I remember I pre-shot service on knowing
[1:04:38] where to satisfy your thirst you
[1:04:40] remember where David he's in the middle
[1:04:42] of the desert and he's been running so
[1:04:44] long and it's hot and it's dusty and
[1:04:46] he's sweaty and he said oh for water
[1:04:49] from The Well of Bethlehem
[1:04:51] why because he remembered what it was
[1:04:53] like to be satisfied he remembered what
[1:04:56] it was like to have his thirst quenched
[1:04:57] he remembered the taste of it not
[1:04:59] because he'd heard about it but because
[1:05:01] he'd experienced it
[1:05:03] and the danger we get is we've forgotten
[1:05:06] what it tastes to be free in the Holy
[1:05:07] Spirit to be free in the presence of God
[1:05:10] to know what it means to walk through a
[1:05:12] day and not be bound up in yourself in
[1:05:14] your complexes and your family
[1:05:16] situations and all of these different
[1:05:18] things amen
[1:05:19] if you've ever been satisfied with the
[1:05:21] good things of God keep that in your
[1:05:24] mind
[1:05:24] because when you start to miss it you
[1:05:26] can say I remember what it used to be
[1:05:28] and like David said restore to me the
[1:05:30] joy of my salvation didn't mean he lost
[1:05:33] his salvation but restore to me the joy
[1:05:35] give me back what I had Lord
[1:05:38] listen God doesn't move away from us
[1:05:40] God never moves away from us we move
[1:05:42] away from him
[1:05:44] and all these all you need to do is say
[1:05:46] Lord I'm coming back
[1:05:48] and what is it he's blowing the trumpet
[1:05:50] constantly saying come back come back to
[1:05:53] where I am come back to your inheritance
[1:05:54] come back to the promises of God come
[1:05:57] back to the presence of God and enjoy
[1:05:59] the benefits that you're supposed to
[1:06:00] have as a child as a son and daughter of
[1:06:02] God
[1:06:03] what happens why do we refuse a jubilee
[1:06:06] because we've forgotten who we are and
[1:06:08] what we're supposed to be living like
[1:06:11] we've forgotten the goodness of God
[1:06:12] we've forgotten the blessings of God the
[1:06:14] promises of God
[1:06:16] brother Brown talks about it in
[1:06:18] spiritual Amnesia he says another thing
[1:06:20] that causes this among the people is
[1:06:22] getting between two opinions
[1:06:26] you get caught between two worlds maybe
[1:06:27] I could put it that way
[1:06:29] where you're at and where you used to be
[1:06:32] he says that'll cause Amnesia and it
[1:06:34] gets you to a place where you actually
[1:06:35] what you've done you've lost your reason
[1:06:37] you've lost your mind you don't know who
[1:06:39] you are you can't identify yourself you
[1:06:42] can walk around and eat and everything
[1:06:44] but you still can't identify yourself
[1:06:47] what is it well how do you get caught
[1:06:48] between two opinions feed on two sources
[1:06:52] right if you're feeding on the things of
[1:06:54] the world on the agendas of the world if
[1:06:56] you're feeding on things that are from
[1:06:58] people that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:59] you're going to get pulled in a
[1:07:01] direction opposite to what the word of
[1:07:03] God says every single time even if they
[1:07:05] profess to be a Christian
[1:07:07] amen you get there of times by seeking
[1:07:10] balance and you end up imbalanced
[1:07:14] we're not looking for a balance between
[1:07:16] what the word says and what the world
[1:07:17] says there is no balance there
[1:07:21] amen right
[1:07:22] your balance is here Old Testament and
[1:07:25] New Testament
[1:07:26] that's where your balance is it is not
[1:07:29] in commentaries by political people or
[1:07:31] by religious people
[1:07:33] it's not on YouTube it's not on Tick
[1:07:35] Tock it's not on Facebook it's not on
[1:07:37] Instagram that is never going to balance
[1:07:39] us
[1:07:40] but it's going to draw you into two
[1:07:42] opinions
[1:07:43] and you're never going to come out of it
[1:07:45] looking the better for it
[1:07:46] brother badham would also say and it's
[1:07:48] not here it was in a previous quote he
[1:07:49] said sometimes a shock will do it
[1:07:52] sometimes a shock will do and what
[1:07:53] happens somebody you really love dies
[1:07:56] or leaves the message
[1:07:58] or you have a financial setback in your
[1:08:00] family somebody's Health goes down the
[1:08:02] drain
[1:08:03] a relationship fails
[1:08:06] and you're seeking for understanding and
[1:08:09] so you start to go away from the word
[1:08:10] and start to talk to people that know
[1:08:12] nothing about the things of God
[1:08:14] and what happens is it pulls you down a
[1:08:16] rabbit Trail to which there's no end
[1:08:18] it's just one thing after another after
[1:08:20] another and pretty soon you're you're
[1:08:22] stuck between two opinions you don't
[1:08:23] know what's right what's wrong who's
[1:08:24] right who's wrong where to go where to
[1:08:26] stay
[1:08:27] and you're stuck in brother Brown calls
[1:08:29] it spiritual Amnesia it's no man's land
[1:08:31] you're seeking a worldly answer to a god
[1:08:33] question
[1:08:36] right
[1:08:37] amen listen you want a God answer
[1:08:39] go to God it's the only place you're
[1:08:41] going to get it go to the word of God
[1:08:44] he says now there's a place when you get
[1:08:46] this Amnesia you might get like
[1:08:47] Nebuchadnezzar who exalted himself one
[1:08:51] time remember the scripture says what
[1:08:53] pry goldth Before Destruction in a
[1:08:55] haughty spirit before a fall It also
[1:08:58] says humility goeth before honor so you
[1:09:01] can invert this you can invert this if
[1:09:03] you're in a place where you don't know
[1:09:04] who you are humble yourself and God will
[1:09:06] take you to what you're supposed to be
[1:09:08] he says and God let him think he was an
[1:09:11] animal he lived out in the wilderness
[1:09:12] and he grasped like an ox and his hairs
[1:09:14] grow down his body like eagle feathers
[1:09:16] and he had become the heart of a beast
[1:09:18] in him see that was Amnesia because he
[1:09:20] had forgotten he was a king he forgotten
[1:09:22] he was a human being he thought he was
[1:09:24] an animal so he acted like an animal
[1:09:26] because he forgot he was a human being
[1:09:28] he says that's so easy today
[1:09:33] we forget sometimes what the Christian
[1:09:35] church is we act like the world that
[1:09:39] shows that we've got spiritual Amnesia
[1:09:41] because you don't act like a Christian
[1:09:42] you act like the world you receive the
[1:09:45] heart of the world and it causes this
[1:09:47] that's why I was focusing earlier on
[1:09:50] agendas
[1:09:52] is because that's what's going to give
[1:09:53] the heart of the world to you you start
[1:09:55] to align you start to to understand
[1:09:57] where they're coming from and it draws
[1:10:00] you into a place where you're not sure
[1:10:01] what you believe anymore
[1:10:02] he says when the world and the church
[1:10:04] joins itself together then they don't
[1:10:07] want nothing spiritual they don't want
[1:10:09] thus said the Lord they want what they
[1:10:13] want they want the world and to say
[1:10:15] they're a Christian live in the world
[1:10:17] and live with the world and live like
[1:10:19] the world and still maintain their
[1:10:21] confession of being a Christian
[1:10:23] he says you know the thing of it is it's
[1:10:25] spiritual Amnesia it's exactly what it
[1:10:27] is they don't know who they are they've
[1:10:29] forgotten what they're supposed to do if
[1:10:31] one would come today like that it would
[1:10:33] be rejected just the same they had a bad
[1:10:35] case of it and so have they today
[1:10:39] he says they could not identify
[1:10:41] themselves with the supernatural things
[1:10:42] anymore because they didn't want it the
[1:10:46] word the gospel they didn't want it see
[1:10:48] what happens there he says they don't
[1:10:49] want the supernatural but how do they
[1:10:51] get to not wanting the supernatural they
[1:10:52] didn't want the word
[1:10:54] because the supernatural follows the
[1:10:56] word it does not lead the word it
[1:10:57] follows the word right the assigns shall
[1:10:59] follow them that believe right the word
[1:11:01] comes first he says they turn down the
[1:11:03] word and then they turn down the
[1:11:04] supernatural because they can't see why
[1:11:06] they need it
[1:11:07] he says sin disease had Afflicted them
[1:11:09] and they loved that sin is Pleasant to
[1:11:12] the unconverted heart
[1:11:14] it looks good to the unconverted mind
[1:11:16] but it's the way of death there's
[1:11:18] nothing left but death the wages of sin
[1:11:20] is death and you must reap them wages
[1:11:22] you've sowed to the winds and you're now
[1:11:24] reaping the Whirlwind the spiritual
[1:11:26] signs and the preaching of an ordained
[1:11:28] messenger from God never stirred them
[1:11:30] anymore the woman could the women could
[1:11:33] laugh right in their face and say I
[1:11:35] don't have to go hear such a stuff as
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:38] if that hasn't repeated again what is it
[1:11:40] spiritual Amnesia exactly what it is
[1:11:43] they have forgotten that God and His
[1:11:45] word is the same and he cannot change it
[1:11:48] he says you know the old saying fools
[1:11:51] will walk with hobnailed shoes Where
[1:11:53] Angels Fear to trod that's what this
[1:11:56] spiritual Amnesia does now listen to
[1:11:57] this it says it makes people get to a
[1:12:00] spot to well they have no feeling on the
[1:12:03] inside of them
[1:12:04] they don't want nothing that's spiritual
[1:12:06] but the church today has got a bad case
[1:12:09] of spiritual Amnesia it doesn't know
[1:12:11] where it belongs it's for God all about
[1:12:13] it forgot all these things that makes it
[1:12:15] a church and the Bible prophesied Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ sent his Angel to John and said
[1:12:20] this last Church age would have the
[1:12:22] spiritual Amnesia they were wretched
[1:12:24] remember they think they're big they
[1:12:27] think they've got something but he said
[1:12:29] they were miserable wretched poor blind
[1:12:31] naked and didn't know it and there is no
[1:12:34] way of telling them
[1:12:37] they think just because I belong to a
[1:12:40] church that's all is necessary
[1:12:43] oh brother that means no more to God
[1:12:46] than to be a mason or anything else or
[1:12:49] any other Lodge if you know the Masonic
[1:12:50] Lodge it ain't religious and he says you
[1:12:52] say all I need to do is belong to a
[1:12:54] church it's no different than saying I
[1:12:55] need to belong to the Masonic Lodge has
[1:12:57] nothing to do with God
[1:12:59] to belong to church that don't mean
[1:13:01] nothing to God you've got to be Sons and
[1:13:03] Daughters of God you've got to be born
[1:13:06] of God and God is the word and when I
[1:13:08] become part of my father I become all my
[1:13:11] father
[1:13:12] when you become part of God you become
[1:13:14] God in full his whole word you believe
[1:13:17] all of it
[1:13:20] amen now it doesn't sound very nice
[1:13:23] spiritual amnesia
[1:13:25] doesn't sound like a very good thing to
[1:13:26] be in but the beautiful thing is they
[1:13:28] didn't determine the condition of the
[1:13:30] people before they blew the trumpet did
[1:13:32] they
[1:13:33] the trumpet always blew no matter what
[1:13:34] that's right and guess what the gospel
[1:13:36] trumpet blows regardless of our
[1:13:38] condition amen sometimes we were blind
[1:13:41] we were wretched miserable poor blind
[1:13:43] naked all of those things and the
[1:13:44] trumpet's still blue and one day we
[1:13:46] heard it and we heard it for what it was
[1:13:48] it wasn't just the sound
[1:13:51] wasn't just something off in the
[1:13:53] distance but it was something that meant
[1:13:55] something to us and we said that means
[1:13:58] something and we took it and the word
[1:14:01] says you can go free and what did we do
[1:14:03] we said I'll take that I'll go free
[1:14:06] but guess what it's continuing to sound
[1:14:08] every day we're what we're Washed by the
[1:14:11] what the water of the word it's a
[1:14:13] regular thing that trumpet is constantly
[1:14:15] blowing to keep us free and if we're
[1:14:18] bound to get us free
[1:14:19] hey man did you know you can have the
[1:14:21] Holy Ghost and still be bound
[1:14:23] absolutely temporarily you let something
[1:14:26] in it combines you as long as you leave
[1:14:28] it in there
[1:14:29] you open the door it can come in you
[1:14:31] deny it it can't come in but if you open
[1:14:33] the door it has a right to bind you
[1:14:35] but when you hear that gospel Trump and
[1:14:37] you realize I'm not supposed to have
[1:14:39] this in my life I'm supposed to be
[1:14:41] living in a higher plane than what that
[1:14:43] thing has to go because you apply the
[1:14:45] word to it you release the Holy Spirit
[1:14:46] to it and now it's got to go but you can
[1:14:48] absolutely be stuck there amen
[1:14:51] what do you do if you got this condition
[1:14:52] what do you do if you know somebody has
[1:14:54] this condition get them to where the
[1:14:56] trumpet's blowing that's what you got to
[1:14:58] do is get to where the trumpet's blowing
[1:14:59] and brother Brown says every time the
[1:15:01] trumpet is the gospel the trumpet is the
[1:15:04] preaching of the word get them to church
[1:15:06] get to church
[1:15:08] not get them to church let's get us to
[1:15:10] church
[1:15:11] let's get to the hearing of the word
[1:15:13] everyone's here I'm preaching to the
[1:15:15] choir I know tonight
[1:15:17] but get to where the word is
[1:15:20] and guess what don't wait for brother
[1:15:21] Gerald to get up don't wait for me to
[1:15:24] get up you gotta you got 1200 odd
[1:15:26] messages sitting at home that's the
[1:15:28] gospel trumpet for this age telling you
[1:15:31] how you can go free and what your land
[1:15:33] looks like and what's waiting for you if
[1:15:34] you'll just leave the master that you're
[1:15:36] serving today if you're serving a master
[1:15:38] that's other than Christ amen
[1:15:42] talk to God before you talk to anyone
[1:15:44] else talk to God
[1:15:46] amen look to him like I said you got a
[1:15:47] god question get a God answer go to him
[1:15:50] and go through his word amen stop
[1:15:52] listening to commentaries and podcasts
[1:15:54] from people that don't have the Holy
[1:15:56] Ghost
[1:15:57] listen if they don't have it there's
[1:15:59] going to be something in there that'll
[1:16:00] trip you up
[1:16:02] why because they don't have the full
[1:16:04] word and we're going to get to a quote
[1:16:05] where brother Brown talks about he says
[1:16:06] now that you've got the full word you
[1:16:08] can go free
[1:16:10] because it'll only take you so far you
[1:16:12] listen to a denominational Minister you
[1:16:14] listen to some nominal Christian trying
[1:16:15] to tell you the good things of God
[1:16:17] they'll only take you so far and they'll
[1:16:19] leave you with more questions and
[1:16:20] answers in the end you need somebody
[1:16:22] that's got the full Revelation something
[1:16:23] that's preaching from an open book an
[1:16:26] open book that's been revealed by a
[1:16:27] seventh angel messenger amen by the Holy
[1:16:30] Spirit working through them amen
[1:16:32] sorry that's why the scripture says I
[1:16:34] threw it up here in Hebrews 10 25 it
[1:16:36] says what not forsaking the assembling
[1:16:38] of ourselves together as the manner of
[1:16:40] some is but exhorting one another and so
[1:16:43] much the more as you see the day
[1:16:44] approaching what day the end time the
[1:16:47] day of our Salvation the day of
[1:16:49] tribulation for everyone else but the
[1:16:50] day of our Salvation this is a great
[1:16:53] test for what your spirit is under these
[1:16:55] days are you seeking to be in the house
[1:16:57] of God and in the fellowship with the
[1:16:59] Saints or are you avoiding it
[1:17:01] again I'm preaching to the choir here
[1:17:02] tonight but there's many listening to
[1:17:04] this and there's many we'll listen to it
[1:17:07] that are what they're avoiding this for
[1:17:09] they're joining together with the church
[1:17:11] because they're bound up by something
[1:17:13] that won't allow them to Fellowship
[1:17:14] anymore
[1:17:15] what is it it's not the Holy Spirit
[1:17:18] because this is what the holy spirit
[1:17:20] says will happen to those that are
[1:17:21] outside of the Holy Spirit they'll
[1:17:23] forsake the assembling of themselves
[1:17:25] together humble yourself get back to
[1:17:27] church again I'm not preaching to the
[1:17:29] people here but there are people
[1:17:30] listening that need to hear that amen
[1:17:33] why because if you get there you can
[1:17:35] hear what God says about you you can see
[1:17:37] what he says you're supposed to see you
[1:17:39] can look for what he says he has waiting
[1:17:41] for you but if you send it home you're
[1:17:42] just going to feed yourself whatever
[1:17:43] will satisfy you to stay with where
[1:17:46] you're at you've got to get under the
[1:17:47] preaching of the word with an anointed
[1:17:48] Ministry and guess what the ministry did
[1:17:51] not stop with William Branham you can't
[1:17:53] just sit at home and listen to tapes
[1:17:55] right because the holy spirit is still
[1:17:57] moving in real time to speak to people
[1:17:59] today you need a live Minister today
[1:18:03] to move on in your walk with Christ amen
[1:18:05] you can't sit home and do it it's never
[1:18:07] been ordained the prophet never said to
[1:18:08] do it amen
[1:18:10] listen we all need this
[1:18:12] we all need deliverance from areas in
[1:18:14] our life I was talking to a minister the
[1:18:15] other day he said brother John I feel
[1:18:17] like I'm the lowest of the lowest of my
[1:18:18] church as a Believer he says I'm always
[1:18:20] struggling I'm always fighting with
[1:18:22] things I said join the crowd
[1:18:24] praise the Lord it means you're at least
[1:18:26] in a battle at least you're struggling
[1:18:28] at least you're fighting rather than
[1:18:29] giving into it but as a minister I'd say
[1:18:32] that puts me at the top of the Heap for
[1:18:34] needing these things
[1:18:36] because why if I get tripped up then it
[1:18:38] bleeds into an entire congregation
[1:18:40] right as a mother as a father as a
[1:18:43] husband as a wife you've got to stay
[1:18:45] clean you've got to stay tight to the
[1:18:47] word of God to the presence of God to be
[1:18:49] delivered from these things otherwise it
[1:18:50] goes down into your your your family and
[1:18:53] kids I remember I was talking to a
[1:18:55] pastor who was dealing with a family
[1:18:56] situation and and the the daughter had
[1:18:59] gotten into some issues
[1:19:02] and he went in and the Holy Spirit said
[1:19:04] talk to the father first
[1:19:06] and he went and talked to that man and
[1:19:08] he says are you having issues with lust
[1:19:10] and pornography and these things and the
[1:19:12] brother broke down he said yes I am he
[1:19:14] said if you fix that your daughter will
[1:19:16] be okay why because he was the conduit
[1:19:19] for that Spirit coming into that family
[1:19:21] he didn't hold himself clean he didn't
[1:19:24] get deliverance from that and that
[1:19:25] allowed a channel right into his home so
[1:19:27] that his daughter could be affected by
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:30] that's how serious it is
[1:19:32] if you don't admit you've got an issue
[1:19:34] if you don't admit that you're not where
[1:19:36] you need to be that you've Fallen away
[1:19:38] from where you used to be then it's a
[1:19:40] channel for Satan to dance all over your
[1:19:42] life all day long
[1:19:43] what is it pride Rises up or fear that
[1:19:46] someone's going to find out my husband's
[1:19:49] gonna find out my wife's gonna find out
[1:19:50] my mom my dad my pastor the church
[1:19:53] listen the fruits are going to come out
[1:19:55] eventually anyways
[1:19:57] listen I love what brother John said he
[1:19:59] said what if the son comes to the father
[1:20:01] there's mercy and a sincere confession
[1:20:03] but when you get caught there's never
[1:20:05] Mercy it's just judgment because you
[1:20:08] didn't come and say I need to make it
[1:20:09] right
[1:20:10] you got caught
[1:20:12] I love that as parents hopefully we've
[1:20:15] got grace and mercy for the for the
[1:20:17] Willing confession of our children for
[1:20:18] our spouses even
[1:20:20] but that's the way you want to call me
[1:20:22] man
[1:20:23] brother Bob says no that's the type of
[1:20:25] the Gospel trumpet you might have served
[1:20:27] the devil all three's years in Chains
[1:20:29] with drinking smoking gambling and send
[1:20:31] dirty things now we don't really
[1:20:33] identify with that
[1:20:35] I never smoked in my life I drank once
[1:20:39] by mistake
[1:20:41] maybe they put something in that I
[1:20:43] didn't realize they were putting in
[1:20:45] one other time willingly actually now
[1:20:46] that I think about it
[1:20:49] drinking is not a
[1:20:51] lot of smoking is not a problem for
[1:20:52] people in the message
[1:20:54] but he says no matter what you've done
[1:20:58] when you hear the gospel trumpet sound
[1:21:00] it's a sign that you can go free you can
[1:21:03] go Faith cometh by hearing of the word
[1:21:06] of God that's why you've got to be under
[1:21:07] the hearing of the word of God it'll
[1:21:08] give you Faith to claim what the trumpet
[1:21:10] says you can have he says now that
[1:21:13] you've heard the Full Gospel you don't
[1:21:15] have to stay bound any longer
[1:21:18] I was reading in the in the gospels this
[1:21:21] this week and Jesus was talking and he's
[1:21:24] talking to the to the people that were
[1:21:26] very righteous
[1:21:27] he was talking to the laodiceans if I
[1:21:29] could put it that way
[1:21:31] and when Jesus heard that he said unto
[1:21:33] them they that behold need not a
[1:21:35] physician but they that are sick
[1:21:38] doctors are for sick people not well
[1:21:40] people
[1:21:41] he says but go ye and learn what that
[1:21:44] meaneth
[1:21:45] I will have mercy and not sacrifice for
[1:21:49] I am not come to call the righteous but
[1:21:51] the Sinners to repentance remember I've
[1:21:54] said many times that in the church age
[1:21:56] book it says that the Zeal of the Legacy
[1:21:58] in ages to repent
[1:22:00] to be able to humble yourself to the
[1:22:02] word of God and say I'm not where the
[1:22:04] word says I should be
[1:22:05] because what the laodicea and says I
[1:22:08] don't need anything
[1:22:10] what does the True Believer say
[1:22:12] what I have is worthless I want what
[1:22:14] Christ has for me
[1:22:16] the latest the season later see him what
[1:22:18] says they have more than enough what
[1:22:20] matters to them
[1:22:22] and what does the believer say I want
[1:22:24] what matters to him
[1:22:26] because you've got to wear a garment
[1:22:28] that he likes not of your own liking
[1:22:30] amen we read in Romans and the other
[1:22:32] service where Paul said we are servants
[1:22:34] to the one that we obey
[1:22:36] and he was pointing he said there's
[1:22:37] people going down two completely
[1:22:39] different paths and they don't really
[1:22:41] realize it
[1:22:42] because he'd say what you are him you
[1:22:45] are servants to him that you obey
[1:22:48] and people will say well I'm in
[1:22:49] obedience and think that that means that
[1:22:52] they're a Believer but the question is
[1:22:54] what are you obeying
[1:22:56] because just because you're sincere
[1:22:58] doesn't mean that you're always obeying
[1:23:00] God
[1:23:01] but people will say well I'm being
[1:23:02] obedient but are you truly obedient to
[1:23:04] what the word says are you truly
[1:23:06] obedient to being called out of what
[1:23:08] we're called out of or are you just
[1:23:09] going along in a way of your own
[1:23:11] choosing
[1:23:12] remember we're talking about a religious
[1:23:14] spirit here this is the thing that we're
[1:23:16] fighting in laodicea is a religious
[1:23:18] spirit we'll talk about it in a little
[1:23:19] minute amen but you can be led by a lot
[1:23:22] of things today
[1:23:23] and guess what we think Satan's gonna
[1:23:25] jump out as some big demon some black
[1:23:28] thing something very dark and obvious
[1:23:30] and guess what that is not the way Satan
[1:23:32] operates especially with well-taught
[1:23:35] believers
[1:23:37] he's not going to be obvious remember
[1:23:39] brother Brown said I had it in here and
[1:23:41] I took it out he says to overcome is to
[1:23:43] recognize Satan in every one of his
[1:23:45] tricks and to recognize that he that is
[1:23:48] in you is greater than he that is in the
[1:23:50] world that you've already overcome you
[1:23:51] can't overcome by what's inside of you
[1:23:53] but to recognize Satan in every one of
[1:23:55] his tricks which means it's not going to
[1:23:56] be obvious
[1:23:58] listen Satan disguises himself and his
[1:24:01] demons as what
[1:24:03] angels of light
[1:24:04] scripture says in second Corinthians 11
[1:24:07] Paul is dealing with a situation he says
[1:24:09] but what I do that will I do in order
[1:24:11] what I'm what I'm doing I'm going to
[1:24:12] keep doing it that I may cut off
[1:24:14] occasion from them which desire occasion
[1:24:16] that were in their Glory they may be
[1:24:18] found even as we the Amplified it says
[1:24:20] but what I do I will continue to do for
[1:24:23] I am to determined to maintain this
[1:24:25] independence of being bound by
[1:24:26] obligation to you because you support me
[1:24:28] in order to cut off the claim of those
[1:24:31] who would like to find an occasion to
[1:24:32] claim that in their boasted mission in
[1:24:34] life they work on the same terms we do
[1:24:36] what was happening here is Paul was
[1:24:38] dealing with so-called ministers that
[1:24:40] said were the same as Paul is and
[1:24:42] because of that you have to support us
[1:24:44] as you support Paul you need to support
[1:24:47] us what was it they were in it for the
[1:24:49] money so Paul says here he says I work
[1:24:52] with my hands so that you wouldn't have
[1:24:54] to pay me
[1:24:55] he says and I'm going to keep doing that
[1:24:57] to see who's really in it for the
[1:24:58] ministering of the Saints and who's in
[1:25:00] it for the money because if they're in
[1:25:01] it like I am as they say they are then
[1:25:03] they'll work without money
[1:25:04] meaning they'll do whatever it takes to
[1:25:06] stay independent of influence so Paul
[1:25:08] was trying to keep people from being
[1:25:09] copycats of him
[1:25:12] and he continues to describe them he
[1:25:14] says for such are false Apostles
[1:25:16] deceitful workers
[1:25:18] transforming themselves into the
[1:25:21] Apostles of Christ
[1:25:22] transforming themselves
[1:25:25] not a work of the inward heart but an
[1:25:27] outward work to show men
[1:25:29] he says in no Marvel for Satan himself
[1:25:32] is transformed into an angel of Light
[1:25:34] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:25:37] ministers also be transformed as the
[1:25:39] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:25:41] shall be according to their works you
[1:25:44] can hide your motives every day of your
[1:25:45] life but in the end the fruit never lies
[1:25:48] I mentioned it I think last service amen
[1:25:50] but if you're looking for a big demon to
[1:25:53] announce itself in life you're not going
[1:25:55] to see it that way
[1:25:57] why he says here the demon is a man
[1:26:00] the demon is a woman it's a minister
[1:26:02] it's somebody that is appearing to be a
[1:26:04] believer somebody that is appearing to
[1:26:06] be spiritual somebody is appearing to be
[1:26:08] religious but they have another motive
[1:26:10] and another objective in their life and
[1:26:12] they'll suck you into something for
[1:26:14] their benefit and not yours and you can
[1:26:16] become a slave to it and we've seen this
[1:26:17] mostly from a Ministry side to be frank
[1:26:19] if for those that have been around the
[1:26:21] message a long time you've seen the
[1:26:22] perusian movement you've seen the two
[1:26:24] Souls movement you've seen that we're in
[1:26:26] the Millennium movement you've seen all
[1:26:27] these different things right and what is
[1:26:29] it men got caught up in men's Ministries
[1:26:31] I'm not calling those men Ministers of
[1:26:33] Darkness
[1:26:34] but they got caught up in the men rather
[1:26:36] than in the Holy Spirit and it led them
[1:26:38] to a place where even if the doctrine
[1:26:39] may have been correct the attitude was
[1:26:42] wrong and the fruit of it was that they
[1:26:43] went into cold formalism and they all
[1:26:45] died off they never went anywhere good
[1:26:47] they were drawn down by what Satan was
[1:26:49] using a man
[1:26:51] or using the man to influence them to
[1:26:53] where they put that man to a level
[1:26:55] higher than he needed to be amen
[1:26:57] listen us ministers need to watch out
[1:26:59] for these things especially
[1:27:01] I speak probably to myself here brother
[1:27:03] Gerald's essentially you know he's he
[1:27:05] he's more or less finished his race you
[1:27:07] know and and he hasn't fallen to the
[1:27:10] influence of of people in that but I'll
[1:27:12] tell you it can be a heady feeling when
[1:27:13] somebody comes to you and says brother
[1:27:14] John what do I do and whatever I tell
[1:27:16] them they'll do
[1:27:18] that's a huge responsibility and if you
[1:27:21] start to think if I start to think for a
[1:27:22] second that this is about me I'll lead
[1:27:24] them astray every time
[1:27:25] because any influence I have is of him
[1:27:28] not of myself and any gift I have is of
[1:27:30] him and not of myself and if there's any
[1:27:32] any discernments of the holy spirit it's
[1:27:34] not of me because I don't do it I don't
[1:27:36] do it instinctively I don't have any
[1:27:37] conscience of anything that's happening
[1:27:38] in those areas
[1:27:40] but you can get caught up in those
[1:27:41] things and you can draw people to
[1:27:43] yourself and you can turn it around and
[1:27:44] you can start to make money off it you
[1:27:46] can start to make influence pretty soon
[1:27:47] you become we're not talking about me
[1:27:49] because I'll never get there pretty soon
[1:27:50] everyone wants you at their convention
[1:27:52] pretty soon everybody wants you to come
[1:27:54] to their special meetings to dedicate
[1:27:55] their church and you can get to a place
[1:27:57] where you get caught up in it and all of
[1:27:59] a sudden you become a servant of
[1:28:01] anything but the holy spirit because
[1:28:03] it's about you and you're drawing people
[1:28:05] to you and these different things
[1:28:07] that's what I was going to say earlier
[1:28:08] and I said it a bit last service if
[1:28:10] you've talked to me anytime in the last
[1:28:12] couple of months I've said I've been
[1:28:13] talking about the fruit
[1:28:15] because Jesus said by your fruit you
[1:28:18] shall know them and guess what fruit
[1:28:19] doesn't appear overnight does it
[1:28:22] there's a reason why we're supposed to
[1:28:23] watch ministers for a while
[1:28:25] there's a reason why we're supposed to
[1:28:27] watch Believers new ones as you come in
[1:28:29] contact with people we're supposed to
[1:28:30] watch them and see where is the fruit of
[1:28:33] it where's the fruit of their life
[1:28:34] because we can meet people and I've met
[1:28:36] many through my life and they can only
[1:28:38] talk about the message of the hour
[1:28:40] and you think that's a solid believer
[1:28:43] and then three months down the road they
[1:28:45] have to make a decision and that
[1:28:47] decision is completely contrary to the
[1:28:49] word of God but every time you meet them
[1:28:51] they'll talk about the message of the
[1:28:52] hour
[1:28:53] and you start to say uh oh
[1:28:55] why because there's a religious spirit
[1:28:57] operating because they love the
[1:29:00] knowledge of the message but they won't
[1:29:01] let the message have control of their
[1:29:03] life and you start to get these red
[1:29:05] flags go up oh oh oh oh
[1:29:07] and they can talk the hind leg off of a
[1:29:09] mule as the saying goes they can share
[1:29:12] great Revelations but you look at the
[1:29:13] life and you say
[1:29:15] it's not matching up with the word and
[1:29:17] what I found is usually the people that
[1:29:19] are busy living it don't have time to
[1:29:20] talk about it too much
[1:29:22] you're too busy doing what the word says
[1:29:25] then to sit there and talk about all the
[1:29:26] things God's been telling you
[1:29:28] because usually what God's been telling
[1:29:29] us about has an effect on our daily life
[1:29:31] it's not just mind things it's not just
[1:29:33] intelligence it's not just knowledge
[1:29:34] it's just not Revelation for the sake of
[1:29:36] knowing but it's going into our lives
[1:29:37] and he's working in our lives he's
[1:29:40] working in our lives and so we don't
[1:29:41] have time to sit there always and
[1:29:43] expound on things because we're buried
[1:29:45] in the Walk we're buried in the
[1:29:46] relationship it's kind of like if
[1:29:48] somebody's always talking about their
[1:29:50] relationship to their spouse usually
[1:29:51] they don't have much of one
[1:29:54] now I say this without reverence to the
[1:29:55] younger couples that are here usually
[1:29:57] you think your relationship is fantastic
[1:29:59] and it hasn't been tested yet and as it
[1:30:01] gets to the testing point you ought you
[1:30:03] usually realize it's not as good as it
[1:30:05] used to be and then it starts to grow to
[1:30:07] match the trial doesn't it it starts to
[1:30:08] grow to match the test and you have your
[1:30:10] first kid and all of a sudden you you
[1:30:12] don't have all the sleep that you would
[1:30:13] normally get and you don't have all the
[1:30:15] time to look beautiful that you used to
[1:30:16] have and and to be you know fit because
[1:30:19] you always have time to go and all these
[1:30:20] things and all of a sudden the
[1:30:21] relationship starts to get challenged
[1:30:22] doesn't it
[1:30:24] and all of a sudden you realize we're
[1:30:25] gonna have to grow
[1:30:26] this relationship is going to have to
[1:30:28] expand our love our consideration our
[1:30:30] patience our Good Will long suffering
[1:30:33] all these things are going to have to
[1:30:33] grow otherwise the relationship is going
[1:30:36] to fail amen wisdom is knowledge applied
[1:30:38] correctly and it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:30:40] to apply the word in your life otherwise
[1:30:42] it's just head it's just in your head
[1:30:44] it's not going to take you anywhere and
[1:30:45] I'm not saying people that do that I'm
[1:30:48] not saying people that make wrong
[1:30:49] decisions don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:30:50] because otherwise I don't have it I've
[1:30:51] made plenty of wrong decisions and I
[1:30:53] still make them but what it does point
[1:30:54] to is you've got another influence in
[1:30:56] your life in that area of your life
[1:30:59] because God's moving room by room
[1:31:01] right
[1:31:02] he's moving room by room he's still at
[1:31:04] least in mind moving room by Roman he's
[1:31:06] moving things out and he's filling them
[1:31:08] up with himself amen so there's areas in
[1:31:10] my life that maybe aren't fully
[1:31:11] surrendered in the way they need to be
[1:31:12] yet but he's got to work in that he's
[1:31:14] going to work in your life the exact
[1:31:15] same way amen
[1:31:18] but if somebody continually rejects the
[1:31:20] leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[1:31:22] submitting themselves to what the word
[1:31:23] of God says then you do have to question
[1:31:26] what is what anointing are you under
[1:31:28] absolutely you do brother Branham said
[1:31:30] he says if you won't live by the word
[1:31:32] then how can you have it inside of you
[1:31:33] because the holy spirit will never deny
[1:31:34] the word of God
[1:31:38] listen it comes to the place where Paul
[1:31:40] Peter talking about Paul's writings he
[1:31:42] says also in his epistle speaking in
[1:31:45] them of these things in which there are
[1:31:46] some things hard to be understood Paul
[1:31:48] was a very very intellectual person
[1:31:52] but what an anointed Ministry I mean I
[1:31:54] it blows my mind sometimes some of the
[1:31:57] things that he comes up with and he
[1:31:58] didn't come up with it that's the beauty
[1:31:59] of it he didn't come up with it it's the
[1:32:00] Holy Spirit gave him these things and
[1:32:02] he's sharing them with us but he but
[1:32:04] Peter will point to this and he say
[1:32:06] which they that are unlearned and
[1:32:08] unstable rest as they do also the other
[1:32:12] scriptures onto their own description
[1:32:14] under their own destruction unlearn it
[1:32:16] and unstable rest he means they wrestle
[1:32:18] with it they struggle with it they
[1:32:19] strive with it they try and manipulate
[1:32:21] the word of God because it doesn't work
[1:32:23] the way they think it should work it
[1:32:25] doesn't do it doesn't agree with how
[1:32:28] they think it should fit and this is
[1:32:30] again something us ministers deal with
[1:32:31] I've mentioned it before sometimes we
[1:32:33] get a revelation
[1:32:35] I'm speaking from actual personal
[1:32:37] experience including this week where you
[1:32:39] think God's given you something and you
[1:32:41] go and you start to look in the word of
[1:32:43] God
[1:32:43] and everything's good until you hit one
[1:32:46] scripture
[1:32:47] and it doesn't work
[1:32:49] and the question of whether or not
[1:32:50] you're truly anointed is what will you
[1:32:53] do when you hit that one thing that
[1:32:55] doesn't agree with this great Revelation
[1:32:57] that you've had
[1:32:58] because you've got to throw the whole
[1:33:00] thing away
[1:33:01] the whole thing
[1:33:03] the whole thing I was literally typing
[1:33:05] this sermon up in my notes and I was
[1:33:07] typing typing and it's just flowing and
[1:33:09] this is the way it works I was just
[1:33:11] flowing then I stopped and I said where
[1:33:13] did that come from
[1:33:15] that is total baloney
[1:33:18] I'm being serious I'm being serious now
[1:33:21] because guess what you can be anointed
[1:33:23] but that does not mean that Satan's not
[1:33:25] in there trying to drill a thought into
[1:33:27] your head and if he can slide it in
[1:33:28] there and put in a seated discrepancy
[1:33:31] where somebody says why where did
[1:33:33] Jonathan come up with that don't even
[1:33:35] call me brother where did John come up
[1:33:36] with that
[1:33:38] it wasn't the Holy Spirit you gotta
[1:33:40] check every word you got to check every
[1:33:42] word
[1:33:43] amen it's the same thing with ours what
[1:33:45] what Peter's talking about here is that
[1:33:47] people take the word and they apply it
[1:33:50] they go in and they look for
[1:33:51] confirmation of their decision
[1:33:54] that's not the way it works they're
[1:33:56] looking it's confirmation bias you'll
[1:33:58] only read what what matches what your
[1:34:00] decision has already made right but what
[1:34:02] he's saying is they wrestle with it they
[1:34:04] manipulate it they're trying to bring it
[1:34:06] to a place where they can in good
[1:34:07] conscience can doing doing what they
[1:34:09] continue doing what they've already
[1:34:11] decided to do
[1:34:13] and that's not the way it works we're
[1:34:14] supposed to bring every thought subject
[1:34:17] to the word of God not bring the word
[1:34:19] subject to the thought we don't shape
[1:34:21] the word with our thought but we shape
[1:34:23] our thought we shape our decision with
[1:34:25] the word of God Amen the Amplified there
[1:34:28] says those that are ignorant and
[1:34:30] unstable twist and misconstrue to their
[1:34:33] own utter destruction just as they
[1:34:35] distort and misinterpret the rest of the
[1:34:38] scriptures
[1:34:39] you'll find that people there are people
[1:34:42] that every decision they make they say
[1:34:46] I've checked it with the word
[1:34:48] but then you go and you read the entire
[1:34:49] word and you see that it can't make
[1:34:51] sense it's because they stopped when
[1:34:52] they found what they were looking for
[1:34:54] rather than pulling it through the
[1:34:55] entire thing brother Brown says it's got
[1:34:57] to be Genesis to revelation
[1:34:59] Old Testament New Testaments got to line
[1:35:01] up you've got to have two points of of
[1:35:03] reference for it pull it all the way
[1:35:04] through amen
[1:35:13] so we can get stuck when we misconstrue
[1:35:16] but you know we can get stuck at
[1:35:17] believing
[1:35:20] and by believing I mean saying I believe
[1:35:23] not just believing because believing
[1:35:25] will true belief will take you somewhere
[1:35:27] but we can stop at just saying I believe
[1:35:30] we can we can sit here as message
[1:35:31] Believers as as believing we're part of
[1:35:34] the bride of Christ and just nod our
[1:35:35] heads and say I believe but that is not
[1:35:38] what believing is because brother Brown
[1:35:40] says if you believed it you'd do it
[1:35:42] amen and Jesus said this he was he was
[1:35:44] talking to the people when they heard a
[1:35:46] minister and he's early on in his
[1:35:47] ministry and it says as he spake these
[1:35:49] words many believed on him great start
[1:35:53] but Jesus said then just said Jesus to
[1:35:56] these Jews which believed on him if you
[1:35:58] continue in my word then are ye my
[1:36:01] disciples indeed if you look at the the
[1:36:04] Greek and that it means to hold fast and
[1:36:06] live by this
[1:36:08] so if you believe it hold fast and live
[1:36:12] by it that's when you're my disciples
[1:36:14] not when you just nod your head and say
[1:36:16] I believe or when you say amen he says
[1:36:18] if you do that you shall know the truth
[1:36:20] and the truth shall make you free and
[1:36:23] again I'm trying to bring this to our
[1:36:25] our level today because I believe we're
[1:36:27] being raised in a message culture
[1:36:30] and for anyone that's traveled you know
[1:36:32] to to you camps and other churches and
[1:36:35] these different things it's very easy to
[1:36:37] get caught up in a culture of what the
[1:36:38] message teaches
[1:36:40] where everybody dresses a certain way
[1:36:42] they act a certain way and we all should
[1:36:44] there should be relative uniformity
[1:36:47] across the way we we act and and the
[1:36:49] things we say the way we dress and these
[1:36:50] different things but but it's this idea
[1:36:54] that you're raised around truth and
[1:36:55] therefore you are right
[1:36:57] and brother Branham said and we've read
[1:36:59] it there where he says no that's just
[1:37:01] joining a church he says You must be a
[1:37:03] son or a daughter of God
[1:37:06] you must go through a new birth you must
[1:37:09] come through the way they did in Acts 2
[1:37:11] 38.
[1:37:12] you must go through what they went
[1:37:14] through in the upper room you've got to
[1:37:16] come through that it is not a culture
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:19] it's great it's good to have it it's
[1:37:21] healthy and it's wholesome but that is
[1:37:23] not going to get you in the rapture
[1:37:25] it's not going to get you in the Rapture
[1:37:26] because the message without the Holy
[1:37:28] Ghost is just at another denomination
[1:37:30] I'm saying a message culture you know
[1:37:32] what I'm talking about amen
[1:37:34] amen remember the reward in the Book of
[1:37:36] Revelation is not to him that has great
[1:37:37] revelation
[1:37:38] is it
[1:37:40] says to him that overcometh
[1:37:42] amen that means you've got to move from
[1:37:43] believing to living you got to move from
[1:37:45] not in your head and say Amen to doing
[1:37:47] what you said amen to it's got to be a
[1:37:49] Wellspring inside of you that's coming
[1:37:51] up and bubbling out that's drawing the
[1:37:53] fruit of the Holy Spirit into your life
[1:37:54] amen that that Prophet came to do one
[1:37:57] thing and that was give us a message
[1:37:59] that would give us over Pat overcoming
[1:38:01] power to take us into a rapture
[1:38:03] all he was interested in was getting a
[1:38:05] bride out and up out of and into
[1:38:10] and to what a relationship with Christ
[1:38:12] that would draw her off of this Earth
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:15] what does revelation do Revelation shows
[1:38:17] you what God's doing and it also shows
[1:38:19] you what Satan's doing but if you don't
[1:38:21] heed it then what's the point of it
[1:38:24] if you're going to come to church and
[1:38:25] ignore everything that's said over the
[1:38:27] pulpit you might as well stay home and
[1:38:28] watch a hockey game
[1:38:29] for all the good it's going to do you
[1:38:31] because you're just going to be judged
[1:38:32] by what comes over this Pulpit if you're
[1:38:33] not going to hear it that's a horrible
[1:38:35] place to be amen this is it becomes
[1:38:38] judgment when we don't hear it it's
[1:38:40] Mercy if we heed it in this judgment if
[1:38:42] we don't amen
[1:38:43] men how we treat the word of God is how
[1:38:45] we treat him
[1:38:47] if we want to get down to it brother Bob
[1:38:49] says this he says the sounding of the
[1:38:51] trumpet yes sir return
[1:38:53] dispersed but if you sold your
[1:38:56] inheritance if you sold out and done
[1:38:58] these things he says what am I saying
[1:39:00] return back if you joined up with some
[1:39:03] cult that tries to keep you away from
[1:39:04] fellowship with other Brethren leave the
[1:39:07] thing this is Jubilee amen return return
[1:39:10] this is jubilee don't let it pass by
[1:39:13] remember don't let it pass by
[1:39:18] he says if you've sold out
[1:39:20] they caught me there
[1:39:22] because the question I asked myself is
[1:39:24] what's my price
[1:39:26] what's my price
[1:39:28] to what am I sold out to how I spend my
[1:39:31] time how I spend my energy how I spend
[1:39:34] my money
[1:39:35] that's how that's my that's where you'll
[1:39:38] see what prices I I'm willing to be sold
[1:39:41] for
[1:39:42] because whatever I'm doing that for is
[1:39:43] what has bought me is what has given me
[1:39:46] what I need so if I'm doing it for the
[1:39:48] kingdom of God then I've sold out to the
[1:39:50] right thing but if I'm seeking the
[1:39:52] things that are of this world then I've
[1:39:53] sold out to something else and my price
[1:39:55] is not a spiritual price it's a natural
[1:39:57] price just like Kane just like Esau
[1:40:00] right
[1:40:01] they were willing to sell for something
[1:40:03] that was not what eternal and they got
[1:40:06] caught up in it if you've sold out if
[1:40:08] you went out in the world if you've
[1:40:10] sinned you know that you once had the
[1:40:12] experience
[1:40:13] so remember he's not talking about
[1:40:15] somebody that is a ranked sinner that's
[1:40:17] never known the good things of God he
[1:40:19] says if you've known that you once had
[1:40:21] the experience you went and joined up
[1:40:23] where you came fellowship with the rest
[1:40:24] of them you've done all these things I
[1:40:26] don't care what you've done if you're a
[1:40:28] son you have a right to return now
[1:40:30] because it's Jubilee but if you settle
[1:40:33] back into a wall somewhere put your name
[1:40:36] down and anchored got all chickenized
[1:40:38] there isn't going to much happen to you
[1:40:41] because you'll never hear it he's
[1:40:43] talking about what if you're an eagle in
[1:40:44] a chicken pen
[1:40:46] and you hear that eagle scream and you
[1:40:47] don't come out he says you'll be pretty
[1:40:49] chickenized by the time it's all said
[1:40:50] and done you'll just say I'm a chicken
[1:40:52] like the rest of them
[1:40:54] you'll never be a good chicken
[1:40:56] and you'll never be a good eagle
[1:40:58] you got to get out of there
[1:41:00] he says you'll walk out and say well I
[1:41:02] guess it was all right I've heard that
[1:41:03] before
[1:41:05] I feel bad for brother Gerald sometimes
[1:41:07] and the older folks here because you've
[1:41:09] heard most of it you've heard most of it
[1:41:11] there's probably not a whole lot of new
[1:41:12] things coming over the pulpit anymore
[1:41:13] you know Brandon warns against it don't
[1:41:16] let it become common to you and then the
[1:41:18] word is the word and I'll tell you one
[1:41:20] thing if if if I if I underline
[1:41:23] something new every time it came out of
[1:41:25] my Bible be full of ink you'd be
[1:41:27] underlining over and over again the same
[1:41:29] scripture because it means something
[1:41:30] different to you almost every other time
[1:41:32] you read it right because it's ever
[1:41:34] unfolding it's ever unfolding I think
[1:41:36] the difficulty somebody is sometimes as
[1:41:38] an older person is you're waiting for us
[1:41:39] young people to catch up to you
[1:41:41] right and that's difficult sometimes
[1:41:44] but he says see go home sleep it off and
[1:41:47] get up the next morning he says but
[1:41:49] conviction you don't sleep off the word
[1:41:51] of God you can't shake off if you're an
[1:41:53] eagle you've caught something
[1:41:57] it's good when you go into a church when
[1:41:59] you go into a service and something just
[1:42:01] calls you right out
[1:42:03] not calls you out but it catches your
[1:42:05] attention and you know that was just for
[1:42:07] me and you go home and you can chew on
[1:42:10] that thing for a month
[1:42:11] because you know God was in it
[1:42:14] and you'll sit there and you'll just
[1:42:15] ruminate and ruminate on it and you'll
[1:42:17] dream about it and you'll wake up
[1:42:18] thinking about it and the songs you have
[1:42:20] in your head will be like it and you'll
[1:42:22] be running everything through that
[1:42:23] filter for the next month because you
[1:42:24] know God gave it to you
[1:42:25] and it's a special thing
[1:42:27] but brother Brown says if you walk out
[1:42:28] and say ah yeah I heard that before but
[1:42:31] the John's getting really repetitive
[1:42:33] that's tough
[1:42:35] because he says what that's not the way
[1:42:36] it works for an eagle when they hear the
[1:42:38] word of God they latch onto it amen but
[1:42:41] religious Spirits are the Hallmark of
[1:42:42] the laodicean age and you know it
[1:42:44] because it loves to talk but it hates to
[1:42:46] act
[1:42:47] a religious spirit is all talk no action
[1:42:50] amen it's satisfied with the knowledge
[1:42:52] of the word but it refuses the
[1:42:54] correction the direction and the
[1:42:57] boundaries of that the word of God
[1:42:58] places on their life amen and what
[1:43:00] happens is they miss the blessings of
[1:43:01] God and they miss the fullness of the
[1:43:03] anointing for this age
[1:43:06] because you've choked it off you've
[1:43:07] throttled it
[1:43:09] you've held it back
[1:43:11] and God can't do everything he's
[1:43:12] supposed to Paul warned Timothy about
[1:43:14] this and we're coming to a close
[1:43:16] he says what these people are having a
[1:43:19] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:43:21] thereof from such turn away
[1:43:25] brother Adam this is a a very short
[1:43:27] quote he says the Antichrist spirit is a
[1:43:30] religious spirit
[1:43:32] that's a scary thought because remember
[1:43:34] I'm listening to the message that see to
[1:43:36] see the discrepancy brother Brown comes
[1:43:38] to that scripture it says that that they
[1:43:40] grow up together and the the two Spirits
[1:43:42] are so close that it would deceive the
[1:43:44] very elect if it were possible that's
[1:43:47] how tight we're talking about it he says
[1:43:49] it's within the framework of the church
[1:43:52] that's that's a scary thought to think
[1:43:55] that Satan is not roaming around out
[1:43:56] there and these these alternative
[1:43:58] lifestyle movements and that he's in all
[1:44:00] of that but he's working right in here
[1:44:03] trying to work in here trying to get in
[1:44:06] trying to slide something into your life
[1:44:07] and you don't even realize it
[1:44:10] the best thing saying Duke is be in your
[1:44:12] life and you not know about it because
[1:44:14] why do you need Deliverance if you don't
[1:44:15] know about it that's why we come and
[1:44:17] hear the trumpet of the Gospel it lets
[1:44:19] you know it tells you when something's
[1:44:20] off amen
[1:44:23] brother Brahm says but God knows what
[1:44:24] he's doing as long as he's leading you
[1:44:27] see you must always go by the spirit and
[1:44:30] the spirit will always agree with the
[1:44:33] word now if the spirit leads you
[1:44:35] contrary to the word then it's not the
[1:44:38] spirit of God that's very simple Church
[1:44:41] if it is contrary to this it is never
[1:44:44] ever ever the Holy Spirit
[1:44:47] no matter which way we try and pull it
[1:44:49] which way we dice it which way we argue
[1:44:51] it which way we we pull it around in our
[1:44:54] head no matter how long we argue it if
[1:44:55] it doesn't agree with this the holy
[1:44:58] spirit is not leading you and there's
[1:45:00] only one other Spirit besides the Holy
[1:45:01] Spirit
[1:45:02] and it's a seed of discrepancy right
[1:45:04] it's satanic in its origin he says now
[1:45:07] if the holy spirit is leading you it'll
[1:45:09] say Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:45:11] today and forever
[1:45:14] now you can sit here and say brother
[1:45:15] John why are you preaching on religious
[1:45:17] Spirits you're supposed to be preaching
[1:45:18] on the Jubilee this is supposed to be
[1:45:20] wonderful it's supposed to be Freedom
[1:45:21] it's supposed to be all these things I'm
[1:45:23] preaching on it because this is what the
[1:45:25] laodicean church age fights is a
[1:45:27] religious spirit
[1:45:29] so I'm not saying you have it I'm saying
[1:45:31] watch out for it watch out for it if the
[1:45:33] word stops having an effect on your life
[1:45:35] you've got a religious spirit on you you
[1:45:38] say can the Holy Spirit person have a
[1:45:39] religious spirit absolutely
[1:45:42] absolutely
[1:45:43] why pride gets up
[1:45:46] fear gets up
[1:45:47] worry gets up anything basically you
[1:45:50] take the opposite of the fruits of the
[1:45:52] holy spirit that will allow a religious
[1:45:53] spirit to come in and it'll get a a toe
[1:45:56] hold and they'll turn into a stronghold
[1:45:58] as brother Joe talked about in your life
[1:46:00] but again it's temporary by God's grace
[1:46:03] because he's not going to lose a one
[1:46:05] right the ones that are in the palms of
[1:46:07] his hand he's not going to miss a one he
[1:46:08] said they're always going to be there
[1:46:09] but that doesn't mean you can't come
[1:46:11] under another influence
[1:46:13] absolutely you can absolutely you can
[1:46:15] every mistake you make you've allowed
[1:46:17] another influence into your life that's
[1:46:19] all it is but it's if you continually do
[1:46:21] it it's probably not a thing to talk
[1:46:24] about over the pulpit but in gambling
[1:46:25] they talk about doubling down
[1:46:27] so if you make a bet and you're
[1:46:29] convinced that you're going to win
[1:46:30] whatever you're playing you there's an
[1:46:32] option to double down you can double
[1:46:33] your bet and what happens so often is
[1:46:35] people double down on their Badness
[1:46:37] their bad decisions on their mistakes
[1:46:39] and they they refuse to acknowledge that
[1:46:41] they were wrong and what happens is they
[1:46:43] go even further down into it and that's
[1:46:44] when the religious spirit comes in first
[1:46:46] one's an influence
[1:46:48] right you just you gave in you you
[1:46:50] weren't quite there where you needed to
[1:46:51] be you had a bad day you didn't have
[1:46:53] devotions that morning whatever it might
[1:46:54] be but when you double down on it that's
[1:46:56] when you open the door for a truly
[1:46:58] religious spirit to come in because now
[1:46:59] you're trying to hide the failure and
[1:47:01] the mistake and the problem and the
[1:47:02] faults and these different things right
[1:47:04] how do you know a religious spirit
[1:47:06] it never overcomes it never overcomes
[1:47:10] that's what that's what we just read in
[1:47:12] Timothy remember he says a form of
[1:47:14] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:47:16] they never get what overcoming power in
[1:47:19] their life because the first Victory is
[1:47:20] here
[1:47:22] first Victory is here as a as a Believer
[1:47:24] as young young believers to our young
[1:47:26] people the first Victory is always going
[1:47:27] to be inside it's going to be your
[1:47:29] nature it's going to be your mind it's
[1:47:31] going to be the way you think it's the
[1:47:32] way you make decisions it's not going to
[1:47:34] be all this stuff outside it's going to
[1:47:35] be inside of you the way you approach
[1:47:37] the way you react and all of these
[1:47:38] different things amen
[1:47:41] but what happens we get up and we we
[1:47:42] start to fear loss of reputation
[1:47:44] loss of status loss of money loss of
[1:47:47] relationship closeness of relationship
[1:47:49] whatever it is whatever little thing
[1:47:50] we've got we say if they find out it'll
[1:47:52] ruin things and that's when a religious
[1:47:54] spirit has such a toll hold is when
[1:47:56] we're scared that somebody's going to
[1:47:57] realize that we've got an issue that
[1:47:59] we're not what we say we are
[1:48:02] that's the toehold Satan's looking for
[1:48:03] is when we try and build a facade rather
[1:48:05] than say this one's for me Lord
[1:48:07] this one's for me that's me
[1:48:10] that's me he's talking about
[1:48:12] whatever it is we're not I'm not being
[1:48:14] specific here today but remember the
[1:48:16] scripture says if we walk in the light
[1:48:18] as he's in the light
[1:48:20] then have we Fellowship
[1:48:22] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:48:24] cleanses us from all of our sins we're
[1:48:26] supposed to love the light
[1:48:28] we're supposed to love the light we're
[1:48:30] supposed to embrace it
[1:48:32] when brother John Andes was here there
[1:48:34] were some moments there where you just
[1:48:35] wanted to duck
[1:48:37] for myself I'll say
[1:48:40] because it and and I've had it from
[1:48:42] other ministers as well of course
[1:48:44] but you just want to duck because it's
[1:48:46] so piercing
[1:48:49] but that's the human nature that's what
[1:48:50] a religious spirit wants to do is duck
[1:48:52] away from the light but a child of God
[1:48:55] says you got me
[1:48:56] that's true yay Lord
[1:48:59] yay Lord that's me
[1:49:01] and then when you do that what does that
[1:49:03] allow that opens the door all the way
[1:49:05] open and the Holy Spirit can come in and
[1:49:07] he can burn it out he can clean it out
[1:49:08] he can move it out he can push it out he
[1:49:10] can beat it out he can do whatever he
[1:49:12] needs to do whatever it's been hiding
[1:49:14] behind that little door in your life
[1:49:15] behind that concern behind that attitude
[1:49:17] behind that cynicism behind that complex
[1:49:19] that depression
[1:49:21] relationship issues whatever it might be
[1:49:23] he can come in there and he can start to
[1:49:25] move now but when you slam the door and
[1:49:27] say nope don't need it
[1:49:29] been dealing with that all my life and
[1:49:30] it's been okay
[1:49:31] he's got nowhere to go
[1:49:33] amen
[1:49:35] what is it you rather not you're a slave
[1:49:37] than be freed from the slavery you're in
[1:49:39] that's a sad place
[1:49:42] Hebrews 10 39 says but we are not of
[1:49:44] them who draw back into Perdition that
[1:49:47] word perdition means Eternal misery
[1:49:50] and that's a miserable place to be when
[1:49:52] the word has no effect in your life when
[1:49:55] you would rather duck and hide
[1:49:57] than to let it take and ha and do what
[1:50:00] it's supposed to do in your life amen
[1:50:03] you aren't miserable but if you move
[1:50:05] back that's where you end up
[1:50:07] knows it says move back into miserably
[1:50:08] you left misery I was miserable I've
[1:50:11] talked about him many times before I
[1:50:13] gave my heart to the Lord I was
[1:50:14] miserable because I I wanted to be saved
[1:50:16] but I didn't know if I wanted to be
[1:50:17] saved and you're in that back and forth
[1:50:19] you're in no man's land but soon as you
[1:50:21] give your life to God now you're in now
[1:50:22] you're in a defined area now you're
[1:50:24] headed in a Direction but Paul says if
[1:50:26] you pull back from there that's when you
[1:50:28] get into trouble you get into misery
[1:50:29] because you draw back from where the
[1:50:31] word is going it's moving forward it's
[1:50:34] opening things up in your life and you
[1:50:35] pull back and you say nah I don't want
[1:50:36] any of that that's when you get
[1:50:38] miserable and guess what a child of God
[1:50:40] is miserable outside of the presence of
[1:50:42] the father
[1:50:43] you know brother brother John was
[1:50:45] talking about that that that prodigal
[1:50:47] son he says and when he came to himself
[1:50:49] you know what he heard he heard a
[1:50:51] jubilee trumpet but he only he was the
[1:50:53] only one that heard it he says even the
[1:50:55] servants in My Father's House live
[1:50:56] better than I am
[1:50:57] he says I'll go back and I'll take even
[1:50:59] a servant's role better than where I got
[1:51:01] myself in all of this that's what we're
[1:51:03] talking about don't draw back when you
[1:51:05] hear it but embrace it amen
[1:51:08] because why when the trumpet sounds
[1:51:10] you've got to go in the right direction
[1:51:13] because so many people remember we
[1:51:15] talked about every seven years you got
[1:51:16] free from jail you got free from your
[1:51:18] debt you got free from your slavery why
[1:51:21] because we're human and God built in a
[1:51:24] Grace law every seven years because
[1:51:25] we're prone to failure and what happened
[1:51:27] so many times is they went in and a
[1:51:29] problem gotten into debt they got relief
[1:51:31] from it and then they ranked back and
[1:51:33] they found a new habit if they went from
[1:51:35] an old jail to a new jail they went from
[1:51:38] an old Habit to a new habit they went
[1:51:39] from one bad relationship to another bad
[1:51:41] relationship they went from one casino
[1:51:43] to the next Casino all they did was they
[1:51:46] continued doing what they were doing
[1:51:47] just in another place and it got them in
[1:51:49] the Dead all over again
[1:51:50] I'll get a move to a new church I'm
[1:51:52] going to move to a new town I'm going to
[1:51:53] start a new job it doesn't change
[1:51:54] anything because you're the same
[1:51:56] amen right you had to go to your land
[1:51:59] because your land was where God was
[1:52:00] going to work with you and bless you
[1:52:01] amen what we need to get where God wants
[1:52:04] us to be so that our battles mean
[1:52:06] something
[1:52:07] because what happens is if you're not on
[1:52:09] your land you're fighting over somebody
[1:52:10] else's property
[1:52:12] and what happens is you're getting in a
[1:52:13] fight where you've got no right to win
[1:52:15] right
[1:52:17] that's it so I laugh at these things on
[1:52:20] social media and people getting into
[1:52:21] fights with people and then I'm like
[1:52:22] this is not your land you're never gonna
[1:52:24] win
[1:52:25] you're never going to win
[1:52:27] and we get into fights with people about
[1:52:28] relationships and this and that and the
[1:52:30] other stay in your lane get in your land
[1:52:32] get in your position and fight there
[1:52:35] because God will back you up when you're
[1:52:36] where he wants you to be
[1:52:38] amen not where you're you're not where
[1:52:40] you're trying to hurt somebody else to
[1:52:41] their point but you stay in your land
[1:52:42] God will get them to their land you stay
[1:52:44] in your land that's where you can do it
[1:52:46] I've said it before the prodigal father
[1:52:47] this the father The Prodigal Son never
[1:52:50] went looking
[1:52:51] he stayed where the son could find him
[1:52:54] he knew where he could go he had to go
[1:52:55] back to my father's house it's the same
[1:52:58] thing with us stay in your place stay in
[1:53:00] your position that way God can he can
[1:53:02] back you up but if you're running around
[1:53:03] all over the place doing things Helter
[1:53:05] Skelter this way that way God can't
[1:53:07] touch you there
[1:53:08] otherwise you're just getting out of one
[1:53:10] slavery and into another one then you
[1:53:12] get into what the Death March
[1:53:13] just like the children of Israel it's
[1:53:15] just circular hiking in the desert and
[1:53:17] that's not fun for anybody
[1:53:19] nobody likes hiking around in circles in
[1:53:21] the desert they die they call it the
[1:53:22] Death March
[1:53:26] brother Bram says this now a man and his
[1:53:28] family
[1:53:29] could go back to their original
[1:53:30] inheritance if they could hear the
[1:53:32] Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know
[1:53:35] what it meant to them
[1:53:36] now if they heard the priest sound the
[1:53:38] trumpet he says the minister the trumpet
[1:53:40] is the gospel and when they hear it and
[1:53:41] they know what it means and they know
[1:53:43] that that's their inheritance no matter
[1:53:45] where they'd lost how far they went back
[1:53:48] whatever they had to do they had the
[1:53:51] privilege to come and receive again
[1:53:52] their their inheritance the whole family
[1:53:55] could come and receive their inheritance
[1:53:59] so it is tonight that men and women that
[1:54:01] knows the things that we do know and
[1:54:03] have heard from our brother in different
[1:54:05] ones of our Pentecostal experience of
[1:54:06] years ago and he says we find that we
[1:54:09] have walled
[1:54:10] or if we haven't walled ourselves away
[1:54:12] from it so far that we got to hear what
[1:54:14] somebody says instead of what thus saith
[1:54:16] the Lord is what is he says you started
[1:54:18] listening to sermons instead of thus
[1:54:20] saith the Lord
[1:54:21] and can hear what the word of God has
[1:54:23] got to say about it now is the hour of
[1:54:25] Jubilee to come back to your original
[1:54:27] inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again
[1:54:32] again
[1:54:34] he didn't say come to a real Holy Ghost
[1:54:35] for the first time he says come again to
[1:54:37] it come back to it you've been pulled
[1:54:40] away from it now come back to it it's
[1:54:41] available again
[1:54:43] remember he could go free didn't have to
[1:54:46] pay nothing didn't have to do nothing
[1:54:47] just get up and go and that's all he had
[1:54:49] to do go back if he knew the sound of
[1:54:51] the trumpet but he had to know the sound
[1:54:53] of the trumpet sea for they were sons of
[1:54:56] God trumpet was only for the seat of
[1:54:59] Abraham remember that's the only thing
[1:55:00] that made any sense to
[1:55:02] didn't mean anything to the Gentiles
[1:55:04] didn't mean that the slaves that they
[1:55:05] brought in from the enemies that they
[1:55:07] defeated or bought in another slave
[1:55:08] market it only meant something to those
[1:55:10] that were born free in the first place
[1:55:13] you know what's sad about this
[1:55:15] about this Year of Jubilee
[1:55:19] it's about the only Grace you find built
[1:55:21] into the law
[1:55:23] and they stop doing it
[1:55:25] they stopped blowing the trumpet
[1:55:28] when they had that issue where they CA
[1:55:30] you know the Gad and uh Manasseh have to
[1:55:34] try manasse and what not went out of the
[1:55:35] land they stopped doing it they said
[1:55:36] because we're not all where we're
[1:55:37] supposed to be then this doesn't apply
[1:55:40] anymore
[1:55:40] and then when the kings came in all of a
[1:55:43] sudden they're not under ministerial
[1:55:44] rule they're under King rule so they
[1:55:46] said we don't have to do that either and
[1:55:48] so they pulled Grace right out of the
[1:55:49] law
[1:55:50] so all of a sudden property could change
[1:55:52] hands now now people couldn't be freed
[1:55:54] from debt now people were being bound
[1:55:56] and then in the end you'll see it and
[1:55:58] we'll cover it in the next service where
[1:56:00] God judged them for it he says you've
[1:56:01] got to go for 70 years
[1:56:03] because you missed 490 years that you
[1:56:07] were supposed to be doing this
[1:56:09] you're doing this for years and years
[1:56:11] and years and you never sounded to
[1:56:12] Jubilee trumpet you bound yourselves you
[1:56:14] bound your own people
[1:56:16] he says and now I'm going to bind you
[1:56:18] because of what you did you took Grace
[1:56:20] out of the law he says and now you've
[1:56:21] got to pay a price for it
[1:56:23] listen that might have stopped back then
[1:56:26] but when Christ came he blew the Jubilee
[1:56:28] trumpet and ever since then he's been
[1:56:30] blowing it guess what you don't have to
[1:56:32] wait every seven years to hear the
[1:56:33] Jubilee trumpet
[1:56:35] it's blowing every service we're here
[1:56:37] it's blowing every time you open your
[1:56:38] Bible it's blown every time you turn on
[1:56:40] a message tape every service you stream
[1:56:42] online whatever it is that gospel
[1:56:44] trumpet is blowing day in and day out
[1:56:46] because it's time for us to go home and
[1:56:49] he's trying to free us he's trying to
[1:56:51] freeze he's trying to let get us to let
[1:56:53] go let go of what we've got inside let
[1:56:56] go of what our families got let go of
[1:56:57] our complexes let go of our hearts let
[1:57:00] go of our offenses let go of the draws
[1:57:02] of the world and come into the good
[1:57:03] things that God has for us amen he's got
[1:57:05] an inheritance there and brother Bram
[1:57:07] says it's the sons of God it's the
[1:57:09] daughters of God that hear the trumpet
[1:57:10] because it means something to them and
[1:57:12] they know that there's something that's
[1:57:14] waiting for you brother Graham said thus
[1:57:16] saith the Lord is what's come and it's
[1:57:18] blowing a freedom trumpet
[1:57:20] amen
[1:57:22] what's it doing
[1:57:23] it's removing our spiritual amnesia
[1:57:26] I remember a funny story I think it was
[1:57:29] Billy Paul might have been Brother
[1:57:31] Joseph Branham
[1:57:32] and they share books with friends you
[1:57:34] know in different ones and they gave a
[1:57:36] message uh to it to one man and they
[1:57:41] they gave the same message to a couple
[1:57:42] different people and one man came back
[1:57:44] and he kind of shook it in their face
[1:57:45] and he said this man called me a buzzard
[1:57:50] foreign
[1:57:51] Billy Paul said that's funny because he
[1:57:53] called me an eagle
[1:57:55] and the same message why because the
[1:57:57] trumpet meant one thing to one and
[1:57:58] didn't mean anything to the other and so
[1:58:00] he was what he was judged by it he was
[1:58:01] condemned by it but if you're sitting
[1:58:03] here and you're under the preaching of
[1:58:04] the word and it means something to you
[1:58:05] what does it mean it means he's calling
[1:58:07] you to go free amen let's Stand Together
[1:58:11] where we're going next time
[1:58:13] we're going to what people sorry just
[1:58:14] turned that back brother vaishal I got
[1:58:16] one more
[1:58:18] the next service I don't want to you
[1:58:20] know what's a bit tough to preach on
[1:58:21] real experience before that's what we're
[1:58:23] going to talk about in the next service
[1:58:24] amen they stop blowing the trumpet and
[1:58:26] then Christ comes along and says the
[1:58:28] trumpet's going to blow and it's going
[1:58:29] to blow and blow and blow until every
[1:58:31] son and daughter of God hears it and
[1:58:33] comes back to where they're supposed to
[1:58:34] be amen let's bow our heads together
[1:58:37] Heavenly Father
[1:58:39] Lord I know it's words of warning
[1:58:41] tonight Lord not the funnest thing to
[1:58:43] preach for sure
[1:58:44] but Lord I know I can look at my own
[1:58:46] life and see areas where Lord I'm not
[1:58:48] where I need to be
[1:58:50] Lord and as I get older lord it's not so
[1:58:53] much maybe what we're doing Lord in
[1:58:55] terms of the things of the world and
[1:58:56] whatnot Lord but its attitudes we take
[1:58:58] Lord its reactions we have it's thoughts
[1:59:01] that we have it's Lord and unwillingness
[1:59:03] to to bend or bow Lord It's a Lord it
[1:59:07] can be judgmental even at times but Lord
[1:59:09] we want to have the nature of Christ and
[1:59:11] all of these things Heavenly Father Lord
[1:59:13] that your spirit would have a free reign
[1:59:15] that we'd not be looking Lord to to set
[1:59:18] up an image of ourselves or Lord a
[1:59:20] facade of spirituality but Lord that we
[1:59:23] would be soft and tender towards the
[1:59:24] moving of the spirit Lord that we'd be
[1:59:27] quick to heed it or that we be quick to
[1:59:29] Humble ourselves Lord that we'd be quick
[1:59:32] to repent ourselves Lord of where we
[1:59:34] fail so often
[1:59:35] Lord so I pray you Minister Lord you
[1:59:38] know what each heart has hold has a need
[1:59:40] of this evening Lord Lord you know where
[1:59:42] Satan's got his hooks into US Lord you
[1:59:44] know where maybe there's doors we don't
[1:59:46] want to open up too much
[1:59:47] and Lord you see into my life and you
[1:59:49] see my struggles Lord I pray you
[1:59:51] minister to me Lord I pray for the young
[1:59:54] people here Lord they face more I
[1:59:56] believe than any generation before has
[1:59:58] has ever done it Lord Lord and your
[2:00:01] prophets that every generation has its
[2:00:02] Revival
[2:00:03] Lord and we love that and we believe it
[2:00:05] Lord but that means every generation
[2:00:07] also have its repentance Lord that
[2:00:09] they've got to have the humbling to the
[2:00:11] word to go with that Revival Lord so I
[2:00:13] lift up our young people Lord I pray you
[2:00:15] give them Victory every day that they
[2:00:17] would see the the tricks and the
[2:00:19] influences of Satan in their lives Lord
[2:00:21] for the young parents Lord and the young
[2:00:23] married couples Lord even the young the
[2:00:25] the unmarried amongst the sword each one
[2:00:27] Lord may you lead us and guide us and
[2:00:29] Lord for the elders Among Us Lord may
[2:00:31] they help to show us the way by the Holy
[2:00:33] Spirit Lord not just by word but indeed
