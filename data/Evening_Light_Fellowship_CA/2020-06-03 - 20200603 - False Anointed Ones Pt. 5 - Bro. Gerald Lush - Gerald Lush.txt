are present amen and we pray that that the Lord is here with us that he with you is with me amen just think a man yeah if they made him a Trinity because because of father son Holy Ghost what would they make him if he knew that he was in all of us a man that that I'm the son yeah there did his daughters and so on you're his sons and so on so praise the name of the Lord so thank God for the revelation of God thank God for the personal experience with God amen to God be the glory so the Lord bless and go ahead to see our brother Chad I'm glad to see him we're here amen and our brother Joshua Lord bless your brother amen and or praying grace to brother Annika and sister Rebekah of the family and the Lord blessed them that maybe we'll have some fellowship with him for too long but I'm praying that his brother Bob mentioned praying the grace of God well according to the will of God to change the circumstances situation so we can get everybody back in the church again a man and when we know what we know the promise is where two or three are gathered together there am I in the midst and again in the original it is where I have gathered two or three is not where two or three decided on themselves but where he gathered them and there he is in the midst a man praise the Lord so we're trusting easier with the few of us that have gathered tonight a man so the Lord be with us and again praying Lord according to your will regard what's going on regardless of what's called regarding what's going on I have talked to the Lord about it why had the Lord permitted this why did the Lord permit that well the Lord told me I want explain at all but the Lord did remind me says son he said you were thinking on these things and you've taught thought on it before concerning well how is this going to happen how is that going to happen how is this prophecy going to be fulfilled considering that what the world is like considering what all the nations are like and considering what all the people are like Lord this is going to happen I understand wants to explain what it was not on maybe in private sometime but and the Lord said well son now you see now you know that why I'm allowing this is what for is to bring the people into into that into that attitude and so on bring them under that influence and not only the people but the nations a man so he's going to bring in the nations all down on the same level as it were so that he there's other things that in Scripture that II that he will fulfill the prophecy that he will bring the pass and brother for it to happen these things had got to be going on in the world oh yes this guy is he's got to so I said yes Lord thank you I said I was wondering how you were going to do it now I know how you're gonna do it by what by it's God permitting this exactly and again that's why that's why that there's a reason why we find that there's there's the true anointed ones out of what the BIOS be self also minded once because certainly in the last days and the prophet of God said the anointing is not false he said the teaching is and and again why would God permit that under under a true anointing and yet the teacher be false it's for a reason God permits it all for a reason brother God knows what he's doing again don't wonder he said in Isaiah ibly 55 he said my thoughts are not yours and he said my ways are not yours and he says I as the heavens are above the earth so are my ways and my thoughts above yours and that is the absolute truth brother we just got to believe God is looking for us to believe not to understand this understand that but to be leave it a man what God has spoken in his in his word and what God is doing how God is doing it why would God permit this why would God permit that is for a reason amen and again not my will that I be done a man so listen listen believe it brother and again Lord we would we would love to get the church all back again it's true it's frustrating for the ministry and no doubt it's frustrating for the people to have to endure these things and we pray the grace of God to the to the ministry and brethren around the world that's got to endure this and it's hard especially some that AB churches and used to churches of two three four five hundred people and now the only ministry to ten people in the church or maybe a few people in the church so brother I pray the grace of God be with those ministering brother amen and the grace of God be with us that will endure a man to endure on to the end and and I believe although this is going to happen don't worry they don't know don't think you know that we won't blame the devil God permitted it and when it comes to the prophesy concerning the false Christ and so on why did God for it false Christ a true anointing but a false teaching for a reason it's all for a reason a man so we leave all that with the Lord so the grace of God be with us brother as we go again into the word and we pray that the Lord will have his way the will of God be done and mother I pray God that he administered through the ministry if he's only got a few in the in the congregation your ministers through the ministry and not only that by those that are hearing the word will receive it the way God wants them to receive it a man then we were to receive what God has got there for you by the grace of God a man so I listen faith comes by hearing hearing by the word a man so you want faith you got to hear the word and don't hear it in your head it in your heart by the grace of God you've got to hear the spiritual revelation that Evan but at the near not ears then in that Anthony or hear what the Spirit is saying to the church by the grace of God so brother there's many hairiness by their ears but how many is going to hear it to hear the word by their a year in the heart God's grace to us a man so let's be in prayer for one another for sure and again the world is in a very terrible condition it's very stressful right now for the world for the government's for leaders concerning not only concerning the pandemic but to those of us who are aware of what was going on and what is going on in the states concerning racism and again rather it shows again oh my God have mercy on us the devil is in control of the world he is the god of this world we need to be in prayer for one another first no doubt there are believers around where all this is going on and it's not only going on of course in the United States or other parts of the world and and there was a certain issue that took place in Canada not sure was last night or this morning a man and and to deal with police and now they were treating somebody that they were arresting and so on and knowing that what happened in the States was found on video and what happened in Canada also was on video a man of our policemen was treating somebody that they were endeavoring to arrest so rather God had mercy on us and God help us to stay with the word a man and this list being prayer for one another you know and pray the grace of God to family friends and neighbors that's right you don't know what they're going through we pray grace a man well we're enduring this we're in doing that but what our other believers enduring in different parts of the world grace grace grace brother sister is serious I won't say where it happened in Canada but it it was it was serious so water will out will come out I don't know but we pray the lord help us that we're going to endure on to the end this is just just an indication of what believers got to endure he done didn't do earth under the end the same shall be saved amen grace take your state move on more bless you let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe brother sister

according to the will of God thank you lord Alleluia question no wonder jesus said believe us thou this a man do we believe the scripture in Isaiah do we believe that with His stripes we were healed the grace of God amen turn with me to 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 2nd Corinthians 11 and we may have already read this scripture in a previous message but we read it again and there's a couple of other scriptures and then we want to get down to the scriptures that I referenced on Sunday concerning Isaiah and Ezekiel and in in 2nd Corinthians 11 and verse 12 and he said but what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion yeah those are looking for attention he's I desire occasion some attention he said from them which desire attention or occasion he said that we're in the glory and there are those that are looking for attention again they're numbered with those that Jesus referred to that there's going to come false Christ's and false prophets in the last days and be so deceiving he said it would deceive the very elect if possible that's how bad it's going to be and that's so close to the real that's going to be a mayor but the grace of God II with us that we not be to see but Paul is highlighting it here in the first stage and warning us down through the ages concerning that spirit for such he said are false apostles looking for attention and he saw they are deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ this is amazing see we got to be on our guard a man it is so close again let me remind you it is so close it would deceive the very elect impossible a man but we are going to stay with the word it is written and it's cool we will leave it the way that God wants us to leave it and again as the father said don't add to it don't take from it and only that he said leave it the way that it is he said don't make it bigger than what it is don't make it smaller than what it is but again these false annoyed and once false Christ's they're going to be preaching Christ they're going to be preaching the word and saying this is saying that but to an extent they're there they're going to make it bigger than what it is smaller than what it is a man or they're going to add a word or take away a word and still leave you with the impression that it is the truth but brother we got to leave it the way that God said it a man and God doesn't want me to add to it God doesn't want you to add to it a man God wants us to believe it a man as he said to Martha so God says to us believe us now this a man the way that he said it a man the way that he meant it do we believe it that way oh yes but but no he didn't want any buts he didn't want us to hate this to it or aid that tour taking us away or that away leave it the way that he said at Martha leave her that it would the way that he said it as we as the Bride of Christ a man withers a man where's the Prophet a man whether whether some other ministry leave her the way that God has said it a man but again the false anointed ones are there sometimes who to impress you by thinking that you're going to make it bigger than what it is you're going to do this you're going to do that me and they make it make you believe that whether the problem in this or the Bible in this when it didn't no no leave it the way that God said it amen but again the false one other ones are there to impress impress the people and to get attention so the grace of God be with us brother amen and he said for such are false apostles deceitful workers a mayor and it says they're transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ amen oh yeah they want they want to lay it out in such a way minister in such a way give the word in such a way it what do you want to leave the impression that there really should seer want only the impression that what they're saying is are really really the Lord and well yeah remember again it's going to be they're going to have that true brother Brown said it's not a false when it comes to a false anointing the true ninety but he says when it comes to their true false Christ a man what is Christ is the Anointed One so they do have the anointing a man but he should go on further but he should their teaching is false a man is not exactly they don't stay with the word a man well you got if you're a true of ninety one you're gonna stay with the word a man and he said they are transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ just think that's how deceiving and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light just think the devil is transformed into an angel of light and what I want to bring out we get into the scriptures again and get into some other thoughts is to let you know that this Justin is not just in the end time in the last days it's worse than the last days but it's been here all down through time and where they come from it come from eternity and we want to show you it come from eternity amen Israel is dealt with it and the Gentile church has dealt with it and now it's even more deceiving in the last days so no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel light and therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works god bless his words you may be seated and turn with me to second Peter we did read 2nd Peter chapter 1 we want to go to 2nd Peter chapter 2 thank God for the word amen no matter what the issue no matter what the problems matter what the need whether God gives us understanding in the word praise the Lord have the faith of God in 2nd Peter chapter 2 and verse 1 but they were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you they're false teachers then we got false teachers now a man because we're in the end the most deceiving of all ages and even as there shall be false teachers among you he said who privately shall bring in damnable heresies a man even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction this is a deceiving hour a man when we are facing this deception a man that's so close they would deceive the very elect if possible thank God for the grace of his elect amen the grace in your life the grace in my life to help us that will not be deceived a man no matter what comes no matter how close it is that God is going to give us the rote wisdom we need the revelation we need the understanding ready that will not be deceived a man but yet there's many today that are deceived coming soon there's gonna be such a deception a great deception to the extent that the prophet of God said there might be five hundred going living Saints they go into rapture five hundred living Saints why not all the others that are around the message if there's two or three or four million around this message I'll come only five hundred another time he said three hundred another time he said when that sister asked a Dave God asked her to pick out you know the Bride of Christ whatever he said I might find that doesn't he he was he was afraid that God would ask him to do that he said I might get a dozen a man so brother had made the brother if we've heard that quote then we know what the prophet has said brother it ought to put us on our guard it'll put us on our toes amen because certainly what we believe because running what we are hearing with not a not only behind this pulpit maybe there's other things you might be hearing online so where we need to be on our toes and on our guard and I just say well yeah I like this I like that I like this letter to make sure that it's ordained of God for this hour for this age it's ordained for the bride to give or watch this ordain to do and what is her thing to do give us right through faith a man it's not just this doctrine that doctrine that doctrine or that that's fine that's good praise the Lord but brother the overall revelation is to give us the revelation of the rapture it is the giver of the revelation of wraps repaint a man even the mystery of the Obi of the seven seals the prophet of God said well what's your day to do why did God do this why did God do that why is God to be doing this he says to give us rap free faith a man this is absolutely amazing because there's so much in the open of the word there's so much of the revelation of the seals there's so much concerning the mystery of God and revelation 10 and other scriptures a man and brother the ministry that is highlighting this and the right letting that and they're preaching this and the preaching that but brother we got to come back to what God wants us to minister on we got to come back to what God wants us to get to the people and that is resurrection and wrap through faith a man Luther focused on non justification justification just think well woody we feel like back there well we feel like in Luther's day or Wesley's day a man though there is that all you're going to breach and he preaches justification anyway when he went no doubt he went through the Old Testament and he preached justification justification and Wesley sanctification sanctification Amen brother there wasn't the gifts of the Spirit it wasn't this doctrine of that doctrine this is this and this no it was just on what God wanted them to focus on that's what that's what I they lure was hungry for that's what Wesley was hungry for a million and when they got it praise the Lord when they got it brother they they they were worshiping God they they preached it preached it preached the plates it a man a man praise the name of the Lord and again but they were they called out and got the attention of all the elect of God in their day and in their age and even who the Pentecostals amen but the thing of it is but when God wanted to go on they are made a denomination withers in Luther withers him wrestling with the Pentecostals and others oh they are they got caught up with is to the extent that a way was out of their hearts and it was in their heads amen it wasn't a revelation out of the heart after a while it what it was with Lutheran and three or four generations and Wesley and three or four generations the Pentecostals and the same thing but after the third generation they they be just it just went out of the heart and into the head amen they believed Joseph ocation in their heads they believed sanctification in their head they believed a man the the baptism of the Holy goes when the gifts but it was in their heads a man and the fewer and fewer and fewer had revelation in their hearts amen so that it was well the revelation the heart a man you're born again a man you're a new creature in Christ a man it controls your life it controls your thoughts it controls your spirit it controls your actions and reactions a man but for the most of them they got into a denomination and he just got into the letter of the word the letter of the message that they had a man but they lost the spiritual experience a man so brother/sister the grace of God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we're not going to we're not going to get out of the revelation of spiritual revelation the message and into the intellectual revelation amen there again many have gone even around the message they have gone from the spiritual revelation of Malachi 4 and what God has done what God is doing and they're getting into the end of the letter of it amen oh yeah they got the letter of the middle of the mystery of the seven seals the mystery of God and Malachi 4 it's all the letter God said God said God said you know the Bible says the boy who says but again it's out of their heads but not out of their hearts and then and the longer that time goes on the more and more of their of another generation another generation another generation and he get more and more intellectual a man unless unless a man sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen they're going by the letter of the word but not the spirit of the word that remind you again of what the Prophet is saying and I believe it's in the message the anointing was at the end time and he said he said now he said you are in the message you say you're in the message but he said the message is not in you and that is the truth and that's something I witnessed for many years there's what I say even when I first came to the message a man and like I said that's why I preached it the way that I preached that first sermon amen and and I appreciate other people in a in a church but I do amen and I was just a young man but brother coming out of Pentecost and into the word at a Pentecost into the message a man for the experience that I hated Pentecost and the experience that I was occurring in the message I knew that many of those that I was meeting that so called oh yeah I'm a believer on a believer and I said Lord I said they're not believers I said they don't have no experience and why because why because they are in the message but the message he said is not a you a man and just saying what I what I was experiencing the Prophet already experienced and preached about a man I was experiencing whether alive William Branham was experiencing I was I was catching the revelation when umbrella was catching a man and it wasn't wasn't what wasn't very long after this that I came into the word that I came into the message amen and brother I began to realize the truth they were in the message but the message was not in them and not only that brother some years later when one of the Brethren a man God rest his soul and he was into a senior's old and he met a he met a senior citizen there and that person was yeah it was a retired Pentecostal pastor and they got to talking about the word and an about the message and the pastor said and he said brother he said I'm not denying what William Branham said and he said it was a tremendous word a tremendous message but he said I've got to admit he said they said that those who profess to believe it he said are just not living it you know he said those that are profession to believe it he said they're just not reflecting it he said the way that William Branham preached it amen and just saying that was a Pentecostal brother that was a former Benegal so pastor and I know though that he has gone on I pray God rest his soul because he was seeing the truth a man he was acknowledging the truth of the revealed word but acknowledging also a man that many of those that he that he admit that profess to be believers he knew that they were not reflecting the message they they added intellectually in their heads but they never had it in their hearts amen and brother sister and I have made note of this some years ago because when I came to this word this message and I contacted the voice of God and I said would you give me the names and addresses of certain individuals I said that are receiving message books I said here in Newfoundland and I didn't ask for just believers anybody everybody but just certain individuals and and well I bet I'll let you know it was Pentecostal pastors I see do our pastors on the list and they said yes brother there's the number of pastors on the list and they sent me the names and addresses of those pastors amen and oh yeah so I said old my I'm going to contact them and I'm gonna go to give them a certain booklet that I had and so on and let them know this let them know that amen and brother not many responded but if you did yeah and I'll be honest brother one thing that they came back with was the same thing that I was experiencing when I come to the others that were professing to believe this message amen because they realized too that a man that the believers who were saying we believe when Amanda was a prophet we believe that God did this we believe that God did that God said this God say that a man and they knew they felt within themselves they were talking it but they weren't living it Amen so brother sister let's not just talk the message let's live the message amen listen I just go and talk the message let's go ahead and reflect the message in there in our thoughts in our words and our deeds in our actions and in our reactions a man and brother to keep your attitude right in your spirit right a man because their attitude and their spirit was wrong years ago and many of leavers still got the wrong attitude a wrong spirit now a man looking down at those out there looking down at that one looking at less don't look down at nobody it's the grace of God to me it's the grace of God to them a man and again just singing again as there's a part of God was where when when when he was looking at that woman and he was criticizing the woman because of the way she was dressed a man and the Lord came down and the Lord rebuke Commission and told him it says don't you do that and it says who yukkin yukkin yukkin condemn and you can criticize what she's wearing and how she's dressed but don't you condemn her he said why because he says some of them are my children a man this is absolutely amazing who had we met over there that any that it's that it's the children of God who having been are there that are the feet of God not necessarily the bride no and let me remind you again the part of God said we're not going to reach everyone with this message amen but only the elect we're going to reach the brain we're going to reach all the elect with this message but brother whenever when it comes to the others the the foolish virgins brother they're not ordained to be part of the bride they're not going to be there no brothers oh they will at the a in the end as the Bible says the rest of the Dead lived not again for a thousand years but they're coming back and brother they're given white robes amen the others are put into the lid their time in the lake of fire and so on but the others are given way robes a man those that are going to live outside the city so God help us to keep our head attitude right to keep the balance when it come to the Word of God amen brother we're going to condemn the false teachings and the false doctrines and and people you're worshiping you know the churches and denominations amen but brother we're not going to condemn the people no siree no way because you and I were part of that amen brother sister ahead and of course not the younger ones here but again the older one we were we were part of it a man and when it comes to all the older ones here in the assembly you've been part of the Catholic Church where you were probably the worst of it a man you're part of the thing that all the others came out of your part you were part of what the devil started amen that's right there was the first organized religion in the world was the Roman Catholic Church amen so and think oh thank God God began to deal with that year after year after year there came Luther they came West way they came this one and that one amen to finally in the last days oh well praise the Lord we came out of all of them amen so keep her attitude raking our spirit right by the grace of Almighty God a man and brother we're not going there we're not going to condemn even those that we believe to be false prophets and false this and Paul said oh there they they got false and they're there they're false anointed once during 90 a men and that and the anointing is genuine because he promises see it's a false Christ and he said well as the false Christ at 91 and it's a true anointed one he said but he said they're teaching his false the United State and it causes them to be identified with what you and I identify with a man but when when they get into it the life and their preaching this and teaching this he said they're going to add here add a word there take away a word and so on her brother the bride is gonna stay with it not add to it not take from it but believe it in simplicity amen and again this brother that God never did it did they did this where the purpose of getting us caught up with with this doctor caught up with that doctor cut up here cut up there and it's become a crate to an auto believers this doctrine this doctor it's just a crate I believe this I believe this I believe that brothers sisters will thank God praise the Lord just let's believe it and move on to the resurrection this will even and move on to the rapture amen so brothers for their guard wherewith they will be proven that God is accomplishing in you and me what he's ordained to do through the prophet of Malachi 4 ain't bad brothers not to call us out and just give us these doctrines is to call us out so God can take us in a man brother sister again is like God bringing issue out of Asia not to go into the wilderness but to go into the promised land a man what was Joshua Seeley what was Caleb feeling what do they feel like amen and when they when they were forced and and they couldn't go into the Promised Land they couldn't go possessive because the majority didn't want anything to do with it oh no no we can't do it we can't do it we can't do it amen but still joy had never gone to us they were going to kill Joshua and Caleb they're going to kill Moses oh yeah they're going to stone them because they took their stand and it was Caleb said listen if God be for us who can be against us amen so brother sister the grace of God in this hour this agent brothers history of his God let's believe God linaria if it's God let's trust God amen let's say the faith that God wants us to have and brother brother without faith it's impossible to please God hey my brother but it's got to be the faith he's gotta be the faith he wants you to have a million brothers not just nor Luther head not just well Wesley aid the Pentecostal said amen and then it goes beyond even the obeah the seven seals the revelation of the mystery of God brother there is to be a faith in it that we are to receive of the rapture the resurrection get out of here but I'll tell you there's not many who want to get out they don't have they don't know they don't have that same anointing they don't have that same hunger and thirst that Joshua and Caleb had outside the outside the said the promised land no no but even so just content with doctrine and I'm a believer I'm a believer on believer again during the message during the message there in the message I know I died today but the message is not in them if the message was in them then God would be in them to take them up to take them in the resurrection taken in the rapture it's just not coming out of the denomination any man but and it's not just saying well I'm a believer so you know as her brother I'll act like this and dress like this as a sister I'll act like this and dress like that amen well that's good but let's go on let's go at increase our faith a man sure God gave you their faith and you acted on it and you were baptizing in his name God gave you their faith and you acted on earth says well I believe I believe I believe this doctrine there dr. surd see I I believe in the oneness of God I believe with the baptism in his name and so on yeah praise the Lord but how many are believing for the resurrection how many are believing in the rapture there's so little emphasis being put on it and there's only there's so little revelation because you go there that the people are being caught up with into a resurrection and into the rapture this is what God is doing a man and he's not just getting us a denomination and into the message to believe the doctrines a million sure it's like that's all part of it but we got to grow and mature in the faith to what till it pleases God what faith pleases God it's not just saying well I I believe that serpent seed I believe in the water baptism I believe in the oneness of the Guardian I believe this doctrine that doctrine I believe that brothers should read dress like this and act like this I believe that sister should dress like this and act like that that's just good but you gotta get ready to your faith go on go on well Lord what is it you want me to believe now I want you to get out of here now amen I got you out of Egypt now once you get you into the promised land Oh Lord we can't go in there we can't do this we can't do that but I've already done it for you God God said I've given it for you amen that's what Joshua Taylor and especially Kennedy know if God be for us who can be against us why God gave the parents every place to soldier put your trade he are giving you a man brother Broly lujah God's give us a revelation of justification sanctification the benches of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit God had given us a revelation of the Trinity and yeah the oneness of the Godhead not Trinity wonders of the gaudy and serpent seed and all of these things and regional sin we know this we know that amen we believe this we believe that anybody and then then God's us what would the rapture what well I believe in the rapture yeah but I want you to good go into rapture I want you to be raptured I want you to bring forth the dead amen Jesus a sense to decide the tomb of Lazarus Lazarus come forth before Easter before he said that he said we will remove the stone remove the show hey man that was the confession of death charge they were concerned he was dead sure they put the stone there we're gonna leave it there yeah he should take the stone away what he's dead he's been gone for days but Jesus said he's not dead he's asleep amen he's doing I got to go awake him praise the Lord you type of God is simplicity that is Guardian simplicity brother amen for him to come out to a grave at 2:00 and everybody else was you know they they they felt bad your and Mary felt bad and man Martha felt bad they said Oh Lord if you were very if you were here he wouldn't have died will he come to wake him see do we see as God sees they didn't see it as God saw it God saw somebody sleeping did Jesus he was asleep to the rest he was dead a man and they were afraid to go near the tomb you know they pulled the stone away maybe he's he starting to decay and maybe you know his body is stinking and so on Jesus wasn't didn't might better bother Jesus that's like I said when Jesus when did the Bible says Jesus wept he wasn't crying for Lazarus he was gonna wake him no siree he wasn't crying because Lazarus dead but why would he cry for death when he said I am the resurrection and the life amen he told her to save us you know and when they RT was sick and you know well and jesus knew what was going to happen if Jesus wanted to he could went back and touch them and healed him he wouldn't died but he didn't do that anybody he wanted Ellen oh yeah he wanted to reveal the revelation of who he was what we mean who he was the resurrection do you want to prove it he was gonna prove it to the people see there were that excuse there without his clothes are we without excuse concerning what God has done and what God is doing in this day an hour amen so brother he went on he didn't go he waited to Lazarus died then he shall we'll go back oh you should have come before matters not to him he would've healed him sure but now he's gonna raise him that's healing that's absolute complete evening and his that's why they're proud of God said if you can't believe for healy now can you believe for the rapture god help us any man don't don't listen to the devil listen to God if I believe in the devil is believing God a man is not believing that ever oh yeah yeah yeah God said that ever were quote that Amen that's right brothers sister even in the anointing was at the end time they're false false Christ amen they'll quote the word they'll preach the word they'll go on and on and on you think Lord they're preaching the word to preaching the word but again they did it's gonna be so deceiving that they'll add a word take away a word and believers are gonna want still believe in it still believing that all you think that we think is all out there no no it's around the message yeah and there was they'll believe this believe that amen you'll make a denomination out of it oh yeah and then there's many and there's many denominations around this message now round the world so brothers sisters now it's not interpreting what God said it's believing what God said hey man but many feel they got to interpret we don't have to interpret nothing brother the problem of God he did the interpretation there probably got laid out laid over the word and lady in this and lady in that lady there a man and we believe the problem we believe it is read we believe thus saith the Lord amen so if we believe it a man its ordained to give us the faith that pleases God Amen hello God's looking for me to have faith to believe this doctrine faith to believe that doctor faith of young people go on with that but why don't the resurrection rapture what about the healing of your body yeah god I see God by grace is healed our souls and he's raptured our souls he's resurrected our souls what about your body because you as they quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses quicken what do you mean may alive you a raptured cut up to Emily place in Christ now you know I've said it so many times the proud of God so what what what's going on up there if we're caught up to a heavenly place in Christ what's going on there he said he said the words being revealed any man to give us greater and greater faith but for for the actual change of our bodies for the actual resurrection of the Dead that are gone on amen and the change of the living Saints that are that are moving on to a rapture by the grace of God amen again like I feel to say it again as I said when I shocked that church do two or three hundred people there for sure and then when I shocked them to the point that they all got silent quiet because I said I've been resurrected and I've been raptured they were shocked her eyes were popping oh yeah and even their pastors eyes and he was turning around looking looking at the congregation and shaking disease did not believing that I was resurrected now their area that I was raptured yeah today were they felt oh well he's not resurrected he's not rad shirt Loki's BR in the pulpit yeah but I gave him the scripture I've been quickened I was dead in sin you were dead and seeing you have been quicken your as he resurrected spiritually hey man hey man hallelujah and now he said I've been caught up into a heavenly place in Christ hey man what for all praise the Lord so that will go on and move on in a faith but for for the for the physical resurrection for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God god help us amen God all this whether brother what faith do we have tonight what faith is there around the message tonight is it is it just there on that level of doctrine and this doctrine that doctrinal we believe this or private or this the Prophet SAW that he taught this he taught that Amen well that's good but it's the stakes on to a greater faith a man I've been quickened I've been raptured I've been caught up into a heavenly place and the word is revealed to give me a greater and a greater and a greater faith to please God Amen for the resurrection for the rapture and again the dead are waiting on us and God is waiting on us brother we think God's going to do this God's going to do that know my God have mercy lord have mercy lord help us to have the right revelation that will produce in us right thoughts a man the right thoughts that we're going to think as we ought to think concerning who we are concerning what God is looking for in us concerning what God is expecting out of me and out of you is God a man is God pleased with your your your experience are you in fellowship with God yeah there's a dozen I don't know if there's an hour but through the day that that I that I would go without without talking to the Lord without calling on the name the Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ yeah as our brother Chad as mentioned concern he is driving the in his truck and so on and meditating and thinking about the Lord and praying and so on oh yeah if you're in the spirit you can't get out this it's you're in the spirit the Spirit is in you there's a oneness that day you'll know that I mean this he said I mean the father the father me I in you and you and me table oneness how can you how can you not think about the Lord how can you go you know so long and nothing about Jesus Amen that the public board brother he had that anointing to the extent that when he went on haunting all my or my hunting well he was out there in the wilderness what was he thinking about all he was thinking but I was launching this and hunting dad did looking for this animal that animal maybe looking for a fish out there and and then in water somewhere ya know he looked no matter where he look what he did is Jesus oh he looked and he said he started to scream he saw though he saw the trees he saw this and he started to scream and he said I ran around the trees I ran here screaming and praising the Lord and shouting amen and here he wasn't out there for her for a rest to get away from this and away from that but he didn't get away from the Lord anybody there are those that brother when they get away from church to get away from God that's right when they go through the door they need God behind them that's the truth but a brother but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Jesus say concerning the power in the anointing and in your experience with them he said yeah I mean I mean the father and father and me I in you and you and me there's an absolute oneness a main and if we got that wellness there brother we're going to have the faith that Jesus said amen we're gonna have the same attitude that Jesus said 'we'll had to say where did Jesus said hey bad that we're not here to do our will where to do God's will hey man hey man Jesus came and like I said he knew he knew where he come from I knew where he was going when he knew I was gonna get there a man but he was longer to get there how many many believers are longing to get out of here and into the rapture how many are longing to get out of here and into the marriage supper of the Lamb how many I tell you they're more caught up with this old world than they are with the with the world to come there are more Carlo with this world than they are with the resurrection in the rapture you're more tired with the people of this world and they got to do this they're gonna do this they got to look after this one and that one and so on wait a minute what are those that are gone on and they're waiting on us see there I believe the closer we get to it the more of more sensitive we're going to get to that other dimension of the dead in Christ they're not in the graveyard during Christ amen brother I caught helped us to be more sensitive they approved the faith that I have proved the faith that you got as I say go through the day and you in the name of the Lord God bless us god help us Lord Jesus I need you Lord give us your wisdom give us your strength your encouragement Lord we need it oh yeah I'm going through the day morning noon and night just talking to the Lord praying when I wake in the morning can't get it out of my heart mind you know lord help me a man grace you're so good brother sister I'll tell you that oh no I won't say that hey man get all the church together amen oh yes no no cuz just say oh brother Drew was condemning me no I'll leave that with the Lord to convict brother if we got the Holy Ghost she's there to convict us to do what's right here we got the Holy Ghost here to connect us to stay in line with the will of God amen what does good what me to do what does God want you to do again as I said when where and how and so on brother let let God be in control of your life amen and that you're here tonight because of the conviction of the Holy Ghost you're here tonight and those that are on line hearing the Word of God by the conviction of the Holy Ghost amen brother we we got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to convict us to line up with the word Amen that's dress the truth praise the name of the Lord and I guess the Lord was working on using brother Matthew to work on that conviction to see if you would come tonight amen so brother see how serious it is God in control I tell you it's not just coming out of a church and into another one not coming out of one doctrine into another one it's moving on in the in the in that teaching where we know only that revelation what for to get to the faith that God wants you to have hey man amen brother and again as I said down through the ages state they moved from one age to another one revelation to another amen but there was a test of faith when brother when they were in one age and God came with a messenger and revealed something else amen oh well I know I believe this I believe that all day in Luther's day I we believe justification yeah yeah but there's more to it than that Owen II went under Saint oh yeah we lay justifications ratification any man but when God came with the gifts of the Spirit the battery of the Holy Ghost oh my I tell your brother God it was getting greater and greater and greater in any man that was one thing justification that was one doctrine st. engage another doctrine but then came the anointing a man in the Pentecostal 90 the baptism of the Holy Ghost all this was quite different from believing justification and believing sanctification well brother God was bringing them more and more into a greater and greater experience with God a man hey man God taking more and more control of their lives because brother the lives that that they lived in the in the days of Wesley and the sanctification was quite different from the life they lived in losers Luther's age yeah okay because in Luther's day my understanding is that they did drink and they did this and they did that but they still believed in justification and they had that faith oh yeah because they'd they went on according to the revelation that came with justification amen but then they went on to sanctification oh that was another revelation amen they God begin to deal with the people and to begin to live a more separated life in the Methodists yes they did but still not as separated as believers would separate or as the Pentecostals would amen and then when God moved on oh yeah eating the Salvation Army when they were when they're lapping between the Queen and Methodists and and the Pentecostal message salvation army brother cuz I've got I've got their their their some of their sermons there now in book form oh yeah they were preaching they said what we need what we need now he says what Peter had on the day of Pentecost they had trained delegation they had justification and now they recognized they needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen oh yeah and one of the one of their sermons they were laying in a delay today they say there's not numbers we are worried about we got numbers they said what we need is separation on to the Lord oh yeah that's what they're preaching near the end of their ministries amen and they were saying listen do you know where all this begins less than a son this begins in your closet and they were preaching to the sisters anyway so thirsty' said this begins in your closet you've got an experience with God you got sanctification let's let's see it reflecting you amen let it start there and let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so when God came in Pentecost for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen this was quite different from Luther quite general Wesley a man this was going to be a greater and a greater experience in their in their everyday living God was going to take more control amen more control of his shade than he had under Luther more control than he had under Wesley and the Pentecostal message was a greater control and brother let me tell you this that the message of Malachi 4 is God taking more control than he did in Pentecost he doesn't have that much I'll be honest and there are people in Pentecost that guy got more control of than he does message believers and as trying to goes on it's going to get more and more worldly better be on our guard please make our calling election sure there's be area Tolls let us in the name of the Lord but let us feed on the Word of God by the grace of God a man let's not cut up with the false and false Christ or he's traveling with false and 9 and once a man Christ is the Anointed One Messiah and he said what what's what's false we thought it's a false in nineteen no he said it's the false christs he said they got the Christ anointing but he said the false is their teaching yeah it's your brother I pray the grace of God that will have the true anointing of the Holy Ghost amen with the true teaching a man because all down true they've had this anointing and and a false teaching and a false teaching they've added to the word took a what took away from the word took even in this hour now brother brother Brown knew it he knew that's why he preached what he preached in 1965 as he was nearing the end of his own ministry he knew he was going but he also knew that they were in to end the word intellectually but not spiritually amen did they believe they believe this they believe that but they didn't believe all that he was saying concerning the living the life that's why he said you're in the message but the message is not in you sure let it be a challenge to believers in the hearing of what I have been preaching and ministering on live in the message for the journal okay is the message in you amen if the message is in you the message controls you amen and it goes beyond just the way you dressed and sometimes the way you act whatever but it controls your everyday living it controls your thoughts your words and your deeds amen amen so I pray God that a grace it is that it's not you that lives this Christ that lives in you amen whether it's in your home withers in your job whether it's in a school or education it's Christ amen amen Withers whether it's made me brother Bob in an office but it's Jesus in him oh who's that that's Christ he's working for the government yeah just thing father said he if you're working for the government you work for the devil yeah that's true but again Satan knows knows God and Satan knows how much he can do Clayton knows how far he can go when it comes to with God oh yes doubt but if it's Christ in you they'll know they'll know you're different you got different attitudes different ideas different thoughts Amen that's right I I feel that they know for sure that it's brother Craig or governor Chad rather that's driving the truck it's Jesus driving the truck you know Jesus is trucker Jesus works in the office yeah it might be well amad you and me in the office that he works in but it's Jesus whatever you do you do it as a Christian you do there's a believer and sometimes you will even consult the Lord oh yeah you say Oh Lord would you help me with this Lord will you give me understanding Lord I need I need you oh yeah as I said regardless of what I have worked with and how I have worked there's time and time and time again that I would say Lord would you help me I need you oh yeah as I said I worked at it worked as a manager of a department store manager of a mall and I worked at this area of that area you know and as a cook and everything I said I said I need you yeah because whatever you do you do in the spirit believers live in the spirit believers walk in the spirit amen by the grace of Almighty God again proving that it's not you that lives as Christ that lives in you amen grace that we are we're we're neither ones but we're staying staying with the word not false a night at once but the true and neither one's a man not a knight true anointed ones but with false teachings but true and ninety ones were the true teaching of the word of God god help us brother is God in control and gods in control God's got preeminence and it's the things of God that got preeminence in your life you give prayers to spiritual not the natural he's got control amen brother he's got control he's got the preeminence in no matter what you're doing even if you're in school no matter what you're doing it's all listen yeah even when I was young going to school it was all mine it was a separated life by the grace of God and as I said that teacher it would be 90 years old now for sure and he's still living that came up to me oh I said mr. lush he said you're gonna be a pastor I don't know I said I'll just leave that with the Lord oh yes he said I feared you're gonna be a pastor amen and that that teacher was a professing Christian of a certain church but he knew I didn't I didn't agree with that church and yet when they had their last graduation in that school they call on me to pray and close the graduation that was the last graduation and when I prayed about the hasta I remembered that there was somebody there that was sick there was a wife of a teacher and I prayed for her yeah before I closed everything I prayed for her and I said please Lord your grace to touch her and I made named her in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I said we pray for the healing virtue of Christ and it might have been a year ago not two years ago I had fellowship with them here during Alberta now and they came back here and they want to fellowship with me and we had fellowship and she said brother I want to thank you for praying for me she said she said the Lord healed me oh I said wonderful thank the Lord well she said praise the Lord thank you yeah and I would say now she's maybe 85 years old that's still in good health thank the Lord anybody see it's a witness so brother wherever you are you're gonna be a witness if you got the anointing of the Holy Ghost in you you'll be a witness if it's in your school it was in university no matter where it is if it's in your job they'll know that you're Christian they know you're different amen by the grace of God to the glory of God oh my no not that time Shirley sorry I said second Peter chapter 2 let me read it aloud to finish please in the name of Jesus concerning the anointing once let's make sure that we're anointed under the true revelation of the word not adding to it not taking from it but reflecting it the way that God spoken amen for the glory of no matter what you do it's for the glory of God not yourself you wanted to horrify God you want to give him preeminence a man your thoughts your words your deeds any man oh yeah he's like when I preach somebody mentioned with me the other day when I preach sister burn just funeral and I said listen she's gonna be a witness to many a person because of the life that she lived amen I said maybe I said when somebody here maybe when you get to get to get to glory get into into the judgement and I see you're gonna say well Lord I never seen you I never heard you in my day or where I lived and I said God will someone look up probably God mentioned this and he should look up and he said he'll look into the sky and he will see sister burns he said who's that oh I know her yes he said that was me for I'd lived I lived in that place and I was called Julie what yes I was called Julie she was a witness to you and you turned down her witness yeah if God lived in a certain place and he was called chant you know that's right you know God lived in a certain place he was called Matthew yeah would would you be a witness against the unbeliever in the day of judgment will God be able to bring him up and show shawm you there oh that was me I was made flesh in in that person I was called Matthew I was made flesh I was called Joshua yeah I was a witness to you wherever Joshua win wherever we went we're witness its Jesus in us its Christ in you oh my oh yeah for emotional affair it's just we're just in an office or Internet in a school or university whatever from brother Chad it's traveling around all across the island but it's a witness who is it Jesus going across the island every day back and forth it's Jesus brother and if they were to see you see him or see somebody else they would know it will strike them in their heart now I think they're Christians yeah I think they're church people yeah they go to church or take yeah god help us god help us brother it's got to be a life that you live it's like when Auto respect to him when president prompt my believe it is and he stood outside the White House with a Bible and Harry was stood up and he laid raised the Bible he didn't say anything but not long after somebody else got spoke was being interviewed yeah he said it's like him he said would it Bible he said is not having it as it is reading it he said he said he needs to read it and he said if he read it he said he would find some other things in it what things that would have controlled his actions and reactions that's what the person was it was indicating and it was it was another politician that that did it that said it oh yes he had the Bible said he but he needs to read the Bible so he said he said he don't read it he said it's no good he saw mom she read it they knew that yeah so brother why yes if you got it in you we were going to reflect it yeah and they were they were finding that fault with with him because why the President had the Bible oh yeah but he didn't quote the Bible now I got to understand their toy he did he did in some of his thoughts expressed the fact that we need we need to pray yeah and we need to need the prayers of the people oh yeah so we think all for that you know by the grace of God and a number of people during these situations - pandemic and during these these issues in in a states concerning these police race whether racism that it racism so on yeah and they've oh yeah thank the Lord there was a time there when a lot of these protesters they got together he got that under knees and prayed oh yeah and praise the Lord and some policemen also got down on their knees yeah I said thank the Lord amen now I tell you why all that's going on it's a witness to Jesus it's a witness to God oh yeah because that's the witness the world's gonna be without excuse they say well we don't believe in God but they thought these thousands got down and prayed yeah and there's one point there there was one of the one of the one of the gentlemen that was done underneath they they were praying right loud screaming in prayer that's right to God be the glory well I tell you the devil's been highlighted but God is being glorified praise the Lord thank the Lord brother but don't don't wait in your life until something like that happens you're gonna go and believe it now you're gonna go and manifest it now by the grace of God a man God Elvis and he said they were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction yeah and many shall follow their own their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken up and through covetousness shall they with on thing words make merchandise of you brother if there's preachers just don't doing this for money there's something wrong definitely no no there's many too many time over the years that brother journalists preach for somebody and didn't get anything didn't matter to me I think one time I went and preached somewhere five times oh you must have got a lot of money no I don't think I got any what no I did it for the glory of God and even if I had to go back I'd go back and do it again yeah oh my owning us as many times I preached never got paid yeah didn't matter to me it was for the glory of God I did it for the Lord I did it for the Gospels think I did it for the for the body of Christ amen to God be the glory but today oh my he warned about those false false invited ones they got in a real anointing they can really preach this and preach this and preach that but they're just doing it for money they knew that they would get money they knew that oh yeah I prefer to go there I prefer to go there you know why are they down there really there really reward you yeah yes god help us brother you see that's going on oh yes that's going on I know it god help us anything God wants his sincerity amen and to covetousness shall they with on thing word or with thing words rather make merchandise of you whose judgment nailed a long time lingered not and their damnation slumbereth not a man for he said if God spared not the Angels that sinned but cast them down to hell delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgement and he goes on top what he spared not the world and so on so also these will pay a price amen just to leave a thought maybe a quote I'm gonna have to take a service and just go through the quotes of the Prophet concerning the anointed ones at the end time and as I said before the prophet of God really felt lit up the Lord to minister in this subject why because he knew that many were caught up under the influence of an anointed ones but they were false in their teaching he said the anointing is not false no no because they're false Christ's they're 19 ones he said but the teaching is false some of the teaching god help us and he brings out an ID Bree I brought it out in the last message he brought it out concerning the rain falls on the just and the unjust yeah and he talked about in the field he said the same rain he said that brings forth the grass he's in the same rain brings forth to see the weeds yeah so he says st. that as it is in the natural shoulders in the spiritual these are the rain that'll bring forth this this this God God doing this God doing god this God teaching this and that he said that same rain will fall on other and they're anointed and he said they'll get up and they'll teach but he said they'll add a word they'll take away a word so grace to make our calling an election sure and make sure that that brother that we're not adding to it we're not taking from it whether it's the ministry or whether it's you as an individual and son and daughter of God don't add to the word to please yourself or to please your family or to please your friends don't take away from the word leave it the way it is amen and again as the Provost said don't make it any bigger than what it is nor any smaller than what it is grace of God be with us but the will of God they may not my real father time be done how many are willing to say that yeah because we got ideas what about God's idea God give us these leadership he's my prayer amen so the grace of God be with us and the Lord willing I'll try to get I want to get into Isaiah and Ezekiel there's two scriptures here that I want to show you concerning anointing once in eternity and they know any ones in time and brother sister what we're dealing with in the end time came from eternity even those who are truly anointed but ever false teaching oh yeah brings it out grace of God be with
