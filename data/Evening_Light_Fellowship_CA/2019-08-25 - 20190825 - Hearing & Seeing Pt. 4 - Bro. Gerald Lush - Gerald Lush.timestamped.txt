[49:34] of the age and what's he doing in us
[49:36] he's revealing himself he's revealing
[49:38] his word he's revealing his plan and
[49:40] purpose for for our lives but what but
[49:43] for for his purpose in the earth amen
[49:46] he's got a plan he's got a purpose he's
[49:48] got a pattern so I pray the grace of God
[49:51] that were into the revelation of that
[49:53] plan we're part of that plan
[49:56] amen we're part of the purpose of God
[49:58] and the pattern of God amen
[50:00] so brother I pray grace that will
[50:03] worship Him morning noon and night a man
[50:07] so the Lord blessed us and thank you
[50:09] again for your prayers while we were
[50:10] absent and sorry that we were not here
[50:15] to say farewell to the bigots and also
[50:19] our sister Berta Z a man we thank the
[50:22] Lord for our sisters testimony they made
[50:25] a testimony that Jesus is the same
[50:27] yesterday today and forever just think
[50:30] they'd admit that the ministry that they
[50:32] experienced in the Alpha ministry that
[50:34] she experienced in the Omega ministry
[50:36] while Jesus who did - did to those in
[50:39] his day when he was here in flesh Jesus
[50:41] did the same thing in the end time -
[50:44] sisters to the vertices a man so we
[50:47] thank God for that it's amazing that the
[50:49] Lord sent somebody our way that actually
[50:52] experienced a man what God had done in
[50:56] these last days and I trust my graces is
[50:59] making us more aware brother certain
[51:02] more conscious of what God is doing a
[51:04] man so brothers sister that's our
[51:06] salvation that's our redemption that's
[51:09] the Blessed hope is to recognize what
[51:10] God is doing
[51:12] they mad too often we're looking back to
[51:14] what God has done and maybe what God
[51:16] will do but what is God doing what is
[51:18] God doing in your life what is God doing
[51:20] in this assembly a man brother we want
[51:23] we want to recognize that and we want to
[51:25] be a part of it we might be right there
[51:27] a man with the grace of God in the Word
[51:30] of God so well god help us to to believe
[51:34] it God help us to recognize it
[51:36] God help us to keep moving on amen and
[51:39] trusting the revealed word amen and
[51:42] again I say it again I've had to repeat
[51:45] it while I was gone that there is no
[51:47] book like this one and brother it from
[51:49] beginning to end it's got a plan it's
[51:51] got a purpose and it's got a pattern a
[51:53] man so brother but that's what the world
[51:56] doesn't doesn't recognize is the planned
[51:58] purpose and pattern then your think
[52:00] there's a god and only wrote the book
[52:02] and he had this one do this this one do
[52:05] that yeah but he had a purpose a man
[52:07] went in the beginning he created the
[52:09] heaven and the earth he had a purpose a
[52:11] man he had a plan yeah and he had a
[52:13] pattern and I trust that we're part of
[52:15] his plan is purposed in his pattern I
[52:17] trust that God will give you a greater
[52:20] revelation of your part in God's plan a
[52:23] man
[52:24] there's nothing accidental a man not for
[52:27] the elect of God not forgot he is
[52:29] ordained this he has ordained that he
[52:31] has predestinated this predestinated
[52:33] that so I trust by the grace of God that
[52:36] God is recognizing our attitude is radar
[52:38] spirit is right we're on meaning we're
[52:40] thirsting a man to get more and more of
[52:43] God in our lives
[52:44] praise the Lord and we're all in a
[52:46] thirsting for what our brother was
[52:47] singing the course about concerning the
[52:49] rapture Amen brother he's got to get us
[52:52] out of here amen all the elect of God
[52:55] all the predestinated seat of God all
[52:57] those with a right right attitude and
[52:59] the right spirit we got to get out of
[53:01] here because he's going to make a new
[53:02] heaven and a new earth
[53:03] amen and then we'll come back and to
[53:06] reign with him in his strong they praise
[53:08] the Lord to God be the glory
[53:10] so god bless her brother Vegas there's
[53:12] no doubt they're back in Tucson or and
[53:14] our sister put Isaac Matassa a man is
[53:17] history
[53:18] eighty-two years old but still loving
[53:21] the Lord 82 years old still trusting the
[53:24] Lord still remembering what God did in
[53:27] her life in this hour so it was a
[53:30] blessing to us a man God kept her on the
[53:33] scene all this time before to be here to
[53:36] give the witness to you and me a man so
[53:38] God be praised and I bring greetings
[53:43] because we endeavored by the grace of
[53:45] God to minister to the Saints outside
[53:48] the city and to serve communion and foot
[53:52] washing and the Saints send their
[53:55] greetings from the Ellsworth's in
[53:57] caramel and they said make sure you give
[54:00] our greetings to the Saints he said and
[54:02] all of them might tell them that we're
[54:03] praying for them amen thank the Lord and
[54:06] of course the the brother Thales were
[54:09] sorry in their 80s and then most that I
[54:11] administered to are getting real really
[54:14] really old physically but getting
[54:17] younger spiritually by the grace of God
[54:20] so the Elsword send their greens our
[54:23] brother Karen straight and Linda Peck
[54:26] fruit in Phillips and they also send
[54:28] their greetings and of course our
[54:31] brother Tom and sister Shirley and
[54:32] Bishop Falls and we're able to minister
[54:35] to them and again they're in their
[54:37] eighties so we thank the Lord for the
[54:39] opportunity to serve them the communion
[54:42] a man and also again we had a wonderful
[54:45] time with our sister drover a man she's
[54:48] bedridden but I'll tell you this she's
[54:51] not been ridden fish virtually no not by
[54:55] any means it was it was a real blessing
[54:57] a man to have fellowship with her and to
[55:00] serve with the communion so god bless
[55:02] our sister drove her and she says the
[55:04] greetings to everybody here and she's
[55:06] usually list tune in online a man so and
[55:10] like I said she's in her bed this
[55:12] morning and maybe watching the service
[55:14] so god bless our sister drover and she's
[55:17] really into the word she's really
[55:18] looking for the resurrection the rapture
[55:20] if the doctor tells her this she'll tell
[55:22] the doctor that amen oh yes she's not
[55:25] ashamed of it she tells the doctor I'm
[55:27] not afraid she said to die she said
[55:29] that's good she said I'll be with my
[55:31] husband I'll be
[55:32] glory with the Lord a man she says she's
[55:34] tells the doctor those things where they
[55:36] wanted to do this they wanted to do that
[55:38] because they want to preserve her light
[55:40] but she's not into that a man she said
[55:43] to the Word of God she's into the
[55:45] promise of God and she's looking for
[55:47] she's looking for a body like his
[55:48] glorified body a man so I pray God bless
[55:52] our sister drove her I pray God give us
[55:55] the joy the peace the love that she has
[55:58] for the Lord

[1:07:12] Jesus out of anything we do a man in all
[1:07:16] things we want him to be with us praise
[1:07:19] the name of the Lord in the book of
[1:07:21] Revelation and reading from verse nine
[1:07:24] to eleven I John who also am your
[1:07:30] brother and companion in tribulation
[1:07:35] we're going to take our stand for the
[1:07:37] word we're going to experience
[1:07:39] tribulation in everyday life not the
[1:07:42] Great Tribulation but the tribulation of
[1:07:45] living for Jesus the tribulation of
[1:07:47] taking our stand for the truth of the
[1:07:50] word of God so he said I John who also
[1:07:53] am your brother and companion in
[1:07:57] tribulation and in the kingdom and
[1:08:01] patience of Jesus Christ and he said was
[1:08:05] in the isle that is called Patmos for
[1:08:08] the word of God and for the testimony of
[1:08:12] Jesus Christ a man what it was what are
[1:08:15] we enduring for the word of God and for
[1:08:18] the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in
[1:08:22] the spirit on the Lord's Day a man or
[1:08:26] the day of the Lord in the end of all
[1:08:28] things a man I trust that we were also
[1:08:32] identified with John and that we are in
[1:08:35] the Spirit of God a man on the Lord's
[1:08:38] Day and heard behind me a great voice as
[1:08:41] of a trumpet heard behind me a great
[1:08:46] voice
[1:08:47] he heard it and he was going to see it a
[1:08:49] man is one thing to hear it
[1:08:52] well what about seeing what God wants
[1:08:54] you to see and not only that again
[1:08:56] as we get back into this message are we
[1:08:58] going to are we going to see it the way
[1:09:00] that God has ordained it and
[1:09:02] predestinated for us to see really what
[1:09:05] God has done what God is doing what God
[1:09:07] will do a man's not it's not all on what
[1:09:10] he's done and what he will do but it's
[1:09:12] in we're brought up we want to focus on
[1:09:13] what God is doing a man then how would
[1:09:16] he do with that revival of that revival
[1:09:19] of this church and that church what's he
[1:09:21] doing now a man and reversing the
[1:09:23] problem all down through the ages a man
[1:09:25] has seen God yesterday and tomorrow but
[1:09:27] they don't recognize him today a man but
[1:09:30] to get to have the faith that pleases
[1:09:32] God and without faith that is impossible
[1:09:34] to please him a man and what is for
[1:09:37] faith that pleases God is a faith the
[1:09:39] revelation of what he's doing in the
[1:09:41] present tense a man not just past tense
[1:09:44] but the present tense a man and
[1:09:46] believing also what he will do in the
[1:09:49] future so I pray God that we're in the
[1:09:51] present tense revelation of God and he
[1:09:54] said John was in the spirit on the
[1:09:56] Lord's Day and heard behind me a great
[1:10:00] voice and it was the voice of
[1:10:03] theophanies a man they ordained and
[1:10:07] predestined her to to reveal to John a
[1:10:09] man what God has done what God was going
[1:10:12] to do a man gen John was part was to be
[1:10:16] part of that revelation so he said and
[1:10:20] it was like a trumpet saying I am Alpha
[1:10:24] and Omega the first and the last a man
[1:10:29] and what thou seest write in a book
[1:10:34] where it we see it and we one the Holy
[1:10:38] Ghost to write it in our hearts a man so
[1:10:43] that now the word the word was made
[1:10:44] flesh in the beginning was the word and
[1:10:46] the Word was made flesh and dwell among
[1:10:48] us well in these last days he promised
[1:10:51] it again in the in the Omega ministry
[1:10:53] the word is made flesh in mrs. Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ in his right little by little by
[1:10:59] little he has revealed himself to
[1:11:01] finally in the end and he where he
[1:11:03] promised to restore all things the word
[1:11:05] is made flesh in the right
[1:11:07] and brother now we are recognizing the
[1:11:09] Alpha and the Omega God the first and
[1:11:12] the last
[1:11:13] coming from eternity into time but now
[1:11:16] we're going from time back to eternity
[1:11:18] praise the Lord and he said and what
[1:11:21] they'll see us write in a book what we
[1:11:23] see
[1:11:24] make sure it's written in our hearts a
[1:11:26] man and send it unto the seven churches
[1:11:29] which are in Asia a man we want to bear
[1:11:34] witness of it to the world a man because
[1:11:37] we are looking at and we are we see we
[1:11:39] see the witness as the word of the seven
[1:11:41] Church ages a man and so there but again
[1:11:44] there just there's a sinner in a past
[1:11:46] tense but not in the present tense
[1:11:48] they just worry because they organized
[1:11:51] it and they became a denomination but
[1:11:53] God moved on and God moved on and God
[1:11:55] moved on and I trust a god a God has
[1:11:58] moved on and God is in US and I trust
[1:12:01] we're not going to organize we're not
[1:12:02] gonna make any nomination we're gonna
[1:12:04] move on with God in the resurrection and
[1:12:06] the rapture in the glorified bodies amen
[1:12:10] recognizing the Alpha and Omega 2,000
[1:12:13] years ago
[1:12:14] recognizing the Alpha and Omega today
[1:12:16] praise the name of the Lord and he said
[1:12:19] what they'll see is write in a book and
[1:12:22] send it unto the seven churches which
[1:12:25] are in Asia under emphasis under sir
[1:12:28] Myrna under pergamus on the tyre Tara
[1:12:31] and under Sardis and unto Philadelphia
[1:12:33] and unto Laodicea and I turned to see
[1:12:39] the voice to hear it or see it he turned
[1:12:44] to see the voice are we seeing the voice
[1:12:47] I'm recognizing the Word made flesh a
[1:12:50] man while we're hearing is and seen is
[1:12:54] the same thing it is the Word made flesh
[1:12:56] for this day and this hour it is God
[1:12:59] revealing to us what we need to know and
[1:13:01] what we need to see and what we need to
[1:13:03] stand for in this day and in this hour
[1:13:05] not not just saying God did this God did
[1:13:07] this God did this but let's believe that
[1:13:09] God is doing this a man so that was that
[1:13:12] happen in the Alpha ministry then they
[1:13:14] knew what God did but they never had the
[1:13:17] revelation what God was doing
[1:13:19] our Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's
[1:13:22] why they crucified him and they don't
[1:13:24] recognize what God is doing in this hour
[1:13:26] in mrs. Jesus Christ and that's why
[1:13:28] they'll crucify the it's the second
[1:13:30] crucifixion of the word of God the Word
[1:13:33] was made flesh land they crucified it
[1:13:35] the word is made flesh today and they'll
[1:13:37] crucify it
[1:13:38] amen amen we're going to lose our rights
[1:13:41] particular because we're taking our
[1:13:43] stand for this we're taking our stand
[1:13:45] for that a man the world the world wants
[1:13:47] to compromise with it but we're gonna
[1:13:49] take our stand by the Lord a man what
[1:13:52] does the Bible say as I was visiting
[1:13:55] with an individual and and he was
[1:13:57] talking about the Bible's that he had
[1:13:59] there and I won't say where they were
[1:14:02] proud and he said old my brother he said
[1:14:05] it's amazing what they're doing with the
[1:14:07] Word of God and he's saying they're
[1:14:09] printing these Bibles this version this
[1:14:11] version this version and so on to
[1:14:14] finally there's a version in the Bible
[1:14:16] where they have left out an entire
[1:14:18] chapter a man now I said brother of the
[1:14:21] world can they do that
[1:14:22] when Brooklyn in Revelation says don't
[1:14:25] head to it and don't take away from it
[1:14:26] the Word of God but brother whoever
[1:14:29] printed that certain that certain
[1:14:30] version of the Bible left out an entire
[1:14:32] chapter because they didn't believe
[1:14:34] exactly whether what the brother was
[1:14:36] saying in that chapter and not only that
[1:14:38] he said he said they there if it went on
[1:14:41] through and if the Bible condemned this
[1:14:43] they leave out that verse and the Bible
[1:14:46] could name that they live over that
[1:14:47] verse amen if there's anything there
[1:14:50] then you know that the governments and
[1:14:51] then the world and the churches are
[1:14:53] going along with and but the Bible
[1:14:55] condemns it they're going to do when
[1:14:56] they omit that from the Bible old
[1:14:58] brother
[1:14:59] again we are in the end we're in the
[1:15:02] last days and so as there were radiant
[1:15:04] in radiant obeying the book of
[1:15:06] Revelation and we have it and if any man
[1:15:08] shall take away from the words of the
[1:15:11] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:15:13] away his part out of the book of life
[1:15:15] out of the holy city and from the things
[1:15:18] which are written in this book
[1:15:20] amen you can't add to the Word of God
[1:15:24] and you cannot take away from it amen
[1:15:27] and if you're a seed of God you want the
[1:15:29] truth the whole truth and you want
[1:15:31] nothing but the
[1:15:32] a man by the grace of Almighty God so
[1:15:36] the grace of God be with us
[1:15:37] amen there we're gonna we're going to
[1:15:40] leave the word the way it is we're going
[1:15:42] to believe what God is doing in our day
[1:15:44] according to the word and he said I
[1:15:46] turned to see the voice you hear it but
[1:15:50] then you got to see what it's saying you
[1:15:51] got to see what it means and you're
[1:15:53] going to see it the way God wants you to
[1:15:56] see it now the way the church wants you
[1:15:57] to see it the way God wants you to see
[1:15:59] it
[1:15:59] amen and he said and being turned I saw
[1:16:04] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[1:16:09] midst of the seven candlesticks
[1:16:11] he said one like unto the Son of man a
[1:16:14] man he was clothed with a garment down
[1:16:17] to the foot and Girt about the paps with
[1:16:20] a golden girdle amen the revelation of
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ in this day in this hour a
[1:16:25] man as yes as our Lord and Savior of the
[1:16:29] bright but as a judge of the world now
[1:16:32] he stressed as a judge in this hour and
[1:16:35] this message is the message is calling
[1:16:38] the elect out for the resurrection
[1:16:39] rapture but as bringing judgment upon
[1:16:42] the world bringing judgment upon the
[1:16:45] earth a man so grace that were going to
[1:16:48] catch the grace of the revealed word a
[1:16:50] man not the gentleman but the grace of
[1:16:54] the revealed word that's going to give
[1:16:56] us resurrection and Rob free faith to
[1:16:58] get us out of here and he said his head
[1:17:01] and his hairs were white like wool as
[1:17:04] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[1:17:07] flame of fire and his feet like unto
[1:17:10] fine brass his judgment as if they
[1:17:13] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[1:17:16] sound of many waters a man the
[1:17:20] revelation of the word down through the
[1:17:22] ages
[1:17:23] his voice is the sound of many waters
[1:17:25] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[1:17:28] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:17:31] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[1:17:33] as the Sun Shine a--the in his strength
[1:17:36] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:17:41] dead a man
[1:17:45] grace they were going to die to
[1:17:47] ourselves any a lady's right hand upon
[1:17:52] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[1:17:55] first and the last I am he that liveth
[1:17:59] and was dead behold I am Alive for
[1:18:02] evermore amen and have the keys of hell
[1:18:07] and of death
[1:18:08] god bless his word you may be seated it
[1:18:13] was God Kent bringing John into the ring
[1:18:15] to the dimension to reveal to him the
[1:18:18] mystery of God the plan of God the
[1:18:20] purpose and the pattern down and
[1:18:23] especially dead down for the church ages
[1:18:25] and amen believing that this was the
[1:18:28] light of God in the first age but in the
[1:18:31] last days we know that the light a man
[1:18:33] it goes into total darkness a man
[1:18:35] concerning the last stage a man but the
[1:18:40] Prophet God did say said I put that
[1:18:42] little bit there because we're because
[1:18:44] the bride is going to get out of the
[1:18:45] load of C&H and we're going into the
[1:18:48] bride age and in the bride age is the
[1:18:50] revelation of the word Amen it is the
[1:18:53] finish of the mystery of God and as age
[1:18:55] as he told John again in Revelation 10
[1:18:58] and he said now he said don't do this
[1:18:59] and don't do that or he said seal this
[1:19:01] and seal that because he said in the
[1:19:04] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:19:06] he said the mystery of God is going to
[1:19:08] be finished go who is the seventh angel
[1:19:11] as the cogman has he gone we believe
[1:19:13] that the seventh angel has come and the
[1:19:15] seventh angel is gone a man but he has
[1:19:18] left for the bride the revelation of the
[1:19:20] revealed word the revelation of the
[1:19:22] mystery of God and he said right there
[1:19:25] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:19:26] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:19:29] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:19:32] is declared to his servants the prophets
[1:19:34] a man but who's going to recognize the
[1:19:37] the the prophet who's going to literally
[1:19:40] recognize the ministry that's going to
[1:19:42] finish the mystery of God that's going
[1:19:43] to reveal the mystery of God there's not
[1:19:45] going to be very many in this day and in
[1:19:47] this hour in this age that are going to
[1:19:49] recognize it
[1:19:50] amen because we find that in the last
[1:19:53] search age where
[1:19:54] we went into a total darkness a man Oh
[1:19:57] God did God did this God did that God
[1:19:59] did this but eventually the enemy got in
[1:20:02] a man and caused him to organize that
[1:20:05] cause Allah make a denomination out of
[1:20:06] it hey man man and and and when they
[1:20:08] made a denomination of it we believe
[1:20:10] this we believe this we believe that
[1:20:12] period Amen but you don't you don't say
[1:20:15] that I believe this period I believe
[1:20:16] that period no and whatever else the
[1:20:19] Lord will reveal amen
[1:20:21] not just what he did but what he's
[1:20:22] hundred what he's doing and what he's
[1:20:24] going to do but what happened what
[1:20:26] happened after the church ages they
[1:20:28] believed what God did as a word but then
[1:20:30] there was a generation rose up that
[1:20:32] wouldn't believe anything else they
[1:20:33] believe this is it now we were going to
[1:20:35] believe this this is our Creed a man but
[1:20:38] God had got moved on to another race
[1:20:40] another age another age and brother so
[1:20:42] did the devil as he was in the Garden of
[1:20:44] Eden a man so the Soviets in this day
[1:20:47] our he's and he's in the garden of the
[1:20:49] spiritual Eden he was in the garden of
[1:20:52] the physical he 90 I need to see the
[1:20:55] woman and the woman deceived the man a
[1:20:57] man and so now he's in this hour and in
[1:21:00] this age brother right on down through
[1:21:02] again we're dealing with with the devil
[1:21:04] in the Garden of Eden the spiritual
[1:21:06] Garden of Eden and brother as he
[1:21:08] deceived them back man mm solid 6,000
[1:21:12] years ago he's deceiving them now amen
[1:21:15] to believe all you got to do is go to
[1:21:17] church all they got to do is do this all
[1:21:19] you got to do is believe that you got to
[1:21:21] believe what God is doing
[1:21:23] amen now what he's done but what he's
[1:21:26] doing and then in what you and I are
[1:21:28] witnessing is that they do not believe
[1:21:31] what God has done and what God is doing
[1:21:33] they do not believe what God is going to
[1:21:35] do amen
[1:21:37] where is our faith is adjusting what God
[1:21:40] did or isn't in what God is doing and
[1:21:42] what God will do amen
[1:21:44] to be part of the resurrection and the
[1:21:46] rapture by the grace of God we got to
[1:21:48] recognize what he's doing to give us
[1:21:50] resurrection and rapturing pain ain't
[1:21:52] man and then we then we believe and
[1:21:55] understand what he's going to do a man
[1:21:57] we're going to be resurrected we're
[1:21:59] going to be raptured we're going from
[1:22:01] time to eternity
[1:22:02] man we're going to go into a glorified
[1:22:04] body like his glorious Marty hey man
[1:22:06] we're going to the marriage supper of
[1:22:08] the Lamb
[1:22:09] amen we're going to sit with him in his
[1:22:13] role by the grace of Almighty God God
[1:22:16] Elvis to believe it
[1:22:17] god help us to recognize it amen not
[1:22:20] just say I believe God did this I
[1:22:22] believe God did they that's good
[1:22:23] but let's say I believe God is doing
[1:22:25] this and that is why that we are here
[1:22:28] this morning amen if we're going to go
[1:22:30] by what God did with the other in the
[1:22:32] denomination maybe in Pentecost or or or
[1:22:35] the United Pentecostal church but
[1:22:37] because we're believing what God is
[1:22:39] doing
[1:22:39] amen it separates us strong organized
[1:22:42] religion amen and it separates us unto
[1:22:46] the Lord amen that's what he did in his
[1:22:49] helpful ministry he had to call them out
[1:22:51] and he man because the word brought him
[1:22:54] out from from from the religion of that
[1:22:56] day the scribes and the Pharisees and
[1:22:58] the Jewish religion a man but they were
[1:23:01] so organized they did not believe what
[1:23:04] God was doing just think it was the word
[1:23:06] in flesh and they crucified it Amen here
[1:23:10] there they were they would appreciate in
[1:23:11] their synagogues they were looking for
[1:23:13] the Messiah because you know God said
[1:23:15] here God said there Genesis right on
[1:23:17] down through the prophets God said he
[1:23:19] was going to send the Messiah I was
[1:23:21] going to do this but brother when God
[1:23:23] came on the scene in flesh and begin to
[1:23:25] do it they didn't believe it they didn't
[1:23:27] recognize it a man because he wasn't
[1:23:30] there to promote them he was there to
[1:23:32] promote God it wasn't there to promote
[1:23:35] but they their ideas he was there to
[1:23:37] promote the Word of God amen
[1:23:39] and get the attention of men are not to
[1:23:42] man but to get the attention put on God
[1:23:44] get the attention but on the Lord a man
[1:23:47] and that's what God is doing even even

[1:23:51] going for the word he wants to get your
[1:23:53] attention on him he wants you to pay
[1:23:55] attention to his word he wants you to to
[1:23:57] catch his word he wants you to recognize
[1:23:59] his word ain't my brother no a God would

[1:29:37] believe that a man as he is he went and
[1:29:40] he came on the seat in that scene in the
[1:29:41] first age
[1:29:42] oh yeah God said this when the devil
[1:29:44] said that a man the deeds of the
[1:29:47] Nicolaitans a man and they were
[1:29:51] believing what the devil was saying the
[1:29:53] devil's interpretation of what God was
[1:29:55] doing and they were believing Satan more
[1:29:57] and more and more and more and more as
[1:29:59] they got more and more organized in
[1:30:02] their religion more and more organized
[1:30:04] in the revelation of the head a man
[1:30:06] making a denomination out of it and all
[1:30:09] you know God said don't add to it don't
[1:30:10] take from it but whether that has God
[1:30:12] reveals it ain't man but brother I turn
[1:30:15] to this to make make it a denomination
[1:30:18] of it and enternity turning like the
[1:30:20] revelation into a Creed ain't man and
[1:30:23] the treatise I believe we believe this
[1:30:26] this this and this well we believe the
[1:30:29] Bible we believe the word
[1:30:31] we believe the truth the whole truth
[1:30:33] nothing but the truth
[1:30:34] hey Maya but the enemy got among them
[1:30:36] hey man and to interpret what God was
[1:30:39] doing as he did interpret it to Eve a
[1:30:41] man so he interpreted to the Spurs
[1:30:44] relieve down to the churches Church ages
[1:30:47] and the first what we have so many
[1:30:48] churches as well
[1:30:50] we had so much in the realm of organized
[1:30:52] religion a man but thank God that he
[1:30:55] brought us out of the spirit of
[1:30:57] organized religion a man so we were in
[1:31:00] or in the in the realm of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:02] with the liberty to believe it is
[1:31:04] written to believe thus saith the Lord
[1:31:08] a man brother that and all I pray in the
[1:31:11] name of Jesus brother when the enemy
[1:31:13] comes to tempt us as he tempted Jesus
[1:31:15] brother we're going to give him the same
[1:31:17] answer that Jesus gave him and every
[1:31:20] time the devil tempted Jesus he said it
[1:31:22] is written amen it is written it is
[1:31:25] written but that was an example for you
[1:31:27] and me in this hour when the enemy comes
[1:31:29] in with religion and pretending it is a
[1:31:32] spiritual all your devices as the Bible
[1:31:35] says that yes but it is written it is
[1:31:38] written you need that you need to use
[1:31:40] that brother when it comes to witnessing
[1:31:42] and testifying to the people out there
[1:31:43] even though many are religious there's
[1:31:46] time death they'll say this they'll say
[1:31:47] that we believe this we believe there
[1:31:49] yes that's fine but it is also written
[1:31:52] they won't believe that but not what
[1:31:55] else got us given Amen sir brother a
[1:31:59] telephone it came down to the to the
[1:32:02] enemy true his false religion down for
[1:32:05] the church ages amen
[1:32:07] he brought on he brought on the people
[1:32:09] that that spirit of of Alzheimer's a man
[1:32:12] too funny they did they forgot who they
[1:32:14] weren't they don't really recognize who
[1:32:16] they are and they don't recognize one
[1:32:19] another as the sons and daughters of God
[1:32:21] and you know the when it comes to our
[1:32:23] brothers and sisters of like precious
[1:32:25] faith no no and so they're just brothers
[1:32:27] and sisters in in a church faith a man
[1:32:30] the faith that could delegate them oh
[1:32:32] yeah the devil gave Eve faith but
[1:32:37] brother I turn it is it was going to
[1:32:39] destroy them not save them amen
[1:32:42] but God permitted it for a reason right
[1:32:44] to bring out what's here going on here
[1:32:46] today
[1:32:47] hey man guys see he had a purpose he had
[1:32:50] a plan he had a pattern so brother he
[1:32:53] allowed this he knew what was going to
[1:32:55] happen this was an accidental as I as I
[1:32:58] said four years as a Christian before I
[1:33:00] came to the river
[1:33:01] of Malachi 4 and what God was doing
[1:33:04] today in this our brother Isis had the
[1:33:07] idea of the bud the Bible and so that's
[1:33:09] God's book you know and all your God did
[1:33:12] this with the devil when did this we
[1:33:14] believe that in a sense that the devil
[1:33:16] trick God we believe that in a sense of
[1:33:19] the devil you know you eat to see God
[1:33:21] you can't deceive God anybody you can
[1:33:24] trigger it because God no one knows what
[1:33:26] no one knows what's going on God knew
[1:33:28] what was going to happen
[1:33:29] ain't no but God permitted it for a
[1:33:32] reason hey man so do you have the
[1:33:34] revelation of white God permitted I
[1:33:36] preached a number of times why did God
[1:33:39] permit it
[1:33:40] why did God allow this and this and this
[1:33:42] all down through the ages hey man what
[1:33:45] for it is to bring out his seed he
[1:33:47] managed to make manifest the seed of God
[1:33:50] who was going to stay with his word any
[1:33:52] man and only that who was going to love
[1:33:54] him for who he is a man that God's going
[1:33:57] to reel his character and you're gonna
[1:33:59] love him because he's such a God any man
[1:34:03] because God is love he's not willing
[1:34:06] that any should perish but he knows many
[1:34:07] are going to perish a man and the
[1:34:10] majority are gonna perish
[1:34:11] yeah but he's there to call out his
[1:34:14] elect praise the name he's there to
[1:34:17] catch his seat oh yeah brother sister he
[1:34:22] deliver the Bible says in Malachi there
[1:34:25] that he even helps and the the wicked he
[1:34:30] said they that tempt God are even
[1:34:32] delivered a man that's Malachi 450 or
[1:34:36] 315 even they that tempt God are
[1:34:38] delivered amen oh yes that's God's grace
[1:34:40] and that's God's love but yet the thing
[1:34:42] of it is we know that because what's in
[1:34:45] their heart God sees what's in their
[1:34:46] heart and he knows that anything in
[1:34:48] their hearts they don't love him he
[1:34:51] knows that in in their hearts they don't
[1:34:53] know they don't love his children they
[1:34:54] don't love his word amen
[1:34:56] and in the end they're destroyed and
[1:34:59] they had their time in the lake that
[1:35:00] burneth with fire and brimstone that's
[1:35:02] their time now it's not just a part time
[1:35:05] we know it's good it's the second death
[1:35:08] God help his brother
[1:35:10] oh I pray in the name of Jesus don't get
[1:35:13] spiritual loss anguish please don't do
[1:35:18] that
[1:35:18] just let's let the Holy Spirit but
[1:35:21] continue to bring to our remembrance
[1:35:22] what God is saying continue to bring to
[1:35:25] our remembrance what we need to know
[1:35:27] what we need to hear what we need to
[1:35:29] recognize any man to give us the faith
[1:35:31] that pleases God and brothers not the
[1:35:34] faith just in Luther's day in Wesley's
[1:35:36] day it's a greater and greater and
[1:35:38] greater faith because God is giving us
[1:35:40] that plus plus plus plus and to finally
[1:35:44] he give us the full revelation of who he
[1:35:46] is and his prayer the full revelation of
[1:35:49] his plan and his purpose and great and
[1:35:52] the myrrh and the vast majority of the
[1:35:53] world today religiously they do not
[1:35:56] recognize God's plan no no they just

[1:36:23] God and they men and he hallelujah and

[1:49:52] what God is saying what the Holy Ghost
[1:49:54] is saying to the church to the bride of
[1:49:57] the Lord Jesus Christ the brides gone
[1:49:59] here yeah I heard it but those in the
[1:50:03] church that I attended didn't hear a man
[1:50:07] and because I could because I bore
[1:50:09] witness of the word that the pastor
[1:50:11] called me in and threatened me yeah he
[1:50:16] said if you don't hold your peace he
[1:50:18] said I ain't gonna bring you up before
[1:50:20] the Lord the church board I said
[1:50:26] brother don't worry you won't have to do
[1:50:28] that I said I won't be back now so I
[1:50:32] came out of the office went over to get
[1:50:34] it get my coat and I still wonder who it
[1:50:39] was I don't know but a sister was
[1:50:43] standing in the door because the service
[1:50:44] was still going on
[1:50:45] and her sister came and stood at the
[1:50:48] door and when I went to pass her she
[1:50:52] said oh excuse me brother she said you
[1:50:56] were in the pastor's office
[1:50:58] I said yes sister
[1:51:01] oh I said I thought you were she said
[1:51:05] and it seemed like she was concerned or
[1:51:08] whatever but I said the Lord bless you
[1:51:10] and she said god bless you and I got my
[1:51:13] coat and went on I never went back
[1:51:15] that's right oh yeah there from there on
[1:51:19] I began to just be free of denominations
[1:51:24] free of organized religion and so on
[1:51:26] and finally I came in contact with a
[1:51:28] with a brother that lived in the in the
[1:51:30] city and Andy and his wife and if they
[1:51:33] were believing what we're believing here
[1:51:34] today by the grace of God and they're
[1:51:36] still going on and still alive and
[1:51:39] they're living in New Brunswick and so
[1:51:42] on but he even is pastor in another
[1:51:45] Church there called me and blame me for
[1:51:49] causing that man to leave his church but
[1:51:52] I didn't do that but I did talk to the
[1:51:54] pastor regarding the Word of God and
[1:51:57] understanding the Word of God and so on
[1:51:59] now of course after I said that God
[1:52:02] blessed you Sara said I'll leave and he
[1:52:06] went and told his friends he said all
[1:52:09] that that guy he says he haven't got a
[1:52:12] clue he says about that about Pentecost
[1:52:17] it was the Pentecostal church he said
[1:52:19] yeah I've got a clue moving us well
[1:52:22] maybe I had more clothes than needed
[1:52:24] yeah that's right
[1:52:26] because eventually I did witness that
[1:52:28] brother going off into a modern form of
[1:52:31] Pentecostalism no did God be the glory
[1:52:36] I say they didn't all turn against me
[1:52:40] because one of the one of the high
[1:52:42] leaders of the Pentecostal movement him
[1:52:44] in Newfoundland he's still alive but he
[1:52:47] always greets me as brother Gerald if I
[1:52:50] were to walk by him today
[1:52:52] he would greet me yeah thank God
[1:52:55] god help us brother that we're going to
[1:52:58] hear the word of God we're going to hear
[1:53:00] his voice and that you're here today to
[1:53:03] hear the voice to reveal the will of God
[1:53:06] to you a man and he said I stand at the
[1:53:09] door and knock
[1:53:10] he said he's at the door of your heart
[1:53:12] knocking they won't let him into the
[1:53:14] church a man but will you let him into
[1:53:19] your heart so you can have fellowship
[1:53:21] with him and he left fellowship with you
[1:53:23] you love him and he loves you by the
[1:53:26] grace of God a man and he said well that
[1:53:30] fellowships up with one another and with
[1:53:33] him and he with me
[1:53:34] and to him that overcometh and he said
[1:53:36] he that Anthony er did him hear what the
[1:53:38] spirit saith unto the churches again
[1:53:41] it's the year of your soul amen oh my
[1:53:45] turn with me to revelation 6 I tried my
[1:53:53] grace to bring it to a conclusion I
[1:53:58] won't bring this sermon to a conclusion
[1:54:01] concerning I have heard but now I see
[1:54:05] but to bring these thoughts to a
[1:54:07] conclusion and let me say this if we go
[1:54:13] into the word hearing is one thing but
[1:54:16] seeing is another many heard the Prophet
[1:54:21] but they didn't see didn't see him as a
[1:54:26] prophet
[1:54:26] oh they recognize William Branham as
[1:54:29] being an old man with a tremendous
[1:54:30] ministry he had he had these signs that
[1:54:33] nobody else ever had except Jesus 2,000
[1:54:36] years ago and he could an our sister
[1:54:39] Berta Z it was good thank the Lord for
[1:54:42] her testimony because she made him a man
[1:54:44] now in Britain guys why because she was
[1:54:47] sick and I was blessed when she
[1:54:50] claimed that she experienced the first
[1:54:52] sign that the angel gave the Gabriel in
[1:54:55] Brenham but and it was his left hand a
[1:54:58] man and he had to take their left hand
[1:55:01] in his left hand why why because it was
[1:55:04] heart-to-heart a man he was going to
[1:55:07] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:55:09] heart
[1:55:09] he would discern again what was wrong
[1:55:11] with them and that's amazing that we
[1:55:13] that our sister gave the testimony that
[1:55:15] she saw what was going on in his left
[1:55:18] hand when he took hers a man but then
[1:55:22] when he prayed it was gone and he said
[1:55:25] you're healed so he had he had that sign
[1:55:28] and then of course she he went and he
[1:55:31] ministered to another one there she went
[1:55:33] and stood by the door and he went over
[1:55:34] to her after and discerned the thoughts
[1:55:36] and intents of her heart to God be the
[1:55:39] glory amen
[1:55:41] it was just to get the attention to the
[1:55:44] third pole the revealing of the word to
[1:55:47] give us what God wants us to have
[1:55:49] rapture in faith there's anything God
[1:55:53] wants us to have in this hour his
[1:55:55] rapture in thing there's this doctrine
[1:55:57] this doctrine this doctrine all of it
[1:55:59] but it's giving us fracturing faith so
[1:56:02] we have raised our hands Lord and coming
[1:56:04] home so by grace revelation 6 verse 1
[1:56:14] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:56:19] the seals and I heard have we heard
[1:56:24] we've got to hear it in our hearts and I
[1:56:29] heard as it were the noise of thunder
[1:56:31] and one of the four beasts saying come
[1:56:34] and see
[1:56:36] he's going to hear it the way God wanted
[1:56:38] him to hear he's going to see it the way
[1:56:40] God wanted to see it verse three and we
[1:56:46] had opened the second seal I heard the
[1:56:49] second beast say come and see
[1:56:53] it's God revealing his world amen and
[1:57:00] has he dealt with John he's dealing with
[1:57:02] us
[1:57:03] and see amen but you got to come and
[1:57:07] then he'll reveal to you his will
[1:57:09] he's worked so when he had opened the
[1:57:12] second seal I heard the second and
[1:57:14] beasts saying come and see
[1:57:17] verse five and when he had opened the
[1:57:20] third seal I heard the third beast say
[1:57:23] come and see a man God wants us to come
[1:57:27] but not just come he wants us to see a
[1:57:31] man he wants us to catch the revelation
[1:57:35] of God and the will of God for our lives
[1:57:36] and his will for our lives by the grace
[1:57:39] of God hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:57:42] something else I'll highlight just in a
[1:57:43] moment here concerning the scriptures
[1:57:46] were reading so when he had opened the
[1:57:49] third seal I heard the third beast say
[1:57:53] come and see and I beheld and lo a black
[1:57:59] horse and he that sat on him had a pair
[1:58:02] of balances in his hand and verse seven
[1:58:05] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[1:58:08] heard the voice of the fourth thing
[1:58:10] beast say come and see
[1:58:13] I trust were seen as God wants us to see
[1:58:18] the seals but God wants to get your
[1:58:24] attention
[1:58:25] yeah let's not just come you got to come
[1:58:29] on to him but didn't you got to hear him
[1:58:31] then you got a bill even see what he
[1:58:34] wants you to see and so on it's all
[1:58:37] there in the book in the Gospel of John
[1:58:39] concerning come unto me come and see
[1:58:42] come and see I don't know if you notice
[1:58:45] that it was verse one and one is
[1:58:49] absolute just one
[1:58:53] then it was verse three perfection in
[1:58:59] the Bible three means perfection
[1:59:02] and in verse five five is Grace and
[1:59:08] seven is completion a man so I went from
[1:59:14] the fourth seal right on through to this
[1:59:16] to the to this where he went on through
[1:59:19] to the fourth but why is the fourth what
[1:59:22] we called the fourth completion because
[1:59:24] the public are dilated the fact he said
[1:59:27] that this is the first seal the second
[1:59:29] seal and the third and the fourth under
[1:59:34] the fourth seal he said the seventh seal
[1:59:36] is broken amen and he said though he
[1:59:39] said the Lord comes down he said with
[1:59:42] the revelation of the mystery of God a
[1:59:43] man to the Gentiles and the gospel going
[1:59:47] back to the Jews and brother every
[1:59:50] rehearse
[1:59:51] saw something in our lives concerning
[1:59:53] prophecy being fulfilled we can say God
[1:59:55] is fulfilling that prophecy he's going
[1:59:57] back to the Jews he's leaving the
[2:00:00] Gentiles and he's going back to the Jews
[2:00:03] grace of God to us
[2:00:05] a man so thank God that we had opened
[2:00:10] the fourth seal the voice said come and
[2:00:12] see and what did he see he said behold a
[2:00:16] pale horse and his name that sat on him
[2:00:18] was death and hell followed with him and
[2:00:23] power power was given unto them over the
[2:00:26] part of the earth and to kill with the
[2:00:28] sword with hunger with death with beasts
[2:00:30] of the earth and so on that was the
[2:00:34] revelation of the Antichrist
[2:00:36] it wasn't Christ it was the revelation
[2:00:39] of the Antichrist even the prophecy one
[2:00:41] time he said thought it was it was
[2:00:43] Christ no he's a Santa Christ amen god
[2:00:47] help us to believe that we have come and
[2:00:51] now we see we have heard God's way of
[2:00:54] hearing and we're seeing what God wants
[2:00:56] us to see amen one more scripture
[2:01:00] revelation 22
[2:01:11] and verse six and he said unto me these
[2:01:18] sayings are faithful and true and the
[2:01:20] Lord God of the Holy Prophets sent his
[2:01:22] angel to show unto his servants the
[2:01:25] things which must shortly be done behold
[2:01:29] I come quickly blessed is he that
[2:01:31] keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of
[2:01:33] this book and I John saw these things
[2:01:37] and heard them and when I had heard and
[2:01:39] seen I fell down to worship before the
[2:01:42] feet of the angel if we hear it and see
[2:01:45] it the way God wants us to hear it and
[2:01:47] see it we're going to fall down and
[2:01:49] worship you definitely a man I fell down
[2:01:55] to worship before the feet of the angel
[2:01:57] which would show me these things and
[2:02:00] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[2:02:02] for him thy fellow-servant and of thy
[2:02:04] brethren the prophets and of them that
[2:02:07] keep the sayings of this book worship
[2:02:09] God I trust were numbered with those
[2:02:11] that are keeping the sayings of the book
[2:02:13] and worshiping God by the grace of God
[2:02:17] amen it was the Prophet acknowledging
[2:02:21] the John it is the truth but we got a
[2:02:24] worship God and we'll keep the sayings
[2:02:27] of the book brothers are going to keep
[2:02:29] the sayings of the book you're going to
[2:02:31] hear it the way that God wants you to
[2:02:32] hear it and see it the way God wants you
[2:02:34] to see it a man it will bring us to
[2:02:36] obedience a man so brother especially in
[2:02:41] this age were in the false Antonius so
[2:02:44] close to the true knowing that it would
[2:02:46] deceive the very elect if possible be on
[2:02:49] your guard don't assume this is the
[2:02:52] message or this is the message the this
[2:02:54] brother is preaching the message that
[2:02:55] one's preaching the message you better
[2:02:56] be careful because it could be 99% truth
[2:02:59] and 1 percent false be on your guard
[2:03:04] and knowing that he warned the false
[2:03:06] prophets false apostles false this
[2:03:09] rising they would deceive the very elect
[2:03:11] if possible that's how close it's going
[2:03:15] to be the grace of God be with us
[2:03:18] we'll continue to walk in the light be
[2:03:21] led by the spirit so that we're gonna
