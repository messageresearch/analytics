may you just touch each heart and soul that's listening lord may it find lord of fertile betting ground we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen and amen amen thank you brother paul i appreciate that amen turn in the scriptures if you would to colossians 1 colossians 1. god bless you welcome each one back it's good to see some different faces that haven't been here a while brother chad sister lily sister rebecca and then brother josh back and amends good to good to have each one of you here this morning amen colossians chapter 1 and verse 12 it says giving thanks unto the father which had made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature that is god's first purpose revealed right there verse 16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence that's god's second purpose for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven that you who were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now had he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and made a minister that's god's third purpose is brother branham todd amen you can have your seats this morning god add his blessing to the reign of his word and i want to continue on our series on thy kingdom come but i want to take a different path this morning and we're certainly going to be teaching this morning not preaching by god's grace and we know that teaching positionally places us brother branham said so this is where we get down and again it's a rubber meets the road type of of service i think and but we focused a lot on attitude and spirit in the last few services and not just of course our sisters but to all of us as believers as parts of the body but today we want to move past that idea of the attitude the attitude is critical and if you have the wrong attitude brother braham says god can't do anything with you you can be wrong but have the right attitude and god has something to work with but if you've got the wrong attitude but you think you're right in your doctrine god can't work with you because you're unteachable amen but this morning as i said we're going to be focusing again on the sisters and i want to take a title of true womanhood now when we start talking about womanhood and true by true i mean scriptural word-based womanhood amen so this is what the word says about our sisters this is not about what i think or what other people think we're going to be sticking purely to the scriptures and the quotes on these things but the even the idea of womanhood because what we have today is a is a mentality that women can do anything and quite frankly women can do almost anything they can't father a child but aside from that physically there's just about nothing that they can't do but when we talk about womanhood womanhood is the essence or true state or condition of being a woman it's what makes a woman a woman and not a man and that's what we want to focus on this morning amen is what it means to truly be a scriptural woman to be a word-based woman to be stepping into that role and then god has a vision god has a plan god has a purpose for all of us and he has entrusted women with virtues with responsibilities with roles that only they are supposed to do and in some cases only they can do properly amen and god god has set it up so that no man can take a woman's place and then just as no woman can take a man's place when he's in his position nor can he take her out of her take her position when she's properly in it as well amen and brother brown gets into it there are aspects of life that are solely meant for women and that is what makes them women scriptural women it's what brings them into a place of true womanhood and if she can stay in that place that god has ordained her then she will be blessed beyond belief amen same as a man would now i want to start with a couple quotes that brother branham has here and he says i think a woman is a wonderful thing and a mother especially but they should be in their places and not take the place of a man and not take the place of god so he says it's amazing place to be as long as you're in your place the next one he says the i have the highest and deepest the deepest and highest respects for women my mother is one and my wife and i have young daughters and a woman that keeps her place and is a lady there is nothing any more precious outside of salvation to our nation than a real woman he didn't say than a real man he said than a real woman that's a very special place to be that's an elevated place to be that shows the type of importance it has for our le our sisters and our women in the church to stay in the place that god has called them to be he says i think a woman that's genuine is a jewel praise god for a real woman you're god's hands made but a real woman is like a real man they'll follow the word of god regardless of what the devil says or any false thing he's pointing back to eve when she got out of that place then we've got a problem amen but it shows here the elevated position of women when they are in their god-given place when they step into the role that god has called them to be then it's a blessed place and he even goes as far as to say that they're a real jewel he calls them the fifth gospel and we'll get in later he even says they're the backbone of a nation is real womanhood amen now we've talked about before how when we were in the old testament the role of a woman was primarily to have children and that was the only role and we'll see as we go through the scriptures that it does focus primarily on women in a family role or in a relationship role because that is the perfect type of christ in the bride amen so what we go through here when we focus on womanhood that womanhood is going to circle around the family that's the way it is because and we'll see why that is as we get there but again we don't want to exclude those that are single whether single by calling or single just by by circumstance for now but we find that there's a place where we have we actually have three roles in the scripture and we have we have men and we have women and their roles are distinct and separate now there can absolutely be crossover where a man can help a man can help a woman and a woman can help a man in their role especially in a marriage in these things but we also have a third right here and it's what the scripture calls a eunuch and so they are not defined in what they do in life by a man or a woman but they are actually a type of the angels in heaven where they have no they're not it's not that they're genderless it's that they are not giving life they're not giving something to themselves but rather they're giving their life completely to service and this is where our single brothers and sisters will fit in and that's a calling that is not a choice that's a calling that god puts in their life when paul talks about it and jesus talks about it so you have most of us are called to be men and women in the gender roles and and with a family and whatnot but we have a special group of people that are called to be eunuchs paul talks about it and jesus talks about and he says if you can handle it this is the place that you want to be for the kingdom safe because we remember when we started in the old testament it was be fruitful and multiply and then once we got into the new testament it switched to what go ye into the out into the all the world and preach the gospel it was about spiritual lives now it's not about natural lives so there's a special place for people that are focused solely and purely not just on bringing natural life into the world but bringing spiritual life in the world and those are eunuchs unto god is is the way it's defined amen so there is a place for being single and there's a place for being married and being in relationships and these things but the primary role in the primary description is always given to men and women in relationship and typically in marriage of course because that's the perfect type of christ in the bride god wanted a family god didn't want eunuchs he wanted a family he had all the eunuchs he had all the angels they were not reproductive or anything like that he had those but he wanted something else so we see that true manhood and true womanhood are reflected in a relationship not in being single but there is a place for being single and it's a special place as well amen now i'm going to take us back to the message crisis and mystery of god reveal because it holds the key to all of this when we start to look at these things but i'm going to move quickly because i've covered it before so i just want to set a bit of a foundation this morning and then we'll we'll start to move into this this thought on true womanhood now brother branham talks about the threefold purpose of god in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says sorry let me come back to this quickly he says god has chosen an elected lady which is his bride she's elected i hope we're members of that tonight across the world the illustration here showing the relationship of bride to christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how she would be brought to him the church here an illustration that we got in view is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always a type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god always if you'll watch watch the conditions and the conduct of women and you'll see where the church is we've read this before he says now some of these remarks may seem strange to some of you but it's complementary to the message that i have from the lord that i'm trying to get to the people see you watch everything in the natural how it's happening nature and watch it it runs sure with the spiritual also now if you'll see the conduct of the woman in the world today watch the conduct of the worldly church today just watch of course now there's also the conduct of the spiritual bride the church see watch that also so what we wanted to point out there is that he's saying that christ you have a christ type and then you have a bride type and that's why when we talk about womanhood it's always reflected in a bride type not in a single woman type amen the woman is typed as a bride of christ not a woman of christ she's not a widow she's not a single woman she's always typed as a bride and that's why true womanhood is found in that bride position amen that's what eve was to adam she was a part of him it was two parts of one whole if we look at that now we started out with that first scripture in in colossians and that's a bit of a weird scripture to start with to talk on true womanhood because it doesn't mention anything about womanhood in there but it's the type that brother branham brings out in the in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed where he shows the threefold purpose and if we can catch the threefold purpose of god then we know that as as christ as the bride or as the husband then the bride is going to be a part of the threefold purpose of god amen that she's going to have a role and a responsibility within that and we'll see that in the spiritual and then we'll see it in the natural for our sisters to see so he says here he says the first purpose of god as revealed in the scriptures to express himself completely god in christ so there's a revealing that happens first and then he says when i see god's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminences the oversight and the leading so there's an initial revealing of christ and then there's an ongoing revealing of himself not only to the people but in the people amen it's an ongoing event people today should be able to see christ as clearly as they did when he was here 2000 years ago because he's continuously revealing him to those that are his bride amen but after this they move on to the second purpose of god which is to have the preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them all right so that's not just a position of revealing now that's a position of intimacy and relationship and trust that causes something to come out amen the effect of the accepted revealing of christ to somebody leads christ to have the preeminence in somebody if you've truly accepted christ if you've truly seen a revelation of christ it's going to have a further effect in your life because many there saw jesus as a man of god remember nicodemus comes to him and says we know that thou art sent from god right but all of the pharisees and the sadducees saw that he was a man from god but it didn't stop them from trying to kill him why because they did not see it they did not have a full revelation of who he was there was no intimacy there there was no opening of who he truly was to them they just saw there's something different about him it's of god but we hate it right and that's where it stopped is they hated it because it exposed them for who they were and brother braham says this because the effect of christ in you is a new birth amen he says it's jesus christ the new birth revealed in you that he has the preeminences that he might express his words and anything that he's promised in these last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working so i we are as we've heard many times we are his hands and feet we are his voice and he works through us and that's what he's looking for is the preeminence the relationship of trust to where he can ask us to do something and we would do it without adding to it or taking away from it amen that we would speak only the word speak only what he's told us to do do only what he's told us to do when he tells us to do it and everything else will be left alone he says amen it's just exactly the word of god may manifest so what is it now you're not just bringing forth your life or your thoughts or your ideas but you're bringing forth his life in you amen and that's when you know that you have the preeminence inside of you it is and this also then moves to bring what other new births within the church brother brahm says if there are no new births in the church then the church is dead amen so we have to have new births we have to have converts coming in our children have to be getting the holy ghost otherwise what there is no relationships that's happening because with true intimacy life always comes forth eventually amen it may not come forth the first time but eventually if a man and a wife are intimate then life is going to come forth isn't it there's no denying it and you can't hide it because a birth always happens afterward then we have the third purpose and he says it is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talk with them and fellowship with them there so the end goal of all of this is to restore full fellowship back with the bride in christ to take us back to our eating condition because you remember at the very beginning it was just christ coming down and walking with adam in the cool of the evening and the serpent didn't walk the animals didn't walk there was nobody there but christ and his bride right and he's bringing us back to the place where it will only be his voice that we hear and all else's will be turned away so what we have here just to kind of put it on a on a a list here is we have the threefold purpose so one is the complete revealing of god to the bride through christ the second one is what to have the preeminence which is complete headship in the bride right and then the third one is to restore complete fellowship with the bride where it's just us and christ so if we see then if that is the purpose of god that there has to be some sort of role or response from the bride as that purpose is rolling out right because if he's if he's doing something if he has a purpose and that purpose has to be reflected in the bride because we see here that it's all in the bride that he's working he's trying to bring her back to some place so we should see a response we should see an effect in the bride with each stage as he goes through this right so the first one was the complete revealing of god to what the bride through christ so if there is a revealing there has to be somebody to recognize and accept who has been revealed to you and that's where we make a choice of headship in our life now we know that we are predestined to this but we also know that you can have salvation in christ without ever having the word inside of you amen those that believe they shall be saved right and they're the ones that are outside the city and these different things but for the true bride there is a spiritual response and that's we make a choice of headship in our life and that's when we give our life to christ amen that's when we come to the altar we repent and we're baptized and then we stay there until we receive the gift of the holy spirit right that's where we say i'm going to follow that and i'm going to leave everything else beside everything else goes to the side including myself amen we're going to put myself i'm going to choose to put myself under this head ship because i identify with it now the second thing is he's supposed to have complete and total preeminence which is complete headship amen now the second purpose of this was to get that preeminence so if he does that then god isn't just looking to have headship in us but he's looking to have headship with purpose and then god doesn't do this just to have you know robots or automatons in this world but he wants somebody that has such a tight relationship with him that he can trust her to do what he has asked her to do what he needs her to do because god is moving through our hands and our feet and our lips and these different things amen so what is he doing he's looking for a life that will reflect what she has accepted because if you have accepted headship then intimacy always follows and so the proof of that is that life comes out of you and it brings more and more life out of you amen and we know that the life never lies because if i if my wife is with another man then the dna doesn't match does it if we do a test of that baby then it's going to not be my wife plus john it's going to be my wife plus somebody else and it's no no different with the life of christ brother branham says the very life that he lives you have to live also otherwise it's another life that you have inside of you amen brother braham says this he says we have his name is that right we should bear his name and remember we are now as his bride pregnanted with his spirit oh my the church bearing children see pregnant by his spirit and his name bearing his name and bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminences evidence of his resurrection showing that he's not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him he says he says how do you know because you're a church member he says because christ is living through you so pregnant with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you bring forth is that because you're a prisoner amen so he says you're not just bringing on life in your own walk but you're bringing what life to others as well you're a witness of christ to the world and that means that new lives will come out of your life as well and it's a cycle that never ends and like i said a church that's not having new births is dead amen i was watching a church the other day and somebody brought up a name and i looked it up and and all it was was old people in the church and i thought there's a problem there if the only young people are the pastor's kids and everybody else's kids have left we've got a problem don't we because it means that there's no new births happening something's wrong in that church because new births have to keep coming through amen and then the third purpose as we saw was to have true fellowship with his bride like it was in the in the garden of eden and so if god's looking for that then what is the bride's response to that the bride's response is that she will keep herself pure from outside influence or intimacy amen i've written here that she'll say yes to the word and no to all else so we'll cut ourselves off from every single influence relationship habit and medium maybe i should say media that is contrary to the word of god which is our husband so we'll take everything and put it aside and say i will only heed what the word of god says you know i was talking i think the last service about about healing and my sister and she you know when she got healed from cancer she didn't put anything in her house didn't put anything in front of her she didn't watch any movie she didn't read casual books she didn't do anything except she listened and read the word of god and that was it and that brought healing because it brought faith to her that what it was talking about was her and it's the same thing we're looking for here you're not going to get to the third place if you're feeding yourselves on the wrong things if you're dwelling on the wrong things it's going to put a different spirit inside of you and that gives satan an open door into your life right brother bran now now don't think for a second that other things aren't going to try and force their way in that's satan's job and he's really good at it but we do not willingly bring that into our lives into our homes in front of our faces but rather what we have to fight the battle as satan tries to introduce it into our lives that we keep it away and keep ourselves pure to the word so that there's no other life that's trying to come inside of us amen brother braham says this he says god wants another adam that stands with the word and him alone the word alone the word is right regardless he says now coming from the holy spirit what has come so he says after he gives you the holy spirit what comes next he says then he will give to you supernatural faith spiritual faith that's here at the bottom then that spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good that only knows the word why because your faith is in the word and so your faith will only respond to the word so if you put something other than the word in front of you it will not cause faith to rise up what is the devil's faith the devil's faith is unbelief so if you're unbelieving it's because you've let the devil put something in front of you that you're responding to but if you put the word in front of you then your spiritual faith will rise up brother branham says he says it doesn't matter what anybody else says it won't do no good that only knows the word if somebody says the days of miracle is past that faith only knows the word we're praying for sister laura collins she's dead if god doesn't touch her and you know what she turned down a treatment this week that they said will give her an extra amount of lives but they said it'll cause you problems down the road she said what do i need that for as you guys might have read the email this morning if god's going to heal me then why would i put something in that's going to cause me problems down the road and she's resting on the faith that god is giving her through the word amen there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost you look at some of these churches i watched a a portion of a service that that popped up the other day of a denominational church and it was dead as door nails and i thought what a shame because the commitment is there the people are showing up for service they're they're they're giving what they have excuse me but there was no life there it was like i was transported back to the 1700s again because they hadn't moved on as the word of god moved on amen and what they have no recognition of what it means to have the baptism of the holy ghost because they're back at justification and that's all they have and their their very worship reflects it the very words they preach it all reflects that they've only come to justification they haven't moved on to the sanctification baptism of the holy ghost so what you they would say there is no such thing they might say there is but they have no idea of what it is and if you told them what it was then they wouldn't accept it because they hadn't been there amen that faith only knows the word that's real spiritual faith you see now listen to this one he says now you'll never be able to get anything from god and have favor with god my brothers and sisters wherever you are until we fully obey the word of god we say amen but listen to this last bit he says you make yourself miserable by just half-heartedly approaching it halfway christianity is the most miserable place a person can be it's like being married half the time but only having the negative sides of marriage that's what it's like is because they're never going to have the positives in a halfway thing because you'll go in and come out as things are easy or as things look good and whatnot and you'll leave when things get hard and you'll never experience growth you'll never experience the the amazing relationship that comes with fighting through difficulty and then those difficulties tie you together and if you walk away every time things get tough then guess what your relationship doesn't go anywhere and it's no different with god if we keep turning away as things get tough as he calls us into a closer walk with him as he calls us to trust them further further if we turn away to the arm of flesh then we're never going to get all the way there and what is it it's a half-hearted christianity it's a half-hearted approach to prayer well i'll pray about it but if that doesn't work then i'll go to the bank and get a loan if that doesn't work then i'll move here if no no no commit yourself holy to god and stand still and see the salvation of the lord amen why because the real relationship with god brings you to a place where you're resting trusting and solely believing on the word of god that's where we rest that is our place of rest that's our pavilion that we that he talked about in psalms is the word of god is a shelter over us amen the bride has full relationship when she only hears one voice one voice and that's it and that's what her bridegroom which is christ the word and until then she's miserable you'll be miserable if you're listening even to mostly the word and something else because they are at conflict and you don't have rest when you have conflict of what you're listening to so we have to find that place where we're only listening to the one thing what is it we talked about that rest you know when and and it said you know if you are are like like abraham or you're like sarah who what they they they weren't uh worried with any amazement they were at rest about it and brother bam talks about what happens he says he says notice this character he's talking about women that aren't at rest he says notice this character when you see women just go on the rampage just doing anything they want to watch the church is doing the same thing notice but when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival what is a revival a revival is a separation from the things of the world and are coming back to the word he says how she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of god watch then again you see how that the scriptures that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride and catch that woman elect that word you see women go on a rampage do you know the scripture talks about women going on a rampage and you know what kind of women it was devout and honorable is what the scripture says and there's two places where they got where they went on a rampage and you know what the first one was it was against the the apostles and the new gospel of jesus christ that's the first time they got stirred up the scripture talks about devout and honorable women these were the these were the the senior women in the jewish churches back then the ones that had the influence among you know the the aged women the respected women and they got stirred up against the gospel but then we see they get stirred up later and it is for the gospel both listed as devout and honorable but one was stirred up against the word and the other one was stirred up for the word and then we can't rest on what our we can't rest on our laurels we want to make sure that we're always truly devout and honorable to the word not just to our position or our ideas or our reputation and these different things amen but catch the difference here he says when they're off the word when they're not at rest they go on a rampage but when you're in a revival now you're submitting yourself and you're coming back and lining up with the word of god amen why because you're coming back to a place of rest a place where you're settled amen brother brown said this he said she's a type who the bride she has the same precious virtues by spirit given to her to preserve the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything of the world or anything stay virgin to the word as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband it's a sacred trust to honor her lord's word above every man-made creed wisdom denomination there is the church is given that trust now listen to this he says what is a prostitute because he's showing us the opposite of what it means to be a pure and virtuous bride he says some woman that lives untrue to her husband but watch how he defines it he says claiming to be a christian church and giving out wrong doctrine her own stuff instead of taking god's holy word so she has a message she has an idea she has a thought that is contrary to the word and what makes her a prostitute is that she starts to spread her stuff instead of his stuff that's what makes her a prostitute she's not taking his life she's trying to give her own to somebody else amen so that's the big picture that's the threefold purpose of christ and then we have the threefold response of the bride to those things now when we start to talk about true womanhood we'll see that it fits beautifully inside of those three things again amen because if god has a natural plan or a spiritual plan then there ought to be a natural plan that types right along with it as well now listen to what brother branham says because he talks about the the sacred virtues and trusts and responsibilities of women so he sets us up here and he says what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sake of responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to christ just the same as the woman has amen so after all of this there's one thing i want you to see in this and that's that the bride does not lead okay everything is is started by christ and it's responded to by the bride the bride does not initiate christ initiates and then the bride says yes or no and as soon as she says yes then she's bound to go through all the way to the finish amen but she's not leading she's responding to leadership when it comes to these things and that's where the attitude comes in and that's that's where we see that in order to get all the way there she has to follow his leading she cannot leave herself to that amen as we read in the in the last service of this series he's bound to her because she is not just a part of him but she is him that's literally what it says is she is him she's not a part of him she is him she's just in a separate body and then what we have is we have the union of christ the head with the body and now they're one and the same and that's why we didn't have to have the sun and the moon in the new heavens the new earth and the new jerusalem was because the type has already been fulfilled you don't have to have a son to move because now they're one in the same thing amen why what is it she's going to stay with the word because what he's given her will meet the need that's where her trust is amen now let's take it back to the scriptures we're going to go now to the to the natural side of things and titus 2. and paul says this he says but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine so this is the sound doctrine that paul is going to share now he says that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound and faith in charity and impatience then he says the age of women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things so our older sisters are supposed to be teachers of good things and i want you to notice that this is where you end up this is not where you start you do not start out as aged you do not start out as as all of these things with the the perfect behavior and the ability to teach you come to a place where you can teach but first you have to learn and grow and experience the reality of the world before you have the authority to teach these things as we've said before young men don't teach sideways no they only teach down and they never teach up and it's the same thing for young sisters they can teach down to children they do not cheat they do not teach laterally and they definitely don't preach up because you have to have a life by experience that proves that you know what you're talking about amen we can all read the bible we can all read the bible and see the truth of it but we have to live the truth before we can teach the truth because you'll find and i have found in myself that what you think the word means sometimes is not really what it means when you get down to a real life experience and then you start trying to talk about love without having an experience with christ and without going through a few hardships you don't know love until you go through and you deal with a situation where it seems like you can't love somebody but you fight through to that place where brother bram says you get down in your prayer closet and you kneel down you pray until god gives you a revelation of what's causing it he says and then you bring them before the throne of grace rather than cursing them amen how are you going to preach about love if you've never experienced that how are you going to talk about marriage if you've never been married how are you going to talk about parenting if you've never parented right we all have a chuckle because when we start our marriages i've said it before we say i'm not going to be like the other people and then we're all like all of the other people aren't we then we say i'm not going to make the mistakes my parents did and then we go and make the mistakes the mistakes our parents did right why because we all have to learn and grow and while we might have a head knowledge of it the funny thing is life experiences slip in really quickly and it catches the unawares and you end up doing the exact same thing that you didn't want to do sometimes we learn most times we have to go through it by experience and that's why we teach is because we have an experience not because we've read the bible so what are they supposed to teach the young woman it says that they teach the young women to be sober you have to be taught to be sober you have to be taught to love your husbands and to love their children so like i said notice it's something that you learn you are born knowing it all you learn you grow you mature and you get better at it guess what when that baby comes out mama you don't instinctively know how to do everything that's required when you get married you don't instinctively know everything you need to do as a husband or as a wife to meet the needs of your spouse and to do things right you have to learn and grow and that is by teaching it is by teaching of the elders in the church the elder women and the elder men and of times it's our parents typically that will that if we can humble ourselves and say i'm struggling then they'll say oh yeah i've been through that here's what you do and we do it magically it works and we move on with life and now we have an experience to match what we've talked about right but this is something we grow and we learn at so if you're not there take heart you're not supposed to be when he gave you the holy ghost you have the potential for everything but we don't just have a download of every single action and response that we need in life every bit of knowledge that's supposed to be there no we grow and learn it's a time thing it's not something we get immediately but listen to what else they have to teach them to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blaspheme so the purpose of all this sound doctrine is to do one thing and that's to keep the word of god from being blasphemed in other words to keep from bringing a reproach on the word of god now that's something for all of us that's not exclusive to the sisters by any means is that our life is supposed to keep from bringing a reproach on the word of god amen it's like i said before the defining role as we typically see it for women is always related to marriage and family and that's where paul typically goes that's where jesus went that's where the different ones go there's a place outside of that but inside of this is really what we're going to be looking at is the type of the bride and christ amen like we said before there are those that are called to be single and with them they are not excluded from all of this but rather their energy is given now to pleasing christ rather than pleasing their husband and same with the men that are they're a eunuch to correct to god they are not now to please their wives but they're to please christ i mean their their soul focus everything they're doing is to meet the needs and the purpose of christ whereas when you get married as paul says about it or jesus talks about it he says that what you're committed to to working with your spouse to meeting their needs before god that's a that's it's through christ that we live and have these relationships but he says you've got a commitment now that you've got to meet and it takes away your energy and time and that's your bigger focus in life is to is to make that marriage and relationship work but let's start with a simple quote here to get us moving he says a woman is entrusted with certain characteristics that she must not defile a woman is trusted to that and there's not a creature on earth like a woman he says the woman has got a great place it's a sacred nice wonderful place but she must keep herself that way to hold her office as she should as a mother as a woman and of womanhood when the womanhood is broke the backbone of any nation is broke and that's the reason today our nation is ruined is because of the immorals of our women that's exactly right sure it's the rottenness among us what's breaking it he says what you need is to meet this melchizedek one time amen let him bless you and give you the wine that bread eternal life then you'll see things different then it'll be different so he says we that our sisters have a special set of characteristics or virtues or trusts that are special to her and her alone and she's to guard and protect those and it's what makes her unique and special so he says notice this is the invisible union now that's committed to her sacred virtue and sacred womanhood and then sacred motherhood and then to honor her husband he says now we find out that she's been given the sacred trust that she must not break of womanhood act have her character raise her children to be honorable to her husband now i want to break each one of those down a little bit to make kind of make it obvious about what he's talking about there and had to spend some time because he blends things together and you start to wonder which one is which because he says there's three but he lists five or six in some of these these things so he breaks it down as he goes through the service amen but i want you to to just realize that these are things that he calls characters characteristics virtues and trusts that strengths and things that are committed to you to take care of and then so there's something that's special about these things and and and this is a special role that us us men can't identify with because while we have it in type to christ we don't carry it physically emotionally and these things the way our sisters do so they are they really get into this in a way that that we don't we don't have to deal with in the same way and it's it's a tough place to be i'm sure amen now so the first thing that brother brahm says you start with is your womanhood and he says that is the way you act and your character and he says it's reflected physically in your body so he says here but because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a sacred charge from god for redemption but she's got characteristics that she must not defile if she would marry them she is defiled for lifetime no matter how much she is forgiven she can't be justified now remember justified means what you never did it in the first place but he says physically a woman cannot be justified again she can't go back to the way she was okay once her once her once that virtue is broken in her body if i could put it that way in a mixed crowd once that virtue is broken there's no fixing it again right the proof is there and she can't go tell another guy oh yeah i've only been with you right the physical proof is already evident in her body and she can't go back and fix that again right he says i'll strike that in a little bit i've got a scripture on that in a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement but she cannot be justified in this life it's always with her notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified he says her body is given to her a sacred trust from god no female dog no bird no other animal no other creature is like that no she's the only one and i looked it up and there is no other female creature on the planet that has all of them the same physical proof and body of virtue it's only the woman that has that and that's an amazing thing and there's no real reason for it except for what the scripture says and that's that it is a virtue to her and it's given to her above all other creatures right it's an amazing thing it says the reason it's so sacred she is to bring forth life into the earth her body is the betting grounds of life therefore that's the reason she is give this sacred trust she has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman right that's committed to her by god and she must not defile that virtue amen eve did and it caused the whole world to go into sin that's why he says you're not supposed to break it why because there's a power and an influence available to woman to use that virtue as a temptation to a man right and eve succumbed to the sensuality of the serpent and gave that to him and it caused us all to go into a fall and now women have realized that there's pop well they realize it for a long time it's nothing new but they've realized that they have a power to offer that thing to a man and it's something that will draw him and give her power over him but it's not what she's meant to do she's supposed to save it for the one that she chooses rather than give it to a man to have power over him amen so they're called to bring for life and the virtue is for a woman is that she will accept a man and let him alone bring life through her body amen a man can't force her she has to accept it and then no man has a right to force a woman to marry him he offers and then she accepts it amen and once she says yes to the one man she can't pretend later that she didn't say yes like i said the proof is in her body she can't go to the next man and say you're the first one i've ever been with because the proof is in her body right he says now notice now she has a sacred trust a virtue that's been given to her entrusted to her by the lord god gave her that virtue just as it was in the garden of eden she can say yes or no she has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her that she must not break the womanhood i'm speaking of here is her conduct her character around men now our sisters can have 10 offers of marriage ten proposals but she chooses whichever one that she wants right that's what brother brown says your virtue is in saying yes or no you get to make that choice any man can come up and make a proposal but it's up to you to say yes or no and until you say yes he's not allowed to touch you and you have a right to protect your virtue amen what is it the first test of womanhood for our sisters is keeping yourself set aside and saying no until the one time and the one man you say yes to amen amen so let's take it back to our threefold purpose because if we look here what we have was we had the revealing of god then we have a recognition and acceptance of that and then we take it to the natural type and the woman says yes or no to marriage and intimacy you get to choose that right every woman that's married in this church as far as i know had a choice right daddy didn't make her she chose to accept that husband's proposal amen so what i'm saying here she chooses who will be fully revealed to her and there's only one again mixed crowd you know what i'm talking about the adults doing man there's only one man that's going to be fully revealed to that woman and vice versa and she chooses who that man is and that's her first virtue amen then brother branham goes after this and he says look where hollywood's taking us he says he talks about you know they're slopping all over each other and kissing and and i don't even know if they ever had a movie where they had two people in the same bed i don't know if lucy you know i love lucy that if they got to that point but i mean these days everything is right you got p actors that aren't married sleeping in bed dude i mean it's total and completely animalistic filth that we have now but he says it started in hollywood and what it's done is it's numb the senses of the men and the women to the point where they see no virtue and holding yourself your body sacred right it's mine i can do with it you absolutely can but if you don't hold yourself true to this we see that in some populations in some areas young women there's a 25 percent std rate one in four that's scary why because they have such a promiscuous attitude because there's no virtue there they haven't recognized the sacredness of your body it's funny it's not funny it's interesting to me how there's so many things that we're protected by that have a physical effect in our bodies if we follow the word of god and one of those things is in this nature on the central side of things is that if you protect yourself and keep to one then you're almost generally never going to ever have a problem with those things if you choose one then you protect your body and your you protect your partner at the same time he says be in your heart and let christ have first place like the real woman would to her husband no other arms could touch her now nowhere so once she says yes no other man's supposed to hug her right no other kiss no matter how charming it looks she turned her head so every offer of it she turns her head she's got one set love and that's for her husband that's right no matter how handsome the man might be and how polished and slick his hair might look and how he might hold himself correct no sir not one thing she loves that husband and that's him alone does she love i know a sister that was going to see a doctor she's married and she felt an attraction to that doctor so you know what she did she stopped going to that doctor she cut it off nothing's going to stop us from having attractions and and temptations in life but what did she do she cut it off and said this could go a very bad place i'm making sure i never go in that bad place why because she knew her virtue was for her husband and she didn't even with the body saying yes everything in her says no that is not what i do and she cut herself off from that he says she forfeits all of her virtues and all of her kisses it's kind of a funny thing to say but what he's saying is physically she gives herself to no man all her lovings and everything is to her husband and him alone so see what i mean and you forfeit everything in the world no matter how good it looks how pretty it looks and how fascinating it looks your virtue is what you're counted by and then you say oh hallelujah i know i got it because i did this hallelujah he says enough temper to buy to fight a buzzsaw he's talking about christians that say i got it i got it i'm committed to christ and he says you got a temper that would fight a buzzsaw he says there's something wrong there because the life hasn't been changed yet he said let me tell you brother it takes virtue that christ respects he says you are born again of god you've got the beauty of the holy ghost to show that what you are you are what you say you are is what you are you've got virtue that these scandal skirts don't have that's right a real woman of god that stands out with virtue you might be laughed at and called old-fashioned but you've got something that they can't touch and you've done and they've done lost it and can never have it again that's right but he says you've got virtue that's what god looks for is virtue and once that woman says yes and she gives over that virtue to her husband life changes drastically because she's not allowed to take it back right she can't take it back and say no once she makes that commitment when he makes once he makes the offer and she takes it she's not allowed to take it back and it has to progress all the way to full intimacy there has to be a full revealing and there has to be a consummation of the marriage amen so what brother brown calls that he says is what he calls it sacred motherhood and that's when she bears her husband's children so she produces his life and she can prove it by the blood prove it by the dna amen that what his life was inside of her and only his life was inside of her and what come out of her then was exactly what went in which was him amen it confirms that the marriage has been fully consummated amen it's now not just intimate relationship but it's moved into new life and that's what we saw for the bride remember is that she brings forth a new life the same thing for a natural wife as she brings forth new life now listen to this we're talking about the sacred motherhood part now the second virtue he says adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness and with sobriety now we have to be real careful here because somebody will read that and say you're trying to equate marriage and having children to salvation and that's not what this word means this is not salvation that saves you this is not the salvation of calvary that we're talking about but this is a salvation that has an effect in your life and when you look up that word in the the root word it says this word is that she will be made whole she will be saved from destruction she'll be kept safe and sound and saved from the evils which keeps a person from accepting the gospel so is there something about raising children about having children that has an effect on the life of a woman and it is a positive thing and the scripture calls it saving it saves her and if i could put it this way oft times it saves her from herself now we'll continue on because paul talks about in titus 2 where we read in verse 5 it says they're teaching them to do what to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands again why that the word of god be not blasphemed because they're being taught in all of these things in marriage and having and raising children it's to keep them from what blaspheming the word of god in first timothy 5 it says i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully in other words don't bring a reproach on the word he says for some have already turned aside after satan and what brought a reproach on the word of god because why women running around without headship don't let generally get led to the word of god right they're supposed to be under headship and we've covered it in the in the last portion of the series we did where we talked to denominations which were typed by women and we talked about the requirements of those headship and we saw what happened with satan's queen is that she completely divorced herself from any sort of headship and she got to the point where she ruled all just before she's judged for it all and everybody that was with her gets judged along with it so she brings total destruction through her own headship amen what paul is saying here in these different places is it keeps her out of trouble that she might otherwise get into is that in the marriage and in the having children it puts her in a place that it takes up some of that energy that can be put into things that she shouldn't be into brother branham he says it's a great honor and a great respect for a woman to do this he says a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown she should be honored brothers how much do we honor our wives does josh get ready to honor your wife amen they ought to be honored they ought to be honored for what they do and as many of us know if you take care of your kids for a day or two while mom has gone on vacation or a week or two weeks as as some of us have had to do you get a much deeper respect for the amount of work and effort that goes into it it's no wonder that they can't get into trouble it's because they have no strength left after a day isn't that right sister rebecca isn't it you have to do everything listen i i when my day is done and i'm done work i might study for three or four hours but when it's still done i get to come upstairs and read a book but guess what my wife is going non-stop now she has the option to occasionally stop at times throughout the day and that but she wakes up early and she stays up late and it's all filled with dealing with the household and the children and and then taking care of her poor husband too right it's a non-stop job and brother brahm says you need to honor that woman that is an amazing role that she is in and she is giving her all to that she's giving her body to it amen our sisters they you know they're young and they're beautiful and they're fit and they do all these things and then what happens they have a baby and guess what they're never the same again they can never physically be the same again they can they can do everything they want they can do every type of surgery they can exercise guess what your body is never the same again after you bring forth life guess what our life is never the same again is it after we have a new birth isn't it right everything changes after that and you can never go back to it and brother brown says what this is an amazing place she's a jewel in a man's crown he says i've got thousands of christian sisters who i highly respect it's an amazing thing for these sisters that us brothers we don't have to deal with much in the in terms of the way the world looks at us but our sisters have a lot outwardly they have a lot amen and then the attitude that they're supposed to show and the responses that they have it's a tough place to be satan is going around like a roaring lion and our sisters are getting the brunt of it i do feel right it's a tough place to be he says but if they can respect what god made them motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that god could give a man he says in other places he says she is the best thing aside from salvation as we read he said was a wife there he says it beside salvation a wife is the best thing if she's a good wife see i read so many things i start to repeat them and not realize they're right there in my notes right he says but if she isn't if she isn't solomon said a good woman is a jewel in man's crown but an ornery one or a no good one is water in his blood what happens when water's in your blood your blood gets too thin and it can't it it just doesn't go the way it needs to go it's too thin it can't provide what it needs he says that's right it's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do it so when's the last time we did it brothers when's the last time we went out of our way to show respect and honor in front of our kids in front of the church however it might be to take the time to show her that you're honoring and respecting the time and effort and energy that she puts into it while expecting her to be perfectly respectful and submissive to you at the same time one thing to just do the work it's another thing to do with the right attitude tough place to be amen a real woman and children if you've got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean sending you to school teaching you about jesus you should honor that sweet old mother that's with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother he says the greatest honor a woman can do outside of coming to christ and being loyal to her husband is to have a baby now remember bringing souls to the kingdom is what's important what he says if you're a believing husband and wife then you're bringing forth we believe believing children now there's no guarantee of that but we would believe that if we were christians then we would have sons and daughters of god amen he says you might be nursing a little preacher how do you know praise the lord right you might bring one life but that out of that one life could come what a million souls a hundred souls a thousand souls what doesn't matter one soul one more soul that you couldn't bear out of your body but because you had a child that would come and be a preacher or make a witness of it now they could bring more souls to christ he says hallelujah i know that's old-fashioned cornbread type but brother it'll stick to your ribs it'll do what you're dying it sure will brother brahm talks about that just for the sake of time i didn't put it all in here but he talks about there's built into a woman a need and a desire to nurture and he says what happens is we've got women now that for the sake of their bodies for the sake of their looks for sake of their their position in society they'll refuse to have children he says and so what they do is they get a little puppy or something and they put all of their nurturing into that so that they can express that thing that's inside of them but still get away with having the life that they want right he says what is it they're they're they're shortchanging themselves right they don't realize the blessing that they lost because of it and there's a there's a modern research now that's showing that a recent research that's showing that greater and greater numbers of women that have committed themselves to a career based on what what schools are telling what mainstream media is saying they're saying go into careers go into careers go into careers and they hit about the age of 35 and they realize i'm not fulfilled and some of them get to great positions of power and influence and they make great money and they have a big impact on society but they get there and they say this isn't working and they're 35 years old and now they're trying to find a husband and they can't compete with the 21 and 22 year olds that are saying up front i want to get married and so what happens is the majority of them are having marriages of convenience where they find a like-minded man that focused on his career or wasn't attractive enough or making enough money or whatever and they're joining up and they're getting into a marriage of convenience where they will purely have children and that's all it's about they know they don't love each other they're not particularly attracted to each other but she needs that man to fulfill the womanhood side of her the motherhood side of her and he wants that wife for the physical side of things and whatnot and so they basically make a contract that he'll supply what she needs if she'll supply what he needs and there's no love in the relationship why because they ignored up front what god had built into them to produce in their life amen brother braham said womanhood is the one of the things that holds our nation together it's the backbone but all's not well as we know we look around and we see nations are breaking and nations have fallen apart they've fallen apart a long time and he points to the issue of motherhood he says our womanhood is broke motherhood of america has crashed the morals is as rotten as anything as any nation in the world what's the matter it's because they have loved the things of the world more than they love god and they got perverted exactly right what is it something has changed their vision something has changed what they want and it's focused them on something that's off the word of god he says and it broke the nation now we know that it happened originally when they went into world war one and all the men left and all the women went into the factories and so you had less children being born then you went into world war ii and then the women really started to realize we can do this they're trying to rebuild a nation and so they're starting to put more and more women into the workforce and as they did that they pulled away what motherhood not just womanhood now but motherhood and he says it broke the nation because now you have strangers raising your children or you're not having any children it's not tempering your life it's not helping you grow and mature because it's her salvation if she does it and so all of a sudden we've got all these problems in the nation amen what is it we've got a world of dinks now do you guys know what dinks are dual income no kids right you have a husband and a wife and they're both working they're making tons of money they're having a great life they're going on 17 vacations a year to exotic places that they they put on facebook and instagram to tell everybody what a wonderful life they have and they never have any responsibility except to each other and they never have children because they enjoy a life of pleasure and ease and that's exactly what it is boy if you're both working you can have a good life in this world amen you don't have to make a ton each but if together you're working together you can make 150 grand no problem every year and live a great life just about anywhere you know and what is it they get attached to that and so all of a sudden the family's put on hold and they never get around to it and they just grow old and fat and sassy and have a great life but braham says it's not what you're get it's not what marriage is about he says any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him amen you remember in the bible when the king married esther because the queen refused he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out with the king and obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be a wife to her husband now we don't have that problem obviously all of our sisters have children here we're not seeing that sort of thing but what you'll see is literally in the real world they'll say i'll marry you but we aren't having children and i'm getting fixed or you're getting fixed or we're both getting fixed to make sure it doesn't happen and they refuse to have a child with that man he says you can't do it she hasn't er why why would you be a wife he says if you would if you would refuse that but i want to show the other side of this that's a that's a hard thing to kind of end on here but i want to show you the real power of motherhood when you have a real commitment to to your husband and to your children this is in questions and answers it says brother branham you said on one of the tapes that noah saved his household does that mean a mother can have the same faith for her household and does that mean every one of the family will be saved if we believe it he says you'd have to watch the way i answer this now see first you said one of your tapes that noah saved his household why because they believed that's it because they believed in his message does this mean that a mother can have the same faith for her household yes sister i see a little mother's heart crying for a people and does this mean every one of the family will be saved if we believe it he says yes if they will accept it that's right remember the philippian jailer believe for both if you've got faith for your own enough faith for your own salvation can't you have that same faith that'll work upon your people what is faith it's an unseen force see it's a spirit the holy spirits bring faith see it's an unseen forth therefore it is the spirit of the lord on you mothers it is the spirit of the lord and when you've got the spirit of the lord in you to believe for your own salvation place that upon your family say i claim them in the name of jesus christ i claim it god i don't know how you're going to make her do it and how you're going to make him do it but i believe it i believe it lord help my unbelief claim it and watch what happens that it'll do it amen a mother has a as a heart for her children in a way a father just doesn't right because it is literally out of her right it's something that she nurtures and carries and attack it's attached to her for so long she's got something that she can go with that just men don't seem to have that same thing and then we're great on the provision side and protection all these things but when it comes to to getting down and and really bringing them before the throne of grace and that a mother's prayer brother bram talks so often about a mother's prayer and the power of a mother's prayer not a father's prayer a mother's prayer why because it's part of her virtue that god has given her he's given her a sacred thing that can take them before the throne of god in a way that nobody else can amen that's a position of power sisters that you can go before the throne of grace and god hears your prayer in a special way amen but there's a third thing that we saw and brother brahm says it's honoring your husband and we saw before it was keeping herself pure from outside influence or intimacy and in this one when we come to the natural it says she does not listen to any other man or follow her own personal thoughts or beliefs that's what it means to honor your husband it means to glorify and magnify him not yourself now that's a hard thing to do if you're always thinking about yourself right you've got to be looking to his vision you've got to be looking to your husband's purpose if i can put it that way god has a three-fold purpose the question is what is your husband's purpose now your sisters know us men are not known great for communication right not usually our strongest thing we don't like to sit down and talk for hours most of us some of us do right so what sometimes you have to determine what his vision is based on how he responds when you do certain things right you'll do a certain thing and all of a sudden your husband perks up he's like wow that was amazing that is so good and you're like you could have just asked me to do it i never thought to i didn't even know what i wanted sometimes us brothers right and the way it goes and then all of a sudden the wife does something right you're like wow i love you so much you always loved her she just got in line with a vision that you were unwilling to share you need to share that vision we can't blame our sisters or our wives if if they're not following through with what we want if we never tell them what we want if we're not clear in what we want what is our vision what is our purpose what is what is it that we want our money to be spent on what is it we want our energy to be spent on because otherwise they'll find all sorts of things to fill it but if it's not in line with the husband's will then you're going to have conflict inside the marriage so it's up to us as men to share what that purpose is for the marriage and for the family amen but that thing for for honoring him means that you don't based at you don't act based on what others think or believe or tell you that's the hardest thing sometimes and i remember my mom saying that she she tried very hard and she did well at it she said as soon as you got married i tried to back away so as not to try and influence you on what your marriage was going to be and how to do certain things if you asked that answer but she said i tried to pull away and let you do that why so that my wife and with my wife especially so that what she's not trying to influence my wife to go away without me saying that's the way i want to go right that's why the clear vision is required and now on the wife's side it's to close off her ears to every other bit of influence and say i'm sorry i have to stay with what my husband says and what he wants to be doing amen remember what brother branham said a prostitute was spreading your own stuff right so for honoring a woman it's when you're going around with your ideas and your thoughts and you're sharing that with everyone else and you're living that with everyone else and you're ignoring what your husband wants you to do he says that's a prostitute spirit that's doing that that's a hard thing to say and he says it makes you an unfaithful wife if you're focused on doing what you want and what you think is best rather than what your husband has asked you to do and of course the difficulty comes through when he says or says or wants you to do the wrong thing meaning that you disagree with his decision that's going to be the biggest struggle in a marriage is when a husband makes a decision and the wife doesn't agree with it and you've got to literally line up with that and move forward that doesn't mean you don't say i disagree with you and here's my reasons why and maybe you've got scriptures and quotes and all those things you're expected to do that if you feel he's off then you're supposed to do that but if he's going to move forward with the decision then you have to do that and you have to literally support him you do not undercut him right oh i don't like what john said you know block was go around saying yeah john did it i don't agree with it but i'm going to go with it no you don't even say i disagree with it you say that is my husband and i'm following my husband right you fight in the backyard and you agree in the front yard even if you know it's off that's the way we're supposed to do it and that's the the that's where the type is so difficult for sisters and for men alike is that we're in a fallen condition and we're trusting the holy spirit to lead and guide us but we still make wrong decisions we still get caught up in things we still get into things we shouldn't be into we make bad decisions go the wrong places go to the wrong church whatever the case may be we do wrong things all the time and the sisters have to sit there and bear that and suffer through it and trust that god will correct us quickly and in time and undo as much of that damages that's made as when we get there you know but i want to say this is that if the wife will do that it gives us tremendous insight into the husband because a wife that is fully submitted to her husband is the closest we'll ever get to a mirror for a man and you'll see far more through a man's wife than you often will through the man because she is a reflection of him if she's in submission and she's under that headshit so i wouldn't look at brother bob necessarily i'd look at sister brenda and say what does sister brenda put her time into because that's going to tell me what brother bob wants her to put it into same for sister leah right same for sister rebecca and these different ones we look at those women and we can see what does it matter to that husband because what she's putting her time into is what he's authorized her to do if she's in submission she's under head amen brother brown says this this is why i say to the sisters that you don't protect yourself in these cases you can't you have to let god do the protecting you stay in your position so that god can protect you so that god can answer the situation through your husband and with your husband directly and sometimes you're trying to keep him from getting hurt right they're not doing it always for selfish reasons sometimes they're saying honey this is going to hurt you don't do it and we do it anyways and we've got to be able to step back and say all right you get to make the call but watch this and here's the reason why sisters he says let me get this in right good now so you can see it a woman is subject to her husband the bible says a man should rule over his wife but how they've changed that the woman rules over the man now listen to what he says here now you stay home john you're not going now that could mean anything that could mean he's going to a bar that could mean he's going out for a guy's night out it could mean he's going out to play sports it could mean that he's staying late at work it could mean anything and he's saying the woman saying you don't go out he says she's not allowed to say that she shouldn't say that he says and that settles it yes my dear what is it the husband is whipped the woman is having control over the husband remember remember what we said about brian talk about the women going on a rampage if you threaten your husband to not do something you're on a rampage right because it falls to him to make the leadership decisions and you don't threaten him with something if he doesn't do what you want him to do that's taking that usurping authority over your husband okay he says but let me tell you something mister you're gonna have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you you are the head of the woman and god is the head of the man so sisters when you change that man's mind guess what you're stepping into his position but you never have to answer for it he answers for it because he let you do it and so you're actually putting him even if you're getting him to do the right thing if you're forcing him to do the right thing you're still out of your position it's the right reason wrong action you can't do it because he answers for the family not you you answer for did you give your input and if you did but you're not supposed to force it amen now if you believe this sisters you'll have rest even when you disagree that what he's going to answer for and so often we're motivated by love and concern and i understand that but often we're also motivated all of us by selfishness because it makes my life easier and i don't want to go through this and i don't want to go through that and that's where we really have to watch out is when we're looking up for ourselves rather than for the other person and that's the challenge for us as men is are we making decisions for the family based on what's easier for us as men as husbands as fathers are we making it for the good of the family and we talked about that with the brothers as we're supposed to be self-sacrificial in nature and that's what we do as christ did we do what's good for the others not just what's good for ourselves and that's what allow our wives to start to trust us more amen if we've got conflict in the in the marriage and in the family based on headship issues it's usually because the wife doesn't trust the husband because his track record isn't very good amen right once you start to get on the right path and once you start to make consistent word-based decisions you'll find that wife is so much happier to let you make the decisions but it's when you're fighting back and forth and she sees he's going into selfishness he's going into money he's going into this he's going to no no you got to stick with the word and make word-based decisions and that'll give your wife a fighting chance to submit to you a little more easily amen we want to set them up we want to set our wives up for success by what making sure we're right so we give them a chance to be right but the challenge in the test for the sisters is when he's wrong what will you do amen will you submit honor your husband means to do what he asks you to do even if you disagree with it now you don't ever go off the word brother adam is 100 clear on that right you don't get to you don't get to to just say well he's my husband i'll do anything no no your husband wants you to dress inappropriately he wants you to watch things you shouldn't watch if he wants you to do things you shouldn't do no sir you have the right to say i'm sorry i respect you and i love you but i don't have to do that because the word says i shouldn't do that everything else yes sir you have to do it day-to-day life all those things that belongs to him but you never go against the word but you better make sure it's the word and not just you as well amen true womanhood a beautiful type of the bride of christ with sacred virtues sacred trust to guard and cherish and to hold before god and your husband all of your life amen the backbone of a nation the fifth gospel true women the fifth gospel i've said it before i'll say it again he never calls men the fifth gospel he calls women the fifth gospel when they're in their place amen a beauty and a purity as he said that the world can never understand and can never attain because they've already given themselves to multiple men multiple influences multiple ideas all these different things amen but you have a special place of honor love trust beauty rest graciousness and glorification that even us men don't get to experience in the same way it's an amazing thing if you can come to that place of trust and rest like sarah did amen let's stand up if we would ask our musician to come forward now we're preaching anytime we talk about the sisters like we said before it applies to men as the bride of christ but we're asking the sisters to live out a type of the bride of christ and knowing that us brothers are called to be a type of christ they're the bride we're christ and how often we fail how gracious are we to be to our sisters amen that where they fall short where we think they fall short at least that we'd be gracious that we'd be as long-suffering as they often have to be with us amen amen that as our imperfection would cause us to go to the throne of grace and ask forgiveness and ask for god's longsuffering we ought to have the same thing that god would help them to grow and as he causes them to grow we'd be gracious that we would help them to meet that type that they're called to amen i mean god bless you let's just bow our heads this morning heavenly father lord you've given each one of us a place a purpose a role responsibilities lord but our sisters have a special place as we've read this morning lord you've elevated them above lord so that the world can see each one of them in a special place or to see how they've been set aside for your glory and for your honor heavenly father and lord it's a difficult road though nor believer gets away lord with a life of ease lord but they have a special battle that they face these days is it's a woman's nation lord trying to force them into different directions get them off the word of god lord get them into their own leadership and headship lord we pray that they would see the beauty that you've given them in the word heavenly father they would rest and trust lord that as they're in their marriages as they're in their relationships lord that they would grow that they would learn to trust you lord that you do all things well lord that you bring all things about for their good and lord that you'll take them all the way to a perfect end we pray lord as brothers lord may you help us in our leadership lord god lord that we would be humble in it lord that we would not be cocky or arrogant or think that we always do things right but lord that our humility would keep us lord in a place where we would be as gracious to them as we expect you to be with us lord bless them now we pray give them strength lord give them encouragement lord may they just see that you're lord working in their lives and calling them to an amazing place we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen i give my mind key of f i checked with your mother eleven twenty by the visual i'll hand it over to
