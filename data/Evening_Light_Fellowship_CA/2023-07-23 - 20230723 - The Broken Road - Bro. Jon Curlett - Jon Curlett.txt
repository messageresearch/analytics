Christ's name we ask it amen unless you turn if you would to Isaiah chapter 42 Isaiah 42. and then we welcome our brother Emmanuel all the way from Zimbabwe amen God bless you brother it's good to have you amongst us for as long as you'll be with us trusting that you'll be blessed and you'll be a blessing amen amen Isaiah 42. verse 16 and I'm gonna maybe be a bit more pastoral this morning and this was just a thought that came to me when I was coming back from the wedding in central Newfoundland and popped into my head and I've learned to listen to those things that pop into my head amen I believe it's the Lord that leads and so I just want to want to minister on on something this morning that's maybe a little different than what I had planned I mean Isaiah 42 16 says this it says and I will bring the Blind by the way that they knew not I will lead them in past that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning and I want to take a title this morning of the broken road and I'm here to encourage you and strengthen you here this morning like I said a bit pastoral perhaps but we're not going to be preaching deep thoughts or deep Mysteries this morning but I'm going to preach to us perhaps where we're maybe at this morning and you know we we're going to talk about a number of different people in the scriptures this morning and I can find myself in in more than one of them in different times whether it's past or or present and I'm sure you will too but I want us to see that as children of God we're all coming from the same material but we don't all go through the same process to get us to the Finish Line amen the way our lives are ordered the way that God structures things the way that God brings singed into our life the way he takes things out of our life all of these different things in our lives have a purpose and they have a reason behind it and it's God's Great Orchestra that's playing out as God's great plan that's that's doing these things you know and and even in this even in this this sermon as I was just dwelling on this thought you know it came through Fellowship and I found that with Fellowship comes Clarity with with Fellowship the things of God seem to crystallize that they seem to solidify in our lives and that's why we spend time with Believers it's why we have people out it's why we go to church it's why we do things with our young people so that the things that God's doing and his words start to solidify in our in our minds and in our hearts and in our souls and we can start to maybe understand a bit better what God's doing in our lives sometimes we get caught up in a little bubble of our own thinking of our own way of doing things and and what happens is Satan combined us there because we don't see the bigger picture and sometimes it takes a bit of Fellowship sometimes it takes a bit of preaching sometimes it takes somebody else that's been through it before to tell you this is where you're at and what you're thinking is the end is not the end that the thing you you think is going bad here is actually going to work out for your good and God's got a plan and a purpose in these things and and even in this the thought came to me how that our circumstances don't Define us as in where we find ourselves today where we were found ourselves yesterday where we were born the family we came into the church we came into the country we were born into the color of our skin even the very religion or lack thereof is not what defines us amen but what defines us as something that started way before circumstances came into being and that was in the mind of God and in the thought of God and in the purpose and plan of God Amen so these things at these circumstances that we go through are not what Define me eternally what defines me eternally is what I was in the great mind of God in the beginning and where he's taken me in the end but in between there's going to be things that don't look very much like God and they don't look very much like a Christian walk perhaps even as we'll see amen and we have people that come from very different situations even myself standing here as a minister I didn't have the benefit maybe of brother Matt or brother Joshua that were born in a fully believing home and their father stayed in their home I didn't have that opportunity so I come from a broken road if I can put it that way I don't have the same opportunity but yet here God has done something with me through that broken road amen through those those failed circumstances through the Frailty of humanity through failed marriage and relationships and these different things and some of us come from church backgrounds where we've had failed pastors and failed Ministries and we've had Unfaithful people there that that serve God for so long and then a certain Doctrine comes out or a certain knowledge comes out and they just leave the Lord or they leave the church or they leave our fellowship in these different things and it can hurt us and we can say where is God in this how can this be God working in my life but I want you to understand that children of God always have God working in their life even when they don't realize it amen God's working out something for our good amen the reason I say this is that our circumstances are not what make us Believers we are believers because we believe not because we control circumstances or because circumstances are always going to be perfect or exactly the way that we think it should be I mean you look even at Esau and Jacob came from the exact same home the exact same environment they say today you know environment is what determines what a child will be well let me tell you the scripture denies that because Esau and Jacob came from a believing home out of the lineage of the father of our faith Abraham and one was accepted by God and one was rejected by God and in the beginning the one that was accepted by God looked like he should have been rejected amen so the way that God works is way past our understanding amen so I'm in trying to encourage you this morning as we get into this don't worry about the road don't worry about the potholes don't worry about the bumps don't worry about the curves don't worry about when it looks like you're going away just trust that as a child of God he's going to take you through amen trust that all right because our human nature is so often to dwell on the negative that's where the news is gone that's where people have gone it seems like in the past 15 or 20 years especially is that everything dwells on the negative and it's not going right and I can't see God in it and why am I like this and why is this not happening and and we end up with a lot of questions and doubts and it has a hard time now bringing for Faith out of doubts because it's based on what fear it's not based on the word of God and so we get into these places where we're Bound by the circumstances rather than Bound by the word promise that says I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen that I'm going to get you across the finish line I want to take us into the scriptures this morning because I want to show you that the road you walk will not be perfect even though it may be perfect in God's eyes in our human nature in the way of looking things it's not going to look perfect and you're going to have interludes in your life you're going to have periods in your life and you're going to say this isn't perfect this isn't even right and yet God is in it amen we have we're taking the wall stickers out for for some for to chance Cove the other day for a hike and brother Blair was saying all your roads here are so great brother John you've got this big double lane two-way Highway you know and and the roads are so great I said brother wait till we get on the side roads because they put all the money into the main roads but you get into the side roads towards chance Cove and my wife's back there saying you can really feel this road from the back seats you know all the way through why it's a side road they don't maintain it the same way they don't have the money to do it so they do all the main thoroughfares the main highways the main roads and they leave the side ones there but it's a joy to drive on the smoothly newly paved newly painted Highway isn't it we love to ride on those but sometimes God's got to take us down a side road doesn't he and it starts to get bumpy and we say how can this be God this doesn't feel right this uh this doesn't feel like an overcoming life doesn't feel like God's here but yet it's God in all of it amen if life was a road and it is a road we'd look backwards and say it hasn't been perfect if it hasn't been perfect why do we expect it to be perfect moving forward in our own eyes in our own way of thinking amen we have this expectation that God is somehow gonna make everything perfect while we're in it rather than the end goal is perfection amen he works all things for our good he didn't say all things were good he says he'll work them for our Goods so whether we get into his permissive will or his perfect will it's often going to look very much the same in that it's not always going to be easy it's not always going to be something that just happens you know when when we were living in Texas we drove all the way to California one time and let me tell you Texas is not all beautiful I don't know if you've ever been to Texas parts of Texas are beautiful but Texas is so big you can't drive through it in a day and so we were driving and we were driving and we were driving and near the end of the first day I think we stopped in El Paso which is actually starting to look pretty nice but we had to go through What's called the Permian Basin and this is called the armpit of Texas there's nothing attractive about an armpit I don't know if you've looked at an armpit recently there's nothing attractive about it there's nothing good about it this is the armpit of Texas and all it was was tumbleweeds and regular weeds and sand and dust and dirt and oil well sites that's it hot Dusty dry but yet that was a part of the way I had to go to get to my destination it wasn't all beautiful you get to California and you're like this is amazing this is beautiful you get into maybe portions of arizonian oh you just love the red rocks and these different things but going through the armpit of Texas was a part of the journey to go to beautiful California and we had to drive through and we had to accept it as a party amen I'm here to tell you that there are parts of your life that aren't going to look pretty but they are a part of your god-given god-ordained journey to get you to the beautiful land that awaits us Beyond amen you're in good company if your life's not pretty in terms of the road that you're on Amen it's not where you've been so much that matters it's are you going where you're supposed to be going amen Don't Look Behind look forward and say am I going where he wants me to be sometimes you know we look at our lives and and we can say I learned without having to experience you know it's like that story of the of the the man who had a stock pen and it had an electrified fence and his daughter went to touch and he said don't touch the fence it'll hurt you now she had a choice she could learn by obedience or she could learn by experience but she didn't choose to learn by obedience and so when she wasn't lucky he wasn't looking she went she touched the fence and it zapped her it electrocuted her it hurt her and she started crying and he came over and he said I told you not to touch the fence I wasn't trying to keep you from experiencing something good I was trying to keep you from being in a painful experience and so you know what happened when her brother came up and he went to touch the fence do you know what she said don't touch the fence why she'd experienced the pain some of us learn quickly and easily some of us learn the hard way but we learn one way or the other amen sometimes you know we look at our life and you know some of us have to learn you have to save a bit from every paycheck why because dad taught it mom taught it and so we've done it ever since and so when that that Financial bump hits where you have a major event you have a catastrophe you have a water heater go out your your shingles need to be replaced and you got to come up with ten thousand dollars what is it you've got it in the bank because you learn by obedience and so that portion of your road is just a small pothole you don't even notice it because you were prepared by simple obedience or maybe you're like the rest of us and we don't do that and so all of a sudden you've got to go into debt for ten thousand dollars and you don't know where you're going to get that money or how you're going to pay it off and so you have this massive pothole this rough stretch of road because what you didn't learn by obedience you had to learn by experience but if you can learn from the rough time as you step up hopefully you take that lesson and you start putting money away and the next time your water heater goes out you just write a check and you move on and it doesn't even slow you down it's not even an experience it's just something that you deal with on a day-to-day basis and then sometimes we have this vision of a of a perfect Road and we're going to use some graphs this morning and just to make understanding so we've got the green above which is what we would call good good times good decisions whatever it will be in below we have the bad in red and we look at this idea of the perfect Road of a Believer and they're born into a good home they're born into a believing home and they become a Christian they they get baptized they accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior they've receive the Holy Ghost they moved through their education they get a job then they they perhaps marry and have a family then after that perhaps they find a greater Kingdom Purpose a Ministry of some sort whether it's it's preaching or singing or deep whatever it might be and then they serve in those things very Faithfully until they pass on to the other side and we say that is the perfect Road of the believer well that's what we would like to happen but God doesn't raise us like that God doesn't teach us like that amen he's got to put certain experiences into our life but I want to look at a few people in scriptures this morning hopefully we can find our place in these different things because as we go on these scriptures and look at the roads of many great believers men and women that were types of Christ even and you look at the road they're on and you'll see it looks nothing like this this constant trajectory towards eternity that we would like to think that this is going to look like and then sometimes it's easy to look at at because we don't look at ourselves we look at other people and we say why does brother Mark keep making that same decision time and time again why won't he learn maybe you look at brother John and say brother John why don't you why can't you see this in yourself and you can look at it and you say that's going to hurt you and that's going to lead you down a bad Road and it's going to cause pain and it's going to cause issues and these different things and it's very easy to get caught up in that and I'm not here to say don't be concerned but I am here to say God is responsible for his children I'm not responsible for you and you're not responsible for me in the big picture but we ought to encourage each other we ought to be able to correct each other we ought to be able to Fellowship on the things of God but in the end you don't answer to me and I don't answer to you for my walk Christ answers for us and then he's the one that has us engraved in the palm of his hands he said I won't lose the one of them I didn't say I won't lose you he said he won't lose you so he's the one that's got to take you through these patches of your life amen sometimes we look at our our lives and you know what there are people that seems like they can't win for losing have you ever met people like that and it seems like everything in their life is constant trials and they can never seem to get ahead and it seems like if there's not in financial troubles and they're in sickness and if they're not in sickness and they've got relationship troubles or their Church splits or the you know lose their job whatever it might be and you say how can that be God let me tell you those are the people God uses the most he's chastening them remember chastening is not all disciplined it's that teaching it's that guiding it's that growing it's that maturity because they have a very special place in the body and you'll find that the ones that he works on the hardest are the ones that he uses the most so this life of ease if we're looking for ease what you're saying is God don't use me because life lives of ease are never going to be those of the great Heroes of the faith amen and we look at those people many times and there you can see the sincerity you can see the commitment to the things of God and they're faithful and everything and yet they keep going through difficult times and it reminded me of Joseph as I was thinking on these things and let's look at Joseph let's compare this perfect Road to the road of Joseph because you see that Joseph was born into a chosen family he had a believing mother he had a believing father they're in the lineage of the great father Abraham they were a called out people and then God puts a a special gift in his life and he is God's Prophet even as a young boy and he's his dad's favorite and he gets the special jacket you know that singles him out from from all of his brothers and then God starts to work in his life and he starts to give him dreams and Joseph shares those dreams with his family and they get mad at him don't they they get angry with him sharing the things that God has shown him amen now where is Joseph's choice in all of this Joseph is what he is God is calling God has made him God has put a gift in his life Joseph doesn't have a choice in any aspect of his life here and honestly it seems like he's going pretty well and then as soon as he gets a special coat as soon as he gets recognized as being special then the jealousy becomes completely untameable in his brothers and they go off to to graze the Sheep elsewhere and his dad says hey go check up on your brothers and he goes over there and as soon as they see him coming they make a plan to kill him and as soon as he comes in they grab him they tear his coat off and they throw him down in a well for a few days and they're planning to kill him they're planning to kill him and then a slave trade a group of slave Traders comes by and they say you know what let's not kill him let's just sell him into slavery so he goes from On Top of the World prophetic gift in a great and loving Christian home if we could put it that way now he's gone into a well for three days then he drops into slavery and now he's taken out of his homeland he's taken away from family he's still got a prophetic gift he still comes from a great family but now he's in a situation that he has not made a single choice to the bad and yet he's in a horrible situation he hasn't done a thing wrong church and yet he's been sold into slavery and he goes there and he comes to Potiphar's house the captain of of the pharaoh's guard and he goes there and you know what Joseph's attitude is if I'm going to be a slave I'm going to be the best slave that's the attitude of a child of God in tough situations no matter how bad it is I'm going to be a child of God I'm going to be a Son of God I'm going to be a daughter of God I'm going to be the greatest there can be in this situation I'm going to dig in and I'm going to show what's in me rather than let the circumstance Define me amen and so Joseph goes in and the scripture says as a slave the Lord was with Joseph the Lord was with Joseph in the lowest point he'd experienced in his life so far and potiphar realizes this and potiphar makes him his chief of staff he makes him his Steward and Joseph has control over all of Potiphar's assets everything potiphar has he says the only thing you're not allowed is my wife everything else you control as a slave and potiphar is blessed and blessed and blessed and all of his Holdings and all of his assets grow and grow and grow under Joseph the Lord is with him blessing him in the lowest point he's been in his life amen and then comes the choice for Joseph because Potiphar's wife tries to seduce him and he's got a choice he can hold on to the power and the authority he has as a slave or he can choose to do the right thing and risk judgment and this is the first place that Joseph has to make a choice because he knows it's probably not going to end well he knows it's not going to end well you know they say hell had no fury like a woman scorned this woman he knows her character she's just shown her character he knows this isn't going to do well but as a child of God he makes a harder decision and he uses his feet for discernment and he gets out of the situation he turns a flat down he doesn't talk about it he gets out of the house and he goes but what that means is he can't defend himself and that woman drags him drags down his reputation accuses him in front of her husband and her husband can't afford to be shamed by believing Joseph so what does he do he takes Joseph who has made the right decision and he puts him now into prison for making the right decision Joseph now goes into an even worse place but he's a Son of God and what does he say if I'm going to be a slave prisoner I'm going to be the best slave prisoner there is here and pretty soon he's running the entire prison he has free reign over everything that's there the warden is sitting back in his air-conditioned office and letting Joseph do all the work and the scripture says and the Lord was with Joseph Son of God that he's the most perfect type of Christ we have in the scriptures no matter the situation the Lord was with them because he kept making when he was given a decision he made the right decision even if it led him into an even worse decision amen in prison as a slave God is still with them then he has this wonderful opportunity remember the Pharaoh puts his chief Butler and his chief Baker into prison because they did something wrong who knows what and they're sitting there in prison for a while and then they have dreams and and they come to Joseph and they tell him these dreams that are bothering them and Joseph interprets the dream by God's grace God gives him the interpretation he tells the butler he says you're going to be restored to pharaoh and he tells the baker he says you're going to have your head taken from you and then they're going to hang you and sure enough that's what happens but Joseph before the butler is called up he says when you get out of here remember me and you know what the butler does as soon as he gets out of prison he promptly forgets Joseph so now Joseph is feeling he has the opportunity let me put it that way to be depressed to be despondent because he's done something for somebody else and now they've completely forgotten what he did for them and he's at the lowest point of his life until one day Pharaoh has a dream and nobody can interpret it and the chief Butler says I know a guy he finally remembers Joseph and he says I know a guy and Pharaoh says bring him before me Joseph comes up he says can you interpret dreams no I can't but the God I serve can he says well here's my dream Joseph goes God gives him the interpretation he comes back he gives Pharaoh the dream which is what there's going to be the years of famine or there's going to be years of plenty then there's going to be years of famine and at the end of the famine it's not going to be good and Pharaoh says well what do we do and Joseph through all of the experiences he has had in the depths of his life in the hardest times of his life speaks from those experiences and says you need a good man you need a man that can prepare and put this aside put him in charge he'll take care of everything and we'll make it through and Pharaoh says I can't think of a better person than you so we look at that line in that line in one day Joseph goes from the hardest worst place of his life straight up to the right hand of power in a single day Church in a single day he goes from a despondent potentially slave prisoner to the right hand of pharaoh and nobody is more powerful in Egypt than him except the king himself except the Pharaoh himself in one day he went from nothing to everything from there what happens he goes and he does all the hard work and he gathers all of the food in and he prepares all of these things and then famine hits and two years into the famine his brothers show up and they come in and Joseph recognizes them they don't recognize him and Joseph is looking at them and of course he plays all sorts of tricks with them because he's trying to figure out if they developed any character since he left and so he goes through this character testing phase and he proves them and they sure enough they pass it and so he finally reveals himself to them but I want you to catch the attitude I want you to catch the spirit of a son or a daughter of God as they come out of this watch the consideration he has for his past he says this and Joseph said to his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither listen Joseph someone that should have been angry Joseph had a right to be angry he says you guys don't be angry he says for God did send me here before you to preserve life to preserve life he put Joseph through slavery hell to preserve life why because he knew he had the character to go through it and still do the job at the end listen God ruined his life early on to save the world at that point church this is a real prophet of God that can look back at the times like that and say God was in it and I'm okay with it what an attitude to have no bitterness no offense no hurt not only is he not mad at God he's not even mad at the people that did it forgiveness is there he's saying come near the spirit and the bride say come don't worry about it I'm okay I want you to be okay too he says for these two years have the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall be neither earring nor Harvest catch this he says and God sent me before you to preserve your posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance he had to go through Great Tribulation to get a great Deliverance he says so now it was not you that sent me hither but God who put him in the well the brothers who sold them to the slave masters the brothers but he says it was God all along it was God all along it wasn't you it was God and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and the Lord of all of his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt look at this road the majority if we were to go back the majority of Joseph's life is in the red if we could put it he's in debt he's in hard times he's in difficult times he's in pain he's in suffering he has no power he has no Authority he has no benefits as a son of God and yet he says through it all God has done it it was God all along this was God's perfect Road for Joseph it wasn't this constant rise to victory was it like we would think but it was a broken road and it was God's perfect will our road doesn't Define us what defines us as our response our attitude the way we can talk about it afterwards tells us what we were in it amen what we've got to be willing to trust God regardless of what that road looks like let's take a look at another broken road this morning let's go to the other side of things we start with Joseph in a perfect situation a type of Christ in the scriptures let's go to the other Road let's go to Rahab let's talk about rahab's Broken Road compare her to to Joseph she's born into the wrong family she's born into a family of idol worshipers she's born into a land where they are going to be judged very shortly she has made no choice this is her Heritage she's born in a family that's going to be judged enter circumstances and we don't know how it became about Rahab becomes a prostitute a prostitute is the lowest form of human life on the planet aside from the men that will take advantage of her but through circumstances in life she becomes a cesspool a filthy piece of humanity and we don't know what happened we don't know what brought her to that level amen but she is living in total and absolute sin and filth at some point she had to make a choice church and she made a choice to stay in it we'd say that does this look like a child of God then God says the cup of the amorites is the iniquity of amorites is full now is the time of judgment and he sends the Israelites into the land and they come through and they clear out the land on the other side of Jordan and then what happens is God says okay now you've got to go in now you've got to judge the people in there you are my hand of judgment for all of the Canaanites she's under judgment now and she deserves it she absolutely deserves it by the law by the word she deserves it amen and what happens is that she the the entire country is so evil that God says I won't spare a one Kill Them All women children men everything destroy it all and then the destroying Army arrives you talk about a low point you know that you can win you know you're scheduled for Destruction they have more people they have a greater people and they have a supernatural god with them your toast you're hooped you might as well just get ready to die but then she hears about a living God and we see an uptick we see a green event in our life and that she hears about a God that does things that her Gods can't do and from there what happens the enemy comes right to her door the destroying Angel comes right to her door amen and what happens is the spies come in and this is where she gets a choice Church they come in and she has to choose do I commit treason in the hopes of Mercy or do I stick with what I've had all this time and stay with my way of life this is her moment to put what she believes into action because she says we've heard of everything your God has done we know I know he's the real God and this is her moment to take what she said she believed and put it into action and what does she do she hides those spies the king the scripture says the king literally says to her bring him out and she says they're already gone she lies to her own King to preserve the life of those spies and then at the very end what does she do she says have mercy have mercy on me and what do they do they say take the Rope of Deliverance take a token of what you use to save us and hang it in your door hang it in your window and that will be a token to us not to enter the home and he says they said get everyone everyone you know get your family into that house shut the door and don't come out now she's given a chance to what simply obey she didn't get a chance to say I don't like how red looks on my house people are going to wonder why I'm hanging a red rope she just had to obey hang the Rope get them in and shut the door and stay there amen she couldn't come up with a better way but she's stuck still she she pleads for mercy and she's given a choice and she has a token she has a token for her household and then the enemy comes and surrounds her and things start to go down again and things start to go down again and then realize this she's living on the very walls that have to fall her house her home her place of residence is on the walls that have to come down supernaturally she's part of the thing that has to be destroyed by God you talk about a Razor's Edge you talk about living on the cliff she's on the cliff and she's just got one finger holding her she's scheduled for Destruction her very home not just her life her very home is scheduled for Destruction the place that they said will be a shelter a tower of strength for her is scheduled for Destruction and she has to believe that her home won't be destroyed when everyone else's is what a horrible place to be living in you're sitting there and you're on the wall and you see that Army going around and around and you round and you know it's just a matter of time before they're going to get in amen but she obeys she obeys and that's the first tick we see up is over six days she obeys the word and she sticks with it and she sticks with it and she sticks with it and then the walls come down and you know what hers is the only house on those walls that did not come down built from the same materials same sinful family inside but yet she obeyed the word and she put her token out there and that is what preserved her I just saw yesterday that the archaeologists have found rahab's house it's the only portion of the wall Still Standing everything fell down except this one portion it's rahab's house they've literally found proof that Rahab was in Jericho isn't that an amazing thing after thirty five hundred four thousand years whatever it's been they finally have proof of a word of God that we've known all this time but she obeys the word of God and all her and her family are saved what did they do nothing except listen when she said I've got a way to save you I've got a way to save you don't ask me how just know I've got a way to save you they're going to spare us if we'll stay in here and we'll plead the token look at what happens to her she comes back she converts she starts to serve the one true God and she marries an Israelite captain and she is put into the natural lineage of Jesus Christ all her life failed rotten messy Godless and in just a week or two maybe two weeks total God turns her into the daughter of God she always was I loved how brother Tim said when they went to talk at the marriage and they said is there any reason this woman should not marry this man and somebody stands up and says yes she was a prostitute he says where are the witnesses destroyed it was a replay of what Christ did with that woman that was caught in adultery woman where are thy Witnesses she says they're not here neither do I condemn they go and sin no more it's a perfect type of Rahab right there listen to this the prophet of God would say he so cared he so cared even for a woman that was an outsider not an Israelite she didn't belong to the group but she was an outsider Presbyterian Methodist or something she was on the other side in other words she wasn't a message believer if we want to take it to our day he says but when she heard her name was Rahab she was a harlot but when she heard how God was in a pillar of fire and was leading them she called out to God and she showed Mercy to the spies that had come out to look out the land and because she cared for her and her people God cared for her in so much till this Harlot will give her life to Christ to the cause because she had seen the sign of a supernatural God and she served her Gods right in her own denomination he says but when she saw this great Supernatural sign she cried out and asked for mercy and for Mercy for her family and God so cared for her that the whole city lapped down one on top of the other but there wasn't one rock moved on her house he cares though her being Outsider she wasn't in the group at that time but he cared he said he always cares you say how could he care to start her in that family in that condition to put her into that trade to put her into that job listen we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies as the prophet of God would say Satan has his finger in every one of our lives things are all messed up things are all twisted up God doesn't care about that he can untwist them he doesn't worry about where you start he's just trying to pull out that see Gene of God that he placed in there and then Satan came in and sowed a different seed all around it and that's what's messed us up God didn't mess her up God pulled her out amen he was there all the time her complete life was a complete and total waste for for for decades perhaps there is nothing that Rahab took out of that time that she would have brought into her life in marriage as a daughter of God as a child of Israel nothing benefited her total Broken Road and yet as soon as she comes in he places her in the natural lineage of Jesus Christ it's not about the road it's about the seed amen it's about what's inside of every one of us I want to show you something you know I'm an engineer I do graphs I'm going to show you a second graph and this will help you no matter where you're at today I want to call this graph and it's going to be the lower one whose child is Rahab so up above I have the exact same path of rahab's Life as we just saw but beneath it it's hard to see maybe I can go over here if we look right here when she's in a wrong family in an idol worshiper is she a child of God yes when she's a prostitute is she a child of God when she's judged by God to die based on her Heritage is she a child of God when she hears about a living God is she a child of God when she's given a choice and a token is she a child of God see we look here and we say that can't be God but she's a child of God all the way through church she's a child of God from the start to the Finish you are what you are and it doesn't change when you hear the truth you either are a child of God or you aren't and if you are a child of God you always were a child of God we look at that and we say how can that be a child of God but she was no less a child of God as a prostitute as she was the wife of salmon no less a child of God don't look at where the person's at today you look to the Token you look to the promise you look to the word you're holding over them why God's not going to lose a one and he's going to draw out what's inside of us no matter what that situation looks like amen Rahab made a lot of bad choices some were forced some were actual choices we know they were all wrong until one day she had to make the choice what will you do with the Living God and that's the same choice we face today what are you going to do with This Man Called Jesus Christ with this word that he's brought today what are you going to do with it that's the only choice you'll make that ever matters you make the right choice there everything else it doesn't even play in you just got to make that choice amen it may take a while it took a while for her looked hopeless but he says they're engraved in the palms of my hand they're there and there's no taking them out they're there even if he didn't want them not that he wouldn't but they're there no matter what and nothing can take you out of his hands amen Jesus said I won't lose a single one that the father has given me look at the scripture in Isaiah 51. it says for the Lord shall Comfort Zion who is Zion Zion is always the bride it's always the bride so let's read it this way for the Lord shall Comfort the bride he will Comfort all her waste places what bride of Christ has places of waste in her life Rahab sure did he says and he will make her Wilderness like Eden so Bride is a bride experience is going to include waste places it's going to include Wilderness places and it says in her desert like the garden of the Lord so you're going to have desert places in your life in your broken road as well he says but joy and gladness shall be found therein Thanksgiving and the voice of Melody in other words let me tell you God can turn your wasted life your wasted moments your poor decisions into a place of comfort amen he can take the ashes of a destroyed life of a ruined marriage of a hurtful experience with a Ministry of a of a body that's been wrecked by pain and suffering he can take it as if it never happened and turn it into a place of comfort Joseph spoke from a place of comfort when he when he talked to his brothers God was in it all the time and he did it to preserve life amen he can take the desolation of your life you talk about a Wilderness experience what was the Wilderness experience going on around and around and around and never conquering never overcoming never going into the land of promise he says he can take that experience and turn it into Eden he can restore you back from there into your original condition as if it was never a Wilderness in the first place that's the kind of God that is calling out a bride in this age amen that he doesn't look at the road but he says I am the god that healeth Thee I am the god that delivers Thee I am the god that called you out don't look at the road look to me and just trust me to take you through amen let's look at one that's maybe a little closer to us sometimes let's talk about Jonah for a little bit let's talk about a prophet's life you could probably put brother Brandon's life up here just like this and it would look similar because remember he turned God down he rejected God's call he refused to go to the Pentecostals and these different things prophet of God the messenger of the age no perfect Road there I'm so glad we got to see a profit being developed in our age because it gives me hope that I can make it if he can make it the mistakes the choices the influence he came under at different times and God had to train and teach his Prophet just like he's got to train each and every one of us amen Jonah born into an Israelite home born into a good family given a gift ordained of God to be a prophet was was obedient to God and His calling and everything's going great he's a prophet of God what could possibly go wrong and then God gives him a special mission that takes him outside of his comfort zone takes him outside of Israel takes them to people that don't deserve his message and you know what the scripture says it says Jonah ran from the presence of the Lord he actively and specifically chose to depart from the presence of God as if you could do such a thing but he walked away from where God was talking to him and he jumps on a ship to tarshish he gets to a point where he says God I don't want to hear that knocking on my heart I don't want to hear that voice that's telling me to go to Nineveh I'm going to go out of your presence so that I don't hear you telling me what I'm supposed to do amen he runs from the presence of God and then he jumps on the ship to tarshish now he's on a ship with a bunch of people that ain't done nothing wrong like that they're not running from the presence of the Lord perhaps they don't even know the Lord we know they don't know the Lord because they're praying to all their gods a little bit later but he jumps on board and when he goes on board that ship in Disobedience he takes judgment right with him and he goes on that ship and God sends a storm that's going to destroy remember he's on that boat and the first thing they do is they throw all their cargo so they lose all their blessings they lose all the profit they were going to make and then after that when that's all done and it's getting worse and worse and worse and the ship is starting to sink then they say everybody pray and they go down and Jonah is sleeping in the bottom of the ship he's sleeping in the bottom of ship and they say get up pray to your God we're going to pray to ours you pray to yours and they pray for a while but guess what Joe name pray in church because he knows there's no point in praying what's the point of praying you got to come to obedience Lord take me out of this storm obey it's the only way to get out of the storm is to obey your child of God so Jonah's choices have taken him into this storm Jonas choices have put other people's lives in danger Jonah's choices have taken the blessings out of those people's lives because he knows better and they don't he goes in there amen and Jonah doesn't do a thing to help those men because he knows God ain't going to bless them while he's in Disobedience as long as he's on the ship amen our Disobedience Church it affects everybody around us everybody pays a price fathers you disobey the household pays a price mothers you disobey the household pays a price the children always suffer the children always suffer amen Jonah does everything except the right thing until the situation gets very desperate and I think what happens you know we know what what happens is they say well we're going to cast lots we're going to draw straws and whoever gets the Short Straw that's the Jonah that's what we say today it's based on this story whoever draws a short straw that's the person that's causing all these problems and Jonah gets the straw and finally he's got to come clean and he says what this is my fault I'm the problem sometimes that's the first thing we've got to do when we step into situations like this and say it's me just hands up no equivocation no explanation Lord this one's on me men and Brethren this one's on me I'm the problem we got to be able to do that we've got to be able to say I'm in Disobedience I know better I know I shouldn't be doing it I've been doing it and it's me and what does Jonah tell them he says we've got to get me away from you it's not fair that you pay the price for what I've done so Jonah says throw me into the water you know what Jonah does he exits his decision he stops going where he was going he quits disobeying and as soon as he hits the water the storm stops as soon as he can't get back in that boat as soon as they've gone beyond him he's in the water now it's calm well he's in the middle of nowhere there's no salvation here but at least it's not stormy but he's getting real low things aren't going real well it's thrown into the ocean and he's floating there and probably thinking how is this going to work out and then something comes up and swallows him and things get really bad really quickly this was a whale created by God to fit Jonah this is a situation this is a trial this is a horrible experience crafted by the spoken word to take Jonah to the depths of the ocean and despair this is Jonah's perfect yet broken road we'll see takes them down there and Jonah finally starts acting like a prophet and starts praying he starts seeking the presence of God rather than running from the presence of God and for three days he's seeking God and you know what God doesn't answer but you know what God's doing God's working on the fish God's working on the situation and for those three days that fish is taking Jonah by a circuitous ocean route right to where he needs to be and then as the scripture says that at the end of those three days God tells the fish spit them out let them go remember brother Ram talks about that quote where he says God takes troubles and puts bits in their mouth this is what happens with children of God is God makes them obey his will to produce what he needs out of us he takes that whale and he tells the whale he speaks where he says spit him out and the whale vomits him up onto the beach a lovely experience and yet Supernatural and he vomits him out God delivers him and God's Deliverance is a perfect sign to the people of Nineveh because they worship the whale and so they see a man come out of the mouth of their God then they believe that's a prophet from their God now the way the prophet would say it is they wouldn't have accepted his message if he had come the way he would have went normally if he had just walked over in in the traditional obedience if I could put it that way to what God had told him they would not have accepted his message but God used His prophets nature and response to to take him there in a perfect way so that they would hear his message and out of that perfect sign he preaches a message delivers a warning that they heat and he saves a city from death out of all of that God brings salvation now Joel is an interesting one because we say he refused to obey God he's a disobedient Prophet he's a an Unfaithful child of God and in a way he is but let's look at the way a prophet of God looks at it remember we think we're off sometimes but we've got to understand God knows his children I don't know if anyone except me has manipulated their children before you know how I get Samuel to drink his smoothie in the morning I say Samuel do you want a smoothie what's the first thing he says true to his father he says no and so you know what I say I say Jensen do you want a smoothie Jensen says yes Sam says I want a smoothie I want a smoothie what am I I'm manipulating him knowing his nature I use his nature to produce a result he's an imperfect boy I use his nature to get him into my will and he doesn't know what hit him Prophet God says this he says if you understand a little history the god of Nineveh was a whale and when the whale brought the prophet right up before the fishermen and spit him out on the bank it was a miracle lots of things are providential he says it was God's will that Jonah went on down there like that he says he had to show a miracle Jonah's response though we were classified as disobedient or rebellious God knowing it used it to produce the miracle he says it was God's will he says listen to this no matter what takes place God will make it Praise Him anyhow God has a way of doing things it wasn't providential that he took the wrong ship it was God's Eternal promise and God's Eternal way of doing things you mean that he can use my Rebellion yep he can turn it into his perfect will he says he's a bringing a message he shook Shivers up and down their backs when they saw the sea god open up its mouth and the prophet walked out with a Bible in his hand he says sure they believe it God always has signs and wonders he works in the Supernatural to make people to believe him he'd say many people think that Jonah was a terrible person Jonah was a prophet of the Lord walking in all the will of the Lord now here's the thing walking in all of the will of the Lord without knowing it you can't say he do it he didn't know it but in the end Jonah would have looked back and said God you're a little sneaky because he would understood exactly what happened after it happened God you used me you knew how I was going to do it and you used it and then you have to throw up his hands and you have to say praise the Lord isn't that what we do sometimes we get into situations in life and we respond the way we always have and God says gotcha and he turns it right around he turns it into what worship praise His glory because it certainly wasn't our Glory that got us into it it was his glory that turned it into something that was wonderful he says you say why did he do what he did he said he never done anything contrary to God's will again Jonah's knowledge of what he's doing versus God's knowledge of what is his will is two very different things but he says he never got out of God's will he just didn't know it he says you can't if you're in Christ do anything contrary if you're walking humbly and upright it may seem like you do but you don't do it he says nothing happens providentially the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord and all things work together for the good to them that love him how can you take these scriptures he says and compare them with any other and then break them he says the scriptures cannot be broken God knows how to use us church he knows how to move us he knows how to break us he knows how to bend us he knows how to shape us he knows how to use our very cells for his glory and for his purpose this stink and flesh that we have ain't glorified yet and he can even use that he can even use that for his glory and to bring Salvation to somebody that needs it a whole city a whole city I was thinking on this and and I thought of a stained glass window because you look at a stained glass window you know you go to The Basilica and you see they've got those wonderful ones and you go to these big Cathedrals and they have these massive works of glass and you look at them and it's it's it's full of color and it's it just is so beautiful and you look at that and you say wow how do they do that even some of these nice homes on the East End you know they'll have a stained glass portion there and you just think wow what kind of what kind of artist was able to do that sort of thing with glass hardest thing to work with is glass because glass likes to break in straight edges and yet you go look at all of these glass pieces and they have curved pieces in them and you say how did they work with such brittle materials and produce something that looks so perfectly curved and fitted and shaped and everything Blended together and then you go up and you'll see that it's not one big piece of glass because that's one way you could do it you could just put one big plane of glass up there and then you could just put you know your your segments on it and then just paint it in that way and say well it's a stained glass window but it's not it's all individual pieces put together to form one big image amen so I looked it up I looked up how they do it it meant because I want you to catch this because a stained glass window is all broken pieces of glass none of the glass pieces are used as they came from the factory they're all broken they're all shaped they're all cut they're all adapted to where they're going to be amen they're sized down and trimmed exactly to where they're supposed to fit so I went through YouTube and I looked it up and what's the first thing that the man does the artist does the master artist does is he says show me what it's got to fit and he says show me your window give me your dimensions and he takes it and then he sketches out the whole thing he gathers all the dimensions he knows where it's got to fit he knows how it's got to be so that he can put it right in perfectly when it's all said and done amen and then he sketches it up and he draws the design first he never starts cutting glass he has a design first there's an intelligence behind what he's going to do he's got an image in his mind he looks at what he has to work with and then he looks at into his mind and he says this is what I think is going to look beautiful and he comes up with it and he's going there amen and only the master artist at this point knows what this image is going to look like nobody knows all they know is we got a spot put something beautiful in it he comes up with it amen and so then he'll take and this you'll see there are many panels and each of those panels is going to be an individual piece of work but together they're going to form a big piece but even within the smaller panels you have very tiny pieces of glass it's the individual pieces of the image so after that's done now he takes it and he starts to sketch out what this whole big thing is going to look like and this is supposed to be the Tree of Life and he says this is what it's going to look like but you're going to have to break it down into smaller elements into bite-sized pieces into individual sized pieces for this to look the way that it's supposed to look amen they're going to have to fit in a certain way and so he sketches it all out and you can see where he's starting to put in some breaks and put in some lines of where the glass pieces are going to be cut but notice not a single one of those pieces looks exactly the same there's not one piece of glass in there that's exactly the same as the one next to it it's all individually decided by the master artist what it's going to look like then what does he do he starts to color it he starts to add detail what is it it's all coming out of his mind being put on paper now and this is just a small piece of paper this one looks to be maybe you know two foot by a foot maybe something like that and he starts to colorize he starts to add in all the detail because he's got to produce a Perfect Image in front of him before he can produce it in reality you understand where I'm coming from remember in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and now the word is being expressed again isn't it there has to be a master design there has to be somebody that's coming up with the details we don't get to choose the details he gets to choose the details then as soon as he has this you'll notice now he's got all the cuts in there and he's got all the different pieces in each of those pieces is going to be a certain shape it's going to be a certain color to fit in a certain place to produce a certain part of the image and only after he's done this they start designing those individual pieces of glass then when that's all done this is what he's got that's what it's going to look like this isn't 100 done but he's gone through variations he's produced it he's he's gone through a process to produce it perfectly remember in the scripture in Genesis it says in God saw that it was good God saw it was good God saw that it was good and then when it was all put together it says God saw that it was very good this is what's happening here it's good it's good it's good he's coming forward he's coming forward he's coming forward but he's trying to get a place of very good so now he's got the whole template he's got the whole pattern and what's he got to do next now he puts it in life size this is something like 12 feet long by five feet wide and it's all drawn perfectly to scale because what's going to happen next is he's going to take those pieces of glass and he's going to lay them down and compare them to the life-size template all he's doing is he's taking that glass down and he lays it right over top and he cuts it exactly the way the template says it has to be he doesn't freehand it he doesn't say oh it's roughly this size so I'm just going to cut it out he lays it up against the template and then he starts to cut it okay he's laying that glass right on that piece he's got the life-size template he's got the word there and he's cutting the individuals to match what the word says about them each and every one of them but I want you to understand something if you're a piece of glass in this situation you don't know if you're going to be thrown away or you're going to be placed in the draw in the in the final image you don't know it only he knows it only he knows it and let me tell you this he may throw away a piece of glass and lay it aside for a while and then he'll come up to one of these little odd shaped pieces and he'll take that little Castaway piece he'll say look I can make something beautiful out of this little piece that I thought didn't fit anywhere he knew that's why he laid it aside he laid it aside he did not throw it out he laid it aside for a while knowing he had a portion that he could use that for Rahab was one of those things that was laid aside Joseph he was a big piece and God was working on him all along but only the artist knows who's going in and who's staying out and each of those pieces not a one of them looks the same amen so I can look at you and say you're too small you're shaped weird come from a different culture come from a different Church come from a different background you sing different you play different you look different you act different no he's shaping you for your place and he's shaping me for my place remember Paul would say when he's talking about the body says can the hand you know the eyes say to the hand you're not an eye therefore you're no good no no without you in your little odd-shaped portion and without me and my little odd shaped portion the image is not perfect and it's not whole but if you've ever tried to work with glass I don't know if anybody's tried to cut glass it's very difficult because glass likes to crack in straight lines so when you're doing what he's doing here this is the easy part but when he gets to the curb part do you know what they do they place it in water and they can literally use scissors and they can cut it because the water dampens the vibrations that would cause the glass to crack and when they're put in water when they're Washed by the Water now he can shape them when he can keep them under the washing of the water of the word he can form them into any shape he wants he can do teardrops he can do hearts he can do petals on a flower he can do anything he wants to shape something that would have broken otherwise if he can get them under the water of the word he can shape them into a perfect shape that you think is impossible for that piece of life that piece of glass amen once they're all cut he takes them and he fits them together and he paints them some of us get details early on in life don't we I look at brother Gerald yo he was a preacher from the I think from the moment he came out of the womb how many of us went to school with a Bible under our arms why God started working on him really early because he was a special portion he was a special vessel brother Tim pru was telling me the same thing he got baptized he was saved when he was five got the Holy Ghost when he was five Church and started preaching when he was 15. these are men and there's women that have it too God starts working on them early in life and they get the details colored in they can start to see maybe what their part is than the rest of us I told brother Tim I said God started working on you at five he started on me when I was 35. started working on me when I was 17 to get my heart but in terms of ministry I was 35. I said you got a 20-year jump on me how do you make up something like that you can't do it why because he's built for a certain place some pieces are bigger some people pieces are fancier some of them have more detail they have more Beauty some of us are just a single color piece of glass because they don't always paint the glass sometimes they just work with colored pieces of glass and they do it that way some of us are just a little piece but we're a piece nonetheless they start to paint it and all they're doing they're laying it all together and it's temporarily held there and they paint all the pieces and then they take them off and they fire them and what are they doing they're they're locking in the colors this is who you are this is what you are it's your adoption process and then what happens is he takes them he places them down and he starts to fit them into an entire body he puts you in your position he puts me in my position he puts this one in that one and he puts them all in and what does he use he uses lead why because lead is soft lead won't break the glass being fitted into position won't break your church he holds Us in the palm of his hands he's not going to break us with what he's doing with us but the position he's placing Us in and he puts it all in now you say that looks like it's just about done and it is but the problem is it's not all tied together yet it's just pieces of lead there and after that what does he have to do he has to solder it so the entire thing has to become a solid unit it's all connected you can't get out now you're in the body you're in the image of Christ amen and then after that's done they do something called cementing and they take cement not cement like we would pour for a house but a different kind of cement and it's gritty and it's but it's fine in a way and what they do is they rub it all over that window and they shove it into all the nooks and crannies because there's gaps and what they have to do is they have to make it weatherproof they have to make it waterproof they have to make it windproof and so what they do is they take a dirty situation they take hard times and they rub it into those cracks and what does it do it fills in all of the gaps so that glass can't rattle so it'll hold steady in the wind and in the storms so that nothing can break through sometimes it takes messy situations to draw us together sometimes God's got to got to work with us in ways that we really don't think is appropriate what is he doing he's trying to fill us with something that'll Hold Us steady it's got to be the love of God it's got to be the Holy Ghost itself amen but sometimes it doesn't feel so comfortable but when that's done then they wash them all over again and it is now perfect and they take it from there and they're taken to their final installation this is a different one because he didn't have a picture of the final one before but then everything is installed and you can finally see what he was doing all along that one piece of glass that's just a tiny little portion there had no clue how it fit into the big picture until things really started coming together and you started to praise the Lord and say I'm a part of the family of God he's got a plan he's got a purpose all that time all that cutting all that shaping I used to be so big and now I'm just a little piece yes but you're his perfect piece you're exactly what he wanted you to be amen we can see in our lives how God has formed Us and how he shaped Us in its first specific size and purpose but we don't always see the end purpose until the end or until very near the end and we've gone through all these things and we've gone through trials we've gone through troubles and you say it's just a small part brother Branham says God will train a man for 15 minutes of service use them all as I plan with them all his life work with them all his life for 15 minutes and then he'll throw them off now throw him off you're done your part you've done your part and then some people he starts with at the age of five going to school with a Bible under their arm but that's his choice not ours but each one of us he's working with us amen I'm reminded of the thief on the cross this will be as we start to close we're talking about broken roads let me show you the worst Road you could possibly see there's a man that in all probability was born into a poor family poor character poor Church attendance he's encouraged in lawlessness he does things wrong and they encouragement they're proud of it he maybe gets into a bad Circle a bad group of friends these different things and everything's building on top of it and pretty soon he starts to thieve and he's encouraged in it and he's allowed to do it and he goes along for a while and he's worthy of death the entire time but he doesn't get caught until he gets caught and then he's he's gone through the court system and they try him and they find him guilty and they sentence him to death by crucifixion which was the worst way to die because it often took days of hanging there in agony what he did church was so horrible that they said you got to die for it maybe he murdered someone in one of his thieves in one of his attempts of robbery or something like that we don't know the scripture silent on it but he had lived the life of a criminal his entire life can you imagine his mother and she's looking at him just like Mary was looking at Jesus and she's looking at him and she's mourning what's happening but for a different reason perhaps she could have stopped it now she's looking at him and he's on the Cross Church he is Bound for hell he's Bound for hell for his sin he knows he deserves it in fact he admits he admits he deserves it and that's the first moment that he took a step towards God was he said I deserve everything I'm do I'm getting you deserve it as well his fellow Thief he says we deserve it we did wrong he says he didn't do a thing but God rich in Mercy put himself on a cross right next to him so he could ask for mercy so he could stand up for the word of God do the only right thing perhaps he'd ever done in his life stand up and what defend righteousness say he doesn't deserve it all those priests all the ministry all the people they said he deserves to die and a criminal a criminal hanging on a cross stands up for the Messiah and says he has done nothing wrong Church you're always a child of God that was a child of God from start to finish and yet he lived a life of crime worthy of death but in the last few hours of his life he did one thing he asked for mercy he said Lord when you get your kingdom remember me and what did Jesus say today thou shall be with me in Paradise look at that line who knows maybe he was 30 years old 40 years old in six hours he went from Bound for hell to sitting in Paradise and he had a short walk he had a short stay because in three days Christ comes and empties it all out what did he ever do a completely broken road Unworthy of anything and yet a child of God buried deep inside there and when the choice came he made the right choice at the very end and he went to Paradise we look sometimes at people we look at kids that are out in the world we look at Family relatives that have forsaken this message that have gone Godless and we say how can God do it that was a hopeless situation he is hours away from Death he's condemned to die and yet God rich and mercy reached over his hand and said hello son I've been looking for you God knows how to put us in a position to get his mercy and his grace and his love and his salvation don't ever say it's too far don't ever say it's too far look at Saul I read something the other day the Apostle Paul he was Saul when he was persecuting and it said the first people to welcome Paul into Paradise were the ones that he put there persecuted and killed the True Church of God and he made him the prophet of the age that's what God can do amen with a broken road amen I don't think we have any broken prostitutes here this morning but if by chance you are look what God can do with that bad decisions bad roads turned her into a child of God put her in the natural lineage of Christ amen maybe we're Jonas this morning and we're disobeying and we know we're doing things we ought not to we're running from the presence of God he's still got us you can't run from the presence of God if you're a child he'll get you eventually listen to this well Bram says this he says here is something to console us here is something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we'll stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings isn't it strange that God likened us to sheep as sheep is the most helpless thing there is there's nothing so insufficient of Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep stands helpless he says that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient and then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person makes his hands do what God's hand God would have hands to do makes his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his they're Gods he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and to make his own self the natural lineage of Christ is a virtual who's who a broken lost shameful filthy out of the Covenant people nothing natural about the natural lineage of Christ would say this is where the Royal King's going to come from that the Messiah is come down this amen and even the ones that are in it that we look at as Heroes of the faith had a lot of bumps and bruises Abraham's road is full of Curves and deviations and side roads and unbelief and unfaithfulness and bad decisions and wrong decisions and walking away from God Moses got himself in trouble by trying to get ahead on the road he put his foot down he said I want to get where God wants me to get and he took himself completely out of the will of God Jacob was a cheater a liar and a shyster that was his very nature until God got a hold of him and yet he's he's what one of the three fathers of the faith that we talk about amen and each one of those God got him to the place where they either said I can't do it or I'm sick of trying it and then God finally started to work and mold and shape and produce his word amen Jeremiah 29 says this and this is God speaking to the children of Israel about their time coming out of Babylon he says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord they're in they're in slavery they're in slavery and this is God's thoughts he says their thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end they're in slavery he says but you're going to come out you're in a foreign land where they serve foreign Gods but I'm going to bring you back and I'm going to restore Worship in the temple he says then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me they would seek him all the 70 years in Babylon but in the end someone would finally get a hold of him amen when will you find him when you so search for me with all your heart brother Brown says that's exactly what God did he made arrangements that you should be dressed in a certain way now we're thinking oh we're going to be dressed in in this and that and the other thing we are going to be but how do we show up he says dressed in a word certain way because you remember he said call the good and the bad call all of them together he's talked about the marriage supper he says it doesn't make any different what your past life has been he says when you got an invitation to come you're ready to come so whether you are in the streets well-dressed or whether you were drunk and passed out in the hedges in the highways he says it doesn't matter when the invitation comes that's when you're ready to come whether you're on a good part of the road or the bad part of the road when the invitation comes come he says if you have been bad if you've been a streetwalker if you've been a gambler if you've been a drunkard if you've been a murderer no matter what you've been if God gives you the invitation knocking at your heart he will take care of the rest don't weary and say well I've just been a lukewarm church member he will still take care of it if you'll just heed that invitation you say what is the invitation what are the qualifications for this invitation whosoever will let him come and drink of the Water of Life freely he says the invitations to whosoever Will you know maybe we are believers and I believe we are sometimes it feels like life's been just knocking us around and we're having a lot more knocking around than overcoming sometimes that's the way it is it just seems like we can win it's just getting knocked down get knocked down and you're going deeper and deeper where's the overcoming power where's the overcoming faith listen to this he says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord but I'm going down doesn't matter it's ordered of the Lord this ain't fun it's ordered of the Lord we think it's ordered of the Lord when everything's going great and then things start to go downhill we say I must have done something wrong what did I do what did I do what did you do was you were a Son of God you are a son of God and he's working in your life he says and he delighteth in his way can we Delight in our way in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the praise he says now listen to this this is a good man this is a good woman this is a Believer David is talking about here though he fall down what does that mean s you're going to fall down it's going to mean that you're gonna feel you fell down sometimes we don't fall down but we're going down because things aren't going the way we want we say we're falling he says though he fall down though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down you've been knocked around get knocked down he says though you get knocked down he says you won't be utterly cast down in other words you won't be knocked down so bad that you can't get up in other words you're never knocked down to stay down but you're going to get knocked down why why do we keep getting up he says for the Lord upholdeth him with his hands God's holding us up God's keeping us moving God's holding them we know that that famous uh thought or poem or or idea of that man that was walking alongside of Christ and he's walking along the beach and in the sand and there's two sets of footprints and then he looks later and there's only one he says God where did you go and he says that's not where I went that's where I that's the place where I carried you his hand was upholding us amen even if we don't have any strength God won't let us stay down he picks us up and he keeps us moving he keeps us going forward amen he won't let us live in the mud he won't let us live in the dirt he won't let us live in unbelief he won't let us live in a place where we need Deliverance no he'll bring us out of it we've got a living God we've got the same God that Rahab came to amen I'm the Lord thy God I change not it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever amen he still changes lives he still saves souls he still delivers he still provides and he still takes us down broken roads as well David would say I waited patiently for the Lord there's a way to wait patiently patiently he says and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry now where was David when he did this he said he brought me all up also out of a horrible pit David the warrior Prophet a man after God's Own Heart said he brought me out of a horrible pit that's a horrible place a smelly place a place where it's so deep you can't get out the hole is so deep you can't reach and pull yourself out then he says out of the myri clay that's where you can't get your feet out of the mess you're in and then he says and then all of that he set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he had put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord one last quote program says this he says oh there are in all kinds of conditions Lord but Thou Art here to make every crooked path straight you are here to take all the disaster out and put glory in hey man let's stand together if we would you know I look back on my life and many of you know the things that I went through and my family with me and Ministries who sat under and failures of men and failures of churches and failures of families and you know what I happen to believe God led me in all of those places and then you get into it and things start to fall apart or you're not being fed or you're not being used and you say how can God be in any of this how can God bring me to such a flawed place with such flawed people or flawed situations and people walking away from the message and pastors that are living a double life and all these different things and it's really hard really easy rather to look at that and say how can that be God but yet once he puts you into your position you can say he had to do that he had to do that to teach me a lesson he let me learn by somebody else's Problems by somebody else's failures how to guard myself so that in the in the in the future I don't make a bigger mess of things so that I don't rely on gifts so that I don't rely on men so I'm not so I'm learning to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit by the word rather than just gifts and callings and these different things to understand that you can't be in certain positions without certain qualifications that not everybody that says Lord Lord is a Christian they're not everybody that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and says I believe a prophet of Malachi 4 is actually a True Believer that not every church is perfect in fact no church is perfect to drive it home that what all of these things are shaping you for your final purpose and going through it you sit there and you say this is horrible I want out it's no good I'm not enjoying it The Cutting and shaping is never fun but it's always for purpose and what feels like a broken road is really his perfect will to put us in that place in the image of Christ the word expressed for this day amen let me encourage you this morning if you're tired of where you're at wait patiently check your heart check it up with the word by all means we look to our lives and we ought to say Lord is this because I'm doing something wrong am I off am I away am I separated am I dabbling in things I ought not to but if our conscience truly comes back clear then we ought like David we ought to be able to wait patiently for the Lord and he'll take us out of wherever we are with purpose always with purpose all things work together for our good amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you do all things well Lord and we're here to confess it by faith this morning Lord that we believe that all things work together for the good Lord we see these little chapters of our life and some of them maybe are scarier or Lord it seems like oftentimes there's no purpose in it Lord we look at our friends we look at our family sometimes and we say Lord where are you but Lord we're trusting in your mercy and Grace We're trusting in the master artist Lord the one that sees the big picture Lord that you're trimming each one of us for our portion Heavenly Father Lord help us to wait patiently Lord help us to wait Faithfully Faithfully Lord help us to walk in confidence Lord that as you lead and guide us you'll work it for your perfect good Lord God Lord would you just bless and speak to your people we pray or Draw us closer to you in all these things Lord may we rest on the foundation of your word nor may we walk by your spirit every day we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen he brought me out 369. my heart was distressed [Music] [Music] he set my feet
