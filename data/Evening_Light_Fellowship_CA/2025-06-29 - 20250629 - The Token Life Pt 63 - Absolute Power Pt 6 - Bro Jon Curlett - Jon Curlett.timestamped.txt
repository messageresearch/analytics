[13:57] of his death man and the forgiveness
[14:03] of his final breath.
[14:07] Now I can never
[14:10] be the same.
[14:14] My heart has been forever

[20:45] So be my
[20:50] giving my life away.
[20:57] Oh, Father God,
[21:00] you've done such a great thing in our
[21:02] lives that you've allowed us to give our
[21:06] lives away to you. For you made a way,
[21:10] oh Father, by the cross
[21:13] that you purchased us back.
[21:16] You paid the entire price
[21:19] for our sins, for our salvation.
[21:23] For we are the your purchased, your
[21:25] loved ones, the apple of your eye. And
[21:29] we just want to lift praise and honor
[21:31] and glory unto you.
[21:34] And as we gather in your presence this
[21:36] morning, Father,
[21:38] there are many that have got needs and
[21:40] they were read out. You know them,
[21:42] Father. I don't know these people, but
[21:45] you know them intimately, Lord. And we
[21:48] just ask, oh, Father, God, as the one
[21:51] that paid the price, that took the
[21:53] stripes, and by those stripes,
[21:56] you healed us, Father. And we just hold
[21:59] that promise
[22:01] before you
[22:03] for you are faithful in all things,
[22:05] Lord. And we just want to see the great
[22:08] victories that you will rot in each of
[22:11] their lives. We just thank you now,
[22:14] Lord, that we can gather in your
[22:15] presence. And we just ask, Father, that
[22:17] as brother Jonathan comes behind the
[22:20] sacred desk, that you move the man out
[22:22] of the way and let it be your Holy
[22:24] Spirit that ministers to our hearts.
[22:27] And as we leave today, Lord, let us not
[22:32] leave you, but go with us, Lord. Be in
[22:35] our lives every minute, every hour,
[22:37] every day. Draw us closer to you. Make
[22:41] us over into your image, in your
[22:43] character. we ask in the precious name
[22:46] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[22:49] Amen. And amen.

[27:38] God. You go back to God. Come and live
[27:44] in your inheritance.
[27:49] Every place that your feet tread upon
[27:55] that I give to thee.

[30:14] And everything that falls within our
[30:18] Lord,
[30:20] we access it in Christ's name.
[30:26] We don't just stare what he has. We also
[30:30] wear who he is. He's our portion, our

[39:28] Let's start with the chorus. Start with
[39:30] the chorus.
[39:34] [Music]
[39:35] And if that is in love, let's stand.
[39:45] The ocean
[39:47] is dry,
[39:50] man.
[39:52] There's no stars in the sky.
[40:00] And the sparrow
[40:02] can't fly.
[40:08] If that isn't love,
[40:15] then heavens
[40:17] are me.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:22] There's no feeling like this.
[40:27] [Music]
[40:29] If that is in love.
[40:36] If that isn't
[40:39] love.
[40:44] The ocean is dry.
[40:50] There's no stars in the sky.
[40:58] And the sparrow
[41:00] can fly.
[41:05] If that isn't
[41:08] love,
[41:12] then heavens
[41:14] are me.
[41:19] There's no feeling like this.
[41:26] If that isn't
[41:29] love.
[41:33] If that isn't
[41:36] love.
[41:40] The ocean is dry.
[41:47] There's no stars in the sky.
[41:53] [Music]
[41:54] And the sparrow
[41:56] can fly.
[42:01] If that isn't
[42:04] love,
[42:08] then heavens
[42:10] are me.
[42:15] There's no feeling like this.
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] If that is in good.
[42:27] Amen.
[42:29] Let's sing 246. How great thou art.
[42:35] [Music]
[42:38] Oh Lord my God.
[42:44] And I in awome
[42:48] wonder
[42:51] conceiter
[42:53] all
[42:56] the worlds I hands have made.
[43:04] I see the stars.
[43:10] I hear the rolling
[43:14] thunder
[43:17] that power throughout
[43:22] the universe
[43:25] display.
[43:29] Then sings my soul,
[43:34] my savior
[43:36] God to thee.

[43:59] my savior
[44:01] God to thee.
[44:07] How great thou are.
[44:12] How great thou art.
[44:19] And through the woods my
[44:24] and for it glades I wonder
[44:29] and hear the birds
[44:34] sing sweetly
[44:36] in the trees.
[44:41] When I look down
[44:46] lofty mountain
[44:49] grandure
[44:51] and hear the brook
[44:56] and feel the gentle
[45:00] breeze.
[45:03] and sings my soul,
[45:08] my savior
[45:10] God to thee.
[45:15] How great thou was.
[45:22] How great thou was.
[45:28] and sings my soul,
[45:32] my savior
[45:34] God to thee my glory.
[45:40] How great thou are,
[45:46] how great thou are.
[45:52] And when I think
[45:57] that God is son not sparing
[46:03] sent him to die.
[46:08] I scarce can't take him out. Oh glory.
[46:11] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[46:15] And on the cross,
[46:20] my burden gladly.
[46:23] Thank you, Lord.
[46:26] He bled and died
[46:30] to take away my sin. Hallelujah.
[46:38] and sings my soul,
[46:42] my Savior
[46:44] God to thee.
[46:50] How great thou are.
[46:56] How great thou was.
[47:02] and sinks my soul,
[47:06] my Savior
[47:09] God to thee.
[47:14] How great thou art,
[47:20] how great thou are
[47:26] when Christ shall come.
[47:33] aation
[47:37] and take me home man. What joy shall
[47:43] fill my heart.
[47:49] Then I shall bow
[47:54] in humble
[47:56] adoration.
[48:00] And they're proclaiming,
[48:04] "My God, how great thou art."
[48:12] Then sings my soul.
[48:16] [Music]
[48:20] To thee,
[48:24] how great thou art.
[48:30] How great thou art.
[48:36] Then sings my soul,
[48:40] my Savior God to thee.
[48:48] How great thou art.
[48:54] How great thou art.
[48:59] Amen. Hallelujah.

[49:25] want to say we love you, heavenly
[49:27] father. Lord, not just with our words,
[49:29] Lord, but with our lives, our thoughts,
[49:31] Lord, our actions day by day. Lord, I
[49:33] pray that we'd reflect the love that we
[49:35] confess, Lord, through the things that
[49:36] we do and say. Lord, I pray you just
[49:39] take this service now, Lord, that you
[49:41] would take these thoughts, Lord. May you
[49:42] just minister to your people, Lord. May
[49:45] you speak into their lives and
[49:46] situations, Lord, areas I know nothing
[49:48] of, Lord. May you draw us closer to you
[49:51] this morning once again, Lord. May we
[49:52] rise in faith,
[49:54] Lord. May we walk out different than
[49:56] when we came in, Lord. May we may we
[49:58] walk out more like Christ than when we
[49:59] came in, Lord. May we walk out more
[50:01] surrendered than when we came in, Lord.
[50:03] And may we walk out more full of you
[50:05] than when we came in as well. We pray,
[50:07] Lord, bless your people, we ask, Lord,
[50:10] praying a special request for Sister
[50:11] Nikki this morning, Lord God. Lord, your
[50:14] grace that you would raise her up out of
[50:15] her bed, Lord, you see the busy time
[50:17] they're in, Lord. Praying your mercy and
[50:19] grace to her, Lord, Brother Grant also
[50:21] as he's working this morning, Lord. May
[50:23] you be with him as well. We pray in
[50:25] Jesus Christ's name. and we're asking
[50:26] and praying it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[50:29] you. Turn if you would. 1 Peter chapter
[50:32] 4.
[50:33] 1 Peter chapter 4. Amen. Definitely want
[50:36] to keep remembering Sister Nikki,
[50:37] Brother Grant. I spoke with him this
[50:39] morning and he said that he's been with
[50:42] her at the hospital and then came in and
[50:43] headed into a 12-h hour shift. So, he's
[50:45] pretty worn out. So, I said we'd be
[50:47] praying for him and just trusting we
[50:49] will. Amen. Certainly enjoyed the
[50:51] specials this morning. Sister Becky
[50:53] playing and singing. God bless you. And
[50:54] then Sister Moren following up as well.
[50:56] Beautiful. Amen. Both songs were just
[50:58] just beautiful this morning. God bless
[51:00] you. It's always a treat to have those
[51:02] specials in a service. Amen. Two
[51:05] scriptures. I'll just read the first one
[51:06] and we'll read the second one together.
[51:08] But just the first half of Phileiman 1:1
[51:11] says, "Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
[51:15] And then in 1 Peter 4:1 it says, "For as
[51:17] much then as Christ hath suffered
[51:19] suffered for us in the flesh, arm
[51:21] yourselves likewise with the same mind.
[51:24] For he that hath suffered in the flesh
[51:26] hath ceased from sin, that he no longer
[51:28] should live the rest of his time in the
[51:30] flesh to the lusts of men, but to the
[51:33] will of God." Amen. God bless you. You
[51:35] can have your seats again this morning.
[51:36] And we're continuing our series on the
[51:38] Holy Ghost, a tok to token life, and a
[51:40] sixth service on absolute power. And I
[51:43] trust this is hitting home as we start
[51:44] to bring it down the home stretch. I
[51:46] don't think I'll ever stop preaching on
[51:47] the Holy Ghost. That's for sure. But
[51:50] certainly we're going to eventually have
[51:51] to turn this series down and we'll start
[51:53] some other things that the Lord's been
[51:54] leading me within the next few weeks.
[51:56] Amen. Last service we spoke a lot about
[51:58] what leadership looks like. We talked
[51:59] about Paul and the apostles and how we
[52:02] can get to a place where the power of
[52:03] God can flow through us because we're
[52:05] under his perfect leadership. And that's
[52:07] really the key to this series on
[52:09] absolute power. And that's where our
[52:10] focus will be today. And I want to focus
[52:12] on Paul because Paul's a perfect example
[52:14] of what God does with a person that has
[52:16] everything. You know, you look at Peter.
[52:19] Peter didn't have a whole lot. Peter,
[52:22] the scripture says, he was ignorant and
[52:23] unlearned. Peter was a fisherman.
[52:25] Peterman was a bluecollar worker. Peter
[52:27] was not well educated. He wasn't known
[52:29] for his intellect. He wasn't known for
[52:31] his panache, his his great uh ability to
[52:34] speak or anything like that. Peter
[52:36] didn't have a whole lot going on for
[52:37] him. And so maybe we'd say, well, it's
[52:39] easier for Peter to lay things down
[52:41] because he didn't have a whole lot going
[52:42] for him. Peter was never going to be a
[52:43] big man in the town or in the village or
[52:45] in the church or anything like that. But
[52:47] when you look at Paul, Paul had
[52:49] something to bring to the table. In
[52:50] fact, Paul had everything you'd think
[52:52] you'd need to be a great believer. And
[52:54] if we go back to the book of
[52:56] Philippians, we see Paul's own
[52:58] estimation for himself. And this is not
[53:00] Paul bragging. This is Paul looking back
[53:02] on what he was versus what he is. And
[53:05] it's a good thing to remember how he
[53:07] does this. He says this, "Though I might
[53:09] also have confidence in the flesh, if
[53:12] any other man thinkketh that he had
[53:14] whereof he might trust in the flesh, I
[53:16] more." Now, that's a really complicated
[53:18] sentence. Let me break it down into
[53:19] English from another translation. It
[53:21] says, "This is Paul speaking now, the
[53:23] prophet to the age. Others may brag
[53:25] about themselves, but I have more reason
[53:28] to brag than anyone else."
[53:31] That's Paul's starting place. See, Peter
[53:34] was a nobody. Peter, all Peter brought
[53:37] was a a an overestimation of his courage
[53:41] and his commitment. That's all really
[53:43] Peter brought to the table. Paul, on the
[53:45] other hand, says, "Before I came to
[53:47] Christ, if anyone had reason to brag, I
[53:50] did." Who has two thumbs up and is
[53:53] awesome? Paul.
[53:55] Paul had a great estimation of himself
[53:57] before he came to Christ. He says, "I
[54:00] was circumcised the eighth day of the
[54:02] stock of Israel, of the tribe of
[54:03] Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, as
[54:06] touching the law of a Pharisee, an
[54:07] impeccable uh pedigree, an impeccable
[54:10] family, the best of the best, trained
[54:12] and taught to be a Pharisee." Now, that
[54:15] word Pharisee is special in its own
[54:17] because it means separatist.
[54:19] And the inference there was that they
[54:21] were separated from sin. In other words,
[54:24] if you were a Pharisee, you were the
[54:25] elite believers in the church.
[54:28] You are better than the other believers
[54:30] in the church because your very name
[54:33] declared, "I am separated from sin and
[54:35] my life backs it up."
[54:38] So Paul was the best of the best inside
[54:40] of the church.
[54:42] And we'll see that the best of the best
[54:43] are often the worst of the worst.
[54:46] I'm sorry to say it that way, but Paul
[54:48] called himself the chiefest of sinners.
[54:50] Church, I'm not putting Paul down. Paul
[54:51] said, "I am the chiefest of sinners."
[54:55] Because look at what he did with
[54:56] everything he had. That's what his real
[54:59] sin was. Misapplied religion. He said,
[55:03] "Concerning zeal, I was persecuting the
[55:05] church. Touching the righteousness which
[55:08] is in the law, I was blameless." In
[55:11] other words, Paul thought before he came
[55:13] to Christ that the life that he lived
[55:15] was perfect and acceptable before
[55:17] Almighty God.
[55:21] that under the law of Moses, he could
[55:24] walk into the presence of God and God
[55:26] would accept him. That's what Paul
[55:28] thought about himself, church. His claim
[55:31] before he was born again was that he was
[55:32] blameless.
[55:35] That's arrogance.
[55:40] We look at this
[55:42] and if we were to summarize Paul to this
[55:44] point,
[55:46] we'd say he was on the fast track.
[55:48] On the fast track in the church. on the
[55:51] fast track in politics, on the fast
[55:53] track to influence, on the fast track to
[55:56] being somebody. That's what Paul was on.
[55:59] He had everything going his way. Amen.
[56:03] Educated, knew the scriptures, knew how
[56:06] to apply them. Paul knew everything it
[56:09] took to be a wonderful believer.
[56:12] But yet, we look in verse 7 and he says
[56:14] these words, "But what things were
[56:16] gained to me? Those I counted lost for
[56:19] Christ." That same translation I read
[56:20] earlier says these things were my assets
[56:23] but I wrote them off as a loss for the
[56:26] sake of Christ. He says yeah doubtless
[56:29] and I count all things but loss for the
[56:32] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[56:34] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[56:37] the loss of all things and to count them
[56:39] but dung that I may win Christ. Church,
[56:42] you know what happened to Paul here?
[56:44] Paul fell out of love with himself and
[56:47] he fell into love with Jesus Christ.
[56:49] That's what happened. We can bring so
[56:51] much to the table and we can bring a
[56:53] little, we can bring a lot, but there
[56:54] are things that we think are great about
[56:56] ourselves
[56:58] and we can fall so in love with those
[57:00] things. Paul says everything's lost.
[57:03] There is nothing worth taking but dung.
[57:06] He says it's poop.
[57:09] I don't know if you know this, but it's
[57:10] not worth a whole lot unless you're a
[57:13] farmer.
[57:14] everything. He says, "I count
[57:17] everything.
[57:20] Everything a loss compared to gaining
[57:22] Christ."
[57:26] It can be easy to elevate ourselves so
[57:28] many times based on our Christian
[57:31] heritage, based on the fact that you
[57:33] might be a a minister's spouse or a
[57:35] minister's child or the founder of the
[57:38] church or these different things. I'm
[57:39] not preaching at anyone this morning by
[57:40] God's grace. But we can elevate
[57:42] ourselves based on what was and what we
[57:45] have and what we bring to the table. And
[57:48] that has absolutely nothing of value in
[57:50] God's eyes. Has nothing of value in
[57:52] God's eyes. I believe it was brother
[57:54] Jason Watkins said, you know, uh, sons
[57:56] of prophets are the ones that have the
[57:58] worst track record. Sons of ministers
[57:59] and sons of prophets, don't lose heart,
[58:01] Jonathan Jensen and Samuel this morning,
[58:04] but it's the ones that are coming out of
[58:06] the great ministries and great families
[58:07] that tend to struggle. So, heritage
[58:09] doesn't get you anywhere in the eyes of
[58:11] God. It's a one-on-one experience where
[58:14] he comes in and he changes our life.
[58:15] Amen.
[58:18] It can be easy to take our position in
[58:20] church and the influence that we have
[58:22] and the respect we've been given and our
[58:24] ability to sway decisions and these
[58:26] things and we think we're somebody. Now,
[58:30] sometimes we say, "Well, I don't think
[58:31] that."
[58:33] But let something go the way you don't
[58:35] think it should go in the church. And
[58:37] that's when you find out, have I
[58:38] elevated myself above the leadership of
[58:40] the Holy Spirit in the local body. Amen.
[58:44] We can get to the place we are so
[58:46] convinced of our rightness that we can
[58:48] never be corrected.
[58:51] I was talking with someone the other day
[58:54] and I said, "Sometimes things have to go
[58:56] against what we firmly believe is the
[58:58] leadership of the Holy Spirit or his
[59:00] will for a local body or a church just
[59:02] to see what our attitude's going to be."
[59:06] that God could literally point us in the
[59:08] wrong direction just to see what our
[59:10] attitude is going to be like when it
[59:11] doesn't go the way that we want. When
[59:13] things are voted in the church a certain
[59:14] way, when the the pastor, the deacons
[59:16] make decisions. We've gone through this
[59:18] in this church, haven't we? We've gone
[59:19] through five years, we went through
[59:21] COVID where we had all sorts of things.
[59:22] And what did it do, church? It proved
[59:24] our attitudes.
[59:26] As we've had transitions in leadership,
[59:28] what does it do? It proves our
[59:29] attitudes.
[59:31] Are we there for me
[59:33] or are we there for the body? And more
[59:35] to the point, are we there to have and
[59:37] do what God would have and do?
[59:41] Paul learned humility really quickly.
[59:44] Because with everything that he had
[59:45] learned, he had never learned humility.
[59:48] With all of the great things that he
[59:49] had, his knowledge of the scripture, his
[59:51] training, sitting under the greatest
[59:52] teacher of that time, none of that had
[59:54] taught Paul humility. But once he had an
[59:56] experience with Christ and got knocked
[59:57] off of his horse on the road to
[59:58] Damascus, Paul learned humility real
[1:00:00] fast. Because what he realized is
[1:00:03] everything I've been living, everything
[1:00:05] I've been believing, everything I've
[1:00:07] been doing is 100% contrary to what is
[1:00:10] right. That's a humbling moment. That's
[1:00:13] a humbling moment. Amen. But we see
[1:00:16] Paul, even if he even as he moved into
[1:00:19] his ministry, he became the prophet to
[1:00:21] the age. He became the instructor to the
[1:00:22] age. He was the highest authority of
[1:00:24] that age. And you'll see Paul never
[1:00:26] pointed to himself unless he could do it
[1:00:28] to benefit somebody else. And he'd say,
[1:00:31] "Listen, help them as you would help me
[1:00:34] if I was there. Treat them like you
[1:00:36] would treat me. The honor you give me,
[1:00:38] give it to somebody else because they're
[1:00:39] the ones that need it." Paul used his
[1:00:41] own power and authority to benefit
[1:00:44] everybody else. And took nothing for
[1:00:45] himself. To the point where he went to
[1:00:47] certain churches and he says, "I won't
[1:00:49] even take your tithes. I'll work with my
[1:00:51] hands so that you have nothing to hold
[1:00:53] against me to say he's in it for
[1:00:55] himself." And so he sat down. He did
[1:00:58] tent making for a while and these
[1:01:00] different things.
[1:01:02] But sometimes we need to stop and take
[1:01:04] inventory of where we are.
[1:01:07] By that I mean take inventory of where
[1:01:09] we're headed, what we're doing, and what
[1:01:12] it's producing in our lives. Because
[1:01:14] it's really easy to say, "I'm a
[1:01:16] believer. I'm a child of God. I believe
[1:01:19] this message. Therefore, I am blessed."
[1:01:23] And literally rest on the fact that we
[1:01:24] are a believer, a child of God. and
[1:01:26] never lift a foot, never move our hands,
[1:01:30] never get involved with anything, never
[1:01:32] seek after God.
[1:01:34] We can literally be cruising along,
[1:01:37] church. A cruising Christian is usually
[1:01:39] a lazy Christian. When we lose that
[1:01:42] fervor, we lose that zeal, we lose that
[1:01:44] desperation for the refreshing of the
[1:01:46] presence of God. When we lose that, we
[1:01:49] lose the victory
[1:01:51] because we we redo, we push him out and
[1:01:53] other things start to creep into our
[1:01:54] lives.
[1:01:56] We'll say, "God will take care of me.
[1:01:58] God's got his hand in my life. I'm
[1:01:59] good."
[1:02:01] Yes, he's there, but we're in a battle,
[1:02:03] church. We're in a battle. We've got to
[1:02:05] be fighting every single day.
[1:02:07] Overcoming. See, we've turned overcoming
[1:02:09] too many times into avoiding the fight
[1:02:11] instead of winning the fight. We've
[1:02:13] turned blessing into I don't have to
[1:02:15] fight.
[1:02:16] That's not the promise, church. The
[1:02:18] promise is for the overcomer, not the
[1:02:20] avoider.
[1:02:22] We're not supposed to go around seeking
[1:02:24] fights, but we're in a battle day by
[1:02:26] day. And if we're not feeling the
[1:02:27] squeeze, I question whether we're in a
[1:02:28] battle.
[1:02:31] If we're not in any sort of desperation,
[1:02:33] if there's nothing that's pressing on
[1:02:34] us, I wonder if we're really in a
[1:02:36] battle. I've never been in a real
[1:02:38] battle. I've been in an airsoft.
[1:02:41] And that alone spikes your temperature.
[1:02:43] It spikes your heart rate.
[1:02:46] Things slow down.
[1:02:48] Every crackling branch is a deadly enemy
[1:02:51] sniper
[1:02:53] or brother Joe on a rampage.
[1:02:57] I know what it's like to be in a fake
[1:02:58] battle. And guess what? There are
[1:03:00] moments where you do desperate things
[1:03:02] where you dive and you roll into into
[1:03:05] ground that you don't even know what
[1:03:06] what waits for you because you just
[1:03:08] don't want to get shot.
[1:03:12] You don't cruise through battles.
[1:03:15] You don't. It's handto hand. It's
[1:03:18] desperate. It's hard every single day.
[1:03:22] Amen. We've got to be able to look at
[1:03:25] this privilege that we have as believers
[1:03:27] and say, "What am I producing in my
[1:03:30] life?"
[1:03:32] Because if all we're doing is producing
[1:03:34] what Paul said
[1:03:36] before his conversion, which is what?
[1:03:39] I'm the best of the best. I'm the elite
[1:03:40] of the elite. I know the scriptures. I'm
[1:03:43] well taught.
[1:03:45] That's not the fruit of Christ. That's
[1:03:47] the fruit of men. That's the fruit of
[1:03:49] religion. That's the fruit of
[1:03:51] denomination.
[1:03:53] Saying, "I know the message inside and
[1:03:54] out. I know the mysteries. I know what's
[1:03:56] under the seven seals. I know all the
[1:03:58] quotes." That won't get you there.
[1:04:01] Knowing the truth won't get you there.
[1:04:02] You've got to become the truth. You've
[1:04:04] got to become the life. You've got to
[1:04:05] become the way. You've got to be what
[1:04:07] you read about. Amen. Brandon would say
[1:04:09] this. He says, "I've always believed in
[1:04:11] shouting and jumping, but I've always
[1:04:14] said, don't jump any higher than you
[1:04:15] live because the world is going to watch
[1:04:17] that." You see, he says, "You must just
[1:04:20] jump as high as you live because
[1:04:22] somebody is watching you." And there the
[1:04:24] greatest stumbling block that the world
[1:04:25] has got is the man or woman who
[1:04:27] professes to be a Christian and lives
[1:04:29] something different from their
[1:04:31] profession.
[1:04:32] He says, "Always don't judge your life
[1:04:34] by how much power you have to perform
[1:04:36] miracles."
[1:04:38] See, we think absolute power is what I
[1:04:40] can do.
[1:04:42] He says, "And we don't judge ourselves
[1:04:44] by how much knowledge we have of the
[1:04:45] word." He says, "But always judge
[1:04:48] yourself looking back and taking
[1:04:51] inventory of what kind of fruit that the
[1:04:54] life you presently live now is bearing."
[1:05:00] See, past decisions and past fruit are
[1:05:02] okay, but what's happening today?
[1:05:05] What power is flowing through our life
[1:05:07] today?
[1:05:09] Remember, he is the vine. We are the
[1:05:10] branches. If we bore fruit last season,
[1:05:13] that's great. But what are we doing this
[1:05:14] season? A ship doesn't sail on
[1:05:17] yesterday's wind.
[1:05:19] We can't live off of yesterday's
[1:05:21] experience. There's got to be something
[1:05:22] that's flowing through us day by day by
[1:05:25] day. Jesus said, "I've ordained you that
[1:05:27] your fruit would remain." It's a
[1:05:30] constant producing of the life of Jesus
[1:05:33] Christ. And we see with Paul that he
[1:05:36] took him from a man that had everything
[1:05:38] to a man that could produce everything.
[1:05:41] It wasn't what he brought to the table.
[1:05:43] It's what the life of Christ produced
[1:05:44] with him. And Paul became a completely
[1:05:46] different man. He went out on the back
[1:05:48] side of the desert in Arabia for three
[1:05:50] and a half years. And God took did a
[1:05:53] work with Paul. Paul took, God took Paul
[1:05:55] and he just hung him over a cliff by his
[1:05:58] feet and he shook him and let everything
[1:06:00] that Paul thought was of value fall out
[1:06:02] of his pockets, fall out of his life,
[1:06:05] fall out of his mind. See, Paul couldn't
[1:06:06] come in and say, "I know the
[1:06:08] scriptures." The Holy Ghost had to take
[1:06:10] every scripture he'd memorized and tied
[1:06:12] together and untie all those knots.
[1:06:16] Because Paul had tied himself into an
[1:06:18] antichrist knot with his religious seal.
[1:06:20] So God had to come in and cut every one
[1:06:23] of those links, every one of those
[1:06:24] beliefs, every one of those ties, every
[1:06:27] one of those concepts, every one of
[1:06:28] those doctrines, every one of those
[1:06:30] isms, every righteousness that he
[1:06:32] thought he had. And God had to take them
[1:06:34] and dump them over a cliff so that he
[1:06:37] could flip them, stand them up on his
[1:06:38] two feet, and get them squared away.
[1:06:41] That's the only way God can ever work
[1:06:42] with us. Amen. The Holy Spirit had to
[1:06:44] come in and now Paul has to look through
[1:06:46] the lens of what? Truth and life.
[1:06:51] It's not religion now. It's not a man's
[1:06:52] teaching. But now he's got life on the
[1:06:54] inside. And it brings revelation. And he
[1:06:57] starts to what? Put the picture back
[1:06:59] together of the scriptures so that he
[1:07:01] sees Jesus Christ in every single page.
[1:07:03] And the thing that he was persecuting
[1:07:05] became the thing that he believed. And
[1:07:07] this is Paul's testimony now in Acts.
[1:07:10] This is his testimony after God is
[1:07:11] finished with him in the desert. He
[1:07:13] says, "But this I confess unto thee,
[1:07:15] that after the way which they call
[1:07:18] heresy, so worship I, the God of my
[1:07:21] fathers, believing all things which are
[1:07:23] written in the law and the prophets." In
[1:07:25] other words, the way that I used to
[1:07:27] think is right is now wrong. And the way
[1:07:29] I used to think is wrong is now right.
[1:07:33] Paul's had a complete 180°ree turnaround
[1:07:36] in his life. And he couldn't do that by
[1:07:38] carrying forward anything he brought to
[1:07:40] the table. He had to lay every single
[1:07:44] thing down. Amen. He's reading the same
[1:07:48] book,
[1:07:49] but something's different. And he's got
[1:07:51] a different filter now. And it's the
[1:07:52] filter of the Holy Spirit. See, church,
[1:07:54] if we've got if we think we know it all,
[1:07:58] there's no room for God.
[1:08:00] What can he add if I think I know it
[1:08:02] all? If I think I have it all, then God
[1:08:05] can't do anything because there's no
[1:08:07] room for him to add it. So Paul had to
[1:08:09] be emptied out so that Christ could be
[1:08:11] poured in. So that the true revelation
[1:08:13] of the word could be poured into his
[1:08:14] heart and his soul and his mind.
[1:08:17] But when Paul really realized how wrong
[1:08:20] he was, it was the greatest thing that
[1:08:21] ever happened to him.
[1:08:23] It was the greatest thing that ever
[1:08:25] happened to him. He says three and a
[1:08:27] half years down there laying in the word
[1:08:29] and finding out that the very God that
[1:08:31] called him was taking him back and
[1:08:33] changing all of his intellect, changing
[1:08:36] all that he ever thought, all that he
[1:08:38] had trained to be. All his ambition just
[1:08:41] wiped it away from him and he became a
[1:08:43] prisoner. The love of God had been so
[1:08:47] tremendous, such a revelation that he
[1:08:49] could not get away from it. I said this
[1:08:51] at the beginning that Paul fell out of
[1:08:53] love with himself
[1:08:55] and he fell in love with Jesus Christ.
[1:08:58] He says that's the true experience of
[1:08:59] every real believer who meets God. You
[1:09:02] come in contact with something that's so
[1:09:04] great that you become a prisoner. You
[1:09:06] get away from everything to imprison
[1:09:08] yourself to this. It's expressed one
[1:09:11] time where Jesus said, "The kingdom of
[1:09:12] heaven is something like a man buying
[1:09:14] pearls that when he finds that great
[1:09:16] pearl, he sells all that he's got it to
[1:09:19] get that one." He says, "And that's the
[1:09:21] way here." You have an intellectual
[1:09:24] conception, you have an a theological
[1:09:26] experience, but when it comes to a time
[1:09:29] that you really find the real thing, you
[1:09:31] just sell out everything else and you
[1:09:33] close yourself to this.
[1:09:40] I spoke earlier of that quote and read
[1:09:42] it about looking at our lives and
[1:09:45] judging ourselves. But I want to ask us
[1:09:48] this morning, does our life's fruit
[1:09:50] represent a soldout condition?
[1:09:55] A truly soldout condition. See, we want
[1:09:58] all the power. We want the blessings. We
[1:10:00] want the authority. We want the impact.
[1:10:04] But will we let go of whatever it takes
[1:10:06] to get it?
[1:10:08] We've got to let go of all we are, all
[1:10:10] we know, all we have, all we want,
[1:10:14] so that we can have what he has. That's
[1:10:15] the only way it's going to work. It's an
[1:10:17] all or nothing proposition. Amen. Are we
[1:10:20] willing to let go of whatever it takes
[1:10:22] to get what God has for us?
[1:10:24] What is it where I'm willing to lay down
[1:10:26] this morning?
[1:10:29] You say, "Brother John, there's nothing
[1:10:30] I would lay down.
[1:10:33] There's nothing I wouldn't lay down."
[1:10:36] If you've never given your life, that's
[1:10:37] the problem. You won't lay it down. And
[1:10:39] if you have given your life so many
[1:10:41] times, what's holding us back is we
[1:10:42] won't lay down that little thing. That
[1:10:45] little thing, cuz it's worth too much to
[1:10:47] us. It's worth too much to us. And
[1:10:51] sometimes it's a blessing we've got. We
[1:10:54] won't give down that blessing. Sometimes
[1:10:56] it's relationships, sometimes it's
[1:10:58] habits, sometimes it's ministry,
[1:10:59] sometimes it's position, sometimes it's
[1:11:01] money,
[1:11:03] sometimes it's that that ease and
[1:11:04] relaxation that we have in our life. And
[1:11:07] we come to a place where we say, "God,
[1:11:08] you have you can have anything, but you
[1:11:10] can't have that." Now, we will never say
[1:11:12] that. We will never say that. But our
[1:11:15] actions speak for us. Because if I say,
[1:11:18] "God, you can have anything but that,"
[1:11:20] then that would tell the truth on me,
[1:11:21] wouldn't it? And one thing I don't do
[1:11:23] well is tell the truth on myself. That's
[1:11:25] what the Holy Spirit's for. Brother Bram
[1:11:27] says the Holy Ghost will tell the truth
[1:11:28] on you. That's what the preaching of the
[1:11:30] word is for is to tell us the truth when
[1:11:32] we can't say it ourselves. Amen. But if
[1:11:36] you've got these things and you say your
[1:11:39] actions say I won't let it go,
[1:11:42] that tells you you probably need to let
[1:11:44] it go. It tells you you probably need it
[1:11:47] to go because where your treasure is,
[1:11:50] that's where your heart is also. And
[1:11:51] whatever it is you won't give up for
[1:11:52] God, that's where your treasure is.
[1:11:55] That's where your bottleneck is. That's
[1:11:56] where the knot is.
[1:11:59] That's got everything kinkedked up
[1:12:00] inside of our lives. Like I said, we
[1:12:03] won't say it out loud, but our actions
[1:12:04] will say that. Now, let me speak
[1:12:07] personally, okay? Let me let me pick on
[1:12:09] myself
[1:12:10] because I've had to have this
[1:12:12] conversation already with myself. I was
[1:12:13] talking with some people about this
[1:12:15] recently. What if God came down and
[1:12:17] said, "John, I want you to go full-time
[1:12:18] ministry." no day job.
[1:12:23] What would that look like?
[1:12:26] Well, one, let me start with the
[1:12:28] reasoning we typically use. God gave me
[1:12:30] that job. It's a blessing. It's a
[1:12:32] provision. I'm not stressed out about
[1:12:34] it. It I can do it and still stay
[1:12:36] relaxed. I I'm uh uh it it helps drive
[1:12:40] me. I enjoy it. I enjoy the people. I
[1:12:42] enjoy the work. I get all these things
[1:12:44] from it. God gave it to me. Church, the
[1:12:46] Lord gives and the Lord takes away. What
[1:12:48] he is gives as a blessing today may be a
[1:12:51] trap tomorrow because he's got something
[1:12:54] better for us
[1:12:56] sometimes than what he's already given
[1:12:58] us. There are stages of life and
[1:13:00] sometimes we've got to let go of that
[1:13:02] thing that we enjoy so much to take what
[1:13:03] he has that's so much better.
[1:13:06] Amen. I can come up with a million
[1:13:08] reasons why I should not give up my day
[1:13:10] job.
[1:13:12] For one, life is a whole lot easier when
[1:13:14] I've got a regular day job. It's easier
[1:13:17] for me financially. It's easier for my
[1:13:18] family. It's easier for this church.
[1:13:22] But the question is not is it good or
[1:13:25] bad for me. It's what is the Lord's will
[1:13:27] for me. And so I say this, I hope if and
[1:13:30] when he tells me, I say, "Lord, I'll lay
[1:13:33] it down." Because I'll tell you this,
[1:13:34] church, if he doesn't, I'll start to
[1:13:36] realize the impact of turning God down.
[1:13:39] It doesn't go well. It doesn't go well.
[1:13:42] Especially for ministers.
[1:13:45] Especially for ministers. We've got to
[1:13:47] be so obedient to those things because
[1:13:49] God is using us in very particular ways.
[1:13:51] And if we don't yield, the people suffer
[1:13:54] and you would pay for my indecision or
[1:13:56] my lack of willingness to lay that down.
[1:13:58] Amen. We don't always have to let go of
[1:14:01] bad things. Sometimes it's good things
[1:14:03] that are just taking up our time. And
[1:14:06] God wants more of our time. You want
[1:14:07] more of God, you got to give him more of
[1:14:09] your time. And sometimes we've got to
[1:14:10] lay down things that are not bad in and
[1:14:12] of themselves,
[1:14:13] but he just needs more of our time.
[1:14:17] Listen to this. He says he had learned
[1:14:20] speaking of Paul
[1:14:22] on the backside of the Arabian desert
[1:14:24] there when all his former things and
[1:14:26] experiences and ambition that he had
[1:14:28] been stripped of those things. He says
[1:14:31] now that's where we find today that we
[1:14:33] must be stripped first and people don't
[1:14:36] want to be stripped.
[1:14:38] The Methodist brother wants to hold a
[1:14:40] little bit of his Methodist teaching.
[1:14:41] The Baptist brother wants to hold a
[1:14:43] little bit of his Baptist teaching. We
[1:14:44] covered this, remember when we talked
[1:14:46] about traditions and bringing in
[1:14:47] doctrines of men and teachings of men
[1:14:49] and these different things today. But we
[1:14:51] can hold on to things because we're
[1:14:52] convinced they're good and they're from
[1:14:54] God. And the fact that we have to let
[1:14:56] them go doesn't change the fact that
[1:14:57] they're good or are from God. All it
[1:14:59] means is that he wants us to let go so
[1:15:01] that he can do something else with us.
[1:15:03] Okay? What's a blessing today might be a
[1:15:06] trap tomorrow. We talk about golden
[1:15:09] handcuffs where you got have a job that
[1:15:10] pays you so much money, but you're
[1:15:12] miserable and it's killing your family
[1:15:13] life. It's killing your church life.
[1:15:17] Golden handcuffs. You say it's a
[1:15:18] blessing. I have this much money. Is it
[1:15:19] a blessing when it impacts our our
[1:15:21] service to the body? It can't be. It's
[1:15:23] not a It's not a blessing. It can't be
[1:15:25] those things. I was reading this quote.
[1:15:27] I I this thought was going through my
[1:15:29] head as I was studying. Hold all things
[1:15:31] loosely. And it was Corey Tboom. Do you
[1:15:33] remember Corey Tenboom? She was a
[1:15:34] Holocaust survivor. She said, "I've
[1:15:36] learned that I must hold everything
[1:15:38] loosely because when I grip it tightly,
[1:15:40] it hurts when the father pri my fingers
[1:15:43] loose and takes it from me.
[1:15:46] Hold all things loosely."
[1:15:49] You know, Paul would even say, he'd talk
[1:15:51] about, he'd say, "Listen, don't even say
[1:15:52] you're going to go somewhere and do some
[1:15:54] business. We're going to go and we're
[1:15:56] going to gain and we're going to sell
[1:15:57] and we're going to make money." He said,
[1:15:59] even in those little things, he says,
[1:16:00] "Say if the Lord wills."
[1:16:04] if the Lord wills. He says, "But you've
[1:16:07] got to be." He says, "The world doesn't
[1:16:08] want to be stripped." He says, "But
[1:16:10] you've got to absolutely be stripped of
[1:16:12] everything and just born again aresh and
[1:16:16] take up from there and let the Holy
[1:16:18] Spirit lead." You can't say, "Well, now
[1:16:20] my daddy said when he got went in, he
[1:16:22] went in the church and he shook hands
[1:16:23] with the pastor. He's a good loyal
[1:16:25] member." He says, "That might have been
[1:16:26] all right for his race, but we're in
[1:16:28] another race." He says, "Now we must
[1:16:30] come back to the Bible times for this
[1:16:34] day.
[1:16:35] What's what was allowed back then may
[1:16:37] not be allowed today. The standard is
[1:16:40] not loosening, church.
[1:16:43] The standard never changes.
[1:16:45] But we're coming back to that." And so
[1:16:48] what worked for yesterday may not work
[1:16:50] today because God will not look past
[1:16:52] ignorance in an age when the book is
[1:16:53] completely open. We have no reason for
[1:16:55] these things. Remember we spoke last
[1:16:59] service about Paul was going through
[1:17:00] Asia and the Holy Spirit said, "Don't
[1:17:02] preach in Asia." And Paul said, "Okay,
[1:17:04] no big deal. I was walking through. I
[1:17:05] figured I'd preach, but there was no
[1:17:07] burning desire to do it. That's just
[1:17:08] what I do. I preach everywhere I go."
[1:17:11] But then remember, he wanted to go to
[1:17:12] Bethna and there was a a longing, a
[1:17:14] personal desire there. And the Holy
[1:17:16] Spirit said, "No, don't do it. Keep
[1:17:18] going." And that's always the challenge
[1:17:21] of our faith. And that's when we find
[1:17:23] out if we've been stripped down. And
[1:17:25] stripped out is when the Holy Spirit
[1:17:26] comes and says, "That desire you have in
[1:17:28] your heart, you can't have it." And will
[1:17:30] we lay down our ambition? Will we lay
[1:17:32] down that desire? Will we lay down that
[1:17:34] fervor for something? And it can
[1:17:37] literally be that, church. It can be an
[1:17:39] absolute burning fervor to do something
[1:17:41] for God. And there's nothing wrong with
[1:17:43] it. But God says it's not my will.
[1:17:47] That's what shows if we're stripped down
[1:17:49] is our is our attitude when he says
[1:17:51] those things to us. We read this quote
[1:17:53] last time, but I really intended it for
[1:17:55] this service. I'm going to read it
[1:17:57] again. This is speaking of Paul and he
[1:17:59] says he knew that he could not go to
[1:18:00] places being harnessed to this what
[1:18:02] harnessed to the Holy Spirit. But yet he
[1:18:04] wanted to go. He knew that his ambition
[1:18:08] drew him amongst brethren where he was
[1:18:09] invited to come. And yet he was pressed
[1:18:11] in the spirit to do something else. He
[1:18:14] wasn't his own. Maybe somebody could
[1:18:16] say, "Brother Paul, we want you to come
[1:18:17] over because we have the biggest church.
[1:18:19] We have the biggest congregation. Your
[1:18:21] offerings will be great." He says, "But
[1:18:23] being pressed in the spirit," he
[1:18:24] thought, "I got a brother over there.
[1:18:27] I'd like to go over and save this
[1:18:28] brother. Get him to the Lord." Now, see,
[1:18:31] there are natural reasons to go, and
[1:18:33] then there's spiritual reasons to go.
[1:18:34] The size of the offering is not the
[1:18:36] reason we go. Now, let me tell you this.
[1:18:40] God will provide for you. And sometimes
[1:18:42] you'll go to a place where you know
[1:18:43] you're going to get a good offering cuz
[1:18:44] you need it.
[1:18:46] But watch now while he comes around and
[1:18:47] he says he drops into Paul's mind and
[1:18:49] Paul's not thinking about offerings, but
[1:18:51] Paul's thinking about I've got a brother
[1:18:52] there that I want to preach to. I got a
[1:18:54] brother that needs to be saved. There's
[1:18:56] nothing church more spiritual than
[1:18:58] saving a soul.
[1:19:00] And he's dropping down into the mind of
[1:19:02] a prophet which is there are souls there
[1:19:04] that need this message that I'm
[1:19:05] bringing.
[1:19:07] He says, "But yet the spirit pressed him
[1:19:09] to go somewhere else."
[1:19:11] He was a prisoner. And now he says these
[1:19:13] words, "Oh God, make us prisoners
[1:19:17] like that from our own selfish ambition,
[1:19:21] from our own judgments and our better
[1:19:23] way of thinking to be a prisoner of
[1:19:26] Jesus Christ." Now, we're preaching on
[1:19:28] absolute power again. And the power of
[1:19:30] God can only flow through a person that
[1:19:33] has given control over to him. That's
[1:19:35] the only way it can work. Amen. That's
[1:19:37] the way God works. But look at the traps
[1:19:39] that are listed here. The first thing
[1:19:42] the prophet says, he says, is selfish
[1:19:44] ambition. Now, the trap here is that
[1:19:47] you're doing something godly, but for
[1:19:49] personal gain or benefit.
[1:19:52] In other words, it's a win-win.
[1:19:56] I can go do something for God. It looks
[1:19:58] good. It benefits others. And it
[1:20:00] benefits me. But the reason I'm doing it
[1:20:02] is not for them. The reason I'm doing it
[1:20:04] is for me.
[1:20:06] And that's not going to work. That's
[1:20:08] never going to work. Amen. That's an
[1:20:10] absolute curse to a Christian is when
[1:20:12] we're doing something because it
[1:20:13] benefits me and somebody else, but our
[1:20:16] real reason is because it benefits me.
[1:20:18] That's selfish ambition.
[1:20:21] It's selfish ambition.
[1:20:24] Remember God told Paul, he says, "Appeal
[1:20:26] to Caesar."
[1:20:28] And Paul appealed to Caesar. And it
[1:20:30] takes him what, a year and a half, two
[1:20:31] years to get there. And when he gets
[1:20:33] there, all on his journey, he's writing
[1:20:35] letters. When he's there, he's writing
[1:20:36] letters and in the end he finishes the
[1:20:38] the most of the New Testament and then
[1:20:40] he gives his life. Not fun. Not a fun
[1:20:44] time. Imprisoned, shipwrecked, all these
[1:20:47] different things.
[1:20:48] But that was God's will. Paul had no
[1:20:51] selfish ambition when he appealed to
[1:20:52] Caesar. It was exactly what God told him
[1:20:55] to do. And there was not a whole lot
[1:20:57] good in that for Paul. If we're speaking
[1:20:59] carnally, he didn't have freedom to
[1:21:02] visit. He didn't have freedom to go
[1:21:03] preach everywhere. He had about 14 years
[1:21:06] before that and then after that it was
[1:21:07] off to Caesar and he really never got to
[1:21:09] go much. He had a little interlude in
[1:21:11] there where he was able to go off and
[1:21:12] come back and then after that it was
[1:21:14] they chopped his head off I believe.
[1:21:17] Not exactly an ambitious trip and that's
[1:21:20] what we're talking about. When it's
[1:21:22] God's ambition, not ours, it usually
[1:21:25] doesn't look so good for us. Amen.
[1:21:29] But throw this one out. Selfish
[1:21:31] ambition. Then he says personal
[1:21:33] judgment. This is our opinions of
[1:21:36] situations
[1:21:38] of people. Who's in? Who's out? Who's a
[1:21:40] real believer? Who's a pretended
[1:21:42] believer? Who's not a believer? Who made
[1:21:44] the right decision? Who made the wrong
[1:21:45] decision?
[1:21:47] We all do it.
[1:21:51] Personal judgment.
[1:21:54] I'm not saying get rid of your
[1:21:55] discernment, church. But the thing is
[1:21:57] this. To have discernment for others,
[1:21:59] you must first have self-disc.
[1:22:01] That's the only way it will work. And I
[1:22:03] found the more self-determinment I have,
[1:22:06] the less I want to focus on brother
[1:22:07] Vichel.
[1:22:11] Why?
[1:22:13] Cuz this guy needs a whole lot of work.
[1:22:16] This guy needs so much work day by day
[1:22:19] by day that I don't have a whole lot of
[1:22:20] time to wonder about whether brother
[1:22:22] Vichel's in or out, good or bad. Making
[1:22:25] decisions I agree with or don't agree
[1:22:27] with.
[1:22:28] The arrogance
[1:22:31] that somebody might do something I don't
[1:22:33] agree with.
[1:22:35] Wow.
[1:22:38] Personal judgment.
[1:22:40] Then he says the better way of thinking.
[1:22:42] That's trying to do God's will your way.
[1:22:46] Okay?
[1:22:47] God's will means you got to do it God's
[1:22:49] way. If it's God's will, then it's God's
[1:22:52] way. If it's your will, it's your way.
[1:22:54] But you can't do God's will and your
[1:22:55] way. It doesn't work. It's one or the
[1:22:57] other. Amen. God's the absolute, not us.
[1:23:00] Amen. So, we don't have a right to
[1:23:01] inject our opinions, our experiences,
[1:23:04] our way of doing things, whatever that
[1:23:06] might be. We can we can see God's will.
[1:23:09] This is the way it works. We see God's
[1:23:10] will and then we apply our way of
[1:23:12] thinking to create a path that will
[1:23:15] produce the result that he's talked
[1:23:16] about. And we'll see all the pieces that
[1:23:18] need to be moved. We'll see all the
[1:23:20] people that need to be changed, the
[1:23:21] walls that need to be broken, the doors
[1:23:23] that need to be opened, walls that need
[1:23:25] to be broken down, tunnels that need to
[1:23:27] be dug. And we've got this grand master
[1:23:30] plan and we're a great chess master and
[1:23:32] God's sitting back there in the corner
[1:23:34] saying, "Silly humans,
[1:23:37] silly humans, will they ever learn?"
[1:23:42] I I think he giggles sometimes.
[1:23:44] Maybe not, cuz Jesus would always say,
[1:23:46] "Oh, ye of little faith, how long will I
[1:23:49] suffer you?"
[1:23:50] Cuz we come in and we think we've got
[1:23:52] it. We figured it out. We know his will.
[1:23:55] Therefore, we know his way. And that is
[1:23:57] not the way it works. It is his will and
[1:24:00] it is his way. Amen. We need leadership.
[1:24:04] Amen. We need to be led by the spirit,
[1:24:07] not sitting there trying to make all
[1:24:08] these things happen because we know what
[1:24:10] should happen. Now, as I was studying
[1:24:12] this, I thought of Noah.
[1:24:15] You know that there's a saying that uh
[1:24:18] amateurs built the ark and professionals
[1:24:19] built the Titanic.
[1:24:21] But when you look at Noah's ark, it it's
[1:24:23] quite quite a marvel because remember
[1:24:26] God told Noah to build an ark and he
[1:24:27] told him how to build it. He told him
[1:24:29] what to build it out of. He told him the
[1:24:30] construction methods. He told him how to
[1:24:32] waterproof it. All these different
[1:24:33] things. And maybe Noah had some idea of
[1:24:35] how to handle it building a ship. But
[1:24:38] all we know is that he built it exactly
[1:24:40] the way that God built it. Now there was
[1:24:43] a Korean team that did a bunch of
[1:24:45] engineering analysis on Noah's ark. And
[1:24:47] this is published if you go to uh that
[1:24:49] that uh creation website. They've got
[1:24:52] they've got it there and they have a
[1:24:54] link to the fully technical things. But
[1:24:55] they did a an engineering stress
[1:24:57] analysis and a motion analysis for
[1:24:59] Noah's ark for flood conditions and they
[1:25:02] came up with some really interesting
[1:25:04] things. So what they found is that the
[1:25:06] ark is not the best boat design in all
[1:25:09] conditions.
[1:25:11] You'd think that's God's design. it
[1:25:13] should be able to do everything because
[1:25:14] what they did was they took Noah's ark
[1:25:16] according to the dimensions that God
[1:25:17] said built to the materials assigned a
[1:25:20] certain value to the the wood strength
[1:25:21] and these different things but then what
[1:25:22] they did was they did what they felt
[1:25:24] would be an optimal solution that would
[1:25:27] produce the same internal volume to
[1:25:29] carry the same number of people and
[1:25:30] animals so they did their design they
[1:25:33] took conventional ship designs that are
[1:25:35] out there for these same purposes and
[1:25:37] they compared them to Noah's arc and
[1:25:38] what they found is Noah's Ark was not
[1:25:39] the best in all situations but it was
[1:25:41] always in the top seven. Okay. But so it
[1:25:46] wasn't the best with the biggest waves.
[1:25:48] It wasn't the best with a confused sea
[1:25:50] where waves are coming from all
[1:25:51] different directions,
[1:25:53] but it was consistently near the top in
[1:25:55] all of those tests. Noah's arc could
[1:25:57] handle a wave that was 155 ft tall.
[1:26:01] That's as high as the Scotia Center
[1:26:02] downtown St. John's. As far as I know,
[1:26:05] that's the tallest building down in St.
[1:26:06] John's. Noah could handle that without
[1:26:08] founding.
[1:26:10] 155 ft tall. It is 13 times more stable
[1:26:14] than the modern requirement for a
[1:26:15] passenger ferry. In other words, you
[1:26:17] could take Noah's ark today and put it
[1:26:19] immediately into ferry service and it
[1:26:21] would pass all tests for stability. In
[1:26:23] other words, it wouldn't rock and roll
[1:26:26] and pitch
[1:26:28] to make people sick. It's 13 times
[1:26:30] better than the minimum standard. Okay?
[1:26:34] But catch this church. There was one way
[1:26:37] and one test that it beat all others and
[1:26:41] that was in a a sea where there was a
[1:26:43] prevailing wind that produced consistent
[1:26:46] wind direction,
[1:26:50] wave direction.
[1:26:53] And that's the key element because after
[1:26:54] 40 days of chaos which the ship would
[1:26:57] survive it faced 330 days of the wind
[1:27:02] blowing in one direction producing large
[1:27:04] waves because there was nothing to
[1:27:06] disrupt the wind. You see what was
[1:27:08] happening was the whole earth was
[1:27:10] covered top to bottom. And so when the
[1:27:12] wind blows it's just going from one
[1:27:14] direction. It's not blowing from all
[1:27:16] different directions because it's
[1:27:17] muddied up by mountains sticking up out
[1:27:18] of the ground and valleys and vortexes
[1:27:20] and all these things. the winds blowing
[1:27:21] in one direction at any given time. And
[1:27:24] so the waves are going in one direction
[1:27:26] and Noah's ark was the best with big
[1:27:28] waves blowing in the same d going in the
[1:27:30] same direction all the time. Why,
[1:27:31] church? Cuz God knew the conditions.
[1:27:35] God knew the prevailing conditions that
[1:27:36] that boat was going to have to survive.
[1:27:38] 40 days of confus and then 330 days. He
[1:27:42] built it for the 330 days. So they were
[1:27:45] most comfortable, strongest in a boat
[1:27:47] that was designed for the exact
[1:27:48] conditions they went through. church.
[1:27:50] What does that tell me? One, it tells me
[1:27:52] God's a better engineer than I am. With
[1:27:54] all of my stress uh calculation
[1:27:57] software, our simulation software and
[1:27:59] and our knowledge of materials and all
[1:28:00] these things, he knows what he's doing.
[1:28:04] And if we'll just listen to what he
[1:28:05] tells us to do, the results fall into
[1:28:08] his hands now instead of ours. And we
[1:28:11] get exactly what he promised. Amen. I
[1:28:14] know I've said it before, but I want to
[1:28:15] bring it to this situation. And when God
[1:28:17] called me to the ministry, I said, "I
[1:28:19] don't think that's a good idea."
[1:28:22] Why? Because I'm a curlet and I'm an
[1:28:24] engineer.
[1:28:26] And that's a deadly combination. Because
[1:28:28] those people think they're usually
[1:28:30] right,
[1:28:32] always right. They want things a certain
[1:28:34] way. They like to be in control. They
[1:28:37] like things to be predictable. They
[1:28:39] don't like change.
[1:28:42] They like to perform to perfection. And
[1:28:44] they don't like to make mistakes.
[1:28:46] We call it paralysis by analysis.
[1:28:50] Working so hard to be perfect that you
[1:28:52] never do any work. You never get
[1:28:54] anywhere. You never do anything. And
[1:28:56] church, I don't know if you know this,
[1:28:57] but ministers can't be perfect.
[1:28:59] Ministers can't be in control. They
[1:29:01] can't perform.
[1:29:03] Ministry is not about performance.
[1:29:06] It's become performance, but it's not
[1:29:09] about performance. It's not about
[1:29:11] perfection. In fact, we make many
[1:29:13] mistakes. Brother Joe has a he has a
[1:29:15] compendium of my mistakes over the
[1:29:17] pulpit. The funny ones
[1:29:20] like uh blonde eyes and blue hair if you
[1:29:23] remember that doozy.
[1:29:27] In other words,
[1:29:29] you know why I didn't think it was a
[1:29:31] good idea? Because I didn't want to do
[1:29:33] all that changing.
[1:29:35] Who wants to do all that changing? I'd
[1:29:37] rather stay right all the time.
[1:29:42] I'd rather stay in control. Now, you
[1:29:45] know that as a believer, God's never
[1:29:46] going to let you get away with that,
[1:29:47] even if you're not a minister. But the
[1:29:49] simple fact is when I looked at what I
[1:29:51] was by nature, the son of Lanny and
[1:29:53] Sandy Klette, and what God was calling
[1:29:55] me to as a son of God,
[1:29:58] there was a great gulf between those
[1:30:00] two.
[1:30:01] and he was going to fill it in with the
[1:30:03] powdered remains of my natural man,
[1:30:07] coat it over with grace and the blood of
[1:30:09] Jesus Christ to make a path over to
[1:30:10] where I needed to be.
[1:30:13] But God didn't say, "You're right or
[1:30:16] you're wrong." God doesn't have to
[1:30:17] answer our questions or he's above that.
[1:30:21] All he said was, "I've called you. What
[1:30:23] are you going to do? Yes or no?" I said,
[1:30:25] "Yes, Lord."
[1:30:28] Here we are.
[1:30:33] For my thoughts are not your thoughts.
[1:30:38] Neither are your ways my ways,
[1:30:41] sayeth the Lord.
[1:30:44] For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:30:45] earth,
[1:30:47] so are my ways higher than your ways
[1:30:50] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[1:30:53] We can look at things. We can look at
[1:30:55] people. We can look at situations. We
[1:30:57] can look at decisions and think, "I've
[1:30:59] got it figured out." We think we've got
[1:31:02] the moves that have to be made, the
[1:31:04] people that have to go here, the things
[1:31:05] that have to go there. Like I said,
[1:31:07] God's just sitting back and saying,
[1:31:08] "Silly human. Silly human."
[1:31:12] Remember Christopher Robin, Winnie the
[1:31:15] Pooh? Silly Pooh Bear. I think that's
[1:31:18] what God's doing many times.
[1:31:20] We're trying to figure it out.
[1:31:22] trying to make it happen and it'll never
[1:31:25] work that way.
[1:31:27] He says you might have to walk contrary
[1:31:29] to your better judgment.
[1:31:31] He says maybe in a certain organization
[1:31:34] you might think they could lift you up
[1:31:35] and give you something great that you
[1:31:37] might flash. He says but how what do you
[1:31:39] find yourself? You find yourself
[1:31:41] defeated after a while until God can get
[1:31:44] a man that's willing to become a
[1:31:45] prisoner to him. See you'll go a while
[1:31:47] and you'll see some success but it won't
[1:31:50] last. You're a flash in the pan. It's
[1:31:54] quick and then it's gone.
[1:31:57] He says God is looking for prisoners.
[1:31:59] He's always done it. You might search it
[1:32:01] through scripture. A man has to be a
[1:32:03] prisoner to Christ and against anything.
[1:32:05] He says, "Therefore, you cannot be
[1:32:07] connected with anything but Christ. Even
[1:32:11] your father, your mother, your brother,
[1:32:14] your sister, your husband, your wife,
[1:32:17] anybody." He says, "You're only
[1:32:20] connected with Christ and him only. Then
[1:32:22] God can use you and until then, you
[1:32:24] can't." I want to dwell on that for a
[1:32:27] moment because sometimes our connections
[1:32:28] are what get us into trouble.
[1:32:31] Amen. They're what hinder growth. They
[1:32:32] would hinder correction. They're what
[1:32:34] hinder the spirit of God from moving
[1:32:35] amongst the people.
[1:32:38] Amen. They are what allow
[1:32:40] politics to play in the church and keep
[1:32:43] a cleaning out from happening too many
[1:32:45] times.
[1:32:46] We can be so committed to preserving our
[1:32:49] image or somebody else's, their
[1:32:51] reputation, their ministry, their
[1:32:54] position that we never allow the spirit
[1:32:57] of God to handle situations correctly.
[1:33:00] I've seen churches fall because the
[1:33:02] minister was supported instead of the
[1:33:04] word. And I'm speaking specifically of
[1:33:06] my experience in Texas.
[1:33:08] Well, what was it? Close friend,
[1:33:11] charismatic, everybody loved him. and we
[1:33:15] laid the word aside
[1:33:18] because we understood the way he was. We
[1:33:21] didn't really understand the way he was,
[1:33:23] but we gave him a pass because well,
[1:33:26] that's just the way he is. We know
[1:33:28] that's a weakness of his. We know that,
[1:33:29] you know, he's not us he's not always on
[1:33:31] time and he's a little scatterbrained
[1:33:32] and these different things. But when it
[1:33:34] starts to impact the way you're
[1:33:35] ministering, the way you handle the the
[1:33:37] the congregation, the sheep,
[1:33:40] when you start seeing a minister coming
[1:33:42] in and he's a young man and he's reusing
[1:33:44] notes because he's clearly not studying,
[1:33:46] things like that. And what did we do? We
[1:33:49] pushed it aside. So, I don't blame that
[1:33:51] man. He bears blame for what he did and
[1:33:55] for staying in the pulpit in the
[1:33:56] condition he was in. But I blame myself
[1:33:58] because I elevated him above the word of
[1:34:00] God.
[1:34:02] Because why? The minute you do something
[1:34:04] like that, it throws a wrench into the
[1:34:07] middle of the church. What are we going
[1:34:09] to do? How are we going to pull through
[1:34:10] it, church? The thing is, if we don't
[1:34:12] fix it, we're never going to pull
[1:34:13] through it. It's just a grenade that's
[1:34:15] going to blow at some point or another.
[1:34:16] It's better to do it by the word rather
[1:34:18] than do it because you finally find out
[1:34:20] what that person is and what they're
[1:34:21] doing. If we could nip it in the butt up
[1:34:23] front, we'd be a healthier, cleaner
[1:34:26] church every single time. Healthier
[1:34:28] families, all of these different things,
[1:34:30] it applies. Amen. But I put my
[1:34:32] relationship with that man. He was my
[1:34:34] best friend there in Texas. I put my
[1:34:36] relationship with him above the word.
[1:34:38] And so when it was all said and done,
[1:34:39] I've said this before. I said, "Lord,
[1:34:40] how in the world did you let this
[1:34:42] happen?" And the thing that came back
[1:34:43] was you knew what my word said about
[1:34:45] these things and you put it aside
[1:34:47] because you understood that man.
[1:34:50] It was my fault. as a deacon in the
[1:34:53] church for not saying we need to sit
[1:34:55] down and talk through some things.
[1:34:58] We're a part of the body of Christ
[1:34:59] church, but it's the Holy Ghost that
[1:35:01] keeps us together. Not the power of a
[1:35:03] man's ministry, not his influence, not
[1:35:06] his character even. It is the spirit of
[1:35:09] God that brings us and baptizes us into
[1:35:11] one body. And if we're wrong, we've got
[1:35:14] to be able to repent. We've got to be
[1:35:16] able to admit it. And we've got to be
[1:35:17] able to make it right. Amen. We see Paul
[1:35:20] going around and Paul was no respector
[1:35:22] of persons. And by that I mean Paul
[1:35:24] didn't back down because somebody was a
[1:35:25] big shot in the church. Look at what he
[1:35:27] did with Peter
[1:35:29] in Galatians. It says, "But when Peter
[1:35:31] was come to Antioch, I withtood him to
[1:35:35] the face because he was to be blamed."
[1:35:37] Paul does the harder work. He went and
[1:35:38] he talked to Peter face to face. He
[1:35:41] didn't write Peter a scathing email or
[1:35:43] letter or a text. He went and he said,
[1:35:44] "Pete, we need to talk."
[1:35:47] He says, "For before that certain came
[1:35:49] from James, he did eat with the
[1:35:51] Gentiles, but when they were come, he
[1:35:52] withdrew and separated himself, fearing
[1:35:54] them which were of the circumcision." So
[1:35:56] before James and some Jews came along,
[1:35:58] Peter was eating and fellowshipping with
[1:35:59] the Gentiles. Peter wasn't even living
[1:36:02] according to the Jewish law church. He
[1:36:04] had let many of them go. But as soon as
[1:36:06] James and other Jews came, he separated
[1:36:09] from the Gentiles who were his brothers
[1:36:11] in Christ. And he went and he only sat
[1:36:13] and ate with the Jews. and he lived a
[1:36:15] Jewish life all over again.
[1:36:18] It's amazing how we can be fearless with
[1:36:20] the world and we bow down before
[1:36:23] somebody that's a believer believer.
[1:36:25] They're believers, but that we'll bow
[1:36:28] down before the opinion of a professing
[1:36:30] believer whose opinion needs to be
[1:36:31] brought subject to the word. but because
[1:36:34] of their position in the church, because
[1:36:35] they're a minister, a deacon, an
[1:36:37] officer, uh whatever it might be, an
[1:36:39] elder, we bow down before that instead
[1:36:41] of saying, "Okay, we got an issue here."
[1:36:47] He says, "And the other Jews," watch
[1:36:48] what happens. Peter does this, "And the
[1:36:50] other Jews dissembled likewise with them
[1:36:52] in so much that Barnabas also was
[1:36:54] carried away with their dissimulation."
[1:36:55] So others started to do as Peter did.
[1:36:57] They saw Peter dysfellowshipping with
[1:36:59] the Gentiles, and they backed off as
[1:37:00] well from their brothers and sisters. So
[1:37:02] now they're causing an offense in the
[1:37:03] church, a stumbling block.
[1:37:06] And who's the cause? Peter, Mr. Keys to
[1:37:09] the kingdom.
[1:37:10] He says, Paul says, "But when I saw that
[1:37:12] they walked not uprightly according to
[1:37:15] the truth of the gospel, I said unto
[1:37:17] Peter before them all. If thou being a
[1:37:20] Jew livest after the manner of the
[1:37:22] Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why
[1:37:24] complies, why compelst thou the Gentiles
[1:37:27] to live as do the Jews?" He called Peter
[1:37:29] out for his hypocrisy. He said, "Peter,
[1:37:30] you're not living like a Jew, but now
[1:37:31] you're trying to get the Gentiles to
[1:37:33] live like Jews.
[1:37:35] You got a double standard here, Pete.
[1:37:39] You're a hypocrite, Pete.
[1:37:43] Church, we're not here to protect
[1:37:44] reputations." You know how you protect a
[1:37:46] reputation? You keep it in accordance
[1:37:49] with the word of God. Because it's no
[1:37:51] reputation if it's not upheld by the
[1:37:53] word of God. That's not a reputation I
[1:37:55] want. So, it doesn't matter who we are.
[1:37:59] Amen. When we're wrong, we're wrong. And
[1:38:01] we need to be withstood graciously and
[1:38:04] with love the way the scripture says.
[1:38:08] I said before, I've had a brother
[1:38:09] correct me two times on something.
[1:38:12] I had to be able to take it and thank
[1:38:14] him for it rather than get all puffed
[1:38:17] up. And who do you think you are? And
[1:38:20] what do you think you're seeing? And
[1:38:21] you're wrong and you're No, no, no.
[1:38:23] Humble ourselves to the word. Humble
[1:38:26] ourselves one to another to the word.
[1:38:29] and then watch what happens. We've got
[1:38:31] to be able to do it.
[1:38:35] It's okay to say there's a double
[1:38:38] standard being applied here. And we see
[1:38:40] it a lot in general. I'm speaking in
[1:38:43] general. As far as I know, I'm not
[1:38:45] speaking to anything in this church, but
[1:38:47] who knows? The Lord knows. But we can
[1:38:50] elevate somebody so high that they can't
[1:38:52] be corrected. And that is never the way
[1:38:54] that the Holy Spirit works. Never. Ever.
[1:38:57] Ever. Ever. Amen. We're in obedience to
[1:39:00] the same word. And I'll say it this way,
[1:39:02] the standards higher for those of us
[1:39:03] that serve, the ministers, the deacons,
[1:39:06] the trustees, the treasurer, song
[1:39:09] leader, whatever it be. If you're in a
[1:39:12] position, a voted position in
[1:39:13] particular, the standard is higher for
[1:39:15] us to live a life that is accountable to
[1:39:17] the word of God.
[1:39:20] Amen.
[1:39:23] You look at this. Do you think Paul
[1:39:25] enjoyed this? Do you think Paul enjoyed
[1:39:28] going to Peter and correcting him in
[1:39:29] front of the church?
[1:39:32] Nope. Why did he do it? Because Paul had
[1:39:35] lost his will. Paul had lost his will a
[1:39:38] long time ago. And so he did as the word
[1:39:41] required, as the spirit required. Paul
[1:39:43] called himself, I read it in in
[1:39:44] Phileiman 1:1 there at the beginning,
[1:39:46] Paul called himself a prisoner of Jesus
[1:39:48] Christ. And this wasn't just some
[1:39:49] romanticized, you know, theme or or or
[1:39:53] phrase that he had coined up to make
[1:39:54] himself sound good, church. He was a
[1:39:56] literal prisoner to Jesus Christ. He had
[1:40:00] no freedom of his own. He had no will of
[1:40:02] his own. He had no thought of his own.
[1:40:03] He was completely subject to the spirit
[1:40:06] of God. When he called himself a
[1:40:07] prisoner, it was a true reflection of
[1:40:09] exactly what he was. Brother Bram says
[1:40:11] it this way. He says he was bound. He
[1:40:13] was bound by a chain and by feathers of
[1:40:17] love to do the will of God and that
[1:40:20] only. He was a prisoner. He was in
[1:40:22] fetterss of love. He was in the yoke
[1:40:24] with Christ. He could yoke up with
[1:40:26] nothing else because he was yolked with
[1:40:28] him. And where the lead went, that's
[1:40:31] where he had to go. Regardless of how
[1:40:33] green the the pasture was here on this
[1:40:36] side or that side, he had to go the way
[1:40:38] that the leader and the yoke went.
[1:40:42] What is a green pasture here?
[1:40:46] Distractions,
[1:40:48] opportunities,
[1:40:52] something that looks better than what
[1:40:53] you have right now.
[1:40:56] might be a bigger business opportunity.
[1:40:58] It might be a higher paying job. It
[1:40:59] might be career advancement. Might be a
[1:41:01] nicer vehicle. Might be a vehicle in and
[1:41:04] of itself. A house, a bigger house. It's
[1:41:07] easy to look at those things when
[1:41:08] opportunity comes and say, "I'm a child
[1:41:10] of God. It's for me."
[1:41:13] Let me tell you, it's not. It's not
[1:41:15] always. Sometimes it is and sometimes it
[1:41:18] isn't.
[1:41:19] It's like we were talking about earlier.
[1:41:21] We've got to come to the place where we
[1:41:23] look at where we're at in our lives and
[1:41:24] say, "What is the fruit of what I've
[1:41:25] decided thus far?" And then when
[1:41:28] opportunity comes, we say, "What is the
[1:41:30] probable fruit of this decision?"
[1:41:34] Because if we look at an opportunity and
[1:41:37] it's not going to produce more of the
[1:41:38] life of Christ, in fact, it's going to
[1:41:40] diminish where I'm at,
[1:41:43] it can't be of God.
[1:41:45] If it's going to push Christ out of our
[1:41:47] life so we can pull in more of this
[1:41:48] opportunity, it can't be of God. That's
[1:41:52] not the way that he works. This is a
[1:41:53] pouring out of the world, not a pouring
[1:41:57] in of opportunity. Amen.
[1:42:01] As I said last service to you business
[1:42:02] owners, you want a bigger business, more
[1:42:06] revenue, bigger opportunities,
[1:42:10] you better make sure that that change
[1:42:11] doesn't include less church, less
[1:42:14] fellowship, less family time, less
[1:42:17] energy.
[1:42:18] Cuz why? You've got a kingdom purpose
[1:42:22] and you've got a ministry that requires
[1:42:23] those things to be fulfilled.
[1:42:26] If more business means less of the
[1:42:27] things of God, that's a greener pasture,
[1:42:30] but it's not God's greener pasture. It's
[1:42:32] just a temptation.
[1:42:35] For those of us with an employer,
[1:42:38] is that promotion going to tie us down
[1:42:40] or free us up?
[1:42:42] I remember when I first went into
[1:42:44] management, I said, I'm a 40-hour a week
[1:42:46] guy. I said, unless it's special and
[1:42:49] emergency
[1:42:52] concerns.
[1:42:54] And I said, "Business as usual is not an
[1:42:57] emergency."
[1:42:58] And so I worked 40 hours a week in
[1:43:01] senior management positions. And I went
[1:43:03] into those jobs with them knowing that,
[1:43:06] saying, "This is what I do. I'm not here
[1:43:07] to make it look like I'm working a ton.
[1:43:10] I'll get more done in 40 than most do in
[1:43:12] 60, but I'm not going to work 60 just to
[1:43:14] please you."
[1:43:17] Why? Because I knew that it could tie me
[1:43:20] down. I had other things that needed my
[1:43:22] attention. I had a wife. I had children.
[1:43:26] Eventually I have ministry and these
[1:43:27] sort of things.
[1:43:29] Amen. Sometimes a promotion comes with
[1:43:31] an understanding that certain agendas
[1:43:33] and ideas will be supported. I've stated
[1:43:35] here I can't go into management where
[1:43:37] I'm working now because there are things
[1:43:39] that the federal government supports
[1:43:42] that they embrace that they idolize that
[1:43:45] they promote that I can't do now as a
[1:43:48] just a regular grunt, a regular
[1:43:51] employee. I can be there and not have to
[1:43:53] deal with that. But as a manager, you
[1:43:54] have to do it. And so unless I came up
[1:43:57] with an agreement with them that I don't
[1:43:58] have to do it, I could never be that
[1:44:00] because it would go against the word of
[1:44:02] God. But here's the thing. Why would I
[1:44:04] even walk down that road in the first
[1:44:06] place? It's just opening up a can of
[1:44:09] worms. Why would I open up a battle that
[1:44:12] in the end I'm not going to win? Because
[1:44:14] I'll leave. There's no winning that. So
[1:44:17] why go down there in the first place?
[1:44:19] But being able to sit down and say,
[1:44:21] 'Lord, what's going to come out of this
[1:44:23] decision? And is it more of you or is it
[1:44:26] more for me? Because too many times more
[1:44:29] for me is what's going to win out cuz
[1:44:30] much craves more.
[1:44:33] We look at our sisters.
[1:44:36] What are your green pastures? I always
[1:44:38] get nervous on these things.
[1:44:42] So, I've got to go home to a wife and a
[1:44:45] visiting wife.
[1:44:47] I've got to deal with all the men
[1:44:48] calling me up after and saying, "Brother
[1:44:49] John, why did you say that about the
[1:44:51] women?" No, it's not true. But I don't
[1:44:53] know the way women think. But what are
[1:44:56] your greener pastures?
[1:44:58] Sometimes it's all about health and
[1:44:59] fitness.
[1:45:02] But let me tell you, when you became a
[1:45:04] mother, you had to give up some of that,
[1:45:05] didn't you? It's inevitable
[1:45:09] because when it's all about you and you
[1:45:11] have all the time in the world, you can
[1:45:13] be the healthiest, fittest woman in this
[1:45:14] planet. But the minute you add a child
[1:45:16] to it, now the child gets priority over
[1:45:18] you sisters.
[1:45:21] And you got to give up something, don't
[1:45:22] you? But that greener pasture can be
[1:45:26] give me a schedule so that I can be the
[1:45:28] way I used to be. It's never going to
[1:45:30] happen. Not if you're serving Christ
[1:45:32] because it's a life of service, not a
[1:45:34] life of selfishness.
[1:45:36] Sometimes it's that we can get the
[1:45:38] beautiful clothes and shoes that we
[1:45:39] want. A new purse every month, the new
[1:45:43] Jimmy shoes.
[1:45:45] I don't think anybody here has Jimmy
[1:45:47] shoes. Can't imagine. They're really,
[1:45:49] really expensive shoes. That's all I
[1:45:51] know. With really, really high heels.
[1:45:53] So, we're double whammedi here on that.
[1:45:55] Sisters know Jimmy shoes.
[1:45:57] But hey, we've all got things we like.
[1:46:00] We've all got things we want to have.
[1:46:02] Sometimes it's about getting the kids
[1:46:04] into school so that I can go back to
[1:46:05] doing what I want to do. Freeing up my
[1:46:08] day. I admire our sisters
[1:46:12] that are homeschooling. God bless you
[1:46:14] for it. What a sacrifice. What an
[1:46:16] absolute sacrifice to do that. Now, some
[1:46:19] of you don't quite have the pleasure
[1:46:20] yet, but you're going to. I think
[1:46:23] it's tough. It's work every single day.
[1:46:30] But I'll tell you, there's a greener
[1:46:31] pasture that says, "Hey, I can just send
[1:46:33] them off and let somebody else do it."
[1:46:35] That may be the Lord's will for you. I'm
[1:46:37] not here to tell you it is or it isn't.
[1:46:39] But if the reason you want to do it is
[1:46:40] to free yourself up, that's where
[1:46:42] selfishness creeps in.
[1:46:44] Sometimes it's trying to dump the load
[1:46:46] on hubby
[1:46:48] so I can have more time for myself.
[1:46:52] Hey, husbands, we've got to be willing
[1:46:53] to jump in.
[1:46:55] We're perfectly capable of filling and
[1:46:57] emptying a dishwasher and vacuuming and
[1:47:00] these things.
[1:47:02] But there are things that are for the
[1:47:04] women and there are things that are for
[1:47:04] the men. There's roles for both. And
[1:47:07] usually what greener pastures look like
[1:47:09] is less for me to do and more for
[1:47:10] somebody else to do.
[1:47:14] Sometimes we just want a certain type of
[1:47:15] lifestyle.
[1:47:18] We want things to be a certain way
[1:47:20] because it works well for the way I am.
[1:47:23] No, this is a molding and shaping
[1:47:25] process. And he molds us to his word,
[1:47:28] not us. We don't mold his word to us.
[1:47:33] What is God's will in it? That's what we
[1:47:34] look for. I'm not going to criticize you
[1:47:37] if you send your kids to public school,
[1:47:38] private school, or home school. I've
[1:47:40] been in all of them and did well.
[1:47:42] Actually, no. We've had people in all of
[1:47:44] them is what I meant to say. I went to a
[1:47:47] public school. We've got kids here went
[1:47:49] to a private school. We got kids that
[1:47:50] are homeschooled. And guess what?
[1:47:52] They've all thrived and they've all had
[1:47:53] issues. You can keep them in your house
[1:47:56] all day long and they're still going to
[1:47:57] have issues. Church, it's not about
[1:47:59] issues or no issues. It's about what is
[1:48:00] the will of God. And when you latch on
[1:48:02] to the will of God, that's what keeps us
[1:48:04] moving forward. And it keeps our eyes
[1:48:06] tunnel visioned to his will and his
[1:48:08] purpose so that those greener pastures
[1:48:10] just don't appear.
[1:48:12] What's his will in it? Amen.
[1:48:15] He says, "Oh, tonight if we could only
[1:48:17] become prisoners, to our own selfish
[1:48:20] being, to our own ambition, that we
[1:48:22] could completely surrender ourselves and
[1:48:24] be yolked to him. No matter what the
[1:48:26] rest of the world thinks, what the rest
[1:48:28] of the world does, we're yolked with
[1:48:29] fedters of love. We are prisoners." He
[1:48:32] says, "My feet are so yolked to Christ
[1:48:34] that they won't dance. My eyes are so
[1:48:36] yolked to Christ that when I see these
[1:48:37] modern strip teases on the street, he
[1:48:39] turns my head away from, not to."
[1:48:43] Amen.
[1:48:46] He says, "My heart is so yolked in love
[1:48:48] to him till I can't have love for this
[1:48:51] world anymore." He says, "My will is so
[1:48:54] yolked to him till I don't even know
[1:48:56] what my ambitions are."
[1:49:00] He says, "Just whatever you lead, I'll
[1:49:02] follow, Lord. I'll be a prisoner." Can I
[1:49:05] talk about ambition for a moment? I have
[1:49:07] big ambitions.
[1:49:10] You know, I was originally going to
[1:49:12] become a doctor.
[1:49:15] The guy that did my eye surgery booked
[1:49:17] almost $2.2 million last year. I told my
[1:49:21] wife, I wish I'd become an
[1:49:22] opthalmologist,
[1:49:24] carnally speaking. Can you imagine?
[1:49:26] Can you imagine what a wonderful
[1:49:29] lifestyle that man has?
[1:49:32] But you know what we do today? This is a
[1:49:34] trap for believers. We say, "Here's my
[1:49:37] ambition. Lord, please come and bless
[1:49:40] it." And what are we doing, church?
[1:49:42] We're trying to add God to our ambition
[1:49:45] knowing that God in it will bless it.
[1:49:48] The problem is if it's not God's
[1:49:50] ambition, God ain't going to bless it.
[1:49:52] But what do we do? Because we're good
[1:49:54] believers, we say, "God, I want to add
[1:49:56] you to my plan." Because that's what
[1:49:57] Christians do. No. Christians lay down
[1:50:00] their plan and say, "God, what's your
[1:50:01] plan?" But too often, we're trying to
[1:50:03] add God to our ambition, God to our
[1:50:06] plan, God to our way of doing things,
[1:50:08] and saying, "See, I'm a Christian. God's
[1:50:09] in it." That's not the way it works.
[1:50:12] It's God's plan, God's way, not my plan
[1:50:16] with God in it. That's not the way it's
[1:50:18] ever going to work. Sometimes our
[1:50:20] testimony is God gave me what I asked.
[1:50:22] And what we don't realize is that there
[1:50:24] was a bigger testimony if we would have
[1:50:25] laid it down. God could have given us so
[1:50:28] much more.
[1:50:31] He said Paul was correctly a prisoner.
[1:50:34] He wasn't making a wrong statement. He
[1:50:36] was trained by the Holy Ghost again to
[1:50:39] wait on the word. See, Paul had been
[1:50:40] trained to do certain things. He had
[1:50:42] been trained to speak the word, use the
[1:50:44] word, apply the word, and now he had to
[1:50:46] go and unlearn and retrain everything
[1:50:49] that he had ever thought he knew. He
[1:50:51] said, now he had been trained one way,
[1:50:53] but God had trained him another way.
[1:50:54] Now, he was trained by the Holy Spirit
[1:50:57] to wait upon the Lord no matter what his
[1:51:00] ambitions were.
[1:51:03] Paul was a perfect example of somebody
[1:51:05] that God just took and turned upside
[1:51:06] down, smooshed him up, broke him apart,
[1:51:11] and then rebuilt him completely into a
[1:51:13] son of God.
[1:51:15] And he's no different than you and I.
[1:51:18] Yes, he's a prophet. I'm not a prophet.
[1:51:19] You're not a prophet. But the process is
[1:51:21] no less different for you and I. We come
[1:51:24] in thinking we have something, thinking
[1:51:26] we know something. Especially if we're
[1:51:28] raised right. We can come in thinking,
[1:51:29] "Lord, I'm going to bring something to
[1:51:31] the table." No, we have to lay it all
[1:51:32] down. I said it before when I was raised
[1:51:35] in this message, believed it. I believed
[1:51:37] everything that Brother Jerald was
[1:51:38] preaching. Absolutely, I did.
[1:51:41] Intellectually,
[1:51:42] I acknowledged it was the truth. Maybe
[1:51:44] that would be the way to go. But when I
[1:51:46] received the Holy Ghost, everything I
[1:51:48] looked at changed. And what I thought
[1:51:51] was right was not quite as right as I
[1:51:52] thought. And what I thought was wrong
[1:51:54] was not the way I thought it was wrong.
[1:51:56] I was more gracious with people. Why?
[1:51:58] because I needed that same grace for
[1:52:00] myself.
[1:52:01] But it completely changed the way I
[1:52:03] looked at things. I had to lay that
[1:52:04] down. I had to make some apologies
[1:52:09] because I had been reset,
[1:52:13] a grand reset and built up in a
[1:52:16] different way.
[1:52:20] Paul's came to the place where he says
[1:52:21] there can be no other foundation laid
[1:52:23] than that which is already laid, which
[1:52:25] is Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[1:52:28] That's it. And Paul got to the place
[1:52:30] where he was so built on Christ, you
[1:52:32] couldn't move him, you couldn't threaten
[1:52:34] him, you couldn't push him, you couldn't
[1:52:37] influence him, you couldn't do nothing.
[1:52:38] He was completely rooted in Christ
[1:52:40] himself. But I want to take one last
[1:52:43] example this morning.
[1:52:48] And I want to go to Moses because I
[1:52:49] think Moses is perhaps the greatest
[1:52:51] example of pure raw power that we ever
[1:52:53] see coming through a man
[1:52:56] since this age perhaps
[1:52:58] because Moses when he spoke
[1:53:01] animals came into existence. Animals
[1:53:04] went out of existence. Nature obeyed
[1:53:07] him. He could curse a people and it
[1:53:09] would happen. He could lift the curse
[1:53:10] and it would go away.
[1:53:12] Whatever Moses said or told to happen,
[1:53:16] it happened. He was a God man in so many
[1:53:20] ways. God said, "Moses, you're going to
[1:53:23] be God to the people." And we see that
[1:53:25] whatever he did, God backed it up. Now,
[1:53:28] we know that that's because he was doing
[1:53:30] what God told him to do. But it was
[1:53:31] working through a man. That's what I
[1:53:33] want us to see. But when we look at what
[1:53:35] it took to get to that point,
[1:53:37] that's really what we need to learn and
[1:53:39] understand this morning. Now, this is
[1:53:41] Moses. Moses, this is brother talking
[1:53:43] about Moses out on the desert. And he
[1:53:45] says, Moses was out there getting
[1:53:48] stripped,
[1:53:49] getting tired of working and getting no
[1:53:51] results, getting tired of trying and not
[1:53:54] getting the benefit that he thought it
[1:53:56] should bring. He says Moses was out
[1:53:57] there getting stripped until he had an
[1:53:59] experience at the burning bush that
[1:54:01] declared the word. Moses got stripped
[1:54:03] until he had no ambition to do what God
[1:54:05] really wanted him to do.
[1:54:07] He said, 'I am the God of Abraham,
[1:54:09] Isaac, and Jacob, and I remember my
[1:54:11] promise. I've come down to deliver them,
[1:54:13] and I'm sending you to do it. That was
[1:54:15] it. He says he saw the word, not the
[1:54:19] ambition of the people or the desires of
[1:54:22] the people.
[1:54:24] Now, we should never be pressuring
[1:54:26] somebody to do or be something in the
[1:54:28] kingdom of God. And we see the potential
[1:54:30] there. We don't know exactly what
[1:54:32] happened with Moses, but we know that he
[1:54:34] thought he was a deliverer. He knew he
[1:54:36] was a deliverer from early on. And I
[1:54:37] don't believe that was from God. I
[1:54:39] believe that his family was telling him.
[1:54:41] His mom and his dad said, "Hey, Moses,
[1:54:42] you're the deliverer. God's preserved
[1:54:44] you. Look at the miracles in your life.
[1:54:45] You got a very special work to do.
[1:54:47] You're going to deliver the people of
[1:54:48] Israel." And what happened is that got
[1:54:51] to him and eventually he tried to do it
[1:54:52] himself.
[1:54:55] And when you push yourself into a role
[1:54:57] like that, bad things happen.
[1:55:00] We see good people. We may even feel we
[1:55:02] see gifts and callings, but remember a
[1:55:07] calling comes from God, not from the
[1:55:09] congregation.
[1:55:11] We have good men that know the word, but
[1:55:14] that doesn't make them a preacher.
[1:55:18] We have good men that know the word,
[1:55:21] that doesn't make them a deacon.
[1:55:24] We have men that can handle money, but
[1:55:26] that doesn't make him a treasurer.
[1:55:30] It takes God to push us and place us and
[1:55:33] mold us and prepare us for those roles.
[1:55:37] And one thing about ministry is that if
[1:55:39] it's a calling, ministry, you can't you
[1:55:42] can't say, "I'll give it a try." That's
[1:55:44] not a call from God. If it's an attempt,
[1:55:47] it's not of God. Ministry is a calling
[1:55:50] and whether it goes good or whether it
[1:55:52] goes bad, you'll keep doing it. And the
[1:55:55] thing is, you'll keep doing it and
[1:55:56] you'll get results
[1:55:59] because that's what a call of God does.
[1:56:00] It produces results if you're yielded to
[1:56:02] him. It may not look good. It may not
[1:56:05] sound good, but it'll produce godly
[1:56:07] results. Can I give you an example?
[1:56:10] Brother Random. That man was not the
[1:56:13] world's greatest preacher. He's great to
[1:56:16] us because there's something in us that
[1:56:17] connects with his message, but he can't
[1:56:19] speak well.
[1:56:21] He doesn't have a a dynamic delivery.
[1:56:24] Most of the time his grammar is
[1:56:26] horrible. He's uneducated. He misques
[1:56:29] scripture. He misreads scripture.
[1:56:32] Carnally speaking, he was not a good
[1:56:34] preacher. But I'll tell you one thing,
[1:56:36] he got results. He got results. He
[1:56:40] called a bride out. I mean, it's God and
[1:56:43] simplicity all over again. But if you're
[1:56:46] looking to be something great, that's
[1:56:48] when you fail. That's not what it's
[1:56:50] about. But if there's a call in your
[1:56:52] life to do something and it is of God,
[1:56:54] you will have no rest until you yield to
[1:56:56] that call. And when you yield to that
[1:56:59] call and you yield to the one who gave
[1:57:00] you the call, it'll produce the same
[1:57:03] results every single time. It'll produce
[1:57:05] the word alive.
[1:57:07] That's the way it always goes.
[1:57:11] He says he saw the word, not the
[1:57:13] ambition of the people or the desires of
[1:57:15] God or the desires of the people. He
[1:57:18] says then what did he become? He didn't
[1:57:20] want to face the Egyptians anymore. He
[1:57:22] didn't want to face this thing anymore.
[1:57:24] But he became a prisoner. He said 40
[1:57:27] years of running, stripping down, but
[1:57:29] then he became a prisoner at the burning
[1:57:31] bush. The mighty Moses with all of his
[1:57:33] intellect. The Bible says that Moses was
[1:57:36] a mighty man in word and indeed down in
[1:57:38] Egypt. But watch what the mighty
[1:57:40] theologian did in the presence of the
[1:57:42] burning bush. He says he only confessed
[1:57:45] his inability when he saw the genuine
[1:57:49] purpose of God. He confessed that he was
[1:57:51] unable to do it. Not only unable, didn't
[1:57:55] want to
[1:57:57] personal ambition to be a deliverer. Now
[1:58:00] that it's time for him to be a
[1:58:01] deliverer, he's lost all personal
[1:58:04] ambition.
[1:58:05] He says, "Yet he was trained in all the
[1:58:07] theology that they could give him,
[1:58:09] trained in the best school, but yet what
[1:58:11] could he do when that pillar of fire was
[1:58:13] hanging there in the bush, said, 'I
[1:58:14] can't even talk. Uhuh. Lord, who am I
[1:58:16] that I should go?" When the magnitude of
[1:58:19] the calling stood before him,
[1:58:22] he said, "This ain't going to work out
[1:58:24] well.
[1:58:25] I've tried this before. Didn't work."
[1:58:28] Yeah, but last time you were in your
[1:58:29] will. Now you're in my will. That's the
[1:58:31] difference.
[1:58:33] He says, "Get your shoes off, Moses. I
[1:58:35] want to talk to you. Strip yourself
[1:58:37] down. Even your shoes. You're flat on
[1:58:39] the ground again." He says, "I want to
[1:58:40] talk to you." He couldn't even talk.
[1:58:42] Finally, an elected prisoner, an elected
[1:58:45] prophet, just like Paul was elected.
[1:58:47] Moses was elected to be a deliverer. But
[1:58:50] then God, finally, God has his elected
[1:58:53] subject, a prisoner to him. He says,
[1:58:56] "Oh, hallelujah. He could only move as
[1:58:59] the word of God moved him. Who shall I
[1:59:02] say sent me? I am. How will I do it?
[1:59:05] I'll be with you. Yes, Lord. Just as you
[1:59:07] say, here I am. He's a prisoner. He says
[1:59:09] he goes against his better thinking.
[1:59:11] Now, he had been trained to command an
[1:59:13] army. He gives these commands with all
[1:59:14] these things. He says that's how he
[1:59:16] would be going to take it over. That was
[1:59:17] his training. But he said, "What am I
[1:59:19] going to use?" And God said, "What do
[1:59:21] you have in your hand?" And he said, "I
[1:59:23] have a stick."
[1:59:27] Talk about inability, Lord. I can't do
[1:59:30] it. How am I going to do it? You're
[1:59:32] going to use your stick,
[1:59:35] Lord. Now, I definitely can't do it.
[1:59:38] Maybe I could raise up, you know, an
[1:59:39] insurrection and take some men out and
[1:59:42] we we'll get the slaves out in the
[1:59:43] desert. We'll get a couple thousand out
[1:59:44] there. We'll we'll we'll ambush a couple
[1:59:46] people. We'll take their weapons. We'll
[1:59:48] slowly build an army and then we'll go
[1:59:49] in and we'll slowly just just by by
[1:59:51] paper cut after paper cut get them out
[1:59:54] of Egypt. Just harass Pharaoh until he's
[1:59:56] had enough.
[1:59:58] That might be the way he ought to have
[1:59:59] after it. Lord, how am I going to do it?
[2:00:02] With a stick. Oh boy.
[2:00:05] He says, "God does things so ridiculous
[2:00:07] sometimes to the human mind. Got a stick
[2:00:11] in his hand, whiskers hanging down, 80
[2:00:13] years old, his wife on a mule, kid
[2:00:14] sitting on her hip, little old flabby
[2:00:17] arms hanging down, and a stick. Just his
[2:00:20] head stood up. For he had thus sayeth
[2:00:21] the Lord. Why? He had finally got
[2:00:24] anchored. He was a prisoner.
[2:00:28] See, no matter how ridiculous it was, he
[2:00:30] knew who he had met. And he knew this
[2:00:32] was not a figment of his imagination. It
[2:00:35] wasn't a calling of his mind. It wasn't
[2:00:37] a placing of his desire, but it was
[2:00:39] almighty God stepping down and saying,
[2:00:41] "You're built for this, and I'm going to
[2:00:43] be with you, and I'm going to work
[2:00:45] through you, and we're going to get this
[2:00:46] done." He says, "I'll only move when the
[2:00:48] word moves me. I'll only speak where the
[2:00:51] word speaks. Where you going, Moses? I
[2:00:53] have one commission. Stand before
[2:00:55] Pharaoh and show him by the stick that
[2:00:58] God sent me. Amen. He says, "What are
[2:01:00] you going to do after that?" He'll
[2:01:02] provide the next thing after I do this.
[2:01:05] It's just one step at a time. That's the
[2:01:06] walk of faith. One step at a time, one
[2:01:09] day at a time. It's all he's ever told
[2:01:11] us he'll do.
[2:01:13] He says, "There you are." He's speaking
[2:01:15] to us now. You only have one thing to
[2:01:18] do. The first step tonight, surrender.
[2:01:22] We're preaching on absolute power.
[2:01:24] What's the key? Surrender. Become a
[2:01:26] prisoner. Don't think of yourself or
[2:01:29] something else. Become a prisoner. See,
[2:01:32] sometimes we're thinking, "Okay, God's
[2:01:34] got to change me." So that.
[2:01:38] Can I give you some advice this morning?
[2:01:40] Drop the so that. And just say, "God's
[2:01:42] got to change me." And if you take the
[2:01:45] God's got to change me, the so that will
[2:01:47] take care of itself because that may be
[2:01:49] you and that may be God, but you're
[2:01:51] there to say God's changing me. I
[2:01:53] surrender. That's all he's asking you to
[2:01:55] do. Moses, he said, became a prisoner.
[2:01:58] Confessed he couldn't even talk.
[2:01:59] Finally, when God got him in his hand
[2:02:01] where he could only move where God moved
[2:02:03] him where he told him the word, he knew
[2:02:05] it was the word. Then he submitted
[2:02:07] himself to the word and the Holy Spirit
[2:02:09] did there. God harnessed Moses to the
[2:02:14] will of God.
[2:02:16] What's he saying?
[2:02:19] Don't come in and say, "Lord, I need you
[2:02:22] to do this. I need you to do that. Lord,
[2:02:25] I got an idea here. Lord, I could really
[2:02:27] use this." Moses, when he came in, he
[2:02:30] was silent. He didn't come in and say,
[2:02:33] "Lord,
[2:02:34] we got a real need down there in Egypt.
[2:02:38] How about you use me?" No,
[2:02:42] he was silent. He let God do the talking
[2:02:45] and he surrendered himself. Amen. God's
[2:02:49] just asking us to say, "Lord, I'm here
[2:02:51] to listen and obey." God doesn't need
[2:02:53] our opinions. God doesn't need our
[2:02:56] ideas. God doesn't even need our
[2:02:58] practical experience.
[2:03:01] What he needs is a prisoner. Somebody
[2:03:04] that will listen. Somebody that will
[2:03:06] stay quiet. and then somebody that'll do
[2:03:08] exactly what they're told to do. Amen.
[2:03:11] If you want to say something to God,
[2:03:13] repeat his word back to him. Rightly
[2:03:16] divided, repeat his word back to him.
[2:03:18] That's the only thing God wants to hear
[2:03:19] out of our mouth when it comes to
[2:03:21] orders, directions, plans, ideas, these
[2:03:23] sorts of things. He wants us yielded to
[2:03:26] him. You know, can I can I tell you
[2:03:28] something funny about myself as we
[2:03:30] close? Let's stand together. The
[2:03:31] musicians can stand. We're closing. I've
[2:03:34] had a few situations going on in within
[2:03:37] the church in the last let's call it a
[2:03:40] year and I saw things and I saw little
[2:03:43] things
[2:03:45] you know and the way we sometimes get
[2:03:46] and I said ah I see what's going on
[2:03:48] there I see that that person's dealing
[2:03:49] with this and that that d and I and I
[2:03:52] had this whole thing mapped out and this
[2:03:53] was on maybe three three different
[2:03:55] occasions
[2:03:56] and you know what I held that in my
[2:03:59] heart and when it finally came out what
[2:04:02] was really going on. I was completely
[2:04:04] wrong.
[2:04:08] What was that snicker for, Paul?
[2:04:11] He does the same thing. Okay, you may be
[2:04:14] a minister.
[2:04:18] Okay,
[2:04:19] completely wrong. And I was so glad I
[2:04:21] hadn't even mentioned it to my wife
[2:04:24] because that would have proved me the
[2:04:26] fool. But then there were other things.
[2:04:29] Then I saw little things happening and I
[2:04:31] said, "Ah, I see what's going on there."
[2:04:34] And you know what? I was absolutely 100%
[2:04:37] right.
[2:04:40] Are you like that, too? No. Maybe you're
[2:04:42] not a minister.
[2:04:44] But you know what that proved to me,
[2:04:46] church?
[2:04:48] Here's the punch line. I am
[2:04:51] inconsistent.
[2:04:54] That when I think I have discernment,
[2:04:57] sometimes I do. And sometimes I don't.
[2:05:03] God knows how to keep us humble.
[2:05:05] God knows how to teach us to zip this
[2:05:08] and express it to him and say, "Lord,
[2:05:11] I'm seeing things. Lord, is there
[2:05:14] something going on that I need to help
[2:05:16] with, deal with, or just leave it
[2:05:19] alone?"
[2:05:20] But the greatest thing that I got out of
[2:05:22] that was
[2:05:24] I am inconsistent.
[2:05:28] Discernment is meant first of all
[2:05:30] internally.
[2:05:32] I have met people that have a quote gift
[2:05:34] of discernment and it is always
[2:05:36] outwardly facing with no humility.
[2:05:40] It's got to be an inward- facing thing.
[2:05:43] And what that's teaching me to do
[2:05:45] because I am still a work in progress.
[2:05:47] What that's teaching me to do is take
[2:05:50] all thoughts subject to Christ. all
[2:05:53] opinions, all perceptions, all
[2:05:56] discernment.
[2:05:58] Because you think I'm growing as a
[2:05:59] minister. I trust I'm growing as a
[2:06:00] minister. But that doesn't mean I'm
[2:06:03] fully grown. That doesn't mean I'm
[2:06:05] perfect. That doesn't mean I have all
[2:06:06] discernment. It doesn't mean my gut
[2:06:08] feel, my intuition is always right. It's
[2:06:11] got to be subject to the spirit of God
[2:06:13] by the word of God. Amen. And so that
[2:06:17] goes for every aspect of our life.
[2:06:19] Sometimes the areas we need to lay down
[2:06:21] most are those that we hold most
[2:06:22] spiritual
[2:06:24] because we can elevate it because we're
[2:06:26] grown, because we're mature, because
[2:06:28] we're children of God. And sometimes we
[2:06:30] built it up into something that isn't
[2:06:31] God at all.
[2:06:33] Tell you what, if you think you got
[2:06:34] something very spiritual, test it and
[2:06:37] honestly test it and check the results.
[2:06:40] And if it's not of God, you know that
[2:06:41] you got an issue somewhere in those
[2:06:43] things.
[2:06:45] But we see time and time again in these
[2:06:47] examples today in Paul and in Moses,
[2:06:49] before you can do anything for God,
[2:06:51] God's got to do something with you. And
[2:06:54] that comes with that absolute inability
[2:06:56] that Moses had to do what God was
[2:06:59] telling them to do. And that's when God
[2:07:01] can finally do something for us. And
[2:07:03] that's where we'll pick up on service on
[2:07:05] Wednesday night, Lord willing. Amen. God
[2:07:07] bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:07:09] Father,
[2:07:12] Lord, this is a life of surrender.
[2:07:14] It's a life of yielding. It's a life of
[2:07:16] laying down, Lord. It's a life of dying
[2:07:19] out daily,
[2:07:21] Lord. And these are hard things to
[2:07:22] preach because it doesn't really bolster
[2:07:25] us or encourage us maybe in the way that
[2:07:27] we would like, Lord. But it's a reminder
[2:07:30] that we can do all things through
[2:07:32] Christ, not ourselves, Lord. That you're
[2:07:34] the key. You're the key stone. You're
[2:07:36] the lynch pin, Lord. You're the the
[2:07:38] foundation for all these things. You are
[2:07:40] the essential part of all of this is
[2:07:42] Christ in us, Lord. And that means we've
[2:07:45] got to die out and we've got to pour out
[2:07:46] and we've got to lay down, Lord. We've
[2:07:49] got to be broken and rebuilt,
[2:07:51] Lord. And sometimes it's just parts of
[2:07:53] our life need that. But Lord, we've got
[2:07:55] to be willing to lay it down. We've got
[2:07:57] to be willing to hold all things
[2:07:58] loosely, heavenly father. And Lord, you
[2:08:01] know the hearts of the people. You know
[2:08:02] where we're at. You know where we're at
[2:08:04] in our jobs and our careers and our
[2:08:05] finances, our health, Lord. our
[2:08:08] relationships, our offices in the
[2:08:09] church, Lord, whatever it might be,
[2:08:12] Lord. You know where we've lifted
[2:08:13] ourselves up. You know where we need to
[2:08:16] lay ourselves down,
[2:08:18] Lord. But I pray your spirit could pour
[2:08:20] into those cracks and crevices and those
[2:08:22] hard places,
[2:08:25] Lord. Those places where we've let pride
[2:08:26] or arrogance come in,
[2:08:29] Lord, where we talk
[2:08:32] a little higher than we walk.
[2:08:34] Lord, we praise a little higher than we
[2:08:36] live.
[2:08:38] Lord, I pray you forgive us. I pray you
[2:08:40] forgive me,
[2:08:42] Lord, where we just
[2:08:46] Lord, we think too much
[2:08:48] of ourselves, of what we have.
[2:08:52] Lord, I pray you just help us to stay
[2:08:54] humble.
[2:08:56] Lord, I pray you help us to repent.
[2:08:59] Lord, I pray you help us to keep our
[2:09:01] mouth shut,
[2:09:03] Lord, to take all things to you first.
[2:09:07] Lord, that we could lay our opinions
[2:09:08] down, our experience down, our desires
[2:09:10] down, our plans down.
[2:09:13] Lord, let us look at ourselves only and
[2:09:16] let your word and your spirit do the
[2:09:17] work to wash us and cleanse us and build
[2:09:20] us up, Lord, to renew us in Christ each
[2:09:23] one. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:09:26] ask it. Amen.
[2:09:33] I found it all. 1182
[2:09:39] And I found it all
[2:09:44] when I lost everything
[2:09:48] and gave my life
[2:09:52] to serve a risen
[2:09:55] king. I found the truth
[2:10:00] that I've been searching
[2:10:03] for. I found it all
[2:10:08] when I found the Lord.
[2:10:12] I found it all
[2:10:16] when I lost everything
[2:10:20] and gave my life
[2:10:24] to serve a risen
[2:10:28] king. I found the truth
[2:10:32] that I've been searching
[2:10:36] for. I found it all.
[2:10:41] When I found the Lord,
[2:10:45] I found it all.
[2:10:49] when I lost
[2:10:52] everything and gave my life
[2:10:57] to serve a ris
[2:11:00] king. I found the truth
[2:11:05] that I' been searching
[2:11:08] for. I found it all.
[2:11:13] When I found the Lord,
[2:11:18] power of your love. 797.
[2:11:25] Lord, I come to you.
[2:11:29] Let my heart be changed,
[2:11:34] renewed.
[2:11:36] Oh, flowing from the grace
[2:11:40] that I've done.
[2:11:45] in you.
[2:11:53] And Lord, I come to know
[2:11:58] the weaknesses I see
[2:12:03] in me
[2:12:06] will be stripped away.
[2:12:12] by the power of your love.
[2:12:18] So hold
[2:12:21] me close
[2:12:23] and let your love surround
[2:12:29] me.
[2:12:33] Bring
[2:12:35] me near
[2:12:38] and draw me to your side.
[2:12:46] And as
[2:12:50] I wait,
[2:12:52] I'll rise up like the
[2:12:58] eagle
[2:12:59] and I will soar with you.
[2:13:03] Your spirit leads me on
[2:13:06] by the power of your love.
[2:13:13] And Lord, unveil my eyes.
[2:13:18] Let me see you face
[2:13:22] to face
[2:13:24] with the knowledge of your love.
[2:13:29] As you
[2:13:33] in me.
[2:13:42] Lord, renew my mind
[2:13:46] as your will unfold
[2:13:50] in thy life
[2:13:53] in living every day.
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:14:00] by the power of your love.
[2:14:05] So hold
[2:14:08] me close.
[2:14:11] Let your love surround
[2:14:16] me.
[2:14:20] Bring
[2:14:22] me near
[2:14:25] and draw me to your side.
[2:14:29] I
[2:14:32] do. And as

[2:14:46] and I will soar with you.
[2:14:49] Your spirit leads me all by the power of
[2:14:54] your love.
[2:14:59] And Lord, unveil my eyes.
[2:15:04] Let me see you face
[2:15:08] to face
[2:15:10] with the knowledge of your love.
[2:15:15] that you
[2:15:19] give me.
[2:15:27] Glory to my mind
[2:15:32] as your will accord
[2:15:35] in my life
[2:15:38] in living every day.
[2:15:45] in the power of your love.
[2:15:50] Oh,
[2:15:53] be close.
[2:16:07] me near
[2:16:09] and draw me to your side.
[2:16:18] And as
[2:16:21] I wait,
[2:16:23] I'll rise up like evil
[2:16:26] [Music]
[2:16:30] and I will soar with you. Your spirit
[2:16:35] leads me on in the power of your love.
[2:16:42] So hold
[2:16:45] me close
[2:16:47] and let your love surround
[2:16:53] me.
[2:16:55] Oh, bring
[2:16:59] me near
[2:17:01] and draw me to your side.
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:09] And as
[2:17:12] I wake,
[2:17:14] I rise up like the
[2:17:20] eagle
[2:17:21] and I will soar with you.
[2:17:25] Your spirit leads me on by the power of
[2:17:29] your love. And as I wait,
[2:17:33] oh, and as
[2:17:36] I wait,
[2:17:38] I'll rise up like the eagle
[2:17:45] and I will soar with you. Your spirit
[2:17:49] leads me on in the power of your love.

[2:22:19] Amen. We're going to sing that song, He
[2:22:21] is able, more than able, 7:21 before we
[2:22:24] close. Amen. I'm going to ask Brother
[2:22:28] Bob to come and close in prayer after we
[2:22:30] sing this. Amen. Remember Sister Nikki,
[2:22:32] especially Brother Grant. They've had a
[2:22:34] rough couple of days, of course, with
[2:22:35] the move and these things. Wanted to
[2:22:37] thank the church for all those that have
[2:22:38] helped, the sisters that went over and
[2:22:40] helped to clean. And I think brother
[2:22:42] David's been over there daily for
[2:22:43] painting and different ones, helping to
[2:22:45] prep the house. Brother Matt's over
[2:22:47] there redoing all the electrical and
[2:22:48] plumbing, I think, for the whole
[2:22:49] building. So then those that went to
[2:22:51] help move, God bless you for that. This
[2:22:53] is part of being a body. Amen. Is to put
[2:22:56] your shoulder to the literal wheel and
[2:22:58] go and help them out in their time of
[2:22:59] need. So God bless you for that. Just
[2:23:01] pray God's grace to be with them. It's
[2:23:02] certainly uh it can be very stressful,
[2:23:05] especially with work and these things,
[2:23:06] sickness interfering. So we pray God's
[2:23:09] grace to be with them. and brother Chad
[2:23:10] and family will come back this week. I
[2:23:12] think maybe Thursday, but remember them
[2:23:14] in prayer as well. And uh we've got more
[2:23:17] company coming in. We've got company
[2:23:18] going out before they come back again.
[2:23:20] So praying traveling mercies for them.
[2:23:22] My family and I have been really
[2:23:23] suffering with allergies as well. Amen.
[2:23:26] We're trusting the Lord to just give us
[2:23:27] a respit from that as well. Amen. Let's
[2:23:30] sing this as brother Bob will come.

[2:23:37] more

[2:23:46] me today.
[2:23:50] He is aable
[2:23:53] more than aable.
[2:23:58] He can handle anything that comes my
[2:24:03] way.
[2:24:06] He is aable,
[2:24:09] more than able
[2:24:14] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[2:24:22] He is aable,
[2:24:25] more than a
[2:24:30] to make me what he wants me to be.
[2:24:37] He is aable,
[2:24:40] more than able
[2:24:45] to accomplish what concerns me today.
[2:24:53] He is aable,
[2:24:56] more than a.
[2:25:01] He can handle anything that comes my
[2:25:06] way.
[2:25:08] He is aable,
[2:25:11] more than able
[2:25:16] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[2:25:23] He is able,
[2:25:26] more than able
[2:25:32] to make me what he wants me to be.
[2:25:41] Amen. Heavenly Father,
[2:25:43] we thank you, Lord, for your word today,
[2:25:45] Lord. But Father, we know, Lord, that it
[2:25:49] shows us that we're so weak, Lord, in
[2:25:51] ourselves,
[2:25:52] that all the plans that we make
[2:25:54] ourselves, Lord, many times without even
[2:25:57] talking to you about it, Father, it just
[2:25:59] all falls flat.
[2:26:01] And Lord, sometimes I wondered why you
[2:26:04] would just choose me or choose many of
[2:26:07] us, Father, even before the foundation
[2:26:10] of the world to put that seed in our
[2:26:12] hearts to respond to your word, Lord,
[2:26:14] and to know that we have that wonderful
[2:26:16] hope of resurrection and rapture, Lord,
[2:26:19] not because we did anything to deserve
[2:26:21] it, Lord. We know our flame, our frame
[2:26:23] is just but flesh, Lord, or just but
[2:26:28] but clay. And father,
[2:26:31] we just pray Lord that you would help
[2:26:32] us, Father, by grace to let you increase
[2:26:34] in our lives. And that we would be
[2:26:36] willing, Father, to surrender, willing,
[2:26:39] Lord, to let you, Father, make us
[2:26:41] decrease. Because, Father, we can't do
[2:26:43] it ourselves. We tried it many times and
[2:26:46] it never works, Lord, as the brother
[2:26:47] said. But, Father, we're just praying,
[2:26:50] Lord, that you would help us, Father, by
[2:26:52] grace to totally surrender, to totally
[2:26:54] yield, Lord, to your leadership. Father,
[2:26:57] we're in a time, Lord, where the world
[2:26:58] is falling apart, Lord. Sin is just
[2:27:01] mounting and mounting, Lord. And Father,
[2:27:03] we know this this is not the place for
[2:27:05] us to be. But, Father, we know that
[2:27:07] there's a greater place for us to be,
[2:27:09] Lord. And so, we're praying, Father,
[2:27:11] that by grace, you would help us, Lord,
[2:27:13] to totally dedicate ourselves to you,
[2:27:15] Lord. Father, as the song says, Lord, we
[2:27:18] want to give ourselves away and let you
[2:27:21] have the preeminence in our lives, body,
[2:27:23] soul, and spirit that you would, Father,
[2:27:26] by grace, Lord, write your word upon the
[2:27:28] fleshly tables of our hearts. That be no
[2:27:31] hardness, Father, but Lord, or no
[2:27:34] criticism or no weaknesses, Lord, but
[2:27:36] just, Father, letting you, Lord, just
[2:27:39] reflect yourself in our lives. So be
[2:27:42] with us, we pray, Father, as we go from
[2:27:43] here today. Bless us, Father, from the
[2:27:46] pulpit to the door, Lord, that you would
[2:27:48] just go with us to our homes, Lord, and
[2:27:51] whatever duties we have to undertake. We
[2:27:53] just pray, Father, that you would just
[2:27:55] be glorified in it all. We bless, Lord,
[2:27:58] Sister Nikki, today, Father, that you
[2:28:00] would just be with her, Lord, and lift
[2:28:01] her up. Father, we know there's a
[2:28:03] promise that by your stripes, she was
[2:28:05] healed. Yes, Lord. And Father, we do
[2:28:07] know, Lord, that there's nothing too
[2:28:09] hard for you. So, be with her. We pray,
[2:28:11] Lord, and Brother Garfield as well. and
[2:28:12] all those Lord, Brother Chad and the
[2:28:14] family, all those Lord that are not here
[2:28:16] today. May your hand be upon each and
[2:28:19] every one of us, Father, as we commit
[2:28:21] ourselves into your hands this day in
[2:28:23] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:28:26] Amen.
