[42:56] Amen. Let's sing 1251.
[43:01] I know I am the bride. Amen. Believe
[43:04] that this morning. I know I am the bride
[43:07] you're returning for.
[43:11] I know I am the bride that you are
[43:16] returning for.
[43:20] Dressed in garments wide and wrinkle
[43:25] free.
[43:28] Though I have no earthly love that I am
[43:33] holding
[43:35] to
[43:36] for your one means everything to me.
[43:44] I will sing.
[43:48] I will worship you.
[43:52] I will bow myself down humbly at your
[43:57] throne.
[44:00] I will give anything.
[44:03] I will give everything
[44:07] to you alone. I stand.
[44:12] You are the faithful God who keeps your
[44:16] covenant.
[44:19] There's not one thing you said you have
[44:23] not done. Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[44:28] someday when I see you standing face
[44:33] to face,
[44:35] my praise for you will only have
[44:40] hallelujah.
[44:42] I will sing.
[44:46] I will worship you.
[44:50] I will bow myself down humbly at your
[44:55] hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus.
[44:59] Hallelujah.
[45:01] I will give everything
[45:04] to you alone. You are the faithful God.
[45:09] You are the faithful God who keeps. God
[45:14] bless you. Amen. Thank you.
[45:25] And someday when I see you standing face
[45:30] to face,
[45:32] my praise for you will only have begun.
[45:39] I will sing.
[45:43] I will worship you.
[45:47] I will bow myself down humbly at your
[45:52] throne.
[45:54] I will give anything.
[45:58] I will give everything
[46:01] to you, alone.
[46:06] And I will sing.
[46:10] I will worship you.
[46:13] I will bow myself down humbly at your
[46:19] throne.
[46:21] I will give anything.
[46:25] I will give everything
[46:28] to you alone.
[46:31] [Music]
[46:33] Amen. Heavenly Father,
[46:36] Lord, I'm trusting that's a true
[46:39] confession for each one of us this
[46:40] morning, Lord God.
[46:43] Lord, that we will humbly bow ourselves
[46:44] before you.
[46:47] Lord, a prophet told us that humility is
[46:49] power with God.
[46:51] And Lord, as we're speaking on your
[46:53] power this morning, Lord, may we
[46:54] recognize this morning, Lord, that we've
[46:57] got to be humble before you, Lord. But
[46:59] we've got to lay everything else aside,
[47:01] Lord. And just lay ourselves before you
[47:03] that you could do with us what you will,
[47:06] Lord. That it's your power, not our
[47:07] power. It's your word, not our word.
[47:10] Lord, it starts with you, it finishes
[47:12] with you. You're the yay and amen. You
[47:14] are the author and the finisher of our
[47:16] faith, Lord God. So, Lord, we're
[47:18] thankful this morning. Lord, we're
[47:20] humbled to be here this morning as your
[47:22] children to worship and praise you for
[47:24] all that you've done for us. Lord, we're
[47:26] holding you to your promise now.
[47:30] speak to your people.
[47:32] Draw us closer to you. Strengthen us.
[47:36] Give us courage, Lord Jesus.
[47:38] Heal our bodies, our minds, our hearts.
[47:43] Lord, change us to be more like you this
[47:45] morning. We pray
[47:48] Jesus Christ's name we're asking it.
[47:50] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[47:52] would this morning to Luke chapter 24.
[47:56] Luke 24. Sure enjoyed that song service.
[47:59] Amen. Wonderful to come in and hear the
[48:01] worship of the people of God. Amen.
[48:04] Certainly want to welcome our visitors.
[48:05] We've got Sister Darlene Guy with us
[48:07] here this morning. God bless you, Sister
[48:08] Darlene. Always happy to have you with
[48:10] us. Then we have our precious friends,
[48:13] Brother Bob and Sister Joe Hansen from
[48:15] British Columbia. And they're very dear
[48:17] to us, very good friends of us. When we
[48:20] moved to British Columbia, they invited
[48:22] us into our house having done neither
[48:24] good nor evil. without knowing us,
[48:26] having never met us and we stayed with
[48:28] them for two weeks before we moved in
[48:29] and then the last couple days before we
[48:31] moved back to Newfoundland, we stayed
[48:33] with them as well. So certainly
[48:35] appreciate them. They're going to be
[48:36] with us for a little over three weeks.
[48:37] Um they'll be away for a little bit, but
[48:39] um certainly wonderful to have them with
[48:41] us and trusting that we'll be blessed
[48:44] and they'll be blessed. Amen. A mutually
[48:46] beneficial trip for all of us. Amen. God
[48:49] bless you. Familiar scripture. We read
[48:51] this a couple services ago and now we're
[48:52] really getting back to the meat of it.
[48:54] says, "And behold," Jesus speaking out
[48:56] of the disciples, "I send the promise of
[48:58] my father upon you, but tear ye in the
[49:01] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[49:04] with power from on high." Amen. God
[49:06] bless you. You can have your seats this
[49:08] morning. May God bless the reading of
[49:09] his word. And we've been preaching our
[49:11] series on the token life, on the life of
[49:13] a Holy Ghostfilled believer. And we're
[49:14] taking another thought on absolute
[49:16] power. Amen. And I want to pick up kind
[49:18] of where we finished the last service on
[49:20] this topic or the first service on this
[49:22] topic where Jesus gave this commission
[49:24] to the disciples, but he told them they
[49:26] had to wait before they could fulfill
[49:27] their commission. And we've preached now
[49:29] a couple services on what it means to
[49:31] receive your commission. And we talked
[49:33] about Jo about Moses and Joshua and
[49:35] Caleb and there and David. And the
[49:38] purpose was to show that when God gives
[49:39] a message to a people, that message
[49:42] itself is a commission. Amen. It is
[49:44] something that that shows there's a work
[49:46] to be done. who's to do it, what the
[49:48] benefits are. Amen. And that message is
[49:49] meant for somebody. God doesn't send a
[49:52] message because there's nobody there to
[49:54] receive it. God sends a message and it's
[49:56] for you if you'll receive it. If you
[49:59] won't receive it, it's not for you. It
[50:02] could have been for you, but it's not
[50:03] for you. But the message is given for
[50:05] those that will receive it. And it's
[50:06] meant to bring them to a better place.
[50:08] Amen. It does four things. It identifies
[50:10] who you are. If you hear it, you're a
[50:12] child of God. That's the way it's
[50:14] worked. You see this all the way through
[50:16] scripture. Those that will hear and
[50:18] receive the word of God, they are the
[50:20] children of God. It's a very simple
[50:21] metric. Amen. Children of God will
[50:23] listen, they will receive, and they will
[50:25] act on the word of God. And children
[50:27] that are not of God can't hear it. They
[50:28] can't receive it. They can't even
[50:30] understand it, much less go all the way
[50:32] with it. Amen. So, it identifies who you
[50:35] are. It also identifies your time and
[50:37] your season. Amen. It tells you what the
[50:39] conditions are around you. It tells you
[50:42] what your condition is. That's what we
[50:44] need so many times. I don't need to know
[50:45] what their condition is. I need to know
[50:47] what my condition is relative to what
[50:49] God wants for me. Amen. So, it shows you
[50:51] what your condition is. Amen. And then
[50:53] it tells you what to do. Remember, a
[50:56] commission is power with full or sorry,
[50:59] it's permission with full power. So,
[51:01] permission to do something with all the
[51:03] power of an entity behind it. Amen. So
[51:05] when we receive a message, we receive a
[51:08] commission, then God puts all of power
[51:11] of heaven behind you to help you do
[51:14] exactly what he wants you to do. What's
[51:16] he doing, church? He's taking the
[51:18] pressure off of us. He's saying, "All
[51:20] you have to do is obey. All you have to
[51:21] do is act, and I'll put everything I
[51:23] have behind you if you'll just receive
[51:26] what I have for you." And then it tells
[51:28] you what the benefit is. And we know
[51:30] that uh as much as we might not want to
[51:32] admit it today, we are driven by
[51:35] benefit. We do things because it's good
[51:37] for us. We do it because there's
[51:39] something in it for us. And God is in it
[51:40] for us. All things work together for our
[51:43] good. So he shows us the good that's
[51:45] behind it. Sometimes the good means we
[51:47] escape judgment.
[51:49] Sometimes the good is that we are
[51:50] corrected to escape judgment. Amen.
[51:52] Sometimes it's to take us out of
[51:54] unnecessary pain and suffering.
[51:56] Sometimes it's to get us to turn a
[51:57] corner. I don't know about you, I'm a
[51:59] groove person. I like to keep going the
[52:01] same way indefinitely.
[52:03] But I've got to learn to turn corners.
[52:05] And that's why God has to speak to me in
[52:07] certain ways to get me to turn a corner
[52:09] cuz I get comfortable. Sometimes we get
[52:11] comfortable. It's not wrong, but it's
[52:13] not where he wants us to go
[52:14] indefinitely. So, he has to get us to
[52:16] turn a corner. Sometimes he's got to
[52:17] turn us around. And the benefit is
[52:20] you'll come back to me where you left
[52:21] me. It's a message given to restore us
[52:24] back to our condition, but it's always
[52:26] meant to benefit us. I meant you look at
[52:28] Noah. God gave Noah a message. And he
[52:31] gave it to the not just to Noah but to
[52:33] the people of his time. And his message
[52:34] to the people was you've become so evil
[52:37] that God is going to destroy you. Repent
[52:40] and get in the ark. That was the
[52:42] message. It showed them their condition.
[52:44] It showed them their season. It showed
[52:45] them a way out. It showed them a work to
[52:47] do. And it showed them a benefit to
[52:48] their life. Amen. And then you take that
[52:52] message and you give it to the people.
[52:54] And what happens? nothing so many times.
[52:57] Don't judge your commission by the
[52:59] results.
[53:00] Judge it by obedience to the word
[53:02] because it's going to be few there be
[53:04] that find the way that's straight and
[53:06] narrow. Amen. It gives us a commission
[53:08] if you receive the message you have to
[53:10] do something. There's something for you
[53:12] to do. There's a road for you to walk.
[53:14] There's a path you have to take. Like I
[53:16] said, it may be to it's always to avoid
[53:18] a judgment. The word always takes you
[53:20] out of judgment and into Christ. But it
[53:22] may be to help somebody else do it.
[53:24] Amen. It may be to correct us and bring
[53:26] us to where we need to be, but when you
[53:28] receive the word of God, there's always
[53:29] something for you to do. James said,
[53:31] "Faith without works is dead." Amen.
[53:34] There's something that we have to do.
[53:35] Now, we look at Noah, and the scripture
[53:37] says, "Noah found grace in the eyes of
[53:38] the Lord." Noah found grace because he
[53:40] was a child of God, not because he was
[53:42] in and of himself anything great. He was
[53:44] a good man. He was a perfect man in his
[53:46] generation, but it's still grace because
[53:48] compared to God, we're all imperfect.
[53:50] But as a child of God, grace found him.
[53:52] And God gave Noah a commission to build
[53:54] an ark. And with that, he gave him a way
[53:57] of escape. His commission was his saving
[54:00] grace. If we could look at that way. And
[54:02] then it gives us a work or a ministry.
[54:04] Remember that commission is permission
[54:06] with full power. And so God gave Noah
[54:08] the ability. He gave him the time. He
[54:11] gave him the strength. He gave him the
[54:13] commitment to build an ark for 120 years
[54:16] and still preach throughout that as
[54:17] well. God doesn't call us to do
[54:20] something without giving us the strength
[54:21] to do it. church, if he's called you,
[54:24] he's made you able. Paul said, "I can do
[54:26] all things through Christ which
[54:27] strengthen me." He didn't he didn't
[54:30] start with what he needed, but God gives
[54:31] us what we have need of. And then after
[54:33] that always comes the reality of the
[54:35] promise. That's the benefit, church, is
[54:37] that what God says is real. It's true.
[54:39] It's going to happen. And so after 120
[54:41] years, God tells Noah, "Go into the
[54:43] ark." And then what does God do? He
[54:46] shuts the door.
[54:48] Noah didn't turn off the tap of grace.
[54:52] Noah's message was grace, grace, grace
[54:54] because judgment's coming otherwise. And
[54:56] when God called him in, God turned off
[54:58] grace. And Moses' message turned into a
[55:00] message of grace into the judgment. He
[55:02] wasn't preaching anymore. The doors were
[55:03] shut. It was too late. But once they
[55:05] were in church, once those doors were
[55:07] sealed, they had an assurance that they
[55:09] would make it through because they were
[55:10] in the very thing that God told them to
[55:13] build. It wasn't of their design. It was
[55:15] his design. It was his word. It was his
[55:17] commission. It was his way of doing
[55:18] things. So, they were now literally
[55:20] living in the word of God. And that was
[55:22] what was going to take them through. And
[55:24] I'm saying all that to set a foundation
[55:26] this morning. The power of taking God at
[55:28] his word. The power of taking your
[55:30] commission and sticking with it. No
[55:32] matter what happens, no matter what
[55:34] circumstances come, no matter how
[55:36] society turns against us, no matter what
[55:38] other churches say, no matter what other
[55:39] people say, no matter how much people
[55:41] pull back, you say, "I'm in it to the
[55:43] end. I'm in it to the end. I'm not going
[55:45] to stop until I fulfilled my
[55:46] commission." Amen. But it's not my
[55:49] power. It's his power. It's not your
[55:51] word. It's his word. We're a part of it.
[55:53] But it comes from him and it belongs to
[55:55] him. But I want us to turn back now to
[55:57] this thought on the disciples going up
[55:59] to wait in Jerusalem. And if we look in
[56:01] Mark 16, we see the commission that they
[56:03] received.
[56:05] And he says in Mark 16:14, he says,
[56:07] "Afterward, he appeared unto the 11 as
[56:09] they sat at meat, and upraided them with
[56:11] their unbelief and hardness of heart,
[56:14] but because they believed not them which
[56:15] had seen him after he was risen." And he
[56:18] said unto them, "Go ye into all the
[56:20] world, and preach the gospel to every
[56:22] creature." So here's the commission,
[56:25] church. Here's the orders. That's the
[56:26] work they're supposed to do is preach
[56:28] the gospel everywhere, to everyone. No
[56:32] exceptions.
[56:34] We don't decide who is and is not a
[56:36] child of God. That's what our flesh
[56:38] would want to do. God's got children of
[56:41] God everywhere. Amen. But notice now in
[56:45] their condition, they are in an
[56:47] unbelieving hard-hearted condition. And
[56:49] he gives them their commission.
[56:52] See, the commission is not dependent on
[56:54] what you are now. God will give you the
[56:56] commission. Moses had a commission to be
[56:58] a deliverer since he was born. But when
[57:00] God finally comes down and says it's
[57:02] time, then God makes a way for you to
[57:03] fulfill that commission. But they're
[57:05] still unregenerated men at this point.
[57:08] And he's giving them this great
[57:09] commission. He says, uh, he that
[57:11] believeth and is baptized shall be
[57:13] saved. In other words, you can't do like
[57:15] many churches preach today and say, I
[57:17] accept Jesus as my savior.
[57:19] Jesus didn't say that. He says what if
[57:22] you believe and are baptized. In other
[57:24] words, you got to take what you say you
[57:26] believe and put it into action. There's
[57:28] something for you to do when you receive
[57:30] the word. Faith without works is dead.
[57:32] You got to prove you believe it by doing
[57:34] what he said. And so if you believe God,
[57:36] you'll do exactly and specifically what
[57:38] his word requires. That's the nature of
[57:41] a believer. Amen. Then he says, "But he
[57:43] that believeth not shall be damned."
[57:45] Amen. Here's the benefit and the
[57:46] purpose. The preaching of the gospel now
[57:49] will save the believer and cause them to
[57:51] respond to the gospel the way they're
[57:53] supposed to. And the unbeliever will
[57:55] turn away. They're both a part of the
[57:57] commission church.
[57:59] Some have to be turned away and some
[58:02] have to be turned to. The commission
[58:04] fulfills both.
[58:06] Now watch this. He says, "And these
[58:08] signs shall follow them that believe."
[58:11] Now notice, church, this is not the
[58:13] commission.
[58:15] This is the proof of the commission.
[58:18] This is the effect of the commission.
[58:21] This is the benefit of the commission.
[58:23] See, before they were told to go out and
[58:25] preach repentance and heal and cast out
[58:28] devils, and it was all one commission.
[58:31] Jesus made that a commission to go out
[58:33] and heal the sick and raise the dead,
[58:34] cast out devils and all these things.
[58:36] Amen. The signs and wonders were the
[58:38] main element. And remember when the
[58:39] disciples came back, they did not come
[58:41] back saying, "Look, look, we've got so
[58:44] many disciples."
[58:46] They didn't say that. What did they say?
[58:49] Even the devils obey us. But they didn't
[58:52] come back with a bunch of believers.
[58:53] They came back with a bunch of signs and
[58:55] wonders. And when they go up into the
[58:57] upper room, there's only 109 disciples
[58:59] with them. Out of all of them, they've
[59:02] gotten about nine each, 10 each. That's
[59:05] it.
[59:06] All those signs and wonders. And what
[59:07] did it produce, church? Almost nothing.
[59:11] That can never be the main attraction.
[59:14] It's the bait on the hook, but it's the
[59:16] word that'll seal your soul. That's the
[59:19] only thing that's going to do it.
[59:19] Remember Jesus said, "I'll make you
[59:21] fishers of men." And in their first
[59:23] ministry with all those signs and
[59:24] wonders, they fished and got almost no
[59:26] men.
[59:28] But now he's making a change. Amen. So
[59:30] their their their early ministry didn't
[59:31] show the effect of the true gospel.
[59:33] Amen. Now the signs and wonders follow
[59:36] the preaching. Now the word is taking
[59:39] the effect. It's the primary. It's the
[59:41] preeminence. Why? Because now it's the
[59:44] full word. Now it's the full word. Look,
[59:46] we know this message and I won't go into
[59:48] it. You have a first poll with signs and
[59:49] wonders, a second poll with signs and
[59:50] wonders. The third pull is the word.
[59:52] It's always the word. And the first one
[59:54] and two, Jesus had it. Remember, he goes
[59:56] out and where he goes, he heals
[59:57] everybody and it draws all these people.
[1:00:00] Then he goes to the pool and he heals
[1:00:02] one. And then he preaches sermons that
[1:00:05] they don't understand and they all leave
[1:00:07] him. Right? The signs and wonders are to
[1:00:10] draw attraction to the word, but the
[1:00:12] word is what keeps you. It's the only
[1:00:14] thing that will keep you. It's the only
[1:00:16] thing that'll keep us as we go through
[1:00:17] this. Amen.
[1:00:19] He says, "In my name, they shall cast
[1:00:21] out devils and they'll speak with new
[1:00:23] tongues." Church, there's power in the
[1:00:24] name of Jesus Christ. There is power in
[1:00:26] the name of Jesus Christ. We've seen it
[1:00:28] here. We have it here. We've seen
[1:00:30] immediate results. We've seen uh healing
[1:00:32] results that are instantaneous, and
[1:00:34] we've seen them that take time. We've
[1:00:36] seen deliverances that take time. We've
[1:00:38] seen them instantaneous. We've seen life
[1:00:39] change in a moment. We've seen lives
[1:00:41] changed over years.
[1:00:44] We're still being changed. Amen. There's
[1:00:46] power in the name of Jesus. He says,
[1:00:49] "They shall take up serpents and if they
[1:00:51] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:00:52] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:00:54] sick and they shall recover." And we see
[1:00:56] this with the Apostle Paul. Remember, he
[1:00:58] he lands on that island. He's
[1:00:59] shipwrecked and he goes and he picks up
[1:01:01] some wood and a snake bites him, a
[1:01:02] poisonous snake, and he just shakes it
[1:01:04] off into the fire and walks away. We're
[1:01:06] not like those crazy people that bring
[1:01:08] rattlesnakes into the church.
[1:01:11] They're tempting God, church. And guess
[1:01:13] what? When they get bit, bad things
[1:01:15] happen.
[1:01:16] Why? Because they're not in the line of
[1:01:17] duty. They're trying to prove something
[1:01:20] rather than be something, right? That's
[1:01:22] not what he's talking about here. But
[1:01:25] we've seen these things. We've seen the
[1:01:27] sick recover. We're seeing the sick
[1:01:28] recover. Amen. That's a process of time,
[1:01:32] but it's still healing. You go to a
[1:01:33] doctor, two people get the same thing
[1:01:35] done to them. One dies, one lives. Why?
[1:01:37] God's a healer, not the doctor. They're
[1:01:40] doing something to benefit the body, but
[1:01:41] the body itself has to work and heal.
[1:01:43] And healing is God's business, not just
[1:01:45] a doctor's business. We spoke before how
[1:01:48] the disciples had power over devils and
[1:01:50] diseases, but their gospel was only one
[1:01:52] of repentance. But now they have a new
[1:01:55] gospel. And he says, "You got to go and
[1:01:57] preach what?" Salvation.
[1:01:59] This is a full gospel. This is a saving
[1:02:01] gospel. This is everything that they've
[1:02:03] been looking for under a new covenant,
[1:02:05] under grace. Amen. That old gospel could
[1:02:07] only prepare the people for salvation,
[1:02:09] but it couldn't save them. But now
[1:02:11] they've got a gospel that will actually
[1:02:13] save the people. But before they can go
[1:02:15] preach this gospel, Jesus said this
[1:02:17] thing, and we read it in our first uh
[1:02:19] scripture this morning. He says, "And
[1:02:20] behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:02:22] upon you, but tear ye in the city of
[1:02:25] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:02:28] from where? On high." Now that word
[1:02:32] endued is a very special word. It means
[1:02:34] to be clothed with or covered.
[1:02:38] In other words, something has to wrap
[1:02:40] around you. Something has to cover up
[1:02:43] who and what you are. This has to
[1:02:45] completely envelop your being.
[1:02:49] So that you can't be seen. And all
[1:02:50] that's seen is your covering. If I could
[1:02:53] say it this way, Jesus says, "You can't
[1:02:54] preach this gospel until you've received
[1:02:56] this gospel." You got to see what this
[1:02:59] gospel does before you can preach it.
[1:03:01] There are things in this Bible church I
[1:03:03] preach because they're there, not
[1:03:05] because I've had that experience yet. I
[1:03:08] haven't had all the experiences that we
[1:03:09] read about in here and nobody ever will.
[1:03:12] But I see things and I preach them
[1:03:13] because they're there. But there are
[1:03:15] things I preach in a different way
[1:03:17] because I know they work because I've
[1:03:19] experienced it. And let me tell you,
[1:03:20] when I preach those, I preach them
[1:03:22] differently because I can tell you by
[1:03:24] personal experience it works. Amen.
[1:03:27] Jesus is saying here, we'll see it
[1:03:29] later. You can't even preach this right
[1:03:31] until you receive it. Because you don't
[1:03:34] even know what it's going to look like.
[1:03:35] He can take them back to Ezekiel 36 and
[1:03:38] and Isaiah, Joel 2:28 and these things
[1:03:40] and we can preach and preach and preach
[1:03:41] it. But they didn't know what that would
[1:03:43] look like until it actually happened.
[1:03:45] And sometimes that's the problem is we
[1:03:46] put God in a box because we preach it
[1:03:48] the way we think it's got to be rather
[1:03:50] than the way it will be. We'll see this
[1:03:52] as we go, church. We've got to let God
[1:03:53] be God and let it be the way it's going
[1:03:55] to be. We can't put them in a box of
[1:03:58] prescriptions because of the way we
[1:04:00] think. Amen.
[1:04:02] I'm not here to preach theology today.
[1:04:05] I'm here to preach a reality of Christ.
[1:04:08] Amen. I'm not preaching today because
[1:04:11] I'm just a a guy that wants to get up
[1:04:14] here and talk.
[1:04:16] I'm here today because I know what it
[1:04:18] means to have the power of God in my
[1:04:20] life. I wasn't born a Christian. I
[1:04:23] wasn't born good. I wasn't born right. I
[1:04:25] was born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[1:04:26] same as everybody else. I'm not a
[1:04:28] preacher today. I'm not a Christian
[1:04:29] today because I was born that way. I
[1:04:32] wasn't born right. I wasn't born good.
[1:04:36] Listen, being raised in a right home
[1:04:38] helps, but it doesn't make me a
[1:04:40] Christian. Coming to church is good, but
[1:04:43] that doesn't make me a Christian.
[1:04:45] Listening to the right music and hanging
[1:04:47] around the right friends doesn't make me
[1:04:49] a Christian. Those things protect me.
[1:04:54] Those things help me make right
[1:04:55] decisions.
[1:04:56] But what makes me a Christian is when
[1:04:58] Christ lives inside me. And that's how I
[1:05:01] got where I am today. That's why I am
[1:05:02] the way I am today. That's why I trust
[1:05:04] you are the way you are today. Is
[1:05:06] because Christ has come down inside of
[1:05:08] you. Christian means Christlike. And you
[1:05:11] can only be like Christ if you have
[1:05:12] Christ on the inside. This is surface.
[1:05:16] This is religion. If he's on the inside,
[1:05:20] that's what makes it life. Cuz otherwise
[1:05:21] the letter kills. But it's the spirit
[1:05:24] that gives us life. And to be like
[1:05:25] Christ, you have to have Christ on the
[1:05:27] inside. Otherwise, it's just dead
[1:05:29] religion and men's works. going around
[1:05:31] with brother Joe and or brother Bob and
[1:05:32] sister Joe yesterday and we're in the
[1:05:34] big churches and we went down to the big
[1:05:36] Anglican church and and the basilica and
[1:05:39] you look at that and you see what men
[1:05:40] can do beautiful
[1:05:45] dead
[1:05:47] it's just surface it's just surface
[1:05:49] there's nothing to it amen but it takes
[1:05:52] Christ on the inside to make us into a
[1:05:54] Christian not just coming to church not
[1:05:56] just nodding our head Christian culture
[1:05:58] didn't make me a Christian. That's one
[1:06:00] of the greatest dangers we have as a
[1:06:02] culture, a way of living rather than
[1:06:04] life itself. It takes life itself to
[1:06:07] make us into Christ. Amen. It's his life
[1:06:09] inside of me that makes me the way I am.
[1:06:12] Too many people today are trying to live
[1:06:13] a Christian walk without Christ inside
[1:06:15] of them. And it will never work in and
[1:06:18] out, up and down. Am I saved? Am I not
[1:06:21] saved? It takes the anchor of the Holy
[1:06:24] Spirit inside your life to get you
[1:06:25] there. Amen. We can't come to him
[1:06:27] perfect.
[1:06:28] We can't come to him good. We just have
[1:06:31] to come the way we are and let him do
[1:06:32] something with us. That's the only way
[1:06:34] this is ever going to work out. Church,
[1:06:36] joining a church won't do it. Coming to
[1:06:39] church won't do it. Singing and clapping
[1:06:41] hands and having a wonderful song
[1:06:42] service like we had this morning. That
[1:06:44] won't do it. Putting your name on a
[1:06:46] church membership book won't do it. We
[1:06:48] don't have one here anyways. But the
[1:06:50] scripture says by one spirit you're
[1:06:52] baptized into one body. It takes the
[1:06:54] life of Christ to make you a believer
[1:06:56] this morning. And it's the only way
[1:06:57] that'll ever work. Amen.
[1:07:01] What do you have to do? You've got to
[1:07:03] get before God and you say, "God, I'm
[1:07:06] here to be changed."
[1:07:08] That's it. God, I'm here to be changed.
[1:07:10] And not leave until he changes you.
[1:07:14] Say, "God, I'm here to be delivered.
[1:07:16] God, I'm here to be washed. God, I'm
[1:07:19] here to be rebirthed. God, I'm here to
[1:07:22] die." That's what it's going to take.
[1:07:25] God, I'm here to die. Amen. We can't
[1:07:27] walk into Christ with our own ideas. It
[1:07:30] won't work. Cuz if we do, we'll try and
[1:07:32] make it happen the way we think it
[1:07:34] should happen. We'll try and have an
[1:07:36] experience the way we think that we're
[1:07:37] supposed to have an experience. Church,
[1:07:39] let your experience with Christ be the
[1:07:41] experience with Christ. If you look at
[1:07:43] all the testimonies we have here, not
[1:07:44] all of us had the same experience. We
[1:07:46] have the same result, but the experience
[1:07:49] that we all have is different. We've got
[1:07:52] people that came out of denominations.
[1:07:54] We've got people that came out of the
[1:07:56] great We've got people that came
[1:07:58] out of just off the streets.
[1:08:02] We've got people that came out of
[1:08:03] religious works.
[1:08:05] We've got people that came out of drugs
[1:08:07] and addiction and all these different
[1:08:08] things. But your experience is different
[1:08:11] than everyone else's. But the result is
[1:08:13] always the same. It makes you like him.
[1:08:16] It makes you like him. Amen.
[1:08:19] This is where we come to an idea of what
[1:08:20] an absolute is because we have all sorts
[1:08:22] of absolutes today. I've been listening
[1:08:23] to that message, an absolute.
[1:08:26] But the absolutes we have today, they're
[1:08:28] not real absolutes. They think they are.
[1:08:30] We treat them like they are. We say the
[1:08:32] law is an absolute.
[1:08:34] We say the law is an absolute. If it
[1:08:35] says it's wrong and you do it, then
[1:08:37] something's going to happen. And yet, we
[1:08:39] look around, we see all sorts of people
[1:08:40] breaking laws and nothing happening to
[1:08:41] them. We see people twisting it and
[1:08:44] manipulating it. to the law, we treat it
[1:08:46] like an absolute, but it isn't an
[1:08:48] absolute. We say, "Well, the courts are
[1:08:49] an absolute. The Supreme Court of
[1:08:51] Canada, the Supreme Court of the United
[1:08:52] States is an absolute because there's no
[1:08:54] higher authority in the country." But
[1:08:56] guess what? There are things that can
[1:08:57] override a Supreme Court. You can go to
[1:09:00] a world court.
[1:09:02] You say, "Well, the world court is the
[1:09:04] highest." Then you got people that will
[1:09:05] disobey the world court. Israel has has
[1:09:08] claims against their leaders from world
[1:09:09] courts. So, it's an absolute only as
[1:09:12] much as we let it be an absolute. Then
[1:09:14] we say, "Well, we have absolute control
[1:09:15] over our bodies, do we?" We say, "I'm
[1:09:19] going to put my foot down. They can't do
[1:09:20] it to me. I won't do it." And now all of
[1:09:21] a sudden, we're doing things we don't
[1:09:22] want to do. We have no absolutes.
[1:09:25] They're all absolutes in context, but
[1:09:27] they're not absolutes in and of
[1:09:28] themselves.
[1:09:30] Brother Brown would say this. He says,
[1:09:32] "According to Webster's, absolute means
[1:09:34] this, perfect in itself, unlimited in
[1:09:38] its power, and primarily an ultimate."
[1:09:41] He said, "And an ultimate is the amen.
[1:09:43] That's all." He says, "That's all of it.
[1:09:45] That settles it." And I went to look
[1:09:46] deeper on this song of an absolute and I
[1:09:49] found more and I feel like it fleshes
[1:09:50] out this idea of what an absolute is.
[1:09:52] And when speaking of the law, it says
[1:09:54] that an absolute is the final decree is
[1:09:57] the period at the end of all things. An
[1:10:00] absolute is that which does not need to
[1:10:02] be viewed with relation to other things.
[1:10:04] Now to put that into into other words,
[1:10:07] it doesn't need comparisons to make it
[1:10:10] clear or right or correct. It stands
[1:10:14] alone and everything else is compared to
[1:10:16] it. Did you know we weigh things and we
[1:10:19] think, well, you know, a kilogram is is
[1:10:21] is this and we just accept it. But you
[1:10:23] did you know there's an absolute for a
[1:10:25] kilogram and it's this perfectly shaped
[1:10:28] sphere. I think it weighs more than it
[1:10:29] might be 10 kilograms. Whatever it is,
[1:10:31] it's a perfectly shaped spear that is
[1:10:33] that is is perfectly round and smooth
[1:10:36] down to the smallest measurement. It's
[1:10:38] shaped with lasers. It's so perfect. It
[1:10:41] has perfect reflection. There's and this
[1:10:43] is the standard for all weight.
[1:10:46] Everything is compared to that one
[1:10:48] perfect ball of material that weighs
[1:10:50] exactly 1.0000
[1:10:54] kg.
[1:10:56] It is perfect. Everything else relates
[1:10:58] to that. An absolute is that which is
[1:11:00] true or right and the same in all
[1:11:04] conditions. It never changes.
[1:11:07] It is something that is certain and not
[1:11:09] to be doubted. In other words, it's the
[1:11:10] only thing worth believing.
[1:11:14] It says existing independent of all
[1:11:17] others and standing alone. And when I
[1:11:19] read that, I thought of grace
[1:11:22] because grace has no limit. It is
[1:11:24] independent. It is remember what grace
[1:11:26] said. It is merit without it is favor
[1:11:29] without merit. You don't deserve it. It
[1:11:31] stands alone. You get it because it
[1:11:33] stands alone, not because of who and
[1:11:35] what you are. And then I saw this and
[1:11:38] this was not like I was not reading this
[1:11:39] on a religious site. This was a Google
[1:11:41] search and it said that that an absolute
[1:11:45] is ultimate reality
[1:11:48] God. I said God bless you whoever wrote
[1:11:51] that. The ultimate reality or God.
[1:11:55] That's what an absolute is. Amen. So,
[1:11:58] we're talking about the disciples going
[1:11:59] to Jerusalem and they're supposed to
[1:12:01] wait until they get power. They'd had
[1:12:04] power before, but this was different
[1:12:05] power. This was absolute power that was
[1:12:08] going to drop in. Amen. But when we look
[1:12:10] at that definition of a of an absolute,
[1:12:12] and then we start to talk about absolute
[1:12:14] power, we have to see one thing, and
[1:12:16] that's that we are doomed if we think we
[1:12:19] can have anything to do with an
[1:12:21] absolute.
[1:12:23] Brother John, you've been preaching on
[1:12:24] absolute power. We've raised our hands
[1:12:26] and said, "I want absolute power." We're
[1:12:28] going to see what that looks like this
[1:12:29] morning. But the thing is, if it is
[1:12:31] absolute, what do I add to it? What do I
[1:12:35] bring to it? It is perfect in itself.
[1:12:38] It's it it is it is standing alone. It
[1:12:41] has nothing to do with me. So, I can't
[1:12:43] have anything to do with an absolute
[1:12:45] because I can't add to it because it has
[1:12:48] everything it needs. And I can't take
[1:12:50] anything from it because it has
[1:12:51] everything it needs. It stands alone.
[1:12:54] Amen. So when it comes to absolute
[1:12:56] power, we can't bring anything of
[1:12:58] ourselves to it because it is absolute.
[1:13:01] It has everything it needs. We pray
[1:13:04] before our services there with the
[1:13:06] musicians.
[1:13:07] And my prayer every time is, Lord, take
[1:13:10] what we have and use it.
[1:13:13] I can't take it and use it. You have to
[1:13:15] take it and use it.
[1:13:17] When I'm preaching, my prayer is, "Lord,
[1:13:20] set me aside so you can flow through."
[1:13:23] Because the minute I add myself to it,
[1:13:26] it taints it.
[1:13:28] It makes it less than absolute.
[1:13:31] And I'm amazed that he calls it the
[1:13:32] foolishness of preaching because that's
[1:13:34] exactly what it is. But yet, it is an
[1:13:35] absolute when the spirit is speaking.
[1:13:38] Amen. But we can't bring anything of
[1:13:40] ourselves to it. Amen. When it comes to
[1:13:42] having our lives changed, we can't come
[1:13:44] in with any thoughts or ideas or
[1:13:46] preferences or anything like that
[1:13:47] because when we do, we take that
[1:13:49] absolute and we make it subject to us,
[1:13:52] subject to our ideas, subject to our
[1:13:54] preferences, and we completely limit it.
[1:13:56] And you can't limit an absolute. It's
[1:13:59] not meant to be limited. Amen. I've said
[1:14:01] this before. If we could do it on our
[1:14:03] own, we already would have done it. And
[1:14:05] so if we're looking for absolute power
[1:14:07] in our lives, we can't say, "I'm going
[1:14:09] to take what I have and then Lord, add
[1:14:11] on to it." What we have to say is,
[1:14:13] "Lord, what I have doesn't work and I'm
[1:14:16] throwing it away. I'm laying it down.
[1:14:20] I'm going to let you do what you want.
[1:14:22] If you want to pick up a portion of me
[1:14:23] back and use it again, then you can do
[1:14:24] it. But otherwise, I've got to lay it
[1:14:26] down because you're the absolute and I
[1:14:28] am not. You have everything I need. I
[1:14:32] don't. You have all the power. I have
[1:14:34] none of it. I have every good intention,
[1:14:37] but that's still not good enough. It's
[1:14:39] not going to get me across the finish
[1:14:41] line. Amen.
[1:14:43] If we could overcome the lust of the
[1:14:45] flesh and the predisposition to do
[1:14:47] certain things, our addictive natures,
[1:14:49] our besetting sins, our broken hearts,
[1:14:51] our emotions that are always getting us
[1:14:52] in trouble, the uncertainty of our
[1:14:54] worth, whatever it might be, we'd have
[1:14:56] done it already. But we can't because we
[1:14:59] don't have that power. We can't make
[1:15:01] ourselves something that we're not.
[1:15:02] Amen. And yet we see people trying to do
[1:15:04] it day after day after day. And what do
[1:15:06] they do? They're trying to crawl up the
[1:15:08] sides of their life.
[1:15:11] Have you ever seen they have those walls
[1:15:12] that they start at a shallow curve and
[1:15:14] then they just get steeper and steeper
[1:15:15] and steeper. And the goal is to try and
[1:15:17] get up, but you find that you can only
[1:15:19] get so far and then you just start to
[1:15:21] slip down. And that's what people do in
[1:15:22] life. We get ahead. We get to get ahead.
[1:15:24] We get ahead. And then what do we do? We
[1:15:26] fall right back because nothing's
[1:15:27] changed. We don't have power to get
[1:15:29] ourselves out of the way. We don't have
[1:15:31] power to move forward. Amen. We're prone
[1:15:33] to fall, prone to wander. We're lost
[1:15:35] sheep. That's exactly what we are. Amen.
[1:15:38] We need something greater than
[1:15:39] ourselves. And that's what Jesus is
[1:15:40] driving home with the disciples. Amen.
[1:15:43] They needed something that would get
[1:15:44] them out of the way. They needed
[1:15:46] something that would anchor them when
[1:15:48] they didn't have anything to be
[1:15:49] anchored. Church, they were going to be
[1:15:50] threatened. They were going to be
[1:15:52] killed. They were going to be outcasts.
[1:15:53] They were going to be social rejects.
[1:15:57] I think John was the only disciple that
[1:16:00] died a natural death. and they tried to
[1:16:01] boil him and they couldn't kill him.
[1:16:04] Everyone else, as far as I know, died an
[1:16:06] unnatural death. And some of them died
[1:16:08] within two or three years of Jesus
[1:16:09] going.
[1:16:11] They needed something that would take
[1:16:12] them right up to the gates of death and
[1:16:14] hell. And they walked through in total
[1:16:16] comfort, peace, and rest, and that would
[1:16:19] lead them the path there without fear of
[1:16:21] what would wait beyond those things.
[1:16:24] The problem with the disciples was
[1:16:25] always the disciples.
[1:16:28] Problem with me is me. problem with you
[1:16:31] is you this morning. We need something
[1:16:33] that'll get us out of the way. Something
[1:16:35] greater than what we are. Something
[1:16:36] that's more than what we are. We need an
[1:16:38] absolute to take us beyond all the
[1:16:40] limitations that we have in this life.
[1:16:42] They had all the zeal and all the
[1:16:44] passion and all the faith. But it needed
[1:16:46] something to channel it. It needed
[1:16:48] something to inspire it. Truly inspire
[1:16:51] it. Something that would take it and
[1:16:53] make it work. Amen. And they needed to
[1:16:55] get to a place where their security,
[1:16:57] their assurance was not that I have done
[1:16:58] well or that I am good or that I follow
[1:17:02] Jesus, but that there is something on
[1:17:04] the inside that says I am his and he is
[1:17:06] mine. That's what they needed. And they
[1:17:08] never had it. They never had it. For all
[1:17:10] the signs and wonders, for all the three
[1:17:11] and a half years of walking around with
[1:17:13] Jesus and all his assurance and his
[1:17:15] calling and election, they still were
[1:17:17] not secure on the inside.
[1:17:19] But to get there, we've got to lay
[1:17:21] everything down that we have to that
[1:17:23] point.
[1:17:25] Everything. Everything has to be laid
[1:17:28] down. Amen. We've got to take it, as I
[1:17:30] said, and lay it down before God.
[1:17:33] Empty out completely
[1:17:37] so that he can fill us, so that he can
[1:17:39] make us. so that he can mold us, so that
[1:17:42] he can turn us into his image rather
[1:17:44] than the images of our moms and dads and
[1:17:47] our grandfathers and our grandmothers
[1:17:48] and these things. Amen. We've got to be
[1:17:50] able to come and say, "Lord, I am clay.
[1:17:52] Mold me. Break me down.
[1:17:56] Put me into the way that you want me to
[1:17:57] be." It's the only way. Paul said it
[1:18:00] this way. He says, "But what things were
[1:18:02] gained to me? Those I counted loss for
[1:18:05] Christ." Another translation reads, "At
[1:18:08] one time all those things were important
[1:18:09] to me, but because of Christ, I decided
[1:18:12] that they are worth nothing." He says,
[1:18:14] "Yeah, doubtless and I count all things
[1:18:16] but loss for the excellency of the
[1:18:18] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
[1:18:20] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:18:23] things, and do count them but dung that
[1:18:25] I may win Christ." That same translation
[1:18:28] says, "Yes, now I know that Christ Jesus
[1:18:31] as my Lord, that is the most valuable
[1:18:33] thing. Nothing else is important at all.
[1:18:37] I have thrown everything else away so
[1:18:40] that I can serve Christ. All those other
[1:18:42] things are like dirt to me. I think
[1:18:45] about them like that so I can have
[1:18:47] Christ. He says, "And be found in him,
[1:18:50] not having my own righteousness." What?
[1:18:52] My own thoughts, my own works, my own
[1:18:54] opinions, my own religion, my own
[1:18:56] service, all these things that is gone.
[1:19:00] He says, "Which is of the law, but that
[1:19:02] which is through the faith of Christ,
[1:19:03] the righteousness which is of God by
[1:19:05] faith." He says, "That I may know him in
[1:19:08] one type of power, the power of his
[1:19:11] resurrection." He says, "Which is or the
[1:19:14] fellowship of his sufferings be made
[1:19:16] conformable unto his death." Now, notice
[1:19:18] the power of his resurrection. There's
[1:19:20] two things we've got to look at there.
[1:19:22] We've got the power of the new birth,
[1:19:24] and then we've got the power of a
[1:19:25] resurrection and a rapture. Because the
[1:19:27] new birth is I have died and I've been
[1:19:29] born again. That's the power of
[1:19:31] resurrection. But that's just what it's
[1:19:33] the evidence of what's coming later. A
[1:19:36] full resurrection, a full rapture, a
[1:19:38] full change. So, we've got to know that
[1:19:40] he's alive. And Christ says to the
[1:19:42] disciples, "Go and wait until you get
[1:19:44] resurrection power."
[1:19:46] That's absolute power. That's power over
[1:19:48] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:19:51] The greatest battles, the greatest enemy
[1:19:53] that we have is death, hell, and the
[1:19:54] grave. And he says, "You got to go get
[1:19:56] power over that." And that'll give you
[1:19:58] power over everything else in your way,
[1:20:00] including yourselves.
[1:20:02] That would be power that would make them
[1:20:03] fit, ready, able to do what God wanted
[1:20:05] them to do. But they didn't have it.
[1:20:08] Amen. That power would make them
[1:20:09] effective preachers. They weren't
[1:20:11] effective preachers.
[1:20:14] They could heal. They could cast out
[1:20:16] demons. They could raise the dead, but
[1:20:17] they couldn't save souls.
[1:20:19] This is what it would take to make them
[1:20:21] uh effective preachers to overcome their
[1:20:24] personal issues. Amen. Peter has this
[1:20:26] great promise in his life. Remember
[1:20:27] Jesus said, "Peter, I'm going to give
[1:20:29] you the keys to the kingdom. And
[1:20:31] whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in
[1:20:33] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth,
[1:20:34] I'll loose in heaven." Church, that's
[1:20:36] pretty absolute. That's absolute power.
[1:20:38] Jesus is saying, "Whatever you say,
[1:20:40] Peter, I'll do it." It doesn't get much
[1:20:43] more absolute than that. I can't think
[1:20:44] of anything else. Whatever you say will
[1:20:46] happen, Peter.
[1:20:48] That's what he said to Peter. But what's
[1:20:50] the weakness here?
[1:20:52] The weakness is Peter. Mr. In and out,
[1:20:54] Mr. Up and down. One minute he's got
[1:20:56] revelation from God and the next he's
[1:20:58] channeling Satan. You put absolute power
[1:21:01] into that vessel, church, and what will
[1:21:03] it do? Destroy. It's the only thing it
[1:21:06] will do. It will destroy Peter. It'll
[1:21:08] destroy the people around him. Cuz
[1:21:09] Peter's got a pretty high opinion of
[1:21:11] himself. Peter's still got some pride.
[1:21:14] He's still got some arrogance. Lord,
[1:21:15] I'll never leave you. Lord, I would
[1:21:16] never do that. Lord, I'll never deny
[1:21:18] you.
[1:21:20] And then what's he doing? Denying Christ
[1:21:22] three times and then he runs away. Hides
[1:21:24] in the room and disbelieves the story of
[1:21:27] his resurrection.
[1:21:29] That's not going to get him anywhere.
[1:21:30] You pour absolute power into Peter at
[1:21:32] this point and it will selfdestruct
[1:21:34] and it'll destroy everyone else around
[1:21:36] him. It'll destroy everyone else around
[1:21:38] him. Amen. God needs people that are
[1:21:40] humble, unassuming,
[1:21:43] yielded,
[1:21:45] resting and waiting. That's what God
[1:21:48] needs for absolute power to flow through
[1:21:50] them. People that are surrendered to
[1:21:51] him. You know, there's a saying we've
[1:21:53] heard, absolute power corrupts
[1:21:55] absolutely. And it's absolutely true.
[1:21:58] You see this today. How many leaders do
[1:22:01] you see that start out
[1:22:04] and they're often good people, good
[1:22:06] intentions, but the higher they go up
[1:22:08] the power ladder, the worse and the
[1:22:10] worse they get because our nature is
[1:22:12] destructive. It's selfish. It's
[1:22:15] egocentric. And so what do we do? We
[1:22:18] start to take that power and use it for
[1:22:19] self to the detriment of everyone else
[1:22:22] around us. Amen. If Peter was given
[1:22:26] absolutely, even with his good
[1:22:28] intentions, he'd be a destructive force
[1:22:30] in the church of the living God. He'd
[1:22:32] destroy everything. So, he went up in
[1:22:34] the upper room, church.
[1:22:36] Here's the thing, children of God,
[1:22:37] they'll always come to the word. Peter,
[1:22:40] for all his flaws, he went up and he
[1:22:42] waited and he waited and he waited and
[1:22:44] he waited with 119 other people. Amen.
[1:22:48] Why? He believed it would happen. He
[1:22:50] took Jesus at his word. He made Jesus
[1:22:52] word an absolute. and he says, "I'm
[1:22:53] going to do exactly what you say cuz I
[1:22:55] need what you're talking about."
[1:22:57] Sometimes that's our problem, church. We
[1:22:59] don't realize we need it. We don't
[1:23:01] realize we need it. We're so busy
[1:23:02] saying, "I'm a message believer. I'm a
[1:23:04] born again Christian. I've got the Holy
[1:23:05] Ghost." And we don't realize we've got
[1:23:07] to grow every single day. Every single
[1:23:10] week. Amen. And so, he went up with 119
[1:23:13] others and they said, "We're going to
[1:23:15] obey the word and we're going to wait
[1:23:16] until we get exactly what he talks
[1:23:18] about." They didn't leave Jerusalem.
[1:23:19] They didn't try and preach. They didn't
[1:23:20] start a new church. They didn't do
[1:23:22] anything. They went up and they waited.
[1:23:24] Now remember church, they didn't have
[1:23:26] computers, phones, movies, TVs, or the
[1:23:30] internet.
[1:23:32] And for 10 days, they sat there and did
[1:23:36] nothing except dwell on the promise.
[1:23:41] If I were to challenge you to make it to
[1:23:43] next Wednesday's service without picking
[1:23:45] up a screen, how many of us would get
[1:23:48] there?
[1:23:52] I was talking to a guy at the gym
[1:23:54] yesterday, day before,
[1:23:58] and he says, "I've got friends that say,
[1:23:59] "Boy, I wish I could go to the gym and
[1:24:01] stay healthy, but I just don't have
[1:24:02] time."
[1:24:05] He said, "Everybody's got an hour.
[1:24:08] Everybody's got an hour. They just don't
[1:24:10] want to find it. They just don't want to
[1:24:12] find it." Amen.
[1:24:16] These things are distractions to us.
[1:24:18] Satan is a master of distraction.
[1:24:21] I'm not here to preach against tools
[1:24:23] this morning. But if we turn to it as a
[1:24:25] distraction time and time again, guess
[1:24:28] what? It's sucking up things that belong
[1:24:31] to God. Sucking up time that belongs to
[1:24:33] God. Amen.
[1:24:35] You say, "I don't have an hour for
[1:24:37] devotions." Pick up your phone and ask
[1:24:39] your phone how much time you've spent on
[1:24:41] it every day. I've told you, Brother Joe
[1:24:43] and I, we share this on a weekly basis.
[1:24:45] I'm winning, by the way.
[1:24:48] He uses his for work. I use it not for
[1:24:52] work.
[1:24:54] So maybe he's winning.
[1:24:57] Brother Joe, do you mind me telling what
[1:24:58] we used to spend?
[1:25:01] We'll be interactive this morning. How
[1:25:03] long do you think how much time do you
[1:25:04] think your pastor spent on his phone a
[1:25:06] year ago? Just hold up your hands for a
[1:25:08] number of hours per day. My daughter
[1:25:11] says five. She says four. My wife says
[1:25:13] four. Paul says seven.
[1:25:18] The fours have it four hours a day.
[1:25:21] Okay? Four hours a day. Bathroom breaks
[1:25:24] could often take a half hour purely on
[1:25:27] the basis of the phone, not what was
[1:25:29] happening in there. You see what I talk
[1:25:31] about? You laugh, but we ask where did
[1:25:34] our time go? I'm not sure why I'm going
[1:25:36] here. We're just going to go with it.
[1:25:37] Okay? Where did my time go?
[1:25:40] I stay up too late.
[1:25:43] I wake up late. And where did my time
[1:25:46] go?
[1:25:48] Distractions.
[1:25:51] I'm down to an hour now.
[1:25:54] You can do it if I can do it. Okay.
[1:25:58] But I have and I've shared this before
[1:26:00] on my on my phone. It says, "Do you need
[1:26:02] to be on your phone?" That's my home
[1:26:05] screen to remind me. Now it's become
[1:26:07] almost second nature. I don't really
[1:26:09] pick it up very much, but for a while
[1:26:11] that was there to remind me, why are you
[1:26:13] picking up your phone?
[1:26:15] or for what reason?
[1:26:17] Is it for good or is it for
[1:26:20] entertainment? Waste time, bored,
[1:26:24] whatever that might be.
[1:26:26] Church, they went up and they spent 10
[1:26:28] days without entertainment,
[1:26:30] without going for a jog,
[1:26:34] without walking through the city. They
[1:26:36] got everything they needed and they
[1:26:37] said, "We're not moving until we get the
[1:26:39] promise."
[1:26:41] Sometimes the problem is we won't lay
[1:26:44] everything down.
[1:26:46] And I mean everything down. Where we
[1:26:48] come and we say, "Lord, I'm only doing
[1:26:50] exactly what is necessary.
[1:26:53] And the rest of my time, I'm going to
[1:26:54] lay before you until I get your answer,
[1:26:58] not my answer." See, that's the problem,
[1:27:00] church. We go in and we say, "I'm going
[1:27:02] to fast and pray until he gives me what
[1:27:03] I want." No, you've got to go in and ask
[1:27:05] him for what he promised.
[1:27:08] Not just what I want because this little
[1:27:10] man is selfish if you didn't know. You
[1:27:12] got to go and you got to wait before
[1:27:14] him. Lay your phones down. Lay your
[1:27:17] laptops down. Lay your iPads down. Lay
[1:27:20] your work down.
[1:27:22] Guess what? The work will be there next
[1:27:24] week.
[1:27:27] Listen, you can get ahead in the
[1:27:29] corporate world without doing 60 hours a
[1:27:31] week. I'm living proof. I said I work 40
[1:27:34] hours a week. That's it, guys. And if I
[1:27:36] can't do it in 40 hours a week, then
[1:27:38] nobody can do it.
[1:27:40] We don't have to work 60 hours a week.
[1:27:42] And then wonder why we're suffering in
[1:27:44] our relationships with our family, with
[1:27:47] God, no time for devotions, no time for
[1:27:50] prayer, no time for cover for the for
[1:27:53] the saints with prayer because we're too
[1:27:55] busy doing stuff.
[1:27:58] Amen. We're supposed to be serving the
[1:27:59] kingdom of God always, first foremost.
[1:28:02] That is our primary goal. Amen.
[1:28:06] Sometimes we just got to say, "God, I'm
[1:28:08] laying everything else aside until I
[1:28:10] hear from you. And I'm not going to move
[1:28:12] until I hear from you."
[1:28:16] Brother Bram says it this way.
[1:28:19] And when you get desperate about this
[1:28:20] thing, something will take place. You're
[1:28:23] not desperate enough. Oh, well, I join
[1:28:26] church. That settles it. He says, "But
[1:28:28] you have to be desperate about it. You
[1:28:30] have to really need God." Now, notice
[1:28:32] there, you've got to recognize your need
[1:28:34] is God
[1:28:37] and his answer,
[1:28:39] not just what you're asking for.
[1:28:42] I've said this before. People come up to
[1:28:43] for prayer sometimes, and my prayer is
[1:28:45] not what they ask me to pray about. It's
[1:28:48] because there's something else that
[1:28:49] needs to be dealt with first. Your
[1:28:51] answer will come after the situation is
[1:28:53] resolved the way God needs it to be
[1:28:54] resolved. Sometimes we've got to make a
[1:28:56] move. Sometimes we've got to turn.
[1:28:58] Sometimes we've got to stop. Sometimes
[1:28:59] we've got to start. Sometimes we've got
[1:29:01] to lay down. Sometimes we've got to pick
[1:29:02] up.
[1:29:06] God's got to give us direction in these
[1:29:07] things. He says, "You have to really
[1:29:09] need God." Jesus said, "Blessed are they
[1:29:11] that do hunger and thirst after
[1:29:13] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[1:29:15] But as long as you're satisfied with the
[1:29:18] things of this world, how can God ever
[1:29:20] speak to you?" You say, "God never spoke
[1:29:22] to me." He says, "Why? He wants to, but
[1:29:25] you're too filled up with the things of
[1:29:27] the world. Now, I'm not saying you're
[1:29:28] filled up in your life. I can say it can
[1:29:30] be filled up in your time.
[1:29:33] If it's filling your time, church, it's
[1:29:34] got to be filling something else, right?
[1:29:37] If I spend four hours doing something, I
[1:29:39] don't care how great a Christian I am,
[1:29:40] it's going to affect me because I'm
[1:29:43] spending four hours a day doing it. So,
[1:29:44] is it of of God or is it of this world?
[1:29:48] If it's not of God, church, there's only
[1:29:49] one other source, this world. And so if
[1:29:53] we are primarily serving this world,
[1:29:55] then what are you filled up with? This
[1:29:57] world. That's the only way it can work.
[1:30:00] You can't give 30 minutes a day to God
[1:30:02] and four hours a day to the world and
[1:30:03] expect God to win in your life. Amen. Is
[1:30:06] that clear enough? We've got to be able
[1:30:08] to lay those things down. Feed ourselves
[1:30:11] to strengthen ourselves in our walk with
[1:30:13] God. He says that's the matter with us
[1:30:15] today. We put all of our time on things
[1:30:19] of the world, the pleasures of the
[1:30:21] world, and give no time to God. It's
[1:30:23] true.
[1:30:25] So many times we're saying, "God, I need
[1:30:27] this. I need this. Will you give this to
[1:30:29] me? Lord, fill me up." And what's the
[1:30:31] problem, church? We're already full.
[1:30:33] We're already full. We've got everything
[1:30:36] full. Our schedule's full. Our life is
[1:30:38] cho full. Our energy's gone into other
[1:30:40] things. And we're saying, "Lord, I need
[1:30:41] more." And he's saying, "No, you need
[1:30:42] less so you can get more. You got to lay
[1:30:45] something down. You got to pour
[1:30:46] something out so he can pour something
[1:30:47] in.
[1:30:49] But we can't just load it on and load it
[1:30:51] on and load it on. It's not going to
[1:30:54] work that way. Amen. God's a gentleman.
[1:30:57] God's a gentleman. And he won't take
[1:30:59] something out that you're wanting to
[1:31:00] hold on to. Now, what he will do is let
[1:31:03] you get good and desperate by reaping
[1:31:04] what you've sown with that thing. But
[1:31:06] God won't just come in and rip it out.
[1:31:09] God will put you in a condition where
[1:31:10] you say, "Lord, I want you more than I
[1:31:12] want that." That's what happens. Amen.
[1:31:15] But many times we want to hold on to
[1:31:16] something, but what we don't want is the
[1:31:19] effect of holding on to something.
[1:31:21] Okay, I'm going to be a little pastoral
[1:31:23] this morning if it's okay.
[1:31:25] We're holding on to something and we
[1:31:27] say, "Lord, what we really we say, Lord,
[1:31:29] take it away." But what we want to take
[1:31:30] away is the effect rather than what
[1:31:32] we're doing because we love what we're
[1:31:34] doing so much.
[1:31:37] Listen, we may not call a lot of these
[1:31:38] things besetting sins. They may be
[1:31:40] addictions. They may be habits,
[1:31:42] preferences, things we like to do.
[1:31:45] Listen, this world has made a habit of
[1:31:47] self-love
[1:31:49] and that can bleed right into the
[1:31:51] Christian walk where you're doing what
[1:31:52] makes you feel good rather than what
[1:31:55] makes you good. There's a big gap
[1:31:58] between those. Amen. So, what do we do?
[1:32:00] We want to sanctify our bad habits. We
[1:32:02] want to sanctify our addictions. We want
[1:32:04] to sanctify our guilty pleasures.
[1:32:08] I'm not getting any nods.
[1:32:11] We do. We do. Amen. We say God make it
[1:32:15] better but not God take it away
[1:32:20] cuz what we like doing it too much but
[1:32:22] we know that we ought not to have it.
[1:32:26] So we say Lord what do we do? Lord give
[1:32:29] me balance.
[1:32:32] Church sometimes balance is
[1:32:37] get rid of it.
[1:32:39] Listen, when you look at what God said,
[1:32:41] remember what he'd say. And he'd say,
[1:32:42] "Come down. Sanctify your lives." What
[1:32:44] did he do? He said, "Clean out your
[1:32:46] houses.
[1:32:48] Clean out your lives. Don't store it in
[1:32:51] the garage and then bring it back after
[1:32:53] the sanctification period.
[1:32:55] Get rid of it. Move on so that he can
[1:32:58] put something better in your life."
[1:33:00] Amen.
[1:33:05] Sometimes it just means balance means we
[1:33:06] got to get rid of it. lay it down once
[1:33:08] and for all. Let the fire of God destroy
[1:33:11] it in our lives. Make some room from God
[1:33:14] in our lives. But we got to come to a
[1:33:16] place where we say, "Lord, all I want is
[1:33:18] you." That's what I need more than
[1:33:20] anything. That's what I need more than
[1:33:22] anything. He says, "When you come to
[1:33:24] God, you don't just come on a flowery
[1:33:26] bed of ease. You have to make a
[1:33:28] sacrifice. It's a sacrificial way."
[1:33:30] Church, we're preaching on absolute
[1:33:32] power this morning. Okay? Don't forget
[1:33:33] that. It's he says you have to make a
[1:33:37] sacrifice. It's a sacrificial way. It's
[1:33:39] a way of death. You have to die out to
[1:33:42] come to him. You have to forget all you
[1:33:44] ever knew in order to learn of him. He
[1:33:47] says empty out that he can fill us. He
[1:33:50] says you don't you don't mix it now. You
[1:33:54] can't take what was and what will be.
[1:33:56] You can't take you and God and mix it.
[1:33:58] It doesn't work. It's an absolute. It
[1:34:00] cannot be mixed. Otherwise, it's
[1:34:01] polluted. He says, "You can't don't mix
[1:34:04] it now. You have to empty out. You have
[1:34:08] to let it go. You have to lay it down.
[1:34:10] You have to be able to walk away."
[1:34:12] What's the point I'm trying to make,
[1:34:14] church? We're preaching on absolute
[1:34:15] power. And we say, "Lord, I want
[1:34:16] absolute power, church. What we're
[1:34:18] seeing here is you don't have absolute
[1:34:20] power. Absolute power has to have you."
[1:34:23] That's what we're talking about. I don't
[1:34:25] get absolute power. But whether I do, I
[1:34:27] lay myself down so that absolute power
[1:34:29] can pick me up and work through me.
[1:34:32] That's what absolute power is. Is a
[1:34:34] total surrender and dying out. So that
[1:34:36] the absolute can come into you and work
[1:34:38] through your life. And we won't get
[1:34:40] there to this service, but where you
[1:34:42] speak and it's him speaking, not you.
[1:34:43] You move and it's him moving, not you.
[1:34:47] It is Christ in you working. Absolutely.
[1:34:52] See, it's Christ has you.
[1:34:55] You're in his hands, not him in your
[1:34:57] hands. Amen.
[1:35:02] It's the only way it can work with an
[1:35:03] absolute. Remember what Jesus said. He
[1:35:06] says, "If you abide in me and my words
[1:35:09] abide in you, you shall ask what you
[1:35:10] will and it shall be done unto you."
[1:35:12] Notice where the emphasis is. He says,
[1:35:13] "If you abide in me, I am the primary.
[1:35:16] I'm the ultimate. I am the preeminence."
[1:35:19] Amen. Our identity is lost in his
[1:35:22] identity. We may preach on this someday.
[1:35:23] The power of a name. When you take on a
[1:35:25] name, when Blanca became Blanca Curlet,
[1:35:28] she took on my identity. She took on my
[1:35:30] name. She took on my authority. She took
[1:35:32] on my finances.
[1:35:34] She took on my confidence. She took on
[1:35:36] my love. Everything. That's what she
[1:35:38] bought into. And when we are abiding in
[1:35:41] Christ, we take everything that is his.
[1:35:44] And what do we do? We walk away from
[1:35:45] everything that was ours. That's the
[1:35:47] only way it's going to work. Amen.
[1:35:51] Paul would say it this way. He says,
[1:35:52] "For ye are dead." Ye are dead and your
[1:35:56] life is hid with Christ in God. Amen. So
[1:35:59] when we're coming to this place of the
[1:36:00] new birth of absolute power coming in,
[1:36:03] there's nothing of me left to control
[1:36:05] it. There's nothing of me trying to
[1:36:07] force things a certain way. Church, I
[1:36:09] have a bit of a controlling nature. I
[1:36:11] like things a certain way. And guess
[1:36:14] what? I have to lay that down that
[1:36:16] Christ can work through me. I can be
[1:36:19] very particular, can't I?
[1:36:23] I can. I like things done a certain way,
[1:36:26] but I have to lay that down that Christ
[1:36:30] can work through me.
[1:36:33] He says, "Your life is hid with Christ."
[1:36:35] What is it? We've been clothed upon.
[1:36:38] We've been endued with power from on
[1:36:40] high. It's Christ. It's his own spirit.
[1:36:42] It's his own life.
[1:36:44] Coming back to John 15, he says, "If you
[1:36:46] abide in me, okay, I accepted Jesus as
[1:36:49] my savior, but he says, "And my words
[1:36:51] abide in you." You'll ask what you will
[1:36:53] and it shall be done. How do you know
[1:36:54] you've died out? The word of God has
[1:36:57] preeminence. Now, it's what he thinks,
[1:36:59] not what you think. The word of God is
[1:37:01] his will. It's his thoughts. It's his
[1:37:03] plan. And when you're living by that,
[1:37:06] that's how you know you've died out.
[1:37:08] Because it will be extremely hard on
[1:37:09] this flesh. And you know you've died out
[1:37:12] when you crucify that flesh daily. How?
[1:37:15] By the word of God. Amen. This is a
[1:37:17] total transformation. Body, soul, and
[1:37:20] spirit. Everything now coming under
[1:37:22] subjection to Christ the word. Amen.
[1:37:25] Jesus said, "Then and only then you'll
[1:37:29] ask what you will and it'll be done unto
[1:37:31] you." That's the only way. You have to
[1:37:34] abide in Christ. His word has to abide
[1:37:37] in you. And then what happens? You're
[1:37:39] dead.
[1:37:41] you're dead. And so now it's not my
[1:37:44] desire that comes out. It's his will
[1:37:46] that comes out. It's his word that comes
[1:37:48] out. It's his thought that comes out.
[1:37:50] It's his action that comes out. It's his
[1:37:52] reaction that comes out. So I'm not
[1:37:54] asking for me. I'm asking for him.
[1:37:57] Remember what John said. He said, "If
[1:37:58] you if we ask according to his will, we
[1:38:01] know that he hear us. And we know that
[1:38:03] if he hears us, we'll receive we'll
[1:38:05] receive the petitions that we ask of
[1:38:06] him." See, it's according to his will
[1:38:08] that we have absolute power. That's
[1:38:10] where it is. It's in his will, not in
[1:38:13] our will. It's in his thoughts, not in
[1:38:15] our thoughts. And in his way, not in our
[1:38:17] way. We look up in the upper room and
[1:38:20] they come down. They went up and they're
[1:38:24] crammed up in there. It's hot. It's
[1:38:26] sweaty. They've got religious ideas.
[1:38:29] They've got all sorts of things that
[1:38:30] were going on up there. They went up.
[1:38:32] Unregenerated believers. Children of
[1:38:35] God, yes. believers, yes. Weak in faith,
[1:38:39] prone to mistakes,
[1:38:41] prone to religion,
[1:38:43] prone to self-will, prone to pride,
[1:38:45] prone to arrogance, prone to doing
[1:38:48] things that made them feel good.
[1:38:51] And then what happens? Absolute power
[1:38:53] comes in. A dying out happens over those
[1:38:57] 10 days. And when they come down,
[1:38:59] church, are they doing what they would
[1:39:01] have done before?
[1:39:03] Nope.
[1:39:05] Peter went from fearful to courageous.
[1:39:08] Peter went from just signs and wonders
[1:39:10] to an inspired preacher.
[1:39:12] They come down church and they're
[1:39:14] speaking other languages to other people
[1:39:16] for the purpose of testimony.
[1:39:19] They went up fearful and they came down
[1:39:21] and they couldn't shut up if they tried.
[1:39:24] That's how how much they were under
[1:39:26] absolute power.
[1:39:30] Peter comes down and preaches the sermon
[1:39:31] of his life and 3,000 souls are saved
[1:39:34] like that. 3,000 people filled with the
[1:39:36] spirit in a moment, church.
[1:39:39] Why?
[1:39:41] He's a man under authority now. He's a
[1:39:44] man with absolute power.
[1:39:47] It's not that he has it. It's that it's
[1:39:49] in him. It's working through him. Amen.
[1:39:51] There's a new sheriff in town.
[1:39:53] Peter went up with Peter in control. He
[1:39:55] came down with Almighty God in control.
[1:39:57] That's what absolute power looks like
[1:39:59] this this morning. Amen. So now Peter's
[1:40:01] will doesn't come in. Peter's desires
[1:40:03] doesn't come in. Peter's preferences
[1:40:04] don't come in. And Peter has lost his
[1:40:06] need to live because he's died. He's
[1:40:09] been born again through Christ. It's
[1:40:12] easy to look at Peter and these other
[1:40:14] leaders and say, "Well, they're
[1:40:15] different." No, we're all different.
[1:40:17] We're they're not different. We're all
[1:40:18] the same. We're all born exactly the
[1:40:20] way. We all have the same bumps and
[1:40:22] warts and lumps and issues and faults
[1:40:24] and flaws and failures and
[1:40:25] peculiarities. We've all got to die out.
[1:40:28] We've all got to die out. Amen. We all
[1:40:31] have things that God needs to take care
[1:40:32] of. I love what Paul said in First
[1:40:34] Corinthians,
[1:40:36] Corinthian church, rough church,
[1:40:40] always needing correction,
[1:40:43] but that didn't mean they weren't
[1:40:44] children of God.
[1:40:47] I put this in the different version, and
[1:40:51] I hope you're okay with it. I know I
[1:40:52] preach out of the King James, but
[1:40:53] sometimes we've got newer people here
[1:40:55] and people that haven't been around a
[1:40:56] Bible all their life. So, I put this
[1:40:58] into easier to read just so we can see
[1:41:01] ourselves. He says, "Don't you know that
[1:41:03] wicked people won't inherit God's
[1:41:05] kingdom? Stop deceiving yourselves.
[1:41:07] People who continue to commit sexual
[1:41:09] sins, who worship false gods, those who
[1:41:11] commit adultery, homosexuals or thieves,
[1:41:14] those who are greedy or drunk, who use
[1:41:16] abusive language, who rob people, will
[1:41:18] not inherit God's kingdom." We say,
[1:41:20] "Yeah, that's everybody out there." And
[1:41:22] he says, "That's what some of you were.
[1:41:25] That's what some of you were.
[1:41:28] We don't really like to talk about it,
[1:41:30] but that's what some of us were."
[1:41:33] He says, "But, but is usually the
[1:41:36] devil's language, but here it's God's
[1:41:38] language. He says, "But you have been
[1:41:40] washed and made holy, and you have
[1:41:42] received God's approval in the name of
[1:41:44] the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit
[1:41:47] of our God."
[1:41:49] Listen, we can look at these people and
[1:41:51] say, "Yeah, look how bad they are."
[1:41:54] Church, in God's eyes, Peter went up as
[1:41:56] bad as these people. There is no
[1:41:58] difference whether we're raised in a
[1:42:00] Christian home or whether we're raised
[1:42:01] as a drug addict on the streets with a
[1:42:04] drinking father and a horrible mother.
[1:42:07] It doesn't matter in God's eyes. We are
[1:42:09] all filthy. We all need to be cleaned.
[1:42:12] We all need to be born again. We all
[1:42:13] need to die out.
[1:42:15] And Jesus was saying to the disciples,
[1:42:17] you haven't died out yet.
[1:42:20] You haven't lost yourself that you could
[1:42:22] gain Christ yet.
[1:42:24] And until you do, you cannot be a
[1:42:27] witness. Amen. He says that to be this
[1:42:29] witness, it's going to take more power
[1:42:30] than you've ever had. Because the
[1:42:32] witness is now on is not for somebody
[1:42:34] else. The witness is now in you.
[1:42:37] They went and preached in an
[1:42:38] unregenerated condition. Now they come
[1:42:41] down and what are they proof of, church?
[1:42:42] They're a witness that the gospel works.
[1:42:45] They're a witness that the word is
[1:42:47] fulfilled in a believer. Everything that
[1:42:51] they've been looking forward to, Ezekiel
[1:42:52] 36, a new heart will I put in you, a new
[1:42:54] spirit, and then I'll place my spirit
[1:42:56] within you. Joel 2:28, I'll pour out my
[1:42:58] spirit upon my sons and my daughters and
[1:42:59] all these things. They had perhaps been
[1:43:01] preaching that for hundreds and
[1:43:03] thousands of years. Hundreds of years,
[1:43:05] for sure. Preaching it without any idea
[1:43:08] what it looks like. But he says, "You've
[1:43:10] got to be a witness of the fulfilled
[1:43:12] word before you can preach the fulfilled
[1:43:15] word." That's what it takes. So they
[1:43:18] went up unregenerated. They came down
[1:43:21] manifested word. They came down. Joel
[1:43:23] 2:28. If you wanted to know what Joel
[1:43:26] 228 meant, you just had to look at the
[1:43:28] 120. There it is. They said, "These
[1:43:30] people are drunk." He says, "No, it's
[1:43:32] the word being fulfilled." People look
[1:43:34] at our lives and they say they're crazy.
[1:43:37] We are crazy.
[1:43:40] The way that is heresy is the way that
[1:43:41] we believe. That's what Paul says. We're
[1:43:44] crazy, but it's the word being
[1:43:46] fulfilled.
[1:43:48] You say, "What do you do? Why you do
[1:43:50] this?" It's because there's something in
[1:43:51] me that says the word has to be
[1:43:53] fulfilled. I don't just believe the
[1:43:55] Bible. I am the Bible. That's the
[1:43:58] witness he's looking for is the word in
[1:44:00] flesh. Not just the word coming out of
[1:44:03] my mouth over a pulpit. church, that
[1:44:05] won't change you. But it's a word
[1:44:06] received and come to live in the soul of
[1:44:09] the inner man that'll make you live.
[1:44:11] That'll make this word come alive in
[1:44:13] your life. Amen. You've got to be a
[1:44:15] living proof that the gospel works.
[1:44:20] That's why when we go to people as ley,
[1:44:23] you don't have to go tell people about
[1:44:24] the godhead.
[1:44:27] You don't have to go preach that. Bring
[1:44:28] them to a preacher, he'll preach it. But
[1:44:30] what you can say is, "I know this gospel
[1:44:32] works." That's what your life can say
[1:44:35] from the youngest to the oldest. When
[1:44:36] you received Christ and were baptized
[1:44:38] into the body by the Holy Spirit, you
[1:44:40] have a testimony that this bo this
[1:44:42] gospel works, that Christ is alive and
[1:44:45] well.
[1:44:47] And if you don't have a particular
[1:44:48] testimony and someone else does, say,
[1:44:50] listen, I haven't experienced this yet,
[1:44:52] but so and so has. We haven't maybe all
[1:44:55] had a supernatural healing, but you say,
[1:44:58] "I know somebody that has."
[1:45:02] Oh, we may not have all had to
[1:45:03] experience a marriage that fell apart
[1:45:05] and was restored, but some of us have.
[1:45:08] Whatever it might be, we've got a
[1:45:10] testimony that the gospel works, that
[1:45:12] there is power in the word. And that's
[1:45:15] why we come to church. That's why we
[1:45:17] live the way we do. That's why we talk
[1:45:19] the way we do. It's why we dress the way
[1:45:20] we do. It's why we do the things we do.
[1:45:22] Because it's a living gospel inside of
[1:45:24] us. We see Peter come down. He's finally
[1:45:27] got courage. He's an inspired preacher.
[1:45:29] and he starts to do things he would
[1:45:30] never have done before. One, preach
[1:45:33] publicly after Christ died. Peter didn't
[1:45:35] want anybody to know he was associated
[1:45:37] with Christ. Now he comes down and he's
[1:45:39] going everywhere and preaching. He
[1:45:41] preaches in Jerusalem. Then the Holy
[1:45:43] Spirit comes down, says, "Peter, I'm
[1:45:44] going to send you away." He goes and he
[1:45:46] preaches to the Gentiles, having been
[1:45:48] taught all his life that it was filth to
[1:45:50] go into the home of a Gentile.
[1:45:52] He breaks down his religious barriers.
[1:45:55] Why? Because it's not Peter anymore.
[1:45:57] It's the new sheriff in town. It's
[1:45:58] Christ inside of him getting him to do
[1:46:00] what needs to be done. There's an
[1:46:02] absolute inside of Peter that overrides
[1:46:04] Peter.
[1:46:06] So he preaches to the Gentiles and what
[1:46:09] happens is God gives them the living
[1:46:10] gospel the same way he did Peter. Then
[1:46:13] he goes to the Samaritans.
[1:46:15] Now the Samaritans, if you look at
[1:46:17] history, had desecrated the temple over
[1:46:20] 100 years ago, I think or 75 years
[1:46:21] prior. Peter wasn't around for it, but
[1:46:23] he'd been taught to hate them because of
[1:46:25] the this back and forth that been going
[1:46:26] on for decades. And Peter goes down and
[1:46:29] he preaches to a people that he's
[1:46:30] supposed to hate and God gives him the
[1:46:32] Holy Ghost as well. What is it? Absolute
[1:46:36] power. It's not that Peter has it. It's
[1:46:39] that it has Peter.
[1:46:41] And now Peter is a man under authority.
[1:46:44] Amen. Now we see Peter. Peter once he
[1:46:47] comes down from that upper room church,
[1:46:49] he's lost the desire to lead. He's lost
[1:46:51] the desire to judge. He's lost the
[1:46:54] desire to control. He's lost every bit
[1:46:57] of self here and he's now subject to
[1:47:00] God. That's what happened when he came
[1:47:03] down there. He's a man under authority.
[1:47:05] He's a yielded vessel to the spirit of
[1:47:07] God. That's what absolute power is.
[1:47:10] Yielding, not wielding.
[1:47:14] It's not about me waving the sword. It's
[1:47:16] about him putting it in my hand.
[1:47:19] If he puts it in, he's got a reason for
[1:47:21] me to use it. Amen.
[1:47:24] Peter goes and he heals a man that was
[1:47:26] lame all of his life. Why?
[1:47:30] Not because he had power, because he was
[1:47:32] under power. He was under authority. God
[1:47:36] told him what to do. The spirit of God
[1:47:37] led him to do that. And he heals that
[1:47:39] lame man. Amen. Goes down. He preaches
[1:47:42] to all these different things. And then
[1:47:45] we see Peter come in and he speaks
[1:47:47] judgment on Ananas and Safh.
[1:47:50] and he calls out their lies and their
[1:47:52] hypocrisy and they die at his feet.
[1:47:56] Peter may have had supper and fellowship
[1:47:58] at their house the week before. We don't
[1:48:00] know. They were members of the church,
[1:48:03] but Peter's not in control. Do you think
[1:48:05] Peter wanted Ananas and Safire to die?
[1:48:08] No. But it's not Peter speaking. It's
[1:48:10] the Holy Spirit discerning the
[1:48:12] situation.
[1:48:14] And so he speaks as the spirit leads and
[1:48:17] they fall at his feet dead.
[1:48:21] Peter's under new management now.
[1:48:23] Peter's not the old Peter. Peter now has
[1:48:26] the keys to the kingdom. Amen. You think
[1:48:29] I I think Peter had lots of grandiose
[1:48:31] ideas about what it was going to be. You
[1:48:33] know, I have the keys to the kingdom.
[1:48:37] And what we find is when he finally gets
[1:48:39] them, he doesn't want to use them.
[1:48:42] God's got to get him to use the keys to
[1:48:43] the kingdom because he's fine with the
[1:48:46] Jews, but he doesn't want anything to do
[1:48:48] with the Gentiles. doesn't want anything
[1:48:49] to do with the Samaritans. It takes the
[1:48:51] spirit of God to lead him there and make
[1:48:52] him do something he didn't want to do.
[1:48:56] I find so many times that's the way God
[1:48:57] works is when he really gives us what we
[1:49:01] need, we realize it was a whole lot
[1:49:03] different than we thought it was going
[1:49:04] to be. You ever get into leadership, you
[1:49:07] ever get into ministry, you get into
[1:49:08] serving, you find out it's not all it
[1:49:10] was cracked up to be,
[1:49:12] but you can't help but do it because
[1:49:14] there's something inside you that's
[1:49:16] driving you. Amen.
[1:49:19] close with two quotes.
[1:49:22] Paul said, "When I am weak, then I am
[1:49:24] strong." He says, "Yes," he said, "I
[1:49:27] will glory in my infirmities and my
[1:49:28] weaknesses and so forth. I'm thanking
[1:49:31] God that I got all it out of me, and
[1:49:33] when I get everything out of me, then
[1:49:35] God can come in. But as long as I have
[1:49:37] some of myself there, then God can't get
[1:49:40] in." He says there, that's it. We
[1:49:43] smother him out. We drive him away from
[1:49:47] the poorest of us to the richest of us,
[1:49:49] from the least to the greatest. We keep
[1:49:51] God out of our lives because of our own
[1:49:54] selves.
[1:49:58] We say we want absolute power.
[1:50:01] What does it look like?
[1:50:03] It's not receiving as much as it is
[1:50:05] giving away,
[1:50:07] laying it down, and letting it go. He
[1:50:10] says that I've often said the greatest
[1:50:12] enemy I have is myself. He's the one
[1:50:15] that gets in God's way. He's the one
[1:50:17] that gets lazy. He's the one that gets
[1:50:20] to a place sometimes where he thinks he
[1:50:22] can do something about it. And when he
[1:50:24] does, that shoves God right out of the
[1:50:27] picture. Let me tell you, that is the
[1:50:29] absolute truth this morning.
[1:50:31] As a minister, as a pastor, so many
[1:50:34] times my natural inclination is to get
[1:50:36] in there and hit that nail while it's
[1:50:38] just starting to stick up a bit. But
[1:50:41] guess what?
[1:50:42] That's not always God's way.
[1:50:45] Sometimes that nail's got to come
[1:50:46] completely out
[1:50:48] to show what's going on underneath.
[1:50:51] Sometimes it's got to be quick and fast.
[1:50:53] Sometimes there's real danger. But
[1:50:55] sometimes God's working with his
[1:50:57] children and I've got to just take my
[1:50:58] hands off and say, "You're the great
[1:51:00] shepherd.
[1:51:02] I'm just one of your servants."
[1:51:05] But what do we do? We want to jump in.
[1:51:08] We think we see the reason. We think we
[1:51:10] see the way to get out of it. And we
[1:51:12] say, "I'm going to go do it." Sons of
[1:51:15] God are led.
[1:51:17] You'll see with absolute power is it is
[1:51:19] not you leading. It is you being led.
[1:51:23] It is you following, not you showing the
[1:51:25] way.
[1:51:27] It is you obeying, not giving the
[1:51:28] orders. See, absolute power, it's like
[1:51:31] ministry. You're on the bottom, not on
[1:51:33] the top. And it's Christ that's doing
[1:51:36] everything through you.
[1:51:37] He says, "But when I can get rid of that
[1:51:39] guy," church, this is a prophet of God
[1:51:41] saying, "When I can get rid of that guy,
[1:51:44] when I can get rid of that guy, when I
[1:51:46] can get to a place that he is out of the
[1:51:48] way, then God could come in and do
[1:51:50] things that I know nothing about." We
[1:51:53] are so limited in our knowledge, in our
[1:51:56] understanding, in our perception. And it
[1:51:58] takes the Holy Spirit to give us any
[1:52:00] hope of getting anything right. As
[1:52:02] people, we are so complex. Our
[1:52:04] relationships are complex. our humanity,
[1:52:06] our families, our marriages, everything
[1:52:08] is so complex. And we can look at people
[1:52:10] and we can put them in a box and we can
[1:52:12] say, "Well, this is their issue or
[1:52:13] that's their issue and here's what they
[1:52:14] need to do." Church, it takes God to go
[1:52:17] in and dig into those things.
[1:52:21] He says, "That's when God can use you.
[1:52:23] That's when he can use any of you." He's
[1:52:28] not just talking about prophets and
[1:52:30] five-fold ministry. He's saying this
[1:52:32] goes for every single one of us. He says
[1:52:34] he can use anybody when we get out of
[1:52:38] the way, but as long as we have
[1:52:40] ourselves in the way, then we cannot.
[1:52:43] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand.
[1:52:48] I'm leaving us on a cliffhanger
[1:52:52] cuz I've talked about how we get it,
[1:53:00] but we got to see how it works now.
[1:53:04] Because if we look through this lens of
[1:53:05] us wielding power,
[1:53:08] then we're going to get it wrong every
[1:53:10] time.
[1:53:11] But if we see it's us yielding to power,
[1:53:14] we'll get it right every time. Man takes
[1:53:17] a new birth, a new creation in Christ
[1:53:19] for this to do anything. And then I love
[1:53:22] how John said it. I must decrease so he
[1:53:24] must so he can increase. That's what
[1:53:26] absolute power looks like is getting me
[1:53:28] out of the way so that an absolute can
[1:53:30] come in and do the work. Amen. We have
[1:53:32] to die so we can live. We have to stop
[1:53:34] so he can start. We have to lay it down
[1:53:37] so he can pick us up. It's all got to be
[1:53:40] him from start to finish. Church, God's
[1:53:42] not looking for good people.
[1:53:45] God's looking for people that will die
[1:53:47] out. He'll make us good. He'll make us
[1:53:51] good. See, too often we're trying to
[1:53:52] come to God and say, "This is what I've
[1:53:54] got for you, God." Rather than saying,
[1:53:56] "God, here I am. Do with me what you
[1:53:58] want." He'll make us as good as he needs
[1:54:00] us to make us. He'll make us as gifted
[1:54:02] as he needs us to make to be all those
[1:54:04] things. That's what he does. Our purpose
[1:54:06] is to come in and say, "Lord, I'm here.
[1:54:10] Lord, I'm yielded. Lord, I'm ready.
[1:54:13] Lord, I surrender. Lord, I lay it all
[1:54:16] down." That's the key to absolute power.
[1:54:19] Humbling yourself before God and say,
[1:54:21] "Lord, everything I have, I'm going to
[1:54:23] lay it aside and let you pick it up and
[1:54:24] use me if you want, when you want, where
[1:54:28] you want, and how you want." Amen. God
[1:54:31] bless you. Let's bow our heads, Lord
[1:54:33] Jesus.
[1:54:36] Lord, certainly we know that the way up
[1:54:37] is to go down,
[1:54:40] Lord, that a life that can humble itself
[1:54:42] before your word, before your purpose,
[1:54:45] Lord, that can wait on you and for the
[1:54:47] promise of your word, Lord, that's a
[1:54:49] person you can use. And Lord, as we're
[1:54:52] coming to the close of another service,
[1:54:54] Lord, as we're coming soon to a close on
[1:54:56] this series on a Holy Ghost life, Lord,
[1:54:59] I pray we come out the other side with a
[1:55:00] greater Lord, not just a greater
[1:55:02] understanding, but a greater reality of
[1:55:05] what it means to live by the Holy
[1:55:07] Spirit.
[1:55:09] Lord, that we'd not just have a
[1:55:10] religion, Lord, a churchity,
[1:55:13] Lord, just a facade, Lord, but that we'd
[1:55:16] have an anchor of our soul, Lord. A firm
[1:55:18] foundation, something that keeps us
[1:55:20] through the trials and temptations of
[1:55:22] life, Lord. Something that gives us
[1:55:24] direction, that gives us an uncction,
[1:55:26] Lord, that shows us when to speak and
[1:55:28] when to be quiet, when to act and stand
[1:55:30] still, Lord. something that just holds
[1:55:33] us in assurance and faith and rest day
[1:55:36] in and day out.
[1:55:38] Lord, I don't want to do anything unless
[1:55:40] it's your will. Lord, I don't want to
[1:55:42] walk unless it's your way, your time,
[1:55:45] your season,
[1:55:47] Lord. And so, we look to you. We're
[1:55:50] trusting you, Lord, asking you to take a
[1:55:53] hold of our lives, Lord. Not just while
[1:55:56] we sit here and nod our heads at your
[1:55:57] word and say amen, Lord, but let our
[1:55:59] lives be an amen that says, "Be it unto
[1:56:01] me according to your word." Grant us
[1:56:04] grace, Lord, to die out daily, to
[1:56:06] surrender, Lord, to let go, to let go of
[1:56:09] these controlling natures that we have,
[1:56:12] Lord, and let you take full control in
[1:56:13] our lives. We pray, Lord. Let you be the
[1:56:16] absolute,
[1:56:18] Lord, for that's where the results come,
[1:56:20] Lord. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And
[1:56:24] amen.
[1:56:27] More of you. More of you. 759.
[1:56:33] More of you.
[1:56:40] More of you.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:46] Well, I've had it all.

[1:57:56] is more

[2:04:35] This is my daily bread.
[2:04:42] This is my daily bread.
[2:04:49] Your very

[2:04:55] spoken
[2:04:58] to me.

[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:09] I'm desperate for you.

[2:05:39] I'm desperate for you.

[2:06:35] This is my daily bread.
[2:06:42] This is my daily bread.
[2:06:48] Your very

[2:08:21] I'm lost without you.
[2:08:27] Pour your spirit out on me. 12:21
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:33] sometimes the issue is
[2:08:37] we're not desperate,
[2:08:40] satisfied.
[2:08:42] It's okay to be satisfied. There are
[2:08:44] times of satisfaction and contentment.
[2:08:47] But when we've lost the hunger,
[2:08:50] Amen. Every day there ought to be a
[2:08:52] hunger, a draw, a pull.
[2:08:57] Sometimes when we lose that, that's when
[2:09:00] we really need to get desperate because
[2:09:01] we've lost the feeling of our need.
[2:09:04] We've gotten so used
[2:09:07] to being the way we are.
[2:09:09] Amen. That's when we need him to pour
[2:09:12] his spirit out and then find those dry
[2:09:14] and broken places.
[2:09:17] I remember the first time I went to
[2:09:20] Phoenix
[2:09:21] to visit my girlfriend, now wife,
[2:09:25] and it sucked every bit of moisture out
[2:09:27] of my life.
[2:09:30] Skin was flaking off. I looked like I
[2:09:32] was shedding.
[2:09:34] But I found an answer. Moisturizing
[2:09:37] lotion.
[2:09:39] I still had life in me, but there were
[2:09:42] cracks appearing. Amen. Being cold
[2:09:45] doesn't mean you're not a child of God.
[2:09:47] Being dry doesn't mean you're not a
[2:09:48] child of God, but it means you need a
[2:09:51] refreshing. Amen. We need a refreshing
[2:09:54] every single day, church. A refreshing
[2:09:56] in the power of the spirit in our life.
[2:10:00] That when we read his word, something
[2:10:01] says, "That's me. That's for me. That's
[2:10:04] mine. That's mine for today. That's mine
[2:10:07] for tomorrow. That's mine for this
[2:10:09] trial. That's mine for this situation."
[2:10:11] And then what we do? We wrap ourselves
[2:10:13] in that bomb of Gilead. We're endued
[2:10:17] with power for our situation, for our
[2:10:19] life, for what's going on.
[2:10:22] I want to encourage you this afternoon
[2:10:24] before we close. Wrap yourselves in the
[2:10:27] presence of Jesus Christ this morning.
[2:10:30] I trust there's something on the inside,
[2:10:32] but something we need a topical
[2:10:33] application
[2:10:35] to make us smile again,
[2:10:38] give us a happy face, a countenance that
[2:10:40] people want to be around. Amen. I don't
[2:10:42] want to look like I drank prune juice
[2:10:44] every day. Amen. I want to have the joy
[2:10:47] of the Lord. I want to be able to give a
[2:10:49] smile to people that go by that they
[2:10:51] know that I've got something that they
[2:10:52] can get to, something worth having.
[2:10:54] Amen. Let's sing this. If you're not,
[2:10:59] if you're in a good place, praise the
[2:11:01] Lord. Sing it for somebody else.
[2:11:05] Sing it for somebody else. You know, I
[2:11:07] I've always I've said this since I gave
[2:11:09] my heart to the Lord. Youth camps don't
[2:11:11] do much for me because the preaching
[2:11:12] they preach is not that's not
[2:11:13] applicable, but it's for them where
[2:11:14] they're at. But we've got to be there to
[2:11:16] set an atmosphere for those births.
[2:11:19] We need to set an atmosphere of
[2:11:20] refreshing. We need to show people what
[2:11:22] it looks like to be free in the Holy
[2:11:24] Spirit, to know what it's like to come
[2:11:26] in and enjoy not church, but enjoy
[2:11:29] Christ, the word to its fullness.
[2:11:32] Amen. So, don't hold back if you're
[2:11:35] satisfied.
[2:11:36] That's when we ought to give him
[2:11:38] worship, praise. But if you're dry this
[2:11:42] morning, say, "Lord, I need you. Lord,
[2:11:45] I'm seeking you.
[2:11:48] Lord, just fill in the cracks and the
[2:11:50] dryness.
[2:11:52] Make me pliable. Make me usable again.
[2:11:54] Make me resilient again. Make me useful
[2:11:57] to your kingdom again." Amen. Let's sing
[2:12:00] this if we would.
[2:12:05] So Lord, I seek you.
[2:12:10] Help me find you.
[2:12:13] How I need your touch.
[2:12:20] So find my
[2:12:28] thirsty for your love.
[2:12:35] Lord forgive me
[2:12:39] if I wondered
[2:12:43] far away from you.
[2:12:50] You are all I
[2:12:54] ever needed.
[2:12:58] Come and make me new.
[2:13:03] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:13:08] Fall just like the rain.
[2:13:22] Fill my cup again.
[2:13:27] Heal my heart and make me whole.
[2:13:34] I need you now. Pour your spirit out.
[2:13:42] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:13:46] Fall just like the rain.
[2:13:51] Saturate
[2:13:53] my thirsty soul.
[2:13:56] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:14:01] Fill my cup again.
[2:14:06] Heal my heart and make me whole.
[2:14:13] I need you now. Pour your spirit out.
[2:14:24] Lord, I seek you.
[2:14:28] Help me find you.
[2:14:31] How I need your touch.
[2:14:38] Find my dry and
[2:14:42] broken places
[2:14:46] thirsting for your love.
[2:14:53] Lord forgive me
[2:14:57] if I wondered
[2:15:00] far away from you.
[2:15:08] You are all I
[2:15:11] ever needed.
[2:15:15] Come and make me new.
[2:15:20] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:15:25] God, just like the rain,
[2:15:30] saturate
[2:15:32] my thirsty soul.
[2:15:35] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:15:40] Fill my cup again.
[2:15:44] Heal my heart and make me whole.
[2:15:52] I need you now. Pour your spirit out.
[2:15:59] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:16:11] Mercy soul.
[2:16:13] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:16:18] Fill my cup again.
[2:16:22] Heal my heart and make me whole.
[2:16:30] I need you now. Pour your spirit out and
[2:16:37] pour your spirit out on me.
[2:16:42] Fall just like the rain.
[2:16:47] Saturate
[2:16:49] my thirsty soul.
[2:16:52] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:16:57] Fill my cup again.
[2:17:02] Heal my heart
[2:17:05] and make me whole.
[2:17:10] I need you now.
[2:17:14] Pour your spirit
[2:17:17] out.
[2:17:18] [Music]
[2:17:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:17:22] Amen. God bless you. We're going to
[2:17:24] close in a word of prayer. We're going
[2:17:25] to sing that song, He is able, more than
[2:17:27] able. 7:21.
[2:17:30] Amen.
[2:17:32] Brother Bob, are you willing to come up
[2:17:34] and pray for us to close?

[2:17:38] we'll have you come up and close in
[2:17:40] prayer. Amen. He's able. He's able.
[2:17:48] And He is aable.
[2:17:51] More
[2:17:53] than able
[2:17:57] to accomplish what concerns
[2:18:01] me today.

[2:20:05] It's truly a privilege to to be here
[2:20:09] with God's chosen elected bride.
[2:20:15] I bring greetings from those that have
[2:20:17] been here before, the folks and the

[2:20:25] want to bless you.
[2:20:29] I just thank the Lord that
[2:20:33] he has raised up a people
[2:20:37] like you.
[2:20:39] It's wonderful that we can come from
[2:20:42] across the continent
[2:20:45] and feel right at home
[2:20:48] knowing Lord
[2:20:51] has done the same work in your lives as
