[42:25] we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[42:30] and God bless you thank you musicians if
[42:32] you would turn to First Timothy chapter
[42:34] one
[42:35] First Timothy chapter one we'll start at
[42:37] verse 18.
[42:39] certainly want to give thanks to
[42:41] everyone that kind of made the services
[42:43] this weekend to success and you know
[42:46] it's uh it's one thing to come in and
[42:48] enjoy it but there's a lot of work went
[42:49] into that week especially beforehand
[42:51] mother Matt was here with the trustees
[42:53] and wiring things and putting up the new
[42:56] TVs and screens and whatnot and I know
[42:59] the trustees were here touching off this
[43:01] and that and their spouses as well
[43:03] amen so everyone was doing it and then
[43:05] we had sister Priscilla and Blanca
[43:08] preparing the children and the the
[43:09] specials and these different things and
[43:11] then the sisters with the food and
[43:12] whatnot so it's it's a body effort and
[43:15] it's a body effort and I'm so thankful
[43:17] for each one that put their shoulder to
[43:20] the wheel
[43:21] Amen brother Dwayne and sister Connie
[43:22] got back about 4 a.m last night with an
[43:25] uneventful trip quick trip relatively
[43:27] speaking so you he's back in the saddle
[43:29] there but he said
[43:31] share his love and appreciation to the
[43:33] people and he certainly enjoyed himself
[43:35] and he's looking forward to coming back
[43:37] again sometime remember the Kingsley is
[43:39] also traveling to Nigeria today he was
[43:41] kind of getting things set in order this
[43:43] weekend so he could fly back to spend
[43:45] some time with his wife and deal with
[43:47] some things over there so we want to
[43:49] remember him in prayer as well and of
[43:51] course it doesn't look like brother
[43:52] Gerald's sister Betty are here so
[43:53] certainly she's especially on our hearts
[43:56] and Minds this evening and into tomorrow
[43:58] so
[43:58] let's be praying for them amen certainly
[44:01] appreciate the services
[44:03] amen I thought it was just absolutely
[44:04] Supernatural in so many ways for for me
[44:07] and the different needs and the body and
[44:09] talking to different ones afterwards and
[44:11] they said that was me he was talking to
[44:13] there you know and that I was praying
[44:15] about that and I was struggling with
[44:16] that and I was wondering about that and
[44:18] and whatnot so I just thought it was
[44:20] absolutely tremendous amen amen you can
[44:23] you can have a service where it's all
[44:25] you know It's Shouting and it's praise
[44:26] and it's worship and then sometimes it's
[44:28] just that still Small Voice just
[44:30] speaking to you and it's all God it's
[44:32] all God sometimes he's in the Thunder
[44:33] and the lightning and the smoke and the
[44:35] fire and other times he's just like I
[44:37] talked about he's just sitting next to
[44:39] you in the pew
[44:40] just saying hello daughter hello son
[44:42] we got some things to talk about him and
[44:44] so I certainly appreciated that and
[44:46] appreciate it brother Dwayne coming in
[44:48] on his 36th wedding anniversary and
[44:50] putting his shoulder to the wheel like
[44:52] that so God bless him amen First Timothy
[44:55] chapter 1 verse 18.
[44:57] it says Paul speaking to Timothy he says
[44:59] this charge I commit unto thee son
[45:01] Timothy according to the prophecies
[45:03] which went before on thee that thou by
[45:06] them might as War a good Warfare holding
[45:09] faith and a good conscience which some
[45:12] having put away concerning Faith have
[45:15] made shipwreck amen God bless you you
[45:17] can have your seats this evening and
[45:19] we're back to our Redemption series and
[45:21] we're building up to this idea of
[45:22] adoption and I know we say we're going
[45:23] to get there and it seems like every
[45:25] service I want to get there and
[45:26] something else kind of drops in so I
[45:29] want to set a bit of a picture before we
[45:31] go into adoption and for a title tonight
[45:33] I just want to preach on the good fight
[45:34] and then the good fight and when we last
[45:37] preached on Redemption many weeks ago it
[45:39] feels like we stopped right after the
[45:41] children of Israel had crossed over and
[45:42] they've been circumcised and these
[45:44] different things and they were preparing
[45:45] to go in and they were preparing to go
[45:47] in and take possession and they were
[45:49] going in with a lot of knowledge
[45:50] if you think about it they'd spent 40
[45:52] years hearing about it and hearing the
[45:54] testimonies of of the ones that had gone
[45:56] in and been close to it and had actually
[45:57] seen it and all these different things
[45:59] but they're going in with knowledge but
[46:01] not a lot of experience they weren't
[46:02] going in as as seasoned Warriors or
[46:04] anything like that they they had an idea
[46:06] of what they were facing but they didn't
[46:08] have a reality of what they were going
[46:09] to be facing and and so I want to take
[46:11] this idea of the good fight because when
[46:13] we're going into battle we we have to
[46:15] have something more than just knowledge
[46:17] and then we got to have something
[46:18] greater than knowledge and certainly the
[46:20] greatest thing we can have is revelation
[46:22] amen but but but you've got to go in
[46:24] prepared and you've got to go in ready
[46:26] for the fight and you've got to make
[46:27] sure you're fighting the good fight
[46:28] you've got to make sure you're fighting
[46:29] the right fight that you're focusing
[46:31] your energy and you're pointing the
[46:32] sword at the right thing if I could put
[46:33] it that way and that that what's in your
[46:36] heart to get is going to be in line with
[46:38] what God Said So I've read the scripture
[46:40] before but it's used in so many ways in
[46:43] this Redemption series but God said to
[46:45] Moses he said and I have said I will
[46:47] bring you up out of the Affliction of
[46:48] Egypt into the land of the Canaanites
[46:50] and the Hittites and the amorites and
[46:52] the parasites and the hivites and the
[46:54] jebusites onto a land flowing with milk
[46:56] and honey and we've talked about this
[46:58] before how it's a land of promise and
[47:00] it's a land full of promise but it's
[47:02] also a land full of enemies it's a land
[47:04] full of people that don't like you it's
[47:05] a land full of of people that don't want
[47:07] you there a land full of people that
[47:09] want to kill you and yet it is still the
[47:11] land of promise Amen to what's on it is
[47:14] not reflective of what it's meant for
[47:15] and so often we get stuck on what's
[47:17] guarding it rather than what is what's
[47:19] in it for us you know and you have to be
[47:21] able to see beyond those things and just
[47:23] because something has it right now
[47:25] doesn't mean that it's not yours to take
[47:26] if God said it's yours then it's yours
[47:28] amen and that we've got to get our
[47:30] Direction though from the word so that
[47:31] we're fighting for the things that to
[47:33] belong to us amen and if you look at
[47:35] something like this and and you look
[47:37] down that list and you've got Canaanites
[47:39] and Hittites and amorites and parasites
[47:40] and headlights and jebusites you got you
[47:43] got six nations in there and if you
[47:45] focus on what's waiting for you you're
[47:46] going to struggle
[47:47] if you focus on what's on the other side
[47:50] of what's of what's holding on to your
[47:52] promise right now of what's on your
[47:53] property of what's what what Satan has
[47:55] laid in your path to keep you from
[47:57] getting what you're going to get you're
[47:59] going to struggle because your focus is
[48:00] on what's waiting for you rather than
[48:02] what is promised to you amen what
[48:04] belongs to you if you're focused on the
[48:06] enemy then you're going to get into
[48:08] trouble every single time but you have
[48:10] to realize this is that he said I will
[48:12] bring you up
[48:13] I'll bring you to the land what he was
[48:15] saying is I'll bring you to the fight
[48:18] so if you're in the fight of his leading
[48:20] and not your own you can have confidence
[48:22] amen you don't have to wonder about the
[48:24] outcome you don't have to worry about
[48:25] what's going to happen if he has led you
[48:27] to the place of battle then you can have
[48:29] confidence that you're going to go
[48:31] through no matter what comes against you
[48:32] amen but if you come of your own
[48:35] choosing if you come of your own time if
[48:37] you come of your own way you're going to
[48:38] fail because remember God tried to get
[48:40] them to go into Canaan and they refused
[48:43] and then he pronounced judgment on them
[48:45] and they said well now we're going to go
[48:46] in
[48:47] now that you pronounce judgment we're
[48:49] going to go and we're going to take the
[48:50] the land and what happened is they went
[48:52] in and a bunch of them died because God
[48:54] wasn't with them they refused his time
[48:56] they refused his season they refused his
[48:58] word and then they tried to do
[48:59] themselves and they all died they picked
[49:02] a fight now of their own choosing and
[49:03] God said don't go in there it'll be dead
[49:05] it'll be horrible for you and they went
[49:07] in your but God is saying here I'm going
[49:09] to bring you to a place full of people
[49:11] that want to kill you and it's my will
[49:13] that you go in and it's my will that you
[49:15] fight and it's my will that you overcome
[49:17] as well
[49:18] amen there's going to be a battle but
[49:20] it's my will you've waited over 400
[49:22] years closer to 500 years to get here
[49:24] and it doesn't look like it's much of a
[49:26] Promised Land but believe me when I'm
[49:28] done with you you're going to be the
[49:29] Overcomer and you're going to have
[49:30] everything that I promised you inside of
[49:32] that land amen
[49:33] in Exodus 23 says behold I send an angel
[49:36] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[49:39] to bring thee into the place which I
[49:41] have prepared
[49:42] you know what I read when I see that
[49:43] there's no excuse not to get there
[49:46] the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud
[49:48] went in front of them every day and as
[49:50] long as they stayed with the pillar of
[49:52] fire as long as they stay with the
[49:54] pillow Cloud then they were going to be
[49:55] okay and they could have confidence no
[49:57] matter what they were facing or where
[49:59] they were being led whether it was a dry
[50:01] place a well-watered place lots of grass
[50:03] no grass whatever it was lots of enemies
[50:05] no enemies it did not matter as long as
[50:07] they were following that pillar of cloud
[50:09] that pillar fired then they knew they
[50:11] were in God's will
[50:12] verse 21 says beware of him and obey his
[50:15] voice provoke him not for he will not
[50:17] pardon your transgressions for my name
[50:20] is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[50:23] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[50:26] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[50:29] an adversary unto thine adversaries
[50:31] that's why I said if you're in a fight
[50:33] of your own making you need to back out
[50:36] because he said if I take you there
[50:39] then I'll be with you but if you go of
[50:42] your own choosing your own way you're in
[50:44] a fight of your own making guess what
[50:45] God can't help you
[50:47] he'll take you out he'll preserve you
[50:49] but you won't win a battle that you're
[50:50] in of your own choosing you make a bad
[50:52] decision you make a wrong decision you
[50:54] go against the word of God and you get
[50:56] into a fight guess what God's not there
[50:57] to give you the victory God's there at
[50:59] best to preserve your life
[51:01] not your dignity not your reputation
[51:03] he'll preserve your life because you're
[51:05] a son and daughter of God look what
[51:06] happened with Abraham the the two times
[51:09] that he went into the land of the
[51:10] Philistines and these different things
[51:11] and the King saw in garage and whatnot
[51:13] and he did not give Abraham a victory
[51:16] there but he preserved his life
[51:18] he kept his promise he kept the vessels
[51:21] of his promise through it all but
[51:22] Abraham didn't go in and get a victory
[51:24] in fact he really annoyed them
[51:26] Abraham lost face Abraham lost
[51:28] reputation when he went someplace of his
[51:30] own choosing God protected him but God
[51:32] did not give him a victory there amen
[51:33] we've got to find the will of God and
[51:36] that's what gives us confidence Faith
[51:38] gives us faith is really what it is he
[51:39] gives us confidence in his faith that
[51:41] we're walking where he wants us to be
[51:44] verse 23 says for mine Angel shall go
[51:46] before thee and bring thee into the
[51:48] amorites and the Hittites and the
[51:49] parasites and the Canaanites and the
[51:51] hivites and the jebusites and I will cut
[51:53] them off
[51:55] listen it's not us that does the winning
[51:58] it's not us that wins the battle but
[52:00] we're going to be in the battle but he
[52:01] says I'm the one that's going to do the
[52:03] work
[52:04] it's going to look like you're doing it
[52:06] but I'm the one that's going to cut them
[52:07] off I am going to completely obliterate
[52:09] them from the face of this Earth it will
[52:11] be as if they never existed in the first
[52:13] place but it's going to look an awful
[52:15] lot like battle to you when you're in
[52:16] these things he says I will cut them off
[52:19] I'll cut them off listen we can focus on
[52:22] on what we choose to this evening we can
[52:25] focus on the amorites and the Hittites
[52:27] and the parasites and the Canaanites and
[52:28] the hivites and the jebusites and it'll
[52:30] tear our faith down and it'll make us
[52:32] wimps or we can focus focus on where God
[52:35] said and I will cut them off amen that
[52:38] I'm in it that I'm with you and I'm
[52:40] going to take you through I'd rather
[52:41] focus on that than on the six kingdoms
[52:43] before me on the things that are laying
[52:45] in front of me the enemies that want to
[52:46] take my life
[52:49] what a Revival it would be if we'd focus
[52:51] on what God said he was going to do
[52:52] rather than what Satan has laid before
[52:54] us Amen Let us look to the promise let
[52:57] us hold fast to what God said he would
[52:58] do in these situations he said I will
[53:01] send my fear before thee
[53:04] not a fear of you
[53:06] they might think they're scared of you
[53:08] but he says it's my fear that goes
[53:09] before me I'm going to put something in
[53:11] their heart that's going to win The
[53:12] Battle Before you ever get there they're
[53:14] going to be scared of you before you
[53:15] even cross swords before you ever throw
[53:17] a spear before you ever walk up to the
[53:19] gates they're going to be scared and the
[53:21] battles won when the enemy is scared if
[53:23] you have no confidence in yourself then
[53:25] the other person wins no matter how weak
[53:26] they are because you're not going to
[53:28] think you can fight and you'll fight
[53:29] like you think
[53:30] you'll fight like you believe and if you
[53:32] don't think you can win you'll never win
[53:34] but he says I'm going to send my fear
[53:36] before you and I'm gonna I'm going to
[53:38] destroy all the people to whom thou
[53:40] shall come and I will make all thine
[53:42] enemies turn their backs into these
[53:44] things unto thee
[53:46] in that church when things start to
[53:48] break apart in front of us don't think
[53:50] it's because of us
[53:51] you know we I remember we had that old
[53:54] movie The Bear I think it was called or
[53:55] something it's a little little bear
[53:57] company standing there and there's a
[53:58] cougar coming towards him over the river
[54:00] and he opens his mouth and he's gonna
[54:02] he's Gonna Roar and this great Roar
[54:04] comes out and the cougar turns and runs
[54:06] away and the Bears all proud of himself
[54:08] and then the camera pans and behind him
[54:10] is the Big Mama Bear the big papa bear
[54:12] that really made the sound that's what's
[54:14] happening in these situations is they
[54:17] might flee from before us but it's Papa
[54:18] God that's behind us that's producing
[54:21] the results amen amen we do not strive
[54:23] we do not put our faith in the arm of
[54:25] Flesh amen but we look to the god that
[54:28] has anointed us to do these things amen
[54:30] if we win when we win
[54:33] when we win not if we win when we win
[54:35] it's because God has gone before us and
[54:37] he has put fear and he's driven them out
[54:39] and he's the one that has destroyed
[54:41] what's going on in them amen listen
[54:42] perfect love casts out our fear and it
[54:45] goes ahead of us and puts it into those
[54:47] that would hold us back amen
[54:49] what is it he's telling us don't worry
[54:50] son
[54:51] don't worry daughter I brought you here
[54:53] and I'm going to bring you through this
[54:55] amen I'll take you through if you only
[54:57] knew how scared Satan is that you'll
[54:59] find out who you are you'd have a whole
[55:01] lot more courage tonight you'd have a
[55:03] lot more faith tonight your Revelation
[55:04] would come to a new level because he's
[55:06] scared brother Brown said that the
[55:08] weakest Christian when he falls to his
[55:11] knees all of Satan all of hell trembles
[55:14] that's how powerful you are when you go
[55:16] to the god that can put fear Into the
[55:18] Heart of the enemy amen
[55:20] he says and I will send Hornets before
[55:22] thee which shall drive out the himite
[55:23] the Canaanite the hittite from before
[55:25] thee but he says I will not drive them
[55:28] out from before thee in one year lest
[55:30] the lamb become desolate and the beasts
[55:32] of the field multiply against thee
[55:34] listen the reality
[55:36] of the promised land was Progressive
[55:40] they crossed Jordan they were in the
[55:42] land but to actually take possession and
[55:45] benefit from it did not happen overnight
[55:47] they entered in overnight they entered
[55:49] in one afternoon but to actually take
[55:51] possession of it and get the benefits of
[55:53] it was Progressive and God said bit by
[55:56] bit
[55:57] little by little I'm gonna drive them
[55:59] out you're going to come into possession
[56:01] just a little bit at a time he says
[56:02] because you've got to be able to hold on
[56:04] to what I've given you before you take
[56:06] the next bit otherwise it doesn't
[56:08] produce and you don't hold on to these
[56:10] things amen listen the Rapture is
[56:12] Progressive
[56:14] the Rapture is Progressive what's
[56:16] happening is God's doing what precept
[56:18] upon precept line upon line he's
[56:20] building up a church in The Most Holy
[56:22] Faith and he's building this up to the
[56:24] Apex which is a resurrection and a
[56:26] Rapture but if you're waiting for
[56:28] everything to happen until the Rapture
[56:30] you're going to miss the Rapture because
[56:32] it's little by little he's building us
[56:34] up into it he's giving us the promise
[56:36] and that's why we had a prophet coming
[56:38] to say not just to open the word but to
[56:40] show us what it looks like to possess it
[56:42] to be a part of it and it was that
[56:44] Divine Healing it was that discernment
[56:46] it was that Holy Ghost leadership it was
[56:48] overcoming power it was the adoption of
[56:50] Sons and Daughters of God all of that
[56:53] combined is what brings us to a
[56:54] rapturing point the last step is what
[56:57] death where uh death was a nice thing
[57:01] grave where's thy victory in these
[57:03] things that's the last thing we're going
[57:04] to face but until then we're getting
[57:06] little Victory and then bigger victories
[57:08] and bigger victories and one thing
[57:10] tumbles and falls and then the next
[57:11] thing does and the next thing does we're
[57:14] not just gonna maybe one day we're going
[57:15] to be just an a good for nothing loud
[57:17] and the next day where the manifested
[57:19] sons of God he's training us and he's
[57:21] growing us and he's building us bit by
[57:23] bit
[57:24] you know don't don't look down on the
[57:27] day of the Small Things the little
[57:28] victories the little Revelations the
[57:30] little things that God does in our life
[57:32] because they're building a big picture
[57:33] they're building you into a son and
[57:35] daughter of God Amen but overcoming
[57:38] power is there all along
[57:40] overcoming Powers all along whether
[57:42] you're going around Jericho which had
[57:44] never been taken or whether you're in
[57:46] these little towns that are just
[57:47] surrounded by a bit of sticks
[57:49] all of it is overcoming powers given to
[57:51] you if God's leading you through these
[57:53] things amen
[57:55] we spoke in the in the last service on
[57:57] this this idea of expectation in the
[58:00] land of the living and now the word of
[58:02] of God is promises for Here and Now
[58:05] there's very little we know about what's
[58:07] going to happen on the other side when
[58:09] we're an attorney we don't know a whole
[58:10] lot it's it's just generally descriptive
[58:12] but most of it is focused on what we're
[58:14] facing here and what we're going through
[58:16] life here
[58:17] and sometimes we we want to see God and
[58:20] we say well if God's going to take me
[58:22] somewhere it's going to be Supernatural
[58:24] and it is
[58:25] this is a supernatural walk listen I
[58:28] don't know if the prophet said it but
[58:30] I've heard it many times he says we are
[58:31] a supernatural people having a natural
[58:33] experience
[58:34] we're a supernatural people we are the
[58:36] children of a supernatural God and we
[58:39] look and and we say that if God is with
[58:41] us everything must appear Supernatural
[58:43] is what we're really saying and
[58:45] sometimes it is you look at you know
[58:46] Blanca with her gallbladder trouble and
[58:48] that went away in a moment that was
[58:50] literally Supernatural in the way that
[58:52] we expect and Selena with their lactose
[58:54] intolerance in these things but then
[58:56] there are you we see somebody that maybe
[58:59] slowly recovers from something and we
[59:01] say well that's just natural
[59:02] no the scripture says I'm the Lord God
[59:04] that healeth all thy diseases listen
[59:07] it's still Supernatural otherwise you go
[59:09] into the hospital two people one comes
[59:11] out with the exact same technology or
[59:13] medical science applied against them and
[59:15] they live and the other person has the
[59:16] same thing and they die why because they
[59:18] can't heal you they can just take out
[59:19] what's wrong with you but it takes God
[59:22] to move in these things and so what
[59:23] happens is we look at something that
[59:25] appears natural but if you can find the
[59:27] promise in the word it's the
[59:28] supernatural that's going on in your
[59:30] life amen
[59:34] what am I trying to get at
[59:36] when you look at what it looks like to
[59:38] take possession of the promised land
[59:39] practically speaking it looks a lot like
[59:41] you fighting
[59:43] it looks a lot like you doing work you
[59:45] know they have that saying that luck
[59:46] looks an awful lot like hard work
[59:49] why because you're making your own
[59:51] opportunities you're developing an
[59:52] opportunity because you're working hard
[59:54] not because there's luck there amen and
[59:56] listen they went into the into the
[59:57] promised land and God gave them Jericho
[59:59] and Jericho was a hundred percent
[1:00:01] Supernatural in the way we would expect
[1:00:02] the supernatural they walked around it
[1:00:04] for days and days and days they didn't
[1:00:06] blow trumpets they didn't shout they
[1:00:08] didn't do anything they didn't try and
[1:00:09] knock down the walls and yet on the last
[1:00:11] day they walked around seven times
[1:00:13] finally started shouting and blowing
[1:00:15] trumpets and the whole thing fell down
[1:00:17] created ramps that they could run up
[1:00:18] over the walls and they took it in just
[1:00:20] an afternoon completely Supernatural
[1:00:24] and every single city after that was
[1:00:27] done the old-fashioned way
[1:00:29] the first one was Supernatural and
[1:00:31] everybody watching them after that would
[1:00:33] have said where did God go after that
[1:00:35] the walls didn't fall down they didn't
[1:00:37] blow trumpets and get victories they
[1:00:39] just went into hand-to-hand combat for
[1:00:41] every city after that as far as We Know
[1:00:43] where's the supernatural in that
[1:00:45] The Supernaturals that they didn't lose
[1:00:47] a man
[1:00:49] except
[1:00:50] the next one after Jericho because what
[1:00:53] happened in Jericho if you remember was
[1:00:55] somebody got out of line and disobeyed
[1:00:57] God
[1:00:57] and that's what caused them to fail
[1:00:59] because Joshua presumed that they would
[1:01:02] just have Victory instead of following
[1:01:04] the leadership of God as to which city
[1:01:06] was to be next because if he would have
[1:01:07] went to God and asked him God would have
[1:01:09] said you can't fight until the camp gets
[1:01:10] cleaned up but he didn't inquire and so
[1:01:12] they went and they went to I call it AI
[1:01:14] maybe it's pronounced I I don't know
[1:01:16] it's a AI is how it's spelled but they
[1:01:19] go there and they lose 36 men because
[1:01:22] one man got his eyes off the promise and
[1:01:25] he took something that belonged to God
[1:01:26] because God said with Jericho he says
[1:01:28] this place is mine and nobody's allowed
[1:01:31] to touch it this is my victory I'm
[1:01:33] showing it I'm showing you what I can do
[1:01:34] he says and nobody can take a victory
[1:01:36] from this this is a it's a commemoration
[1:01:39] to God basically was what he was talking
[1:01:41] about he said you can't take anything
[1:01:43] what happened was Aiken went in there
[1:01:44] and he saw the the wedge of gold and the
[1:01:47] silver and the Babylonian garment church
[1:01:49] he had a city waiting for him he had a
[1:01:52] land waiting for him he had a farm
[1:01:53] waiting for him he had a house waiting
[1:01:55] for him he had all the wealth that he
[1:01:57] could ever expect and want in life and
[1:01:59] his little short-term sight got him into
[1:02:01] trouble
[1:02:02] if he would have held on to the end he'd
[1:02:04] have had way more than a wedge of gold
[1:02:05] and a wedge of silver and a Babylonian
[1:02:07] garment but it's The Human Condition to
[1:02:09] what look at the short term and say I'm
[1:02:11] going to make a decision for that rather
[1:02:13] than look at the big picture
[1:02:14] what to trust God and do it the way that
[1:02:16] he said instead of the other way amen
[1:02:19] but listen after Jericho as I said every
[1:02:21] single battle was fought the
[1:02:22] old-fashioned way
[1:02:25] and they never lost the person and
[1:02:27] that's what was Supernatural
[1:02:29] but you could get caught up in the
[1:02:30] carnality and say where is God I'm the
[1:02:32] one that's Swinging The Sword I'm the
[1:02:34] one that's getting sweaty I'm the one
[1:02:35] that's buckling on the armor I'm the one
[1:02:37] that's got to stay there for days and
[1:02:38] months and put a Siege around the city
[1:02:40] and do all this hard work where is God
[1:02:42] in it
[1:02:43] listen
[1:02:45] they weren't soldiers
[1:02:48] and they were defeating all of the
[1:02:49] soldiers that came against them they
[1:02:51] weren't up they were War they weren't
[1:02:53] Warriors and they were up against train
[1:02:54] Warriors they didn't have all the the
[1:02:56] instruments and weapons of war but yet
[1:02:58] somehow they kept winning that's what
[1:03:00] made it Supernatural
[1:03:02] if they if we'd only stop and say
[1:03:04] sometimes the reason I'm winning is not
[1:03:07] because I'm good at it
[1:03:09] listen we are not ourselves Warriors
[1:03:12] the way Satan has trained his we don't
[1:03:15] go into those things but we go in by
[1:03:17] what faith trusting that God will take
[1:03:19] us through to the other side because we
[1:03:21] can get caught up in the idea that we're
[1:03:23] fighting and we're striving and we're
[1:03:24] pushing and we're saying where's the
[1:03:26] supernatural the Supernatural is here
[1:03:28] because you're still alive you have a
[1:03:30] sound mind you still have a heart to
[1:03:32] serve God you have something that keeps
[1:03:34] you going day in and day out when so
[1:03:36] many people will fall away
[1:03:38] and we see people the following not
[1:03:40] after five years not after ten years
[1:03:42] after 30 and 40 years sometimes they
[1:03:45] fall away because they get tired of the
[1:03:46] fighting and they don't realize that God
[1:03:48] was with them through it all keeping
[1:03:50] them alive amen you're not alive because
[1:03:52] you're good you're alive because he said
[1:03:54] there had to be an overcomer you're
[1:03:56] alive because he said this is the land
[1:03:57] that I've given you and I brought you in
[1:03:59] to take it that's why we're alive it's
[1:04:02] his grace that does it not our skill
[1:04:04] but he is looking for Faith he is
[1:04:06] looking to people that will step into it
[1:04:08] and say that I'll take this Lord I'll be
[1:04:10] a part of the battle I'll be a part of
[1:04:12] the struggle I'll get sweaty I'll get my
[1:04:14] hands dirty I'll pick up a sword and do
[1:04:16] something about it
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:21] listen if you've got a sound mind today
[1:04:24] that is Supernatural because everybody
[1:04:27] else is having their conscience here
[1:04:29] with a hot iron
[1:04:30] that they will believe a lie and be
[1:04:32] damned by it the fact that we come in
[1:04:34] day in and day out and we've got a heart
[1:04:36] that keeps seeking the things of God
[1:04:37] that looks for greater relationship that
[1:04:39] surrenders and puts aside the things
[1:04:41] that this world offers that in of itself
[1:04:43] is the supernatural working in our lives
[1:04:45] day in and day out you young people
[1:04:47] listen if that's what you've got you've
[1:04:49] got God in your life

[1:05:16] and Dish all the things out he give them
[1:05:19] the land but they've got to do the house
[1:05:22] cleaning
[1:05:23] he says Amen in other words you've got a
[1:05:26] job to do you've got a place you've got
[1:05:28] a position you've got a purpose you've
[1:05:30] got something to put your energy into

[1:05:33] you've got something to put your focus
[1:05:35] into and it's cleaning out what God has
[1:05:37] said is yours

[1:05:42] come poke it down your neck you've got
[1:05:45] to take the land yourself
[1:05:48] not yourself and I won't be with you but

[1:05:52] gonna have to do some work in this
[1:05:54] he's given it to you and it's yours rise
[1:05:57] and possess it Hallelujah and he says
[1:06:00] this it's your choice
[1:06:04] you've got to choose
[1:06:06] you have to step willingly into the
[1:06:08] battle
[1:06:09] he says if you want a murmur like the
[1:06:11] other 10 did you'll wander in the
[1:06:12] wilderness a long time longer till
[1:06:14] tomorrow night still sick but if you're
[1:06:17] ready to take it tonight it's yours what
[1:06:20] kind of a choice are you going to make
[1:06:21] he says I will take Jesus and his
[1:06:24] promise and tell the Devil he's a liar
[1:06:26] amen what is the good fight the good
[1:06:29] fight is fighting for what God Said is
[1:06:30] yours going in and saying we are more
[1:06:33] than able to take it we are more than
[1:06:34] able to possess it I don't care how big
[1:06:37] it looks I don't care how many of them
[1:06:38] are how well trained they are we are
[1:06:40] more than able I love how he talked
[1:06:42] about Caleb and he says you know Caleb's
[1:06:45] portion this weekend Caleb had a
[1:06:47] different Spirit we've got a different
[1:06:49] Spirit Church we've got a different
[1:06:51] spirit that tells us I'm willing to go
[1:06:53] in and we willingly choose to step into
[1:06:55] battle for what belongs to us amen
[1:06:59] listen we don't preach a Prosperity
[1:07:01] Gospel I'm not talking about going in
[1:07:03] and fighting for your money and fighting
[1:07:04] no no we have a promise of healing we
[1:07:06] have a promise for salvation we have a
[1:07:08] promise for the infilling of the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost we have a promise where two or
[1:07:11] three are gathered in his name I'll be
[1:07:12] in your midst we have a promise for our
[1:07:14] Resurrection we have a promise for a
[1:07:16] rapture we have a promise for the
[1:07:17] Salvation of our families that's the
[1:07:19] good fight amen not to have a hundred
[1:07:21] thousand dollars in the bank or a house
[1:07:23] paid off but to what see your loved ones
[1:07:25] on the other side and to see the
[1:07:27] promises of God manifested in the body
[1:07:29] of Christ around us that's what we're
[1:07:31] fighting for amen and not just for
[1:07:33] myself but for my brothers and sisters
[1:07:35] that are all around us each one
[1:07:37] listen there's a promise of an overcomer
[1:07:39] I want to fight for that amen I want to
[1:07:41] Pro I want the promise that that I'm
[1:07:43] going to overcome in this age I've read
[1:07:45] this quote before and I keep coming back
[1:07:47] to it he says Canaan is a type of the
[1:07:49] Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they
[1:07:51] come out of the Wilderness is where
[1:07:52] there were a Sanctified called out
[1:07:54] Church Canaan is where they settled down
[1:07:56] with the holy spirit because they still
[1:07:58] have wars and if you don't believe you
[1:08:00] have wars just get the Holy Spirit once
[1:08:03] what are you doing what do you do in
[1:08:05] Canaan they were possessing their rights
[1:08:09] their rights not rights because they
[1:08:12] said it not rights because they believe
[1:08:13] it but because God said that's yours
[1:08:16] What God Says is yours that's what you
[1:08:18] have a right to this evening amen
[1:08:21] Glory says they were possessing their
[1:08:23] rights and they could not possess their
[1:08:25] rights until they got into Canaan they
[1:08:27] don't own nothing in the wilderness
[1:08:30] then when they come into Canaan then
[1:08:33] when they come into Canaan then they had
[1:08:35] rights and we've got rights when you
[1:08:37] receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan
[1:08:39] but you have to fight for it every inch
[1:08:41] of ground you have to fight for it he
[1:08:44] says yes sir
[1:08:45] I've said it before I'll say it again
[1:08:47] we're in a battle Church
[1:08:49] if you're not feeling the effects
[1:08:50] brother Dwayne was telling me and he
[1:08:51] says it seems like we're either coming
[1:08:53] out of one we're in one or we're going
[1:08:55] into another one
[1:08:56] it just seems constant it's one thing or
[1:08:58] another and if it's not for us it's for
[1:09:00] the person next to us it's for our
[1:09:01] brother and sister whether it's Health
[1:09:03] whether it's relationships whether it's
[1:09:05] our children Church issues whatever it
[1:09:07] might be it is a constant battle right
[1:09:09] now and the battle sometimes is what
[1:09:11] will you focus on
[1:09:13] what are you going to just commit to God
[1:09:15] and say God that's yours and then the
[1:09:17] other one say but you put me here to
[1:09:18] battle for this
[1:09:19] they couldn't knock Jericho's walls down
[1:09:21] but they could run up once he knocked
[1:09:23] them down amen there's a portion that's
[1:09:25] for God and then there's a portion
[1:09:26] that's for us to do amen every day it's
[1:09:28] a battle for our time for our mind for
[1:09:30] our eyes for our affections for our
[1:09:32] Focus for even our emotions and how
[1:09:35] we're going to use up that our physical
[1:09:37] strength all of these things everything
[1:09:38] is a battle what are you going to do
[1:09:40] what are you going to fight for how are
[1:09:42] you going to do all these things amen
[1:09:43] and it's exhausting
[1:09:45] it's exhausting to be a Christian so
[1:09:47] many times because every gun in hell is
[1:09:50] trained at us
[1:09:51] every gun in hell is trained at us but
[1:09:53] listen God says you've got to mature and
[1:09:56] that means you've got to go through
[1:09:57] battles and you've got to learn that
[1:09:59] there's victory in the battles and
[1:10:00] that's where your Victory is is in the
[1:10:02] battles it's not in always dodging or
[1:10:04] getting around it but you've got to go
[1:10:05] through the battle sometimes and come
[1:10:07] out the other side and realize God's
[1:10:08] with me amen
[1:10:10] but listen he said bit by bit he's going
[1:10:12] to do it you know what Pride makes us
[1:10:14] want to accelerate
[1:10:15] because it says I've got this
[1:10:18] but humility sits back and says in your
[1:10:20] time lord
[1:10:21] we'll move in your time Lord oh it's
[1:10:23] taken three months to knock this city
[1:10:24] down in your time Lord I'm staying right
[1:10:27] here I'm not moving I'm in the battle
[1:10:28] I'm going to stay I'm gonna fight the
[1:10:30] good fight until it falls because you
[1:10:32] led me here which means if you let me
[1:10:34] here something's got to give and it's
[1:10:36] not going to be me
[1:10:38] hey man let's have some endurance let's
[1:10:40] have some courage let's have some
[1:10:41] staying power amen as we fight through
[1:10:43] this life
[1:10:44] I want to take us back to our original
[1:10:46] scripture to just highlight something
[1:10:48] before we move on
[1:10:49] and Paul said to Timothy this charge I
[1:10:51] commit unto thee son Timothy according
[1:10:53] to the prophecies which went before on
[1:10:56] thee that thou by them might as War a
[1:10:58] good Warfare holding faith in a good
[1:11:00] conscience with some having put away
[1:11:02] concerning Faith have made shipwreck
[1:11:05] Paul was saying to Timothy Timothy
[1:11:07] you're not just anybody
[1:11:09] how many of us would love to have two
[1:11:11] two books of the Bible written about us
[1:11:14] church we got 66 books of the Bible
[1:11:16] written about us
[1:11:18] he's telling Timothy he says Timothy you
[1:11:20] were hand-picked by God
[1:11:22] you've been prophesied over you're
[1:11:25] supposed to be a preacher among
[1:11:26] preachers you're supposed to be a
[1:11:28] leading evangelist you're supposed to be
[1:11:29] a leading Pastor you are going to be one
[1:11:32] of the greatest ministers here and he
[1:11:34] says it's based on what's been said over
[1:11:35] you there's been a word from the Lord
[1:11:37] that's been given over you there's a
[1:11:39] prophecy over you Timothy and you've got
[1:11:41] to fight the fight that takes you into
[1:11:43] the Fulfillment of that prophecy
[1:11:46] Church we've had prophecy after prophecy
[1:11:48] over us whether it's that we're going to
[1:11:50] be Overcomers whether it's that we're
[1:11:52] going to be healed whether it's that
[1:11:53] we're going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:11:54] whether it's that we're going to go in a
[1:11:55] Rapture whatever it is we've been told
[1:11:57] we're going to overcome and our fight is
[1:12:00] to stay in the channel of overcoming and
[1:12:02] to hold to those things which cause us
[1:12:04] to overcome rather than to get
[1:12:06] distracted by everything else that Satan
[1:12:09] throws our way amen that we pick the
[1:12:11] battle that leads us into God and
[1:12:13] eternal life and ignore all those other
[1:12:15] things that we put the blinders of the
[1:12:17] word on us and stay on the straight and
[1:12:19] narrow and not get sucked to the right
[1:12:21] not get sucked to the left not get
[1:12:23] distracted not get depressed by these
[1:12:24] things that comes our way amen but to
[1:12:26] hold fast and to stick with the things
[1:12:28] that God has said are ours
[1:12:31] that's our good Warfare if we'll focus
[1:12:34] on what he has for us we'll be fighting
[1:12:36] for the right things we'll be in the
[1:12:38] right place at the right place right
[1:12:39] time doing the right thing saying the
[1:12:41] right things acting the right way that's
[1:12:43] our good Warfare is to get in line with
[1:12:45] what God has said about us and fight to
[1:12:47] stay with that amen that's what he was
[1:12:49] trying to get Timothy to do he says
[1:12:51] Timothy you've got a prophecy in your
[1:12:53] life but you've got to make a choice to
[1:12:55] get in line
[1:12:56] you've got to make a choice to be where
[1:12:59] God needs you to be you've got to make a
[1:13:00] choice for the things that God has for
[1:13:02] you and that's where your battle is
[1:13:04] going to be a good battle notice he says
[1:13:06] War a good Warfare that means it's
[1:13:08] possible to war a bad Warfare you can be
[1:13:11] fighting the wrong things you can be
[1:13:13] dealing with the wrong issues you can be
[1:13:15] burning yourself out on things that have
[1:13:17] nothing to do with God's purpose and
[1:13:18] plan for you
[1:13:20] absolutely
[1:13:22] listen you make a bad decision Satan
[1:13:24] will run you ragged trying to get you to
[1:13:27] win a battle that he knows is on his own
[1:13:28] land
[1:13:29] listen we don't go into bars
[1:13:32] none of us would go into a bar willingly
[1:13:34] but we'll go into a bar in other areas
[1:13:36] of our life areas where no Christian has
[1:13:38] a right to be and then when something
[1:13:40] comes up and an issue comes up and we
[1:13:42] get in trouble and it's the result of
[1:13:43] our decision we'll sit there and we'll
[1:13:45] get obstinate and we'll fight and we'll
[1:13:46] fight and we'll fight instead of backing
[1:13:48] out and saying I'm going back to where
[1:13:49] God told me to be
[1:13:50] fight the good fight don't fight the bad
[1:13:53] fight
[1:13:54] like I said before if you made the wrong
[1:13:56] decision it made you wrong get out of it
[1:13:58] and get back to where God wants you to
[1:13:59] be because he's not going to give you
[1:14:00] the way the victory but he'll save your
[1:14:02] life but you're going to pay a price for
[1:14:04] it
[1:14:06] brother Duane read it it was in my notes
[1:14:07] and I had to take it out where he said
[1:14:09] that Abraham he says he went over there
[1:14:11] and he says God preserved Abraham but he
[1:14:13] made him repent
[1:14:14] Abraham had to say he was sorry Abraham
[1:14:16] had to recognize I messed up and then
[1:14:19] God comes around he takes him out of
[1:14:20] these things amen
[1:14:22] he says you've got to war a good Warfare
[1:14:23] you got to fight a good fight Timothy
[1:14:25] fight for the right things fight to stay
[1:14:27] in line with what the prophecy said
[1:14:28] fight to stay in line with the promise
[1:14:30] of God for your life fight to stay in
[1:14:32] tune with what God has spoken for you
[1:14:35] that's what we're trying to do we're
[1:14:36] trying to catch the voice we've had a
[1:14:38] voice
[1:14:39] we've had a seventh age messenger a
[1:14:41] prophet coming this day and tell us and
[1:14:43] that's what we need to be focused on is
[1:14:45] what he told us to do
[1:14:46] and then the holy spirit in our life
[1:14:49] ought to be confirming that into our
[1:14:50] lives day by day that we ought not to
[1:14:52] just have to turn the tape on to hear
[1:14:53] the voice of the Holy Spirit but it
[1:14:55] ought to be in our lives for our own
[1:14:56] personal situations leading us and
[1:14:58] guiding us day by day
[1:15:01] what does it look like to war the good
[1:15:03] Warfare to fight the good fight verse 19
[1:15:05] says hold Faith holding the faith stick
[1:15:08] to what's been proven stick to what's
[1:15:10] true stick to what God has said stay
[1:15:12] there and don't move from it no matter
[1:15:14] what happens remember the scripture says
[1:15:16] having done all to stand stand stay
[1:15:18] there don't back up hold fast to that
[1:15:21] which you've laid hold of amen and then
[1:15:23] he says what trust that's what he means
[1:15:25] is trust God absolutely hold by faith
[1:15:28] say Lord I'm trusting you and I'm going
[1:15:30] to stick with your word then he says
[1:15:32] what having a good conscience what's he
[1:15:35] saying keep your conscience clear
[1:15:37] like I said when we make mistakes admit
[1:15:40] it back up to where we left the word
[1:15:42] back up to where we left God and then
[1:15:43] continue on from there
[1:15:46] listen Brothers
[1:15:47] we've got to keep our conscience clear
[1:15:49] and it's not just for us but it's for
[1:15:50] our household
[1:15:51] amen as for our families we've got to be
[1:15:53] able to go before God with a clear
[1:15:55] conscience and say Lord my house is
[1:15:57] clean
[1:15:58] my life is clean listen when you've got
[1:16:01] to pray you don't want to have to go
[1:16:02] back and make something right that
[1:16:03] you've been letting go in your life for
[1:16:04] the last few weeks or months
[1:16:06] you want to keep your conscience clear
[1:16:07] you want to know that you're where God
[1:16:09] wants you to be that your house is pure
[1:16:11] that your family's pure that you're
[1:16:13] keeping your house clean from these
[1:16:14] things amen
[1:16:16] listen sisters you're not just a mother
[1:16:18] you are a weapon in the hand of almighty
[1:16:21] God when it comes to defeating what
[1:16:23] Satan would try putting your children's
[1:16:24] lives day to day you're not just a
[1:16:26] mother you're not just a wife you are a
[1:16:28] holy ghost-filled woman and just like a
[1:16:30] man you're a warrior of the faith and
[1:16:32] God has put you where you are for a
[1:16:34] specific purpose and it's to fight the
[1:16:36] good fight
[1:16:38] you have authority
[1:16:40] when God gives you the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:42] gives you Authority and that's to go
[1:16:44] against everything that Satan brings up
[1:16:45] against you and your family
[1:16:47] the father's there is the head of the
[1:16:49] household but Sisters You've Got as much
[1:16:50] power Before the Throne of God as your
[1:16:52] husband does
[1:16:53] Satan has to listen to you just like he
[1:16:55] has to listen to your husband
[1:16:57] and the father in the house amen you're
[1:16:58] a weapon in the hands of God
[1:17:02] Paul wrote to Timothy twice encouraging
[1:17:05] him he said my son Timothy son Timothy
[1:17:08] was like he wasn't just a mentor I
[1:17:09] believe he was like a father we never
[1:17:11] hear about Timothy's dad I often wonder
[1:17:13] if maybe he lost his father at an early
[1:17:15] age or something but he was like a a son
[1:17:17] to Paul and Paul was laboring to bring
[1:17:19] Timothy to the place where he could be
[1:17:20] what what he was supposed to be
[1:17:22] according to the prophecies Paul laid
[1:17:24] hands on Timothy yeah I assume he's the
[1:17:26] one that prophesied we don't know but he
[1:17:27] laid hands on Timothy and he ordained
[1:17:29] him to be a minister but he said Timothy
[1:17:31] you've got to work you've got to fight
[1:17:33] to come into this not fight to get it
[1:17:36] but fight to step into it
[1:17:38] to fight to step into what the character
[1:17:41] the nature to be what God has you to be
[1:17:43] but it's not just to go for the gift
[1:17:45] it's to go in and get the character that
[1:17:47] God needs you to have before he can
[1:17:48] really start running this gift because
[1:17:50] why Timothy can't make it by a gift
[1:17:53] he's got to make it by a life
[1:17:56] he's got to prove to the people that
[1:17:58] he's a he's a real believer that he's
[1:17:59] got the holy ghost that God can lead him
[1:18:01] and guide him before he's ever going to
[1:18:02] be an effective minister
[1:18:04] listen to what Paul said to him he said
[1:18:06] let no man despise thy youth but be thou
[1:18:09] an example of the Believers
[1:18:12] because he wrote to Timothy and if you
[1:18:13] read the words but he's he kind of says
[1:18:15] Timothy don't don't back away
[1:18:18] don't don't let your foot off the gas
[1:18:20] keep pushing here keep fighting for this
[1:18:22] but he says the first thing you've got
[1:18:24] to do is be an example to the Believers
[1:18:26] in what word
[1:18:28] it matters what we say conversation that
[1:18:31] doesn't mean conversation the way we're
[1:18:32] talking means your manner of life
[1:18:34] in charity in spirit in faith and in
[1:18:39] Purity so he says listen you've got to
[1:18:40] fight to be an example first and then
[1:18:42] you'll be the preacher that was
[1:18:43] prophesied about later so he says let's
[1:18:45] let's focus on how you live let's hope
[1:18:47] focus on how you talk let's focus on how
[1:18:49] you put your shoulder to the wheel in
[1:18:50] love let's look at how you talk let's
[1:18:52] look at how you clean your life up and
[1:18:54] get that all in line and then the
[1:18:56] prophecies for the rest of your ministry
[1:18:57] will come true but Timothy you've got to
[1:18:59] fight for this first
[1:19:00] you gotta fight to be an example before
[1:19:02] you can be a leader in these things
[1:19:05] listen so often we we hear Brother
[1:19:07] Branham say Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ
[1:19:09] the same yesterday today and forever but
[1:19:11] if you look in Hebrews 13 7 it says that
[1:19:13] we're supposed to look to the ministry
[1:19:15] and see if their lives are a reflection
[1:19:17] of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:19] and forever that's the standard for the
[1:19:21] ministry is do you reflect Christ in
[1:19:23] your life before you ever get behind
[1:19:25] that pulpit
[1:19:26] that's where you're supposed to judge me
[1:19:28] by
[1:19:29] and every other minister that steps
[1:19:30] behind that Pulpit is do you see Christ
[1:19:32] in me before you ever put me behind here
[1:19:33] to speak the words
[1:19:35] that's what he was saying to Timothy
[1:19:36] what was Timothy fighting for to get in
[1:19:39] the ministry ranks to get his own church
[1:19:40] to become a pastor no Timothy was
[1:19:43] fighting first to be an example to the
[1:19:45] Believers to have the kind of character
[1:19:47] that God could trust to be the kind of
[1:19:49] man the people would look at and say I
[1:19:50] can see God moving in his life and so I
[1:19:52] can accept the words that he's going to
[1:19:53] bring over that Pulpit amen his battle
[1:19:55] was to be in alignment with God's word
[1:19:57] first and then the prophecies would come
[1:19:59] later
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:03] we talked about it before when we we
[1:20:05] spoke on on the uh the characteristics
[1:20:08] of a seduction and Timothy was facing
[1:20:10] conditions in people similar to what we
[1:20:11] have in laodicea
[1:20:13] because what we're facing today Paul
[1:20:14] said at the end times that's what's
[1:20:15] going to come and they came in the end
[1:20:17] time of that age and they came in the
[1:20:19] end time of this age amen and we talked
[1:20:20] about those different things and Paul
[1:20:22] Paul was trying to tell Timothy you got
[1:20:24] to be a solid Minister you got to be
[1:20:25] able to preach the full word and you got
[1:20:27] to be able to say it whether people want
[1:20:28] to hear it or not and whether they're
[1:20:30] receiving it or not and all of these
[1:20:31] different things but he said Timothy you
[1:20:33] got to be built up into that
[1:20:35] and you got a fight to be built up you
[1:20:37] got to focus your energy to fight to be
[1:20:39] growing and maturing and not just trying
[1:20:42] to get the position
[1:20:46] look at what this looks like this is
[1:20:47] Timothy this is Paul talking Timothy he
[1:20:49] says but godliness with contentment is
[1:20:52] great gain
[1:20:54] church if God would say that's a Godly
[1:20:56] Man Of Me
[1:20:57] that'll be enough
[1:21:00] if you can look at your life and say I
[1:21:01] know I'm a real believer
[1:21:03] that's about the most wonderful thing
[1:21:05] you can have
[1:21:06] and to be content with the idea that God
[1:21:09] would look at you and say my good and
[1:21:11] faithful servant I'm pleased you've done
[1:21:14] what I said you've acted the way I've
[1:21:15] acted you've talked the way I talked all
[1:21:17] of these things enter into the joy if
[1:21:19] God is content with your life
[1:21:21] that's where I want to find my
[1:21:23] contentment amen and then whatever
[1:21:25] happens in life whether the house is big
[1:21:27] or small I've had it I've had the rusted
[1:21:28] out cars and I've had the new cars I've
[1:21:30] had the big house and the small house
[1:21:31] I've had air conditioning no air
[1:21:33] conditioning I've had lots of money and
[1:21:34] not much money
[1:21:36] but in it all if I know that God's
[1:21:37] working with me that's where my
[1:21:39] contentment has to be amen he says for
[1:21:41] we brought nothing into this world and
[1:21:43] it is certain that we can carry nothing
[1:21:45] out but having food and Raymond let us
[1:21:48] be there with content the simple life is
[1:21:50] the life of the believer
[1:21:51] and then we don't seek these great
[1:21:53] things if we've got food and we've got
[1:21:55] clothes he doesn't even say a roof over
[1:21:57] your head
[1:21:58] says food and clothes that's all you
[1:21:59] really need
[1:22:00] maybe he didn't live in Newfoundland
[1:22:02] but they that will be rich
[1:22:04] fall into temptation and a snare and
[1:22:07] into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:22:09] which drown men in destruction and
[1:22:11] Perdition anyone want to be rich
[1:22:15] I don't want to be rich after reading
[1:22:16] that
[1:22:18] they didn't start in hurtful lusts they
[1:22:20] didn't start in foolish lusts but it
[1:22:22] drowns them and it takes them into
[1:22:23] destruction and perdition Jesus said how
[1:22:26] hard it is for a rich man to enter the
[1:22:28] Kingdom of Heaven why because you get
[1:22:29] your eyes off of the word it's not a
[1:22:31] faith-building lifestyle if you have a
[1:22:33] lot of wealth that's for sure
[1:22:34] verse 10 says For the Love of Money is
[1:22:37] the root of all evil
[1:22:38] which while some coveted after they have
[1:22:41] erred from the faith and pierced
[1:22:43] themselves through with many sorrows
[1:22:45] he says but thou o man of God flee these
[1:22:49] things
[1:22:50] but I want you to notice something
[1:22:51] because sometimes we run and we don't
[1:22:53] run in the right direction
[1:22:55] sometimes you run from one problem into
[1:22:57] the next problem but he tells Timothy
[1:22:59] where to run he says flee these things
[1:23:00] and follow after righteousness godliness
[1:23:04] Faith love patience and meekness in
[1:23:08] other words he was saying fall in love
[1:23:09] with what God loves
[1:23:11] seek after the things that God wants to
[1:23:13] seek see in your life and that's where
[1:23:15] you're going to have the victory amen
[1:23:17] start seeking Godly character start
[1:23:19] seeking a Godly nature seek after the
[1:23:21] attributes that God's looking for and
[1:23:23] that's where you're going to get the
[1:23:24] Victory and that'll keep you out of the
[1:23:26] all of those foolish less that you've
[1:23:27] been chasing before
[1:23:29] and then he says fight the good fight of
[1:23:31] Faith this is where I took my scripture
[1:23:32] from for the for the title he says fight
[1:23:34] the good fight of Faith what does that
[1:23:36] look like brother John lay hold on
[1:23:39] eternal life where unto Thou Art also
[1:23:42] called and has professed a good
[1:23:44] profession before many witnesses that
[1:23:47] word lay whole means to seize it to hold
[1:23:49] on to it and don't let go
[1:23:52] don't get the idea wrong now you're not
[1:23:55] holding on to it because if you don't
[1:23:56] hold on to it you'll lose it
[1:23:58] see that's fear
[1:24:00] that's fear you're not holding on to it
[1:24:02] because if you don't hold on to it
[1:24:03] you'll lose it remember Paul says what
[1:24:05] it's yours you're called to it
[1:24:08] so it's always available to you but what
[1:24:11] do you do you're holding on to it not
[1:24:12] out of fear but because that's what
[1:24:14] matters most to you
[1:24:17] eternal life the kingdom of God and the
[1:24:19] things that are associated with it
[1:24:20] that's what matters to us most so that's
[1:24:22] where we ought to see our hands gripping
[1:24:24] and saying I Won't Let You Go I Won't
[1:24:26] Let You Go today I'm going to lay hold
[1:24:28] of eternal life and that's what I'm
[1:24:30] going to be fighting for that's what I'm
[1:24:32] going to be struggling for to lay hold
[1:24:33] of eternal life amen to walk one step
[1:24:36] closer to Eternity today amen
[1:24:38] it's not a fight to somehow make you a
[1:24:41] great warrior or achieve great things or
[1:24:43] anything but it's a fight for what God
[1:24:45] to express himself through you that's
[1:24:47] what eternal life is is it's God
[1:24:49] expressing himself through you here now
[1:24:52] that's what our fight is to what lay
[1:24:55] hold and fight for him to express
[1:24:56] himself through us
[1:24:58] that's what we're seeking for for
[1:25:00] Timothy it was going to be through
[1:25:01] preaching ultimately
[1:25:02] but we've got a a whole body of people
[1:25:04] here like I said with the meetings we
[1:25:06] just had that happen because we've got
[1:25:08] it people that are laying hold of their
[1:25:10] portion of what they're supposed to do
[1:25:12] here
[1:25:13] whether it's brother vaishal on the
[1:25:14] audio visual to the sisters that are
[1:25:16] helping to clean and cook and all these
[1:25:18] things lay hold on the things that God
[1:25:20] has for you to promote the kingdom of
[1:25:22] God let eternal life flow out of you in
[1:25:24] servanthood usually
[1:25:26] and watch what follows
[1:25:28] watch what follows
[1:25:30] you'll be amazed that that influence
[1:25:32] looks a lot like servanthood
[1:25:35] that leading looks an awful lot like
[1:25:37] serving
[1:25:40] that promotion looks an awful lot like
[1:25:42] humility
[1:25:45] remember Jesus said when you go in don't
[1:25:47] sit at the at the the the high table
[1:25:49] don't sit at the high chairs don't go to
[1:25:51] the the head of the table he says sit
[1:25:53] low and he says they'll call you up
[1:25:55] but he says it's really bad if you go up
[1:25:57] to the top and they say no you've got to
[1:25:59] move down
[1:26:00] you're not what you think you are we've
[1:26:01] got somebody that really deserves to be
[1:26:03] there amen
[1:26:06] Paul says you're in a good fight
[1:26:08] make sure it's tied to eternal life
[1:26:11] make sure it's tied to the things of God
[1:26:12] Amen Church were supposed to be in a
[1:26:14] good fight what have we been fighting
[1:26:16] lately
[1:26:17] what have you been fighting lately
[1:26:18] what's your struggle for is it something
[1:26:19] that that is attached to eternal life
[1:26:22] or is it something of your own choosing
[1:26:24] or making
[1:26:29] when I was studying this and and I read
[1:26:31] that that portion lay hold on eternal
[1:26:33] life it reminded me of Jacob when he was
[1:26:35] wrestling with the Lord
[1:26:37] and it says and Jacob was left alone and
[1:26:39] there Wrestled a man with him until the
[1:26:40] breaking of the day and when he saw that
[1:26:42] he prevailed not against him he touched
[1:26:44] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[1:26:46] of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[1:26:48] wrestled with them and he said let me go
[1:26:50] for the angel for the day break it this
[1:26:52] is the Angel of the Lord saying this
[1:26:54] and he and Jacob said he said I will not
[1:26:57] let thee go except thou bless me
[1:27:02] and he the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:27:04] him what is thy name and he said Jacob I
[1:27:07] don't know if you remember when brother
[1:27:08] Ed hammermeister was here but I loved it
[1:27:10] when he brought out how Jacob had to
[1:27:12] admit that he was a shyster that he was
[1:27:15] a con man that he was a cheater because
[1:27:17] that's what Jacob means shyster
[1:27:20] and he had to say I'm a shyster
[1:27:23] before he could ever be changed into a
[1:27:25] prince having power with God he had to
[1:27:26] admit where he was at
[1:27:28] he had to admit what he was what name he
[1:27:31] was under
[1:27:32] he had to admit what his nature was
[1:27:34] before he could get the promise but in
[1:27:36] the meantime he didn't let his shyster
[1:27:38] nature keep him from laying hold of what
[1:27:40] he was guaranteed to get he was
[1:27:42] determined that even being a shyster he
[1:27:45] was going to get what God had promised
[1:27:46] to me man God had said I'm going to
[1:27:48] bless you I'll preserve you don't worry
[1:27:49] about it but Jacob got in a place where
[1:27:51] he says I gotta know that I know that I
[1:27:54] know that you're with me God and he
[1:27:56] would not let go though he touched the
[1:27:58] thigh he knocked it out of joint so that
[1:28:00] he was crippled though he was a shyster
[1:28:02] he said I'm not going to let you go
[1:28:04] until you give me the blessing amen
[1:28:07] Church don't let your current condition
[1:28:08] stop you from seeking what God has for
[1:28:11] you
[1:28:12] I loved and and I guarantee you I'm
[1:28:14] going to preach on it in more depth
[1:28:15] where brother Dwayne said he said you
[1:28:18] can't have Hebrews 11 until you have the
[1:28:20] the blood at the cross of calvary
[1:28:22] because you can read all about Abraham
[1:28:24] in the Book of Genesis
[1:28:26] and then when you go and you pass it
[1:28:27] through the blood of Christ you get
[1:28:28] Hebrews 11. you get a faith chapter
[1:28:31] listen when we're done we won't be
[1:28:33] called shysters we won't be called
[1:28:36] failures and and flawed people and all
[1:28:39] these different things we won't be
[1:28:40] called Liars or no no no through the
[1:28:42] blood it will be by faith Selena corlett
[1:28:45] by faith Brenda coffee by faith David
[1:28:48] Sharp by faith Jensen curlette by faith
[1:28:51] Joshua Colombo that's what he's going to
[1:28:54] see amen don't let what you're in right
[1:28:56] now don't let your current condition
[1:28:57] keep you from laying hold and say Lord I
[1:28:59] know there's more
[1:29:01] why because he promised it amen
[1:29:04] and he said thy name shall be called No
[1:29:07] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[1:29:10] hast thou power with God and men and
[1:29:13] with men and has prevailed
[1:29:15] he said Jacob you've overcome
[1:29:19] but did Jacob overcome by winning
[1:29:21] did Jacob win this wrestling match
[1:29:25] Jacob didn't win it
[1:29:27] you think you can be gone in a wrestling
[1:29:29] match
[1:29:31] can't even beat ourselves
[1:29:33] much less God but how did Jacob overcome
[1:29:36] he wouldn't let go
[1:29:39] he refused to let go of God until he got
[1:29:42] what God had promised
[1:29:45] your overcoming is when it comes to God
[1:29:47] is Not By beating him it's by saying I
[1:29:50] will not let you go until you give me
[1:29:52] what you promised
[1:29:54] that's a good fight that's Lane hold of
[1:29:56] eternal life that's taking hold of the
[1:29:58] word that's letting Faith do the talking
[1:29:59] in your in your relationship with God
[1:30:01] saying God I'm not moving remember
[1:30:03] brother Brown talks about that brother I
[1:30:05] forget his name now I've got the quote
[1:30:06] at home in my notes where he said that
[1:30:08] he he says I'm going to go out in that
[1:30:10] field
[1:30:11] and I'm going to stay there until I get
[1:30:12] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:14] he says and if I don't get the Holy
[1:30:16] Ghost they'll find a pile of bones
[1:30:17] someday
[1:30:19] he went out determined to get what
[1:30:21] eternal life
[1:30:22] he went up determined to get the Holy
[1:30:24] Ghost and he says I'm not coming back
[1:30:26] until I got it and guess what just like
[1:30:28] Jacob he wrestled until he got it he
[1:30:30] laid hold of the promise until God gave
[1:30:32] him the Holy Ghost and then he came back
[1:30:35] that's what we've got to do sometimes
[1:30:36] that's the good fight is stay there and
[1:30:38] hold on and say God you said it was for
[1:30:40] me and I'm here to get it
[1:30:43] it's his calling Paul said you're called
[1:30:45] to this you didn't come in here and make
[1:30:48] it up yourself you didn't make yourself
[1:30:50] into a child of God you didn't determine
[1:30:52] that you're worth it you didn't
[1:30:53] determine that you deserve it but he
[1:30:55] said you are called to do it and that's
[1:30:57] what allows us to come up and say I'm
[1:30:59] not letting go until you give it to me
[1:31:00] God Amen that's the good fight lay hold
[1:31:03] until you get it
[1:31:05] stay there don't move until he gives it
[1:31:07] to you amen what was Paul telling
[1:31:09] Timothy he was saying Timothy you're
[1:31:11] some of this you got to do yourself it's
[1:31:13] going to be up to you you're the one
[1:31:15] that's going to have to decide whether
[1:31:16] you're going to step in or whether
[1:31:18] you're going to stay out whether you're
[1:31:20] going to lay hold or whether you're
[1:31:21] going to let it go for another day for
[1:31:22] another person Timothy you're going to
[1:31:24] have to make a choice you're going to
[1:31:25] have to make a decision about what
[1:31:27] happens here listen we've got two roads
[1:31:28] ahead of us every single day
[1:31:31] we sang that song twice this weekend
[1:31:33] there are two roads you may take one by
[1:31:36] sight and one by faith and the good
[1:31:39] fight is faith faith faith faith faith
[1:31:42] day in and day out by Faith by Faith by
[1:31:45] faith and you're staying with the word
[1:31:46] of God
[1:31:48] every single day
[1:31:51] what am I saying pick your fight
[1:31:54] and pick the right fight
[1:31:56] because you're going to be offered
[1:31:57] fights every single day
[1:31:59] and one of them is going to be for ease
[1:32:01] of life and luxury and the goods of this
[1:32:03] world and and and and and short-term
[1:32:05] gain for long-term pain which he won't
[1:32:07] tell you about by the way of course but
[1:32:09] if you'll pick the right one that's
[1:32:11] where the supernatural Lays
[1:32:14] but it often looks a lot like a battle
[1:32:16] not just a walk in the park
[1:32:18] listen David said yay though I walk
[1:32:20] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:32:21] death I'll fear no evil the Supernatural
[1:32:24] is that he could walk through that and
[1:32:26] fear no evil
[1:32:28] you never walk any place where there's a
[1:32:29] reason to be scared you're never going
[1:32:30] to experience the supernatural you've
[1:32:32] got to be put in a situation where
[1:32:34] you've got to recognize that God's the
[1:32:35] one that's taking me through all these
[1:32:37] things amen
[1:32:38] what's he saying he's saying you can
[1:32:40] pick to be a spectator
[1:32:42] or you can pick the the road that takes
[1:32:44] you into being a soldier
[1:32:45] because Satan will put you as a
[1:32:47] spectator all day long
[1:32:48] you can sit in church and be a spectator
[1:32:50] all day long you can read your Bible and
[1:32:52] do all these things and if you don't
[1:32:53] pick the Road of Faith you're just going
[1:32:54] to be a spectator
[1:32:56] but the RAM says this he says and that
[1:32:58] we know there is going to be a bride and
[1:33:00] there's going to be a wedding supper
[1:33:02] served in the skies that's just as sure
[1:33:04] to be as God is because it's his word
[1:33:06] and we know that those that are going to
[1:33:08] make up that bride is going to be his
[1:33:10] church and they're going to appear
[1:33:12] before him without spot or wrinkle
[1:33:14] listen to this now and they have the
[1:33:18] material on Earth right now to make
[1:33:20] themselves ready
[1:33:22] well he said God's going to have himself
[1:33:24] a bride without spot or wrinkle he says
[1:33:26] you're the one that has to put it on the
[1:33:28] scripture says the bride had made
[1:33:29] herself ready he says there if you
[1:33:31] notice it said she's made herself ready
[1:33:32] so many says well if the Lord will take
[1:33:34] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:33:36] or from gambling or for lying or
[1:33:38] stealing I'll serve him he says but
[1:33:40] that's up to you see you got to do
[1:33:43] something too they that overcome shall
[1:33:46] inherit all things they didn't overcome
[1:33:48] he says you have power to do it you have
[1:33:50] power to overcome but you must be
[1:33:52] willing to wait lay it down lay what
[1:33:55] down that Spirit that's bothering you
[1:33:57] that habit that friendship that
[1:33:58] hindrance whatever it is he says you've
[1:34:00] got to be willing to lay it down so that
[1:34:02] overcoming can happen
[1:34:04] you've got to make a decision I want
[1:34:06] overcoming more than I want that thing
[1:34:08] that's bogging me down that habit that's
[1:34:10] been in my life for months or years or
[1:34:12] whatever the family tradition that I've
[1:34:14] had or the DNA that I've got whatever it
[1:34:16] is he says you've got to be willing to
[1:34:17] lay it down and that's what you've got
[1:34:19] to do
[1:34:22] he says see she has made herself ready I
[1:34:25] like that word you see God could not
[1:34:27] push us through a little pipe and pull
[1:34:30] us out on the other end and then same
[1:34:31] blessed is he that overcometh
[1:34:34] you had nothing to overcome he just
[1:34:38] pushed you through see this is where we
[1:34:40] get the balance in these things
[1:34:42] because we can sit there and say it's
[1:34:43] God it's God it's God
[1:34:45] but we'll get into her and he says but
[1:34:47] I've given you the sword
[1:34:50] you had nothing to overcome he just
[1:34:52] pushed you through but you've got to
[1:34:54] make decisions for yourself I have to
[1:34:57] make decisions for myself and in doing
[1:34:59] that
[1:35:00] we show our faith and respects to God
[1:35:06] so the decisions we make to step into
[1:35:09] battle to step into a place that
[1:35:11] requires us to overcome is how we show
[1:35:13] faith and how we show respect to God in
[1:35:16] his word
[1:35:17] I was reading in James today where he
[1:35:19] says he says show me show me your Works
[1:35:21] without faith I'll show you my faith by
[1:35:22] my works and he says faith without works
[1:35:24] is dead
[1:35:26] The Works is the good fight The Works is
[1:35:28] the decisions you make to step willingly
[1:35:30] into a situation where you're going to
[1:35:32] have to trust the word of God to take
[1:35:33] you through
[1:35:35] in doing that he says we show our faith
[1:35:37] and respects to God Abraham was promised
[1:35:39] a child but he must maintain This
[1:35:42] Promise for 25 years the ups and downs
[1:35:44] that he had in Temptations in those 25
[1:35:46] years but he held to the word of the
[1:35:49] promise
[1:35:52] that's the good fight
[1:35:54] and Israel was promised to Promised Land
[1:35:57] but they had to fight for every inch of
[1:35:59] it wherever The Souls of your foot
[1:36:01] Treads upon that have I given you well
[1:36:03] listen if you just stand here you're not
[1:36:05] going to get anything
[1:36:06] you'll get where you're standing you
[1:36:08] walk over here he says that's yours you
[1:36:10] walk over here that's yours when we get
[1:36:13] the car when we can have the confidence
[1:36:15] of the Revelation that if we're walking
[1:36:17] in his will everywhere we step belongs
[1:36:19] to us I think we'd start running rather
[1:36:21] than walking
[1:36:22] uh it struck me when he was talking this
[1:36:24] weekend about David and Goliath he
[1:36:26] didn't mention it but it struck me that
[1:36:27] David did not stand and wait for Goliath
[1:36:29] to come to him the scripture says he ran
[1:36:32] towards Goliath
[1:36:34] he brought him into range of his weapon
[1:36:36] and then God killed him
[1:36:38] he ran towards him footsteps were
[1:36:41] possession he wasn't scared he was
[1:36:43] confident that victory was going to
[1:36:45] follow and all he had to do was get in
[1:36:47] range
[1:36:48] wherever The Souls of your foot Treads
[1:36:50] upon that have I given you God said to
[1:36:51] Joshua it was all there the lamb was
[1:36:54] there and God gave it to them but they
[1:36:56] must fight for it the same way it is
[1:36:58] about Divine Healing God has got the
[1:37:00] power to heal you if you've got the
[1:37:03] courage to accept it but you'll fight
[1:37:06] every inch of the way
[1:37:09] you'll fight every inch of the way you
[1:37:11] say well brother John I'm fighting I
[1:37:13] don't feel like I got faith the fact
[1:37:14] that you're fighting proves that you got
[1:37:16] faith so keep fighting
[1:37:18] if you didn't have faith you wouldn't
[1:37:20] fight
[1:37:21] but you're fighting so hold on to that
[1:37:23] and say God I'm fighting because you
[1:37:24] told me to fight and I'm trusting that
[1:37:26] you're going to take me through and
[1:37:27] you're going to give me my healing
[1:37:30] god listen to this this is amazing he
[1:37:33] says God has got Amazing Grace to save
[1:37:35] you and we all say hallelujah praise the
[1:37:37] lord it's by Grace by Grace by grace and
[1:37:40] he says and he will do it hallelujah
[1:37:42] praise the Lord but you'll fight every
[1:37:44] inch of your way
[1:37:46] purified every inch of your way to get
[1:37:48] the grace that God has given you because
[1:37:50] every gun in hell is trained at you
[1:37:54] Satan is trying to turn his grace into
[1:37:56] disgrace he's trying to keep you from it
[1:37:58] what getting what God has given you of a
[1:38:00] free will offering
[1:38:02] but you're gonna have to fight to get it
[1:38:04] because it's surrounded by Giants it's
[1:38:06] surrounded by enemies it's surrounded by
[1:38:08] demons it's surrounded by habits it's
[1:38:11] surrounded by distractions
[1:38:13] you've got to fight a good fight to
[1:38:15] focus on where God wants you to and to
[1:38:17] take it for yourself
[1:38:19] he said I've been behind the pulpit
[1:38:21] going on 31 years and every inch of that
[1:38:24] has been a fight constantly it certainly
[1:38:26] has and he quotes the song but if we
[1:38:28] must fight if we must Reign so we find
[1:38:30] out that the bride has to make herself
[1:38:32] ready what does he say this looks like
[1:38:34] be willing to lay aside every weight
[1:38:37] that does so easily beset us that we
[1:38:40] might run with patience the race that's
[1:38:42] set before us
[1:38:44] we must lay aside ourself
[1:38:49] we can't say God you come and lay them
[1:38:51] aside for us we've got to do that
[1:38:53] ourselves
[1:38:55] what's our part to lay aside everything
[1:38:57] that holds us back and that's a battle
[1:38:59] isn't it
[1:39:00] it's a battle to lay down the things
[1:39:02] that you like that this flesh likes that
[1:39:04] this flesh craves that this world says
[1:39:06] are important
[1:39:08] it's tough to lay that down that's a
[1:39:10] battle to lay it down
[1:39:12] and then it's a battle after you lay it
[1:39:14] down to fill that hole to fill that Gap
[1:39:16] to fill that time with something that's
[1:39:17] going to benefit you in your walk with
[1:39:19] God it's a fight to lay it down then
[1:39:21] it's a fight to put the right thing in
[1:39:22] behind it
[1:39:23] you know I I spoke this weekend you know
[1:39:25] I said that you know it's so nice to
[1:39:27] come in and get scoured out in those
[1:39:28] type of services but the other thing is
[1:39:30] you want to get filled up too
[1:39:32] you can't just be empty
[1:39:34] because otherwise it's like the
[1:39:35] scripture says that the the spirit goes
[1:39:37] out of the house and he goes around and
[1:39:39] dry place then he comes back and he
[1:39:40] finds it all cleaned up and he brings
[1:39:42] seven more worse than him and the state
[1:39:43] of that man is worse than he was in the
[1:39:45] beginning you got to fill up what's been
[1:39:46] cleaned out
[1:39:48] you got to put something in there so the
[1:39:49] fight is to get it out and then the
[1:39:51] fight is to get the right thing in there
[1:39:52] so that you can move on so that you can
[1:39:53] possess the land and keep moving on and
[1:39:55] on and on and grow and mature in Christ
[1:39:57] into the stature of a perfect man amen
[1:40:00] every distraction every Temptation
[1:40:02] whatever it might be we've got to make a
[1:40:03] decision do I do what Satan wants by
[1:40:06] sight or do what God Says by faith every
[1:40:09] day all we're doing is making decisions
[1:40:11] and the more right decisions you make
[1:40:13] the heart of the battle is
[1:40:15] but the greater the victory is
[1:40:18] that's all we're doing every day every
[1:40:19] every every every time we spend as a
[1:40:22] Believer is a fight to make the right
[1:40:23] decision
[1:40:25] that's it and how many times you see in
[1:40:27] scripture they make one bad decision
[1:40:30] and it causes so much pain and so much
[1:40:32] hurt and so much sorrow and so much loss
[1:40:33] so much wasted time wasted effort
[1:40:38] that's where the grace comes in for us
[1:40:40] we're under our Grace Covenant now and
[1:40:42] so he just brings us back like he said
[1:40:44] about Abraham he didn't give him a
[1:40:46] victory but he made him repent didn't
[1:40:48] let him get away with it he made him
[1:40:49] repent but then he brought him right
[1:40:50] back into the promise anyways amen
[1:40:55] what are we willing to fight for
[1:40:57] what are we fighting for what have we
[1:40:58] been fighting for this week look back at
[1:41:00] this week and say and just just consider
[1:41:02] what have I been fighting for
[1:41:04] where has my struggle been where have I
[1:41:06] where have I applied my time where have
[1:41:08] I got what have I gotten stressed about
[1:41:09] even
[1:41:11] is it things of this world or is it
[1:41:13] things of the kingdom of God
[1:41:16] it's not that you can't be stressed with
[1:41:18] the things of this world as long as
[1:41:19] they're in the will of God but let all
[1:41:21] of our fights not be about things for
[1:41:22] this world and nothing for the kingdom
[1:41:23] of God either in other words what what's
[1:41:25] gotten us worked up lately maybe that's
[1:41:28] a better way of putting it
[1:41:29] what have we gotten worked up about
[1:41:30] really God you know really
[1:41:33] really twerked you know there's really
[1:41:35] you know what I'm not letting this one
[1:41:37] go what's the last time we said I'm not
[1:41:40] backing down
[1:41:41] anybody had an I'm not backing down
[1:41:43] moment lately
[1:41:45] one
[1:41:47] was it something of God
[1:41:49] that's what I'm asking was it a promise
[1:41:51] of God was it a direction God had given
[1:41:53] you or was it something where it was
[1:41:54] just our own obstinence that got us into
[1:41:56] that
[1:41:58] what are we fighting for today amen
[1:42:02] I spoke of shamgar the last service and
[1:42:04] and I think shamgar is kind of like the
[1:42:07] the poster child the spokesman for the
[1:42:08] good fight campaign and I ran across
[1:42:11] this quote
[1:42:12] we're nearly done here he says little
[1:42:14] shamgar looked
[1:42:17] and you know what
[1:42:19] he says I say this to you Holiness
[1:42:21] people
[1:42:22] his righteous indignation got up
[1:42:28] you know what I mean yes you know I seen
[1:42:30] a little sign one time I was walking
[1:42:32] into a football stadium to have a
[1:42:33] meeting there's a little sign up over
[1:42:35] the door that said it's not the size of
[1:42:37] the dog in the fight it's the size of
[1:42:39] the fight in the dog he says that's
[1:42:41] right brother he says that's right
[1:42:42] brother if you let the devil run over
[1:42:45] you he will just show you what size he
[1:42:48] is
[1:42:49] in other words he'll make himself as big
[1:42:51] as you let him make himself
[1:42:53] you sit there and listen to Satan talk
[1:42:55] he'll make himself way bigger than he
[1:42:57] actually is
[1:42:58] I remember when I was a kid a long long
[1:43:01] time ago and they used to have Looney
[1:43:02] Tunes and if we were out with Dad or
[1:43:03] something we watched Looney Tunes on
[1:43:05] Saturday morning and there was one where
[1:43:07] it was uh Bugs Bunny was the principal
[1:43:09] of the school and whenever anybody went
[1:43:11] into the into the principal's office
[1:43:13] then then this this monstrous principle
[1:43:16] was yelling and screaming at them and
[1:43:17] nobody wanted to go in there
[1:43:19] but when what happened was one day a
[1:43:21] student wasn't wasn't cowed by that
[1:43:25] and so they saw a little room to the
[1:43:27] side and they went and they looked in
[1:43:28] and there was Bugs Bunny standing in
[1:43:30] front of a projector
[1:43:32] and he was projecting himself onto a
[1:43:34] massive screen so that it transformed
[1:43:36] Bugs Bunny who was whatever this tall
[1:43:38] into a 30-foot demon
[1:43:41] basically you know the the the the
[1:43:42] rabbit from hell
[1:43:44] and the projector the light of that
[1:43:46] projector was making him appear way
[1:43:48] bigger than he was and as soon as that
[1:43:50] student went around and saw that it was
[1:43:51] bug's bunny that was projecting himself
[1:43:53] into this monstrous demon
[1:43:55] he didn't care what he was doing
[1:43:57] he'd seen him for what he was
[1:44:01] so he didn't care if he was screaming at
[1:44:02] him they was yelling at him that he was
[1:44:04] all these different things because he
[1:44:05] knew it was just a little bunny wabbit
[1:44:08] nothing to be scared of
[1:44:10] that's what brother Brandon's seen don't
[1:44:12] let the devil tell you how big he is you
[1:44:14] tell him how little he is scripture says
[1:44:16] at the end we're going to look narrowly
[1:44:18] on him and say is this the man
[1:44:20] is this the one that did it really
[1:44:23] remember that today when you're in the
[1:44:25] battle you're gonna look at him and he's
[1:44:26] going to be a little short cracker about
[1:44:28] yay high probably skinny little twerp
[1:44:30] little pencil neck tiny little biceps
[1:44:35] sunken in chest
[1:44:38] and you're going to say that's it
[1:44:40] that's what we're fighting today
[1:44:42] but what he's trying to do is he's
[1:44:44] trying to talk a big talk so that you
[1:44:45] don't get in a fight with him in the
[1:44:46] first place
[1:44:50] he says if you let the devil run over
[1:44:51] you he'll show you what size he is but
[1:44:53] you get a little grit yourself claim
[1:44:56] your god-given privileges in Jesus
[1:44:58] Christ and you'll Rejoice that's right
[1:45:02] I love this next one I started crying
[1:45:05] he says old shamgar stood there and his
[1:45:07] righteous indignation got up and here
[1:45:09] they was Trump trump big heavy armor
[1:45:12] what did he do he said I'm an Israelite
[1:45:15] I'm a Believer
[1:45:17] I've been circumcised in other words he
[1:45:20] says receive the Holy Ghost
[1:45:23] but listen to his next words I'm not a
[1:45:25] warrior
[1:45:26] I'm not a fighter
[1:45:28] I'm just a young person I'm just a
[1:45:31] housewife I'm just a new believer I'm
[1:45:34] just a new convert I've never won a
[1:45:36] victory before
[1:45:40] and there's nothing I can do
[1:45:45] he says only one I know one thing
[1:45:49] that's God's with me
[1:45:51] that's all I know
[1:45:53] and he reached up on the mantle and got
[1:45:55] an old Ox goat a little stick with a
[1:45:57] piece of brass on the end of it you
[1:45:59] punch the dirt off the flower bead and
[1:46:00] knocks to the gate with it it says he
[1:46:02] jumped out there under the power of the
[1:46:04] Holy Ghost knowing that he knew he had
[1:46:06] the right and slew 600 Philistines he
[1:46:09] says hallelujah that's right brother he
[1:46:11] was God's witness if God had led Moses
[1:46:14] if God had led the rest of them he was
[1:46:16] in Israelite just the same as they were
[1:46:19] Church whose family are you a part of
[1:46:21] tonight
[1:46:22] you're a part of the family of God you
[1:46:24] are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are
[1:46:26] the faith children of God
[1:46:29] he says if God did it for them it's good
[1:46:31] enough for me if I come from that
[1:46:33] lineage then I've got the same promise
[1:46:35] if they had the rights I've got the
[1:46:36] rights
[1:46:38] I said and I've got the sign in my body
[1:46:40] you got the Holy Ghost you got access to
[1:46:43] everything that Christ had you got the
[1:46:44] access to the things that brother
[1:46:45] Branham had it is yours because you're
[1:46:47] in the same lineage you're on the same
[1:46:49] family line that's right he says and
[1:46:51] Mister you sitting in the wheelchair you
[1:46:53] in the Cod you here are back you under
[1:46:55] wherever you are if you're born of the
[1:46:57] spirit of God you got just as much right
[1:47:00] to rise from that chair and wheelchair
[1:47:01] tonight as any other man is you're born
[1:47:04] again he says get a little grit about
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:08] stand up and Jesus Christ standing here
[1:47:10] in his word proving what he is showing
[1:47:13] signs wonders miracles of his
[1:47:14] resurrection he says what more do you
[1:47:16] want
[1:47:17] he said shamgar's righteous indignation
[1:47:20] got worked up Church when's the last
[1:47:22] time our righteous indignation got
[1:47:24] worked up and we said enough's enough
[1:47:27] is enough
[1:47:29] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:47:31] sick and tired of sniffling day all in
[1:47:34] day in and day out sick and tired of not
[1:47:36] sleeping sick and tired of a besetting
[1:47:38] sin sick and tired of family issues sick
[1:47:40] and tired of this sick and tired of that
[1:47:42] why because the word says I don't have
[1:47:44] to keep it in my life anymore
[1:47:46] because the word says I'm supposed to
[1:47:48] have it and I don't have it that's when
[1:47:50] our righteous indignation ought to be
[1:47:51] worked up church is when he says it's
[1:47:53] supposed to be ours
[1:47:56] not when someone says something we don't
[1:47:58] like not when somebody offends us not
[1:48:00] when somebody ignores us that's not what
[1:48:02] gets our righteous indignation worked up
[1:48:03] our righteous indignation is for things
[1:48:05] that are righteous of God Amen not to
[1:48:09] preserve our dignity or or the facade of
[1:48:11] our outward appearance no no no
[1:48:12] righteous indignation is for the things
[1:48:14] that God has said Belong To You amen
[1:48:17] when's the last time we got indignant
[1:48:19] because of that Satan standing on our
[1:48:20] property rather than somebody said
[1:48:22] something about us
[1:48:24] did something we didn't like that's
[1:48:26] that's a waste of our righteous
[1:48:27] indignation Church
[1:48:28] let's get mad at Satan
[1:48:31] let's focus on what he's doing because
[1:48:32] so often what happens we get caught up
[1:48:34] in the little petty things of life and
[1:48:36] family and all these different things
[1:48:37] and meanwhile Satan's sitting on our
[1:48:39] couch eating our storm chips
[1:48:42] and he's just sitting there laughing at
[1:48:43] us because he's taken the joy out of our
[1:48:45] life he's taken the rest out of our life
[1:48:46] he's taken the peace out of our life and
[1:48:48] we don't have healing and we don't have
[1:48:50] the Holy Ghost moving in our life and
[1:48:52] we've lost Direction and all these
[1:48:53] things he's just sitting there laughing
[1:48:54] because we're fighting the things that
[1:48:55] don't matter
[1:48:58] what's gotten our indignation up our
[1:49:01] righteous indignation up amen
[1:49:04] I think it was brother Matt was telling
[1:49:05] me brother Ron Spencer preached on
[1:49:06] shamgar and he said something along the
[1:49:08] lines of he says the Philistines left
[1:49:10] enough every year for shamgar to survive
[1:49:12] and plant the next crop
[1:49:14] but they never left enough for him to
[1:49:16] get ahead or to enjoy the true benefits
[1:49:18] of what he had
[1:49:19] he did all the work and all he got was
[1:49:22] enough to take him through another year
[1:49:24] skimp through make it by the skin of his
[1:49:26] teeth year after year after year
[1:49:28] remember brother Brown says the Church
[1:49:29] of the Living God is living below her
[1:49:30] privileges
[1:49:32] I think it's because our indignation's
[1:49:34] gotten up about things that don't matter
[1:49:37] and we're not fighting the good fight
[1:49:38] for the things that do matter
[1:49:41] amen
[1:49:44] brother Brian said shamgar one day he
[1:49:46] had enough
[1:49:47] he said I know who I am
[1:49:49] and I know what comes with it
[1:49:51] he says that I'm going out there and
[1:49:53] whether I die
[1:49:54] or whether I live at least one
[1:49:56] Philistine is going to know he shouldn't
[1:49:57] have stepped on my property today
[1:49:59] and one by one by one he killed 600
[1:50:02] Philistines who for
[1:50:05] to make a great name for himself to be
[1:50:07] known as shamgar the Great
[1:50:10] he did it for his family
[1:50:13] he was fighting in his own backyard
[1:50:16] for the souls and for the the well-being
[1:50:18] and the health and the preservation of
[1:50:20] his family
[1:50:22] church that's where we ought to be
[1:50:24] fighting
[1:50:25] first in our own homes
[1:50:27] and then in this home
[1:50:28] because this is the body
[1:50:30] and listen if you got time after that
[1:50:32] then we got plenty of prayer requests
[1:50:33] from outside this local body for you to
[1:50:35] pray about and put your time into in
[1:50:36] these different things amen but shamgar
[1:50:38] got to the place where he realized who
[1:50:41] he was and what benefits came with that
[1:50:43] position
[1:50:45] he got a revelation of who he was
[1:50:48] remember that's that's the greatest
[1:50:49] Revelation the bride's going to have
[1:50:50] because when that happens as the prophet
[1:50:52] said the Rapture will go
[1:50:54] he got a revelation you know what that
[1:50:55] did that took shamgar out of religion
[1:50:57] and into relationship
[1:51:00] into a real Revelation what it meant it
[1:51:02] took him out of just talking about it to
[1:51:04] be in it
[1:51:06] to experiencing it in his day-to-day
[1:51:07] life amen
[1:51:09] listen he didn't just have doctrine that
[1:51:11] day he had overcoming power
[1:51:13] he had the Holy Spirit moving in him and
[1:51:16] it didn't matter what he used
[1:51:18] he picked up what he had available to
[1:51:20] him listen you go up against swords with
[1:51:22] an ox code sword wins every time
[1:51:25] Naturally Speaking you put it up against
[1:51:27] Spears and Shields and thick armor and
[1:51:29] that what's an ox go going to do but
[1:51:31] that's what he had next to him and God
[1:51:32] blessed what he had next to him when he
[1:51:34] turned in righteous indignation and he
[1:51:36] turned it on the ones that were holding
[1:51:37] them back from his promise
[1:51:39] shamgar wasn't Supernatural
[1:51:42] that Ox goat was Supernatural
[1:51:46] God preserved him through the whole
[1:51:48] thing
[1:51:49] LeBron would say this he says now the
[1:51:51] word of God is a sword Hebrews 4 12. he
[1:51:53] says and a sword is perfectly dormant if
[1:51:57] it isn't yielded by a hand or a power
[1:51:59] now we don't use swords anymore we use
[1:52:01] guns but had gone up on the wall is
[1:52:05] completely dormant a gun has never
[1:52:07] killed anybody
[1:52:10] people with guns
[1:52:12] kill people a gun is dormant sitting
[1:52:14] there on the Shelf
[1:52:16] he says the sword is the same way the
[1:52:17] word of God is the same way you leave it
[1:52:19] sitting here it won't do a thing for you
[1:52:22] you can say you can believe it you can
[1:52:24] identify with it you can come here and
[1:52:25] hear the preaching of the word but he
[1:52:26] says it's dormant unless it's yielded by
[1:52:29] a hand or a power but it takes a hand to
[1:52:31] hold the Sword and the hand that holds a
[1:52:33] sword is the hand of Faith now that hand
[1:52:35] of faith it depends on how strong it is
[1:52:37] you look at these big swords they had in
[1:52:40] the medieval times and these things
[1:52:41] require two hands to hold them these
[1:52:43] things were five and six feet long
[1:52:46] you didn't just swing that with a little
[1:52:47] puny wrist
[1:52:49] you had to have real arms and real hands
[1:52:52] of a power to hold a sword like that and
[1:52:54] to use it effectively he says the word
[1:52:55] of God is the same thing the hand of
[1:52:57] faith it depends how strong it is this
[1:52:59] hand of Faith might just be strong
[1:53:00] enough to cut a little hole through the
[1:53:02] darkness and say by faith I'm saved
[1:53:05] that's a great cup but then if that's
[1:53:07] all the strength that hand has to yield
[1:53:08] that sword then that's all it can cut
[1:53:10] but if it's a strong hand it'll cut Plum
[1:53:13] through everything the devil can put out
[1:53:15] there make every promise of God shine
[1:53:18] forth in the power of his resurrection
[1:53:20] if it's a strong hand of Faith the days
[1:53:22] of Miracles Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:24] yesterday and forever Cuts its way
[1:53:27] through he says it depends on the power
[1:53:29] of the hand that yields that's behind
[1:53:31] the sword
[1:53:33] and the sword he says is plenty Sharp
[1:53:36] in other words
[1:53:37] there's nothing wrong
[1:53:39] with the weapon
[1:53:41] scripture says the the word of God is
[1:53:43] sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:53:46] right cutting the sun even to the
[1:53:48] asunder of bone and mirror and the
[1:53:50] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:53:51] the heart problem is not the weapon
[1:53:54] yo you get these snipers and they've got
[1:53:56] these these weapons and they're dialed
[1:53:58] in perfectly now I go out there and I
[1:54:00] use it and I'd probably start putting it
[1:54:01] all over the place and I'd say there's
[1:54:02] something wrong with your gun but the
[1:54:04] guy that just put three bullets in the
[1:54:05] same hole would say it ain't the gun
[1:54:07] buddy it's you
[1:54:08] you got to learn how to handle it
[1:54:11] he says the sword is plenty sharp
[1:54:12] Hebrews 4 said it's sharper than a
[1:54:14] two-edged sword that cuts both coming
[1:54:16] and going even to the marrow the bone
[1:54:17] and in the joints of Discerning the
[1:54:19] thoughts of the heart it goes beyond the
[1:54:21] physical it goes into the spiritual
[1:54:23] realm and picks up the thoughts of the
[1:54:25] heart and reveals him the spirit of God
[1:54:27] the word of God now that word will cut
[1:54:29] in there if there's enough arm behind it
[1:54:32] to push it in it'll find its place and
[1:54:35] cut out every promise and give it to you
[1:54:37] if you just got the strong arm enough
[1:54:40] strong enough arm behind it brother
[1:54:43] Brown doesn't read this I put this in
[1:54:45] there in second Corinthians it says for
[1:54:46] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:54:48] warn the flesh
[1:54:50] see so often we get the issues whether
[1:54:52] it's it's issues with sickness and these
[1:54:54] different things and we think it's all
[1:54:55] about us it's it's in this natural world
[1:54:57] Paul's saying listen you're not fighting
[1:54:59] against flesh and blood
[1:55:01] he says for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:55:03] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[1:55:06] the pulling down of strongholds I want
[1:55:08] to mention two things here it can't be
[1:55:10] our weapon if it's not being used in our
[1:55:12] war
[1:55:13] if you don't use it you can't say the
[1:55:16] weapon's no good
[1:55:17] so if you're using a different weapon
[1:55:19] than what God's given you and it ain't
[1:55:20] working don't blame the weapons that God
[1:55:22] has that you're not using you've got to
[1:55:23] take his weapon in your hand but the
[1:55:26] next thing it says is that the weapons
[1:55:27] are mighty
[1:55:28] do you ever notice that
[1:55:30] he didn't say we're mighty
[1:55:34] he said the weapons are mighty
[1:55:36] it's not me that makes this powerful in
[1:55:39] and of itself
[1:55:40] the weapons Mighty as long as I've got
[1:55:43] faith to swing it
[1:55:45] so my faith is what's going to move it
[1:55:48] but it's the strength of that weapon
[1:55:49] that makes it cut it's the edge that's
[1:55:51] on it and that's not of my making that's
[1:55:52] of God's making
[1:55:54] listen look at Gideon what was Gideon's
[1:55:57] weapon
[1:55:58] trumpets
[1:55:59] and flames in pictures
[1:56:02] why because that wasn't Gideon's weapon
[1:56:04] Gideon's weapon was obedience
[1:56:06] that simple
[1:56:08] time and time again he obeyed and when
[1:56:10] Gideon obeyed less and less people
[1:56:12] followed less and less people were part
[1:56:14] of his army until the end he only had
[1:56:16] 300. he went from tens of thousands down
[1:56:19] to 300 in obedience and then God used
[1:56:22] them
[1:56:23] and they didn't even have to really
[1:56:24] fight
[1:56:25] they just had to break down those
[1:56:26] pictures wave the the the the the the
[1:56:29] Torches and blow the trumpet and say the
[1:56:32] sword of the Lord and Gideon and all of
[1:56:34] a sudden the enemy started killing
[1:56:35] themselves
[1:56:36] Gideon's weapon was obedience to the
[1:56:38] word of God and God used him then to do
[1:56:40] the rest
[1:56:42] but the first thing he had to do was
[1:56:43] obey
[1:56:44] brother Brian will continue it says the
[1:56:45] sword pick it up in an arm of Faith grip
[1:56:48] it tight hold on to it and walk into the
[1:56:50] face of the enemy how can that
[1:56:52] uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the
[1:56:54] presence of the Eternal God
[1:56:57] not your presence
[1:56:59] the big papa bear behind you
[1:57:01] the almighty God that says I'm going to
[1:57:03] go forward ahead of you and I'm going to
[1:57:05] send hornets and I'm going to send fear
[1:57:06] and I'm going to make them scared before
[1:57:07] you even get there that's who they're
[1:57:09] going to be scared of that's who's going
[1:57:11] to bring the victory
[1:57:12] so he says you take the sword of the
[1:57:14] word and every promise belongs to you
[1:57:16] pick it up in a strong hand of faith and
[1:57:18] walk forward if you need healing cut it
[1:57:21] out with the word Jesus Christ the same
[1:57:23] yesterday today and forever if you need
[1:57:24] salvation every promise in the book is
[1:57:27] yours it's laying back in there and
[1:57:29] Satan's trying to hide it but take the
[1:57:32] sword and push through the darkness
[1:57:33] until the light of God shines in upon
[1:57:35] your soul and you have the promise
[1:57:39] he says
[1:57:40] notice it says you're holding the sword
[1:57:43] but God's performing the work you're
[1:57:45] swinging it but God's making it
[1:57:46] effective
[1:57:49] I don't know if any of you have ever
[1:57:51] played with a young child that's got a
[1:57:52] hockey stick in their hands
[1:57:54] or a baseball bat
[1:57:56] or a Nerf gun
[1:57:59] you can't beat a child like that because
[1:58:01] they're completely unpredictable
[1:58:05] it's just you you can't or if you have a
[1:58:09] toy sword that's even worse because
[1:58:10] there's no Rhyme or Reason to what they
[1:58:11] do they just flail around and you you
[1:58:13] know they don't go by the the
[1:58:15] gentlemanly conduct of play swords
[1:58:17] they're just trying to hit you
[1:58:19] and they do hit you and you always have
[1:58:21] to give them the the sword that's made
[1:58:23] of wood while you take the plastic one
[1:58:24] or the foam one or whatever so they wrap
[1:58:26] you on the knuckles and they wrap you on
[1:58:27] the ankles and whatnot they're not
[1:58:29] beating you because you can't beat them
[1:58:32] they're beating you because what you're
[1:58:34] not allowed to hurt them
[1:58:36] that's the way it is with God
[1:58:38] you got a little child swinging a big
[1:58:40] sword and Satan's not allowed to kill
[1:58:42] you
[1:58:43] so he's just trying to get out alive and
[1:58:45] all you gotta do is keep swinging the
[1:58:46] sword the sword is effective because
[1:58:48] you're swinging it but God's making the
[1:58:50] sword do the work
[1:58:52] if I'm fighting with Samuel with swords
[1:58:54] in myself I could kill him I could hurt
[1:58:57] him anytime
[1:58:58] but I don't hurt him out of love
[1:59:00] Satan can't hurt us because God won't
[1:59:02] let him
[1:59:04] he's blocking everything Satan does and
[1:59:05] he says go for his ankles chop them down
[1:59:07] wrap them on the knuckles make them howl
[1:59:09] make them pay
[1:59:11] make him not want to come back again
[1:59:13] God's the one that's blocking all of his
[1:59:15] blows and letting yours slide through
[1:59:16] his guard time and time and time again
[1:59:18] until he falls over shamgar had an ox
[1:59:21] goat that was the weapon God gave him
[1:59:23] and God made that weapon prosper
[1:59:25] that simple brother I'm saying there
[1:59:27] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:59:29] and forever that scripture will get you
[1:59:31] every promise in the book
[1:59:33] Hebrews 13 8. just keep using it and
[1:59:36] saying you said it Lord and I'm
[1:59:38] believing it and that's it and just keep
[1:59:41] swinging
[1:59:42] just keep swinging just keep swinging
[1:59:44] don't worry I don't know how to fight
[1:59:46] don't worry I've never used a sword
[1:59:47] before just keep swinging it and God
[1:59:49] will bring the results amen he says
[1:59:51] it'll cut through anything Satan puts in
[1:59:53] front of you anything
[1:59:57] but you got to trust it brother Brad
[1:59:58] would say if Satan can get you to doubt
[2:00:00] your weapon that's when he defeats you
[2:00:03] so don't stop because you're not seeing
[2:00:05] the results because sometimes it takes a
[2:00:07] while but the results will come if you
[2:00:09] stick with it
[2:00:10] scripture says lean not on your own
[2:00:12] understanding amen
[2:00:15] Paul would finish this with Timothy
[2:00:17] so he's telling Timothy says you got to
[2:00:20] fight the good fight Timothy you got to
[2:00:22] war a good Warfare and then at the end
[2:00:23] he comes and he says I have fought a
[2:00:26] good fight
[2:00:27] I have finished my course I have kept
[2:00:30] the faith notice what is it that is the
[2:00:32] good fight for Paul
[2:00:33] he fought for the right things he fought
[2:00:35] to obey God he fought to be a reflection
[2:00:37] of Christ he's fought until he's
[2:00:39] finished the work that God had for him
[2:00:41] on this Earth he says that's it I'm done
[2:00:43] I'm going to go out he says there's now
[2:00:45] a crown of crown of righteousness laid
[2:00:47] up for me I'm good to go
[2:00:49] I have no more need to fight anymore
[2:00:51] if they kill me if they let me live it
[2:00:53] doesn't matter I've done my part and so
[2:00:55] he was happy to go and you'll find that
[2:00:57] so often with with Believers is when
[2:00:59] they're done their work God takes them
[2:01:01] home because there's no rest here
[2:01:03] there's no peace here that's all waiting
[2:01:05] for them so he says when you're done I
[2:01:06] just want to get you home so you can
[2:01:07] actually get your reward so you can
[2:01:10] relax a bit so you can sit back and
[2:01:12] enjoy the things that God has in store
[2:01:13] for them to love him
[2:01:17] but this fight for Paul what was it it
[2:01:19] was a lasting overcoming faith that took
[2:01:21] him all the way willingly into death in
[2:01:24] Caesar's Court
[2:01:26] through it all God had the supernatural
[2:01:28] God made him a preacher a preachers a
[2:01:30] prophet of prophets a prophet to the age
[2:01:32] listen we're still reading his words
[2:01:34] today
[2:01:35] that's how good his fight was
[2:01:38] that he found the will of God and he
[2:01:39] stayed with it no matter what came his
[2:01:41] way in weakness
[2:01:44] in issues with his health
[2:01:46] conscience problems all these different

[2:02:00] to love me
[2:02:02] and if we love the Lord we'll feel that

[2:02:29] see all of that sitting there I look
[2:02:31] across the table and I say well God

[2:02:46] majesty he'll walk down among all of us
[2:02:49] and put his arms around us and say

[2:06:39] right things
[2:06:40] Lord but Satan's greatest weapon I think
[2:06:43] so many times is distraction
[2:06:45] Lord is to get us focused on the little
[2:06:47] things that don't matter while keeping
[2:06:49] our eyes off of the great things that
[2:06:50] you promised to us Heavenly Father Lord
[2:06:52] we know we're in a time of manifestation
[2:06:54] Lord everything that can be shaken will
[2:06:57] be shaken Lord and only that which is of
[2:07:00] Christ that only that which is eternal
[2:07:01] is going to stand Lord would you help us
[2:07:04] to fight for things that are Eternal and
[2:07:05] let the rest of it be shaken off

[2:07:10] us lay hold of the purpose and plan and
[2:07:11] will of God Lord let us seek after that
[2:07:14] Lord let our fight be for the things of
[2:07:16] God lord for the good things that you've
[2:07:18] laid in your word Lord and let us not
[2:07:20] let go until you've given us what you
[2:07:22] promised Lord May our names be written
[2:07:25] like those in that Hebrews book or
[2:07:27] chapter 11 Lord that that chapter of
