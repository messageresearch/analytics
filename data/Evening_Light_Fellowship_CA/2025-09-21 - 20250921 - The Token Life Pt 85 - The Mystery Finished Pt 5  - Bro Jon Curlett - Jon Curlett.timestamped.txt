[20:57] with me.
[21:00] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[21:04] had no peace within. Till I heard Jesus
[21:08] died upon the tree.
[21:12] Then I fell down at his feet. And there
[21:15] came a beast so sweet. Now the comforter
[21:20] abides with me.

[22:36] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago
[22:40] I gave them up and instantly
[22:45] all my night was turned to day. All my
[22:48] burdens rolled away. Now the comforter
[22:52] abides with me.

[39:16] Keeps us walking with you day by day,
[39:18] heavenly father.
[39:21] Lord, we're objects of your grace. We're
[39:22] objects of your mercy this morning,
[39:24] Lord. Without you, we can do nothing.
[39:27] Lord, there's nothing good in ourselves
[39:28] that would draw us to you except you
[39:30] drew us first, heavenly father. Lord,
[39:32] we're thankful for it this morning,
[39:34] Lord. We want to worship and praise you
[39:35] this morning, Lord, for the call you
[39:37] placed in our life, Lord, that we could
[39:39] be sons and daughters of God. And Lord,
[39:41] we're going to hear about it again this
[39:43] morning, Lord. And we're asking you to
[39:44] just open your word, Lord, to just
[39:47] anchor in our souls just a little bit
[39:48] more, Lord, who we are and what you're
[39:50] trying to do with our lives, Lord, in
[39:52] this last stage. Lord, I pray you open
[39:54] your word, Lord. Speak to your bride
[39:56] that's gathered here tonight, Lord. May
[39:58] it draw us closer to you, Lord. May it
[40:00] separate us from the things of the
[40:02] world, Lord. May it help Christ to just
[40:04] be revealed in us in a greater way
[40:06] today. We pray. Lord, give us strength.
[40:08] Give us overcoming power, Lord, for
[40:11] every every situation, for every
[40:13] circumstance in our life, Lord. Help us
[40:15] to seek after you day by day. We ask,
[40:18] Lord God, in Jesus name, we're asking
[40:20] it. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Turn
[40:23] if you would. Revelation 10. Revelation
[40:27] chapter 10 and verse 7. Amen. Good to
[40:29] see everyone here this morning. Good to
[40:31] see some sunshine outside today. I saw
[40:34] that we set the record for most days
[40:36] above 20° a couple days ago in a single
[40:40] year in Newfoundland and then we broke
[40:42] it yet again. So we've got 81 days of
[40:44] 20° or hotter. I think the unfortunate
[40:47] thing is we got them all almost in a row
[40:48] with no rain and so we got all those
[40:50] wildfires with it. But uh thankful for
[40:52] it. Amen. Thankful for some warm weather
[40:55] and some sunshine later into the fall
[40:56] the way we have it here. Amen. Just uh
[40:59] one announcement, of course, I'll be
[41:00] leaving on Thursday, headed down to the
[41:02] United States for the men's meetings
[41:03] with brother Barry Coffee. So, uh,
[41:06] Brother Joe will be going with me as
[41:07] well. So, we'll leave Brother Matt to to
[41:09] hold down the fort and I think Brother
[41:11] Mark is also going to be holding down
[41:12] the fort on song leading. Amen. On
[41:14] Sunday, so just pray for them that God
[41:16] will be with them each one. We're going
[41:18] to have Brother Gideon Gunnawan from
[41:19] Brother Jerry Fury's church in Alberta.
[41:21] We'll preach for us, preach for you, I
[41:23] should say, on Sunday. And then I'll be
[41:25] back for the Wednesday service. Then I'm
[41:26] leaving again on Thursday to go to uh
[41:29] British Columbia for a family reunion
[41:32] there. And so we'll have sorry we will
[41:34] have brother Carmen Mills this weekend.
[41:36] Not brother Gideon Gunnawan. Brother
[41:37] Gideon will come the weekend after while
[41:39] I'm in British Columbia. And so we've
[41:42] got just a number of men lined up for us
[41:44] there. So remember them. It'll be
[41:45] brother Carmen Mills this weekend. And
[41:47] then brother Gideon after that. Amen.
[41:49] And then I'll have brother Garfield,
[41:51] Lord willing, preach the Wednesday right
[41:52] after I get back in October. I think
[41:54] that'll be the 8th. Brother Garfield, if
[41:56] that works for you. Amen. And then I'll
[41:59] be leaving again in November, the first
[42:00] week of November for work. I fly out
[42:02] unfortunately first thing Sunday
[42:04] morning. Usually I'm able to get a
[42:05] flight out in the afternoon, but I
[42:07] wasn't. So I'll uh I'll see who we'll
[42:10] have to minister for that. But I've been
[42:12] home for so long and then I'm gone for
[42:14] just jammed into basically six weeks.
[42:16] I'm gone for for uh three separate
[42:18] trips. So just praying the Lord will be
[42:20] with me. Amen. I'm certainly looking
[42:22] forward to a break and uh some
[42:24] fellowship with some brothers. I haven't
[42:25] seen in a long time. Amen. So, just uh
[42:28] trusting God will be good to you guys
[42:30] here while I'm away. Revelation 10:7.
[42:33] We've read this many times. We'll read
[42:35] it one last time in the service. Says,
[42:38] "But in the days of the voice of the
[42:40] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[42:42] sound, the mystery of God should be
[42:44] finished as he had declared to his
[42:46] servants the prophets." Amen. God bless
[42:48] you. You can have your seats again this
[42:50] morning. We're back to our final thought
[42:53] on on uh the series on the Holy Ghost.
[42:55] And my clicker is not working there.
[42:57] Selena, if you can help me out. Amen.
[42:59] But I want to take another title on the
[43:01] the mystery finish. This is our fifth
[43:03] part, I believe. And I'm looking ahead
[43:05] to the finish line on this service. And
[43:07] there's some other things I'm looking
[43:09] forward to preaching that the Lord has
[43:10] laid on my heart. What I was telling
[43:11] brother Garfield the other day, I said,
[43:13] I I study and I I prepare my notes for
[43:15] the service and and I've got 50 pages of
[43:18] notes. And then when I'm done and I come
[43:19] back the next time, I've got almost 50
[43:20] pages of notes. And then I finish that
[43:22] and I've still got 50 pages of notes.
[43:24] Amen. And so, as a pastor, as I pray and
[43:27] I study, things just tend to open up and
[43:28] you just keep adding to what you what
[43:30] you understand and what you see and it's
[43:32] just more and more and more. And so,
[43:34] really, you could you could take I was I
[43:36] was telling brother Mark, I think it was
[43:37] you could take one scripture and you
[43:38] could preach on it all service. Then you
[43:40] just take one more and you preach on at
[43:41] all service. And you'd still have stuff
[43:42] left over to preach on. So I'm thankful
[43:44] we're not running out of things. There
[43:46] was a preacher one time said, "I'm" He
[43:48] says, "I've run out of things to
[43:49] preach." I almost wish I had that
[43:51] problem. I've got too many things that
[43:53] you want to preach as you get into the
[43:54] Bible. Amen. But I'm I'm glad that we've
[43:56] got a word that opens up to us as we
[43:58] spend more time in it as we dwell on
[44:00] these different things. And you know, I
[44:02] I think it's good that we have more
[44:04] things opening up that we don't just
[44:05] have a period behind this is what I see
[44:07] today. This is what I understand that
[44:09] our services aren't predictable. You
[44:11] know, there's some churches you go to
[44:12] and if they're having special meetings,
[44:14] you know exactly what they're going to
[44:15] preach on every single time cuz they've
[44:17] got such a limited box of understanding.
[44:19] Their dogmas have put them into this
[44:21] this this cage of doctrine and theology.
[44:23] And so they preach all those things and
[44:25] it's the same things over and over
[44:26] again. But I believe that this Holy
[44:28] Spirit's here to open up his word
[44:30] continually. Amen. That what I
[44:32] understand today and then what I
[44:34] understand tomorrow will be just a
[44:35] little bit more. It'll take me a little
[44:36] bit higher. it'll draw me a little
[44:38] further away from the word of God. Amen.
[44:40] Because we know the Holy Spirit's here
[44:41] to get us into position for a
[44:44] resurrection and a rapture. Amen. That's
[44:46] what he's trying to do. And we spent the
[44:47] last five services talking about the
[44:50] ministry of Malachi 4, this end time
[44:52] prophet that was foretold to come and
[44:54] restore all things, restore us back to
[44:56] the original word, restore us back to
[44:58] the original faith. Amen. And I've hope
[45:00] we've settled in our minds that God
[45:01] promised a prophet and God sent a
[45:04] prophet. Amen. And that's what we preach
[45:06] here is the the truth as he's pointed us
[45:08] back to the word of God. And we've got
[45:10] to see that prophet's own process and
[45:13] preparation because he didn't come as a
[45:15] as a prophet fully prepared to do what
[45:17] God wanted him to do. But he just
[45:19] started out in obedience and then God
[45:21] took him to his first stage and his
[45:22] second stage and his third stage. And he
[45:24] took it one step at a time, church.
[45:26] That's all God's asking us to do this
[45:28] morning. Take it one step at a time. as
[45:30] he opens up his word to you, as he shows
[45:32] you what he wants to do. He says, "Just
[45:34] take that step." Lord, what am I going
[45:35] to do after that? Doesn't matter. Take
[45:37] the step. Once you take the step, then
[45:39] he'll show you where you to go for the
[45:40] next step. And the light will open up as
[45:42] you move forward in these things. And we
[45:44] saw this prophet. And you know, in the
[45:46] scriptures, we don't we don't really get
[45:48] to see too much of the development of a
[45:50] prophet. We don't get to see too much in
[45:51] the development of a ministry. We see it
[45:53] a little bit certainly in the disciples.
[45:56] We see it a little bit in Paul, but we
[45:58] haven't really gone from birth to death
[46:00] of a prophet in a way that we got to see
[46:02] in this age. And we got to see all of
[46:04] his personal failures, didn't we? We got
[46:06] to see that he he never failed in
[46:09] doctrine. But he failed in his in his
[46:11] his understanding. He failed in his
[46:13] obedience. He failed in using the gift
[46:16] of God to cater to the people. If you
[46:18] remember, where he was using those signs
[46:20] and wonders because the people wanted
[46:21] him to rather than the Holy Spirit was
[46:23] leading him to do it. And all it was
[46:25] showing us, church, is that that prophet
[46:27] was still just a man. Amen. Every
[46:29] minister is still just a man. We're the
[46:32] same as you. Amen. We've still got the
[46:34] same problems. Every minister faces
[46:36] three temptations. It's popularity,
[46:38] women, and money.
[46:41] And we've all got to face them. And
[46:42] we've all got to to take that attack in
[46:44] our our lives. And we saw it in that
[46:46] prophet's life where people said, "Well,
[46:48] if you'll if you'll stop preaching what
[46:49] you're preaching, then we'll support
[46:50] your campaigns. And if you don't do
[46:52] this, then we're going to do that. and
[46:53] if you'll do this then we'll do that.
[46:55] But remember what the scripture says
[46:57] about Elijah. James says this. He says
[46:59] Elijah was a man subject to like
[47:01] passions as we are. The common English
[47:03] Bible says Elijah was a person just like
[47:05] us. And that's the simple truth is that
[47:08] when we look at brother Brandham's life,
[47:10] we look at William Brandham's life, we
[47:12] see that he was just a man like us. But
[47:15] he had a calling to be a prophet. And
[47:17] that was the difference. But otherwise
[47:19] and all those things and he would even
[47:21] say it about himself. He would talk
[47:22] about his own failures. He would talk
[47:24] about when he disobeyed the spirit of
[47:26] God that told him to go to the
[47:27] Pentecostal people. And because his
[47:29] mother-in-law turned, he she said,
[47:31] "You're not going to take my daughter to
[47:33] be with those holy rollers." And so, he
[47:34] refused what God told him to do. And
[47:36] what did God do? God took his wife's
[47:38] life and his daughter's life. Why?
[47:41] Because he disobeyed. But brother
[47:42] Brandon would say this about himself. He
[47:44] says, "I'm ready to stand to my
[47:46] commission." He says, "I've loved
[47:48] people. I've catered to them." This was
[47:49] his weakness. Remember, he was so
[47:51] rejected as a young man that he just
[47:53] loved having people to like him. He
[47:55] loved having friends. He loved to have
[47:57] people accept him. He says, "I've
[47:59] catered to them." And he's met me vision
[48:01] after vision, which I don't have time to
[48:03] tell. And he says, you know, it's wrote
[48:04] right there on the backs of those books
[48:06] saying, "You're catering too much to the
[48:08] people." He said, "To walk with me,
[48:11] you'll walk alone. You're putting too
[48:14] much emphasis on those signs.
[48:18] I'm not a prophet this morning, but let
[48:20] me tell you, to walk this Christian
[48:22] walk, you've got to be willing to walk
[48:25] alone. You've got to be willing to walk
[48:28] alone. Amen. And you've got to be
[48:30] willing to let other people
[48:31] misunderstand you. You've got to let
[48:34] other people talk badly about you.
[48:36] You've got to be willing to let
[48:38] opportunities go. You've got to be
[48:40] willing to let money go. You got to be
[48:41] willing to let influence go. You've got
[48:44] to be willing to let everyone walk away
[48:46] from you and still stay with Christ.
[48:50] That's the requirement. Amen. You've got
[48:51] to be willing to be misunderstood.
[48:53] There's a price to pay for serving
[48:55] Christ. Amen. And you've got to be able
[48:57] to stand alone. But brother but brother
[48:59] Brandon was being prepared for his
[49:01] ultimate ministry. Those signs and
[49:03] wonders were just pointing to something.
[49:05] And we read in our opening scripture
[49:07] what his ultimate purpose was. in the
[49:09] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[49:11] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[49:14] of God should be finished as he had
[49:16] declared to his pro servants the
[49:19] prophet. So brother Bram's ministry of
[49:20] signs and wonders and discernment was
[49:23] just paving the way for something else.
[49:26] It was just catching the people's
[49:27] attention. We'd say it was the bait on
[49:29] the hook. You're trying to catch the
[49:31] fish. Amen. But there were many men that
[49:33] had great signs and wonders. You look at
[49:35] Oral Roberts. Go look him up on YouTube.
[49:38] You'll see Oral Roberts there and he'll
[49:39] pray for people that are completely
[49:41] diseased and they'll be healed in a
[49:42] moment. That was not exclusive to
[49:44] brother Brandham. He started that
[49:46] healing ministry really. That was a wave
[49:48] that came out of his ministry. But you
[49:50] saw Oral Roberts go through. But what
[49:52] didn't he have? He didn't have
[49:52] discernment. He had to read the prayer
[49:55] cards. Brother Brandon would know it
[49:56] before they ever walked up. They were
[49:58] just standing there and he would discern
[50:00] it. And that's why I showed those videos
[50:01] in the last service. You look at a All
[50:03] and just yesterday I was watching some
[50:04] of the videos on AA and he brings a
[50:06] colored woman up and he says, "Oh, I see
[50:09] here." He says, "You've got a problem
[50:10] with your voice. You can't sing."
[50:13] He says, "And you want to sing?" He
[50:15] said, "What song would you sing if you
[50:19] could get your voice back?"
[50:21] And she get she just she she spoke out
[50:23] what it was and I forget what it was. He
[50:24] told the organist, he says, "Do you know
[50:26] how to play that? You can can you play
[50:28] that?" He says, "Because she's about to
[50:29] sing it." And then he lays her hand on
[50:32] her and he prays for her and then he
[50:34] says, "Sing your song." And he gives her
[50:36] the mic and she sings a song right then
[50:37] and there. What was it? It was a great
[50:39] healing ministry. It was signs and
[50:41] wonders. But you look at those men and
[50:43] what happened after that?
[50:46] What happened to the people? What
[50:48] happened to their ministries?
[50:50] Nothing. Because all they had were signs
[50:53] and wonders. The signs are supposed to
[50:56] point to something. They're supposed to
[50:58] point to an end goal. And they had
[51:00] nothing to point the people to. They had
[51:02] great faith. And I say, Lord, we need
[51:04] more great faith. But your faith has to
[51:07] take you to something, not just a
[51:08] temporary healing of this body. That
[51:10] woman that got her voice back still
[51:12] died. These people that have wonderful
[51:15] healing still died, but it was to take
[51:17] us into something that was beyond this
[51:19] life. Amen. And what happened? Alen, I
[51:21] believe, died an alcoholic.
[51:23] Great signs and wonders, but died an
[51:25] alcoholic. Oral Roberts walked away from
[51:28] his religion and chose another for the
[51:29] sake of popularity.
[51:32] Great ministries, but they had nothing
[51:34] to take the people to. It was so signs
[51:37] that pointed to nothing. It pointed to
[51:39] the men, unfortunately, was what
[51:40] happened. And those men broke down under
[51:42] the weight of their own success. Amen.
[51:46] But God had one man that was ordained to
[51:48] speak to this age. And that man would
[51:50] speak as the Holy Spirit gave him
[51:52] utterance. He would preach thus saith
[51:54] the Lord or else he would stay silent.
[51:57] Amen. Only one man was said to be the
[51:59] voice of the Holy Spirit in this age and
[52:01] it was William Brham. It was the seventh
[52:03] church angel's message. Amen. The
[52:05] scripture says in the days of the voice,
[52:08] the voice singular. There's only one
[52:10] voice. There's only one message that
[52:11] comes to that church. Amen. And I've
[52:13] said it before. It says it says the
[52:15] mystery of God should be finished. That
[52:17] word should in the original does not
[52:18] mean should like we do in English. We
[52:20] think should leaves a little bit of room
[52:22] open. I say you should eat healthy.
[52:26] Well, it's truth, but you don't have to
[52:28] do it if I say should.
[52:30] But the scripture there, the word there
[52:32] doesn't say should. It says the mystery
[52:34] of God would be finished. In other
[52:37] words, church, there's no doubt that the
[52:38] mystery is going to be finished. There's
[52:40] there's no possibility that it just
[52:42] might not happen. It's guaranteed to
[52:44] happen. Amen. The mystery of God will be
[52:46] finished under the message of the
[52:48] seventh angel. Amen. It started a long
[52:51] time ago, but it's going to be finished
[52:54] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[52:56] angel. Amen. And so, we have to ask
[52:58] ourselves, what is this mystery? What's
[52:59] it all about? Who does it in who's it
[53:01] who's who's involved in it? What's the
[53:03] finishing element? What's being finished
[53:04] in this day? What is it that's going on
[53:07] through all of this? Amen. The scripture
[53:09] says he's declared this mystery to his
[53:12] servants, the prophets. In other words,
[53:13] it's been declared all through time,
[53:15] church, but it's being revealed in this
[53:18] age. Amen. So that it's not bringing a
[53:21] new message. It's just showing us what
[53:24] God has sent already. It's showing us
[53:26] what God had planned already. It shows
[53:29] us the work that God's been doing all
[53:31] along. And nobody's really recognized
[53:33] what was going on. It's opening our eyes
[53:35] to what he's done so we'll see and
[53:38] believe what he's doing and gets us
[53:40] ready for what he's about to do. That's
[53:42] what's happening under this. Amen. It's
[53:45] it's it's bringing a message to a bride
[53:47] about the plan that God has already
[53:49] declared in his word about her and for
[53:52] her. Okay, that's the purpose is to get
[53:54] us ready now for a resurrection and a
[53:56] rapture. Now, here's why I had to spend
[53:58] five services talking about why we
[54:00] believe that there's an angel messenger,
[54:02] a prophet messenger to this age. Because
[54:05] if we're not looking for that messenger
[54:07] or his message, we're not going to be a
[54:09] part of the mystery of God being
[54:11] revealed. That's it. If you're not under
[54:14] the voice, then you're not going to be
[54:16] in the mystery
[54:18] because the spirit always reveals the
[54:20] word. That's the purpose of the Holy
[54:22] Spirit is to open up the word of God to
[54:24] us. And we've read in the last few
[54:26] services in Revelation 3 about the leady
[54:29] and church age how that seventh church
[54:30] age messenger, he will rebuke the people
[54:33] for their self- congratulating,
[54:35] self-affirming religion. That's the
[54:37] first thing he's going to do is he's
[54:38] going to say, "You don't have what you
[54:40] think you have. You're not what you
[54:41] think you are." And he'd show them very
[54:44] clearly. And what would he say? He'd
[54:45] say, "Get out of those denominational
[54:47] systems and get back to Christ because
[54:49] Christ isn't in it anymore.
[54:52] The life has moved on. The word has
[54:54] moved on. You kicked out the word. You
[54:56] kicked out the Holy Spirit. You brought
[54:58] things under men's leadership. And when
[54:59] you kick Christ out and the word out,
[55:01] what do you have left? Death. The ways
[55:04] of men are death every single time."
[55:06] Now, we could preach months on this
[55:08] mystery being finished and still have
[55:09] months of preaching left. But I want to
[55:11] summarize it just over the fir the next
[55:14] few services, Lord willing. But I want
[55:16] you to see something here. It says here
[55:18] the mystery will be finished.
[55:21] It doesn't just say the mystery will be
[55:23] understood. It doesn't say the mystery
[55:24] will just be preached. It doesn't just
[55:26] say the ministry will be talked about,
[55:28] but the mystery will be finished. Amen.
[55:30] It's a finishing work. It's a process.
[55:33] In other words, this is the happening
[55:35] time. It's not the talking time. It's
[55:37] the happening time. So, we're not here
[55:40] to be believers of the talk. We're here
[55:42] to be lever believers of the happening.
[55:45] Amen. This is when it all comes down to
[55:47] the showdown. This is when everything
[55:49] that God's been talking about comes into
[55:51] fulfillment. And you got to be a part of
[55:54] it. Not just a hearer of it, but you got
[55:56] to be part of the doing of it also.
[55:58] Amen. Our eyes have been opened, but our
[56:01] body has to receive what our eyes have
[56:03] seen. Amen. We're supposed to experience
[56:06] what we're believing. Amen. And so the
[56:08] message of this prophet is a is not just
[56:10] a speaking message, but it's a producing
[56:13] message. It's doing a work in a people.
[56:15] Amen. It's about the true church. It's
[56:17] about the bride of Christ. It's about
[56:19] the revelation of Jesus Christ in its
[56:22] last and final phase on this earth.
[56:24] That's what it's all about. Now, someone
[56:26] asked me, they said, "What is the
[56:28] practical reason or application to
[56:31] accept that God sent a prophet with an
[56:33] end time message?" That's a good
[56:35] question.
[56:37] We preach five services on Malachi 4
[56:39] basically and why we believe it. But
[56:41] what is it all about? Why do we have to
[56:43] do that? Well, there's two reasons. The
[56:45] first is that it's a restoration message
[56:47] to bring us back to the original truth
[56:50] of the scriptures. It is not a new
[56:52] message. It's restoring us back to the
[56:54] truth that's been lost through men's
[56:56] ideas and denominations through 2,000
[56:58] years. Okay? Jesus said we need to
[57:01] worship God in two things. Spirit and
[57:04] truth. Okay? Without truth, our worship
[57:07] isn't accepted. And without spirit, our
[57:10] truth isn't accepted. You can have
[57:12] spirit and no truth and it's not
[57:14] accepted. And you can have truth and no
[57:15] spirit and it's not accepted either.
[57:16] One's a cold formal church and the other
[57:19] one is all hooping and hollering, but
[57:21] there's no life behind it. You've got to
[57:24] have both of those together. Amen. And
[57:25] if you don't, then you're worshiping a
[57:27] God of your own choosing. And God
[57:28] doesn't accept that worship because
[57:30] you're worshiping your way, not his way.
[57:32] Amen. So, we needed to know by a
[57:34] restoration message what God wanted,
[57:37] what God expected, what God meant. And
[57:39] with so many churches doing away with
[57:41] all of those things, you're left with
[57:43] people that don't have a clue what God
[57:44] really wants. And so, we needed to be
[57:47] brought back to that, to the life of
[57:49] Christ, not just the theology of Christ.
[57:52] We've got so much theology,
[57:55] but we need a people that can live it,
[57:58] not just say they understand it. But the
[58:01] second thing he's got to do is this
[58:02] mystery finishing. It's prepare us for
[58:05] the rapture and the coming of the Lord
[58:07] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[58:10] To get us in the right channel, get us
[58:13] in the right mindset to get us looking
[58:16] for the right thing.
[58:18] Remember, if you had Noah's message in
[58:20] Moses day, you weren't going to get
[58:22] anywhere. You'll be focused on the wrong
[58:24] thing. And so this prophet's message is
[58:26] to come and focus us on what God's
[58:29] trying to do today. Right now. Not
[58:32] backwards looking. Right now. See,
[58:35] remember what he said. Everybody knows
[58:37] what God did and everybody's looking for
[58:39] what God's going to do. But how many
[58:41] people are catching what he's doing when
[58:43] he's doing it? That's what he's trying
[58:44] to do is get us ready right now. And so
[58:47] he's got to bring a a mystery revealing
[58:50] message. He's got to bring a rapturing
[58:52] message. If you want to go in rapture,
[58:54] you need a rapture message. If you want
[58:56] to be healed, you need a healing
[58:57] message. If you want to be changed, you
[58:58] need a changing message. So, he's got to
[59:01] bring the things that we're looking for
[59:02] in our scriptures. Amen. Remember, we
[59:04] read last service, faith comes by
[59:06] hearing, and hearing comes by the word
[59:08] of God. In other words, faith comes by
[59:10] understanding, and understanding comes
[59:11] by the word. You can't have faith
[59:13] without the word to base it on. If
[59:16] you're going to go in a rapture, you got
[59:17] to have a rapture message to believe.
[59:20] You know, I was talking to my wife about
[59:22] that that that nominal Christian uh
[59:25] pastor that I was talking about last
[59:26] service. I didn't name his name. I still
[59:28] won't name it. They were talking I
[59:29] shared some things, you know, where he
[59:31] said, "Well, I don't believe that God is
[59:33] revealing divine truth anymore." And he
[59:35] didn't believe in this and didn't
[59:36] believe that. And I said to my wife,
[59:37] "His problem is not what he believes.
[59:39] His problem is what he doesn't believe.
[59:42] That's what's holding him back." Amen.
[59:43] He doesn't believe that the Holy
[59:45] Spirit's revealing divine truth. He
[59:46] doesn't believe in signs and wonders. He
[59:48] doesn't believe in divine healing. He
[59:50] doesn't believe in the gifts of the
[59:51] spirit. He doesn't believe in a true
[59:53] five-fold ministry. In short, he doesn't
[59:55] believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[59:57] yesterday, today, and forever. So,
[1:00:00] because he doesn't believe it, guess
[1:00:01] what? He doesn't have it and he can't
[1:00:04] accept it and he can't even fathom the
[1:00:06] idea that somewhere somehow there might
[1:00:08] be something that he doesn't believe in.
[1:00:10] Remember Jesus went to some places and
[1:00:11] it says he could do no great miracles
[1:00:14] because of their unbelief.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] church. You can have all faith, but if
[1:00:19] you don't have all truth, what does it
[1:00:21] matter? Because your faith is limited to
[1:00:23] the truth that you have. And so, God
[1:00:25] can't do things in a person's life that
[1:00:27] won't accept his word. He'll only go as
[1:00:29] far as the truth that you've received
[1:00:31] into your life. Amen. I said it last
[1:00:33] service, I'll say it again. If you don't
[1:00:35] believe the word of God, you're not
[1:00:36] going to experience the word of God.
[1:00:38] It's that simple. Amen. If you don't
[1:00:40] believe in a rapture, you don't believe
[1:00:41] in divine healing, you don't believe in
[1:00:43] deliverance, you don't believe in the
[1:00:44] leadership of the Holy Spirit, you don't
[1:00:46] believe in the receiving of the Holy
[1:00:47] Spirit, guess what? You're never going
[1:00:48] to get it, church. Except God by
[1:00:51] sovereign grace comes down and touches
[1:00:53] you. I mean, we look at the Apostle Paul
[1:00:56] when he was called Saul. He didn't
[1:00:58] believe it. But when he received the
[1:00:59] Holy Spirit, that's when he believed it.
[1:01:02] And that's the problem today is we don't
[1:01:04] have the new birth. And that's why we
[1:01:05] don't believe it. Because when you get
[1:01:07] the Holy Spirit, it'll say amen to every
[1:01:09] word, every part of the scripture, it'll
[1:01:12] say amen to. And you see, Paul turned
[1:01:14] 180 degrees and walked the way that he
[1:01:16] was persecuting. Why? He had a new
[1:01:18] birth. And it opened his eyes and it
[1:01:20] opened up his soul to the word of God.
[1:01:23] So, what's the practical application of
[1:01:25] believing an end time message for a
[1:01:27] Leodysian church age? It'll get you to
[1:01:30] receive and obey the full word of God
[1:01:33] exactly the way that God gave it to
[1:01:35] Paul. Amen. It'll show you how to live.
[1:01:38] It'll show you how to talk. Show you how
[1:01:40] to walk. It'll show you how to dress
[1:01:43] yourself. It'll show you how to spend
[1:01:44] your time. It'll show you how to spend
[1:01:46] your money. It'll show you how to know
[1:01:47] your gifts. It'll show you how to use
[1:01:49] your gifts. Amen. It'll show you how to
[1:01:52] raise your kids. It'll show you how to
[1:01:54] love your spouse.
[1:01:56] It'll put you in a condition to walk
[1:01:58] with God.
[1:02:00] It'll put you into the light, amen, of
[1:02:02] the full word of God. Now, listen to
[1:02:04] what Brother Brand would say. He said
[1:02:06] he's sending a vindicated prophet. He's
[1:02:08] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[1:02:10] years. He's sending someone who is so
[1:02:12] far from organization, education, and
[1:02:15] the world of religion that as John the
[1:02:17] Baptist and Elijah of old, he will only
[1:02:20] hear from God. And he will have thus
[1:02:21] sayeth the Lord and speak for God. He
[1:02:24] will be God's mouthpiece. And he, as it
[1:02:26] is declared in Malachi 4:6, will turn
[1:02:29] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:02:31] fathers.
[1:02:33] The practical thing is he'll turn you
[1:02:35] back to what they used to believe, the
[1:02:37] full truth. But catch this. He says he
[1:02:39] will bring back the elect of the last
[1:02:42] day and they will hear a vindicated
[1:02:44] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[1:02:47] with Paul. He will restore the truth as
[1:02:50] they had it. And those elect pe those
[1:02:52] elect with him in that day will be the
[1:02:55] ones who truly manifest the Lord and be
[1:02:59] his body and be his voice and perform
[1:03:01] his works. He says hallelujah. Do you
[1:03:03] see it? Practically speaking, this is
[1:03:06] what he'll do. He'll bring you to a
[1:03:08] place where you'll reveal Christ all
[1:03:10] over again. You'll have the reality of
[1:03:12] Jesus Christ in your life. Amen. It'll
[1:03:14] be the same life living by the same word
[1:03:17] producing the same results. Now, I want
[1:03:20] to take us down to this mystery
[1:03:22] revealing portion and what it involves
[1:03:24] and what it looks like. And I want to
[1:03:25] take us to the book of Ephesians. And
[1:03:27] remember, Ephesians is our conquering
[1:03:29] chapter. It's our inheritance chapter.
[1:03:32] It's a type of the book of Joshua. And
[1:03:34] so, this is where we come in to what God
[1:03:36] has promised us. And in Ephesians 1, it
[1:03:39] says this, "Blessed be the God and
[1:03:41] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had
[1:03:44] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:03:46] in heavenly places in Christ, according
[1:03:49] as he had chosen us in him before the
[1:03:53] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:03:55] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:03:58] love." Church, here's the great
[1:03:59] blessing, okay? He starts with the
[1:04:01] blessings and then he goes into the
[1:04:03] mysteries and it's all tied into one and
[1:04:05] the same thing. Amen. God chose you
[1:04:07] before you chose him. The greatest
[1:04:10] security you have, church, is that he
[1:04:12] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:04:16] world. Before you took a breath of life,
[1:04:19] before you did right, before you did
[1:04:21] wrong, before you came to church, he
[1:04:23] chose you. God made himself your source,
[1:04:26] your origin. You did not choose him. You
[1:04:29] came out of him. Okay? his decision, his
[1:04:32] decree, his will there he says is that
[1:04:35] you would be holy and without blame
[1:04:39] before him in love. Now it says there
[1:04:41] should be.
[1:04:44] This is another mischaracterization of
[1:04:46] the English language. The word there
[1:04:48] should be is a single word in the
[1:04:51] original language and it means I exist.
[1:04:55] In other words, that I exist holy and
[1:04:59] blameless before him in love. Remember,
[1:05:02] God revealed himself to Moses as the
[1:05:04] great I am, the self and continuous
[1:05:08] existing one. Now, out of him comes the
[1:05:11] I exist that is holy and without blame.
[1:05:14] And it is you and it is I. Our
[1:05:17] continuing nature, the attribute of God
[1:05:19] that he attaches to you and I is holy
[1:05:22] and blameless.
[1:05:24] Hallelujah. That what he declared before
[1:05:27] the start of all this time of all of
[1:05:29] this mess is that there's a people whose
[1:05:32] attribute in him is holy and blameless.
[1:05:36] Who therefore can lay anything to the
[1:05:38] charge of God's elect. There's therefore
[1:05:41] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:05:44] Christ. Why? Because from the beginning
[1:05:46] he says, "She will be holy and she will
[1:05:48] be blameless before me based on my love
[1:05:51] to her." Based on my love to her, you
[1:05:54] became eternally identified, church,
[1:05:56] with holiness and free of blame.
[1:06:01] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "What?
[1:06:05] Having predestinated us unto the
[1:06:08] adoption of children." Adoption is a
[1:06:09] process of time. Remember, Paul says,
[1:06:12] "It doesn't yet appear what we shall
[1:06:13] be."
[1:06:15] having predestinated us unto the
[1:06:17] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:06:19] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:06:21] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:06:24] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:06:26] accepted in the beloved church how could
[1:06:29] we take any glory to ourselves for where
[1:06:30] we are today for what we have today for
[1:06:32] what he's made us I had nothing to do
[1:06:35] with it it's his work it's his mercy
[1:06:38] it's his grace from before the
[1:06:40] foundation of the world before I took a
[1:06:43] breath of life he had a work already
[1:06:45] ordained for you and I. He says, "In
[1:06:47] whom we have redemption through his
[1:06:49] blood,
[1:06:50] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:54] riches of his grace." We sang that song,
[1:06:56] Something Keeps Hold Me. I had a
[1:06:57] revelation of God's desire to keep me in
[1:07:00] his grace. And then what are we
[1:07:01] preaching on this morning? God's desire
[1:07:04] to keep us in his grace. Not just a
[1:07:06] desire, church, a will to keep us in his
[1:07:09] grace.
[1:07:10] He says, "Wherein he hath abounded
[1:07:12] towards us in all wisdom and prudence."
[1:07:16] Now here we come to the mystery. Having
[1:07:18] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:07:20] will according to his good pleasure
[1:07:24] which he hath purposed in himself.
[1:07:26] Church, where are we in that?
[1:07:30] We are only there as the recipients.
[1:07:31] Amen. It is his will. It is his good
[1:07:35] pleasure that he purposed in himself. In
[1:07:37] other words, he decided it. He chose it.
[1:07:40] He planned it. And we just get to
[1:07:42] receive it. It's not us that's doing it.
[1:07:45] It's himself. Amen. He purposed in
[1:07:46] himself. He decided in himself. He
[1:07:49] thought it. He made up his mind. And
[1:07:50] then he spoke it and wrote it down in
[1:07:52] his word for us to receive it. Now, here
[1:07:55] is the mystery. The mystery of his will
[1:07:58] is this verse 10. that in the
[1:07:59] dispensation of the fullness of times.
[1:08:01] In other words, when all of time comes
[1:08:03] down to the very end of it, he might
[1:08:05] gather together in one all things in
[1:08:08] Christ which are in heaven and which are
[1:08:10] on earth, even in him. So simply put,
[1:08:13] this means when the time is all over, he
[1:08:15] would join together in unity all those
[1:08:18] that are in Christ, those that are in
[1:08:20] heaven and those that are in earth. He'd
[1:08:22] unify it all together into one thing.
[1:08:23] Okay? Those who came out of God will be
[1:08:27] those that go back into God.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't go in if you didn't come
[1:08:31] out. Because that's what redemption is.
[1:08:33] Is to bring back that which he had in
[1:08:35] the first place. So the redeemed are
[1:08:37] those that came out of God. Those
[1:08:39] that'll be redeemed back to God. Amen.
[1:08:41] That's a very simple formula. If you
[1:08:43] came out of God, you'll go back to God.
[1:08:45] Okay. He says, "In whom also we have an
[1:08:48] obtained we have obtained an inheritance
[1:08:50] being predestinated according to the
[1:08:52] purpose of him who workketh all things
[1:08:55] after the counsel of his own will.
[1:09:00] Not my will, not your will, not your
[1:09:01] desire, not my desire. It's all
[1:09:03] according to his." Amen. But church,
[1:09:05] look at this. We have an inheritance. We
[1:09:07] don't like to think about inheritance
[1:09:09] because for us, inheritance is always
[1:09:11] tied to death.
[1:09:13] Amen.
[1:09:15] My dad turns 73 next month. My mom is
[1:09:18] 72, I believe.
[1:09:22] I may have an inheritance,
[1:09:24] but I'm more interested in keeping my
[1:09:26] parents alive than getting my
[1:09:27] inheritance.
[1:09:29] Can we say amen? Those of us with older
[1:09:32] parents, we don't want to lose our
[1:09:33] parents. So, we'd say, "I'll forego the
[1:09:36] inheritance if I can keep my family, if
[1:09:38] I can keep my parents." But we look here
[1:09:40] and we see that we have an inheritance
[1:09:42] because somebody died. but he rose
[1:09:44] again, but we still get our inheritance.
[1:09:46] We get to have our cake and eat it, too.
[1:09:48] We get everything that he gave us by his
[1:09:51] death, and we get to have him yet again.
[1:09:53] That's the kind of inheritance I'm
[1:09:54] interested in. Amen. I'm trusting
[1:09:57] that'll be the inheritance I get with my
[1:09:59] family. That we all go without seeing
[1:10:02] death and we gain our inheritance
[1:10:03] together. Amen. But notice now, he has
[1:10:06] something for us. Amen. We have
[1:10:08] something that we're waiting on that he
[1:10:10] has prepared for us. And he says that we
[1:10:12] should be to the praise of his glory who
[1:10:14] first trusted in Christ. So if we were
[1:10:16] to summarize all this, I would read it
[1:10:18] this way. God has a chosen people that
[1:10:21] are ordained and elected to be
[1:10:24] positionally placed into the body of
[1:10:27] Jesus Christ. And those people are given
[1:10:30] full access to the every spiritual
[1:10:34] blessing that God has declared to us.
[1:10:41] I feel like more than three people
[1:10:42] should have said amen or glory there.
[1:10:44] Everything
[1:10:46] that God has is available to those that
[1:10:50] were in his mind before the foundation
[1:10:52] of the world. That's what you have
[1:10:53] waiting for you. Amen. The great mystery
[1:10:56] of God revealing in this age is Christ
[1:10:59] revealing himself in and through this
[1:11:01] church,
[1:11:03] this bride, this people. Amen. That's
[1:11:06] what God's trying to do in this age.
[1:11:07] These people came from God. They're
[1:11:09] being restored back to God. Remember,
[1:11:12] you are what you came out of. My
[1:11:13] children are just an expression of me.
[1:11:17] But see,
[1:11:19] don't take this wrong.
[1:11:22] My children are flawed
[1:11:25] because they don't come just through me.
[1:11:26] They come through my wife. So, Jonathan
[1:11:29] is not a perfect expression of me
[1:11:32] because he's got some of my wife blended
[1:11:34] in. But see from the eternal we come
[1:11:38] from the father alone.
[1:11:40] Okay? You see that we come from the
[1:11:43] father alone. And so Jonathan in perfect
[1:11:46] in a perfect world would have just my
[1:11:48] DNA in him. He'd be an expression of me.
[1:11:52] Remember what happened in the garden of
[1:11:54] Eden? God came down and he took a part
[1:11:56] out of Adam. Eve was not birthed. She
[1:11:59] was created from the same thing that she
[1:12:01] came out of. So God came down. He took a
[1:12:04] rib out of Adam and then he formed a
[1:12:05] woman all around that. Not just a woman.
[1:12:08] He took a bride out of him and he
[1:12:10] prepared her and he brought her to Adam.
[1:12:12] And Adam says, "You are bone of my bone
[1:12:15] and you are flesh of my flesh." In other
[1:12:17] words, you're built out of the exact
[1:12:19] same things I'm built out of. There is
[1:12:21] no difference in our makeup. There's
[1:12:24] just a difference in our expression. But
[1:12:27] you're made from the exact same thing.
[1:12:28] She was a part of him. She was cut from
[1:12:30] the same cloth, we'd say, but she was
[1:12:32] just a different looking manifestation
[1:12:34] of who he was. Eve was just Adam in a
[1:12:38] different body.
[1:12:40] Okay? But remember, Adam was in the
[1:12:43] image of God. In other words, what we
[1:12:45] see Adam as is what God is. Okay? He was
[1:12:48] a in the form of God. He was the son of
[1:12:50] God, the scripture says. And so, we can
[1:12:53] see in Adam our own representation in
[1:12:55] Christ. Amen. John tells us in the
[1:12:57] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:12:59] with God. The word was God. And the word
[1:13:01] was made flesh. Amen. God stepped into a
[1:13:04] body into a flesh form called Jesus.
[1:13:07] Amen. And God poured him into that. And
[1:13:09] then Paul is saying here that just as
[1:13:11] Adam had a portion taken out of him, God
[1:13:14] had a portion taken out of him. And it's
[1:13:16] to prepare a bride. And those that were
[1:13:18] taken out of him are those that are
[1:13:20] going to go back to him. That's the way
[1:13:22] that this has to work. And what is it?
[1:13:24] In the beginning was the word. And so
[1:13:26] this has to be a word bride.
[1:13:29] Not a man bride, not a flesh bride. She
[1:13:32] has to be a word bride. So a restoring
[1:13:35] messenger has to come to restore us back
[1:13:37] to being a word bride instead of a bride
[1:13:40] by the creation and dressing of men.
[1:13:43] Cuz she's got to be prepared for God,
[1:13:45] not prepared for men. Okay?
[1:13:49] Jesus Christ was the perfect expression
[1:13:51] of the word. And to me, perfect means he
[1:13:54] didn't go too far and he didn't stop
[1:13:56] short. He performed exactly what the
[1:13:59] word said he was going to do. He was
[1:14:01] perfect in his obedience to the b to the
[1:14:03] word. Listen to this. He says, "You were
[1:14:05] fore orained to be a son of God. You
[1:14:08] were in God before the foundation of the
[1:14:11] world. You're only manifested in this
[1:14:14] day for his honor and glory." How can
[1:14:16] you do it without honoring his word and
[1:14:18] stand with every word of God? He says,
[1:14:20] "Which you are a part of the word by
[1:14:23] predestination
[1:14:24] because God is the word." He says,
[1:14:26] "Well, then he always was the word. In
[1:14:28] the beginning was the word. And if the
[1:14:30] word was God and then you were in God,
[1:14:32] the word," he says, "the part that
[1:14:34] you're to play was in God before the
[1:14:38] foundation of the world." What's the
[1:14:39] part that you're to play, church? The
[1:14:41] mystery that's going to be revealed.
[1:14:44] It's the portion of the expression of
[1:14:46] God in this age that you and I are
[1:14:48] supposed to play. Now, he takes us back
[1:14:50] to where I was talking in John. He says
[1:14:51] in John 1:1 where it says in the
[1:14:53] beginning was the word. The word from
[1:14:55] which we get our translation for word is
[1:14:57] logos which means the thought or
[1:15:00] concept. It has the double meaning of
[1:15:02] both thought and speech. He says now a
[1:15:05] thought expressed is a word or words. He
[1:15:08] says isn't that wonderful and beautiful.
[1:15:09] John says that the concept of God was
[1:15:12] expressed in Jesus. Okay that's what the
[1:15:15] word is the is the expression of God.
[1:15:19] He says when Jesus was on earth, he
[1:15:21] said, "Believest thou that not that I am
[1:15:23] in the Father and the Father in me. The
[1:15:25] words that I speak unto you, I speak not
[1:15:27] of myself, but the Father that dwells in
[1:15:29] me, he do doeth the works." He says,
[1:15:32] John 14:10,
[1:15:34] "Here then it is most evidently set
[1:15:36] forth that the perfect manifestation of
[1:15:39] God in the Son was by the inddwelling
[1:15:41] spirit manifesting in word and works."
[1:15:45] So in other words, God expressed himself
[1:15:48] in and through Jesus Christ by his
[1:15:51] spirit. And what did he do? He
[1:15:53] manifested in word what he said and in
[1:15:56] works what he did. And the two match
[1:15:58] perfectly. Jesus didn't say one thing
[1:16:01] and do another. That's a human trait.
[1:16:05] He said and he did and they both always
[1:16:08] lined up together. He said that is what
[1:16:10] we exactly what we've been teaching all
[1:16:12] along. when the bride will get back
[1:16:16] to being a word bride. What's going to
[1:16:20] take that church? A restoration message.
[1:16:22] She's got to get back to the word so she
[1:16:25] can be a word bride instead of a
[1:16:26] denominational bride. He said she will
[1:16:28] produce the very works that Jesus
[1:16:30] produced. Now, we saw that when brother
[1:16:32] Brandon was up there, didn't we? We saw
[1:16:34] the very works of Christ. But he moved
[1:16:36] from the works of his hands to the works
[1:16:38] of the word,
[1:16:40] right? He went into his word fulfillment
[1:16:42] not just in the signs and wonders but
[1:16:44] now the opening of the word the
[1:16:45] restoration of the word to get a bride
[1:16:47] ready for Christ. He says the word is
[1:16:50] God. The spirit is God. They are all
[1:16:52] one. One cannot work apart from the
[1:16:54] other. And if one truly has the spirit
[1:16:56] of God, he will have the word of God.
[1:17:00] Now notice he says here when the bride
[1:17:02] will get back to being a word bride,
[1:17:04] that's a restoration that's happening.
[1:17:06] They weren't a word bride. They were a
[1:17:08] denominational bride. They were a bride
[1:17:10] of their own dressing, a bride of their
[1:17:11] own making, a bride of their own
[1:17:13] preparation. Remember, Leodysa is full
[1:17:16] of professing Christians that aren't
[1:17:19] Christians. They're professing
[1:17:21] Christians. Why? But they they aren't
[1:17:24] true Christians because they refuse to
[1:17:26] line up with the word of God. They've
[1:17:28] denied the truth. They've denied the
[1:17:29] power as we read last service. Amen. And
[1:17:32] so, they're not a word bride. They are a
[1:17:34] church bride of their own making and
[1:17:36] choosing. That's what's left out there.
[1:17:38] Amen. Notice there's always a people
[1:17:40] professing to be Christ and then there's
[1:17:42] always a people that are are expressing
[1:17:44] Christ. Profession is not what gets us
[1:17:47] in church. It's expression.
[1:17:49] Manifestation is what we're looking for.
[1:17:51] We read that quote earlier, but let's
[1:17:53] take it now back to the word of God.
[1:17:55] Remember what Jesus said in Matthew 7.
[1:17:57] Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[1:17:59] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:18:01] heaven. In other words, just because you
[1:18:03] call Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior,
[1:18:04] does not mean he is your Lord and
[1:18:06] Savior.
[1:18:07] He says, "Not everyone that says that to
[1:18:09] me is going to enter the kingdom of
[1:18:10] heaven, but who will? He that doeth the
[1:18:13] will of my father which is in heaven."
[1:18:15] So it's not our confession that makes us
[1:18:17] Christians. It's his confirmation of who
[1:18:20] we are that makes us Christians. It's
[1:18:22] his identification with us. Amen. And he
[1:18:25] says, who's the one that is in the
[1:18:27] kingdom of heaven? It is the one that
[1:18:30] does the will of God. What is his will?
[1:18:33] His word. It's a very simple principle.
[1:18:36] And here's what he says now. He says
[1:18:37] there's all these people are professing
[1:18:39] me to be their Lord. He says, ' And many
[1:18:41] me many will say to me in that day, what
[1:18:43] day, church? This day? Many are going to
[1:18:45] say in that last day, Lord, Lord, have
[1:18:48] we not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:18:50] name have cast out devils, and in thy
[1:18:52] name done many wonderful works. And then
[1:18:56] will I profess unto them, I never knew
[1:18:57] you? Depart from me, you that work
[1:19:00] iniquity. You see, there's a lot of
[1:19:02] people doing a lot of wonderful things,
[1:19:04] but it's them that calls them wonderful
[1:19:06] things. He never says those are
[1:19:08] wonderful things. They say they're
[1:19:09] wonderful things. Amen. There's people
[1:19:13] with natural gifts that are doing
[1:19:15] wonderful things. There's people with
[1:19:16] spiritual gifts that are doing wonderful
[1:19:18] wings things and wonderful works. But
[1:19:20] God doesn't say that. God says, "I don't
[1:19:22] know you. I never knew you in the first
[1:19:25] place. You've been doing iniquity."
[1:19:27] Remember what iniquity is? You don't you
[1:19:30] don't do something you know to do. You
[1:19:33] refuse to do what God tells you to do
[1:19:35] and you do something else. Amen. He said
[1:19:37] what you did was iniquity. It was your
[1:19:39] own will. It was your own choosing. It
[1:19:41] was your own creation. You rejected the
[1:19:43] word and instead you did what you wanted
[1:19:45] to do. He says and I had no part in it.
[1:19:47] I wasn't your Lord because you didn't do
[1:19:49] what I said. Okay. But there's a people
[1:19:52] that have come out of all that and what
[1:19:54] are they doing? They're going back to
[1:19:56] the word. They're going back to the
[1:19:57] leadership and the power of the Holy
[1:19:59] Spirit. They're laying down their own
[1:20:01] thoughts. They're laying down their own
[1:20:02] ideas. They're laying they're letting
[1:20:04] God open up the word to them so that
[1:20:06] they can finally walk in a way that's
[1:20:08] pleasing to God, church. And that's when
[1:20:10] we start to see results. You start to
[1:20:12] see lasting results when you walk
[1:20:14] according to the word that God has
[1:20:16] revealed to you. Amen. People want the
[1:20:18] results of the word, but they don't want
[1:20:20] the obedience to the word.
[1:20:22] We all want God to do great things in
[1:20:24] our life, but how many of us are willing
[1:20:26] to lay down our life so that he can do
[1:20:27] great things in it? That's what he's
[1:20:29] looking for. Amen. I I love what brother
[1:20:31] Barry said here. He says, "Obedience is
[1:20:32] critical to rapturing faith." Obedience
[1:20:35] is so critical to the believer in this
[1:20:37] age. Amen. Remember when King Saul went
[1:20:39] up against the Amalachites and the
[1:20:41] prophet Samuel, he said, "Listen, here's
[1:20:43] the word of the Lord. Kill the men, kill
[1:20:45] the women, kill the children, kill the
[1:20:47] animals, destroy everything, keep
[1:20:50] nothing. keep nothing. And then sa Saul
[1:20:53] went Samuel kind of comes afterwards to
[1:20:56] check out how the battle went. And Saul
[1:20:58] hadn't killed everything.
[1:21:00] He had kept some of the animals for a
[1:21:02] sacrifice. He had kept the king himself.
[1:21:04] And the scripture says they kept some of
[1:21:06] the good stuff, but they burned the bad
[1:21:08] stuff.
[1:21:12] So what has he done? He's got partial
[1:21:14] obedience here. But I want you to hear
[1:21:17] what Samuel says to him. Samuel says,
[1:21:19] "And Samuel said, had the Lord as great
[1:21:21] delight in burnt offerings and
[1:21:23] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:21:26] the Lord." He says, "Behold, to obey is
[1:21:28] better better than sacrifice, and to
[1:21:32] hearken is better than the fat of rams."
[1:21:34] Church, nothing wrong with a sacrifice,
[1:21:36] but he says it's better to obey God than
[1:21:39] to disobey and sacrifice in your
[1:21:41] disobedience. Okay? In other words, your
[1:21:44] sacrifice of praise or your offering is
[1:21:48] not accepted when it comes by way of
[1:21:50] disobedience. You can't offer the fruit
[1:21:53] of your disobedience as a sacrifice to
[1:21:55] God. Let me make it simple. You can't
[1:21:57] pay tithes on money you made making
[1:21:59] drugs, selling drugs. God's not
[1:22:02] interested in that. Disobedience is not
[1:22:04] something you can offer to God. It's not
[1:22:07] accepted by him. Remember, Cain tried to
[1:22:09] do that. Cain tried to offer an
[1:22:12] excellent sacrifice and God rejected it
[1:22:14] and God accepted a more excellent. In
[1:22:18] other words, there's a better and
[1:22:19] there's a best.
[1:22:21] There's a great and then there's a best.
[1:22:24] And God came to Cain. He says, "Cain,
[1:22:26] why are you so angry? Just do it the way
[1:22:28] you know how to do it now and I'll
[1:22:30] accept you." And Cain said, "I'm not
[1:22:31] going to do it." He refused to do it.
[1:22:34] Amen. He tried to bring his
[1:22:36] disobedience. He says, "This is all I
[1:22:38] can offer. take it or leave it to God.
[1:22:40] And God said, "No thanks."
[1:22:44] Now, watch what Samuel says here. He
[1:22:45] says, "For rebellion is as the sin of
[1:22:48] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[1:22:50] iniquity and idolatry, because thou hast
[1:22:53] rejected the word of the Lord. He hath
[1:22:55] also rejected thee from being king."
[1:22:57] Samuel pulls no punches here, church. He
[1:23:00] goes right to the heart of the issue. He
[1:23:01] says, Saul, he says, you're rebellious
[1:23:03] and you're stubborn. Remember in a
[1:23:07] previous incident that Samuel had told
[1:23:09] Saul, "Go and wait on me and I'll come
[1:23:14] and I'll offer sacrifice and then you
[1:23:16] can go into battle." And remember what
[1:23:19] happened is sa Saul waited for seven
[1:23:21] days. Samuel said, "I'm going to come on
[1:23:22] the seventh day." Saul waited till the
[1:23:24] seventh day and then the situation got
[1:23:27] so uh dire so um
[1:23:32] desperate
[1:23:34] that Saul said if I don't do this
[1:23:36] sacrifice the people are going to leave
[1:23:39] and I'm not going to have an army and
[1:23:40] I'm not going to be able to fight. And
[1:23:42] so Saul took the sacrifices and he
[1:23:44] sacrificed them to God instead of
[1:23:46] letting the prophet do it. See what
[1:23:48] happened? He got so desperate for
[1:23:51] himself to hold on to his position to
[1:23:53] get the victory that he disobeyed. And
[1:23:56] Samuel came in. He said, "What are you
[1:23:57] doing?" And he said, "Listen, I had to
[1:23:59] do it.
[1:24:01] Church, we don't have to do anything if
[1:24:02] it's in disobedience."
[1:24:04] But Saul convinced himself he had to do
[1:24:07] what he was doing. And it was straight
[1:24:09] up disobedience. And Samuel said,
[1:24:10] "Listen, because of that, God's going to
[1:24:12] take the kingdom."
[1:24:15] What a horrible thing. What's the
[1:24:17] problem here, church? Saul thinks he
[1:24:19] knows better than God. Saul thinks he
[1:24:21] can change the plan of God and it'll
[1:24:23] please God more. But the problem is, and
[1:24:26] this is our human nature, Saul modified
[1:24:28] the plan to suit himself to make himself
[1:24:31] look better, to make himself better in
[1:24:33] the eyes of the people. And then he
[1:24:35] offered his disobedience to God. Amen.
[1:24:38] He dedicated his self-modified plan to
[1:24:40] God. And God rejected it. Now, that word
[1:24:42] rebellion,
[1:24:44] it's an interesting word. It's it's mari
[1:24:47] in the original language and it comes
[1:24:49] from the root mara which if you remember
[1:24:52] is what Naomi said. So rebellion is a
[1:24:55] dual meaning word. It means bitter or
[1:24:58] rebellious.
[1:25:00] Amen. Remember what Naomi she said. She
[1:25:02] said when she came back to Israel and
[1:25:04] all she had was Ruth. She lost her sons.
[1:25:06] She lost her husband. She lost her other
[1:25:08] daughter-in-law. She said call me Mara.
[1:25:10] Call me bitter. For the Almighty had
[1:25:12] dealt very bitterly with me. Now the
[1:25:14] simple truth is church, God didn't deal
[1:25:16] bitterly with her. Her husband dealt
[1:25:18] bitterly with her. Her husband led her
[1:25:21] out of the land of promise. Led her away
[1:25:23] from what God had given to them. Took
[1:25:25] them into a land of idolatry. They
[1:25:28] married people out of the world. And
[1:25:29] then God took her husband's life. God
[1:25:31] took her son's life.
[1:25:34] What was it? She was reaping what she
[1:25:36] was sowing. She reaped what her husband
[1:25:39] sowed. And she blamed it on God. Church,
[1:25:40] God wasn't in the decision. You can't
[1:25:42] blame him on the results. And that's
[1:25:44] what she did right there. Amen. Too many
[1:25:46] people are mad at God because they're
[1:25:47] reaping what they sowed. And if God's
[1:25:49] not in the decision, we can't blame him
[1:25:50] on the the harvest that we get in those
[1:25:52] different things. God says here,
[1:25:54] "Rebellion is just like witchcraft to
[1:25:56] me." That puts things into perspective,
[1:25:58] doesn't it?
[1:26:00] Rebellion, bitterness, doing things your
[1:26:03] own way. That's the same as witchcraft
[1:26:05] to God. Remember, I preached on this not
[1:26:06] too long ago. To partially obey is still
[1:26:10] disobedience.
[1:26:12] We don't get marks for obedience. You
[1:26:14] can't say, "I got 90% on obedience this
[1:26:16] month." That's disobedience. What you
[1:26:20] did was you got 100% on disobedience.
[1:26:23] Because partial obedience is still
[1:26:25] disobedience. You left it undone.
[1:26:28] You don't get credit for doing most of
[1:26:29] what God asked you to do. You get credit
[1:26:31] for doing everything God asked you to
[1:26:32] do. Amen. God's looking for people that
[1:26:36] are surrendered, not rebellious. Then he
[1:26:38] says, "Listen, Saul, you're not just
[1:26:39] rebellious. You're stubborn." And that
[1:26:41] word means you're urgent, you're pushy,
[1:26:43] you're insubordinate, you're insistent.
[1:26:46] In other words, you're trying to force
[1:26:48] your way on God.
[1:26:51] What arrogance do we have, church, when
[1:26:54] all we can do is say, "God, do it my
[1:26:55] way."
[1:26:57] Or, "I'll just go ahead and do it my
[1:26:59] way." Amen. It's you're wanting him to
[1:27:01] give into you rather than yield yourself
[1:27:04] to his perfect will. Amen. God says it's
[1:27:07] the same as iniquity and idolatry is
[1:27:10] stubbornness.
[1:27:11] Serving another God, church, because
[1:27:13] stubbornness is rooted in self- worship.
[1:27:16] Let me say it again. Stubbornness is
[1:27:19] rooted in self- worship because you
[1:27:21] believe that your way is the way. And to
[1:27:24] do that, you have to raise yourself
[1:27:26] above God.
[1:27:28] That's why we're stubborn as we think.
[1:27:29] We know better than almighty God does.
[1:27:32] Therefore, we insist on our way.
[1:27:34] Therefore, we pray for our way.
[1:27:35] Therefore, we walk according to our way.
[1:27:37] And what does it do, church? It takes
[1:27:38] the word and the spirit right out of our
[1:27:40] life. And he's got to go stand in a
[1:27:42] corner and wait for us to come back to
[1:27:43] him. We talk so much about adoption.
[1:27:46] We've talked about it. We've read the
[1:27:47] scriptures here about it. But the thing
[1:27:49] is that adoption doesn't come from
[1:27:50] rising up, church. It comes from dying
[1:27:52] out. You've got to die out to your way
[1:27:54] of thinking, to your way of feeling, to
[1:27:56] the things that want to control us and
[1:27:58] yield ourselves completely to the word
[1:28:00] by the Holy Spirit. That's the only way
[1:28:01] we can ever come into adoption to where
[1:28:03] he can place us in the body and start to
[1:28:05] use us. We've got to die out daily, the
[1:28:07] scripture says. And stubbornness is not
[1:28:10] the nature of a child of God. Not the
[1:28:12] nature of an adopted child. We're all
[1:28:15] stubborn.
[1:28:17] Amen. I can be stubborn.
[1:28:19] Ask my wife sometime. I can be real
[1:28:20] stubborn. But church, if there's one
[1:28:23] thing we ought to be stubborn on, it's
[1:28:24] the word of God. That's where our
[1:28:26] stubbornness needs to be. I will not
[1:28:27] bend. I will not bow. I will not move. I
[1:28:32] will be stubborn about the word of God
[1:28:33] and I'll let everything else go. That's
[1:28:35] the stubbornness that God wants. Amen.
[1:28:37] Is that we won't move from his word. But
[1:28:39] our own will, our own ideas, that's the
[1:28:41] stubbornness that we don't want to have.
[1:28:42] I said, God, help us not to be stubborn
[1:28:43] to our own ways.
[1:28:45] Remember what Jesus said, if any man
[1:28:48] will come after me, let him deny
[1:28:50] himself.
[1:28:54] How you going to know whether it's you
[1:28:55] or God? How does it line up with the
[1:28:57] word? Very simple. If it doesn't match
[1:29:00] the word, then it's me.
[1:29:02] It's this flesh. And if it matches up
[1:29:04] with the word, it's God. Let him deny
[1:29:06] himself and take up his cross daily and
[1:29:10] follow me. It's an everyday decision,
[1:29:13] church. It's an everyday experience that
[1:29:15] he's calling us to. And for whosoever
[1:29:17] shall save his life shall lose it. But
[1:29:20] whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:29:22] sake, the same shall save it. He says,
[1:29:23] "For what is a man advantage if he gain
[1:29:25] the whole world and lose himself or be
[1:29:27] cast away?" Church, we've all got our
[1:29:30] own ideas on how things should be done,
[1:29:33] when they should be done, who should do
[1:29:35] them? We've all got that. But are we
[1:29:38] yielding that back to the word of God?
[1:29:40] Amen. We can even look at things in the
[1:29:42] word and say, "That's for me, and we
[1:29:43] ought to do that." But the timing and
[1:29:45] the season of it has to be in God's
[1:29:47] hands. Amen. Not just in our hands. I'm
[1:29:49] reminded of Abraham. He took God at his
[1:29:51] word and then 25 years later he finally
[1:29:53] got it. Joseph 15 years I think 13
[1:29:57] years. David was 15 years getting the
[1:29:58] kingdom. Joseph 13 years to having his
[1:30:00] his vision fulfilled his dream
[1:30:02] fulfilled. Amen. And so many times what
[1:30:04] happens is we're taking things into our
[1:30:06] hands in and that's stubbornness trying
[1:30:09] to take things into our hands to make it
[1:30:11] happen rather than letting God do the
[1:30:13] work. I love this quote. He says, "If we
[1:30:16] just stayed close to God and loved him
[1:30:19] and just kept living for him and not
[1:30:22] trying to push things over,"
[1:30:26] he says, "Just live for God. Live a
[1:30:29] pure, holy life and live and pray every
[1:30:32] day. Keep yourself refreshed in his
[1:30:35] presence."
[1:30:37] Church, that's something you've got to
[1:30:38] commit time to doing. I've said it
[1:30:41] before about what helped me in the
[1:30:43] mornings. What I used to do is wake up
[1:30:45] and pick up my phone. And you know what
[1:30:47] that would do? Drag me down rather than
[1:30:50] refresh me. I don't need to see what's
[1:30:53] going on in the world. I don't need to
[1:30:54] see what's going on in my texts. I don't
[1:30:55] need to see what's going on in my
[1:30:56] emails. What I need is to wake up with
[1:30:58] God. Get refreshed in his presence.
[1:31:01] Commit your day to him. Give him time to
[1:31:04] get you set for the day. And when you do
[1:31:07] that, you can set your day right. He
[1:31:09] says, "Stay refreshed in his presence.
[1:31:12] God will take care of the rest of it.
[1:31:15] Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] You do your part. Stay close to him. God
[1:31:20] will take care of everything else.
[1:31:22] Scripture says, "Seek ye first the
[1:31:23] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[1:31:24] and all these other things will be added
[1:31:26] to you." He says he will adopt the
[1:31:28] people into his own beloved body, the
[1:31:31] church. He says, "And when the rapture
[1:31:33] comes, you'll be found without a blemish
[1:31:35] because you're living in the presence of
[1:31:37] the king." He says, "There's the secret,
[1:31:40] friend." Church, hear this this morning.
[1:31:43] God's not looking for grand gestures of
[1:31:47] faith or commitment or generosity. God's
[1:31:50] looking for obedience.
[1:31:53] That's it. Simple, humble obedience to
[1:31:56] his word. Amen. The bride of Christ will
[1:31:59] accept his word. She'll believe his
[1:32:02] word. And she'll live by his word.
[1:32:04] She'll be obedient to it. Amen. The Holy
[1:32:05] Spirit will never lead us astray from
[1:32:07] the word. It can't do it. It's one and
[1:32:09] the same thing. Amen. And so the spirit
[1:32:11] is a spirit of truth. Jesus said, and
[1:32:13] he'd have to go against himself to lead
[1:32:15] us contrary to his word. He would say
[1:32:17] this. He says, "Have you noticed in
[1:32:18] Revelation 22:17, the spirit and the
[1:32:21] bride say come, and let him that heareth
[1:32:24] say come." He says, "See the bride
[1:32:26] speaks the same word as does the
[1:32:28] spirit." She's a word bride, proving she
[1:32:30] has a spirit. For in every church age we
[1:32:32] hear those words, he that hath an ear,
[1:32:34] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:32:36] the churches. He said, the spirit gives
[1:32:38] the word. You say, "I'm being led by the
[1:32:40] Holy Spirit today." How many of us would
[1:32:42] say we're led by the Spirit today?
[1:32:45] No one. How many of us would say we're
[1:32:47] led by the Spirit today?
[1:32:50] Here's how you know. He said, "The
[1:32:51] spirit gives the word." Are we led by
[1:32:55] the word or are we led by something
[1:32:56] else?
[1:32:58] He says, "If you have the spirit, you
[1:33:00] will hear the word for your age as those
[1:33:03] true Christians took the word for their
[1:33:05] age."
[1:33:06] Paul wrote earlier about a church, a
[1:33:09] gentile church in the Ephesians, the
[1:33:12] book of Ephesians. Amen. And this is a
[1:33:15] people that have no natural lineage, no
[1:33:17] bloodline, no association that leads
[1:33:19] them back to truth.
[1:33:21] They are completely outside of it. Amen.
[1:33:23] They scattered through all all out the
[1:33:25] globe. Yet, but yet he says he revealed
[1:33:27] it to his servants, the prophets. He
[1:33:29] showed it all through the scriptures all
[1:33:30] before this. And you see it's hidden in
[1:33:32] the types and the shadows how that God
[1:33:35] called out one here and God called out
[1:33:37] one there and it looked like they would
[1:33:38] never be a part of the people of God.
[1:33:41] But we look at Rahab, a prostitute
[1:33:43] living in an idolatrous city
[1:33:47] being abused by mankind and yet she was
[1:33:49] a child of God. We look at Ruth serving
[1:33:52] in an idolatrous country and God comes
[1:33:54] and out of all of them pulls out just
[1:33:56] one and saves her. Amen. We look at the
[1:33:59] woman at the well. We look at Joseph's
[1:34:02] Egyptian wife. We look at Moses'
[1:34:03] Ethiopian wife and it was just one here
[1:34:05] and one there and one there. And God
[1:34:07] just took them out and joined them into
[1:34:08] that bride body. Join them into the
[1:34:11] family. Amen. It looked like they were
[1:34:13] not apart. But God said, "No, they are
[1:34:15] apart. You're looking at the outside.
[1:34:17] I'm looking beyond time. I'm looking
[1:34:20] back to eternity." Amen. And what was it
[1:34:22] doing, church? It was all pointing to a
[1:34:24] gentile bride coming in the last ages.
[1:34:27] Amen. Now, Paul would say this in
[1:34:28] Ephesians 3. He says, "Whereby when you
[1:34:30] read, ye may understand my knowledge in
[1:34:33] the mystery of Christ, which in other
[1:34:34] ages was not made known." In other
[1:34:37] words, it wasn't understood. The mystery
[1:34:39] was there. The words were there, but
[1:34:41] they didn't understand what it was
[1:34:42] talking about. It was not made known
[1:34:44] unto the sons of men. The prophets had
[1:34:46] it. They were told it, but they didn't
[1:34:47] know what it meant. He says, "As it is
[1:34:50] now revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:34:52] prophets by the spirit." Now, they move
[1:34:54] into the gentile age, the gentile
[1:34:55] dispensation. He says, "And now it's
[1:34:57] becoming clear what God was talking all
[1:34:59] about that they didn't have a clue
[1:35:00] about." And here's the clue or here's
[1:35:03] the mystery that the Gentiles should be
[1:35:05] fellows and of the same body and
[1:35:08] partakers of his promise in Christ by
[1:35:11] the gospel. In other words, God has a
[1:35:14] gentile bride, a people that are not a
[1:35:16] people.
[1:35:17] They're not a single family. The Jews
[1:35:19] were all one family. They all come from
[1:35:21] Abraham. And they can all say, "I'm a
[1:35:23] son of Abraham. I'm a daughter of
[1:35:24] Abraham." This gentile bride is
[1:35:26] scattered throughout the world. Look
[1:35:27] around us. We've got Collins. We've got
[1:35:29] coffees. We've got Curletes. We've got
[1:35:32] Monteros. We've got Grants.
[1:35:38] We've got Shaws. We've got Benjamins.
[1:35:41] She might be related to Abraham.
[1:35:44] Benjamins.
[1:35:46] We've got them all over. We're not of
[1:35:49] one blood. We're not of one family. But
[1:35:52] that's how he does it. He's pulling one
[1:35:54] from here and one from there and one
[1:35:55] from here and one from there and it
[1:35:57] doesn't look Listen, we don't all look
[1:36:00] the same. I don't know if you've
[1:36:00] noticed, Brother Garfield and I don't
[1:36:02] look the same. And he and Brother Chad
[1:36:05] look a little bit the same, but there
[1:36:06] are some major differences as well,
[1:36:08] aren't there?
[1:36:09] And some of us, we don't look at all
[1:36:11] like each other. We're completely
[1:36:13] different. Amen. But I want to take us
[1:36:16] back to a scripture that points to the
[1:36:17] calling out of a gentile bride. There
[1:36:19] are many, but I want to take us to the
[1:36:21] one that perhaps I feel is the most
[1:36:22] clear, and it's in the book of Hosea.
[1:36:24] And God says, "And I will sew her unto
[1:36:26] me in the earth, and I will have mercy
[1:36:28] upon her that had not obtained mercy."
[1:36:30] Notice, he sws in the earth.
[1:36:35] What a good man sowed seed in the earth.
[1:36:37] Who did it? The son of man.
[1:36:41] God sowed in the earth. Okay? He swed it
[1:36:44] in the earth. And he says, "Now here, I
[1:36:47] will have mercy upon her that had not
[1:36:50] obtained mercy, and I will say to them
[1:36:52] which were not my people, thou art my
[1:36:55] people, and they shall say, Thou art my
[1:36:57] God." God had judged gentile nation
[1:37:00] after gentile nation, for sacrificing
[1:37:02] their children, for idolatry, for
[1:37:04] persecuting the true people of God. Time
[1:37:07] after time, he judged them. The cup of
[1:37:09] the Amorites was full. He went into
[1:37:11] Canaan. He said, "Destroy them all.
[1:37:13] Leave none alive.
[1:37:15] Okay. But through the prophet Hosea, God
[1:37:18] says, "I'm going to have mercy on a
[1:37:19] people that have only received judgment.
[1:37:22] People that are only worthy of
[1:37:24] judgment."
[1:37:26] Why? Because I sold them.
[1:37:30] I sold them. Out of all of that judgment
[1:37:33] is going to come something worthy of
[1:37:34] mercy. Amen. He says, "I'm going to have
[1:37:37] mercy on people that deserve judgment."
[1:37:39] Church, that's why we're here today. God
[1:37:41] rich in mercy reached down and swed us
[1:37:44] in the earth. And then when it came time
[1:37:45] to reap us, he says, "I'm going to have
[1:37:47] mercy." That's one of mine. In all the
[1:37:48] weeds, I've got a little wheat planted
[1:37:50] in Newfanland. I've got a little weed
[1:37:53] planted in Jamaica. I've got a little
[1:37:55] wheat planted in in Ontario. I've got a
[1:37:57] little wheat planted in Dubai or
[1:38:01] Philippines.
[1:38:03] One here and one there. They didn't know
[1:38:05] it. We didn't know it. We didn't know
[1:38:07] what we were. Amen. But God, rich in
[1:38:08] mercy, reached out. people flung all
[1:38:10] over the world, all over the earth. And
[1:38:12] he reaches out and he harvests one here
[1:38:14] and he harvests one there. We have no
[1:38:15] access to truth. No access to Abraham.
[1:38:18] No claim to anything of God.
[1:38:21] But church, it's not by a bloodline.
[1:38:23] It's by a faith line. Amen. It's by a
[1:38:26] predestinated faith line from Almighty
[1:38:28] God. And God says, "I've got a bride in
[1:38:30] there. They're a part of me. They don't
[1:38:32] look like it. They don't seem like it.
[1:38:34] They don't even know it themselves. But
[1:38:36] in the day when the mysteries revealed,
[1:38:37] I'm going to pull them out and I'm going
[1:38:39] to show the whole world who she is.
[1:38:42] We don't know what we are. We're
[1:38:45] believing under these things, but
[1:38:46] there's a great revealing coming. And
[1:38:48] he's going to say, "She's a part of me.
[1:38:50] She didn't look like it. She didn't act
[1:38:52] like it. But I'm going to prove one day
[1:38:53] she's a part of me." Remember, Ephesians
[1:38:56] is our conquering book. It's our
[1:38:57] inheritance book. And I want you to see
[1:38:59] how we get into that position. Ephesians
[1:39:02] 2, he says, "And you had he quickened.
[1:39:04] You have he made alive who were dead in
[1:39:06] trespasses and sins. This is our natural
[1:39:09] state, church. Don't worry about your
[1:39:11] natural state. Worry about it if it's
[1:39:12] not changing.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But don't worry about what you start as.
[1:39:16] Worry about what you're turning into.
[1:39:17] That's what we're looking for. Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Wearing in times past,
[1:39:23] is it times past, church, it better be
[1:39:26] times past, it's too late. Ye walked
[1:39:28] according to the course of this world."
[1:39:30] In other words, you live the way
[1:39:31] everybody else lives.
[1:39:34] He says, "According to the prince of the
[1:39:36] power of the air, the spirit that now
[1:39:37] workketh in the children of
[1:39:39] disobedience." The way this world lives,
[1:39:41] if we're matching it, church, we're in
[1:39:42] disobedience. We're under another
[1:39:45] influence. We're under another spirit.
[1:39:46] It's a spirit of disobedience to God in
[1:39:48] his word.
[1:39:50] He says, "Among among whom also we had
[1:39:52] our conversation, we had our lives in
[1:39:54] time past in the lusts of our flesh,
[1:39:57] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:39:59] of the mind and were by nature the
[1:40:02] children of wrath even as others." In
[1:40:04] other words, we were worthy of judgment
[1:40:06] in our natural state. In our naturalb
[1:40:08] born state, we're worthy of judgment. He
[1:40:11] says, "But God who is rich in mercy."
[1:40:15] Here's the fulfillment of Hosea 2,
[1:40:16] church, for his great love wherewith he
[1:40:20] loved us.
[1:40:23] Church, when we read God's description
[1:40:24] of us in our natural state, we have to
[1:40:26] realize he doesn't love us because of
[1:40:28] how we start. He loves us because he
[1:40:31] chose to love us.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; It's elective love, not performative
[1:40:36] love. It's not based on works. It's
[1:40:37] based on his election. Amen. where I'm
[1:40:40] worthy of love. But his great love, his
[1:40:43] great love wherewith he loved me whereas
[1:40:46] he loved you. That's what brings us to
[1:40:49] the position that we're talking about.
[1:40:50] That's what brings us into the revealing
[1:40:52] of this mystery. Amen. That pulls us out
[1:40:54] of this horrible muck that we're stuck
[1:40:56] in. I mean, this body is muck.
[1:40:59] We need to be pulled out of it. Amen.
[1:41:00] And it's his great love that does it.
[1:41:03] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord this
[1:41:04] morning. He says, "Even when we were
[1:41:06] dead in sins, hath quickened us. has
[1:41:09] made us alive together with Christ. By
[1:41:12] grace are ye saved. And I say amen. By
[1:41:16] grace are you saved. And hath raised us
[1:41:19] up together and made us sit together in
[1:41:21] heavenly places in Christ. that in the
[1:41:25] ages to come. In other words, that in a
[1:41:28] span of time, he might show the
[1:41:31] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:41:36] kindness towards us through Christ
[1:41:38] Jesus.
[1:41:40] There's an ongoing revealing and acting
[1:41:42] of God's grace for his bride. Church, we
[1:41:46] live under a banner of grace, a banner
[1:41:49] of mercy, a banner of love. Amen. All
[1:41:52] the way through the ages. He says, "For
[1:41:54] by grace are ye saved through faith, and
[1:41:56] that not of yourselves. It is the gift
[1:41:58] of God, not of works, lest any man
[1:42:00] should boast. For we are his
[1:42:02] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[1:42:05] unto good works, which God had before
[1:42:08] ordained that we should walk in them."
[1:42:12] Notice it says, "We are his
[1:42:14] workmanship." In other words, God's
[1:42:16] doing the work. God's doing the
[1:42:19] starting. God's doing the finishing. And
[1:42:22] God's doing everything in between. Amen.
[1:42:24] It's like a sculptor.
[1:42:27] You go and you look. Have has anybody
[1:42:29] here ever seen a sculptor starting a
[1:42:30] work?
[1:42:32] Well, you have cuz you can just go out
[1:42:33] and you can see a piece of rock. That's
[1:42:35] what they start with. They start with
[1:42:36] just a chunk of stone. And when they
[1:42:38] look at that stone and we look at that
[1:42:40] stone, we see two very different things,
[1:42:42] don't we? Me, I see a chunk of stone. I
[1:42:46] see the flaws. I see the cracks. I see
[1:42:49] the variations in color.
[1:42:52] I look at the outside.
[1:42:55] I look at what is very visible, very
[1:42:57] apparent. But a sculptor is looking
[1:43:00] beyond the surface and he's seeing
[1:43:02] something that can come out of it. And
[1:43:05] so a sculptor is looking at a rock and
[1:43:07] he says, "This is going to be my
[1:43:08] workmanship." And so what do they do,
[1:43:11] church? Does a sculptor go work in
[1:43:12] public? Usually
[1:43:14] if he's going to make a masterpiece, he
[1:43:16] doesn't make it in public, does he? He
[1:43:18] goes and he takes it into his shed.
[1:43:20] takes it into his workshop and he closes
[1:43:22] the doors and what does he do? He starts
[1:43:24] working on it. Now, he might bring
[1:43:26] people in, they'll say, "Hey, how's it
[1:43:27] going?" He'll bring them in, they'll
[1:43:28] show he'll show it to them. Doesn't tell
[1:43:30] them what it is. He just says, "This is
[1:43:31] my masterpiece." They don't know what it
[1:43:34] is cuz first, he's just knocking off all
[1:43:36] the rough stuff. He's just getting it
[1:43:38] into a general shape. But then from
[1:43:40] there, he starts to go to find features
[1:43:43] and elements that'll make it a little
[1:43:44] more obvious. And then by the end,
[1:43:46] church, he's just working with little
[1:43:47] pieces of sandpaper just to smooth and
[1:43:50] polish it. And then what happens is he
[1:43:52] comes out and he reveals the whole thing
[1:43:54] to everyone. And we say, "Wow, I never
[1:43:57] saw that coming." How did you see that
[1:44:00] in that in that piece of stone? How many
[1:44:03] of you have gone to see that that that
[1:44:04] veiled woman um uh sculpture that's in
[1:44:07] the the the nunnery there by the uh by
[1:44:10] the basilica? It's amazing, isn't it?
[1:44:13] You literally can see her face beneath a
[1:44:15] veil of stone. It seems like,
[1:44:18] who would have thought when that man
[1:44:19] took that chunk of rock that he was
[1:44:20] going to turn out something so
[1:44:21] beautiful. But see, he knew how to do
[1:44:24] it. I couldn't do it. You probably
[1:44:26] couldn't do it. But he had a way of
[1:44:27] doing it. Amen. Paul says, "Listen, we
[1:44:30] are God's workmanship." That means,
[1:44:33] church, we're in a process. We're in a
[1:44:36] process. Don't worry if you're not
[1:44:38] finished. Don't worry if somebody else
[1:44:40] is ahead of you. It seems like we're in
[1:44:42] a process. It's a process of time. We
[1:44:45] are his workmanship. Amen. Amen. And
[1:44:47] this isn't something that he just spoke
[1:44:49] through a seven church age messenger.
[1:44:50] It's something that God has been
[1:44:51] speaking of and showing of through types
[1:44:53] and shadows for all of time. Amen. That
[1:44:56] seven church age messenger is just
[1:44:58] showing us it finally. He's showing us
[1:45:01] what it looks like. Amen. He's revealing
[1:45:02] what has been happening all along.
[1:45:04] Remember when he preached the church
[1:45:05] ages?
[1:45:08] I mean, you look at the dark ages. It's
[1:45:09] pretty hard to see Christ in the dark
[1:45:10] ages, but he still showed it to us. He
[1:45:13] showed what he was doing. He showed what
[1:45:14] he was working. He showed how God was
[1:45:15] still producing a bride out of it. And
[1:45:17] Paul says we are God's workmanship.
[1:45:19] Amen. So what we are and what we are
[1:45:21] becoming is all a product of God's work
[1:45:23] in our lives. What's our purpose? He
[1:45:26] says good works.
[1:45:29] Good works. Amen. Not just any good
[1:45:32] works. Good works that God has before
[1:45:34] ordained. That where that phrase means
[1:45:36] prepared beforehand. So, in other words,
[1:45:38] God has a plan. God has a purpose. God
[1:45:41] has a reason for each and every one of
[1:45:43] us to be here today. And he's got a path
[1:45:46] laid out. He's got a testimony laid out.
[1:45:48] He's got a purpose laid out. He's got a
[1:45:50] gift laid out. He's got a place laid out
[1:45:51] for each and every person that's a part
[1:45:53] of the body of Christ. And he's saying,
[1:45:55] "Walk where I've appointed you. Walk
[1:45:58] where I built you to walk. Do what I've
[1:46:00] told you to do in those things." Amen.
[1:46:02] Not stubborn works.
[1:46:05] Not works of partial obedience. Not
[1:46:07] works of doing it our way, not works of
[1:46:09] doing what makes us feel good or makes
[1:46:11] us feel better or makes us look good
[1:46:13] like Saul tried to do. Amen. God wants
[1:46:16] us to have his testimony,
[1:46:19] not our testimony. His testimony.
[1:46:23] He wants us to reflect him. Amen. It
[1:46:24] wants He wants it to be for his glory,
[1:46:27] not for our glory alone. Amen. He's
[1:46:29] looking for people that have produced
[1:46:30] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:46:33] and forever. Now, I'm going to close
[1:46:34] with one quote. The musicians can come
[1:46:36] if they would. Amen. I used this before,
[1:46:40] but it was so long ago. I want to
[1:46:41] refresh our mind and it'll set us up for
[1:46:43] the service on Wednesday. Lord willing.
[1:46:45] He says this. There will be a bride just
[1:46:48] as certain as I'm standing in this
[1:46:50] pulpit. There will be a bride that is
[1:46:52] washed in the blood of that lamb. And
[1:46:54] that lamb will be living among them
[1:46:57] showing super signs of his resurrection
[1:46:59] after 2,000 years. the same thing he did
[1:47:03] when he was here on earth. Amen. God
[1:47:07] bless you. Let's stand. I know I left
[1:47:08] you with an Oreo in your mouth there.
[1:47:10] Amen. But you chew on that throughout
[1:47:12] the the beginning of the week and just
[1:47:14] dwell on these things and say, "Lord, am
[1:47:16] I in your works or am I in my works? Am
[1:47:19] I in your grace or in my way?" Amen.
[1:47:22] Lord, am I walking according to the
[1:47:23] truth you showed me or am I walking
[1:47:26] according to the truth that I've made up
[1:47:28] in my mind? Amen. church. God, he's not
[1:47:31] winking at ignorance anymore, is he?
[1:47:33] He's given us everything. And he's just
[1:47:35] saying, "Just do it. Just believe it.
[1:47:38] Just obey it. I'll take care of the rest
[1:47:40] of it." Amen. I'll take care of the rest
[1:47:42] of it. I love that promise. When we walk
[1:47:44] close to him, he takes care of all of
[1:47:47] our needs. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[1:47:49] bow our heads,
[1:47:51] Lord Jesus. Lord, we're resting on your
[1:47:54] promise today. Lord, you said you'd
[1:47:56] never leave us. You said you'd never
[1:47:58] forsake us. You said if we walk in the
[1:48:00] light as you're in the light, we'd have
[1:48:02] fellowship with you and your your blood
[1:48:04] would cleanse us from all sin.
[1:48:07] Lord, we're trusting in your promises
[1:48:09] this morning. Lord, we're trusting.
[1:48:11] We're a part of that great revealing,
[1:48:13] that mystery revealing of you and your
[1:48:15] bride, heavenly father. Let a part of
[1:48:17] that chosen elect people, Lord, that you
[1:48:19] had in your mind and your thoughts
[1:48:21] before the foundation of the world.
[1:48:23] Lord, this word is drawing us back to
[1:48:25] you. Lord, I pray you help us to read it
[1:48:27] every day. Lord, to anchor it in our
[1:48:30] hearts every day, Lord, that we would
[1:48:31] filter our lives through that word every
[1:48:33] single day. Lord, may there be a love
[1:48:35] for you, Lord. May there be a hunger for
[1:48:38] you, a thirst for you, Lord, that keeps
[1:48:40] us in your presence day by day. Lord, I
[1:48:43] know we need a refreshing. Lord, this
[1:48:45] life can get us so down. These battles,
[1:48:47] these struggles, the busyiness, Lord,
[1:48:49] the circumstances of life are just there
[1:48:51] to try and beat us down in our faith.
[1:48:53] Lord, help us to come back to your word.
[1:48:55] Lord, help us to dwell in your presence,
[1:48:57] Lord Jesus, Lord, that we could be
[1:49:00] children, Lord, that we could be sons
[1:49:02] and daughters of God. Lord, great
[1:49:04] lights. We pray, Lord, bless your
[1:49:06] people, remembering Brother Paul, Lord,
[1:49:08] who's sick especially, Lord, praying
[1:49:09] grace for your servant. Lord, we need
[1:49:11] him here, Lord. We need him at his post
[1:49:14] of duty. Lord, praying you restore him
[1:49:16] to his family and to this church body.
[1:49:17] We pray Lord those that aren't here
[1:49:19] today, Brother Kingsley, Sister Melody,
[1:49:21] Lord, praying your grace to them, Lord.
[1:49:23] Each one, Lord, that couldn't make it,
[1:49:25] Lord. We ask your grace, Lord, be with
[1:49:27] us now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:49:37] When the redeemed gather 208
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:46] I am thinking of the rapture in our
[1:49:50] blessed home on high when the redeemed

[1:53:13] Oh, once like a bird in prison. I dwell
[1:53:18] 265. No freedom from my sorrow I fell.
[1:53:25] Then Jesus came and listened to me. And
[1:53:31] glory to God, he set me free. Oh, he set
[1:53:38] me free. Yes, he set me free.

[1:56:59] Victory today. Second verse 649.
[1:57:04] Oh, when I woke this morning, I didn't
[1:57:08] have no doubt. I knew that the Lord
[1:57:12] would bring me out.
[1:57:15] And so I got down on my knees. I said,
[1:57:19] "Lord, if you please, I got up singing
[1:57:23] and shouting the victory.
[1:57:27] Victory is mine.

[2:02:56] that are left in us, Lord Jesus. Prepare
[2:02:59] us for the rapture, Lord.
[2:03:02] Help us Lord to seek your will daily.
