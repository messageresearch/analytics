[41:56] turn if you would to John chapter
[41:58] 16 John 16 and verse 12 it's good to see
[42:01] sister Nikki back with brother jine and
[42:04] then back from the warm shores of
[42:05] Jamaica back to our the Frozen chosen up
[42:09] north here amen but it's good to have
[42:11] you back safely and appreciate this
[42:13] special sister Selena God bless
[42:15] you and then a a little word of
[42:19] Correction this morning I noticed that
[42:22] uh virtually everybody was late for
[42:23] Sunday school brother Paul goes through
[42:26] a lot of effort sister Kimberly goes
[42:28] through a lot of effort to prepare they
[42:30] don't have much time to do it and so if
[42:33] the people are coming late then they
[42:34] start late which puts them late coming
[42:36] back into the surface which puts a rush
[42:38] in when brother Bob's trying to start
[42:39] the service and he only has half the
[42:41] people here we can be on time or early
[42:45] for food we can be on time or early for
[42:47] school we can be on time or early for
[42:50] hockey games and entertainment and fun
[42:53] if we can't get to church on time we've
[42:55] got our priorities wrong it's that
[42:56] simple I'm not going to sugarcoat it and
[42:59] then I've got enough respect for brother
[43:00] Paul and sister Kimberly's work and
[43:02] brother Paul brother Bob trying to set
[43:03] an atmosphere of worship that we
[43:05] shouldn't have people coming in at the
[43:06] last minute so I don't want to see
[43:08] people dragging in at 10:25 that's when
[43:11] Sunday school starts we should be here
[43:13] 10:20 so that we've got our jackets put
[43:16] away so that we're settled and we're
[43:17] ready to go and that way he can be in at
[43:19] 5: to 11: so that brother Bob is not
[43:22] dealing with the Russia people and not
[43:24] working with half a church of people
[43:26] just waking up and and getting ready to
[43:27] sing so we should be in the sanctuary
[43:30] Everybody by 5: to 11: amen amen God
[43:34] bless you we need to
[43:36] respect the effort that people have put
[43:39] in the gifts that God's using and we do
[43:41] that in the mornings by being on time so
[43:45] amen trust that hits the mark this
[43:47] morning amen John chapter 16 verse2 says
[43:51] this I have yet many things to say unto
[43:54] you but you cannot bear them now
[43:57] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[43:59] come he will guide you into all Truth
[44:01] for he shall not speak of himself but
[44:04] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[44:06] speak and he will show you things to
[44:09] come amen God bless you you can have
[44:10] your seats this morning we're continuing
[44:12] our series on the Holy Ghost and we want
[44:14] to take a second service and we'll take
[44:16] one more at least on this I believe on
[44:18] how do I know that I have the Holy
[44:20] Spirit how do I know I've received the
[44:22] Holy Spirit and we started this in the
[44:24] last service on last Wednesday and we
[44:26] get we ask the question why was the Holy
[44:29] Ghost sent in the first place because if
[44:31] we want an Evidence of what of of having
[44:33] it then we ought to know why it was sent
[44:35] because the two of those ought to be
[44:36] matched God's not going to send his
[44:37] spirit with purpose and then give us a
[44:39] completely different evidence that makes
[44:41] no sense and so we preached from Ezekiel
[44:43] 36 and he said I'm going to going to
[44:45] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[44:46] but at the end of that he says I will
[44:48] put my spirit within you and cause you
[44:51] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[44:53] keep my judgments and do them that word
[44:55] caused there I didn't dwell on the this
[44:57] too much last service I've left it for
[44:58] here that word cause means I'm going to
[45:01] accomplish I'm going to perform by a
[45:04] creative
[45:06] act catch that now this is not something
[45:08] that happens by our choice or by our our
[45:12] will our personal will or desire but
[45:14] it's a it's it's conditional on a
[45:16] creative act and what is it it's the
[45:18] seed word of God coming to life inside
[45:20] of you that's what happens when the
[45:22] spirit of God comes across our life when
[45:24] the word of God flashes across us that
[45:27] light brings that seed to life and
[45:29] that's based on a creative act of God
[45:31] way back before the foundation of the
[45:33] world where he declared you're a child
[45:34] of God Amen it's not of our own will but
[45:37] then he says I'm going to cause you to
[45:39] do what this this creative act is going
[45:41] to cause you to walk in my statutes and
[45:43] that means to live and act according to
[45:45] the word of God so in other words we are
[45:47] not just hearers and we are not just
[45:49] talkers but we are doers amen and that's
[45:52] what it's supposed to do so we saw the
[45:54] purpose of the spirit being sent back
[45:56] was not to be just around us not to be
[45:59] with us only but it was meant to be
[46:01] within us and that's what would cause us
[46:03] to live according to the word God wants
[46:05] us to live by the word because that's
[46:07] the only thing that can set us free
[46:09] that's the only thing that's going to
[46:10] work we have all sorts of self-help
[46:12] programs and and books and these
[46:14] different things there's only one book
[46:16] there's only one word there's only one
[46:17] Spirit that'll truly set us free and
[46:19] that's the Living Word of God Amen then
[46:22] we moved over to Jesus ministry and I'm
[46:24] just setting a quick Foundation this
[46:25] morning for those that weren't here and
[46:27] able to hear it and Jesus said unto them
[46:29] if God were your father he's speaking to
[46:31] the ministry now the priesthood if God
[46:33] were your father you would love me for I
[46:35] proceeded forth and come from God
[46:37] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[46:40] why do you not understand my speech he
[46:43] says even because you cannot hear his my
[46:46] word now they could hear his word with
[46:48] their ears they could hear it
[46:49] intellectually but they could not
[46:51] receive it much less accept it and Obey
[46:54] it so Jesus said because you can't
[46:56] accept it it you can't receive it and
[46:58] because you can't receive it you won't
[47:01] ever get the benefit of it you think
[47:03] you've got it but you don't why what was
[47:05] the problem here Church the problem was
[47:07] they had a
[47:09] personally uh created revelation of what
[47:11] the word of God meant they had come up
[47:13] with their own interpretation of what
[47:15] God intended by the books and the law of
[47:18] Moses and all the other prophets and so
[47:20] when the Living Word came they refused
[47:22] to lay down their personal
[47:23] interpretation for the real
[47:25] interpretation and in doing so they gave
[47:27] up the opportunity to be a living
[47:29] epistle he says ye are of your father
[47:31] the devil and the lust of your father ye
[47:33] will do he was a murderer from the
[47:35] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[47:37] because there is no truth in him when he
[47:40] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[47:42] for he is a liar and the father of it he
[47:45] he says and because I tell you the truth
[47:47] you believe me not why because there's
[47:48] no truth in them to receive it which of
[47:51] you convinces me of sin and if I say the
[47:53] truth why do you not believe me he that
[47:56] is of god heareth God's word ye
[47:59] therefore hear them not because ye are
[48:01] not of God so Jesus gives here the the
[48:04] proof the evidence of somebody being a
[48:06] child of God and that evidence is that
[48:09] they can hear the word of God now we
[48:11] spoke last service how that word hear
[48:13] does not just mean to hear but it's
[48:14] implicit that if you hear it you will
[48:16] obey it you will accept it you will
[48:19] receive it and you will obey the word of
[48:21] God and only a child of God can receive
[48:24] the full word of God Amen a child of
[48:27] Satan can't do that a child of the devil
[48:28] of Darkness can't do that now they can
[48:31] take at a certain distance don't think
[48:33] for a second they can't because there's
[48:35] can be an emotional appeal to the word
[48:37] of God there can be an intellectual
[48:39] appeal there can be a relational appeal
[48:42] people like to be accepted I don't think
[48:44] we realize how much we're blessed to
[48:46] have Believers around us all the time
[48:49] people struggle with covid I had no
[48:51] problems with Co because why I have a
[48:53] family of Believers around me there's a
[48:55] great benefit to have having good people
[48:58] around you all the
[48:59] time but that's not going to be the
[49:01] proof of it and as soon as as pain comes
[49:04] as pressure comes as separation comes as
[49:07] offense comes by the word and causes an
[49:09] impact on our life that we don't like
[49:11] what not we like not not our lives I
[49:13] trust but a child of Satan they can have
[49:16] stuck with the word to that point but
[49:17] eventually they will compromise and back
[49:20] away because it's not in them to take
[49:21] the word over their own Comfort or
[49:23] preference they'll always back away but
[49:26] says this he says remember now John the
[49:29] Baptist was both the prophet and the
[49:30] messenger of his day he was filled with
[49:33] the holy ghost from his mother's womb
[49:35] when he was baptizing in Jordan the word
[49:37] of God which is Jesus came to him he
[49:40] says the word always comes to the true
[49:42] spirit filled that is the evidence of
[49:45] being filled with the Holy Ghost that is
[49:47] what Jesus said would be the evidence he
[49:49] says and I will pray the father and he
[49:51] will send you another comforter that he
[49:53] may excuse me abide with you forever
[49:55] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[49:59] cannot receive so you cannot be of this
[50:01] world and receive the Holy Spirit you
[50:03] cannot be a child of Hell a child of
[50:05] Darkness a child of Satan and receive
[50:07] the spirit it is only for the children
[50:09] of God that's the only ones that can
[50:11] receive it because they're the only ones
[50:12] that can receive the word he says now
[50:15] you know what truth is and he references
[50:17] John 17:17 Thy word is truth again in
[50:19] John 8:43 why do you not understand my
[50:23] speech because you cannot hear my word
[50:26] he says did you notice that Jesus said
[50:28] that the world could not receive the
[50:29] Holy Ghost well in this verse I just
[50:31] read neither could they receive the word
[50:34] why he says because the spirit and the
[50:36] word are one and if you have the Holy
[50:39] Spirit as the prophets the word would
[50:42] come to you you would receive it it will
[50:45] come to you and you will receive it and
[50:47] he says in John 14:26 but the comforter
[50:50] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[50:52] will send in my name he shall teach you
[50:54] all things and bring all things to your
[50:57] remembrance whatsoever I've said unto
[50:58] you he says here again we find the word
[51:01] coming because of the spirit of God
[51:04] again in John 16:13 how be it he when he
[51:07] the spirit of Truth which is the word is
[51:09] come he will guide you into all truth
[51:12] Thy word is all is truth and he shall
[51:14] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[51:16] shall hear the word of God that shall he
[51:19] speak the word and he will show you
[51:21] things to come he says it's the spirit
[51:23] bringing the word of Prophecy now you
[51:25] have to be really careful with this
[51:27] because people look at that and say the
[51:28] Holy Ghost is going to do that but how
[51:30] is he going to do that let's let the
[51:33] word interpret itself how does he do it
[51:36] he takes the word and he gives it to
[51:39] men men are the Holy Spirit speaking if
[51:42] they are true Spirit-filled sons of God
[51:45] because as they hear the Holy Spirit
[51:47] doesn't hear the holy spirit is God
[51:49] himself but what is it those that have
[51:51] the Holy Spirit will hear what it gives
[51:54] them and they'll speak it and it will
[51:56] always point back to the word that's the
[51:59] way that it works amen he says I want
[52:01] you to note very carefully that Jesus
[52:03] did not say the evidence of being
[52:04] baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[52:06] speaking in tongues interpreting
[52:08] prophesying or shouting and dancing he
[52:11] said the evidence would be that you
[52:12] would be in the truth you would be in
[52:15] the word of God for your age he says the
[52:17] evidence has to do with receiving that
[52:21] word now we're not going to dwell too
[52:23] much on what that means that'll be the
[52:24] next service Lord willing how do you
[52:26] know that that you've received the word
[52:27] but the the we'll just leave it at this
[52:29] point that to receive the word is to
[52:31] prove that the holy spirit is working in
[52:32] your life now watch what Jesus says
[52:34] about the
[52:36] priests because this really ties into
[52:38] where we're going today he says and he
[52:40] answered and said unto them well ha
[52:41] Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites at
[52:44] it is as it is written this people
[52:46] honors me with their lips but their
[52:48] heart is far from me they say the right
[52:50] things he says but their heart
[52:51] intentions and their inner desires do
[52:54] not match their words when you really
[52:57] start pushing when the pain comes when
[52:59] the pressure comes something comes out
[53:01] and it's not the spirit of God it's not
[53:02] the word of God he says how be it in
[53:05] vain do they worship me teaching for
[53:08] doctrines the Commandments of men so
[53:10] they've made up their own religion it's
[53:11] not even so much that they've laid aside
[53:13] the word of God but rather they've added
[53:16] to it as we see in the next verse he
[53:19] says for laying aside the Commandments
[53:21] of God ye hold the tradition of men as
[53:25] the washing of pots and cups and many
[53:27] other such things like you do so they
[53:29] tried to add their part to the word of
[53:31] God what happened was his disciples ate
[53:33] with unwashed hands they said hey you
[53:35] guys aren't following the word and Jesus
[53:37] says that's not the word Moses never
[53:38] said that you're the ones that came up
[53:40] with that and if they they prepared food
[53:42] with certain utensils then it couldn't
[53:44] touch other food there was clean and
[53:46] unclean things that that that it could
[53:48] touch and had to be separated and washed
[53:50] and they added this burden of constant
[53:53] cleanliness and it was only self-
[53:55] religion it was only to try and make
[53:57] themselves feel better about it it was
[53:59] all ritualistic cleansing and washing he
[54:02] says but he said unto them full well ye
[54:04] reject the Commandment of God that you
[54:07] may keep your own tradition so when por
[54:09] came to shove they'd focus more on what
[54:11] they'd come up with what they' added to
[54:13] the word of God what made them feel
[54:15] spiritual rather than simply doing it as
[54:18] God had delivered it to Moses and the
[54:19] prophets amen they put their own ideas
[54:24] above the word of God and when they came
[54:25] to Jesus and his disciples they're
[54:27] pointing at them and and finding fault
[54:30] that those men did not meet up with
[54:32] their manly
[54:34] ideas
[54:36] okay this is what we would call a
[54:38] denomination today it's when men have
[54:40] added their ideas to the word of God and
[54:44] come up with a religion a way of living
[54:46] spiritually that satisfies them but it
[54:49] doesn't meet the word of God and we see
[54:51] that it's something that has been alive
[54:52] and well since Cain remember remember
[54:55] Cain only had to do one thing and that
[54:57] was sacrifice a lamb and he refused
[54:59] because he wasn't in him to obey and he
[55:02] wanted to do it his way with the things
[55:04] that he grown and the and the things
[55:06] that he accomplished in his farming life
[55:08] and these different things and what's
[55:09] the net effect of this it's in verse 13
[55:11] He says in doing this you are making the
[55:13] word of God of none effect through your
[55:16] tradition which ye have delivered and
[55:19] many such like things you do that word
[55:22] none effect that phrase none effect it
[55:23] means to nullify nullify to ow validate
[55:26] to void to take away the power so what
[55:31] they' done by this time by the time that
[55:33] Christ comes in human flesh they've had
[55:35] 1300 years of adding to the word of God
[55:39] and he says what you've done is you've
[55:40] taken away any power that it had in it
[55:42] and all you've done is you bound the
[55:44] people to your own ideas to New
[55:47] Traditions they put chains of bondage on
[55:50] the ly and then they were going around
[55:52] and pointing fingers at them and making
[55:54] their lives even more difficult than
[55:55] they had to be church if that's how far
[55:58] they went in 1300 years how far has the
[56:00] church gotten off the path of the word
[56:02] after 2,000 years it's worse it's worse
[56:05] and it's wound its way through through
[56:07] history and through tradition and these
[56:09] things amen that's why we needed a
[56:11] Malachi 4
[56:13] restoration was because God had to come
[56:16] and turn our hearts back to the original
[56:18] faith of the Pentecostal fathers of the
[56:20] apostolic fathers from the day of
[56:22] Pentecost because even in the days of uh
[56:25] of Paul and Peter they were saying
[56:27] listen you're already getting away from
[56:29] the gospel within 20 or 30 years not
[56:32] even that they were already getting away
[56:35] what we have this tendency to add to the
[56:37] word of God for our personal spiritual
[56:41] benefit we want to make ourselves more
[56:43] spiritual church we have to be so
[56:45] careful so careful that we we clarify
[56:49] what is a personal
[56:51] conviction and what is the word of God
[56:53] especially to our children listen we can
[56:56] go into each other's homes and and see
[56:58] the things that we do and it's okay to
[57:01] hold to a particular standard in your
[57:03] family I believe that that is Sovereign
[57:06] to every single person in the body Paul
[57:09] confirms it in in Romans 14 I think
[57:11] something like that but but we have to
[57:14] be so careful that we clarify that what
[57:17] we're doing is by leadership not by
[57:20] necessarily the word of God because I
[57:23] have weaknesses you don't have and you
[57:24] have weaknesses I don't have and so God
[57:27] will deal with me differently than he
[57:28] deals with you and the thing you have to
[57:30] realize is that you are not your
[57:32] children and your children are not you
[57:34] listen we may have a different standard
[57:36] at times for our own children because
[57:37] some are weaker than others in certain
[57:40] areas whether it's Sports whether it's
[57:42] entertainment whether it's music whether
[57:44] it's books clothing education jobs
[57:47] whatever it might be some of us have
[57:48] tendencies that lean towards not good
[57:51] for us and so we need tighter boundaries
[57:54] perhaps than those that don't have those
[57:56] issues but remember Paul would say
[57:58] whatsoever is not a faith is sin if God
[58:01] convicts your heart to do it then do it
[58:05] but if he doesn't convict somebody
[58:06] else's heart then don't go to them and
[58:08] say why are you doing this unless it is
[58:10] a genuine word issue we have to be led
[58:13] by the spirit amen but we all answer to
[58:16] God for how we lead our lives but I
[58:17] trust it'll be the Holy Spirit leading
[58:19] us and not a traditions of men because
[58:22] traditions of men bind us and what they
[58:25] do is they take away power from the real
[58:26] word of
[58:27] God Jesus was trying to break the people
[58:30] from this and how did he do it he
[58:32] pointed back to the word he's saying
[58:35] where did you get that in the word he
[58:37] asks the hard questions he points out
[58:38] the hypocrisy because they use these to
[58:41] benefit themselves to make themselves
[58:43] look better to put others down and then
[58:45] they would use these these little little
[58:47] uh loopholes he would talk about how you
[58:50] you say you can't help your your parents
[58:52] because you say I've dedicated that
[58:54] money to God your parents would have a
[58:56] need and then you'd say well I can't do
[58:57] it i' I've dedicated that money to God
[58:59] he says that's not what I told you to do
[59:01] if you've got money use it for your
[59:02] parents honor your parents if you pay
[59:04] your tithes and offerings don't shelter
[59:06] what you
[59:08] have on the under under a headship of
[59:11] propos of spir spirituality it's not the
[59:14] real deal he was trying to get them out
[59:16] of the bondage they created so they
[59:18] could come into the Liberty that he
[59:19] offered them by the gospel but even with
[59:21] his disciples we see that Jesus could
[59:23] only go so far and we see in the Book of
[59:25] John right before his death on the on
[59:28] the night of the Passover he says I have
[59:30] yet many things to say unto you but you
[59:32] cannot bear them now he could only take
[59:35] them so far in the word where they were
[59:37] right there he shared things with them
[59:39] that he didn't share with anybody else
[59:41] but even he comes to the point where he
[59:43] says I've got more to tell you but I
[59:44] can't tell you now and the reason is
[59:47] verse number 13 He says how be it when
[59:49] he the spirit of Truth is come he will
[59:51] guide you into all truth so they can
[59:53] only go so far until they get the back
[59:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then they
[59:58] can go all the
[59:59] way he says for he shall not speak of
[1:00:01] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:00:04] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:00:06] things to come so they need to receive
[1:00:07] the holy spirit before they can move
[1:00:09] into a greater revelation of the word of
[1:00:11] God otherwise they're limited by their
[1:00:13] own experience by their own emotions by
[1:00:15] their own Spirit but remember they've
[1:00:17] been baptized they've been taught
[1:00:19] they've been in great revivals they've
[1:00:20] had signs and wonders they've been in
[1:00:22] tremendous meetings they've been able to
[1:00:24] sit at the feet of Jesus and learn
[1:00:26] they've got Mysteries but Jesus says
[1:00:28] until you get the Holy Spirit I can only
[1:00:30] go so
[1:00:31] far I can tell you things but you won't
[1:00:34] get them or you can't handle them there
[1:00:37] are things that we only say to people
[1:00:39] really we only preach to people that
[1:00:41] have the Holy Ghost because it'll
[1:00:42] stumble somebody that
[1:00:44] doesn't absolutely it
[1:00:46] will remember Judas had stayed with them
[1:00:48] to this point but there's one thing
[1:00:50] Judas couldn't do and that was receive
[1:00:52] the holy spirit that was the separating
[1:00:54] line he says he shall glorify me for he
[1:00:57] shall receive of mine and will show it
[1:00:59] unto you the so the holy spirit will
[1:01:00] always point you back to Christ the word
[1:01:03] amen now Ezekiel said that the purpose
[1:01:05] of the spirit being given was to cause
[1:01:07] us to live with the word of God Jesus
[1:01:09] said that the Holy Spirit would guide us
[1:01:10] into all truth Jesus said Thy word is
[1:01:13] truth amen so if we take all of that
[1:01:16] into John 16 and13 we can substitute it
[1:01:19] this way if you'll grant me that this
[1:01:21] morning he says how be it when he the
[1:01:23] Holy Spirit has come he will guide you
[1:01:25] he sent said into all truth but what
[1:01:27] he's saying is into all the word of God
[1:01:30] that's how we know the holy spirit is
[1:01:32] working in our life is that he will
[1:01:34] guide us
[1:01:35] into into that's where you and the word
[1:01:39] become one it's not guide you to it's
[1:01:42] guide you into it's a positional placing
[1:01:45] of you into the body of Christ to where
[1:01:47] you and the word become one where you
[1:01:49] can be as Paul said a living epistle
[1:01:51] that when people see you they see the
[1:01:53] word that's what he's talking about not
[1:01:56] head
[1:01:57] knowledge not
[1:01:59] Doctrine but this is a life lived by the
[1:02:01] word of God it's the word living through
[1:02:04] US amen and that's exactly exactly what
[1:02:06] he was talking about in Ezekiel 36 that
[1:02:08] you can't walk in the word until the
[1:02:10] spirit comes to you but when the spirit
[1:02:13] comes he reveals the word and as he
[1:02:15] reveals the word you start to walk in it
[1:02:18] and the more he reveals the more you
[1:02:20] walk and the more you walk the greater
[1:02:21] benefit the greater reality comes with
[1:02:23] it amen we can only walk in the light as
[1:02:26] he gives it he doesn't hold us
[1:02:28] accountable for what we don't know but
[1:02:30] once he gives it to us once he shows it
[1:02:32] to us his intention is that we become
[1:02:34] one with it not that we just sit there
[1:02:36] and say oh that looks really good but we
[1:02:37] say Lord let me become what I see let me
[1:02:41] walk daily by this Jesus continues he
[1:02:44] says Jesus answered and said unto him if
[1:02:46] a man love me he will do one thing he
[1:02:50] will keep my words and my father will
[1:02:54] love him and we will come unto him him
[1:02:56] and make our abow with him we have
[1:02:58] people today saying I love Jesus you go
[1:03:01] talk to a professing Christian they say
[1:03:03] I love Jesus Jesus said if you love me
[1:03:06] you'll keep my words and what happens is
[1:03:08] you bring the word test and you say well
[1:03:11] do you do you go to church well I don't
[1:03:13] really believe that I have to go to
[1:03:14] church because I love Jesus and it's a
[1:03:16] personal Affair but his word says that
[1:03:18] we ought to not forsake the assembling
[1:03:20] of ourselves together
[1:03:23] amen and just the Simplicity of the go
[1:03:25] goel even that so many won't do it have
[1:03:28] you separated from the world since you
[1:03:31] received
[1:03:32] Christ well he's looking at the heart
[1:03:34] yes he is looking at the heart but he's
[1:03:36] supposed to have given you a new one do
[1:03:37] you have a new one yet well it doesn't
[1:03:39] matter I'm under the blood of Christ see
[1:03:41] they can't fulfill the
[1:03:43] word they might love him they might have
[1:03:45] an emotional connection to a Jesus
[1:03:47] they've created but they don't love him
[1:03:49] truly because they don't keep his words
[1:03:51] and he says if you can't keep my word
[1:03:53] then I can't come to you it's those that
[1:03:56] receive it and keep it and become a part
[1:03:58] of it that's for the spirit filled amen
[1:04:00] he says he that loveth me not keepeth
[1:04:02] not my Saints very simple if you won't
[1:04:05] go by the word then you don't love God
[1:04:08] very simple he says and the word which
[1:04:10] you hear is not mine but the fathers
[1:04:11] which sent me these things have I spoken
[1:04:14] unto you being yet present with you but
[1:04:16] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[1:04:18] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:04:20] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:04:24] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:04:26] have said unto you so he says when the
[1:04:29] Holy Spirit comes he will guide us into
[1:04:31] truth he will guide us into the word
[1:04:33] first and foremost now there are
[1:04:36] benefits there are manifestations there
[1:04:38] are gifts and all these different things
[1:04:40] there are big emotions I believe with
[1:04:42] the presence of God
[1:04:43] absolutely if we can come into the
[1:04:46] presence of God if we can feel the
[1:04:47] presence of God and nothing is changed
[1:04:49] in this in this body or in our spirit
[1:04:51] then I think there's a problem if we
[1:04:53] claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:55] but evidence of the spirit is receiving
[1:04:58] the word of God because why he'll take
[1:05:01] us into the word he'll take us into the
[1:05:03] truth that's how we know we have the
[1:05:05] spirit he takes us into the truth R says
[1:05:08] in 1 Corinthians 14:37 if many man think
[1:05:11] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:05:13] him acknowledge that the things that I
[1:05:15] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:05:16] the Lord he says now see that the proof
[1:05:19] of the indwelling spirit was to
[1:05:20] acknowledge and follow what God's
[1:05:22] Prophet gave for his age as he set the
[1:05:24] church in order Paul had to say to those
[1:05:27] who claimed another Revelation what came
[1:05:29] the word of God out from you or came it
[1:05:31] unto you only he says the evidence of a
[1:05:34] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:05:37] to produce the truth the word but to
[1:05:40] receive the truth the word and to
[1:05:43] believe it and Obey it so in other words
[1:05:46] I am not the source of inspiration or
[1:05:48] Revelation you are not the source of
[1:05:50] inspiration Revelation but you are the
[1:05:52] receiver of the re of the revelation of
[1:05:54] the word amen it does not come from me
[1:05:57] it comes to me it does not come from you
[1:05:59] it comes to you amen we are children of
[1:06:02] God we have to receive it before we can
[1:06:05] give it and what was happening was Paul
[1:06:07] was pointing to these ministers that got
[1:06:08] all cocky and caught up in themselves
[1:06:10] and he says hey do you think this came
[1:06:12] to you from you or to you because you're
[1:06:14] acting as if it came out of you as if
[1:06:17] you came up with it rather than the Holy
[1:06:18] Spirit was the inspiration and you
[1:06:20] received
[1:06:21] it he says have you noticed in
[1:06:23] Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the
[1:06:26] bride say come and let him that heareth
[1:06:29] say come see the bride speaks the same
[1:06:31] word as does the spirit she is a word
[1:06:34] bride proving she has the spirit in
[1:06:37] every Church age we hear these words he
[1:06:39] that ha an ear let him hear what the
[1:06:41] spirit saith unto the churches the
[1:06:43] spirit gives the word and if you have
[1:06:46] the spirit you will hear the word for
[1:06:48] your age as those true Christians took
[1:06:50] the word for their
[1:06:52] age he says did you get that last
[1:06:55] thought
[1:06:56] I repeat every Church age ends with the
[1:06:58] same admonition he that have an ear let
[1:07:01] him an individual hear what the spirit
[1:07:03] say to the churches the spirit gives the
[1:07:06] word he has the truth for each age each
[1:07:09] age has had its own elect and that elect
[1:07:11] group always heard the word and received
[1:07:14] it proving they had the seed in them
[1:07:16] John 8:47 says and he that is of God
[1:07:19] heareth God's words ye therefore hear
[1:07:21] them not because you are not of God they
[1:07:23] refused the word Jesus and his word
[1:07:25] words for their days but the true seed
[1:07:27] received the word because they were of
[1:07:31] God he says and Allah he's reading on
[1:07:34] Isaiah and all thy children shall be
[1:07:36] taught of God of the Holy Spirit Jesus
[1:07:38] said the same thing in John 6:45 being
[1:07:41] one with the word proves whether you are
[1:07:43] of God and spirit filled there is no
[1:07:47] other Criterion that's where we stand
[1:07:49] this morning that's what this church
[1:07:51] believes is that it is you and the word
[1:07:53] becoming one you may or may not have
[1:07:55] manifestations you may or may not have
[1:07:57] gifts you may or may not have great
[1:07:59] emotions dancing shouting all those
[1:08:01] things we believe in all of it believe
[1:08:03] in all of it it's if that's what God
[1:08:05] does in your life then we say praise the
[1:08:07] Lord but that is not what makes us a
[1:08:09] child of God what makes us a child of
[1:08:11] God is that we are joined with the word
[1:08:14] amen he says but what are tongues and
[1:08:18] interpretation and the other gifts he
[1:08:20] says they are manifestations that is
[1:08:22] what the word teaches read it in 1
[1:08:24] Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation
[1:08:26] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:08:29] profit with all then Paul names those
[1:08:31] manifestations he says now comes this
[1:08:34] very good question that I know you're
[1:08:35] all anxious to ask why isn't the
[1:08:37] manifestation an Evidence of being
[1:08:39] baptized with the Holy Ghost because you
[1:08:42] surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost
[1:08:44] unless you truly were Spirit-filled in
[1:08:47] other words how is it that people could
[1:08:48] express the gifts and the manifestations
[1:08:51] of the Holy Spirit if they didn't have
[1:08:52] it he says now I wish I could say that
[1:08:55] is right because I don't like to hurt
[1:08:57] people or walk on their Doctrine but I
[1:08:59] wouldn't be a true servant of God if I
[1:09:01] didn't tell you the whole counsel of God
[1:09:03] now I'm not going to read what he says
[1:09:05] but I'll I'll summarize it quickly he
[1:09:07] talks about balum balum was a prophet in
[1:09:10] the Old Testament he had a true gift of
[1:09:15] Prophecy absolutely and he would say he
[1:09:17] gave one of the most beautiful
[1:09:19] prophecies in the Old Testament under
[1:09:21] the anointing of the Holy Spirit but
[1:09:23] what happened was he took it he took the
[1:09:25] wages of unrighteousness for personal
[1:09:28] gain he laid aside the perfect will of
[1:09:31] God and he ended up teaching the
[1:09:33] moabites how to bring Israel into
[1:09:36] idolatry which is spiritual fornication
[1:09:38] with God and brought judgment rather
[1:09:41] than a
[1:09:42] blessing then he would talk about
[1:09:44] Caiaphas in the days of Jesus the high
[1:09:46] priest and Caiaphas prophesies about
[1:09:49] Jesus death and it was absolutely a
[1:09:51] perfect and correct prophecy and then he
[1:09:54] went and he crucified if Jesus then he
[1:09:57] talks about Judas Judas had signs and
[1:09:59] wonders Judas healed the sick Judas
[1:10:02] raised the dead Judas cast out demons
[1:10:05] all manifestations of the power of God
[1:10:08] on him and yet Judas betrayed Christ and
[1:10:12] was called the son of
[1:10:14] predition he was
[1:10:16] lost he could never receive the spirit
[1:10:19] but he could be under an anointing
[1:10:22] absolutely a false vessel with a true
[1:10:24] anointing
[1:10:26] and we'll see it in other places in the
[1:10:27] scripture as we go
[1:10:29] through and then he says this he says
[1:10:31] yet he had a genuine
[1:10:33] manifestation of the Holy Ghost we can't
[1:10:36] deny that so where is manifestation as
[1:10:39] an Evidence it isn't there if you are
[1:10:41] truly spirit filled or truly filled with
[1:10:43] the spirit of God you will have the
[1:10:45] evidence of the word in your life in
[1:10:50] your life amen so as he he talked about
[1:10:52] if you go to Revelations 2 and 3 and you
[1:10:54] read those admonitions to the church
[1:10:56] ages it was for seven literal churches
[1:10:59] back then but primarily it was meant for
[1:11:01] the future Church ages coming over the
[1:11:03] next 2,000 years and to every single age
[1:11:06] the holy spirit said something but it
[1:11:08] was only said to one person it said to
[1:11:12] the angel of the Church of Ephesus to
[1:11:13] the angel of the Church of Smyrna and
[1:11:15] Philadelphia and these different ones to
[1:11:17] the Church of the to the angel of the
[1:11:19] Church of leoda write in other words the
[1:11:22] Holy Spirit sends a message or brings a
[1:11:24] message to one man one messenger for
[1:11:27] that age it wasn't sent to preachers it
[1:11:29] wasn't sent to priests it wasn't sent to
[1:11:31] the pope it wasn't sent to some
[1:11:33] conglomeration of religious people it
[1:11:35] was sent to one man and then that man
[1:11:37] went and shared it with professing
[1:11:39] Christians and he would share that
[1:11:41] message and he would go around the
[1:11:42] churches and those that received it
[1:11:44] would take that message and carry it on
[1:11:47] and there were those that did not reive
[1:11:49] that message and they would go on their
[1:11:51] way and you'll find in the church ages
[1:11:53] that very few would receive Reed the
[1:11:55] message for their day because why they
[1:11:58] gotten caught up in the traditions of
[1:11:59] men amen even while Paul and Peter were
[1:12:02] alive as I mentioned the churches were
[1:12:04] already falling away preachers were
[1:12:06] forsaking what Paul said and coming up
[1:12:09] with their own ideas so they could
[1:12:11] promote themselves so they could build
[1:12:12] their Ministries so they could create
[1:12:14] wealth and influence it was the me
[1:12:16] monster all over again they were wanting
[1:12:18] something for themselves and what it was
[1:12:20] was power they wanted power but what
[1:12:23] happens was when we take the power to
[1:12:25] ourselves we lose the power of the word
[1:12:27] and so what left the church was the
[1:12:28] signs the Wonders the healings the
[1:12:30] discernment the Judgment the
[1:12:33] correction they lost everything they
[1:12:35] lost every Power of the holy spirit
[1:12:38] because they took power to themselves
[1:12:39] and in doing so they took away the power
[1:12:40] of the word of God because they had
[1:12:42] added to it watch what Paul says here in
[1:12:44] Galatians 1 he says I Marvel that ye are
[1:12:48] so soon removed from him that called you
[1:12:51] under the grace of God unto another
[1:12:54] gospel now I want you to catch what he
[1:12:56] how he describes this he says which is
[1:12:58] not
[1:12:59] another he says but there be some that
[1:13:02] trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[1:13:06] of Christ amen notice they don't start
[1:13:08] with their own Gospel they start with
[1:13:10] the Gospel of Jesus Christ the one that
[1:13:12] was given Satan's a perverter not a
[1:13:15] Creator and so he takes what God has
[1:13:17] done and under his influence what did
[1:13:20] they do they see they sought to undo the
[1:13:22] power of the word by taking power to
[1:13:24] themselves
[1:13:25] how did they do it they changed the
[1:13:28] gospel they perverted it
[1:13:31] amen it says but though we are an angel
[1:13:34] from heaven Paul says I'm not even
[1:13:36] allowed to change this but though we are
[1:13:38] an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:13:40] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:13:41] preached unto you let him be a cursed
[1:13:45] listen Society changes the world
[1:13:47] expectations change pressures change
[1:13:50] Paul says I don't care how this world
[1:13:52] changes we do not change the word does
[1:13:55] doesn't change and if we stay with the
[1:13:56] word we will hold fast no matter
[1:13:59] what he says as we said before so say I
[1:14:02] now again if any man preach any other
[1:14:06] gospel unto you than that ye have
[1:14:07] received let him be a
[1:14:12] cursed God forbid we change this
[1:14:16] word but when you know when we change at
[1:14:18] church is when we don't have what it
[1:14:21] says that's honesty is when we look at
[1:14:24] the word and we say I don't have it and
[1:14:26] the tendency is to say well that means
[1:14:28] it's not there it doesn't mean that it's
[1:14:30] not for today like they're doing with
[1:14:32] this cessation gospel it was only for
[1:14:34] the days of the Apostles no like I said
[1:14:36] last service everything in this Bible is
[1:14:39] available for you every experience every
[1:14:43] gift every manifestation every reality
[1:14:45] of the word of God is available to us
[1:14:48] because we're in an age of full
[1:14:51] restoration it wasn't available in every
[1:14:53] other age it was available in the first
[1:14:54] age and it was available in the last age
[1:14:57] I am Alpha and I am Omega I am not the
[1:15:00] middle but at the first and the last
[1:15:02] there's a perfect manifestation of the
[1:15:04] word of God in the body of Believers so
[1:15:06] he says let him be a curse because what
[1:15:08] it holds people back from the realities
[1:15:10] of the god that we serve he says for do
[1:15:13] I now persuade men or God or do I seek
[1:15:16] to please men if I for if I yet please
[1:15:18] men I should not be the servant of
[1:15:20] Christ see we can't be preachers
[1:15:22] preaching what you want to hear we've
[1:15:24] got to preach what the word says and
[1:15:26] it'll draw the men and the women that
[1:15:28] are children of God and everyone else
[1:15:29] will separate and it'll hurt and we
[1:15:31] won't like it but that's just the way it
[1:15:33] is he says but I certify you Brethren
[1:15:36] that the gospel which was preached of me
[1:15:39] is not after man for I neither received
[1:15:41] it of man neither was I taught it but by
[1:15:44] the revelation of Jesus Christ and paulw
[1:15:47] he would talk about as soon as he's he's
[1:15:49] baptized and receives the Holy Ghost God
[1:15:51] would take him out into the desert and
[1:15:53] open the word to him and he would take
[1:15:56] it from Genesis all the way through the
[1:15:58] Books of Moses and through the prophets
[1:16:00] amen and he would open it up to him and
[1:16:03] he would give Paul the revelation of
[1:16:05] Jesus Christ all through scriptures and
[1:16:09] in that revelation of Jesus Christ he
[1:16:10] would point to us as well within him so
[1:16:13] he would show us where Christ was in the
[1:16:14] Old Testament and then he would show
[1:16:16] where we were in the Old Testament as
[1:16:17] well why because Paul was the voice of
[1:16:20] the Holy Spirit to his age Paul was the
[1:16:23] voice speaking amen it wasn't Paul's
[1:16:25] Doctrine it was the holy spirit's
[1:16:28] Doctrine it was the voice of the Holy
[1:16:30] Spirit to that age amen and if we take
[1:16:33] one word away what do we lose we lose
[1:16:35] the full revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:16:38] we lose a part because we can't be there
[1:16:41] unless we're the full
[1:16:42] Revelation it takes away our part out of
[1:16:44] the book of life it was only Paul that
[1:16:47] preached the fullness of the Gospel
[1:16:49] Peter didn't preach it James didn't
[1:16:51] preach it Paul was the only one that
[1:16:54] preached the fullness of the Gospel that
[1:16:56] brought it I should say he took us all
[1:16:58] the way back Peter had no idea of these
[1:17:01] things Peter had no idea about it
[1:17:04] remember he would say and brother Paul
[1:17:06] he preaches these things that are hard
[1:17:08] to understand as in all of his letters
[1:17:11] Peter's looking at what Paul says he's
[1:17:12] like
[1:17:13] whoa this is hard to understand it
[1:17:15] amazes me the Catholics pick Peter as
[1:17:17] the pope when Paul has had preaching
[1:17:19] that Paul that Peter never had and Paul
[1:17:21] had to correct Peter uh Peter for his
[1:17:23] actions even
[1:17:25] but who was it it was the Holy Spirit
[1:17:27] guiding the church into all truth and
[1:17:31] what I mean church I mean the body of
[1:17:33] Believers not the nominal church not the
[1:17:35] professing church but the real church
[1:17:37] amen it was guided into all Truth by who
[1:17:40] the gospels of Paul but it wasn't Paul
[1:17:43] speaking it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:17:45] Paul wrote as he heard Paul gave as he
[1:17:49] received and so we're hearing the Holy
[1:17:52] Spirit speaking not Paul and today we do
[1:17:54] we know that because I preach from
[1:17:56] Paul's words as if it is God not because
[1:17:59] it's as if it is God it's because it is
[1:18:01] God I do not look to Paul I do not look
[1:18:05] to Paul and so when we had a Prophet
[1:18:06] come in this age and he says I preach
[1:18:08] Paul's message that's why I receive it
[1:18:11] because if he brought any other message
[1:18:13] he would be a cursed that's right that's
[1:18:15] right amen that's why we believe it we
[1:18:18] look at Paul's gospels as the literal
[1:18:21] revelation of Jesus Christ to the bride
[1:18:24] amen we preach it as if God said it
[1:18:26] because God did say it it was him
[1:18:29] speaking to Paul and Paul took it and
[1:18:31] brought it to the church now let's go
[1:18:34] back to Acts 2 where we started last
[1:18:35] service to talk about this evidence of
[1:18:38] the holy spirit because too many people
[1:18:39] today are preaching that it's speaking
[1:18:41] in tongues and listen I have no problem
[1:18:44] if you claim that speaking in tongues is
[1:18:45] the evidence of the Holy Spirit if you
[1:18:47] preach it by the
[1:18:48] scriptures which means there is an
[1:18:50] Evidence of the Holy Spirit by tongues
[1:18:53] but you see they don't have it watch
[1:18:55] this it says ' and they were all filled
[1:18:57] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:19:00] with other
[1:19:02] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:19:04] utterance notice other tongues they
[1:19:06] began to speak with other languages not
[1:19:09] unknown languages other
[1:19:12] languages and it says as the spirit gave
[1:19:14] them utterance so they did not start it
[1:19:17] the Holy Spirit moved on them to speak
[1:19:20] in a completely different language that
[1:19:22] they didn't know okay
[1:19:25] they couldn't start it they couldn't
[1:19:27] stop it it was the Holy Spirit using
[1:19:29] their tongues amen if we don't believe
[1:19:31] it then let's let Ser uh scripture
[1:19:33] interpret scripture okay let's go
[1:19:35] through this line by line it says and
[1:19:37] there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[1:19:39] devout men out of every nation under
[1:19:41] heaven now when this was noised abroad
[1:19:44] the multitude came together and they
[1:19:46] were confounded because that every man
[1:19:49] every man heard them who those that were
[1:19:52] speaking in other tongues speak in his
[1:19:55] own language so those 120 people coming
[1:19:58] down from from The Upper Room are
[1:20:01] speaking known languages but languages
[1:20:04] they hadn't been taught to speak every
[1:20:07] person in the crowd there hears the
[1:20:09] language that they know it's not unknown
[1:20:12] tongues it's not gibberish it's not
[1:20:15] chaos there is total understanding of
[1:20:18] what they're saying okay it's not
[1:20:21] unknown tongues it's understandable
[1:20:23] languages and they were all amazed and
[1:20:25] marveled saying one to another behold
[1:20:27] are not all these which speak galileans
[1:20:30] in other words galileans don't know all
[1:20:31] of our languages how are we able to
[1:20:33] understand them how are they speaking
[1:20:35] this he says and how hear we every man
[1:20:37] in our own tongue wherein we were born
[1:20:40] parthians Andes and elamites and the
[1:20:42] Dwellers of Mesopotamia Judea capadia
[1:20:44] pontis Asia friia pamilia Egypt parts of
[1:20:48] Libya rout sirene strangers of Rome Jews
[1:20:51] Jews and prelates cits and Arabians we
[1:20:53] do hear them speak in our tongues the
[1:20:55] wonderful works of God so people from
[1:20:57] all over the world are gathered in
[1:20:59] Jerusalem for this Feast amen and every
[1:21:03] single one could hear and understand
[1:21:05] what the 120 people were saying in their
[1:21:08] native
[1:21:09] language you want an Evidence of the
[1:21:11] Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there it
[1:21:13] is because only God can do that and
[1:21:15] we'll see why that is okay so this is a
[1:21:19] miracle now on the
[1:21:21] speaker this is the miracle touching
[1:21:23] those that are filled with the spirit
[1:21:25] that as they speak they're speaking in
[1:21:28] another language
[1:21:30] okay so tell if you want to preach Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost evidence in tongues then that's
[1:21:34] the evidence it'll teach you to it'll
[1:21:36] give you the ability to speak a language
[1:21:38] you've never been
[1:21:40] taught I don't believe that's the
[1:21:42] evidence but if you want to say tongues
[1:21:44] is it then let's do it the way the
[1:21:45] scripture
[1:21:46] says but remember Jesus said they were
[1:21:50] going to do
[1:21:51] this he said and these signs shall
[1:21:53] follow them that believe in my name
[1:21:55] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[1:21:57] speak with new
[1:22:00] tongues new languages not unknown
[1:22:03] languages new languages things they'd
[1:22:06] never spoken
[1:22:08] before why Church why is he doing this
[1:22:11] because the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:13] is receiving the word he's setting them
[1:22:17] up so that people can receive the word
[1:22:21] he's not pointing to them he's pointing
[1:22:22] to the ones that are hearing the word
[1:22:24] and saying you need this so that you can
[1:22:26] receive the word and so he's creating a
[1:22:28] supernatural
[1:22:30] Miracle to make it so that there is no
[1:22:32] barrier to them hearing the
[1:22:34] word church this ought to teach us
[1:22:36] something our culture our language our
[1:22:40] birth family our heritage our tradition
[1:22:43] our DNA will not stop a child of God
[1:22:45] from hearing the word of God he'll get
[1:22:46] it to you one way or another listen if
[1:22:49] you can't speak the language he'll bring
[1:22:51] somebody that'll speak the language one
[1:22:53] way or the other whether it's through
[1:22:54] the Spirit or whether it's through
[1:22:55] somebody that speaks it naturally
[1:22:59] amen God takes care of his own yeah I
[1:23:01] think of of Blanca's father crossing the
[1:23:04] border of the US illegally and he finds
[1:23:07] a tract in the middle of nowhere church
[1:23:10] God will find you God will find his
[1:23:13] children Jesus said I will not lose a
[1:23:15] one I'll not lose a one they're they're
[1:23:17] engraved in the palms of my hand I can't
[1:23:18] lose them they're a part of me God will
[1:23:21] break down every barrier he'll Bridge
[1:23:22] every Gap he'll knock down every he'll
[1:23:24] open any door that's required to bring
[1:23:26] the word to his
[1:23:27] child but watch cuz that's just the 120
[1:23:31] every one of them speaking and as they
[1:23:32] come up to somebody they speak their
[1:23:35] language what an Outreach tool what an
[1:23:38] Outreach tool can you
[1:23:39] imagine I'd feel like brother Vel
[1:23:41] speaking seven
[1:23:44] languages 15 different groups I think it
[1:23:46] was that are that are encountered here
[1:23:48] and as they come up to a person they can
[1:23:50] start testifying of what God's doing the
[1:23:52] word is a reality remember what Joel
[1:23:54] said this is it look at me I'll tell you
[1:23:57] what I used to be I'll tell you what I
[1:23:59] am and they could testify
[1:24:02] effectively but what happens now cuz
[1:24:05] they all shut up and one person starts
[1:24:06] to talk one person starts to speak and
[1:24:09] we know it's Peter Peter starts to talk
[1:24:11] and when Peter speaks he's not speaking
[1:24:13] in tongues Church he's speaking his
[1:24:15] native language he's speaking
[1:24:19] Aramaic but as he speaks the speech is
[1:24:23] translated in real time into the ears of
[1:24:25] the of the
[1:24:28] listener as he speaks he doesn't need to
[1:24:30] wait for 15 translations to roll through
[1:24:32] the crowd have you ever seen those
[1:24:35] overseas meetings where they've got
[1:24:36] three or four different languages
[1:24:37] represented there the preacher speaks
[1:24:39] and then and they go down the line and
[1:24:41] then he speaks and then another three
[1:24:42] guys do it or four guys do it and it
[1:24:44] it's say push and pull push and pull
[1:24:46] Peter doesn't have to do it as Peter
[1:24:47] speaks the holy spirit is there to
[1:24:50] translate his words into the ears of the
[1:24:52] hearer so that they understand perfectly
[1:24:54] what he's saying amen every person in
[1:24:57] the crowd understands
[1:24:59] him so I want you to catch this now so
[1:25:02] the miracle now is no longer in the
[1:25:05] speaker the miracle is in the
[1:25:07] hearer the miracle is in the hearer
[1:25:10] Peter's speaking as he always speaks but
[1:25:13] God's doing a work and he's taking what
[1:25:16] Peter says and he's translating it into
[1:25:18] the ears of the hearers amen the miracle
[1:25:20] was happening on the receiving end not
[1:25:22] on the giving end Peter had no idea what
[1:25:25] he was
[1:25:26] saying but he saw that they understood
[1:25:30] amen what is it God was being personal
[1:25:33] to every person in that
[1:25:35] group I'll meet you where you are and
[1:25:38] I'll lay it in your lap with the word
[1:25:41] amen what's it showing church it's
[1:25:44] showing the holy spirit's the one that
[1:25:45] sets us free it's not Peter's preaching
[1:25:47] that set him free it's not my preaching
[1:25:50] is going to set you free it's the Holy
[1:25:51] Spirit that'll take that word and
[1:25:53] interpret it into into your life and
[1:25:55] make it personal and direct and I know
[1:25:57] we've all been there amen where the
[1:25:58] preacher is preaching and it's like
[1:26:00] there's a a million
[1:26:02] watt Spotlight on your life and it's God
[1:26:05] getting personal with you with the
[1:26:09] word what's it showing you're a child of
[1:26:12] God you're a child of God and he's
[1:26:15] breaking down barriers so that you know
[1:26:16] I've said it many times when I when I
[1:26:18] gave my heart to the Lord the services
[1:26:20] leading up to that that I that the
[1:26:22] discernment that that came over that
[1:26:24] that told me what I was going to do or
[1:26:26] what I wanted to do what I thought I was
[1:26:27] going to do and then it said but you're
[1:26:29] not going to do it cuz you're a child of
[1:26:30] mine it was personal to me and that's
[1:26:33] all I heard of those
[1:26:34] services but I heard the part that was
[1:26:36] for me and it brought me to God because
[1:26:39] I was a child of God Amen see what
[1:26:41] happened at Babel remember is God
[1:26:43] confused their tongues remember they
[1:26:46] what did they do they turned to their
[1:26:48] own
[1:26:49] religion they turned to their own ideas
[1:26:52] they created a false unity and so God
[1:26:54] came down he says I'm not going to allow
[1:26:55] it and he confused their
[1:26:58] tongues he gave them languages and so
[1:27:01] they couldn't understand so this group
[1:27:02] went with that one and that one because
[1:27:04] they understood each other but now under
[1:27:06] True Religion under the revelation of
[1:27:08] the Gospel of Jesus Christ God is
[1:27:11] unwinding the curse of
[1:27:13] Babel as a Vindication of the truth of
[1:27:16] the message that they're
[1:27:17] hearing it's literally God undoing what
[1:27:20] he did at Babel what's he saying he's
[1:27:22] saying listen you've been raised to a
[1:27:23] certain way you've been taught a certain
[1:27:25] way you go to a certain church you've
[1:27:26] been in a certain family but that
[1:27:28] doesn't matter the Holy Spirit Will
[1:27:30] unwind Every curse that's held you back
[1:27:32] and Set You Free by the revelation of
[1:27:34] Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ what's god making abundantly
[1:27:37] clear here Church the evidence is not in
[1:27:40] the speaking it's in the hearing it's in
[1:27:42] the hearing amen the greatest Miracle
[1:27:45] there is that God is allowing people to
[1:27:47] hear a language that's not even being
[1:27:48] spoken why because you've got to be able
[1:27:50] to hear the word to receive the word and
[1:27:53] that'll lead you to receive in the
[1:27:54] spirit
[1:27:56] amen he made the word a reality that day
[1:27:59] listen he makes the word effective he
[1:28:02] makes you effective he'll take our
[1:28:04] simple words our simple ideas our simple
[1:28:07] lives our simple thoughts by the word
[1:28:09] and he'll magnify that so that other
[1:28:11] people can see Christ so they can see a
[1:28:13] reality that they themselves do not have
[1:28:16] I've said this before I don't say it to
[1:28:17] magnify myself you know my heart when I
[1:28:20] was in Texas I was working with another
[1:28:22] engineer there we're both same age
[1:28:24] roughly and he was a professing
[1:28:26] Christian and he only stayed about a
[1:28:29] year and then he left but before he left
[1:28:30] he wrote me an email and he said I
[1:28:31] thought I was a Christian until I met
[1:28:33] you he says and then I realized there's
[1:28:36] more to Christianity than what I have
[1:28:38] that's about the greatest compliment I
[1:28:40] could ever get but that ought to be our
[1:28:42] testimony that ought to be our witness
[1:28:44] is that there's more to this than just
[1:28:46] going to
[1:28:47] church there's more to this than just
[1:28:50] dressing a certain way there's more than
[1:28:52] than just identifying with the
[1:28:54] particular message or idea but it's a
[1:28:56] life it's a changed life it's a life of
[1:28:59] surrender it's a life of dying out but
[1:29:01] in that there is power by the holy
[1:29:03] spirit for God to produce himself in US
[1:29:05] amen now watch watch the effect of the
[1:29:08] Holy Spirit we say the holy spirit's
[1:29:09] working in us let's see what it does it
[1:29:11] says now when they heard this they were
[1:29:13] pricked in their heart and said unto
[1:29:14] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[1:29:16] men and Brethren what shall we do what
[1:29:18] the word is effective then Peter said
[1:29:21] unto them repent and be baptized every
[1:29:23] one of you the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:29:25] the remission of sins and you shall
[1:29:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:29:29] a simple formula and it still works
[1:29:31] today Church repent turn your life
[1:29:34] around start walking the other way in
[1:29:37] sincerity be baptized in the name of the
[1:29:39] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:29:41] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:29:43] the Holy Ghost he says for the promise
[1:29:45] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:29:47] all that are a far off even as many as
[1:29:50] the Lord Our God shall call it's not
[1:29:51] limited to the day of the Apostles it's
[1:29:53] not limited to that church it's not
[1:29:54] limited to that time it's not limited to
[1:29:56] those people it's for whosoever God will
[1:29:59] call whosoever God will call it says and
[1:30:02] with many other words did he testify and
[1:30:04] exhort saying save yourselves from this
[1:30:07] UNT Generation Now Watch What Happens
[1:30:09] and they that gladly received
[1:30:13] what his
[1:30:15] word they that received his word were
[1:30:18] baptized and the same day there were
[1:30:20] added unto them about 3,000
[1:30:22] Souls and they continued steadfastly in
[1:30:26] the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and
[1:30:29] in Breaking of bread and in prayers now
[1:30:31] you notice one thing here it says they
[1:30:33] were added 3,000 Souls you can't add a
[1:30:36] soul unless it's
[1:30:38] sealed and it can't be sealed except by
[1:30:40] the Holy Spirit but there's not a word
[1:30:42] here about those 3,000 speaking in
[1:30:45] tongues why the work had been
[1:30:48] done it wasn't needed anymore for them
[1:30:51] right then and there but what they did
[1:30:54] do was they continued in the word they
[1:30:56] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[1:30:58] Doctrine amen they stayed with the word
[1:31:01] of God they continue with the word of
[1:31:02] God they were in fellowship with the
[1:31:03] Saints why because that's what Christ
[1:31:05] said the Holy Spirit would do it would
[1:31:07] lead you into all truth and so they
[1:31:10] continued in truth as it was revealed
[1:31:12] unto them amen so we see that this event
[1:31:15] is not repeated time and time again
[1:31:17] sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't
[1:31:19] and there's a reason for that we look at
[1:31:21] acts chap 10 in the house of Cornelius
[1:31:23] we've read this before says while Peter
[1:31:25] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:31:27] fell on them which heard the word so
[1:31:28] what's the requirement of receiving the
[1:31:30] Holy Spirit receive the word you respond
[1:31:33] to the word let it change your heart
[1:31:34] don't try and change your life don't try
[1:31:37] and change anything receive the thing
[1:31:39] that'll change you and let it do the
[1:31:41] work when the Holy Spirit comes in amen
[1:31:43] open your heart and the word will change
[1:31:44] you by the power of the Holy Spirit but
[1:31:47] while he yet spake I was reading and
[1:31:49] brother Bram says why did God do it this
[1:31:50] way than than other than how he did it
[1:31:52] at Pentecost where they had to wait and
[1:31:54] be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost he
[1:31:56] says that's the apostolic way God can do
[1:31:58] it any way he wants
[1:32:01] Hallelujah church God can do it any way
[1:32:04] any time anywhere if you will receive
[1:32:07] the word God can do the work he can do
[1:32:10] it right then and right there you don't
[1:32:11] have to wait you don't have to t you
[1:32:13] don't have to be in church you don't
[1:32:14] have to be under a preacher in the
[1:32:17] moment but it'll take you there it'll
[1:32:20] take you into Fellowship it'll take you
[1:32:21] to a body of Believers it'll take you to
[1:32:23] living by the word but if you are under
[1:32:26] the hearing of the word and you receive
[1:32:28] it in any way the Holy Spirit can hit
[1:32:30] you right then and there and seal your
[1:32:31] soul to the day of your Redemption the
[1:32:33] changing of your
[1:32:35] body he says and they of the
[1:32:37] circumcision which believe were
[1:32:38] astonished as many as came with Peter
[1:32:40] because it on the Gentiles also was
[1:32:42] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:44] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:32:46] and magnify God then answered Peter can
[1:32:48] any man forbid water that these should
[1:32:50] not be baptized which have received the
[1:32:52] Holy Ghost as well as we he says in
[1:32:54] other words they've received the Holy
[1:32:55] Ghost the same way we did which is what
[1:32:58] speaking in a known
[1:33:01] language so why does it happen here
[1:33:04] there's three different nationalities in
[1:33:06] this house speaking three different
[1:33:09] languages the holy spirit's coming down
[1:33:11] to give Unity of the word so that's what
[1:33:14] he does there amen they spoke in new
[1:33:17] languages not in unknown languages they
[1:33:19] spoke in known but new to them and he
[1:33:21] commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:33:23] name of the Lord then prayed they him to
[1:33:25] T certain
[1:33:27] days but then acts in Acts 19 Paul would
[1:33:30] go to Ephesus he goes through Corinth he
[1:33:33] comes to Ephesus and there when they
[1:33:35] received the Holy Ghost they did two
[1:33:36] things they spoke in tongues and they
[1:33:39] prophesied so on the day of Pentecost
[1:33:41] they spoke in new languages here they
[1:33:45] spoke in new languages but had this Holy
[1:33:47] Ghost before they were baptized now he
[1:33:49] goes over to Ephesus where they were
[1:33:50] under John's baptism he baptizes them
[1:33:53] lay hands on and then they speak in
[1:33:54] tongues and prophesy so is that now the
[1:33:57] evidence of the Holy Spirit speaking in
[1:33:59] tongues and prophesying CU they did it
[1:34:01] we can't deny they did it but they
[1:34:03] didn't do it at
[1:34:05] Pentecost so we've got to pull
[1:34:07] everything from the word we've got to
[1:34:08] take it in continuity through the word
[1:34:10] see what's common there and see what's
[1:34:12] not but then Paul would go Peter would
[1:34:14] go down to Samaria in Acts 8 and now the
[1:34:17] Samaritans pre they speak the same
[1:34:19] language as the Jews it's Aramaic and so
[1:34:21] there he lays hands on them they receive
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost no tongu
[1:34:24] why they don't need it they're all
[1:34:25] speaking the same
[1:34:27] language see what happens here is we've
[1:34:29] got this m misconception people have
[1:34:31] this misconception of what happened on
[1:34:33] the day of Pentecost versus what the
[1:34:35] gift of tongues is it's not the same
[1:34:38] thing amen Paul had to put it in order
[1:34:41] with Corinthians and we're going to read
[1:34:43] the entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 14
[1:34:45] just to to lay this aside you say
[1:34:47] brother John why are you preaching on
[1:34:48] this we don't deal with this in this
[1:34:49] church well I don't know if we do or not
[1:34:52] I don't know what every body thinks or
[1:34:54] believes about this but I'll tell you
[1:34:56] this we've got to have an answer for why
[1:34:58] we believe how we believe Selena was
[1:35:00] testifying to some Pentecostal sisters
[1:35:02] yesterday and sharing how we don't
[1:35:04] believe that tongues is the evidence of
[1:35:05] the Holy Spirit she's got to know where
[1:35:07] she stands if we're going to witness we
[1:35:09] got to have it by the word not by what
[1:35:11] brother John says we've got to be able
[1:35:13] to take them to the
[1:35:14] word Paul says this follow after charity
[1:35:20] and desire spiritual gifts but rather
[1:35:22] that you may prophesy
[1:35:24] so what does it mean to prophesy Church
[1:35:26] prophesy means to have the word of the
[1:35:28] Lord thus saith the Lord that's what it
[1:35:30] means he says for he that speaketh in an
[1:35:33] unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but
[1:35:35] unto God for no man understands him how
[1:35:38] be it in the spirit he speaks Mysteries
[1:35:41] and he that prophesieth speaketh unto
[1:35:43] men to edification and exhortation and
[1:35:45] comfort so Paul's contrasting
[1:35:47] prophesying with speaking in tongues and
[1:35:49] he says prophesying is far greater he
[1:35:52] that speaks in an unknown tongue
[1:35:53] edifieth who
[1:35:56] himself but he that prophesieth edifieth
[1:35:59] the church so speaking in tongues isn't
[1:36:01] for others it's for yourself unless
[1:36:03] there's an interpreter
[1:36:04] present it's helping you in some way but
[1:36:07] it's not helping anybody else he says I
[1:36:11] would that yall spoke with tongues and
[1:36:12] everybody says
[1:36:14] amen he says but rather that you
[1:36:16] prophesied so he says yes I would love
[1:36:18] for you all to speak with tongues but
[1:36:20] more than that greater than that I want
[1:36:22] you to prophesy
[1:36:24] he says for greater is he that
[1:36:26] prophesieth than he that speak with
[1:36:28] tongues except the interpret that the
[1:36:30] church may receive edifying so if you
[1:36:32] speak with tongues and there's an
[1:36:33] interpreter well that's thus sayeth the
[1:36:37] Lord it may be I should clarify that
[1:36:40] because you could say something of
[1:36:41] yourself and somebody else could as well
[1:36:43] but it's supposed to be thus sayith the
[1:36:45] Lord the purpose of the gift is to bring
[1:36:46] a word from God so he says if you speak
[1:36:48] in tongues and don't interpret it does
[1:36:50] nobody any good but if you prophesy it
[1:36:52] helps everybody in the church he says
[1:36:55] now Brethren if I come unto you speaking
[1:36:57] with tongues what shall I profit you
[1:36:59] except I shall speak to you either by
[1:37:01] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[1:37:03] prophesying or by Doctrine so let let me
[1:37:05] say it this way Paul's saying if I come
[1:37:08] to the pulpit and all I do is speak in
[1:37:10] tongues what good does it do
[1:37:12] you absolutely none it has no purpose it
[1:37:16] has no benefit he says but if I come in
[1:37:18] tongues okay that's great but if I come
[1:37:21] with Revelation and knowledge and
[1:37:22] prophesy and Doctrine that's when I'm
[1:37:24] really going to help you amen tongues
[1:37:26] aren't helping anybody they are not a
[1:37:28] significant element in the church he
[1:37:31] says but and even things without
[1:37:33] lifegiving sound whether pipe or harp
[1:37:35] except they give a distinction in the
[1:37:36] sounds how shall it be known what is
[1:37:38] piped or heart so so sound is meant to
[1:37:41] have purpose and Clarity it's supposed
[1:37:42] to have intention he says for if the
[1:37:44] trumpet gives an uncertain sound who
[1:37:46] shall prepare himself to the battle so
[1:37:48] in the old days they would use trumpets
[1:37:50] to give commands to the armies and based
[1:37:52] on how they heard the trumpet they would
[1:37:54] they would perform a certain maneuver or
[1:37:55] go a certain way or do something and if
[1:37:58] the sound wasn't clear from the trumpet
[1:38:00] then they couldn't know what they were
[1:38:01] supposed to do and it would cause
[1:38:03] confusion on the battlefield and they
[1:38:05] couldn't move together in unity he says
[1:38:07] so likewise except ye utter by the
[1:38:09] Tongue words easy to be understood how
[1:38:12] shall it be known what is spoken for
[1:38:14] your speak you shall speak into the air
[1:38:15] it's wasted words if nobody understands
[1:38:17] you he says there are it may be so many
[1:38:20] kinds of voices in the world and none of
[1:38:22] them is without signification every
[1:38:24] voice every sound has a meaning it has a
[1:38:26] purpose therefore he says if I know not
[1:38:28] the meaning of the voice I shall be unto
[1:38:30] him that speaketh a barbarian and he
[1:38:32] that speaketh shall be a barbarian to me
[1:38:34] so if I go down to Africa and I preach a
[1:38:37] sermon in English to an African tribe
[1:38:38] that doesn't speak English what good am
[1:38:40] I doing them
[1:38:42] none absolutely none what I'm saying may
[1:38:45] be good in and of itself but if they
[1:38:47] don't understand it it does them no good
[1:38:49] whatsoever
[1:38:50] okay so the words would be useless or
[1:38:53] wasted he says even so ye for as much as
[1:38:57] ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek
[1:39:00] that ye may excel for what purpose to
[1:39:03] the edifying of the church okay every
[1:39:07] person in here has a gift whether you
[1:39:09] know it or not and the purpose of the
[1:39:13] gift is to help the other believers it
[1:39:16] is not to help myself it is not to help
[1:39:19] yourself you may benefit from it but its
[1:39:21] purpose is to edify to help grow mature
[1:39:24] strengthen and encourage take care of
[1:39:27] the local body and the global body in
[1:39:29] some cases whatever is
[1:39:31] needed he says wherefore let him that
[1:39:33] speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
[1:39:36] he may interpret now remember on the day
[1:39:38] of Pentecost they didn't need an
[1:39:39] interpreter the Holy Ghost was The
[1:39:41] Interpreter and it happened in real time
[1:39:44] this gift of tongues requires an
[1:39:46] interpreter another person so it's not
[1:39:49] the same gift they had on the day of
[1:39:50] Pentecost on the day of Pentecost they
[1:39:52] didn't have an interpreter the Holy
[1:39:54] Ghost was doing it in real time he says
[1:39:56] for if I pray in an unknown tongue my
[1:39:58] spirit prayeth but my understanding is
[1:40:00] unfruitful so he's saying even when I
[1:40:02] pray in tongues I don't even know what
[1:40:04] I'm saying there's a groaning there's an
[1:40:06] unction from the Holy Spirit there's an
[1:40:07] expression of the spirit but I don't
[1:40:09] even understand it I just know that I'm
[1:40:11] doing it and there's something in me
[1:40:12] that's causing
[1:40:14] it he says but if I don't if I don't get
[1:40:16] an interpretation it doesn't help me he
[1:40:19] says what is it then I will pray with
[1:40:21] the spirit and I will pray with the
[1:40:24] understanding also I will sing with the
[1:40:26] spirit and I will sing with the
[1:40:27] understanding also in other words I need
[1:40:29] to get to a place where there's
[1:40:31] understanding involved in my prayer and
[1:40:32] worship not just an expression of the
[1:40:34] spirit that's wonderful it's it's a
[1:40:36] wonderful feeling it's a wonderful
[1:40:38] moment but he says I need understanding
[1:40:40] in the end of all of this else when thou
[1:40:42] shalt bless with the spirit how shall he
[1:40:45] that occupy the room of the unlearned
[1:40:46] say Amen at thy giving of thanks seeing
[1:40:49] he understandeth not what thou sayest so
[1:40:51] if we speak in tongues if we pray in
[1:40:52] tongues how can people say amen if they
[1:40:54] don't understand it I've been in
[1:40:57] churches where they would have somebody
[1:40:58] that spoke another language pray you
[1:41:00] know what I can't say Amen to the prayer
[1:41:03] cuz I don't know what they
[1:41:05] said we trust that what they're saying
[1:41:07] is good but to say Amen means to be so
[1:41:10] be it you're accepting it as the word
[1:41:13] you're accepting it as truth and he's
[1:41:14] saying how can somebody say Amen if they
[1:41:16] don't know what you're talking
[1:41:18] about they can't so they're excluded
[1:41:21] from the blessing and in fact they
[1:41:22] withdraw from it because they're not
[1:41:24] partakers of it he says for thou verily
[1:41:27] givest thanks but the other is not
[1:41:30] edified he's saying what you're doing is
[1:41:32] not wrong but it's not helping
[1:41:34] anybody I thank my God I speak with
[1:41:36] tongues more than you all so we are not
[1:41:38] against tongues by any means Paul did it
[1:41:41] more than anyone he says but watch this
[1:41:43] next
[1:41:44] verse he says yet in the church I had
[1:41:48] rather speak five words I would rather
[1:41:51] would be the way we'd say it today but
[1:41:53] yet in the church I would rather speak
[1:41:55] five words with my understanding that by
[1:41:58] my voice I might teach others also than
[1:42:00] 10,000 words in an unknown tongue where
[1:42:04] is the
[1:42:05] preeminence where's the priority in the
[1:42:07] Church of God church it's on the word of
[1:42:09] God with
[1:42:12] understanding he says Brethren be not
[1:42:15] children in understanding how be it in
[1:42:17] Malice be ye children but in
[1:42:19] understanding be men see what
[1:42:21] happens what do kids kids what do we do
[1:42:24] we like that which we like and we don't
[1:42:27] go to the things we don't like but as we
[1:42:29] mature and as we grow we realize the
[1:42:31] necessity of doing and eating things
[1:42:33] that we don't like to do anybody here
[1:42:35] want to get up every single morning 5
[1:42:37] days a week for the rest of their life
[1:42:39] until they retire and work I don't think
[1:42:41] any of us wants to do that but we do it
[1:42:43] because it's a necessity how many here
[1:42:46] eat
[1:42:49] broccoli why
[1:42:53] because it's good for you listen I'll
[1:42:55] occasionally eat a
[1:42:57] sprig just to say I did it but I don't
[1:43:01] like it and so I don't do it Paul's
[1:43:05] saying don't be not children in
[1:43:07] understanding in other words don't go
[1:43:09] towards the things you like about church
[1:43:12] and walk out with no growth in your
[1:43:13] spiritual understanding don't get caught
[1:43:16] up in the
[1:43:17] fun in the
[1:43:19] emotion in the in the atmosphere and
[1:43:23] walk away no stronger than you came in
[1:43:26] don't be like kids with this brother BR
[1:43:28] would say you've been children long
[1:43:30] enough playing with the gifts time to
[1:43:33] set them in order time to let God start
[1:43:35] using them amen he says in the law it is
[1:43:38] written but I like how he says how be it
[1:43:40] and Mal malice be you
[1:43:42] children
[1:43:44] listen I've seen it you see kids playing
[1:43:48] and some guy leans off and he punches
[1:43:50] the other one and 30 minutes later those
[1:43:53] two kids are back playing as if it never
[1:43:55] happened they cry maybe they get over it
[1:43:59] they come and complain and then they
[1:44:01] realize it's still more fun to play with
[1:44:03] them than be by myself and then they're
[1:44:05] back with them again he says in Malice
[1:44:06] let's be that way if you're going to be
[1:44:08] a child be a child about holding
[1:44:11] grudges he says in the law it is written
[1:44:14] with men of other tongues and other lips
[1:44:16] will I speak unto this people and yet
[1:44:18] for all that they do not hear me sayeth
[1:44:20] the Lord God prophesied he do it he did
[1:44:22] it he's still doing it today but without
[1:44:24] interpretation it serves no value okay
[1:44:27] he says wherefore tongues are for
[1:44:29] assigned not to them that believe but to
[1:44:30] them that believe not but prophesying
[1:44:33] serveth not for them that believe not
[1:44:34] but for them which believe he says if
[1:44:36] therefore the whole church come together
[1:44:38] into one place and all speak with
[1:44:40] tongues and there come in those that are
[1:44:41] unlearned or unbelievers will they not
[1:44:43] say that ye are mad so if somebody walks
[1:44:46] through those doors that is never uh
[1:44:48] heard of this of the gift of speaking in
[1:44:50] tongues has never heard it done never
[1:44:53] been taught about it you get a rank
[1:44:55] sinner knows nothing about God walks in
[1:44:57] off that street through these doors and
[1:44:59] everyone is here is speaking in tongues
[1:45:01] what are they going to do Church they're
[1:45:02] going to turn right around and they're
[1:45:04] going to walk right up cuz it means
[1:45:06] nothing to them in fact it makes us look
[1:45:08] crazy we don't change what we do based
[1:45:11] on how it
[1:45:12] looks okay that's not the reason we
[1:45:14] don't do it but he's saying you're not
[1:45:16] going to help that person by speaking in
[1:45:18] tongues in fact you're going to do the
[1:45:19] opposite you're going to push them right
[1:45:21] out the door because they'll have no
[1:45:22] clue what's going on they'll think you
[1:45:23] guys are
[1:45:24] crazy okay he says but if all prophesy
[1:45:29] and there com in one that believeth not
[1:45:31] or one unlearned he's convi convinced of
[1:45:33] all he's judged of all and thus are the
[1:45:35] secrets of his heart made manifest and
[1:45:37] so falling down on his face he will
[1:45:39] worship God and report that God is in
[1:45:41] you of a truth so in other words if
[1:45:42] there is prophecy going forth in the
[1:45:44] truth in in in the church and that that
[1:45:47] person's secrets are revealed his life
[1:45:49] where he's at what's going on whatever
[1:45:51] it might be if a prophecy Goes Forth and
[1:45:53] says uh sir in the back you you are here
[1:45:56] and you've been doing this and you've
[1:45:58] been doing that God tells you to stop it
[1:46:00] he's got a plan for you he wants you
[1:46:02] then he can say oh my goodness they
[1:46:04] don't know me I'm a stranger to this
[1:46:06] church and coming in here they knew who
[1:46:08] I was he's saying that's of God and that
[1:46:11] person will know that it's of God cuz
[1:46:13] they know that you don't know anything
[1:46:14] about them so that can happen under the
[1:46:17] a gift of
[1:46:19] Prophecy if we had an actual prophet in
[1:46:21] our midst then that would be it is well
[1:46:23] but it can also happen under the
[1:46:25] preaching of the word because remember
[1:46:27] the scripture says who is the discerner
[1:46:29] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:46:31] the word the word is the discerner of
[1:46:33] the thoughts and intents of the heart so
[1:46:35] if that person comes in and the Holy
[1:46:37] Spirit anoints that man to speak to them
[1:46:40] then it can go into their life and
[1:46:41] discern and that's when we get that
[1:46:42] Spotlight on ourselves and to an
[1:46:45] unbeliever or not a not I call him an
[1:46:47] unbeliever to a child of God that
[1:46:49] doesn't know they're a child of God that
[1:46:50] can feel very uncomfortable at first but
[1:46:52] there's a draw in them that responds to
[1:46:54] the light and it pulls them forward and
[1:46:56] they're able to receive the
[1:46:58] word he says now this is Paul now the
[1:47:01] Corinthian Church was the only one that
[1:47:02] needed this instruction everybody else
[1:47:04] had it in order as far as we know he
[1:47:06] says how is it then Brethren when you
[1:47:08] come together every one of
[1:47:10] you can you imagine we've got about 50
[1:47:13] people here this morning if every one of
[1:47:15] us has a PSAL has a has a special can
[1:47:18] you imagine the length of the service if
[1:47:20] we all had a
[1:47:21] special what would happen Church the
[1:47:25] word would never get preached everyone
[1:47:27] has a Doctrine everyone has a tongue
[1:47:30] everyone has a revelation everyone has
[1:47:32] an interpretation he says let all things
[1:47:35] be done unto
[1:47:37] edifying If any man speak in an unknown
[1:47:41] tongue he says Let It Be by two or at
[1:47:44] the most by three and that by course and
[1:47:47] let one interpret so Paul says in any
[1:47:50] given service if there's going to be a
[1:47:52] SP a speaking in tongues where the
[1:47:53] church will stop and listen he says it's
[1:47:56] at most two or three that's Paul's Rule
[1:48:00] and it says only by
[1:48:04] interpretation so brother visha was to
[1:48:07] stand up this morning go however that
[1:48:10] and there was no interpretation Paul
[1:48:11] says that doesn't happen in the church
[1:48:14] we will not listen to tongues without
[1:48:16] interpretation because it edifies nobody
[1:48:17] it's a waste of our time all it does is
[1:48:19] make that person look
[1:48:21] spiritual okay and he says we do it in
[1:48:24] course one after the other they're not
[1:48:26] fighting each other they're not speaking
[1:48:28] over each other it is the spirit moving
[1:48:30] sovereignly one in one in front of the
[1:48:33] other he says but if there be no
[1:48:35] interpreter let him keep silence in the
[1:48:38] church now that doesn't mean you can't
[1:48:39] speak in tongues in the church it means
[1:48:40] we're not going to stop the service to
[1:48:42] listen if we're praying if we're singing
[1:48:45] you do whatever you want to do you can
[1:48:47] do that at home you can do that in a
[1:48:49] small group whatever but in the church
[1:48:51] we will not stop the service to hear
[1:48:53] somebody speak in Tong unless there's an
[1:48:55] interpretation that's going to go with
[1:48:56] it so that means we need both in the
[1:48:59] church see you see in Pentecost what
[1:49:01] they're focused on is the speaking and
[1:49:02] nobody's focusing on the interpreting
[1:49:05] why because they're not speaking
[1:49:06] anything most of the
[1:49:08] time he says if there be no interpreter
[1:49:11] let him keep silence in the church and
[1:49:12] let him speak to himself and to God see
[1:49:16] remember what brother Bram says he said
[1:49:18] we do that before the
[1:49:20] service we do it before the service why
[1:49:23] we're going to check your motive do you
[1:49:24] want
[1:49:25] recognition or do you want to edify cuz
[1:49:28] if you want to edify you don't care if
[1:49:30] they know if you that you said it or you
[1:49:32] interpreted it you're there to help
[1:49:34] people not to receive it unto yourself
[1:49:37] okay it shows whether we're looking
[1:49:39] whether we've got a burden a message
[1:49:40] from God in our soul or if we're just
[1:49:42] looking for for other people to
[1:49:44] recognize us and then he says let the
[1:49:46] prophet speak two or three and let the
[1:49:47] other judge so Paul says I wish you all
[1:49:49] would prophesy but when it comes to
[1:49:51] putting it in order he says but still
[1:49:53] only two or
[1:49:54] three why the word is
[1:49:59] preeminent not gifts not interpretations
[1:50:02] and these
[1:50:04] things he says if anything be revealed
[1:50:07] to another that sth by let the first
[1:50:09] hold his peace so we don't
[1:50:11] jump we don't try and get in front of
[1:50:13] the other person we let them finish
[1:50:15] before we jump in he says for ye may all
[1:50:17] prophesy one by one that all may learn
[1:50:21] and all may be comforted and the spirits
[1:50:23] of the prophets are subjects to are
[1:50:26] subject to the prophets so we can hold
[1:50:28] ourselves if we've got that gift we can
[1:50:30] hold it in check until the other
[1:50:32] person's done he says if you can't
[1:50:34] there's a problem for God is what not
[1:50:38] the author of confusion but of Peace as
[1:50:42] in all churches of the Saints so this
[1:50:45] isn't about you using the gift it's
[1:50:47] about God using the gift when I start to
[1:50:50] use it what happens confusion
[1:50:54] chaos but if God uses it it'll bring
[1:50:57] peace in the church it'll be in order
[1:51:00] it'll be shared it'll be spread out
[1:51:02] amongst the body so we don't put God in
[1:51:05] a box but we do follow his word and Paul
[1:51:08] said let's keep these things in check
[1:51:10] let's focus on the on the reason we come
[1:51:12] here and yes we love to sing We Love to
[1:51:14] Worship I love those things but he says
[1:51:17] we're coming for the word of God and
[1:51:19] that's why we gather here amen
[1:51:21] everything else is a
[1:51:23] minor it is not a major it is a minor
[1:51:27] amen anytime we make a minor a major we
[1:51:31] lose the power of the word because we're
[1:51:34] focusing on the thing that lacks the
[1:51:36] power it's a manifestation it's a gift
[1:51:38] but it has no power in and of itself so
[1:51:40] what happens the reason why we've we've
[1:51:42] taken this whole circular route remember
[1:51:44] what Jesus said to the priest he says
[1:51:46] you bind people with the traditions of
[1:51:47] men and you take away the power when we
[1:51:49] preach a false evidence of the Holy
[1:51:51] Spirit we take away the power of the
[1:51:53] word of God cuz what happens is all
[1:51:55] people try to do is get to the place
[1:51:57] where they speak in tongues and they
[1:51:59] stop short of the fullness of the word
[1:52:00] of God that's it that's it see people
[1:52:03] seek the sign or the evidence they think
[1:52:06] rather than the person of Christ in
[1:52:08] their life that's really what we're
[1:52:09] looking for that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:52:11] is it's the person of Christ in my life
[1:52:14] so they're wanting this defined
[1:52:16] experience rather than a sovereign
[1:52:18] experience listen I know our
[1:52:20] testimonies was it Souls that are prison
[1:52:22] that you two listen to so B Bob and
[1:52:24] sister Brenda get saved under a a a hard
[1:52:28] message a soul seeking message Souls
[1:52:31] that are in
[1:52:32] prison I got saved while listening to
[1:52:35] brother Barry coffee and brother Donnie
[1:52:38] Reagan everybody has a different story
[1:52:40] the word came in a different way a
[1:52:42] different style a different Ministry
[1:52:44] whatever it might be many of us got
[1:52:46] saved by listening to brother
[1:52:48] Gerald but not everybody
[1:52:51] did and that does doesn't mean they're
[1:52:53] out and we're
[1:52:54] in or they're in and we're out amen we
[1:52:58] cannot Define how he comes but we what
[1:53:00] we can Define is what he does when he
[1:53:01] gets there when we are finally in and
[1:53:04] we've died out to self then that's the
[1:53:07] the the commonality that we have and
[1:53:08] it's that the word comes to life inside
[1:53:10] of us but the problem today is we've got
[1:53:12] a me too
[1:53:13] Christianity and if you don't live the
[1:53:15] way I live you don't talk the way I talk
[1:53:17] you don't have the same experience I
[1:53:18] experience then you're not in and that
[1:53:20] is not what the word says we can find
[1:53:23] different experiences of the Believers
[1:53:24] in the book of Acts just in the first 19
[1:53:27] chapters how they got the Holy Ghost
[1:53:29] where they got the Holy Ghost when it
[1:53:30] came before baptism after baptism before
[1:53:32] the preaching of the word they're in
[1:53:34] Samaria I think a month hearing the
[1:53:36] Gospel of Jesus Christ but they didn't
[1:53:37] receive the Holy Spirit till till Peter
[1:53:40] came everyone has a different experience
[1:53:43] amen but when we preach an Evidence of
[1:53:46] tongues we lower the standard to where
[1:53:49] it's a joke listen I've heard people
[1:53:51] speak in tongues literally I'm going to
[1:53:53] say this I'm not trying to be
[1:53:55] sacriligious and they said they were
[1:53:57] speaking in tongues this is a well-known
[1:53:59] woman preacher by the way that's not
[1:54:02] speaking in tongues give me a break just
[1:54:04] to call it out that's not speaking in
[1:54:06] tongues but people will sit there and
[1:54:08] think she's spiritual because she does
[1:54:09] it why they've lowered the standard to
[1:54:12] where anybody can do it all you have to
[1:54:14] do is go listen to a certain service
[1:54:15] where somebody speaks and copy it and
[1:54:17] they'll say you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:54:18] you won't because you'll know that
[1:54:20] you're just Faking It but listen you can
[1:54:23] get to the point where you believe your
[1:54:24] own
[1:54:25] fake absolutely true brother Chad that's
[1:54:27] right you can get to the point where you
[1:54:29] convince yourself and your conscience
[1:54:31] sin sear with a hot iron because you
[1:54:34] want to fit in so bad you won't take the
[1:54:35] word you'll take your fake experience
[1:54:39] instead my daughter was telling me that
[1:54:43] somebody told her yesterday when she was
[1:54:44] talking to these Pentecostal women late
[1:54:46] young ladies said I had to go speak in
[1:54:48] tongues again to make sure I still had
[1:54:50] the Holy Ghost what a shame
[1:54:53] what a shame one that she hasn't been
[1:54:55] taught that you are sealed to the day of
[1:54:57] your Redemption with the Holy Ghost once
[1:54:58] you got it you cannot lose
[1:55:00] it but two that she would go to such a
[1:55:03] simple experience to confirm to herself
[1:55:05] that she has
[1:55:07] it she's been talk completely wrong and
[1:55:09] she's in bondage because one she thinks
[1:55:12] she can lose it and two she thinks she
[1:55:14] has it because she does something that
[1:55:15] has nothing to do with the baptism of
[1:55:16] the Holy Ghost what a shame in bondage
[1:55:20] by the traditions of men
[1:55:22] sincere people sincerely seeking the
[1:55:25] Holy Ghost sincerely wanting to serve
[1:55:27] Christ amen but they sto short of the
[1:55:29] true baptism of the holy spirit because
[1:55:31] all they get is an evidence that they've
[1:55:33] made up and it's not according to the
[1:55:35] full word of God it's a work of their
[1:55:37] own lips rather than the work of the
[1:55:38] holy spirit in their life to strive so
[1:55:41] hard to get ahead in the word of God and
[1:55:44] fall short by what a tradition of man a
[1:55:47] denominational
[1:55:49] teaching the least of the gifts Paul
[1:55:52] says this now ye are the body of Christ
[1:55:55] and members in particular that means
[1:55:57] every one of us is unique and
[1:56:00] specifically here for a purpose every
[1:56:03] single one of
[1:56:05] us he says and God hath
[1:56:07] set
[1:56:09] oh oh
[1:56:12] my
[1:56:14] some
[1:56:16] some so we're not all the same we don't
[1:56:19] all act the same we don't all have the
[1:56:20] same gifts we don't all have the same
[1:56:22] Purp purp we don't all have the same
[1:56:23] position we don't have the same
[1:56:25] manifestations of these things God has
[1:56:28] said some in the church first apostles
[1:56:30] next prophets third teachers after that
[1:56:33] Miracles and Gifts of healings helps
[1:56:35] governments diversities of
[1:56:37] tongues diversities of tongues does not
[1:56:39] even mean speaking in tongues that's
[1:56:41] people that can speak different
[1:56:42] languages that was a value in that
[1:56:44] church because they had so many people
[1:56:46] mixed up in those
[1:56:48] multitudes how do we know this because
[1:56:50] we'll see in verse 30 he talks about
[1:56:51] tongues our are all
[1:56:53] Apostles is everyone here an apostle
[1:56:55] nope are all prophets no are all
[1:56:59] teachers no are all workers of
[1:57:03] Miracles Sister Mary Beth when's the
[1:57:05] last time you did a
[1:57:06] miracle see not
[1:57:09] all have all the gifts of
[1:57:13] healing do all speak with tongues do all
[1:57:17] interpret now the answer to every one of
[1:57:20] those previous questions up to tongues
[1:57:22] is no then what's the answer to tongues
[1:57:24] no so if not all speak with tongues then
[1:57:27] how can it be the evidence of the Holy
[1:57:29] Spirit it cannot be scripturally
[1:57:31] speaking the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:34] Paul is clearly saying not everybody
[1:57:36] does it have
[1:57:38] all sorry do all
[1:57:40] interpret he says but covet earnestly
[1:57:43] the best gifts gifts not evidences gifts
[1:57:49] he says but yet I show unto you a more
[1:57:51] EXC excellent way so beyond all of this
[1:57:55] Beyond every single one of these gifts
[1:57:58] is a better way and Paul he hammers it
[1:58:02] home in Corinthians 13:1 1 Corinthians
[1:58:04] 13:1 though I speak with the tongues of
[1:58:06] men and angels listen you can speak with
[1:58:08] a Godly language you can speak with an
[1:58:10] Earthly language you can speak every
[1:58:12] language and have not
[1:58:15] charity Agape the love of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:19] the personal presence of God in your
[1:58:21] life he says I am become as sounding
[1:58:24] brass or a tinkling symbol he says so
[1:58:28] what you're say what he's saying there
[1:58:29] is you will be of no purpose to the
[1:58:31] kingdom of
[1:58:33] God anybody know what a clanging symbol
[1:58:35] is like anybody ever ever give your kids
[1:58:38] a set of symbols where they can just
[1:58:40] bang them together worst sound ever amen
[1:58:43] sister Leah has been there worst sound
[1:58:45] ever annoying drive you
[1:58:50] nuts I was on
[1:58:53] 38 he's saying that's what you are if
[1:58:56] you do all those things but you don't
[1:58:58] have the Holy Ghost which means you can
[1:59:00] do them without the Holy Ghost Amen Let
[1:59:05] me close with this I've read a lot of
[1:59:06] scriptures today this is very much
[1:59:08] teaching but I want to emphasize this
[1:59:10] before we close
[1:59:13] today they said what is the evidence
[1:59:15] that a person is really filled with the
[1:59:18] Holy Ghost he says John 14:26 six when
[1:59:23] the Holy Ghost is come he will show you
[1:59:25] things to come now I want you to see how
[1:59:27] he interprets this I've never seen the
[1:59:29] scrip I've never read this before now he
[1:59:31] said see he will perfect
[1:59:36] it manads won't do it he is the word
[1:59:40] when the Holy Ghost is come he will
[1:59:42] identify himself in you with the
[1:59:46] scripture and that is the true sign that
[1:59:48] the holy spirit is in you because it is
[1:59:50] the word now remember I preached just
[1:59:52] before that I believe this was a
[1:59:54] two-fold scripture where the holy spirit
[1:59:56] will show you things to come because the
[1:59:58] word shows us what's to come amen we can
[2:00:00] see what's coming by the word it'll show
[2:00:03] us by a spirit of Prophecy amen that's
[2:00:05] what the the the the spirit of Jesus
[2:00:07] Christ is a is a spirit of Prophecy the
[2:00:10] revelation of Jesus Christ is a spirit
[2:00:11] of Prophecy I should say so it shows us
[2:00:14] what's ahead of us but the Holy Ghost is
[2:00:16] not just a spirit of Prophecy it's a
[2:00:19] spirit of
[2:00:20] fulfillment that's what he's saying here
[2:00:23] he will perfect it how does God
[2:00:25] interpret his word church by bringing it
[2:00:28] to pass so he doesn't just hang us out
[2:00:31] there by telling us what's to coming and
[2:00:33] we never receive it but rather he shows
[2:00:35] us what is there what is available
[2:00:37] what's coming and then he brings it to
[2:00:39] reality brings it into fulfillment into
[2:00:41] our lives amen we'll get to see that
[2:00:44] what the Holy Spirit has spoken comes
[2:00:46] true he'll perfect it he'll bring it to
[2:00:48] maturity he'll bring it to reality he
[2:00:51] says now look what if you spoke with
[2:00:54] tongues I just want to ask you that
[2:00:56] Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what
[2:00:57] he would do and what if you spoke with
[2:00:59] tongues jumped up and down shouted and
[2:01:01] everything else and then come to the
[2:01:03] word and I'd prove to you by the
[2:01:04] scripture as I have that the baptism
[2:01:06] using the title of Father Son and Holy
[2:01:08] Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding
[2:01:10] in the scripture nobody was ever
[2:01:12] baptized like that and you go ahead and
[2:01:14] hang with it anyhow he says could you
[2:01:16] tell me the holy spirit in you would do
[2:01:18] a thing like that how can it deny its
[2:01:20] own word listen God doesn't hold you
[2:01:23] accountable for what you don't know but
[2:01:26] when he brings it your way if you are a
[2:01:28] holy ghost filled believer you'll
[2:01:30] correct it this is why I've said before
[2:01:34] I believe you can have the Holy Ghost
[2:01:36] outside of the revealed word but it will
[2:01:38] bring you into the revealed
[2:01:40] word amen I don't believe brother Vel is
[2:01:44] here by
[2:01:45] Chance the spirit leads a child of God
[2:01:47] to the word amen how can it deny its own
[2:01:52] he says he says what is that he says
[2:01:54] you're committing adultery against your
[2:01:56] own body and when a woman goes out and
[2:01:59] lives with another man or a man with
[2:02:00] another woman when they're married to
[2:02:02] them they are when they're married to
[2:02:03] another they are defiling their own
[2:02:05] flesh and when a person says that he is
[2:02:08] a Christian and will absolutely deny the
[2:02:10] scripture being right he's committing
[2:02:12] adultery against the body that he claims
[2:02:14] to be in he says see so it's a mark of
[2:02:17] antichrist so much that would deceive
[2:02:20] the elected if possible
[2:02:22] amen God bless you stand if you would
[2:02:24] the musicians can
[2:02:27] come this has been very much teaching I
[2:02:29] know that certainly some preaching
[2:02:31] Blended in there and I trust we know
[2:02:33] these things but you know what I don't
[2:02:35] know what our young people know and
[2:02:36] don't know I don't know what's been
[2:02:38] preached since before I came here
[2:02:40] necessarily I know we've always been
[2:02:41] taught by Brother Gerald that it's not
[2:02:43] the evidence but sometimes we need to
[2:02:44] just roll through these things in the
[2:02:45] scripture and let the scripture
[2:02:47] interpret itself amen but this is really
[2:02:49] setting us up for the third ser third uh
[2:02:53] service on this because you I've said
[2:02:55] brother you know that that the evidence
[2:02:57] brother B says the evidence the
[2:02:58] scripture says the evidence of the holy
[2:03:00] spirit is that you receive the word but
[2:03:03] what does that look
[2:03:04] like because we all want an
[2:03:07] Evidence listen I know I'm married
[2:03:09] because I have a wife and I have a ring
[2:03:12] I have evidence that I'm married I have
[2:03:15] experiences that show that I'm married
[2:03:18] and when it comes to our relationship
[2:03:19] with God I believe we all want an
[2:03:21] Evidence
[2:03:23] but I will tell you this in the end
[2:03:26] you're going to have to have a personal
[2:03:28] revelation in the end that's it there is
[2:03:31] no one evidence that you could give
[2:03:33] right now today that says you're going
[2:03:35] all the way except the faith of God in
[2:03:38] your heart that says I've met him he's
[2:03:41] working with me and he's given me his
[2:03:42] word but I want to break it down you
[2:03:44] know me I yes I I love the
[2:03:47] Mysteries but I want to break it down as
[2:03:49] a pastor to where we're living Day by
[2:03:51] day not to give you un
[2:03:54] evidence but to give you what the
[2:03:56] scripture says about what happens when a
[2:03:58] person is filled with the holy spirit
[2:04:00] amen and hopefully that'll help us so we
[2:04:02] want to know what it looks like when
[2:04:03] we've received the word because some
[2:04:06] people will say well it's just going to
[2:04:07] church and you've received the end time
[2:04:08] message and and you've heard the word of
[2:04:10] God for our day and that means you've
[2:04:11] got the Holy Ghost no sir it does not
[2:04:14] absolutely it does not but that is UN
[2:04:15] evidence because you will hear the word
[2:04:17] for your
[2:04:18] day after that then we're going to go
[2:04:20] into questions and answers on the Holy
[2:04:23] Spirit how do I know I'm being led of
[2:04:25] the spirit how do I find the will of God
[2:04:27] in my life can I backslide and still
[2:04:31] have the Holy Ghost can I make mistakes
[2:04:33] and have the Holy Ghost can I have
[2:04:34] personal flaws and still have the Holy
[2:04:37] Ghost these different things because
[2:04:40] that's the places where Satan beats us
[2:04:41] up is our day-to-day lives and so I want
[2:04:44] to take the scriptures and I want to
[2:04:45] beat him back not to give
[2:04:49] license but to show you where God's Gra
[2:04:51] grace and mercy is and to give you a
[2:04:54] road back when not if but when you have
[2:04:58] your
[2:04:59] moments we've all sinned and come short
[2:05:01] of the glory of God we sin every single
[2:05:03] day and that I mean we step away from
[2:05:05] the word but there's a blood
[2:05:09] covering that he can't see it and
[2:05:12] there's a holy ghost power inside of us
[2:05:14] that will raise us above it day by day
[2:05:16] step by step line by line word by word
[2:05:18] amen and that's where we're going God
[2:05:20] bless you let's bow our heads
[2:05:23] Heavenly
[2:05:25] Father Lord we want
[2:05:28] certainty Lord we want to know that we

[2:05:39] Lord we want to know that our soul is
[2:05:41] sealed Lord and in doing that Lord we
[2:05:43] want to look away from everything that's
[2:05:45] contrary to that testimony but Lord I
[2:05:48] pray you give us a true testimony Lord
[2:05:50] that we would know in our heart of
[2:05:52] hearts that we have received your word
[2:05:55] that your word is working by the Holy
[2:05:58] Spirit to produce a body

[2:06:30] make us real Christians I pray Lord that
[2:06:32] we could show others that you're alive
[2:06:34] and
